He is the founder of Predictive Heuristics, a consultancy that does risk analysis for a variety of clients. Biography Ward received a B. A. (Hons) from Indiana University in 1970 where he studied with Dina A. Zinnes and John Gillespie. He served with the 287th Military Police (Sep) in the Berlin Brigade from 1970 to 1972. Subsequently, he earned a Ph.D. in political science from Northwestern University in 1977 after which he was the Gordon Scott Fulcher Research Fellow where he worked with Harold Guetzkow from 1977 to 1979. He then joined the Science Center Berlin, working with Karl Wolfgang Deutsch and others for two years building a global political model. After leaving the Science Center, he was appointed Associate Professor of political science at the University of Colorado in 1981, where he was Director of the Center for International Relations. He later moved to the University of Washington in 1997 where he was a founding member of the Center for Statistics and the Social Sciences, serving on its executive board for a decade.

Academic work and reception Ward is the author of two books on statistical methods and one book on world geography, as well as editor or co-editor of three books on political science and political geography. Ward is the principal investigator at Ward Lab, a research lab of graduate and undergraduate students at Duke. It is also a website that creates conflict predictions using Bayesian modeling and network analysis. The lab also runs Predictive Heuristics, one of the foremost blogs on global political forecasting and conflict forecasting. Ward's article \\"The perils of policy by p-value\\", along with Brian D. Greenhill and Kristin M. Bakke, was included by political scientist Jay Ulfelder in his list of suggested readings for political forecasters. Phil Schrodt commented that this work is \\"in terms of political prediction using formal models, easily the most important work in the past quarter century.\\" Ward is also known for having a relatively optimistic outlook about the ability to forecast potential conflicts and crises, putting him at odds with Jay Ulfelder, as expressed in an article by Ulfelder for Foreign Policy and a response by Ward and Metternich in the same magazine. Ulfelder later clarified his position and indicated that the disagreement was less deep than it seemed. A paper co-authored by Ward and others at Ward Lab received a mixed review from Ulfelder, who agreed with the author's goals and their assessment of the importance of the scientific value and policy relevance of forecasting, but considered the author's attempt in the paper to be overly ambitious.

He was one of the ambassadors who established the 'Auld alliance' with France and Scotland in 1295. He was present at the siege of Berwick in 1296 with King Edward I of England and fought on the English side during the Battle of Falkirk in 1298. Fighting on the side of Scotland he participated in the siege of Stirling Castle in 1299. He was appointed joint Guardian of Scotland on 10 May 1300 together with William Lamberton, Bishop of St Andrews, and John Comyn, Lord of Badenoch. He resigned the next year and was replaced by John de Soules. He participated in the siege of Lochmaben Castle in September 1301. In 1303 he again became an ambassadors to Paris and upon returning from France in 1304, Ingram had his lands forfeited to King Edward I, who gave them to Sir Henry de Percy.

The adventure's product designation is TSR 9086. Plot summary The Veiled Society is set in the city of Specularum, where the players must determine which of three rival factions is responsible for a murder. In the violent city of Specularum, the Veiled Society has spies everywhere. Specularum is the capital of the Grand Duchy of Karameikos, and the adventure involves the party in a struggle between the city's three major families (the Vorloi, Radu, and Torenescu). Publication history The sixteen page booklet with an outer folder was published by TSR in 1984 and designed by David \\"Zeb\\" Cook. It features cover artwork by Steve Chappell with interior illustrations by Jim Roslof. The module includes cardstock miniatures and sixteen pages of fold-together pieces which form nine cutout houses and a cutout gate. The module was featured in the compilation B1-B9 In Search of Adventure in 1987. Reception Graham Staplehurst reviewed this module for White Dwarf issue No. 63, giving it 9 out of 10 overall, and felt it had \\"all the hallmarks of a classic adventure\\" despite what he felt were the \\"useless\\" cutouts. Staplehurst felt that having the adventure set in Specularum \\"provides players with almost unparalleled opportunity for personal choice and freedom for action\\", calling the adventure \\"true rolegaming and high drama\\", adding that the characters \\"must make the decisions of a real-life adventurer--and suffer the consequences!\\" He observed that the adventure's possibilities are structured to be used by less experienced Dungeon Masters (DMs), but each situation is detailed enough to allow for a variety of outcomes. Staplehurst felt that the plot read too much like a crude detective story, and gave the players little motivation. This, he felt, leaves extra preparatory work for the DM, who may want to weave the city into their campaign and make use of existing character histories, for the scenario to work to its full potential. In his review of B1-9 In Search of Adventure in Dragon magazine No. 128 (December 1987), Ken Rolston calls David \\"Zeb\\" Cook's The Veiled Society one of the \\"two exceptionally fine adventures\\" in the compilation, and \\"a rare example of a political and diplomatic adventure in an urban setting for low-level D&D; game characters\\". In his 1991 book Heroic Worlds, Lawrence Schick calls this adventure \\"more thought- provoking than your usual hack-and-slash Basic scenario\\".

If activated to federal service, the Wing is gained by the United States Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency. The 127th Command and Control Squadron assigned to the Wings 184th Regional Support Group, is a descendant organization of the 127th Observation Squadron, established on 30 July 1940. It is one of the 29 original National Guard Observation Squadrons of the United States Army National Guard formed before World War II. Overview The Kansas Air National Guard‚Äôs 184th Intelligence Wing, Wichita, officially changed its name 1 Aug. 2019 to the 184th Wing. In April 2008 the 184th Intelligence Wing became the first Intelligence Wing in the Air National Guard. The Wing encompasses a variety of missions at the federal, state, and community levels. * Federal: providing combat support for our nation‚ÄîGuardsmen from our wing provide wartime support in the form of collecting and analyzing intelligence. Some unit members deploy overseas to augment active duty forces. * State: support to civil authority‚ÄîThe unit's primary responsibility is to the state of Kansas to assist civil authorities during natural disasters and civil strife in our state. * Community‚ÄîMembers of the 184th add value to our local communities by holding an annual science and technology camp for local kids (called STARBASE), hosting games of the Kansas Special Olympics, and volunteering in various charitable activities. Units The 184 WG consists of the following units: * 184th Intelligence Group (IG) : 161st Intelligence Squadron : 184th Intelligence Support Squadron * 184th Mission Support Group (MSG) * 184th Regional Support Group (RSG) : 127th Command and Control Squadron : Smoky Hill Air National Guard Range : 177th Information Aggressor Squadron * 184th Medical Group History 127th TFS F-100C Super Sabre 54-1913, 1968 On 1 October 1962, the Kansas Air National Guard 127th Tactical Fighter Squadron was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 184th Tactical Fighter Group was established by the National Guard Bureau. The 127th TFS becoming the group's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 184th Headquarters, 184th Material Squadron (Maintenance), 184th Combat Support Squadron, and the 184th USAF Dispensary. In January 1968, following North Korea's seizure of the , the 127th TFS was ordered to extended active duty, and deployed to Kunsan Air Base, South Korea and assigned to the PACAF 354th Tactical Fighter Wing at Kunsan Air Base, South Korea. As a result of this federalization, the 184th TFG was placed in a non-operational status. The 127th was released from active duty in June 1969, being returned to Kansas state control. When returned to the 184th TFG, the group was returned to operational status. On 25 March 1971, the 184th was designated the 184th Tactical Fighter Training Group and acquired the F-105 Thunderchief aircraft, receiving Vietnam War returning aircraft. As the USAF Combat Crew Training School, the unit conducted pilot training in the F-105 for nine years. On 1 October 1973, the 184th assumed the responsibility of operating and maintaining the Smoky Hill Weapons Range at Salina, Kansas. With over 36,000 acres, Smoky Hill is the Air National Guard's largest weapons range. 184th TFG F-4D Phantom II 66-0710, 1986 On 7 August 1979, the unit received its first F-4D Phantom II, and on 8 October 1979, was designated as the 184th Tactical Fighter Group, equipped with 50 F-4D's. In April 1982, the 184th was tasked to develop a F-4D Fighter Weapons Instructor Course to meet the needs of the Air Reserve Forces and the USAF Tactical Air Command. In January 1987, the 184th was tasked to activate a squadron of F-16A/B Fighting Falcon aircraft, and conduct conversion and upgrade training in the F-16. On 8 July 1987, the 161st Tactical Fighter Training Squadron was established as the third flying squadron at the 184th TFG. Formal activation ceremonies for the 161st occurred on 12 September 1987, with the unit flying 10 F-16s and conducting its first student training class. A third training squadron, the 177th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron was activated on 1 February 1984. In August 1988, the 127th Tactical Fighter Squadron graduated its final Fighter Weapons Instructor Course Class. The 127th TFS converted as the second F-16 training squadron. The last F-4D departed from the 184th TFG on 31 March 1990. The first F-16C Fighting Falcon arrived at the 184th TFG in July 1990. Post Cold War era 184th Bomb Wing Rockwell B-1B Lancer Lot IV 85-0081, 2000 184th ARW KC-135A 61-0277, 2002 In July 1993, the 184th Fighter Group changed gaining commands and became part of the new Air Education and Training Command. In July 1994, the 184th Fighter Group was designated at the 184th Bomb Wing and again became part of the Air Combat Command, flying the B-1B Lancer. The 184th was the first Air National Guard unit to fly bombers. The 127th Bomb Squadron received its B-1Bs from the former 28th Bomb Squadron/384th Bomb Wing at McConnell. With the receipt of the B-1, the 161st and 177th Fighter Squadrons were inactivated. In order to save money, the USAF agreed to reduce its active fleet of B-1Bs from 92 to 60 aircraft. The first B-1B was flown to storage at AMARC on August 20, 2002. In total, 24 B-1Bs were consigned to storage at AMARC, with ten of these being retained in \\"active storage\\" which means that they could be quickly returned to service should circumstances dictate. The remaining 14 in storage at AMARC will be scavenged for spare parts to keep the remainder flying. The remaining 8 aircraft to be withdrawn from service were placed on static display at various museums. In exchange for retiring its B-1s, the 184th was redesigned the 184th Air Refueling Wing on 16 September 2002, flying the KC-135R tanker. In addition to the tanker mission, the 184th also took on several new missions within the information operations mission set. BRAC 2005 In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign McConnell Air National Guard (ANG) Base by relocating the 184th Air Refueling Wing (ANG) nine KC-135R aircraft to the 190th Air Refueling Wing at Forbes Field AGS, which would retire its eight assigned KC-135E aircraft. The 184th Air Refueling Wing 's operations and maintenance manpower would transfer with the aircraft to Forbes. Realigning ANG KC-135R aircraft from McConnell to Forbes would replace the 190th's aging, higher maintenance KC-135E aircraft with newer models while retaining the experienced personnel from one of the highest-ranking reserve component tanker bases. In June 2007, the 190 ARW gained custody of all KC-135R aircraft from the 184th ARW. This action consolidated all of the Kansas ANG's KC-135R assets into a single wing located at Forbes Field. In April 2008, the 184th Air Refueling Wing was designated the 184th Intelligence Wing making it the first Intelligence Wing in the Air National Guard. With the loss of the flying mission the \\"Flying Jayhawks\\" are now the \\"Fighting Jayhawks\\".

Railway station Gateway in the Vatican with sliding door built in the wall surrounding the Vatican, which admits the railway to the Vatican station. Railway Magazine (1934) The Vatican City railway station (in Italian, Stazione Citt√† del Vaticano or Stazione Vaticana) is the only railway station of the Vatican Railway. It was built approximately from the Entrance Gateway by architect Giuseppe Momo. Construction began on 3 April 1929, and the station began operation in 1933. Its simple white, Italian marble design was described by writer H. V. Morton as \\"more like a branch of the Barclay Bank in London.\\" The station building is composed of white marble, and its dimensions are . The central body is tall and the lateral ones tall. Infos about the building on www.vatican.va Part of the station building continues in use as passenger station and goods (rail freight) office, whilst part now houses the Vatican numismatic and philatelic museum. The railway station also houses the small Vatican tax-free department store, a private facility open only to Vatican subjects and diplomats.Vatican Tax-Free Department Store Busy This Season Route Eight-span viaduct carrying the Vatican Railway over the Gelsomino valley up to the sliding-door gateway into Vatican precincts. St. Peter's in the background. Railway Magazine (1934) The Vatican City State Railway branches off from the Rome to Viterbo railway line at the Roma San Pietro railway station and crosses Gelsomino valley via a 143.12 metre long masonry viaduct of eight 15.30 metre arches (bearing the Fasces and the Savoy Coat of Arms), which crosses Viale Vaticano (which it interrupts) and Via Aurelia. The Via delle Cave and the Via del Gelsomino are also interrupted by the viaduct and thus merge with the Via Aurelia. Train crossing the viaduct over the Via Aurelia to enter the Vatican The single track section of the route up until the border was subsequently fitted with overhead electric line. The first 100 metres of overhead line is always supplied with 3000V DC, with the remainder of the distance only energerised as needed.} Before passing through the Vatican City walls and terminating in the Vatican City railway station, the line passes under an arch decorated with the Coat of Arms of Pope Pius XI with a two-piece 35.5 ton iron gate which slides into the recesses of the Vatican walls. Infos about the gateway on www.vatican.va The gate is closed when there is no traffic scheduled on the line. The railway has two tracks (partly located in Rome, outside the gateway), but only one is served by a station platform. Two dead-end loading tracks, for freight wagons, are situated on the northwest side of the building. They are connected to the main track that ends in a headshunt in a straight tunnel under the hillside. The station is near the Vatican Gardens, behind St. Peter's Basilica. Other buildings near the station are the Governatorate Palace and the Domus Sanctae Marthae. The gateway separating the station from rail track in Italian territory is an opening in the Leonine Wall. Uses Freight The Vatican railway has been used primarily for importing goods. Extensive freight operations were witnessed before road transport became more common and less expensive. Although the volume has decreased, there are still regular freight services into the Vatican. Information about the traffic on www.vatican.va Passengers There have been intermittent periods of ordinary passenger train operation into the Vatican, but in contemporary use the Vatican City station has only had regularly scheduled passenger service trains since 2015. A weekly special passenger train operates, provided by the Vatican Museums and the Italian railway. A special train for invited guests and media reporters inaugurated the run on 11 September 2015. This inaugural train was hauled by FS Class 625 steam locomotive 625-017, built in 1915. The same engine was used by the Italian royal family, and also hauled the train which carried Pope John XXIII to Loreto and Assisi in 1962. The regular service has operated every Saturday since 12 September 2015, with visitors to the Vatican Museums boarding a train to travel to the Pontifical Villas in Castel Gandolfo. Scheduled trains use contemporary suburban rolling stock to travel from Vatican City railway station to Albano Laziale, via Castel Gandolfo. At the station visitors can tour the newly created museum and pontifical gardens, and visit the town. The tour returns the same afternoon, terminating one stop to the south at .Regular trains from the Vatican The Railway Magazine issue 1375 October 2015 page 107 Rolling stock Pope Pius XI's planned papal train was never constructed, and the Vatican City State has never employed any railway workers or registered any rolling stock. All locomotives, carriages, and wagons (including those which currently convey goods into the Vatican) belong to the Italian Railways (FS). In 2007, Fiat donated a New Holland Agriculture tractor to the Pope. The tractor is normally parked at the end of the station platform, where it can be used for shunting duties instead of a locomotive. Pius IX's official train from the time of the Papal States remains on display at the Museum of Rome, housed in the Palazzo Braschi.

He played for the Boston Reds (1884), Providence Grays (1885), Buffalo Bisons (1885), Washington Nationals (1886), New York Giants (NL) (1888‚Äì89, 1892‚Äì93), New York Giants (PL) (1890), Cincinnati Kelly's Killers (1891), Cincinnati Reds (1891), and Brooklyn Grooms (1893). Crane was the first pitcher in the history of major league baseball to record 4 strikeouts in a single inning (New York Giants, 1888), and is one of the few players to play in four major leagues: the Union Association, the National League, the Players' League, and the American Association. Born in Boston, Cannonball Crane was a man of uncommon strength. In his prime, he was described as \\"a giant in physical strength and proportions.\\" He reportedly could throw a baseball 135 yards, farther than anyone else who played the game in his era. After his playing career ended, he died from what was officially declared an accidental overdose but was reported by others to have been a suicide.  Early years (1884‚Äì87)  Cannonball debuted in April 1884 with the Boston Reds of the Union Association. He played in 101 games for the Reds, including 57 as an outfielder and 42 as a catcher. As a rookie, he was among the UA league leaders in most batting categories, with 12 home runs (2nd in the UA), a .451 slugging percentage (4th in the UA), 193 total bases (4th in the USA), 41 extra base hits (5th in the UA), 59 runs (7th in the UA), 122 hits (8th in the UA), and a .285 batting average (10th in the UA). After a promising rookie year, Crane moved to the National League where he did not fare as well. In 1885, Crane played in the National League for the Providence Grays and Buffalo Bisons but appeared in only 14 games, all as an outfielder. In 1886, he played in 80 games for the Washington Nationals, including 68 games as an outfielder and 10 games (70 innings) as a pitcher. His performance as a batter dropped off dramatically, as his batting average plummeted to .171 and he struck out 54 times. He did not fare much better as a pitcher, with a record of 1‚Äì7, an earned run average of 7.20 and an Adjusted ERA+ of 45. With a dismal performance in 1886, Crane did not find a spot in the major leagues in 1887. Instead, Crane went to Canada and had a tremendous season for the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1887. He won the International League batting title in 1887, hitting for a .428 average (bases on balls counted as hits for the 1887 season in the Int‚Äôl League.) His .428 average in 1887 still stands as the highest batting average by a pitcher in professional baseball. He also set the all-time Maple Leafs‚Äô record with 33 wins, as he led the Maple Leafs to their first International League pennant.Toronto Maple Leafs (International League) On one occasion in 1887, Crane won both games of a Saturday doubleheader and also hit the game-winning home run in the second game.  The New York Giants and Spalding's World Tour (1888‚Äì90)  After a great showing for the Maple Leafs, Crane signed with the New York Giants where he played in 1888 and 1889. In the 1888 season, Crane was 5‚Äì6 for the pre-modern World Series champion Giants. Crane accomplished two baseball firsts in 1888. On September 27, 1888, Crane became the first player in New York Giants‚Äô history to throw a no- hitter. In a seven-inning game that was called due to darkness, Cannonball Crane held the Senators hitless in a 3‚Äì0 victory at the Polo Grounds. Crane retired six batters on ground balls to himself and struck out five Senators. The following week, on October 4, 1888, Crane became the first pitcher in major league history to strike out four batters in one inning. In the 1889 season, Crane pitched in 29 games (25 as a starter) and had a much improved record of 14‚Äì10 and earned run average of 2.43 in 230 innings. Crane's career reached its pinnacle in the 1889 World Series, as Crane was the hero on the mound and at the plate. On the mound, Crane started 5 games and won 4, pitching 38 innings with a 3.79 ERA. At the plate, Crane had 5 RBIs, a .611 slugging percentage, scored 3 runs, a double, a triple, and a home run. An October 1889 newspaper account in The World described Crane's World Series performance as follows: \\"Ed Crane, fat and jolly, went into the pitcher's box for New York... Ed shot them in with terrific speed and brought joy to the New Yorkers, who saw the Grooms [i.e., Brooklyn Bridegrooms] succumb, one after another, to his invincible 'curves' and 'shoots'.\\" The newspaper's reference to Crane as \\"fat and jolly\\" was not the first such reference to Crane's girth. He won the nickname \\"Cannonball\\" due to his large size. He reportedly loved to eat and weighed 204 pounds at 5'10\\". (Tom Schott, Nick Peters, \\"The Giants Encyclopedia\\", p. 406.) Another book described Crane as a \\"prodigious eater\\" whose favorite snack consisted of \\"an order of a dozen soft-boiled eggs served in a soup bowl, which he liked to top off with an order of two dozen clams.\\" (Lee Allen, \\"The Cincinnati Reds (1948)\\", p. 43) After reaching the high point of his career in the 1889 World Series, Crane's life began a downhill spiral that fall. After the 1889 season, Crane traveled on the famous Spalding World Tour where he developed a taste for alcohol. The tour included 20 of the best players in baseball and covered Asia and Europe, lasting until early April 1890. One newspaper reported: \\"Until then, he never drank, but when the aggregation reached Paris Crane fell. . . . When he reached America again not only could he drink champagne but he had acquired a taste for less expensive drinks.\\" The world tour was reportedly the \\"turning point\\" in Crane's life, as drinking eventually left him \\"without employment and incapacitated for work.\\" A full account of Crane's time on the Spalding world tour can be found in the Mark Lamster book, \\"Spalding's World Tour: The Epic Adventure that Took Baseball Around the Globe‚Äîand Made It America's Game.\\" After returning from the Spalding tour, Crane joined the Players' League movement (a competing league formed by the players in 1890) and played with many of his former teammates for the newly formed New York Giants of the Players' League. He had a record of 16‚Äì19 and an ERA of 3.68 in 330-1/3 innings. Starting in 1890, Crane's control began to fail, as he gave up walks at a historic pace. In 1890, he gave up 210 bases on balls‚Äîthe 13th highest single season total in major league history. He followed with 203 walks in 1891 and 189 in 1892‚Äîboth years ranking among the highest single season totals of all time.  Later years and death (1891‚Äì96)  In 1891, Crane played for Kelly's Killers and led the American Association with a 2.45 ERA (Adjusted ERA+ of 169) and 25 complete games in 250 innings. He spent the last part of the 1891 season with the Cincinnati Reds and finished the year with an 18‚Äì22 record. He followed in 1892 with a 24-loss record for the New York Giants. His major league career ended in 1893 as the 31-year-old Crane split the season between the Giants and the Brooklyn Grooms. After being released by Brooklyn, Crane played with Toronto and then with Providence and Rochester. The 1896 season proved to be his last, and playing for Rochester, \\"he proved to be a failure but played the season out.\\" According to his obituary, \\"his arm was in poor shape\\", and he was released by Rochester. He was then picked up by Springfield, where he \\"fared no better.\\" He umpired a few games for Rochester but was released by the league president. After his final release, the 34-year-old Crane spent the last few weeks of his life \\"going about the country\\" picking up odd jobs and \\"drinking harder and harder.\\" On the day before his death, he was given notice that he would have to vacate his room (in a Rochester, New York hotel) the next day. He had been drinking heavily all day, and when he retired \\"seemed to be very gloomy.\\" The next morning, Crane was found dead in his bed. A coroner's inquest was conducted, and the official verdict was an \\"accidental death from taking a chloral prescription for nervousness.\\" Despite the coroner's verdict, others reported that Crane committed suicide by drinking acid. Crane was survived by a wife and child.  Cannonball Crane in modern literature  In 1996, Canadian poet Bruce Meyer published a book \\"Goodbye Mr. Spalding\\", which includes a story titled \\"Sunlight Park.\\" Sunlight Park was the name of the first ballpark in Toronto. Meyer chronicles Cannonball Crane's performance in leading the Maple Leafs to Toronto's first baseball championship in 1887 pennant and, a century later, a grieving father's drive to uncover the events surrounding Cannonball's death. Unable to confront the death of his teenage son, the father chooses, instead, to unravel the secret of Crane's final days. His desire to learn the truth transports him through time to an imagined meeting with Cannonball. Their \\"interview\\" resolves the mystery of Crane's apparent suicide and helps the father accept the death of his son.

The polarization effect was originally discovered by Conrad Schlumberger when measuring the resistivity of rock. The survey method is similar to electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), in that an electric current is transmitted into the subsurface through two electrodes, and voltage is monitored through two other electrodes. Induced polarization is a geophysical method used extensively in mineral exploration and mine operations. Resistivity and IP methods are often applied on the ground surface using multiple four-electrode sites. In an IP survey, in addition to resistivity measurement, capacitive properties of the subsurface materials are determined as well. As a result, IP surveys provide additional information about the spatial variation in lithology and grain-surface chemistry. The IP survey can be made in time- domain and frequency-domain mode: In the time-domain induced polarization method, the voltage response is observed as a function of time after the injected current is switched off or on. In the frequency-domain induced polarization mode, an alternating current is injected into the ground with variable frequencies. Voltage phase-shifts are measured to evaluate the impedance spectrum at different injection frequencies, which is commonly referred to as spectral IP. The IP method is one of the most widely used techniques in mineral exploration and mining industry and it has other applications in hydrogeophysical surveys, environmental investigations and geotechnical engineering projects. Measurement methods Time domain Typical transmitted current waveform and potential response for time domain resistivity and induced polarization measurements. Time-domain IP methods measure considers the resulting voltage following a change in the injected current. The time domain IP potential response can be evaluated by considering the mean value on the resulting voltage, known as integral chargeability or by evaluating the spectral information and considering the shape of the potential response, for example describing the response with a Cole-Cole model. Frequency domain Frequency-domain IP methods uses alternating currents (AC) to induce electric charges in the subsurface, and the apparent resistivity is measured at different AC frequencies.

Formerly, it was known as the Higher College of Agriculture, as well as other names, since its establishment in 1890. History As early as 1776 the university's patron Hugo Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj, then a member of the National Education Commission, postulated creating a Department of Agriculture as part of the reformed Cracow Academy. The department existed for a very short period between 1806‚Äì1809 due to the partitions of Poland that ended the existence of the sovereign Polish state. Over 80 years later, a three-year Agricultural Study was established at the Faculty of Philosophy of the Jagiellonian University in 1890, at the Collegium Iuridicum. Collegium GodlewskiegoProfessor Emil Godlewski became the Head of the Study in 1892. It was thanks to his efforts that the Collegium Agronomicum was built in 1906‚Äì1910 for Agricultural Study. The building, later named after him, is now the seat of the Rector's office, and the University's Senate. The Study existed till 1923 when it was transformed into the Faculty of Agriculture of the Jagiellonian University. In 1924 the Faculty offered Europe's first Higher Academic Cooperative Course. The studies took four years and graduates obtained a BSc degree. In the same year horticultural courses were offered, later transformed into a three-year Horticultural Study. The Second World War caused considerable losses to the University, most seriously among the Faculty of Agriculture staff (see: Operation Sonderaktion Krakau). In spite of considerable difficulties posed by the German occupation secret courses in agronomy were conducted, headed by a temporary Dean Anatol Listowski. After the war, the Faculty resumed its activity in January 1945. In 1946 it was renamed as the Agriculture and Forestry Faculty, and later (1949) transformed into two separate faculties. In 1953 the Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry became the Higher College of Agriculture. In 1963 the Faculty of Animal Science branched out from the Faculty. Further development of the University took place in the following years. New faculties were created: the Faculty of Land Reclamation (1955) with the Geodesy Division (since 1960); Forestry (reactivated in 1963), and the Faculty of Horticulture. By decree of the Council of Ministers as of 28 September 1972 the Higher College of Agriculture became a University of Agriculture. A new division of Mechanization and Energetics in Agriculture was formed and later changed into a separate faculty in 1977. An out-of-town branch called the Faculty of Economics and Agricultural Commerce was created in Rzesz√≥w in 1973, then changed into the Faculty of Economy - Rzesz√≥w Branch. Currently, since 1 April 1997 it has regained its status as the Faculty of Economy. A Division of Food Technology was created at the Faculty of Agriculture in 1974 and became a separate Faculty of Food Technology twenty years later. Between the years 1923‚Äì1990 over 26 thousand students graduated from the Agricultural Study, later Faculty of Agriculture of the Jagiellonian University and the Agricultural University of Krak√≥w, out of which 260 became associate or full professors, almost half of them employed at higher educational institutions or research institutes. 8105 students pursued studies at the Agricultural University in the academic year 1995-96, including 5582 internal and 2523 external students.

Although a small action, involving only a few hundred troops, it was the decisive battle in a civil war between the king and the Black Douglases, the most powerful aristocratic family in the country. As the king's supporters won it was a significant step in the struggle to establish a relatively strong centralised monarchy in Scotland during the Late Middle Ages. The Black Douglases had already suffered some losses before the battle. The king's supporters had taken their castle at Abercorn, and some allies such as the Hamiltons had defected. The head of the family, James Douglas, 9th Earl of Douglas, had gone to England to rally support, but his three younger brothers were at the battle. There is some uncertainty about the leadership of the royal army. By some accounts it was led by George Douglas, 4th Earl of Angus, head of the Red Douglas family, a senior aristocrat, and third cousin to the Earl of Douglas. However other accounts describe it as a force of local Border families, Johnstones, Carruthers, Maxwells, and Scotts, who had previously been dominated by the Black Douglases but now rebelled against them, led by the Laird John Johnstone of Johnstone in Annandale, who succeeded his father in 1455. Of the three Douglas brothers: Archibald Douglas, Earl of Moray was killed in the battle and his head presented to the king, Hugh Douglas, Earl of Ormonde was captured and executed shortly afterwards, and John Douglas, Lord of Balvenie escaped to England.Battle of Arkinholm oxfordreference.com. Retrieved 29 June 2013. Shortly after the battle the Black Douglases were attainted, the last few castles held by them fell, and they ceased to be a serious force in Scotland. Aftermath After the battle the Douglas, Earl of Angus (Red Douglas) was awarded the earldom of Douglas, previously held by the Black Douglases along with the original possessions of his ancestors in Douglasdale. Thomas Carruthers, the 2nd son of John Carruthers the 3rd Laird of Holmains, received a charter for the lands of Corry on 23 July 1484, for his services at the Battle of Arkinholm. The lands of Corry were forfeited from George Corry for implication of him in the Albany-Douglas invasion.  References   Further reading  *Brown, Michael.

The men were based in Touquin from the end of June until July 8, when they moved to Saints. And the men were lodged in Mauperthuis, half a mile from Saints, while they were flying out of Saints. Quentin Roosevelt was based here when he was shot down and killed. Industry The village has one small factory - the Tuilerie Thibault. Other than that there are some small farms and one large one - Les Aulnois - which serves as a banquet hall. Les Aulnois had once been a Templar's relay station. Education There is single boys and girls school in the village which serves elementary school children.

In the general sense, the spectacle refers to \\"the autocratic reign of the market economy which had acceded to an irresponsible sovereignty, and the totality of new techniques of government which accompanied this reign.\\" It also exists in its limited sense, where spectacle means the mass media, which are \\"its most glaring superficial manifestation.\\" Debord said that the society of the spectacle came to existence in the late 1920s. The critique of the spectacle is a development and application of Karl Marx's concept of fetishism of commodities, reification and alienation,Guy Debord (1967) Society of the Spectacle. (Paris, June 1967). Chapter I: Separation Perfected. and the way it was reprised by Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs in 1923. In the society of the spectacle, the commodities rule the workers and the consumers, instead of being ruled by them, are passive subjects that contemplate the reified spectacle.  History and influences  Bernays and Adorno Debord claims that in its limited sense, spectacle means the mass media, which are \\"its most glaring superficial manifestation.\\".Debord (1977) thesis 24 However T. J. Clark regards this as a journalistic clich√©. Clark argues that the spectacle came to dominate Paris during the Second Empire thanks to Haussmann's renovation of Paris. Debord, however, said that the society of the spectacle came to existence in the late 1920s.Eskilson (2005) pp.377-8Debord (1988) Comments on the Society of the Spectacle, II This is the period in which modern advertising and public relations were introduced, most significantly with the innovative techniques developed by Edward Bernays in his campaigns for the tobacco industry.Donley T. Studlar (2002) Tobacco Control: Comparative Politics in the United States and Canada p.55 quotation: In his 1928 book Propaganda, Bernays theorized the \\"conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses.\\"Bernays (1928) Propaganda, ch.1 The critique of the society of the spectacle shares many assumptions and arguments with the critique of the culture industry made by Theodor W. Adorno and Max Horkheimer in 1944.Eskilson (2005) p.386 n.8Harry F. Dahms No Social Science Without Critical Theory, Volume 25 p.159Garoian, Charles R. (1999) Performing Pedagogy: Toward an Art of Politics pp.70-1Jostein Gripsrud, Lennart Weibull (2010) Media, Markets & Public Spheres: European Media at the Crossroads p.117 Marx and Luk√°cs With The Society of the Spectacle, Debord attempted to provide the Situationist International (SI) with a Marxian critical theory. The concept of \\"the spectacle\\" expanded to all society the Marxist concept of reification drawn from the first section of Karl Marx's Capital, entitled The Fetishism of Commodities and the Secret thereof and developed by Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs in his work, History and Class Consciousness. This was an analysis of the logic of commodities whereby they achieve an ideological autonomy from the process of their production, so that \\"social action takes the form of the action of objects, which rule the producers instead of being ruled by them.\\"Marx, Capital Developing this analysis of the logic of the commodity, The Society of the Spectacle generally understood society as divided between the passive subject who consumes the spectacle and the reified spectacle itself. In a spectacular society, the system of commodity production generates a continual stream of images, for consumption by people who lack the experiences represented therein. The spectacle represents people solely in terms of their subordination to commodities, and experience itself becomes commodified. In the opening of Das Kapital, Marx makes the observation that within the capitalist mode of production we evaluate materials not by what purpose they serve or what they're actually useful for, but we instead recognize them based on their value in the market.Karl Marx (1867) Volume I, Section 4. The Fetishism of Commodities and the Secret thereof. Das Kapital (1867). In capitalist society, virtually identical products often have vastly different values simply because one has a more recognizable or prestigious brand name. The value of a commodity is abstract and not tied to its actual characteristics. Much in the same way capitalism commodifies the material world, the situationists assert that advanced capitalism commodifies experience and perception. Features and aspects of the Spectacle Recuperation As early as 1958, in the situationist manifesto, Debord described official culture as a \\"rigged game\\", where conservative powers forbid subversive ideas to have direct access to the public discourse. Such ideas get first trivialized and sterilized, and then they are safely incorporated back within mainstream society, where they can be exploited to add new flavors to old dominant ideas.Debord (1957) pp.2, 10 This technique of the spectacle is sometimes called recuperation. To survive, the spectacle must maintain social control and effectively handle all threats to the social order. Recuperation, a concept first proposed by Guy Debord,Robert Chasse, Bruce Elwell, Jonathon Horelick, Tony Verlaan. (1969) Faces of Recuperation. In the American section of the Situationist International, issue #1 (New York, June 1969). is the process by which the spectacle intercepts socially and politically radical ideas and images, commodifies them, and safely incorporates them back within mainstream society. More broadly, it may refer to the appropriation or co-opting of any subversive works or ideas by mainstream media. It is the opposite of d√©tournement, in which conventional ideas and images are reorganized and recontextualized with radical intentions. Debord discusses the close link between revolution and culture and everyday life, and the reason why conservative powers are interested in forbidding them \\"any direct access to the rigged game of official culture.\\" Debord recalls that worldwide revolutionary movements that emerged during the 1920s were followed by \\"an ebbing of the movements that had tried to advance a liberatory new attitude in culture and everyday life,\\" and that such movements were brought to a \\"complete social isolation.\\"Section 3 The Function of Minority Trends in the Period of Reflux Different forms In Comments on the Society of the Spectacle (1988), Debord modified his argument, and claimed that the spectacle manifests itself in three different forms: Concentrated spectacle The spectacle associated with concentrated bureaucracy. Debord associated this spectacular form mostly with the Eastern Bloc and Fascism, although today mixed backward economies import it, and even advanced capitalist countries in times of crisis. Every aspect of life, like property, music, and communication is concentrated and is identified with the bureaucratic class. The concentrated spectacle generally identifies itself with a powerful political leader. The concentrated spectacle is made effective through a state of permanent violence and police terror. Diffuse spectacle The diffuse spectacle is the spectacle associated with advanced capitalism and commodity abundance. In the diffuse spectacle, different commodities conflict with each other, preventing the consumer from consuming the whole. Each commodity claims itself as the only existent one, and tries to impose itself over the other commodities: The diffuse spectacle is more effective than the concentrated spectacle. The diffuse spectacle operates mostly through seduction, while the concentrated spectacle operates mostly through violence. Because of this, Debord argues that the diffuse spectacle is more effective at suppressing non-spectacular opinions than the concentrated spectacle. Integrated spectacle The spectacle associated with modern capitalist countries. The integrated spectacle borrows traits from the diffuse and concentrated spectacle to form a new synthesis. Debord argues that this is a very recent form of spectacular manifestation, and that it was pioneered in France and Italy. According to Debord, the integrated spectacle goes by the label of liberal democracy. This spectacle introduces a state of permanent general secrecy, where experts and specialists dictate the morality, statistics, and opinions of the spectacle. Terrorism is the invented enemy of the spectacle, which specialists compare with their \\"liberal democracy\\", pointing out the superiority of the latter one. Debord argues that without terrorism, the integrated spectacle wouldn't survive, for it needs to be compared to something in order to show its \\"obvious\\" perfection and superiority. Legacy A long tradition of work exists in political science on the \\"political spectacle\\"McLagan, Meg. \\"Spectacles of difference: cultural activism and the mass mediation of Tibet\\", Media Worlds: Anthropology on New Terrain, 2002, p.107 started with Debord;Edelman, Murray (1998) Constructing the political spectacle. Wedeen, Lisa (1999) Ambiguities of Domination: Politics, Rhetoric, and Symbols in Contemporary Syria. many literary critics and philosophers in the 20th century contributed to this analysis. According to anthropologist Meg McLagan, \\"Debord analyzes the penetration of the commodity form into mass communication, which he argues results in the spectacle\\". Andrew Hussey claims in his biography of Debord that the term spectacle began life not in a Marxist context, but was first borrowed from Nietzsche and his concept of the mass secret. The critic Sadie Plant argues that later theories of postmodernism, particularly those of Baudrillard and Lyotard, owe much to Debord's theory, and represent an apolitical appropriation of its criticism of the unreality of life under late capitalism. Debord was a rebel to his core and despised academic commodification of his ideas and their integration into the diffuse spectacle. Throughout his life he fought to make his ideas truly revolutionary. In Green Illusions, Ozzie Zehner draws largely on Debord to argue that the spectacles of solar cells, wind turbines, and other technologies have organized environmental thinking around energy-production at the expense of energy-reduction strategies.

Aesthetic theory Leonard B. Meyer, in Emotion and Meaning in Music (1956), distinguished \\"formalists\\" from what he called \\"expressionists\\": \\"...formalists would contend that the meaning of music lies in the perception and understanding of the musical relationships set forth in the work of art and that meaning in music is primarily intellectual, while the expressionist would argue that these same relationships are in some sense capable of exciting feelings and emotions in the listener\\" (Meyer 1956, p. 3). (The term \\"expressionism\\" is also used to define a musical genre typified by the early works of Schoenberg. The two terms are not necessarily related.) Meyer applied the term formalist (p. 3) to Eduard Hanslick who, in his later years, championed the music of Brahms over that of Liszt and Wagner because of the clear formal principles (drawn from Beethoven's music) that he found in Brahms's music as opposed to the attempts at emotional expression and pictorial depiction (drawn from Berlioz's music) that he found in the music of Liszt and Wagner. Meyer also applied the term to Igor Stravinsky, though Stravinsky avoided applying the term to himself in the same sense. His Po√©tique musicale of 1942 (translated in 1947 as Poetics of Music) explores \\"The phenomenon of music\\" (title of chapter 2) from a formalist perspective. The book is the transcript of a series of lectures Stravinsky gave at Harvard University as part of the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures in 1939‚Äì40. Soviet Union Two famous allegations of formalism were leveled at Dmitri Shostakovich. Shostakovich was denounced in the Russian newspaper Pravda in January 1936 in connection with a Moscow performance of his opera Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District. The composer withdrew his Fourth Symphony before its planned first performance, and his subsequent Fifth Symphony was perceived, by at least one journalist if not by the composer himself, as \\"a Soviet artist's reply to just criticism\\".Volkov, Solomon (2004) Shostakovich and Stalin: The Extraordinary Relationship Between the Great Composer and the Brutal Dictator, p. 183\\\\. Little, Brown. . Another allegation came as part of the Zhdanov decree in February 1948, which cited Shostakovich, together with other prominent Soviet composers: Prokofiev, Khachaturian, Shebalin, Popov, Myaskovsky \\"and others\\", as being formalists.Ob opere ‚ÄùVelikaya dru≈æba‚Äù V. Muradely, postanovlaniem TsK VKP(b) ot 10 fevralya 1948 i. In: Izvestiya 11 February 1948. The proscription of formalism was not restricted to the Soviet Union. For instance, in Poland immediately after World War II the Stalinist regime insisted that composers adopt Socialist realism, and those who would not do so, including Witold Lutos≈Çawski and Andrzej Panufnik, had performances of their compositions banned in Poland for being \\"formalist\\". Other Eastern Bloc countries experienced similar restrictions (Zolt√°n Kod√°ly complained to Panufnik of similar problems facing composers in Hungary). Music historiography The term has also been used to designate an approach to writing about music history, sometimes called the \\"Great Works\\" approach (in analogy to \\"Great Books\\") where the music history is conceived in terms of relationships between works of art, to the exclusion of considering cultural contexts. Joseph Kerman's influential book Contemplating Music called for the re-contextualization of musical works and greater investigation into their cultural milieux rather than their subsequent status in the musical canon. This was parallel to the New Historicism in other historical fields, wherein everyday life was deemed as worthy of investigation as great men and great wars. One music historian writing in the 1990s‚Äì2000s, while not necessarily advocating a return to formalism, has criticized the movement away from it as reducing works of art to cultural artifacts and tending to denigrate both \\"meaning\\" in music and the \\"value\\" of exceptional works.Lawrence Kramer, Music as Cultural Practice 1800‚Äì1900, California Studies in 19th Century Music 8 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990).

It was built approximately 1790 and provided a stopover for travelers on the Goshen Turnpike due to its location midway between Bloomingburg and Goshen. History Tears, the son of an early German settler of the region, bought the inn property in 1793 from a New York merchant named John Taylor. The deed mentions a house and outbuilding already on the land.2005; John Tears Inn ; Scotchtown Highlander; retrieved June 11, 2007. He continued to add to the property, eventually building it up to its present size of . In 1824 his father died, and Tears got a tavern license and likely built the Federal style addition on the house at that time. A finely crafted Adam style entrance, wood molding and faux marble fireplaces indicate that the inn was doing rather well. Many of the structures later built for the farm are still standing on the property Upon Tears' death in 1840, he left the inn to his sons Charles and Andrew with the stipulation that his wife be granted tenancy for life and she receive an ample firewood supply. Charles sold his interest in the property to a John McWilliams in 1844, and the latter family took the business over completely when Andrew died six years later. McWilliams' widow in turn sold the building to Clarkson Bird in 1894, beginning a succession of owners that ended in 1936 with the Trimmer family leasing the land. They would buy it outright in 1950. Today Leona Trimmer lives in the house and runs an antique store in the barn. The original stepping stone, which allowed travelers to easily disembark from carriages, survives today and lends its name to the business on the premises. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997 and is currently the only property in the town so listed. In 2006 the property was threatened when a developer proposed to use an abandoned town road through part of the land in order to reach a proposed housing development, but so far that has not come to pass.Sullivan, John; December 29, 2006; \\"'Paper roads' offer potential and problems in Town of Wallkill\\"; Times- Herald Record; retrieved June 11, 2007.

About gemstones, Brazil is the world's largest producer of amethyst, topaz, agate and is a big producer of tourmaline, emerald, aquamarine and garnet. History * Discovery of first gold rush in 1690s, gold discoveries made in streams not far from present day city of Belo Horizonte. * In 1729 diamonds were discovered in the same area. This started a diamond rush. * By 1760 nearly half of the world's gold was from Brazil. * In the early 18th century nearly 400,000 Portuguese immigrants came to mine in southern Brazil. * Over half a million African slaves were shipped to work in the gold mines. *The Gongo Soco gold mine, operated by the Imperial Brazilian Mining Association of Cornwall using skilled Cornish miners and unskilled slaves, produced over of gold between 1826 and 1856.

Eight elements totaled 98.6% of the value: aluminum, copper, tin, iron, manganese, niobium, nickel and gold. The biggest Brazilian highlight is in iron, which has the majority of the participation, whose production is mostly carried out in the states of Minas Gerais and Par√°. According to the National Department of Mineral Production (DNPM), in 2011 there were 8,870 mining companies in the country, and in the Southeast Region, this number reached 3,609, about 40% of the total. In the Southeast region, iron ore, gold, manganese and bauxite stand out in the Quadril√°tero Ferr√≠fero; niobium and phosphate in Arax√°; gems, in Governador Valadares; and graphite, in Salto da Divisa, all in the state of Minas Gerais; in addition to aggregates, in S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, and ornamental rocks, in Esp√≠rito Santo. The mining sector's revenue in Brazil was R$ 153.4 billion in 2019. Exports were U$ 32.5 billion. The country's iron ore production was 410 million tons in 2019. Brazil is the second largest global iron ore exporter and has the second position in the reserve ranking: under Brazilian soil there are at least 29 billion tons . The largest reserves are currently in the states of Minas Gerais and Par√°. According to data from 2013, Minas Gerais is the largest Brazilian mining state. With mining activity in more than 250 municipalities, and more than 300 mines in operation, the state has 40 of the 100 largest mines in Brazil. In addition, of the 10 largest mining municipalities, seven are in Minas, with Itabira being the largest in the country. It is also responsible for approximately 53% of the Brazilian production of metallic minerals and 29% of the total minerals, in addition to extracting over 160 million tons/year of iron ore. Vale S.A. is the main company active in the production of iron ore in the state. The state is the largest employer in the mineral activity (53,791 workers in 2011). S√£o Paulo, the second largest employer, had 19 thousand employees in the sector this year. In 2017, in the Southeast Region, the numbers were as follows: Minas Gerais was the country's largest producer of iron (277 million tons at a value of R$ 37.2 billion), gold (29.3 tons at a value of R$ 3.6 billion), zinc (400 thousand tons at a value of R$ 351 million) and niobium (in the form of pyrochlorine) (131 thousand tons at a value of R$ 254 million).

In vanadium, it produced 358 thousand tons, at a value of R$ 91 million. Coal Sunset in Crici√∫ma. Santa Catarina is the largest coal producer in Brazil, mainly in the city of Crici√∫ma and surroundings. The production of crude mineral coal in Brazil was 13.6 million tons in 2007. Santa Catarina produced 8.7 Mt (million tons); Rio Grande do Sul, 4.5 Mt; and Paran√°, 0.4 Mt. Despite the extraction of mineral coal in Brazil, the country still needs to import about 50% of the coal consumed, as the coal produced in the country is of low quality, as it has a lower concentration of carbon. Among the countries that supply Brazil with mineral coal is South Africa, USA and Australia. Mineral coal in Brazil supplies, in particular, thermoelectric plants that consume about 85% of production. The cement industry in the country, on the other hand, is supplied with approximately 6% of this coal, leaving 4% for the production of cellulose paper and only 5% in the food, ceramics and grains industries. Brazil has reserves of peat, lignite and hard coal. Coal totals 32 billion tons of reserves and is mainly in Rio Grande do Sul (89.25% of the total), followed by Santa Catarina (10.41%). The Candiota Deposit (in Rio Grande do Sul) alone has 38% of all national coal. As it's a coal of inferior quality, it's used only in the generation of thermoelectric energy and at the site of the deposit. The oil crisis in the 1970s led the Brazilian government to create the Energy Mobilization Plan, with intense research to discover new coal reserves. The Geological Survey of Brazil, through works carried out in Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina, greatly increased the reserves of coal previously known, between 1970 and 1986 (mainly between 1978 and 1983). Good quality coal, suitable for use in metallurgy and in large volume (seven billion tons), was then discovered in several deposits in Rio Grande do Sul (Morungava, Chico Lom√£, Santa Teresinha), but at relatively great depths (up to 1,200 m), which has hindered its use until now. In 2011, coal accounted for only 5.6% of the energy consumed in Brazil, but it is an important strategic source, which can be activated when, for example, the water levels in the dams are very low, reducing excessively the supply of water. hydroelectric power. This happened in 2013, when several thermoelectric plants were then shut down, thus maintaining the necessary supply, albeit at a higher cost.Carv√£o MineralCarv√£o mineral no Brasil e no mundo Gemstones Amethyst mine in Ametista do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul.

The station is located near the northern industrial zone of Beit Shemesh. History Beit Shemesh Station was built under Ottoman rule with the construction of the Jaffa-Jerusalem railway, the first rail line in Palestine.Friedman, Jane. \\"SLOW TRAIN TO JERUSALEM\\", The New York Times, August 7, 1983. Accessed September 23, 2007. \\"Built in 1892 by the French during the Turkish reign, the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem line is one of the few early Middle East train lines to have survived the effects of wars and sands.\\" The station has been known under four different names: its original name, Dayr Aban, which was changed during the late Mandatory period to Artuf, and later to Hartuv, the name of a nearby Jewish moshava. The location of the station remained unchanged throughout this period, at a point that now lies on the northern border of the city of Beit Shemesh, near Highway 38. The station was closed to passenger trains in July 1998 due to the poor condition of the tracks. During the upgrade of the Jerusalem line, the station was also redesigned, and the line connected to the Gush Dan train system. The upgrade of the tracks was conducted in two parts: first, which was completed on September 13, 2003, included running track to Beit Shemesh, and the second, concluded on April 9, 2005, extended the line to Jerusalem. At the end of 2006, the track was split in two and the Beit Shemesh station became an intermediate station for transferring between the Tel Aviv-Beit Shemesh line and the Beit Shemesh-Jerusalem line. The split line was cancelled on March 15, 2008. Line split When the line to Jerusalem was completed on April 9, 2005, rail service on the Tel Aviv-Beit Shemesh line was on IC3 trains only, because this was the type of train with the smallest distance between the bogies. Following numerous cracks in the bogies as a result of the winding track and steep slope and the high cost of operation arising from repair of the bogies, it was decided to use only two IC3 systems on the track to Jerusalem. In 2006, the track was split into two for a trial period: Tel Aviv- Beit Shemesh and Beit Shemesh-Jerusalem. Following the split it was attempted to operate double-decker passenger cars until Beit Shemesh, and IC3 systems until Jerusalem. Due to the prolonged wait times in Beit Shemesh‚Äî45 minutes in the direction of Tel Aviv and 15 minutes in the direction of Jerusalem‚Äîthere was a significant decline in the number of rail passengers to and from Jerusalem. In 2007, it was decided to move the Tel Aviv-Beit Shemesh transfer to Nahal Sorek, instead of the transfer at Na'an. As a result, travel time was lengthened by three minutes for trains travelling on the line in all directions, but the waiting time for the train change to and from Jerusalem was reduced to five minutes. With the reduction of travel times, the number of passengers gradually began to rise. The line split was cancelled on March 15, 2008. In 2017 the line split was reinstated with waiting times of between 5 and 31 minutes. A few trains per day run direct. Structure of the station The station includes a large passenger hall, an underground crossing between tracks, a side platform, and an island platform. Train service From Sunday to Thursday, a train leaves the station every hour in the direction of Tel Aviv, and every one or two hours in the direction of Jerusalem. On Fridays and holiday evenings, trains leave the station every hour in the direction of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. On Shabbat evenings and holiday evenings, a single train stops at the station in the direction of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

It is especially prevalent in many developing nations such as India, Ghana, Gambia, Zimbabwe, Egypt and Thailand, where it can be seen outside shops and clinics that offer family planning products, and as in commercial and government messages that promote reproductive health services and population control. It is frequently placed on contraceptive products, such as condoms, diaphragms, spermicidal gel, and IUDs (for instance, on the government-subsidized Nirodh condoms in India and Sultan condoms in Gambia). Origins and variations The red triangle was adopted by Deep Tyagi, an Indian family planning official and activist in the 1960s. Several variations on the basic symbol have since been developed, such as the \\"Life Choices\\" and \\"Family Planning: better life\\" logos used to promote birth control and reproductive health in Ghana, and the \\"Naissances Desirables\\" logo used in Zaire/Congo. The \\"Men Too\\" (shortened from \\"Family Planning is for Everybody ... Men Too\\") campaign in Australia used a hollow red triangle.

ODMA has been adopted by the 3rd-Generation Partnership Project, 3GPP to improve the efficiency of UMTS networks using the TDD mode. One of the objectives of ODMA is to enhance the capacity and the coverage of radio transmissions towards the boundaries of the cell. While mobile stations under the cell coverage area can communicate directly with the base station, mobile stations outside the cell boundary can still access the network and communicating with the base station via multihop transmission. Mobile stations with high data rate inside the cell are used as multihop relays. The initial concept of Opportunity Driven Multiple Access (ODMA) was conceived and patented in South Africa by David Larsen and James Larsen of SRD Pty Ltd in 1978 The ODMA standard was tabled by the 3GPP committee in 1999 due to complexity issues. The technology continues to be developed and enhanced by IWICS who holds the key patents describing the methods employed in ODMA to effect opportunity driven communications. ODMA border coverage ODMA Technology Basic Concepts With the explosion of cellular phone use and Internet multi-media services, wireless networks are becoming increasingly congested. The increased demand has raised our expectations, while creating capacity problems and a need for greater bandwidth. However, if the transmitted power of wireless units is significantly reduced, then there is a potential solution. This implies a signal-to-noise ratio improvement: the ratio is affected by numerous parameters, including radio frequency and path. Opportunity Driven Multiple Access (ODMA) continually determines optimal points along that path to support each transmission. Adaptation ODMA uses many adaptation techniques to optimize communications, but one of the most powerful is path diversity. From origin to destination, ODMA stations relay the transmissions in an intelligent and efficient manner. ODMA Routing Each Subscriber Builds the Network The available optimal paths will increase as subscribers join the network, supporting a fundamental aspect of the ODMA philosophy: Communications are dynamic and local, best controlled at the station level, rather than from some centralized source. Each ODMA-network station is an intelligent burst-mode radio, which can use all the available bandwidth some of the time. However, as with any technology, weather or general network conditions can affect transmissions. Efficiency with Sub-Bands Like cellular networks, the ODMA-network stations operate in the same wide frequency band, but frequency hopping, at lower data rates, introduces sub- bands. Because transmission is packet based and connectionless, stations relay packets from neighbor stations. For each packet, a station optimizes the transmission by adapting the route, power, data rate, packet length, frequency, time window and data quality over a wide range. Each station has responsibility and much autonomy for routing and service-enhancing adaptation to the current environment. For security, stations accept the authority of a network supervisor.

It can be found in nearly all US states and Canadian provinces east of the Great Plains. It is common throughout its range and can be found in a wide variety of open habitats, from thickets and open woods to roadsides and along railroads. Description National Geographic The stems have straight, needle-like thorns, which distinguishes it from very similar species such as R. palustris and R. virginiana, which have curved thorns. The fragrant flowers emerge in early summer. Blooms are about 6 to 8 centimeters (2.5 to 3 inches) in diameter, with five light pink petals and a yellow center. Flowers are typically borne singly on the ends of the current year's growth. There is no repeat bloom. The stems of the rose are upright, grayish in color on new growth, and brown on larger, older branches. Foliage is smooth and dark green. The plants proliferate by root spread. New growth will eventually become small to large thickets, anywhere from 0.5 to 1 m (18 to 40 inches) in height. Habitat The Carolina rose is frequently found in a wide range of habitats, including dry soils, at the border of prairies, woodlands, and savannas, in thickets, in upland forested areas, and dunes. It also grows in wet soils along stream beds, swamps and low grassy areas. It has a wide range, from Nova Scotia, Canada, south to Florida, west to Texas, and north to Ontario. Cultivation The carolina rose can be cultivated. It needs full sun to moderate shade, well-drained soil and regular watering to thrive. The rose hips are edible, although very tart in flavor. The plant is attractive to several species of bees.

From 11 February to 16 July 1858, she reported 18 apparitions of \\"a Lady\\". Soubirous described the lady as wearing a white veil and a blue girdle; she had a golden rose on each foot and held a rosary of pearls. Despite initial skepticism from the Clergy, these claims were eventually declared to be worthy of belief after a canonical investigation, and the apparition is known as Our Lady of Lourdes. According to Soubirous, her visions occurred at the grotto of Massabielle, just outside Lourdes. On 16 July 1858, Soubirous visited the grotto for the last time and said: \\"I have never seen her so beautiful before.\\" On 18 January 1860, the local bishop declared: \\"The Virgin Mary did appear indeed to Bernadette Soubirous.\\" In 1958, Pope Pius XII issued the encyclical Le p√®lerinage de Lourdes (\\"The pilgrimage to Lourdes\\") on the 100th anniversary of the apparitions. Pope John Paul II visited Lourdes three times; Pope Benedict XVI visited Lourdes on 15 September 2008 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the apparitions. Soubirous was canonized a saint in 1933 by Pope Pius XI. February 1858 The 1st appearance (11 February) Our Lady of Lourdes: An artwork depicting the Blessed Virgin Mary appearing on the grotto, in front of Bernadette Soubirous. On Thursday, 11 February 1858, a week before Lent would begin on Ash Wednesday, 14-year-old Bernadette Soubirous was out gathering firewood with her sister Toinette and a friend at the grotto of Massabielle outside Lourdes. There, she reportedly had the first of 18 visions of what she termed \\"a small young lady\\", not in French but in the regional Occitan: uo petito damizelo, standing in a niche in the rock. Her sister and the friend stated that they had seen nothing. On realizing that she alone, and not her companions, had seen the apparition, Soubirous asked her sister not to tell anyone what had happened. Toinette, however, was unable to keep silent, and told their mother, Louise Soubirous. Because their mother had suspected the children were lying, both girls received a beating, and Soubirous was forbidden to return to the grotto again. A few days passed and Soubirous asked for permission to go again with her siblings and the permission was granted. The 2nd appearance (14 February) Troubled by the notion that the apparition might represent an evil spirit, Soubirous used the holy water as a test. A further and positive reassuring sign was the apparition's beautiful bare feet; evil apparitions (even when taking human form) were believed to have cloven hooves or animal paws. The 3rd appearance (18 February) The Apparition did not speak until the third appearance, and therefore its identity was a matter of considerable speculation. Pious villagers Jeanne- Marie Milhet and Antoinette Peyret, on hearing Soubirous' description of the apparition, thought it was the returning spirit of one of their friends, who had died a few months before. Although not part of Catholic doctrine, the concept of the revenant was deeply rooted in Pyrenean superstition. According to tradition, revenants rarely spoke, but communicated their messages in writing, and so Milhet and Peyret furnished Soubirous with paper, a pen, and an inkpot to take with her, in case the apparition should make use of them. On her third visit, she said that the \\"beautiful lady\\" asked her to return to the grotto every day for 15 days. At first her mother had forbidden her to go, but Soubirous persuaded her mother to allow her. Soubirous said that the lady told her that she did not promise to make her happy in this world, but in the next. Although she spoke in Occitan, the regional language that Bernadette (whose French was poor) used, the apparition used a remarkably formal form of the language in her request: \\"Would you have the goodness to come here for fifteen days?\\" (; ). The significance of this politeness was not lost on the observers. It would be very unusual for anyone to adopt this formal form of address when speaking to a penniless, working-class peasant girl such as Bernadette. The 4th appearance (19 February) The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes Armed with a lighted candle for protection, Soubirous came to the grotto. This originated the custom of carrying lighted candles to the grotto. Eight people were present including Soubirous's mother and two of her aunts, one of whom, Aunt Bernarde, was her godmother and the most influential member of her mother's family. Soubirous's story caused a sensation with the townspeople, who were divided in their opinions on whether or not Soubirous was telling the truth. Soon a large number of people followed her on her daily journey, some out of curiosity and others who firmly believed that they were witnessing a miracle. The 5th appearance (20 February) Thirty people were present. Soubirous reported later that the lady had taught her a prayer, which she said every day of her life, but never wrote down or repeated to anyone. By this time, the news was spreading to other towns, and many people assumed that Soubirous's lady was the Virgin Mary. The 6th appearance (21 February) Over 100 people were present, and the apparition said to her: \\"You will pray to God for sinners.\\" Afterwards Soubirous was interrogated by Dominique Jacomet, the police commissioner. Her father, Fran√ßois Soubirous, eventually assured the commissioner that the affair would cease. The 7th appearance (23 February) Lourdes Basilica of the Apparitions About 150 people were present. Jean-Baptiste Estrade (a tax inspector), Duffo (a court official), and the officers from the garrison were present. Soubirous said later that the lady had told her a secret, which was only for her alone; this secret was never revealed to anyone. The 8th appearance (24 February) About 250 people were present. The message of the lady was: \\"Penance! Penance! Penance! Pray to God for sinners! Kiss the ground as an act of penance for sinners!\\" The 9th appearance (25 February) Soubirous was interrogated again. The spring reportedly began to flow a day later. The 10th appearance (27 February) About 800 people were present. The 11th appearance (28 February) Over 1,000 people were present. Soubirous was questioned by Judge Ribes afterwards. March 1858 The 12th appearance (1 March) There were almost 1,500 people present. Local housewife Catherine Latapie, nine months pregnant, who had a paralysis of the ulnar nerve in one arm following an accident, reported regaining full movement after bathing her arm in the spring. Simultaneously, she went into labor and had to leave almost immediately to give birth. She gave an account of these events to local physician Dr. Pierre Romaine Dozous, who began to collect information on healings at the spring. The 13th appearance (2 March) The lady commanded Soubirous: \\"Go, tell the priests to come here in procession and to build a chapel here.\\" Accompanied by her two aunts, Soubirous went to ask Father Peyramale; he forbade her to go to the grotto, and dismissed her. Peyramale had ordered the priests to have nothing to do with the grotto, for it was the general practice of the clergy to discourage religious visionaries. Soubirous was determined and returned with one of the priest's friends to ask again. After Soubirous was questioned before the parish clergy and dismissed, the parish priests could not agree on what course to take. The 14th appearance (3 March) Previously, Father Peyramale had told Soubirous that the requests for the procession and chapel could not be fulfilled unless and until the lady's name was known. On this occasion, Soubirous asked for the lady's name; according to Soubirous, the lady only smiled. The 15th appearance (4 March) Over 9,000 people were present. The 16th appearance (25 March) Our Lady of Lourdes: Mary appearing at Lourdes with rosary beads. The words on her halo are: (I am the Immaculate Conception).University of Notre Dame: A Cave of Candles: The Story behind the Notre Dame Grotto. Retrieved on 24 September 2006. Peyramale decided to go to Tarbes to visit the bishop. The bishop determined that Peyramale should remain away from the grotto. April 1858 The 17th appearance (7 April) Dr. Pierre Romaine Dozous, the town physician, originally watched the apparitions from a skeptical viewpoint. He believed Soubirous, whom he knew well, was in her right mind aside from the apparitions. He reported: On 8 June 1858, the mayor of Lourdes barricaded the grotto and stationed guards to prevent public access. Visitors were fined for kneeling near the grotto or talking about the grotto. July 1858  The 18th appearance (16 July)  This was the final appearance. Because the grotto was barricaded by the local government, Soubirous knelt outside the fence by the riverbank. \\"I thought I was at the Grotto, at the same distance as I was the other times. All I saw was Our Lady ... She was more beautiful than ever.\\"  Later developments  The grotto reopened to the public in October 1858 by order of Emperor Louis Napoleon III. Soubirous received no further apparitions after the 18th appearance (on 16 July 1858), and she did not feel any desire to visit the grotto afterwards. The people, however, kept on visiting. In 1866, Soubirous left Lourdes to join a religious order. Several churches were eventually built at Lourdes, including the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes and the Basilica of St. Pius X. Soubirous was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church in 1933. Her Feast Day is celebrated on April 16; in France and Canada, it is celebrated on February 18.

In June 2009, the theater was designated as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument. In early 2019, the theater moved to a new permanent home at 4949 York Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90042. History Bob Baker (1924‚Äì2014) was an American puppeteer whose marionettes have entertained thousands of children and adults worldwide for more than 70 years. At age eight, Baker trained with several different Los Angeles-based companies before giving his first professional performance for director Mervyn LeRoy. While attending Hollywood High School, he began manufacturing toy marionettes that sold both in Europe and the United States. After graduation he became an apprentice at the George Pal Animation Studios. A year later he was promoted to head animator of Puppetoons. After World War II, Baker served as an animation advisor at many film studios, including Disney. His puppetry was featured on TV in Bewitched, Star Trek, Land of the Giants and NCIS; and on film in the 1944 movie Bluebeard, in A Star Is Born, G.I. Blues, Disney's Bedknobs and Broomsticks and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Baker was also instrumental in championing union membership for puppeteers. As a result, Screen Actors Guild and AFTRA now recognize puppeteers as actors with a special skill. He has also provided a place of learning for the next generation of puppeteers, including Scott Land and Michael Earl. Baker and partner Alton Wood turned a run-down scenic shop near downtown Los Angeles into a family entertainment institution: The Bob Baker Marionette Theater. The Bob Baker Marionettes have performed around the globe (even on Navy ships and submarines), with an inventory of nearly three thousand puppets. Like Bil Baird before him, Bob Baker is an American pioneer in the art of puppetry. The theater was built in 1953. It is a one-story commercial building of modern Vernacular architecture. The theater is believed to have been built as a workshop for Academy Award-winning special effects artist M.B. Paul. In 1961, Baker and Alton Wood purchased the property for use as a live puppet theater and permanent showcase for hand-crafted marionettes. The Bob Baker Marionette Theater is reportedly the longest-running puppet theater in the United States. During the June 2009 Los Angeles City Council meeting at which the theater received its historic monument designation, Baker's marionettes made an appearance. The Los Angeles Times described the scene:L.A. marionette theater granted landmark status Los Angeles Times, June 3, 2009 Puppeteer Bob Baker died on November 28, 2014 of natural causes. He was 90. Current In 2019, The Bob Baker Marionette Theater gained 501(c)3 non-profit status, and relocated from the historic Downtown Los Angeles location, into a 1920's silent movie theater in Highland Park. Inspired by Bob Baker's original renderings, the new space has been transformed into \\"The Place Where Imagination Dwells\\". In addition to hosting their BBMT productions, Bob Baker Marionette Theater houses El Cine, a non profit promoting Latinx culture through film. BBMT and El Cine frequently collaborate with local, mobile movie screening clubs, including La Collectionneuse(franco- centric club). These events will often include a Marionette show and movie screening. Sometimes they will include speakers, musicians, and receptions with drinks and discourse after.

The bombing occurred during Operation Allied Force, a NATO operation against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) allegedly aimed at forcing the FRY government to end the repression of Albanians in Kosovo and Metohija. The campaign had begun by attacking mainly military targets, but by mid-April the emphasis had changed to strategic and economic targets such as transport links, particularly major bridges. Events The bombing occurred at about 11.40 hours local time. An AGM-130 missile precision-guided munition released by a US F-15E Strike Eagle struck the centre of the bridge at the exact moment that the No. 393 passenger train, en route from Belgrade to Ristovac, was crossing the bridge. The missile struck the train, causing major damage, but did not destroy the bridge.Elmer Schm√§hling, \\"More or Less Exposed Non-combatants and Civilian Objects under the conditions of 'Modern Warfare'\\", in Mathematics and War (ed. Jens H√∏yrup, Bernhelm Booss), p. 287. Birkh√§user, 2003. According to General Wesley Clark, who was the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) at the time, the train had been traveling too fast and the bomb was too close to the target for it to divert in time. The first missile had been fired from a significant distance from the target, and the pilot was allegedly not able to recognize the train visually. Realizing that the train had been hit but believing that he could still complete the mission by striking the end of the bridge where the train had already passed, the pilot then made another pass and fired a second missile. This one too hit the train. Clark described the second hit as an \\"uncanny accident\\" in which the train had continued moving into the target area, obscured by dust and smoke from the first strike,Press Conference by Jamie Shea and General Wesley Clark, 13 April 1999. stating that the pilot allegedly had had less than one second to react. A gun camera video was released by NATO to support its version of the events. Future controversy occurred when it was discovered that released video was sped up 4.7 times. Controversy Monument to the victims The incident caused an immediate controversy in Serbia and abroad. The Yugoslav state news agency Tanjug released an editorial that accused NATO of performing the attack with the aim of \\"inflicting suffering on and destroying the Serbian people\\". In a press conference the day after the attack, General Clark stated that \\"it was an unfortunate incident which he, and the crew, and all of us very much regret\\" and \\"it is one of those regrettable things that happen in a campaign like this and we are all very sorry for it, but we are doing the absolute best we can do to avoid collateral damage.\\" The U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense, John Hamre, told the United States Congress a few months later that \\"We never wanted to destroy that train or kill its occupants. We did want to destroy the bridge and we regret this accident.\\"Statement of the Honorable John J. Hamre, Deputy Secretary of Defense. Before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. 22 July 1999. The German Frankfurter Rundschau prompted a further controversy during January 2000, when it reported that the NATO video had been shown at three times its real speed, giving a misleading impression of the train's speed. The Pentagon and NATO stated that the error had been the result of the video being speeded up for battle damage assessment purposes, but not being slowed again for the press conference.\\"DefenseLink News Transcript: DoD News Briefing ‚Äì Mr. Crowley, PDASD PA and RADM Quigley, DASD PA, 6 January 2000. Later investigation by Frankfurter Rundschau asserted that the video was sped up 4.7 times. Legal issues The Yugoslav government and some Western groups characterised the attack as a \\"crime\\". Other human rights organisations criticised the way that the attack had been continued after the train had been struck by the first strike. Amnesty International argued that the attack should have been stopped when the train had been struck, and that the second bombing had violated the principle of proportionality. In a post- war report, Amnesty stated that the incident :\\"appears to have violated Article 57 of Protocol I which requires an attack to 'be cancelled or suspended if it becomes clear that the objective is a not a military one ... or that the attack may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life... which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.' \\"Amnesty International, NATO/Federal Republic of Yugoslavia: \\"Collateral damage\\" or unlawful killings\\", 7 May 2000. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) established a committee during May 1999 to determine whether offences against international law had been committed during the NATO campaign. In its final report to the tribunal's Prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, the committee took the view that the attack had been proportionate: :\\"It is the opinion of the committee that the bridge was a legitimate military objective. The passenger train was not deliberately targeted. The person controlling the bombs, pilot or WSO, targeted the bridge and, over a very short period of time, failed to recognize the arrival of the train while the first bomb was in flight. The train was on the bridge when the bridge was targeted a second time and the bridge length has been estimated at 50 meters ... It is the opinion of the committee that the information in relation to the attack with the first bomb does not provide a sufficient basis to initiate an investigation.\\"\\"Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, 13 June 2000. The committee was divided over the question of whether the aircrew had behaved recklessly. It recommended nonetheless \\"that the attack on the train at Grdelica Gorge should not be investigated by the [Prosecutor].\\" A.P.V. Rogers comments that the committee \\"must have considered the first missile strike to be a legitimate action against a military objective, the inference being that any civilian casualties of that strike were not disproportionate, and that the firing of the second missile was an error of judgment in the heat of the moment.\\"A.P.V.

He became friends with , August Macke, Wilhelm Wieger, Franz Marc and Paul Klee during this time. He was a member of the Der Blaue Reiter group from 1911 to 1912. When the Nazi regime came to power in 1933, he was among the many modernists condemned as degenerate artists, and prohibited from exhibiting. He moved to the Netherlands, where he spent the rest of his life working at the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam, first teaching Decorative Art, printmaking and stained-glass, then as the Academy Director. He died as a naturalized Dutchman on 9 May 1957 in Amsterdam.

He was a trustee of the American Museum of Natural History and a major benefactor of its Department of Paleontology, which in 1916 began a long partnership with him. He established its Frick Laboratory. He also made many expeditions to the American West, and his efforts helped to shape an understanding of the evolution of North American camels. By employing many field workers, Frick accumulated over 200,000 fossil mammals, which later were donated to the Museum.  Biography  Frick was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of the coke and steel magnate Henry Clay Frick (1849-1919) and Adelaide Howard Childs. He grew up at the family's Pittsburgh estate, Clayton, although the family later moved in 1905 to New York City. He developed his lifelong love for animals playing in the wooded grounds and steep hills behind Clayton, later dedicated as Frick Park. He attended Shady Side Academy in Pittsburgh and graduated from Princeton University in 1905, where he was a member of Colonial Club.Bric a Brac Yearbook, Princeton University, 1904. In 1913, Frick married Frances Shoemaker Dixon (1892-1953) of Baltimore, Maryland. The couple had four children: Adelaide, Frances, Martha Howard (Marsie), and Henry Clay II. As a gift, Frick's father purchased a Georgian-style mansion in Roslyn Harbor, New York, on land that originally belonged to the poet William Cullen Bryant. The couple lived at the estate, named \\"Clayton\\" after his childhood home, for more than 50 years. Henry Clay Frick famously played favorites with his two surviving children, Childs and Helen Clay Frick (1888-1984). After the reading of their father's will, which favored Helen, the two siblings were estranged for the rest of their lives. Childs Frick died of a heart attack at age 81 in Roslyn. He is interred alongside his wife and parents in the Frick family plot at Pittsburgh's Homewood Cemetery. In 1969, Frick's Roslyn Harbor estate was purchased by Nassau County for the purpose of conversion into the Nassau County Museum of Art.

Life Blanche d'Antigny was born Marie Ernestine Antigny in Martizay, France. Her father, Jean Antigny, was the sacristan at a local church. At age 14 she ran off to Bucharest with a lover whom she then abandoned for some gypsies. On her return to Paris she worked in the circus and in various dance halls. She also posed for Paul Baudry for his painting The Penitent Madeleine. She became the mistress of the Russian police chief Mesentzov who took her to St. Petersburg and, when she was forced to leave Russia by special order of the Tsarina. When she set it into her head to become a star on the operetta stage, everything happened exactly as Zola later described it in Nana: She was an immediate success on the stage and attracted scores of wealthy lovers. Herv√© brought her out as Fr√©d√©gonde in Chilp√©ric (1868), and he went on stage \\\\to play Faust to her Marguerite in his masterpiece Le petit Faust (1869), a brilliant parody of both Goethe's play and Gounod's opera.* Blanche d'Antigny played the leading roles in many of the hits of Herv√©, Offenbach, and their disciples (', L'≈ìil crev√©, La Vie parisienne, ', etc. etc.) between 1870 and 1873. Her lovers showered her with gifts and spent enormous sums of money on her, but she was unable to hold on to any of it. After a scandal caused by the financial ruin of one of her lovers, she thought it better to leave Paris for a while. She went to Egypt where she appeared on the stage in Cairo and had an affair with the Khedive. When she was asked why she had taken along to Cairo not only her chambermaid but also her coachman, although she had neither horses nor a coach there, she is reported to have answered: What the hell! I owe Augustine 20,000 francs, and Justin 35,000; they wouldn't let me go without them! She returned from this tour infected with typhoid fever and died.

The castle was originally a motte-and-bailey castle, but this was replaced in the 13th century by one with buildings around a courtyard whose exterior wall was the curtain wall of the inner bailey. As a castle of the Welsh Marches, it was built on the border of Wales and England very close to the historic fort of Old Oswestry. Whittington Castle resides on a property in the village of Whittington, in the district of North Shropshire, in the county of Shropshire in England. It abuts Castle Road. In 2003, a historical and archaeological investigation by Peter Brown and Peter King identified that the outer bailey of the castle had been two elaborate gardens and surrounded by water in the 14th century. This discovery was significant in that it proved the advanced state (as compared to those of the French or Flemish) of English gardening habits. The \\"lavish\\" garden was installed by one of the FitzWarin family. The viewing mound in the centre may be the oldest of its type yet discovered in England.Brown, King and Remfry, pp. 114‚Äì5.  History  Whittington Castle c.1778 Whittington lies on the English side of Offa's Dyke, which in this area was the Norman boundary between England and Wales. The castle of Whittington may have begun as a Norman manor house, although there is no evidence for this. The site was fortified as a castle for William Peverel, in 1138, in support of Empress Matilda, the daughter of Henry I against King Stephen, nephew of King Henry I, and claimant to the throne during The Anarchy. In 1149, the lordship of Whittington, like Oswestry, was annexed by Madog ap Maredudd and became part of the Kingdom of Powys until Madog's death in 1160.Brown, King and Remfry, 107-8 In 1165 Henry II conferred the castle on Roger de Powys, to whom he gave funds for its repair in about 1173. Roger was followed by his son Meurig (or Maurice), he was followed by his son Werennoc. A rival claim from Fulk III FitzWarin (who apparently claimed it under the Peverels) was not recognised until 1204, leading him to rebel against King John. FitzWarin was pardoned, and the castle and lordship of Whittington, not including Overton Castle was given to him. The castle then descended in the FitzWarin family, all called Fulk, until the death of Fulk XI in 1420. Gatehouse of Whittington Castle The castle was captured and destroyed by Llywelyn ab Iorwerth of Gwynedd in 1223. It was returned under the peace treaty, and was rebuilt in stone, replacing the tower keep of a motte and bailey with inner bailey with buildings along a curtain wall and five towers on a raised platform surrounded by a moat, beyond which there is an outer gatehouse or barbican.Brown, King and Remfry, pp. 110‚Äì111. For the next forty years, the castle remained in English possession, but was ceded to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in 1267, remaining in Welsh possession until 1276. After the defeat of Llewelyn ap Gruffydd in 1282, the castle became a lordly residence for the FitzWarin family. However, after the death of Fulk VII in 1349, the castle went through a long period when the lords were almost always under age and usually absentees, though some repairs were carried out in about 1402. The lordship was laid waste in 1404 during the rebellion of Owain Glynd≈µr, so that the lordship was worth nothing in 1407. However, the castle was not captured.Brown, King and Remfry, pp. 114‚Äì116. It had been occupied during the minority of Fulk XI by his mother and her new husband William Lord Clinton, during whose time there was a dispute with the people of Oswestry who had cut down oak trees in his woods. When the FitzWarin line died out in 1420, the lordship passed to Fulk XI's sister Elizabeth, who married Richard Hankeford. In 1422, the castle was captured by escalade by William Fitzwaryn (presumably a cousin claiming the castle as heir male) and Richard Laken, but evidently soon restored to Lord Clinton. Their daughter Thomasia married William Bourghchier, thus carrying the FitzWarin peerage into the Bourchier family. Their grandson John Bourchier was made Earl of Bath, but his son John Bourchier, 2nd Earl of Bath exchanged the lordship and castle in 1545 with Henry VIII, for some former monastic estates nearer the main family home in Devon.Brown, King and Remfry, pp. 117‚Äì118. A detailed survey of the castle was made at the time of the exchange. This describes some of the buildings as 'in decay'. The castle itself was probably never inhabited again. It passed through various hands to William Albany, a London merchant taylor, but he and his descendants (from 1750 the Lloyd family of Aston near Oswestry, who still own the castle) lived at Great Fernhill. William's grandson, Francis Albany, fell into debt and sold his wood in Babbinswood to Arthur Kynaston of Shrewsbury, who built a forge at Fernhill, using stone from the castle. In 1632, the Castle Gatehouse was let, the tenant being allowed to take 'freestone out of the castle'. By the time of the English civil war, Whittington Castle was evidently no longer defensible and there is no evidence that it played any role in that war. In 1673, the castle (or rather the gatehouse) was let as a romantic dwelling to one Thomas Lloyd, a London merchant, probably retired. About 1760, one of the towers fell into the moat. This and other parts of the castle were used to make roads, probably including the new turnpike road to Ellesmere in 1776, during the minority of William Lloyd.  Restoration  This photograph of Whittington Castle before its recent renovation was published in Thos D. Murphy's work In Unfamiliar England (1910). The castle fronts onto the old line of the Holyhead Road and was thus noticed by visitors. William Lloyd undertook the restoration of the gatehouse in about 1808, letting it as a farmhouse. This continued to be occupied as a house until the 1990s.Brown, King and Remfry, pp. 120‚Äì122. Whittington Castle is currently owned on a 99-year lease from 2002 by the Whittington Castle Preservation Trust, a rural community formed in December 1998. The trust recently completed a ¬£1.5 million renovation project. Every year the Historia Normannis historical re-enactment group gathers at the castle to re-enact battles that would have happened in the area at that time of year.  Legends  One of the most prominent legends concerning Whittington Castle regards the Marian Chalice, thought by some to be the Holy Grail. According to this legend, Sir Fulk FitzWarin, the great grandson of Payne Peveril and one in the line of guardians of the Grail and King Arthur. A story from the 13th century states that the Grail was kept in a private chapel of the castle when Sir Foulke was there. The coat of arms of Fulk FitzWarin is hung above the castle archway.'The Marian Chalice: The Holy Grail?' Britannia Internet Magazine (2000) accessed 12 June 2007 It is also claimed that the castle formed part of the lordship of a noble Welshman called Tudur Trefor or Tudor Trevor in both the Maelors (that is Maelor Saesneg and Maelor Gymraeg. Though his father Rhys Sais did hold the former, the rest seems to be an invention of Lewis Dwnn in 1846.Brown, King and Remfry, pp. 107‚Äì108.Biography of Tudor Trevor, Lord of Whittington.

Background  On October 18, 1991, the declaration of the Parliament of Azerbaijan restored the country's independence, and, in November 1991, Turkey became the first state to formally recognize it. On December 25, 1991, Israel formally recognized the independence of Azerbaijan, becoming one of the first states to do so, and established diplomatic relations with Azerbaijan on April 7, 1992. During the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Israel funded and provided weapons and artillery to Azerbaijan.https://news.am/eng/news/504144.html According to a 2009 U.S. diplomatic memo, made public through WikiLeaks, Azeri president Ilham Aliyev once compared his country's relationship with Israel to an iceberg: \\"Nine- tenths of it is below the surface.\\" Azerbaijan was visited by David Harris, executive director of the American Jewish Committee, in July 2010, shortly after the visit of Hillary Clinton to Baku. During the reception, Harris said Azerbaijan presented cultural, strategic and political importance. Azerbaijan was visited by John Shapiro, executive director of the American Jewish Committee, in January 2017, shortly after the visit of Benjamin Netanyahu to Baku. During the reception, Shapiro said that constructive partnership between Azerbaijan, US and Israel has a big significance. Visiting Azerbaijan in December 2016 the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: \\"Relations with Azerbaijan are very close. They will be even better after this visit.\\".

Mountain Jews have been living in Azerbaijan for close to 1,500 years; they are the descendants of Persian Jews. During the conquest by the Islamic Caliphate, Arabs settled an allied Jewish tribe in the neighborhoods of Baku; in 1730 Jews were officially allowed to put down roots and own property in Quba. There are also nearly 5,000 Ashkenazi Jews living mostly in Baku. The first Jewish Sochnut school in the Soviet Union was opened in 1982 in Baku, then capital of Azerbaijan SSR. April 2017 marked the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between Israel and Azerbaijan. Congratulatory letter to the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu include:  Recent relations  Israeli‚ÄìAzerbaijani ties have been expanding since the very early 1990s. The strategic relationship included cooperation in trade and security matters, cultural and educational exchanges, etc. Relations entered a new phase in August 1997 during the visit of then the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Baku. Since then Israel has been developing closer ties with Azerbaijan and have helped modernize the Armed Forces of Azerbaijan. Israeli military is said to have been a major provider of battlefield aviation, artillery, antitank, and anti-infantry weaponry to Azerbaijan.Jane's Defence Weekly, October 16, 1996 In 2009, Israeli President Shimon Peres made a visit to Azerbaijan where military relations were expanded further, with the Israeli company Aeronautics Defense Systems Ltd announcing it was going to build a factory in Baku. In 2010, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev issued a decree banning the issue of visas in the country's international airports; foreigners henceforth had to apply for visas at the nearest Azerbaijani consulate. Israel and Turkey were the only two countries whose citizens were unaffected by the new law.Citizens of Turkey and Israel Unaffected by New Visa Issue Law . Vesti.az. November 9, 2010.

Furthermore, Lieberman held Armenia responsible for provoking the conflict in April 2016. A delegation of the World Jewish Congress visited Azerbaijan on September 2016 where during the talks with the Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev emphasis was put on \\"Excellent relations with Jewish community and Israel\\". In December 2016, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu paid an official visit to Baku. During the visit he emphasised that \\"Israel and Azerbaijan enjoy an excellent relationship and warm friendship\\". During the visit Netanyahu visited the Alley of Martyrs and paid tribute to Azerbaijani heroes. He also visited the Ohr Avner Chabad Day School, met with the local Jewish community and gave a speech before students. Press statements made by the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev and the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also showed satisfaction with the bilateral cooperation of two countries. In December 2016, Azerbaijan-Israel intergovernmental agreement on air communication was signed. In March 2017, several regional tours were made by the Israeli envoy to Azerbaijan to deepen economic cooperation in the spheres of economy, agriculture, and tourism. Azerbaijan and Israel abolished double taxation between countries in April 2017. During his speech at the 72nd sessions of UN General Assembly on September 19, 2017, Netanyahu mentioned the expansion of cooperation between the two countries. In January 2019, the State Border Service of Azerbaijan has purchased Sky Striker kamikaze from Israel's Elbit Systems. Azerbaijan became the first foreign buyer of Sky Striker. In the September 2020 Nagorno- Karabakh conflict with Armenia, Azerbaijan has deployed Israeli-made weapons on Armenian targets, and Israel continues to back Azerbaijan in its decades- long territorial dispute with Armenia.  Security relations  Following an October 2001 meeting with Israeli ambassador Eitan Naeh, Azerbaijan's then president Heydar Aliyev declared that the two countries had identical positions in the fight against international terrorism.Itar-TASS News Agency (Moscow), October 22, 2001 Israeli intelligence helps collect human intelligence about what they view as extremist organizations in the region. One of the groups, Hizb ut-Tahrir, which seeks the annihilation of the state of Israel, threatens both Jerusalem and Baku. Hizb ut-Tahrir is suspected of having several hundred members in Azerbaijan, and several members of it were arrested and prosecuted by Azerbaijani authorities.Swietochowski, \\"Azerbaijan: The Hidden Faces of Islam,\\" World Policy Journal, p. 75. In 2008, a plot was foiled to bomb the Israeli Embassy in Baku, which is located in a high-rise building along with the Thai and Japanese embassies. Two Hezbollah militants went on trial for the attempt in May 2009. Local police narrowly averted the potential disaster, which involved placing three or four car bombs around the high-rise complex to carry out the attack. Groups planned the bombing in retaliation for the 2008 assassination in Damascus, Syria of Hezbollah's second in command Imad Mughniyah, which the Lebanese group blamed on Israel. News reports suggested Iran was involved in the plan as well. In 2012, Israel and Azerbaijan signed an agreement according to which state-run Israel Aerospace Industries would sell $1.6 billion in drones and anti-aircraft and missile defense systems to Azerbaijan.Israel signs deal to provide Azerbaijan with $1.6 billion in military equipment. The Washington Post. February 26, 2012. Some analysts consider that both Israel and Azerbaijan see Iran as an existential threat. Azerbaijan fears Iranian Islamist influence, but Iran fears Azerbaijan, too, as up to 18 million Iranians are ethnic Azeris. On the other hand, Azerbaijan has close links with Turkey, and the post-2006 worsening of Israel-Turkey relations may have repercussions on Azerbaijan's relations with Israel. In February 2012, Iran rebuked Azerbaijan for allegedly aiding anti-Iranian activities by Israel's Mossad intelligence agency. A few weeks later Azerbaijan arrested 22 people in a suspected Iranian plot against Israeli and US targets in Azerbaijan. In March 2012, the magazine Foreign Policy reported that the Israeli Air Force may be preparing to use the Sitalchay Military Airbase, located 500 km (340 miles) from the Iranian border, for air strikes against the nuclear program of Iran. Azerbaijan has sought closer relations with the West. There are, however, several inhibiting factors to the closeness of this alliance. One is the great influence of Russia. Another is Azerbaijan's difficulty to withstand pressure from the Muslim world. This pressure is the reason Azerbaijan has yet to open an embassy in Israel and why it has voted against Israel's views in international forums.Gallia Lindenstrauss, Israel-Azerbaijan: Despite the Constraints, a Special Relationship, Institute for National Security Studies, January 2015  Trade relations  Economic cooperation between Israel and Azerbaijan has been growing significantly. As Azerbaijan deregulated its industries and liberalized economy in the early 1990s, Israeli companies penetrated Azerbaijani markets. Many companies have invested in service industry. One example is Bezeq, a major Israeli telecommunication provider. Through a trade contract bid in 1994, Bezeq bought a large share of the telephone operating system. Today it installs phone lines and operates regional services throughout much of the country. Another company, Bakcell, was started as a joint venture between the Ministry of Communication of Azerbaijan and GTIB (Israel)Israel-Azerbaijan Telecommunications Forum in early 1994 as the first cellular telephone operator in the country. Dozens of Israeli companies are active in the Azerbaijani energy sector. For instance, Modcon Systems Ltd., an Israel-based supplier of high technology to the oil and gas industries, opened a branch in Azerbaijan. Between 2000 and 2005, Israel has risen from being Azerbaijan's tenth largest trading partner to its fifth. According to U.N. statistics, between 1997 and 2004, exports from Azerbaijan to Israel increased from barely over US$2 million to $323 million, fueled in recent years by the high price of oil. As of 2013, 40 percent of oil to Israel is exported from Baku, which makes Azerbaijan Israel's largest oil supplier. Azerbaijan and Israel abolished double taxation between countries in April 2017. \\"Defense and energy sectors apart, the bilateral trade between the two countries amounted to $260 million in 2016.\\", ‚Äî said Israeli ambassador to Azerbaijan. According to the State Customs Committee of Azerbaijan, the total trade turnover between Azerbaijan and Israel amounted to $116.2 million in January‚ÄìFebruary 2017, which is 17.5 percent more compared to the same period of 2016.  Energy  Azerbaijan and Israel cooperate closely in the field of energy. Israel buys 40 percent of its oil from Azerbaijan. In a 2007 speech, the Israeli ambassador to Azerbaijan, Arthur Lenk, spoke of a continuous trade between Azerbaijan and Israel in the energy sector. He noted that until the inauguration of the Baku- Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline in 2006, Israel was a key consumer of Azerbaijani oil exports, and that the proximity of Ceyhan to Israel offers excellent new opportunities for greater Israeli participation in this sector of the economy, thus creating additional areas for collaboration and mutual benefit. He underlined that through the Trans-Israel pipeline between Ashkelon and Eilat, Israel could be a strategic partner for marketing Caspian oil to Asia. Israeli efforts in developing alternative energy resources, especially solar energy, were also mentioned. Israel additionally seeks possibilities of importing gas from the Caspian Sea region.Embassy of Israel in Azerbaijan. Ambassador Lenk: ‚ÄúIsrael can be a strategic partner for marketing Caspian oil to Asia‚Äù. Retrieved on 2007-07-12 In December 2016, during his visit to Azerbaijan the Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu said: \\"Today we are negotiating not only for the supply of Azerbaijani oil, but also imports of Azerbaijani gas to Israel\\". Israel imports forty percent of its oil from Azerbaijan.Keinon, Herb. (November 15, 2018). \\"Jewish State appoints Christian envoy to Muslim Country\\". Jerusalem Post website Retrieved 16 November 2018.  Cooperation against Iran  On March 29, 2012, officials said that Israel was granted access to air bases in Azerbaijan through a \\"series of quiet political and military understandings.\\" These airbases could potentially be used in a strike against Iran over its nuclear program and other tensions with Iran, and would be allowed by Azerbaijan. Israeli and Azerbaijani officials denied these reports. On September 30, 2012, it was reported that Azerbaijan and Israel jointly examined the use of Azerbaijani air bases and spy drones to help Israeli jets perform a long-range strike on Iran. This would help Israel in regards to issues with refueling, reconnaissance, and rescuing crews, and could make an attack more feasible. The plan apparently involves using an Israeli tanker aircraft painted in the colors of a third country airline company that would land and refuel in Azerbaijan and then refuel the Israeli strike aircraft.Grove, Thomas. \\"Azerbaijan eyes aiding Israel against Iran.\\" Reuters, September 30, 2012.

A language is at risk of being lost when it no longer is taught to younger generations, while fluent speakers of the language (usually the elderly) die. Basis Language is an important part of any society, because it enables people to communicate and express themselves. When a language dies out, future generations lose a vital part of the culture that is necessary to completely understand it. This makes language a vulnerable aspect of cultural heritage, and it becomes especially important to preserve it. According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), from facts published in their \\"Atlas of Languages in Danger of Disappearing,\\" there are an estimated 7,000 languages spoken worldwide today, and half of the world‚Äôs population speaks the eight most common. More than 3,000 languages are reportedly spoken by fewer than 10,000 people each. Ethnologue, a reference work published by SIL International, has cataloged the world‚Äôs known living languages, and it estimates that 417 languages are on the verge of extinction. Language protection is protection of cultural heritage, as Karl von Habsburg, President of Blue Shield International, states. \\"Today, on average, we lose one language in the world every six weeks. There are approximately 6800 languages. But four percent of the population speaks 96 percent of the languages, and 96 percent of the population speaks four percent of the languages. These four percent are spoken by large language groups and are therefore not at risk. But 96 percent of the languages we know are more or less at risk. You have to treat them like extinct species.\\"Interview with Karl von Habsburg (German) in RP-Online, 18 October 2018. Reasons for language endangerment or extinction There are different factors that can put a language in danger of becoming extinct. One is when a language is no longer being taught to the children of the community, or at least to a large number of the children. In these cases, the remaining fluent speakers of the language are generally the older members of the community, and when they pass on, the language dies out with them. Child speakers are not enough to ensure the survival of a language however. If the children who do speak the language are relocated to another area where it is not spoken, it becomes endangered. Political and military turmoil can also endanger a language. When people are forced from their homes into new lands, they may have to learn the language of the new area to adapt, and they end up losing their language. Likewise, when a country or territory is successfully invaded, the population may be forced to learn the invader's language. A language can also become associated with a lower social class. In this instance, parents will encourage their children to use the language used more often in society to distance themselves from the perceived lower class. Within one or two generations of this occurrence, the language can easily be lost. Importance of preservation When a language dies, the knowledge of and ability to understand the culture who spoke it is threatened because the teachings, customs, oral traditions and other inherited knowledge are no longer transmitted among native speakers. As each language dies, science in linguistics, anthropology, prehistory and psychology lose some diversity in data sources. Ways to preserve a language There are different ideas about the best ways to preserve a language. One way is to encourage younger generations to speak the language as they grow, so they will then teach their children the language as well. In many cases, this option is nearly impossible. There are often many factors that endanger a language, and it is impossible to control each of these factors to ensure its survival. The internet can be used to raise awareness about the issues of language extinction and language preservation. It can be used to translate, catalog, store, and provide information and access to languages. New technologies such as podcasts can be used to preserve the spoken versions of languages, and written documents can preserve information about the native literature and linguistics of languages. The international internet provider VeriSign estimates that 65-70% of all internet content is in English. Using written documents to preserve information about the native literature and linguistics is also not without potential problems. Just because a language is written down, this does not mean it will survive. Written information in book or manuscript form is subject to acid issues, binding problems, environmental monitoring problems, and security concerns. Technology can also be used to preserve the integrity of spoken versions of languages. Many of the same techniques used in recording oral history can be used to preserve spoken languages. Preservationists can use reel-to-reel audio tape recordings, along with video recordings, and new technologies like podcasts to record spoken accounts of languages. Technology is also vulnerable to new technology. Preservation efforts would fail if the technology to listen to or watch certain media such as audio tape recordings or video tapes is lost. The Administration for Native Americans has published the \\"Reference Guide for Establishing Archives and Repositories,\\" which explains why language repositories are vital to long-term language preservation efforts. The guide offers practical advice on what to preserve and why; it explains what a language repository is, how to build one, and the costs involved; and lists other resources for creating an archive and repository.

The state of Illinois put out a call to form units. Six companies came from St. Clair County. Madison County sent three companies. Montgomery county sent one company. All nine companies met at Springfield, Illinois, on 23 April 1861. There they were formed into the 9th Regiment, Illinois, volunteer infantry. There were rumors that the Confederates intended to invade at Cairo, Illinois. In response, orders were issued for the 9th Infantry to occupy Cairo. They arrived and set up camp on 1 May 1861.Marion Morrison, A History of the Ninth Regiment Illinois Volunteer Infantry, with the Regimental Roster (Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1997), p. 9 The first few months were spent on the Mississippi river guarding Cairo.

While they were waiting to join the battle, new orders were given. They were ordered to exchange their gray coats for Union blue. This way they would not be mistaken for Confederate troops. They then joined the battle of Shiloh. They fought most of the day. At Shiloh the 9th Illinois had the highest casualties of any Illinois unit.

He was an important minister during the regime of Seyni Kountch√© and subsequently served as Niger's Ambassador to the United States from 1988 to 1991; later, after founding the ANDP, he served as President of the National Assembly of Niger from 1993 to 1994. He was the ANDP's candidate in four presidential elections, beginning in 1993; he was also a deputy in the National Assembly from 1999 to 2009 and the President of the High Court of Justice from 2005 to 2009. Background His family names, Moumouni Djermakoye, marked him as a descendant--but not heir--of the most powerful ruling dynasty of Djerma society, that of the Djermakoy of Dosso: the first amongst equals of Djerma rulers and a house especially favoured during the colonial period.Samuel Decalo. Historical Dictionary of Niger (3rd ed.). Scarecrow Press, Boston & Folkestone, (1997) pp.35, 125-6, 217-219. Djermakoye entered the military as a young officer, and took part in Seyni Kountch√©'s April 1974 coup which overthrew President Hamani Diori. He became a key member of the ruling council, and developed a personal power base in Dosso. Service as a minister and diplomat during military rule (1974-1991) Following the 1974 coup, Djermakoye served as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation from April 22, 1974 to September 10, 1979.\\"GOUVERNEMENTS DU PRESIDENT SEYNI KOUNTCHE\\" , official Nigerien presidency website .

MNSD leadership bid, formation of the ANDP, multiparty elections (1991-1996) In 1991, Djermakoye was defeated by Tandja Mamadou in a bid to become leader of the National Movement for the Development of Society (MNSD). This struggle was marked by a question of ethnicity: Djermakoye, who was a member of the dominant ethnic group in the party (the Djerma), lost to Tandja, who was not. After his defeat, he formed a group called the Club of Moumouni Adamou Djermokoye's Friends (CAMAD), which later became the ANDP.Jibrin Ibrahim and Abdoulayi Niandou Souley, \\"The rise to power of an opposition party: the MNSD in Niger Republic\\", Unisa Press, Politeia, Vol. 15, No. 3, 1996. In February 1993, Djermakoye stood as the ANDP candidate in the first round of the 1993 presidential election and placed fourth with 15.24% of the vote.Elections in Niger, African Elections Database. As part of a coalition called the Alliance of the Forces of Change, Djermakoye backed Mahamane Ousmane of the Democratic and Social Convention (CDS) in the second round of the election against Tandja of the MNSD, and Ousmane was victorious. In the February 1993 parliamentary election, the ANDP won 11 out of 83 seats in the National Assembly, performing well among the Zarma; Djermakoye himself was elected to the National Assembly\\"Afrique de l'Ouest - Niger - Cour supr√™me - 1993 - Arr√™t no 93-10/cc du 18 mars 1993\\" , droit.francophonie.org . as an ANDP candidate in Dosso constituency.\\"Afrique de l'Ouest - Niger - Cour supr√™me - 1993 - Arr√™t no 93-3/cc du 1er f√©vrier 1993\\" , droit.francophonie.org .

He remained President of the National Assembly until October 1994, when the National Assembly was dissolved ahead of a new parliamentary election. Under the Ma√Ønassara regime and transitional military rule (1996-1999) After the military, led by Ibrahim Bar√© Ma√Ønassara, seized power in January 1996, a new presidential election was held in July 1996, in which Djermakoye took fifth place with 4.77% of the vote. On the second day of the election, which was won by Ma√Ønassara, Djermakoye was placed under house arrest along with the three other opposition candidates, and he remained under house arrest for two weeks.\\"Niger: A major step backwards\\" , Amnesty International, 16 October 1996.

Reacting to President Tandja's controversial efforts to call a referendum on a new constitution that would allow him to run for re-election--efforts that were opposed by both opposition parties and members of the presidential majority coalition--Djermakoye expressed disapproval, saying that the nation could be \\"split in two\\" by Tandja's referendum plans. After the Constitutional Court ruled against Tandja on 25 May 2009, Tandja promptly dissolved the National Assembly on 26 May.

The neighbouring nations had formal governmental relations between 1918 and 1921, during their brief independence from the collapsed Russian Empire, as the First Republic of Armenia and the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan; these relations existed from the period after the Russian Revolution until they were occupied and annexed by the Soviet Union. Due to the two wars waged by the countries in the past century‚Äîone from 1918 to 1921 and another from 1988 to 1994‚Äîthe two have had strained relations. In the wake of ongoing hostilities, social memory of Soviet-era cohabitation is widely repressed (censored and stigmatised). History Relations between 1918 and 1921 Upon the disintegration of the Transcaucasian Federation with the proclamation of the independent Democratic Republic of Georgia on May 26, 1918, both Azerbaijan and Armenia proclaimed their independence on the same day, May 28, 1918. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan laid claim to territory which they saw as historically and ethnically theirs; these territorial disputes led to the Armenian‚ÄìAzerbaijani War between 1918 and 1920, a series of conflicts that ended only when both Armenia and Azerbaijan were annexed by the Soviet Union. Soviet period (1922‚Äì91) Upon the establishment of USSR in 1922, Azerbaijan SSR and Armenian SSR became constituent states, initially as a part of Transcaucasian SFSR, and from 1936 as separate entities. The relations between the two nations, including in Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO), were generally peaceful and friendly whilst all Soviet entities. Though occasional confrontations did occur, particularly the 1948 and the 1964 public protests in Armenia which resulted in exodus of a large number of Azeris, they remained unknown to a broader public due to strict Soviet censorship. Karabakh War In 1988, the Armenians of Karabakh voted to secede and join Armenia. This was met by pogroms of Armenians chiefly in three cities of Azerbaijan: Sumgait, Baku, Kirovabad and led to the military conflict that became known as the Nagorno-Karabakh War. The war resulted in de facto Armenian occupation of former NKAO and seven surrounding Azerbaijani zones of similar combined area and was effectively halted when both sides agreed to observe a cease-fire, which has been in effect since May 1994. In late 1995, both also agreed to mediation of the OSCE Minsk Group. The Minsk Group is currently co-chaired by the US, France, and Russia and comprises Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and several Western European nations. During the conflict the largest city Stepanakert was besieged by Azerbaijani forces from late 1991 to May 1992 whereby its Armenians were bombarded, civilian and armed.The Daily Telegraph, Azeri jets bomb capital of enclave - Aug 23, 1992Bloodshed in the Caucasus: escalation of the armed conflict in Nagorno Karabakh.

Azerbaijan blockaded all essential supplies, including water, electricity, food and medicines causing many deaths. Human Rights Watch reported that key bases used by forces for bombardment were the towns of Khojaly and Shusha.Bloodshed in the Caucasus: escalation of the armed conflict in Nagorno Karabakh. 1992, page 12; 34 Amid this the Khojaly massacre occurred which was the mass murder of at least 161 ethnic Azerbaijanis of Khojaly on 26 February 1992. According to Human Rights Watch, the tragedy struck when \\"a large column of residents, accompanied by a few dozen retreating fighters, fled the city as it fell to Armenian forces.

In 2008, in what became known as the 2008 Mardakert Skirmishes, Armenia and Azerbaijan clashed over Nagorno-Karabakh. The fighting between the two sides was brief, with few casualties on either side. June 2010 saw a brief flare up of the conflict, resulting in the deaths of four Armenian soldiers and one Azeri soldier. The clash came a day after peace talks between the Presidents of the two nations held in Moscow. On August 31, 2010, a border clash killed three Armenians and two Azeris. The Armenian army claimed up to seven Azeris had been killed. Both sides blamed the other for the incident. This preceded another incident on September 4 in which two Azerbaijani soldiers were killed and one Armenian wounded. On June 24, 2011, the two sides met in Kazan, Russia, to negotiate an end to the Nagorno-Karabakh issue, but the talks ended in failure. Following the breakdown of talks, the Azeri President Ilham Aliyev used the June 26 Salvation Day military parade to warn Armenia that Azerbaijan may retake Nagorno-Karabakh by force. On 5 October 2011, border clashes around Nagorno Karabakh left one Armenian soldier and two Azeris dead. Two Armenians were also wounded by sniper fire the same day. Another violent incident occurred on 5 June 2012 when, according to the Azerbaijani side, Armenian troops crossed the border and shot dead five Azerbaijani soldiers before withdrawing. Armenia denied the claim and accused Azerbaijan of crossing the border first. In October 2013, Zakir Hasanov was appointed as Azerbaijani Defence Minister despite controversy. 2016 clashes Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan meet with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev in Davos, Switzerland, January 2019 After the 2016 Armenian‚ÄìAzerbaijani clashes, in which an estimated 350 troops and civilians from both sides were killed, Azerbaijan declared a unilateral cease fire (the clashes started when Azerbaijani forces launched strikes to regain control of territory controlled by the Armenia-backed breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh).  Fighting in 2020  Both sides clashed weaponry on the Armenia‚ÄìAzerbaijan border: Tavush and Tovuz (respectively) from 12 until 18 July 2020. Involved were artillery, tanks and shock drones and killed were at least 17 soldiers and a civilian. Many more were injured. Both sides reported four commanding or junior officer-rank army deaths, an Azeri being a major general. On 27 September 2020, heavy fighting along the line of contact between locally based Armenian and Azeri troops resumed. Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh (or the de facto territory of Artsakh), and Azerbaijan declaring martial law and mobilising new and existing conscripts and professional soldiers. On October 9, 2020, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet appealed for an urgent ceasefire, citing civilian sufferings in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict zone. She also raised concerns over populated areas that were becoming a target to the heavy weaponry attacks. On October 17th a new ceasefire agreement was announced by the Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers following phone calls between Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and his counterparts. Lavrov strongly urged the countries to abide by the Moscow deal.

Background of the MPCI and the Civil War During the Civil War, the MPCI was referred to as the political wing of the rebel movement, with the Forces Nouvelles de C√¥te d'Ivoire as its armed wing. Led by northerner Guillaume Soro Kigbafori, who began his political career with the Student Federation of Cote d‚ÄôIvoire (FESCI) which was closely allied to the then opposition Ivorian Popular Front (FPI). The MPCI also counts in its ranks Louis Dacoury Tabley, formerly the director of the FPI at the time of its foundation. Though essentially a northern party, the MPCI has representatives from across C√¥te d'Ivoire. During the civil war, the MPCI leaders commanded some 10,000 soldiers (of which 450 came from the Ivorian Army), and controlled 40% of the country (An addition 20% was controlled by allied rebels in the west). The party itself was formed in October 2002, following the army rebellion of 19 September 2002. The MPCI leaders cite the concept of \\"ivoirit√©\\", which former president H.K B√©di√© helped introduced into the political discourse in the 1990s, as a divisive factor which prompted their rebellion. Creation of FN Political Coalition The Forces Nouvelles de C√¥te d'Ivoire (New Forces: FNCI or FN) was formed in December 2002 in the wake of the first peace accords. FN includes these political parties: *Patriotic Movement of C√¥te d'Ivoire (Mouvement patriotique de C√¥te d'Ivoire, MPCI) *Ivorian Popular Movement of the Great West (Mouvement populaire ivoirien du Grand Ouest, MPIGO) *Movement for Justice and Peace (Mouvement pour la justice et la paix, MJP) While the political coalition under which these parties operate is formally called the Forces Nouvelles de C√¥te d'Ivoire, in fact the MJP has folded into the MPCI, and the MPCI stands in for the coalition itself. There is no active FNCI organization independent of the MPCI as of 2007. The phrase Forces Nouvelles remains a shorthand for the rebel side in the civil war.

A system of hard spheres, interacting only by hard collisions (e.g., billiards, marbles), is a model classical fluid. Such a system is well described by the Percus‚ÄìYevik equation. Common liquids, e.g., liquid air, gasoline etc., are essentially mixtures of classical fluids. Electrolytes, molten salts, salts dissolved in water, are classical charged fluids. A classical fluid when cooled undergoes a freezing transition. On heating it undergoes an evaporation transition and becomes a classical gas that obeys Boltzmann statistics. A system of charged classical particles moving in a uniform positive neutralizing background is known as a one-component plasma (OCP). This is well described by the Hyper-netted chain equation (see CHNC). An essentially very accurate way of determining the properties of classical fluids is provided by the method of molecular dynamics. An electron gas confined in a metal is not a classical fluid, whereas a very high-temperature plasma of electrons could behave as a classical fluid. Such non-classical Fermi systems, i.e., quantum fluids, can be studied using quantum Monte Carlo methods, Feynman path integral equation methods, and approximately via CHNC integral-equation methods.

The gardens are famous for providing the inspiration for The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett. House Gatehouse The original name of the Manor here was Great Maytham. In 1721 James Monypenny built a house here which he called Maytham Hall. This was completed by his son Robert Monypenny in 1760 but was largely burned down in 1893. This house consisted of a main block of two storeys and basement and two pavilions containing the laundry and stables. These 18th-century wings largely survive, but the main building was rebuilt two storeys higher by Sir Edwin Lutyens in 1909‚Äì12 for The Right Honourable H. J. Tennant, a prominent Liberal Member of Parliament, who reverted to the use of the original name, Great Maytham. The house briefly became the home of the Royal Normal College for the Blind after the college was advised to move from its London site at the outbreak of World War II. However, because of the threat of a German invasion, the authorities soon advised another move, and this time, with 24 hours' notice and the help of the London Society for the Blind, a temporary home was found for the college in Dorton, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. The college's London campus was bombed during the Blitz and it is now located in Hereford. The house and grounds fell into decline before World War II. In 1965 Great Maytham Hall was purchased and restored by the Mutual Households Association, later the Country Houses Association, a charity dedicated to saving and preserving historic stately homes. The house was converted into fifteen flats, with residents sharing the reception rooms, entrance hall and drawing room; its first residents then set about restoring the gardens and grounds. In December 2003 the Country Houses Association announced that it was closing down its residential business and selling the eight Grade I and II listed buildings it owned. Gardens Great Maytham Hall Garden The walled garden of Great Maytham Hall provided the inspiration for one of the most famous of all books for children, The Secret Garden. Its author, Frances Hodgson Burnett, lived at Great Maytham Hall from 1898 to 1907, where she found the old walled garden dating from 1721 sadly overgrown and neglected.Its previous owner, Miss Monypenny, the daughter of Thomas Gybbon Monypeny (DNB s.v. \\"Thomas Lyte\\", whose portrait was at Maytham), was the last of a family long in possession of the house. Aided by a robin, Burnett discovered the door hidden amongst the ivy, and began the restoration of the garden, which she planted with hundreds of roses. She set up a table and chair in the gazebo, and dressed always in a white dress and large hat, she wrote a number of books in the peace and tranquillity of her scented secret garden. When Lutyens rebuilt Great Maytham Hall he retained the old walled garden as an adjunct to the grand new brick house in the manner of Sir Christopher Wren, but landscaped the terraced lawns and surrounding parkland in his signature style, in partnership with Gertrude Jekyll, who planted his design. The gardens and grounds were well cared for by the Tennants until the outbreak of the Second World War, when the house was requisitioned by the army. As part of the \\"Dig for Victory\\" campaign, Frances Hodgson Burnett's beautiful roses were replaced with cabbages and leeks, and the manicured lawns were patriotically planted with potatoes and carrots. A jettisoned German bomb in the middle of the former lawn did not help to improve matters, and after the war the house stood empty for many years, and the gardens were left to decline.

The name Salvation Jane originated from, and is mostly used in, South Australia due to its use as a source of food for grazing animals when the less drought-tolerant grazing pastures die off. Other names are blueweed, Lady Campbell weed, Riverina bluebell, and purple viper's bugloss. Three other Echium species have been introduced and are of concern; viper's bugloss (Echium vulgare) is the most common of them. Viper's bugloss is biennial, with a single unbranched flowering stem and smaller, more blue flowers, but is otherwise similar. This species is also useful for honey production. Paterson's curse has positive uses; as a fodder plant, with proper handling, it can be valuable fodder over summer for cattle and sheep, but not livestock without ruminant digestive systems. History In the 1880s, it was introduced to Australia, probably both as an accidental contaminant of pasture seed and as an ornamental plant. Reportedly, both names for the plant derive from Jane Paterson or Patterson, an early settler of the country near Albury. She brought the first seeds from Europe to beautify a garden, and then could only watch helplessly as the weed infested previously productive pastures for many miles around. Paterson's curse is now a dominant broadleaf pasture weed through much of New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania and also infests native grasslands, heathlands, and woodlands. Description E. plantagineum flowers in spring, growing adjacent to the freeway at Crafers, South Australia. Appearance The plant has hairy, dark green, broadly oval rosette leaves to 30 cm long. The several seeding stems grow to 120 cm in height and develop branches with age. Flowers develop in clusters; they are purple, tubular and 2‚Äì3 cm long with five petals. It has a fleshy taproot with smaller laterals. Growth Although generally an autumn-germinating, spring-flowering annual, Paterson's curse has become highly adaptable to Australian erratic rainfall events, and given suitable rainfall, some plants germinate at any time of year, but the plant never survives for more than one year. It is a very prolific seed producer; heavy infestations can yield up to 30 000 seeds/m2. Paterson's curse can germinate under a wide variety of temperature conditions, tolerates dry periods well, and responds vigorously to fertiliser. If cut by a lawnmower, it quickly recovers and sends out new shoots and flowers. The plant disperses by movement of seeds -- on the wool or fur of animals, the alimentary tracts of grazing animals or birds, movement in water, and most importantly as a contaminant of hay or grain. This is most noticeable in times of drought, when considerable movement of fodder and livestock occurs. It can rapidly establish a large population on disturbed ground and competes vigorously with both smaller plants and the seedlings of regenerating overstorey species. Its spread has been greatly aided by human-induced habitat degradation, particularly the removal of perennial grasses through overgrazing by sheep and cattle and the introduction of the rabbit. Paterson's curse is rarely able to establish itself in habitats where the native vegetation is healthy and undisturbed. Control Chemical Control of the plant is carried out by hand (for small infestations) or with any of a variety of herbicides, and must be continued over many years to reduce the seedbank. (Most seeds germinate in the first year, but some survive for as long as five years before germinating.) In the longer term, perennial grasses (which do not need to regenerate from seed each year) can outcompete Paterson's curse, and any increase in perennial cover produces a direct decrease in it. However, the annual cost in control measures and lost production in Australia was estimated (in a 1985 study by the Industries Assistance Commission) to be over $30 million, compared to $2 million per year in benefits. Biological The Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) has carried out research on numerous classical biological control solutions, and of the 100-odd insects found feeding on Paterson's curse in the Mediterranean, judged six safe to release in Australia without endangering crops or native plants. The leaf-mining moth Dialectica scalariella, the crown weevil Mogulones larvatus, root weevil Mogulones geographicus, and flea beetle Longitarsus echii are now currently widely distributed in southern Australia and can be found easily on most large Paterson's curse plants encountered. The crown weevil and flea beetle are proving highly effective. While the CSIRO is cautiously optimistic, biological control agents are expected to take many years to be fully effective. The most recent economic analysis, however, suggests that biological control has already brought nearly $1.2 B in benefits to Australia by reducing the amount of Paterson's curse in pastures. Investment into the biological control of Paterson's curse has already reaped a benefit cost ratio of 52:1.http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3724759 Toxicity E. plantagineum contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids and is poisonous.

Despite thematic similarities, this story is not to be confused with the Carl Barks story King Scrooge the First. Plot Scrooge McDuck accidentally finds a brass plaque on the site of his Money Bin. The plaque was originally made by Sir Francis Drake, who claimed the entire hill as property of the Queen of England back in 1579. Later, in the early 19th century, the English built a fort there. However, a war with Spain caused England to abandon the fort, giving it away to the nearest non-English person found, who just happened to be Cornelius Coot. Coot, the sole person present at the fort, drove the Spanish away with a clever plot, and continued to maintain the fort. Later, of course, Scrooge's Money Bin was erected in its place. Scrooge finds out that the hill his Money Bin stands on was never actually part of the United States of America, so he jumps at the chance to claim sovereignty and collect tax refunds from Duckburg. To retaliate, Duckburg imposes strict restrictions on inter-country travel, with Scrooge's own employees having to show their passports just to come to work. A crafty villain shows up with the Beagle Boys, attempting to conquer Scrooge's own private country, initially succeeding, but Scrooge eventually fends him off. Finally, the mayor of Duckburg tells Scrooge that his tax refunds would be so large that they would bankrupt the entire city. Scrooge does not seem to care, but he \\"accidentally\\" destroys the deed that Coot signed, and irritably informs his nephews that he melted down Drake's plaque to make his crown, with materials being expensive. In the end, it turns out that this was no accident. Scrooge still has the plaque, but chooses to keep it secret, indicating that he destroyed the grant on purpose, from the good of his heart: He could not bring himself to bankrupt Duckburg, yet had to save face before his nephews who must not think of him as \\"soft.\\" Cultural references * The panel in which Cornelius Coot's journal is removed from a vault in the Coot Library for reading is a direct homage to a scene from Citizen Kane. * Don Rosa has stated he got the plot from Passport to Pimlico. * McDuck regains his throne and country from the usurper by defeating him in a sword duel.

It occurs in the eastern United States, primarily in the Appalachian Mountains, though it is also present in southeastern Canada, but only in about 25 populations in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. In the U.S. it is abundant and common, but in Canada it is considered threatened due to its restricted distribution. It can be found in dry open woods as well as along wood-edges and clearings. The species is distinguished by its flower heads that have yellow centers and white rays that are arranged in flat-topped corymbiform arrays, emerging in the late summer through fall. Other distinguishing characteristics include its serpentine stems and sharply serrated narrow heart-shaped leaves. The white wood aster is sometimes used in cultivation in both North America and Europe due to it being quite tough and for its showy flowers. Description Eurybia divaricata is a late summer to fall-flowering herbaceous perennial, typically growing to heights between 30 and 90 cm, though some specimens may be up to tall. The plant emerges each year from rhizomes and forms dense colonies of clones that lack sterile rosettes. The rhizomes are branched, elongated and become woody with age. One simple erect stem is present per plant. It is flexible and nearly hairless to finely hairy near the base, though densely covered with fine hair towards the extremities. It is very similar to and often confused with E. chlorolepis, E. schreberi and Symphyotrichum cordifolium, though E. schreberi differs in having wider leaves with more teeth, while E. chlorolepis has more rays, longer involucres, and only occurs in the southern U.S. from Virginia to Georgia. Three types of leaves with differing morphology are present: cauline leaves, or those that appear on the stem from the middle of the plant upwards; basal leaves, or those that are present at the base of the plant; and distal leaves, which are those found on the extremities of the plant. All types are thin and sharply serrated with 6 to 15 pointed teeth per side. They are ciliate, meaning they have small hairy projections emerging from the margins of the leaf, while the apices, or tips of the leaves, are acuminate, meaning they taper to a point. The adaxial (i.e. upper) surfaces of the leaves are nearly hairless or sparsely hairy, while the abaxial (i.e. lower) surfaces are sparsely hairy with the veins being more villous, or covered in shaggy hairs. The basal leaves are ovate, or egg- shaped, with bases that are cordate, or heart-shaped. The blades measure 1.9 to 6.5 cm in length by in width and have petioles ranging in length from 2 to 7 cm. They wither when the plant flowers. The cauline leaves have petioles measuring long that are often winged. Their blades are also ovate, though the bases may be cordate to rounded. They measure long by wide, making them often much longer than the basal leaves. The distal leaves are typically sessile, meaning that no petiole is present, though they are sometimes subpetiolate, meaning a very short petiole is present. The blades are ovate to lanceolate, meaning lance-shaped, with rounded bases and are long by wide. The capitula, or flower heads, are arranged in relatively flat-topped corymbiform arrays. The capitula number anywhere from 4 to 50 and up to 100 or more in exceptional cases. The peduncles, i.e. the flower stalks, are up to in length and are densely covered with non-glandular hairs. Bracts, modified leaves that appear at the axil of a peduncle, are typically absent, though in some cases up to two are present. The involucres, which are the whorls of small, scale-like modified leaves that appear at the base of the capitulum, are in between cylindric and campanulate (i.e. bell-shaped) in shape and measure long, making them much shorter than the pappi. line drawingillustration from Britton and Brown's Illustrated flora of the northern states and Canada, 1913, as Aster divaricatus The phyllaries, which are the small leaves that make up the involucre, number from 25 to 30 and are arranged in 4 to 5 series. The inner phyllaries are between linear and lanceolate in shape with a purplish colouration towards the apices, while the outer ones are more oblong. All of the phyllaries are strongly unequal with hardened bases, margins that are somewhat scarious (i.e. thin, membranous and dry) as well as fimbriate- ciliate, meaning fringed with hair at the margins. Their apices are rounded to acute in shape, while the surfaces are sparsely haired, though sometimes sparsely covered in stipular glands. Their chlorophyllous zones, a darker green zone where chlorophyll is concentrated, appear on the upper half of the outer phyllaries, to the upper third or along the outer midveins of the inner phyllaries. The outer phyllaries typically measure wide with the lengths rarely exceeding 2.5 times the width. As with most members of the composite family, the actual flowers appear in two different forms: as ray florets, which have strap-like appendages that look like petals and project around the outside of the capitulum, and as disc florets, which appear at the center of the flower head and are very small. The ray florets number between 5 and 10, though as many as 12 may be present. Their straps are white and measure 6 to 12 mm long by 1.5 to 2.2 mm wide. The disc florets number from 12 to 19 and up to 25 and have yellow corollas (i.e. petals, though they are fused into a tube) that are 4.1 to 4.8 and exceptionally 5.5 mm long. Their corollas are abruptly ampliate, or enlarged, with tubes that are longer than their campanulate throats. The tubes measure 2.3 to 2.6 mm while the throats are typically only 0.9 to 1.2 mm long. The lobes, i.e. the friges of the throat, are reflexed and lanceolate in shape, measuring 0.7 to 1.4 mm. The fruit are cypselae, a type of achene, which are brown in colour, slightly compressed and are between cylindric and obovoid, or inversely egg-shaped. They are between in length and sparsely strigillose, or set with stiff bristly hairs, with 7 to 10 ribs, which themselves are tan to stramineous (i.e. straw-coloured). The pappi, which are modified sepals, are made up of reddish to cream-coloured bristles that are long, making them equal to or longer than the disc corollas in length. The bristles are fine and barbellulate, or barb-like, though they may be sometimes more or less clavate, or club-shaped, towards their apices. Similar species Several different plants are superficially quite similar to the white wood aster, but close examination as well as knowledge of the plants' differing habitats and ranges can readily distinguish them. The most similar species is the mountain wood aster (Eurybia chlorolepis), which was previously considered conspecfic with E. divaricata. E. chlorolepis differs in having flower stalks that are longer than 1.5 cm, while those of E. divaricata are shorter than this. The involucres of the mountain wood aster are generally between 6.5 and 9 mm in length, while those of the white wood aster are normally from 4.2 to 6.5 mm long, but in rare cases they may be as long as 7.5 mm. The mountain wood aster almost always has more rays than the white wood aster: the former usually has 12 to 16, but occasionally as few as 10, while the latter generally has 5 to 10 and never more than 12. The rays are also longer on the mountain wood aster at 17 to 18 mm in most cases, while the white wood aster's are generally only 10 to 15 mm. Lastly, E. chlorolepsis is present only from southern Virginia south to Georgia in the Appalachian Mountains at altitudes of , while E. divaricata can be found from southern Canada south to Alabama, meaning their ranges only overlap in the southern United States, and there only at high elevations. Another species commonly confused with the white wood aster is Schreber's aster (Eurybia schreberi). Schreber's aster is typically found on moister soils, though it can also be found on mesic sites. While much of their ranges overlap, Schreber's aster is not found south of Virginia or Tennessee. Schreber's aster can also be distinguished by the more numerous teeth on the leaves, typically numbering 15 to 30 per side to the white wood aster's 6 to 15 per side. The leaves are wider on Schreber's aster with broader sinuses at the bases. The flower stalks are also densely hairy on the white wood aster, while they are only sparsely haired on Schreber's aster. Lastly, the clones of E. schreberi have sterile rosettes, while those of E. divaricata do not. Two other superficially similar plants include the bigleaf aster (Eurybia macrophylla) and the heartleaf aster (Symphyotrichum cordifolium), though both usually have blue or pale blue rays, while those of E. divaricata are always white. Both species sometimes have white rays in rare cases, but E. macrophylla can still be distinguished by its larger and broader leaves and S. cordifolium by its straighter and branched stems. Distribution and habitat Eurybia divaricata is present primarily in the Appalachian Mountains in eastern North America, with some populations in adjacent lowlands. It can be found on dry to mesic sites in eastern deciduous and mixed deciduous woods as well as on edges, clearings, and roadsides. It is most common at altitudes ranging from , though it can be found as high as . In Canada, it is present in Ontario and Quebec, while in the United States it can be found in all states from Maine south as far as Alabama and west to Ohio and Kentucky. It also has been introduced to Europe, particularly to the Netherlands. The species is known from only 25 locations in Canada, and is considered threatened. Cultivation and uses While the white wood aster does not compare in popularity to the other cultivated asters, such as the New England aster, it does have its niche, especially in North American native gardens. The plant flowers earlier than many other asters, does not require any staking to support it and flowers well in shade. It is attractive to gardeners due to its showy white flowers that emerge in mid to late summer, its prostrate habit, as well as its hardiness and the minimal maintenance it requires. It has little problem with both disease and insects. They do require partial shade, however, and they perform best when given about 4 hours of sunlight. The plants can be cut to in the spring in order to delay flowering and increase the number of branches. It is marginally hardy in USDA zone 3, and fully hardy from zones 4 to 8. It is commonly available in North American nurseries and several cultivars have been selected, including: * 'Fiesta', which has leaves streaked with white, giving the effect of confetti, and flowers that are light lavender. The selection was made in Waseca, Minnesota. * 'Raiche Form', which has white flowers that are larger than usual and darker, thin, sinewy stems. The cultivar was found by Roger Raiche. * 'Snow Heron', which has white flowers and dark green leaves splotched and streaked with white. The cultivar was selected from a chance seedling grown at the Heronswood Nursery in Washington. The young leaves of the plant can be cooked and eaten.

Philip Hayes Life and career Hayes was born in Oxford. His early musical education was overseen by his father William Hayes. He was awarded the degree of B.Mus in 1763 for the masque Telemachus and received his doctorate in 1777. He sang at the Chapel Royal in London from 1767, but returned to Oxford in 1776 to take up the post of organist at New College, Oxford and to assist his ailing father, whom he succeeded as Heather Professor of Music in 1777. He also replaced him as organist of Magdalen College, Oxford, and the University Church, and added the post of organist at St John's College in 1790. His professorial ‚Äòlectures‚Äô took the form of specially composed odes and oratorios which were performed in the Oxford Music School. In 1780 he was appointed conductor of the annual Festival of the Sons of the Clergy held at St Paul's Cathedral, and in 1791 he presided over Haydn‚Äôs visit to Oxford. As a conductor, he was one of the first English musicians to use a roll of paper with which to beat time. But he was best known for his difficult personality and corpulence. His frequent trips to London in a post chaise did not go unnoticed by the Oxford wags who had little difficulty in punning a nickname from 'Phil Hayes' ‚Äì thus he was fondly known as 'Fill Chaise'. A cartoon of him, entitled simply '--- From Oxford', was etched by Philippe Jacques de Loutherbourg in 1790 (see right). Hayes's musical language combined a respect for late Baroque idioms as practiced by composers such as Handel, together with a clear grasp of early classical styles. He was also interested in the music of earlier generations ‚Äì notably Purcell and his contemporaries ‚Äì and added considerably to the wide-ranging music library inherited from his father. His works show an imaginative approach to instrumentation: from 1763 he made frequent use of clarinets, and his six keyboard concertos (1769) were the first published in England to offer the option of performance on the early piano. Hayes died in London, aged 58. After his death the manuscripts of his unpublished music, along with the works of his father, were passed to the Bodleian Library, Oxford. A manuscript copy of four volumes of music by Purcell, copied by Hayes directly from Purcell's original manuscripts, survives at Tatton Park, a National Trust house near Knutsford in Cheshire.http://www.nationaltrustcollections.org.uk/object/3044675 For full list of contents of these volumes see: S. Pargeter 'A catalogue of the library at Tatton Park...', Cheshire Libraries and Museums, 1977, p.306-7. The manuscripts came to Tatton after the sale of the library of Samuel Arnold in 1803; they were purchased by the book collector Mark Masterman-Sykes, who gave them to his sister Elizabeth Sykes shortly after her marriage to Wilbraham Egerton of Tatton Park in 1806.

It was designed specifically for campaigns transitioning from the D&D; Basic Set to the D&D; Expert Set. The player characters (PCs) journey from a farmstead into uncharted wilderness, where they encounter new hazards and contend with a secret society. The adventure received a positive review from White Dwarf magazine. Plot summary Night's Dark Terror is a wilderness scenario in which the player characters travel by river and over mountains, from the Grand Duchy of Karameikos to the chaotic lands. The characters encounter a town under siege by goblins, a ruined city, and a lost valley. The module teaches the Dungeon Master (DM) how to handle wilderness conditions, and includes new rules for weather. The module also includes statistics for eleven new monsters, and comes with a battle map and counters for use in staging a battle in one of the towns. The wilderness module is set in the area of Eastern Karameikos. According to White Dwarf reviewer Graeme Davis, much of the action in the module has to do with the secret society known as the Iron Ring. The module begins in a beleaguered farmstead. The PCs then explore more than of wilderness, with eighteen locations, including a number of mini-dungeons, a ruined city, a riverside village, a frontier town, and a lost valley, with the minions of the Iron Ring waiting for the PCs at every step. Publication history B10 Night's Dark Terror was published by TSR in 1985 as a sixty-four page booklet, a map, and a cardstock counter sheet, with two outer folders. Night's Dark Terror was written in Britain by Jim Bambra, Graeme Morris, and Phil Gallagher, working for TSR UK Ltd. The module is described as \\"A Special Basic/Expert Transition Module for Levels 2-4\\", for campaigns that are being upgraded from the Basic Set to the Expert Set. The module includes a fifty-six page booklet, a large double-sized fold-out map, a smaller color map sheet, and a sheet of die-cut counters. The maps measure 22‚Äù x 34‚Äù, and the cardboard counters are for use with the Battlesystem supplement. The module features cover art by Brian Williams, and interior art by Helen Bedford. Reception Graeme Davis reviewed Night's Dark Terror for White Dwarf No. 78. Davis felt that the farmstead in the adventure's opening was nicely detailed, and that the counters to play out the action on the 25mm scale map for that location were a nice idea. He commented on the plot of the adventure, \\"There is enough here to keep the fastest-moving party going for some time, and a section of suggestions for further adventures can help the GM to open out a long-running campaign in the area.\\" Davis did note that the numbering system for wilderness locations was confusing, with an example where a location has one designation at one part in the module, and at a later point the location has a different designation which does not correspond with anything on the map. However, Davis felt that everything else in the module was written and laid out very well, and that the module would be a tremendous help for any game master learning the Expert rules. Ken Rolston reviewed D&D; module B10 Night's Dark Terror in brief for Dragon magazine No. 124 (August 1987). Rolston called Night's Dark Terror \\"the best-illustrated and best-designed module I've ever seen--and the adventure and campaign material is every bit as remarkable as the graphic presentation.\\" In his 1991 book Heroic Worlds, Lawrence Schick describes the adventure as an \\"Outstanding wilderness scenario... that 'bridges the gap' between the D&D; Basic and Expert rules.\\" See also * List of Dungeons & Dragons modules References External links *Review on RPG.net Category:Dungeons & Dragons modules Category:Mystara ","title":"Night's Dark Terror"},{"id":"11716799","text":"View of Crystal Palace Room, the focal room of the commercial section of Raccoon Mountain Caverns Raccoon Mountain Caverns is a cave located in Chattanooga, Tennessee in a band of Mississippian Period limestone, part of the Cumberland Plateau. The cave was officially discovered in 1929 by Leo Lambert, a local caver who had recently discovered and opened Ruby Falls, although legends exist of previous entry years earlier. Prior to Lambert's arrival, the property was owned by the Grand Hotel and used as a farm for their restaurant. On hot afternoons, it was said that the farmers would relax in front of several cracks in the rock at the base of the mountain and enjoy the cool air that was blowing out. In 1929, Leo Lambert was invited to explore the source of the air. As an experienced cave explorer, Lambert realized that in order for air to blow out of a crack in limestone rock, there must be a large cave beyond the crack to supply such a volume of air. Lambert enlarged the cracks and was rewarded by discovering several hundred feet of well- decorated cave passage in a cave that was close to U.S. Highway 41. He developed a series of trails, installed electric lights, and opened the cave to the public as \\"Tennessee Caverns\\" on June 28, 1931. The original tour, now known as the Lambert Tour, circled the Crystal Palace Room which was believed to be the largest room in the cave. Some twenty years after its opening, the Smith Brothers were managing the cave and discovered a small hole just off the Crystal Palace Room. The opening pinched down to 7.5 inches, so tight that the explorers had to exhale so they could squeeze through the gap. Less than twenty feet later, they found that the passage opened into a larger room and continued their discoveries. Eventually, they were able to enlarge the tour to include these newly discovered areas. Today, this ~0.5 mile loop tour is known as The Crystal Palace Tour. Spelunking tours known as Wild Cave Expeditions, were added in the 1970s, allowing visitors to visit the undeveloped areas of the cave beyond the commercial section. To date, over 5.5 miles of passageway has been discovered and mapped, with new discoveries still being made. Over the years, the name of the cave was changed from Tennessee Caverns to Crystal City Caves to Crystal Caverns and eventually to its current name, Raccoon Mountain Caverns in the late 1970s. Today, the property is also home to a campground with full service RV sites, water and electric sites, primitive tent sites, and cabins. The cave is known for its high level of active speleothem growth, fossils, and resident wildlife. In addition to several salamander species, the cave is home to a unique spider species referred to as the Crystal Caverns Cave Spider (Nesticus furtivus). This species, discovered initially in 1938, and officially described in 1984, is only known to exist within Raccoon Mountain Caverns. Raccoon Mountain Caverns is a major tourist attraction and is one of two caves in the Chattanooga/Hamilton County area that is open to the public.

Meaning is something assigned to objects of cultural or spiritual significance based on interpretations and perceived values by user populations, a process known as social construction of an object (Barker, 77). When moved to memory institutions such as libraries or museums, these objects of social construction require unique approaches to preservation and maintenance in order to remain relevant as representations of cultural or spiritual societies. In many memory institutions of the Western World, including libraries and museums, focus is often placed on the informational content and physical attributes, or artifactual value, of collected materials. Preservation policies are primarily concerned with the maintenance of these two things, either through reformatting to preserve textual information, or repairs and environmental controls to ensure continued existence of their physical structure (Foot, 19). However, it is necessary to look beyond the physical and informational aspects of objects in order to ensure we are also preserving the integrity of the spiritual or cultural values which may be fundamental in defining the object. Concerns arise when actions taken to preserve the physical object may compromise the spiritual or cultural integrity of a given object. Artifacts, including books, throughout history and the present were created and utilized according to rules and taboos that may not be inherently understood in today's world of mass consumer goods and material culture. While not all books, documents, and artifacts have rituals or socially constructed beliefs associated with their continued existence, it is a relevant issue for many cultural and religious collections.  Examples  An extreme example of how efforts to physically preserve may compromise the socially constructed meaning of the object is the Shinto Shrines of Ise Jingu, in Japan (Mar√©, 2004). These shrines are of significant cultural and spiritual value to the Japanese people, but every twenty years since the time of Emperor Temmu in the 7th century C.E. the buildings are completely destroyed and rebuilt. The rebuilding process is based on descriptions in the Documents on the rituals of the Great Shrine of Ise which dates from 804 C.E. and ensures that the recreations are exact replicas of the shrines taken down. Physical preservation of these monuments would damage the spiritual and cultural integrity of the process and purpose behind the continuous rebuilding. Similarly, in the Buddhist faith, materials are considered to have a life, which must be allowed to progress and end naturally. Impermanence (anitya) in the Buddhist faith relates to the natural end of all things, nirvana, and acts of physical preservation would be contrary to this belief (Karlstr√∂m). Buddhist shrines are an example of such items that hold spiritual meaning. Physical preservation can also work to maintain spiritual and culture integrity of an object, especially in the case of musical instruments. At the violin museum in Cremona, Italy, nine instruments crafted by the Amatis, Guarneris, and by Antonio Stradivari are played ceremoniously six days a week ‚Äì both to keep them in good physical, playable condition, and to maintain their cultural significance and meaning. From the island of Java in Indonesia, the instruments of the gamelan are treated with respect and reverence, and played on a regular basis to maintain their physical and spiritual life. They are played only for certain occasions and only by certain individuals trained in the art. They must also be handled and stored with care to be sure no one should compromise their spiritual integrity by stepping over them. (Kartomi and Mendon√ßa) Gamelan instruments can be found in museums throughout North America, but to accurately remain gamelan instruments, they must be treated and respected according to both their physical and spiritual properties. However, examples of the significance of meaning and spiritual integrity exist in North America as well. Jish is a Navajo medicine bundle used in religious rituals related to curing or prevention, and specific care and established provenance is necessary to preserve the existence of jish versus a simple bundle of herb and grasses. NAGPRA, or North American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act has helped to highlight this issue of meaning and spiritual integrity in the United States. The act not only covers objects and remains recovered from American Indian graves, but the subsequent literary material developed based on the examination and analysis of these objects. (Grose) Preservation of meaning is perhaps most relevant and recognized in museum collections, but this does not mean there are not key books and documents that are defined by their social construction as well as their physical existence. When a book printed on acid paper turns to dust, there is no doubt that it ceases to exist as book. However, when books are stacked on top of a Koran, or a Guru Granth Sahib is repaired rather than ceremoniously cremated, the spiritual integrity of these texts is compromised or destroyed, and the physical object is void of spiritual or cultural meaning. It may at this point actually cease to be what it had been previously identified as, at least in terms of its cultural or spiritual meaning. Admittedly, more work and research needs to be done in regard to preservation of meaning in the area of Library Science. However, it is necessary for libraries and archival institutions to assess their preservation priorities in consideration of social and cultural meaning in tandem with physical attributes and informational context. Preservation and curatorial policies and activities can take into account how materials are housed, handled, repaired, or analyzed not just in terms of preserving physical qualities, but spiritual and cultural meaning as well.

It was believed that demons could lead these clouds over fields to destroy crops. The demons could be thwarted by men with supernatural properties. A zduhaƒá (Cyrillic: –∑–¥—É—Ö–∞—õ, ) and vetrovnjak (–≤–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≤—ö–∞–∫, []) in Serbian tradition, and a dragon man in Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian traditions, were men believed to have an inborn supernatural ability to protect their estate, village, or region against destructive weather conditions, such as storms, hail, or torrential rains. It was believed that the souls of these men could leave their bodies in sleep, to intercept and fight with demonic beings imagined as bringers of bad weather. Having defeated the demons and taken away the stormy clouds they brought, the protectors would return into their bodies and wake up tired. Notions associated with the zduhaƒá, vetrovnjak, and dragon man, respectively, are not identical. The dragon man fought against female demons called ala, which led hail clouds over fields to destroy crops, and consumed the fertility of the fields. The zduhaƒái (plural) of an area usually fought together against the attacking zduhaƒái of another area who were bringing a storm and hail clouds above their fields. The victorious zduhaƒái would loot the yield of all agricultural produce from the territory of their defeated foes, and take it to their own region. The vetrovnjak, recorded in parts of western Serbia, fought against a bringer of bad weather imagined as a black bird. The zduhaƒái are recorded in Montenegro, eastern Herzegovina, part of Bosnia, and the Sand≈æak region of south-western Serbia. The dragon men are recorded in eastern Serbia, Banat, western Bulgaria, and Macedonia. Zduhaƒá and vjedogonja In Montenegro, eastern Herzegovina, part of Bosnia, and the Sand≈æak region of south-western Serbia, a man who was thought to be able to protect his estate, village, or region from bad weather was called a zduhaƒá or a stuha. These names have a number of variants, which can be with or without h, with v instead of h, with or without the ending ƒá, and with ƒç instead of ƒá.Kuli≈°iƒá, Petroviƒá, & Panteliƒá 1970, pp. 139‚Äì41 According to philologist Franz Miklosich, the Serbian word stuhaƒá is cognate with the Old Slavonic stuhia () or stihia () \\"the elements\\", which stem from the Old Greek stoicheion (œÉœÑŒøŒπœáŒµ·øñŒøŒΩ) \\"element\\".Miklosich 1886, p. 327 The latter name is the origin of the Modern Greek stikhio (œÉœÑŒøŒπœáŒµŒπœå), denoting various kinds of spirits in Greek folklore, such as those fighting for the well-being of their village or area against adverse spirits from elsewhere.Plotnikova 2008, para. 10 According to linguists Petar Skok and Norbert Jokl, stuhaƒá stems from the Albanian stuh√≠/stih√≠ \\"storm\\".ƒêeriƒá 1930, p. 48 In any case, the form zduhaƒá may have resulted from folk etymology through association with the Serbian duh \\"spirit\\".ƒåajkanoviƒá 1994, p. 264‚Äì65 The notion that the human being consists of body and soul is found in traditional Slavic culture. There was a belief among the South Slavs that, in some people, the soul could leave the body and again return into it.Radenkoviƒá 1996, pp. 12‚Äì13 The zduhaƒá belonged to such people in Serbian tradition. It was thought that, after a zduhaƒá fell asleep, his soul could fly out of his body, or \\"go into the winds\\", as it was said in Montenegro.ƒêorƒëeviƒá 1953, pp. 237‚Äì38Rovinski 1901, pp. 528‚Äì29 In some accounts, it exited the body in the form of a fly. The zduhaƒá's soul had the power to direct the motion of winds and clouds. If the body of the sleeping zduhaƒá was rotated so that his head and feet changed places, or if he was carried away from where he fell asleep, his soul would not be able to return into his body, and the zduhaƒá would die. Although zduhaƒái (plural) could be women and children, most were adult men. Their supernatural power was thought to be inborn. In many regions it was regarded that the zduhaƒái were born with a caul‚Äîwhite or red, depending on the regional belief. The mother would dry the caul and sew into a piece of garment always worn by the child, such as a pouch attached under the child's armpit. In the clan of Kuƒçi, eastern Montenegro, the mother would preserve the caul hiding it from all eyes, and hand it to her son when he grew up. The caul was supposed to protect him when he flew as a zduhaƒá. If the caul was destroyed, the child's supernatural power would be lost. A birthmark of a zduhaƒá in Herzegovina could be a tuft of hair growing on his shoulder or upper arm. In Montenegrin Littoral, the caul played no role in the birth of zduhaƒái, who were rather born on certain Fridays at a set hour. There was also a belief in Herzegovina that male children who were conceived on the eves of great feast days would become zduhaƒái.ƒêorƒëeviƒá 1953, pp. 239‚Äì40 A 19th-century ethnographic account from eastern Herzegovina describes a way through which a man who was not born as a zduhaƒá could become one. Forty days after he ceased praying to God and washing his face, the man should go to some level ground, before he drew a circle on the ground and sat in its centre. Soon the Devil would come and ask the man whether he was willing to join his army, and what form he wanted to be transformed into. When the man stated the desired form, the Devil would turn him into that, making him a zduhaƒá. In the region of Semberija, northeast Bosnia, –∞ zduhaƒá could pass his supernatural power on to his son.Kajmakoviƒá 1974, p. 102 The appearance of zduhaƒái was not much different from that of ordinary people, but they had some traits that set them apart. They were deep sleepers, very hard to wake up, often drowsy, pensive, thoughtful, and solemn. Their faces were often puffy, eyes shadowy. They were wise and shrewd, successful in whatever they were doing and resourceful in dealing with problems; their households were prosperous.ƒêorƒëeviƒá 1953, pp. 241‚Äì42 In Semberija, zduhaƒái were said to be good scapulimantic diviners, and to be able to communicate with domestic animals. The clan of Pa≈°troviƒái from Montenegrin Littoral claimed that the zduhaƒái could hear any doings anywhere in the world; if someone stepped on a zduhaƒá's foot, they could hear that too.Kordiƒá 1990, pp. 220‚Äì21 The clan of Kuƒçi held that the zduhaƒái were outstanding long jumpers. Adverse weather such as a storm or hail could devastate crop fields and orchards, and thus jeopardize the livelihood of farmers in the affected area. A role of zduhaƒái, according to folk tradition, was to lead storms and hail clouds away from their family estates, villages, or regions, to save their crops. A zduhaƒá could take the storms and hail clouds over the territory of another zduhaƒá to destroy its crops. The other zduhaƒá would fly up to confront the bringer of bad weather, and there would be a fight between the zduhaƒái.ƒêorƒëeviƒá 1953, pp. 242‚Äì44 They fought alone, or in bands composed of individuals from the same area. Thus it was thought that the zduhaƒái from eastern Bosnia fought together against those from Herzegovina and Montenegro. The zduhaƒái from Sand≈æak fought jointly against the Albanian zduhaƒái. On the Adriatic coast, battles were waged between a band of zduhaƒái from Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, and northern Albania on one side, and a band of zduhaƒái from Apulia in southeast Italy on the other side. The latter were also called the transmarine zduhaƒái, as Apulia is situated across the Adriatic Sea from Montenegro. Each band had its leader. A man named Mato Glu≈°ac (1774‚Äì1870), from the village of Korita in Herzegovina, was reputed the supreme commander of the Herzegovinian and Montenegrin zduhaƒái;ƒêorƒëeviƒá 1953, pp. 245‚Äì46 he was also a famous seer.ƒêorƒëeviƒá 1953, pp. 249‚Äì50 According to some accounts, zduhaƒái flew and fought mostly in spring when strong winds blew, and, as held in some regions, only during night. As recorded in Montenegro, the zduhaƒái \\"went into the winds\\" usually during the Nativity Fast (15 November ‚Äì 24 December), when there was not much snow and the winds were forceful. They also flew frequently from mid-February to the end of March. In some years, they were not active at all. A stick of luƒç (fatwood) could be turned into the most powerful zduhaƒá weapon if it was charred at both ends. The zduhaƒái of a band would leave their bodies in sleep and gather at an appointed place, before flying into a battle. They used various weapons, such as spindles, beech buds, sharp splinters, leaves, stalks of straw, fluff, flakes, sand, long twigs, cornel stones, pine cones, eggshells, and other light objects. As believed in Herzegovina, zduhaƒái uprooted gigantic firs and oaks and fought with them. However, the most powerful zduhaƒá weapon was held to be a stick of luƒç (resinous wood burned to give light or used as kindling) charred at both ends, or any charred splinter of wood. A zduhaƒá who was hit with this weapon would surely die. People therefore avoided igniting the sticks at both ends, and they took care that no splinters were left half- burned.Rovinski 1901, pp. 530‚Äì31 Beside the weapons, each zduhaƒá carried a milk bucket and a peck measure; an alternative for the latter could be a shovel or broom from a threshing floor. If a band of zduhaƒái succeeded to seize the peck measures from the enemy band, they would thereby transfer the crop yield from the area of their enemies to their own area. Seizing the milk buckets meant that the milk yield would be transferred. According to the clan of Kuƒçi, zduhaƒái used their peck measures, milk buckets, and other containers to grab off the overall yield of the enemy territory. The battles of zduhaƒái were furious. They were accompanied by forceful gales and whirlwinds which uprooted trees and whipped up dust.ƒêorƒëeviƒá 1953, pp. 247‚Äì48 In Montenegro, it was considered dangerous to throw stones in the wind, because that might knock out an eye of a zduhaƒá, who would kill the culprit.Rovinski 1901, p. 533 A fighting zduhaƒá was supposed to retain his peck measure and milk bucket, while trying to seize these objects from an enemy zduhaƒá; he should hit and not get hit. The victorious band of zduhaƒái would loot the yield of all agricultural produce from the territory of their defeated foes. The harvest in the coming season would thus be excellent for the victors and poor for the defeated zduhaƒái. After the battle, the soul of the zduhaƒá would return into his body, and he would wake up weak and exhausted. If he was wounded, he would be sick for some time afterwards‚Äîbefore he recovered, or died if his wound was mortal. There are records of seriously ill men who claimed that they were wounded in zduhaƒá battles. It was held in Montenegrin Littoral that a mortally wounded zduhaƒá could still recuperate if he revenged himself on his wounder before the eighth day of his wound expired. Pavel Rovinski, Russian philologist and ethnographer, recorded a story told to him by a man of the clan of Ceklin in southern Montenegro (Rovinski also heard a similar story in Montenegrin Littoral):Rovinski 1901, pp. 531‚Äì32 > There was a Ceklin zduhaƒá who was so beaten by other zduhaƒái that he had to > die, and there he was, dying. Various remedies were brought to him, but he > accepted none, because all was in vain. Finally he had everybody ushered out > of his house, except for one of his brothers, a famous hero; all were also > driven away from the door, to prevent eavesdropping. Then the dying man said > to his brother: \\"I will surely die, if I am not substituted for; and you can > do it and save me, if you will have enough strength.\\" The brother, of > course, promised that, and the sick man continued: \\"You will have to go > tonight to Mount So-and-so, at three to four hours' walking distance from > here, most of the way lying through a dense forest. You will come beneath a > stair-like cliff and stop there, and a great fear will seize you. To > encourage yourself, take your two pistols and a knife with the silver > sheath.\\" \\"I will also take a musket,\\" added the brother, and the sick man > said, \\"You may take that too, though only as an encouragement, as it will be > of no use to you, but you must have the knife.\\" \\"I can go without any > weapon, with a pocket knife, if it is against a single, and with a weapon I > can go against a hundred,\\" interrupted the brother again. \\"Take it easy with > your boldness,\\" resumed the sick man, \\"and by all means take the knife. When > you come beneath the cliff, the sky will be cloudless, lit, and there will > be a silence in the air; then you will notice a wisp of cloud coming from > the direction of Mount Rumija, and the wind will start to blow. The wisp > will turn into an enormous storm cloud that will cover all the sky, and > there will come a darkness such as you have never seen before; the wind will > blow, whistle, roar, and shriek, as you have also never heard before; the > hair will rise on your head so that it will lift your cap, and I fear that > you may go mad from horror. And if you persevere, you will see three bulls > falling down from the cloud on the earth: a light-haired, a pied, and a > dark-haired bull. The latter two will start to beat the former, which is the > weakest, because it is already wounded. Make sure to strike the two bulls > with the knife; but take care not to cut the light-haired bull; that would > be the death of me, as it would be if the two bulls overcame the light- > haired bull.\\" > Having heard all of that, the brother took two pistols, poured more > gunpowder, and sharpened the flints; he put the pistols into his belt, > placed the knife between them, and slung a musket over his shoulder. He set > forth. He passed through the dark forest; he came beneath the stair-like > cliff; the moon and the stars were shining, so it was like a day; a silence > all around him, pleasant; he sat down and lit his pipe.

He > stabbed the pied bull in the neck with the knife; it staggered and fell; the > light-haired bull got encouraged. Then he stabbed the dark-haired bull, and > it slumped; the light-haired was finishing them off with its horns. This was > not enough for him, and, fearing that the cut bulls could still rise up, he > kept on striking them with the knife as long as there was a breath in their > bodies. The storm cloud suddenly disappeared; together with it, the light- > haired bull vanished. Again the moon and the stars shone; again a silence > and blessedness. He was going back home as if flying; when he arrived he > found his brother sitting by the hearth, placing logs on the fire, healthy > as if he had never been sick. An interpretation of the story about the Ceklin zduhaƒá is given in an essay by literary theoretician Radoman Kordiƒá. According to him, the story is a product of the symbolic scheme of the culture of Montenegrin Serbs.Kordiƒá 1990, pp. 135, 143 The story comprises a zduhaƒá narration and a heroic narration.Kordiƒá 1990, p. 129 The former is based on the mythological beliefs in the zduhaƒái, which were strongest in Montenegro. The latter is based on the heroic ideology exalting death in battle, which was a predominant trait of the Montenegrin society.Kordiƒá 1990, pp. 184‚Äì195 The zduhaƒá and the famous hero symbolize, respectively, two systems of the Montenegrin culture. At its beginning, the story is placed in the framework of the first system, but it is realized with the means and on the ideological plane of the second system.Kordiƒá 1990, pp. 136‚Äì37 The beaten zduhaƒá, who is supposed to die, diverges from the mythological pattern, and he replaces himself with the hero.Kordiƒá 1990, pp. 162‚Äì63 This results in an ironic twist. The fearless hero acts in fact as a butcher of bulls which do not even fight back. The apparently happy ending degrades the zduhaƒá into a subject without identity. Kordiƒá argues, using mostly Lacanian psychoanalysis, that there is a third, silent narration in the story‚Äîthat of the death drive‚Äîwhich crumbles the other two narrations. In a story recorded in the area of Cetinje, a zduhaƒá was mortally wounded on Mount Lovƒáen in a battle against the transmarine zduhaƒái. The dying zduhaƒá disclosed the way in which he could be saved, and one of his relatives acted according to the instructions. He went by night to a valley where he saw horses, oxen, rams, billy goats, men, and women. He passed by them in total silence, before he saw a black ox. He struck the ox with a wooden bar, and the animal roared tremendously. When he returned home, he found the zduhaƒá sound and healthy. As believed in the region of Biraƒç, eastern Bosnia, a mortally wounded zduhaƒá could get well if he burned beech buds in a milk bucket, and censed himself with the smoke, using a spindle to wave the smoke toward himself. Before performing this rite, he should have publicly confessed that he was a zduhaƒá. Most zduhaƒái would reputedly rather die than do that, because afterwards they could no more fly as zduhaƒái. As thought in Herzegovina, a man who did not want to be a zduhaƒá anymore, should have confessed to a priest and promised that he would not fly anymore.ƒêorƒëeviƒá 1953, p. 250 Zduhaƒái were regarded as a blessing for their home and village, as guardians of the prosperity and well- being of their region, and as good, honest, just, and law-obeying people. In the region of Biraƒç, zduhaƒái were said to meet with angels \\"on the leaves of high and thick branches\\". They were sometimes thought to have a prophetic gift. However, a zduhaƒá could ally himself with the Devil, and use his innate power in accordance with the Devil's directions. That zduhaƒá was doomed to turn into a vampire, unless he confessed and repented. Some influential historical persons were believed to have been zduhaƒái, such as warrior and writer Marko Miljanov, and Petar I Petroviƒá-Njego≈°, who was the Prince-Bishop of Montenegro from 1784 to 1830. Mahmud Bushatli, the Ottoman pasha of Skadar in northern Albania, was reputed a powerful zduhaƒá in Montenegro. It was claimed that his mother carried him for three years. Bushatli was defeated and killed by the Montenegrins under Petar I, while attempting to subdue them in 1796. Since that time, the crop yield in Montenegro and northern Albania was allegedly not as high as before. Bushatli was said to have fought for the crop yield against the transmarine zduhaƒái. Petar I was reported saying of him, \\"I regret his death although he was my biggest enemy.\\" After Bushatli was killed, his body was burned; according to oral accounts, green flames rose from it. In South Slavic tradition, green could be associated with supernatural creatures, like witches and dragons.Radenkoviƒá 1996, pp. 305‚Äì6 An individual domestic animal could also be regarded as a zduhaƒá, such as a shepherd dog, ox, bellwether, horse, or billy goat. If an animal habitually made vocal sounds in sleep, it was assumed to be a zduhaƒá. Such an animal was cherished, and was not for sale. The spirit of the animal zduhaƒá would leave its body in sleep and fight against the enemy zduhaƒái, to protect its own flock or herd. Only the fertility of the livestock depended on the outcome of the battles fought by the animal zduhaƒái; they had no bearing on the crop yield.ƒêorƒëeviƒá 1953, p. 244 In the region of U≈æice, western Serbia, it was believed that storms and hail clouds were led by zduhaƒái who flew above them in the form of big birds. A black ox and a three-year-old rooster defended their village from them‚Äîespecially the rooster, for which reason he was not killed for food, but kept as a home guardian. In folk spells for repelling hail clouds in Serbia, these clouds were called white cattle. This could be compared with the idea of the black ox as a defender from hail.Tolstoy & Tolstaya 1981, p. 112 In some regions of southern Montenegro, such as the Bay of Kotor, Grbalj, and Zagaraƒç, and in parts of Herzegovina, a man who acted as a zduhaƒá was called a vjedogonja or jedogonja.ƒêorƒëeviƒá 1953, p. 240Dragoviƒá 1997, pp. 196‚Äì97 There was a rule: if a child was born with a caul, the girl would become a vje≈°tica \\"witch\\", and the boy would become a vjedogonja. This could have been prevented by cutting the caul on a trough for feeding dogs, and throwing it away; the child would then grow up into an ordinary person. While the zduhaƒái and vjedogonje (plural) protected their community from the threats coming from the outside, the witches were the enemy within, doing harm primarily to their own relatives and friends.Kuli≈°iƒá, Petroviƒá, & Panteliƒá 1970, p. 64 A correspondence between the witches and the vjedogonje can be seen in a passage from The Mountain Wreath, a poetic drama by Petar II Petroviƒá-Njego≈°, the plot of which takes place in 18th-century Montenegro: {style=\\"margin- left:auto;margin-right:auto; width: 50em;\\" |- style=\\"text-align:left;\\" –ë–æ–≥ —Å–∞ –Ω–∞–º–∞ –∏ –∞–Ω—í–µ–ª–∏ –±–æ–∂—ò–∏! –ê –µ–≤–æ —Å–∏ —É–¥—Ä–∏–æ, –≤–ª–∞–¥–∏–∫–æ, —É –Ω–µ–∫–∞–∫–≤–µ —Å–º—É—õ–µ–Ω–µ –≤—ò–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–µ, –∫–∞ —É –º–∞—Ä—á—É –∫–∞–¥ —É–¥—Ä–∏ –≤—ò–µ—à—Ç–∏—Ü–∞ –∞–ª' —É —ò–µ—Å–µ–Ω –º—É—Ç–Ω—É –≤—ò–µ–¥–æ–≥–æ—ö–∞.Petroviƒá-Njego≈° 1952, p. 39 God and His angels be with us! Why here you have dashed, O Bishop, into some confused winds, like a witch when she dashes in March or a vjedogonja [when he dashes] in the gloomy autumn. } A man named Vukota said these words to Bishop Danilo, one of the main characters of The Mountain Wreath, who previously uttered a piercing vision speaking as if he was alone. The second and the third verses can be compared with an idiomatic expression whose literal sense is \\"to dash into a frenzied countenance\\", meaning \\"to fall into a frenzied or crazed exaltation\\".Petroviƒá-Njego≈° 1952, pp. 37‚Äì38, 174‚Äì76 Vukota compared Bishop Danilo's exaltation with that of a witch or a vjedogonja when their spirit flew out of their body. It was thought that the witches held an assembly each year on 1 March,ƒêorƒëeviƒá 1953, p. 28 and the vjedogonje mostly flew during the long autumn nights, especially when strong winds blew. After Vukota's words, Bishop Danilo started as if from a dream. The vjedogonje fought in regional bands, their weapons being huge boulders or gigantic trees which they uprooted with one hand. The leaders among them were those who had a tail and were hairy. A 19th-century ethnographic account describes that \\"when a man regarded as a vjedogonja dies, they drive hawthorn spines under his nails, and cut the tendons beneath his knees with a knife whose sheath is black, so that he could not get out of his grave (like a vampire).\\"Karad≈æiƒá 1867, p. 215 Petar I Petroviƒá-Njego≈° preached among people against superstition. He strongly condemned the denunciation and persecution of women as witches. After one such incident in 1830 in south Montenegro, Petar I wrote an epistle, mentioning vjedogonje in a sentence: \\"Nowhere have I found nor has anyone told me that witches and vjedogonje exist, except in the blind and sad Serbian people, because it is blind and believes lies rather than Christ's Gospel and Christ's teachings and commands.\\"Petroviƒá-Njego≈° 2000, para. 41 In the folklore of Croats of Ravni Kotari, a region in northern Dalmatia, there were men called vidogoja. They were believed to know past and future things. People paid them to cure the sick, which they did by saying prayers and making the sign of the cross all over the patient's body. The vidogoja were also thought to be able to inflict diseases on people, and to have evil eyes. They could not fly.Zoriƒá 1896, p. 227 Vetrovnjak, vilovit, and oblaƒçar In the region of Mount Zlatibor in western Serbia, the man who protected the fields of his village from bad weather was called a vetrovnjak; the name is derived from vetar \\"wind\\". At the onset of a storm, the vetrovnjak would fall into a trance-like sleep. It was thought that his soul then flew skywards to fight against some black bird which led the storm and hail clouds. After he woke up, he had to rest for some time to restore his physical strength. It was believed that a vetrovnjak could take the bad clouds over the estate of a man with whom he was in a conflict.Zeƒçeviƒá 1981, p. 149 In the region of Dragaƒçevo, western Serbia, people told of the vilovit men, who would disappear at the sight of hail clouds, reappearing bloody and with torn clothes after the storm was over. Asked where they had been to, they would only answer that they had gone to fight against those who led the hail clouds toward their village. The adjective vilovit means \\"having a vila's properties\\" or \\"vila-like\\". The name vila denotes Slavic nymphs or fairies, female anthropomorphic spirits of woods, mountains, clouds, and waters, who had magical powers.Tolstoy & Tolstaya 1981, p. 105 In the region of Tamnava, north-western Central Serbia, the vilovit men were also called vetrenjaks.Todoroviƒá 2004, pp. 209‚Äì10 An early mention of vetrenjaks is found in a short story by Serbian writer Milovan Gli≈°iƒá, published in 1875. In the story, men from Krniƒá and nearby villages talk about a battle their vetrenjaks fought on a hill to repel a hail storm brought by alien vetrenjaks. They uprooted oaks and beat each other with them, their bodies turning black and blue from the blows. The defenders were victorious and moved the storm to a mountain, away from their fields.Gli≈°iƒá 1969, p. 74 Serbian writer Janko Veselinoviƒá was well acquainted with the folklore of Tamnava, where he worked as a teacher in a village. In his short story published in 1888, an elderly woman talks to him about various supernatural beings, including her co- villager Petar, a vetrenjak: \\"As soon as he perceives a greyish cloud and hears thunder, Petar leaves whatever he may be doing, and goes somewhere. He runs so fast that no biped can overtake him. After he passes the cloud, he comes back naked and blue as indigo. Then he has to stay in bed for a week. And do you know why he is like that? He told me. The pogibaoci [hanged and drowned people] from surrounding villages drive the clouds toward our village, and Petar will not let hail beat us. He fights with them until he will overpower them, or they him... [Petar said] 'We uproot oaks, as one would pull onion bulbs from the ground, and beat each other with them.'\\"Veselinoviƒá 1896, p. 20 A vetrenjak from the village of Trliƒá had reportedly claimed that he clashed with oxen and rams led by devils whose aim was to discharge hail over his village. Seeing hail clouds, people in Tamnava would shout, \\"Keep your cattle out of our crops!\\" Thus they addressed hanged and drowned persons who were imagined to fly before the clouds and lead them. Farmers avoided leaving a harrow on the field, as they thought that the hail-bringing devils could slam it on the head of the vetrenjak who defended the village. People behaved amicably toward vetrenjaks, but they warned their children to keep off from them, as these men had \\"business with devils\\". In 2004, ethnographers interviewed elderly people in a group of hamlets south-west of the town of Valjevo, who defined the vetrenjak as a man able to direct the movement of clouds. When such a man died, the wind would suddenly start to blow and clouds would loom. The term vetrenjak also designated a man who could fly invisible, which he usually did by night. He was born with a caul which was thrown away and eaten by birds.Yakushkina 2006, pp. 320‚Äì21 In the folklore of Serbs in the region of Syrmia, protection from hail was provided by the men called oblaƒçars; the name is derived from oblak \\"cloud\\". The oblaƒçar would rush directly beneath a dark cloud, as soon as it appeared above the fields of his village. There, he would run to and fro, waving his arms or holding a stick raised in the direction of the cloud. He would not stop until he was completely exhausted and drenched. In this way, the oblaƒçar fought against a gigantic serpentine demon called a≈ædaja, which was thought to fly accompanied by its retinue in low dark clouds, spewing hail from its broad muzzle. If the cloud moved away from his village without discharging hail, it meant that the oblaƒçar had overpowered the a≈ædaja and its retinue. An oblaƒçar in the village of Mirkovci annually received wheat from his co-villagers as a reward for his struggle.Tolstoy & Tolstaya 1981, pp. 106‚Äì7 Dragon man The men who defended their village from bad weather were referred to as dragons in eastern and southern Serbia, western Bulgaria, and Macedonia.Georgieva 1993, p. 112 In Serbia, they were also called zmajevit \\"having a dragon's properties\\", from zmaj \\"dragon\\". The mythological dragon was imagined as a fiery creature with wings, usually having a snake-like shape; he could also take the form of an eagle or a man.Georgieva 1993, pp. 109‚Äì11Kuli≈°iƒá, Petroviƒá, & Panteliƒá 1970, p. 142Zeƒçeviƒá 1981, p. 68 Each dragon had his own territory,Plotnikova 2008, para. 7Zeƒçeviƒá 1981, p. 62 within which he dwelt by a forest spring or stream, in the hollow trunk of a beech tree, or in a mountain cave. He was benevolent toward the humans, and he took care that his territory received the right amount of rain at the right time, for good growth of the crops.Zeƒçeviƒá 1981, p. 67 His arch-enemy was a female demon named ala (plural: ale),Zeƒçeviƒá 1981, p. 64 whose main activity was to lead storm and hail clouds over fields to destroy crops. The ale also consumed the fertility of the fields. Whenever he noticed an ala approaching, the dragon would fly up into the clouds to fight against the demon and chase her away. He shot fiery arrows and stones at her, which produced lightning and thunder.Trojanoviƒá 1983, p. 151 In the regions where people believed in the zduhaƒái, the dragon was a highly regarded mythological being, but he was not associated with the crops and their protection from demons.Plotnikova 1998, pp. 164‚Äì65 Similar was the case in other than western regions of Bulgaria. The dragon man was believed to act similar to the mythological dragon: as soon as he saw bad weather approaching, which he knew was brought by an ala, he would leave whatever he was doing, and fly up to confront the demon. This he did by falling into a deep sleep, or entering a state similar to death, usually at the very spot where he happened to be at that time. His soul then left his body in the form of a snake or a lizard, and soared skywards. It was claimed that he was not breathing as long as his soul was absent from his body. The battle could last for a whole day, or even for several days, during which time the man lay unconscious, sweating profusely from the exertion of the fight. There was a danger that, during the course of the battle, the ala might approach the man's body and harm him, which could be prevented by someone swinging a blade above him, or by sticking the blade at the lying man's head.Trojanoviƒá 1983, pp. 145‚Äì46Zeƒçeviƒá 1981, p. 150 He should not be pushed or moved while in this state: if he was not in the same position as when he fell asleep, his soul would not be able to return into his body, and he would die. When he woke up after the battle with the ala, he was very tired.Georgieva 1993, p. 134 Apart from these characteristics, the dragon man was seen as an ordinary human.Kuli≈°iƒá, Petroviƒá, & Panteliƒá 1970, p. 143Georgieva 1993, p. 132 Swinging a blade, such as a scythe, above a sleeping dragon man, could prevent the ala with whom he fought from approaching his body and harming him. There is a story about a dragon man from the village of Peƒçenjevce, eastern Serbia, who saw an ala in a cloud while he was scything. He said to scythemen beside him, \\"I am going to sleep, and you swing a scythe above me,\\" before he lay down and fell asleep. A man who swung the scythe, however, inadvertently grazed him with the tip of the blade. When the dragon woke up, he told that he had been wounded by the ala he fought with, and lost a lot of blood.Trojanoviƒá 1983, p. 147 A dragon from the village of Bogojevac always kept with him a piece of a scythe blade or a knife. As soon as he perceived the imminent approach of bad weather, he would lie down on the ground and stick the blade above his head. It was thought that his spirit then soared into the clouds to deal with the ala. When he was drafted into the army, he fell asleep without a blade during a thunderstorm, and died.Zeƒçeviƒá 1981, p. 151 At a village near Tran in western Bulgaria, a man reputed to be a dragon would swoon when it started to thunder. After he came to, he would say, \\"How tired I am!\\" This was thought to refer to the strenuous battle he fought in the clouds. In Banat and some areas of eastern Serbia, the dragon men were referred to as alovit.Radenkoviƒá n.d., para. 11 This adjective is derived from the noun ala, and means \\"having supernatural or demonic properties\\". It could be applied not only to humans, but also to dragons, snakes, horses, trees, armies, and rivers.Bjeletiƒá 2004, p. 146 An ala could be seen as a good creature in some regions,Zeƒçeviƒá 1981, p. 66 such as Banat, Mount Kopaonik in south Serbia, and the adjacent ≈Ωupa basin with nearby areas, where she was believed to be connected to a territory, which she defended against attacks by the ale from other territories.Radenkoviƒá 2001, pp. 559‚Äì60Todoroviƒá 2011, pp. 224‚Äì26 This can be compared with the inter-regional fights of the zduhaƒái. In villages of the Kru≈°evac Municipality, when blessings were pronounced on Christmas Eve, the villagers would also say, \\"God, save our guardian ala.\\"Zeƒçeviƒá 1981, pp. 152‚Äì53 People interpreted hail ravaging their crops as a defeat of their ala by an ala from elsewhere.Radenkoviƒá n.d., para. 7 The victorious ala would loot the crop yield of the ravaged area, and transfer it to her own territory. At the sight of hail clouds, the alovit man would fall into a trance-like sleep, before his soul issued from his body and flew up to the clouds. In the manner of an ala, his soul led the clouds over the fields of a neighbouring village. A man, who was thought to be alovit, was described as unusually tall, thin, and bony-faced, with a long beard and moustache. When the weather was good, he worked and behaved like the others in his village, but as soon as dark clouds covered the sky, he would close himself in his house, put blinds on the windows, and remain alone for as long as the bad weather lasted. People also talked that he suffered from epilepsy.Kuli≈°iƒá, Petroviƒá, & Panteliƒá 1970, p. 5 In the region of Boljevac, the epileptics were said to be alovit‚Äîtheir souls went out of their bodies during epileptic fits and led hail clouds.Tolstoy & Tolstaya 1981, p. 104 At the village of Kusiƒá in Banat, a man named Ilija Bordan was regarded to be alovit; the villagers talked that he had a tail. Whenever a thunderstorm came, his appearance changed‚Äîhe fought with an ala. If the ala was overwhelming him, Ilija would lie down and sleep, and if he was overpowering her, the clouds would start to dissipate. There was a tale in the same village about an alovit man who would warn the villagers of the approach of a thunderstorm, before he took a wagon pole on his back and flew into the clouds. At the village of Sokolovac in Banat, people told of an alovit man who had four nipples. At the sight of hail clouds, he would mount his mare and disappear for several days. The latter two men would come back tired, bruised, and with torn clothes. As held in the central Serbian region of Gru≈æa, men could become dragonlike. As such, they would suddenly disappear during thunderstorms, and fly into the dark clouds to fight against ale. They were characterized as nimble, hot-tempered, rash and very strong. At a village near Radomir in western Bulgaria, there was a dragon man who was said to have been physically crippled by an ala. The dragon man was believed to be born with some physical peculiarity, such as a caul, little wings or membranes beneath his armpits, a tail or teeth; or he was born an orphan. There were practices intended to preserve the supernatural power of the newborn dragon. In the region of Veles, Macedonia, twelve girls would pick cotton, spin yarn from it, weave a cloth from the yarn, made a shirt from the cloth, and finally dress the dragon boy in the shirt. As thought in the region of Leskovac, Serbia, such a boy would only then become able to defeat an ala, when three old women spun yarn, knitted a shirt, and dressed the child in it. All this had to be done in one day and one night, during which time the three women should not have spoken a single word. A similar custom was recorded in western Bulgaria, where it was also believed that the soul of the boy, while he slept in his cradle, left his body and walked around. If he was turned, he would die, as his soul could not return into his body. According to a belief, the power of dragon boys was greatest at the time of their birth; the younger they were, the greater power they had. In a folk tale from eastern Serbia, a group of dragons surrounded an ala, which broke away and flew into a watermill. There was a woman in the mill with her baby, who was a dragon boy; he grabbed a stone and killed the ala with it. It was recorded in the region of Ni≈° that a winged dragon boy, in his fights with ale, \\"takes a plough beam and immediately stops the ala, and hail ceases.\\" The mother of a dragon boy wanted to make him an ordinary child by cutting off the winglets beneath his armpits, but that section resulted in the boy's death. As was thought in the ≈Ωupa basin and nearby areas, no one but the mother should see a dragon boy during the first seventeen days of his life; otherwise the child would die. If he survived, he would protect his village from hail, and at the age of seven he would fly away from home. It was also believed in ≈Ωupa that the dragon men lived alone, without contacts with other humans. Prophet Elijah was also regarded as a protector from the ale. As soon as he spotted an ala consuming the fertility of fields, he would summon dragons and harness them to his flying chariot. They then together attacked the demon, shooting fiery arrows at her. Instead of the dragons, the prophet could summon dragon men. They would then fall asleep, and their souls would rush to the thundering clouds to assist the prophet against the ale.Georgieva 1993, p. 136 A legend in the region of Leskovac has it that fighting the ale was originated by Prophet Elijah, when he, accompanied by a dragon boy, killed twelve of these demons.Zeƒçeviƒá 1981, p. 72 In the popular tradition of Slavic peoples, Prophet Elijah is a Christian replacement of the pagan Slavic thunder god Perun.Belova 2001, p. 223 Aesculapian snakes defended the fields and vineyards they inhabited from hail. These snakes could become dragons if they attained a certain age. Some animals could also be regarded as dragonlike, such as rams. It was said that a rooster, a gander, or a turkeycock could grow a pair of little wings beneath their natural wings, thus becoming powerful dragons. A dragon rooster dug a hole beneath the threshold of his owner's house. As soon as dark clouds appeared, the rooster would go into the hole, and his spirit would fly out from his body into the clouds to fight with ale. One day the owner killed the rooster, and immediately went mad. Another dragon rooster, with two combs, would fall to the ground and lie as if dead during thunderstorms.Radenkoviƒá 1996, p. 120 The Aesculapian snake (smuk in Serbian and smok in Bulgarian) was regarded as a very beneficial animal. People avoided disturbing it in any way. The Aesculapian snake which inhabited a crop field or a vineyard was seen as its guardian. The snake was said to fly into the hail clouds and drive them away from its field or yard, or it dispersed the clouds by raising its head high in the air and hissing as strong as it could.Trojanoviƒá 1983, pp. 141‚Äì42Georgieva 1993, p. 65 In the region of Ni≈°, the Aesculapian snakes were said to help the dragon boy in his fights against ale. If an Aesculapian snake attained a certain age, it would grow wings and become a dragon.Zeƒçeviƒá 1981, pp. 68‚Äì69 The dragon was regarded as a great lover and seducer of beautiful women, whom he visited by night, entering their houses down the chimney before turning into a man. The women who were visited by a dragon would after a while grow weak, pale and sunken-faced. There were magical methods to repel the dragon from them. It was believed that the children born out of such liaisons were physically and mentally ill, and that they would not live long.Georgieva 1993, p. 116 In another belief, the dragon would come for his son amidst thunder and lightning, and fly away with him. In the region of Bitola, it was told that such children were born with a tail. After they grew wings, they flew into the sky, from where they shot witches with thunderbolts. There was a belief in the region of Leskovac that the dragon boys, fighters against ale born with the little wings, were offspring of dragons. At the village of Kru≈°evo, Macedonia, people told of an old shepherd named Trail who was a son of a dragon. He was allegedly so strong that he could shatter cliffs, and when he shouted, his voice could be heard from miles away. Old Slavic mythology knew of men who were born out of relationships between women and dragons.Periƒá 2008, pp. 174‚Äì78Khalanski 1885, pp. 167‚Äì76 These men were endowed with prodigious strength and exceptional abilities. They could turn into a dragon and fly, which they usually did in crisis situations, like battles. Two such heroes are recorded in the Serbian epic poetry: Sekula Banoviƒá and Zmaj Ognjeni Vuk (\\"Fiery Dragon\\" Vuk). Both were late-medieval nobles and warriors, to whom mythical attributes were attached in the poetry. Their transformation into a dragon is described in three ways: the hero dresses his \\"dragon shirt\\"; he spreads his hidden wings; or he lets his soul out from his body in the form of a winged snake. The transformation may not be explicitly stated, but implied by a statement which indicates that the hero flies. Russian epic hero Volkh Vseslavevich is described as a son of a dragon; in folk poems, he transforms into a falcon, aurochs, wolf, and some other animals. In a couple of Serbian and Bulgarian folk poems, Saint Nicholas suddenly falls asleep, and while he sleeps, he saves ships from a storm.Georgieva 1993, p. 130Karad≈æiƒá 1845, pp. 99‚Äì101 In the popular tradition of Serbia, Bulgaria, and Macedonia, the ability to leave one's own body was also possessed by some cunning women who practised magic for healing. A widespread custom of these women was to yawn repeatedly during healing rituals. This indicated the egress of their soul, which entered the sick person's body to chase away disease-causing demonic entities. The rituals were accompanied by spells, in some of which the cunning women referred to their soul as a greyhound: \\"Run away, uroks, down gullies... The soul of Vida is a greyhound‚Äîshe overtakes the uroks and chokes them.\\" (An urok is a demonic entity, and Vida is the name of the cunning woman.) Related traditions The idea about the men with the inborn ability to leave their bodies in a spirit form, has also been recorded in Slovene and Croat traditions. The spirit could turn into a bull, dog, boar, or some other animal. He intercepted bringers of bad weather, and fought with them to save the crops of his village. The men with this ability were designated by various names, such as vedomec in Tolmin, mogut in Turopolje, vremenjak in Lika and Sinj, legromant or nagromant in southern Dalmatia and the area around Dubrovnik, vi≈°ƒáun in Dalmatia, and ≈°trigun in Istria. A vedomec fought against another vedomec, a mogut against another mogut, and so on, and the winner would take bad weather to the region of his defeated foe. All these men were marked by some peculiarity connected with their birth. There were also supernatural beings, such as obilnjaks and brgants in Slovenia, and kombals in Meƒëimurje, who clashed with each other during thunderstorms over the plenty of their territories.Radenkoviƒá 2001, pp. 393‚Äì95 A krsnik or kresnik was a man born with a caul, who could leave his body in spirit transformed into an animal. He fought demonic men called vukodlak (werewolves) and other evil agents. His victory meant that his village would have the abundance of all sorts of agricultural products.Ginzburg 1991, pp. 160‚Äì62 The krsnik was recorded in Istria, Gorski Kotar, the Kvarner Gulf, and parts of Slovenia.Radenkoviƒá 2001, pp. 303‚Äì5 The benandanti were men born with a caul recorded in the region of Friuli in north-eastern Italy. They periodically fought for the fertility of the fields against male and female witches.Ginzburg 1991, pp. 155‚Äì56 The t√°ltos, recorded in Hungary, were men and women born with teeth or some other physical peculiarity. They periodically fought each other in the shape of animals or flames. Their battles were often accompanied by storms. The winner would ensure abundant harvest for his village. The benandanti and the t√°ltos were initiated at a certain age into their vocation by an older member of the same group, who visited them in a vision. In Greek folklore, a stikhio (œÉœÑŒøŒπœáŒµŒØŒø) was a spirit that protected his territory against the adverse stikhio spirits from other territories. In Albanian mythology, a drangue is a semi-human hero with enormous strength and the power to fly; he was born with a caul. The main goal of the drangue is to fight the demon kulshedra, a huge multi-headed fire- spitting dragon. He uses meteoric stones, lightning-swords, thunderbolts, piles of trees and rocks to defeat the kulshedra and to protect mankind from storms, fire, floods and other natural disasters caused by her destructive power. Heavy thunderstorms are thought to be the result of the battle.Elsie 2001, pp. 74‚Äì75, 153‚Äì55 In Romanian folklore, there were no defenders against bad weather, which was produced by a gigantic flying serpentine creature called a balaur or a zmeu. A balaur could be controlled by an evil sorcerer called a ≈üolomonar, who was able to ride on that demon. The notion of a ≈üolomonar named a v√Ælva, who protected his village against attacks of v√Ælvas from other villages, was marginally encountered in some places of Romanian Banat.Plotnikova 2008, para. 3‚Äì6, 11‚Äì17 It was believed in southern Poland that clouds and hail were produced by creatures named p≈Çanetnik, chmurnik, or ob≈Çocznik: they compressed fog into clouds, and fragmented ice with iron flails into hailstones. They were considered to be the spirits of infants who had died without baptism, or the spirits of drowned and hanged people. Such spirits were seen in Serbia as bringers of hail clouds; they were addressed in folk spells, with which they were made to lead the clouds away from the village.Tolstoy & Tolstaya 1981, p. 48 According to other notions, p≈Çanetniks were persons who flew into the sky during storms. They could fly in spirit, while they were in deep sleep, or they could fly in body and soul. The p≈Çanetniks were friendly toward humans, often warning them about the approach of a storm or hail. They could direct the movement of clouds. Individuals who could leave their body in spirit during sleep were called burkudz√§ut√§ among the Ossetians of the Caucasus, and they were called mazzeri in parts of Corsica. The burkudz√§ut√§, mounted on animals or household objects, flew on a night between Christmas and New Year to burku, the land of the dead described as a great meadow. There they collected the seeds of agricultural plants and took them to their village, thus ensuring a rich harvest. The dead pursued and shot arrows at them as they flew back home. The wounded burkudz√§ut√§ would fall sick after the return, and some of them would die.Ginzburg 1991, pp. 163‚Äì64 The mazzeri of neighbouring villages fought each other in spirit on the night between 31 July and 1 August. The village of the defeated mazzeri would suffer more deaths during the next year.Ginzburg 1991, pp. 166‚Äì67 In the eastern Baltic region of Livonia, people designated as werewolves went underground in the shape of dogs to fight against sorcerers who stole the shoots of the grain. If the werewolves failed to wrest the shoots, there would be famine.Ginzburg 1991, p. 153 In Romania, strigoi were people born with a caul, which they donned upon reaching adulthood; this made them invisible. They then travelled in animal form to the meadow at the end of the world. There they fought each other all night, becoming reconciled in the morning. The reason for the fight is not specified. The Circassians told that, on a certain night of the year, their sorcerers fought with the sorcerers of the Abkhaz people, trying to suck each other's blood. In West Europe, medieval sources describe women who fell into trance on certain nights, abandoning their bodies in the form of an invisible spirit or animal. They then travelled to a gathering led by a female divinity who bestowed prosperity and knowledge. The divinity, semi-bestial or attended by animals, was known by various regional names, such as Holda, Perchta, Madonna Oriente, Richella, Bensozia, Dame Habonde, and Fairy Queen (in Scotland).Ginzburg 1991, pp. 96‚Äì100 She could be derived from Celtic goddesses like Epona, the Matres, and Artio.Ginzburg 1991, p. 211 In Sicily, women and girls had nocturnal meetings in spirit with the so-called Donni di fuora \\"women from the outside\\", which could be traced back to the ancient ecstatic cult of the Mothers of Engyon, of Cretan origin.Ginzburg 1991, pp. 122‚Äì24 The armier were men from Ari√®ge in the Pyrenees who could see and talk to the souls of the dead.Ginzburg 1991, p. 89 The mesultane were women and girls in Georgia who plunged into a lethargy and travelled in spirit to the land of the dead, to communicate with them.Ginzburg 1991, p. 194 Theories on origin The zduhaƒái, the dragon men, and the related folkloric figures of Europe can be compared with Eurasian shamans,Klaniczay 2006, pp. 216‚Äì17Georgieva 1993, p. 129 e.g., the noaidi of the Lapps, as well as the shamans of the Samoyeds and Tungus in Siberia.Ginzburg 1991, pp. 170‚Äì72 They were all able to leave their body in spirit to fight against the enemies of their community. The shamans also fought against each other, usually in animal form, for reasons such as to procure for their side as much reindeer as possible. However, for a shaman's soul to leave his body, he had to work himself into a state of ecstasy through a ceremony consisting of drumming, dancing, chanting, and even taking narcotics. All the zduhaƒái had to do was to fall asleep, although the unusual depth of their sleep indicates a state of ecstasy.Kordiƒá 1990, pp. 76‚Äì77 There are detailed and eventful descriptions of the journey of the shaman's soul, but no corresponding accounts exist in the case of the zduhaƒái. However, the zduhaƒái who left their bodies were said to have gone into the winds. This expression may contain an idea of a journey.Kordiƒá 1990, p. 71 Pavel Rovinski recorded the words he heard from his landlady in Montenegro on a windy night in March: \\"Listen, how they sing‚Äîthe travellers; they have gone high high! Happy journey to them!\\" The crucial difference between the shamans and their European counterparts lies in the fact that the ecstasy of the former was public, while that of the latter was always private. Historian Carlo Ginzburg asserts that \\"[t]his divergence stands starkly against a homogeneous background.\\" Ginzburg regards all of them as mediators with the realm of the dead, who are the \\"ambiguous dispensers of prosperity\\"; the ecstasy represents a temporary death.Ginzburg 1991, p. 186 The accounts in which the figures fly or fight materially rather than in spirit, are attempts \\"to describe an ecstatic experience perceived as absolutely real\\". Ginzburg argues, adopting a diffusionist approach, that the shamanistic elements of the European folkloric figures have their original source in the shamanism of Siberian nomads, and their diffusion was possibly mediated by the Scythians.Ginzburg 1991, pp. 212‚Äì13 Another possibility is that the shamanistic beliefs are derived from a common source. Their nucleus could have developed in a remote past from cultural interactions between the Proto-Indo-Europeans, speakers of the Proto-Uralic language, and ancient populations of the Caucasus.Ginzburg 1991, pp. 216‚Äì17 A third possibility is derivation from structural characteristics of the human mind. This is suggested by the persistence of the shamanistic phenomena over a long period, and their dispersion over a large area in culturally disparate societies. These three possibilities are not mutually exclusive. In literature In the novel Lelejska gora by Mihailo Laliƒá, set in Montenegro during the Second World War, there is a negative character, Kosto, nicknamed Zduvaƒç (a local variant of zduhaƒá.) Kosto is described as an elderly man of great strength. He says that when he lived in America the Italian Mafiosi called him Il Mago, \\"magician\\" or \\"sorcerer\\", which he translates as zduvaƒç. His Colt revolver is called Zduvaƒç's Spouter because it always hits its target. Kosto is killed by the main character of the novel in a brutal fight.Laliƒá 1969, pp. 341, 448‚Äì451 In a short story by Simo Matavulj, titled \\"Zduhaƒç\\", Matavulj acts as the companion and translator for a French vicomte who goes to hunt bears near a mountainous village in Old Herzegovina (part of Montenegro). One of their escort is Miƒáun, a burly young man from the village, who falls into a trance during a storm. The vicomte is given the explanation that Miƒáun, being a zduhaƒá, leaves his body to fight in the clouds against alien zduhaƒái. After an hour or two, the zduhaƒá wakes up exhausted. Another man of the escort asks him, \\"Was it good for us?\\" to which Miƒáun answers affirmatively. The vicomte concludes the story by quoting Hamlet's well-known lines about the secret things of heaven and earth (Hamlet, 1.5.188‚Äì89).Matavulj 1917, pp. 62‚Äì68 See also *Gradobranitelj, man in Serbia who used magic to protect his village from bad weather Notes References    .

He led the brigade at the Battle of Briar Creek on March 3, 1779, Battle of Heron's Bridge on January 30, 1780, and Battle of Webber's Bridge on August 17, 1780. In January 1780, he was responsible for building breastworks in defense of Charleston, South Carolina. He and his troops were discharged from these duties well before the surrender of the city in March of 1780. Except for a period where he took a leave of absence in the summer of 1781, he retained the command of the Brigade until the end of the war. Political career He served as a representative from New Hanover County in the North Carolina House of Commons in 1777. Death He died in April 1786 in New Hanover County, North Carolina (in the area that later became Pender County, North Carolina). He was buried in the Lillington Cemetery, Rocky Point, Pender County, North Carolina. Namesakes The town of Lillington, county seat of Harnett County, North Carolina, was named for him in 1874. The town was originally called Harnett Court House. References  Bibliography  *Purcell, L. Edward. Who Was Who in the American Revolution. New York: Facts on File, 1993. .

S., & Robertson, G. J. (2006). Wide Range Achievement Test 4 professional manual. Lutz, FL: Psychological Assessment Resources. The test currently is in its fourth revision. A fifth version has been released. The test was developed in 1941 by psychologists Sidney W. Bijou and Joseph Jastak.Reynolds, Cecil R.; and Fletcher-Janzen, Elaine. \\"Encyclopedia of special education\\", p. 248. John Wiley & Sons, 2007. . Accessed July 23, 2009. The test is appropriate for individuals ages 5‚Äì94 years. The WRAT4 provides two equivalent forms (Blue and Green), which enables retesting within short periods of time without potential practice effects that occur from repeating the same items. The alternate forms also may be administered together in a single examination. The Wide Range Achievement Test 4 (WRAT4) is the latest offering in a test series first published in 1946. The various editions of the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) have enjoyed widespread use in a variety of settings as a measure of the basic academic skills necessary for effective learning, communication, and thinking: reading and spelling words and performing basic mathematical calculations. An added feature in the WRAT4 is a Reading Composite Score. Previous versions of the WRAT4 included WRAT III. Description WRAT pre- and post-test results for experimental and control groups. The Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) is a brief achievement test measuring reading recognition, spelling, and arithmetic computation. There are two levels; level I is normed for children ages 0‚Äì5 to 6-11; level II is normed for children aged 12 through their adult age 94. Scoring Norms provided for the 1978 edition include standard scores with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15, percentile scores, and grade levels. The standard scores are scaled based on the norm group; the grade levels are arbitrarily assigned and can be interpreted only as rough references to achievement level. Only standard scores should be used for comparisons among scores. Reliability The manual reports split-half reliabilities of .98 for Reading at both levels, .94 for Arithmetic at both levels, .96 for Spelling I, and .97 for Spelling II. During the norming study, both levels of the WRAT were administered to children ages 9 through 14. Since there is overlap in skills tested between the high end of level I and the low end of level II, this provides another estimate of the reliability of both. On Reading and Spelling, split-half reliabilities ranged from .88 to .94 for different age groups; on Arithmetic they ranged from .79 to .89. These results indicate that overall the reliability of the WRAT is excellent. Validity The test most similar to the WRAT is the Peabody Individual Achievement Test (PIAT), another short, individually administered test which covers comparable material. In general the WRAT correlates very highly with the PIAT. The WRAT correlates moderately with various IQ tests, in the range of .40 to .70 for most groups and most tests. Norms The 1978 WRAT norms are based on 15,200 subjects for seven states. According to the manual, no attempt was made to make the sample representative of national characteristics. The manual states that minorities were represented, but gives no data on their representation. The sample was stratified by age, sex, and approximately by ability. Suggested uses Recommended uses for the test described in the manual include comparing achievement of one person to another, determining learning ability or learning disability, comparing codes with comprehension in order to prescribe remedial programs, and informally assessing error patterns to plan instructional programs.

It is the first closed-cockpit sports prototype built by Lola since the 1992 T92/10. It started competition in 2008, with Aston Martin being among the first customers for their entry into the LMP1 category in Le Mans Series, albeit entering under Charouz Racing System banner. Development Announced in late 2006, the B08/60 had been developed following not only Peugeot's introduction of their closed-cockpit coupe, the 908 HDi FAP, but also the Automobile Club de l'Ouest's (ACO) announcement of rule changes in 2010 that would have allowed only closed-cockpit LMP1s at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Lola set out to build a car that could compete with the aerodynamic advantages of the 908 and other planned coupes, while preparing for the 2010 rule changes beforehand. The design of the B08/60 shares many elements with its predecessor, the B06/10, with notable exception of the closed versus open cockpits. The nose and sidepods feature similar cooling and venting structures as the B06/10, while a slightly larger nose is based on the 2007-spec designs offered by Lola. Phil Tiller was in charge of the B08/60's aerodynamics, and developed the narrow cockpit. Integrated in the cockpit design are a roof-mounted air intake for the engine. The shoulders of the cockpit are also designed in a stepped fashion. 2008 1000 km of Silverstone The B08/60's design has also been aided by a partnership between Lola, Fluent, Inc., and AMD. The two firms provide engineering software and hardware respectively. Wind tunnel testing of scale models had been carried out since early 2007, with multiple shapes being analysed before the first car was completed in December. During the development of the B08/60, Lola also approved the development of an LMP2 variant of the design. This car, known as B08/80, shares many elements from the B08/60, but better adapted to the LMP2 regulations which saw smaller engines, lower speeds, and generally smaller teams competing. Competition In November 2007 Aston Martin reached an agreement with Lola to purchase the first B08/60 and installing the 6.0-litre V12 from the DBR9 race car. This is Aston Martin's first attempt at running a sports-prototype since the AMR1 in 1989. Prodrive, Aston Martin's racing partner, chose Charouz Racing System to run the new team for a full entry in the Le Mans Series and 24 Hours of Le Mans. The B08/60 was not designed with the Aston V12 engine in mind, so the standard Lola gearbox had to be replaced by a more compact X-trac 6 speed. The Lola Aston Martin gained further advantage from a regulation change that gives production-derived engines bigger air restrictors. During the 2008 LMS season the Charouz Lola proved to be the fastest petrol car on the grid, although it still could not match the diesels. At 2008 Le Mans the B08/60 outqualified the No.1 Audi but a collision and subsequent repairs dropped them to the back. The spirited drive back to the front was rewarded with 9th overall. In Silverstone later in the year Charouz finished as high as 2nd overall, behind an Audi. Charouz Racing finished 5th in the 2008 LMS championship. Further B08/60s will be available to other customers, with a variety of engines able to be adapted to fit the chassis. The B08/60 also forms the basis for the Lola-Aston Martin B09/60, co-developed by Lola and Prodrive. The B08/60 would be run by the Speedy Sebah racing team throughout the 2009 LMS season. For 2010 Rebellion Racing ran 2 modified B08/60, dubbed the B10/60. The old Aston V12 was replaced by Rebellion 5.5 L V10. At Le Mans, lap times were 8 seconds slower compared to Charouz 2 years earlier. The B08/60 was entered for the full American Le Mans Series season in 2010 by Drayson Racing. It won its first race from the pole in the hands of Jonny Cocker and Paul Drayson at the Road America 500. The Drayson Lola was restricted due to ALMS rules bringing LMP1 and LMP2 cars on par, trying to achieve the same pace between both class. During 2012 and 2013, the Lola B08/60 ran in upgraded form as the Lola B12/60. Two teams ran the LMP1 chassis: Rebellion Racing in the FIA World Endurance Championship and Dyson Racing in the American Le Mans Series. Dyson Racing also ran a 2011-spec B11/66 in the shorter events.

Plot Jerry mixes and drinks a potion as the title card and credits are shown. After Jerry drinks the potion, he discovers that it gives him the power of superspeed; he tests this out by eating Tom's canister of sardines, along with the last bit of gravy and bits of his skin. Afterwards, Tom initially assumes that a ghost was eating his food, but concludes that it is a bug equipped with a jetpack and chattery teeth. Tom slips a large watermelon slice around the corner and readies a flyswatter. Jerry mows through all of the watermelon flesh, and ends up leaving poor Tom to start scattering the rind and seeds around. When Tom sees an entire turkey being eaten, he panics and takes a grape cluster and an apple from the table. This is when Jerry proceeds to eat the apple down to the core and the rest of the fruit and the grapes. After going berserk, Tom hides in the refrigerator and attempts to eat a stack of ribs, which Jerry proceeds to eat. Tom then sets out a cake and films Jerry stealing it so he can see who is taking his food. After witnessing the filmed proof that Jerry is behind the charades, Tom sets up a mousetrap sandwich for Jerry, who does take the bait, but does not trigger the trap. When Tom triggers the trap from attempting to bite Jerry, Tom gets his nose caught in the trap and yells in pain and hits himself into the chandelier. When Jerry takes a banana from the refrigerator, Tom grabs the banana and peels the skin. Jerry taunts him by kissing his nose then runs off, but when the effects of the potion wear off, Jerry barely escapes Tom. Jerry attempts to recreate the superspeed potion, but accidentally creates an enlargement potion, which enlarges its consumer to an unbelievably large size. Tom catches Jerry's tail and somehow manages to pull him through the wall. When Tom can no longer tug the load around, he turns around to see the mega- Jerry sadistically raising his eyebrows and waving at him.

After several delays, construction work on the inner section of the freeway began in 2006 and was opened to traffic in January 2011. The western terminus of the Crosby Freeway connects to the I-610 and I-10 interchange via two freeway ramps: *a ramp from westbound Crosby Freeway, joining an exit ramp from westbound I-10 to enter southbound I-610 *a newly constructed two-lane exit ramp from eastbound I-10 connecting to eastbound Crosby Freeway. The previous interchange was a four-level stack interchange though the new interchange is not a full five-level stack. Because of funding constraints, two sections of the freeway inside Beltway 8 were not built to full freeway standards: a half-mile section over Greens Bayou and an approximately mile-long section east of Normandy Street. As of December 2012, only the feeder roads have been constructed, with space reserved in the median for future freeway mainlanes. Unlike most new freeway extensions in the Houston area built in recent decades, the Crosby Freeway is not tolled. Also unlike most of Houston's existing freeways and tollways, the Crosby Freeway does not have continuous feeder roads. The Crosby Freeway has four to six mainlanes for its entire length. Houston to Louisiana The US 90 (Beaumont Highway when inside of Beltway 8 or Crosby Freeway when outside of Beltway 8) heads northeast leaving Houston and ends its freeway status in Crosby. US 90 then continues traveling east through Beaumont and is locally known as College Street, passes by Baptist Hospital Beaumont and meets I-10 at a T-interchange. It then passes through Orange and has a business route (Business US 90-Y). It then crosses the Sabine River into Louisiana towards Lake Charles. With the exception of an section with only two (briefly three) lanes between Liberty and Devers, US 90 has at least four lanes between Crosby and the Louisiana state line.

It has two distinct dialects: Tosk, spoken in the south, and Gheg, spoken in the north. However many Albanians speak Italian, Greek, French, German, English amongst other languages too, due to the high numbers of Albanian diaspora and Albanian communities throughout the Balkans. Albania is one of the most polyglot nations in Europe. Many Albanians at home, in the region and around the world speak more than two languages. Italian is widely spoken throughout Albania. Greek, the language of the Greek national minority is focused in southern Albania, however many Albanian nationals command the Greek language due to immigration. Nowadays, knowledge of English is growing very rapidly, especially among the youth. Various languages are spoken by ethnic minorities: Greek, Aromanian, Macedonian, etc. Status of Albanian The Article 14 of the Albanian Constitution states that \\"The official language in the Republic of Albania is Albanian.\\" According to the 2011 population census, 2,765,610, 98.767% of the population declared Albanian as their mother tongue (\\"mother tongue is defined as the first or main language spoken at home during childhood\\"). Dialects Standard Albanian is based in the Tosk dialect, spoken in the south. Gheg is spoken in the north and also by Kosovo Albanians and in Croatia Arbanasi, Upper Reka dialect, Istrian. The traditional border between the two dialects is the Shkumbin River. Although they are somewhat different, they are mutually intelligible. Other notable varieties, all of which are sub-dialects of Tosk, include Lab, Cham, Arb√´resh spoken in Italy and Arvanitika, Arvanitic in Southern Greece. Minority languages Traditional presence of non-Albanian populations Location of communities in Albania classified by language and religion Greek Wall writing in Dh√´rmi. The text reads Welcome to Drymades in Greek. Greek is the largest minority language of Albania and first largest foreign language. Because the number of Greeks in Albania is disputed, the exact number of native speakers of Greek is unknown. The Greeks of Albania speak a modern southern Greek dialect, known as Northern Epirote Greek.Appendix A. History & Diatopy of Greek. The story of pu: The grammaticalisation in space and time of a Modern Greek complementiser. December 1998. University of Melbourne.Nick Nicholas. Alongside Albanian loanwords, it retains some archaic forms and words that are no longer used in Standard Modern Greek, as well as in the Greek dialects of southern Epirus. Despite the relatively small distances between the various towns and villages, there exists some dialectal variation,Encyclopedia of the stateless nations: ethnic and national groups around the world.

Nata≈°a Gregoriƒç Bon. Nova Gorica 2008. In addition, many Albanians have knowledge of Greek, mainly due to past immigration to Greece. Greek is co-official in numerous municipalities and regions in Southern Albania. Aromanian Aromanian is the native language for about 100,000 to 200,000 Aromanians of Albania.According to INTEREG - quoted by Eurominority : Aromanians in Albania , Albania's Aromanians; Reemerging into HistoryArno Tanner. The forgotten minorities of Eastern Europe: the history and today of selected ethnic groups in five countries. East-West Books, 2004 , p. 218: \\"In Albania, Vlachs are estimated to number as many as 200,000\\" They mostly live in the southern and central regions of the country. The Aromanians, under the name \\"Vlachs\\", are a recognized cultural minority in the Albanian law. Macedonian According to the 1989 census, there were approximately 5,000 Macedonian language-speakers in Albania. Most of these people live in the southeastern part of the country in the Lake Prespa region. Macedonians are an officially recognized minority in the Pustec Municipality. However, only the Macedonians living in Pustec are allowed to declare their nationality and language. Ethnic Macedonian organization claim that 120,000 to 350,000 Macedonians live in Albania. They are politically represented by the Alliance of Macedonians for European Integration, which in the 2011 elections received around 2,500 votes. Romani About 10,000 Romani people live in Albania today. They have preserved the language, despite the lack of education in that language. Serbo-Croatian Serbo-Croatian is mostly spoken and understood in northern Albania, near the border of former Yugoslavian countries of Serbia and Montenegro. The television phenomenon of Italian also happened to Serbo- Croatian, but to a lesser extent. Foreign languages The most-widely foreign languages spoken in Albania are English, Italian and Greek. A new study carried out by Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, analyzed the demography of the adult population 25-64 of several european countries as of 2016. The results of the Adult Education Survey, released in May 2018, showed that the 39.9% of the 25‚Äì64 years old is able to use at least one foreign language. The main foreign language known is English with 40.0%, followed by Italian with 27.8% and Greek with 22.9%. The English speakers were mostly young people, the knowledge of Italian is stable in every age group, while there is a decrease of the speakers of Greek in the youngest group. Italian Italian is by far the best-known foreign language in Albania and used to have official status when the country was a protectorate of Italy. Most Italian-speakers have not learnt the language in classrooms or from books, but rather by watching Italian television. During the late communist regime, Albanians living in the towns along the Adriatic Sea coast had access to Italian television. Many Albanians \\"grew skilled at rewiring their TVs to overcome [the] Albanian government's attempt to block Italian channels\\". A large number of middle-aged and younger people grew up with the language and know it very well. Among the elderly, Italian is also common as the language was used in the educational system in the 1930s, after King Zog released a decree requiring all Albanian schools to teach Italian in 1933. Albania also is home to 19,000 ethnic Italians, who have aided the growth of the language in the country. English English is mostly popular among the younger generations of Albanians. As of 2006, more than 65% of Albanian children could speak fluent or semi-fluent English. The language came to Albania in 1921, when the Albanian Vocational School started to teach English with the sponsorship of the American Red Cross. The school operated until 1933. The Albanian Government at the time decided to make English the country's second language. Russian became the major language taught in schools after the Communists took control over the country. After the Soviet-Albanian Split in the 1960s, English came to compete with Russian. A 2006 book by Mimoza Rista- Dema, a Ph.D. in Linguistics at Indiana University, describes the teaching of English during the communist era: Other French lyc√©es in Kor√ß√´ and Gjirokast√´r operated during the communist era, because long-time leader of Communist Albania, Enver Hoxha studied in the University of Montpellier in France and upon his rise to power allowed their activity. Albania is a member of la Francophonie. Most French-speakers in Albania can be found in these two towns and surrounding areas, but also elsewhere in the country. According to La Francophonie, Albania is home to 300,000 French speakers. Russian began to be taught in schools and universities in the 1950s, when it was lingua franca of the Eastern Bloc countries. It continued until the Soviet‚ÄìAlbanian split in early 1961. Many who learnt in at the time, have forgotten most of it due to lack of usage. After the ideological controversies with the USSR, Albania and China became closer. A number of Albanians studied in China and learnt Chinese there. After the collapse of communism in Albania in 1991, many young Albanians also traveled to China for education and learned the language. Other European languages are also present in Albania and spoken by Albanians. This is primarily due to the large Albanian diaspora that exists in Europe as well as strong emphasis on foreign languages in education.

The highway runs through many small communities with Austin being the only major city along its route. The highway exits Texas concurrent with US 70, crossing into Oklahoma. Route description US 183 begins concurrent with US 77 Alt at its southern terminus one block north of downtown Refugio at an intersection with US 77; the two highways subsequently travel north through mostly rural farmlands across the Gulf Coastal Plains. After serving the Presidio La Bah√≠a, US 183 crosses the San Antonio River to serve the Goliad State Park and Historic Site and the city of Goliad, intersecting US 59 in the center of town. Traveling through additional farmlands and forests, US 183 eventually forms a concurrency with US 87 just before crossing the Guadalupe River and travels along Espalande Street through downtown Cuero, ending its concurrency of US 87 in the town center. North of Cuero, US 77 Alt splits off to the northeast, while US 183 continues parallel to the Guadalupe River's course. The highway cuts through the historic Battle of Gonzales site and borders the city of Gonzales to the west, intersecting US 90 Alt to the northwest of the city. Running parallel to the San Marcos River, US 183 provides access to Palmetto State Park before crossing I-10 and forming a concurrency with US 90 west to Luling via Pierce Street. In the center of Luling, US 183 leaves US 90 and turns onto Magnolia Avenue, traveling due north past many decorated oil wells. Continuing through rural farmlands, US 183 eventually enters Lockhart, being the main north-south route through the city. The highway then merges onto the SH 130 frontage roads just north of Lockhart, following them until Mustang Ridge where SH 130 splits northeast to follow SH 45 and US 183 continues north into Colton and Pilot Knob. As US 183 crosses into Austin and intersects several local roads providing access to McKinney Falls State Park, it borders the west side of Austin-Bergstrom International Airport before having an interchange with SH 71 and enters Austin's Montopolis district. US 183 crosses the Colorado River adjacent to the old Montopolis truss bridge prior to serving a major fork east of the Govalle district, making a sigmoid curve east to serve the Colony Park district. US 183 eventually becomes a six-lane freeway north of the Windsor Park district just before crossing US 290, curving west to serve I-35 and Loop 275 (Lamar Boulevard); north of Lamar Boulevard, US 183 is redesignated as Research Boulevard throughout the rest of its length in Austin. The highway makes another sigmoid curve to the north before an interchange with Loop 1 (Mopac Expressway). After an interchange with Loop 360 (Capital of Texas Highway), US 183 serves much of northwest Austin. It eventually intersects SH 45 near Lakeline Mall and becomes a surface street while the freeway continues on the east side as 183A Toll Road. US 183 continues as Bell Boulevard through west Cedar Park before intersecting 183A in Leander. Continuing north, US 183 runs mostly through forests and farmland as it crosses the North and South Forks of the San Gabriel River. After turning through several hills east of the Texas Hill Country, US 183 bounds northwest into Lampasas, where it runs on Key Avenue concurrent with US 190 and US 281 through fourteen blocks in the city's downtown and recreational areas before splitting to the northwest from US 281 north of Lampasas. US 183 and US 190 continue traveling northwest through rolling hills, eventually splitting southeast of the Lometa city limits. US 183 continues to run parallel to the Colorado River before beginning a concurrency with US 84 north of the Goldthwaite city limits. The two highways continue northwest for a long distance before reaching Early and joining US 67 and US 377 at the town's center. The four highways travel west for roughly eleven blocks before US 183 splits to the north and serves Brownwood Regional Airport. US 183 continues due north, crossing SH 36 in Rising Star and later I-20 just south of Cisco. South of Throckmorton, US 283 joins the highway, an overlap that lasts until Vernon, where 183 joins US 70 and US 287. In Oklaunion, US 70 and 183 leave US 287 and cross the Red River together into Oklahoma. Research Boulevard, Anderson Lane, and Ed Bluestein Boulevard in Austin Through 1990, none of US 183 through Austin was built to freeway standards. By 2002, the portion of US 183, known as Research Boulevard, had been upgraded to a freeway. At that time, Research Boulevard, between Spicewood Springs Road and Cameron Road, was built as a viaduct with grade separated limited access. The northern freeway portion between Spicewood Springs Road and Bell Boulevard in Cedar Park, was completed by 2003. The southern freeway portion between Cameron Road and US 290, became completed in 2012. In Cedar Park, the limited access portion of Research Boulevard would become the 183A Toll Road, as US 183 would serve as a major arterial through the city as Bell Boulevard. The toll road opened in March 2007. The roads rejoin north of Leander. In 2015, it was announced work would start on the conversion of the then-55-year-old portion of US 183 from US 290 to SH 71 into a three-to-five-lane tollway. The traffic lights at 51st Street, Techni Center Drive, Bolm Road (formerly a diamond interchange), Vargas Road, and Thompson Lane were all removed. In addition to these changes, an interchange at Patton Avenue is being constructed, the pedestrian crossing bridge just south of Manor Road will be upgraded, and Montopolis Bridge was decommissioned in favor of a new truss bridge that will serve as a pedestrian walkway, no longer open to motorized traffic. Construction began in early 2016 with expected completion in late 2019 or early 2020. The first section of the tollway opened on July 31, 2019, at which point the rest of the project was to be completed by late 2020.

It was first published by TSR in 1982 and was designed as a stand-alone adventure for use with the Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set. The working title for the module was \\"The Lost City of Cynidecia\\".Basic Series. Acaeum. Retrieved 14 December 2008. Moldvay designed the module as a low-level scenario to give novice Dungeon Masters experience in fleshing out adventures such that it is only partially complete. The plot involves the player characters discovering a ruined subterranean city slowly rising out of the sands. (preview) The adventure is set inside a huge step pyramid, with the lower pyramid only sketched out and the city itself described with a list of the major areas and a map. The adventure's main villain is Zargon, a giant one-eyed monster and his minions. The entire double pyramid, not including the city, contains over 100 rooms. This module includes a cover folder with maps and a descriptive booklet with ready-made adventurers for the Dungeons & Dragons Basic Game. It also includes enough information to continue the adventure beyond level 3, using the Dungeons & Dragons Expert Game rules. This adventure was partially reprinted in the supermodule compilation B1-9 In Search of Adventure (1985), which included only the upper pyramid and was set in the Mystara campaign setting. Plot summary The adventure follows a city buried in the desert, which is torn between warring factions. Much of the adventure takes place within a huge step pyramid. Other areas of the city are merely outlined, with suggestions provided for the DM to provide detail. At the beginning of the adventure, the characters become lost in a desert sandstorm and stumble upon the entrance to a pyramid. The pyramid and the underground city beneath it are located on the site of the ancient ruined city of Cynidicea and inhabited by the descendants of the city's people. These Cynidiceans, now regressed to a subterranean species, are addicted to narcotics and spend most of their time in drug-induced reveries, wandering around in costumes and masks. As the adventure progresses, the characters discover that a monster known as Zargon was responsible for the downfall of Cynidicea. The monster still lives, and a cult of evil human priests and various other monsters has grown up around it. Besides the priests of Zargon, there also exist three other factions of relatively normal Cynidiceans. They worship the city's ancient Gods and are dedicated to the overthrow of the priests of Zargon and the restoration of Cynidicea's lost glory, but their diverging faiths have disallowed them from working together against their common enemy. Although only the upper half of the pyramid is detailed, enough information on the lower half and the underground city is provided for the DM to expand the adventure. After clearing the upper pyramid the players can become involved in the struggle for Cynidicea and, if they grow powerful enough, confront Zargon in his lair and destroy him. Publication history The Lost City was written by Tom Moldvay and illustrated by Jim Holloway. It was published by TSR in 1982 as a 32-page book with an outer folder; the first printing was 3-hole punched. Dragon magazine revisited the setting with \\"Mystara: Return to the Lost City\\" in issue #315. The module was the inspiration for a 3rd edition D&D; adventure, \\"Masque of Dreams,\\" which was printed in Dungeon #142. The adventure was written by B. Matthew Conklin and illustrated by Michael William Kaluta. Zargon and the Cynidiceans received a re-interpretation in the 3.5 edition product, Elder Evils, which places the temple in the default, Greyhawk-like setting. Goodman Games has announced the fourth entry into their licensed Original Adventures Reincarnated line of 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons hardcovers to be an update to B4 The Lost City at Gen Con 2019, aiming for a Summer 2020 release. At the Gen Con panel, staff working on the project said they would greatly expand on the original module, fully mapping out and stocking the parts of the module which were only mentioned, and originally left to the Dungeon Master to expand upon. As such, Goodman Games claims the publication will feature enough content to be a campaign setting unto itself. Reception The Lost City was ranked the 28th greatest adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine for the 30th anniversary of the Dungeons & Dragons game in 2004. Ken Denmead of Wired included the module as an installment in his column \\"Top 10 D&D; Modules I Found in Storage This Weekend\\". According to Denmead, \\"with this module, things are clearly detailed to a certain point, and then the rest is left for the DM to \\"Expand the Adventure,\\" including a final confrontation with the evil \\"God\\" who helped bring down the civilization, and eventual discovery of the remnants of the people living a strange, drug-addled life of mushroom farming beside a subterranean lake.\\" Further reading Review: Different Worlds #28 (1983) References External links * The Lost City at the TSR Archive *http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/reviews/rev_4114.html Category:1982 books Category:Dungeons & Dragons modules Category:Mystara ","title":"The Lost City (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)"},{"id":"11717089","text":"Herbert Roberts may refer to: * Herbie Roberts (1905‚Äì1944), English footballer * Herbert Roberts (footballer) (1890‚Äì?), Australian footballer for Melbourne * Ray Roberts (full name Herbert Ray Roberts) (1913‚Äì1992), US congressman ","title":"Herbert Roberts"},{"id":"11717108","title":"The Beast (Vader album)"},{"id":"11717115","text":"Jay Firestone (born 13 October 1956) is a Canadian film and television producer.

As a young man during the Second World War, Skynner was a Royal Air Force (RAF) pilot who flew the Mosquito twin-engined fighter bomber, and the destruction he was obliged to participate in drew him to psychiatry. Trained in group analysis and working as child psychiatrist and family therapist, he employed group-analytic principles in that therapeutic modality. He was a gifted teacher and practitioner of psychotherapy with individuals, groups, families, couples and institutions. He was also a prolific writer. Biography Born on 16 August 1922 at Charlestown, St Austell, Cornwall, Skynner was the eldest of five boys. He was educated at St Austell County School and at Blundell's School, after which, at the age of 18, he volunteered for the Royal Air Force, and was selected as a prospective bomber pilot. He was adversely affected by the destruction and slaughter he was obliged to participate in, an experience that, for a variety of complex reasons, drew him to psychiatry as an eventual vocation. After demobilisation from RAF service, Skynner enrolled as a student at University College Hospital and qualified MB, BS (Lond) in 1952. He then began his psychiatric training. In 1957 he passed the Diploma of Psychological Medicine. In 1971, he was elected MRCPsych, proceeding FRCPsych in 1976. He was successively the Director of the Woodberry Down Child Guidance Unit, Physician-in Charge of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children, Senior Tutor in Psychotherapy at the Institute of Psychiatry and Honorary Associate Consultant at the Maudsley Hospital. Dr. Foulkes, a psychoanalyst and psychiatrist, was one of the founders of group analysis in Britain, a group approach developed out of Foulkes's treatment of war victims in Northfield Hospital, Birmingham. Foulkes was a pioneer, and quickly attracted the attention of others keen to change the way mental health patients were dealt with. Skynner was intrigued by Foulkes and by the early stages of the therapeutic community movement which was beginning to gather strength. He became Foulkes's pupil and later his patient in a group. Robin Skynner would readily admit he needed treatment himself. In 1959, together with fellow disciples of Dr. Foulkes, Skynner founded the Group Analytic Practice, which specialises in group, family and marital therapy. A logical development was the emergence of the Institute of Group Analysis for the specific purpose of giving training in group therapy. However, it was Skynner himself who in 1977 founded the Institute of Family Therapy and chaired it for the next two years. Skynner subsequently worked with adults and children of an unusually wide range of socio-economic status, from the poorest districts of the East End of London to private practice. His chief interest was the practice and teaching of psychotherapy, with individuals, groups, families, couples and institutions. The important posts he successfully filled were senior tutor (psychotherapy) at the Institute of Psychiatry, honorary assistant consultant psychiatrist at Bethlem Royal and Maudsley Hospital and physician in charge of the Department of Psychiatry at Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children, London. Skynner married twice: from 1948 to 1959 to Geraldine Foley; then, in 1959 he married, Prudence Fawcett, who died in 1987. He is buried alongside Prudence in Highgate Cemetery London. He is survived by a son, a daughter and four grandchildren. Therapeutic techniques Skynner emphasised three main principles in family therapy: #The importance of facilitating communication within the family. #The need for a clear authority structure or familial hierarchy. #The centrality of individual developmental life-stages in the family problems.D. Capuzzi, Foundations of Couples, Marriage, and Family Counselling (2015) p. 134 Using transference and countertransference as therapeutic tools, he worked to change family power structures so as to increase order and clarity, and encouraged the taking back of psychological projections to avoid the scapegoating and delinquency of the projections' carrier.S.

It is also known as the Lloyd M. Bentsen Highway in honor of the late Democratic U.S. senator from Texas, who served from 1971‚Äì1992. This sign is located near Freer, the seat of Duval County east of Laredo. U.S. Highway 59 (US 59) in the U.S. state of Texas is named the Lloyd Bentsen Highway, after Lloyd Bentsen, former U.S. senator from Texas. In northern Houston, US 59, co-signed with Interstate 69 (I-69), is the Eastex Freeway (from Downtown Houston to the Liberty County/Montgomery County line). To the south, which is also co-signed with I-69, it is the Southwest Freeway (from Rosenberg to Downtown Houston). The stretch of the Southwest Freeway just west of The Loop was formerly one of the busiest freeways in North America, with a peak AADT of 371,000 in 1998. US 59 (overlapped by US 71) actually straddles the border between Texas and Arkansas north of I-30 near Texarkana, with the east side of the highway on the Arkansas side and the west side of the highway on the Texas side. In the past, both highways remained on the border past I-30 as State Line Avenue to downtown Texarkana; today, only US 71 does so. Nearly 90 percent of this route is designated to become part of I-69 in the future. Currently speed limits are allowed on US 59 in Duval County and portions of northern Polk County. The total length of the southernmost segment of US 59 that passes through Texas and terminates at the Mexico‚ÄìUS border is . History The US 96 designation was originally applied in 1926 from Rosenberg, Texas, near Houston, to Pharr in the Rio Grande valley. This diagonal route, south of U.S. 90, did not violate the convention of even numbers for east-west routes. The highway's east-west nature was boosted in 1934 when US 96 was rerouted from Alice to Laredo. Route description Laredo to Interstate 37 US 59 begins at the Mexico‚ÄìUS border with Loop 20 on the World Trade International Bridge over the Rio Grande in Laredo. The portion of US 59 that is co-signed with Loop 20 is also named the Bob Bullock Loop. At under 2 miles, the two highways run together concurrent with I-69W from the Mexico‚ÄìUS border until I-35 in Laredo, where I-69W temporarily ends. US 59 and Loop 20 continue to run together until just south of Lake Casa Blanca, where Loop 20 heads south to Mangana-Hein Road (and potentially into Mexico) and US 59 heads towards Freer; traveling in a mostly northeast direction. US 59 shares a short congruency with SH 44 in and around Freer. From Freer, US 59 passes through the southeastern part of McMullen County, but does not intersect any highways. The highway continues northeast, intersecting US 281 in George West, before intersecting I-37 about 55 miles north of Corpus Christi. Between Laredo and Interstate 37, US 59 passes through many rural areas and ranching sites. A significant portion of US 59 in Texas has a 75 MPH speed limit. Interstate 37 to Houston From I-37, US 59 heads northeast passing through Beeville. US 59 bypasses Victoria to the south, and becomes a divided highway, and has a series of interchanges, until it becomes a freeway south of Houston in Rosenberg and resumes the designation of I-69. Between Houston and Victoria, US 59 passes through Edna, Ganado, El Campo, and Wharton. US 59 intersects many major Texas highways in Houston, including I-10 (which goes to San Antonio and Beaumont) and I-45 (which goes to Dallas and Galveston). Houston to Marshall Leaving Houston, US 59 intersects Beltway 8 again on the northside of town, passing by Bush Intercontinental Airport and heads into Humble. Between Houston and Livingston, most of US 59 is a limited-access freeway but the I-69 designation temporarily ends at the Montgomery-Liberty county line. US 59 passes through or bypasses the towns of Cleveland and Livingston. 46 miles north of Livingston, US 59 bypasses Lufkin, where it overlaps US 69. 10 miles north of Lufkin, US 59 bypasses Nacogdoches and heads in an almost entirely east-west direction. Drivers wishing to stay on US 59 must turn left in Tenaha, where the highway intersects US 96 and ends its overlap with US 84. US 59 passes through Carthage before intersecting I-20 south of Marshall. Marshall to Texarkana US 59 intersects US 80 in Marshall, where US 59 is known as East End Boulevard (due to the fact the highway runs on the east side of town, near the city limits). US 59 passes through Jefferson, 15 miles west of Caddo Lake. US 59 passes through the towns of Linden and Atlanta before arriving in Bowie County. US 59 intersects SH 93 south of Texarkana, the old highway through the city. Shortly after, I-369 designation with US 59 when the freeway intersects Spur 151, where US 59 becomes a freeway on the westside of the city. Before US 59 intersects I-30, and overlaps I-30 until exit 223B, at the state line, I-369 designation ends. After leaving I-30, US 59 joins US 71, where both highways run on the state line between Texas and Arkansas, where both highways continue north towards DeQueen, Arkansas. Future US 59 is in the process of being upgraded between Laredo & Victoria, to become I-69W; Between Victoria & Tenaha, as I-69; and Tenaha & Texarkana, I-369. Segments of I-69 are currently designated: I-69W runs between Mexico and I-35, I-69 runs through the Houston Metro, and a segment of I-369 exists on the west side of Texarkana. The entire I-69 project in Texas does not have a completion date but according to AASHTO rules should be within 25 years of initial signage for each Segment of Independent Utility.

Route description The junction of US Highways 69 and 80 in Mineola, Texas US 69 begins at its southern terminus with SH 87 in Port Arthur. This intersection is also the southern terminus for US 96 and US 287, which are concurrent with US 69. US 69, US 96, and US 287 continue in a northwest, then west, route until its intersection with Interstate 10 in southern Beaumont. At this intersection, US 69, US 96, and US 287 merge with I-10. I-10/US 69/US 96/US 287 continue in a northerly direction through Beaumont for several miles. Just after the intersection with US 90, I-10 splits from the multiplex and resumes its easterly course, leaving US 69, US 96, and US 287 heading northwest through Beaumont. US 69 north of I-10 is also known officially known as Eastex Freeway, and is an official evacuation route, just as Interstate 69/US 59 heading north from Houston is known as Eastex Freeway as well. In Lumberton, US 96 splits from US 69 and US 287 and heads northeast towards Jasper, while US 69 and US 287 continue on a northwest path towards Woodville. In Woodville, US 69 splits from US 287 a few blocks north of US 190. US 287 continues northwest towards Corrigan while US 69 proceed north towards Lufkin. In this area, between US 190 in Woodville and FM 256 in Colmesneil, US 69 is a part of the Texas Forest Trail. Before reaching Lufkin, US 69 forms another segment of the Texas Forest Trail between SH 63 in Zavalla and FM 1818 northwest of Zavalla. In Lufkin, US 69 is concurrent with US 59 and State Loop 287 while the route through the city is named Business US 69. US 69, State Loop 287, and US 59 continue around the east side of Lufkin until US 59 separates at the intersection with US 59 Business northeast of Lufkin. US 69 and State Loop 287 continue until the intersection of SH 103 and Business US 69 on the northwest section of Lufkin. At that point, US 69 is concurrent for a short distance with SH 103 and State Loop 287. At the intersection of US 69, State Loop 287 and SH 103, US 69 departs Lufkin and heads northwest while SH 103 and State Loop 287 head south. US 69 continues on a north to northwest path through the towns of Alto, Rusk, Jacksonville and Bullard. Just south of Bullard, US 69 has a short concurrency with FM 2493. US 69 continues northward into Tyler. In Tyler, US 69 continues northward through the city until the intersection of SH 110 and SH 155, where US 69 heads west and merges with SH 110 and SH 155 through Tyler. Around seven blocks from the intersection of US 69, SH 110, and SH 155, SH 155 separates from the concurrency and travels in a southwesterly direction, leaving US 69 and SH 110 traveling in a northwesterly direction. This continues until SH 110 separates from US 69 on the northwest side of Tyler. At this intersection, SH 110 heads west while US 69 continues north. Lindale US 69 crosses Interstate 20 at Lindale where it is signed as \\"Main Street\\". At FM 16 in Lindale, US 69 begins its third and last segment as part of the Texas Forest Trail. US 69 continues north to northwest to Mineola, crossing US 80 there. Before leaving town, at its intersection with SH 37, the Texas Forest Trail turns off of US 69 to share a segment with SH 37. US 69 takes a more northwest turn on its way through several small towns, including Emory, on its way to Greenville. There, as it begins to enter the city, a Business route of US 69 turns off to the right to serve the downtown Greenville area, and then on to a junction with Interstate 30. At the intersection with I-30, US 69 becomes concurrent with US 380 at its terminus. The concurrency continues around the southern and western sides of Greenville until an intersection with Spur 302. At that intersection, US 380 heads west while US 69 continues north, until it reaches the northern end of its Business route, which has passed through the downtown Greenville area, then US 69 turns northwest, from Greenville to Leonard, where it encounters a brief concurrency with SH 78. In Whitewright, SH 11 intersects and becomes concurrent with US 69 southeast of town. This continues until the intersection with SH 160, at which time SH 11 continues on a northwestward route and US 69 continues north through Whitewright. US 69 continues north, then northwest until Denison, where it turns right to go north, at an intersection with Spur 503. US 69 goes north through downtown Denison, then at the north side of town, US 69 intersects and merges with US 75, at which time US 69 becomes concurrent with US 75.

Route description  US 287 crosses into Texas at Kerrick and continues southeast through to Stratford, where it takes a more southerly turn. In Dumas, US 287 merges with its \\"parent route\\", US 87, and continues its south/southeasterly path as a co-signed route to Amarillo. After passing through the heart of downtown Amarillo, US 87 splits off to the south to merge with I-27, and US 287 merges with I-40 and continues co-signed with the interstate until just west of Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport, where it veers to the southeast toward Claude, the seat of Armstrong County. US 287 follows this east-southeasterly path through Clarendon and Childress, where it intersects US Highways 83 and 62. US 287 then proceeds to Vernon, where it merges with (and is briefly co-signed with) US 70 and US 183.

The highway continues southeastward to Palestine, where it merges with State Highway 19. US 287/SH 19 continues as a co-signed route until Crockett, where US 287 leaves SH 19 and continues its southeasterly track toward the Texas Gulf Coast. In Woodville, US 287 merges with US 69 and takes on a more due-southerly route to Lumberton, where a co-signed US 69/287 also merges with US 96. The highway then continues to the southeast through Beaumont with a short stint with Interstate 10 and on to Port Arthur, where the route terminates at an intersection with State Highway 87. History When US 287 was first commissioned in 1935, none of its route was in Texas. The route was extended southward from Colorado to the Gulf Coast at Port Arthur, Texas in 1939. Before this extension, the portion from the Oklahoma state line to Amarillo was SH 9, from Amarillo to Henrietta was SH 5, Henrietta to Bowie was SH 50, Bowie to Fort Worth was SH 2 and US 81, Fort Worth to Ennis SH 34, Ennis to Corsicana was SH 14/US 75, Corsicana to Palestine was SH 22, Palestine to Crockett was SH 19, Crockett and Woodville was Texas State Highway 106, Woodville to Port Arthur was SH 8. right From 1926 to 1939, the aforementioned state routes between US 66 in Claude and US 81 in Bowie were co-designated with U.S. Route 370, which was commissioned in 1926. US 370 was extended westward to Amarillo by 1935 with the northward relocation of US 66. This route also traveled concurrently with US 70 between Vernon and Wichita Falls, Texas. With the 1939 general re-description of the Texas State Highway system all of the state highway designations were removed and US 370 was decommissioned from Oklahoma state line to Port Arthur. SH 106 was decommissioned entirely. Future Currently in Beaumont a construction project is widening the highway from four lanes to six lanes for a future Interstate Corridor for US 96 to connect to future Interstate 14. Between Ennis and Waxahatchie the highway is getting grade separated interchanges and service roads.

Surface water is water located on top of the Earth's surface such as rivers, creeks, and wetlands. This may also be referred to as blue water. The vast majority is produced by precipitation and water runoff from nearby areas. As the climate warms in the spring, snowmelt runs off towards nearby streams and rivers contributing towards a large portion of our drinking water. Levels of surface water lessen as a result of evaporation as well as water moving into the ground becoming ground-water. Alongside being used for drinking water, surface water is also used for irrigation, wastewater treatment, livestock, industrial uses, hydropower, and recreation. r It is recorded by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), that approximately 68 percent of water provided to communities comes from surface water. For USGS water-use reports, surface water is considered freshwater when it contains less than 1,000 milligrams per liter (m/L) of dissolved solids. There are three major types of surface water. Permanent (perennial) surface waters are present year round. This includes rivers, swamps, and lakes. Semi-permanent (ephemeral) surface water refers to bodies of water that are only present at certain times of the year including areas such as creeks, lagoons, and waterholes. Man made surface water is water that can be continued by infrastructure that humans have assembled. This would be lakes, dams, and artificial swamps. The surface water held by dams can be used for renewable energy in the form of hydropower. Hydropower is the forcing of surface water sourced from rivers and streams to produce energy.  Measuring Surface Water  A stream gauge used to measure surface water. Surface water can be measured as annual runoff. This includes the amount of rain and snowmelt drainage left after the uptake of nature, evaporation from land, and transpiration from vegetation. In areas such as California, the California Water Science Center records the flow of surface water and annual runoff by utilizing a network of approximately 500 stream gages collecting real time data from all across the state. This then contributes to the 8,000 stream gage stations that are overseen by the USGS national stream gage record. This in turn has provided to date records and documents of water data over the years. Management teams that oversee the distribution of water are then able to make decisions of adequate water supply to sectors. These include municipal, industrial, agricultural, renewable energy (hydropower), and storage in reservoirs.  Climate Change Impacts  Due to climate change, sea ice and glaciers are melting rising contributing to the rise in sea levels. As a result, salt water from the ocean is beginning to infiltrate our freshwater aquifers contaminating water used for urban and agricultural services. It is also affecting surrounding ecosystems as it places stress on the wildlife inhabiting those areas. It was recorded by the NOAA in the years 2012 to 2016, ice sheets in Greenland and the Antarctic reduced by 247 billion tons per year. This number will continue to increase as global warming persists. Global warming has a direct connection with the hydrologic cycle. It has increased evaporation yet decreased precipitation, runoff, groundwater, and soil moisture. This has altered surface water levels. Climate change also enhances the existing challenges we face in water quality. The quality of surface water is based on the chemical inputs from the surrounding elements such as the air and the nearby landscape. When these elements are polluted due to human activity, it alters the chemistry of the water. Conjunctive use of ground and surface water Surface and groundwater are two separate entities, so they must be regarded as such. However, there is an ever-increasing need for management of the two as they are part of an interrelated system that is paramount when the demand for water exceeds the available supply (Fetter 464). Depletion of surface and ground water sources for public consumption (including industrial, commercial, and residential) is caused by over-pumping. Aquifers near river systems that are over-pumped have been known to deplete surface water sources as well. Research supporting this has been found in numerous water budgets for a multitude of cities. Response times for an aquifer are long (Young & Bredehoeft 1972). However, a total ban on ground water usage during water recessions would allow surface water to retain better levels required for sustainable aquatic life. By reducing ground water pumping, the surface water supplies will be able to maintain their levels, as they recharge from direct precipitation, surface runoff, etc. See also *Environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant *Meltwater *Optimum water content for tillage  References  * Applied Hydrogeology, Fourth Edition by C.W.

This goes back to class and race prejudices. Examples can be seen in British colonialism of India and Africa.One of the major areas that has been written and documented in having experienced the Black Peril is South Africa, or more specifically in certain writings, Southern Rhodesia, which later became the modern day country Zimbabwe in 1980. Black Peril is a colonial based fear that started in Southern Rhodesia and survived all the way to the independence of Zimbabwe. Black Rape scares were not unique or scarce to South Africa since well-documented parallels have ranged in place and time from \\"the southern United States in the late 1860s' to Papua in the 1920s\\".D. Kennedy (1987), Islands of White: Settler Society and Culture in Kenya and Southern Rhodesia 1890-1939 (Duke University Press, Durham,pp 138) It was theorized that the fear of this Black Peril, the rape threats, as seen through the eyes of the white male settlers, were essentially a \\"rationalization of white men's fear of sexual competition from black men\\".Cornwell, Gareth (1996) George Webb Hardy's The Black Peril and the Social Meaning of 'Black Peril' in Early Twentieth-Century South Africa Journal of Southern African Studies , Vol. 22, No. 3 , pp. 441 URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2637313 The \\"'Black Peril' outcries from white settlers in Southern Rhodesia provided an outlet for anxieties about weakness within the 'body politic'\\" since the 'Whites shared a conceptual language for crisis and it was corporeal'.McCulloch, John (2000), Black Peril, White Virtue: Sexual Crime in Southern Rhodesia, 1902-1935 p 82 It was through this thought process that the 'Black Peril' panics led to specific actions that served the interests of the white settler men in these areas.Jeater, Diana (2002) Review of RhodesiaBlack Peril, White Virtue.

Sexual Crime in Southern Rhodesia, 1902-1935 by Jock McCulloch, pp 466, URL:https://www.jstor.org/stable/823397 . In Southern Rhodesia, the situation was even more traumatic, since the 'black peril' scare of the early 1900s came in the wake of the 1896 war of resistance. Resultant embitterment lingered to the extent that throughout the first decades of colonialism there were periodic campaigns to control the supposedly excessive fundamental urges of African men. Much more clandestine, but far more of a reality was the rarely noted 'white peril', a wide range of sexual abuse of black women (and occasionally men) by settler males.Vambe, Lawrence (1976) From Rhodesia to Zimbabwe, p. 110 , 9780822933175  South Africa  During the 1900s, in response to these white women rapes (imagined or otherwise) the Government of South Africa tried to control it through setting up a program of national Human population control which would theoretically encompasses these three distinct elements; limitation on women's Fertility, change in human mortality rates and control of Immigration.Brown, Barabara (1987),Facing the 'Black Peril': The Politics of Population Control in South Africa, Journal of Southern African Studies, Vol. 13, No. 2, Special Issue on The Political Economy of Health in Southern Africa, pp.256 URL https://www.jstor.org/stable/2636860 At this time Birth controldid not have an official program so the government turned to other methods and elements in population control.N.J. van Rensburg, Population Explosion in Southern Africa (Pretoria, 1972), p. 156.NLM ID:100976834 [Book Chapter] Thus through this Black Peril scare the government of South Africa adopted specific policies on each of these three which, taken together, attempted to limit the black population while maintaining a large white population.Republic of South Africa (RSA), Report of the Science Committee of the President's Council on Demographic Trends in South Africa (Cape Town, 1983), pp. 45., 9780621076578 As late as the 1911 census white men outnumbered white women by nearly two to one. It was not until 1921 that females reached 40 per cent of the settler population and census takers could boast that 'the population has now attained a settled character comparable with that of much older countries'.Republic of South Africa (RSA), Report of the Science Committee of the President's Council on Demographic Trends in South Africa (Cape Town, 1983), pp. 46., 9780621076578 Along the road to that settled character white males in Rhodesia often soothed their feelings of isolation by sexual relations with black women. These sexual encounters were not usually based on mutual attraction but on coercion. As two observers have noted they were 'similar to those between masters and slaves, feudal lords and serfs, conquerors and conquered in other countries'. This side of the interracial sexual coin was the 'white peril', a term which rarely appeared in Rhodesian annals.Republic of South Africa (RSA), Report of the Science Committee of the President's Council on Demographic Trends in South Africa (Cape Town, 1983), pp. 46., 9780621076578  South Rhodesia (Zimbabwe)  The 'black peril' became a public issue in the settler community within South Rhodesia just after the turn of the century. In colonial Rhodesia the fear of 'black peril' spawned a wide range of legislation, including the prohibition of sexual relations between white women and black men.Pape, John (1990) Black and White: The 'Perils of Sex' in Colonial Zimbabwe,Journal of Southern African Studies, Vol. 16, No. 4, pp. 699, URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2637043 In addition, dozens of blacks were executed, both legally and extra-legally, for supposed 'black peril' violations. The rise of alleged sexual attacks on white women around 1902 was, according to settler consensus due to an influx into Southern Rhodesia of a number of prostitutes who were racially undiscerning in choosing their customers.Pape, John (1990) Black and White: The 'Perils of Sex' in Colonial Zimbabwe,Journal of Southern African Studies, Vol. 16, No. 4, pp. 713, URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2637043 A government report of 1914 presented this historical analysis: On the question of prostitution by white women with natives it is pertinent to state that the prevalence of 'black peril' during the years 1902 and 1903 in Bulawayo was mainly attributed by the general public to the presence and operation of the women referred to in the instances quoted under the heading of 'white peril'Pape, John (1990) Black and White: The 'Perils of Sex' in Colonial Zimbabwe,Journal of Southern African Studies, Vol. 16, No. 4, pp. 703, URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2637043 Perhaps frightened by the rise of both non-discriminating white women and vigilantism, the Legislative Assembly took its own action passing the Immorality Suppression Ordinance in September 1903.Pape, John (1990) Black and White: The 'Perils of Sex' in Colonial Zimbabwe,Journal of Southern African Studies, Vol. 16, No. 4, pp. 709, URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2637043 According to this law a man could face the death penalty for anything which constituted 'attempted rape'. The legislation also affected maximum sentences of two years imprisonment for white women and five years for black men who engaged in interracial sex. Even these penalties were not sufficient to please all the whites. In Zimbabwe a large number of black men were channeled into domestic service, as well as the mining and farming labors. In fact, throughout the first half century of colonialism domestic service ranked third as a source of African employment, therefore that meant that white women spent most of their days alone with black male servants.Pape, John (1990) Black and White: The 'Perils of Sex' in Colonial Zimbabwe,Journal of Southern African Studies, Vol. 16, No. 4, pp. 710, URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2637043 It would be in this situation that the complex paranoia called the 'black peril' would be manufactured.Pape, John (1990) Black and White: The 'Perils of Sex' in Colonial Zimbabwe,Journal of Southern African Studies, Vol. 16, No. 4, pp. 701, URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2637043  White Peril  In contrast, 'white peril', or Sexual Abuse of black women by white men, was far more frequent.Mabeta,Gabriel (1925) White men and Blackwomen, p. 8. Despite these protestations there was never any law passed to prohibit white men from having sexual relations with black women.Mabeta,Gabriel (1925) White men and Black women, p. 8. The main reason for the differing official response to the 'black' and 'white perils' was the nature of race, class and gender relations in the colony.Vambe, Lawrence (1976) From Rhodesia to Zimbabwe, p. 109 , 9780822933175 The 'perils' were necessary in order to solidify racial and gender differences and thereby to construct white and male supremacist social order.

US 82 is co-signed with US 380 from Plains to Brownfield, where it joins US 62, and US 380 leaves the route. US 82/62 continues northeastward toward Lubbock. In Lubbock, US 82 and US 62 split, where US 82 has been upgraded to a full access freeway, named the Marsha Sharp Freeway, in honor of retired Texas Tech Lady Raiders basketball coach Marsha Sharp. On the east side of the city, US 82 travels as a surface street along Parkway Drive and it once again merges with US 62 (along with State Highway 114) where it continues eastward through Ralls, where US 62 makes a sharp turn to the north and leaves the route. US 82 continues eastward across the level plains of the Llano Estacado to Crosbyton and then dips downward as it crosses the White River of Blanco Canyon, where the Texas Department of Transportation maintains the Silver Falls Rest Area with facilities and hiking trails. After climbing out of Blanco Canyon, US 82 eventually exits the Llano Estacado and enters the rolling plains near Dickens. US 82/SH 114 continues eastward as a co-signed route until Seymour, where it merges with U.S. Highways 183, 277 and 283, with US 183 and 283 leaving the route at Mabelle. US 82/277 continues eastward to Wichita Falls, merging with I-44 and US 287 just south of downtown at Mile marker 0.  Wichita Falls to Arkansas US 82 leaves US 287 at Henrietta and continues east towards the small towns of Nocona (beginning as a four-lane divided highway), St. Jo and Muenster and crossing I-35 in Gainesville at a partial cloverleaf interchange (It has since been converted to a frontage road interchange in 2012.). The highway continues east towards Whitesboro and Sherman where it crosses US Highway 75 at a three-level diamond interchange (the portion through Sherman is called the Buck Owens Freeway in honor of the country music star, who was born in Sherman). Prior to the 1990s, the two highways ran concurrently on the route of SH 56 before being rerouted northeast of Sherman on its present-day route. The highway continues east to Bells where US 82 cross US Route 69. In Bonham, Texas, US 82 crosses SH 121 while the route runs parallel with SH 56 until Honey Grove where SH 56 ends. US 82 enters Paris at a diamond interchange where it runs concurrent with Loop 286 on the north side of the city as a Business Route runs through the center of the city before rejoining on the east side of Paris. At a diamond interchange on the north side of Paris, US 82/TX Loop 286 meets with US 271 where both highways run concurrent on the northeast side of town before US 82 branches off at another diamond interchange on the east side of Paris. After passing around Clarksville and other smaller towns the highway is crossed by Interstate 30 east of New Boston at a partial cloverleaf and continues to run parallel to IH 30 into Arkansas through downtown Texarkana. History US 82 was first designated in Texas in 1939, traveling from Lubbock to Texarkana. The highway was extended from Lubbock to the New Mexico state line in 1963. Between 1974 and 1994, US 82 was re-routed from Whitesboro to Honey Grove; the old routing became SH 56. The highway was re-routed from Allendale Road to US 281/US 287 through Wichita Falls in 1998 with a bypass built around Holliday in 2005. US 82 was re-routed around Clarkesville in 2006, creating a concurrency with SH 37. The highway was re-routed south of Guthrie in 2007, with part of the former route becoming Spur 729. Marsha Sharp Freeway The Marsha Sharp Freeway, named for former Texas Tech Lady Raiders basketball coach Marsha Sharp, was built along US 82 in Lubbock, with construction officially beginning in May 2003, with development going back to the 1980s. In 1998, funding was first received. The five-phase project was scheduled to be completed in 2015. Phase 2 of the project was scheduled to be completed in December 2008 at a cost of $140 million. It involved construction of the freeway from Salem Avenue to Avenue L and erecting interchanges at 19th Street, Quaker Avenue, Fourth Street, and Avenue Q in Lubbock. Currently construction on the freeway has started from Milwaukee Ave. to Upland Ave. and on the intersection of Spur 327 and U.S. 62/82. The section of freeway between West Loop 289 and Avenue L was widened from four lanes to six lanes between March 6, 2017 and March 5, 2018, officially marking the end of the freeway's construction. Future TxDOT began upgrading U.S. 82 in Grayson and Fannin County in 2013. The four-lane divided highway upgrade between Sherman and Bonham was completed in 2015. TxDOT plans to continue this upgrade to the Fannin and Lamar County line by 2020. Long term planning calls for U.S. 82 to be a four-lane divided highway system the entire length between Wichita Falls and Texarkana as a potential alternate route through north Texas in order to bypass the overcrowded Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. It is being upgraded to a 4 lane divided highway west of Nocona, and a partial bypass is planned to run south of Gainesville.

Route description El Capitan as seen from US 62 in Guadalupe Mountains National Park Trans-Pecos US 62 begins at the Santa Fe Street Bridge at the Mexico‚ÄìUS border in El Paso concurrent with U.S. Route 85. US 62 ends its overlap with US 85 and runs along E. Paisano Drive through Downtown El Paso. The highway runs northeast and passes by the Chamizal National Memorial before interchanging with Interstate 110 and U.S. Route 54. US 62 continues to run along E. Paisano Drive and has a short overlap with State Highway 20, which both enters and leaves via a traffic circle. The highway meets Interstate 10, where it begins an overlap with U.S. Route 180. Just north of I-10, US 62/180 leave E. Paisano Drive and begin to run along Montana Avenue, passing just south of El Paso International Airport. The section of Montana Avenue from Global Reach Drive/N. Yarbrough Drive to Rich Beem Boulevard runs along the reservation line to Fort Bliss. Development begins to steadily decrease along the highway east of Loop 375 as US 62 runs through the communities of Homestead Meadows North/Homestead Meadows South, Butterfield, and Montana Vista. After leaving El Paso County, the highway runs through sparsely populated areas and the town of Pine Springs near Guadalupe Mountains National Park. The highway winds through the Guadalupe Mountains before crossing into New Mexico. South Plains US 62/180 reenters Texas from New Mexico between Hobbs and Seminole. US 62 ends its overlap with US 180 in Seminole and begins an overlap with U.S. Route 385. The two highways run north-northeast through the towns of Seagraves and Wellman before entering Brownfield. In Brownfield, US 62 has a short overlap with U.S. Route 380 and State Highway 137 and begins an overlap with U.S. Route 82. US 385 leaves the concurrency in the northern part of the town. US 62/82 run through the towns of Meadow and Ropesville before entering metro Lubbock and the town of Wolfforth. The highway bypasses the town as a freeway and enters Lubbock near the 82nd Street exit. US 62/82 becomes a divided highway between 82nd Street and Spur 327 before becoming a freeway again, which is known locally as the Marsha Sharp Freeway. US 62 runs along the Marsha Sharp Freeway through a heavily developed area of southwest Lubbock before leaving US 82 at State Highway 114. US 62/SH 114 run through the heart of the city on 19th Street before becoming Idalou Road at Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard. The highway rejoins US 82 near the East Loop 289 interchange. The highways run northeast out of the city before turning in a predominately east direction in Idalou. US 62 leaves US 82/SH 114 in Ralls before beginning a concurrency with State Highway 207. The highway's concurrency with SH 207 ends in Floydada, with US 62 beginning an overlap with U.S. Route 70. US 62 has a lengthy overlap with US 70 that lasts from Floydada to Paducah. In Paducah, US 62 begins an overlap with U.S. Route 83, with the two highways running through Childress. US 62 ends its overlap with US 83 just north of the Prairie Dog Town Fork Red River and exits the state into Oklahoma a few miles west of Hollis.

Several brick buildings in a rectangle layout make up the complex which is located on a bank south of the Landstra√üer G√ºrtel. It is the most distinguished building group of Romantic historicism in Vienna and has been constructed in Italian-medieval and Byzantine-Islamic style. Essentially the complex is still preserved in its original form, merely a few workshop buildings within the courtyard were replaced. History Vienna Arsenal shortly after completion 1855 The complex was built in the aftermath of the March Revolution 1848, between 1848‚Äì1856, and was the first of three buildings which replaced the old city fortifications. The area was split into sectors where construction was supervised by the architects Carl Roesner, Antonius Pius de Riegel, August Sicard von Sicardsburg, Eduard van der N√ºll, Theophil von Hansen and Ludwig F√∂rster. The master builder was Leopold Mayr. The Heeresgeschichtliches Museum took until 1891 to finish. In the aftermath there were multiple expansions. During the First World War the complex served as a barracks and armoury. The Arsenal was not always part of the Third District; from its construction until 1938 it belonged to Favoriten. When Vienna was reorganized to form a new Reichsgau in Nazi Germany, inner city borders were reassigned and the Arsenal as well as the area south of it became part of Landstra√üe. In 1945 the Arsenal was heavily damaged by bombing, however after the war most it was rebuilt into its original form. In the following years, several new constructions, primarily in the south, were undertaken, such as the workshops for the State Theatres (1959 until 1963) and the rehearsal stage for the Burgtheater in the 1990s. From 1961 until 1963 the Fernmeldezentralamt and 1973 buildings for the Post- und Telegraphendirektion f√ºr Wien, Nieder√∂sterreich und das Burgenland (Mail and Telegraph Authority for Vienna, Lower Austria and Burgenland), today the Technologiezentrum Arsenal (Technology Centre Arsenal) of the Telekom Austria) with the 150-metre high Funkturm Arsenal. The √ñsterreichisches Forschungs- und Pr√ºfzentrum Arsenal (Austrian Research and Testing Centre Arsenal), today Arsenal Research, was located in the complex. A small part of the complex is still being used by the Austrian army as a barracks. Furthermore the Zentraldesinfektionsanstalt (central disinfection facility) of Vienna is located there. Part of the Arsenal now contains housing. Testing facility Class 92/CC 92000 Channel Tunnel locomotive during ‚àí25¬∞C cold-weather testing in 1994. An area of the former site was used by the not-for-profit Rail Tec Arsenal (RTA) research centre to provide climatic validation for rail and public transport vehicles. This facility contained a two climatic wind tunnels capable of simulating all combinations of weather by varying temperature, air pressure, humidity and wind-speed. The long wind tunnel allowed testing up to three railway vehicles at once and had an operation length of 100 metres. The short wind tunnel allowed testing of single vehicles or buses. In 2003 RTA moved to new facilities in Vienna's district of Floridsdorf.

The episode, which originally aired on NBC on January 9, 1996, depicts an extraterrestrial research expedition coming to Earth in the guise of what they think is a typical human family. Plot In the town of Rutherford, Ohio, the aliens appear in their human forms aboard a 1963 Rambler convertible. The High Commander has become family patriarch Dick Solomon, the Security Officer is his sister Sally and the Information Officer (who is actually the oldest of the aliens) has become Tommy, Dick's teenage son. Another alien, who has no obvious purpose yet, has taken on the form of Dick's brother Harry. The first discovery they all make is that none of them can swivel their heads around a hundred and eighty degrees and thus cannot lick their backs. Shortly thereafter, Dick scrounges up a job as a physics professor at nearby Pendelton State University and the aliens rent a loft apartment from Mrs. Mamie Dubcek, who remains their landlady for the rest of the series. At work, Dick becomes smitten with Dr. Mary Albright, an anthropology professor with whom he shares an office. When he accidentally upsets Mary, he discovers emotions, which the aliens previously had no knowledge of. Intrigued and confused by the concept, Dick takes the family to a party at the dean's house, where he apologizes to Mary there and she somewhat returns his affections. He later tells the rest of his crew that humans must be more complex than they ever thought and decides they will remain on Earth to further study the human condition. The rest of the aliens believe he actually wants to stay due to his infatuation with Mary, but Dick has his way since he is High Commander. Reception Reviews of the pilot were mixed and it was criticized for its abundant sex jokes, which were seen as \\"cheap\\".'3rd Rock': Take Me to Your Libido from The Washington Post The Daily News of Los Angeles reported that \\"as terrific as Lithgow is in his first weekly series, the show arrives dressed as one colossal breast joke.\\"THE SCREEN\\\\\\"3rd Rock From the Sun\\" Some critics compared the series to the short- lived Champs, which debuted on the same day.'CHAMPS' RISES/'3RD ROCK' SINKSComedies \`Rock' and \`Champs' are winners, sort of The episode was watched by 23 million viewers.His Day in 'The Sun' - John Lithgow takes off in '3rd Rock' Differences in the sets The sets seen in this episode are markedly different from those used later in the show's run. For instance, the Solomons' loft apartment doesn't have a staircase and the room is instead entered through the door that would later lead to Dick's bedroom. In Dick and Mary's office, Dick has the desk that would later become Mary's and vice versa. Also, most of the set dressing in the office is different and it is entered through the door that later leads to Nina's office. The sets were altered in \\"Truth or Dick\\", the next episode to be filmed, and they remained largely unchanged for the remainder of the show's run. Background This episode is actually the second version of the pilot to be filmed. Originally, Dick's love interest was to be a secretary, but, after the first pilot, it became apparent to the show's producers that the aliens bounced off everything and that \\"straight\\" comic foils were required. The love interest was subsequently rewritten to be a fellow professor and a new character, Nina Campbell, became the secretary. Nina was added since it was thought that an \\"edge in the office\\" was needed.

The EFC is used in the United States student financial aid process to determine an applicant's eligibility for need-based federal student aid. In most cases, the same estimate is also used for state and institutional (college-based) financial aid. The EFC is included on the Student Aid Report and Institutional Student Information Record, which are sent after filing a form called a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). So as to estimate the EFC before filing the FAFSA, there are a number of free calculators on the Web. Recipients of need-based financial aid must reapply for each year; that is, a new FAFSA must be filed and a new EFC calculated every year.  Use of the expected family contribution  The federal government does not distribute aid directly to the student or the student's family; it goes through the college. Colleges use the student's federal student aid eligibility and combine it with state financial aid (if any) and their own aid to create a financial aid package for the student. Generally speaking, the lower the EFC, the higher the financial aid award will be. Zero is the lowest EFC number (indicating that the family cannot afford to pay anything) and 999,999 is the highest. Some relatively wealthy colleges and universities use another method called the CSS Profile, or have their own form, to calculate their own version of an EFC, which they use in distributing the college's aid. A major difference between the FAFSA and the CSS Profile is that the CSS Profile includes primary residence home equity when determining the ability of the family to pay, while the FAFSA does not. The EFC is subtracted from the cost of attendance (COA) of the college or university to determine a student's financial need. If , then a student is considered to have a financial need. Calculation of the EFC Basic considerations The formula for computing the EFC changes each year. It is different for each of three categories of student (dependent students, independent students without dependents other than a spouse, and independent students with dependents other than a spouse) and is published in the Federal Register. An Department of Education document explaining how the EFC is determined was 36 pages long in 2017. It considers income, family size, living expenses, and family and student savings. If the student is a dependent, the student's savings and income, if any, are considered highly available to pay for college. A student with a college savings fund in his or her name will have a higher EFC (if not qualifying for an automatic zero), and will thus receive less need-based aid. Automatic Zero and Simplified Needs EFC * Automatic Zero: A student's EFC is set to zero if the family's income is below $26,000 for the 2017‚Äì2018 year and ** they either received funding from any of the Federal Benefits programs (SSI, SNAP (formerly known as the Food Stamp program), WIC, or Free/Reduced Price Lunch), OR ** they filed or were eligible to file a 1040A, 1040EZ, or were not required to fill out a tax return, OR ** the parent is a dislocated worker. * Simplified Needs Test: Families meeting the above requirements except for having income between $26,000 and $50,000 are eligible for the Simplified Needs Test, in which assets are not used in the calculation. * Independent students without dependents other than a spouse are not eligible for the Automatic Zero or Simplified Needs. Considerations that reduce the EFC Items that lower a student's EFC: * Additional family members supported by the head of the household (e.g., siblings or grandparents who are living at home) * Additional family members in college. (The EFC is split among the students in college.) * Lower income (especially student income) * Fewer assets (especially student assets) Colleges or universities have the legal authority to lower the EFC if there are unusual circumstances, usually brought to the financial aid office's attention as the result of an appeal of a financial aid award. These circumstances include: * Loss of employment * Loss of child support, alimony, etc. * Separation or divorce * Death of parent or spouse * Large medical or dental expenses not covered by insurance * Income that was abnormally high because of a one-time lump sum that will most likely not occur again Financial issues that are not considered Aspects that are not considered in the calculation of the EFC are: * The equity in the family's principal home. (Additional homes and other real estate holdings are counted.) * Parental retirement funds, such as 401ks * Consumer debt, such as car and credit card loans Actual family payments A common misconception is that the EFC is a statement of what the family actually will pay. This is usually not the case, and many families pay more, sometimes much more, than the EFC. The college's costs, minus the EFC, gives the student's financial need. Most four-year colleges do not have enough financial aid to meet students' needs, and as a result, the unmet need must be paid by the parents, in addition to the EFC. The federal government offers unsubsidized Stafford Loans, which are available to any family regardless of need, as a source of funds to cover the unmet need. In cases in which a student qualifies for merit-based (rather than need-based) financial aid, the student and their family may pay less than the EFC. A well-to-do family's EFC may exceed the cost of attendance at a school, and in that case the student does not have financial need, as defined by the federal financial aid system. In some cases, despite financial hardship for the student, the student's family will simply be unwilling to pay the full amount, leaving the student to find their own way to finance their college education, or forgo it. Independent and dependent students Students who are unmarried, younger than 24, and not supporting a minor child are categorized as Dependent Students, and the parents' income and assets are used in determining the EFC. Even if the parents have no intention of helping pay the student's college expenses, which legally they are not required to do, the student remains considered a dependent and the parents' income and assets are used in determining the EFC and through it, the student's financial aid award. Put differently, if the parents are able but unwilling to help pay for the student's college, financial aid will not be increased because of it. This was determined by the United States Congress. In exceptional cases, such as parental child abuse and parental communication with the child being prohibited by a court, the college financial aid office has the authority to change a student's status from Dependent to Independent.

In the state of Texas, the highway is a major south‚Äìnorth corridor, connecting Brownsville to the Oklahoma state line at the Red River in Burkburnett. Several segments of U.S. 281 are concurrent with Interstate routes, including I-69C in the Rio Grande Valley, I-37 in San Antonio, and I-44 north of Wichita Falls. Route description US 281 has two signed segments near its southern terminus in the Rio Grande Valley, both of which are signed west‚Äìeast. The eastern segment, considered mainline US 281 by TxDOT, begins in Brownsville at an intersection with Business US 77 and SH 48 about from the Mexico border, and travels west through several communities along the border to Pharr. The western segment, officially listed as a spur connection by TxDOT and often labeled on maps as US 281 Spur, begins just north of the McAllen‚ÄìHidalgo‚ÄìReynosa International Bridge in Hidalgo and travels north along International Boulevard before turning east onto Coma Avenue and entering Pharr. The two segments (along with Spur 600, which provides access to the Pharr‚ÄìReynosa International Bridge) meet at Cage Boulevard, where signage changes to south‚Äìnorth, and the highway turns to the north. North of the interchange with I-2, US 281 is concurrent with I-69C to that route's northern terminus () in Edinburg. US 281 travels through small towns and sparsely-populated areas, alternating between a divided highway and a main street and passing through a Border Patrol checkpoint south of Falfurrias, until joining I-37 north of Three Rivers. The two routes split south of Pleasanton and separately travel northward to San Antonio. In San Antonio, US 281 overlaps I-410 on the south side of the city until another interchange with I-37. US 281 and I-37 then overlap north into Downtown San Antonio until I-37 ends at I-35. US 281 continues north from Downtown San Antonio as the McAllister Freeway, intersecting I-410 again at a stack interchange in Uptown San Antonio, with access to the San Antonio International Airport. The freeway ends at Loop 1604, and US 281 continues through Bexar County as a superstreet. In Central Texas, it serves as the main street of Blanco before beginning a concurrency with US 290 south of Johnson City. As US 290 continues toward Austin, US 281 and US 290 provide a scenic and less congested alternative to I-35 between San Antonio and Austin. The two routes split in the city, with US 281 continuing toward Marble Falls, Burnet, and Lampasas. North of Stephenville, US 281 crosses I-20 and continues through North Central Texas, passing through Mineral Wells and Jacksboro. Upon reaching Wichita Falls, US 281 becomes a freeway. It begins a concurrency with I-44 at that route's western terminus, and the two routes travel north, crossing the Red River into Oklahoma near Burkburnett. History A project to construct a stack interchange at I-410 (the \\"San Antonio Web\\") was completed June 9, 2008; formerly there was no direct access between the two freeways and surface streets were required to travel between the freeways. The reason for this initial lack of direct interchange was due to litigation filed in the late 1960s against the Texas Highway Department over the highway's original construction alignment through portions of Brackenridge Park and Olmos Park that were alleged to be in violation of several Federal laws, ultimately including NEPA. As a result of the Supreme Court decisionCitizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe in a more advanced and very similar case involving the proposed construction of I-40 through Overton Park in Memphis, Tennessee which upheld and affirmed the plaintiffs in that circumstance and precluded that highway's construction through the parkland with Federal funding, the Texas Highway Department chose instead to construct the McAlister Freeway entirely with State funding using a modified design that would increase curvature but limit encroachment into and noise impact on the Sunken Gardens area within Brackenridge Park. Funding of various highway projects from around Texas was re-allocated to the McAlister Freeway project, which was initially completed with only the indirect interchange via existing surface streets to Loop 410 since it required no Federal funding or approval and the Loop 410 overpass of that location where the McAlister Freeway main lanes would pass beneath had already been completed many years earlier. In 2010, US 281 from Loop 1604 to Bulverde Road in north San Antonio was re-constructed as a superstreet. Groundbreaking was held on March 11, 2010 with construction finishing later that year in September. The highway was expanded from a two- lane highway to a four-lane divided highway from River Crossing to the Comal- Blanco county line at a cost of $30.5 million. Future The section of US 281 from I-2/US 83 in Pharr to George West is steadily being upgraded to an interstate-grade freeway as part of the Interstate 69 expansion, and will be signed as Interstate 69C. The section of US 281 from Loop 1604 to the Bexar‚ÄìComal county line currently experiences heavy congestion during peak hours, being the most congested highway in Bexar County. TxDOT is upgrading this section of highway from a superstreet to a limited‚Äìaccess freeway, with construction beginning in 2017 and concluding in 2022. Section 1, from Loop 1604 to Stone Oak Parkway, is planned to be constructed from 2017 to 2020. Section 2, from Stone Oak Parkway to Borgfeld Drive, is planned to be constructed from 2019 to 2022. The project will cost $532 million. Ground breaking for the project was held on March 31, 2017 with construction officially beginning on July 17. Major intersections US Highways in Texas use green reflective labels about every 2 miles on sign posts which also include route markers. They are located immediately below route markers. Numbers increase as one goes south (for north‚Äìsouth routes) or east (for east‚Äìwest routes). These markers are part of the Texas Reference Marker (TRM) System, introduced in 1990. The Texas Department of Transportation Statewide Planning Map includes an optional overlay with reference markers.

His district was numbered the 24th during his first two years in Congress; since 2013, it has been the .  Early life, education, and business career  Hanna was born in Utica and raised in Marcy. His grandparents owned a dairy farm in Herkimer County. He graduated from Whitesboro High School in Marcy. Then, he graduated from Reed College with a bachelor's degree in Economics and Political Science. After college, Hanna returned to New York to start his own construction business called Hanna Construction. Hanna was of Lebanese descent.  U.S. House of Representatives   Elections  In 2008, Hanna ran against incumbent Democrat Mike Arcuri and narrowly lost. In 2010, he ran in a rematch and won. Due to redistricting, Hanna ran in the new 22nd district in 2012. In his 2012 campaign for re-election against Democrat Dan Lamb, television stations WUTR in Utica and WSYR in Syracuse announced they would jointly air a debate between Hanna and Lamb. Hanna declined to participate, citing another scheduled televised debate and five that would not be televised. The stations said that if Hanna did not appear, they would air a 30-minute question-and-answer session with Lamb. According to Steve Merren, the vice president and general manager of WUTR's parent company, Nexstar Broadcasting Group, Hanna then contacted Merren. In an email to staff, Merren stated, \\"He indicated to me that we would not be considered for his ad dollars and our level of cooperation in the future could be affected.\\" Merren then directed that WUTR not go ahead with the broadcast. Both Merren and a Hanna spokeswoman denied that threats had been made. After the inadvertent disclosure of the internal email, Merren told the press that Hanna \\"did not say he would pull his ad dollars.\\" The Hanna campaign said that his conversation with Merren had been \\"nothing more than a courtesy call\\". The Lamb campaign said that Hanna was \\"using his money to influence the journalistic decisions of a local news agency.\\" In 2014, Hanna received a primary challenge from a considerably more conservative Republican, State Assemblywoman Claudia Tenney. Described as a \\"Tea Party favorite,\\" Tenney reportedly challenged Hanna because \\"she believed he had abandoned his conservative principles during two terms in Congress. Tenney called Hanna a RINO (Republican in Name Only) who had become the third-most liberal Republican in the House of Representatives, based on his voting record.\\" Hanna defeated Tenney by a margin of 53% to 47%; when asked about the message sent by his win, he said, \\"I hope it's a message that you could be thoughtful and inclusive and still be elected.\\" Hanna went on to win re-election in November, when he had no Democratic challenger. Tenure Hanna was a member of the conservative Republican Study Committee and the centrist Republican Main Street Partnership. He was a member of the LGBT Equality Caucus. U.S. Congressman Hanna has stated his opposition to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. He was one of only six House Republicans in the 112th Congress who did not sign Grover Norquist's \\"Taxpayer Protection Pledge,\\" with a spokesman explaining that \\"Rep. Hanna is focusing on the pledges he has made to his wife, the Constitution of the United States and the people of upstate New York.\\" According to the Washington Post's congressional votes database, Hanna voted with the House Republicans 85% of the time in his first year in office; only 11 Republicans (out of 244) had a lower percentage at the time. Hanna was ranked as the 2nd most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the 114th United States Congress (after Peter T. King) in The Lugar Center and McCourt School of Public Policy's Bipartisan Index. In February 2011, Hanna published an op-ed opposing the extension of the USA PATRIOT Act. Editors from the Syracuse Post-Standard, which published the piece, later reprimanded Hanna for plagiarizing content from a report by Julian Sanchez of the Cato Institute in his editorial. Sanchez indicated that Hanna had his permission to use the content, although he was not referenced in the piece. The first bill Hanna co-sponsored was H.R. 4 which repealed the 1099 tax reporting provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. President Obama signed the bill into law in April 2011. In early 2011 Congressman Hanna voted to repeal health care reform. Hanna voted to support the Energy Tax Prevention Act which would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gasses and implementing a \\"cap-and-trade\\" system through regulation.http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll249.xml Hanna voted against cuts to NPR and Planned Parenthood. Hanna voted in favor of a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution. At a rally in support of the Equal Rights Amendment in March 2012, Hanna urged women to donate to Democratic candidates, saying: \\"I think these are very precarious times for women, it seems. So many of your rights are under assault... Contribute your money to people who speak out on your behalf, because the other side -- my side -- has a lot of it.\\" In the 2012 presidential election, he endorsed former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman Jr. Hanna supported reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. In 2013, he supported same-sex marriage, becoming the second Republican member of the House to do so (the first being Ileana Ros-Lehtinen). In June 2013, Hanna was the only Republican congressman to vote against proposed legislation to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy except for victims of rape or incest who have reported the crime to authorities. He opposes partial birth abortions, but stated that he was unable to support this legislation because it would cast aside exception for the health of the mother, and it fails to adequately account for unique circumstances that can arise after 20 weeks because every pregnancy is specific. In December 2015, Hanna‚Äîciting family responsibilities‚Äîannounced that he did not plan to run for re-election in 2016. Hanna indicated that a potential primary rematch with Claudia Tenney did not influence his decision not to seek re-election. He endorsed businessman Steve Wells as his successor, https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2016/06/rep_richard_hanna_endorses_steve_wells_to_succeed_him_in_congress.html but Wells lost the primary to Tenney, who won the seat in the general election. On August 2, 2016, Hanna became the first sitting Republican member of Congress to say that he would vote for Hillary Clinton for president over Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, referring to the Republican nominee as \\"a national embarrassment\\". In December 2016, Hanna said in an interview that the Republican Party had \\"gone to the far extremes on social issues.

Queen's Harvest picks up the story where B11 King's Festival left off; it can be played as a sequel to that adventure or by itself. Tailored for beginning Dungeon Masters and players, it is set in the country of Karameikos in the Mystara campaign setting, and contains adventuring tips for players. Plot summary In Queen's Harvest, the player characters must enter a dead wizard's lair to obtain the dangerous objects he left behind. The characters become embroiled in royal politics as the adventure progresses. The first half of the adventure presents a basic dungeon, while the second half offers an extended siege of an enemy stronghold where the player characters are greatly outnumbered and outgunned. They must slowly whittle away their adversaries, then withdraw to regroup and heal. Publication history B12 Queen's Harvest was written by Carl Sargent and published by TSR in 1989 as a 32-page booklet with an outer folder. Editing was done by Jim Lowder. Its product code is TSR 9261, and it is the sequel to B11 King's Festival. Reception Ken Rolston reviewed Queen's Harvest for Dragon magazine in July 1991. He felt that Queen's Harvest is more elaborate than King's Festival in its role-playing and tactical challenges, and that the basic dungeon presented had a smart design and interesting story. With regard to the portion of the adventure involving the siege of an enemy stronghold, he felt the \\"clear and detailed discussion and organization of the defenders' tactics and motives\\" creates the opportunity for players to incite \\"discord among defenders\\". He did point out a minor flaw: there is no tactical map of the Queen's Keep. He concluded the review by stating that King's Festival and Queen's Harvest \\"are absolutely the best introductory adventures in print for D&D-game-style; fantasy role-playing games (FRPGs).

They are known as Western Gangas to distinguish them from the Eastern Gangas who in later centuries ruled over modern Orissa. The Western Ganga sovereignty lasted from about 350 to 550, initially ruling from Kolar and later moving their capital to Talakad on the banks of the Kaveri River in modern Mysore district. Later, they ruled as an important feudatory of larger empires, the imperial Chalukyas of Badami and the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta. Economy In the late 10th century, major political changes were taking place in the Deccan. The Rashtrakutas were replaced by the emerging Western Chalukya Empire north of the Tungabhadra river and the Chola Dynasty saw renewed power south of the Kaveri river. The defeat of the Western Gangas to Cholas around 1000 resulted in the end of the Ganga influence over the region. Though territorially a small kingdom, the Western Ganga contribution to polity, culture and literature of the modern south Karnataka region is considered important. The Western Ganga kings showed benevolent tolerance to all faiths but are most famous for their patronage towards Jainism resulting in the construction of fine monuments in such places as Shravanabelagola and Kambadahalli. The kings of this dynasty encouraged the fine arts due to which literature in Kannada and Sanskrit flourished. 9th century Kannada writings refer to King Durvinita of 6th century as an early writer in Kannada language prose. Many classics were written on various subjects ranging from religion to elephant management. The Gangavadi region consists of the malnad region, the plains (Bayaluseemae) and semi-malnad with lower elevation and rolling hills being the buffer region. The main crops of the malnad were paddy, betel leaves, cardamom and pepper and semi-malnad with its lower altitude produced rice, millets such as ragi and corn, pulses, oilseeds and was the base for cattle farming.Adiga (2006), p6 The plains to the east are the flat lands fed by Kaveri, Tungabhadra and Vedavati rivers where cultivation of sugarcane, paddy, orchards of coconut, areca nut (adeka totta), betel leaves, plantain and flowers (vara vana) were cultivated.Adiga (2006), p10from the Melkote plates and Mamballi inscriptions, Medutambihalli inscription of 9th century (Adiga 2006, p53) The importance of excavation of new irrigation tanks and repairs to existing ones are reflected in epigraphs of the period which phrase it as Arasaru Kattida Kere (tank built by the king)Gattavadi plates of Neetimarga Ereganga II of 904, Betamangala inscription of Vaidumba feudatory, Nerilage inscription (Adiga 2006, p40) Elites such as gavundas (landlord), feudatory rulers, officials, mahajans (Brahmins), traders (setti) and even artisans contributed to tank building.Betamangala inscription, Karadihalli inscription of 1011, Nelluru inscription 1013, Agara inscription (Adiga 2006, p42) Other sources of water were wells, natural ponds and catchments of dams (Katta).Adiga (2006), p42 Inscriptions attesting to irrigation of previously uncultivated lands seems to indicate an expanding agrarian community.Adiga (2006), p45 Soil types that existed in various parts of the kingdom are mentioned, the earliest reference being a record of black soil (Karimaniya) in the Sinda-8000 territory and to red soil (Kebbayya mannu)from the Narasimhapura plates (Adiga 2006), p46From the Doddahomma inscription of Rachaballa IV of 977 (Adiga 2006, p47) Cultivated land was of three types; wet land, dry land and to a lesser extent garden land with paddy being the dominant crop of the region. Wet lands were called kalani, galde, nir mannu or nir panya and was specifically used to denote paddy land requiring standing water.Kittel in Adiga (2006), p48 A type of grain was harvested from a tall stout grass called Sejje.Chikkamagaluru inscription of 10th century (Adiga 2006, p49) Lands adjoining irrigation tanks were called maduvinamannu and was used for coconut and areca nut cultivation if the land was not extensive enough for paddy. Terrace type paddy cultivated land in the highlands was called makki. Millet, wheat (syamaka), barley and pulses were also cultivated to a smaller extent.Ramesh in Adiga (2006), p49Soraba inscription (Kittel in Adiga p50) The fact that pastoral economies were spread throughout Gangavadi region comes from references to cowherds in many inscriptions. The terms gosahasra (a thousand cows), gasara (owner of cows), gosasi (donor of cows), goyiti (cowherdess), gosasa (protector of cows) attest to this.Belagi inscription of 964, Sasarvalli inscription of 1001 (Krishna and Adiga 2006, p55/56) Donation of a thousand cows are mentioned though the actual number may have been fewer indicating that ownership of cows may have been as important as cultivable land and that there may have existed a social hierarchy based on this.Adiga (2006), p57 References to shepherds are uncommon though one inscription calls them Kurimbadere and the hamlets where they lived Kuripatti.Basaratti inscription (Adiga 2006, p58) Inscriptions mention cattle raids attesting to the importance of the pastoral economy, destructive raids, assaults on women (pendir-udeyulcal), abduction of women by bedas (hunter tribes), a result of the existing militarism of the age.From the Kodagu inscription of 11th century, Guduve inscription of 1032, Kambadahalli inscription of 979 (Adiga 2006, p59, p60, p63) Evidence shows that the gavundas, the people closely involved with land, its cultivation and cattle were chiefly involved in both defence against and responsible for such raids.Adiga (2006), p61 Lands that were exempt from taxes were called manya and sometimes consisted of several villages. They were granted by local chieftains without any reference to the overlord, indicating a de-centralised economy. These lands, often given to heroes who perished in the line of duty was called bilavritti or kalnad.From the Narasimhapura inscription of 9th century (Sircar and Ramesh in Adiga 2006, pp210-211) Sarva parihara (or sarva badha parihara) lands were those that were free from all or most taxes.Baradur grant of 725, Devarahalli inscription of 8th century (Adiga 2006, p211) Talavritti land grants were exempt from tax overheads, made without consent of the king for the maintenance of temples at the time of consecration.Indian epigraphical glossary, Hecca inscription pf 939 for SriKanteshvara temple (Adiga 2006, p213) Abhyantra siddi was an internal income or revenue payable to the village authorities even lower than the local chieftain. It may have also meant settlement of disputes over land by local authorities.From the Kotapalli inscription of 10th century (Sircar in Adiga 2006, p214) Some types of taxes on income were kara or anthakara (internal taxes), utkota were presents due to the king and hiranya were cash payments and sulika was tolls and duties levied on imported items. Taxes were collected from those who held the right to cultivate land, whether the land was actually cultivated or not.From Nonamangala copper plates of 5th century of King Avinita (Adiga 2006, p216)From the Kuppepalya inscription of 8th century (Adiga 2006, p218) Siddhaya was a local tax levied on agriculture and pottondi was levied on merchandise by the local feudal ruler. At times, based on context, pottondi meant 1/10 (a fraction), aydalavi meant 1/5, elalavi meant 1/7.Kotutu inscription of 9th century, Rampura inscription of 905 (Adiga 2006, p219) Mannadare literally meant land tax and was levied together with shepherds tax (Kurimbadere) payable to the chief of shepherds. Karudere and addadere taxes were collectable by corporate bodies from settlements outside their own area.Mankunda inscription of 913 Adiga (2006), p220 Bhaga was used to denote portion or share of the produce from land or the land area itself. Minor taxes such as Kirudere due to the landlords, samathadere raised by the army officers (samantha) are mentioned. In addition to taxes for maintenance of the local officer's retinue, villages were obligated to feed armies on the march to and from battle.Varuna inscription, (Adiga 2006, p223-224) Waste land and forest land which were more frequently granted in the eastern regions of the kingdom included brahmadeya (grants to Brahmins) and agricultural grants.Hosur plates of 762, Bhaktarahalli herotones of 870 (Adiga 2006, p229) Bittuvatta or niravari taxes comprised usually of a percentage of the produce and was collected for constructing irrigation tanks.Adiga (2006), p230 Notes References       * Category:Economic history of India Category:Historical economies of Karnataka Category:Medieval economics Category:Western Ganga dynasty ","title":"Economy of Western Ganga kingdom"},{"id":"11717483","text":"An achievement test is a test of developed skill or knowledge.

Achievement test scores are often used in an educational system to determine the level of instruction for which a student is prepared. High achievement scores usually indicate a mastery of grade-level material, and the readiness for advanced instruction. Low achievement scores can indicate the need for remediation or repeating a course grade. Under No Child Left Behind, achievement tests have taken on an additional role of assessing proficiency of students. Proficiency is defined as the amount of grade-appropriate knowledge and skills a student has acquired up to the point of testing. Better teaching practices are expected to increase the amount learned in a school year, and therefore to increase achievement scores, and yield more \\"proficient\\" students than before. When writing achievement test items, writers usually begin with a list of content standards (either written by content specialists or based on state- created content standards) which specify exactly what students are expected to learn in a given school year. The goal of item writers is to create test items that measure the most important skills and knowledge attained in a given grade-level. The number and type of test items written is determined by the grade-level content standards. Content validity is determined by the representativeness of the items included on the final test.

'Alƒ´ al-Bayhaqƒ´'s Tatimmat SiwƒÅn al-Hikma: A Biographical Work on Learned Men of the Islam. Osiris, 8, 122-217. He also wrote extensively on various calendrical systems and on the various manipulations of the calendars. He was the author of an encyclopedia on scales and water-balances. Life Al-Khazini was an emancipated slave in Marv, which was then one of the most important cities of Khorasan. He got his name from his master () who was the treasurer of Marv. The term khƒÅzin was simply the title of the royal treasurer since the early Islamic period. His master made provisions so that al-Khazini could obtain a first-class education. Some believe that al-Khazini was a pupil of Omar Khayyam. While this is not known, he wrote about Khayyam, in particular, he gave a description of the water-balance invented by him (and improved upon by Al-Isfizari). And according to some sources, he collaborated with him on the reformation of the Persian calendar in 1079.Mehdi Aminrazavi, The Wine of Wisdom: The Life, Poetry and Philosophy of Omar Khayyam, Oneworld Publications (2007) Al-Khazini was known for being a humble man. He refused thousands of Dinar for his works, saying he did not need much to live on because it was only his cat and himself in his household. Al-Khazini was one of only about twenty astronomers of the Islamic era who performed original observations. His works reached Byzantium in the 14th century, in particular, they were studied by George Chrysococces and later by Theodore Meliteniotes. Achievements Al Khazini seems to have been a high government official under Sanjar ibn Malikshah and the sultan of the Seljuk Empire. He did most of his work in Merv, where they are known for their libraries. His best-known works are \\"The Book of the Balance of Wisdom\\", \\"Treatise on Astronomical Wisdom\\", and \\"The Astronomical Tables for Sanjar\\". \\"The Book of the Balance of Wisdom\\" is an encyclopedia of medieval mechanics and hydrostatics composed of eight books with fifty chapters. It is a study of the hydrostatic balance and the ideas behind statics and hydrostatics, it also covers other unrelated topics. There are four different manuscripts of \\"The Book of the Balance of Wisdom\\" that have survived. The balance al-Khazini built for Sanjar's treasury was modeled after the balance al-Asfizari, who was a generation older than al- Khazini, built. Sanjar's treasurer out of fear destroyed al-Asfizari's balance; he was filled with grief when he heard the news. Al-Khazini called his balance \\"combined balance\\" to show honor towards Al-Asfizari. The meaning of the balance was a \\"balance of true judgment\\". The job of this balance was to help the treasury see what metals were precious and which gems were real or fake. In \\"The Book of the Balance of Wisdom\\" al-Khazini states many different examples from the Koran ways that his balance fits into religion. When al- Khazini explains the advantages of his balance he says that it \\"performs the functions of skilled craftsmen\\", its benefits are theoretical and practical precision. The \\"Treatise on Astronomical Wisdom\\" is a relatively short work. It has seven parts and each part is assigned to a different scientific instrument. The seven instruments include: a triquetrum, a dioptra, a \\"triangular instrument,\\" a quadrant, devices involving reflection, an astrolabe, and simple tips for viewing things with the naked eye. The treatise describes each instrument and its uses. \\"The Astronomical Tables for Sanjar\\" is said to have been composed for Sultan Sanjar, the ruler of Merv and his balance was made for Sanjar's treasury. The tables in \\"The Astronomical Tables for Sanjar\\" are tables of holidays, fasts, etc. The tables are said to have the latitudes and longitudes of forty-three different stars, along with their magnitudes and (astrological) temperaments. It is said that al-Khazini's observations for this work were probably done in Merv in various observatories with high quality instruments. See also * Al-Khazini, Book of the Balance of Wisdom (Eng).

Located approximately midway between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, near the settlement of Modi'in Illit and the city of Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut. It is named after Matityahu the Hasmonean, who lived in Modi'in (1 Maccabees 2:15-17). It falls under the jurisdiction of Mateh Binyamin Regional Council. In it had a population of . Matityahu was initially founded in 1981 by a group of English-speaking immigrants from the United States and elsewhere, and it is now home to a community of observant Jewish families. Matityahu vineyards sell grapes to Israeli winemakers. The community also has agricultural fields operated by independent contractors and rental properties in its commercial park. The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. Location and climate Matityahu is located in the foothills of the Judean Mountains of the West Bank, administered by the Matte Binyamin Regional Council. Matityahu is adjacent to the rapidly expanding Haredi city of Modi'in Illit and is across the highway from the community of Hashmonaim. Other towns in the immediate vicinity include Lapid, Kfar HaOranim, Kfar Ruth, and Shilat. Situated above sea level, Matityahu's climate is temperate. Summer temperatures range between during the day, with approximately 65% humidity during the hottest summer days. Winters are mostly mild, with frequent rain and seldom any snow. History According to ARIJ, Israel confiscated 645 dunams of land from the Palestinian town of Ni'lin in order to construct Matityahu.Ni‚Äôlin Town (Fact Sheet), ARIJ, p. 17 As of 2017, Matityahu consists of about 120 families and is expanding with the construction of dozens of new single-family homes. Of the current resident families, about half speak English at home (the others are primarily Hebrew-speaking). There is a wide range of ages ‚Äì from families with parents in their twenties to great- grandparents. Several households consist of parents who themselves grew up in Matityahu. A centrally important aspect of Matityahu is that it is a Litvish community with one rabbi and one synagogue. It is required that every family accepts Rabbi Zev Leff's (the community rabbi) da'at torah and halakhic rulings for all matters that may impact on others and respect the \\"united community\\" aspect of life in the community. Therefore, all residents are expected to be religiously observant and strict religious standards are demanded including a ban on television and videos. All homes are required to follow the kashrut standards set by Leff and women must dress with complete adherence to the specific tzniut standards. A significant number of men study Torah full-time in a kollel. The general philosophy of Matityahu differs from that of mainstream Israeli Haredi communities in a few key ways. Examples of these differences include readily accepting men who work in full-time jobs, allowing those who wish to acknowledge Independence Day to do so, and not demanding that men dress only in white shirts, jackets, and hats (although many do).

Griffith Dodson: The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia, 1940-1960 (Richmond: Virginia State Publication, 1961) p. 520 Early and family life Daniel was born on September 11, 1884 in Richmond, Virginia, the son of James Robertson Vivian Daniel, a Richmond lawyer, and Hallie Wise Daniel (n√©e Williams). Daniel was educated in the local schools and graduated from the University of Virginia in 1903. He married fellow Titanic survivor Eloise Hughes Smith in 1914, but divorced in 1923. On December 6, 1923, Daniel married Margery Durant, daughter of automobile executive William C. Durant, and they had one daughter, Margery Randolph Daniel (November 2, 1924 ‚Äì May 23, 2013). They too divorced and Daniel married Charlotte Bemiss Christian, a widow, who survived him. They had one son, Robert Williams Daniel, Jr. (March 17, 1936 ‚Äì February 4, 2012). A descendant of William Randolph, his great- grandfather Peter V. Daniel, was an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court, his great-great-grandfather Edmund Randolph, was the seventh Governor of Virginia, the first Attorney General of the United States and later served as Secretary of State. Career After graduating from the University of Virginia, Daniel embarked on a career in banking and management. His first job was in the traffic manager's office of the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad. His grandfather, Peter V. Daniel, Jr., had been president of the railroad from 1860 to 1871. About 1905, Daniel left RF&P; and entered the insurance business, becoming attached to the firm of Williams and Hart. He eventually succeeded Williams as district superintendent for the Maryland Life Insurance Company. In 1906, Daniel and a fellow district manager of Maryland Life, Charles Palmer Stearns, formed the insurance firm Daniel and Stearns. By 1911, Daniel was employed as a banker and living in Philadelphia. Business travel sometimes took him to Europe. In late 1911 while staying at the Carlton Hotel in London, the building caught fire and Daniel managed to save the life of a friend who was also staying at the hotel. Survivor of the RMS Titanic Daniel boarded the RMS Titanic in Southampton as a first-class passenger on the morning of 10 April 1912 to return to Philadelphia from a business trip to London. He paid ¬£30 10s (approximately USD$3,855 in 2020) for his ticket and was assigned one of the first-class staterooms at the forward end of Titanic's A-Deck. He brought along his champion French bulldog, named Gamin de Pycombe, which he had recently purchased for ¬£150 (the equivalent of about $18,960 in 2020). Later that evening when the ship stopped in Cherbourg, Daniel sent a brief three word telegram to his mother in Richmond to let her know he was \\"on board Titanic.\\" His dog was lost in the sinking. Daniel survived the tragedy, though the exact manner of his escape from Titanic remains a mystery and there is confusion over what lifeboat Daniel was rescued in. Press reports varied; at least one account claimed that he swam completely nude in the frigid North Atlantic for a number of hours before being hauled aboard a lifeboat barely conscious. It is much more plausible, given the below freezing water temperature, that Daniel simply climbed into one of the early lifeboats being launched from the starboard side of the stricken liner. At that point, few passengers thought the ship would actually sink and many were reluctant to board the lifeboats. As a result, seats in the lifeboats found few takers and some left the ship less than half-full.https://titanicfacts.net/titanic-lifeboats/ Some men were allowed into lifeboats filled with women and children ostensibly to man the oars. Daniel himself never said which lifeboat he was rescued in, if he even knew. It is possible that he was in more than one lifeboat between the time the ship sank and the arrival of the Carpathia which could account for the confusion. Some survivors reported seeing him in Lifeboat 5, launched at 12:43 A.M., the second one to leave the sinking ship. Third Officer Herbert Pitman, who was in charge of Lifeboat 5, said that after the sinking he wanted to row back to look for survivors in the water, but the passengers were fearful of being mobbed and capsized and persuaded him not to do this. Other accounts place Daniel in Lifeboat 3. Lifeboat 3 was kept on davits at the forward end of Titanic's starboard side. Even though it had a maximum capacity of 65 people, only around 32 people were in the lifeboat at both the time it was lowered from Titanic and when it arrived at the Carpathia. Once all the available women and children had been put into the boat, men, including several of the ship's stokers, were allowed to jump in. Then at around 12:55 A.M, First Officer William Murdoch supervised the lowering of the boat, which is believed to have been the fourth to leave the ship and the third to be lowered from the starboard side. It is possible that Daniel jumped from the sinking ship and found refuge on one of the collapsible lifeboats and was later transferred into another lifeboat such as lifeboat 4 which rescued five survivors directly from the sea after the sinking. When lifeboat 4, was lowered from Titanic it had approximately 30 people aboard; by the end of the night it had perhaps around 60 people aboard most of whom were transferred into it from other boats. The Sinking of the Titanic quotes Charles Lightoller who survived by clinging to overturned collapsible lifeboat B, as saying that after the sinking Daniel was rescued from the water by \\"a passing lifeboat\\". According to Daniel 's family lore, he was rescued by the \\"Unsinkable Molly Brown\\" (activist and philanthropist Margaret Tobin Brown of Denver) in Lifeboat 6, but there is no record of him being in that boat. A news article published in 1915 stated that Daniel was picked up by the lifeboat containing the woman who is now his wife. Mrs. Smith, whom he later married, is known to have been rescued in lifeboat 6. While aboard the rescue ship, RMS Carpathia, Daniel met fellow Titanic survivor, Eloise Hughes Smith, daughter of U.S. Representative James A. Hughes, whose husband, Lucian P. Smith, had died during the disaster. Daniel and Mrs. Smith were wed in a quiet ceremony in August 1914, but Daniel soon left for London on business and became stranded in England for two months when World War I broke out in Europe. Upon his return they settled in a stately home in Philadelphia's fashionable Rosemont neighborhood, and Daniel became stepfather to her son Lucian Jr. who was born eight months after the sinking. In 1916, Daniel left for military service, receiving an officer's commission in the U.S. Army. He rose to the rank of Major. By the time the war ended in 1918, the couple had separated. In contrast to his willingness to speak to reporters immediately after the sinking in 1912, in later years Daniel refused to talk about the Titanic disaster. This could have been due to the traumatic nature of the event, or the stigma that many surviving male passengers felt as survivors of a tragedy that had claimed the lives of so many women and children. It is also possible that the fantastic account of his survival that he gave reporters as a young man was a tall tale and Daniel, by then a prominent Virginia politician, did not want to answer questions. In a 1993 article by Daniel's granddaughter, she said that \\"he never talked about the Titanic disaster because, after all, he was a man, 28 years old, a very athletic and healthy man who survived, and the whole thing about women and children first was a stigma. So he never talked about it.\\" Bank executive, gentleman farmer and subsequent marriages Daniel was later named Vice President of Liberty National Bank in New York City and later became president and chairman of the board. After learning that Daniel was spending time with another woman in New York, his estranged wife, Eloise, asked for and was granted a divorce from him in March 1923, citing an \\"unknown blonde woman\\" in her claim. On December 6, 1923, Daniel married Mrs. Edwin Rutheven Campbell (n√©e Margery Pitt Durant; 1887-1969), daughter of William C. Durant, an automobile manufacturer who founded General Motors, in the Halsey Street Methodist Episcopal Church in Newark, New Jersey. This marriage produced one daughter, Margery Randolph Daniel (November 2, 1924 ‚Äì May 23, 2013). The Daniels purchased Brandon, one of the James River Plantations in Prince George County, Virginia in 1926, and restored the 18th century mansion. The couple divorced in September 1928, but Daniel kept the historic estate where he operated a dairy farm, maintained a stable of horses, and enjoyed hunting and shooting. Daniel ascribed his second divorce to a charm which he had unintentionally broken at the old estate. According to a Harrison family legend, a bride of long ago who was married beneath the chandelier in the stately main room of the mansion died on her wedding night. Her wedding ring was embedded in the plaster ceiling and the legend was created that whoever disturbed it would meet with bad luck in love. After purchasing Brandon in 1926, Daniel ordered renovations made to the dilapidated 160-year-old mansion. While workmen were repairing the ceiling a piece of plaster fell to the floor containing a wedding ring. The workmen took it to Daniel, who had it cleaned and polished and placed back beneath the chandelier. He said he was aware of the legend and feared the results of disturbing the ring. Two years later Margery sued for divorce. On October 10, 1929, Daniel married, for the third and final time, his distant cousin, Mrs. Frank Palmer Christian (n√©e Charlotte Randolph Bemiss; 1890-1968) of Richmond, Virginia. At this time Daniel was president of Liberty National Bank in New York City. Mrs. Christian's first husband had died in 1918 during military service. Later, Daniel became chairman of the board of the Richmond Trust Company. Their son, Robert Williams Daniel, Jr. was born in Richmond in March 1936. Daniel was a longtime parishioner of the Martin's Brandon Episcopal Church and donated several stained glass windows by Tiffany. He reputedly asked the church vestry to never play the hymn \\"Nearer, My God, to Thee\\" during services. The hymn is often cited as the last song played by the Titanic's band as the ship sank. Political career In 1935, Daniel was elected to the Senate of Virginia representing the 6th District, a part-time position. Daniel, a Conservative Democrat, was a political ally of Harry Flood Byrd and a close friend of his brother Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd. He held the seat until his death. Daniel served on the Governor's Advisory Board on the Budget and for ten years (appointed by three governors, Pollard, Peery and Price) and served on the State Board of Education until he resigned in 1937 to run for lieutenant governor. He later (in 1939) was appointed to the University of Virginia's Board of Visitors. Death and burial Although successful professionally and politically, Daniel privately struggled with alcoholism, failed marriages, post-traumatic stress and the stigma associated with having survived the Titanic disaster for much of his life. He died of cirrhosis of the liver on December 20, 1940 in Richmond and was interred in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond. Daniel's first wife and fellow Titanic Survivor, Eloise Smith, had died earlier the same year at the age of 46 in a sanitarium in Cincinnati. Daniel's son and namesake would later serve five terms in the United States Congress.

It follows its predecessors, id Tech 1, 2, 3 and 4, all of which have subsequently been published under the GNU General Public License. It was seen as a major advancement over id Tech 4. The engine was first demonstrated at the WWDC 2007 by John D. Carmack on an eight-core computer; however, the demo used only a single core with single-threaded OpenGL implementation running on a 512 MB 7000 class Quadro video card. id Tech 5 was first used in the video game Rage, followed by Wolfenstein: The New Order, The Evil Within and Wolfenstein: The Old Blood. It was followed up by id Tech 6. Features The initial demonstration of the engine featured 20 GB of texture data (using a more advanced MegaTexture approach called Virtual Texturing, which supports textures with resolutions up to 128,000 √ó 128,000 pixels), and a completely dynamic and changeable world. This technique allows the engine to automatically stream textures into memory as needed, meaning that developers need not concern themselves with memory restraints or texture limits. This has the advantage of simplifying the creation of content, by eliminating the need to adapt content for different platforms. The engine automatically optimizes resources for cross-platform development, making it possible to render the same models on different platforms, while creating them for only one platform, further simplifying cross-platform development. One of the visually evident features the renderer included is a penumbra in the shadowing (soft edges), by using shadow maps. In contrast, id Tech 4, which featured volume-based shadows, had very sharply defined shadows. Numerous other advanced graphical effects such as various materials for lighting, high dynamic range rendering- centric effects, bloom, crepuscular rays (volumetric lighting), radiosity, soft particles, pixel shader effects, alpha to coverage, post processing, Screen Space Reflection, dynamic water surfaces, procedural animation, cloth simulation, depth of field, and motion blur, are contained. Multi-threaded processing on the CPU is done for many of its tasks, including rendering, game logic, AI, physics, and sound processing. The engine comes with a content- creation tools package called id Studio, which is supposed to be much more user-friendly and polished than in earlier versions. Previously, content creation required artists to run various command-line tools beyond the level editor's own tools, while id Tech 5 allows for all work to be done 'in- engine'. While id Software will be using the engine solely for creating shooter games, the engine also has the capability to operate outside of this genre. Steve Nix from id Software stated that \\"Not only do we think people can make games outside the action-shooter space with our technology, we encourage it. We'd actually like to see those games made.\\" Marketing and licensing The engine was first publicly shown during the 2007 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference keynote address, then was later shown privately to an audience of potential licensees at E3 2007. The first public demonstration focusing exclusively on the engine took place at QuakeCon in the same year during the annual keynote held by John Carmack. An interview with John Carmack, the lead graphics engine developer at id (at the time), indicated that like its predecessors, id Tech 5 would eventually be released as open-source. The move to open source would likely come many years after id Tech 5's release as a proprietary engine. At QuakeCon 2007, Carmack told LinuxGames that he would integrate as little proprietary software as possible into id Tech 5, as \\"eventually id Tech 5 is going to be open source also. This is still the law of the land at id, that the policy is that we‚Äôre not going to integrate stuff that‚Äôs going to make it impossible for us to do an eventual open source release.\\" Carmack resigned from id in 2013, and no source code release followed the launch of id Tech 6 in 2016. At QuakeCon 2010, id CEO Todd Hollenshead announced that while id Tech 5 could be shared with internal ZeniMax Media developers, the engine will not be available for external licensing. On November 10, 2010 it was announced that the first ZeniMax internal developer to work with the engine would be MachineGames.

They are known as Western Gangas to distinguish them from the Eastern Gangas who in later centuries ruled over modern Orissa. The Western Ganga sovereignty lasted from about 350 to 550, initially ruling from Kolar and later moving their capital to Talakad on the banks of the Kaveri River in modern Mysore district. Later they ruled as an important feudatory to the imperial Chalukyas of Badami and the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta. Administration Panchakuta basadi of the 9th century at Kambadahalli The Western Ganga administration was influenced by some principles in ancient text Arthashastra. Succession to the throne was hereditary though there were instances when it was overlooked.Kamath (2001), p46 Though a feudatory of larger South Indian empires for most of their long rule, they wielded significant autonomy in local affairs. The kingdom was divided into Rashtra (district) and further into Visaya (possibly 1000 villages) and Desa. From the 8th century the Sanskrit term Visaya was replaced by the Kannada term Nadu, example of which are Sindanadu-8000, Punnadu-6000,Adiga (2006), p10 with scholars differing about the significance of the numerical suffix. They opine that it was the revenue yield of the division computed in cash terms,Rice in Adiga (2006), p15) denoted the number of fighting men in that division, the number of revenue paying hamlets in that division,Sharma in Adiga (2006), p16 and most popularly it may meant the number of villages included in that territory. Further it has been suggested that for large territories such as Gangavadi-96000, the \\"thousand\\" suffix may have meant one Nadu and hence Gangavadi-96000 was Gangavadi with 96 NadusSettar in Adiga 2006, p15 Inscriptions have revealed several administrative designations such as prime minister (sarvadhikari), treasurer (shribhandari), foreign minister (sandhivirgrahi), chief minister (mahapradhana) all of whom also served as commanders (dandanayaka), royal steward (manevergade), master of robes (mahapasayita), commander of elephant corps (gajasahani), commander of cavalry (thuragasahani), superintendent (antahpuradhyaksha), chief guard (mahapadiyara), betel leaf carrier (hadapada or adepa), royal secretary (rajasutradhari), private secretary (rahasyadhikrita), archivist of records (mahamatra or sasanadore), survey official (rajjuka), accountant (lekhaka).Kamath (2001), p47 In the royal house, Niyogis oversaw palace administration, royal clothing and jewellery etc.; the Padiyara were responsible for court ceremonies including door keeping and protocol.Adiga (2006), p238 Officials at the local level were the pergade, nadabova, nalagamiga, prabhu and gavunda.Adiga (2006), pp161-177 The pergades were superintendents from all social classes; artisan, goldsmith, blacksmith etc. pergades dealing with the royal household were called manepergade (house superintendent), when they collected tolls they were called Sunka vergades.From the Kanatur inscription (Adiga 2006, p161) The nadabovas were accountants and tax collectors at the Nadu level and sometimes functioned as scribes.From the Kanatur inscription (Adiga 2006, p164) The nalagamigas were officers who organized and maintained defence at the Nadu level.From the Mavali inscription of the 8th century and Indravalli inscription (Adiga 2006), p165 The prabhu constituted a group of elite drawn together to witness land grants and demarcation of land boundaries.Doddakunce inscription, the Karagada and Maruru inscription (Adiga 2006, p167-68) The gavundas who appear most often in inscriptions were the backbone of medieval polity of the southern Karnataka region. As landlords and local elite, the state utilized their services to collect taxes, maintain records of landownership, bear witness to grants and transactions and even raise militia when required.Bedirur inscriptions of 635 (Adiga 2006, p168) Owing strong personal allegiance to the king, they were vested with certain rights over villages.Adiga 2006, p173 It appears the gavundas operated as corporations in the Kaveri valley but as individuals in the northern and eastern domains of the Gangas. They had rights to make grants that may have been occasionally exempt of local taxes.Adiga (2006), p176-177 There were two types of gavundas; the ur-gavundas who were lower in status and wielded control at the village level and the nadu-gavunda who oversaw the Nadu and were directly appointed by the king.Adiga (2006), p20 Inscriptions that specify land grants, rights and ownership were descriptive of the boundaries of demarcation using natural features such as rivers, streams, water channels, hillocks, large boulders, layout of the village, location of forts (kote) if any in the proximity, irrigation canals, temples, tanks, even shrubs and large trees. Also included was the type of soil, the crops meant to be grown, tanks or wells to be excavated for irrigation.From the Kumsi inscription of 931 and Doddahomma inscription of 977 (Adiga 2006, pp21-22, p27, p29)From the Mavali inscription and Indivalli inscription (Adiga 2006, p31) Inscriptions mention wet land, cultivable land, forest and waste land.From the Devarahalli and Hosur copper plates (Adiga 2006, p33) There are numerous references to hamlets (palli) attesting to the hunter communities that existed (bedapalli).From inscriptions and literary writings such as Vaddaradhane (920) and Pampa Bharata (940) (Adiga 2006, p36-37) The size of land granted to the family of a hero who perished in defence of cattle raids was small compared to endowments made to heroes of inter-dynastic battles. These families received large tracts of land, hamlets or even villages in recognition of the sacrifice, the title held by the fallen hero at times passing on to the members of the family.Adiga (2006), p184 Feudal lords were military commanders who held the title arasa (from the 6th century onwards). These arasas were either Brahmins or from tribal background and controlled hereditary territories paying periodic tribute to the king.Adiga (2006), p208 The velavali, loyal bodyguards of the royalty were fierce warriors under oath (vele). They moved closely with the royal family and were expected to fight for the master and be willing to lay down their lives in the process. If the king died, the velavali were required to self immolate on the funeral pyre of the master. Thus a close bond existed between the master and the velavali who was referred to as manemaga (son of the house)Adiga (2006), pp233-234 Notes References       * Category:Western Ganga dynasty ","title":"Western Ganga administration"},{"id":"11717632","text":"Ute Oberhoffner (left) and Steffi Martin (1984) Ute Oberhoffner (left), Birgit G√∂rlitzer and Cerstin Schmidt (right) in Oberhofen (18 October 1986) Ute Oberhoffner ( Wei√ü, born 15 September 1961 in Ilmenau, Bezirk Suhl, sometimes shown as Ute Oberhoffner-Weiss) is an East German luger who competed during the 1980s.

The most important family members were the following: Jehiel Castellazzo Called Ashkenazi to signify that he was not by birth an Oriental, he was rabbi at Cairo in the sixteenth century. He was a contemporary of Yosef Karo, whom he severely criticized on account of a Halakha. Moses Castellazzo He lived during the seventeenth century. He is eulogistically mentioned in the responsa of Me√Ør Boton. Moses dal Castellazzo His name has been misread by copyists as Moses Kastilin. He was a portrait-painter who lived at Venice in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. He is highly praised by David Reubeni in his memoirs for having befriended the latter on his arrival in Venice from Arabia in 1524. Moses's reputation as an artist extended far beyond the limits of the ghetto of Venice; indeed, he was known throughout Italy. In 1521, in recognition of his great talent, the Council of Venice granted him the privilege of selling his woodcut illustrations of the Pentateuch. Simeon ben Jehiel Castellazzo He was rabbi at Cairo; died May, 1588. He was well versed in the Kabbalah, and was renowned for his great piety. David Conforte reports that he had seen a decision emanating from Joshua Soncin, rabbi of Constantinople at the time of Joseph Nasi, in which Soncin invokes the authority of Simeon ben Jehiel. Both Conforte and Joseph Sambari assert that Simeon wrote two works: (1) a collection of responsa, and (2) Megillot Setarim, a commentary, probably cabalistic, on the Book of Esther. Chaim Joseph David Azulai mentions as many as eighty responsa by Simeon. Moses ha-Kohen Abigdor Castellazzo He was the son of Simeon (above) and was rabbi at Salonica, Rhodes, Damascus, and Cairo in the seventeenth century. In Cairo he was the colleague of Aaron ben Chayyim. He was almost ninety years old at his death. Bibliography *Azulai, Chaim Joseph David, Shem ha-Gedolim, ed.

Its mission is to restore surface water flows for healthier streams in Oregon by using cooperative, free-market solutions. OWT was founded in 1993 by a group with diverse water interests who sought to utilize the \\"tools of the land trust movement...and apply the same approach to the acquisition of water\\". \\"With the success of OWT, water trusts have been created in Montana, Colorado, and Washington\\" with others emerging across the Western United States. Utilizing a transactional approach, the group focuses on streams where small amounts of water provide significant ecological benefits. The result is healthier streams for fish, wildlife, and people. Overview Oregon Water Trust targets efforts in those watersheds that have historically supported significant fisheries. Within each watershed, Oregon Water Trust identifies priority streams for which streamflow is a limiting factor for fish habitat and water quality and there is potential for acquiring water rights to convert to instream use to enhance flows. Oregon Water Trust concentrates acquisition efforts on small- to medium-sized tributaries that provide spawning and rearing for salmonids. In these systems, small amounts of water can provide significant ecological benefits. Oregon Water Trust uses ecological, hydrologic and water rights data to identify priority streams and evaluate potential water right acquisitions. Analysis of streamflows and habitat conditions includes: * Delineating fish use and distribution for each segment; * Documenting the current and historical ecological value of the waterway for fish; * Evaluating current habitat and water quality conditions; * Describing the current water availability situation; * Summarizing the relationship of the water right to other water rights in the stream segment; and * Evaluating the potential benefits of acquired water on fish habitat and water quality. Oregon Water Trust compiles data on species present, their habitat needs and endangered species listing status; instream conditions (e.g., flow alteration, temperature, water quality); and relation of instream conditions to riparian, upslope and watershed conditions and activities. Approach Oregon Water Trust's market-based approach provides water right holders in Oregon with a variety of incentives to convert their consumptive water rights to instream water rights. These include: income from marginally productive areas, replacement feed for lost production, funding for irrigation efficiency projects, a possible tax break for permanent donations of water rights, and flexibility in managing water rights. Partners Oregon Water Trust works with local and community groups, agency staff and others interested in water rights issues in order to add to, and not duplicate, the efforts of others. Whenever possible, Oregon Water Trust strives to work with communities to create cooperative solutions that benefit all parties. Oregon Water Trust's board of directors represents agricultural, environmental, legal and tribal perspectives. This diverse board membership allows the organization to openly and effectively address the concerns of rural Oregonians regarding their livelihoods and the conservation of aquatic resources.  Project history  It has been over 13 years since Oregon Water Trust completed their first paid lease with a rancher on Buck Hollow Creek in the Deschutes Basin. Since then Oregon Water Trust has increased their effectiveness dramatically. In 1994, the Oregon Water Trust water portfolio amounted to two leases totaling per second (40 L/s). Today, their portfolio has grown to 160 ft¬≥/s (4,500 L¬≥/s) protected for instream use in 86 streams, representing in aggregate the equivalent to the flow of the Applegate River in August. Over the year, this constitutes of water. The Oregon Water Trust has implemented successful projects in basins which include the Deschutes, John Day, Willamette, and Rogue rivers.

It represents an alternate history of the real world where ideas such as interstellar travel and superhuman abilities are commonplace. It is also the name of one of three brands launched by Wildstorm to help differentiate their titles set in the same universe from other, separate titles.Wildstorm Unveils New Branding , Comics Bulletin Originally launched as part of the Image Universe, it broke off as its own separate universe during the \\"Shattered Image\\" storyline. Fictional history The Wildstorm Universe began as part of the Image Comics Universe. During Shattered Image, Wildstorm broke off from Image and constituted a separate universe. The Wildstorm's universe represents an alternate history of the real world, with further similarities to other comic book universes (especially the DC Universe). Interstellar travel and alien races, including the Kherubim and Drahn, are taken for granted, and centuries or more of alien contact gave rise to a distinctive mythology in Wildstorm worlds. Fictional technologies, or technologies only theoretically possible in the real world, are present in the Wildstorm Universe. Superhuman agents are commonplace and involved in world politics: Stormwatch dealt extensively with the United Nations, and The Authority took over governance of the United States. D'rahn The D'rahn are an alien race. They are humanoid in appearance, but are generally larger than humans with grey skin and red eyes without visible iris or pupil. Three bony ridges are on the top of their head. Their ears are rudimentary, little more than large openings in the sides of their heads. There are similar openings in their cheeks, but the purpose of these openings is unclear. Their hands have large claws and a female D'rahn also showed extendable bone claws. While there are recursive traits among members of the D'rahn such as superior Strength, Speed, Flight, Invulnerability, Etc. some possess traits unique to their social standing or generally from individual to individual for starters; Alphas of the hive like breed withhold greater power levels than that of even Kherubim Lords. Other have energy generative and manipulation capability one of the extraterrestrial's most distinguishing feature; prominent only within the female of the species, being the ability of accelerated genetic progression in the form of controlled evolution dubbed 'The Enlightenment'. A process where a fecund entity of their tribe can rework another sentient's very DNA to enhance and progress their developmental evolution by injecting them with her stinger vastly augmenting preexisting attributes and bestowing newer, greater power unto the host involved or irrepressibly destabilize it causing catastrophic biological atrophy and inevitable destruction by effectively rending their very matriculation asunder. Metahumans Superpowered characters in Wildstorm, other than those bioengineered for superhuman powers, represent four categories of metahuman: * Alien-human hybrids: Hybrids are the result of interbreeding between humans and aliens, notably the Kherubim and Daemonites. Examples include Voodoo (a Human-Kherubim/Daemonite hybrid), Warblade (a Human-Shaper hybrid), Maul (a Human-Titanthrope hybrid), Backlash and Winter (both Human-Kherubim Lord hybrids). * Gen-Actives are those people who were exposed to the Gen-Factor serum giving them special abilities. Examples include the DV8, Gen¬π¬≥, and Team 7. * Seedlings: Seedlings are people who were mutated at birth due to a radiation of a special comet that passed close to Earth. Many who were exposed to this comet became superhumans and were known as \\"Comet Enhanciles\\" or \\"Seedlings\\". Examples include Battalion, Diva, Hellstrike, Fuji, and Swift. * Century Babies: They are humans that were born \\"with the century\\" - on the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve. As they grew each displayed certain superhuman abilities and skills, as well as immortality (not ageing beyond their 20s, late 30s or early 40s). It has been theorized that they act as an immune system for the planet. Each of them supposedly represents an aspect of the century into which they were born. Some of them are Jenny Sparks, Jenny Quantum and Elijah Snow. Origin of Gen-active humans In the Wildstorm Universe, one of the sources of superhuman powers is the Gen-factor. The Gen-factor was discovered by Dr. Simon Tsung, who found it in the body of young Ethan McCain, a reincarnation of the extradimensional hero, Sigma. Tsung worked for Project: Genesis, a project run by International Operations for national defense purposes, but Tsung left when he found out that I.O.-leader Miles Craven had his own plans for the use of the Gen-factor. Tsung's work was continued by his prot√©g√© Gabriel Newman and after many failures, the first truly successful application of the Gen-factor was the exposure of Team 7 to the substance. Miles Craven later contacted Kaizen Gamorra and had him create a synthesized version of the Gen-factor. Ivana Baiul, an I.O.-operative and scientist was charged with the creation of activator and booster drugs that would activate and enhance the powers of people who had the Gen-factor, turning them Gen-Active. After Team 7, other experiments were done on humans of their generation; Team 7 and the other successful experiments were all labelled as Gen 12. Kaizen also started selling his synthesized Gen-factor to everyone who could afford it. This led to Gen-active humans worldwide, but many of them were highly unstable and none were as powerful as Team 7. Project: Genesis restarted 15‚Äì20 years later and the subjects this time were the children of Gen 12. Craven hoped that the younger subjects were easier to control and that being born with the Gen- factor made their powers more stable. Apart from children of Gen 12, other children exposed to the Gen-factor in various ways were recruited as well. This time the subjects were labelled as Gen¬π¬≥, though this name was taken by a small group of Gen¬π¬≥ Gen-Actives. Another group took the name DV8 (also known as the Deviants). Many other Gen-Active teenagers have been seen over the years, mostly the result of various I.O.-experiments; like Nate, Tommy, Sadie (Voodoo Doll) and Leslie (Trauma Queen), four Gen-Actives that befriended Gen¬π¬≥ and jokingly called themselves \\"The Mongolian Barbecue Avengers\\". Powers of Gen-active humans All Gen-Active humans have a telepathic link to each other. This link usually is very weak, even unnoticeable to most, but stronger between relatives (they sometimes can feel when a relative is in extreme pain). The link also allows sensitive Gen-Actives to notice the presence of other Gen-Actives. In case of Team 7, the link also made the sum of their powers greater than each member's individual powers. The powers that individual Gen-Actives receive, seem to be completely random; most of Team 7 gained strong telepathic and telekinetic powers and some gained a healing factor. Their children though have displayed very different and unique abilities. In addition to humans, at least one human/Kherubim hybrid (Backlash) has also been affected by the Gen-Factor. It has also affected animals, and was used in creating the Kindred. List of notable Gen-Active characters * Copycat (Gem Antonelli) * Threshold (Matthew Callahan) * Bliss (Nicole Callahan) * Stephen Callahan * Grifter (Cole Cash) * Grunge (Percival Edmund Chang) * Absolom Chang * Philip Chang * Deathblow (Michael Cray) * Jackson Dane * Freestyle (Jocelyn Davis) * Alex Fairchild * Caitlin Fairchild * Sublime (Rachel Goldman) * Evo (Michael Heller) * Burnout (Bobby Lane) * John Lynch * Sigma (Ethan McCain) * Powerhaus (Hector Morales) * Jet/Crimson (Jodie Morinaka Slayton) * Sarah Rainmaker * Backlash (Mark Slayton) * Freefall (Roxy Spaulding) * Damocles (Simon Tsung) Earth-50 Though storylines in The Authority had portrayed Wildstorm as a multiverse, the 2006-7 DC Comics event 52 situated the Wildstorm Universe as a single parallel universe among 52 such realities in the DC Comics Multiverse. 52 made crossovers between DC and Wildstorm titles likely. The first of these occurred in Countdown Presents: The Search for Ray Palmer - Wildstorm, a team called the Challengers visit the Wildstorm Universe on their tour of the multiverse in search of Ray Palmer, the only person capable of stopping a forthcoming Great Disaster. The Challengers conflicted with the Authority, who had killed a speedster left by Palmer as a marker that he had passed through. The fight ended when Majestic interceded and forced the Authority to let the Challengers go. Meanwhile, Gen13 characters encountered another group of DC characters bent on stopping the Challengers. Titles Major titles set in the WildStorm Universe include: *21 Down *Allegra *The Authority *Backlash *Black Ops *Brass *Cybernary *Deathblow *Divine Right *DV8 *Gen12 *Gen¬π¬≥ *Grifter *Jet *The Kindred *The Monarchy *Mr. Majestic *Planetary *Point Blank *Sleeper *Stormwatch *Team Zero *Team One *Team 7 *Union *Wetworks *WildC.A.T.s *Wildcore Team 7 Team 7 was one of the first comics that served as the backbone in the Wildstorm Universe. It showcased the early days of major characters from many of the ongoing WSU series. Grifter, Dane, Backlash, John Lynch, and Deathblow all starred in books at the time. The first Team 7 series was four issues and showed how the characters were exposed to a chemical weapon that resulted in their gaining of a \\"Gen-Factor\\" which later was the source to many Wildstorm characters. The second miniseries was three issues, the first of which served as a prologue to the first Wildstorm Universe crossover. The final Team 7 miniseries was four issues and helped fill in many of the previously referenced plot points that helped to explain the characters' relationships in the present (why Grifter and Backlash hate each other, how John Lynch lost his eye, and Jackson Dane's apparent amnesia). Team One was, chronologically, a precursor team to Team 7, having character overlaps. WildC.A.T.S. Many Wildstorm Universe stories referred to the Kherubium/Daemonite War, a fictional historical event explored in most depth in the WildC.A.T.S series. WildC.A.T.s/Aliens A storyline that crossed over WildC.A.T.S, Stormwatch, and the movie franchise Aliens brought significant changes to the Wildstorm Universe, killing off many established characters and laying the ground for the Wildstorm Universe's new flagship series, The Authority. Captain Atom: Armageddon Captain Atom: Armageddon first issue In 2005/2006, DCU character Captain Atom appeared in a nine-part limited series entitled Captain Atom: Armageddon under DC's WildStorm imprint. In this title, he wore the yellow/red outfit seen in the Kingdom Come series.SDCC Day 3: Will Pfeifer Talks Captain Atom: Armageddon, Newsarama, July 16, 2005 In the story, Captain Atom experiences a time-shift at the moment of his apparent 2005 death in Superman/Batman, transporting him to the WildStorm Universe. He quickly gets into and appears to win a fight with an overzealous Mr. Majestic. Observing the frightened reactions of onlookers, and puzzling over his own altered appearance, he realizes that he has somehow become trapped on an alternate Earth, one where superheroes are feared by the general populace. Mistaken by the local superheroes as the force destined to destroy their universe, he was in fact an instrument used ultimately by Nikola Hanssen, new host for half the essence of the Void, to reclaim her whole power (partially lodged in his own body, and the cause of his altered appearance). During the story, Atom at first cooperates with both WildC.A.T.s and The Authority; as the story closes, these two teams become enemies and are all killed, as Void triggers the reboot of the WildStorm universe.Jim Lee Sets The Stage For WorldStorm in Captain Atom: Armageddon #9, Newsarama, May 18, 2006 Worldstorm The 'reboot' set the ground for a November 2006 relaunch of many Wildstorm titles. At first, the new titles appeared to include major changes to Wildstorm continuity; as stories progressed efforts were made to explain these changes so as to preserve continuity from before the Worldstorm event. The relaunched titles were: * Wildcats by Grant Morrison and Jim Lee‚Äîcancelled with issue #1. * Wetworks by Mike Carey and Whilce Portacio‚Äîcancelled with issue #15. * The Authority by Grant Morrison and Gene Ha‚Äîcancelled with issue #2. * Gen¬π¬≥ by Gail Simone and Talent Caldwell. * Deathblow by Brian Azzarello and Carlos D'Anda‚Äîcancelled with issue #9. New titles included: * Stormwatch: Post Human Division by Christos Gage and Doug Mahnke. * The Midnighter by Garth Ennis and Chris Sprouse‚Äîcancelled with issue #20. * Welcome to Tranquility by Gail Simone and Neil Googe‚Äîcancelled with issue #12. During this period in Wildstorm's publishing history, the DC Comics year-long series 52 reimagined the Wildstorm Universe as part of the DC Multiverse, designating it Earth-50.52: Week Fifty-Two World's End The Worldstorm relaunch faltered as 2007 drew on. Both flagship titles, The Authority and Wildcats, were slated to be written by Grant Morrison with \\"Wildcats\\" drawn by Jim Lee and \\"The Authority\\" drawn by Gene Ha, but the pair encountered serious delays. Only one issue of Wildcats' and two of The Authority ever shipped. Eventually, amid disapproving fan reaction, both series were cancelled.NYCC '08: The Grant Morrison Panel, Newsarama, April 19, 2008 Before the announcement that Morrison's series would not continue, Christos Gage filled in with The Authority: Prime. The series shipped promptly, and Gage was hired to write a new cross-universe series Wildstorm: Armageddon. Armageddon comprised six one-shots based on six of the relaunched titles, and led into successive bi-weekly limited series Wildstorm: Revelations and Number of the Beast. These culminated in the World's End storyline, beginning July 2008, which documented worldwide catastrophe and saw several Wildstorm titles relaunched with new creative teams and a new status quo for the universe.NYCC '08: LIVING IN THE RUINS: WS Editor Ben Abernathy on 'Worlds End', Newsarama, April 19, 2008 World's End titles: * Wildcats by Christos Gage, Neil Googe and Trevor Hairsine * The Authority by Dan Abnett/Andy Lanning and Simon Coleby * Stormwatch: Post Human Division #13 by Ian Edginton and Leandro Fernandez/Francisco Paronzini * Gen¬π¬≥ #21 by Scott Beatty and Mike Huddleston Wildstorm editor Ben Abernathy described this storyline as a new direction for the Wildstorm Universe: > [T]his direction evolved following our WorldStorm launch a few years ago. > Looking at the landscape of the industry, we realized we needed to move our > universe in a different direction, something that the ‚ÄúBig Two‚Äù couldn‚Äôt, or > wouldn‚Äôt, do for a long period of time.

The term \\"Yeltsinism\\" occurs most often with negative connotations. Yeltsin's critics blame him for the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, which Russian President Vladimir Putin called \\"The geopolitical catastrophe of the century\\". Others imply that Yeltsinism involves the outward appearance of democracy while actually concentrating power in a form of authoritarianism and consider the current political system in Russia (often called Putinism) \\"a continuation and rejection of Yeltsinism\\".

Vocalist Nolen Strals and bassist Bruce Willen also comprised the graphic design team Post Typography, which has done work for some very high-profile clients, including The New York Times. Hence, Double Dagger made a habit of referring to their style of post-hardcore as \\"graphicdesigncore\\" early in their career. In October 2011, Double Dagger broke up after a small final tour. Their final EP 333 was released in April 2013 alongside a documentary of their final tour, entitled If We Shout Loud Enough.  History  Nolen Strals and Bruce Willen had previously been in a group called League of Death, which was initially conceived as a heavy metal outfit, but later became a hardcore band. League of Death broke up in 2002 after a final show with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, giving rise to Double Dagger, as a self-described \\"graphicdesigncore\\" band, with several songs referencing design and typographic elements on their first releases (the band itself was named after the typographic symbol ‚Ä°, used for footnotes). Brian Dubin, who had previously played bass in Baltimore rock band Stars of the Dogon and guitar in Baltimore's beloved Charm City Suicides during their final year, joined the new band as a drummer and played on the bands' first few recordings, including their self-titled debut album. He left in 2005 and was replaced by Denny Bowen, then of Yukon, formerly of the band Economist, with whom Double Dagger had released a split single in 2003. During their 9-year run, Double Dagger played with a number of high-profile acts, including Pere Ubu, Lightning Bolt, The Ex, The Buzzcocks, The Jesus Lizard, and Matt & Kim. They have released several EPs, 7\\" singles, and three full length albums. The band earned considerable critical praise as well, as evinced by positive reviews in publications such as The Washington Post, Punk Planet, Baltimore City Paper and Rolling Stone. Citing time restraints and \\"chaotic personal lifes,\\" Double Dagger announced they would break up following a brief tour of the eastern United States, and a final show in their hometown of Baltimore.

The route travels northeast through small towns in the western Panhandle, reaching an intersections with U.S. Highway 385 at Hereford. The route continues on, reaching Canyon. There it turns north, and merges with Interstate 27 and U.S. Highway 87. This concurrence continues until it reaches Amarillo. I-27 ceases at the intersection with Interstate 40. US 60 and 87 continue north, being joined by U.S. Highway 287. On the north side on Amarillo, US 60 departs to the east on Amarillo Avenue. This route is currently Business Route 40, and is a portion of Historic Route 66. US 60 and Business I-40 split just northeast of the Amarillo Airport, with US 60 continuing to the northeast. The route passes through Panhandle and Pampa, before reaching a concurrence with U.S. Highway 83 in Hemphill County. The routes then split again, with US 60 travelling northeast to the Oklahoma state line near Higgins in Lipscomb County. History The section of US 60 from New Mexico to Amarillo was originally a portion of the Ozark Trail and paralleled the Panhandle and Santa Fe Railway, part of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. When Texas began numbering their highway system, the Ozark Trail received the numbering of State Highway 13. By 1920, the entire US 60 route had been renumbered as State Highway 33, or its spur SH 33A, with the northeastern portion also following the AT&SF; Railway. By the mid-1920s, the entire route had become an extension of the Abo Pass Highway, and was SH 33 along the entire length. In 1928, the AASHO added the highway to the U.S. Highway System as U.S. Highway 164, with the Texas section being signed in 1929. It was renumbered as US 60 on June 8, 1931, when the route was extended to Los Angeles, California to make it a coast to coast highway.

Route description US 87 begins at an intersection with State Highway 238 in Port Lavaca, Texas. It takes a northwesterly route out of the town, and follows this path all the way to Cuero, where it merges with (and is briefly co-signed with) US 183 before turning back toward the north. US 87 follows a gentle northwesterly route until just before Smiley, where it takes a more due-westerly turn.

Grebe was built by the Staten Island Steam Boat Co., was launched 17 December 1918; it was sponsored by Miss Emma Youmans and commissioned at the Brooklyn Navy Yard 1 May 1919; Lt. Niels Drustrup was in command. It served in many capacities until it was destroyed by a hurricane in 1943.  Post-World War I mine clearance  From 9 July 1919 until 1 October, Grebe, based at Kirkwall, Orkney, was part of a minesweeper flotilla clearing the North Sea of mines laid by the Allies during World War I. She returned to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, 28 November 1919 via Davenport, Brest, Lisbon, the Azores, Bermuda, and New York. After extensive repairs, Grebe moved to the Boston Navy Yard 4 November 1920; from there she sailed the coast from Maine to New Jersey calibrating radio compass stations and doing miscellaneous towing and rescue work. On 29 April 1921 she rescued 139 passengers from the Portuguese steamer , which had run aground off the Massachusetts coast.  North Atlantic operations  Grebe's next duty took her to Newport, Rhode Island, on 2 June; she depth-charged the target submarine off Taylor's Point, sinking her 23 June in of water.DANFS USS G-1 After participating in salvage operations, Grebe returned to Boston, Massachusetts, on 22 July to resume radio compass station calibration and other duties. From there she made a round trip to Norfolk, Virginia, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and the Panama Canal Zone which occupied her from 1 December 1921 until 18 March 1922, when she returned to Portsmouth. There she decommissioned 12 May 1922. Grebe was recommissioned on 15 November 1922, Chief Boatswain Albert C. Fraenzel commanding. On 16 December she sailed for St. Thomas, capital of the Virgin Islands, where she served as station ship until 1931. Grebe made an average of a trip a week between St. Thomas, St. Croix, and San Juan carrying stores and passengers, both military and civilian; she also towed coal barges and dredges to San Juan, Fort de France, Martinique, and other Caribbean ports. While at St. Thomas, Grebe was invaluable in assisting disabled ships, mainly those grounded on coral reefs, and in searches for missing ships. This work was interrupted by a yearly five- week repair period at Charleston, South Carolina.  Hurricane rescue work  Grebe's finest moment came in 1930. A hurricane laid waste large parts of the Dominican Republic and killed thousands in September. Carrying trained medical men and emergency supplies, Grebe was the first ship to reach devastated Santo Domingo. She remained there for two weeks, helping unload other ships and clear debris. 17 March 1931 Grebe brought Dr. Paul M. Pearson, Governor- appointee, and his staff from San Juan to St. Thomas; nucleus of the Virgin Island's first civilian government.  Towing the USS Constitution  Grebe then returned to Boston, Massachusetts. There on 12 July 1931 she took in tow historic sailing frigate . A long campaign had resulted in restoration of the famed ship to its original condition, and Grebe was to spend the next three years as her tender and towing ship as they visited every major American port, East and West Coast. Millions of Americans thrilled to their heritage touring \\"Old Ironsides\\" in New York City, Norfolk, Key West, Galveston, Guantanamo, Los Angeles, Seattle, Bellingham, Portland, and the Panama Canal Zone.  Transfer to the Pacific Ocean  On 12 May 1934 Grebe relinquished her duties with Constitution, entering the Philadelphia Navy Yard for overhaul. After a brief tour of duty at Norfolk, Virginia, 21 August to 14 September, she sailed for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, towed for fleet gunnery practice until 12 October, then sailed to San Pedro, California, arriving 19 November. Operating there until mid-1940; she performed a variety of tasks, including towing for target practice, participating in fleet problems, minesweeping exercises, training squadron details, and harbor service. Her tour there was interrupted by two voyages, the first to Pearl Harbor 6‚Äì31 May 1935 for fleet problems and the second to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Norfolk, Virginia, 26 December to 7 May 1939 for gunnery exercises.  Pearl Harbor assignment  Sailing from San Pedro, California, 3 June 1940, Grebe arrived in Pearl Harbor on 17 June to tow for gunnery and bombing practice, and participate in minesweeping training. Two trips back to the mainland, 1 August to 9 September and 27 September to 13 October 1941, in company with on passenger and stores runs interrupted her Hawaiian duty.  Under attack at Pearl Harbor  Grebe was in yard availability at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. Her 3-inch guns had been dismantled for the overhaul so she could fight only with rifles and pistols. She was credited with shooting down one of three unidentified planes flying low over the Navy Yard. On 24 January Grebe departed for Palmyra Island with fuel oil barge YO-43 in tow where she arrived five days later. She returned to Honolulu on 5 February and continued from there until autumn. Her classification was changed to Fleet Tug AT-134 on 1 June 1941. On 30 September Grebe joined a convoy for Johnston Island and returned on 9 October. On 9 November 1942 Grebe was underway again with lighter YC-737 and YB-9 in tow and accompanying YO-44, for Canton Island. Calling there on 25 November she proceeded to Pago Pago, Samoa arriving on 28 November.  Run aground and broken up by a hurricane  On 6 December 1942, Grebe was grounded while attempting to float at Vuata Vatoa, Fiji Islands. Salvage operations were broken up by a hurricane that destroyed both ships on 1‚Äì2 January 1943. Her name was struck from the Navy List 28 July 1943.

Located east of Glenwood and Alma, it was founded in the 1880s at the bottom of Silver Creek Canyon to support the gold and silver mines in the surrounding mountains. The \\"Little Fannie\\" mine became the most important employer for the town. During the 1890s Mogollon had a transient population of between 3,000 and 6,000 miners. Because of its isolation it had a reputation as one of the wildest mining towns in the West.Till, T. and Jordan, T. (2001) Great Ghost Towns of the West.

During this period of growth, Mogollon absorbed the population of nearby Cooney, and helped towns like Glenwood, Gila and Cliff grow because of their locations along the trail to the town. Between 1872 and 1873 the stagecoach from Mogollon to Silver City was robbed 23 times by the same assailant. He was eventually apprehended by agents of the Wells Fargo.Hardin, J. (2006) p. 96. Little Fanny was an extremely dusty mine. Miner's consumption, a series of ailments affecting miners, caused miners to work at Little Fanny for three years or less. In response the owners developed a method of spraying water from the jackhammers as they broke the quartz for removal, thus reducing airborne dust. In 1909, the population of Mogollon was about 2,000. That same year the town had five saloons, two restaurants, four merchandise stores, two hotels and several brothels located in two red light districts. The town also had a photographer, the Midway Theatre, an ice maker, and a bakery. The Silver City and Mogollon Stage Line provided daily service, hauling passengers, freight, gold, and silver bullion 80 miles between the two towns in almost 15 hours. By 1915, payroll in Mogollon was $75,000 monthly.(nd) Mogollon, New Mexico mining camps . New Mexico Wanderings. Retrieved 6/12/07. The community expanded to a population of 1,500 that year, with electricity, water, and telephone facilities. The school offered education to about 300 students. From early in its life, Mogollon was plagued by a series of fires and floods. The first big fire of 1894 wiped out most of the town buildings, which were made of wood. Fires followed in 1904, 1910, 1915, and 1942. Citizens usually immediately rebuilt, each time using more stone and adobe. Floods rushed through Silver Creek in 1894, 1896, 1899, and 1914. They washed away mine tailings, dumps, bridges, houses, and people. During WWI, the demand for gold and silver dropped, and many of Mogollon's mines shut down. The population in 1930 had dropped to a reported 200. The town grew again during a short resurgence in gold value during the late 1930s, but during World War II it shrank again, never recovering its stature.

Holland General Store The entire Mogollon community was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Fannie Hill Mill and Company Town Historic District in 1987. It was cited for its industrial and architectural legacy from 1875 through 1949. Several mines were built in the Mogollon area, including the Little Fanny, Champion, McKinley, Pacific, and Deadwood. Together with older prospectors they extracted approximately $1.5 million of gold and silver in 1913, about 40% of New Mexico's precious metals for that year. In their lifetime, over 18 million ounces of silver were taken from the mines of the Mogollon Mountains, which was one-quarter of New Mexico's total production. Close to $20 million in gold and silver were extracted, with silver accounting for about two-thirds of the total. Many regarded Silver City as merely a railhead for Mogollon's eight-team freight wagons packed with gold and silver ore.(2004) Ghost Town Mogollon 'Reopens' for Summer . New Mexico Department of Tourism. Retrieved 6/13/07. With the decline in precious metal values after World War I, it was no longer profitable to continue operating the mines. The town grew again after a brief recovery in prices in 1937, but WWII again caused a slash in the demand for precious metals. This, accompanied by the devastating fire of 1942, almost finished the town. In 1952 the Little Fanny was the only mine in operation. Today it is silent. When the Little Fanny mine closed, Mogollon deteriorated.Mazzio, J. (2003) Mogollon ‚Äî a seven mile-high ghost town . SouthernNewMexico.com. Retrieved 6/13/07.

In Texas, the highway enters the state from New Mexico at Farwell, near the Panhandle region. Major cities along the highway include Lubbock, Abilene, Waco and Palestine. The highway exits Texas into Louisiana near Joaquin, crossing the Toledo Bend Reservoir. Route description US 84 enters into Texas at Farwell, concurrent with US 70 from New Mexico. The US 70 overlap ends in Muleshoe. US 84 bypasses the towns of Littlefield and Shallowater before entering Lubbock. The highway just passes north of the Texas Tech University campus and enters downtown as Avenue Q. As Avenue Q, the highway parallels I-27 before crossing it, just north of that highway's southern terminus. Leaving the city, US 84 serves the towns of Post and Snyder before reaching Roscoe, where it begins its overlap with I-20. The two highways run through Sweetwater before reaching Abilene. US 84 leaves the interstate on the western side of the city, running with I-20's business loop. US 84 joins US 83/US 277, with US 277 leaving the concurrency after a short distance. US 84 leaves US 83, northeast of Tuscola. US 84 runs southeast to Coleman, overlapping with US 283 in the process and joining US 67. After leaving Brownwood, US 84 leaves US 67 and joins US 183. US 84 becomes a solo route again in Goldthwaite, traveling through Gatesville. In Gatesville, the hwy meets SH 36, which coincidentally also runs to Abilene, albeit in a more direct way than US 84. East of McGregor, US 84 becomes a 4-lane divided highway before becoming a freeway in Woodway. At SH 6, US 84 becomes a surface street, running through Waco. The highway enters Bellmead before leaving the Waco area. Several miles to the east, the highway enters Palestine. US 84 runs through several smaller communities before crossing over the Toledo Bend Reservoir, into Louisiana, running towards Mansfield. US 84 is part of the El Camino East/West Corridor, which spans five states starting in Texas. Future Studies are underway to build a completely new route of US 84 around the city of Lubbock, in an attempt to relieve traffic going into the city. This bypass, tentatively named Loop 88, is to start construction in 2020. In Abilene, Winters Freeway from Canyon Rock Road to FM 707 is beginning upgrades. This includes converting two-way frontage roads to one-way, adding u-turns, removing the crossover of Iberis Road and building a crossover near Lytle Creek. An upgrade is in progress along US 84 from Ritchie Road to Harris Creek Road; this includes implementing a divide-interchange with Speegleville Road in south Waco. 70px 70px US 84 in Tenaha between the US 59/US 96/Future I-69/Future I-369 interchange and just about 2 miles east of the interchange will become I-69. This would allow for heavy traffic on I-69 not have to slow down throughout Tenaha. This segment is expected to start work in 2016. The interchange with US 59/US 96 currently is being upgraded to Interstate standards. US 96's northern terminus will remain, and this is expected to be the southern terminus of I-369. I-369 has been proposed to be routed south of this interchange to the coastline. This would make I-369 the longest auxiliary route in the US, surpassing Interstate 476.

During her teenage years, she was a professional basketball player and moved to S√£o Paulo to become a member of the women's national basketball team. She studied in Santos, S√£o Paulo, majoring in physical education. Career Her music career began when a close friend and guitar teacher Elodir Barontini invited her to sing at a dinner with Odeon's marketing manager. At the end of this encounter, specially scheduled for her performance, came an offer of a contract to record not one but four albums at once. Her eponymous debut album was recorded in October 1972 at a low cost and with a few musicians, conducted by Jos√© Biamonte. It circulated only among friends, relatives, and artists; ten years later it would be re-edited and with a different cover. On March 20, 1973, Simone was launched for the press in a closed meeting at the Hilton Hotel in S√£o Paulo; later on, she would appear for the first time on a TV program, for TV Bandeirantes. This was followed by an appearance on Mixtura√ß√£o (director/producer Walter Silva, April 1973), a TV Record program where she was one of the promising new talents. Thus, success gradually took place. When she transitioned from sports to stage performance, she was supported by her father, an amateur opera singer, and her mother, a pianist. Early in her musical career, she was invited to participate in an international tour, starting with a presentation at the Olympia in Paris.[ Biography at AllMusic] This tour was organized by Herm√≠nio Bello de Carvalho, a major record producer in Brazil. They performed at Olympia, Madison Square Garden in New York City, Belgium, and Canada with great success, launching two albums, Brasil Export 73 and Festa Brasil. Both were produced by Herm√≠nio Bello, who would also produce the next two albums, Quatro Paredes and Gotas D¬¥√Ågua, the last with Milton Nascimento's production.The repercussion of Gotas d¬¥√°gua Shows and TV festivals By 1977, she reached national recognition in Brazil, notably with Jura Secreta, Face a Face and O Que Ser√°. The last, composed by Chico Buarque, was featured in the soundtrack of the film Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands, by Bruno Barreto, which helped to popularize the music. The same year, she also met Chico Buarque at the studio and said, \\"O Que Ser√° opened doors for me and my career.\\" From June 16 to September 15, 1978, she was among artists of the Projeto Pixinguinha that traveled around the country with upcoming new singers. An excerpt from the Projeto comments on her success: > In 1977, beyond launching 'Face a Face' and the Dona Flor and Her Two > Husbands soundtrack, she was acclaimed in a spectacle at the Museu de Arte > Moderna. At the Teatro Clara Nunes, directed by Herm√≠nio Bello de Carvalho, > she presented \\"Face a Face\\". She is improving her performance in each > spectacle and is featured now among Brazil's best singers. She has just > recorded \\"Cigarra\\", singing Gonzaguinha's \\"Pet√∫nia Resed√°\\" as well as songs > by Fagner and Abel Silva (\\"Sangue e Pudins\\"), Milton Nascimento and Ronaldo > Bastos (\\"Cigarra\\"). A performance in 1977 was also claimed to be one of her best. (Excerpt by Funarte): \\"Along with Belchior, young Simone brought crowds to Jo√£o Caetano theatre for her Seis e Meia performance on August 25, 1977, and was highly acclaimed when singing 'Gota D'√Ågua'; Seis e Meia marked her first national recognition.\\" Two years later, on December 12, 1979, her next LP Peda√ßos was launched at Canec√£o Rio de Janeiro; it was positively received by critics and drew over 120,000 attendees for the album tour. Peda√ßos gave her her first golden disc. The largest album seller of the 1980s According to Revista Veja (Brazil's largest weekly news magazine): \\"Simone Bittencourt de Oliveira was born twice. The first time, in 1949, in a lower-class Salvador area, in Bahia. The second time was last February 7 at the 'Morumbi Stadium', in S√£o Paulo, when she raised a vibrant chorus of 90,000 at the 'Canta Brasil' spectacle, singing 'Caminhando'. When her presentation ended, she was another shining star in the sky.\\" She recorded her career's first golden disc and an eponymous program for Rede Globo, recorded live at the 'Globo Theater' (March 1980). The program, Simone Bittencourt de Oliveira, was the first of a series called Grandes Nomes. Also in 1979, she was present at the Festival de M√∫sica Popular Brasileira, interpreting Para Lennon & McCartney (by M√°rcio and L√¥ Borges and Fernando Brant). In 1982, the same magazine would declare Simone to be the largest album seller of the decade on the cover, with seven pages of coverage. From the 1960s, when the Festival de M√∫sica Popular Brasileira series was launched (Rede Record), until the 1980s, Brazilian television broadcast programs from live music festivals. Mulher 80 (Rede Globo) exhibited a series of interviews and musicals discussing women's role in society with an approach to the national music evolution and the predominance of female voices, including Elis Regina, Maria Beth√¢nia, Faf√° de Bel√©m, Marina Lima, Simone, Rita Lee, Joanna, Zez√© Motta, Gal Costa and Regina Duarte and Narjara Turetta from the Malu Mulher TV series. In an interview given to O Pasquim journal (n¬∫ 572, from June 13 to 19, 1980), Elis Regina said about her: \\"I Like Simone very much. Potentially, there is a talent to bloom out. She is a beautiful woman; her repertoire is very good, and she is very well guided by Fl√°vio Rangel and Nelson Ayres.\\" At the age of 32, she became the first female singer to fill the Maracan√£zinho Stadium. In February 1982, 15,000 to 20,000 people attended Canta Brasil to see her perform music by Milton Nascimento, Ary Barroso, Chico Buarque, Tom Jobim, Fernando Brant, V√≠tor Martins, Paulo C√©sar Pinheiro, Herm√≠nio Bello de Carvalho, Isolda, Sueli Costa and Abel Silva. In December 1983, she drew a crowd of 150,000 people to Quinta da Boa Vista to see a live transmission of Rede Globo for a New Year's TV show. As her career grew, Simone became increasingly involved in political activities. She helped raise funds with Nordeste j√°, a Brazilian version of the American charity efforts We are the World or USA for Africa. The 155 choruses of voices recorded a compact disc with two songs of hers, Chega de M√°goa and Seca D'√Ågua. In May 2006, in a pocket show at Bourbon Street Nightclub in S√£o Paulo, Simone and her band performed for the Credicard Project. Notable recent performances include the ones in Peru, where the audience stood by the stage clapping for more than five minutes straight; and in Miami, along with Ivan Lins. By June 2007, the Coliseum of Santos received an icon of MPB who had once been a resident. Amigo √© Casa, sharing the stage with Z√©lia Duncan, was a show for the recording of an eponymous DVD and aimed to mark the partnership she had with Z√©lia Duncan for the past two years. Repertoire Her repertoire includes some 350 interpretations, one of the largest among Brazilian female singers. The themes of romantic love and passion (Come√ßar de Novo, Jura Secreta, Corpo, Medo de Amar n¬∫2, Raios de luz, and Lenha), samba (O Amanh√£, To Voltando, Disputa de Poder, and Ex-amor), and religious songs (Cantos de Maculel√™, Reis e rainhas do Maracatu, Ent√£o √© Natal, Ave Maria, and Jesus Cristo), are the frequent in her work. During her childhood and teenage years, the main influences on this romantic repertoire were Roberto Carlos, Maysa Matarazzo, Dolores Duran, √Çngela Maria, and Nora Ney‚Äînames of the samba- can√ß√£o or fossa (gloom) genre. Samba-can√ß√£o preceded the bossa nova music style, with which Maysa was associated, and had presented more gentle or soft melodies and interpretations. Maysa's legacy, even with its bossa nova bias, is that of a more dramatic singer and it would be more properly linked to the bolero and samba-can√ß√£o rhythm.Com letras e melodias sofridas, estrelas como Maysa, Dolores Duran e Nora Ney fizeram brilhar o samba-can√ß√£o em sua vers√£o mais sentimental, a m√∫sica de fossa Simone's fondness for boleros results from this musical heritage.CliqueMusic Among her albums recorded after the 1980s, those that stand out include Simone Bittencourt de Oliveira (1995), featuring ballads among other classic and consecrated samba composers; Caf√© com Leite (1996), a tribute to Martinho da Vila; Seda Pura, an incursion into pop (2001) and Baiana da gema, a tribute to Ivan Lins (2004)--works regarded as a reunion of a more refined repertoire and more selective arrangements. Among these is Caf√© com Leite, in which she interprets Martinho da Vila's sambas. Singer and composer Caetano Veloso publicly offered his admiration for this album: > Simone's album of Martinho da Vila's compositions, I find divine, divine and > yet it went unheralded... The press acted as if it was nothing special. It > is divine. His repertoire fits her very well‚Äîthat album is the kind I like > to listen to at home, alone, together with my favourites. She gave clarity > to those compositions, it is beautiful. And it was a project conceived as > the recording of a singer perfectly suited to interpret a composer, I don't > know how it came to be, but it is beautiful, it is a wonderful result. And > she is a great singer, very good, I adore her. A very beautiful voice which > makes one feels good.Jornal da Tarde, June 2006 As an interpreter of others' compositions, Simone has foregrounded Ivan Lins, Vitor Martins, Milton Nascimento, Fernando Brant, Paulo C√©sar Pinheiro, Gonzaguinha, Chico Buarque, Martinho da Vila, F√°tima Guedes, Jo√£o Bosco, Aldir Blanc, Isolda, Roberto Carlos, Herm√≠nio Bello de Carvalho, Paulinho da Viola, Sueli Costa and Abel Silva. Her current repertoire includes Z√©lia Duncan, C√°ssia Eller, Adriana Calcanhotto, Aldir Blanc, Joyce, Martinho da Vila, Paulinho da Viola, and Zeca Pagodinho. \\"Come√ßar de novo\\" The song \\"Come√ßar de novo\\", from her Peda√ßos album (1979), stands out for being the theme song of the TV series Malu Mulher (Rede Globo, 1979), a primetime soap opera that involved controversial issues at that time such as women's liberation, divorce, abortion, and domestic violence. The character Malu (played by Regina Duarte) was the first to take birth-control pills on a TV drama. Simone was chosen to interpret it instead of Maria Beth√¢nia, who also sought that distinction. The composition was written especially for the series by Ivan Lins and V√≠tor Martins. \\"Come√ßar de Novo\\" was also recorded by Barbra Streisand and Sarah Vaughan with English lyrics as \\"The Island\\". Because of this interpretation, the North American producer Quincy Jones cites Simone as \\"one of the world's greatest singers\\".Rede Bandeirantes, Flash Program, 2006 Alongside Jones, Brad Mehldau, compares her to Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington, referring to her \\"strong identity, passion, and grace\\".Folha de S. Paulo, (June 9, 2007) Julio Iglesias has referred to Simone as one of his favourites among Brazilian female singers. Bibliography * Travessia: A vida de Milton Nascimento. Maria Dolores. 2006.

Statement  The Gibbs-Appell equation reads :Q_{r} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial \\\\alpha_{r}}, where \\\\alpha_r=\\\\ddot{q_r} is an arbitrary generalized acceleration, or the second time derivative of the generalized coordinates q_r , and Q_r is its corresponding generalized force. The generalized force gives the work done :dW = \\\\sum_{r=1}^{D} Q_{r} dq_{r}, where the index r runs over the D generalized coordinates q_r , which usually correspond to the degrees of freedom of the system. The function S is defined as the mass-weighted sum of the particle accelerations squared, :S = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{k=1}^{N} m_{k} \\\\mathbf{a}_{k}^{2}\\\\,, where the index k runs over the K particles, and :\\\\mathbf{a}_k = \\\\ddot{\\\\mathbf{r}}_k = \\\\frac{d^2 \\\\mathbf{r}_k}{dt^2} is the acceleration of the k -th particle, the second time derivative of its position vector \\\\mathbf{r}_k . Each \\\\mathbf{r}_k is expressed in terms of generalized coordinates, and \\\\mathbf{a}_k is expressed in terms of the generalized accelerations.  Relations to other formulations of classical mechanics  Appell's formulation does not introduce any new physics to classical mechanics and as such is equivalent to other reformulations of classical mechanics, such as Lagrangian mechanics, and Hamiltonian mechanics. All physics is contained within Newton's laws of motion. In some cases, Appell's equation of motion may be more convenient than the commonly used Lagrangian mechanics, particularly when nonholonomic constraints are involved. In fact, Appell's equation leads directly to Lagrange's equations of motion. Moreover, it can be used to derive Kane's equations, which are particularly suited for describing the motion of complex spacecraft. Appell's formulation is an application of Gauss' principle of least constraint. Derivation The change in the particle positions rk for an infinitesimal change in the D generalized coordinates is : d\\\\mathbf{r}_{k} = \\\\sum_{r=1}^{D} dq_{r} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{r}_{k}}{\\\\partial q_{r}} Taking two derivatives with respect to time yields an equivalent equation for the accelerations : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{a}_{k}}{\\\\partial \\\\alpha_{r}} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{r}_{k}}{\\\\partial q_{r}} The work done by an infinitesimal change dqr in the generalized coordinates is : dW = \\\\sum_{r=1}^{D} Q_{r} dq_{r} = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\\\mathbf{F}_{k} \\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{r}_{k} = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{N} m_{k} \\\\mathbf{a}_{k} \\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{r}_{k} where Newton's second law for the kth particle :\\\\mathbf{F}_k = m_k\\\\mathbf{a}_k has been used. Substituting the formula for drk and swapping the order of the two summations yields the formulae : dW = \\\\sum_{r=1}^{D} Q_{r} dq_{r} = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{N} m_{k} \\\\mathbf{a}_{k} \\\\cdot \\\\sum_{r=1}^{D} dq_{r} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{r}_{k}}{\\\\partial q_{r}} \\\\right) = \\\\sum_{r=1}^{D} dq_{r} \\\\sum_{k=1}^{N} m_{k} \\\\mathbf{a}_{k} \\\\cdot \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{r}_{k}}{\\\\partial q_{r}} \\\\right) Therefore, the generalized forces are : Q_{r} = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{N} m_{k} \\\\mathbf{a}_{k} \\\\cdot \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{r}_{k}}{\\\\partial q_{r}} \\\\right) = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{N} m_{k} \\\\mathbf{a}_{k} \\\\cdot \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{a}_{k}}{\\\\partial \\\\alpha_{r}} \\\\right) This equals the derivative of S with respect to the generalized accelerations : \\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial \\\\alpha_{r}} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\alpha_{r}} \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{k=1}^{N} m_{k} \\\\left\\\\mathbf{a}_{k} \\\\right|^{2} = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{N} m_{k} \\\\mathbf{a}_{k} \\\\cdot \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{a}_{k}}{\\\\partial \\\\alpha_{r}} \\\\right) yielding Appell's equation of motion : \\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial \\\\alpha_{r}} = Q_{r}. Examples Euler's equations of rigid body dynamics Euler's equations provide an excellent illustration of Appell's formulation. Consider a rigid body of N particles joined by rigid rods. The rotation of the body may be described by an angular velocity vector \\\\boldsymbol\\\\omega, and the corresponding angular acceleration vector : \\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha = \\\\frac{d\\\\boldsymbol\\\\omega}{dt} The generalized force for a rotation is the torque \\\\textbf{N}, since the work done for an infinitesimal rotation \\\\delta \\\\boldsymbol\\\\phi is dW = \\\\mathbf{N} \\\\cdot \\\\delta \\\\boldsymbol\\\\phi. The velocity of the k-th particle is given by : \\\\mathbf{v}_{k} = \\\\boldsymbol\\\\omega \\\\times \\\\mathbf{r}_{k} where \\\\mathbf{r}_{k} is the particle's position in Cartesian coordinates; its corresponding acceleration is : \\\\mathbf{a}_{k} = \\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{v}_{k}}{dt} = \\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha \\\\times \\\\mathbf{r}_{k} + \\\\boldsymbol\\\\omega \\\\times \\\\mathbf{v}_{k} Therefore, the function S may be written as : S = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{k=1}^{N} m_{k} \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{a}_{k} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{a}_{k} \\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{k=1}^{N} m_{k} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha \\\\times \\\\mathbf{r}_{k} \\\\right)^{2} \\\\+ \\\\left( \\\\boldsymbol\\\\omega \\\\times \\\\mathbf{v}_{k} \\\\right)^{2} \\\\+ 2 \\\\left( \\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha \\\\times \\\\mathbf{r}_{k} \\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\boldsymbol\\\\omega \\\\times \\\\mathbf{v}_{k}\\\\right) \\\\right\\\\\\\\} Setting the derivative of S with respect to \\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha equal to the torque yields Euler's equations : I_{xx} \\\\alpha_{x} - \\\\left( I_{yy} - I_{zz} \\\\right)\\\\omega_{y} \\\\omega_{z} = N_{x} : I_{yy} \\\\alpha_{y} - \\\\left( I_{zz} - I_{xx} \\\\right)\\\\omega_{z} \\\\omega_{x} = N_{y} : I_{zz} \\\\alpha_{z} - \\\\left( I_{xx} - I_{yy} \\\\right)\\\\omega_{x} \\\\omega_{y} = N_{z} See also * Principle of stationary action * Analytical mechanics References Further reading   Connection of Appell's formulation with the principle of least action. * PDF copy of Appell's article at Goettingen University * PDF copy of a second article on Appell's equations and Gauss's principle Category:Classical mechanics ","title":"Appell's equation of motion"},{"id":"11717904","text":"U.S. Route 80 (also known as U.S. Highway 80 and US 80) is a U.S. highway that begins in the state of Texas in Dallas at an interchange with I-30. US 80 runs in an east-west direction for most of its length from Dallas to Louisiana. Before the advent of the Interstate Highway System, US 80 through Texas was once a vital link in a major transcontinental highway with the national western terminus being in San Diego, California rather than Dallas. Since 1991, most of US 80 in Texas has been decommissioned in favor of I-10, I-20 and I-30 between the New Mexico state line and its current western terminus. History The current route of US 80 in Texas is significantly shorter than it was when the highway was first commissioned in 1927. The highway in Texas used to run from the New Mexico state line, near El Paso, to the Louisiana state line, via Pecos, Odessa, Abilene, Weatherford, Fort Worth, Dallas, Longview and Marshall. Nationally, US 80 ran from Savannah, Georgia to San Diego, California, being a major transcontinental highway. Beginning in the 1950s, much of the highway was bypassed/replaced by the Interstate Highway System. US 80 has been replaced by I-10 from New Mexico to I-20, southwest of Pecos. The rest of the highway has been replaced by I-20 and I-30 from Pecos to Louisiana. Replacement by the Interstates made US 80 an obsolete highway to the southwestern states. Between 1964 and 1989, US 80 was decommissioned entirely within California, Arizona and all of New Mexico outside of Anthony (which is located near the Texas state line). In 1991, the remainder of US 80 in both New Mexico and Texas west of Dallas was decommissioned, bringing the national western terminus to its current location. The old highway west of Dallas has since been replaced by local roads and state highways. Route description Dallas to Terrell The current highway begins as a freeway at I-30 (also unsigned US 67) in Dallas, almost in Mesquite. The freeway continues east into Mesquite where it meets I-635 at a stack interchange. East of I-635, the US 80 freeway serves as the northern terminus of SH 352, the main highway into downtown Mesquite. Bisecting Samuell Park, US 80 enters Sunnyvale, then crosses into Kaufman County. The freeway makes a curve to the southeast, skirting the town of Forney. US 80 is the main highway and only freeway serving the town. Though there is no business loop through Forney proper, FM 688, which runs the entire length of Broad Street through town, serves a similar function. On the outskirts of Terrell, US 80 leaves the freeway and becomes a four lane divided highway known as Moore Avenue, intersecting SH 205 on the western edge of town, then SH 34 Bus. and SH 34 in the center of Terrell. The remainder of the freeway between Terrell and I-20 makes up the full route of Spur 557. The entire US 80/Spur 557 freeway was a section of I-20 until 1987, when the Interstate was moved onto a new freeway through Lawson and Heartland. A pair of frontage roads services the entire US 80 segment of the freeway, except for a small area west of Forney, where US 80 crosses a bridge over the East Fork Trinity River. Terrell to Mineola In Terrell, US 80 serves as the major east-west highway in the town, passing through the town square. US 80 leaves Terrell serving smaller communities, such as Elmo. US 80 intersects SH 19 east of Edgewood. The highway runs in mostly a straight line from Terrell to Mineola, where it intersects US 69 about 30 miles north of Tyler. Mineola to Louisiana US 80 leaves Mineola running in a slight southeast direction towards Longview. From here, the highway turns in a slight northeast direction traveling into Marshall. The highway soon overlaps I-20, leaving the interstate to serve the community of Waskom. The two highways cross into Louisiana, parallel with each other traveling to Shreveport.

U.S. Route 54 (US 54) in Texas is a U.S. Highway that travels through two portions of the state: one in the far western point, and the other in the far northwest Panhandle. Route description US 54 begins in El Paso, Texas, as a controlled access highway at an intersection with Loop 375. The route then travels northward, joining up with I-110 within the first mile. A mile later, these highways intersect Interstate 10 at a complex, three level high expressway interchange which the locals call the \\"Spaghetti Bowl.\\" I-110 ends here, while US 54 continues north through El Paso. The route turns northeast, becoming a rare example of a collector‚Äìexpress freeway in Texas (until the Pershing Drive exit) before entering New Mexico. The route re- enters Texas in the northwest Panhandle, traveling northeast through sparsely populated country. The route intersects US Route 87 and US Route 385 in Dalhart and US Route 287 in Stratford, before exiting into the Oklahoma Panhandle at Texhoma. History The southwestern portion was originally part of the Ozark Trails, paralleling the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad, and was originally given the numbering of State Highway 33. SH 33 continued into Texas farther south in the Panhandle, following the former Ozark Trail. The northern Panhandle portion was originally assigned to State Highway 56, paralleling the Chicago, Rock Island, and Gulf Railroad. When the U.S. Highway System was unveiled in 1926, the northern section was assigned to U.S. Highway 54, while the southwestern portion was assigned to U.S. Highway 366. The US 366 designation was canceled in 1932 when other sections of the highway were added to an adjusted US Route 70. This section was added to US 54 in 1934, and has retained its numbering since. By 1939, the corresponding state highway designations had been canceled. The highway continues on its original routing except for realignment in 1990 in El Paso, with the old route becoming US Business Route 54 and Texas Loop 478. Most of the current US 54 in El Paso is a limited-access highway known as the Patriot Freeway which, as of 2016, was only partially completed.

In the state of Texas it runs from I-345 in Dallas and heads north to the Oklahoma state line. History In the initial assignment of state highways in 1917, Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston were connected by a branch of State Highway 2 (SH 2, the Meridian Highway), which ran via Waco and Bryan and continued on to Galveston. The more direct route followed by US 75 was not initially part of the system between Richland (connected to Dallas by SH 14) and Huntsville (connected to Houston by SH 19). This Richland‚ÄìHuntsville cutoff was added by 1919 as SH 32, and US 75 was assigned to the alignment, as well as SH 6 north of Dallas, in 1926. The branch of SH 2, which US 75 followed between Houston and Galveston, eventually became part of SH 6, and these numbers were dropped in the 1939 renumbering. Prior to the coming of the Interstate Highway System in the late 1950s, the only improvements to US 75 in Texas beyond building a two-lane paved roadway were in the Houston and Dallas areas. However, the highways in and near these cities included some of the first freeways in the state: the Gulf Freeway (Houston, opened to traffic on October 1, 1948) and the Central Expressway (Dallas). When Interstate 45 was built in the 1960s, its alignment bypassed many of the towns and built-up areas between downtown Dallas and Houston. The bypassed routes retained the US 75 designation until the designation was truncated to downtown Dallas in 1987. Many of the original alignments continue to exist under other designations. In Dallas, the route followed what is now the Good Latimer Expressway (formerly Spur 559) southeast, out of downtown, along US 175 and south along State Highway 310. Near Ferris, Trumbull, Palmer, Ennis, and Corsicana Interstate 45 veers east to avoid the more populated areas. The old US 75 alignments through these towns, decommissioned in 1987, now carry the following designations: A 1960s-era sign for US 75 (centre right, in shade) in downtown Dallas.

In Galveston, the alignment of State Highway 87 from 20th Street to the southern terminus Interstate 45 was also part of US 75 until its 1987 truncation.

Plans to upgrade the facility through and north of McKinney are under way with the reconstruction of the US 380 bridge. The highway continues southward into the northern suburbs of Dallas where it intersects the President George Bush Turnpike and I-635. The route reaches its southern terminus on the east side of downtown Dallas, intersecting Spur 366 and ending at unsigned I-345. The exit numbers for US 75 are not based on mile markers; instead, the exits were numbered consecutively (the only remaining stretch of road in Texas with such a system). As the bypass route was completed around the Sherman‚ÄìDenison area, the numbering system was continued for the new exits. Upon completion of the widened Central Expressway through Dallas, the exit numbering was changed for the section south of I-635 to correspond with the new (and fewer number of) exits, based on mileage, but the numbering system north of I-635 was left unchanged, thus explaining the gap in the current numbering system.

Route description US 81 begins at an interchange with I-35W/US 287 in northern Fort Worth. The two highways travel northwest as a freeway, passing by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing near Blue Mound Road (Farm to Market Road 156, FM 156), through the city's northwest side. US 81/US 287 leaves the city of Fort Worth and enters Wise County near Avondale. The highway runs through or near the towns of Rhome, New Fairview, Decatur, Alvord, and Sunset before separating in southern Bowie. US 81 runs through the town as Wise Street, running in a more east‚Äìwest direction before turning in a more north‚Äìsouth direction at FM 174\\\\. The highway has a mostly rural route, running through western Montague County, before crossing the Red River into Oklahoma. History US 81 at its inception in 1926 followed the route of State Highway 2 (SH 2), which began in Laredo and passed through San Antonio, Austin, Waco, and Fort Worth before passing over the Red River into Oklahoma north of Ringgold. The 1936 Official Map of the Highway System of Texas clearly shows the route labeled both as US 81 and SH 2\\\\. It was cosigned with US 83 for from Laredo to south of Webb, with US 79 for from Austin north to Round Rock, and with US 77 for from Waco to Hillsboro. In 1940 US 287 was extended south into Texas, and a stretch from Fort Worth northwest to Bowie was cosigned with US 81. The summer 1941 Texas Highway Map shows this pairing, and the current southern terminus of US 81 is still cosigned with US 287\\\\. The spring and summer 1949 Texas Highway Department Official Map designates the length of US 81 from Laredo to Fort Worth as part of the National System of Interstate Highways, but no numeric designation was given at the time. It was not until 1959 that parts of US 81 in Texas appeared on the Texas Official Highway Travel Map cosigned with I-35 shields. Succeeding maps reflect the slow completion of I-35 and I-35W over the stretch of US 81 between Laredo and Fort Worth, with the 1978-79 Texas Official Highway Travel Map showing only a section from Encinal north to south of Artesia Wells as incomplete, and the 1980 Texas Official Highway Travel Map shows that section completed. In 1980, US 81 was cosigned with I-35 and I-35W except where the Interstate bypassed towns; US 81 provided the main route through town and then reconnected with I-35 on the other side. The longest section of US 81 in 1980 not cosigned with the Interstate ran from I-35 in Hillsboro north to I-35W, just north of Grandview. This section of US 81 became SH 81 in 1991 when most of US 81 in Texas was decommissioned. The section of highway from Devine to Lytle became SH 132 and the section from Derby to the Pearsall town square became Spur 581 when US 81 south of Fort Worth was decommissioned in 1991.

Route description US 85 begins at the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border between El Paso and Ciudad Ju√°rez at the Paso del Norte International Bridge for northbound traffic and the Good Neighbor International Bridge for southbound traffic. The international bridges overpass without directly intersecting Loop 375\\\\. The highway follows S. El Paso St. northbound and S. Stanton St. southbound to Paisano Dr.. The route is concurrent with US 62 from the border to Paisano Dr. where US 85 turns west while US 62 turns east. One block west of S. El Paso St., US 85 intersects S. Santa Fe St. which connects to Loop 375. The route follows Paisano Drive closely following the Rio Grande and the tracks of the Union Pacific Railroad and the BNSF Railway west of I-10, the campus of the University of Texas at El Paso, and the former Asarco smelter site. From there, the route continued on Paisano Drive until merging with the combined route of I-10 and US 180: however, in June 2016, due to construction of what will become the Border West Expressway, the route of US 85 was detoured onto SH 20 and local streets. After rejoining I-10 and US 180, US 85 remains concurrent with them for the remainder of its length in Texas in greater El Paso's west side and upper valley regions. US 85 intersects SH 20 at Mesa St. At Artcraft Rd., the route intersects SH 178 which, together with New Mexico State Road 136, connects the route to the Santa Teresa, New Mexico, international port of entry. The route then intersects Loop 375 connecting the highway to the town of Canutillo and El Paso's northeast side where Fort Bliss is located. The highway then leaves El Paso and intersects Spur 37 in Vinton just west of Westway. In Anthony, the route intersects FM 1905 before crossing the state line into New Mexico. History US 85 was one of the original U.S. Numbered Highways established by the American Association of State Highway Officials. The first AASHO route log, published in 1927, did not place US 85 in Texas but instead as terminating in Las Cruces, New Mexico. AASHO extended the route south to El Paso in 1946. The original alignment of US 85 in Texas was entirely concurrent with the former route of US 80 beginning at Texas Ave. and following Mesa St. and then Doniphan Dr. to the New Mexico state line along the current SH 20. US 85 was relocated to its current alignment in 1974, partially following the former routing of U.S. Route 80 (Alt.) after the completion of I-10 in El Paso. The current local TxDOT map shows US 85 terminating on Paisano Dr. at US 62 at S. El Paso St. with no concurrent along US 62 to the border. However, the present route log of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, as AASHO is now known, shows US 85 joining US 62 to the border.

The water is propelled by ordinary air (atmosphere), pressurized in the extinguisher. They are also known by the slang term water can. Although only effective on Class A fires, they have the advantages of being inexpensive to build and maintain, and leaving no special chemical residue when used.  Construction  A standard APW extinguisher in the United States contains of water in a stainless steel tank. The water is discharged by means of a hose, with a smooth-bore nozzle attached to the tip. They will initially produce a stream of water, with a discharge time of about 50 seconds. APW extinguishers are easily refilled by unscrewing the top and filling the cylinder with water about three-quarters of the way up. The top is then screwed back on, and the unit is pressurized with an air compressor via the Schrader valve located on the back of the main valve body.  Conversion to foam  APW extinguishers are commonly converted into makeshift CAFS extinguishers by drilling two holes in the pickup tube. The unit is then filled with of water and Class A foam, AFFF, FFFP or commercial detergent is added to the water in a 1% ratio for class A fires and a 3‚Äì6% ratio for Class B fires. Typically, the tip of the smooth-bore application nozzle is then cut off to allow the foam to properly expand. Keeping the nozzle will result in wetter foam and longer range. Cutting the nozzle will result in an expanded, dry foam but will lack the range of the standard water nozzle. Water extinguishers can also be fitted with air aspirators when used with foam (commonly used on AFFF and FFFP foam extinguishers) which will result in a more expanded foam but will lack the durability or heat resistance of compressed air foam.

He served as Prefect of the Congregation for Religious from 1963 to 1973, and was elevated to the cardinalate by Pope John XXIII in 1962. Early life and education Antoniutti was born in Nimis, the sixth of the seven children of Giuseppe and Anna (n√©e Comelli) Antoniutti. Studying at the seminaries in Cividale and Udine, he accompanied Archbishop Antonio Anastasio Rossi of Udine during World War I on Rossi's frequent visits to military hospitals and to parishes in areas occupied by Austro-Hungarian forces. In November 1917 Antoniutti went to Rome, where he studied at the Pontifical Roman Seminary and Pontifical Lateran University (from where he obtained his doctorates in philosophy, theology, and canon law in July 1920). Ordained ministry He was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Rossi on 5 December 1920, and then taught at the Udine seminary from 1921 to 1927, whilst serving as Rossi's private secretary. In 1927 Antoniutti was named secretary of the apostolic delegation to China, under Archbishop Celso Costantini, becoming its auditor in 1930 and later charg√© d'affaires ad interim in 1933. He was raised to the rank of Privy Chamberlain of His Holiness on 24 September 1931, and named auditor to the Portuguese nunciature in 1934. Episcopal ministry On 19 May 1936, Antoniutti was appointed Apostolic Delegate to Albania and Titular Archbishop of Synnada in Phrygia by Pope Pius XI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 29 June from Cardinal Pietro Fumasoni Biondi, with Archbishops Rossi (who by then was Latin Patriarch of Constantinople) and Costantini serving as co-consecrators, in Rome. Remaining as Albania's apostolic delegate until August 1936, Antoniutti served as a papal envoy to Spain during its civil war on 25 July 1937, for the purposes of exchanging of prisoners and providing assistance to priests who had fled from Communist areas. He was named, on the following 21 September charg√© d'affaires to the Nationalist government. Antoniutti later became Apostolic Delegate to Canada on 14 July 1938. During his time in Ottawa, he described Maclean's editor Blair Fraser, the father of Graham Fraser, as \\"badly informed\\" after he accused conservative clergy of keeping the Church in Canada too old-fashioned in its social principles in an article that the Apostolic Delegate called \\"evidently tendentious\\".TIME Magazine.

Sebastiano alle Catacombe by Pope John XXIII in the consistory of 19 March 1962. From 1962 to 1965, he attended the Second Vatican Council, during the course of which he was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 1963 papal conclave that elected Pope Paul VI. On 26 July 1963, the newly elected Pope Paul appointed Antoniutti to the Roman Curia, as Prefect of the Congregation for Religious. Cardinal Antoniutti later resigned as Prefect of Religious, after a decade of service, upon becoming Cardinal-Bishop of Velletri-Segni on 13 September 1973. He was named Camerlengo of the College of Cardinals the next year. Death Seeking a period of rest in his native Nimis, Antoniutti departed from Rome on 1 August 1974, and was instantly killed when his car hit another vehicle on a bypass of Bologna. His body was moved to Nimis two days later, which would have been his seventy-sixth birthday, for a funeral Mass, which was celebrated by Cardinals Ermenegildo Florit and Albino Luciani, and nine other bishops. Antoniutti is buried at the parish church in Nimis.

History The cinema had been operating since 1984, showing world cinema, and independent and Irish films. The Screen Cinema, originally named The New Metropole, opened on 16 March 1972 on the corner of Hawkins Street and Townsend Street on the site of the previous cinema, The Regal, which had been demolished since 1962 to make way for offices. The New Metropole name derived from the more famous Metropole Cinema on O'Connell Street (Penney's department store now occupies the building), and after the latter closed in 1973, the New Metropole became the Metropole. Originally a single screen cinema, the auditorium was subdivided in 1982 to create two additional auditoria. The new screens were suspended from the ceiling, meaning the main screen was not reduced. In 1984, it was renamed the Screen Cinema, which became the sister cinema to the more well known Savoy Cinema on O'Connell Street. After this, the Screen showed more unusual, independent, and foreign language films rather than mainstream Hollywood films, which attracted a cult audience to the cinema. The Screen received a face-lift between 2004‚Äì2005 when the interior was upgraded and the cinema lost its original marquee and neon sign in favour of an electronic board displaying the programme.The History of Dublin Cinemas, Marc Zimmerman. Despite its unusual layout, the cinema has maintained a steady flow of cinema-goers, and thrives on art house films, usually keeping the most successful releases running until just before DVD release. The Screen has hosted the Jameson Dublin International Film Festival since its inception in 2002, and in 2007 alone, 48 films were screened over the six days the venue was in use. Celebrity festival visitors have included Wim Wenders, Julie Walters, John Boorman, and Eduardo Noriega. In the summer of 2009, the Screen showed a season of classic films which included All About Eve, Casablanca, The Apartment, Brief Encounter, Guys and Dolls, and The Great Escape. Hallowe'en's \\"Scream Cinema Monster Mash\\" offered audiences Ghost, Child's Play, The Shining, Evil Dead II, The Thing, Night of the Living Dead, and the surprise film, The Mist, in black and white. The latest series of classics shown was the \\"Ministry of Musicals\\" which featured the best Hollywood musicals and contemporary classics. The programme of films screened included Oklahoma, Singin' in the Rain, An American in Paris, Meet Me in St. Louis, The Last Waltz, Labyrinth, This is Spinal Tap, and Cry-Baby. It was reported in February 2012 that the George's Quay Local Area Plan, prepared by Dublin City Council to regenerate Dublin's southeast inner city, indicated that the Screen Cinema could be demolished and later re-housed in replacement property development in the Hawkins Street area.Dublin 'midtown' plans include 22-storey tower Irish Times, 8 February 2012.

It is built on a sandstone spur overlooking the western bank of the River Mole in Surrey in England. The ruin is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and is in the lowest category of listed architecture, Grade II, due east of Dorking railway station in Dorking and due west of Reigate. Although close to the river and edge of the course it is surrounded by \\"Betchworth Park\\" Golf Course named after the village east. In 1798, Henry Peters bought Betchworth Castle and spent considerable money renovating it to be a comfortable family home. Henry lived at Betchworth Castle with his wife, Charlotte Mary Morrison, and his twelve children until his death in 1827. After Henry‚Äôs death, Betchworth Castle was not inherited by his children and therefore was bought by David Barclay and later by Henry Hope, who demolished large parts of the castle and left it in ruin, as is seen today. History Medieval period Betchworth (or Beechworth among other forms) Castle was the seat of the manor of West Betchworth and was held by Richard de Tonbridge at the time of the Domesday Survey. It started as an earthwork fortress built by Robert Fitz Gilbert in the 11th century. It was granted in 1373 to Richard FitzAlan, 3rd or 10th Earl of Arundel. His son Sir John FitzAlan, Earl Marshall of England, turned it into a stone castle in 1379. It passed by marriage to Sir Thomas Browne, Sheriff of Kent, who in 1448 rebuilt it as a fortified house. Browne landowners Sir Thomas Brown(e) was also Treasurer of the Household to King Henry IV. Post-Restoration of monarchy and the enlightenment The last male Browne to own Betchworth Castle was Sir Adam Browne, 2nd Baronet, who died in 1690.History of St Michael's Church of Betchworth History of DorkingExploring Surrey's Past Alterations were later made in 1705 using an unknown architect, and in 1799 by Sir John Soane, architect.Grade II listing Adam Browne's daughter and sole heir, Margaret, married William Fenwicke in 1691.

St Martin's church, Dorking has plaque to Abraham Tucker, author of A Picture of Artless Love and The Light of Nature Pursued, who lived at his estate of Betchworth Castle until his death in 1774. In the 19th century, people saw little practical use for castles, and this one was outshone by a newer, bigger house in the larger grounds so soon abandoned, in the 1830s. The castle was bought by banking dynasty co-heir Henry Thomas Hope to add to his Deepdene estate in 1834, who demolished part of it to reuse the building material elsewhere. Without a permanent tenant, the remainder gradually fell into ruin, and became treated as a folly. The historian and topographer Malden, in 1911 wrote: Hauntings The castle is said to be haunted by a black dog (death dog) that prowls the ruins at night. The grounds of the castle (now Betchworth Park golf course) are also said to be haunted. Supposedly, a \\"Lord Hope\\" (either a mistaken reference to Henry Thomas Hope or possibly his grandson Francis Pelham-Clinton-Hope, 8th Duke of Newcastle), chased and killed an escaped convict with his sword, only to find out that it was in fact his own son he had killed. \\"Lord Hope\\" is said to now walk around the ruins in regret. Use A route of public access (by foot) to the site was created in 2005 along a signposted track across the golf course. The entire ruin is currently surrounded by sturdy railings for safety reasons as there are unstable subterranean cellars. Visitors can get relatively close to the ruins, by studying it through its protective railings. There is no access via Castle Gardens, or the river Mole.

The machine was equipped with specially designed impact-resistant crew and passenger seats and high-strength pneumatic shock absorbers on its fixed tricycle landing gear, in keeping with the Army's requirement that the ACAP aircraft meet or exceed all existing military crashworthiness standards. The aircraft was flown by two pilots, and could carry up to six passengers in the rear cabin. Operational history The S-75 underwent a 50-hour evaluation by the Army, and was found to have exceeded the weight- and cost-saving criteria set in the original ACAP specification. Sikorsky gained a wealth of data on the fabrication and use of composite airframes through building the S-75, and Sikorsky's later designs incorporated many of its features. Testing of the machine continued through April 1985, after which it was withdrawn from service and placed in long-term storage.

He was the first citizen of the United States to reside in Iran, and he became known for his work among the people there as an \\"apostle to Persia\\". Biography He was born in the Ireland Parish of West Springfield, Massachusetts, in an area now within the city of Holyoke, Massachusetts. He was the son of William Perkins and Judith Clough Perkins, and a descendant of a John Perkins who arrived in Massachusetts in 1631 and eventually settled in Ipswich, Massachusetts in 1633. He spent his early years on the farm. At the age of eighteen, he had a religious experience and enrolled at the Westfield Academy, going on to graduate with honors from Amherst College in 1829.Justin Perkins (AC 1829) Papers, ca. 1830-1869 Finding Aid He then spent a year teaching at the Amherst Academy, two years studying at the Andover Theological Seminary, and one year as a tutor at Amherst College, before being ordained a Presbyterian minister in the summer of 1833. At roughly the same time, on July 21, 1833, he married Charlotte Bass of Middlebury, Vermont, with whom he would eventually have seven children. Six of those children would die in Persia, including their daughter Judith, about whom Justin Perkins wrote the book \\"The Persian Flower: a memoir of Judith Grant Perkins of Oroomiah, Persia\\".. See The Persian flower: a memoir of Judith Grant Perkins of Oroomiah, Persia (1871); online text. Only one child, Henry Martyn Perkins, survived Persia and moved with his parents to America. In Persia In September, 1833, he set sail for Persia as a missionary for the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, his specific appointment being for the remaining members of the Assyrian Church of the East in northwestern Persia. He found that the people he was to serve were living lives of poverty and ignorance, functioning as virtual serfs to their Muslim rulers. To address these matters, he established a missionary center in Urmia in 1835, with himself, Asahel Grant (an American physician), and their respective wives Charlotte and Judith (n√©e Campbell).PDF, p. 106. PDF Perkins was taught by Qasha Auraham and Mar Yohannan, the latter the Assyrian Church of the East bishop of Urmia.PDF Mar Yohannan visited the US with Perkins in 1843. Perkins' mission there would continue for 35 years. He then began preaching, generally with the full consent of the local Assyrian church clergy, and often in their churches. He also established a boys' school there, which was the first school to use the learning by teaching method in central Asia. He shortly followed this with several other schools for boys and girls in the surrounding villages, and, later, at the express request of the Muslim government, established similar schools for the Muslim population. He was also the first to reduce to writing the vernacular of the locals, the modern Syriac language. Thereafter, he produced several volumes in that language for the edification of the people. He established a printing press at Urmia, and used it to produce several works, eighty of which Perkins himself either translated or wrote. These included a magazine Rays of Light, which was devoted to \\"Religion, Education, Science, Missions, Juvenile Matters, Miscellany and Poetry\\", and which would continue to be produced until his death. He translated portions of the Christian Bible which appeared at various times. Primary among these were a translation of the New Testament which appeared in 1846, of the Old Testament in 1852, and a referenced version of the Old Testament in 1858. The first two of these contained the text in ancient and modern Syriac in parallel columns. His other works included books for regular and Sunday schools, hymnbooks, and translation of religious works by the likes of Isaac Watts, John Bunyan, Philip Doddridge, and Richard Baxter. He was widely recognized at the time as a scholar of the Syriac language. The high esteem in which he was held by both the Muslim and Christian populations made it possible for him to acquire various older documents which have been very valuable to scholars over the years. Legacy Perkins' presence set the tone for the American presence in Iran during the second half of the 19th century when the missionary-led American presence took responsibility for a broad network of primary and secondary schools in northwest Iran that served to bring literacy among the indigenous Christian Aramaic speakers - members of the Assyrian Church of the East. Following his example, Americans concentrated on improvements in education, book and periodicals publishing, and especially in establishing the first medical college in Iran (1879). The Americans may also be credited with creating the opportunity to put into writing the vernacular Assyrian neo- Aramaic of the Christians of northwest Iran and producing the first periodical in all of Iran (1849), produced in the language at the American Mission press in Urmia. Perkins was not only a trained missionary, but he was also an ethnically aware watercolorist whose drawings of men, women and children belonging to the various ethnic groups of northwest Iran survive in his books as well as in unpublished drawings. These provide a colorful presentation of ethnic costumes, colors and fabrics available to local populations during the mid-19th century. Perkins and other missionaries in the active Protestant mission in Urmia were probably among the first to present lectures about Iran in the United States as well as being the first Americans with whom the general Persian population had contact. While not officially a diplomat, Perkins, and later missionaries acted much as did provincial consular officers at later times. He described his experiences in A Residence of Eight Years in Persia among the Nestorian Christians with Notices of the Muhammedans (1841), and Missionary Life in Persia (1861).

He was involved in politics in the 1940s, and again after the 1958 restoration of democracy, but retired from politics in 1964 until the early 1990s, pursuing a career in business. He was then an early supporter of Hugo Ch√°vez' post-1992 political career, and was the Venezuelan Minister of Interior and Justice from 2001 to 2002, when he resigned.AP, 25 January 2002, Venezuela's Chavez replaces interior minister in cabinet shuffle; criticizes remarks by Vatican diplomat First political career Miquilena began his political career with the Venezuelan Communist Party (PCV) in the 1940s as Secretary General of the Union of Bus Drivers (Spanish: Sindicato de Autobuseros), allied with President Isa√≠as Medina Angarita. He remained with the PCV for the next four years. Later, he became a firm opponent of president R√≥mulo Betancourt (first presidency 1945-1948). In 1945, he broke with the PCV over their support of Betancourt and formed his own political party, the Revolutionary Party of the Proletariat (PRP). The PRP was short-lived, lasting from the overthrow of the Gallegos government (in office February 1948-November 1948) until the rise of Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez. Miquilena opposed P√©rez's government as well and as a result was jailed for much of the dictatorship and was initially tortured at a jail in Caracas. He was later transferred to a jail in Ciudad Bolivar, Miquilena became friends with Democratic Action politician Sim√≥n Alberto Consalvi, stating that \\"Simon was a man that I think men should be\\". While imprisoned, family members would communicate cryptically by marking points on letters of books delivered to prisoners, informing Miquilena of the condition of Venezuela outside of prison. His time in prison helped him decide his views on politics. Jim√©nez was overthrown in 1958, and in an attempt to stabilize the fledgling democracy that succeeded the dictatorship, three Venezuelan political parties entered into the Pacto de Punto Fijo. In 1959, Miquilena became the owner and director of the newspaper El Clar√≠n. Over time, he progressively became a strong opponent of the government of R√≥mulo Betancourt (second presidency 1959-1964) over its opposition to the Cuban government under Fidel Castro and its alleged repression of leftwing political groups. However, Miquilena never agreed with guerrillas, calling them a \\"respectable mistake\\", saying \\"A 20 year old who decides to risk his life deserves respect. That's what made me a defender of the people who were fighting the battle against the armed forces, even though in privacy I was a fierce enemy of the guerrilla. It was a mistake that cost us a lot. If we channeled the democratic struggle from the beginning, with all the strength we had, through a rational and institutional way, who knows if the story would be different.\\" In 1961, Miquilena joined the Democratic Republican Union (URD) party and he became a Representative for the state of Falc√≥n in the Venezuelan Chamber of Deputies. In 1964, he left the staff of El Clar√≠n, quit the URD, and retired from political life. For the next 30 years, he dedicated himself to business, becoming a landowner and industrialist. He approved of the Pacto de Punto Fijo believing that Venezuela had a \\"history of coups and militarism\\" and that this was a good attempt to solve that problem, though the failure of this system led to Ch√°vez coming to party, which he thought was worse. Second political career In the 1990s, he met Hugo Ch√°vez and returned to the political arena as one of the founders of the Fifth Republic Movement (MVR). He initially heard about Ch√°vez owing to Ch√°vez's February 1992 coup attempt, and visited him in jail.Jones (2008:167) During the first years of the Ch√°vez administration, Miquilena held important government posts: president of the Constituent Assembly (which drafted the 1999 Constitution of Venezuela), president of the National Legislative Commission, Senator (term began 1999), and Minister of Justice and the Interior (February 2001BBC, 4 February 2001, Venezuelan cabinet reshuffle \\\\- January 2002Orlando Sentinel, 25 January 2002, Chavez kicks out mentor). In the latter post, he launched the Citizen Security Plan and promoted the Peaceful Prison Disarmament Plan.El Universal (Caracas), 1 Feb 2008 Retirement Disagreements with measures taken by president Ch√°vez led to a https://theconversation.com/venezuela-what-chavezs-mentor-told-me-about-the- countrys-castro-inspired-road-to-ruin-80249 political break. In the months before the coup against Ch√°vez in April 2002, Miquilena talked with Fidel Castro and the two agreed that they did not want Venezuela to take the same path as Cuba. Ch√°vez also convinced Miquilena that he was not going to follow a Cuban model, but later took back his word. When Miquilena realized that Ch√°vez was taking a similar path as the Cuban government and Ch√°vez was centralizing power around himself, he decided to retire. He met with Castro and Ch√°vez on Margarita Island, looking to Castro for assistance with Ch√°vez, however \\"Fidel had discovered the immense vanity of Chavez, and took advantage of it to get the slice of the century. Thereafter he devoted himself, in a roguish way, to take advantage of Ch√°vez, regardless of what happened in Venezuela\\". In an interview a month after the failed coup against Ch√°vez in April 2002, Miquilena rejected the view that the people had restored Ch√°vez to power. Miquilena declared that it was the incompetence of one of the coup leaders, Pedro Carmona, who had served as president for 36 hours, which restored Ch√°vez to power \\"by his decree to dissolve the Assembly and by ousting all mayors\\".El Mundo (Madrid), 12 May 2002 In 2007, Miquilena voiced his disagreement with the proposal for constitutional reform. Later life and death In 2013 after Venezuela suffered the effects of Ch√°vez's presidency, Miquilena was interviewed by the Venezuelan news website Runrunes. He stated that he did not feel guilty about helping Ch√°vez gain power but stated that he felt \\"very sorry\\" for not being able to fight against the effects of Ch√°vez during the end of his life. When asked how he would fight back against the Bolivarian government, he said that he would be \\"in the front line, uniting and gathering people to face the disaster we are suffering\\" and that \\"the popular struggle is not armed. It is the struggle of the people on the street. In every line of people to buy flour bread and toilet paper should be someone shaking up the people\\". Three years later, Miquilena died in Caracas on November 24, 2016 and the interview, one of his last, was released to the public. Popular culture Miguel Otero Silva made him the central character of La Muerte de Honorio, a novel about the anti-Jim√©nez resistance movement.Jones, Bart (2008), Hugo!

Its original Italian title translates into \\"Like you, nobody, never\\" Plot The movie is a tale about a young boy aroused by the sexual awakenings and the political views of the Italian youth. It's set around a group of friends. Silvio (the main character), Ponzi (his best friend) and a group of boys and girls that go to the same school. When the school is threatened with privatization, the students gather to decide whether to occupy the school or take a different action. The most radical kids end up setting the tone of the oncoming protest; the school is going to be occupied. In the night the friends gather, girls in one place and boys in another. They smoke and share experiences. Martino tells the boys that he's had sex with his girlfriend, and that he can last about ten minutes. On the other hand, as the girls chat, his girlfriend tells her friends that it was all very fast. The next morning, as Ponzi comes to pick up Silvio at his place, he tells him that the school has been shut down and they're going to invade and occupy. When they reach the school, Silvio is one of the lads that gets to a backdoor. They rush in and let the rest of the crowd in. The school is taken, Silvio is exploring the grounds along with Martino's girl (who, we learn, is a long lost love interest of his). They break into the archives and Silvio tells her that Martino is bragging about having sex with her. She gets mad about it and they make out. Silvio is thrilled and ends up telling Ponzi all about it on his way out (he was going home to get his sleeping bag, get back and sleep over at the school, hoping to get more intimate with the girl). Ponzi couldn't keep the secret and so the rumour is out. And the story builds up as it gets to Martino's ear. He gets furious and decides to get things right with Silvio and his girlfriend. The rumours of the archive kisses reach the girl's ear, now she thinks Silvio is just another boy. At home, Silvio gets into an argument with his father and ends up not making it to the school. We see a rather disturbed relationship of everyday conflicts and discussions, built up emotions and generational conflicts, with the parents trying to tell their stories differently than the ones happening right now. Silvio escapes and at the school there's confrontation against the fascists. As he chases a fascist down the street with a stick, his father stops him and take him home. Another argument at the dinner table ensues. At the school the kids are chilling, smoking dope and getting closer to each other. Movies are being shown of old protests. Communist flags and revolutionary symbols are all around. At this point, Claudia begins to step up as a major character. She is talking to a friend, telling her that's it's been six months since she realized that she was in love with Silvio. The friend encourages her to call and tell him how she feels, she fights it for a while but calls him nonetheless. As she calls, Silvio starts to talk about his feelings for the other girl. Claudia hangs up at first. He calls back thinking the line was down. She invites him out the next day, tells him that they should hang out to talk. Martino has been at the school and learned all about the betrayal. He now rushes to the house of Silvio. As he gets there he rings and Silvio comes down, he punches him and storms away. The next day, Ponzi calls Silvio and tells him that he has slept over at the school. Silvio goes out to the school. The police arrive at the scene of the occupation. The kids decide to resist. As the police come to storm the gates, the students throw eggs at them. The riot squad beats up a few kids. Some escape, but most of them get arrested: the jealousy-fueled Martino, the most exalted kids, Ponzi and most of the minor characters. Amongst the ones that got away we find Silvio and Claudia. As they talk, Claudia tells him that she has loved him for a long time. He doesn't say anything special in reply. Claudia drops him at home. When she gets home she goes to bed sad. Meanwhile all the kids are at the police department, even the toughest kids have to call their dads. Silvio is confused about his friend. He consults his heartbroken brother and he tells him that he should only enjoy the girl but shouldn't fall in love with her. When he goes to Claudia's place, Claudia's mother wakes her up and she gets up confused. She welcomes him and he tells her that they should be together. She closes the door to her room and they kiss. Her mother knocks on the door and tells them that they shouldn't be in locked doors. Claudia takes him up to the rooftop, there they kiss and she asks him if he wants to make love right there. He says yes and things just happen. After they are done, Silvio rushes to Ponzi's house to tell him that he is no longer a virgin. Ponzi swears not to tell anyone this time. When Silvio tells Ponzi about his brother's advice Ponzi says that his brother doesn't know anything. They talk as they walk away and the movie ends.

History In the middle ages, Heinenoord and its surroundings were known as \\"het Land van Wale\\". After the St. Elizabeth's flood (1421), Heinenoord was engulfed by the water. It recovered around 1437, when the land was reclaimed. Around that time the village of Heynkensort was founded.

It was formerly known as Tria Hania (, , both mean \\"three inns\\"). The village itself was built on the crossroads of the road between Kilkis and Athens and thus saw a lot of traffic, hence the name. It was situated in the swamps near the lake of Giannitsa. It was abandoned during the Turkish rule of Macedonia, most likely in lieu of a better position, away from the swamps. Today the village is abandoned. The new village was named Neochorouda (ŒùŒµŒøœáœâœÅŒøœçŒ¥Œ±), which literally means ‚Äúnew village‚Äù. Neochorouda is situated north-west of Thessaloniki, on the southern slopes of Mount Kardakli (ŒöŒ±œÅŒ¥Œ±Œ∫ŒªŒØ). It is disputed whether Neochorouda pre-existed Tria Hania, or not, but it is clear today that the inhabitants of Tria Hania do, in fact, to this day reside in Neochorouda. History of the area During the Macedonian struggle the area was a hotbed for partisan activity as Greek, Bulgarian and other nationality paramilitaries as well as Ottoman soldiers waged a covert war for the allegiance of the native populations either ‚Äúconverting‚Äù people to their national identity, or exterminating them as the supporters of others.

It runs for 26.0 miles (42 km) north-south through Rogers County. It has no lettered spur routes. SH-88 dates back to 1940 or early 1941. Route description SH-88 begins in Inola and heads northwest out of town, paralleling a Union Pacific rail line. It has an interchange with an old alignment of SH-33, followed by an interchange with SH-33's successor, U.S. Highway 412. From US-412, the route continues northwest, crossing over Inola Creek near its source. Approximately one mile later, the highway passes near the McFarlin railroad siding. Further northwest, the highway passes through unincorporated Tiawah. It then crosses the Tiawah Hills and Panther Creek. The highway then passes under Interstate 44, the Will Rogers Turnpike, though no interchange exists. It then enters the town of Claremore. In Claremore, SH-88 has a brief concurrency with both SH-66 and SH-20. After emerging from the west side of town, the highway turns onto a due north course, which it continues along until it reaches Lake Oologah. It then turns west, running along the south shore of the lake. Upon reaching the lake's southwest corner, it crosses the dam. The highway turns back to the north, running west of the lake, before turning back west toward Oologah. It then ends at US-169 in Oologah. History State Highway 88 is first shown on the April 1941 state highway map, implying it was commissioned sometime between then and April 1940, when the previous map was published. SH-88 had an entirely gravel surface at that time. The 1948 map is the first that shows SH-88 with a wholly paved driving surface. Prior to the construction of the Lake Oologah Dam, Highway 88 proceeded on a more southerly course north of Claremore, crossing the Verdigris River downstream of the current dam location and ending at US-169 south of Oologah. The 1965 map is the first to show the route crossing Oologah Dam. The route has had no further major changes since then.

The narrative of Cugel's Saga continues from the point at which it left off at the end of The Eyes of the Overworld (1966). The Internet Speculative Fiction Database calls Cugel's Saga \\"[t]wice as large and less episodic than Eyes of the Overworld\\", and catalogs it as a novel rather than a fix-up, but also qualifies that label. \\"This is marketed as a novel, but there is a table of contents, and some of the parts were previously published (although none are acknowledged thus).\\" Retrieved 2012-05-09. Plot summary The story begins on Shanglestone Strand, a desolate beach far to the north of Almery, where Cugel had been dumped at the end of The Eyes of the Overworld by a winged demon after he mispronounced the spell intended to inflict the same fate on his nemesis, Iucounu the Laughing Magician. Avoiding the village of Smolod, the scene of his first adventure in The Eyes of the Overworld and where \\"memories are long\\", Cugel heads down Shanglestone Strand and arrives at Flutic, a manse owned by the avaricious Master Twango, whose business is salvaging the scales of an Overworld entity named Sadlark from a miry pit in his back garden. The scales are sold to the firm of Soldinck and Mercantides, who trans-ship them to a customer in Almery. Taking employment at Flutic, through sheer luck Cugel obtains the Pectoral Skybreak Spatterlight, the most valuable of all the scales, as it constitutes Sadlark's central node of force, or \\"protonastic centrum\\". The Skybreak Spatterlight, which absorbs every living creature with which it comes into contact, imprisoning them in limbo, is central to the plot of the novel since it is coveted by none other than Iucounu, the mysterious final customer for the scales, who believes himself to be Sadlark's avatar and is trying to reconstruct the Overworld entity scale by scale. (Chapter I.1) After defrauding Twango of a substantial sum, only to be double-crossed by Yelleg and Malser, Twango's \\"scale divers\\", Cugel absconds from Flutic, still in possession of the Skybreak Spatterlight. At the nearby port of Saskervoy he takes employment as a lowly worminger (a crew member responsible for the maintenance of huge marine worms) aboard the worm-propelled Galante, a merchant ship owned by Soldinck and Mercantides, hoping to reach Almery by sea. On the island of Lausicaa, where he is to be replaced by a more competent worminger and thus remain stranded, Cugel hijacks the Galante, kidnapping Soldinck's wife and three comely daughters. Madame Soldinck, to whom Cugel naively entrusts the duties of night helmsman, outwits her captor by turning the ship in the opposite direction every night while Cugel is asleep after dallying with her daughters. To evade retribution at the hands of Master Soldinck, who is pursuing the Galante in a lubberly cog, Cugel runs the ship aground on the Tustvold mud flats and wades ashore. (Chapters I.2, II.1, II.2, II.3) At the nearby village of Tustvold he falls in with a quarryman and antiquarian named Nisbet, whose trade is the construction of columns atop which the idle husbands of the industrious village women bask in the rays of the dying sun. The height of the columns is a status symbol and so the village women vie with each other to have Nisbet erect taller and taller columns for their husbands. With the aid of Nisbet's gravity-repellent boot dressing, Cugel comes up with a scheme whereby he surreptitiously removes the bottom segments of every column in order to resell them to the women. The ruse is discovered and he flees the village before the women can lynch him. (Chapter III.1) Travelling onward, in the countryside between Tustvold and Port Perdusz, Cugel narrowly avoids a sticky end at the manse of Faucelme, a magician who recognises the Skybreak Spatterlight and, when Cugel refuses to part with it, attempts various underhand ways of doing away with its present owner. Arriving at Port Perdusz, Cugel discovers that sea passage to Almery is impossible. Using Nisbet's magical boot dressing to render it immune to gravity, Cugel steals a ship, the Avventura, and joins a caravan led by Varmous. The caravan, towing the Avventura and its \\"premium\\" passengers through the air, arrives, after various adventures, in Kaspara Vitatus, the City of Monuments, where the vessel's original owner, Captain Wiskich, and his crew finally catch up with it. (Chapters III.2, IV.1, IV.2) Cugel flees across a barren waste known as the Pale Rugates and finally comes to the town of Gundar, the site of the last remaining Solar Emosynaries, who stimulate the combustion of the dying sun by projecting the heat of a fire at the solar orb through a contraption made of lenses. Cugel manages to gain employment as a night watchman guarding a caravan conveying seventeen virgins south to the temple city of Lumarth. At Lumarth, however, the College of Thurists discover that only two of the seventeen maidens are still virgins. Obliged to expiate his crime, Cugel is sent down into the depths of the temple of the demon Phampoun. Conversing with Pulsifer, a homunculus growing on the end of Phampoun's tongue, Cugel realises that all those who have preceded him have been eaten, but only after regaling the demon with lurid tales of their misdeeds. By inveiglement, he persuades Pulsifer to visit the upper world. On ascending to the temple above, the gigantic Phampoun, who is violently sensitive to light, awakes and runs amok, demolishing the city. (Chapter V.1) Cugel escapes by water, down the River Chaim, as far as the Tsombol Marsh. After crossing the Plain of Standing Stones, Cugel rescues a certain Iolo from a pelgrane, only to be caught by a tentacle that emerges from a hole in the ground, a breach into an otherworld created by a magical adjunct worn by the pelgrane. Iolo, more of a swindler even than Cugel, refuses to assist his erstwhile rescuer and composes himself to sleep; during the night Cugel manages to steal Iolo's bagful of dreams and secretes it within the hole into another dimension. In the morning, Iolo releases Cugel from the grip of the tentacle when he promises to help him catch the supposed thief. They travel to Cuirnif, where Iolo had been hoping to exhibit his dream crystals at Duke Orbal's Grand Exposition. Cugel transports the hole to Cuirnif, which he exhibits, giving it the title \\"Nowhere\\". However, he is forced to enter his own exhibit in order to retrieve Iolo's bagful of dreams. The dream crystals, contaminated with the alien stuff of the otherworld, cause Duke Orbal violently unpleasant visions when he samples them in order to judge the winner of the Grand Exposition. (Chapter V.2) Cugel leaves Cuirnif in a hurry. He finally reaches Almery, where Iucounu repeatedly attempts to steal the Skybreak Spatterlight from him, but is thwarted because the scale absorbs all the magical spells aimed at Cugel. Finally, Cugel fools Iucounu, who has clothed himself in the scales of Sadlark ready to become one with the Overworld entity, into touching his forehead with the Skybreak Spatterlight; Iucounu is instantly absorbed, annihilated. The now complete Sadlark attempts to catch Cugel but stumbles into a fountain and the water dissolves the bonds of force linking together his scales. Cugel is left in possession of Iucounu's manse, Pergolo. (Chapters VI.1, VI.2) Chapter headings * I. From Shanglestone Strand to Saskervoy * 1. Flutic * 2. The Inn of Blue Lamps * II.

Themes The sea voyage Chapter II of Cugel's Saga, \\"From Saskervoy to the Tustvold Mud Flats\\", with three sub- chapters: \\"Aboard the Galante\\", \\"Lausicaa\\" and \\"The Ocean of Sighs\\", is structured around one of Vance's favourite narrative themes: description of a voyage by sailing ship. The theme can also be found in Servants of the Wankh (1969), The Pnume (1970), Maske: Thaery (1976), Showboat World (1975), and Lyonesse (1983). Variants of the same theme are the overland sailing wagons of the Wind-runners of the Palga plateau in The Gray Prince (1974) and, in Cugel's Saga, the ship that is towed through the air in chapter IV.2 \\"The Caravan\\" after being magically charged with Cugel's gravity-repellent boot dressing. Otherworlds Another significant recurring theme in the work of Jack Vance also to be found in Cugel's Saga is that of the \\"otherworld\\". In \\"The Bagful of Dreams\\" (chapter V.2) a magical blue egg worn by a pelgrane around its neck shatters on the ground creating a portal into an otherworld, which turns out to be an interminable region of undulating \\"black spongy stuff\\" whose sole inhabitant is an irascible, gelatinous, tentacular hulk named Uthaw. Similarly, in The Green Pearl, a large part of the narrative is set in the otherworld of Tanjecterly, which Visbhume tricks Glyneth into entering via a hut in the Forest of Tantrevalles. Twitten's Almanack, part of Vance's Lyonesse mythos, describes a number of such otherworlds, of which only Tanjecterly will support human life: Paador, Nith, and Woon; Hidmarth and Skurre, which are \\"purulent places infested with demons\\"; Cheng, which might be home to the sandestins; Pthopus, which is a \\"single torpid soul\\", and Underwood, which is \\"empty save for a moaning sound.\\" In \\"The Seventeen Virgins\\" (chapter V.1), Cugel enters a subworld, or \\"demon-realm\\", inhabited by the photophobic demonic deity Phampoun, who communicates via a homuncular excrescence on the end of his tongue. The narrative device of the journey into the demon subworld is employed at far greater length in Michael Shea's sequel/homage to The Eyes of the Overworld, A Quest for Simbilis (1974),http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?433 and in his novellas \\"Come Then Mortal, We Shall Seek Her Soul\\" and \\"The Fishing of the Demon Sea\\", which form part of Nifft the Lean (1982).http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?23895 The subworld theme is also present in one of Vance's earliest Dying Earth tales, \\"Guyal of Sfere\\" in The Dying Earth (1950), in which the demon-lord Blikdak creates a breach in the vast underground Museum of Man as he tries to rise up from his own subjacent infernal realm. The Skybreak Spatterlight At the beginning of Cugel's Saga the eponymous hero takes employment at Flutic, a manse in the land of Cutz, where an archaeological operation is underway to recover the constituent scales of an Overworld entity named Sadlark. During the Eighteenth Aeon, a demon by the name of Underherd is said to have \\"interfered with the overworld\\", and Sadlark, in trying to set matters right, plunged into the miry pit now found at the back of Flutic, where he became \\"disassociated\\". Master Twango, the owner of Flutic, deals in the scales, selling them to the firm of Soldinck and Mercantides, whose end customer is Iucounu the Laughing Magician. Iucounu, believing himself to be Sadlark's avatar, is in the process of reassembling the Overworld entity, with which he intends to merge himself. Twango's basic reference work on Sadlark's scales is Haruviot's Intimate Anatomy of Several Overworld Personages, which allows him to classify them as \\"ordinaries\\" or \\"specials\\". The latter, possessing a greater charge of Overworld force, are astringent to the touch. Examples of specials are Clover-leaf Femurials, Dorsal Double Luminants, Interlocking Sequalions, Lateral Flashers, Juncture Spikes, the Turret Frontal Lapidative and the Malar Astrangal, which fits over the elbow part of Sadlark's third arm. The most valuable and potent scale of all is the Pectoral Skybreak Spatterlight, or \\"protonastic centrum\\", whose very touch is deadly, absorbing any living creature with which it comes into contact. Iucounu describes it as follows: \\"The protonastic centrum is the node which binds the other scales with lines of force. This node is the soul and force of Sadlark. With the node in place, Sadlark lives once again; indeed Sadlark was never dead, but merely disassociated\\" (Chapter VI.2). Through sheer luck, Cugel obtains the Skybreak Spatterlight from the mire at Flutic, and the scale is the weapon whereby he ultimately defeats his arch-enemy, Iucounu. The Skybreak Spatterlight is central to the plot at a number of points, for example, during Cugel's encounter with the magician Faucelme. It is also by means of the Skybreak Spatterlight that Cugel is able to defeat Nissifer, the monstrous insectoid hybrid of sime and bazil that preys on the passengers of the Avventura. The Skybreak Spatterlight lends an overarching unity to the separate picaresque episodes of Cugel's Saga, with the exception of the chapters \\"The Seventeen Virgins\\" and \\"The Bagful of Dreams\\", which were written and published earlier than the rest of the book and in which Sadlark's protonastic centrum is not mentioned. Fantastic ethnologies One of the defining features of Jack Vance's work is his invention of fictional ethnologies, which encompass culinary, sartorial, marital, economic, architectural, musical, jurisprudential, social etc. customs and practices, as well as, in many cases most importantly, religious beliefs. Significant examples of such fantastic ethnologies in Cugel's Saga are the cultures to be found in Lausicaa, Tustvold, Gundar and Lumarth. The island of Lausicaa (chapter II.2) is notable for its matriarchal social system, which requires that all adult males go \\"under the veil\\". At Tustvold (chapter III.1), the women practise trades (cobbler, tanner, butcher etc.), while their husbands pass their time as idle stylites, basking atop columns in the health-giving rays of the dying sun. The height of a husband's column is an index of the wife's position in the social hierarchy. The description of Gundar (chapter V.1) provides a fuller ethnology, including aspects such as architecture and costume, as well as their historical/mythical rationale. Gundar is the last isolated outpost of the Order of Solar Emosynaries, who believe that by focusing the heat of a fire on the solar disk by means of a complicated contraption of lenses they prevent the dying sun from being extinguished. The natives of Lumarth (chapter V.1) are demon-worshippers who hypocritically justify their religious practices using an elaborate doctrine of altruism and benevolence. Publication history The two separate sections that make up chapter V of Cugel's Saga were published and, it may be assumed, written a number of years prior to the rest of the book.

Textual variants The first six paragraphs of the short story \\"The Seventeen Virgins\\" published in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction (October 1974) differ substantially from the chapter of the same title published in Cugel's Saga (1983) in style, content and the characterisation of Cugel. In the earlier version of the text, Cugel is said to have \\"made a hasty departure\\" from a place called Julle, where he suffered \\"indignities\\" at the hands of his enemies, but also managed to cause them \\"confusion.\\" In the later version, Cugel has fled from Kaspara Vitatus, at the end of the preceding chapter (\\"The Caravan\\"), and the opening two paragraphs cursorily narrate how he baffles the pursuit and then, emerging from hiding, shakes his fist and shouts curses after the distant figures of the angry mob as they return to town. Where the later version briefly narrates Cugel's journey across the wilderness known as the Pale Rugates without any indication as to his inner state - he is described merely as marching for an unspecified number of days, eating \\"ramp, burdock, squallix and an occasional newt\\" to fend off starvation - the earlier version explores Cugel's affective reactions to his environment and situation, for example: \\"The breadth of the sky exalted his soul; the emptiness of the far distances caused him fatigue and despondency.\\" Similarly, in a \\"spasm of self-assertion\\", Cugel delivers the following soliloquy in the first version: A comparison of the following paragraph in its two variants will serve to show how in the later version Vance has honed his prose style, paring away redundant adverbs, descriptive language and psychological details: Reception Algis Budrys noted that \\"Vance holds and holds you with various devices while you are gradually coming to know and appreciate his unlovable hero.\\"\\"Books,\\" F&SF;, April 1984, p. 30-1 References Sources  External links * Category:Dying Earth Category:Novels by Jack Vance Category:American fantasy novels Category:1983 American novels Category:1983 fantasy novels ","title":"Cugel's Saga"},{"id":"11718373","text":"Samuel Purviance is the name of: * Samuel Anderson Purviance (1809-1882), U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania * Samuel D.

She was built in Essex, Massachusetts, USA, and launched in 1926 to work the Grand Banks fishing grounds out of Gloucester. She is one of only two surviving knockabout fishing schooners ‚Äì ships designed without bowsprits for the safety of her crew. Adventure was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1994, underwent a substantial restoration in 2012, and sails today in the tourist trade out of Gloucester. History Designed by Thomas F. McManus of Boston and built at the John F. James & Son Yard in Essex, Massachusetts, for Captain Jeff Thomas of Gloucester, Adventure was one of the last wooden sailing vessels of her kind built for the dory-fishing industry. Adventure, named for one of the fantasy fleet of ships drawn by Captain Thomas's young son, is a knockabout schooner, designed without a bowsprit for the safety of the crew. The McManus knockabout design was regarded by maritime historian, Howard I. Chapelle, as \\"the acme in the long evolution of the New England fishing schooner.\\" Launched on 16 September 1926, Adventure measured overall, sported a gaff rig and carried a diesel engine, and a crew of twenty-seven. She fished the once bountiful Grand Banks of the North Atlantic from her home port of Gloucester from 1926 to 1953 under Captain Jeff Thomas and later, Captain Leo Hynes. Adventure was the biggest money-maker of the time, landing nearly $4 million worth of cod and halibut in her fishing career. Her retirement marked the end of the American dory-fishing schooner in the North Atlantic. In 1954, Adventure was sold to Donald Hurd, Dayton Newton, and Herbert Beizer and refitted for the windjammer tourist trade, carrying vacationing passengers up and down the Maine coast. The fish pens were converted into cabins and the engine removed to make room for sleeping quarters. Adventures prowess in the Gulf of Maine earned her the nickname \\"Queen of the Windjammers.\\" In 1964 she was sold to Captain Jim Sharp of Camden, Maine, who continued her career in the tourist trade for nearly twenty-four years. In 1988, Captain Sharp donated Adventure to the people of Gloucester to be preserved as Gloucester's historic tall ship, to be used to educate the public about the role of fishing in American history. In 1988, the non-profit group, Gloucester Adventure, Inc., was formed to preserve the schooner as a monument to the history of Gloucester. Through the efforts of the Gloucester Adventure, Inc. and dedicated volunteers, Adventure is now a destination site on the Essex National Heritage Area Maritime Trail, is listed in the National Register of Historic Places and is a designated National Historic Landmark. In 1999, Adventure was selected as an Official Project of Save America's Treasures by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Restoration Undergoing Restoration in 2012 Restoration work on Adventure was commenced in 2012 at Maritime Gloucester on Harbor Loop. In September 2012 she was fitted with a Detroit Diesel 671 engine and moved under her own mechanical power for the first time since 1954. In August 2013 she left Gloucester Harbor under full sail, and received her Passenger Vessel certificate from the United States Coast Guard in June 2015.http://schooner-adventure.org/passenger-vessel- certificate-issued/ See also * List of schooners * National Register of Historic Places listings in Gloucester, Massachusetts * National Register of Historic Places listings in Essex County, Massachusetts * List of National Historic Landmarks in Massachusetts References External links  * Category:National Historic Landmarks in Massachusetts Category:Individual sailing vessels Category:Tall ships of the United States Category:Schooners of the United States Category:Ships built in Essex, Massachusetts Category:1926 ships Category:Ships on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts Category:Buildings and structures in Gloucester, Massachusetts Category:National Register of Historic Places in Essex County, Massachusetts ","title":"Adventure (1926 schooner)"},{"id":"11718405","text":"Addie is a given name, nickname and surname.

Spagone, 555 U.S. 1220 (2009), was a legal case in which the United States Supreme Court had to decide whether individuals can be imprisoned indefinitely for suspected wrongdoing without being charged with a crime and tried before a jury. The case was dismissed as moot on March 6, 2009, by the application of the Acting Solicitor General to transfer petitioner from military custody to the custody of the Attorney General. The Fourth Circuit had ruled that a United States resident cannot be held on suspicion of terrorist activities, but must be charged in a domestic court or released. Background The federal government arrested Ali Saleh Kahlah al- Marri on December 12, 2001, and indicted him on charges two years later on apparently unrelated charges of credit card fraud and assorted crimes of dishonesty. On June 23, 2003, President George W. Bush's administration determined al-Marri to be an enemy combatant and ordered him transferred to the custody of the U.S. Department of Defense.Enemy Combatant Designation by President Bush. The federal government asserts he is a sleeper agent for the terrorist organization Al-Qaeda, sent to the United States to explore disruptions of the country's financial systems. This was said to justify his detention without trial in civilian courts. Since that time, he has been held at the naval brig in Charleston, South Carolina. He is the only known enemy combatant to be held in military custody on U.S. soil (others are being held at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba). Fourth Circuit decision Judge Diana Gribbon Motz wrote the plurality opinion, which held that, as a legal resident of the United States who was originally detained in the United States, al-Marri could not be held in military custody as an enemy combatant. The court also held that the Military Commissions Act does not strip federal courts of jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus petitions from alleged enemy combatants arrested and detained within the borders of the United States. The court ordered the government to either charge al-Marri with a crime, initiate deportation proceedings, or release him. Dissenting from the opinion, Judge Henry E. Hudson indicated that he believed Bush possessed the authority to detain alleged sleeper agents such as al-Marri, \\"the type of stealth warrior used by Al Qaeda\\".Complete decision on Findlaw.com, Hudson's Dissent, at pg. 86. The decision of Judge Motz was subsequently set aside and the case was reheard en banc on August 22, 2007, by the entire Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. In a plurality opinion issued on July 15, 2008, the court held that the president did have authority to hold Al-Marri in military custody, but that Al-Marri was entitled to a greater, but undefined, degree of due process in his habeas corpus petition than had been accorded by the court below. The Supreme Court granted certiorari. Shortly following his becoming president, President Barack Obama ordered Al-Marri transferred to civilian authorities, and the Supreme Court dismissed the case as moot on March 6, 2009. Al-Marri was subsequently prosecuted in civilian court and pleaded guilty. He had been imprisoned for eight years without charges. See also *Habeas corpus *United States v.

Rasmussen with cover art by Bob Maurus. Plot summary Ghost of Lion Castle is a solo scenario, including solo combat rules, and is intended for a low-level character. The player character investigates a castle shaped like a vast lion. Ghost of Lion Castle is a Basic D&D; adventure that can be played in a few solitary hours, in which the player can be heir to the great wizard Sargon whose ghost haunts Lion Castle. The player can use one of six provided magic-user or elf characters or one of the player's own player characters, limited to the modified spells listed and to third-level experience. The player gets maps of the main walls and hallways of Lion Castle, printed on three of the cover's six panels. With twelve days' rations when the character reaches the outer wall, the character still must be crafty enough to fight through wandering monsters and deadly traps to gain Sargon's blessing. This adventure is intended for one player only, who makes all of the choices and enjoys all of the rewards. A mighty wizard once lived in Lion Castle, but he is a ghost now, haunting those halls, and waiting for an heir. It is said that he is a great cat that sits upon the northern grasslands, waiting to pounce on adventurers just like the player characters. Publication history Ghost of Lion Castle was written by Merle M. Rasmussen, and published by TSR in 1984 as a 32-page booklet with an outer folder. Reception C. Mara Mallory reviewed Ghost of Lion Castle in The Space Gamer No. 75. Mallory commented that \\"The 'R' rules entries are a 'programmed introduction' to the programmed game entries. The 'magic journal' of notes down the page edges enables you to leave message for future characters, as well as note changes in the contents of a room when you loot it or die there ‚Äì all to lend greater realism in replays. While valuable room contents are often for either a magic-user or a fighter (not both), fortunate probing and good rolls with wandering monsters can net some valuable treasures and experience for a developing D&D; character.\\" The reviewer continued \\"Unless you read maps and directions, you may lose your way in the castle entries, confused by four similar tower staircases and entries with as many as twelve alternative action choices. Well-rendered but sparse interior illustrations do little to clarify entry descriptions. And while it is possible to fight your way through Lion Castle on your own, magical combat is set up to be virtually unplayable without the Basic D&D; rules.\\" Mallory concluded the review by saying \\"Not as complex and involved as the invisible- ink solo modules, Ghost of Lion Castle offers little for anyone but the Basic D&D; gamer trying to gain experience for a low-level character. The 'magic journal' does enhance replayability, and there is adequate material for a gamemaster to use the module to create a new adventure. But those who are looking for a challenging solo would do well to look elsewhere.\\" References External links * The B series from The Acaeum * Category:Dungeons & Dragons modules Category:Mystara ","title":"Ghost of Lion Castle"},{"id":"11718481","text":"Samuel Woodson may refer to: * Samuel H.

Eventually, after the war, the village was deserted with all houses burnt-out. In the 1970s, there was a small dwelling for forest workers and, in 1975, the area was taken over by the Council of Ministers.

The Liouville dynamical system is one of several things named after Joseph Liouville, an eminent French mathematician. Example of bicentric orbits In classical mechanics, Euler's three-body problem describes the motion of a particle in a plane under the influence of two fixed centers, each of which attract the particle with an inverse-square force such as Newtonian gravity or Coulomb's law. Examples of the bicenter problem include a planet moving around two slowly moving stars, or an electron moving in the electric field of two positively charged nuclei, such as the first ion of the hydrogen molecule H2, namely the hydrogen molecular ion or H2+. The strength of the two attractions need not be equal; thus, the two stars may have different masses or the nuclei two different charges.

The potential energy of the moving particle is given by : V(x, y) = \\\\frac{-\\\\mu_{1}}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\left( x - a \\\\right)^{2} + y^{2}}} - \\\\frac{\\\\mu_{2}}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\left( x + a \\\\right)^{2} + y^{2}}} . The two centers of attraction can be considered as the foci of a set of ellipses. If either center were absent, the particle would move on one of these ellipses, as a solution of the Kepler problem. Therefore, according to Bonnet's theorem, the same ellipses are the solutions for the bicenter problem. Introducing elliptic coordinates, : x = a \\\\cosh \\\\xi \\\\cos \\\\eta, : y = a \\\\sinh \\\\xi \\\\sin \\\\eta, the potential energy can be written as : V(\\\\xi, \\\\eta) = \\\\frac{-\\\\mu_{1}}{a\\\\left( \\\\cosh \\\\xi - \\\\cos \\\\eta \\\\right)} - \\\\frac{\\\\mu_{2}}{a\\\\left( \\\\cosh \\\\xi + \\\\cos \\\\eta \\\\right)} = \\\\frac{-\\\\mu_{1} \\\\left( \\\\cosh \\\\xi + \\\\cos \\\\eta \\\\right) - \\\\mu_{2} \\\\left( \\\\cosh \\\\xi - \\\\cos \\\\eta \\\\right)}{a\\\\left( \\\\cosh^{2} \\\\xi - \\\\cos^{2} \\\\eta \\\\right)}, and the kinetic energy as : T = \\\\frac{ma^{2}}{2} \\\\left( \\\\cosh^{2} \\\\xi - \\\\cos^{2} \\\\eta \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\dot{\\\\xi}^{2} + \\\\dot{\\\\eta}^{2} \\\\right). This is a Liouville dynamical system if Œæ and Œ∑ are taken as œÜ1 and œÜ2, respectively; thus, the function Y equals : Y = \\\\cosh^{2} \\\\xi - \\\\cos^{2} \\\\eta and the function W equals : W = -\\\\mu_{1} \\\\left( \\\\cosh \\\\xi + \\\\cos \\\\eta \\\\right) - \\\\mu_{2} \\\\left( \\\\cosh \\\\xi - \\\\cos \\\\eta \\\\right) Using the general solution for a Liouville dynamical system below, one obtains : \\\\frac{ma^{2}}{2} \\\\left( \\\\cosh^{2} \\\\xi - \\\\cos^{2} \\\\eta \\\\right)^{2} \\\\dot{\\\\xi}^{2} = E \\\\cosh^{2} \\\\xi + \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\mu_{1} + \\\\mu_{2}}{a} \\\\right) \\\\cosh \\\\xi - \\\\gamma : \\\\frac{ma^{2}}{2} \\\\left( \\\\cosh^{2} \\\\xi - \\\\cos^{2} \\\\eta \\\\right)^{2} \\\\dot{\\\\eta}^{2} = -E \\\\cos^{2} \\\\eta + \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\mu_{1} - \\\\mu_{2}}{a} \\\\right) \\\\cos \\\\eta + \\\\gamma Introducing a parameter u by the formula : du = \\\\frac{d\\\\xi}{\\\\sqrt{E \\\\cosh^{2} \\\\xi + \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\mu_{1} + \\\\mu_{2}}{a} \\\\right) \\\\cosh \\\\xi - \\\\gamma}} = \\\\frac{d\\\\eta}{\\\\sqrt{-E \\\\cos^{2} \\\\eta + \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\mu_{1} - \\\\mu_{2}}{a} \\\\right) \\\\cos \\\\eta + \\\\gamma}}, gives the parametric solution : u = \\\\int \\\\frac{d\\\\xi}{\\\\sqrt{E \\\\cosh^{2} \\\\xi + \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\mu_{1} + \\\\mu_{2}}{a} \\\\right) \\\\cosh \\\\xi - \\\\gamma}} = \\\\int \\\\frac{d\\\\eta}{\\\\sqrt{-E \\\\cos^{2} \\\\eta + \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\mu_{1} - \\\\mu_{2}}{a} \\\\right) \\\\cos \\\\eta + \\\\gamma}}. Since these are elliptic integrals, the coordinates Œæ and Œ∑ can be expressed as elliptic functions of u. Constant of motion The bicentric problem has a constant of motion, namely, : r_{1}^{2} r_{2}^{2} \\\\left( \\\\frac{d\\\\theta_{1}}{dt} \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\frac{d\\\\theta_{2}}{dt} \\\\right) - 2c \\\\left[ \\\\mu_{1} \\\\cos \\\\theta_{1} + \\\\mu_{2} \\\\cos \\\\theta_{2} \\\\right], from which the problem can be solved using the method of the last multiplier. Derivation New variables To eliminate the v functions, the variables are changed to an equivalent set : \\\\varphi_{r} = \\\\int dq_{r} \\\\sqrt{v_{r}(q_{r})}, giving the relation : v_{1}(q_{1}) \\\\dot{q}_{1}^{2} + v_{2}(q_{2}) \\\\dot{q}_{2}^{2} + \\\\cdots + v_{s}(q_{s}) \\\\dot{q}_{s}^{2} = \\\\dot{\\\\varphi}_{1}^{2} + \\\\dot{\\\\varphi}_{2}^{2} + \\\\cdots + \\\\dot{\\\\varphi}_{s}^{2} = F, which defines a new variable F. Using the new variables, the u and w functions can be expressed by equivalent functions œá and œâ. Denoting the sum of the œá functions by Y, : Y = \\\\chi_{1}(\\\\varphi_{1}) + \\\\chi_{2}(\\\\varphi_{2}) + \\\\cdots + \\\\chi_{s}(\\\\varphi_{s}), the kinetic energy can be written as : T = \\\\frac{1}{2} Y F. Similarly, denoting the sum of the œâ functions by W : W = \\\\omega_{1}(\\\\varphi_{1}) + \\\\omega_{2}(\\\\varphi_{2}) + \\\\cdots + \\\\omega_{s}(\\\\varphi_{s}), the potential energy V can be written as : V = \\\\frac{W}{Y}. Lagrange equation The Lagrange equation for the rth variable \\\\varphi_{r} is : \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{\\\\varphi}_{r}} \\\\right) = \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\left( Y \\\\dot{\\\\varphi}_{r} \\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{2} F \\\\frac{\\\\partial Y}{\\\\partial \\\\varphi_{r}} -\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial \\\\varphi_{r}}. Multiplying both sides by 2 Y \\\\dot{\\\\varphi}_{r}, re-arranging, and exploiting the relation 2T = YF yields the equation : 2 Y \\\\dot{\\\\varphi}_{r} \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\left(Y \\\\dot{\\\\varphi}_{r}\\\\right) = 2T\\\\dot{\\\\varphi}_{r} \\\\frac{\\\\partial Y}{\\\\partial \\\\varphi_{r}} - 2 Y \\\\dot{\\\\varphi}_{r} \\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial \\\\varphi_{r}} = 2 \\\\dot{\\\\varphi}_{r} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\varphi_{r}} \\\\left[ (E-V) Y \\\\right], which may be written as : \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\left(Y^{2} \\\\dot{\\\\varphi}_{r}^{2} \\\\right) = 2 E \\\\dot{\\\\varphi}_{r} \\\\frac{\\\\partial Y}{\\\\partial \\\\varphi_{r}} - 2 \\\\dot{\\\\varphi}_{r} \\\\frac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial \\\\varphi_{r}} = 2E \\\\dot{\\\\varphi}_{r} \\\\frac{d\\\\chi_{r} }{d\\\\varphi_{r}} - 2 \\\\dot{\\\\varphi}_{r} \\\\frac{d\\\\omega_{r}}{d\\\\varphi_{r}}, where E = T + V is the (conserved) total energy. It follows that : \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\left(Y^{2} \\\\dot{\\\\varphi}_{r}^{2} \\\\right) = 2\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\left( E \\\\chi_{r} - \\\\omega_{r} \\\\right), which may be integrated once to yield : \\\\frac{1}{2} Y^{2} \\\\dot{\\\\varphi}_{r}^{2} = E \\\\chi_{r} - \\\\omega_{r} + \\\\gamma_{r}, where the \\\\gamma_{r} are constants of integration subject to the energy conservation : \\\\sum_{r=1}^{s} \\\\gamma_{r} = 0. Inverting, taking the square root and separating the variables yields a set of separably integrable equations: : \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{Y} dt = \\\\frac{d\\\\varphi_{1}}{\\\\sqrt{E \\\\chi_{1} - \\\\omega_{1} + \\\\gamma_{1}}} = \\\\frac{d\\\\varphi_{2}}{\\\\sqrt{E \\\\chi_{2} - \\\\omega_{2} + \\\\gamma_{2}}} = \\\\cdots = \\\\frac{d\\\\varphi_{s}}{\\\\sqrt{E \\\\chi_{s} - \\\\omega_{s} + \\\\gamma_{s}}}.

Biography  Born into a family of physicians, Braunberger at the age of seven was already determined not have the same life as his father, and not to take up medicine as a career. He saw a screening of Fant√¥mas at the Gaumont Th√©√¢tre, the first cinema to open in Paris, and decided to work in the cinema. After the First World War, at the age of 15, he produced and directed his first film: Frankfurt in Germany. He left for successive adventures in Berlin, London at Brocklis establishments, where he worked. In 1923, he left for New York, where he worked for a few weeks at Fox Film Corporation, and became a director of production along with Ferdinand H. Adam where he also worked on films with Frank Merrill. In the course of his films in Los Angeles, he came to know Irving Thalberg who employed him at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as one of his assistants. He stayed there for eighteen months, and established contacts with one of the greatest directors of the time. Wanting to direct and produce in France, he returned to Paris and got to know Jean Renoir, with whom he worked on Avec qui il va tourner, The Whirlpool of Fate, Nana and Tire-au-flanc. In 1929, Braunberger created Productions Pierre Braunberger and N√©ofilms for the production of his first French-speaking film (La route est belle by Robert Florey). In 1930, Braunberger became head of the Pantheon Cinema and continued there for sixty years. He renovated the lobby, created 450 seats, and installed Western Electric projectors and sound equipment. Although subtitles were yet to be invented, he was the first to show foreign films in their original versions. One year later, he met with Roger Richeb√© to produce under the name of √âtablissements Braunberger-Richeb√©. A few films were produced, such as le Blanc et le noir by Robert Florey, Isn't Life a Bitch? by Jean Renoir, and Chocolati√®re et Fanny by Marc All√©gret. In 1933, still only 28, he decided to continue alone, and formed studios de Billancourt, which became Paris-Studio-Cin√©ma. During World War two he was not able to produce a film because he was Jewish. At the end of the Second World War, Braunberger transformed a local Gestapo office into the Cinema Studio \\"Studio Lhmond\\", which he used to discover new talents of the \\"nouvelle vague\\", including Jean- Pierre Melville, Jean-Luc Godard and Alain Resnais. In 1966 he was the head of the jury at the 16th Berlin International Film Festival. Braunberger died in 1990.

Taxonomy This genus is most closely related to the genus Bagroides. In turn, these two genera are most closely related to Leiocassis. The genus can be split into two lineages. B. hypselopterus, B. macracanthus, B. majusculus, and B. vaillantii have long dorsal fins with 18 or more serrations in adults, while B. macropterus, B. micranodus, and B. obscurus have short dorsal fins with 15 or fewer serrations in adults. The first lineage is more derived, while the second lineage is more basal.  Species  This genus currently contains seven described species: * Bagrichthys hypselopterus (Bleeker, 1852) (Blacklancer catfish) * Bagrichthys macracanthus (Bleeker, 1854) (Black lancer catfish) * Bagrichthys macropterus (Bleeker, 1854) (False black lancer) * Bagrichthys majusculus H. H. Ng, 2002 * Bagrichthys micranodus T. R. Roberts, 1989 * Bagrichthys obscurus H. H. Ng, 1999 * Bagrichthys vaillantii (Popta, 1906) Distribution Members of this genus are found in Southeast Asia. Description Bagrichthys catfishes are highly specialized. Fish of this genus are characterised by their elongate and laterally compressed caudal peduncle, the dorsally-directed serrations on the posterior edge of the dorsal fin spine, gill membranes united at the isthmus, and a long adipose fin without a free posterior margin. These fish can grow between about 20-40 centimetres (8-16 in) in length. The coloration of Bagrichthys species varies from tan to black; however, coloration can vary between individuals based on environmental conditions. These species have a small narrow mouth, moderately elongate convoluted intestines, and greatly reduced oral dentition. Many of the Bagrichthys species appear rather similar. B. obscurus and B. majusculus were both identified after it was recognized that they were different species from B. macropterus and B. macracanthus, respectively, which these two species had previously been misidentified as. The male can be distinguished from the female. The male possesses a genital papilla just before the anal fin, while the female does not. Also, in B. majusculus, B. obscurus, and B. vaillantii the nasal and maxillary barbels of males are more than twice as long as barbels of females; this may hold true for the whole genus. Ecology Bagrichthys species live in large muddy rivers throughout Southeast Asia. However, juveniles may be found in smaller streams and flooded forests during the rainy season. The normal habitats of Bagrichthys species are large, slow-flowing rivers, generally acidic(pH 5-6) and with turbid water and a muddy substrate. Bagrichthys species are reported to feed on small fishes, benthic invertebrates, and large amounts of plant detritus. B. hypselopterus consumes large amounts of silt as it targets chironomid larvae and pupae. B. macropterus may be molluscivorous as their guts have been found to contain large quantities of Rivomarginella gastropod shells. These species spawn in the beginning of the rainy season and utilize flooded forests along the river edge. Juveniles appear in August. In the aquarium B. macracanthus, the Black lancer, is the only species of this genus that is traded for the aquarium hobby. When these fish are first imported, they are often young and in bad condition. It has been recommended to acclimate these fish at a high temperature (about 29 ¬∞C or 85 ¬∞F). Though nocturnal, this species may be trained to eat in the light; it may even be trained to feed from the owner's hand. These fish tend to be territorial among their own kinds though this behavior can be reduced by placing a male with multiple females. This species is quite adaptable with pH and DH and will thrive as long as extremes are avoided.

The library is the result of a project begun in 1890, when members of the Two Rivers Branch of the Chautauqua Reading Circle met to consider the establishment of a public library and reading room. Leopold Mann donated $500 and the land for the building and Mrs. Mary Mann donated an additional $1,000 toward the building on the condition that the new library be named after her late husband, Joseph. On December 17, 1891 the Joseph Mann library opened to the public. The total cost of the library including building, heater, furniture and the initial book collection was $3,363.73. Lizzie H. Yahnke was the first librarian. In 1914, Two Rivers built its new Carnegie library, still called the Joseph Mann Library, but located across the street from the original library. Though extensively remodeled and expanded during the 1950s and 60s, community leaders soon recognized that a more modern and spacious facility would be needed. On May 15, 1995, James Lester, chairman of the Board and CEO of Eggers Industries of Two Rivers, and his wife Barbee offered the Two Rivers City Council $1 million toward the construction of a new library. The City Council readily accepted and on June 28, 1997 the Lester Public Library‚Äînamed in honor of Jim's parents, George and Marcia Lester‚Äîopened for business. Lester Public Library sits on the shores of Lake Michigan in the city of Two Rivers, Wisconsin.

Galaxy Explorers was created to prepare children for the future; a future that advances a space faring civilization.\\"FOGE Information Philosophy FOGE operates using the following guiding principles for its members, called Guide Stars: *The future welcomes everybody *I will support the vision and mission of the Federation of Galaxy Explorers *I will be enthusiastic *I will work as a team member and support my fellow Galaxy Explorers *I will treat everyone with kindness, respect, and dignity *I will be honest *I will make opportunities, not wait for them to happen *I will do my best at everything I do *I will make the world a better place School Year Program Similar in some respects to Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, FOGE sponsors monthly after-school (or evening) \\"Mission Team\\" meetings and periodic field trips, where adult volunteers teach space subjects and lead the participants in projects in space science, earth science, engineering and rocketry. Another primary theme - Space Citizenship - teaches the role of government, the power of citizens in a democracy, the promise of space expressed in art, writing, history, and business. Mission Team members wear uniform shirts and are rewarded for participation and achievements with ribbons, patches, medals, and certificates. Awards are an integral part of the program providing children self-esteem through achievement and recognition. Summer Program Space-themed summer camps are held, offering younger participants the chance to design and build a simulated \\"moonbase\\". High- school aged participants have the opportunity to build and launch rockets with simulated satellites (instrument packages) that can reach altitudes of up to 2 miles, and are recovered by parachute while transmitting real-time telemetry data on position, attitude, temperature and other parameters. Interactive Software FOGE aims to support and teach children about space. One method of doing so is through interactive video games, such as MoonBaseOne, which has had over 30,000 players. History FOGE began in 2002 with pilot programs in Colorado, Maryland, Washington, D.C. and Virginia. It has since expanded to Montana, Texas, California, and New Mexico, and supports over 15,000 participants. Benefits The Federation of Galaxy Explorers was incorporated in the state of Maryland as a 501(c)3 non profit organization. The organization seeks to inspire and educate kids in space related science and engineering. Galaxy Explorers was created to prepare children for the future; a future that advances a space faring civilization. Objectives: * Educate kids - The Galaxy Explorers will prepare children for employment in the 21st century. * Galvanize support for space - Over time, Galaxy Explorers kids will grow to create a long term citizen activist force in society; shaping the national space policy, and furthering the science and engineering required to create a space faring civilization. * Economical - The concept of Galaxy Explorers is an extremely inexpensive means of educating the future generations by drawing on the volunteer spirit of America. The program provides a critical support infrastructure to motivate and educate children outside of the classroom. This infrastructure is particularly important given America's lack of classroom resources, science and math teachers, and modern day peer pressure. The Way Forward In 2002, Galaxy Explorers pilot programs began at pilot schools in Colorado, Maryland, Washington, D.C. and Virginia, where we conducted a summer space camp for 150 children. In less than five years we hosted 5000 children in 25 summer camps, after school, and evening programs. We hosted an additional 15,000 children in Special Events. We expanded the program to MT, TX, PA, MO, NJ, and NM. To accomplish this expansion, Galaxy Explorers has established partnerships with government agencies, businesses, and non-profit organizations. In addition, the effort is strongly supported by Congressional Members and staff.

They have assisted over 2,100 people with dying at home within Switzerland and at Dignitas' house/flat near Z√ºrich. Additionally, they do advisory work on palliative care, health care advance directive and suicide attempt prevention, and they have been leading and supporting numerous court cases and legislation projects for right-to-die laws around the world. Members of Dignitas who wish for an assisted suicide have to be of sound judgement, themselves able to do the last act which brings about death, and submit a formal request including a letter explaining their wish to die and most of all medical reports showing diagnosis and treatments tried. For people with severe psychiatric illnesses, additionally, an in-depth medical report prepared by a psychiatrist that establishes the patient's condition, is required as per a Swiss Supreme Court decision.  History and operation  Dignitas was founded 17 May 1998 by Ludwig Minelli, a Swiss lawyer specialising in human rights law. Swiss laws provide that assistance to suicide is legal as long as it is not motivated by selfish motives. The person who wishes to die meets several Dignitas personnel, in addition to an independent medical doctor, for a private consultation. The independent doctor assesses the evidence provided by the patient in advance and is met on two separate occasions, with a time gap between each of the consultations. Legally admissible proof that the person wishes to die is also created, in the form of a signed affidavit, countersigned by independent witnesses. In cases where a person is physically unable to sign a document, a short video film of the person is made in which they are asked to confirm their identity, that they wish to die, and that their decision is made of their own free will, without any form of persuasion / coercion. This evidence of informed consent remains private and is preserved only for use in any possible legal dispute. Finally, a few minutes before the lethal overdose is provided, the person is once again reminded that taking the overdose will surely kill them. Additionally, they are asked several times whether they want to proceed, or take some time to consider the matter further. This gives the person the opportunity to stop the process at any time. However, if at this point the person states that they are determined to proceed, a lethal overdose is provided and ingested.  Suicide method  In general, Dignitas uses the following protocol to assist suicides: an oral dose of an antiemetic drug, followed approximately half an hour later by a lethal overdose of 15 grams of powdered pentobarbital dissolved in a glass of water. If necessary, the drugs can be ingested via a drinking straw. The pentobarbital overdose depresses the central nervous system, causing the person to become drowsy and fall asleep within 3‚Äì5 minutes of drinking it. Anaesthesia progresses to coma and later, as the person's breathing becomes more shallow, is followed by respiratory arrest and death, which occurs within 30‚Äì40 minutes of ingesting the pentobarbital. Exceptionally, in four cases in 2008, Dignitas used breathing helium gas as a suicide method instead of a pentobarbital overdose. The medical supervision was still observed, however, and the method avoided controlled drugs, which reduced the risk of the medical board / authorities harassing the medical doctor giving a \\"green light\\" for the accompanied suicide.  Referendum  In two referendums on 15 May 2011, voters in the Canton of Z√ºrich overwhelmingly rejected calls to ban assisted suicide or to outlaw the practice for non-residents. Out of more than 278,000 ballots cast, the initiative to ban assisted suicide was rejected by 85 per cent of voters and the initiative to outlaw it for non-residents was turned down by 78 per cent.  Statistics  Ludwig Minelli said in an interview in March 2008 that Dignitas had assisted 840 people to die, 60% of them Germans.Wenn Sie das trinken, gibt es kein Zur√ºck Tagesspiegel.de Retrieved April 12, 2008 By 2010, that number had exceeded a thousand assisted suicides. Most people contacting Dignitas do not plan to die but wish for insurance in case their illness becomes intolerable. Of those who receive the so-called \\"provisional green light\\", 70% never return to Dignitas. 21% of people receiving assisted suicide in Dignitas do not have a terminal or progressive illness, but rather \\"weariness of life\\".  Costs and finances  According to the official Dignitas website, as of 2017 Dignitas charges its patients 7,000 Swiss Francs (approx. ¬£5,180 / US$7,980) for preparation and suicide assistance, or 10,500 Swiss Francs (approx. ¬£7,770 / US$11,970) in case of taking over family duties, including funerals, medical costs and official fees. Dignitas has been known to waive certain costs where there is hardship.Man who helped partner die calls for assisted suicide law change, The Guardian, 15 June 2009 Under Swiss Law, Dignitas operates as a non-profit organization, but does not open its finances to the public,Branching Out to Serve a Growing but Dying Market Washington Post, November 1, 2005 which has elicited criticism from some quarters.  'Suicide tourism'  Although mainly Germans turn to Dignitas for so called 'assisted suicide', as of August 2015, approximately 300 British citizens have travelled to Switzerland from the UK to die at one of Dignitas' rented apartments in Z√ºrich.  Allegations by Dignitas ex-employee  Soraya Wernli (a nurse employed by Dignitas for two-and-a-half years, until March 2005), accused the organization of being a 'production line of death concerned only with profits'. Wernli claimed many wealthy and vulnerable people bequeathed \\"vast sums\\" to Minelli in addition to standard fees and some were not terminally ill. She also complained some patients died in pain, and resigned after an alleged incident in which a new type of machine left a client suffering for 70 hours. Dignitas denied all allegations and pointed out that Wernli left Dignitas several years ago. Minelli said that \\"If the state prosecutors feel I‚Äôm making myself rich they should start legal proceedings.\\"telegraph.co.uk Dignitas founder accused of profiting from assisted suicides  Reaction of local Swiss people and authorities  Dignitas-founder Ludwig Minelli describes the difficulties that Dignitas has faced over the years. In Sept 2007, it was evicted, blocked or locked out of three flats, and so Mr Minelli offered assisted suicide in his private house. This, however, was then prohibited by the local council. In October 2007, Dignitas was again prevented from working in a private house by the local council and refused rooms on an industrial site. In December 2007, an interim judgment prevented Dignitas from working in a building next to a busy brothel. The media frenzy led to several people offering Dignitas flats or houses, of which one turned out to be suitable. Since 2009, Dignitas has a house at an undisclosed location where accompanied suicide for people from abroad has taken place.  Patient selection  In certain right-to-die organisations, an age restriction is in place for potential patients, so as to prevent young people from using their services.Fischer S. Huber CA. Imhof L. Mahrer Imhof R. Furter M. Ziegler SJ. Bosshard G. Suicide assisted by two Swiss right-to-die organization's, example zalia cyrilia an African was suffering from cancer only paid 2000 to get killed. Journal of Medical Ethics. 2008; 34(11):810-4.  Cremation urns found in Lake Z√ºrich In April 2010, private divers found a group of over 60 cremation urns in Lake Z√ºrich. Each of the urns bore the logo of the Z√ºrich Nordheim crematorium () also used by Dignitas. Soraya Wernli, a former employee, had told The Times 18 months previously that Dignitas had dumped at least 300 urns in the lake. She claimed that Minelli dumped them there himself, but later asked his daughter and another member of staff to do it. In 2008, allegedly two members of Dignitas were caught trying to pour the ashes of 20 dead people into the lake. However, it was never established whether Dignitas had anything to do with it and no charges were taken. In Switzerland, it is not against the law to scatter cremation ashes out into nature.  Dignitas in media  In 2008, the documentary film Right to Die? was broadcast on Sky Real Lives (rebroadcast on PBS Frontline in March 2010 as The Suicide Tourist). Directed by Oscar-winning Canadian John Zaritsky, it depicts the assisted suicide of several people who have gone to Switzerland to end their lives. It includes the story of Craig Ewert, a 59-year-old retired university professor who suffered from a motor neurone disease. Ewert traveled to Switzerland where he was assisted by the Dignitas NGO. The documentary shows him passing away with Mary, his wife of 37 years, at his side. It was shown on the Swiss television network SF1 and is available as a web movie on the Dignitas website. The BBC produced a film titled A Short Stay in SwitzerlandDaily Mail Online: 'Anne, if you drink this you will die': Why we stood by and allowed our mother to commit suicide By Andrea Thompson telling the story of Dr Anne Turner, who made the journey to the Dignitas assisted suicide clinic. On January 24, 2006, the day before her 67th birthday, she ended her life. The film was shown on BBC1 on January 25, 2009. British maestro Sir Edward Downes, who conducted the BBC Philharmonic and the Royal Opera but struggled in recent years (but was not terminally ill) as his hearing and sight failed, died with his wife, who had terminal cancer, at an assisted suicide clinic in Switzerland in July 2009. He was 85 and she was 74. French theorist and translator Michele Causse chose to die on her birthday, July 29, 2010, in association with Dignitas.http://michele-causse.com/ Michele Causse On June 13, 2011, BBC Two aired a documentary titled Terry Pratchett: Choosing to Die, featuring author and Alzheimer's disease sufferer Sir Terry Pratchett guiding viewers through an assisted suicide which took place at Dignitas facilities in Switzerland. Peter Smedley, a British hotelier and millionaire, and his wife Christine allowed for Pratchett to film Smedley's deliberate consumption of prepared barbiturate in a glass in order to kill himself as Christine comforted Smedley in his demise. The documentary received a highly polarized reaction in the United Kingdom, with much praise for the programme as \\"brave\\", \\"sensitive\\" and \\"important\\" whilst it also gathered accusations of \\"pro-death\\" bias from anti-euthanasia pressure groups and of encouraging the view that disability was a good reason for killing from disability groups. Dignitas continued to be presented in the media as a political stance on the right to die. BBC featured an article regarding the death of UK citizen Jeffrey Spector, a businessman who decided to travel to Switzerland to undergo assisted suicide through Dignitas for an inoperable tumour which most likely would have caused paralysis later on in its development. This situation reignited the debate revolving around the morality of assisted suicides in certain dilemmas, and incited current stances concerning euthanasia. Former Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer said he would \\"attempt to reintroduce a bill that would allow assisted dying in the UK\\". The book Me Before You and the film adaptation of the same name discuss the organization as it serves a vital function in both the main plot and the characters' lives.

He founded the Ernabella mission station in the far north of South Australia. The Pitjantjatjara people gave him the honorific Tjilpi, meaning \\"respected old man\\". He and his wife Phyllis Duguid, also an Aboriginal rights campaigner as well as women's rights activist, led much of the work on improving the lives of Aboriginal people in South Australia in the mid-twentieth century. The Duguids' legacies include the Duguid Indigenous Endowment Fund at The Australian National University and the Biennial Duguid Memorial Lecture series (held in alternate years at the University of South Australia and Flinders University). Early life and education Charles Duguid was born at Eglinton Street in Saltcoats, Ayrshire,Scotlands People birth record 6 April 1884: 1884 DUGUID, CHARLES (Statutory Births 576/01 0042) the son of Charles Duguid, a teacher, and Jane Snodgrass Kinnier, daughter of Robert S. Kinnier, a surgeon,Scotlands People birth record: 1862 Kinnier, Jane Snodgrass (Statutory BirthS 576/01 0077) sister of Captain Douglas Reid Kinnier. He attended Ardrossan Academy, where his father was Headmaster between 1882 and 1889, and the High School in Glasgow, before studying medicine at the University of Glasgow, where he gained MA in 1905 and MBChB (Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery) in 1909. Early career After graduation, Duguid worked as a doctor in Glasgow, but in 1911 he signed on as ship's medical officer on a voyage to Australia and home again. He met his future wife, Irene Isabella Young, aboard, and they became engaged and decided to live in Australia. Back in Scotland, he worked amongst the very poor in mining villages, before emigrating to Australia in 1912, working his passage as medical officer once more. He and Irene married in Melbourne on 23 October 1912, then moved to Minyip, a small town in the Wimmera region of Victoria, where they lived before moving to Adelaide in 1914. In February 1917, during World War I, Duguid sailed for Egypt as a captain in the Royal Australian Army Medical Corps, as part of the First Australian Imperial Force. He first worked in the Middle East, treating casualties in the Australian Light Horse, and then on a hospital ship before leaving the service in October 1917. He wrote two books about his experiences, before returning to Scotland in 1919 for post-graduate study and to earn his surgical fellowship. Life and post-WWI career in Adelaide Upon return from Scotland, Duguid bought a house at Magill, a suburb east of Adelaide. He set up a GP practice and also worked as a surgeon at the Memorial Hospital, North Adelaide. He also became an active member of local branches of several organisations doing charitable work for ex-servicemen and -women, the Returned Sailors‚Äô and Soldiers‚Äô Imperial League of Australia (RSL), Legacy Australia and Toc H. The family, now with son Charles, moved to Britain for a while for Duguid to undertake further medical studies, but his first wife Irene died on the return journey. In 1927 he met Phyllis Evelyn Lade, through his connection to her mother, when he was serving as councillor (1922-1934) and she an English teacher at Presbyterian Girls College. They married in 1930 at the Methodist Church in the inner Adelaide suburb of Kent Town. Also in 1930, Duguid was elected a fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons. He had two children, Andrew and Rosemary, with Phyllis. In 1944, Phyllis fostered a six-year-old Aboriginal boy, Sydney James Cook, who had been enrolled at King's College, Adelaide. He lived with the family until 1950 when he was sent to Roper River in the Northern Territory in order to benefit by growing up in an Aboriginal community. Duguid retired from his surgical and general medical practice in 1956, but later developed an interest in geriatric medicine.  Aboriginal rights  The murder of a white man by Aboriginals at Landers Creek, in the former Territory of Central Australia (now the Northern Territory), leading to what became known as the Coniston massacre, when police shot 17 Aboriginal people during the course of the hunt for the murderer in 1928, sparked Duguid's interest in Aboriginal rights.National Library of Australia, MS 5068 - Papers of Charles Duguid (1884-1986) (See: http://www.nla.gov.au/ms/findaids/5068.html ) In 1934 he headed to Darwin, but missed his connection from Alice Springs after responding to a request to perform some emergency surgery there and stayed on for three weeks. He was appalled at the way Aboriginal people were treated there and by their poor living conditions. He visited Pastor Friedrich Albrecht and met Albert Namatjira, with whom he became friends, at Hermannsburg Mission. In 1937, Duguid helped to found Ernabella Mission in the Musgrave Ranges of South Australia. He lectured and spoke in the United Kingdom as well as Australia and New Zealand about the conditions of the Australian Aboriginal people.Duguid, Charles, The Aborigines of Australia: broadcasts and an address, Published by permission of the Australian Broadcasting Commission (South Australian Branch), Adelaide, 1946 (See: http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2433120 ) Duguid was active in several organisations concerned with the advancement of Aboriginal rights, such as the Council for Aboriginal Rights (CAR), which was founded at a meeting in Melbourne on 16 March 1951, addressed by Duguid,Sue Taffe, 'The Council for Aboriginal Rights (Victoria)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/essay/8/text29426, originally published 11 April 2014, accessed 5 July 2019. and the Association for the Protection of Native Races.Duguid, Charles, The Aborigines of Darwin and the tropic North: an investigation, Aborigines Advancement League, Adelaide, 1951 (See: http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2234750 ) He was also involved with the Anti-Slavery Society, which in 1909 merged with the Aborigines' Protection Society. In addition to these, he had some involvement with the organisations described below. He and his wife Phyllis led much of the work to improve the status of Aboriginal people in South Australia during the mid-twentieth century. Aborigines Protection Board  Duguid was appointed a founding member of the South Australian Government's Aborigines Protection Board in 1940, after the Aborigines Act Amendment Act 1939 created this entity, which was \\"charged with the duty of controlling and promoting the welfare\\" of Aboriginal people (which included anyone descended from an Aboriginal person). \\"It replaced the office of the Chief Protector of Aborigines and the Advisory Council of Aborigines, and took over the role of legal guardianship of all Aboriginal children\\". Other board members included J. B. Cleland and Constance Cooke. As part of his duties, Duguid inspected Aboriginal reserves throughout the State, noting abuses against Aboriginal people on pastoral properties and discrimination in education. He and Phyllis, with their two children and their fostered Aboriginal son, Sydney James Cook, visited Ernabella in 1946. Soon afterwards they heard of the British proposal to test guided weapons over South Australia from a base to be built at Woomera in the Central Australian Desert. Concerned about the impact of the rocket range on the inhabitants of the Central Australian reserves, Duguid criticised the scheme at public meetings in Adelaide and, with Donald Thomson, in Melbourne led the 1947 campaign against the rocket-testing program. He worked hard to inform the public of the harmful effect that this program would have on those people still living traditionally nearby. Duguid resigned from the Aborigines Protection Board when it approved the proposal, but as a result of the protests a patrol officer, Walter MacDougall, was appointed at Woomera. His resignation made world headlines. The Aborigines Protection Board promoted assimilation, but by the 1950s, human rights ideas had changed, and in 1963 the Aboriginal Affairs Advisory Board, which focused on attaining full citizenship, was created as a replacement body. Aborigines' Protection League In 1925, Joseph Charles Genders, a wealthy accountant and publisher, proposed the idea of a \\"Model Aboriginal State\\" in Northern Territory, and formed the Aborigines' Protection League to give support to his idea after failing to garner support from the Aborigines' Friends' Association. His idea was sparked by his dismay at seeing the poor conditions in which Aboriginal people lived at Point McLeay, a small community south of Adelaide not far from the mouth of the River Murray. He garnered some support and submitted a petition to Prime Minister Stanley Melbourne Bruce, who delegated an investigation by Queensland's Protector of Aborigines, J.W. Bleakley. Bleakley rejected the proposal, supporting instead the establishment of an Aboriginal reserve in Arnhem Land, in the north-eastern corner of the Northern Territory. By the early 1930s, few supported the Aboriginal State proposal, and in 1935 Duguid was elected president of the League, remaining in the position until 1946. The League under Duguid's leadership continued to emphasise the ability and rights of Aboriginal people to govern themselves and retain their culture, and it was during this time that he established Ernabella mission on the edge of the Central Aborigines Reserve. The mission stressed respect for Indigenous culture, and the League supported it through the 1930s. However, by 1939, the League's original members had reduced in number, mostly due to old age and death, and Duguid and honorary secretary E.R. Edwards carried on alone. Despite a surge of support at a meeting in Adelaide Town Hall after their return from a visit to the mission, resulting in new members, World War II intervened as a higher priority. Aborigines' Advancement League of South Australia In 1938, Sydney activists Jack Patten and others were staging protests in Sydney. In Adelaide, a group of non-Aboriginal women representing other organisations, initiated and presided over by Phyllis Duguid, formed a new association, the League for the Protection and Advancement of Aboriginal and Half-caste Women. When the Aborigines' Protection League disbanded in 1946, it donated its remaining funds to the women's organisation, which then opened membership to men and became known as the Aborigines' Advancement League of South Australia (AALSA), or possibly just Aborigines' Advancement League (AAL), in 1950. Duguid was president from 1951 to 1961 (and Phyllis held this role from 1966-1971). Under his presidency the AALSA became a platform for Aboriginal voices. People like Lowitja O'Donoghue and other former Colebrook Home residents joined the League in the early 1950s, to fight for entry into professions such as teaching and nursing for the women, and apprenticeships for the men. O'Donaghue, Grace Lester, Muriel Brumbie and Faith Coulthard had all applied to train as nurses at the Royal Adelaide Hospital and been turned down. Duguid was outraged, and this and the need for a hostel to house Aboriginal people in the city drove the public meeting which he arranged in the Adelaide Town Hall on 31 August 1953, which was addressed by five Aboriginal people (George Rankin, Mona Paul, Peter Tilmouth, Ivy Mitchell, and Geoff Barnes) speaking of their personal experiences of discrimination. The meeting resulted in a great increase in membership of the League and a big boost in funds for the hostel. AALSA, led by the Duguids, was responsible organising a petition to change the SA Police Offences Act 1953, resulting in a repeal of the \\"consorting clause\\", which made it an offence for a non-Aboriginal person to \\"habitually consort\\" with an Aboriginal person, in 1958. In the wake of the 1967 referendum, Aboriginal people increasingly took control of their own affairs. In Victoria, non-Aboriginal members of the Victorian Aborigines Advancement League had to resign in 1969. A 1974 seminar run by the AALSA on the question \\"Do Aborigines need White help?\\" produced a range of views. In 1998, the AALSA Committee said in the newsletter that the Society, dating back to the time of Duguid, had always had a strong commitment to education and human rights for Aboriginal people, and that it would continue in this tradition, focusing on land rights, language maintenance and for recognition and respect for Aboriginal culture as a \\"vital component of Australian society\\". The organisation continued until 2008. According to the Trove catalogue entry for the State Library of South Australia (SLSA) holdings, \\"The original 1949 constitution named the League as 'Aborigines Advancement League'. A new constitution was drafted in the 1990s and the name was changed to 'Aboriginal Advancement League' \\". Minutes of the Aborigines Advancement League from 1950‚Äì2008 exist in the SLSA, and there is a typescript entitled History of the Aborigines Advancement League of South Australia by Phyllis Duguid, dated 1969. The AALSA published a Newsletter from 1959 to at least 1978; from 1997 to 2008, the publication was given the name Advancement. Note about names The Libraries Australia authority record for the organisation gives this information: \\"Formed in 1953, the Aborigines Advancement League of South Australia (also known as the Aborigines Advancement League Inc. S.A. and often referred to as the Aboriginal Advancement League of South Australia) was deregistered as a company in 1995. It was revived by 1998 as the Aborigines Advancement League South Australia, which by 2001 had changed its name to Aboriginal Advancement League South Australia which was incorporated on 15 Apr. 2002.\\". Wiltja One outcome of the meeting in the Town Hall was the establishment of the Wiltja Hostel in November 1956, at 17 East Avenue in the Adelaide suburb of Millswood. (Wiltja is a Pitjantjatjara word for a type of open shelter, built for protection from the sun.) Also known as the Aborigines Advancement League Hostel and the Millswood Girls' Home, it provided accommodation for Aboriginal girls who were attending secondary school in Adelaide, and often for a year beyond school, until 1978. From 1978 to 1980 it became a boarding house for adult Aboriginal visitors to the city, after which it was leased to and later purchase by the Education Department. Federal Council for Aboriginal Advancement On 13 February 1958, a conference was held in Willard Hall, in Wakefield Street, Adelaide, attended by 12 delegates from nine Aboriginal rights and welfare leagues and 12 observers, hosted by the AALSA. The meeting culminated in the foundation of the Federal Council for Aboriginal Advancement, designed to unite existing lobby groups, with a goal to help \\"the Aboriginal people of Australia to become self-reliant, self-supporting members of the community\\". This was the first national body representing Aboriginal interests. Duguid, one of the oldest members and then president of AALSA, was elected as the first president. Only groups which had \\"earned themselves the right to be considered seriously as organisations fighting on behalf of Aborigines\\" and some newer groups which had proven worthy were invited. Different lobby groups focused on different aspects of Aboriginal welfare or rights and members varied in composition, but they all desired to effect change. It was hard to measure success, but all contributed to changing public opinion to an acceptance that Aboriginal people deserved rights. It was a significant milestone to bring together the disparate groups under an umbrella organisation; however, AALSA sought to disaffiliate from about 1959, achieving this in 1966, because it thought the federal organisation too focused on the state of Victoria. So most of the work continued to be undertaken by South Australian groups, many of them led by the Duguids. Aborigines Progress Association The Aborigines Progress Association was a breakaway group from AALSA, formed by Laurie Bryan, a non-Aboriginal man who wanted to form an \\"all-Aboriginal\\" group, in 1964. O'Donaghue reported that she and others, including Gladys Elphick, joined the new group because they felt the need for an all-Aboriginal group, but without any ill-feeling towards the League or Duguid. The group broke up in the 1970s, its members helping to establish the Aboriginal Cultural Centre. Council of Aboriginal Women of South Australia In 1966, after Elphick clashed with Bryant and others became disillusioned with the Progress Association (which they said was run mainly by white people), she and a group of Aboriginal women broke away and formed the Council of Aboriginal Women of South Australia. The Council worked closely with and received substantial support from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. After the disbandment of the APA, the Aboriginal Cultural Centre amalgamated with CAWSA, with Elphick as first president of the ACC, which still continues as Numkuwarrin Yunti of South Australia. Other activities  Duguid helped to found the Australian branch of the English-Speaking Union, and was Chairman from 1932‚Äì1935. In 1935, he was elected first lay Moderator of the Presbyterian Church of South Australia. In December 1935, the Duguids hosted 34 children over 6 weeks from the Colebrook Home in Quorn, at their home. From 1943 Duguid was a member, along with K. S. Isles, G. V. Portus and others, of Common Cause, a think tank contemplating the shape of a post-war society. He acted as president from c.1946‚Äì1948. From 1944 to 1960, he was president of the District and Bush Nursing Society of South Australia. In 1948, he helped care for the sick during a measles epidemic at Ernabella in 1948. He was also involved in some way with the following organisations at different times: * Australian Student Christian Movement * United Nations Association of Australia * National Union of Australian University Students * Australian Inland Mission * Australian Aerial Medical Service (later known as the Flying Doctor) * Alice Springs Army Native Labour Unit * Fullarton Girls Home (run by the Salvation Army) Death, honours, legacy In April 1984, on his 100th birthday, the Ernabella choir made a special trip to come and sing for him in Adelaide. Duguid died on 5 December 1986 at Kent Town, Adelaide, at the age of 102. He was buried at Ernabella. A plaque honouring Duguid was laid in the Jubilee 150 Walkway in North Terrace, Adelaide. Awards *In 1971, Duguid was awarded the OBE for his work with Aboriginal people. *In 1972, he received a letter from the people at Ernabella requesting that after his death, his body be buried at the mission, so that they would \\"always remember that he was one of us and that he faithfully helped us\\". He considered this his greatest honour. The Pitjantjatjara people gave him the name Tjilpi, meaning \\"respected old man\\". *In 1974 he received the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award, an American award honouring written works that make important contributions to the understanding of racism, for his autobiography Doctor and the Aborigines. Legacy *His thinking influenced the thinking of two state premiers, Don Dunstan and David Tonkin, eventually leading to the unprecedented return to the Pitjantjatjara people of some of their ancient tribal lands, with the creation of A·πâangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY lands) in 1981. *The Duguid Indigenous Endowment Fund was created at the Australian National University by Rosemary and Bob Douglas (the Duguids' daughter and son-in-law) and Dr Andrew Duguid (their son). *The Duguid Travelling Scholarship is enabled by an endowment made in 2002 to the ANU's Endowment for Excellence by Andrew Duguid and Rosemary Douglas in recognition of their parents' contribution. *In 1994, the AALSA made a large donation to the University of South Australia and Flinders University, to provide study grants for Aboriginal graduates and to conduct a memorial lecture every two years. The Biennial Duguid Memorial Lecture (held alternate years at the University of South Australia and Flinders University) is held in honour of Charles and Phyllis Duguid.

He was the son of Francis Pope and Jane Dod, daughter of the Puritan minister John Dod. He was born in Northamptonshire and was the half brother of John Wilkins, who would become bishop of Chester and one of the founders of the Royal Society. He was educated at Wadham College, Oxford, with a BA in 1649, MA in 1651. Until the Restoration, he worked in Wadham College. In 1660, he became the professor of astronomy at Gresham College in London, taking over for Sir Christopher Wren, and he was also appointed Dean of Wadham College. He became one of the earliest members of the Royal Society, and he was also made the registrar of the diocese of Chester. During the 1660s, he was active in the Royal Society, with two letters published in Philosophical Transactions in 1665 and 1666. He traveled to France and Italy and reported for the Royal Society from Italy. In 1686, he developed a severe eye infection, and he resigned his teaching post in 1687. In 1693, his collection of books burned. Anthony √† Wood wrote of Pope as a libertine, and he published collections of poetry and translations in 1698, but others regarded him as pious and devout. He died in 1714 and left his money and belongings to a woman named Anne Shargold, who had cared for him in his illness. He was buried in St. Giles, Cripplegate. References *Clerke, A.

In 1986, sensing rock music's potential for popular intercoding, Fisher launched the multimedia rock band, Nerve Circle, in Boston, MA. In 1988 Nerve Circle's raucous, interactive production, \\"Evolution of the Grid,\\" was shut down by the police leading to his eviction from his loft.Jennifer Dalton, \\"Ebon Fisher's AlulA Dimension,\\" Performing Arts Journal, Johns Hopkins University Press, January 1998, p. 62 This precipitated a move to Brooklyn in 1988. Fisher's experimental media rituals in the 1990s helped to build vital channels of communication in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Fisher was one of the co-founders of a neighborhood-oriented arts movement called The Immersionists which included groups like Lalalandia, Fakeshop, The Pedestrian Project and large, interactive warehouse events like The Cat's Head, The Flytrap and Organism.\\"The Sex Salon & the Web Jam: Rediscovering the Value of Social Ritual,\\" by Ebon Fisher, Utne Reader, Jan-Feb, 1995 The emergence of such street and warehouse culture in the early 1990s helped Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to grow into a landmark arts district. Fisher's Immersionist works included the media-sharing gatherings at Minor Injury Gallery, Media Compressions, a phone-in community bulletin board, (718) SUBWIRE, an open, Anglo-Latino creative space situated in a traditional street festival, The Weird Thing ZoneMark Rose, \\"Brooklyn Unbound,\\" New York Press, March 6‚Äì12, 1991, p. 10 and the collectively defined philosophy, Wigglism.Frank Popper, \\"Ebon Fisher,\\" Contemporary Artists, Ed. by Sara and Tom Pendergast, St. James Press, 2002 According to Domus Magazine, Fisher's bionic ritual, the Web Jam of 1993, and the large, collaborative warehouse event it catalyzed called Organism, became a \\"symbolic climax\\" to the emerging Williamsburg art scene.Suzan Wines, \\"Go with the Flow: Eight New York Based Artists and Architects in the Digital Era,\\" Domus, February 1998, p. 84 Newsweek dubbed the Web Jam a \\"sequel to the rave.\\"Melissa Rossi, \\"Where Do We Go After the Rave?\\" Newsweek, July 26, 1993, p. 58 Stemming from his media rituals Fisher developed a network-based system of ethics called Bionic Codes.

Parker, \\"Nervepool,\\" The Courier, Waterloo & Cedar Falls, Iowa, January 15, 2006 Fisher received an M.S. in visual studies from MIT in 1986 following a BFA from Carnegie-Mellon University in 1982. In 1998 he was invited by the University of Iowa to create a new digital art program, \\"Digital Worlds,\\" which he directed for three years before being invited to teach at Hunter College in New York in 2001. He has lectured at numerous colleges and universities, including New York University, Sarah Lawrence College, Bennington College, the University of Washington and Columbia University. He has written on media and the arts for Art Byte, the Utne Reader, Digital Creativity, the Walker Arts Center and the New York Council for the Arts.

He formally invited the public to contribute to its evolution, establishing Wigglism as one of the first intentionally open source systems of philosophy.Ebon Fisher, \\"Wigglism,\\" Leonardo Journal, Vol. 40, Number I, 2007 From its inception Wigglism has promoted the notion that the truth, or that which seems true, is interactively constructed with the world as a whole, not just with other humans or in the limited text space known as discourse. As dialogues surrounding the evolving manifesto have suggested, the most significant property of an interactively determined truth is not its veracity but the vitality in the collaboration in which it emerges. Wigglism also points to a post-art, post-science, post-human world in which both objective reality and subjective aesthetics give way to a living, subjective ecosystem. This supports an emerging green culture underscored by an ethic of nurturing vital systems. Current work Ebon Fisher is continuing to cultivate The Nervepool and its system of network ethics, the Zoacodes. A retrospective of his works was presented at the University of Northern Iowa in 2005 and he was invited to be the 2005 Marjorie Rankin Scholar-in-Residence at Drexel University. He collaborated with NPR commentator, Andrei Codrescu, on the creation of a new Zoacode, \\"Signal Strangely,\\" which reflected Codrescu's stormlike travel patterns as he sought support for the survivors of Hurricane Katrina (2006). Fisher was interviewed extensively in a documentary by Marcin Ramocki, Brooklyn DIY, which premiered at the Museum of Modern Art in 2009. In that same year, Fisher was a keynote speaker at the IT Revolutions conference in Venice, Italy, sponsored by the IEEE. In 2006, he was invited by digital artists, Joseph Nechvatal and Julie Harrison, to teach the media arts as an Affiliate Professor at the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey and to help in the development of a new interdisciplinary studio area called Art & Technology. Fisher designed a green screen video production studio for the program, taught 3D animation and transmedia courses and received, along with co-author, Prof. Quynh Dinh, a National Science Foundation grant for a \\"Transmedia Search Engine\\" (Award # IIS-0742440, $150,000, 2007-2009). This was the largest research grant the arts and humanities had received at Stevens. Despite rapid growth of student enrollment and outside accreditation, Harrison and Fisher's Art & Technology program, along with their positions, were dismantled in 2009-10 during a period of financial contraction at the Institute. An investigation by the Attorney General of NJ into the management practices of Stevens' president, and other leaders of the Institute, lead to Stevens' president stepping down and a front-page story in The New York Times.\\"New Jersey College Is Beset by Accusations\\", by Sam Dillon, December 21, 2009, The New York Times An editorial on the story appeared in the same paper a week later \\"The Stevens Scandal\\", December 27, 2009, The New York Times and the story was picked up by The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News.\\"New Jersey Sues Stevens Institute of Technology\\", by John Hechinger, September 17, 2009, The Wall Street Journal\\"Stevens Institute, Officers Sued by New Jersey for Mismanaging\\", by David Voreacos, September 18, 2009, Bloomberg News Fisher was immediately invited to courses in the media arts at De Paul University in Chicago where he began work in the University pool on a short pilot video related to his Nervepool project. The following year the Moore College of Art and Design in Philadelphia invited Fisher to teach classes in 3D animation and advanced digital media and to help Moore develop a new media arts program. In December, 2012, Fisher gave a talk at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vilnius, Lithuania, sponsored by TEDx Vilnius and later that spring was invited to be an adjunct professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey.

It is distributed in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland and broadcasts many American and British imported television series as well as original programming. It launched on 15 January 2007 replacing former music channel VIVA Plus. Prior to its launch, Viacom had Nick Comedy, which was a timeshared channel with Nickelodeon Germany, airing from 9:15pm to 6:00am. From 15 December 2008 ‚Äì 31 December 2018 Comedy Central Germany ceased broadcasting 24 hours a day and started timesharing its slot with Nickelodeon Germany first then later VIVA Germany, running from 8:15pm to 5:45am. However, after VIVA ceased on 31 December 2018 at 14:00 Comedy Central returned to broadcast 24 hours a day. On 1 October 2011, Comedy Central Germany was rebranded, using the American new logo and graphic packages.  History  Comedy Central Germany was licensed by the Media Authority of North Rhine-Westphalia (LfM), which is also the supervising State media authority for the channel. On 24 November 2006, the license of VIVA Plus was changed to Comedy Central. Due to this, it got a license valid until 20 March 2010. Viacom initially tried to establish the channel independently as a 24-hour network. On 15 December 2008, however, Comedy Central started to timeshare its frequency with Nickelodeon and therefore reduced its broadcast time to 9:30 hours, from 8:15pm until 5:45am. Viacom previously launched a comedy timeshared channel using that same timeslot named Nick Comedy, which lasted from 2005 to 2006. It was shut down in favour of Comedy Central Germany. On 1 March 2010, Comedy Central Germany switched its aspect ratio to 16:9 and began airing its programming schedule in widescreen. From 1 October 2014, Comedy Central Germany shared air-time with VIVA Germany, due to launch of NickNight, late night block equivalent to American Nick@Nite until 31 December 2018 when VIVA ceased with Comedy Central finally broadcasting 24/7.  Austrian subfeed  An Austrian subfeed of the channel was launched on 1 January 2011. The programming is the same as the German main feed with the exception of airing local advertisements. It replaced VIVA Austria's timeslot on Nickelodeon Austria as a timeshared channel, following the shut down of MTV Austria. Due to VIVA closing, Comedy Central became a 24-hour channel.  Swiss subfeed  In Switzerland, a localised subfeed was launched on 16 May 2011. The Swiss subfeed differs from the main feed on having less on-air time, ending its broadcast at 5:00am in favour of Nickelodeon Switzerland. Like in Austria, Comedy Central replaced VIVA Switzerland, which had its programming moved to MTV Switzerland in the following months. Nevertheless, Viacom announced on 28 September 2012 that VIVA Switzerland would be launched again on 1 October as a full, 24-hour channel. Due to VIVA closing, Comedy Central became a 24-hour channel.  High-definition feed  Logo of Comedy Central HD Since 16 May 2011, Viacom launched Comedy Central HD, which was picked up by Telekom and Vodafone TV. Later, on 11 June 2011, HD+ by Astra starts offering the channel on its satellite line up.

Prelude In 1675 Montecuccoli and Turenne had been manoeuvering between Philippsburg and Strassburg for an advantage, each seeking to cover his own country and to live upon that of the enemy. At last Turenne prevailed and had the Imperialists at a disadvantage on the Sasbach, where, in opening the action, he was killed by a cannon-shot (27 July). Devastated by the loss of their commander, the French hastily surrendered all their advantages, and Montecucculi sharply following up their retreat, and drove them over the Rhine and almost to the Vosges. At the same time the Imperial forces under Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine were besieging Trier, which Turenne had taken in the autumn of 1673. The battle Cr√©quy was sent with 15,000 men and 11 guns to relieve the city. They were stopped at the bridge over the Saar River at Konz. The Imperialists sent a force under Ottone Enrico Del Carretto, marquis of Grana, to occupy what is today known as the Grana-heights. Another force crossed the bridge at Konz and a third force crossed the river over a pontoon bridge. They attacked the French camp and an indecisive battle raged for three hours. Then Otto de Grana engaged his right flank on the right moment and the French fled the battlefield, leaving behind all their guns and wagons. The Germans pursued the French over 50 kilometers. Cr√©quy made his way into Trier to assume command, but was forced to surrender on 9 September. On the battlefield a Grana-memorial was erected in 1892 under Wilhelm II, not honouring Otto de Grana, but glorifying unified Germany.

He later became a minor league manager. Born in Gadsden, Alabama, Freeman threw and batted right-handed; he stood tall and weighed . After attending the University of Alabama, Freeman signed with the Red Sox in 1948, and spent five seasons in their farm system before his recall in September 1952. Even though he had pitched exclusively in relief for the Triple-A Louisville Colonels, Freeman was given a starting assignment in his fourth MLB appearance on September 26, 1952. Facing the Washington Senators at Fenway Park, Freeman hurled a complete game, 3‚Äì1 victory, allowing only four Washington hits. It was Freeman's only complete game in the Majors. He failed to stick with the Red Sox, however, spending most of 1953 and all of 1954 with Louisville. After only two appearances in relief for the 1955 Red Sox, he was placed on waivers at the May cutdown and claimed by the Redlegs. When Cincinnati manager Birdie Tebbetts asked Freeman why the Red Sox waived him, Freeman said Boston had not given him the pitching workload he needed to be effective. \\"Brother\\", Tebbetts replied, \\"you came to the right place.\\" Tebbetts then used Freeman in relief for 54, 64 and 52 games during the seasons of 1955 through 1957, and Freeman responded by compiling a won‚Äìlost record of 28‚Äì11 with the Redlegs, with 37 saves and an earned run average of 3.33. In , he was second in the National League in games pitched, and led the NL in games finished, as Cincinnati finished third in the standings, only two games behind the pennant-winning Brooklyn Dodgers. Freeman finished 13th in the balloting for NL Most Valuable Player that season. In 1957 he allowed 14 home runs in 83 innings pitched and saw his ERA jump to 4.52. In early 1958, he was swapped to the Cubs for a fellow reliever, Turk Lown, and made only nine appearances with Chicago before being sent to the minor leagues in June. All told, Freeman worked in 359 innings in the Majors, allowing 387 hits and 109 bases on balls. He struck out 158; his 37 career saves all came as a member of the Redlegs. He also handled 82 total chances (19 putouts, 63 assists) without an error for a perfect 1.000 fielding percentage. Freeman stayed in baseball as a Cincinnati scout in 1960 and from 1961 to 1963 he managed in the mid- to lower-level minor leagues in the Reds' farm system.

Iran is an important trade partner of Georgia. Context Eastern Georgia, throughout its history, has several times been annexed by the Persian Empire, specifically under the Achaemenid, Parthian, Sassanid, Safavid, Afsharid and Qajar dynasties. Western Georgia, throughout its history had been annexed by the Persian Achaemenids and briefly came under Sassanid control during the Lazic War. Due to this, there has been a lot of political and cultural exchange between the two nations for thousands of years, and thus Eastern Georgia was considered a part of Greater Iran. Historical relations Iran (Persia) and Georgia, or the Georgian tribes, have had relations in different forms mainly through trade starting from the Median era. From the early Achaemenid era, relations developed, as the Achaemenids conquered many of the Georgian regions. The relationship got more complex as the Safavids took power in Iran and established century long Iranian control of several of the Georgian kingdoms. This continued until Russia conquered the Caucasus and Georgia in the first half of the 19th century, through the Russo- Persian War (1804-1813) and the Russo-Persian War (1826-1828), from Qajar Iran.Timothy C. Dowling Russia at War: From the Mongol Conquest to Afghanistan, Chechnya, and Beyond pp 728-729 ABC-CLIO, 2 dec. 2014 20th century Until the early 1990s, Iran-Georgia relations were merged into Iran- Soviet relations. Since Georgia's independence from the Soviet Union, the two nations have cooperated in many fields including energy, transport, trade, education, and science. Iran is one of Georgia's most important trading partners and an Intergovernmental Joint Economic Commission is functioning between the two countries. 2008 Russia‚ÄìGeorgia conflict Due to its close relations with both Russia and Georgia, Iran at first attempted to remain relatively neutral throughout the war and beyond. The Foreign Minister of Iran Manouchehr Mottaki deemed a new cold war possible and predicted that external powers would suffer as the US and its allies had done in Afghanistan and Iraq.Iran warns US over Caucasus crisis Foreign Ministry spokesman Hassan Ghashghavi called \\"for an immediate halt to the clashes\\" and offer to help.Iran Offers 'Any Help' In South Ossetia Crisis After Russia and its closest allies chose to recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the Ambassador of Iran to Russia, Seyed Mahmoud-Reza Sajjadi, said in early February 2009 that his nation will not recognise Abkhazia and South Ossetia's independence in the near future, \\"as it can cause war in many areas,\\" but on the other hand he did not rule out eventual Iranian recognition of the independence of the two areas. However, Sajjadi defended Russia's measures in the 2008 South Ossetia war and its decision to recognise Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent nations. Sajjadi also said he sympathised with the people of Abkhazia and South Ossetia and that Tehran will work with Moscow to develop the two areas' economy. 2010 to present The beginning of 2010 saw increasing cooperation between the two countries. Agents from Iran's foreign ministry visited Tbilisi in May 2010 to discuss Iranian investment in the construction of a hydroelectric plant in Georgia as well as Iran's intentions to import electricity from the country.http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-05-21/iran-plans-georgian-hydro- plant-seeks-to-import-electricity.html The meeting led to president Mikheil Saakashvili inviting his Iranian counterpart Mahmood Ahmadinejad to Tbilisi. Over the past decade, Tehran has also assigned agreements with Tblisi for elimination of double taxation and encouraging investment in air, surface, and sea transport, and customs and trade cooperation. Seeking to diversify transit routes for its cargo shipments, Iran has an interest in Georgia's transit capacity and considers the country to be a viable alternative route for shipping freight to Europe. It is expected In late May 2010 Iranian ambassador Majid Samadzade Saber announced that Iran and Georgia intend to lift visa restrictions for travel between the countries, which officially came in force in January 2011. According to the Iranian Ambassador, Iran and Georgia are holding talks on opening an Iranian consulate in Batumi, western Georgia.\\"panorama.am\\" The announcement was scheduled during Iranian foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki's visit to Tbilisi scheduled later in the month. During a meeting with new Georgian Ambassador to Iran Ioseb Chakhvashvili in Tehran in April 2014, Zarif said Iran and Georgia enjoy historical and friendly relations. The Iranian foreign minister added that there are many capacities for the expansion of Tehran-Tbilisi ties, particularly in the economic and parliamentary spheres. Chakhvashvili, for his part, pointed to cordial Iran-Georgia ties and the ample grounds for closer cooperation between the two countries. In November 18, 2013, Georgian President Giorgi Margvelashvili said his administration would strive to strengthen Tbilisi- Tehran friendship bonds. In a meeting with Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Asia-Pacific and Commonwealth Affairs Ebrahim Rahimpour in Tbilisi, Margvelashvili described cordial ties between the two countries as rooted in history and strong. Georgia has reacted positively on the outcome between Iran and the P5+1 states about the relief of sanctions on Iran, in turn for regulations of Iran's nuclear program. As close geographical countries and being important trade partners, parliamentarians of both nations foresee an increase in bilateral relations between the nations. On March 18, 2015, the 5th Summit of Iran-Georgia Joint Commission on Economic Cooperation was held in the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs of Iran.

Originally located at Theodore Francis Green Airport in Warwick, Rhode Island, the 143 AW relocated to the former Naval Air Station Quonset Point in the mid-1980s, with the base initially consisting of 79 acres of leased land. By July 2001 the base had an additional lease for approximately 15 acres used for the development of their master plan and will allow for construction of facilities to support new C-130J transport aircraft. There are a total of 12 facilities on base: 4 industrial, 6 administrative and 2 services with no family housing. Current base population is approximately 360 personnel during non-drill duty days and increases to approximately 599 personnel on a drill duty weekend, otherwise known as a Unit Training Assembly (UTA), that occurs once per month. In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, the DoD would realign Martin State Air National Guard Base (aka Warfield Air National Guard Base), Maryland. The DoD recommended to distribute the eight C-130J aircraft of the 175th Wing (ANG) to the 146th Airlift Wing (ANG), Channel Islands Air National Guard Station, California (four aircraft), and the 143d Airlift Wing (ANG), Quonset State Airport Air National Guard Station, Rhode Island (four aircraft). This recommendation would move C-130Js to Channel Islands ANGS (96), and Quonset State ANGS (125), both of which ranked higher in military value and already operate the J-model C-130, avoiding conversion training costs.

Although a member of the Triple Alliance, Italy did not join the Central Powers ‚Äì Germany and Austria-Hungary ‚Äì when the war started on 28 July 1914. In fact, those two countries had taken the offensive while the Triple Alliance was supposed to be a defensive alliance. Moreover the Triple Alliance recognized that both Italy and Austria-Hungary were interested in the Balkans and required both to consult each other before changing the status quo and to provide compensation for whatever advantage in that area: Austria-Hungary did consult Germany but not Italy before issuing the ultimatum to Serbia, and refused any compensation before the end of the war. Almost a year after the war's commencement, after secret parallel negotiations with both sides (with the Allies in which Italy negotiated for territory if victorious, and with the Central Powers to gain territory if neutral) Italy entered the war on the side of the Allied Powers. Italy began to fight against Austria-Hungary along the northern border, including high up in the now-Italian Alps with very cold winters and along the Isonzo river. The Italian army repeatedly attacked and, despite winning a majority of the battles, suffered heavy losses and made little progress as the mountainous terrain favoured the defender. Italy was then forced to retreat in 1917 by a German-Austrian counteroffensive at the Battle of Caporetto after Russia left the war allowing the Central Powers to move reinforcements to the Italian Front from the Eastern Front. The offensive of the Central powers was stopped by Italy at the Battle of Monte Grappa in November 1917 and the Battle of the Piave River in May 1918. Italy took part in the Second Battle of the Marne and the subsequent Hundred Days Offensive in the Western Front. On 24 October 1918 the Italians, despite being outnumbered, breached the Austrian line in Vittorio Veneto and caused the collapse of the centuries-old Habsburg Empire. Italy recovered the territory lost after the fighting at Caporetto in November the previous year and moved into Trento and South Tyrol. Fighting ended on 4 November 1918. Italian armed forces were also involved in the African theatre, the Balkan theatre, the Middle Eastern theatre and then took part in the Occupation of Constantinople. At the end of World War I, Italy was recognized with a permanent seat in the League of Nations' executive council along with Britain, France and Japan. Roy Pryce summarized the bitter experience: : The government's hope was that the war would be the culmination of Italy's struggle for national independence. Her new allies promised her the 'natural frontiers' which she had so long sought- the Trentino and Trieste-and something more. At the end of hostilities she did indeed extend her territory, but she came away from the peace conference dissatisfied with her reward for three and a half years' bitter warfare, having lost half a million of her noblest youth, with her economy impoverished and internal divisions more bitter than ever. That strife could not be resolved within the framework of the old parliamentary regime. The war that was to have been the climax of the Risorgimento produced the Fascist dictatorship. Something, somewhere, had gone wrong.Roy Pryce, \\"Italy and the Outbreak of the First World War.\\" Cambridge Historical Journal 11#2 (1954): 219-27 at p. 219. online. From neutrality to intervention A pro-war demonstration in Bologna, 1914 Italy was a member of the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary. Despite this, in the years before the war, Italy had enhanced its diplomatic relationships with the United Kingdom and France. This was because the Italian government had grown convinced that support of Austria (the traditional enemy of Italy during the 19th century Risorgimento) would not gain Italy the territories it wanted: Trieste, Istria, Zara and Dalmatia, all Austrian possessions. In fact, a secret agreement signed with France in 1902 sharply conflicted with Italy's membership in the Triple Alliance. A few days after the outbreak of the war, on 3 August 1914, the government, led by the conservative Antonio Salandra, declared that Italy would not commit its troops, maintaining that the Triple Alliance had only a defensive stance and Austria-Hungary had been the aggressor. Thereafter Salandra and the minister of Foreign Affairs, Sidney Sonnino, began to probe which side would grant the best reward for Italy's entrance in the war or its neutrality. Although the majority of the cabinet (including former Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti) was firmly against intervention, numerous intellectuals, including Socialists such as Ivanoe Bonomi, Leonida Bissolati, and, after 18 October 1914, Benito Mussolini, declared in favour of intervention, which was then mostly supported by the Nationalist and the Liberal parties. Pro-interventionist socialists believed that, once that weapons had been distributed to the people, they could have transformed the war into a revolution. The negotiation with Central Powers to keep Italy neutral failed: after victory Italy was to get Trentino but not the South Tyrol, part of the Austrian Littoral but not Trieste, maybe Tunisia but only after the end of the war while Italy wanted them immediately. The negotiation with the Allies led to the London Pact (26 April 1915), signed by Sonnino without the approval of the Italian Parliament. According to the Pact, after victory Italy was to get Trentino and the South Tyrol up to the Brenner Pass, the entire Austrian Littoral (with Trieste), Gorizia and Gradisca (Eastern Friuli) and Istria (but without Fiume), parts of western Carniola (Idrija and Ilirska Bistrica) and north-western Dalmatia with Zara and most of the islands, but without Split. Other agreements concerned the sovereignty of the port of Valona, the province of Antalya in Turkey and part of the German colonies in Africa. On 3 May 1915 Italy officially revoked the Triple Alliance. In the following days Giolitti and the neutralist majority of the Parliament opposed declaring war, while nationalist crowds demonstrated in public areas for it. (The nationalist poet Gabriele D'Annunzio called this period le radiose giornate di Maggio‚Äî\\"the sunny days of May\\"). Giolitti had the support of the majority of Italian parliament so on 13 May Salandra offered his resignation to King Victor Emmanuel III, but then Giolitti learned that the London Pact was already signed: fearful of a conflict between the Crown and the Parliament and the consequences on both internal stability and foreign relationships, Giolitti accepted the fait accompli, declined to succeed as prime minister and Salandra's resignation was not accepted. On 23 May, Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary. This was followed by declarations of war on the Ottoman Empire (21 August 1915, following an ultimatum of 3 August), Bulgaria (19 October 1915) and the German Empire (28 August 1916).United States Department of State, Declarations of War and Severances of Relations (1914‚Äì1918) (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1919). Italian Front Italian Front 1915‚Äì1917 Italian alpine troops, 1915 The front on the Austrian border was long, stretching from the Stelvio Pass to the Adriatic Sea. Italian forces were numerically superior but this advantage was negated by the difficult terrain. Further, the Italians lacked strategic and tactical leadership. The Italian commander-in-chief was Luigi Cadorna, a staunch proponent of the frontal assault whose tactics cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of Italian soldiers. His plan was to attack on the Isonzo front, with the dream of breaking over the Karst Plateau into the Carniolan Basin, taking Ljubljana and threatening the Austro-Hungarian Empire's capital Vienna. It was a Napoleonic plan, which had no realistic chance of success in an age of barbed wire, machine guns, and indirect artillery fire, combined with hilly and mountainous terrain. Opening shots The first shells were fired in the dawn of 24 May 1915 against the enemy positions of Cervignano del Friuli, which was captured a few hours later. On the same day the Austro-Hungarian fleet bombarded the railway stations of Manfredonia and Ancona. The first Italian casualty was Riccardo Di Giusto. The main effort was to be concentrated in the Isonzo and Vipava valleys and on the Kras plateau, in the direction of Ljubljana. The Italian troops had some initial successes, but as in the Western Front, the campaign soon evolved into trench warfare. The main difference was that the trenches had to be dug in the Alpine rocks and glaciers instead of in the mud, and often up to of altitude. In the first months of the war Italy launched the following offensives: * First Battle of the Isonzo (23 June ‚Äì 7 July) * Second Battle of the Isonzo (18 July ‚Äì 4 August) * Third Battle of the Isonzo (18 October ‚Äì 4 November) * Fourth Battle of the Isonzo (10 November) In these first four battles, the Italian Army registered 60,000 fatalities and more than 150,000 wounded, equivalent to around one fourth of the mobilized forces. The offensive in the upper Cadore, near the Col di Lana, though secondary, blocked large Austro-Hungarian contingents, since it menaced their main logistic lines in Tyrol. Italian offensives of 1916‚Äì1917 This stalemate dragged on for the whole of 1916. While the Austro-Hungarians amassed large forces in Trentino, the Italian command launched the Fifth Battle of the Isonzo, lasting for eight days from 11 March 1916. This attempt was also fruitless. In June the Austro-Hungarian counter-offensive (dubbed \\"Strafexpedition\\", \\"Punishment Expedition\\") broke through in Trentino and occupied the whole Altopiano di Asiago. The Italian Army managed however to contain the offensive and the enemy retreated in order to strengthen its position in the Carso. On 4 August began the Sixth Battle of the Isonzo which, five days later, led to the Italian conquest of Gorizia, at the cost of 20,000 dead and 50,000 wounded. The year ended with three new offensives: *Seventh Battle of the Isonzo (14‚Äì16 September) *Eighth Battle of the Isonzo (1 November) *Ninth Battle of the Isonzo (4 November) The price was a further 37,000 dead and 88,000 wounded for the Italians, again for no remarkable conquest. In late 1916, the Italian army advanced for some kilometers in Trentino, while, for the whole winter of 1916‚Äì1917, the situation in the Isonzo front remained stationary. In May and June was the Tenth Battle of the Isonzo. The Battle of Mount Ortigara (10‚Äì25 June) was Cadorna's attempt to conquer back some territories in Trentino which had remained under Austro- Hungarian control. On 18 August 1917 began the most important Italian offensive, the Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo. This time the Italian advance was initially successful as the Bainsizza Plateau southeast of Tolmino was captured, but the Italian army outran its artillery and supply lines, thus preventing the further advance that could have finally succeeded in breaking the Austro-Hungarian army. The Austro-Hungarian line ultimately held and the attack was abandoned on 12 September 1917. Austro-Hungarian offensives of 1917‚Äì1918 Map showing the Italian losses after the Caporetto breakthrough. Though the last Italian offensive had proven inconclusive, the Austrians were in strong need of reinforcements. These became available when Russia crumbled and troops from the Eastern front, the Trentino front and Flanders were secretly concentrated on the Isonzo front. On 24 October 1917, the Central Powers troops broke through the Italian lines in the upper Isonzo at Caporetto (the modern Kobarid) and routed the 2nd Italian Army. The Italian army commanders had been informed of a probable enemy attack, but had underestimated it and did not realize the danger posed by the infiltration tactics developed by Germans. From Caporetto the Austro-Hungarians advanced for south-west, reaching Udine after only four days. The defeat of Caporetto caused the disintegration of the whole Italian front of the Isonzo. The situation was re-established by forming a stop line on the Tagliamento and then on the Piave rivers, but at the price of 10,000 dead, 30,000 wounded, 265,000 prisoners, 300,000 stragglers, 50,000 deserters, over 3,000 artillery pieces, 3,000 machine guns and 1,700 mortars. The Austrian and German losses totaled 70,000. Cadorna, who had tried to attribute the causes of the disasters to low morale and cowardice among the troops, was relieved of duty. On 8 November 1917 he was replaced by Armando Diaz. The Central Powers ended the year 1917 with a general offensive on the Piave, the Altopiano di Asiago, and the Monte Grappa, which failed and the Italian front reverted to attritional trench warfare. The Italian army was forced to call the 1899 levy, while that of 1900 was left for a hypothetical final effort for the year of 1919. The Central Powers stopped their attacks in 1917 because German troops were needed on the Western Front while the Austro-Hungarian troops were exhausted and at the end of much longer logistical lines. The offensive was renewed on 15 June 1918 with Austro-Hungarian troops only in the Battle of Piave. The Italians resisted the assault. The failure of the offensive marked the swan song of Austria-Hungary on the Italian front. The Central Powers proved finally unable to sustain further the war effort, while the multi- ethnic entities of the Austrian Empire were on the verge of rebellion. The Italians rescheduled earlier their planned 1919 counter-offensive to October 1918, in order to take advantage of the Austro-Hungarian crisis. Italian victory Italian cavalry in Trento on 3 November 1918, after the victorious Battle of Vittorio Veneto Postcard sent from an Italian soldier to his family, c. 1917. The Italian attack of 52 Italian divisions, aided by a 3 British 2 French and 1 American division, 65,000 total, and Czechoslovaks, was started on 24 October from Vittorio Veneto. The Austro-Hungarians fought tenaciously for four days, but then the Italians managed to cross the Piave and establish a bridgehead, the Austro-Hungarians began to retreat and then to disintegrate after the troops heard of revolutions and independence proclamations in the lands of the Dual Monarchy. Austria asked for an armistice on 29 October. The armistice was signed on 3 November at Villa Giusti, near Padua. Italian soldiers entered Trento while Bersaglieri landed from the sea in Trieste. The following day the Istrian cities of Rovigno and Parenzo, the Dalmatian island of Lissa, and the Dalmatian cities of Zara and Fiume were occupied: the latter were not included in the territories originally promised secretly by the Allies to Italy in case of victory, but the Italians decided to intervene in reply to a local National Council, formed after the flight of the Hungarians, and which had announced the union to the Kingdom of Italy. In the meantime the Regia Marina occupied Pola and Sebenico, which became the capital of the Military Government of Dalmatia. It occupied also all Tyrol by the III Corps of the First Army with 20‚Äì22,000 soldiers. Other theaters Balkans Italian troops played a major role in the defence of Albania against Austria- Hungary. From 1916 the Italian 35th Division fought on the Salonika Front as part of the Allied Army of the Orient. The Italian XVI Corps (a separate entity independent from the Army of the Orient) took part in actions against Austro-Hungarian forces in Albania; in 1917 they established an Italian protectorate over Albania. Western Front Some Italian divisions were also sent to support the Entente on the Western Front. In 1918 Italian troops saw intense combat during the Spring Offensive. Their most prominent engagement on this front was their role in the Second Battle of the Marne. Middle East Italy played a token role in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign, sending a detachment of five hundred soldiers to assist the British there in 1917. As Italy entered the war on 23 May 1915, the situation of her forces in the African colonies was critical. Italian Somaliland, in the east was far from being pacified, and in North Africa's Cyrenaica the Italian forces were confined to some separated points on the coast. But in neighboring Tripolitania and Fezzan, the story has a different beginning. In August 1914, during their previous colonial invasion and occupation versus local military and forces of the Ottoman Empire, the Italian forces reached Ghat, that is, conquered most of western Libya. But in November 1914, this advance turned into a general retreat, and on 7 April and 28 April, they suffered two reverses at Wadi Marsit (near Mizda) and Gasr Bu Hadi (or al-Qurdabiya near Sirte) respectively. By August 1915, the situation in Tripolitania was similar to that of Cyrenaica. The conquest of all of Libya was not resumed until January 1922. Consequences The Redipuglia War Memorial. Italy's representative at the Paris Peace Conference, which led to the Versailles Treaty, was Premier Vittorio Emanuele Orlando. Orlando was considered one of the \\"Big Four\\" with Premier Georges Clemenceau of the French Republic, President Woodrow Wilson of the United States, and Prime Minister David Lloyd George of the United Kingdom. Italy received a bit of the land promised in The Treaty of London but not northern Dalmatia nor Fiume. The expectation to gain part of German colonies conquered by the Allies was also not realized. After long discussions the Italian diplomats left the Conference in protest but were forced to rejoin after the Allies refused to concede to all Italian demands and just went on. The territorial gains were perceived as small in comparison to the cost of the war for Italy. The debt contracted to pay for the war's expenses was finally paid back only in the 1970s. The uncertain socio-economic situation and the broken promises from Allied powers caused heavy social strife which led to the Biennio rosso and later the rise of Fascism and its leader Benito Mussolini.

He served as nuncio to several countries during his career, and was created a cardinal in 1962. Life Early life Panico was born in Tricase, in the Province of Lecce, to Carmine Panico and his wife Marina Zocco, a farming family. The sixth of eleven children, he was given the baptismal name was Santo Giovanni. After studying under a private tutor, he attended the minor seminary in Ugento. He then went to Rome, where he lived in the Leonine College, a residence for students from southern Italy at the Gregorian University (1910‚Äì1915), then studied at the Pontifical Roman Seminary (1915‚Äì1919). An accomplished musician on both the organ and the piano, he was the official organist for the seminary during his time there. Panico was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Basilio Pompili on 14 March 1919, in the Lateran Basilica. That summer he founded a boys choir and a separate girls choir for the children of Rome. He then attended the Pontifical Lateran University until 1922, obtaining a doctorate in theology in 1919, and later a doctorate in canon and civil law in 1922. Career Panico then did pastoral work in his home town from 1922 to 1923, and was raised to the rank of Privy Chamberlain of His Holiness on 25 August 1923. Invited by the Cardinal Secretary of State to join the papal diplomatic service, he was appointed the auditor of the nunciature for Argentina (1926‚Äì1931) and for Czechoslovakia (1931‚Äì1932) before becoming the charg√© d'affaires in Bavaria in 1932, and again in Czechoslovakia in 1933. During his time in Prague, he also contributed to the foundation of the University of Bratislava. He was created a Domestic Prelate of His Holiness on 20 August 1934, and later awarded the Legion of Honor by France. On 17 October 1935, Panico was appointed Apostolic Delegate to Australia and New Zealand (a post he held until 1948) and Titular Archbishop of Justiniana Prima by Pope Pius XI. He received his consecration on the following 8 December from Cardinal Pietro Fumasoni Biondi, with Archbishops Bartolomeo Cattaneo and Domenico Spolvorini serving as co- consecrators, in Rome. As Apostolic Delegate Panico believed that the time had arrived for the promotion of native-born priests as bishops for these countries, instead of Irish-born clergy. This was seen as a very controversial move in some quarters. According to one of the biographers of Archbishop Daniel Mannix, Niall Brennan, Panico was a prelate of \\"uncertain ability\\", and was known widely among the clergy of Australia as \\"Panicky Jack\\". Panico officiated at the Eucharistic Congress of 1938 which was held in Newcastle, New South Wales. He also presided over similar events in 1939 in Wellington, New Zealand, to mark the centenary of the Catholic Church in New Zealand (1838), and of the nation itself (the Treaty of Waitangi, 1840). During World War II, Panico established charities for Italian, German, and Japanese prisoners of war in Australia and for the Australian and New Zealand prisoners in Italy. In 1948, Panico opened Holy Name Seminary in Christchurch, New Zealand. He traveled to New Zealand with Jesuit priests who were to staff it. Their arrival in New Zealand was dramatic as their ship, MS Wanganella, went aground on Barrett Reef at the entrance to Wellington Harbour, and they had to be rescued. The Jesuits were playing poker in their cabin at the time the ship hit the reef. Panico rushed into the cabin in his nightshirt and asked what was happening. When one of the Jesuits informed him that they were going to sink, he apparently told them that he must die like a priest so he went and put on his biretta. This was further fuel to his nickname of \\"Panicky Jack\\". Panico was named nuncio to Peru on 28 September 1948, and Apostolic Delegate to Canada on 14 November 1953. Pope John XXIII appointed him nuncio to Portugal on 25 January 1959. Cardinal and last days In March 1962, having suffered from poor health for several years, he was transferred to the Roman Curia and was promoted to the rank of Cardinal Priest in the consistory of 19 March 1962, with the Basilica of Santa Teresa d'Avila as his titular church. He then founded the Cardinale Giovanni Panico Hospital in his native Tricase, where he soon died at age 67. Panico was originally buried in his family's plot in the town cemetery, but, in keeping with his request, his remains were later moved to the crypt of the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the same town. On 23 June 2012, his remains wree transferred to a tomb in front of the altar of St. Charles Borromeo in the main body of the church.

The manga was adapted by TV Asahi into a 27-episode anime television series from April 1 to September 30, 1972, directed by Yoshiyuki Tomino (in his directorial debut). Digital Manga successfully crowd-funded the U.S. release of the manga on Kickstarter in 2012. Plot 5000 years ago, the Triton clan lived in Atlantis until the Poseidon clan destroyed them all out of envy, leaving Triton the last survivor of his kind. The white dolphin Ruka took the orphaned Triton to the caves in coastal Japan to protect him from his enemies. Triton was taken in as a baby by the human boy, Kazuya Yasaki (Áü¢Â¥éÂíå‰πü). But Poseidon set off a huge tsunami that destroyed Kazuya's village and killed his father. Kazuya, his mother and Triton then moved to Tokyo. However, Kazuya was cheated out of his salary and in his anger committed murder. He becomes a fugitive and works on a ship that, unbeknown to Kazuya, delivers goods to Poseidon's base. As he grows older, Triton returns to the sea to take revenge on the Poseidon family. With his dolphin friends Ruka, Uru, Karu and Fin, he proceeds on a one-man war against the Poseidon family. During his journey, Triton meets Pipiko, the last surviving mermaid. Together, they work to stop Poseidon and his evil minions and get vengeance for their family. Triton kills all of Poseidon's 33 children one after another. Then he decides to go inside Poseidon's marine base to try to kill him. Supported by the human slaves working at the base, they almost succeeded, only to be betrayed by one of the slaves. During his battle with one of Poseidon's sons, Triton came to know Ganomosu, the big turtle who has lived for many years at sea and is very wise. Ganomosu advised Triton to live on a floating island which is his granddad's shell and is surrounded by seven whirlpools. Poseidon, who just managed to have another son with a sponge disguised as Pipiko, is unable to control this son, who is destroying everything in the sea. Triton and Poseidon came to a truce with turtle Ganomosu as witness, in which Triton will try to kill this monster provided Poseidon will not disturb the mermen and mermaids' peace anymore. Triton kills the monster by trapping it under the sun on dry land. Pipiko and Triton marry and Pipiko lays seven eggs. Three months later, two boys and five girls emerge. They are named after the colours of the rainbow: Blue Triton, Green Triton, Indigo Triton, Yellow Triton, Orange Triton, Red Triton, Violet Triton. Triton takes the children on an educational cruise around the seas on a yacht. It hits a storm and Green Triton is taken by humans. Triton goes on land to find her and he is drugged while Green Triton is taken to Tokyo. Triton and Blue Triton go to Tokyo to get Green back but the two are separated due to heavily polluted water. Triton, though, is met by Poseidon's general and is shown a piece of fake newspaper stating that Green Triton is dead. Blue Triton, with the help of humans, finds and is re-united with Green Triton. Meanwhile, Triton, out of anger, triggered huge tsunamis to hit Tokyo at Poseidon's suggestion. Poseidon's general then advises the Tokyo media that the tsunamis are set off by Triton. Triton finds Blue and Green Triton and realizes that he has been framed. As he tries to take his children back to sea he is shot. Kazuya and his friends finds Triton and together they exposes Poseidon's plan to frame Triton. Triton goes after Poseidon to end the matter once and for all. Beforehand he asks Blue Triton to lead the mermen family in his absence. Triton then goes to Ganomosu, the huge turtle, and the two go to Poseidon's base for a final battle. The battle ended with a huge explosion at the base, killing everyone except Ganomosu. Humans continue to hunt for mermaids and are led to the mermaid family's floating island by dolphins. Blue Triton then asks all the dolphins to push the island towards the human boat. They succeeded: The island crashes into the boat and both sink. The mermaid hunter dies during the crash. Blue Triton then meets Kazuya. He tells him that Triton is dead, and it is better for humans and mermen to stay away from each other. Pipiko leads her children to meet Ganomosu, who is about to die. Ganomosu says he will provide himself as a sanctuary for her and her family out of his friendship with Triton. The mermen and mermaids from then on live on Ganomosu Island.

In the last two episodes of the series, Sparx turned evil, helping Mandarin and Valina collect the objects need to resurrect Skeleton King. During the ritual, Sparx almost killed Nova, but her kind words to him brought him back long enough to be purified by the others Power Primates.

Although she may be the smallest on the team (a full 2 3/4 inches shorter than Sparx, the second shortest), her size is barely even noticed. Nova is the most determined and courageous of the team. As a result of her violent nature, she is known for her short-fused anger, which is usually taken out on Sparx. She despises (maybe even fears) the cold due to a traumatizing training exercise Mandarin put her through back when he was the leader of the Monkey Team. Her main weapon is her Robotic Fists. She pilots the Foot Crusher Cruiser 6 which forms the right foot of the Super Robot. * (voiced by Ashley Johnson) is robot girl whom Chiro falls in love with. She becomes an official Hyperforce member and becomes the protector of Shuggazoom when the Hyperforce left to destroy the Dark Worm. She has pink hair and green eyes. She usually wears her green dress with a heart in the front and the back when she was an honorary member. Now she wears the same style as Chiro's but in dress form. When she called for help in Ghosts of Shuggazoom, she was wearing her original dress. (All official height and weight sources have been confirmed to be non-canon by Ciro Nieli in an interview during Lightbox Expo.)  Villains  * Skeleton King (Real name: The Alchemist) (voiced by Mark Hamill) is an evil undead warlord/sorcerer who resides in the Citadel of Bone, a gigantic living spaceship (resembling Darth Vader's Super Star Destroyer from the Star Wars films) made entirely from bone and filled with nightmarish monsters, in space, and is determined to rule Shuggazoom. He uses the Formless Minions and various other monsters to fight the Monkey Team, and is very interested in finding out what makes Chiro so special, due to his remarkable control of the Power Primate. He is also constantly trying to corrupt the monkeys for unknown reasons (perhaps it is because the feelings he has for them stayed with him after the Dark One took over his soul). The Skeleton King later merged with the Dark One, only to have him decapitated by the Hyperforce. Later, Antauri cut off the Skeleton King's skull from the Worm which then floated off into space and was later retrieved by Mandarin. After acquiring the skull, along with the Alchemist's robe, the Ice Crystal of Vengeance, the Fire of Hate and the Soul of Evil, the Skull Sorceress used them to resurrect the Skeleton King into a more powerful and frightening form resembling a skeletal combination of Darth Vader and Sidious. He then recreated his empire and his army and was last seen about to lead them all into a final assault on Shuggazoom. * Mandarin (voiced by James Hong) was the infamous orange monkey, and the Hyperforce's original leader. He is currently different than the other monkeys who are part robot (though he once was as seen in flashbacks during \\"Secret of the Sixth Monkey\\" and \\"Snowbound\\"), which explains why he has orange gauntlets to emit his energy sword and shield. He also has armor. He wanted to not only protect Shuggazoom but rule it as well. His teammates did not like this, so as a last resort they banished him to an off-world prison called the Hostile Outlaw Observation Prison (in the shape of a hoop), where he remained in a stasis-induced sleep until the signal emitted by his shield (activated by Chiro) awakened him from his dreams of the deaths of his former teammates (\\"countless fantasies played out in the black sleep of stasis\\", as he puts it). Once, he even replicated several clones of Chiro using Chiro's DNA and molecular structure, however he failed miserably and Skeleton King replaced him with a more obedient clone; afterwards, Skeleton King orders his formless minions to take the original Mandarin away (the original Mandarin's whereabouts remain unknown). In \\"Night of Fear\\", it is revealed that his biggest fear is the Skull Sorceress, despite managing to silence her when she is still trapped in the medallion. *Skull Sorceress (Real name: Valina Sheenko, also spelled Valeena) (voiced by Hynden Walch) was a member of the Skeletal Circle, a secret group of Shuggazoom citizens who worshipped the Skeleton King. The leaders, Ma and Pa Sheenko, were her loving yet somewhat critical parents who chose her to accept Skeleton King's power. Skeleton King's influence saw her fit to rule the Savage Lands, which is a large, hidden jungle which lied in a series of caves beneath the surface of Shuggazoom. She is an evil, beautiful and powerful sorceress, with the ability to summon the Dark One. She can create bubbles, teleport, steal souls, and hurl deadly energy blasts. When the Monkey Team and Jinmay attempted to rescue Chiro from the Skeleton King's jungle hidden beneath the badlands, Valina attempted to kidnap Jinmay, and the rescued Chiro and the rest of the Monkey Team chased after her. She then summoned the Dark One in an attempt to destroy the Monkey Team. When the Dark One was injured by Antauri, she lost her power, and was defeated by Chiro. She was tossed into a vat of formless ooze as the savage lands and the jungle beneath it were destroyed. The Skull Sorceress returned early in Season 4 only to wind up trapped in a medallion which comes under Mandarin's possession in the same episode. When Mandarin abused her power to create the Monkey Team's worst fears, she trapped him and wanted to use the Skeleton King's skull to resurrect him. She and Mandarin did, finally, resurrect the Skeleton King at the end of Season 4, but instead of rewarding her, he killed her with a powerful energy blast that reduced her to ashes (though Chiro tried to prevent this). * Formless Minions: Also called \\"Bone Drones\\". The Formless Minions are the black skeleton-like creatures that are created from some kind of black ooze and act as the foot soldiers of the Skeleton King's army. The Formless Minions are known to ride on motorcycles during their attacks on Shuggazoom, transform their hands into various weapons, and amass themselves into a gigantic monster to attack The Super Robot. They strongly resemble the foot soldiers from the Super Sentai and Power Rangers television series, particularly the oozemen from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie. There are various versions of the Formless, some of which include: :* the regular Formless Soldier :* the Hyperformless - a batch of Formless in the five colours of the Robot Monkeys, created to counteract the powers of the Hyperforce. (The Black Hyperformless shoots massive spikes from its chest; the Red Hyperformless uses gigantic battle cuffs for hands; the Blue Hyperformless welds sharp blade-like hands for combat; the Green Hyperformless uses its gigantic hammer-shaped head to crush foes; the Yellow Hyperformless uses massive cleated boots to stomp its enemies.) They we‚Äôre destroyed when the Monkey Team used new moves. :* the Red Crystal-bearing Formless Soldier - one which can shoot fireballs and regenerate from their wounds; the much-stronger Formless type :* the Formless Chiro Clones :* the Formless Chiro Mutants - hybrids of Chiro and various animals :* Chira and Chiru - two muscular female versions of Chiro; Chiru refers to her fellow clone as a sister, implying familiality, and they are referred to as twins by their creator as well :* Chiro Blob - a gruesome growing mass in Chiro's likeness :* Formless Slugs :* Winged Formless :* Giant Formless :* Formless Spider :* Formless Sea Serpent :* Formless Tyrannosaurus :* Primitive Formless, a kind of Neanderthal-like Formless that adapted to the harsh jungle settings of the Savage Lands and serve as Valeena's guardians. :* Formless Magma, volcanic magma/lava utilized by the Skeleton King. * TV Monster / Skeleton King Droid: (voiced by Mark Hamill) A black and bulky looking, yet powerful robot made to personally serve Skeleton King as his herald. In Season 1, as Skeleton King could not leave the Citadel of Bone, the TV Monster did his work, carrying his essence wherever it needed to go. It has a large monitor at its center, on which Skeleton King was screened. It was defeated at the end of Season 1, and was not seen until late Season 2, where it was blown away from the Citadel of Bone, but apparently not destroyed. It returned in early Season 3, abducted by an infected robot mind who was bent on destroying everything that ever had contact with Skeleton King. No longer able to ferry Skeleton King's essence around, the TV Monster fused itself with the remnants of the robot mind instead, becoming the Skeleton King Droid (or Skeleton Droid). All its attacks were upgraded, and it became undefeatable. It can take out lasers from every part of itself, transform into a ball, and fly at incredible speeds. At the end of Season 3, it was destroyed by the Super Robot. Mandarin recovered it, and now uses it as a ship. * Elevator Monster: (voiced by Clancy Brown) A psychic being that serves the Skeleton King. It lures people into its elevator in the episode \\"Pit of Doom\\". It looks like an old man, but is able to combine itself with the elevator. Its teleporting ability gave it an advantage against the Monkey Team for a while, until Sprx finally defeated the monster with his Magna-Tingler Blast. The Elevator Monster made an appearance in \\"In the Grip of Evil\\" along with other defeated villains. * Gyrus Krinkle: (voiced by Jeffrey Combs) A sad, lonely man who grew up with an unloving robot mother that he presumably built himself (he even admits to Chiro that her heart was made of polyurethane, invoking this theory). He has dark blue hair, light blue skin, a turkey-like crooked neck, and a big nose. He is a big fan of the Hyperforce, and this fanaticism eventually turned into an obsession. Krinkle was originally part of the cleanup crew that cleaned the city after the team's battles with monsters, but was then fired because he was cleaning the Super Robot instead of the city, on the grounds of \\"excessive creepiness\\" because his boss felt that his fanaticism was becoming an unhealthy obsession. Krinkle, although an amazing technical genius and mastermind, is also completely mentally unstable. His failed attempt to join the Hyperforce led him to sneak into the Super Robot in a Chiro costume and hypnotize the Monkey Team into fighting the real Chiro, who at the time was in a robot suit. Chiro finally managed to free the Monkey Team from their waking dream state, and tricked Krinkle into thinking he was part of the team. When captured, Krinkle was sent to Moonbase Theta Prison Complex on Ranger 7, where he was last seen to be talking to the Hyperforce about their purported adventures together only to be shocked out of his thoughts by one of the security robots, who angrily orders him to keep it down or he will be placed into stasis; long after the robot is gone, however, he resumes - revealing to the audience that he is in a white padded room talking to himself. He was not seen again until Season 4, when he had taken over the facility and had captured Chiro in his mind using a matter-to-brainwave conversion device he invented called the Neuro-Matter Reconfigutron. When he sent the Monkey Team into his mental world, they managed to shatter it by attacking fissures that appeared when he got angry. They were sent back to the facility and Krinkle disappeared into the Neuro-Matter Reconfigutron seconds before the machine exploded. Whether or not Krinkle is alive or if he is trapped inside the machine is unknown. It's also revealed in this episode that he also enjoys painting; he paints a picture of a large-eyed dog which, after his apparent death, becomes a picture of himself and the Hyperforce (sans Chiro) in action poses. * Professor Maezono: (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) A now disembodied brain, Professor Maezono was a human that was one of the creators of the Super Robot. He secretly built many varying models of the Super Robot for his own evil needs. When the Prometheus Five (Slingshot) was created as the last generation of Super Robots, he tried to fuse his consciousness with the robot. When his 'friend' Dr. Takeuchi tried to stop him, the Professor's brain triggered an explosion that destroyed his lab and Dr. Takeuchi. From then on, he was locked in combat with Slingshot, who vowed to avenge Dr. Takeuchi's death. When the Monkey Team came to the planet, Maezono tricked them into trying to destroy Slingshot. Slingshot soon turned them right, but Prof. Maezono escaped. Slingshot is now chasing him across the galaxy trying to destroy him. *Sakko: (voiced by Tom Kenny) Sakko is a tiny, girly-looking monkey. He may be cute, but he is actually a spy for Skeleton King. He was the first agent of Skeleton King seen in the show, but was soon 'taken away'. He returned at the end of Season 1, partnering up with Mandarin. After he and Mandarin abandoned Skeleton King, he was not seen again until Season 4, where it was revealed that he currently resides in the prison on Ranger 7. *Flytor: (voiced by Tom Kenny) Being a union of three monsters of the Skeleton King, Flytor is a combination of a mutated fly, crab and plant. He possess a sonic scream and his able to fly very fast. He is one of the Skeleton King more dangerous monster and was created for the purpose to scan Chiro's genetic blueprint to find out what made Chiro so special. In the Episode The Skeleton King Threat, it was discovered that Flytor was created from a fourth monster, a gigantic man with a huge pimple on his head and a powerful energy blast that can turn people bald. Flytor was seen in \\"In the Grip of Evil\\". *Biff Beefy Box / Cloggy Colon Creature: (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) Also known as Captain Beefy Box, a seemingly friendly alien is the manager and mascot of Wonder Fun Meat World, an intergalactic fast food restaurant chain. But in truth, Biff Beefy Box's real form is Cloggy Colon Creature, a gigantic Anthropomorphic Colon monster that wants to get people fat with its meat products so it can devour them, as humans are the \\"ultimate fast food\\" on his home planet (monkeys are a delicacy there as well). It arrives at Shuggazoom City with its store of meat (and meat characters: Big Meat Cone, Meat-cicle, etc.) Eating the meat hypnotizes people so they continue eating more and more, like an obsession, making the human (and monkey) body complacent to its power. In the end, its plan was discovered and its true form revealed. It was defeated by the not-eaten Shugazoomians and launched into the sun by the Super Robot. The Cloggy Colon Creature made an appearance in Season 4, where it was revealed that he currently resides in the prison on Ranger 7 with Sakko. However, before that, he was mentioned by Antauri (along with Cheese-Bot) in \\"A Man Named Krinkle\\". *Scrapperton: (voiced by Eric Idle and later by Jeff Bennett) Also known as Duke Scrapperton, Grand Earl of the Mecha Realm. A once mortal man that \\"upgraded\\" (actually, \\"replaced\\") every part of his body with a mechanical version (wonders of steam technology as he puts it), Scrapperton is a kindly-seeming robo-man, but he works for Skeleton King. He collects mostly useless junk, but his collecting habits can get in the way of his mind. He lured the Monkeys to his lair by capturing Sprx, and soon stole all of their hands and hand attachments. He later made robot apes that worshiped the monkeys in order to trick them into joining him, and was taken by the robot apes when they left the city at the end of the episode, after having escaped from under the influence of his mind control chips. He returned in the episode \\"In the Grip of Evil\\" (walking past Otto, Gibson and Sprx before entering the elevator monster which then disappeared), as did most villains from the show. *Morlath: (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) Also known as The Mythic Lord of The Northern Ice, this gigantic frost demon was trapped in a cavern in the Sea of Ice outside of Shuggazoom City until he encounters Skeleton King who offers to free him if he lends his power to freeze the city. Later Skeleton King reveals that his true intention to free Morlath was to capture him and use Morlath's ice magic for himself. Later in season 4, when Valeena, Mandarin and The Hyperforce went on their search to find The Ice crystal of Vengeance, the second element to resurrect Skeleton King, Morlath was returned in the same cavern. But now Morlath was mobile and guarding the Ice Crystal so that Skeleton King would be a prisoner in his power as Morlath was a prisoner and engaged them in battle to prevent the crystal from leaving. His fate was sealed when the Super Robot destroys his cavern with the melting frost demon inside. *The Curator: An eccentric yet creepy owner of the possibly \\"haunted\\" Shuggazoom History Museum that has been closed for years until the Hyperforce got their own exhibit for their heroic deeds. He believes history is most interesting when \\"evil triumpths over good\\", and has several ancestors to support that belief (a medieval knight that took several innocent lives in witch trials, a western outlaw that wiped a town off the map, and a caveman that's possibly responsible for dinosaurs going extinct, just to name a few). In attempt to make sure he goes down in history himself, the Curator turns the museum and its exhibits into a hub of pocket-dimension so copies of his anscestors and several ancient torture devices could destroy the Hyperforce, but the whole plan eventually backfires on him when his creations are defeated and he ends up in a pocket dimension of modern Shuggazoom City that formed from the newest exhibit, while the Hyperforce, thanks to Antauri, found the real exit... upon returning to the present (and reality for that matter), a new figurine of the Curator is found in the Hyperforce Exhibit, showing he got what he wanted in an eternal prison. *Ma and Pa Sheenko: (voiced by Kari Wahlgren and Clancy Brown) The leaders of the Skeletal Circle, and Valina's loving yet somewhat critical parents who chose her to accept Skeleton King's power. *The Dark Ones: A species of evil entities with the power to destroy creation that were created by an unknown cosmic force when the universe was young. While many were confined in the Netherworld, some of them are dormant in their planets' cores. They have so much evil that any organic life is painfully weakened in the Netherworld. Allies The Sun Riders (Super Quasar voiced by Keone Young, Aurora Six voiced by Meredith Salenger, Johnny Sunspot voiced by Tom Kenny) A fictional superhero team with three members: Super Quasar, the leader of the Sun Riders who performs Solar Helmet Hot Shot, an attack which he shoots a consecrated beam of solar energy from his helmet's visors. Aurora Six is the ravishing female of the group that uses the Sun Gun, a weapon that shoots sun beams that stuns her enemies in a main attack called Sun Gun Dazzle Stun. And Johnny Sunspot is the kid sidekick genius (who builds all of the team's weapons) that wields special gloves that create dark energy orbs in an attack called Black Hole Blackout (later Black Hole Barrage in his second appearance). When they join hands, the Sun Riders perform Super Solar Strike, a destructive team attack that's similar to a solar flare. The Sun Riders are known to ride on their Sun Cycles, and their own robot is called the Nebutron, an orblike Super Robot that is heavily armed. They have their television series, of which Chiro is an avid fan. However, they wanted to stop pretending, and in exchange for real power, joined the Skeleton King in the promise of destroying Chiro and the Monkey Team. They later return in Season 2, in the episode \\"The Sun Riders Return\\", apparently reformed and with a more powerful Nebutron ship - which they later sacrifice for the good of others. Aurora Six appeared as an aspect of the Dreamlands in a later episode, \\"In the Grip of Evil\\", and in the last scene of \\"Soul of Evil.\\" The Sun Riders ware last seen on screen as three the allies that will aid the Hyperforce in the last battle against the resurrected Skeleton King and his army of the undead. Slingshot (voiced by Scott Menville) Also known as Prometheus Five, the fifth and most recent in a series of robots of which the Super Robot is the first. As his name implies, beyond standard flight abilities, Slingshot can create energy balls from his hands and use them to propel himself forward at high speed, causing him to move fast enough to puncture even the toughest of metals. Shortly after Slingshot was completed, one of his creators, Professor Maezono, attempted to transplant his own brain into Slingshot's robotic shell as a means of becoming the ultimate death machine. However, his partner, Dr. Takeuchi, removed the power cord during the process as a means of stopping him. The resulting overload caused a massive explosion, killing Dr. Takauchi and reducing Professor Maezono to a disembodied brain. Slingshot blames Maezono for Takauchi's death, and has been battling the mad professor, who wants to see him destroyed, ever since. Unlike the Super Robot, Slingshot is capable of using human speech (although he can hear, understand and translate the silent speech of the Super Robot). Planetoid Q (voiced by Clancy Brown) A living planetesimal with a jack o' lantern-esque face, ordered by the Skeleton King to collide with Shuggazoom. Later, it is convinced by Chiro to make its own decisions and do what it wants instead of listening to the Skeleton King's commands. Planetoid Q appeared as an aspect of the Dreamlands in a later episode. The Circus of Ooze Crew (The Ringmaster voiced by Robert Englund, Leeah the Jungle Girl voiced by Kari Wahlgren) While this traveling circus was cruising the galaxy, they had a run-in with the Citadel of Bone. It shot formless ooze into the train, which Made All the members Evil. The members include the ringmaster, Leeah the jungle girl, and the clowns. They turned for Shuggazoom, and attempted to use the ooze to turn all the citizens of Shuggazoom City into clown slaves, and that included Chiro, who was scared of clowns. They tried to make the monkeys part of the circus, but Otto had no use. When the ringmaster became a giant carousel, Otto did the trapeze and used his saws to cut down the carousel. They gave Otto the starring role in the next show. It is unknown where they are now. Thingy (voiced by Frank Welker) A tiny little fur ball that hailed from an unknown planet. It was rescued by the team on Ranger 7, but turned out to be a trap set by Skeleton King. It can transform into a giant monster, although it is not evil by nature. Its lick is a repellent for Skeleton King's virus. Its fur can also be used in sandwiches. Thingy appeared as an aspect of the Dreamlands in a later episode. Mobius Quint (voiced by Lance Henriksen) A galaxy- class pilot, Quint meets the Hyperforce when the wreckage of his ship The Last Chance is found floating in space, destroyed by fragments of the Citadel. The Hyperforce decides to aid Quint in rescuing his crew from being consumed by the dreaded starship. He briefly falls under the control of the Citadel and becomes consumed with revenge, and takes the Super Robot's neutron generator to try and destroy the Citadel. Chiro got him out in time, and was last seen on screen as one the allies that will aid the Hyperforce in the last battle against the resurrected Skeleton King and his army of the undead. Quint's obsession with destroying the Citadel of Bone is similar to Captain Ahab in the novel Moby-Dick. Captain Shuggazoom (voiced by Bruce Campbell) The previous defender of Shuggazoom City whose secret identity was the wealthy Billionaire Playboy industrialist Clayton Carrington. After defeating his nemesis, Doctor Malicious, who was armed with the Magna Ball-Blazer, Captain Shuggazoom returned the weapon to its creator and personal friend, The Alchemist. As Captain Shuggazoom asked if his Silver Monkey was complete, The Alchemist, who was accompanied by the Monkey Team before cyberization, warned Captain Shuggazoom about the looming threat of The Dark Ones, Transdimensional Demons sealed by the Veran-Mystics thousands of years ago, and took him on his custom-made portal to the Netherworld to monitor their growing forces. Captain Shuggazoom asked if it was dangerous to have an open portal functional, The Alchemist reassured him by saying that the Containment Grid surrounding the portal was completely impenetrable. As Captain Shuggazoom left to respond to a distress call, Mandarin damaged the containment grid, which released a gigantic hand that grabbed and attacked The Alchemist, and a Demon Beast which escaped the lab to terrorize Shuggazoom City. Forced to abandon his alien date as Clayton to battle the Demon Beast, it nearly opened a portal to the Netherworld to unleash it brethren, which Captain Shuggazoom barely averted. Clearly out-matched, Captain Shuggazoom returned to The Alchemist's Lab for aid, and discovered that The Alchemist was aging. He explained that The Portal was damaged, which led to The Demon Beast's release, and he was changed upon contact from The Dark Ones. Grabbing the Sleep Cannon, Captain Shuggazoom promised to return soon, and engaged The Dark One in a final battle. As the Demon Beast began to attack Captain Shuggazoom, he used the weapon on the monster and successfully put it to hibernation. He got caught in the blast as well, and fell with the monster into a cavern below. 60 years later, he was discovered when Hyperforce picked up his heat signature coming from inside the cavern while searching for Mandarin and the Skull Sorceress. They went down to investigate, believing it to be Skull Sorceress, but were shocked instead find an old man sleeping in suspended animation and wearing a helmet exactly like their emblem. After reviving the man (who was revealed to be Captain Shuggazoom himself) by setting the Sleep Cannon to reverse polarity, the captain was shocked to see himself as an old man. However, after telling the Hyperfoce everything he remembered, Captain Shuggazoom assumed the world lives on since the dimensional portal was closed for all this time, and wondered about the condition of the Alchemist. Antauri sadly states that The Alchemist was completely corrupted by The Dark Ones, and Nova stated that the very reason that The Monkey Team was created was to protect the Universe from him. Meanwhile, Gibson remembered that the captain said the Demon Beast was imprisoned with him, so Otto looked at the Sleep Cannon and discovered that its reverse polarity had a one-mile radius and accidentally awoken the Demon Beast to resume its purpose. Hoping to redeem himself after believing that he abandoned The Alchemist in his hour in need, Captain Shuggazoom joined The Hyperforce to stop The Demon Beast's rampage, only to find The Super Robot overwhelmed by the Demon Beast's strength. The Demon Beast had Captain Shuggazoom in its mouth, and the beast started to reopen the dimensional rift. Determined to not fail The Hyperforce as he failed The Alchemist, Captain Shuggazoom successfully fired The Sleep Cannon from within The Demon Beast and escaped from its jaws, leaving The Super Robot to use Lazertron Fury to push the sleeping Dark One back to the rift, thus sealing it from within. After the dramatic battle, Captain Shuggazoom decides to leave The Hyperforce and return to The Alchemist's Laboratory to find out what happened to him during his final days for his peace of mind. While exploring the Laboratory, He discovered The Alchemist's final computerized message. During the final stages of his metamorphosis from living to undead The Alchemist says that the Monkey Team is now complete and it's their task to stop the evil he's unleashed before it's too late. \\"Now The Dark Ones take my soul!\\" was The Alchemist's final chilling line as his transformation to the Skeleton King was finally compete. Kneeling before the Alchemist's robe, he apologized for abandoning him in his time of need, when he was attacked by Valina and Mandarin. Captain Shuggazoom fought bravely to keep the robe from Mandarin's hands only to be blasted by Valina. Badly beaten, Captain Shuggazoom mentally called Antauri, which brought the Hyperforce to his aid. Before passing out, Captain Shuggazoom warned the team that Mandarin and Valina took The Alchemist's robe and went to see Morlath, The Mythic Lord of The Northern Ice, and are planning to resurrect The Skeleton King. He is currently recuperating in the Super Robot's Healing Chamber and it is unknown that if he will join The Hyperforce in the final battle against the newly reborn Skeleton King and his army of the Undead. It is noted that Captain Shuggazoom has a strong mental connection to Antauri. The Alchemist (voiced by Mark Hamill) A mysterious, yet kind man who fuses Science and Magic for the betterment of mankind. The Alchemist encountered The Hyperforce during their visit to the Dreamlands, and offered to guide them to an exit while fending off Skeleton King. When the Monkey Team made their way through the underground doorway, they all witnessed a flashback of the Alchemist in a laboratory, standing near six tubes containing six baby monkeys that instantly aged to adulthood when he pulled the switch. The Alchemist later created robotic exoskeletons and personalized weapons for each monkey. After the construction of the Monkey Team was completed, the Alchemist initiated a memory erase so that the Hyperforce could not remember their origin. When the Hyperforce confronted the Alchemist on why he did this, he explained \\"Because of what I was becoming. I created you to protect the universe from a great evil...Myself!\\" and transformed into Skeleton King, confirming that the Alchemist was his former human identity. The Alchemist later appeared in the Savage Lands as recorded messages in his abandoned laboratory that explained to a then-primitive Chiro that he created the Monkey Team in that spot to combat an evil beyond imagination. In the message, The Alchemist aided Chiro in rebuilding the powerful Silver Monkey body, which required living energy to function properly and wield the Power Primate. The Alchemist was also mentioned in Prototype as one of the Three Creators of the Super Robot, who, along with Professor Maezono and Dr. Takeuchi, helped in the creation of the Super Robot but vanished along with the Super Robot after its completion. The Alchemist was also the close friend of Captain Shuggazoom, Shuggazoom city's previous defender who tried to warn him of the looming threat of the Dark Ones, the transdimensional demons sealed by the Veran- Mystics thousands of years ago, and showed him his custom-made portal to the Netherworld to monitor their growing forces. Captain Shuggazoom asked was it dangerous to have an open portal to Netherworld functional, the Alchemist reassured him by saying that the Containment Grid surrounding the portal was completely impenetrable. As Captain Shuggazoom left to respond to a distress call, Mandarin damaged the containment grid, releasing a gigantic hand that grabbed and attacked the Alchemist, as well as unleash a Demon Beast, which escaped the lab to terrorize Shuggazoom City. Captain Shuggazoom returned to The Alchemist's Lab for aid, and discovered that the Alchemist was aging rapidly. He explained that the Portal was damaged which led to the Demon Beast's release, and he was changed upon contact from the Dark Ones, and is slowly being transformed by their malevolent influence. Grabbing the Sleep Cannon, Captain Shuggazoom promised to return soon, in which the Alchemist response was \\"I hope so Captain, at least to say good bye.\\" as he began to transform into Skeleton King. The Alchemist was last mentioned in a final computerized message discovered by Captain Shuggazoom. During the final stages of his metamorphosis, the Alchemist says that the Monkey Team is now complete, and it's their task to stop the evil he's unleashed. \\"Now The Dark Ones take my soul!\\" was the Alchemist's final chilling line as his transformation to the Skeleton King was finally complete. The Alchemist is shown to have special bond with Nova before his transformation into Skeleton King, and often called her \\"Dearest Nova\\" or \\"Dear Nova\\". In fact, he had a special bond with all his beloved monkeys (even Mandarin), who he felt were his children. Master Offay (voiced by Makoto Iwamatsu) Also known as the Hard Master due to sounding strict, Master Offay runs an interplanetary dojo on the Planet Galaxia and was Nova's former martial arts trainer. The Hyperforce meets him on their quest to destroy The Skeleton King Worm and discovered that Galaxia was corrupted by the Dark One's passage, turing all of its inhabitants into mindless battle crazed monsters that fight in The Monster Battle Club, a vicious and brutal tournament. When Chiro becomes infected by Galaxia's corrupted atmosphere, Master Offay helps Chiro to control his new savage monster form by training him in the ancient ways of Monster Fighting, where a still spirit can conquer any obstacle. When Chiro defeats all off the contestants of the Monster Battle Club, he learns that the Warlord, the head champion who created the tournament is Master Offay, whose mind was warped by The Skeleton King Worm's power. To bring Master Offay to his true senses, Chiro uses Master Offay's teachings and The Power Primate to subdue him. Master Offay was last seen on screen as one the allies that will aid the Hyperforce in the last battle against the resurrected Skeleton King and his army of the undead. Olliana (voiced by Tara Strong) First seen in episode 40 Galactic Smash Space Attack, Olliana asks for the teams help to stop an evil gamer called Commodore (voiced by Arthur Burghardt) whose mission is to destroy as many planets as he can to get the highest score in an interstellar game called \\"Galactic Smash\\" (Hence the episode name.) She, like many other allies, is seen aiding the team in the last scene of the last episode. Shuggazoom Citizens * BT and Glenny: Two teens that know Chiro from preseries, it is unclear if they are friends or bullies of him. * Mr. Gackslapper (voiced by Clancy Brown): Mr. Gackslapper is a cook who owns a fast-food restaurant called \\"Hoverburgers\\", where he cooks levitating burgers. * Nerd Kid and Mr. Cheepers: A man in red glasses and his stuffed penguin, he is seen the most out of the side characters and has the most dialog (mostly to his penguin). Although his name is never said during the series, a group of fans have taken to calling him \\"Ned\\". Super Robot ","title":"List of Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go! characters"},{"id":"11719730","title":"The Devil's Whore"},{"id":"11719731","text":"Zona Universit√†ria is a station in the Barcelona Metro and Trambaix networks, in the Les Corts district of Barcelona. It is currently the western terminus of metro line L3 and L9. Also it's served by tram lines T1, T2 and T3. It is named after the Universitat de Barcelona campus of the same name. The metro station is located under Avinguda Diagonal, between Carrer Gonz√°lez Tablas and Avinguda Dr. Mara√±√≥n. It has fuve entrances, two on each side of Avinguda Diagonal, one in Avinguda Dr. Mara√±√≥n, and two long side platforms. The entrance lobby features an artwork by the sculptor Angel Orensanz. The Trambaix stop lies some to the east, in Carrer d'Adolf Florensa. The metro station opened in 1975, along with the other stations of the section of L3 between Zona Universit√†ria and Sants Estaci√≥ stations.

He was imprisoned, along with his brothers William and Andrew, in Norwich in 1396. Richard II of England ordered their release from the Mayor and bailies of that city on 29 June. It appears that their imprisonment was due to violations of the truce between the Kingdoms of England and Scotland. A John Hamilton, either his brother John Hamilton of Bardowie, or uncle John Hamilton of Fingalton, was released from the Tower of London on the same date. Hamilton and his uncle seem to have found themselves guests of the English again, when at a meeting of Border commissioners at Hawdenstank on 28 October 1398, the first point of business was the release of Hamilton of Cadzow, and Hamilton of Fingalton and others in their entourage. The Hamiltons had been caught at sea by English privateers, again in violation of the truce. The English were urged to release the ship and restore their goods to them, or alternatively pay suitable recompense. There is no record of Hamilton's death, though it is possible that he was one of the prisoner fatalities at the Battle of Homildon Hill in 1402, where a Sir John Hamilton, elder, appears on a list of captives.

She has written numerous books and articles on different topics relating to social movements in the Americas. Her best-known work is the bilingual 500 years of Chicano History in Pictures, which later formed the basis for the educational video ¬°Viva la Causa! 500 Years of Chicano History. Her work has been hailed by Angela Y. Davis as comprising \\"one of the most important living histories of progressive activism in the contemporary era ... [Mart√≠nez is] inimitable ... irrepressible ... indefatigable.\\" Life Mart√≠nez is the daughter of Manuel Guillermo Martinez and Ruth Philips Mart√≠nez. Her parents nicknamed her \\"Betita\\" for short. She grew up in a middle class predominately white neighborhood in Washington, D.C. because her father worked as a secretary in the Mexican Embassy. Her mother received a master's degree from George Washington and taught advanced high school Spanish. Some of Mart√≠nez's first jobs included a clerk-typist at an insurance company, a waitress at an ice-cream store, and a copy girl at the Washington Post. Mart√≠nez was the first Latina student to graduate from Swarthmore College in 1946 where she received a Bachelor of Arts degree with Honors in History and Literature. When Mart√≠nez was twenty-three she married her first husband Leonard Berman and then divorced in 1952. She married her second husband Hans Koning in 1952 and they had their daughter Tessa Koning-Mart√≠nez together in 1954. In May 2000, Swarthmore awarded Mart√≠nez with an honorary doctorate. Mart√≠nez has worked for Simon & Schuster as an editor and for The Nation Magazine as Books and Arts Editor. Her daughter, Tessa, is an actress and co-founder of San Francisco‚Äôs Latina Theater Lab. Activism Mart√≠nez began her political work in the early 1950s. She worked in New York for the United Nations Secretariat as a researcher on colonialism and decolonization in Africa. During the 1960s, Mart√≠nez served full-time in the Civil Rights Movement with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in the South and as a coordinator of its New York office. Mart√≠nez edited the photo history book, The Movement, that raised funds for the SNCC. She was one of only two Latina women who worked for the SNCC. In 1968, she moved to New Mexico to start a newspaper to support the Alianza Federal de Mercedes. Along with lawyer Beverly Axelrod, Mart√≠nez thus founded the bilingual movement newspaper El Grito del Norte, which she worked on for five years. In 1973, she co-founded and directed the Chicano Communications Center, a barrio-based organizing and education project. Mart√≠nez edited the bilingual pictorial volume 500 Years of Chicano History that influenced her video Viva La Causa! that has been shown at film festivals and in classrooms across the country. Since moving to the Bay Area in 1976, Mart√≠nez has organized around Latino community issues, taught Women's studies part-time, conducted anti-racist training workshops, and worked with youth groups. Mart√≠nez taught Ethnic Studies and Women's Studies at Hayward State University. Throughout her career Mart√≠nez has written many articles. She has written pieces for Z Magazine, Ms.Magazine, and many other publications. Mart√≠nez ran for Governor of California on the Peace & Freedom Party ticket in 1982 and has received many awards from student, community, and academic organizations, including Scholar of the Year 2000 by the National Association for Chicana and Chicano Studies. In 1997, she and Phil Hutchings co-founded the Institute for MultiRacial Justice, which \\"aims to strengthen the struggle against white supremacy by serving as a resource center to help build alliances among peoples of color and combat divisions.\\" In 2004, she served on the advisory board for the group 2004 Racism Watch. She is also an adviser to the Catalyst Project, an anti-racist political education organization that focuses on white communities.

Examples: the Journal of Applied Technical and Educational Sciences; international conferences: World Conference on Educational Sciences; International Conference on Educational Sciences, Technology Integration and Mobile Learning; University of Wisconsin Educational Sciences Building, Indiana State University Department of Applied Clinical and Educational Sciences or education theory (traditionally often called pedagogy) seek to describe, understand, and prescribe education policy and practice. Education sciences include many topics, such as pedagogy, andragogy, curriculum, learning, and education policy, organization and leadership. Educational thought is informed by many disciplines, such as history, philosophy, sociology, and psychology. Faculties, departments, degree programs, and degrees on education sciences are often called simply faculty of education etc. It is likewise still common to say she is studying education, which is only very rarely expressed as studying education science(s) and was traditionally called studying pedagogy (in English) in most European countries. For example, a cultural theory of education considers how education occurs through the totality of culture, including prisons, households, and religious institutions as well as schools. Other examples are the behaviorist theory of education that comes from educational psychology and the functionalist theory of education that comes from sociology of education.Webb, DL, A Metha, and KF Jordan (2010). Foundations of American Education, 6th Ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Merill, pp. 77-80,192-193. The earliest known attempts to understand education in Europe were by classical Greek philosophers and sophists, but there is also evidence of contemporary (or even preceding) discussions among Arabic, Indian, and Chinese scholars. Educational thought Educational thought is not necessarily concerned with the construction of theories as much as the \\"reflective examination of educational issues and problems from the perspective of diverse disciplines.\\" Normative theories of education Normative theories of education provide the norms, goals, and standards of education. Educational philosophies \\"Normative philosophies or theories of education may make use of the results of [philosophical thought] and of factual inquiries about human beings and the psychology of learning, but in any case they propound views about what education should be, what dispositions it should cultivate, why it ought to cultivate them, how and in whom it should do so, and what forms it should take. In a full-fledged philosophical normative theory of education, besides analysis of the sorts described, there will normally be propositions of the following kinds: 1\\\\. Basic normative premises about what is good or right; 2\\\\. Basic factual premises about humanity and the world; 3\\\\. Conclusions, based on these two kinds of premises, about the dispositions education should foster; 4\\\\. Further factual premises about such things as the psychology of learning and methods of teaching; and 5\\\\. Further conclusions about such things as the methods that education should use.\\" Examples of the purpose of schools include:Webb, DL, A Metha, and KF Jordan (2010). Foundations of American Education, 6th Ed.

(2012). Is Modern American Public Education Promoting a Sane Society, in \\"International Journal of Science\\" 2nd Ed. ISSN 2225-7063, pp. 69-81, http://issuu.com/ijosc.net/docs/ijosc?mode=window&viewMode;=doublePage Common educational philosophies include: educational perennialism, educational progressivism, educational essentialism, critical pedagogy, Montessori education, Waldorf education, and democratic education. Curriculum theory Normative theories of curriculum aim to \\"describe, or set norms, for conditions surrounding many of the concepts and constructs\\" that define curriculum. These normative propositions differ from those above in that normative curriculum theory is not necessarily untestable. A central question asked by normative curriculum theory is: given a particular educational philosophy, what is worth knowing and why? Some examples are: a deep understanding of the Great Books, direct experiences driven by student interest, a superficial understanding of a wide range knowledge (e.g. Core knowledge), social and community problems and issues, knowledge and understanding specific to cultures and their achievements (e.g. African- Centered Education).  Feminist educational theory   Background  Scholars such as Robyn Wiegman argue that, \\"academic feminism is perhaps the most successful institutionalizing project of its generation, with more full- time faculty positions and new doctoral degree programs emerging each year in the field it inaugurated, Women's Studies\\". Feminist educational theory stems from four key tenets, supported by empirical data based on surveys of feminist educators. The first tenet of feminist educational theory is, \\"Creation of participatory classroom communities\\". Participatory classroom communities often are smaller classes built around discussion and student involvement. The second tenet is, \\"Validation of personal experience\\". Classrooms in which validation of personal experience occur often are focused around students providing their own insights and experiences in group discussion, rather than relying exclusively on the insight of the educator. The third tenet is, \\"Encouragement of social understanding and activism\\". This tenet is generally actualized by classrooms discussing and reading about social and societal aspects that students may not be aware of, along with breeding student self- efficacy. The fourth and final tenet of feminist education is, ‚ÄúDevelopment of critical thinking skills/open-mindedness‚Äù. Classrooms actively engaging in this tenet encourage students to think for themselves and prompt them to move beyond their comfort zones, working outside the bounds of the traditional lecture-based classroom. Though these tenets at times overlap, they combine to provide the basis for modern feminist educational theory, and are supported by a majority of feminist educators. Feminist educational theory derives from the feminist movement, particularly that of the early 1970s, which prominent feminist bell hooks describes as, ‚Äúa movement to end sexism, sexist exploitation, and oppression‚Äù. Academic feminist Robyn Weigman recalls that, ‚ÄúIn the early seventies, feminism in the U.S. academy was less an organized entity than a set of practices: an ensemble of courses listed on bulletin boards often taught for free by faculty and community leaders‚Äù. While feminism traditionally existed outside of the institutionalization of schools (particularly universities), feminist education has gradually taken hold in the last few decades and has gained a foothold in institutionalized educational bodies. ‚ÄúOnce fledgling programs have become departments, and faculty have been hired and tenured with full-time commitments‚Äù.  Opposition  Opposition to feminist educational theory comes from both those who oppose feminism in general and feminists who oppose feminist educational theory in particular. Critics of feminist educational theory argue against the four basic tenets of the theory, ‚Äú...[contesting] both their legitimacy and their implementation‚Äù. Lewis Lehrman particularly describes feminist educational ideology as, ‚Äú...'therapeutic pedagogy' that substitutes an 'overriding' (and detrimental) value on participatory interaction for the expertise of the faculty‚Äù (Hoffman). Lehrman argues that the feminist educational tenets of participatory experience and validation of person experience hinder education by limiting and inhibiting the educator‚Äôs ability to share his or her knowledge, learned through years of education and experience. Others challenge the legitimacy of feminist educational theory, arguing that it is not unique and is instead a sect of liberatory education. Even feminist educational scholars such as Frances Hoffmann and Jayne Stake are forced to concede that, ‚Äúfeminist pedagogy shared intellectual and political roots with the movements comprising the liberatory education agenda of the past 30 years‚Äù. These liberatory attempts at the democratization of classrooms demonstrate a growth in liberatory education philosophy that some argue feminist educational theory simply piggybacks off of. The harshest critiques of feminist educational theory often come from feminists themselves. Feminist scholar Robyn Wiegman argues against feminist education in her article \\"Academic Feminism against Itself,\\" arguing that feminist educational ideology has abandoned the intersectionality of feminism in many cases, and has also focused exclusively on present content with a singular perspective. Wiegman refers to feminist scholar James Newman's arguments, centered around the idea that, \\"When we fail... to challenge both students and ourselves to theorize alterity as an issue of change over time as well as of geographic distance, ethnic difference, and sexual choice, we repress... not only the ‚Äòthickness‚Äô of historical difference itself, but also... our (self) implication in a narrative of progress whose hero(in)es inhabit only the present\\". Newman (and Wiegman) believe that this presentist ideology imbued within modern academic feminism creates an environment breeding antifeminist ideologies, most importantly an abandonment of the study of difference, integral to feminist ideology. Wiegman believes that feminist educational theory does a great disservice to the feminist movement, while failing to instill the critical thinking and social awareness that feminist educational theory is intended to.  Support  There are supporters of feminist education as well, many of whom are educators or students. Professor Becky Ropers-Huilman recounts one of her positive experiences with feminist education from the student perspective, explaining that she \\"...felt very ‚Äòin charge‚Äô of [her] own learning experiences,\\" and \\"...was not being graded‚Äìor degraded... [while completing] the majority of the assigned work for the class (and additional work that [she] thought would add to class discussion),\\" all while \\"...[regarding] the teacher‚Äôs feedback on [her] participation as one perspective, rather than the perspective\\". Ropers experienced a working feminist classroom that successfully motivated students to go above and beyond, succeeding in generating self-efficacy and caring in the classroom. When Ropers became a teacher herself, she embraced feminist educational theory, noting that, \\"[Teachers] have an obligation as the ones who are vested with an assumed power, even if that power is easily and regularly disrupted, to assess and address the effects that it is having in our classrooms\\". Ropers firmly believes that educators have a duty to address feminist concepts such as the use and flow of power within the classroom, and strongly believes in the potential of feminist educational theory to create positive learning experiences for students and teachers as she has personally experienced. Becky Ropers-Huilman also celebrates the feminist classroom‚Äôs inclusivity, noting that in a feminist classroom, \\"in which power is used to care about, for, and with others‚Ä¶ educational participants can shape practices aimed at creating an inclusive society that discovers and utilizes the potential of its actors\\". Ropers believes that a feminist classroom carries the ability to greatly influence the society as a whole, promoting understanding, caring, and inclusivity. Ropers actively engages in feminist education in her classes, focusing on concepts such as active learning and critical thinking while attempting to demonstrate and engage in caring behavior and atypical classroom settings, similar to many other feminist educators. Leading feminist scholar bell hooks argues for the incorporation of feminism into all aspects of society, including education, in her book Feminism is for Everybody. hooks notes that, \\"Everything [people] know about feminism has come into their lives thirdhand\\". hooks believes that education offers a counter to the, \\"...wrongminded notion of feminist movement which implied it was anti-male\\". hooks cites feminism‚Äôs negative connotations as major inhibitors to the spread and adoption of feminist ideologies. However, feminist education has seen tremendous growth in adoption in the past few decades, despite the negative connotations of its parent movement. Descriptive theories of education Descriptive theories of education provide descriptions or explanations of the processes of education. Curriculum theory Descriptive theories of curriculum explain how curricula \\"benefit or harm all publics it touches\\". The term hidden curriculum describes that which is learned simply by being in a learning environment. For example, a student in a teacher-led classroom is learning submission. The hidden curriculum is not necessarily intentional.Martin, Jane. \\"What Should We Do with a Hidden Curriculum When We Find One?\\" The Hidden Curriculum and Moral Education. Ed. Giroux, Henry and David Purpel. Berkeley, California: McCutchan Publishing Corporation, 1983. 122‚Äì139. Instructional theory Instructional theories focus on the methods of instruction for teaching curricula. Theories include the methods of: autonomous learning, coyote teaching, inquiry-based instruction, lecture, maturationism, socratic method, outcome-based education, taking children seriously, transformative learning The nature of the learner and of learning Philosophical Anthropology Philosophical anthropology is the philosophical study of human nature. In terms of learning, examples of descriptive theories of the learner are: a mind, soul, and spirit capable of emulating the Absolute Mind (Idealism); an orderly, sensing, and rational being capable of understanding the world of things (Realism), a rational being with a soul modeled after God and who comes to know God through reason and revelation (Neo-Thomism), an evolving and active being capable of interacting with the environment (Pragmatism), a fundamentally free and individual being who is capable of being authentic through the making of and taking responsibility for choices (Existentialism).Webb, DL, A Metha, and KF Jordan (2010). Foundations of American Education, 6th Ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Merill, pp. 55-62 Philosophical concepts for the process of education include Bildung and paideia. Educational Psychology Educational psychology is an empirical science that provides descriptive theories of how people learn. Examples of theories of education in psychology are: constructivism, behaviorism, cognitivism, and motivational theory Educational Neuroscience Educational neuroscience is an emerging field that brings together researchers in diverse disciplines to explore the interactions between biological processes and education. Sociology of education The sociology of education is the study of how public institutions and individual experiences affect education and its outcomes. It is most concerned with the public schooling systems of modern industrial societies, including the expansion of higher, further, adult, and continuing education.Gordon Marshall (ed) A Dictionary of Sociology (Article: Sociology of Education), Oxford University Press, 1998 Examples of theories of education from sociology include: functionalism, conflict theory, social efficiency, and social mobility. Educational anthropology Educational anthropology is a sub-field of anthropology and is widely associated with the pioneering work of George Spindler. As the name would suggest, the focus of educational anthropology is obviously on education, although an anthropological approach to education tends to focus on the cultural aspects of education, including informal as well as formal education. As education involves understandings of who we are, it is not surprising that the single most recognized dictum of educational anthropology is that the field is centrally concerned with cultural transmission.Comitas, L. and Dolgin, J. 1979. 'On Anthropology and Education: Retrospect and Prospect'. Anthropology and Education Quarterly. 9(1): 87-89 Cultural transmission involves the transfer of a sense of identity between generations, sometimes known as enculturationPage, J.S. Education and Acculturation on Malaita: An Ethnography of Intraethnic and Interethnic Affinities'.The Journal of Intercultural Studies. 1988. #15/16:74-81. and also transfer of identity between cultures, sometimes known as acculturation.Page, J.S.

He owns a Sonoma County Vineyard and wine company producing Carneros Pinot Noir, bottled under the label Verotto. Professional history Police Commissioner Veronese became involved in law enforcement when, upon graduation from UCLA and the San Francisco Police Academy, he was hired by District Attorney Terence Hallinan as the youngest senior criminal investigator in the history of the office. Veronese worked in the fraud bureau and helped develop and enforce a diversion program to prevent the incarceration of poor families. Veronese also led a unit of investigators in the street-level enforcement against food-stamp trafficking for guns and narcotics. Veronese was appointed to the San Francisco Police Commission by Mayor Gavin Newsom in 2004. He has worked to reform the Department through increased transparency and accountability to the public and the communities the department serves. Among other important reforms, Veronese brokered a resolution with the police officers association to release misconduct records to the public without violating the rights of police officers. Under his watch, the police commission adopted the first-ever Early Warning System, a multimillion-dollar system of tracking and correcting police misconduct. The Commission has overseen the hiring of 350 new police officers, an increase of nearly 13% of the force. Veronese has advocated for an increase of foot patrol and a greater community empowerment with the Department. Veronese is currently working with members of the Department to institute the first-ever Green audit and phased mandated involving the City's largest vehicle fleet. He is also currently working to replace the San Francisco's Unified School Districts ROTC program with a Police Recruits program to promote civic involvement of school children and public safety in San Francisco schools. In April 2007, Veronese cast the deciding vote to elect Theresa Sparks as President of San Francisco Police Commission. Sparks became the first transgender head of any city commission in the nation. Civil rights attorney A graduate of the University of San Francisco School of Law, Veronese is a practicing civil rights attorney admitted in all courts in the State of California, United States District Court for the Northern and Eastern Districts of California, Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the United States Supreme Court. He has successfully litigated numerous cases as a partner in the Law Firm of Mayor Joseph Alioto and Angela Alioto. This includes a recent $25 million verdict against Universal Tobacco Leaf Corporation. Civic engagement Veronese was chosen by the Mayor of San Francisco to co-chair the San Francisco - Assisi Sister City Committee. The Committee was created by his grandfather Mayor Joseph L. Alioto in 1968 to develop and maintain San Francisco's relationship with the sister city of Assisi, Italy. In 2001, he was elected Municipal Utility District Director from a field of 23 candidates. This was his first campaign for elective office. In 2005, Veronese was appointed by California Senator John Burton to the California Commission on Criminal Justice. In this capacity, Veronese has focused on reforming marijuana enforcement practices so the state can use tens of millions of federal dollars to reduce guns, gangs, and violent crimes throughout the state. Also in 2005, Veronese called for the city to investigate alleged misuse of public funds by Gary Delagnes, president of the police union, who was taking a yearly police salary of $100,000 while working full-time for the union; Delagnes demanded Mayor Newsom fire Veronese. In April 2006, Veronese was chosen by Mayor Newsom to represent San Francisco in Rome at the consistory that raised William Levada to the cardinalate; Veronese led a delegation of interfaith leaders of every large religious group in San Francisco to Rome and continues to work with religious groups to find common ground on difficult and controversial issues facing San Francisco. During the consistory, Veronese presented the new cardinal with a seal of the city, and was immediately attacked by the Board of Supervisors, who claimed sole right to present the seal, and who took aim at his doing so to Levada, who supports the official Vatican policy that gay couples should not adopt children ‚Äî that both the Supervisors and Mayor Newsom condemn. With the assistance of the CLEAR Project (a San Francisco neighborhood organization committed to strengthening the capacity of young people, parents, seniors and neighborhoods), Veronese helped develop the \\"SAFE Zone\\" program, promoting safe streets for children in the City's crime ridden neighborhoods. Veronese also served on the Board of Directors of the Omega Boys Club.

Fund ratings and indices Lipper Leaders Rating System The Lipper Leaders Rating System is a mutual fund rating system that uses investor-centered criteria, such as capital preservation, expense and consistent return. Funds are rated on a numeric scale of 5 to 1, with ‚Äò5‚Äô representing funds with the highest rating or Lipper Leaders, and ‚Äò1‚Äô representing the lowest rated funds. The Lipper Ratings are derived from formulas that analyze funds against defined criteria. Funds are compared to similar funds within a peer group. Each fund is ranked against its peers based on the metric used (such as Total Return or Expense), and the highest 20% of funds in each peer group are named Lipper Leaders, the next 20% receive a rating of 4, the middle 20% are rated 3, the next 20% are rated 2, and the lowest 20% are rated 1. While Lipper Leader Ratings are not predictive of future performance, they are designed to provide context and perspective for making knowledgeable fund investment decisions. The ratings are subject to change every month and are calculated for the following periods: three-year, five-year, ten-year, and overall. The overall calculation is based on an equal-weighted average of percentile ranks for each metric over three-, five-, and ten-year periods (if applicable). The Lipper Ratings metrics: Total Return, Consistent Return, Preservation, Tax Efficiency (US Only), and Expense Lipper Indices Lipper Indices are a set of benchmarking tools used to track, monitor and analyze fund performance. Several of Lipper‚Äôs 160 indices for the open-end, closed-end, and variable annuity universes track performance since the early 1960s.

The southern , running from Newbury to Hazen's Notch near the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border, were constructed between 1776 and 1779 during the American Revolutionary War. Portions of the road's route are used by modern roads today. The road is named for the principal proponents of its construction. Jacob Bayley and Moses Hazen were among the founders of Newbury and nearby Haverhill, New Hampshire, and Hazen also had property interests at St. John's. The idea for the road featured prominently in several proposals (promoted primarily by Hazen to George Washington and the Second Continental Congress) for invasions of Quebec by Continental Army forces following the failed 1775 invasion. Background After hostilities in the French and Indian War ended in 1760, several veterans of that war founded the communities of Haverhill and Newbury on either side of the Connecticut River in the far north of the British province of New Hampshire. The land on the west side of the river was the subject of disputes between New Hampshire and the province of New York, and was known then as the New Hampshire Grants; this territory eventually became the state of Vermont. First construction Work to develop the road occurred first in 1776. General George Washington, to support the Continental Army's 1775 invasion of Quebec, asked Thomas Johnson, a local landowner, to blaze a trail to St. John's on the Richelieu River near Montreal that army regiments could use to reach the area. On March 26, 1776, Johnson and four men set out through the snow, covering the to St. John's in 11 days. Several Continental Army regiments made their way along this trail that year, prompting Washington to order construction of a road. Jacob Bayley and 60 men constructed, apparently at Bayley's expense, about (into present-day Peacham, Vermont) until rumors arrived that a British army was coming down the trail to stop them. The construction was abandoned amid concerns of invasion in the small communities. (Only a small company of Canadiens came down the trail as far as Peacham.)Wells, pp. 76‚Äì77 It is unclear whether Bayley was ever repaid for this work. Second construction Moses Hazen, then colonel in the Continental Army, was directed by Washington in the spring of 1779 to renew construction of the road. His regiment and that of Colonel Timothy Bedel worked on the road throughout the summer of 1779, extending it through the present-day communities of Cabot, Walden, Hardwick, Greensboro, Craftsbury, Albany, and Lowell. Blockhouses were also constructed along the route, at Peacham, Cabot, Walden, and Greensboro (on a site still called Block House HillJill L. Baker and Patricia L. Haslam, \\"History Space: Search for the Greensboro blockhouse\\", Burlington Free Press, Dec. 9, 2017). Work was abandoned when the road reached the place now known as Hazen's Notch in Westfield, again on rumors that the British were sending a force to stop the construction work. Revolutionary War uses Even after construction was abandoned on the road, the blockhouses on the route were manned, and occasionally subjected to minor skirmishes and scouting actions. The road was apparently identified by the British for use in raiding expeditions in 1780; the raid against Royalton and other small Vermont communities may have included Peacham and nearby communities as targets. Strong local militia may have deterred the raiders from making an attack there. Jacob Bayley was also targeted by the British for kidnapping; at least one attempt was made using the road, which failed as Bayley was alerted to the plan. In 1781, the Greensboro blockhouse was attacked \\"by Indians\\"; two scouts were killed. A memorial stone was erected near the site 160 years later. After the war The road was the only road in the area, and became a route for migration and development of the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont. Little evidence of the original road exists, as much of its route has been taken over by state and local roads, but there have been reports of archaeologists locating isolated sections of corduroy.

These techniques use evidence found in the existing organisational methods of work, documentations, and technology systems that run business processes within an organization. Sometimes, the term Process discovery is used in a narrower sense to mean Task mining, which observes and records millions of human interactions and derive real-time inputs. Business process discovery techniques Business process discovery techniques embody the following properties: * Emergent paradigm - Current methods are based on top-down structured manual interviews relying on second-hand representations of the business process/system behaviors. An automated discovery process relies on collecting data from the information system over a period of time. This data can then be analyzed to form a process model. *Automated process discovery ‚Äì By automating the analysis of the data, the subjectivity of current manual process analysis techniques is removed. The automated system has an ingrained methodology that ‚Äî through repeated trials ‚Äî has been shown to accurately discover processes and process variations without bias. *Accurate information- Since the information is collected from the actual source it cannot be inaccurate, as opposed to gathering it from second party representation. *Complete information - An automated process captures all the information that is occurring within the system and represents them by time, date, user, etc.... Since the information is collected from real-time interactions, it is not subject to lost or selective memory issues. This includes completeness regarding exceptions in the processes. Often, exceptions are treated as statistical ‚Äúnoise,‚Äù which may exclude important inefficiencies in business processes. *Standardized Process - The automated collection of information yields process data which can be grouped, quantified and classified. This supplies a basis for the development and monitoring of both current and new processes, to which benchmarks can be assigned. These benchmarks are the root of both new process design and the determination of problem root cause. Additionally, standardized process data can set the stage for efforts at continuous process improvement. Application / techniques Business Process Discovery complements and builds upon the work in many other fields. *Process discovery is one of the three main types of process mining. The other two types of process mining are conformance checking and model extension/enhancement.Process Mining All of these techniques aim at extracting process related knowledge from event logs. In the case of process discovery, there is no prior process model; the model is discovered based on event logs. Conformance checking aims at finding differences between a given process model and event log. This way it is possible to quantify compliance and analyze discrepancies. Enhancement takes an a priori model and improves or extends it using information from the event log, e.g., show bottlenecks. *Business process discovery is the next level of understanding in the emerging field of business analytics, which allows organizations to view, analyze and adjust the underlying structure and processes that go into day-to-day operations. This discovery includes information gathering of all of the components of a business process, including technology, people, department procedures and protocols. *Business process discovery creates a process master which complements business process analysis (BPA). BPA tools and methodologies are well suited to top-down hierarchical process decomposition, and analysis of to-be processes. BPD provides a bottoms-up analysis that marries to the top- down to provide a complete business process, organized hierarchically by BPA. *Business Intelligence provides organizations with reporting and analytics on the data in their organizations. However, BI has no process model, awareness or analytics. BPD complements BI by providing an explicit process view to current operations, and providing analytics on that process model to help organizations identify and act upon business process inefficiencies, or anomalies. *Web analytics are a limited example of BPD in that web analytics reconstruct the web-user‚Äôs process as they interact with a Web-site. However, these analytics are limited to the process as is contained within the session, from the users perspective and with respect to just the web-based system and process. *Business triage provides a framework for categorizing the processes identified by business process analysis (BPA) based on their relative importance to achieving a stated, measurable goal or outcome. Utilizing the same categories employed by military medical and disaster medical services, business processes are categorized as: **Essential/critical (red process) - Process essential for achieving outcomes/goals **Important/urgent (yellow process) - Process which speeds achieving outcomes/goals **Optional/supportive (green process) - Process not needed to achieve outcomes/goals Resources are allocated based on the process category with resources first dedicated to red processes, then yellow processes and finally green processes. In the event that resources become limited, resources are first withheld from Green Processes, then Yellow Processes. Resources are only withheld from Red Processes if failure to achieve outcomes/goals is acceptable. The purpose / example A small example may illustrate the Business Process Discovery technology that is required today. Automated Business Process Discovery tools capture the required data, and transform it into a structured dataset for the actual diagnosis; A major challenge is the grouping of repetitive actions from the users into meaningful events. Next, these Business process discovery tools propose probabilistic process models. Probabilistic behavior is essential for the analysis and the diagnosis of the processes. The following shows an example where a probabilistic repair-process is recovered from user actions. The ‚Äúas-is‚Äù process model shows exactly where the pain is in this business. Five percent faulty repairs is a bad sign, but worse, the repetitive fixes that are needed to complete those repairs are cumbersome. Business Process Discovery Example A deeper analysis of the ‚Äúas-is‚Äù process data may reveal which are the faulty parts that are responsible for the overall behavior in this example. It may lead to the discovery of subgroups of repairs that actually need management focus for improvement. Business Process Comprehend In this case, it would become obvious that the faulty parts are also responsible for the repetitive fixes. Similar applications have been documented, such as a Healthcare Insurance Provider case where in 4 months the ROI of Business Process Analysis was earned from precisely comprehending its claims handling process and discovering the faulty parts. History *Business intelligence (BI) emerged more than 20 years ago and is critical for reporting what is happening within an organization‚Äôs systems. Yet current BI applications and data mining technologies are not always suited for evaluating the level of detail required to analyze unstructured data and the human dynamics of business processes. *Six Sigma and other quantitative approaches to business process improvement have been employed for over a decade with varying degrees of success. A major limitation to the success of these approaches is the availability of accurate data to form the basis of the analysis. With BPD, many six-sigma organizations are finding the ability to extend their analysis into major business processes effectively. *Process mining According to researchers at Eindhoven University of Technology, (PM) emerged as a scientific discipline around 1990 when techniques like the Alpha algorithm made it possible to extract process models (typically represented as Petri nets) from event logs. Criticisms have emerged pointing out that Process Mining is no more than a set of algorithms which solves a specific and simple business problem: business process discovery and auxiliary evaluation methods. Today, there are over 100 process mining algorithms that are able to discover process models that also include concurrency, e.g., genetic process discovery techniques, heuristic mining algorithms, region-based mining algorithms, and fuzzy mining algorithms.

It was also a significant intervention in the debate over the state of modern music, and was frequently referred to in subsequent writings on the subject of the relationship between music and political and social change. The conference was organised by the Syndicate of Czech Composers, which was founded on 20 February 1946, and had also arranged the spring music festival known as Prague Spring International Music Festival since 1946, and the First Congress of Composers and Music critics. The Proclamation of the Conference later became known as 'The Prague Manifesto' The conference was attended by around 70 musicians, composers, and music critics from 14 countries, including the British composers Alan Bush and Bernard Stevens. It was also attended by the German composer and philosopher Hanns Eisler who delivered a lecture on 'Basic Social Questions of Modern Music'. He declared that \\"After all the excesses and experiments, it appears today to be the job of music of our time to lead music back to a higher form of society, to lead it back from the private to the universal\\" Hans Eisler Basic Social Questions of Modern Music in A Rebel in Music ed. Manfred Grabs (1978) The Conference aimed to offer solutions to what participants saw a crisis in modern music. Problems were summed up under three headingsAlan Bush, 'The Second International Congress of Composers and Music Critics', Musical Times, Vol. 89, No. 1267. (Sep., 1948), pp. 280-281. *'The Structure and Expression of Modern Music' *'Functions of Serious and Light Music' *'Problems of Music criticism Today' The Prague Manifesto offered a set of principles for composers, which involved avoiding extreme subjectivism and allying themselves more closely with their national cultures. It also called for composers to focus on music that could have concrete content, such as opera, oratorio, and songs. Although the proclamation echoes the 1948 Conference of Composers in the Soviet Union, and the Zhdanov Doctrine, the notion that the Soviet delegates dictated the outcome has been challenged.Milo≈° J≈Øzl, 'Music and the Totalitarian Regime in Czechoslovakia', International Review of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music, Vol. 27, No. 1.

The Prague Manifesto forced thinkers outside Czechoslovakia to confront aesthetic and ideological issues.Mark Caroll, Music and Ideology in Cold War Europe (Cambridge University Press, 2003) It was criticised by Theodor Adorno in his Die Gengangelte Musik. It was also discussed by Sartre in his introduction to Rene Leibowitz' 'The Artist and His conscience'.

He batted and threw left-handed.Pitching Splits, Batter Matchups, Daily pitching logs at Retrosheet and daily pitching gamelogs at Baseball-Reference.com. From slugger to pitcher Harshman was born in San Diego, California, in 1927. He began his professional career at the age of 17 in 1945 for the San Diego Padres of the minor league AA Pacific Coast League. For his first five seasons, Harshman was being conditioned to be a major league hitter instead of a pitcher. Harshman's short stint in San Diego ended with a .254 batting average in 67 at-bats. In 1946, Harshman moved over to the Class C Modesto Reds, where he hit .288 in 56 games before being shipped back to the PCL San Diego squad for only 3 games. 1947 was his first busy season as he played in 151 games for the Victoria Athletics in the Western International League. Harshman smashed 36 home runs while batting a modest .306. He then moved up yet again to the San Diego squad for just 11 games and a poor .148 average. Despite the sluggish ending, the major league New York Giants purchased his contract as a first baseman in December 1947. In 1948, Harshman went to the Jersey City Giants of the AAA International League. He hit 24 home runs, drove in 76 runs, and batted .245. He received a brief call-up to the Giants and batted .250 in 9 plate appearances. 1949 was a breakout year for the 21-year- old slugger. In 150 games for the AA Minneapolis Millers, Harshman smashed 40 home runs and had 111 RBI. 1950 saw an unexpected change in Jack's progression. He batted a terrible .193 in 35 games for the Class A Jacksonville Tars and a below average .230 for Minneapolis. His second MLB stint with the Giants went even worse, batting just .125 in 32 at bats. It was around this point that management thought about changing Harshman's role in the organization. During his sluggish 1950 season, he was brought in to pitch two games for the Jacksonville Tars. He threw for 12 innings and a 6.75 ERA, splitting his 2 games for a 1‚Äì1 record. In 1951 Harshman got back on track with his slugging career. In 154 games for the Nashville Volunteers, he crashed 47 home runs with a fair .251 average. However, his manager once again experimented with Jack potentially being a pitcher, letting him take the field in 5 games. He posted another 1‚Äì1 record, but lowered his ERA to 3.94. Despite bringing a huge bat in the previous season, the decision was made to give Harshman double duty as a pitcher and occasional utility hitter. He batted .222 with 8 home runs and 15 RBI in just 135 at bats, but most of his work for the 1952 season came from on the mound. Harshman pitched in 26 games with 14 starts, threw a total of 131 innings with 78 strikeouts, a 4.67 ERA, and an average 6‚Äì7 win-loss record. 1953 was Harshman's breakout year. In the AA Southern Association Nashville Volunteers, Jack posted a remarkable 23‚Äì7 record with a 3.27 ERA. Chicago White Sox Despite his successful transition from a first baseman slugger to a young phenom pitcher, the Giants allowed the Chicago White Sox to purchase Harshman's contract. Jack made his White Sox debut against the Cleveland Indians on April 14, 1954. He started the game, but only lasted 3 innings after being tagged for four earned runs on eight hits. After another ineffective start on April 19, Harshman was demoted to the bullpen. He continued to struggle until being given another start on June 6. He responded by throwing a seven-hit shutout against the Washington Senators. On July 25, he struck out 16 Red Sox hitters, including Ted Williams in a complete game for a 5‚Äì2 win. At the time, it was the most strikeouts in the long history of Fenway Park. The record would stand for 32 years until a young flamethrower named Roger Clemens fanned a Major League best 20 batters. After that, Harshman settled down and had a largely successful season overall, including an exceptional performance for the month of August. Jack posted a 6‚Äì0 record with 47 strikeouts and a microscopic 0.77 ERA. His first full season posted some impressive numbers: a 14‚Äì8 won-loss record, a 2.95 ERA, four shutouts, and 134 strikeouts, the latter of which was fifth in the American League. Harshman found moderate success in the 1955 season by putting up an 11‚Äì7 record and a 3.36 ERA while finishing ninth in the AL in strikeouts with 116. On June 21, 1956, at Comiskey Park, Jack achieved a rarity in Major League Baseball that had only happened twice before in the modern era. Both he and the opposing Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher Connie Johnson threw a one-hit complete game. Harshman picked up the win, 1-0. Jack would go on to throw three more shutouts in the season, compiling a 15‚Äì12 record with a 3.10 ERA and 143 strikeouts, good enough for eighth in the league. Baltimore Orioles The 1956 season turned out to be the last solid campaign for Harshman. Following an 8‚Äì8 season with the 1957 White Sox, Harshman, Larry Doby and Jim Marshall were traded to the Baltimore Orioles for Billy Goodman, Tito Francona and Ray Moore at the Winter meetings. When it was discovered by the Orioles that Harshman was suffering from a slipped disc, Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick ordered the Chisox to send either $20,000 or an acceptable player to the Orioles. Russ Heman was sent to Baltimore to complete this deal. In 1958, many of Harshman's numbers improved. His ERA was a career- low 2.89, third best in the AL, and he compiled a career-high 161 strikeouts to go with three shutouts. However, run support was scarce and he ended the season with a 12‚Äì15 record. Boston Red Sox and Cleveland Indians Harshman became a journeyman in 1959, playing for three different teams during the season. Harshman began with an 0‚Äì6 record and a 6.85 ERA before being traded to the Boston Red Sox for Billy Hoeft on June 15, 1959. Harshman would only spend one month with the Red Sox, going 2‚Äì3 with a 6.57 ERA in two starts and six relief appearances. The Cleveland Indians bought Harshman's contract on July 30, 1959. Over the remainder of the season, he posted a 5‚Äì1 record to go with a 2.59 ERA in 66 innings of work. The 1960 season would prove to be the last for Harshman in the majors. At the age of 32, his back problems were catching up with him. He was forced onto the disabled list on April 24 after checking into the Cleveland Lakeside Hospital to treat problems connected to slipped discs. It would take three months before he would take the mound again. Right from the start, he could not regain his groove. On July 24, the Red Sox scored five runs on three hits and four walks before Harshman was pulled after three innings. He would never get back on track, ending his final season with a 2‚Äì4 record and a 3.98 ERA. In October, Harshman was released by the Indians. In 1961, Jack participated in spring training in an effort to make the Los Angeles Angels roster, but instead ended up with a familiar team from his first professional year, the AAA Pacific Coast League San Diego Padres. He would go on to pitch in only four games, compiling a 0‚Äì1 record and a 6.00 ERA. Death On August 17, 2013, Harshman died in Georgetown, Texas where he lived. He was 86 years old. He was buried at the Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in San Diego. Personal life Harshman was married to his wife, Virginia. He had three sisters and one brother. He was related to the actress Margo Harshman, and former Washington State University and University of Washington basketball coach Marv Harshman. Jack has a daughter Patricia \\"Patty\\" Michaels (n√©e Harshman) born in 1947. And three grandsons, Michael \\"Mike\\" Lydon, Charlie Lydon, and Johnny Lydon.

It was published in Britain as Enemy Combatant: A British Muslim's Journey To Guantanamo and Back (), and in the US as Enemy Combatant: My Imprisonment at Guantanamo, Bagram, and Kandahar (). In the US, the foreword was written by David Ignatius of The Washington Post. Begg was seized by Pakistani officers in Islamabad in February 2002, turned over to the U.S., and after prolonged sessions of interrogation, he was released from detention on 25 January 2005. According to statements made by the U.S. military, Begg was an enemy combatant and al-Qaeda member, who recruited others for al-Qaeda, provided money and support to al-Qaeda training camps, received extensive military training in al-Qaeda-run terrorist training camps in Afghanistan, and who was prepared to fight U.S. or allied troops. Begg admits having spent time at two non-al-Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan in the 1990s, having supported Muslim fighters in Bosnia and Chechnya, and that he had \\"thought about\\" taking up arms in Chechnya. Also, that he had previously met people who have since been linked to terrorism (Khalil al-Deek, Dhiren Barot, and Shahid Akram Butt), but he denies ever having trained for, aided, carried out or planned any acts of terrorism. Critical reception The book received praise in Britain for Begg‚Äôs \\"outstanding liberality of mind and evenhandedness toward his captors\\". Writing in The Guardian, Philippe Sands said: \\"The humour and warmth are striking\\", \\"it has affection ... It has humour ... It has insight ... And it has restraint: the flashes of anger .... are in exceptional contrast to the measured understatement of his own \\"relatively uneventful\\" treatment at Guant√°namo\\". Sands concluded the book \\"should be required reading for those who created this dangerous mess, starting with Messrs Bush, Cheney, Gonzales and Rumsfeld\\". In The Independent, Yasmin Alibhai-Brown compared the book to the \\"Holocaust testimonies\\" of Primo levi and Rabbi Hugo Gryn, saying that Begg \\"writes with the same authenticity and conveys horror without hyperbole\\". Speaking of the detention centre guards, she says \\"the best parts of Begg's book are those which humanise these operatives and attempt to understand their confusion and corruption. He sees the absurdity of their situation\\". Of Begg himself she says: \\"this bearded Brummie has an indestructible soul that you feel as you read his account\\", but, \\"for a man of intellect and deep faith, he does at times appear perilously impulsive\\". It received mixed reviews in the US, Publishers Weekly described it as \\"a fast- paced, harrowing narrative\\".\\"Enemy Combatant: My Imprisonment at Guantanamo, Bagram and Kandahar. (Book review)\\", Publishers Weekly, 19 July 2006. Retrieved 22 February 2010 John Sifton, a New York-based official from Human Rights Watch, said: \\"Much of the Moazzam Begg story is consistent with other accounts of detention conditions in both Afghanistan and Guantanamo\\". Jonathan Raban, reviewing the book for The New York Review of Books, wrote: \\"The gaps in his story ‚Äî and they're more frustrating than downright suspicious ‚Äî cease at the moment when Begg enters captivity\\". Raban criticised some \\"notably talentless\\" dialogue writing: \\"Perhaps Begg really did strike up a warm relationship with soldier Jennifer ‚Ä¶ but only in bad fiction do people speak this way\\". Finally concluding: \\"There can be no doubt about the reality of the predicament described by Moazzam Begg ‚Ä¶ the indiscriminate dragnet thrown out by the United States ‚Ä¶ brought in a catch that included many bystanders who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and whose single common denominator was that they were Muslims\\" The New York Times reported \\"some notable gaps in Mr. Begg's memoir\\", such as not mentioning his arrest in 1994 for alleged fraud.

It is a pure comedy with Hyderabadi touch which happens in every city, village.  Plot  It all starts out in Old City, Hyderabad. In an alley, Suri, Ajju Tehzab's right-hand man, is selling drugs to a \\"party\\", in Mama's territory. One of Mama's men, is eating while taking guard of Mama's territory while Mama is away. He sees Suri and walks over to him. They both start fighting, when Mama enters. Mama starts beating up Suri, and he runs away. Once back in Mangalat, Suri tells Ajju Tehzab that Mama and his men beat him up, slightly exaggerating to make it seem worse. Ajju Tehzab replies, while playing Carom, that he will take care of Mama. Hanif Bhai is introduced in the movie. Rumors say that before he was a store owner, he used to be a chicken thief. While cutting chicken, his friend, Sajid Bhai comes along. While talking with Sajid Bhai, Hanif Bhai asks about his sons. Sajid Bhai replies that his sons, Arif and Anwar, are returning soon after five years of studying in America. Hanif Bhai, interested, asks when he is getting his sons married, and Sajid Bhai replies that he is getting them married if he finds good matches for them, and tells Hanif Bhai to inform him is he has any matches in mind. Munna is introduced now, sitting in front of a girls college. Some of the first comedy is introduced in this scene, when Munna teases a girl, and the girl calls him a name, and Munna says a funny comeback. After that, a prank takes place. This prank goes through the whole movie. One of Munna's classmates come to him and tells him that he teased his girl. Munna remembers and asks for the classmate's phone saying that his is out of battery. His classmate lends him the phone, and Munna dials a random number, and says \\"Is Farha there,\\" knowing that the man on the other side of the line will get irritated because of the random calls. The man on the other line swears every word he says. Munna cuts the line and gives it to his classmate and says that connection is bad. Later on while Munna is driving away on his bike, someone calls the classmates phone, and when the classmate, naturally confused, picks up the phone, he hears all these swears being yelled at him. After Munna, his friend, Pappu is introduced. Pappu is a ticket blacker in front of a very busy theater. He doesn't just want to sell the two tickets he has, he wants to sell them to girls more than boys, so that he and Munna can sit on the two seats next to them. When two men come seeking two tickets, he says he will sell for 120 rupees. The two men ask if they can buy it in 100 rupees, because they don't they have 50 rupees, and no change. Pappu tells them that he won't sell and that they look like royal beggars. Later on, two ladies come to buy the same tickets, and Pappu asks for the 120 rupees. They also say the same thing as the men, and Pappu gives them the tickets for 100 rupees. The two previous men are watching, and go to deal with Pappu. Again, Pappu insults them and tells them to leave, when Munna comes. Munna and Pappu both go to the theaters. There is a small introduction for Hanif Bhai's two daughter's, Reshma and Najma. Reshma is shown stealing money from the pocket of her own dad. Nazma is shown reading a Filmfare magazine and eating chips, when her mom calls her to do some work. Najma's reply is that she is to busy working on \\"college reports\\" and she complains about all the work she has to do. Hanif Bhai wants his daughters to marry rich NRI Indians, but Reshma and Najma love Munna and Pappu, and their dad doesn't know that. Munna loves Reshma and Reshma loves Munna. Pappu loves Najma, but Pappu doesn't know if Najma feels the same about him. In front of the same girl's college, Pappu tells Najma how he feels about her and that he loves her, and runs away. Later on, you see Najma kiss the rose that Pappu handed her, indicating that she loves him too. Characters Munna and Pappu - Two lower-class boys who are best friends. Munna (Mast Ali) is a \\"road side romeo type\\", who sits on his motorbike in front of a college waiting for girls to pass by so he can impress them. Pappu (Aziz Naser), is a ticket blacker who blacks tickets in front of a packed theater. He sells two tickets to girls mostly, so that he and Munna can sit on the other seats. Hanif Bhai and Daughters - Hanif Bhai (Dheer Charan Shrivastav) Murgiwalay is a slightly old man who owns a chicken store, where he sells faulty chickens. His store is located in Old City, Hyderabad, near the Charminar. He has two daughters, Reshma (Vandana Gupta) and Nazma (Stuti Misra), who are in their late teens and early twenties. Reshma robs her own house, and Nazma is very lazy. Hanif Bhai wants to get his daughters married to rich N.R.I. Indians. Pappu and Munna usually call him \\"bhudda\\" (oldie). Ajju Tehzab - Ajju Tehzab (Hari) is a mafia don who is known for throwing acid on peoples faces. Unfortunately, one day he also got acid on his own face. He has his den in Mangalhut, and there is where he is always found. He sits in his den playing carrom. Arif and Anwar - who make their appearance later on in the movie, have supposedly came to India after 5 years in America, but have really spent five years in Chanchalguda Jail. Their dad, Sajid Bhai (Baba Khan), is a good friend of Hanif Bhai and Hanif Bhai agrees to give his two daughter hands to marry Arif (Raghu Karumanchi) and Anwar (Basha). Mama and Shiva - Gopal Yadav alias Mama (R.K), is another mafia don who has his den in Dhulphet. He is partly Telugu speaking. He has a few controversies with Ajju Tehzab.

This theorem answers the question for the negative case of which surfaces in \\\\mathbb{R}^{3} can be obtained by isometrically immersing complete manifolds with constant curvature. History *Hilbert's theorem was first treated by David Hilbert in, \\"√úber Fl√§chen von konstanter Kr√ºmmung\\" (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 2 (1901), 87-99). *A different proof was given shortly after by E.

Proof The proof of Hilbert's theorem is elaborate and requires several lemmas. The idea is to show the nonexistence of an isometric immersion :\\\\varphi = \\\\psi \\\\circ \\\\exp_p: S' \\\\longrightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^{3} of a plane S' to the real space \\\\mathbb{R}^{3}. This proof is basically the same as in Hilbert's paper, although based in the books of Do Carmo and Spivak. Observations: In order to have a more manageable treatment, but without loss of generality, the curvature may be considered equal to minus one, K=-1. There is no loss of generality, since it is being dealt with constant curvatures, and similarities of \\\\mathbb{R}^{3} multiply K by a constant. The exponential map \\\\exp_p: T_p(S) \\\\longrightarrow S is a local diffeomorphism (in fact a covering map, by Cartan-Hadamard theorem), therefore, it induces an inner product in the tangent space of S at p: T_p(S). Furthermore, S' denotes the geometric surface T_p(S) with this inner product. If \\\\psi:S \\\\longrightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^{3} is an isometric immersion, the same holds for :\\\\varphi = \\\\psi \\\\circ \\\\exp_o:S' \\\\longrightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^{3}. The first lemma is independent from the other ones, and will be used at the end as the counter statement to reject the results from the other lemmas. Lemma 1: The area of S' is infinite. Proof's Sketch: The idea of the proof is to create a global isometry between H and S'. Then, since H has an infinite area, S' will have it too. The fact that the hyperbolic plane H has an infinite area comes by computing the surface integral with the corresponding coefficients of the First fundamental form. To obtain these ones, the hyperbolic plane can be defined as the plane with the following inner product around a point q\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{2} with coordinates (u,v) :E = \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial u}, \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial u} \\\\right\\\\rangle = 1 \\\\qquad F = \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial u}, \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial v} \\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial v}, \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial u} \\\\right\\\\rangle = 0 \\\\qquad G = \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial v}, \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial v} \\\\right\\\\rangle = e^{u} Since the hyperbolic plane is unbounded, the limits of the integral are infinite, and the area can be calculated through :\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{u} du dv = \\\\infty Next it is needed to create a map, which will show that the global information from the hyperbolic plane can be transfer to the surface S', i.e. a global isometry. \\\\varphi: H \\\\rightarrow S' will be the map, whose domain is the hyperbolic plane and image the 2-dimensional manifold S', which carries the inner product from the surface S with negative curvature. \\\\varphi will be defined via the exponential map, its inverse, and a linear isometry between their tangent spaces, :\\\\psi:T_p(H) \\\\rightarrow T_{p'}(S'). That is :\\\\varphi = \\\\exp_{p'} \\\\circ \\\\psi \\\\circ \\\\exp_p^{-1}, where p\\\\in H, p' \\\\in S'. That is to say, the starting point p\\\\in H goes to the tangent plane from H through the inverse of the exponential map. Then travels from one tangent plane to the other through the isometry \\\\psi, and then down to the surface S' with another exponential map. The following step involves the use of polar coordinates, (\\\\rho, \\\\theta) and (\\\\rho', \\\\theta'), around p and p' respectively. The requirement will be that the axis are mapped to each other, that is \\\\theta=0 goes to \\\\theta'=0. Then \\\\varphi preserves the first fundamental form. In a geodesic polar system, the Gaussian curvature K can be expressed as :K = - \\\\frac{(\\\\sqrt{G})_{\\\\rho \\\\rho}}{\\\\sqrt{G}}. In addition K is constant and fulfills the following differential equation :(\\\\sqrt{G})_{\\\\rho \\\\rho} + K\\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{G} = 0 Since H and S' have the same constant Gaussian curvature, then they are locally isometric (Minding's Theorem). That means that \\\\varphi is a local isometry between H and S'. Furthermore, from the Hadamard's theorem it follows that \\\\varphi is also a covering map. Since S' is simply connected, \\\\varphi is a homeomorphism, and hence, a (global) isometry. Therefore, H and S' are globally isometric, and because H has an infinite area, then S'=T_p(S) has an infinite area, as well. \\\\square Lemma 2: For each p\\\\in S' exists a parametrization x:U \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\\\longrightarrow S', \\\\qquad p \\\\in x(U), such that the coordinate curves of x are asymptotic curves of x(U) = V' and form a Tchebyshef net. Lemma 3: Let V' \\\\subset S' be a coordinate neighborhood of S' such that the coordinate curves are asymptotic curves in V'. Then the area A of any quadrilateral formed by the coordinate curves is smaller than 2\\\\pi. The next goal is to show that x is a parametrization of S'. Lemma 4: For a fixed t, the curve x(s,t), -\\\\infty < s < +\\\\infty , is an asymptotic curve with s as arc length. The following 2 lemmas together with lemma 8 will demonstrate the existence of a parametrization x:\\\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\\\longrightarrow S' Lemma 5: x is a local diffeomorphism. Lemma 6: x is surjective. Lemma 7: On S' there are two differentiable linearly independent vector fields which are tangent to the asymptotic curves of S'. Lemma 8: x is injective. Proof of Hilbert's Theorem: First, it will be assumed that an isometric immersion from a complete surface S with negative curvature exists: \\\\psi:S \\\\longrightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^{3} As stated in the observations, the tangent plane T_p(S) is endowed with the metric induced by the exponential map \\\\exp_p: T_p(S) \\\\longrightarrow S . Moreover, \\\\varphi = \\\\psi \\\\circ \\\\exp_p:S' \\\\longrightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^{3} is an isometric immersion and Lemmas 5,6, and 8 show the existence of a parametrization x:\\\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\\\longrightarrow S' of the whole S', such that the coordinate curves of x are the asymptotic curves of S'. This result was provided by Lemma 4. Therefore, S' can be covered by a union of \\"coordinate\\" quadrilaterals Q_{n} with Q_{n} \\\\subset Q_{n+1}. By Lemma 3, the area of each quadrilateral is smaller than 2 \\\\pi . On the other hand, by Lemma 1, the area of S' is infinite, therefore has no bounds. This is a contradiction and the proof is concluded. \\\\square See also  * Nash embedding theorem, states that every Riemannian manifold can be isometrically embedded into some Euclidean space.

In 2000 it was named the Sunday Times millennium Small Publisher of the Year. Four of its authors have received Nobel Prizes, nine have received the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry, and six have received Pulitzer Prizes, among many other honours. Carcanet publishes a comprehensive and diverse list of modern and classic poetry in English and in translation. History Carcanet was originally a literary magazine, founded in 1962. Michael Hind, a member of the original editorial board, recalls how the idea was to 'collect together and publish as a periodical poetry, short fiction, and \\"intelligent criticism of all the arts\\"; there were to be both student and senior members' contributions.' The intention was to link Oxford and Cambridge universities. Its name is an English word which means \\"a collar of jewels\\", diminutive of \\"carcan\\" (an obsolete word for a collar used for punishment), pronounced \\"kar'ka- net\\".Davidson, Thomas & Geddie, J. Liddell (1901) Chambers's Twentieth Century Dictionary of the English Language. London: W. & R. Chambers; p. 140. (A much earlier use of the word was in The Carcanet, an anthology published in 1828.) The magazine Carcanet had fallen on hard times by October 1967 when Michael Schmidt, a newly arrived undergraduate at Wadham College, Oxford, took it over. In 1969 as a swansong the magazine produced a few pamphlets: poetry by new writers from Britain, India and the United States, and a book of translations. The reviews were encouraging, and in 1970‚Äì71 Carcanet Press became Ltd, leaving South Hinksey, Oxford, for Manchester. Carcanet enjoys Arts Council England support. Its list includes, alongside new writers from all over the world, major authors from the twentieth and earlier centuries. Location Carcanet was conceived at Pin Farm, South Hinksey, Oxford, in 1969 by Peter Jones, Gareth Reeves and Michael Schmidt, and Grevel Lindop was instrumental in suggesting the Fyfield Books series. In 1971, when Michael Schmidt was appointed Gulbenkian Writing Fellow at the University of Manchester, Carcanet moved to 266 Councillor Lane, Cheadle Hulme, Cheshire, and in 1975 it came of age, taking a tiny suite of offices in the Corn Exchange, Manchester. However, the 1996 Manchester bombing impacted heavily on the workings of Carcanet Press, forcing it to move to temporary offices in Manchester House, Princess Street, and then across the river Irwell to Blackfriars Street, Salford, where it stayed for six years before moving back into the centre of Manchester. It now resides in Cross Street.  Imprints  Besides the main poetry list, Carcanet is also home to a diverse set of imprints: The Oxford Poets imprint, formerly the poetry list of Oxford University Press, was established in March 1999. The Fyfield Books imprint includes selections from the great European and American classics from ancient to modern times. Carcanet also publish a range of inventive fiction and literary criticism alongside the Lives and Letters series and the Aspects of Portugal imprint.

His research concluded that these measures may not have been necessary. Herndon proved that the paper contained multiple errors, provoking widespread international interest and embarrassment for austerity policymakers. The Reinhart‚ÄìRogoff paper was frequently cited during the 2012 U.S. presidential election campaign. It was also frequently cited among policymakers in congress, including in the drafting of the Bowles-Simpson report. However, there are differing views on the actual impact the original paper may have had on policy making. The findings have been described as \\"shocking\\" and as having rocked the economics world. Publications such as The Washington Post had for several years taken the conclusions of the Reinhart‚ÄìRogoff paper as an \\"economic consensus view.\\" New York magazine wrote that Herndon \\"just used part of his spring semester to shake the intellectual foundation of the global austerity movement.\\" Discovery of flaws in \\"Growth in a Time of Debt\\" During his graduate studies in a class with Professor Michael Ash, Herndon was assigned to pick an economics paper and try to replicate the results. He chose \\"Growth in a Time of Debt\\", and throughout the semester his attempts to replicate the results proved unsuccessful. After further consultation with his professors Michael Ash and Robert Pollin, Herndon was encouraged to contact the authors Reinhart and Rogoff at Harvard. They provided him with the actual working spreadsheet they had used to obtain their results. Herndon looked into the detail of the original spreadsheet and found several issues: *The authors had accidentally only included 15 of the 20 countries under analysis in their key calculation (having excluded Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada and Denmark); *For some countries, some data was missing; *The methodology to average out performance of countries of different sizes was called into question. For example, one bad year for New Zealand, was weighted equally with the United Kingdom, a major global economy with nearly 20 years of high public debt. Reinhart and Rogoff have defended the high weight given to New Zealand's economy in 1951, but even granting this point fully, grave doubts are still placed on the major Reinhart‚ÄìRogoff results. The basic conclusion that countries with indebtedness rates above 90% of GDP have lower growth rates still held, but the most spectacular results disappeared, the relationship was much gentler and there were numerous exceptions to the rule. These results were published on 15 April 2013 as a draft working paper, and in 2014 in the peer-reviewed Cambridge Journal of Economics.

Delanty was born in Cork City, Ireland, and is generally placed in the Irish tradition, though he is also considered a Vermont and US poet appearing in various significant US anthologies. He lives for most of the year in America, where he is the poet in residence at Saint Michael's College, Vermont. He became an American citizen in 1994, retaining his Irish citizenship. He is a Past President of the Association of Literary Scholars, Critics, and Writers. Irish novelist Colum McCann, who has himself resettled in America, has described Delanty as the poet laureate of the contemporary Irish-in-America: ‚ÄúDelanty has catalogued an entire generation and its relationship to exile. He is the laureate of those who have gone.‚Äù Greg Delanty attended University College Cork (UCC) where he was taught by Sean Lucy and John Montague (poet) and was among a talented group of writers who emerged at the university in that period, including Maurice Riordan, Gregory O'Donoghue, Thomas McCarthy (poet), William Wall (writer), Gerry Murphy (poet), and Se√°n Dunne (poet). Equally important to him, were the poets who wrote in Irish, in UCC, such as Liam √ì Muirthile, Nuala N√≠ Dhomhnaill, Louis DePaor and Colm Breathnach. At UCC Delanty edited the university magazine Quarryman and published his first poems in The Cork Examiner. As an editor of two issues of Quarryman he published poems by poets writing in Irish (without translation) and English, and was the first to do so in Ireland. He also solicited poems not just from fellow students but well known poets throughout Ireland and beyond, such as Seamus Heaney, Paul Durcan, Edwin Morgan (poet) and David Gascoyne. As the entry on Delanty states in The Oxford Companion to Modern Poetry (second edition) and which is true of his work up to 2008: In 1983, Delanty received the distinguished Patrick Kavanagh Poetry Award (given to an Irish poet who has not previously published a book), and in 1986 his first full-length work, Cast in the Fire (Dolmen Press) appeared. That same year he received the Allan Dowling Poetry Fellowship, judged by Christopher Ricks, the award of $20,000 stipulated that he had to travel to the United States for a brief period. Since 1987, Delanty has been associated with Saint Michael College, Vermont, initially as a teacher and currently as poet-in- residence. It is here that his poems began to explore the themes of exile and family which would dominate his later work. His collection American Wake (Blackstaff, 1995), which envisions a fifth Irish province ‚Äòwhere all exiles naturally land‚Äô, was followed by The Hellbox (Oxford University Press, 1998), whose title alludes to the printing trade to which his father had devoted his life. The Blind Stitch (Carcanet, 2001), extends the geography of Delanty's poems to include India, and was followed by The Ship of Birth (Carcanet Press, 2007), a collection inspired by fatherhood and committed to ‚Äòaffirming the sustaining continuity of life‚Äô. Collected Poems 1986-2006 was published by Carcanet/Oxford Poets in 2006. Among other entries on Greg Delanty are The Oxford Companion to Irish Literature (Oxford University Press, 1996) and The Encyclopedia of the Irish in America (Notre Dame University Press, 1999).‚Äù After Delanty‚Äôs Collected Poems 1986-2006 (Carcanet Press, 2006) he has expanded his range both in form and content especially with his latest book of poems The Greek Anthology, Book XVII (Oxford Poets of Carcanet Press, England, 2012), which was released in the U.S. in 2015 as Book Seventeen (LSU Press). In an interview with the Poetry Society that took place when the Carcanet edition was published he was asked about this book: PS: I don't know very much about The Greek Anthology. Would you tell me something about it, how the idea came together and what appealed to you so much about it? GD': The original Greek Anthology is made up of sixteen books of short poems attributed to many different authors, ranging from the seventh century BC to the tenth century AD. The poems are amatory, religious, dedicatory, humorous, sepulchral, hortatory, declamatory, and satirical. My own book, The Greek Anthology, Book XVII adds a modern fictional book to the original sixteen and is similar in its range of tone and variety of subject matter. The poets of this book are fictional creations based often on myself. All the poems were written out of myself, my preoccupations over ten years or so‚Äîlater, where possible, I put the names of other poets, family, friends and acquaintances‚Äîfor fun, for a laugh really. My poems are for all those who are close to me and for whom poetry is important. You will recognize among these imaginary authors variants on the names of well known poets of our day such as Heanius who dedicated a poem in his own most recent book, Human Chain, to one Gregory of Corkus another poet in The Greek Anthology, Book XVII. These poets and poems give a sense of having already existed in another tradition and another language, a kind of parallel universe of our past and present and future. It may also have allowed me to talk about things or approach things that would have been more difficult or impossible in my own direct voice, say like the political poem ‚ÄòNew Ostia‚Äô, or the erotic love poems. I tried to conjure old and new ways of looking at our contemporary world. It is also an obvious way of renewing, talking about our world in all the different ways we are in it. Other poetry collections include The New Citizen Army (Combat Paper Press), which was a book of political poems concerned with war and climate change and the general complicity of our modern lives. The covers of this book were actually made from pulped uniforms of US soldiers and the whole book was designed and produced by US military veterans. The next book Loosestrife (Fomite, Burlington, Vermont, 2011) is a progression from that edition and has many of the same poems in it. Many of the poems in both The New Citizen Army and Loosestrife were actually taken from his previous books of poems. He is the lead poet in the anthology So Little Time: Words and Images for a World in Climate Crisis, (Green Writers Press, Vermont 2014). The book originally was to be set around Delanty's own poems, via a suggestion to the Publisher by the environmentalist Bill McKibben, and Delanty in turn suggested that other poets be asked also, and many of the poets included were invited by him. As he says himself in the Preface to that book: All my own poems included here were written over a period of twenty-five years. Many have appeared in other collections. They were written while I was writing other poems arising out of whatever was preoccupying me at the time‚Äîwhether it was my parents, love, marriage, the birth of my son, or baseball. Since I have also always been preoccupied with what is going on in the world, naturally, I wrote poems out of my own public concerns, though I never think of them as either public or private. Maybe the only thing that makes a poem public is that it is published for the public to read. What is important for the poet is that the poem works as art firstly, that the poem is not overwhelmed by the artist on a soap box. It is only when art issues from the genuine, that the work is truthful and nourishing. Even the darkest art lifts the spirit. It releases something trapped in us so that we can breathe more easily. Bill McKibben in his envoy to So Little Time writes: ‚ÄúThe great Vermont poet Greg Delanty, who contributes the bulk of the writing in this extraordinary volume, came here, like many of Vermont‚Äôs writers, from away. But in this place of field and forest, small enough in scale, with the pastoral and the raw wild backing up against each other, so many writers and photographers have found a reassuring sense of the turning of the wheel, the passing ofone season into the next.‚Äù To quote from The Sunday Times ‚ÄúGreg Delanty‚Äôs poems are a subtle combination of political activism and private contemplation.‚Äù ‚Äì The Sunday Times His poems are widely anthologized and have appeared in American, Irish, Italian, English, Australian, Japanese and Argentinean anthologies, including the Norton Introduction to Poetry, Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing, American Poets of the New Century, 20th Century Irish Poems, Contemporary Poets of New England and The Penguin Book of Irish Poetry. His Individual poems have been published in such publications as The Atlantic formily The Atlantic Monthly, the New Statesman, The New Republic, American Scholar, The Irish Times, PN Review, and The Times Literary Supplement Greg Delanty is the Co-Editor with Michael Matto of the critically acclaimed and a best seller on Amazon The Word Exchange: Anglo-Saxon Poems in Translation (Introduced by Seamus Heaney). New York: W.W. Norton, 2010. Some of his other translations include Se√°n √ì R√≠ord√°in's Selected Poems in Translation and Selected Poems of Kyriakos Charalambides (Cork: Southword Editions, 2005). He has also translated Aristophanes ‚ÄòThe Knights‚Äô which he retitled ‚ÄòThe Suits‚Äô, and Euripides‚Äô ‚ÄòOrestes‚Äô, which he wanted to translate to ‚ÄòThe Family‚Äô, but the chance of title occurred during the actually printing of the book so it was too late to alter. Both these classical plays were translated for The Complete Greek Drama Series (Penn Greek Drama Series, 1998) Delanty edited, with Nuala Ni Dhomhnaill, Jumping Off Shadows: Selected Contemporary Irish Poetry (Cork UP, 1995) and, with Robert Welsh, The Selected Poems of Patrick Galvin (Cork UP, 1995). He has read widely in the United States and Europe, including the Library of Congress. Many of his poems have been broadcast on radio and television, from Garrison Kellior The Writer's Almanac to the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) and Radio Teilifis √âireann (Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann‚ÄîIrish National TV and Radio Broadcasting). He also has been interviewed extensively. Two interviews worth noting are the Vermont PBS interview with Fran Stoddart in the program ‚ÄòProfiles‚Äô; and the other interview was with David Hanley in the RT√â poetry program ‚ÄòThe Enchanted Way‚Äô. The National Library of Ireland has acquired Greg Delanty‚Äôs papers up to 2010. Awards Greg Delanty has received numerous awards including the Patrick Kavanagh Poetry Award (1983), the Allen Dowling Poetry Fellowship (1986), the Wolfers-O‚ÄôNeill Award (1996-97), the Austin Clarke Award (1996), National Poetry Competition Prizewinner (Poetry Society of England, 1999) an Arts Council of Ireland Bursary (1998-99), and an award from the Royal Literary Fund (1999). He has been granted a Guggenheim Fellowship for poetry for 2007-2008.

Designed to exploit new technology, the aircraft was abandoned after two crashes although the innovative fuselage was later incorporated into a helicopter prototype. Design and development The Planet Satellite designed by Major J.N. Dundas Heenan was a futuristic looking four-seater built of magnesium alloy in a true monocoque \\"teardrop\\" shaped fuselage with no internal reinforced structure.Middleton 1983, p. 528. The Satellite was powered by a 250 hp de Havilland Gipsy Queen 31 mounted amidships driving a two-blade Aeromatic \\"pusher\\" airscrew in the tail.Air Progress, November 1978, p. 18. Other notable features included \\"butterfly\\" tails and a retractable tricycle undercarriage, with the nosewheel retracting into a reinforced keel that ran the length of the underside of the fuselage.Middleton 1983, p. 528. Breaking with conventional design and manufacturing conventions, Heenan declared in the July 1948 Aviation News issue, that the 400 drawings made were in stark contrast with the standard of approximately 3,000 drawings required for a project of that complexity.Middleton 1983, p. 529.

Wilson (holder of the World speed Record in the Gloster Meteor), after several long runs down the runway, managed to get the Satellite airborne at Blackbushe. The first \\"hop\\" was followed by the collapse of the undercarriage. After repairs, the prototype was flown off the ground and after reaching an altitude of barely 20 ft was put down on the ground gently but nonetheless, the main keel had been cracked by the force of the landing. The conclusion of the Air Registration board investigating the \\"accident\\" was that the aircraft was badly under- stressed and would necessitate a complete redesign.Middleton 1983, p. 530. The manufacturers had already begun the production of a second prototype and despite an investment of ¬£100,000, chose to wind down the program with no further attempts to fly the Planet Satellite. The second prototype, registered G-ALXP was abandoned but the completed fuselage was incorporated into the Firth Helicopter, built in 1952 at Thame. The single \\"flying\\" Satellite languished at Redhill until 1958 when it was unceremoniously broken up.Middleton 1983, p. 531.

Michael Gear. Kathleen met Michael at a Wyoming Association of Professional Archaeologists meeting in Laramie, Wyoming, in 1981. When she pulled out her chair at lunch and put her boot squarely in the middle of his Stetson--lying on the floor--it gave them a reason to strike up a conversation. They've been finishing each other's sentences ever since, both verbally and in writing. She has seventeen million copies in print, translated into twenty-nine languages, and has written for children, young adults, and adults. Her work spans several genres, including non-fiction, historical fiction, science fiction, mystery, thriller, and literature for children and young adults.

He is best known for the role he played in the 1758 Capture of Senegal in which he submitted a plan to the British war leader William Pitt which advocated an attack on France's valuable but ill-defended African colonies.Anderson p.306 Cumming was born in New York City, and raised as a Quaker, something which later earned him the nickname of the \\"fighting quaker\\".Brown p.165 Capture of Senegal Cumming had travelled to West Africa extensively, and was aware of the enormous wealth and future potential of the French colonies along the S√©n√©gal and Gambia rivers. He advocated to William Pitt, the Southern Secretary an expedition to seize these valuable settlements. Pitt agreed to despatch a force in 1758 which in April arrived of West Africa. Cumming had gone ahead to meet with local African leaders to try and gain their support for the British attack. He was successful, and a number of African troops assisted the British in capturing the settlement of Saint Louis which fell without firing a shot. Cumming made a fortune in captured goods which were brought back to London. Particularly valuable were the large amounts of gum arabic which were used by silk-weavers. Pitt was impressed enough to send two further expeditions which led to the capture of the island of Gor√©e and the French trading station on the Gambia. References Bibliography * Anderson, Fred.

Life The Fitzwilliam Virginal Book, which includes the third of his Gloria tibi Trinitas settings, gives his forename as William. However, Chapel Royal records from 1558 to 1590 consistently refer to John Blitheman, and there can be little doubt that this was the composer's name.Caldwell and Brown, New Grove. However some other references list him as William. Nothing is known about his early life. In 1555 he was chaplain at Christ Church, Oxford, becoming master of the choristers there in 1564. From 1585 until his death he was appointed organist of the Chapel Royal (succeeding Thomas Tallis), where John Bull was both his pupil and successor. He died in London in 1591 and is buried at St Nicholas Olave, Queenhithe. The great majority of Blitheman's works is included in The Mulliner Book, where he is represented by fifteen pieces.

Biography The son of Sir John Hamilton of Cadzow and his wife, Janet Douglas, James Hamilton is first attested to in 1397. In a writ of that year, his father Sir John Hamilton granted him the lands and privileges of Kinneil, in return for the superiority of all property that had been promised to him through his marriage after his attainment of majority. Hamilton next comes to notice in a Safe-conduct issued by Henry V of England to travel to Calthorpe Castle in Lincolnshire. In 1424, Hamilton was one of the Scottish Lords allowed passage to Durham to visit the captive James I of Scotland. In the same year, he was one of many Scots hostages given to the English as security for the payment of the ransom of the newly freed King of Scots. His estate was valued at 500 merks. Hamilton was confined first at Fotheringay Castle, then at Dover Castle. He appears to have been released by 1426. He was invested as a knight before 1430. Hamilton died not later than 1441, when his son is described as Lord of Cadzow. Marriage and children James Hamilton married Janet Livingston before 1422, when he received a charter of the lands of Schawis from his father-in-law, Sir Alexander Livingston of Callendar.

It was released in 1971. The album was the first to be credited to \\"Thos.\\" (Tom) Rapp and Pearls Before Swine, rather than solely in the group's name. In fact, the group, which had been formed by Rapp and his friends in Florida in the mid-1960s, and which in its original incarnation had never performed live, had effectively ceased to exist by the time of their third album These Things Too, and subsequent albums had been recorded by Rapp with his wife Elisabeth and session musicians. City of Gold drew heavily on material left over from the recording of the previous Pearls album, The Use of Ashes, which had been recorded in early 1970 with the cream of Nashville's session musicians.Sleeve notes to Jewels Were The Stars Further recording sessions took place in New York later that year, with Rapp taking on producer duties. The album, while having a broadly country/folk feel, is very mixed in content and, in most critics' estimation, quality. However, it does contain some of Rapp's best lyrics, sparkling arrangements, and some of his most heartfelt vocal performances, such as on the harpsichord-dominated version of Leonard Cohen's \\"(Seems So Long Ago) Nancy\\", and his own \\"Did You Dream Of\\". It also includes a very atypical up-tempo Rapp song, \\"The Man\\", sung vigorously by David Noyes. According to Noyes, a high school student at the time, the song was recorded at A&R; Studios in New York City during the summer of 1969; Noyes also sang harmony vocals on other songs, including \\"Seasons In The Sun\\". Noyes' friend, Jon Tooker, took his position when the band toured Europe later in the year. The sleeve design broke with the group's tradition of using classic art rather than photographs of the musicians. The front cover showed a hand-painted photograph of Rapp, taken in the Netherlands where many of the songs had been written. The photograph on the back of the cover shows Rapp, Jon Tooker, Gordon Hayes and Michael Krawitz. This was the version of Pearls Before Swine which toured in 1971, but Tooker, Hayes and Krawitz did not play on the album itself (although they did play on the next album, Beautiful Lies). City of Gold was issued on CD in 2003 as part of the Jewels Were the Stars compendium of Pearls Before Swine's first four Reprise albums.

He wrote a series of soft-core sex novels, but is best known for his locked-room mystery/impossible crime short stories featuring Senator Brooks U. Banner.\\" Commings began writing in 1947, and was first published in 10-Story Detective magazine in March, 1947. After three stories, Commings also began writing for Ten Detective Aces. For some reason, the editors of both magazines thought it would be a good idea to have a different detective. Commings merely changed the name of Banner to Mayor Thomas Landin, but kept everything else the same. All stories that were first printed in Ten Detective Aces and that have since been reprinted have changed the name of Landin back to Banner.\\" By the 1950s, Commings submitted stories to Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine, but Frederic Dannay (half of the writing/editorial team known as Ellery Queen) didn't like the character of Banner, so Commings was never printed in EQMM. It wouldn't be until 1957 that Commings would be able to print another Banner story.\\" In 1957, Commings published stories in an offbeat mystery magazine, Mystery Digest. It was during this time that Commings would write his best-known story, The X Street Murders. Commings would continue to be published in Mystery Digest until it went bankrupt, his last story being The Giant's Sword in 1963.\\" Commings would publish a few stories in The Saint Mystery Magazine until 1968. Commings would also publish a series of part crime/part sex novels. Commings attempted to write normal mystery novels, and locked room mystery novels, none of which was published. It wouldn't be until 1979, in Mike Shayne Mystery Magazine, that Commings would publish another Banner story, cowritten by Edward D. Hoch. (Commings was a friend of both John Dickson Carr and Edward D. Hoch.) Commings would continue to publish in MSMM until 1984; he died in 1992.

Both the TwinRanger and another planned version, the Bell 440, were attempts to market a twin-engine development of the Model 206L LongRanger. The Bell 400A was a planned single- engine version of the 400. TwinRanger, however development was canceled when Bell could not acquire enough orders for production. The TwinRanger name was later used for a twin-engine version of the LongRanger produced from 1994 to 1997. Development Bell has tried several incarnations of a twin-engine version of its successful Bell 206 series. The TwinRanger name dates back to the mid-1980s when Bell first considered developing a twin-engine version of the LongRanger. The Bell 400 TwinRanger featured a reprofiled fuselage, two Allison 250 turboshafts, the OH-58D Kiowa's four-bladed main rotor, and a new shrouded tail rotor.Frawley, Gerard: The International Directiory of Civil Aircraft, 2003-2004, page 43. Aerospace Publications Pty Ltd, 2003. Bell also planned the single-engine 400A, and the 440 twin with a larger fuselage made possible by a high degree of composites. The Bell 400 first flew on April 4, 1984. Bell suspended development of the 400/440 family in the late 1980s as it felt unable to achieve a profitable production rate of 120 units a year. Successors After the success of Tridair's Gemini ST twin-engine conversions of the 206L in the early 1990s, Bell produced the equivalent Bell 206LT TwinRanger based on the 206L-4. Only 13 206LTs were built between 1994 and 1997.

He was born in Gizeux, Anjou, the son of Gaspard de Contades (b.1666) and his wife Jeanne- Marie Crespin de La Chabosselaye. On 1734, he was created a Brigadier; in 1740 Mar√©chal de camp; and in 1745 Lieutenant G√©n√©ral. He took command of the French Army of Westphalia in 1758 during the Seven Years' War due to dissatisfaction with the previous commanders. He was unable to stem the French withdrawal across the Rhine, which had undone France's conquest of Hanover. On 24 August 1758, he was created Mar√©chal de France. On 1 August 1759, he led the French forces at the Battle of Minden, where they were routed. This largely halted France's offensive in Germany that year, and had wider strategic ramifications.

Jonathan Bate in the Guardian described the novel as ‚Äòstylish, assured and thoughtful‚Äô while the Mail on Sunday‚Äôs reviewer described it as ‚Äòa terrifying journey into the dark recesses of the human soul‚Äô, adding that its ‚Äòevocation of the native [Australian] flora and fauna is inspiring.‚Äô Poster‚Äôs environmental and cultural concerns have been widely discussed, most notably in Mariadele Boccardi‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Naturalist in the Garden of Eden: Science and Colonial Landscape in Jem Poster's Rifling Paradise‚Äô, published in Victoriographies vol. 6, no. 2, June 2016 (Edinburgh University Press).

The hamlet and parish church are situated four miles (6.5 km) north of Wadebridge.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 200 Newquay & Bodmin The parish takes its name from Saint Endelienta, who is said to have evangelised the district in the fifth century and to have been one of the children of King Brychan. Two wells near the church are named after her. The name is included in the electoral ward of St Minver and St Endellion, which includes Polzeath and Rock, with a population at the 2011 census of 3268.  Geography and topography  Bournonite (Endellionite) on dolomite St Endellion is the Type Locality for the minerals Bournonite (also known as Endellione or Endellionite) and Barstowite. St Endellion lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Almost a third of Cornwall has AONB designation, with the same status and protection as a National Park. Tresungers Farm The houses at Roscarrock and Tresungers are listed buildings: at Roscarrock part of the medieval house remains (it is Listed Grade I); Tresungers farmhouse was built in the late 16th century.Pevsner, Nikolaus (1970) Cornwall; 2nd ed., edited by Enid Radcliffe. Penguin Books The Roscarrock family included Nicholas Roscarrock.  Parish church  St Endellion church The Church of England parish church of St Endelienta stands beside the road to Wadebridge and is a large building of the 15th century in Perpendicular style. It contains some fine examples of carving in stone and wood. The earliest record of the church is in 1260, and in 1288 it is recorded as a collegiate church with four prebends; the date of their foundation is unknown. One of the prebends to which was attached the cure of souls came to be entitled to the rectory. It somehow escaped abolition in 1545 (when only the rector was resident) and continues to the present day: one of the prebendaries is the Rector, and the others usually incumbents of nearby parishes. The prebend of Marnay's or St Elen's is usually held by the incumbent of Lanhydrock. A new ecclesiastical parish of Port Isaac was created out of the parish in 1913 and one of the prebends became the endowment of that benefice, whose incumbent was a vicar.Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford, pp. 89‚Äì91 The church was designated as Grade I listed in 1969.

It was built by the North Staffordshire Railway off its main line (commonly referred to as the Manchester branch of the West Coast Main Line via Stoke). It was opened in many short sections due to the cost of railway construction during the 1870s. The line throughout was sanctioned but the NSR felt that the line would be unimportant enough to abandon part way through its construction. This upset residents of the towns through which the line was planned to pass and they eventually petitioned Parliament to force the completion of the route. Stoke- on-Trent_Station_geograph-2158139.jpg|Stoke Station 1965 Burslem railway station 1952820 dbe40abb.jpg|Burslem Station 1962 Construction The line was authorised and constructed as follows: * Etruria - Shelton: authorised for construction on 2 July 1847, opening for goods in 1850 and passengers in January 1862. * Shelton - Hanley: authorised for construction on 13 August 1859, opening to goods on 20 December 1861 and passengers on 13 July 1864. The entire section to the NSR main line at Kidsgrove was authorised on 5 July 1865 opening as follows: * Hanley - Burslem: opened to passengers and goods on 1 November 1873. * Burslem - Tunstall: opened to passengers and goods on 1 December 1873. * Tunstall - Goldenhill: opened to passengers and goods on 1 October 1874. * Goldenhill - Kidsgrove: opened to passengers and goods on 15 November 1875. The route With the towns that the line served being located on hilltops, the geography of the route was renowned for its severe gradients and sharp curves, especially around Tunstall, Burslem and Hanley. Leaving the main line at Etruria Junction, the line turned almost back on itself to proceed eastwards and passed through part of the Shelton Bar complex. Approaching Hanley, another sharp curve took the route northwards once again. A rising gradient led to Cobridge tunnel and then Burslem, before a 1 in 90 climb to Tunstall. After reaching the summit of the line at Newchapel, a 1 in 40 descent led to a cutting near the Birchenwood Coke Works on the approach to Kidsgrove. It then rejoined the main line at Liverpool Road Junction, north of the junction to Crewe. Decline The Loop's heyday was the early part of the 20th century. In 1910 there were almost 40 trains a day using the route, operated mainly by trains composed of close-coupled four wheel coaches. By 1910, Hanley had become the largest of the Six Towns, but the line only served the areas where a fraction of Hanley‚Äôs workforce lived. From the 1920s the line began to fall victim to road competition. A traffic survey carried out in the middle of 1956 showed that one mid-morning train carried just four passengers, three of whom were railwaymen travelling for free. Services were cut back later that year and by 1961 there were just five passenger trains daily from Stoke-on-Trent to Hanley and Tunstall, none of which ran outside the peak hours. As far as goods traffic was concerned, much of it had been transferred to road as the 1950s dawned. The Beeching Axe signalled the final blow for passenger services, and services were withdrawn on 2 March 1964. After Beeching Freight workings continued for some years afterwards. In 1967 trains were frequently diverted onto the Loop Line between Longport and Kidsgrove via the Pinnox branch during the electrification of the West Coast Main Line, the upgrading of which involved construction of a new line avoiding Harecastle tunnel. The section from Etruria to Waterloo Road remained open for oil traffic from Century Oils in Hanley; this traffic ceased on 31 July 1969. The northern part of the route remained open until 1976 to transport coal from an opencast mine at Park Farm, near Goldenhill.

He famously wore white football boots. Playing career Wolverhampton Wanderers Hinton started his career in the youth ranks at Wolverhampton Wanderers in October 1959, before making his senior debut on 7 January 1961 in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Huddersfield Town in the FA Cup. He came into the Wolves team during the 1961‚Äì62 season when he managed 16 appearances, scoring 5 times. The following season, he was a first choice in the wide left position, from where he netted 19 times, making him their leading goalscorer. He also won a call-up to the England team during this season when he played against France on 3 October 1962 in a European Championship qualifier at Hillsborough. Nottingham Forest Johnny Carey became Forest manager in 1963 signing Hinton in January 1964. Carey assembled a team including Hinton, Ian Storey-Moore, and Joe Baker that for a long spell went largely unchanged in challenging for the 1966‚Äì67 Football League title. They beat title rivals Manchester United 4‚Äì1 at the City Ground on 1 October 1966. The 3‚Äì0 win against Aston Villa on 15 April had Forest second in the table a point behind United. Injuries eventually took effect meaning Forest had to settle for being League Runners-up and losing in the 1966-67 FA Cup semi-final to Dave Mackay's Tottenham Hotspur. After missing out on both trophies, Hinton left in September of the following season. Hinton appeared 112 times for Forest scoring 24 goals. His time with Forest also saw him earn two further England caps, in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Belgium ‚Äì in which he scored ‚Äì and a 2‚Äì1 win over Wales, both in 1964. Derby County He was then signed by Brian Clough for Derby County (local rivals of Forest) in September 1967 for ¬£30,000. He spent eight seasons with the Rams, which coincided with the golden period in the club's history, winning promotion to the top flight as Second Division champions in 1968‚Äì69 and then winning the league championship in both 1971‚Äì72 and 1974‚Äì75. He departed in 1975 after 253 appearances and 63 goals for Derby. Whilst at Derby he was universally and affectionately known, amongst the fans by his nickname \`Gladys\` which stemmed from his aforementioned white boots and curly blonde perm, along with his elegant and non-aggressive playing style. Later playing career After a brief stint as player-manager of non-league Borrowash Victoria, he relocated to North America in 1976 after his son Matthew died from a rare form of cancer. Hinton first played for the Dallas Tornado for a season, before moving to the Vancouver Whitecaps to close out his playing career. In his final season before retiring aged 36 he set an NASL single-season record with 30 assists in 1978. Managerial career Having settled in North America, Hinton managed only Canadian and American teams, his biggest successes were with the Seattle Sounders (66 games, 45 wins) and later on the Tacoma Stars (87 games, 69 wins). Hinton also spent a number of years coaching youth soccer in the Puget Sound area of Washington state and became known as \\"Mr. Soccer\\" in the area. He coached the U13-18 Crossfire Sounders boys team (now the Crossfire Premier Soccer Club, including boys and girls teams) from 1992‚Äì1997. Hinton was involved in efforts to bring the 1994 FIFA World Cup to the U.S., and when the Seattle Sounders name was revived for a new American Professional Soccer League club in 1994, Hinton became club President and appointed himself as coach. Personal life After retiring from coaching, Hinton turned to a career in real estate, while remaining involved in youth soccer. He served as a local broadcast analyst for Seattle Sounders. His nephew, Craig, is also a professional footballer. On 18 November 2014 Hinton tweeted that his bladder cancer had returned and that he would have major surgery on 7 January 2015. A few weeks later he tweeted that the pathology results showed him to be \\"clear\\". On 1 June 2020, Hinton tweeted controversial remarks about black soccer players that led to Sounders FC officially ending a 40-year relationship with him. https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/sounders/sounders-part-ways-with- broadcaster-and-former-coach-alan-hinton-fired-over-tweet/ References Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. players Category:Nottingham Forest F.C. players Category:Derby County F.C. players Category:Borrowash Victoria A.F.C. players Category:Dallas Tornado players Category:Vancouver Whitecaps (1974‚Äì1984) players Category:England international footballers Category:England under-23 international footballers Category:English expatriate footballers Category:English expatriate sportspeople in Canada Category:English expatriate sportspeople in the United States Category:English football managers Category:English footballers Category:Expatriate soccer managers in Canada Category:Expatriate soccer managers in the United States Category:Expatriate soccer players in Canada Category:Expatriate soccer players in the United States Category:Association football midfielders Category:Major Indoor Soccer League (1978‚Äì1992) coaches Category:North American Soccer League (1968‚Äì1984) coaches Category:North American Soccer League (1968‚Äì1984) players Category:Sportspeople from Wednesbury Category:Seattle Sounders (1974‚Äì1983) coaches Category:Seattle Sounders (1994‚Äì2008) coaches Category:Tacoma Stars coaches Category:English Football League players Category:Vancouver Whitecaps (1974‚Äì1984) coaches Category:Major League Soccer broadcasters ","title":"Alan Hinton"},{"id":"11721404","text":"Michael Jones (born 3 December 1987 in Liverpool, England) is an English footballer, who plays for Cefn Druids.

Its module code is DA3 and its TSR product code is TSR 9191. Plot summary In this scenario, the player characters (PCs) are sent to the City of the Gods by the leaders of Blackmoor to acquire divine magic, either by bargaining or by stealing. The PCs journey 4,000 years into the past to the land of Blackmoor. There, they are hired by The Fetch, previously seen in the adventure Temple of the Frog, because the Froggies, a cult introduced in the same adventure, have become active once more. The cult is using the futuristic technology of the City of the Gods to achieve their ends, and the player characters must attempt to contact the inhabitants of the city to turn them against the Froggies, and possibly form an alliance with the Kingdom of Blackmoor. The adventure takes place in three parts, and is a mixture of fantasy and science fiction. The module also includes new alien technological devices and twelve pre-generated player characters. Publication history DA3 City of the Gods was written by Dave L. Arneson and David J. Ritchie, with cover art by Doug Chaffee and interior illustrations by Jim Holloway. It was published by TSR in 1987 as a 48-page booklet with a large color map and an outer folder. The adventure content is fourteen pages long, with the rest of the booklet containing background information and data on the various creatures, non-player characters and devices used in the adventure, and different ways of getting the PCs to Blackmoor. Deborah Campbell Ritchie edited the module. Cartography was done by Dennis Kauth and David C. Sutherland III, while Kim N. Lindau did the typesetting. Reception Graeme Davis reviewed City of the Gods for White Dwarf No. 92. He commented that \\"If you like mixing fantasy and SF, fine; if not, this is probably not for you.\\" He went on to say that the adventure material \\"consists of two out-in-the-open fights and a dungeon bash round the spaceship, and that's your lot.\\" He notes that while some of the supplemental materials are useful, most are not, saying \\"Personally, I've never been keen on letting level 10-14 D&D; characters stock up with grenades, blasters and lightsabres, but no doubt this will appeal to some.\\" He said that \\"hardware buffs\\" may like the new monsters, and that the NPCs are \\"interesting and useful\\", though with some overlap from the previous Blackmoor adventure, Temple of the Frog. On the pregenerated player characters, he comments that \\"Statistics, personality and magic are detailed for each, but there is no mention of conventional equipment, so the characters will have to be equipped - which, to my mind, defeats the object of pregenerated PCs...\\" Davis concludes the review by saying: \\"If you are following the Blackmoor campaign, or if you want to play a 10th-14th level one-off mixing fantasy and SF, then you will probably like DA3... Otherwise, you may well find it disappointing.\\" Errol Farstad reviewed City of the Gods for Polyhedron No. 37, rating it as an 8 out of 10 overall.

Benedict Roger Wallers (a.k.a. The Rebel) (born 15 September 1971 in St Albans, Hertfordshire) is the frontman, guitarist, vocalist and songwriter for the band Country Teasers. His lyrics often deal with taboo subjects such as racism, sexism and xenophobia from first-person standpoints. Biography Wallers has been releasing music under various guises since 1995. He is best known for being part of the group Country Teasers, formed in Scotland in the mid 1990s. Wallers is generally regarded to be Scottish, but various places of birth have been put forward, including Saville Row, London and St Albans, Hertfordshire (according to his autobiography). Country Teasers bassist Sophie Politowicz plays drums in live performances and features on various Rebel recordings. The pair also play together in the band The Devil. Music career Country Teasers The Rebel As well as Country Teasers, Wallers records under the moniker The Rebel. Most of the recordings, which are largely abridged musical interpretations of arcane and proper historical text, have not seen official release (several for the reason that they are \\"not masterpieces\\"). Before 1998 The Rebel was not known as The Walrus, but was named Walrus after the Wallers family name. The name 'The Rebel' is a reference and homage to the 1961 film starring Tony Hancock. Ben Wallers represents himself by a symbol called a Spakenkreuz, which is a Swastika (Hakenkreuz) with a broken (or 'spastic') arm, bent backwards to cross over the previous arm in the circularity of the swastika. As far as he is aware, he invented this symbol. *\\"KROT\\" (Monofonus Press, twelve inch, 2014) *Still Taping After All These Discs (twelve inch, plamenco records, ltd 250, 2014) *Sternold the Bachelor or Music 2000 (reissue cassette, +DL code ltd 100, neenrecords 2012) *Nuclear Jazz Holocaust, (reissue cassette, +DL code ltd 100, Neen records 2012) *Titrack Luxury or Bums on a Rock (reissue cassette + DL code ltd 100 nightschoolrecords)2012 *Nature's Wind Mixed Wine with Lethe (reissue cassette + DL code by nightschool records 2012 ltd 100) *The Rebel - Pre-Pub EP//Year Of Birds - Blocker For Coinslot EP, (Ack!

Patricia \\"Pat\\" Scott (July 14, 1929 ‚Äì October 19, 2016)Patricia Scott Obituary, legacy.com; accessed October 30, 2016. was a pitcher who played in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League for parts of four seasons spanning 1948‚Äì1953. Listed at , 155 lb., she batted and threw right-handed. A solid finesse pitcher, Scott had one of the best overhand deliveries during the last six years of the league. She guided the Fort Wayne Daisies to three consecutive pennants from 1951 to 1953, averaging 16 wins in each of them, while recording career best numbers in ERA (2.46), WHIP (0.87) and SO/BB (1.07).W.C. Madden, All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book (2000), McFarland & Company; Born in Covington, Kentucky, Scott was raised in a family farm located in the nearby town of Burlington. The farm included a baseball field, just like in the 1992 film Field of Dreams, where she began playing baseball when she was eight years old. I used to throw a ball against the barn, she explained in an interview. The only difference was that instead of corn, we grew tobacco around it, she added.W.C. Madden. The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League: A Biographical Dictionary, McFarland & Company (2005); When the young Pat was not doing farm chores, she was practicing ball throwings. To her delight, a minor league baseball team came to practice on their ball field. I was about ten at the time, so they let me practice with them, and they taught me everything I know about baseball, she recalled. Scott later played fastpitch softball in Cincinnati, Ohio, during her tenure at high school. In 1948, her father read an advertisement in the local newspaper offering girls an opportunity to try out for the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League at Wrigley Field. \\"So we went to Chicago. Amazingly, I made the cut and signed a contract with the Springfield Sallies... I was so thrilled because my dream to play baseball was actually coming true!\\" Scott hurled and won an 11-inning complete game in her rookie season, helping the Sallies to a victory by recording a pair of singles, a double and one home run. Manager Carson Bigbee was very pleased with her work. Unfortunately, her mother became seriously ill shortly after and she had to return home. It seemed her playing days were over. Then in 1951, league president Max Carey was in urgent need of pitching and located Scott in Springfield, Ohio. Carey, who also managed the Fort Wayne Daisies, talked her parents into letting her return to the league.1948 Springfield Sallies, aagpbl.org; accessed October 30, 2016. After two years of absence, Scott renewed her passion for baseball after joining the Fort Wayne team. She won 15 games against 7 losses and recorded a 2.13 ERA in 26 games, striking out 62 batters in 190 innings, while ending seventh in wins and tenth in winning percentage (.682). In addition, she won a one-run, pennant-winning game against the Rockford Peaches, which represented the first single season title in Daisies history. In the best-of-three-first round, she held the South Bend Blue Sox to a single run in Game 2 to tie the series at a game apiece. In decisive Game 3, she lost an 11-inning duel with Jean Faut by a narrow margin of 2‚Äì1.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book1951 Fort Wayne Daisies, aagpbl.org; accessed October 30, 2016. But Scott was even better in 1952, when she posted a 17‚Äì7 record with 60 strikeouts and a 2.05 ERA in 26 appearances, ending seventh in innings of work (202) and eight in ERA, while tying for fourth in wins and in winning percentage (.708). First place Fort Wayne, now managed by Hall of Fame legend Jimmie Foxx, faced third place Rockford in the first round and lost two-to-one games. Scott played at outfield and went 0-for-3 in one game.1952 Fort Wayne Daisies, aagpbl.org; accessed October 30, 2016. About her relation with Foxx, Scott confirmed that he had a drinking problem, but he never let it affect his managing on the field and was a true gentleman around the ladies. I never saw him miss a game and never cuss, she clarified. Scott dropped slightly in the 1953 season, but appeared among the top ten pitchers in six different categories. She went 16‚Äì12 with a 3.06 ERA, ranking third in games pitched (32), fourth in innings (238) and tenth in winning percentage (.571), while tying for third in wins and in complete games (24), and for fourth in shutouts (4). Fort Wayne, with Bill Allington at the helm, clinched his third consecutive title and played third place Kalamazoo Lassies in the first round, being beaten for the third year in a row with identical margin of 1‚Äì2. Scott went 0‚Äì1 with a 3.00 ERA in nine innings.1953 Fort Wayne Daisies, aagpbl.org; accessed October 30, 2016. In 1954, Scott could not pass up an agricultural examination to attend college in Europe as a student exchange program participant. She then attained a zoology degree at the University of Kentucky, where she also played for the Kentucky Wildcats women's basketball team. After earning another degree in medicine, she worked as a medical technologist for the next 32 years in the Cincinnati area. Following her retirement, Scott moved to Walton, Kentucky, where she stayed playing softball and developed her interest in oil painting. She also trained horses for thirteen years and was a dog trainer for three years. Along the way, she also became a formidable golfer, an award-winning artist, and a film consultant of sorts. Scott attended her first wood carving show in 1994, out of sheer curiosity. Then, she signed up for practically every class and seminar the River Valley Wood Carver's Association offered. She later started to score big points as a woodcarver, creating a variety of topics, including a carousel horse head, busts, ornaments, and several decorative items. She started carving an old piece of wood with a pocketknife and an old file borrowed from a blacksmith. \\"I quickly learned that carving is a lot different from painting because wood isn't as forgiving as paint. It took me six months to carve out a simple figure! ... From the time I was a little kid, I've always had this fascination with birds. So I've started carving them.\\" Her hobby has come a long way since those early carving days, but she currently still likes to keep things simple, as she said in a 2011 interview: \\"I guess you could say I'm sort of a purist when it comes to carving, because until recently I only used knives and gouges.\\" Then she discovered a neat little power tool called wecheer. I'm learning how to use it now. It's like a dremel, only about the size of a pen. It helps me smooth out the little wrinkles here and there. Scott is part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled in 1988 to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.

He had two separate stints as manager the Derry senior football team, and his chief success was guiding the county to the victory in the 1993 All-Ireland Championship ‚Äì Derry's first ever All-Ireland Senior Football Championship title. He also had spells as manager of Armagh, Cavan, Longford and various club sides. Before moving into management he has an accomplished playing career with Derry and his club team Ballymaguigan. Personal life He was born in the small County Londonderry townland of Ballymaguigan on the western shores of Lough Neagh in 1947 or 1948. His son Gary, was also a talented footballer and was left half back on the victorious 1993 Derry team; also winning an All Star for his performances that year. Playing career Inter-county Coleman was part of the Derry minor team that won the Ulster Minor and All-Ireland Minor Championships in 1965, beating Cavan and Kerry in the respective finals. He won an Ulster Under 21 Championship medal with Derry under-21s in 1967. The following year the team defended their Ulster Championship and went on to win the All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championship; beating Offaly in the final. Coleman soon progressed into the senior team and in 1970 helped Derry win the Dr McKenna Cup and Ulster Senior Football Championship. He won a second McKenna Cup medal in 1971. The same side won the Wembley Tournament in both these years. Club At underage level Coleman competed for Ballinderry as there was no underage teams in Ballymaguigan. He was first asked into the Ballymaguigan senior side at just 14 years of age in 1962. That year as a 14/15-year-old he won the Derry Senior Football Championship with the club, scoring 1‚Äì2 in the final replay against Castledawson. Ballymaguigan also won that year's Derry League title. He later helped the club to win Derry Junior and Derry Intermediate Championships in 1969 and 1971. Coleman played for Ballinderry in the early 1980s and won a second Derry Championship medal in 1981. While working in County Westmeath, Coleman lined out for Athlone, with whom he won two Westmeath Senior Football Championships in 1979 and 1982. Managerial career Inter-county In 1983 he led the Derry minor side to success in the Ulster Minor and All-Ireland Minor Football Championships. Four of this team would be in his senior winning panel ten years later. They defended the Ulster title with Coleman at the helm in 1984. He led Derry under 21s to victory in the 1985 Ulster Under-21 Football Championship. In 1989 he became Armagh manager alongside Fr. Sean Hegarty. He took over as Derry senior manager in November 1990. In November 1990 Derry were managerless and the Derry County Board rang Coleman and asked him to return home to manage Derry. When he took on the Derry job, the team was languishing in Division 3 of the National Football League. After consecutive promotions, he achieved his first national trophy as Derry senior manager by winning the NFL in 1992.RTE Anthony Tohill scored a late winning goal for Derry in a two-point victory over neighbours Tyrone. The following year Coleman later guided Derry to their best ever year, winning both Ulster and All-Ireland Championships. After beating Donegal in the Ulster Senior Football Championship final, he led Derry to success in the 1993 All-Ireland Championship, beating Dublin in the semi-final and Cork in the final 1‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì08.Belfast Telegraph \\"Former Derry manager Coleman dies after long illness\\" June 12 2007 Fergal P. McCusker who was on the All-Ireland winning side said \\"The Derry team would not have been brought together without his skills. He stitched a bunch of guys together and we would have gone through brick walls. We'd have done anything for him. He was the man that inspired you to go that extra yard\\". Despite his success with Derry in 1993, he was removed as the manager in 1994 after a loss against Down, a game which was described by many as the greatest match of all time. GAA journalist John Haughey described the Derry Board's decision to sack Coleman as \\"both disgraceful and shortsighted\\". Many claim if he had been allowed to remain, Derry won have won at least one more All-Ireland in the mid-1990s. He was replaced by Mickey Moran, who had been his assistant. Following a brief flirtation with Longford in the mid-1990s, Coleman drifted into club management in County Cavan. Alongside Adrian McGuckin, Coleman replaced former Dublin footballer Brian Mullins as Derry manager in 1999 and steered Derry to another National League title in 2000. In 2001 Derry reached the All-Ireland semi-final but were beaten by Galway. Coleman won Personality of the Year at the 2001 Ulster GAA Writer's Association Awards, having previously won the award in 1993. He stood down as Derry manager in 2002. In 2003 Coleman became manager of Cavan, but was forced to stand down in 2005, after becoming ill. In 2005 he led Cavan under 21s to the Ulster Under 21 Championship final, but they were defeated by Down. Despite going through chemotherapy at the time, Coleman came into the Derry dressing room before Derry's opening game of the 2006 Championship against reigning All-Ireland champions Tyrone. Joe Brolly said \\"He delivered a thundering oration and with all the Derry boys, the hairs were standing up on the back of the necks. It was a genuinely motivational speech and to think that just a year on, he's gone. It's very distressing.\\" Derry went on to beat Tyrone comfortably. Club Coleman was manager of the Kildress team that won the 1978 Tyrone Intermediate Football Championship. He emigrated to England to look for work in the late 1980s. He managed the Round Tower's club that won the London Senior Football Championship in 1987. Coleman led Cavan club side Gowna to five Cavan Senior Football Championship titles ‚Äì 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000 and 2002.\\"Playing experience paid off to give Derry GAA its finest hour, S√©amus McKinney, The Irish News, 12 June 2007, p. 5 College In the late 1980s Coleman was a key figure in the University of Ulster, Jordanstown (UUJ) Sigerson Cup breakthrough team.

The story is particularly noteworthy as a prediction of massively networked personal computers and their drawbacks, written at a time when computing was in its infancy.  Plot  The story's narrator is a \\"logic repairman\\" nicknamed Ducky. A \\"logic\\" is a computer-like device described as looking \\"like a vision receiver used to, only it's got keys instead of dials and you punch the keys for what you wanna get\\". In the story, a logic whom Ducky names Joe develops some degree of sapience and ambition. Joe proceeds to switch around a few relays in \\"the tank\\" (one of a distributed set of central information repositories), and cross-correlate all information ever assembled ‚Äì yielding highly unexpected results. It then proceeds to freely disseminate all of those results to everyone on demand (and simultaneously disabling all of the content-filtering protocols).

It produces expensive luxury jewels in large quantities and was once considered the company charging prices with highest profit margins in the world. However, it also sold goods at cheap prices and was considered the main enterprise establishing the trend of using luxury gems as a fashion commodity in the general public of Japan.

His work spans a wide range of styles, including jazz, R&B;, Latin, rock, pop, easy listening, funk and hip hop. He won a 2002 Latin Grammy for Thal√≠a's \\"Arrasando\\", four 2004 Latin Grammys for Alejandro Sanz's \\"No Es Lo Mismo\\" (including Best Engineered Album), and the 2006 Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical, for Eric Clapton's \\"Back Home.\\" As of 2001, he had mixed 27 # 1 singles. He also won multiple awards for the engineering and mixing of the Daft Punk album Random Access Memories. Early life Guzauski grew up in Rochester, New York, where there were no commercial sound studios. In high school he put together his own studio in his parents' basement with equipment that he borrowed, built, repaired, and modified. He did pickup engineer work with Steve Gadd and Tony Levin, then students at the Eastman School of Music, and Lou Gramm, who soon hit it big with Foreigner. Career Around the same time, he met Chuck Mangione, an up-and-coming composer in Rochester, and engineered his recordings as well as mixed his live sound. When Mangione signed with A&M; Records in 1975, he asked Guzauski to go to Los Angeles with him to engineer his new album, a recording with a 45-piece orchestra with a rhythm section and soloists at A&M; studios. Guzauski engineered several albums for Mangione over the next few years. 1980s In the early 1980s, Guzauski worked with Maurice White and Earth, Wind and Fire at the Complex (then George Massenburg Studios). Conway Studios in L.A. became his home base in the mid-1980s, where he engineered and mixed projects for Burt Bacharach, Dionne Warwick, Mr. Mister, Madonna, Talking Heads, Johnny Mathis, Henry Mancini, Patti LaBelle, Stanley Clarke, George Duke, Quincy Jones, The Stabilizers, Michael Bolton, Kenny G, George Benson, and Cher. 1990s on In 1991, Walter Afanasieff asked him to mix a Michael Bolton record he was working on. Guzauski still does work for both of them. Afanasieff then hired him to mix a Mariah Carey album in 1993. Tommy Mottola, then CEO of Sony, liked his mixes and asked him to relocate to New York and work for him at Sony Music Studios. Guzauski accepted Mottola's offer, and worked on albums with Mottola at Sony and at Mariah Carey's home studio, doing mostly female ballads. He also mixed projects for David Foster, Babyface, Boyz II Men, and All-4-One. In 2001, Guzauski worked with Michael Jackson to create 5.1-channel surround sound remixes of Thriller as well as all his other albums for release on the then new Super Audio CD format yet despite numerous retries the artist never approved any of the mixes. Current work Guzauski now works from his private studio, Barking Doctor Recording, located in the basement of his home (in Mount Kisco, New York, about north of New York City). The studio has 2 control rooms, and a small tracking/overdub room. Studio A is built around a Sony OXF-R3 Oxford mixing console and Pro Tools HD Xcel 3 system with Accel cards with 96 channels. Studio B is built around a Yamaha DM-2000 console and standard mixing outboard that he prefers: Eventide SP-2016's (for sparkly, long reverb on vocals, and on ballads), Manley, and GML EQ's, AMS's, EMT Plates, and the Sony 3348HR). At Barking Doctor, he has mixed projects for Brian McKnight, Michael Jackson, LeAnn Rimes, Eric Clapton, The Corrs, BB King, Brandy, Marc Anthony, Jennifer Lopez, Monica Naranjo, Michael McDonald, and Mariah Carey.

Her biography remains somewhat of a mystery. She was possibly born on 17 May 1813, spent most of her adult life in London, and died sometime after 30 March 1869, when she was awarded ¬£25 by the Royal Literary Fund.Records of the Royal Literary Fund, British Library, Loan 96, case number 1/1354, 1854‚Äì1869 She published a two-volume autobiographical work of literary gossip entitled Traits of Character: being Twenty-Five Years' Literary and Personal Recollections, by a Contemporary. Biography It has proven difficult to trace the ancestry and parentage Eliza Rennie, as no contemporary accounts have been found. The following biography is therefore tentative and incomplete, deduced from a comparison of published local and family histories, clues left by Eliza in her own writings, and a search of parish records and census data. Although Mary Shelley's biographer, Emily W. Sunstein, claims that Eliza was born to the famous engineering family Rennie, of John Rennie the Elder and his sons George and John, no corroborating evidence has been found. One possible matching birth record between 1805 and 1820 has been found of an Elizabeth Rennie born on 17 May 1813 to Alexander Rennie and Jean Taylor in the village of Udny, Aberdeenshire. Her father was therefore almost certainly Alexander Home Stirling Rennie, born on 13 June 1797 in Kilsyth, Scotland, a physician who studied medicine at Marischal College, Aberdeen, and upon qualification moved to London between about 1818 and 1820. If her mother was the same Jean Taylor born on 8 June 1798 in Larbert, a few miles from Kilsyth, then Eliza's parents were teenagers when she was born. It is possible that the young couple either eloped or were sent away to a remote area to avoid the stigma of illegitimacy. If the above identifications are correct, then Eliza's grandfather was Robert Rennie of Kilsyth (1762‚Äì1820), a minister of the Church of Scotland, author of treatises on the topic of peat moss, and a contributor to the Statistical Accounts of Scotland. The family was sufficiently distinguished to be the subject of a page or two in Reverend Anton's Kilsyth: a parish history. It seems likely from Eliza's Poems that her mother died when she was very young, though no death record has been traced. She describes a rural childhood with mixed feelings and may have spent some time being cared for by family members in Kilsyth. She was very unhappy, felt betrayed, and apparently moved to London to join her father, possibly following the death of her grandfather in 1824. She spent the rest of her life in London and the home counties, never losing her Scottish identity. Her first definite published work was Poems (1828), released when she was a teenager, possibly as young as thirteen or fourteen. Although it received mixed reviews, it was sufficiently promising to gain her access to literary salons and the companionship of leading figures of the day. She may have been the lover of Lord Henry Dillon, one of the early patrons about whom she wrote extensively in Traits of Character. Life with Mary Shelley and her friends As a teenaged published author in London with a father who had already achieved some professional and social success, Rennie appears to have had many admirers and friends, including Mary Shelley and her literary set. In Traits of Character, she describes a meeting with the Duke of Wellington, with whom she discussed her father and his support of William Wilberforce and the antislavery movement. Her idealism and campaigning activities extended to animal rights activism and other causes. She was a regular churchgoer and interested in Spiritualism. Later life Her father married in 1829, and the household moved to the country in 1834. Her father died in 1838 in a fall from a horse, leaving a widow and at least two young children. Eliza herself most likely married around 1830, as from the early 1830s Eliza published under the name Mrs Eliza Walker. The first known record of her using this name is in 1831, in The Gem, A Literary Annual. pages 173‚Äì189, a short story entitled \\"The Confessional; or, The Two Brothers. A Tale founded on Fact\\" As Mr Walker is never mentioned in her own narratives, the marriage may have ended prematurely or been a sham. She herself claimed in applications for financial assistance that the marriage was bigamous, and that her fortune was embezzled by \\"her brother\\". The Royal Literary Fund archive record stored in the British Library refers to her making four applications for relief, dated 28 Jun 1854 (¬£30), 25 Jan 1861 (rejected), 30 Mar 1863 (¬£25), and 30 Mar 1869 (¬£25).Eliza Walker : Royal Literary Society Nothing else is known about her later private or professional life apart from her own rare autobiographical insights in Traits of Character. She describes a life in London and Scottish society with excursions to spa towns and meetings with celebrities and her publishers. She produced a steady string of short stories for the periodicals of the day, and also writes about receiving a small legacy, possibly from her father's estate or from one of her wealthy admirers. She also writes about her inordinate fondness for her pet terrier, which was dognapped on two occasions for ransom (apparently a popular crime in London in the mid-19th century). Her place and date of death are unknown, and further research is needed. Mary Shelley refers to her just once in her own correspondence.Newly Uncovered Letters and Poems by Mary Wollstonecroft Shelley: Betty T Bennett, Keats-Shelley Journal Vol 46, (1997) pp 51‚Äì74.

He attended schools in Groton and Homer, in Cortland County, then attended Hamilton College. He taught and worked as a carpenter to support himself during those studies and graduated in 1854. Then he studied law while teaching at academies in Aurora and Moravia, both in nearby Cayuga County. On May 10, 1859, Willoughy married schoolteacher Jennie Rebecca Woodbury in Groton. They would have twin sons Westel Woodbury Willoughby (1867-1945) and William F. Willoughby (1867-1960) and a daughter. Mr. and Mrs. Willoughby would be active in the Presbyterian Church, and Willoughby in YMCA, and their sons both became prominent academics and public administrators. Career Willoughby was admitted to the New York bar at Oswego. He then began his private legal practice back home in Groton. American Civil War During the American Civil War, Willoughby helped recruit soldiers for the 137th New York Volunteer Regiment, and received an officer's commission on November 1, 1862. At the Battle of Chancellorsville on May 3, 1863, he was severely wounded in an artillery barrage. Willoughby recovered enough for release from the hospital, but resigned his commission due to his injuries in September. Virginia prosecutor, judge and politician Willoughby remained in Union-occupied Alexandria, Virginia and was admitted to the Virginia bar. In 1864, he won election and on July 5, 1864 assumed office as Alexandria's Commonwealth Attorney (a/k/a prosecutor, including for the portions which later became Arlington County). In May 1866, local judge H. W. Thomas refused to allow an African American woman to testify as a witness against a white man, citing an old state law. Willoughby appealed to the federal court and secured an indictment against Judge Thomas (who had reportedly years earlier barred the Fairfax courthouse doors to intimidate Unionist voters) for violating the witness' civil rights. Willoughby also allowed African Americans to sit on juries. Furthermore, he and his wife were among the initial organizers of the Virginia State Women Suffrage Association. During Congressional Reconstruction, Major General John Schofield dismissed Judge Thomas and other judges pursuant to a new federal statute which forbade all former Confederates from holding state offices. Willoughby was appointed to replace Judge Thomas on March 22, 1869, as judge of the Ninth Circuit, which encompassed Alexandria, Fairfax, Fauquier, Loudoun, Prince William, Rappahannock, and Stafford counties. On June 3, Schofield dismissed all three member of the Court of Appeals of Virginia (which later became the Virginia Supreme Court) due to that new law. Schofield appointed Willoughby and two other former Union Officers to that body. When the new Virginia Constitution of 1869 was adopted, he was allowed to remain in office until the General Assembly reorganized the state judiciary. The Court on which he sat met June 22 to 28, and on October 12, 1869, and finally from January 11 to February 25, 1870. Judge Willoughby wrote 6 of the 8 opinions it issued.http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Willoughby_Westel_1830-1897#start_entry Willoughby then became a director of the Virginia Peat Company and also resumed his private legal practice in Alexandria.

They were at shooting distance of one another which allowed the defense of a wide area without the cost of a continuous defensive wall. The first one was built (1865-1872) by the British Army and the other ones by private businesses (1865-1869). The costs were almost identical for all three, ranging from 57,600 to 59,762 pounds. During the American Civil War, Great Britain claimed to remain neutral in the conflict. However, the cotton directly imported from the south of the United States still had a great importance in the British textile industry. Following the Civil War, the British were still expecting an American invasion of Canada. The tense political relationship between Austria and Prussia had the British worried about their wood supply, if the access to the Baltic Sea was blocked. The Canadian forests would then be used as Great Britain's main wood supply. Lieutenant-Colonel William Jervois was sent to Canada to establish the Canadian defence plan. He suggested that detached forts be built on Pointe- L√©vy, on the south shore of Quebec City. The original plans recommended 5 forts, of which 3 were actually built. None of the three were ever occupied as they were no longer considered necessary after the signing of the Treaty of Washington in 1871.

Primary education takes place in primary school, the elementary school or first and middle school depending on the location. The International Standard Classification of Education considers primary education as a single-phase where programmes are typically designed to provide fundamental skills in reading, writing and mathematics and to establish a solid foundation for learning. This is ISCED Level 1: Primary education or first stage of basic education.Annex III in the ISCED 2011 English.pdf Navigate to International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) Definition The ISCED definition in 1997 posited that primary education normally started between the ages of 5 ‚Äì 8, and was designed to give a sound basic education in reading, writing and mathematics along with an elementary understanding of other subjects. By 2011 the philosophy had changed, the elementary understanding of other subjects had been dropped in favour of \\"to establish a solid foundation for learning\\". The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), believes that providing children with primary education has many positive effects. It * Decreases poverty * Decreases child mortality rates * Encouraging gender equality * Increases environmental understanding The ages cited cover a rapidly developing phase of child development. This is studied in the discipline of developmental psychology, which among other things attempts to describe how children learn. In Great Britain, reception, the first year of primary school, is part of the Early Year Foundation Stage. The Philosophy of education, of teaching and learning, has, over the millennia, occupied may great minds. It attempts to say what children should be taught. History In agrarian cultures, the skills of husbandry, bartering, and building skills can be passed on from father to son or master to apprentice. Societies agree on the need for their children to learn and absorb their cultural traditions and beliefs and they attempt to do this informally in the family, or by gathering the children together and employing one adult to handle the task, a tutor. This leads to religious communities to become providers of education and defining the curriculum. Learning to recite passages from their holy text is a priority. For their society to advance, the oral tradition must be superseded by written texts; some students must go on and write down the passages. Many students need to read out what is written. This led to formal education in madrassas and schools. Trading and management create a demand for accountancy. Basic skills thus included literacy and numeracy. Child development during the primary education phase Jean Piaget was responsible for establishing the framework that describes the intellectual, moral and emotional development of children. He received a doctorate in 1918 and did post-doctoral research in Z√ºrich and Paris. His thoughts developed in four phases: # the sociological model of development- where children moved from a position of egocentrism to sociocentrism. he noticed there was a gradual progression from intuitive to scientific and then socially acceptable responses. # the biological model of intellectual development -this could be regarded as an extension of the biological process of the adaptation of the species, showing two on-going processes: assimilation and accommodation. # the elaboration of the logical model of intellectual development, where he argued that intelligence develops in a series of stages that are related to age and are progressive because one stage must be accomplished before the next can occur. For each stage of development, the child forms an age-related view of reality. # the study of figurative thought- this included memory and perception. Piaget's theory is based upon biological maturation and stages; the notion of readiness is important. Information or concepts should be taught when the students have reached the appropriate stage of cognitive development and not before. Using this framework, the child's staged development can be examined. Lev Vygotsky's theoryYasnitsky, A. (2018) Vygotsky: An Intellectual Biography. London and New York: Routledge BOOK PREVIEW is based on social learning, where a MKO (a more knowledgeable other) helps them progress within their ZPD (zone of proximal development). Within the ZPD there are skills that the child potentially could do but needs to be shown so they can move from yearning to independent proficiency. The assistance or instruction becomes a form of Instructional scaffolding; this term and idea was developed by Jerome Bruner, David Wood, and Gail Ross.Zone of Proximal Development and Cultural Tools Scaffolding, Guided Participation, 2006.

Retrieved from Credo Reference Database These are in the realms of the: * Intellectual * Physical * Learning skills * Language * Emotional International interpretations Millennium Development Goals A poster at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City, New York, United States, showing the Millennium Development Goals The United Nations Millennium Development Goal 2 (2002) was to achieve universal primary education by the year 2015, by which time their aim was to ensure that all children everywhere, regardless of race or gender, will be able to complete primary schooling. Due to the fact that the United Nations specifically focused on Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, as they are both home to the vast majority of children out of school, they hypothesized that they might not have been able to reach their goal by 2015. According to the September 2010 fact sheet, this was because there were still about 69 million school-age children who were not in school with almost half of the demographic in sub-Saharan Africa and more than a quarter in Southern Asia. In order to achieve the goal by 2015, the United Nations estimated that all children at the official entry age for primary school would have had to have been attending classes by 2009. This would depend upon the duration of the primary level, as well as how well the schools retain students until the end of the cycle. Not only was it important for children to be enrolled in education, but countries would have to ensure that there were a sufficient number of teachers and classrooms to meet the demand. As of 2010, the number of new teachers needed in sub-Saharan Africa alone, equaled the extant teaching force in the region. The gender gap for children not in education narrowed. Between 1999 and 2008, the number of girls not in education worldwide had decreased from 57 percent to 53 percent, but in some regions, the percentage had increased. According to the United Nations, there are many things in the regions that have already been accomplished. Although enrollment in the sub-Saharan area of Africa continues to be the lowest region worldwide, by 2010 \\"it still increased by 18 percentage points‚Äîfrom 58 percent to 76 percent‚Äîbetween 1999 and 2008.\\" There was also progress in both Southern Asia and North Africa, where both areas saw an increase in enrollment, For example, In Southern Asia, this had increased by 11 percent and in North Africa by 8 percent- over the last decade. Major advances had been made even in the poorest of countries like the abolition of primary school fees in Burundi where there was an increase in primary-school enrollment which reached 99 percent as of 2008. Also, Tanzania experienced a similar outcome. The country doubled its enrollment ratio over the same period. Moreover, other regions in Latin America such as Guatemala and Nicaragua, and Zambia in Southern Africa \\"broke through the 90 percent towards greater access to primary education.\\"  Promoting the rule of law in primary education  Global citizenship education for the rule of law learning outcomes at the primary level Schools play an important role in children's socialization and in developing their appreciation of sharing, fairness, mutual respect and cooperation. Schools form the foundational values and competencies that are the building blocks towards the understanding of concepts such as justice, democracy and human rights. Education systems that promote education for justice, that is, respect for the rule of law (RoL) together with international human rights and fundamental freedoms strengthen the relationship between learners and public institutions with the objective of empowering young people to become champions of peace and justice. Teachers are often on the front line of this work and, along with families, play a formative role in shaping children's attitudes and behaviours. Global citizenship education provides the overall framework for the approach to the RoL. It aims to empower learners to engage and assume active roles, both locally and globally, as proactive contributors to a more just, peaceful, tolerant, inclusive, secure and sustainable world.

Pane Paraguay's cultural heritage can be traced to the extensive intermarriage between the original male Spanish settlers and indigenous Guaran√≠ women. Their culture is highly influenced by various European countries, including Spain. Therefore, Paraguayan culture is a fusion of two cultures and traditions; one European, the other, Southern Guaran√≠. More than 93% of Paraguayans are mestizos, making Paraguay one of the most homogeneous countries in Latin America. A characteristic of this cultural fusion is the extensive bilingualism present to this day: more than 80% of Paraguayans speak both Spanish and the indigenous language, Guaran√≠. Jopara, a mixture of Guaran√≠ and Spanish, is also widely spoken. This cultural fusion is expressed in arts such as embroidery (ao po'√≠) and lace making (√±andut√≠). The music of Paraguay, which consists of lilting polkas, bouncy galopas, and languid guaranias is played on the native harp. Paraguay's culinary heritage is also deeply influenced by this cultural fusion. Several popular dishes contain manioc, a local staple crop similar to the yuca also known as Cassava root found in the Southwestern United States and Mexico, as well as other indigenous ingredients. A popular dish is sopa paraguaya, similar to a thick corn bread. Another notable food is chipa, a bagel-like bread made from cornmeal, manioc, and cheese. Many other dishes consist of different kinds of cheeses, onions, bell peppers, cottage cheese, cornmeal, milk, seasonings, butter, eggs and fresh corn kernels. The 1950s and 1960s were the time of the birth of a new generation of Paraguayan novelists and poets such as Jos√© Ricardo Maz√≥, Roque Vallejos, and Nobel Prize nominee Augusto Roa Bastos. Several Paraguayan films have been made. Inside the family, conservative values predominate. In lower classes, godparents have a special relationship to the family, since usually, they are chosen because of their favorable social position, in order to provide extra security for the children. Particular respect is owed them, in return for which the family can expect protection and patronage.  Guarani Jesuit Missions  Paraguay was in its maximum extension the old Paraguayan Province, a Jesuit administration belonging to the Viceroyalty of Peru and whose clerical capital was the city of C√≥rdoba. During the 17th and 18th centuries, 30 reductions were built in this province, which are currently distributed in three countries: 8 in Paraguay, 15 in Argentina and 7 in Brazil. In 1609 the first reduction of San Ignacio Guaz√∫ was created, and since then, the other towns were rising, subdivided into 23 Western Missions (in southern Paraguay and in the current provinces of Misiones and Corrientes) and the 7 Eastern Missions in southwest Brazil. The Jesuits were expelled in 1768, reason why the towns entered decay and their settlers were in need of migrating to other areas of Paraguay, Misiones and Corrientes. In these places there are still vestiges of its architectural and urban structure. Since the Spanish-Guaran√≠ syncretism, the Guaran√≠ Jesuit missions laid the foundations for the Guaran√≠ alphabet and literature, Paraguayan cuisine, Paraguayan music and other arts. In terms of literary creation, musical composition, regional gastronomy and the entire amalgam of Paraguayan artistic expressions, the arts learned in the missions continued to evolve along with contributions from other immigrants from the late 19th century and throughout the 20th century. Among the cultural reminiscences transmitted by Jesuits-Guaran√≠es, both tangible and intangible, are the Paraguayan harp, Paraguayan polka, chamam√©, missionary music, consumption of yerba mate, starch and corn-based foods such as chipa and Chipa Guasu, the Guaran√≠ language that achieved its status as a regulated language and which is one of the official languages of Paraguay thanks to it. Two of the eight Paraguayan reductions were declared UNESCO World Heritage sites. Both towns are in Itap√∫a Department, in the ruins of Jes√∫s and Trinidad, located about 50 km from the departmental capital Encarnaci√≥n. The Jes√∫s de Tavarang√º√© Mission complements the tourist circuit with the projection of a 3D video mapping. The intention is that visitors can connect directly with the history of the creation and development of the 30 towns founded by the Society of Jesus. The 3D mapping recreates the activities and the evangelizing work of Jesuit people and the large history of these missions.  Philosophy  French philosophical theories became popular with Latin American intellectuals as the Spanish Empire was coming to an end. Arturo Ardao mentions that Condillac was held in high regard by the people of Rio de la Plata region. After becoming independent, the new republics founded universities and hired teachers from Europe who spread rationalist ideals. Among Paraguayan scholars of the early 19th century were the physicians and .  Sports  Estadio Defensores del Chaco in Asunci√≥n. Sport in Paraguay is an important part of the country's national culture. Football is the most popular sport, and basketball is also very popular.

Seth Johnson, a recent ex- Derby player was compared to him for his hard working attitude on the pitch. He is rated by many people as being one of the most loyal Derby County players ever for his services and contribution to the club. He played 455 league games for Derby, which is the second highest in Derby County's history, (only Kevin Hector played more), from 1960‚Äì1978, scoring 7 times. Ron was part of the Brian Clough and Peter Taylor era at Derby, and then the just as successful Dave Mackay era. Webster was an integral part of a near unbeatable defence. Webster retired in 1977 after his last game (a 1‚Äì1 draw with Chelsea). Webster stayed on at Derby as coach, but is now retired.

It involved patterned skin lesions that were S-shaped on the abdomen, V-shaped over the upper spinal region with an inverted U-shape from the breast onto the upper arm. Blaschko had based his findings on examinations of over 140 patients with nevoid and acquired linear skin diseases. This unusual patterned condition was later referred to as \\"lines of Blaschko\\".

Biography Vincent born on 2 November 1739 in Limehouse Street Ward, London, was the fifth surviving son of Giles Vincent, packer and Portugal merchant, by Sarah (Holloway). Theological career William was admitted at Westminster School as a 'town boy' in 1747; he became a king's scholar in 1753, and in 1757 was elected to Trinity College, Cambridge. After graduating as BA in 1761, he returned to Westminster as usher. He became second master in June 1771, and in the same year was made chaplain in ordinary to the king. He graduated MA in 1764 and DD in 1776, and two years later received the vicarage of Longdon, Wiltshire, which, however, he exchanged within six months for the rectory of All Hallows, Thames Street. In 1784 he became sub-almoner to the king. He shared the tory views of his family, and in 1780 published anonymously a Letter in reply to a sermon preached at Cambridge by Richard Watson. A sermon preached by him in 1792 at St. Margaret's, Westminster, for the benefit of the greycoat charity, attracted attention, and when reprinted in the following year by the Patriotic Association against republicans and levellers, twenty thousand copies were sold. Headmaster of Westminster School Meanwhile, in 1788, Vincent had been appointed headmaster of Westminster. He held the position for fourteen years, respected alike for both scholarship and character. His swinging pace, sonorous quotations, and especially his loud call of \\"Eloquere, puer, eloquere\\" (\\"Speak out, boy!\\") dwelt long in the memory of his scholars. His name is perpetuated by his enclosure of part of the nearby Tothill Fields for his old school as a playground, called Vincent Square after him. As the waste marshlands of the Tuttle or Tothill Fields were beginning to be built over, Vincent simply employed a man with a horse to plough a ditch around an area of some eleven acres; his receipt for the fee is in the Abbey archives. In his adherence to corporal punishment he resembled his predecessor, Richard Busby; and in 1792 he expelled Robert Southey for his contributions to an anti-flogging periodical, The Flagellant. The attention he paid to his pupils' religious education rendered him well qualified to answer the attacks of Thomas Rennell, master of the Temple, and Thomas Lewis O'Beirne, bishop of Meath, who had charged headmasters with neglecting this branch of their duties. Vincent's Defence of Public Education, issued as a reply to the latter in 1801, reached a third edition two years later, and occasioned some controversy. In April 1801 he was nominated by William Pitt, the Prime Minister, to a canonry of Westminster. When in the following year Pitt's successor, Henry Addington, offered him the deanery of Westminster \\"as a public reward for public services\\", this was understood to refer to his recent publication. He was presented as dean on 3 August 1802, becoming the first dean since the late 17th century not to have held the office in conjunction with that of Bishop of Rochester. In 1805 Vincent obtained the rectory of St John's, Westminster, and resigned that of All Hallows to his son. In 1807 he exchanged St John's for the rectory of Islip, Oxfordshire, where he made his country residence. He had been appointed president of Sion College in 1798, and acted as prolocutor of the lower house of convocation in 1802, 1806, and 1807. The fire which broke out in the roof of the lantern of Westminster Abbey on 9 July 1803 necessitated repairs to the fabric. They were all paid for by the dean and chapter; but in 1805 Vincent addressed a letter to Pitt praying for a national grant for the restoration of the Henry VII Chapel. Fourteen annual grants, beginning from 1807, were received, and the work proceeded under the direction of Thomas Gayfere and Benjamin Wyatt. The restoration was not completed till 1822. The manner in which it was carried out, especially the interference with the tomb of Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester, to make way for the new Addison monument, was severely criticised in the Gentleman's Magazine by John Carter, the architect. Vincent replied by the jeux d'esprit Woodstock's Ghost and Addison's Ghost, satirical verses directed against Carter and William Capon, the scene-painter. He also directed the restoration of the great rose or marigold window; and caused the enormous monuments of Captains Harvey, Hutt, and Montagu (killed in Admiral Howe's victory of the \\"Glorious First of June\\" 1794) to be removed from between the pillars of the nave to their present positions. Pitt and Charles James Fox were buried in the abbey in 1806, and the Duc de Montpensier (brother of Louis-Philippe) in the Henry VII Chapel in the following year. Minute accounts of the repairs executed at the abbey and of the chapter business while he was dean are given in a manuscript notebook of Vincent's, which is still preserved at the deanery. The book also contains an account by him of the 16th and 17th-century chapter-books, and an analysis and criticism of Flete's manuscript Chronicle of the Abbey. Classical scholar Vincent made his reputation as a classical scholar by the publication of a Latin treatise entitled De Legione Manlian√¢ Qu√¶stio ex Livio desumta, et rei militaris Roman√¶ studiosis proposita. In this, by means of an ingenious emendation, he reconciled the apparently conflicting statements of Livy and Polybius respecting the legion. Porson and Heyne gave a general assent to his views. Only four copies of the work are said to have been sold. In the next year Vincent published The Origination of the Greek Verb: an Hypothesis, followed in 1795 by The Greek Verb Analysed: an Hypothesis in which the Source and Structure of the Greek Language in general is considered. He found the reasons for the inflections of the verbs in their derivations from \\"a simple and very short original verb signifying to do or exist\\", which being afterwards subjoined to radicals, denoting various actions and modes of being, formed their tenses, modes, and other variations. Vincent had to defend his work against the charges of insufficient research and plagiarism (from a writer in the ‚ÄòEncyclop√¶dia Britannica'), advanced in the Hermes Unmasked of Thomas Gunter Browne. His views did not succeed in holding their ground. Geographer But ancient geography was the subject which Vincent made his chief study. In 1797 he issued his commentary on Arrian's Voyage of Nearchus (contained in the Indica), which he terms 'the first event of general importance to mankind in the history of navigation'. Friedrich Schmieder, a later editor of Arrian, translated Vincent's arguments into Latin and subjoined them as a complete answer to the objections of Dodwell. Vincent had the assistance of Alexander Dalrymple, hydrographer to the admiralty, who prepared charts, and of Samuel Horsley, then dean of Westminster, who furnished two astronomical dissertations. The subject was pursued in The Periplus of the Erythr√¶an Sea, which appeared in two parts in 1800 and 1805. These three commentaries, which occupied Vincent's leisure during eight years, were dedicated to George III. The Commerce and Navigation of the Ancients in the Indian Ocean, 2 vols., issued in 1807, forms a second edition of the whole work. It was dedicated to Lord Sidmouth. It contains contributions by Professor Heyne, Dr. Schneider, and Niebuhr, as well as by Sir Gore Ouseley, Dr. Burney, and William Wales. McCulloch termed it a most valuable contribution to the geography of antiquity and the history of commerce. An English translation of the Voyage of Nearchus and of the Periplus was published separately by Vincent in 1809. Gleanings from the Asiatick Researches of the learned Dr. Vincent, was privately printed in 1813 by Joseph Thomas Brown. Vincent also contributed notes to Gibbon's Inquiry into the Circumnavigation of Africa, and to the Classical Journal articles on Ancient Commerce, China as known to Classic Authors, The Geography of Susiana, and Theophilus an African Bishop. For the first series of the British Critic, conducted by his friend Nares, he wrote several important reviews, and, in connection with the Troad controversy, attacked the views of Jacob Bryant, whom he charged with falsifying passages in Diodorus Siculus. Vincent was also a frequent contributor to The Gentleman's Magazine. Death and appreciation Terracotta plaque of William Vincent installed in Vincent Square in 2010 Vincent died at Islip on 21 December 1815, and was buried in St Benedict's Chapel, Westminster Abbey, on 29 December 1815. His monument, between those of South and Busby, bears a Latin inscription composed by himself. In 1771 he married Hannah, fourth daughter of George Wyatt, chief clerk of the vote office, House of Commons. She died on 17 February 1807, leaving children. There is a mural tablet to her with an inscription by her husband in the north transept of the abbey. William Beloe thought Vincent one of the soundest scholars in Europe, an opinion corroborated by Thomas James Mathias in Pursuits of Literature (third dialogue). The dramatist Richard Cumberland also speaks of him in high terms in his Memoirs. The poet William Cowper made an English translation of some Latin verses written by Vincent, when second master at Westminster, on his predecessor Pierson Lloyd. A French version of Vincent's great work on ancient navigation was made under the sanction of Napoleon by M. Billecoq; and in Germany, where his works were well known, his scholarship was recognised by a degree from G√∂ttingen in 1814. \\"Next to Rennell, and beyond him in some respects,\\" says Sir Clements Markham, \\"Vincent was the greatest comparative geographer of his time.\\" See also *List of Deans of Westminster References External links * ;Attribution Category:1739 births Category:1815 deaths Category:18th-century English Anglican priests Category:19th-century English Anglican priests Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge Category:Burials at Westminster Abbey Category:Canons of Westminster Category:Deans of Westminster Category:English geographers Category:Fellows of Trinity College, Cambridge Category:Head Masters of Westminster School Category:Members of The Club Category:People educated at Westminster School, London ","title":"William Vincent (priest)"},{"id":"11722180","text":"William Brayton may refer to: * William Daniel Brayton (1815‚Äì1887), U.S. Representative from Rhode Island * William Brayton (Vermont judge) (1787‚Äì1828), Vermont attorney, politician, and judge ","title":"William Brayton"},{"id":"11722198","text":"Laz-D (born Cameron Lasley in 1982) is an American rapper with Down syndrome.

Plot summary The film presents a recently released safe-cracker named Ben, and an undercover police agent named Melody. Melody's job is to dupe Ben into another job so that he can be put away once more by her sinister and ambitious boss Kahnitz. But complications arise when the talkative cop falls for the taciturn gangster. The film features a complex neo-noir flashback structure that centers on seemingly dead characters littering the bloody floor of a fancy apartment. As the story progresses, we find out that some of these dead people are not dead at all, more are hiding in the closet, and slowly the pieces of the puzzle come together in classic film noir fashion, but with a distinctly modern edge. Production history Based in an original English-language screenplay by I, Robot writer Jeff Vintar, the English-language version of Vintar's screenplay struggled to reach the screen for many years. The work was under a variety of producers and production companies; hence, the script was under option for a very long time. At one time, Gustavo Mosquera, who had directed Moebius, was slated as its director, with John Woo and partner Terence Chang producing under their Lion Rock banner. The screenplay that eventually made it to the screen was developed by the production company Circle of Confusion. Shortly before the movie's release, the film's producers \\"got cold feet\\" and re-edited the film to give it a linear narrative, which became the version that made it to the screen. Cast Critical reception The film became a cult favorite among noir buffs, and received a positive review in Variety that predicted that the film would play in broad-minded festivals around the world, and that genre fans would \\"lap it up\\". The final editing that gave the film its linear narrative is said to have diluted its \\"effect\\", which resulted in its polarizing critics and audience members alike.

(abbreviated as ICHC) is a blog-format website featuring videos (usually involving animals) and image macros. It was created in 2007 by Eric Nakagawa (Cheezburger), from Hawaii, and his friend Kari Unebasami (Tofuburger). The website was one of the most popular Internet sites of its kind receiving as many as 1,500,000 hits per day at its peak in May 2007. ICHC was instrumental in bringing animal-based image macros and lolspeak into mainstream usage and making Internet memes profitable. ICHC was created on January 11, 2007, when Nakagawa posted an image from comedy website Something Awful of a smiling British Shorthair cat, known as Happycat, with a caption of the animal asking, \\"I can has cheezburger?\\" in a style popularised by 4chan. It is from this image that the site derives its name. After posting similar images, Nakagawa then converted the site to a monetized blog. A group of investors acquired the website in September 2007 for US$2 million. The blog became the flagship site of the Cheezburger Network, led by Ben Huh. The network also includes FAIL Blog and Know Your Meme. In 2016 the network was acquired by Literally Media.  Content  ICHC's content is submitted by the site's readers, and hosts \\"the LOL Builder\\", an image macro creation tool. The number of submissions has risen dramatically with the growth of the site. In July 2007, ICHC received as many as 500 submissions per day. By January 2008, the average was 8000.

The site attempts to maintain a community feel, encouraging interactivity with readers via a voting system where users can rate an image from one to five \\"cheezburgers\\", and through themes as one image will attract responses to form a continuous narrative. According to Nakagawa, \\"It's like you're creating a story supplied by people in the community, and then the people in the community supply the next part of the story.\\" Until 2013, ICHC also ran a wiki at SpeakLolSpeak.com designed to be a collection of important lolspeak phrases. Popular trends on the ICHC website for captioning have included \\"ceiling cat\\" (usually a white cat); \\"basement cat\\" (a black cat); the \\"itteh bitteh kitteh committeh\\"; invisible [something]; the Lolrus and his \\"bukkit\\"; fail (now moved to FAIL Blog); \\"om nom nom\\" (as in eating sounds); references to \\"cheezburgers\\"; \\"happy caturday\\"; \\"monorail kitteh\\"; \\"oh hai\\"; and \\"kthxbai\\" (\\"OK, thanks, goodbye\\"). ICHC has popularized snowclones such as \\"I'm in your (noun), (verb ending in ing) your (noun)\\"; \\" [some activity or emotion], ur doin it right/wrong\\"; and \\"I gave/brought you [something] but I eated it/uzed it all up\\". Fonts The typeface Impact is used in almost every picture on all the I Can Has Cheezburger websites (though not as much on its subsidiary websites, such as Memebase), and has even gone as far as to be attempted to be replicated in an oil painting representation of the original \\"Happy cat\\" (the original lolcat to say \\"I Can Has Cheezburger?\\") on the ICHC website. This use of the font stems from it being the font of choice in Something Awful image macros for manyWhatport80.com, History and design of image macros hence it is the default font in the site's Lolcat Builder. Many people creating lolcats in other software have used the same font to retain the classic I Can Has Cheezburger look. Other standard fonts are available on the builder. Spin-off projects and publications A network of related sister sites has developed alongside ICHC, called the Cheezburger Network. 25 of these are linked to each other via a navigation bar at the top of each site. LOLwork on Bravo chronicled employees lives at the ICHC office. ICHC produced a book, I Can Has Cheezburger?: A LOLcat Colleckshun, in 2008. A second ICHC book, How To Take Over The Wurld: An LOLcat Guide 2 Winning, was published in 2009. Also, FAIL Blog released its first book, Fail Nation: A Visual Romp Through the World of Epic Fails, on October 6, 2009. Cheezburger was the subject of the LOLwork reality television series on the Bravo television network. The series followed Ben Huh and his staff as they created new content for the site. #ICanHazPDF, derived from I Can Has Cheezburger?, is a hashtag used on Twitter by researchers seeking academic papers for free to get around academic journals' paywalls.
