It is essentially the same as Kinetic Monte Carlo. Unlike the Metropolis Monte Carlo method, which has been employed to study systems at equilibrium, the DMC method is used to investigate non-equilibrium systems such as a reaction, diffusion, and so-forth (Meng and Weinberg 1994). This method is mainly applied to analyze adsorbates' behavior on surfaces. There are several well-known methods for performing DMC simulations, including the First Reaction Method (FRM) and Random Selection Method (RSM). Although the FRM and RSM give the same results from a given model, the computer resources are different depending on the applied system. In the FRM, the reaction whose time is minimum on the event list is advanced. In the event list, the tentative times for all possible reactions are stored. After the selection of one event, the system time is advanced to the reaction time, and the event list is recalculated. This method is efficient in computation time because the reaction always occurs in one event. On the other hand, it consumes a lot of computer memory because of the event list. Therefore, it is difficult to apply to large-scale systems. The RSM decides whether the reaction of the selected molecule proceeds or not by comparing the transition probability with a random number. In this method, the reaction does not necessarily proceed in one event, so it needs significantly more computation time than FRM. However, this method saves computer memory because it does not use an event list. Large- scale systems are able to be calculated by this method.

An Indo ‚Äì as Eurasians of Indonesian and Dutch descent ‚Äì Berenschot was the son of a Dutch officer in the KNIL. G. J. Berenschot was the son of Gerrit Hendrik Berenschot and Florence Mildred Rappa. At the age of 15, he was sent to the Netherlands, where he attended cadet school at Alkmaar. He later entered the Royal Military College, from which he graduated first in his class. He was the only commander of Indonesian descent (Indo) in the Dutch East Indies. Upon graduation, he returned to his native East Indies where he distinguished himself as a young subaltern serving in the KNIL during the bloody campaigns in Aceh. In 1934 he became the KNIL's Chief of the General Staff and, in July 1939, was promoted to Commander-in-Chief. Berenschot was regarded as a gifted officer with organisational skills and possibly the best Commander-in-Chief the KNIL ever had. Not only was he a skilled soldier, Berenschot also displayed an impressive understanding of politics and diplomacy. Following the fall of the Netherlands in 1940, Berenschot participated in conferences involving Allied leaders at Singapore, where he was well liked and well regarded by his British and US counterparts. On October 13, 1941, the plane carrying Bereschot back from a conference with British Air Chief Marshal Robert Brooke-Popham crashed in the suburbs of Batavia. There were no survivors. By order of the colonial authorities, all flags on public buildings were hung at half-mast. Berenschot's remains were buried in the cemetery at Bandung. Bereschot's post of Commander-in-Chief of the KNIL was given to Lieutenant General Hein ter Poorten, who had the difficult task of preparing the East Indies for the looming war with Japan.

On 25 October 2004, it proposed replacing the province's existing first past the post (FPTP) system with BC-STV, a single transferable vote (STV) system. This recommendation was put to the electorate-at-large in a referendum held concurrently with the 2005 provincial election. In order for the results to be binding, the referendum required a super-majority including approval by 60% of voters overall and simple majorities in 60% of the 79 districts in order to pass. In the event, the second of these thresholds was easily met, with a majority supporting the reform in 77 out of 79 electoral districts, but the overall vote fell short of the 60% requirement, with 57.7% of the votes in favour. Another referendum on adopting the STV system was held and defeated during BC's 2009 provincial election. History During the 2001 provincial election, the Liberal Party promised to create a citizens' assembly to consider changes to the provincial electoral system (as opposed to forming a Royal Commission, as New Zealand did). The recommendation of the assembly would then be put as a referendum. In December 2002, Gordon Gibson submitted his report, recommending an assembly composed of randomly selected citizens, two from each of the province's 79 electoral districts. In May 2003, the Legislature unanimously adopted the concept and most of the details.http://www.ccfd.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=409&Itemid;=284 Selection process Counting the chair, the BC Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform was composed of 161 members: one man and one woman randomly selected from each of BC's 79 electoral districts, two Aboriginal members and a chair. Assembly members were selected by a civic lottery that ensured a gender balance and fair representation by age group and the geographical distribution of the population. Selection of members for the Assembly involved a three-stage process: * Stage one began in August 2003 when 15,800 invitations were mailed to randomly identified British Columbians. To ensure even geographical representation, 200 invitations were extended in each constituency. Invitees were asked if they were willing to put their names into a draw for future candidacy. * In stage two, the names of respondents expressing interest went into a pool for their constituency. Positive respondents were organized into 79 groups of 20, with some structuring to ensure an even split between men and women and reflect the age distribution of individuals in the constituency. These candidates were then invited to information meetings where they heard presentations about the Assembly and were asked to publicly confirm their eligibility and interest in participating. * In stage three, the names of those who responded positively were sealed into envelopes and entered into a final draw. Two people from each district pool, one man and one woman, were selected by random draw for membership in the Citizens' Assembly. Selection into the Assembly continued until December 2003. Two additional members, representing First Nations communities, were added after the selection of the original 158. Assembly proceedings From January to May 2004, the Assembly went through a 12-week \\"Learning Phase\\" involving presentations by experts, group discussions and access to a range of source materials. Work included a review of different electoral systems in usage around the world and their various effects on the political process. This was followed by a public consultation phase lasting from May to June. Assembly members held over 50 public hearings and received a total of 1603 written submissions. Between September and October 2004, the members deliberated over which electoral system to recommend, emphasizing three values deemed most important: fairness of representation, local representation and voter choice. Among the alternatives considered were a Mixed Member Proportional system (MMP) and an STV system. On October 23 and 24, 2004, the Assembly voted on different options in three separate votes. A first vote asked members to express their preference for MMP or STV. This vote yielded a strong, but not unanimous preference for STV: 123 votes for STV vs. 31 for MMP. Members then voted between retaining FPTP or moving to STV. There was a strong preference for STV: 142 votes for STV vs. 11 for retaining FPTP. Finally, the Assembly voted in favour of submitting a recommendation in favour of STV to the public in a referendum on May 17, 2005: 146 in favour vs. 7 against. On December 10, the Assembly's final report, titled \\"Making Every Vote Count: The Case for Electoral Reform in British Columbia\\" was presented to the B.C. legislature by the Assembly. It recommended changing the electoral system to a localized version of STV called BC-STV. A separate final report on the work of the Assembly was submitted to the legislature by the Special Committee on the Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform in February 2005.

In particular it applies to the larvae of the cossid moth Endoxyla leucomochla, which feeds on the roots of the witchetty bush (after which the grubs are named) that is widespread throughout the Northern Territory and found in parts of Western Australia and South Australia. The term may also apply to larvae of other cossid moths, ghost moths (Hepialidae), and longhorn beetles (Cerambycidae). The term is used mainly when the larvae are being considered as food. The grub is the most important insect food of the desert and has historically been a staple in the diets of Aboriginal Australians. Witchetty grubs (Endoxyla leucomochla) of the subfamily Zeuzerinae Terminology The Arabana term for the grub is (with emphasis on initial syllables); means grub, and refers to the shrub, not the grub itself. Similarly, Ngalea peoples referred to the grub as \\"mako wardaruka\\", meaning grubs of the wardaruka (Acacia ligulata) shrub. The Pitjantjatjara name is \\"maku\\". It has been suggested that the word \\"witchetty\\" comes from Adynyamathanha , \\"hooked stick\\", and , \\"grub\\". Traditionally, it is rare for people to dig for them. Description Hunting for Witchetty grubs near Yuendumu, Northern Territory The different larvae are said to taste similar, probably because they have similar wood-eating habits. Edible either raw or lightly cooked in hot ashes, they are sought as a high-protein food by Aboriginal Australians. The raw witchetty grub tastes similar to almonds, and when cooked, the skin becomes crisp like roast chicken, while the inside becomes light yellow, like a fried egg. These grubs live in trees. They can also be found in black wattle trees, and are attributed as the reason why wattles die within 10 to 15 years. The roots of the Acacia kempeana shrub are another source of the grubs. When held, as a defence mechanism, the grubs will secrete a brown liquid. Cultural significance Witchetty grubs feature as Dreamings in many Aboriginal paintings.

As part of a sanitation system that is in place, human waste is collected, transported, treated and disposed of or reused by one method or another, depending on the type of toilet being used, ability by the users to pay for services and other factors. Fecal sludge management is used to deal with fecal matter collected in on-site sanitation systems such as pit latrines and septic tanks. The sanitation systems in place differ vastly across the world, with many people in developing countries having to resort to open defecation where human waste is deposited in the environment, for lack of other options. Improvements in \\"water, sanitation and hygiene\\" (WASH) around the world is a key public health issue within international development and is the focus of Sustainable Development Goal 6. People in developed countries tend to use flush toilets where the human waste is mixed with water and transported to sewage treatment plants. Children's excreta can be disposed of in diapers and mixed with municipal solid waste. Diapers are also sometimes dumped directly into the environment, leading to public health risks. Terminology The term \\"human waste\\" is used in the general media to mean several things, such as sewage, sewage sludge, blackwater - in fact anything that may contain some human feces. In the stricter sense of the term, human waste is in fact human excreta, i.e. urine and feces, with or without water being mixed in. For example, dry toilets collect human waste without the addition of water. Health aspects Human waste is considered a biowaste, as it is a vector for both viral and bacterial diseases. It can be a serious health hazard if it gets into sources of drinking water. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that nearly 2.2 million people die annually from diseases caused by contaminated water. A major accomplishment of human civilization has been the reduction of disease transmission via human waste through the practice of hygiene and sanitation, which can employ a variety of different technologies.  Environmental aspects  Even high-mountains are not free from human waste. Each year, millions of mountaineers visit high-mountain areas. They generate tonnes of feces and urine annually which cause environmental pollution. Human feces pose a greater threat to the mountain environment than uncontrolled deposit of urine, due to the higher pathogen content of feces. Methods of processing Methods of processing depend on the type of human waste: * Sewage is treated via sewage treatment * Sewage sludge is treated by sewage sludge treatment * Fecal matter from dry toilets may undergo composting * Fecal sludge from pit latrines is treated and managed with an approach called fecal sludge management The amount of water mixed with human waste can be reduced by the use of waterless urinals and composting toilets and by recycling greywater. The most common method of human waste treatment in rural areas where municipal sewage systems are unavailable is the use of septic tank systems. In remote rural places without sewage or septic systems, small populations allow for the continued use of honey buckets and sewage lagoons (see anaerobic lagoon) without the threat of disease presented by places with denser populations. Bucket toilets are used by rural villages in Alaska where, due to permafrost, conventional waste treatment systems cannot be utilized. Uses Human waste in the form of wastewater (sewage) is used to irrigate and fertilize fields in many parts of the developing world where fresh water is unavailable. There is great potential for wastewater agriculture to produce more food for consumers in urban areas, as long as there is sufficient education about the dangers of eating such food uncooked.Human Waste Used by 200 Million Farmers, Study Says, National Geographic News, August 21, 2008 See also * Blackwater (waste) *Excretion  References  Category:Biological waste Category:Biodegradable waste management Category:Sanitation Category:Sewerage Category:Animal waste products Category:Excretion Category:Human physiology ","title":"Human waste"},{"id":"1101627","text":"Syntax guessing, also known as guess-the-verb, guess-the-noun and the syntax quest, is a problem sometimes encountered in text-based video games, such as interactive fiction games and multi-user dungeon (MUD) games.

History Marayong is derived from an Aboriginal word 'Marriang' meaning emu or place of cranes. The name was first given by the New South Wales Railways to the railway station when it opened in October 1922.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollen, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia Around 1900‚Äì1905, large areas were subdivided and market gardens and poultry farms were established. The area was part of Quakers Hill but in 1926 the Marayong Progress Association applied to have Marayong made a suburb, in its own right. The area was mostly rural until the 1960s. Housing Commission (public housing) estates, opened in the 1960s, marked the urbanisation of the suburb predominantly south of the railway line. In addition, an industrial area was also released north of the railway line. Population The population of Marayong was 6821 at the 2006 census. The median household income of $993 per week was a bit less than the national average and there were a higher than average number of clerical and administrative workers (18.4%) and technicians and tradesworkers (16.4%). There were a substantial number of people born in the Philippines (6.5%) and the number of Catholics in Marayong (40.6%) was well above the national average. Transport Marayong railway station Marayong railway station is on the Richmond branch of the T1 Western and T5 Cumberland lines of the Sydney Trains network. The provide services out to Richmond and in to the city via Blacktown and Parramatta. Years ago, Motor Rail No. 1 would run between Blacktown stopping at Marayong Station en route. Richmond Road marks the southern boundary of the suburb and provides links to Blacktown and Richmond while the Westlink M7 curls around the suburb and can be accessed via the Sunnyholt Road intersection at Kings Park or the Richmond Road intersection at Dean Park. Schools There are two government-run primary schools in the suburb, Marayong Public and Marayong Heights Public. There is also a Catholic primary school, St Andrews Primary and a high school St Andrews College which is divided into two campuses, the Holy Family campus on Quakers Road catering to years 7-10 and the John Paul II senior campus on Breakfast Road. The nearest government-run high schools are Quakers Hill High School, Blacktown Boys, Blacktown Girls and Doonside Technology High.

They were beheaded during the reign of Diocletian; the date of their execution is given as 25 October 285 or 286. History Born to a noble Roman family in the 3rd century AD, Crispin and Crispinian fled persecution for their faith, ending up at Soissons, where they preached Christianity to the Gauls whilst making shoes by night. While it is stated that they were twin brothers, that has not been proved.Meier, Gabriel. \\"Sts. Crispin and Crispinian.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 4.

Their success attracted the ire of Rictus Varus, governor of Belgic Gaul,See: \\"He is most probably a fictitious character since there was no persecution of Christians in N. Gaul; this area was subject to the Caesar Constantius.\\" who had them tortured and thrown into the river with millstones around their necks.

A 16th century legend links them to the town of Faversham. https://www.faversham.org/history/people/crispin-and-crispianus Veneration The feast day of Saints Crispin and Crispinian is 25 October. Although this feast was removed from the Roman Catholic Church's universal liturgical calendar following the Second Vatican Council, the two saints are still commemorated on that day in the most recent edition of the Roman Church's martyrology. In the sixth century a stately basilica was erected at Soissons over the graves of these saints, and St. Eligius, a famous goldsmith, made a costly shrine for the head of St. Crispinian. They are the patron saints of cobblers, glove makers, lace makers, lace workers, leather workers, saddle makers, saddlers, shoemakers, tanners, and weavers.\\"Crispin and Crispinian\\", Catholic News Agency Cultural references The Battle of Agincourt was fought on Saint Crispin's feastday. It has been immortalised by Shakespeare's St. Crispin's Day Speech (sometimes called the \\"Band Of Brothers\\" Speech) from his play Henry V. Also, for the Midsummer's Day Festival in the third act of Die Meistersinger, Wagner has the shoemakers' guild enter singing a song of praise to St. Crispin.

Remembered for her contributions to the historical understanding of Beothuk culture, including drawings depicting interactions with British settlers, Shanawdithit died of tuberculosis in St. John's, Newfoundland on June 6, 1829. Early life with the Beothuk Shanawdithit was born near a large lake on the island of Newfoundland in about 1801. At the time the Beothuk population was dwindling, their traditional way of life impacted by encroaching European settlements on the island, settler violence, and European diseases against which they had little or no immunity. The Beothuks were also slowly being cut off from the sea, one of their food sources. Beothuks had long avoided Europeans. Trappers and furriers regarded the Beothuks as thieves and would sometimes attack them. As a child, Shanawdithit was shot by a white trapper while washing venison in a river. She suffered from the injury for some time, but recovered. In 1819, Shanawdithit's aunt Demasduwit was abducted by the British under John Peyton Jr. and the few remaining Beothuks fled. In the spring of 1823, Shanawdithit lost her father, who died after falling through ice. Most of her extended family had died from starvation, illness, exposure and British attacks. In April 1823 Shanawdithit, along with her mother, Doodebewshet, and her sister, whose Beothuk name is unknown, encountered trappers while searching for food in the Badger Bay area. William Cull and the three women were taken to St. John's, where Shanawdithit's mother and sister died of tuberculosis. Later life with the British Shanawdithit's drawing of the taking of Demasduit featuring annotations by Cormack. The British renamed Shanawdithit \\"Nancy April\\" and took her to Exploits Island where she worked as a servant in the Peyton household and learned some English. The government hoped she would become a bridge to her people, but she refused to leave with any expedition, saying the Beothuks would kill anyone who had been with the Europeans, as a kind of religious sacrifice and redemption for those who had been killed.Anonymous (James McGregor), \\"Shaa-naan-dithit, or The Last of The Bo√´othics\\", Fraser's Magazine for Town and Country, Vol. XIII, No LXXV (March 1836): 316-323 (Rpt. Toronto: Canadiana House, 1969), Memorial University of Labrador & Newfoundland Website, accessed 16 February 2009 In September 1828, Shanawdithit was relocated to St. John's to live in the household of William Eppes Cormack, the founder of the Beothuk Institution. A Scots emigrant, Newfoundland entrepreneur and philanthropist, he recorded much of what Shanawdithit told him about her people and added notes to her drawings. Shanawdithit stayed in Cormack's care until early 1829 when he left Newfoundland. Cormack returned to Great Britain where he stayed for some time in Liverpool with John McGregor, a Scot whom he had known in Canada, sharing many of his materials on the Beothuks. Following Cormack's departure, Shanawdithit was cared for by the attorney general, James Simms. She spent the last nine months of her life at his home, having been in frail health for a number of years. William Carson tended her, but in 1829 Shanawdithit died in a St. John's hospital after her long fight with tuberculosis. In addition of an obituary announcement in a local St. John's newspaper on June 12, 1829, the death of Shanawdithit was reported in the London Times on September 14, 1829. The announcement noted that Shanawdithit \\"exhibited extraordinary strong natural talents\\" and identified the Beothuk as \\"an anomaly in the history of man\\" for not establishing or maintaining relationships with European settlers or other Indigenous peoples. Following her death Following Shanawdithit's death Carson performed a postmortem and noted peculiarities with the parietal bone of the skull, eventually sending it to Royal College of Physicians in London for study. Shanawdithit's remains were buried in the graveyard of St. Mary the Virgin Church on the south side of St. John's. In 1938, the Royal College of Physicians gave her skull to the Royal College of Surgeons. It was lost in the German Blitz bombing of London in World War II. Meanwhile, in 1903, the church graveyard had been lost to railway construction. The church was torn down in 1963. A monument on the site reads: This monument marks the site of the Parish Church of St. Mary the Virgin during the period 1859‚Äì1963. Fishermen and sailors from many ports found a spiritual haven within its hallowed walls. Near this spot is the burying place of Nancy Shanawdithit, very probably the last of the Beothuks, who died on June 6, 1829. Legacy Statue in Boyd's Cove Shanawdithit played a vital role in documenting what little is known about the Beothuk people. Researcher Ingeborg Marshall has argued that a valid understanding of Beothuk history and culture is directly impacted by how and by whom historical records were created, pointing to the ethnocentric nature of European accounts which positioned native populations as inherently inferior. She notes that without Shanawdithit's accounts of her nation's later life, the Beothuk voice is nearly absent from historical accounts. Shanawdithit was recognized as a National Historic Person in 2000. The announcement coincided with the installation of a statue depicting Shanawdithit by Gerald Squires, titled The Spirit of the Beothuk, at the Beothuk Interpretation Centre near Boyd's Cove. In 2007 a plaque commemorating her life was unveiled at St. John's Bannerman Park acknowledging her contributions to the historical accounts of encounters between the Beothuk and British settlers, and the apprehension of her aunt, Demasduit, by John Peyton Jr. Shanawdithit is widely known among Newfoundlanders. In 1851, a local paper, the Newfoundlander, called her \\"a princess of Terra Nova\\". In 1999, The Telegram readers voted her the most notable aboriginal person of the past 1,000 years. She had 57% of the votes.

The 81st edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion Detroit Tigers and the National League (NL) champion San Diego Padres. The Tigers won the series, four games to one. This was the city of Detroit's first sports championship since the Tigers themselves won the 1968 World Series. This was the first World Series that Peter Ueberroth presided over as commissioner. Ueberroth began his tenure on October 1, succeeding Bowie Kuhn. Ueberroth had been elected as Kuhn's successor prior to the 1984 season, but did not take over until the postseason as he was serving as the chairman of the 1984 Summer Olympics, which ran from July 28 through August 12. This was the last World Series in which the designated hitter was used for games played in a NL team's ballpark in the World Series (as in even-numbered years, the DH would be used in all games, which was first instituted in 1976). The next World Series did not use the DH (as odd-numbered years saw the DH rule not in force for the World Series). Starting in 1986, the DH would only be used in games played at the AL representative's park. Background The San Diego Padres won the National League West division by 12 games over both the Atlanta Braves and the Houston Astros, then defeated the Chicago Cubs, three games to two, in the National League Championship Series. The Detroit Tigers won the American League East division by 15 games over the Toronto Blue Jays, then swept the Kansas City Royals, three games to none, in the American League Championship Series. The World Series was scheduled to start in the National League park. But Major League Baseball actually had a contingency plan to change things and start the World Series in the American League park in the event that the Cubs won the NLCS. This would have allowed the Wrigley Field (i.e. daytime) games to be over the weekend such that the only lost prime time game would have been on Friday, October 12. The 1984 World Series was a rematch between managers Sparky Anderson (Detroit) and Dick Williams (San Diego). The two had previously faced off in the 1972 World Series, with Anderson managing the Cincinnati Reds and Williams helming the victorious Oakland Athletics. The 1984 Series was Anderson's fifth overall as a manager‚Äîin addition to the 1972 Fall Classic, he had also managed the Reds during the 1970 World Series (which they lost to the Baltimore Orioles) and served as skipper during Cincinnati's back-to-back world championships in 1975 and 1976. Anderson's counterpart, Williams, was managing in his fourth World Series; he had headed the Boston Red Sox during the 1967 \\"Impossible Dream\\" season, when they won their first pennant in 21 years in a tight race over the Tigers, Minnesota Twins, and Chicago White Sox. After his Athletics won the 1972 World Series, Williams again led them to victory in the 1973 Series over the New York Mets. Prior to 1984, only three managers (Joe McCarthy, Al Dark and Yogi Berra) had won pennants in both leagues. Nobody had ever won World Series as a manager in both leagues, thus ensuring that the winning manager of the 1984 Series would be the first to do so. The 1984 World Series was also a battle of sorts between the multimillion-dollar American fast food chains. Domino's Pizza founder Tom Monaghan owned the Tigers while McDonald's founder Ray Kroc, who died several months before the 1984 World Series, owned the Padres. The series was informally known as the \\"Fast Food Fall Classic\\". It would feature the first World Series game at Jack Murphy Stadium (Game 1) and the final World Series game at Tiger Stadium (Game 5). Detroit Tigers By May 24, 1984, the Detroit Tigers had just won their ninth straight game with Jack Morris on the mound winning his ninth game of the season. The Tigers record stood at 35‚Äì5, a major league record. In the next three games they would get swept by the Seattle Mariners and settle down to play .500 ball over the next 40 games. But in the end, they would wind up with a franchise record 104 wins and become only the third team in MLB history to lead the league wire-to-wire. These Tigers were strong up the middle featuring all-stars at each middle position with catcher Lance Parrish setting a career high in home runs with 33, the record-setting tandem of Lou Whitaker at second base and Alan Trammell at shortstop (they played together from 1977‚Äì95) and solid center-fielder Chet Lemon. In addition to Morris, the pitching staff was anchored by starters Dan Petry and Milt Wilcox, with eventual Cy Young Award and Most Valuable Player winner, Willie Hern√°ndez (9‚Äì3, 1.92 ERA, 32 saves), closing. The Detroit Tigers signed ageless wonder free-agent Darrell Evans (their first free-agent signing since Tito Fuentes in 1977) prior to the season, and acquired first baseman Dave Bergman in a trade with the Philadelphia Phillies that also brought them the aforementioned Hern√°ndez. Bergman would settle in as the Tigers' everyday first baseman providing steady glove-work. And of course there was \\"Mr. Clutch\\", right-fielder Kirk Gibson, who had a break-out year with 27 home runs, 29 stolen bases, 91 RBIs, and a .282 batting average. After winning two World Championships with the 1975‚Äì76 Cincinnati Reds, manager Sparky Anderson was primed to win his first in the American League in his fifth full season with the Detroit Tigers. Anderson had proved to be somewhat prophetic, as he had made a bold statement in mid-1979 when he joined the Tigers that his team would be a pennant winner within five years.\\"One of a Kind.\\" Retrospective article about Anderson in Sports Illustrated, June 28, 1993. San Diego Padres Williams was in his third season with the San Diego Padres after leading them to identical 81‚Äì81 (.500) records in 1982 and 1983. 1984 would mark only the second time in Padre history that the team would finish over .500, the other being an 84‚Äì78 record in 1978. With the Padres' NL pennant in 1984, Williams became the second manager to take three teams to the World Series (he had previously taken the 1967 Red Sox and the 1972 and 1973 Athletics to the Fall Classic). The Padres set a franchise record for victories with 92 in 1984, being led by two veterans, first baseman Steve Garvey and third baseman Graig Nettles. Statistically, this team was not overwhelming, with Nettles and Kevin McReynolds leading the team with just 20 home runs. (The team eventually would lose McReynolds in Game 4 of the NLCS due to a broken wrist.) No player came close to 100 RBIs (Garvey, 86) or had over 30 doubles in the regular season, although Tony Gwynn won the first of his eight National League batting titles by hitting for a .351 average with 213 hits. The pitching staff was average‚Äîa staff of twentysomethings and a 33-year-old closer, Goose Gossage (10‚Äì6, 25 SVs), who was signed as a free agent from the New York Yankees. Eric Show led the staff with 15 wins with Ed Whitson and lefty Mark Thurmond having identical 14‚Äì8 records. But the sterling bullpen, headed by Gossage and Craig \\"Lefty\\" Lefferts, held the staff together enough to take this team to the \\"Big Show\\" although they would falter and get ripped by the Tiger bats losing the Series in five games. To get to the Series, the Padres had to overcome a two-games-to-none deficit against the Chicago Cubs in the NLCS, rallying to win the final three games. The 1984 Padres adopted Ray Parker Jr.'s \\"Ghostbusters\\" as their theme song (√† la the 1979 Pittsburgh Pirates using Sister Sledge's \\"We Are Family\\" as their theme song). During their playoff series against the Chicago Cubs, the Padre fans turned Ghostbusters into Cubbusters. Summary Matchups Game 1 The Tigers struck first in Game 1 when Lou Whitaker doubled to lead off the top of the first and scored on Alan Trammell's single but their starter Jack Morris (a 19-game winner during the season) struggled in the bottom half, as he surrendered two-out singles to Steve Garvey and Graig Nettles, followed by a two-run double to Terry Kennedy. Padre starter Mark Thurmond took a 2‚Äì1 lead into the fifth, but then surrendered a crucial two-out, two-run homer to Larry Herndon. Nettles and Kennedy both singled to open the San Diego sixth, but Morris snuffed out their momentum by striking out the rest of the side. Kurt Bevacqua started what looked to be a comeback with a leadoff double in the seventh, but was thrown out at third while attempting to stretch the hit into a triple. Despite the close call, Morris remained focused and set down the last nine remaining Padre batters for a complete game, 3‚Äì2 victory. Game 2 In Game 2, Lou Whitaker, Alan Trammell and Kirk Gibson hit consecutive singles to lead off the top of the first and put the Tigers up 1‚Äì0. After Gibson stole second, Trammell scored on Lance Parrish's sacrifice fly, then Darrell Evans's RBI single made it 3‚Äì0 Tigers. Padre starter Ed Whitson was pulled after just innings. In the bottom of the inning, the Padres cut the lead to 3‚Äì1 on Graig Nettles's sacrifice fly, then in the fourth, Bobby Brown's RBI groundout made it 3‚Äì2 Tigers. Kurt Bevacqua then evened the series at 1‚Äì1 with a three-run home run in the fifth-inning off Dan Petry. To date, this remains the only World Series victory in Padres history. Andy Hawkins earned the win with shutout innings while Craig Lefferts pitched a three- inning save. Game 2 at Jack Murphy Stadium marked the last MLB playoff game to date where the DH was used in a National League ballpark. Since then, any World Series game in an American League park uses the DH (previously, the DH was used in alternating World Series), while pitchers bat in the NL parks. The next time the DH rule was used in a National League park was during a regular season series between the Toronto Blue Jays and Philadelphia Phillies during the 2010 season. Game 3 By the time the 1984 World Series rolled around, Tiger Stadium (built in 1912) became the oldest ballpark to ever host a World Series game. That record was eclipsed by Boston's Fenway Park (opened April 20, 1912, the same day as Tiger Stadium), which hosted in , , and , and then by Chicago's Wrigley Field (opened in 1914), which hosted the Fall Classic in until being reclaimed by Fenway Park in , Tim Lollar failed to make it out of the second inning as Detroit erupted for four runs. Chet Lemon singled with one out, then with two outs, Marty Castillo's home run made it 2‚Äì0 Tigers. Lou Whitaker then walked and scored on Alan Trammell's double. A walk and single loaded the bases before Greg Booker relieved Lollar and walked Larry Herndon to force in another run. The Padres got on the board in the third when back- to-back leadoff singles off of Milt Wilcox was followed by an RBI groundout by Steve Garvey, but in the bottom of the inning, Booker walked three to load the bases with two outs. Greg Harris in relief hit Kirk Gibson with a pitch to force in the Tigers' last run. The Padres scored their last run in the seventh on Graig Nettles's sacrifice fly with runners on second and third off of Bill Scherrer. Willie Hern√°ndez pitched innings of one-hit relief for the save. The 5‚Äì2 victory gave the Tigers a two games-to-one series lead. Game 4 Alan Trammell drilled a pair of two-run homers in the first and third innings to account for all of Detroit's offense as the Tigers beat Eric Show to take a three games-to-one lead in the Series. Jack Morris got his second Series victory in another complete-game effort, allowing two runs on Terry Kennedy's home run in the second and a wild pitch in the ninth to Kennedy that scored Steve Garvey, and five hits. Game 5 For the fourth consecutive game, the Padres' starting pitcher did not make it past the third inning, as the Tigers jumped on Mark Thurmond for three runs in the first inning. Lou Whitaker singled to lead off, then Kirk Gibson homered an out later, followed by consecutive singles by Lance Parrish, Larry Herndon and Chet Lemon. The Padres got on the board in the third when Bobby Brown hit a leadoff single off of Dan Petry, moved to third on two groundouts and scored on Steve Garvey's single. The Padres rallied to tie the score in the fourth when with runners on second and third Brown's sacrifice fly and Alan Wiggins's RBI single scored a run each to knock Petry out of the game, but the Tigers loaded the bases in the fifth off of Andy Hawkins when Rusty Kuntz's sacrifice fly put them up 4‚Äì3. Parrish's home run in the seventh off of Rich Gossage made it 5‚Äì3 Tigers, but the Padres cut the lead back to one on Kurt Bevacqua's home run off closer Willie Hern√°ndez. Kirk Gibson came to the plate in the bottom of the eighth for the Tigers with runners on second and third and one out. Gibson had homered earlier in the game, and Padres manager Dick Williams strolled to the mound to talk to Goose Gossage, seemingly with the purpose of ordering him to walk Gibson intentionally. Just before the at-bat, Gibson made a US$10 bet (flashing ten fingers) with his manager Sparky Anderson that Gossage (who had dominated Gibson in the past) would pitch to him. Gossage talked Williams into letting him pitch to Gibson, and Gibson responded with a three-run blast into the upper deck to clinch the Series for the Tigers. Gibson wound up driving in five runs and scoring three, including the run that gave Detroit the lead for good when he raced home on a pop-up sacrifice fly by little-used reserve Rusty Kuntz. In the ninth, Willie Hern√°ndez closed out the series for the Tigers by getting Tony Gwynn to fly to Larry Herndon in left field for the final out. While Alan Trammell won the Sport Magazine variation of the World Series Most Valuable Player Award (the official one), Jack Morris won the Babe Ruth variation. After being fired by the Cincinnati Reds in 1978, Sparky Anderson was hired by the Tigers in June 1979. Anderson, who had led the Reds to Series victories in and , became the first manager to win a World Championship in both the American and National Leagues. Game 5 had a starting time of 4:45 p.m. ET, following a 1:30 p.m. start for Game 4. These were the last outdoor World Series games to start earlier than prime time in the eastern United States (Game 6 in , the last daytime World Series contest, was indoors at the Metrodome in Minneapolis). In addition, no World Series has ended as early as October 14 since 1984; in fact, with the exception of Game 1 in (played on October 14), no World Series has begun earlier than October 15 since 1984. Subsequent expansions of Major League Baseball's postseason‚Äîthe best-of-five League Championship Series becoming best-of-seven affairs in 1985, the addition of wild card teams and the best-of-five Division Series in 1994, and the introduction of one-game Wild Card play-ins in 2012‚Äîhave made earlier World Series calendar dates impossible, even when the regular season has ended on the last Sunday in September.

Because of this, the fantasia, like the impromptu, seldom follows the textbook rules of any strict musical form. History The term was first applied to music during the 16th century, at first to refer to the imaginative musical \\"idea\\" rather than to a particular compositional genre. Its earliest use as a title was in German keyboard manuscripts from before 1520, and by 1536 is found in printed tablatures from Spain, Italy, Germany, and France. From the outset, the fantasia had the sense of \\"the play of imaginative invention\\", particularly in lute or vihuela composers such as Francesco Canova da Milano and Luis de Mil√°n. Its form and style consequently ranges from the freely improvisatory to the strictly contrapuntal, and also encompasses more or less standard sectional forms .  Renaissance and Baroque  According to the Oxford Dictionary of Music, in the 16th century the instrumental fantasia was a strict imitation of the vocal motet . The English composers William Byrd and John Jenkins both wrote and developed fantasias for viol consort, while Henry Purcell's fantasias are the last 17th century examples of the genre. From the Baroque period, J. S. Bach's Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue, BWV 903, for harpsichord; Great Fantasia and Fugue in G minor, BWV 542, for organ; and Fantasia and Fugue in C minor, BWV 537, for organ are examples. Georg Philipp Telemann published Twelve Fantasias for Solo Flute in 1733, and Twelve Fantasias for Solo Violin and Twelve Fantasias for Viola da Gamba solo in 1735.  Classical and Romantic  Examples from the Classical period are Mozart's Fantasia in D minor, K. 397 for fortepiano and his Fantasia in C minor, K. 475. Franz Schubert composed the Fantasie in C major nicknamed the Wanderer Fantasy for solo piano and the Fantasia in F minor for piano four hands. Three works by Chopin belong in the genre: The Fantaisie in F minor, Op. 49, the Polonaise-Fantaisie in A major, Op. 61, and the Fantaisie- Impromptu in C minor, Op. post. 66. The fantasia occupies a central place in Schumann's oeuvre: The great Fantasie op. 17 and the fantasy pieces op. 12, 73 and 111. Later examples of fantasias include Anton Bruckner's Fantasia in G major WAB 118 and the Four Fantasias WAB 215, Busoni's Fantasia contrappuntistica, Vaughan Williams' Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis, and Corigliano's Fantasia on an ostinato.  20th century  Walter Willson Cobbett, in the opening decades of the 20th century, attempted to revive the fantasia style via a competition, to which works like the Phantasie trios and quartets by William Hurlstone, Armstrong Gibbs, John Ireland, Herbert Howells and Frank Bridge owe their existence , as does Benjamin Britten's Phantasy in F minor for string quintet written in 1932, the year in which he also composed a Phantasy Quartet for oboe and strings . According to the musicologist Donald Francis Tovey, \\"the term Fantasia would adequately cover all post-classical forms of concerto\\" .

Prior to 1968, the full-size Holden range of family cars comprised the Holden Standard, the Holden Special, and Holden Premier models. Initially, the HK range of models included the basic Holden Belmont (replacing the Standard), the Kingswood (replacing the Special), and the luxury-oriented Holden Premier, all of which were manufactured in a choice of sedan and station wagon bodies. Commercial variants were offered in three types: coup√© utility, panel van, and later from 1971, a heavy-duty Holden One Tonner cab chassis. The utility (ute) version was originally marketed in both Belmont and Kingswood configurations. However, after the Belmont name was deleted from commercials at the end of HQ in late 1974, the base model commercials were sold only with the \\"Holden\\" badge (the Belmont name continued on sedan and wagon variants until the end of the HX series). A two-door Holden Monaro coup√© and extended-length luxury Holden Brougham were also introduced in mid 1968. For HK, HT, HG and HQ the Holden Monaro carried the ID plate luxury level coding for a Kingswood but never wore Kingswood badges as a production car. HQ-HJ Monaro LS and HQ Monaro LS V8 shared luxury level coding with their respective Premier but also never wore Premier badges. HK-HJ Monaro GTS coupe, HJ Monaro GTS sedan, HT-HQ Monaro GTS V8 coupe and Monaro GTS327/350 coupe (HK-HQ) carried unique luxury level coding. HQ Monaro GTS sedan and HQ Monaro GTS350 sedan shared Kingswood luxury level coding with later examples actually displaying the GTS coupe's Q code on the VIN plate but still retaining the HQ V8 Kingswood's 80469 model coding on the body plate. The Brougham was replaced in 1971 by the Statesman brand, based upon the station wagon chassis of the then new HQ series. For a complete listing of the HK‚ÄìWB series Holden cars, see: list of Holden vehicles by series. A new Kingswood model was introduced at the start of the HX Holden series in mid 1976, the Kingswood panel van. Outside of Australia, the Holden range (including Kingswoods in various body styles) and its derivatives have been sold in New Zealand, parts of Asia, and parts of the South Pacific branded as Holdens. Following the late-1960s import cessation of the Canadian-sourced Chevrolet Impala and Chevelle in South Africa, the Holden Kingswood / Premier and Holden Brougham models were badge engineered as Chevrolet Kommando and Chevrolet Constantia, respectively. Holden-based style-side utilities in South Africa were known as the Chevrolet El Camino.1971 South African Chevrolet El Camino brochure cover, www.moby302.co.za, as archived at web.archive.org Between 1974 and 1978, the one-tonne cab-chassis utility was sold as the Chevrolet El Toro. The Kingswood passenger car and Kingswood panel van ceased production with the demise of the HZ series in 1980, the passenger range succeeded by the smaller Commodore released two years earlier. However, the Kingswood name survived via the utility that comprised part of the WB series range manufactured between 1980 and 1984, sold alongside the WB Statesman and the WB Holden utility, panel van and cab-chassis. A first generation Holden Kingswood sedan is featured in the New Zealand television series, The Brokenwood Mysteries as the vehicle driven by the series star, Neill Rea, in his role as Detective Sergeant Mike Shepherd. Apparently, the car is intended to represent the least glamorous transportation that D.S. Shepherd could possibly obtain. Passengers in Shepherd's car are subjected to his favorite country songs (both well-known and obscure), always played on the car's cassette player. The same array of country songs make up the soundtrack for the series.Brokenwood Mysteries, Series 1-3, 2014‚Äì2016  First generation (1968‚Äì1971)   HK  The Kingswood sedan and wagon were released as part of the new HK series of Holdens in January 1968 (commercials: March 1968). This was an all-new body design, larger and heavier than the previous HR series. The HK series carried over the same local six-cylinder engines, but introduced the first V8 into the Holden range, the fully imported Chevrolet small-block engine. The Monaro and the Brougham were introduced mid-year of 1968, thereby broadening GM's range of locally built full-size cars in Australia.  HT  The HT series launched in May 1969 and with it the introduction of a new locally manufactured Holden and V8 engines. The 253 was available on all HT models except Brougham, and the 308 was available only in Brougham. The Chevrolet V8 engine had remained an option for all HT series models except Brougham until stocks were depleted and it was replaced with the 308. The advertising campaign for this model was 'Never Late, in a Three-Oh- Eight'. The range of three six-cylinder engines carried over to the HT series, however the transmission options for the V8 engines were many and varied. Initially, the 253 V8 only came with either three-speed column- or four-speed floor-mounted manual transmissions. The 307 V8 was only available with two- speed Powerglide automatic. This arrangement continued until the 307 stocks were exhausted, following which the 253 and 308 locally built V8 engines could then be ordered with any manual or automatic transmission across the range, excepting the Holden Brougham which was always specified as a 308 automatic. A new locally manufactured three-speed automatic transmission, the Tri-Matic, was introduced late in the life of the HT range, except on HT Brougham which retained the two-speed automatic Powerglide transmission.  HG  The HG series of July 1970 was a minor refinement of the existing formula, adopted as the marketing platform for the new three-speed automatic transmission option called Tri-Matic. The first of these locally made transmissions actually found their way into the last of the HT series cars. These transmissions were later criticised for unreliability and became colloquially known by dispondants, as the Traumatic. Only the HG Monaro GTS350 retained the Powerglide transmission if an automatic preference was optioned. HG commercial variants continued to be built and sold alongside the HQ series passenger vehicles until very late in 1971 when the HQ commercials were released. These HG commercials were upgraded to the newer specification HQ 173ci and 202ci 6cyl engines but retained the HG specification transmissions (cable kickdown 6cyl and V8 Trimatics and V8 M21 Saginaw) and V8 engines which are believed to have been stockpiled in sufficient quantity to cover expected requirements. These HG commercials can easily be identified by the A prefix on the chassis number appearing on the firewall and for vehicles built for sale inside Australia on the Safety Compliance Plate.  Second generation (1971‚Äì1984)   HQ  The HQ series of 1971 was a completely new design, introducing larger capacity 173-cubic-inch (2.85 L) and 202-cubic-inch (3.3 L) six-cylinder engines, with the continued availability of 253-cubic-inch (4.2 L), 308-cubic-inch (5.0 L) Holden and 350-cubic-inch (5.7 L) Chevrolet V8 engines.Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (Part Two), pp. 67‚Äì68. HQ was the most radically engineered Holden since the introduction of the original 48-215 model of 23 years prior. It featured a perimeter frame and semi-monocoque (unibody) construction, and was the first full-size Holden to have coil spring rear suspension. As a cost-saving measure, HQ was only engineered for right-hand drive, hence it was not feasible to sell the car in left-hand drive markets. Thus Holden exports declined from 41,181 in 1973 to just 7,440 in 1975. Over the following years this led to a large decline in export vehicle revenue needed to fund the HQ-HZ series replacement.Robinson (2006), p. 21. Despite this, HQ became Holden's most popular car, selling 485,650 units, a total yet to be surpassed in a Holden. It was however, sold over a longer timeframe than previous models.Sales figures cover shifted units of all HQ models, including the Monaro and Statesman. At the time, Holden's then managing director, an American named George Roberts, insisted that the HQ Holdens should \\"ride like a Cadillac\\" and that the front suspension be engineered to make the car prone to understeer for \\"safety reasons\\".Wright (1998), pp. 203, 206‚Äì207 Advertising of the car promoted its \\"jet-smooth ride\\" over rough roads. Notwithstanding persistent criticism from many motoring journalists, this policy persisted with the subsequent HJ and HX facelift models. It was arguable whether Australian buyers favoured this engineering philosophy and it was not until the 1977 HZ facelift that radical changes were made to the suspension to improve handling.Wright (1998), pp. 207, 240‚Äì243 HJ (pictured), HX and HZ One Tonner models retained the original HQ One Tonner front fascia. In late 1972, Holden released a special edition version of the HQ Kingswood sedan and wagon, named Kingswood Vacationer.Holden HQ Kingswood Vacationer brochure, page 4, November 1972 Retrieved from www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au on 22 July 2010 This value package of options proved popular and made return appearances on various Holden models during the next twenty years or so. Holden, in 1974 introduced the Sandman, a version of the utility or panel van designed to incorporate many of the features of the Monaro, such as sports instrumentation, sports steering wheel and bucket seats, and \\"rally\\" road wheels with a choice of two six-cylinder and two V8 engines. Other available options included automatic transmission, power steering, and air-conditioning. Sandmans were visually identified by stick-on vinyl decals on the exterior. It gained notoriety during the latter half of the 1970s as a mobile venue for sexual intercourse. Vans earned nicknames as shaggin' wagons and sinbins. In 1971 CKD HQ production started in Thailand. HQ's were also CKD manufactured in Indonesia and the Philippines for many years. There was also a program for Mazda in Japan to produce the HQ from CKD kits, which is believed not to have gone beyond the pilot stage.  HJ  1974‚Äì1976 Holden HJ Premier, the luxury variant of the HJ short-wheelbase range. Released in 1974, the HJ series received some major frontal appearance styling changes, taking away some of the \\"softness\\" of the HQ cars. HJ saw the Belmont name disappear off utilities and panel vans to be replaced with an \\"unbadged\\" specification. HJ also saw the demise of separate models for V8 powered variants, for example in HQ a V8 Kingswood sedan had model code 0469 and its six-cylinder version was 0369. In HJ all Kingswoods were a single model‚ÄîWN69‚Äîregardless of engine. Engine displacement was now expressed in metric terms, and the six-cylinder engine became the standard power unit for all Kingswood variants and higher luxury levels. The six remained the standard engine for the entry-level Belmont and \\"unbadged\\" commercials. As with the engine, the Belmont also saw the omission of front disc brakes, now a standard fitment on all Kingswood models. A couple of special-build variants emerged later in production, initially with the Kingswood Deluxe sedan in July 1975 and later the Kingswood Vacationer II sedan and wagon in November 1975. Added features for these cars included automatic transmission, radial tyres, floor carpeting, radio, and a range of two-tone body colours. Some HJ series Premier based vehicles were assembled by Mazda in Japan, which fitted with the company's rotary engine.Davis, Kennedy, Kennedy (Part Two), p. 71. The car, manufactured between 1975 and 1977 sold as the Mazda Roadpacer was quite heavy and the rotary engine of the time was severely underpowered. To compensate for the lack of performance, Mazda endowed the car with a myriad of electrical gadgets, thus making the performance even worse.  HX  The mid-level model of the HX range, the Kingswood. The HX series release of 1976 saw only minor updates to the exterior, notably the grille and badgework, although base specification utilities and panel vans retained the HJ grill (except Sandman which got HX Kingswood frontal treatment). When the HX was released, government emissions controls had been tightened and Holden needed to make significant changes to their engines. This resulted in a loss of performance across the range and the deletion of the 2.84-litre straight-six. In addition, a Kingswood panel van was introduced to the range of commercial vehicle offerings. The HX Sandman introduced a large 'Sandman' logo on the tailgate and stripes down the sides. During the course of the HX series, front bucket seats were adopted as standard equipment for Kingswood-badged vehicles. As with the previous series, a couple of special-build HX Kingswood variants emerged later in production, initially with the Kingswood 50th Anniversary sedan in November 1976 and also a repeat appearance of the Kingswood Deluxe sedan.  HZ  HZ Premier The 1977 HZ series received minor updates to the exterior, and saw the introduction of what Holden termed \\"Radial Tuned Suspension\\" (RTS) on all models. RTS made significant changes to the suspension of the car, greatly improving the handling finesse, while at the same time not compromising ride quality.Wright (1998), pp. 240‚Äì241 Modern Motor magazine described the HZ as \\"a great handler spoiled by the car\\" in a comparison against the BMW 528i, contrasted as \\"a great car spoiled by the handling\\". In this series, the lower-end Belmont was deleted and the Kingswood became the base model for sedans and wagons, with a new model the slightly more upmarket Kingswood SL introduced. Commercial vehicles‚Äîthe ute, panel van and cab chassis‚Äîwere not affected by the rationalisation, with the practice of \\"unbadged\\" commercial vehicles continuing. During the course of the HZ series, equipment levels were upgraded in 1978 effectively to match improvements in the opposition Ford Falcon range, but the life of the Kingswood looked set to end following Holden's release of the VB Commodore range of sedans and wagons in November 1978. After 1980, Kingswood passenger cars were cancelled‚Äîreplaced by the downsized Commodore. The final HZ Sandman, featured a choice of V8 engines only, along with a four-headlight grille and under bumper front spoiler. According to a GMH Price List dated 25 January 1979, a basic HZ Holden panel van was priced at A$6,076, with the Sandman option package an additional A$1,700. The further optional components also included 5.0-litre V8 engine and a limited slip differential. If a buyer selected every Sandman extra, the price would be more than 150 percent of the cost of the basic HZ model. By the end of 1979, the Sandman had largely lost its place in the contemporary Australian youth culture‚Äîorder figures were down and many of the vehicles were now being sold with the stripes and tailgate logos deleted. The Sandman ute was phased out of production prior to the van, the last of which was manufactured around October 1979.  WB  Holden Kingswood (WB) sedan prototype based on the Statesman HZ. This project did not progress to production status. The last Holden to wear the Kingswood badge was one of the variants of the WB series utility released in 1980. Although the WA and WB projects at Holden were meant to have resulted in all-new full-size cars, the 1973 fuel crisis and cost-cutting meant the scope of changes became more limited each time. Eventually, the WB project was condensed into a major upgrade of the luxury Statesman models and a facelift of the HZ-series commercial models with new headlights, tail lights, grilles and the updated Holden \\"Blue\\" six-cylinder engine (4.2-litre V8 optional). The Kingswood was now available on utility only with the panel van joining the One Tonner, but the 5.0-litre V8 engine was no longer officially offered as an available performance option although some were built. There were no passenger car versions of the Kingswood, their place in the Holden range having been absorbed by the Commodore. Production of the entire WB-series finished in 1984 when Holden announced they were vacating local production of large luxury and commercial vehicles‚Äîdue to economics‚Äîto concentrate on their medium car range, i.e. Camira and Commodore, and imported Isuzu commercial product.  Third generation (proposed)   WA  After the development of the HQ series and the delays to the facelifted HJ which saw the revised HQ released in 1973, Holden intended to replace the second generations cars with a heavily revised WA series. Several design sketches in various forms have surfaced since the early-1990s, including a liftback body style. The 1973 fuel crisis along with a worsening financial situation, partly caused by the decision to build the HQ in right-hand drive only, thus limiting the previously highly profitable left- hand drive exports, meant that the project was eventually abandoned. GM instead utilised the then forthcoming 1977 Opel Rekord, which was significantly re-engineered and released as the Commodore in 1978 with Holden's own powertrains.  Exports  1971‚Äì1974 Chevrolet 350 (HQ) sold in New Zealand. The 350 is based on the Statesman, itself an extended length version of the HQ Premier. Early Holdens were manufactured in New Zealand at the General Motors New Zealand plant in Petone until 1967, and Kingswoods plus other Holden luxury levels were later assembled from complete knock down (CKD) kits at the new car plant at Trentham Upper Hutt further up the Hutt Valley from Wellington. Other Holden models like Monaro were imported completely built up (CBU) from Australia. From the 1960s Australian-made models were exported to Southeast Asia, and also to the Caribbean‚Äîthe Kingswood was assembled in Trinidad and Tobago.Report of Working Group on the Motor Vehicle Assembly Industry of Trinidad and Tobago, Ministry of Industry and Commerce, 1977, page 19 Some of these HQ-series models‚Äîassembled in Australia‚Äîwere sold in New Zealand as the \\"Chevrolet 350\\" from 1971 to 1974. They differed little from the locally assembled V8 Statesman apart from the larger US made engine, a new grille with the Chevrolet logo, badges and hub caps, and effectively replaced the Canadian-sourced Chevrolet Impalas last sold in 1969.  South Africa  Until the late 1960s, the Special, Kingswood (from HK), Premier, and Monaro were sold in South Africa as Holdens, before the demise of Canadian-sourced Chevrolet Impala and Chevelle, which led to the introduction of the Chevrolet Kommando and Chevrolet Constantia, which were based on the HT, HG, and later HQ Kingswood and Premier respectively, using either Holden's straight-six, V8, or later the Chevrolet sixes. There was a short period when HT and HG variants were sold with both Holden and Chevrolet badging, the Holden versions shared nose styling with Australian cars. Some surviving examples of both brands, especially Monaro coupes (HT badged Holden Monaro; HG Chevrolet SS) have been 'reimported' to Australia by classic car enthusiasts. Some were exported to a few Southeast Asian markets (Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore) and marketed in their respective markets. The Constantia name was in reference to the grand Groot Constantia wine estate, with its world-famous gabled Cape-Dutch homestead featuring as the model's emblem, while Kommando referred to the Boer Commando squads during the Anglo-Boer War. The South African version of the HQ was coded AQ, and was very similar to the Chevrolet 350 sold by Chevrolet/Vauxhall dealers in New Zealand. In 1971, following the dropping of the Holden brand in South Africa, the Holden utility became known as the Chevrolet El Camino. Between 1974 and 1978, the one-tonne utility sold as the Chevrolet El Torro. Also in 1971, the Holden Monaro was made available locally as the Chevrolet SS. In late 1975, for the 1976 model year, updated models were introduced, again as a Kommando with the straight-six, Constantia with the 250 and V8, and the Caprice Classic, also with the 308. The inline- six was modified for better economy, but sales never climbed to their previous levels after the 1973 oil crisis. There was also a better equipped Kommando LS, with standard automatic transmission. The Constantia station wagon was a new model for 1976. In 1979 the Holden-sourced models were replaced by Chevrolet-badged versions of the Opel Rekord, Commodore (similar to Holden's own VB Commodore) and Senator. It would not be until 2001 that a Holden- sourced Chevrolet, the Lumina, was sold in South Africa.

Often the most basic of set-ups will involve just a ball with a wall or fence used as a goal, or items such as clothing being used for goalposts (hence the phrase \\"jumpers for goalposts\\"). The phrase was used by Ed Sheeran in his 2015 documentary Jumpers for Goalposts: Live at Wembley Stadium as a nod to playing the concerts at Wembley Stadium, the home of English football. The ease of playing these informal games on the streets and open spaces make football the most popular sport in the world. Currently several common street football organisations exist (Streetfootballworld, SISM Street Soccer in the USA, The International Street Soccer Association, WhizzKids United, Buntkicktgut, Street Soccer USA). Nowadays, street football is also one method for coaching young football playersModern Sports Stories Publication, published 09/09/2013. Staff interview with Darren Laver, Page 96. and is realized with freestyle football, which has grown in popularity since the early 2000s when Nike began to focus on street football and freestyle via their TV ads. The first Street Football World Championship took place in the Mariannenplatz in Berlin-Kreuzberg. Street Football World Festival 2006 not in reference The World Street 3s, the first international World Street Soccer Championships took place in Manchester on 25 September 2016. The United States held their first international tournament in 2014. The American Panna & Freestyle Tournament hosted by SISM Street Soccer, took place in San Jose, California. The inaugural event consisted of freestyle football, street soccer and panna. The event drew many top professionals from around the world to judge and compete in the Bay Area.  Video games  In 2005, video game publisher Electronic Arts introduced FIFA Street, a franchise based on street football and freestyle football. FIFA Street series focuses on flair, style and trickery, reflecting the cultures of street football and freestyle football played in streets and backlots across the world. In 2020 Electronic Arts added a Volta gameplay mode to FIFA 20 which has a storyline of a street football player playing through the ranks, and both making new friends and losing old ones along the way.

Habonim was founded in 1929 in the United Kingdom and over a period of years, spread to all English- speaking countries. Each country developed its own independent version of the original movement whilst sharing the core ideology of being a Jewish Socialist-Zionist cultural youth movement. Dror was founded in Poland in 1915 out of a wing of the Tze'irei Tziyon (Zion Youth) study circle. The majority of Tze'irei Tziyon had merged with a group called Hashomer in 1913 to form Hashomer Hatzair, and those who remained outside of the new group formed Dror. The group was influenced by the teachings of the Russian Narodniks. Members of Dror participated in the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. Mordechaj Tenenbaum and other Dror members organised two underground factions in the Bialystok Ghetto. Dror was aligned with the HaKibbutz Hameuhad network, while Habonim was aligned with the Ichud kibbutzim. When the two kibbutz movements merged in 1980 to form the United Kibbutz Movement (TaKa\\"M), so did their respective youth movements. Ideology Habonim Dror is a Jewish Socialist-Zionist cultural youth movement, which exists to educate and bring Jewish culture to its members, both within Israeli society and in the Jewish Diaspora. One of the main concepts of the movement's ideology is that of tikkun olam, a Hebrew phrase that means \\"mending the world\\" which originated in the early rabbinic period of Judaism. The Movement ideology falls into different categories. They are Hagshama Atzmit (Self-realisation), Socialism/Social Justice, Zionism, Judaism and Chalutziut (Pioneering). These categories are not independent ideologies, each platform helps to integrate one of them with the others. Every chaver(a) (member) embodies the spirit of Habonim Dror, based on their shared experiences and values gained in the movement. Habonim Dror's ideology is an attempt to represent that spirit in words. The expression of these ideals involves various kinds of meetings and outdoor activities including scouting, camping, rambling, map reading as well as the education of the geography and history of Eretz Yisrael (the land of Israel). Jewish history is given attention, as are songs and dances taken from the pioneer days of the present State. The socialist ideal extends to both the kibbutz and the modern \\"irbutz,\\" or urban communal living spaces movements, some of which were founded by Habonim Dror members.  The three pillars  At least in The Netherlands, Haboniem-Dror is based on three so-called \\"pillars\\": socialism, zionism and Judaism. Socialism and Zionism are named first because they are much more prominent in Haboniem. Judaism is more on the background since the main purpose of Haboniem is to facilitate the building of the new state of Israel rather than practicing Judaism. Socialism Habonim has always been a socialist movement at its core. The main principles of equality and sharing are very prominent in the movement. Everyone is treated as equal to each other (of course there is a divide between chanichim and madrichim) and everyone uses the same facilities such as bathrooms, shared bedrooms, and a main dining room. This Socialism resulted in a very active community in the scope of socialism but this since has changed for a more modest community. This is probably a result of Socialism being viewed as bad instead of a good thing. Now only a small portion of members remain active in the scene. The unity and equality can also be seen at the tradition of the mifkad (◊û◊§◊ß◊ì) or the roll call held every morning (excluding the sabbath). At the mifkad the program of the day is presented and two songs are sung. The two songs are: # Od Lo Gamarnu (◊¢◊ï◊ì ◊ú◊ê ◊í◊û◊®◊†◊ï) # hatikva (◊î◊™◊ß◊ï◊ï◊î) During the singing of these songs the flags of Haboniem and the Israeli flag are hoisted. Zionism Habonim is a Zionist youth movement. Zionism ( supporting the creation of a state for Jews) is one of the principles of Habonim. Many of the educational programs offered by Habonim during their activities are about Zionism and Socialism. In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s many members went on Aliyah and so the main purpose of Habonim was mostly fulfilled. Today, the Zionism has transformed in a more educational purpose, the education during the day consists of discussions on modern-day Zionism and how it has transformed. Due to the recent controversy surrounding Israel Habonim has reevaluated its stance on the topic. It remains in favor of a state for Jews and is positive towards Israel. It did distance itself from the settlements in The West Bank and has expressed concerns about the current government in Israel. Judaism Judaism is a less important aspect inside Habonim, because it wants to be inclusive for all youth who believe in the movement's goals and beliefs. Judaism is not actively practiced but on every Friday at sunset, the Sabbath is greeted with song. At the end of the Sabbath, the Havdalah is said. Any religious symbols are not common and the only time they are really present is during the Sabbath and the Israeli flag that is visible at the activities. The wearing of the Kippah or any form of covering for the body is not required. Origins in the United Kingdom Quoting the official history of Habonim Great Britain, \\"a certain mystique surrounded the question of who founded the Habonim Movement but there is little doubt that the major personality behind the idea was Wellesley Aron\\".Habonim, Great Britain. 1929‚Äì1955, Yad Tabenkin, 1999 Aron acknowledges that he could not have succeeded without Chaim Lipshitz, who organized the first model Gedud (group), and Norman Lourie, whose enthusiasm helped generate other volunteer leaders. Lourie went on to found Habonim South Africa. Encouraged by them, Aron wrote the outline for the first Handbook and by April 1929 their organization was given the name Habonim. This was followed the next month, May 1929, by the first group, \\"Gedud Trumpeldor\\" led by Lipschitz. This date is acknowledged as the official founding date of Habonim. According to Aron, he modeled Habonim after Baden-Powell's Boy Scouts.Silman-Cheong, Helen, Wellesley Aron, Rebel with a Cause, Valentine Mitchell, 1992, p.50 The idea soon spread to other English-speaking countries and ex-colonies where Jews resided. In 1930, Norman Lourie founded Habonim Southern Africa, with the first camp taking place at Parys in 1931. Initially the idea was a \\"Jewish Youth Cultural Movement\\" for children aged between 12 and 18. Unlike other organizations in other countries, the movement was initially intended to be of a non-Zionist (non- political) kind. Early history Lipschitz was the natural person to lead the first group since he had already organized meetings of boys at his father's Cheder (school room) and they were well established by December 1928. (Incidentally this Cheder was one of the few more-progressive of these establishments, many were unattractive places that taught only traditional Hebrew and Torah (Biblical law).) The new group was where Chaim taught Modern Hebrew along with songs and dances of the Jewish settlers in Palestine, Jewish history and various games. Chaim was assisted by Norman Lourie, a visitor from South Africa who had previously visited Palestine. The aim of these group meetings was to attract and better educate the Jewish children of immigrants from Poland and Russia (mostly pre 1905, when immigration to the U.K. was severely limited), about their Jewish history and about the progress of the Jews presently living in Palestine. These children had somewhat dismal lives in the slums of the East-End, (Stepney and Whitechapel) which were not lightened by the mostly poor Cheder education system then available.: taken from various sources in the archives of Habonim at Yad Tabenkin, Ramat Efer, near Ramat Gan/Tel Aviv, Israel. Official founding The first meeting of leaders of the Jewish youth community as reported by Wellesley Aron, was in a letter to Dr. S. Brodetsky (of the Zionist Foundation) on 11 January 1929. Wellesley mentioned that only 5 people attended, but that Norman Lourie (the third founder) called a larger meeting for the following week (10 January) where representatives from at least 7 Jewish youth organizations were present. This meeting was in London at 77 Great Russel Street EC1. England at this time was the center of political Zionism, after the Balfour Declaration in 1917 had stated that \\"His Majesty's Government favourably viewed the establishment of a Jewish National Home in Palestine\\" (then under British mandate). The new youth movement Habonim (The Builders) was deliberately non-Zionist in ideology. The first Gedud Trumpeldor was built on Lipschitz's existing youth group in Stepney with Lipshitz as Rosh (leader) assisted by Norman Lourie. In May 1929 the first 27-page hand-booklet detailing how Habonim was to function was published by Aron with help in the mimeographing from Norman Lourie and his lady friend Nadia, who he later married. They both returned to Norman's home country South Africa in 1930, to establish Habonim branches in various towns and countries in that continent and in India. Habonim UK & Ireland 1929‚Äì1955 The Movement grew very rapidly. In London alone there were 21 groups by 1932. The Movement had at least 2,500 members by the time of their ten-year \\"Jamboree Camp\\" in 1939. The various gedudim or groups were initially single sex (like the Scouting Movement) but were soon were changed for boys and girls together. Associated but not part of the Movement were training farms, called Hachshara farms, for the older members to learn about agriculture and life on kibbutz, to which their aliyah (or \\"going-up\\" to Eretz Yisrael) would eventually lead. During the Second World War the senior members of Habonim helped to organize and take care of the many refugee children who escaped from the Nazis through special Kindertransports. Their parents had agreed to this tragic life-time separation, which was arranged through some of the more future-minded Jewish organizations remaining in Europe. Other members whose aliyah was delayed due to the war, helped the war-time food shortage to be met by working as groups of laborers on various farming communities. Graduates of British Habonim contributed significant manpower to the establishment of many kibbutzim in Israel, among others, Kfar Blum, Kfar Hanasi, Gesher Haziv, Beit HaEmek, Mevo Hama, Tuval and Amiad of these the most British is Kfar Hanassi.

Countries in which Habonim Dror operates A Habonim Dror stencil on a wall in Rosario, Argentina Habonim Dror operates in Aotearoa New Zealand, Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Hungary, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States and Uruguay. Aotearoa New Zealand Habonim Dror Aotearoa New Zealand (HDANZ) has 3 main centres; Auckland being the largest, then Wellington and Christchurch. Each Ken runs weekly meetings. The movement come together for various seminars during the year as well as winter and summer camps. The summer camps run for ten days and are always in tents and on a farm. Habonim Dror Aotearoa New Zealand is possibly the last Jewish youth movement in the world to run their summer camps entirely under canvas, including digging own toilets. Winter camps are shorter and are held in cabins due to Aotearoa New Zealand's climate. Habo ANZ celebrated its 70th anniversary in 2018. Habonim Dror Aotearoa New Zealand is a member of the Australasian Zionist Youth Council (AZYC). Argentina The first steps of the TNUA in Argentina from the year 1934, when installation occurs in Buenos Aires Hejalutz Dror, by European influence. Several years later, in 1945 in Argentina hajsar√° (◊î◊õ◊©◊®◊î) arises from the hand of the other branch that later integrate what is currently moviemiento we are talking about Ichud Habonim. By 1980 there is the merger and Ichud Habonim Dror, forming what is now known as Habonim Dror. This unification occurs after the formation of the Kingdom of the Kibbutz Movement, Takam. Before this event, Dror was aligned with the network \\"Meiujad\\" (Meuhad) while Kibbutz Habonim was integrated with the kibbutzim of \\"Ichud.\\" Today our TNUA has keinim in 8 provinces, with over 300 active chaverim. Through the Shnat Hajshara (◊©◊†◊™ ◊î◊õ◊©◊®◊î year of preparation), encouraging continuing to live their bogrim significant experience in the State of Israel, seeking to strengthen identification with Jewish culture.  Australia (HDOZ)  Habonim Dror, a.k.a. Habo, has four kenim (branches) around Australia. They are in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Ken Ha'Shemesh Ha'Olah, which runs online and branches out to smaller communities around the country. Habonim Dror Australia runs weekly meetings for students from years three to twelve as well as biannual camps. Each state runs independent winter camps and a summer camp for junior students (years three to eight), while annually in January all state movements come together for a federal camp (FEDCAMP) for years nine to twelve, which runs for ten days. Habonim Dror Australia is a member of the Australasian Zionist Youth Council (AZYC). Every year chanichim (members) who have just finished high school travel to Israel for a year on Shnat Hachshara Ve'Hadracha le'Aliyah (Hebrew: ◊©◊†◊™ ◊î◊õ◊©◊®◊î ◊ï◊î◊ì◊®◊õ◊î ◊ú◊¢◊ú◊ô◊ô◊î, lit. \\"year of preparation and guidance for Aliya\\"), commonly shortened to Shnat (\\"year of\\"), where they go on an extensive experiential and educational process and actively carry out movement aims and engage with Israeli society.  History  Habonim was first brought to Australia in 1940, when seven new Australians decided to create a Zionist youth movement along similar lines to those that already existed in Europe. In March of that year the first meeting was held in Melbourne's Herzl Hall, and later in December, Habonim's first summer camp. After a brief union with Betar in 1942, Habonim grew into an Australia-wide movement in May 1944. The following year, Habonim Australia's first hachshara (preparation, in Hebrew: ◊î◊õ◊©◊®◊î) farm was established in Springvale, about 25 km out of Melbourne's centre. The next year five Habonim graduates made aliyah settling on Kibbutz Kfar Blum. In 1957, the first organised group of Habonim graduates made aliyah in a garin to Kibbutz Yizre'el. Six garinim would ultimately be formed with the intention of making aliyah. It is unclear how many succeeded. In recent years, there has been a new drive of garin aliyah from HDOZ, with Garinim settling in Haifa, Tiberias and Tel Aviv. Garinim such as Ayalah (Shnat 2012), Mafteach (Shnat 2013) and Emesh (2014) have all renewed chalutzik aliyah from HDOZ.  Movement structure  At an Australia-wide level (federal), there is an executive secretariat (mazkirut, in Hebrew: ◊û◊ñ◊õ◊ô◊®◊ï◊™) which includes a Secretary-General (mazkir, in Hebrew: ◊û◊ñ◊õ◊ô◊®), Treasurer (gizbar, in Hebrew: ◊í◊ô◊ñ◊ë◊®), a Head of Education (rosh chinuch, in Hebrew: ◊®◊ê◊© ◊ó◊ô◊†◊ï◊ö) and a Shnat co-ordinator (\\"rakaz shnat\\", in Hebrew: ◊®◊õ◊ñ ◊©◊†◊™). Each individual branch has a mazkir, gizbar and rosh chinuch executive position, along with an external community liaison (\\"meta'em\\", in Hebrew: ◊û◊™◊ê◊ù) and an additional position for a representative from the year level returning from shnat. Each shichvah (year level) has a tzevet (team) of madrichim (leaders) responsible for their educational process and general wellbeing. These madrichim will prepare and run peulot (activities) on a weekly basis for their chanichim, as well as biannual camps and other extra events such as shabbatonim (sleepover on shabbat). Tzvatim are made up of bogrim (madrichim who have returned from shnat) and madatzim (year 11 chanichim). Senior tzvatim are made up solely of bogrim, while junior tzvatim are primarily madatzim leading alongside bogrim who help guide them through their first year of leading. There is also a tzevet that is responsible for running peulot for bogrim themselves, ensuring that there is a continued educational process among the educators. Additionally, there are other tafkidim (roles) that allow for madrichim to take responsibility for various aspects of the movement such as Judaism, Zionism, gardening, equipment and politics and social action. Belgium The Belgian ken is one of the biggest in Europe. Every Saturday afternoon, 130 chaverim and madrichim get together in Brussels. Brazil The movement arrived in Brazil by influences of the Argentine activists, and began in Porto Alegre, in 1945 and then moved to S√£o Paulo also in 1945. Within a few years, Habonim reached Curitiba and Rio de Janeiro. Some time later, it arrived in Recife, Salvador and Belo Horizonte. And, more recently, it reached Manaus and Fortaleza. At these nine branches across the country, Habonim runs weekly activities for children, teenagers and young adults from 7 to 22 years old, as well as weekly-long Machanot (camps) in Summer and Winter. Also twice a year is held the National Machaneh. Once in a two-year cycle, a Veidah Artzit (National Convention) is held, comprising a meeting of all the senior members of the National Movement. The Veidah has powers to modify HD Brazil's ideological platform, as long as it doesn't oppose to the World Movement's principles. Mexico The Mexico City ken is one of the most international connected keniano in the world working with North American and Latin America at the same time. Every Saturday afternoon, 10p chaverim and madrichim get together in Mexico City. The Netherlands In the 1920s the Joodse jeugdfederatie (Jewish Youth Federation) was founded by Zionist Jewish youngsters. The federation was open to all Jews in the Netherlands and it brought together a large number of young Jews seeking unity and comfort. The Federation supported the creation of a national Jewish home in former Palestine. During the World War II, many members were murdered in The Holocaust. After the war, those who survived and former members came into contact with the in 1928 formed Habonim in the United Kingdom. For 22 years the two movements worked together and this eventually led to the creation of Haboniem beHolland in 1950 (It would not receive official international recognition until 1951). During the following decades Haboniem gathered many followers, many of them Jewish teenagers seeking a way out of their lives with their parent. The purpose of Haboniem beHolland was to help in the building of Israel by supporting the aliyah, the movement of Jews to the Promised Land. The purpose has since changed to educating members about Israel, the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict and the history of the Jewish People. In 1958 Haboniem merged with the Kibbutz movement Meyuchad. This led to the merging with the in 1915 formed \\"dror\\". In the present day, Haboniem-Dror counts around 300 members of which around 150 are active and pay a contribution. The supporting of aliyah is mostly put aside for educating the Jewish youth on Israel, although it still remains something that some members undertake. Activities Haboniem-Dror organizes a number of activities for its members, the most prominent are The five camps and weekends or machanot ; \\"afdelingen\\", The general members assembly, \\"Habo Goes\\" and the \\"Israelreis\\". Twice a year, a general members assembly is held. Any member of Haboniem can attend. During the assembly, the progress of the movement is discussed and the financial plans are revealed. During the assembly, any member above 12 years old and who pays contribution can vote and put a motion on the floor. At the summer assembly, a new board is chosen. During some assemblies, the articles of association are changed. The last account of this was the change in 2014. Habo goes are activities that take place outside the clubhouse (not including the machanot). These activities are often in the open air such as a barbecue or a sports day. The rosh (head of the camp) needs a wash tradition at the end of each of the machanot Structure Haboniem has a group-based structure of members. The members who are under 17 years old ( JK7 or lower) are called chanichiem and the group above 17 years old is called madrichiem. Madrichiem are the leaders of the camp and are responsible for the organization, leading of the JKs, cooking, general entertainment, and the logistics. The main structure of groups is as follows: there are 6 official groups of chanichiem called JKs and from JK6 onwards the naming of groups stops since the members are all madrichiem by then ( unofficially there is a continuation of count). North America Habonim in North America (HDNA) was founded in April 1935 by Young Poale Zion, the youth arm of the Poale Zion Party, at a convention in Buffalo, NY. At its height, the movement had over 2,000 campers attending eleven summer camps throughout the US and Canada. Today, Habonim Dror North America (HDNA) runs many programs during the year, including a biannual veida (a mass meeting with representatives from around the movement), local events in central cities, kibbutzim in Israel, a year-long program in Israel (called Workshop), and many other ideology-focused gatherings. The Movement membership currently exceeds 1,700 youth and has been growing steadily over the past decade.Habonim Dror Camp Association registration data 2013 HDNA also runs six summer camps (called Machanot) across the continent. These have become a large part of the movement and in most cases are more important to members than local meetings (called ken meetings) since they play a key role in involving and recruiting new members to the movement. The six camps are as follows: * Camp Galil (Ottsville, Pennsylvania, USA) * Camp Gesher (Cloyne, Ontario, Canada) * Camp Gilboa (San Bernardino County, California, USA) * Camp Miriam (Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada) * Camp Moshava (Maryland) (Street, Maryland, USA) * Camp Tavor (Three Rivers, Michigan, USA) Some now defunct camps and Habonim hachshara farms are: * Camp Amal (Vermont 1948‚Äì49, Na'aleh 1950, Cream Ridge 1951, Moshava 1952, Galil 1953) * Camp Bonim (Dallas, Texas) * Camp Ein Harod (Ellenville, NY; Originally: Liberty, NY) * Camp Kinneret (Chelsea, Michigan); later merged with Camp Yad Ari to form Camp Tavor * Camp Kvutzah Gimli (Gimli, Manitoba) * Camp Kvutzah Montreal (St. Faustin, Quebec) * Camp Tel Ari (Hunter, New York) * Camp Tel Hai (New Buffalo, Michigan) * Camp Tel Natan (Troy, Missouri) * Camp Yad Ari (Waupaca, Wisconsin) later merged with Camp Kinneret to form Camp Tavor * Cream Ridge Farm (Upper Freehold, New Jersey) * Smithville Farm (Smithville, Ontario) * Camp Na'aleh (Red Hook, New York; Elizaville, New York; Sidney, New York; Windsor, New York; and other locations) Additionally, a five-week trip, named Machaneh Bonim in Israel (MBI) is a summer tour of Israel for 16-year-olds (summer after 10th grade). Students from the seven camps spend time together and learn about Israel and the movement. HDNA publishes B'tnua, the regular movement magazine. Habonim Dror collaborated with Ameinu, Hashomer Hatzair, and Meretz USA to form the Union of Progressive Zionists campus network, which has now become J Street U, to which Habonim Dror North America only has an affiliation. Southern Africa Habonim Dror Southern Africa (HDSA) was founded in 1930 by Norman Lourie. HDSA draws its membership from the Southern African region. However the vast majority of its membership comes from South Africa. HDSA's two primary centres are based in Cape Town and Johannesburg, although the movement is active across the country. HDSA defines itself as a Jewish Zionist Youth movement (See HDSA Constitution 2009http://www.habo.org.za/files/HDSA_Chukka_2009.pdf HDSA classifies itself as a left-wing movement. Unlike other Habonim Dror movements, HDSA does not classify itself as socialist but rather supports economic and social equality. As a left-wing Zionist movement, HDSA promotes a two-state solution in Israel. It also encourages its members to live in Israel in a manner which positively contributes to Israeli society. HDSA also places immense value on active citizenship and thus strives to educate its members on South Africa and encourages them to be active in creating a just and equal post apartheid South Africa. HDSA annually hosts one of the largest summer camps in the Southern Hemisphere at their campsite in Onrus outside Cape Town. During the year, consistent activities are run for its members who range from the ages of 9‚Äì23. The ideological tenets of the movement such as Zionism, Socialism and Service to Humanity inform many of these activities. Additionally, HDSA runs an annual tour to Israel for 16-year-olds and sends many of its members on a ten-month post school program to Israel.  United Kingdom  Habonim Dror United Kingdom (HDUK) has six kenim (branches) around the United Kingdom. They are in London, Leeds, Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool and Nottingham. Habonim Dror United Kingdom runs meetings throughout the year as well as a Machaneh and Israel Tour in the Summer. Habonim Dror has five Machanot, one on a residential site in Wales, where chanichim (participants) will spend time hiking, in education activities, celebrating shabbat and many other activities. Additionally, there is Sayarim Machane which is run in Holland. This Machane is focused on Holocaust education, and is well known for the quality of education and the experience on this Machane. When chanichim are 16 they go on the Israel Tour, a month trip around Israel, where they are immersed in the culture and history of Israel. In this time, chanichim will travel around Israel, learning about and visiting a variety of sites, they will also be volunteering and spending an entire day with other Habonim Dror tour participants from all over the world. After returning from Israel Tour, participants become Madrichim (leaders) and will spend the year doing Hadracha (leadership) training in preparation for them to take on roles in the summer across a variety of Machanot. Every year chanichim who have just finished high school travel to Israel for a year on Shnat Hachshara, commonly referred to as Shnat, where they go on an extensive experiential and educational process and actively carry out movement aims and engage with Israeli society.

His work straddles folk and pop. He was interested in a wide variety of music from an early age. He initially collaborated with several major bands, prior to launching a successful solo career. Initially popular for playing Irish traditional music in a duo with Andy Irvine and later with Tommy Peoples and Matt Molloy, he later turned to a more rock-inspired electric style with poignant political lyrics. Some of his most popular songs are: \\"Crazy Dreams\\", \\"Nothing but the Same Old Story\\", \\"The Island\\", \\"Night Hunting Time\\", \\"Steel Claw\\" and \\"Paradise Is Here\\".June Skinner Sawyers. 2001. Celtic music: a complete guide. Da Capo Press. p. 266-67. Early life Paul Joseph Brady was born in Belfast and raised in the small town of Strabane in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, on the border with County Donegal, Republic of Ireland. His father Se√°n Brady was a music teacher who taught flute. Brady was educated at Sion Mills Primary School, St. Columb's College, Derry and University College Dublin. He is prominently featured in the documentary film The Boys of St. Columb's. He began learning piano around age six and by the age of eleven he had begun to play guitar, spending hours of his school holidays learning every song that the Shadows and the Ventures had recorded. He was also strongly influenced by Chuck Berry. In 1963, Brady began performing as a piano player in a hotel in Bundoran, Donegal. In October 1964, he attended University College Dublin and performed with a string of RnB groups, covering songs by the likes of Ray Charles and James Brown. The first of these was the Inmates (late 1964‚Äìabout April 1965), which evolved into the Kult (about April‚ÄìDecember 1965), featuring Brady, Jackie McAuley (ex-Them, and future Belfast Gypsies and Trader Horne), Brendan Bonass, and Dave Pennefather. Brady can be seen in the documentary film Charlie Is My Darling waiting outside Dublin's Adelphi Theatre for the Rolling Stones' concert of 3 September 1965. He next joined Rootzgroup (late 1965‚ÄìMay 1966) and Rockhouse (about May‚ÄìDecember 1966). Musical career 1960s and 1970s During his time at college in Dublin, the country saw a huge rise in interest in traditional Irish music. Brady joined the popular Irish band The Johnstons when Michael Johnston left in May 1967. They moved to London, England, in 1969 and subsequently to New York City in 1972 to expand their audience. Despite some success, Brady returned to Ireland in 1974 to join the Irish group Planxty, the band that would subsequently launch the solo careers of Andy Irvine, Liam O'Flynn, D√≥nal Lunny, and Christy Moore. When Planxty disbanded in late 1975, Brady formed a duo with Irvine from 1976 to 1978, a partnership that produced the successful album, Andy Irvine/Paul Brady. The next few years saw him establish his popularity and reputation as one of Ireland's best interpreters of traditional songs. His versions of ballads like \\"Arthur McBride\\" and \\"The Lakes of Pontchartrain\\" were considered definitive and are still popular at concerts today. In 1975 in New York he recorded three albums for Shanachie Records as guitar accompanist to resident Irish fiddlers Andy McGann, Paddy Reynolds and John Vesey. He also recorded a 1976 album, The High Part of the Road, for the same label with Irish fiddler Tommy Peoples.Kenny Mathieson. 2001. Celtic music. Hal Leonard Corporation. p. 14 Solo career In 1978, Brady released his first solo album, Welcome Here Kind Stranger, which won him critical acclaim and was awarded the Melody Maker Folk Album of the Year. However, it would prove to be Brady's last album covering traditional material. He decided to delve into pop and rock music, and released his first album of this genre in 1981, Hard Station. Brady released a number of successful solo albums throughout the 1980s: True for You (1983), Back to the Centre (1985), and Primitive Dance (1987). By the end of the decade, Brady was recognised and accepted as a respected performer and songwriter. His songs were being covered by a number of other artists, including Santana and Dave Edmunds. Contrary to what is often written, Brady does not write for other artists but for his own self-expression; other artists pick up on his songs because of their inherent quality. When Tina Turner heard a demo of his song \\"Paradise Is Here\\", she recorded it for her Break Every Rule album of 1986. By now, he was a favourite songwriter among such artists as Bob Dylan and Bonnie Raitt, who would do a duet with Brady on his 1991 album, Trick or Treat. A couple of Brady songs soon appeared on Raitt's album Luck of the Draw, including the title track. Dylan was sufficiently impressed by Brady's work to name-check him in the booklet of his 1985 box set, Biograph. The actual quote was \\"(...) people get too famous too fast these days and it destroys them. Some guys got it down-Leonard Cohen, Paul Brady, Lou Reed, secret heroes, John Prine, David Allen Coe, Tom Waits. I listen more to that kind of stuff than whatever is popular at the moment. They're not just witchdoctoring up the planet, they don't set up barriers (...)\\". Since his Hard Station album (1981), Brady was on various major labels until he created his own label, PeeBee Music, in the late 1990s. He released three albums in the 1990s: Trick or Treat, Songs & Crazy Dreams (a remixed compilation of earlier songs) and Spirits Colliding, which were met with critical acclaim. Trick or Treat was on Fontana/Mercury Records and received a lot of promotion. As a result, some critics considered it his debut album and noted that the record benefited from the expertise of experienced studio musicians, as well as producer Gary Katz, who worked with the rock group Steely Dan. Rolling Stone, after praising Brady's earlier but less-known solo records, called Trick or Treat Brady's \\"most compelling collection.\\" Brady has gone on to record several other albums (15 in total since he went solo in 1978) and collaborated with a number of other established musicians including Bonnie Raitt and Richard Thompson (a complete list of his many collaborations is given at his website). In 2006, he collaborated with Cara Dillon on the track \\"The Streets of Derry\\" from her album After the Morning. He has also worked with Fiachra Trench. He performed Gaelic songs as a character in the 2002 Matthew Barney film Cremaster 3. He also played tin whistle on the single \\"One\\" by Greg Pearle in 2008, from the album Beautiful You, a collaboration between Greg Pearle and John Illsley; this song featured in the 2008 film Anton, directed by Graham Cantwell. Brady's fifteenth studio album, Hooba Dooba, was released in March 2010 and was widely acclaimed as one of his finest. As of 2017, a friendship was struck with Theo Katzman (vulfpeck) and Brady has since been touring as half of this unlikely duo. They have been touring with Joe Dart, also of vulfpeck, upcoming Northern Irish guitarist Jack McGoldrick, Louis Cato and Lee Pardini. Brady continues to tour, record and collaborate in a variety of creative projects around the globe. In 2019 Jimmy Buffett began performing a cover of Brady's hit, The World is What you Make It. In September 2019 Brady joined Jimmy Buffett on his tour stops in both Dublin and London.

The elected council determines the educational policy in a small regional area, such as a city, county, state, or province. Frequently, a board of directors power with a larger institution, such as a higher government's department of education. The name of such board is also often used to refer to the school system under such board's control. The government department that administered education in the United Kingdom before the foundation of the Ministry of Education was formerly called the Board of Education.  History  The American board of education traces its origins back to 1647, with the formation of the first American public school system. The Massachusetts Bay Colony mandated that every town establish a public school within its jurisdiction. Committees sprang up to run the institutions, and in the 1820s the state of Massachusetts required such committees to be independent of local governments, establishing the current model for the autonomous school districts that exist throughout the United States. The United States Constitution reserved educational authority in the hands of the states pursuant to the Tenth Amendment, and most states have passed such authority to local school boards. For over a century, local boards were solely responsible for public education funding, standards, instruction, and results, which to a certain extent remains true today. At their height in the 1930s there were as many as 127,500 boards. Some sparsely populated states had more school board members than teachers and for much of their history, such boards presided over school systems serving agrarian and industrial economies.

The order suffered a great defeat: 71 knights, including the grand master, Ernst von Rassburg, and Eilart Hoberg, leader of the knights from Danish Estonia, were killed. It was the second-largest defeat of the order in the 13th century. After this battle Duke Nameisis of the Semigallians recognized Traidenis as his suzerain. Background In 1273 the order built Dinaburga Castle on lands nominally controlled by Traidenis. The castle was of great strategic importance: it was used as a base for raids into central Lithuania in hopes that a weakened Traidenis would discontinue his support of Semigalians who rebelled against the order. Traidenis besieged the castle for a month, but failed to capture it. Historiography often claims that the order started the campaign into Lithuania in retaliation for the siege. However, newer research by Edvardas Gudaviƒçius and Art≈´ras Dudonis deny a direct cause and effect relationship between the siege and the campaign, as the siege is dated 1274. They claim that the campaign was a result of a broken peace treaty between Lithuania and Livonia. The peace was concluded so that Traidenis could concentrate on his war with Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia. Livonia and Lithuania also competed for trade along the Daugava River and for influence in the Principality of Polotsk. Campaign and battle The Livonian campaign, which opened in February 1279, involved a chevauch√©e into Lithuanian territory. The Livonian army included men from the Livonian Order, Archbishopric of Riga, Danish Estonia, and local Curonian and Semigallian tribes. At the time of the campaign, Lithuania suffered a famine and Traidenis' brother Sirputis raided Polish lands around Lublin. The Livonian army reached as far as Kernavƒó, the center of the Grand Duke's lands. They did not meet any open resistance and plundered many villages. On their way home the knights were followed by a small force of Traidenis' troops. When the enemies approached Aizkraukle, the Grand Master sent most of the local warriors home with their share of loot. At that point the Lithuanians attacked. The Semigallians were one of the first to retreat from the battlefield and the Lithuanians achieved a decisive victory. Aftermath The order lost its achievements over six preceding years: the Semigallians rebelled once again and submitted to Traidenis for protection. However, Traidenis died ca. 1282 and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was unable to reap all the benefits. The order decided to elect one grand master with the Teutonic Knights so that any future attacks would be carried out simultaneously from the west and north.

It was dedicated to Mme A. Veyret, written and published in 1846. It opens with Allegro maestoso, time. This work was slow to gain favor with musicians, due to its harmonic complexity and intricate form. Arthur Hedley was one of the first critics to speak positively of the work, writing in 1947 that it 'works on the hearer's imagination with a power of suggestion equaled only by the F minor Fantasy or the fourth Ballade', although Arthur Rubinstein, Leff Pouishnoff, Claudio Arrau and Vladimir Horowitz had been including it in their programs some decades earlier. It is intimately indebted to the polonaise for its metre, much of its rhythm, and some of its melodic character, but the fantaisie is the operative formal paradigm (Samson, 1988), and Chopin is said to have referred initially to the piece only as a Fantasy. Parallels with the Fantaisie in F minor include the work's overall tonality, A-flat, the key of its slower middle section, B major, and the motive of the descending fourth. Jeffrey Kallberg has suggested that the Polonaise-Fantaisie represents a change in Chopin's style from 'late' to 'last'.Jeffrey Kallberg. Journal of the American Musicological Society, Vol. 38, No. 2 (Summer, 1985), pp. 264-315 It is suggested that the formal ambiguities of the piece (particularly the unconventional and musically misleading transitions into and out of the lyrical inner section) are the most significant defining qualities of this 'last style', which only includes this and one other piece‚Äîthe F minor Mazurka (Op. 68, No. 4), Chopin's last composition.

The house is situated near to Wroxall on the Isle of Wight, England. It is now managed by English Heritage and is open to the public. A small part of the estate that once surrounded it is still intact, but other features of the estate are still visible in the surrounding farmland and nearby village of Wroxall, including the entrance to the park, the Freemantle Gate, now used only by farm animals and pedestrians. History The Tudor Appuldurcombe House in 1690, drawn by Sir Robert Worsley, dated 1720 Appuldurcombe began as a priory in 1100. It became a convent, then the Elizabethan home of the Leigh family. The large Tudor mansion was bequeathed in 1690 to Sir Robert Worsley, 3rd Baronet, who began planning a suitable replacement. Of the existing property, he wrote:Published in Worsley, Sir Richard, History of the Isle of Wight, London, 1781, between pp.180/1 1702: Baroque mansion \\"Appuldurcombe Park, the seat of the Right Honourable Sir Richard Worsley Baronet, Governor and Vice-Admiral of the Isle of Wight\\". Engraving published in: Worsley, Sir Richard, History of the Isle of Wight, London, 1781 The present house was begun in 1702. The architect was John James. Sir Robert never saw the house fully completed. He died on 29 July 1747, in his memory a monument was erected overlooking the house on Stenbury Down. The house was greatly extended in the 1770s by his great-nephew Sir Richard Worsley, 7th Baronet Worsley of Appuldurcombe. The newly extended mansion was where Sir Richard brought his new wife, the 17-year-old Seymour Dorothy Fleming, whom he married \\"for love and ¬£80,000\\". Capability Brown was commissioned in 1779 to design the ornamental grounds at the same time as the extensions. A romantic ruined folly known as \\"Cooke‚Äôs Castle\\" was built on the hill opposite to improve the view. During Sir Richard's time, the house held a magnificent art collection and was the setting for Sir Richard's entertaining of some of the most eminent figures of the age. The setting of the house within the South Wight countryside. The house is at the centre of the picture. Appuldurcombe House circa 1910 Sir Richard's marriage quickly fell apart, and the couple's only child, a son, died in infancy. After he sued one of his wife's rumoured 27 lovers, the couple informally separated. Seymour could not remarry until Richard's death, and she became a professional mistress or demimondaine, living off the donations of rich men in order to survive, joining other upper- class women in a similar position in the New Female Coterie.Rubenhold (2008) pp. 171‚Äì183 Sir Richard died of apoplexy on 8 August 1805 at Appledurcombe, and was buried at the parish church at Godshill. His title passed to his fourth cousin, Henry Worsley-Holmes, whilst his wife's ¬£70,000 jointure () reverted to her, and just over a month later she remarried. Worsley had left the estate saddled with heavy debts, but Appuldurcombe passed to his niece, Henrietta Anna Maria Charlotte (daughter of John Bridgeman Simpson). She married the Hon. Charles Anderson-Pelham, later first Earl of Yarborough, in 1806. The founder of the Royal Yacht Squadron at Cowes, he made few changes to the house and was quite happy to retain the property as a convenient base for his sailing activities. In 1855 the estate was sold. An unsuccessful business venture ran Appuldurcombe as a hotel, but with its failure, the house was then leased as Dr Pound's Academy for young gentlemen. The house was inhabited in 1901‚Äì1907 by a hundred Benedictine monks who had been exiled from Solesmes Abbey in France and were shortly to settle at Quarr Abbey on the Isle of Wight. Second World War: damage Troops were billeted in the house during both world wars, and at the onset of the Second World War the house was taken over by the military. On 7 February 1943, a German Luftwaffe Dornier Do 217 that was engaged in a mine-laying mission turned inland and dropped its final mine very close to the house, before crashing into St Martin's Down. The mine exploded, blowing in windows and causing the collapse of part of the roof. The resulting hole in the roof was left unrepaired, and after the war much of the remainder of the roof and the interiors were removed and sold off. Present View from the northeast The ruined interior of Appuldurcombe House Although the house is now mainly a shell, its front section has been re-roofed and glazed, and a small part of the interior recreated. The house has become well known as one of the supposedly most haunted places on the island. There are frequent tales and claimed sightings of ghosts, phantoms and other supernatural phenomena. During the summer holidays, weekly ghost walks are held at Appuldurcombe every Thursday evening. As of January 2016, Appuldurcombe House and surrounding estate are for sale for ¬£4.75 million.

The size of a page depends on the context, and the significance of zero page memory versus higher addressed memory is highly dependent on machine architecture. For example, the Motorola 6800 and MOS Technology 6502 processor families treat the first 256 bytes of memory specially, whereas many other processors do not. Unlike more modern hardware, in the 1970s computer RAM was as fast as or faster than the CPU. Thus it made sense to have few registers and use the main memory as an extended pool of extra registers. In machines with a relatively wide 16-bit address bus and comparatively narrow 8-bit data bus, accessing zero page locations could be faster than accessing other locations. Zero page addressing now has mostly historical significance, since the developments in integrated circuit technology have made adding more registers to a CPU less expensive and CPU operations much faster than RAM accesses.  Size  The actual size of the zero page in bytes is determined by the microprocessor design and in older designs, is often equal to the largest value that can be referenced by the processor's indexing registers. For example, the aforementioned 8-bit processors have 8-bit index registers and a page size of 256 bytes. Therefore, their zero page extends from address 0 to address 255.  Computers with few CPU registers  In early computers, including the PDP-8, the zero page had a special fast addressing mode, which facilitated its use for temporary storage of data and compensated for the relative shortage of CPU registers. The PDP-8 had only one register, so zero page addressing was essential. Unlike more modern hardware, in the 1970s computer RAM was as fast as or faster than the CPU. Thus it made sense to have few registers and use the main memory as an extended pool of extra registers. In machines with a relatively wide 16-bit address bus and comparatively narrow 8-bit data bus, accessing zero page locations could be faster than accessing other locations. Since zero page locations could be addressed by a single byte, the instructions accessing them could be smaller and faster loading. For example, the MOS Technology 6502 has only one general purpose register (the accumulator). As a result, it used the zero page extensively. Many instructions are coded differently for zero page and non-zero page addresses: LDA $00 ; zero page LDA $0000 ; non-zero page The above two instructions both accomplish the same thing: they load the value of memory location $00 into the .A register (accumulator). However, the first instruction is only two bytes long and requires three clock cycles to complete. The second instruction is three bytes in length and requires four clock cycles to execute. This difference in execution time could become significant in repetitive code. Null pointers Contrary to the zero page's original preferential use, some modern operating systems such as FreeBSD, Linux and Microsoft Windows actually make the zero page inaccessible to trap uses of null pointers. Such pointer values may legitimately indicate uninitialized values or sentinel nodes, but they do not point to valid objects. Buggy code may try to access an object via a null pointer, and this can be trapped at the operating system level as a memory access violation. Interrupt vectors Some computer architectures still reserve the beginning of address space for other purposes, though; for instance, Intel x86 systems reserve the first 256 double-words of address space for the interrupt vector table (IVT) if they run in real mode. A similar technique of using the zero page for hardware related vectors was employed in the ARM architecture. In badly written programs this could lead to \\"ofla\\" behaviour, where a program tries to read information from an unintended memory area, and treats executable code as data or vice versa. This is especially problematic if the zero page area is used to store system jump vectors and the firmware is tricked into overwriting them.  CP/M  In 8-bit CP/M, the zero page is used for communication between the running program and the operating system. Page addressing In some processor architectures, like that of the Intel 4004 4-bit processor, memory was divided into (256 byte) pages and special precautions had to be taken when the control flow crossed page boundaries, as some machine instructions exhibited different behaviour if located in the last few instructions of a page, so that only few instructions were recommended to jump between pages.

The UK first edition carries a copyright date of 1942 and retailed at eight shillings while the US edition was priced at $2.00. The book features Hercule Poirot. Five Little Pigs is unusual in the way that the same events are retold from the viewpoints of five people present on the day of the murder sixteen years earlier. The novel was received positively at the time of publication. The \\"author's uncanny skill. The answer to the riddle is brilliant.\\" and its \\"smashing last-minute showdown(s) . . .well up to the standard\\" sum up the reactions of two reviewers. Another said the author presented a \\"very pretty problem for the ingenious reader\\" and felt that the clue to the solution was \\"completely satisfying\\". Later reviewers used stronger terms of praise, of \\"the-murder-in-the-past plot\\" as being the best of Christie's use of that device, and \\"All in all, it is a beautifully tailored book, rich and satisfying\\" and possibly her best novel. The solution of the mystery was \\"not only immediately convincing but satisfying as well, and even moving in its inevitability and its bleakness.\\" Plot Sixteen years after Caroline Crale is convicted for the murder of her husband Amyas, her daughter Carla Lemarchant approaches Hercule Poirot. In the meeting, Carla claims her mother was innocent, and told her so in the letter she received at age 21, from her mother. She fears that her fianc√© will leave her if the truth behind the murder is not found. Poirot agrees to her request and begins researching the case. He learns that on the day of the murder, there were five other people at the Crales' home, whom he dubs \\"the five little pigs\\" ‚Äî Phillip Blake, a stockbroker; Meredith Blake, Phillip's brother and an amateur chemist; Angela Warren, Caroline's much younger half-sister; Cecilia Williams, Angela's governess, and Elsa Greer (now Lady Dittisham), a young woman who is the subject of Amyas's latest painting. The police investigation discovered that Amyas was poisoned by coniine, found in a glass from which he had drunk cold beer. The poison had been stolen from Meredith's lab by Caroline, who confessed to stealing it because she planned to use it to commit suicide. As the police learned Caroline had provided the bottle of cold beer, they determined she was the murderer. Her motive was believed to be her husband‚Äôs plan to divorce her and marry Elsa, his latest mistress. He had had mistresses before but never left Caroline. Interviewing each of the five other suspects, Poirot notes that none of them have an obvious motive: the Blake brothers have differing views about Caroline; Elsa recalls overhearing an argument between Caroline and Amyas, in which he swore he would divorce his wife and she made a bitter remark of \\"you and your women\\" in response; Amyas was about to send Angela away, based on a remark heard by the Blake brothers; Meredith recalled seeing Amyas give his painting a \\"malevolent glare\\"; Cecilia witnessed Caroline wiping the beer bottle of fingerprints while waiting by Amyas's body. Angela is the only one to believe her sister is innocent. Assembling the suspects together, along with Carla and her fianc√©, Poirot reveals that Caroline was innocent, yet chose not to defend herself in court because she believed Angela had committed the murder. His investigation revealed that Angela had been angry with Amyas, and was planning a prank, unaware of the tensions between her sister and Amyas. Angela had handled the beer bottle, but added nothing to it, as her sister had stopped her. Caroline took that bottle of beer to bring to her husband. When she later found her husband dead, Caroline assumed her sister had added something to the bottle, and acted to take the blame away from her sister. When the police charged Caroline with murder, she did not fight for herself, suspecting no other guilty party. Caroline saw this as a way to atone for her own action in childhood against her sister, when she had thrown a paperweight at the little girl, which left her blind in her right eye and scarred down the right side of her face. Poirot saw Caroline‚Äôs action of wiping off the bottle as proving that she was not guilty. Caroline assumed the poison was in the bottle when it was in the drinking glass per the police's findings. Poirot then reveals that Angela had been in Meredith's lab to steal some valerian to use as part of that prank that never happened. Poirot states that the murderer was Elsa Greer. Elsa took his promise to marry her seriously, unaware Amyas spoke to keep her only until the painting was done. Upon hearing Amyas reassuring his wife that he was not leaving her, and was in the same category as his previous mistresses, Elsa felt betrayed and wanted him dead. When Caroline and Amyas spoke later, misheard in part by the Blake brothers, his remark was about his plans to send Elsa away when the painting was finished. Elsa had seen Caroline take the coniine in Meredith's lab; Elsa took it from Caroline‚Äôs room under the pretence of fetching a cardigan, and then used it in a glass of warm beer she gave Amyas; his remark of \\"everything tastes foul today\\" revealed to Poirot that Amyas must have drunk something before the cold beer Caroline brought, which had tasted foul, and that was the warm beer given him by Elsa. As he painted, Amyas did not know he had been poisoned until he began to grow weaker, at which point he knew; the painting itself and the \\"malevolent glare\\" noticed by Meredith revealed that Amyas knew that it was Elsa. Poirot's explanation solves the case to the satisfaction of Carla and her fianc√©. Then Elsa speaks alone with Poirot. Although the chances of getting a pardon or a conviction are slim with circumstantial evidence, Poirot plans to present his findings to the police. Elsa confirms the measure of her defeat, as she felt that Amyas and Caroline had escaped together, leaving her own life to be empty.

Literary significance and reception Author and critic Maurice Willson Disher's review in The Times Literary Supplement of 16 January 1943 concluded, \\"No crime enthusiast will object that the story of how the painter died has to be told many times, for this, even if it creates an interest which is more problem than plot, demonstrates the author's uncanny skill. The answer to the riddle is brilliant.\\" Maurice Richardson reviewed the novel in the 10 January 1943 issue of The Observer, writing: \\"Despite only five suspects, Mrs Christie, as usual, puts a ring through the reader's nose and leads him to one of her smashing last-minute showdowns. This is well up to the standard of her middle Poirot period. No more need be said.\\" J D Beresford in The Guardian's 20 January 1943 review, wrote: \\"...Christie never fails us, and her Five Little Pigs presents a very pretty problem for the ingenious reader\\". He concluded that the clue as to who had committed the crime was \\"completely satisfying\\". Robert Barnard has strong praise for this novel and its plot. He remarked that it was \\"The-murder-in-the-past plot on its first and best appearance ‚Äì accept no later substitutes. Presentation more intricate than usual, characterization more subtle.\\" His judgment was that \\"All in all, it is a beautifully tailored book, rich and satisfying. The present writer would be willing to chance his arm and say that this is the best Christie of all.\\" Charles Osborne praised this novel, saying that \\"The solution of the mystery in Five Little Pigs is not only immediately convincing but satisfying as well, and even moving in its inevitability and its bleakness.\\" References and allusions The novel's title is from a nursery rhyme, usually referred to as This Little Piggy, which is used by Poirot to organise his thoughts regarding the investigation. Each of the five little pigs mentioned in the nursery rhyme is used as a title for a chapter in the book, corresponding to the five suspects. Agatha Christie used this style of title in others novels, including One, Two, Buckle My Shoe, Hickory Dickory Dock, A Pocket Full of Rye, and Crooked House. Hercule Poirot mentions the celebrated case of Hawley Harvey Crippen as an example of a crime reinterpreted to satisfy the public enthusiasm for psychology. Romeo and Juliet is a theme among characters recalling the trial, starting with solicitor Caleb Jonathan reading Juliet's lines from the balcony scene: \\"If that thy bent of love...\\". Jonathan compares Juliet to the character of Elsa Greer, for their passion, recklessness, and lack of concern about other people. Coniine (in the story, specifically coniine hydrobromide, derived from poison hemlock) was indeed the poison with which Socrates took his own life, as described by Phaedo, and has indeed been used to treat whooping cough and asthma. The \\"poisons act\\" referred to is the Pharmacy and Poisons Act 1933, now superseded by the Poisons Act 1972. Hope by George Frederic Watts The painting that is hung upon the wall of Cecilia Williams' room, described as a \\"blind girl sitting on an orange,\\" is by George Frederic Watts and is called \\"Hope.\\" In it, a blind girl is featured with a harp which, though it has only one string left, she does not give up playing. The description is by Oswald Bastable, a character in the third book in the Bastable series by E. Nesbit, titled The New Treasure Seekers. The other identifiable prints are Dante and Beatrice on a bridge, and Primavera by Botticelli. Amyas has two paintings in the Tate. Miss Williams remarks disparagingly that \\"So is one of Mr Epstein's statues,\\" referring to American-born British sculptor Jacob Epstein. When Poirot approaches Meredith Blake, he introduces himself as a friend of Lady Mary Lytton-Gore, a character known from Three Act Tragedy. This case is later referred to by Poirot many years later, in Elephants Can Remember, published in 1972. \\"Take what you want and pay for it, says God\\" is referred to as an \\"old Spanish proverb\\" by Elsa. The same proverb is cited in Hercule Poirot's Christmas. The proverb is mentioned in South Riding (1936), by Winifred Holtby, and in Windfall's Eye (1929), by Edward Verrall Lucas. The \\"interesting tombs in the Fayum\\" refers to the Fayum Basin south of Cairo, famous for Fayum mummy portraits. Angela Warren refers to Shakespeare, and quotes John Milton's Comus: \\"Under the glassy, cool, translucent wave\\". In the UK version of the story Five Little Pigs, Poirot refers to the novel The Moon and Sixpence, by W. Somerset Maugham, when he asks Angela Warren if she had recently read it at the time of the murder. Poirot deduces that Angela must have read The Moon and Sixpence from a detail given in Philip Blake's account of the murder, in which he describes an enraged Angela quarrelling with Amyas and expressing the hope that Amyas would die of leprosy. reprinting The central character of The Moon and Sixpence, Charles Strickland, is a stockbroker who deserts his wife and children to become an artist and eventually dies of leprosy. Adaptations 1960 play In 1960, Christie adapted the book into a play, Go Back for Murder, but edited Poirot out of the story. His function in the story is filled by a young lawyer, Justin Fogg, son of the lawyer who led Caroline Crale's defence. During the course of the play, it is revealed that Carla's fianc√© is an obnoxious American who is strongly against her revisiting the case, and in the end, she leaves him for Fogg. Go Back for Murder previewed in Edinburgh, Scotland. It later came to London's Duchess Theatre on March 23, 1960, but it lasted for only thirty-seven performances. Go Back for Murder was included in the 1978 Christie play collection, The Mousetrap and Other Plays. Television * 2003: Five Little Pigs - Episode 1, Series 9, of Agatha Christie's Poirot, starring David Suchet as Poirot. There were many changes to the story. Caroline was executed, instead of being sentenced to life in prison and then dying a year later. Philip has a romantic infatuation with Amyas, rather than Caroline, the root of his dislike for Caroline. Carla's name was changed to Lucy, and she has no fianc√©. She does not fear she has hereditary criminal tendencies; she merely wishes to prove her mother innocent. After Poirot exposes Elsa, Lucy threatens her with a pistol; Elsa dares her to shoot, but Poirot persuades her to leave Elsa to face justice. :The cast of the 2003 version includes Rachael Stirling as Caroline, Julie Cox as Elsa, Toby Stephens as Philip, Aidan Gillen as Amyas, Sophie Winkleman as adult Angela, Talulah Riley as young Angela, Aimee Mullins as Lucy, Marc Warren as Meredith, Patrick Malahide as Sir Montague Depleach, and Gemma Jones as Miss Williams. * 2009: Cinq petits cochons - Episode 7, Series 1, of Les Petits Meurtres d'Agatha Christie, a French television series. The setting is changed to France, Poirot is omitted, and the case is solved by √âmile Lampion (Marius Colucci), a police detective turned private investigator, and his former boss, Chief Inspector Larosi√®re (Antoine Dul√©ry). The plot is once again adapted very loosely. The character of Philip Blake is omitted. Caroline is alive and exonerated at the end. The identification of the \\"five little pigs\\" with the suspects is omitted, but the rhyme appears in the Carla character's childhood memories of her father. Radio Five Little Pigs was adapted for radio and broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1994, featuring John Moffatt as Poirot.

In its broadest sense, every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing. It involves using email to send advertisements, request business, or solicit sales or donations. Email marketing strategies commonly seek to achieve one or more of three primary objectives, to build loyalty, trust, or brand awareness. The term usually refers to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing a merchant's relationship with current or previous customers, encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business, acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately, and sharing third-party ads.  History  Email marketing has evolved rapidly alongside the technological growth of the 21st century. Prior to this growth, when emails were novelties to the majority of customers, email marketing was not as effective. In 1978, Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) sent out the first mass email to approximately 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET). He claims that this resulted in $13 million worth of sales in DEC products, and highlighted the potential of marketing through mass emails. However, as email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication, in the 1990s, users increasingly began referring to it as \\"spam\\", and began blocking out content from emails with filters and blocking programs. In order to effectively communicate a message through email, marketers had to develop a way of pushing content through to the end user, without being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software. Historically, it has been difficult to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns because target markets cannot be adequately defined. Email marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns on investment and measure and improve efficiency. Email marketing allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time, and to monitor how effective their campaign is in achieving market penetration, revealing a communication channel's scope. At the same time, however, it also means that the more personal nature of certain advertising methods, such as television advertisements, cannot be captured. Types Email marketing can be carried out through different types of emails:  Transactional emails  Transactional emails are usually triggered based on a customer's action with a company. To be qualified as transactional or relationship messages, these communications' primary purpose must be \\"to facilitate, complete, or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has previously agreed to enter into with the sender\\" along with a few other narrow definitions of transactional messaging. Triggered transactional messages include dropped basket messages, password reset emails, purchase or order confirmation emails, order status emails, reorder emails, and email receipts. The primary purpose of a transactional email is to convey information regarding the action that triggered it. But, due to their high open rates (51.3% compared to 36.6% for email newsletters), transactional emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email relationship with customers or subscribers; to anticipate and answer questions; or to cross-sell or up-sell products or services. Many email newsletter software vendors offer transactional email support, which gives companies the ability to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails. There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional email marketing services, which include providing targeted and personalized transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns (such as customer referral programs).  Direct emails  Direct email involves sending an email solely to communicate a promotional message (for example, a special offer or a product catalog). Companies usually collect a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send direct promotional messages to, or they rent a list of email addresses from service companies. Comparison to traditional mail There are both advantages and disadvantages to using email marketing in comparison to traditional advertising mail. Advantages Email marketing is popular with companies for several reasons: * Email marketing is significantly cheaper and faster than traditional mail, mainly because with email, most of the cost falls on the recipient. * Businesses and organizations who send a high volume of emails can use an ESP (email service provider) to gather information about the behavior of the recipients. The insights provided by consumer response to email marketing help businesses and organizations understand and make use of consumer behavior. * Almost half of American Internet users check or send email on a typical day,Pew Internet & American Life Project, \\"Tracking surveys\\" , March 2000 ‚Äì March 2009 with emails delivered between 1 am and 5 am local time outperforming those sent at other times in open and click rates.How Scheduling Affects Rates . Mailermailer.com (July 2012). Retrieved on July 28, 2013.BtoB Magazine, \\"Early Email Blasts Results in Higher Click & Open Rates\\" , September 2011 Disadvantages * As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still an issue for legitimate marketers. According to the report, legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73% in the U.S.; six percent were filtered as spam, and 22% were missing. This lags behind other countries: Australia delivers at 90%, Canada at 89%, Britain at 88%, France at 84%, Germany at 80% and Brazil at 79%.Roberts, A. \\"Email deliverability is on the decline: report\\", ClickZ * Additionally, consumers receive on average about 90 emails per day. * Companies considering the use of an email marketing program must make sure that their program does not violate spam laws such as the United States' Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (CAN-SPAM), the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003, or their Internet service provider's acceptable use policy. Opt-in email advertising Opt-in email advertising, or permission marketing, is advertising via email whereby the recipient of the advertisement has consented to receive it. Fairhead, N. (2003) \\"All hail the brave new world of permission marketing via email\\" (Media 16, August 2003) A common example of permission marketing is a newsletter sent to an advertising firm's customers. Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions, or new products. In this type of advertising, a company that wants to send a newsletter to their customers may ask them at the point of purchase if they would like to receive the newsletter. With a foundation of opted-in contact information stored in their database, marketers can send out promotional materials automatically using autoresponders‚Äîknown as drip marketing. They can also segment their promotions to specific market segments.O'Brian J. & Montazemia, A. (2004) Management Information Systems (Canada: McGraw-Hill Ryerson Ltd.) Legal requirements Australia The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, widely known as \\"ACMA\\". The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages, states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages, and gives other key information. Fines range with three fines of AU$110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines (2011), Tiger Airways Holdings Limited (2012) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited (2013). Canada The \\"Canada Anti-Spam Law\\" (CASL) went into effect on July 1, 2014. CASL requires an explicit or implicit opt-in from users, and the maximum fines for noncompliance are CA$1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.. European Union  In 2002 the European Union (EU) introduced the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications. Article 13 of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses for marketing purposes. The Directive establishes the opt-in regime, where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the recipient; this does not apply to business email addresses. The directive has since been incorporated into the laws of member states. In the UK it is covered under the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003The Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 . Opsi.gov.uk. Retrieved on July 28, 2013. and applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some form of electronic communication. The GDPR in 2018 imposed \\"a number of new requirements on companies that collect, store and process personal data from EU users, which impacts email marketers\\" \\\\- in particular, users' right to access information held about them; and the right to have all such information deleted at their request. United States  The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 was passed by Congress as a direct response to the growing number of complaints over spam emails. Congress determined that the US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation of commercial electronic mail nationally, that those who send commercial emails should not mislead recipients over the source or content of them, and that all recipients of such emails have a right to decline them. The act authorizes a US$16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each individual recipient. However, it does not ban spam emailing outright, but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing methods through headings which are \\"materially false or misleading\\". In addition there are conditions which email marketers must meet in terms of their format, their content and labeling. As a result, many commercial email marketers within the United States utilize a service or special software to ensure compliance with the act. A variety of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with the act. To comply with the act's regulation of commercial email, services also typically require users to authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address, provide a one-click unsubscribe feature, and prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have given valid permission. In addition to satisfying legal requirements, email service providers (ESPs) began to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing campaigns. The service providers supply email templates and general best practices, as well as methods for handling subscriptions and cancellations automatically. Some ESPs will provide insight and assistance with deliverability issues for major email providers. They also provide statistics pertaining to the number of messages received and opened, and whether the recipients clicked on any links within the messages. The CAN-SPAM Act was updated with some new regulations including a no-fee provision for opting out, further definition of \\"sender\\", post office or private mail boxes count as a \\"valid physical postal address\\" and definition of \\"person\\". These new provisions went into effect on July 7, 2008.

Its capital was Quetzaltenango. Los Altos occupied eight departments in the west of present-day Guatemala as well as the Soconusco region in the Mexican state of Chiapas. The state originated from the political differences and tensions between Guatemala City on one side, and Quetzaltenango and other parts of western Central America on the other. Debate about separation from Guatemala dated from shortly after Central American independence from Spain in 1821. Such a separate state was provided for by the Federal constitutional assembly of November 1824, but there was sizable opposition to the separation in Guatemala City. The independence of Los Altos from Guatemala was officially proclaimed on 2 February 1838. The Federal government recognized Los Altos as the sixth state of the union and seated the representatives of Los Altos in the Federal Congress on 5 June of that year. The flag of Los Altos was a modification of that of the Central American Union, with a central seal showing a volcano in the background with a quetzal (a local bird symbolizing liberty) in front. This was the first Central American flag to use the quetzal as a symbol; since 1871, it has been on the present flag of Guatemala. As the liberal Federation crumbled into civil war due to the influence of the Guatemalan conservatives and the regular clergy, who had been expelled from Central America after Francisco Moraz√°n's bloody invasion of Guatemala in 1829, Los Altos declared itself an independent republic.  Administrative divisions  Los Altos consisted of the administrative regions of * Totonicap√°n (the modern Guatemalan departments of Totonicap√°n, Huehuetenango), * Quetzaltenango (the modern departments of Quetzaltenango and San Marcos) and * Suchitep√©quez-Solol√° (the modern departments of Retalhuleu, Suchitep√©quez, Solol√°, and Quich√©).  First invasion of Rafael Carrera  The Coat of Arms of Los Altos, carved in stone on the grave of heroes in the Cemetery of Quetzaltenango. Mariano Rivera Paz. Conservative Chief of State of Guatemala during the time Los Altos was established and then recovered for Guatemala by Rafael Carrera. On April 2, 1838, in the city of Quetzaltenango, a secessionist group founded the independent State of Los Altos, which sought independence from Guatemala. The most important members of the Liberal Party of Guatemala and liberal enemies of the conservative regime moved to Los Altos, rather than needing to emigrate to El Salvador to live in a pro-liberal state. The liberals in Los Altos began a harsh criticism of the Conservative government of Rivera Paz; they even had their own newspaper ‚Äì El Popular, which contributed to the harsh criticism. However, Los Altos was the most productive region with most economic activity of the former State of Guatemala; without Los Altos, conservatives lost many benefits that held the hegemony of the State of Guatemala in Central America. The government of Guatemala tried to reach a peaceful solution, but \\"altenses\\",Altenses is how people from Quetzaltenango are known in Guatemala. protected by the recognition by the Congress of the Central American Federation, did not accept this. Guatemala's government then resorted to force, sending the commanding general of the army, Rafael Carrera, to subdue Los Altos. Carrera defeated General Agust√≠n Guzm√°n when the former Mexican officer tried to ambush him and then went on to Quetzaltenango, where he imposed a harsh and hostile conservative regime for liberals. Calling all council members, he told them flatly that he was behaving kindly to them because it was the first time they had challenged him, but sternly warned them that there would be no mercy if there were to be a second time. General Guzm√°n and the head of state of Los Altos, Marcelo Molina, were sent to the capital of Guatemala, where they were displayed as trophies of war during a triumphant parade on February 17, 1840. Guzm√°n was shackled, wounds still bleeding, and riding a mule.  Second invasion of Rafael Carrera  General Francisco Moraz√°n tried to invade Guatemala for the second time in 1840 after having invaded in 1829 and expelled members of the Aycinena clan and regular orders. In 1840 he was defeated by Carrera overwhelmingly, marking the end of his career in Central America On March 18, 1840, liberal caudillo Francisco Moraz√°n invaded Guatemala with 1500 soldiers to avenge the insult done in Los Altos and fearing that such action would end liberal efforts to hold together the Central American Federation. Guatemala had a cordon of guards from the border with El Salvador; without telegraph service, men ran carrying last minute messages. With the information from these messengers, Carrera hatched a plan of defense leaving his brother Sotero with troops who presented a slight resistance in the city. Carrera pretended to flee and led the ragtag army to the heights of Aceituno as only had about four men and the same number of loads rifle, plus two old cannons. The city was at the mercy of the army of Moraz√°n, with bells of their twenty churches ringing for divine assistance. Once Moraz√°n reached the capital, he took it easily and freed Guzman, who immediately left for Quetzaltenango to give the news that Carrera was defeated. Carrera then took advantage of what his enemies believed and applied a strategy of concentrating fire on the Central Park of the city. His surprise attack tactics caused heavy casualties to the army of Moraz√°n and forced the survivors to fight for their lives.The famous Guatemalan poet Jos√© Batres Mont√∫far participated in these battles In combat, Moraz√°n's soldiers lost the initiative and their numerical superiority. Furthermore, unaware of their surroundings in the city, Morazan's troops had to fight, carry their dead and care for their wounded while still tired by the long march from El Salvador to Guatemala. Carrera, by then an experienced military manCarrera even had suffered two previous defeats at the hands of Moraz√°n. was able to stand up and defeat Moraz√°n thoroughly. The disaster for the liberal general was complete: aided by Angel Molina Angel Molina was the son of Guatemalan Liberal leader Pedro Molina Mazariegos. who knew the streets of the city, he had to flee with his favorite men, disguised and shouting \\"Long live Carrera!\\" through the ravine of El Incienso to El Salvador, to save his life. In his absence Moraz√°n had been relieved as head of state of that country, and he had to embark for exile in Per√∫. In Guatemala, survivors from his troops were shot without mercy, as Carrera pursued Morazan, whom he failed to catch. This lance definitely sealed the status of General Carrera and marked the decline of Moraz√°n, and forced the conservative criollos to negotiate with Carrera and his revolutionary peasant supporters. Agustin Guzm√°n, freed by Moraz√°n when the latter had seemingly defeated Carrera in Guatemala City, had gone back to Quetzaltenango with the good news. The city's liberal criollo leaders rapidly reinstated the Los Altos State and celebrated Moraz√°n's victory. However, as soon as Carrera and the newly reinstated Mariano Rivera Paz heard the news, Carrera went back to Quetzaltenango with his volunteer army to regain control of the rebel liberal state once and for all. On 2 April 1840, after entering the city, Carrera told the citizens that he had already warned them after he defeated them earlier that year. Then he ordered most of the liberal city hall officials from Los Altos shot. Carrera, then forcibly annexed Quetzaltenango and much of Los Altos back into conservative Guatemala. After the violent and bloody reinstatement of the State of Los Altos by Carrera in April 1840, Luis Batres Juarros ‚Äî conservative member of the Aycinena Clan, then secretary general of the Guatemalan government of recently reinstated Mariano Rivera Paz ‚Äî obtained from the vicar Larrazabal authorization to dismantle the regionalist Church. Active priests of Quetzaltenango ‚Äî capital of the would- be-state of Los Altos ‚Äî Urban Ugarte and Jos√© Maria Aguilar, were removed from their parish and likewise the priests of the parishes of San Martin Jilotepeque and San Lucas Tolim√°n. Larrazabal ordered the priests Fernando Antonio D√°vila, Mariano Navarrete and Jose Ignacio Iturrioz to cover the parishes of Quetzaltenango, San Martin Jilotepeque and San Lucas Toliman, respectively. Captain General Rafael Carrera after being appointed President for Life of the Republic of Guatemala in 1854. The defeat of the liberal criollos in Quetzaltenango reinforced Carrera allies' status within the native population of the area, whom he respected and protected as the leader of the peasant revolution. Taking advantage of the chaos and unsettled situation, the Soconusco region was annexed by Mexico. In 1844, 1848, and 1849, unsuccessful revolts against the dictatorship of Rafael Carrera briefly reproclaimed the independence of Los Altos.  Carrera's exile and Los Altos  Proclamation Coin 1847 of the independent Republic of Guatemala During his first term as president, Rafael Carrera brought the country back from excessive conservatism to a traditional climate. However, in 1848, the liberals were able to force Rafael Carrera to leave office, after the country had been in turmoil for several months. Carrera resigned of his own free will and left for M√©xico. The new liberal regime allied itself with the Aycinena family and swiftly passed a law which they emphatically ordered the execution of Carrera if he dared to return to Guatemalan soil. In his absence, the liberal criollos from Quetzaltenango ‚Äî led by general Agust√≠n Guzm√°n who occupied the city after Corregidor general Mariano Paredes was called to Guatemala City to take over the Presidential office- declared that Los Altos was an independent state once again on 26 August 1848; the new state had the support of Vasconcelos' regime in El Salvador and the rebel guerrilla army of Vicente and Serapio Cruz who were declared enemies of general Carrera. The interim government was led by Guzm√°n himself and had Florencio Molina and the priest Fernando Davila as his Cabinet members. On 5 September 1848, the criollo altenses chose a formal government led by Fernando Antonio Mart√≠nez. In the meantime, Carrera returned to Guatemala and entered by Huehuetenango, where he met with the native leaders and told them that they had to remain united to prevail. The leaders agreed and slowly the segregated native communities started to develop a new Indian identity under Carrera's leadership. In the meantime, in the eastern part of Guatemala, the Jalapa region became increasingly dangerous; former president Mariano Rivera Paz and rebel leader Vicente Cruz were both murdered there after trying to take over the Corregidor office in 1849. Upon learning that officer Jos√© V√≠ctor Zavala had been appointed as Corregidor in Suchitep√©quez, Carrera and his hundred jacalteco bodyguards crossed a dangerous jungle infested with jaguars to meet his former friend. When they met, Zavala not only did not capture him, but agreed to serve under his orders, thus sending a strong message to both liberal and conservatives in Guatemala City, who realized that they were forced to negotiate with Carrera, otherwise they were going to have to battle on two fronts ‚Äî Quetzaltenango and Jalapa. Carrera went back to the Quetzaltenango area, while Zavala remained in Suchitep√©quez as a tactical maneuver. Carrera received a visit from a Cabinet member of Paredes and told him that he had control of the native population and that he would keep them appeased. When the emissary returned to Guatemala City, he told the president everything Carrera said, and added that the native forces were formidable. Agust√≠n Guzm√°n went to Antigua Guatemala to meet with another group of Paredes emissaries; they agreed that Los Altos would rejoin Guatemala, and that the latter would help Guzm√°n defeat his hated enemy and also build a port on the Pacific Ocean. Guzm√°n was sure of victory this time, but his plan evaporated when, in his absence, Carrera and his native allies occupied Quetzaltenango. Carrera appointed Ignacio Yrigoyen as Corregidor and convinced him that he should work with the K'iche', Q‚Äôanjob‚Äôal, and Mam leaders to keep the region under control. On his way out, Yrigoyen murmured to a friend: Now he is the King of the Indians, indeed! The region is still distinctive, and Los Altos is still a nickname for the region of Guatemala around Quetzaltenango. Similarly, the Mexican portion of the former state is known as Los Altos de Chiapas.

Depiction of a chakravartin, possibly Ashoka, with a 16-spoked wheel (1st century BCE/CE) The Ashoka Chakra is a depiction of the Dharma Chakra; a wheel represented with 24 spokes. It is so called because it appears on a number of edicts of Ashoka, most prominent among which is the Lion Capital of Ashoka. The most visible use of the Ashoka Chakra today is at the centre of the Flag of India (adopted on 24 July 1947), where it is rendered in a navy blue colour on a white background, replacing the symbol of charkha (spinning wheel) of the pre-independence versions of the flag. India's highest peacetime military decoration awarded for valour, courageous action or self-sacrifice away from the battlefield is also called Ashoka Chakra.  Symbolic history  When Gautama Buddha achieved enlightenment at Bodh Gaya, he came to Sarnath, on the outskirts of Varanasi. There, he found his five disciples Assaji, MahƒÅnƒÅman, Konda√±√±a, Bhaddiya and Vappa, who had earlier abandoned him. He introduced his first teachings to them, thereby establishing the dharmachakra. This is the motive taken up by Ashoka and portrayed on top of his pillars.

The bolt on the right side is a part of a rough adjustment mechanism which allows pointing the optical head in virtually any direction. Artificially enhanced picture of a situation where a Ronja link stops working because of heavy fog RONJA (Reasonable Optical Near Joint Access) is a free- space optical communication system originating in the Czech Republic, developed by Karel Kulhav√Ω of Twibright Labs and released in 2001. It transmits data wirelessly using beams of light. Ronja can be used to create a 10 Mbit/s full duplex Ethernet point-to-point link. It has been estimated that 1000 to 2000 links have been built worldwide The range of the basic configuration is . The device consists of a receiver and transmitter pipe (optical head) mounted on a sturdy adjustable holder. Two coaxial cables are used to connect the rooftop installation with a protocol translator installed in the house near a computer or switch. The range can be extended to by doubling or tripling the transmitter pipe. Building instructions, blueprints, and schematics are published under the GNU Free Documentation Licence. Only free software tools are used in the development. The author calls this level of freedom \\"User Controlled Technology\\". Ronja is a project of Twibright Labs.  Manufacture  The building instructions are written with an inexperienced builder in mind. Basic operations like drilling, soldering etc., are explained. Several techniques ‚Äì drilling templates, detailed checks after soldering, testing procedures ‚Äì are employed to minimize errors at critical places and help to speed up work. Printed circuit boards are downloadable ready for manufacture, with instructions for the fabhouse. People with no previous experience with building electronics have reported on the mailing list that the device ran on the first try. 154 installations worldwide have been registered into a gallery with technical data and pictures.  Range  With the brightest variant of Lumileds HPWT-BD00-F4000 LED and 130 mm diameter cheap Chinese magnifying glass lenses, the range is 1.4 km. The less bright, but easier to buy E4000 variant of HPWT-BD00 yields 1.3 km. The speed is always 10 Mbit/s full duplex regardless of the distance.

Limitations  By definition, clear visibility between the transmitter and receiver is essential. If the beam is obscured in any way, the link will stop working. Typically, problems may occur during conditions of snow or dense fog. One device weighs 15.5 kg and requires 70 hours of building time. It requires an ability to set full duplex manually on the network card or switch to take advantage of full duplex, since it doesn't support autonegotiation. Must be plugged directly into PC or switch using the integral 1 m Ethernet cable.  Technology  Block diagram of a full duplex RONJA system. A complete RONJA system is made up of 2 transceivers: 2 optical transmitters and 2 optical receivers. They are assembled individually or as a combination. The complete system layout is shown in the block diagram.  Optical receiver ‚Äì Preamplifier stage  Map showing the distribution of the 153 registered installations of RONJA as of 1 October 2007. Based on data found at the official RONJA website The usual approach in FSO (Free Space Optics) preamplifiers is to employ a transimpedance amplifier. A transimpedance amplifier is a very sensitive broadband high-speed device featuring a feedback loop. This fact means the layout is plagued with stability problems and special compensation of PIN diode capacitance must be performed, therefore this doesn't allow selection of a wide range of cheap PIN photodiodes with varying capacitances. Ronja however uses a feedbackless design where the PIN has a high working electrical resistance (100 kilohms) which together with the total input capacitance (roughly 8 pF, 5 pF PIN and 3 pF input MOSFET cascode) makes the device operate with a passband on a 6 dB/oct slope of low pass formed by PIN working resistance and total input capacitance.Phanumas Khumsat, Noppadol Wattanapisit, Karel Kulhavey, \\"Low-Cost Laser-Based Wireless Optical Transceiver for 10-Mbps Ethernet Link\\", Proceedings of IEEE Region 10 Conference (TENCON), Hong Kong, China (2006) (full text), pag 2 upper left, mention about \\"unwanted lossy integrator\\". The signal is then immediately amplified to remove the danger of contamination by signal noise, and then a compensation of the 6 dB/oct slope is done by derivator element on the programming pins of an NE592 video amplifier.Phanumas Khumsat, Noppadol Wattanapisit, Karel Kulhavey, \\"Low-Cost Laser-Based Wireless Optical Transceiver for 10-Mbps Ethernet Link\\", Proceedings of IEEE Region 10 Conference (TENCON), Hong Kong, China (2006) (full text) A surprisingly flat characteristic is obtained. If the PIN diode is equipped with 3 kŒ© working resistor to operate in flat band mode, the range is reduced to about 30% due to thermal noise from the 3 kŒ© resistor.  Optical transmitter ‚Äì Nebulus infrared LED driver  The HSDL4220 infrared LED is originally unsuitable for 10 Mbit/s operation. It has a bandwidth of 9 MHz, where 10 Mbit/s Manchester- modulated systems need bandwidth of around 16 MHz. Operation in a usual circuit with current drive would lead to substantial signal corruption and range reduction. Therefore, Twibright Labs developed a special driving technique consisting of driving the LED directly with 15-fold 74AC04 gate output in parallel with RF voltage applied current-unlimited directly to the LED through large capacitors. As the voltage to keep the nominal LED average current (100mA) varies with temperature and component tolerances, an AC- bypassed current sense resistor is put in series with the LED. A feedback loop measures voltage on this resistor and keeps it at a preset level by varying supply voltage of the 74AC04 gates. Therefore, the nominally digital 74AC04 is operating as a structured power CMOS switch completely in analog mode. This way the LED junction is flooded and cleared of carriers as quickly as possible, basically by short circuit discharge. This pushes the speed of the LED to maximum, which makes the output optical signal fast enough so that the range/power ratio is the same as with the faster red HPWT-BD00-F4000 LED. The side effects of this brutal driving technique are: 1) the LED overshoots at the beginning of longer (5 MHz/1 MHz) impulses to about 2x brightness. This was measured to have no adverse effect on range. 2) A blocking ceramic capacitor bank backing up the 74AC04 switching array is crucial for correct operation, because charging and discharging the LED is done by short circuit. Under dimensioning this bank causes the leading and trailing edges of the optical output to grow longer.  Transceiver ‚Äì Ronja Twister  Ronja Twister is an electronic interface for free space optical datalink based on counter and shift register chips. It is a part of the Ronja design. It is effectively an optical Ethernet transceiver without the optical drive part. The original design has been superseded with Twister2 but the logic circuit remained the same.

Open source hardware approach  Soderberg, studying Ronja sociologically, writes: \\"Arguably, the first project that vindicated the methods and licensing schemes of free software development, applied those practices to open hardware development, and pulled off a state-of-the-art technology without any backing from universities or firms, was the Ronja project.\\" The whole toolchain is built strictly upon free tools and the source files are provided, free, under the GPL. This allows anyone to enter the development, start manufacture or invest into the technology without entry costs. Such costs normally can include software licence costs, time investment into resolution of compatibility issues between proprietary applications, or costs of intellectual property licence negotiations.

Unifying what is now modern Vietnam in 1802, he founded the Nguy·ªÖn dynasty, the last of the Vietnamese dynasties. A nephew of the last Nguy·ªÖn lord who ruled over southern Vietnam, Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh was forced into hiding in 1777 as a fifteen-year-old when his family was slain in the T√¢y S∆°n revolt. After several changes of fortune in which his loyalists regained and again lost Saigon, he befriended the French Catholic priest Pigneau de Behaine. Pigneau championed his cause to the French government and managed to recruit volunteers when that fell through to help Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh regain the throne. From 1789, Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh was once again in the ascendancy and began his northward march to defeat the T√¢y S∆°n, reaching the border with China by 1802, which had previously been under the control of the Tr·ªãnh lords. Following their defeat, he succeeded in reuniting Vietnam after centuries of internecine feudal warfare, with a greater land mass than ever before, stretching from China down to the Gulf of Siam. Gia Long's rule was noted for its Confucian orthodoxy. He overcame the T√¢y S∆°n rebellion and reinstated the classical Confucian education and civil service system. He moved the capital from Hanoi south to Hu·∫ø as the country's populace had also shifted south over the preceding centuries, and built up fortresses and a palace in his new capital. Using French expertise, he modernized Vietnam's defensive capabilities. In deference to the assistance of his French friends, he tolerated the activities of Roman Catholic missionaries, something that became increasingly restricted under his successors. Under his rule, Vietnam strengthened its military dominance in Indochina, expelling Siamese forces from Cambodia and turning it into a vassal state. Early years Born on 8 February 1762, he also had two other names in his childhood: Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c Ch·ªßng (ÈòÆÁ¶èÁ®Æ) and Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c No√£n (ÈòÆÁ¶èÊöñ). Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh was the third son of Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c Lu√¢n and Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã Ho√†n. Luan was the second son of Lord Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c Kho√°t of southern Vietnam; the first son had already predeceased the incumbent Lord. There are differing accounts on which son was the designated successor. According to one theory, Lu√¢n was the designated heir, but a high-ranking mandarin named Tr∆∞∆°ng Ph√∫c Loan changed Khoat's will of succession on his deathbed, and installed Luan's younger brother Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c Thu·∫ßn, the sixteenth son, the throne in 1765. Luan was jailed and died in the 1765, the same year as Thuan's installation.Kim, p. 335. However, the historian Choi Byung Wook claims that the notion that Lu√¢n was the designated heir was based on fact but was propagated by 19th century Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty historians after Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh had taken the throne as Gia Long to establish the emperor's legitimacy.Choi, p. 26. According to Choi, Lord Kho√°t had originally chosen the ninth son, who then died, leaving Loan to install Lord Thu·∫ßn.Choi, p. 25. At the time, the alternative was the eldest son of the ninth son, Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c D∆∞∆°ng, whom opposition groups later tried unsuccessfully to convince to join them as a figurehead to lend legitimacy. In 1775, Thuan was forced to share power with D∆∞∆°ng by military leaders who supported the Nguy√™ns. At this time, Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh was a minor member of the family and did not have any political support among court powerbrokers.Choi, pp. 25-26. However, Thuan lost his position as lord of southern Vietnam and was killed, along with Duong, during the T√¢y S∆°n rebellion led by the brothers Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c, Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá and Nguy·ªÖn L·ªØ in 1777.Hall, p. 426. Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh was the most senior member of the ruling family to have survived the T√¢y S∆°n victory, which pushed the Nguy·ªÖn from their heartland in central Vietnam, southwards towards Saigon and into the Mekong Delta region in the far south.Hall, p. 423.Cady, p. 282. This turn of events changed the nature of the Nguy·ªÖn power hierarchy; the family and the first leader Nguy·ªÖn Ho√†ng had originally come from Thanh Hoa Province in northern Vietnam, and this is where most of their senior military and civil leadership's heritage derived from, but as a result of the T√¢y S∆°n's initial successes, much of this old power base was destroyed and Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh had to rebuild his support network among southerners, who later became the core of the regime when the Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty was established.Choi, pp. 24-25. Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh was sheltered by a Catholic priest Paul Nghi (Phaol√¥ H·ªì VƒÉn Ngh·ªã) in R·∫°ch Gi√°. Later, he fled to H√† Ti√™n on the southern coastal tip of Vietnam, where he met Pigneau de Behaine,McLeod, p. 7.Karnow, p. 75. a French priest who became his adviser and played a major part in his rise to power. Receiving information from Paul Nghi, Pigneau avoided the Tay Son army in Cambodia, and came back to assist Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh. They hid in the forest to avoid the pursuit of Tay Son army. Together, they escaped to the island of Pulo Panjang in the Gulf of Siam.Buttinger, p. 234. Pigneau hoped that by playing a substantial role in a Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh victory, he would be in position to lever important concessions for the Catholic Church in Vietnam, helping its expansion in Southeast Asia.McLeod, p. 9. Pigneau de Behaine, the French priest who recruited armies for Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh during the war against the T√¢y S∆°n. In late 1777, the main part of the T√¢y S∆°n army left Saigon to go north and attack the Tr·ªãnh lords, who ruled the other half of Vietnam. Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh stealthily returned to the mainland, rejoining his supporters and reclaimed the city of Saigon.Buttinger, p. 233. He was crucially aided by the efforts of Do Thanh Nhon, a senior Nguy·ªÖn Lord commander who had organized an army for him,Hall, p. 427. which was supplemented by Cambodian mercenaries and Chinese pirates.Buttinger, p. 235. The following year, Nhon expelled additional T√¢y S∆°n troops from the surrounding province of Gia Dinh and inflicted heavy losses on the T√¢y S∆°n naval fleet. Taking advantage of the more favorable situation, Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh sent a diplomatic mission to Siam to propose a treaty of friendship. This potential pact, however, was derailed in 1779 when the Cambodians rose up against their pro-Siamese leader Ang Non II. Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh sent Nhon to assist the revolt, which eventually saw Ang Non II defeated decisively and executed. Nhon returned to Saigon with high honor and concentrated his efforts on improving the Nguy·ªÖn navy. In 1780, in an attempt to strengthen his political status, Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh proclaimed himself Nguy·ªÖn v∆∞∆°ng (Nguy·ªÖn king or Nguy·ªÖn ruler in Vietnamese)Dutton, p. 45.Kim, p. 342. with the support of Nhon's D√¥ng S∆°n Army. In 1781, Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh sent further forces to prop up the Cambodian regime against Siamese armies who wanted to reassert their control. Shortly thereafter, Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh had Nhon brutally murdered. The reason remains unclear, but it was postulated that he did so because Nhon's fame and military success was overshadowing him. At the time, Nhon had much, if not dominant power, behind the scenes. According to later Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty chronicles, Nhon's powers included that of deciding who would receive the death penalty, and allocating budget expenditures. Nhon also refused to allocate money for royal spending. Nhon and his men were also reported to have acted in an abrasive and disrespectful manner to Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh. The T√¢y S∆°n brothers reportedly broke out in celebration upon hearing of Nhon's execution, as Nhon was the Nguy·ªÖn officer that they feared the most. Large parts of Nhon's supporters rebelled, weakening the Nguy·ªÖn army, and within a few months, the T√¢y S∆°n had recaptured Saigon mainly on the back of naval barrages. Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh was forced to flee to Ha Tien, and then onto the island of Phu Quoc. Meanwhile, some of his forces continued to resist in his absence.Hall, p. 428. While the murder of Nhon weakened Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh in the short term, as many southerners who were personally loyal to Nhon broke away and counter-attacked, it also allowed Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh to gain autonomy and then take steps towards exerted direct control over the remaining local forces of the Dong Son who were willing to work with him. Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh also benefited from the support of Chau Van Tiep, who had a power base in the central highlands between the strongholds of the Nguy·ªÖn and the T√¢y S∆°n.Choi, pp. 26-27. In October 1782, the tide shifted again, when forces led by Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c M√¢n, Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh's younger brother, and Chau Van Tiep drove the T√¢y S∆°n out of Saigon.Kim, p. 323. Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh returned to Saigon, as did Pigneau The hold was tenuous, and a counterattack by the T√¢y S∆°n in early 1783 saw a heavy defeat to the Nguy·ªÖn, with Nguyen Man killed in battle. Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh again fled to Phu Quoc, but this time his hiding place was discovered. He managed to escape the pursuing T√¢y S∆°n fleet to Koh-rong island in the Bay of Kompongsom. Again, his hideout was discovered and encircled by the rebel fleet. However, a typhoon hit the area, and he managed to break the naval siege and escape to another island amid the confusion. In early-1784, Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh went to seek Siamese aid, which was forthcoming, but the extra 20,000 men failed to weaken the T√¢y S∆°n's hold on power. This forced Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh to become a refugee in Siam in 1785.Cady, p. 283. To make matters worse, the T√¢y S∆°n regularly raided the rice growing areas of the south during the harvesting season, depriving the Nguy·ªÖn of their food supply.Mantienne, p. 520. Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh eventually came to the conclusion that using Siamese military aid would generate a backlash amongst the populace, due to prevailing Vietnamese hostility towards Siam. Pigneau and French assistance Portrait of Prince C·∫£nh, the eldest son of Gia Long, 1787 Deflated by his situation, Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh asked Pigneau to appeal for French aid, and allowed Pigneau to take his son Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c C·∫£nh with him as a sign of good faith.Karnow, p. 76. This came about after Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh had considered enlisting English, Dutch, Portuguese and Spanish assistance.Buttinger, pp. 236, 266. Pigneau advised against Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh's original plan to seek Dutch aid from Batavia, fearing that the support of the Protestant Dutch would hinder the advancement of Catholicism. Pigneau left Vietnam in December, arriving in Pondicherry, India in February 1785 with Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh's royal seal. Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh had authorized him to make concessions to France in return for military assistance.Buttinger, p. 236. The French administration in Pondicherry, led by acting governor Coutenceau des Algrains, was conservative in outlook and resolutely opposed intervention in southern Vietnam.Hall, p. 429. To compound the already complex situation, Pigneau was denounced by Spanish Franciscans in the Vatican, and he sought to transfer his political mandate to Portuguese forces. The Portuguese had earlier offered Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh 56 ships to use against the T√¢y S∆°n.Buttinger, p. 237. In July 1786, after more than 12 months of fruitless lobbying in Pondicherry, Governor de Cossigny allowed Pigneau to travel back to France to directly ask the royal court for assistance.McLeod, p. 10. Arriving at the court of Louis XVI in Versailles in February 1787, Pigneau had difficulty in gathering support for a French expedition in support of Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh. This was due to the parlous financial state of the country prior to the French Revolution. Pigneau was helped by Pierre Poivre, who had previously been involved in seeking French commercial interests in Vietnam.Buttinger, p. 238. Pigneau told the court that if France invested in Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh and acquired a few fortified positions on the Vietnamese coast in return, then they would have the capability to \\"dominate the seas of China and of the archipelago\\", and with it, control of Asian commerce. In November 1787, a treaty of alliance was concluded between France and Cochinchina, the European term for southern Vietnam, in Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh's name. Pigneau signed the treaty as the \\"Royal Commissioner of France for Cochinchina\\". France promised four frigates, 1,650 fully equipped French soldiers and 250 Indian sepoys in return for the cession of Pulo Condore and Tourane (Da Nang), as well as tree trade to the exclusion of all other countries. However, the freedom to spread Christianity was not included. However, Pigneau found that Governor Thomas Conway of Pondicherry was unwilling to fulfill the agreement;Buttinger, p. 239. Conway had been instructed by Paris to determine when to organize the aid, if at all. Pigneau was thus forced to use funds raised in France to enlist French volunteers and mercenaries.Karnow, p. 77. He also managed to procure several shipments of arms and munitions from Mauritius and Pondicherry. Phra Thinang Amarin Winitchai, Bangkok, 1782. Meanwhile, the Royal Court of Siam in Bangkok, under King Rama I, warmly welcomed Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh. The Vietnamese refugees were allowed to built a small village between Samsen and Bangpho, and named it Long-k·ª≥ (Thai: Lat Tonpho). √Ånh had stayed in Siam with a contingent of troops until August 1787. His soldiers served in Siam's war against Bodawpaya of Burma (1785‚Äì86). On 18 December 1786, Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh signed a treaty of alliance with the Portuguese in Bangkok. In the next year, Ant√≥nio (An T√¥n L·ªói), a Portuguese from Goa, came to Bangkok, brought Western soldiers and warships to √Ånh. This disgusted the Siamese and √Ånh had to refuse the aid from Portuguese. After this incident, √Ånh was no longer trusted by the Siamese. Having consolidated their hold on southern Vietnam, the T√¢y S∆°n decided to move north to unify the country. However, the withdrawal of troops from the Gia Dinh garrison weakened them their hold on the south. This was compounded by reports that Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c was being attacked near Qui Nh∆°n by his own brother Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá,Dutton, p. 47. and that more T√¢y S∆°n troops were being evacuated from Gia Dinh by their commander Dang Van Tran in order to aid Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c. Sensing T√¢y S∆°n vulnerability in the south, Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh assembled his forces at home and abroad in preparation for an immediate offensive. √Ånh secretly left Siam in the night, leaving a letter in his house, he decided to head for southern Vietnam by boat. As the Vietnamese refugees were preparing to leave, people nearby heard about it and reported it to Phraya Phrakhlang. Phraya Phrakhlang reported it to King Rama I and the Front Palace Maha Sura Singhanat. Sura Singhanat was extremely angry, he chased them personally. At dawn, Sura Singhanat saw √Ånh's boat at the mouth of the bay. Finally, the Vietnamese escaped successfully. √Ånh arrived at H√† Ti√™n then to Long Xuy√™n (C√† Mau), but he failed in his first attempt to recapture Gia Dinh, having failed to convince the local warlord in the Mekong Delta, Vo Tanh to join his assault.Choi, p. 27. The following year, Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh finally managed to persuade the warlord to join him but after having given his sister to the warlord as a concubine. He eventually succeeded in taking M·ªπ Tho, made it the main staging point for his operations, and rebuilt his army. After a hard- fought battle, his soldiers captured Saigon on 7 September 1788. Eventually, Pigneau assembled four vessels to sail to Vietnam from Pondicherry, arriving in Saigon on 24 July 1789.Hall, p. 429-430. The combined forces helped to consolidate Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh's hold on southern Vietnam.Hall, p. 430.Buttinger, pp. 239-240. The exact magnitude of foreign aid and the importance of their contribution to Gia Long's success is a point of dispute. Earlier scholars asserted that up to 400 Frenchmen enlisted,Buttinger, p. 266. but more recent work has claimed that less than 100 soldiers were present, along with approximately a dozen officers.McLeod, p. 11.Mantienne, p. 521. Consolidation of southern Vietnam After more than a decade of conflict, Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh had finally managed to gain control of Saigon for long enough to have time to start a permanent base in the area, and prepare to build up for a decisive power struggle with the T√¢y S∆°n. The area around Saigon, known as Gia Dinh, began to be referred to as its own region, because Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh's presence was becoming entrenched, distinguishing and associating the area with a political base. Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh's military was able to consolidate, and a civil service was reestablished.Choi, p. 21. According to the historian Keith Taylor, this was the first time that the southern third of Vietnam was integrated \\"as a region capable of participating successfully in war and politics among Vietnamese speakers\\", which could \\"compete for ascendancy with all the other places inhabited by speakers of the Vietnamese language\\". A Council of High Officials consisting of military and civil officials was created in 1788, as was a tax collection system. In the same year, regulations were passed to force half the male population of Gia Dinh to serve as conscripts, and two years later, a system of military colonies was implemented to bolster the Nguy·ªÖn support base across all racial groups, including ethnic Khmers and Chinese.Choi, pp. 21-22. The French officers enlisted by Pigneau helped to train Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh's armed forces and introduced Western technological expertise to the war effort. The navy was trained by Jean-Marie Dayot, who supervised the construction of bronze-plated naval vessels. Olivier de Puymanel was responsible for training the army and the construction of fortifications.Cady, p. 284. He introduced European infantry training, formations and tactics while also facilitating various methods of manufacturing and using European-style artillery, thereby making cannonry and projectiles a central part of the military. Pigneau and other missionaries acted as business agents for Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh, purchasing munitions and other military mat√©riel. Pigneau also served as an advisor and de facto foreign minister until his death in 1799.Hall, p. 431. Upon Pigneau's death, Gia Long's funeral oration described the Frenchman as \\"the most illustrious foreigner ever to appear at the court of Cochinchina\\".Buttinger, p. 267. Pigneau was buried in the presence of the crown prince, all mandarins of the court, the royal bodyguard of 12,000 men and 40,000 mourners.Karnow, p. 78. Fortifications Layout of the original citadel. Following the recapture of Saigon, Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh consolidated his power base and prepared the destruction of the T√¢y S∆°n. His enemies had regularly raided the south and looted the annual rice harvests, so Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh was keen to strengthen his defenCE. One of Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh's first actions was to ask the French officers to design and supervise the construction of a modern European-style citadel in Saigon. The citadel was designed by Theodore Lebrun and de Puymanel, with 30,000 people mobilized for its construction in 1790. The townsfolk and the mandarins were punitively taxed for the work and the labourers were so over-worked that they revolted. When finished, the stone citadel had a perimeter measuring 4,176 meters in a Vauban model.Mantienne, p. 522. The fortress was bordered on three sides by pre-existing waterways, bolstering its natural defensive capability.Mantienne, p. 524. Following the construction of the citadel, the T√¢y S∆°n never again attempted to sail down the Saigon River and try to recapture the city, its presence having endowed Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh with a substantial psychological advantage over his opponents.Mantienne, p. 525. Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh took a keen personal interest in fortifications, ordering his French advisors to travel home and bring back books with the latest scientific and technical studies on the subject.Mantienne, p. 527. The Nguy·ªÖn royal palace was built inside the citadel.Choi, p. 22. Agicultural reform and economic growth With the southern region secured, Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh turned his attention to agricultural reforms.McLeod, p. 8. Due to T√¢y S∆°n naval raids on the rice crop via inland waterways, the area suffered chronic rice shortages.Mantienne, p. 530. Although the land was extremely fertile, the region was agriculturally underexploited, having been occupied by Vietnamese settlers only relatively recently. Furthermore, agricultural activities had also been significantly curtailed during the extended warfare with the T√¢y S∆°n. Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh's agricultural reforms were based around extending to the south a traditional form of agrarian expansion, the ƒë·ªìn ƒëi·ªÅn, which roughly translates as \\"military settlement\\" or \\"military holding\\", the emphasis being on the military origin of this form of colonization. These were first used during the 15th century reign of L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng in the southward expansion of Vietnam. The central government supplied military units with agricultural tools and grain for nourishment and planting. The soldiers were then assigned land to defend, clear and cultivate, and had to pay some of their harvest as tax. In the past, a military presence was required because the land had been seized from the conquered indigenous population. Under Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh's rule, pacification was not usually needed but the basic model remained intact. Settlers were granted fallow land, given agricultural equipment, work animals and grain. After several years, they were required to pay grain tax. The program greatly reduced the amount of idle, uncultivated land. Large surpluses of grain, taxable by the state, soon resulted. By 1800, the increased agricultural productivity had allowed Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh to support a sizeable army of more than 30,000 soldiers and a navy of more than 1,200 vessels. The surplus from the state granary was sold to European and Asian traders to facilitate the importation of raw materials for military purposes, in particular iron, bronze, and sulfur. The government also purchased caster sugar from local farmers and traded it for weapons from European manufacturers. The food surplus allowed Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh to engage in welfare initiatives that improved morale and loyalty among his subjects, thereby increasing his support base. The surplus grain was deposited in granaries built along the northward route out of Saigon, following the advance of the Nguy·ªÖn army into T√¢y S∆°n territory. This allowed his troops to be fed from southern supplies, rather than eating from the areas that he was attempting to conquer or win over. Newly acquired regions were given tax exemptions, and surrendered T√¢y S∆°n mandarins were appointed to equivalent positions with the same salaries in the Nguy·ªÖn administration. Naval buildup The French Navy officer Jean- Baptiste Chaigneau served Emperor Gia Long. Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh used his new Chu Su Naval workshop to improve his inferior navy, which was much smaller than the T√¢y S∆°n fleet and hitherto unable to prevent their rice raids. Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh had first attempted to acquire modern naval vessels in 1781, when on the advice of Pigneau, he had chartered Portuguese vessels of European design, complete with crew and artillery. This initial experience proved to be disastrous. For reasons that remain unclear, two of the vessels fled in the midst of battle against the T√¢y S∆°n, while angry Vietnamese soldiers killed the third crew. In 1789, Pigneau returned to Vietnam from Pondicherry with two vessels, which stayed in the Nguy·ªÖn service long-term. Over time, Vietnamese sailors replaced the original French and Indian crew under the command of French officers. These vessels became the foundation for an expanded military and merchant Nguyen naval force, with Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh chartering and purchasing more European vessels to reinforce Vietnamese-built ships. However, traditional Vietnamese- style galleys and small sailing ships remained the mainstay of the fleet. By 1794, two European vessels were operating together with 200 Vietnamese boats against the T√¢y S∆°n near Qui Nh∆°n. In 1799, a British trader by the name of Berry reported that the Nguy·ªÖn fleet had departed Saigon along the Saigon River with 100 galleys, 40 junks, 200 smaller boats and 800 carriers, accompanied by three European sloops. In 1801, one naval division was reported to have included nine European vessels armed with 60 guns, five vessels with 50 guns, 40 with 16 guns, 100 junks, 119 galleys and 365 smaller boats. Most of the European-style vessels were built in the shipyard that Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh had commissioned in Saigon. He took a deep personal interest in the naval program, directly supervising the work and spending several hours a day at the dockside. One witness noted \\"One principal tendency of his ambition is to naval science, as a proof of this he has been heard to say he would build ships of the line on the European plan.\\"Mantienne, p. 531. By 1792, fifteen frigates were under construction, with a design that mixed Chinese and European specifications, equipped with 14 guns. The Vietnamese learned European naval architecture by dismantling an old European vessel into its components, so that Vietnamese shipbuilders could understand the separate facets of European shipbuilding, before reassembling it. They then applied their newfound knowledge to create replicas of the boats. Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh studied naval carpentry techniques and was said to be adept at it, and learned navigational theory from the French books that Pigneau translated, particularly Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert's Encyclop√©die. The Saigon shipyard was widely praised by European travelers. Despite his extensive reliance on French officers in matters of military technology, Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh limited his inner military circle to loyal Vietnamese. The Frenchmen decried his refusal to take their tactical advice. Chaigneau reported that the Europeans continually urged Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh to take the initiative and launch bold attacks against T√¢y S∆°n installations. Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh refused, preferring to proceed slowly, consolidating his gains in one area and strengthening his economic and military base, before attacking another. In the first four years after establishing himself in Saigon in 1788, Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh focused on tightening his grip on the Gia Dinh area and its productive rice paddies, and although his forces exerted a degree on control over areas to the north such as Khanh Hoa, Phu Yen and Binh Thuan, their main presence in the northern areas were mainly through naval forces and not concentrated on land occupation. This was because those areas were not very fertile in terms of rice production and were often affected by famines, and occupying the land would have meant an obligation to feed the populace, putting a strain on resources.Choi, pp. 22-23. During this four-year period, Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh sent missions to Siam, Cambodia and south to the Straits of Malacca and purchased more European military equipment.Choi, p. 23. Over time, Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh gradually reduced the military role of his French allies on the battlefield. In the naval battle at Thi Nai in 1792, Dayot led the Nguy·ªÖn naval attack, but by 1801, a seaborne offensive in the same area was led by the Nguyen Van Truong, Vo Duy Nguy and L√™ VƒÉn Duy·ªát, with Chaigneau, Vannier, and de Forsans in supporting positions. The infantry attack on Qui Nh∆°n in 1793 was conducted, according to Nguyen historiography, in cooperation with \\"Western soldiers\\". The same source recorded that by 1801, Nguyen operations in the same area were directed by Vietnamese generals, whereas Chaigneau and Vannier were responsible for organizing supply lines. Unification of Vietnam Vietnamese \\"Tirailleur\\" soldiers of the Nguy·ªÖn dynasty In 1792, the middle and the most notable of the three T√¢y S∆°n brothers, Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá Quang Trung, who had gained recognition as Emperor of Vietnam by driving the L√™ dynasty and China out of northern Vietnam, died suddenly. Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh took advantage of the situation and attacked northwards. By now, the majority of the original French soldiers, whose number peaked at less than 80 by some estimates, had departed. The majority of the fighting occurred in and around the coastal towns of Nha Trang in central Vietnam and Qui Nh∆°n further to the north in B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province, the birthplace and stronghold of the T√¢y S∆°n. Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh began by deploying his expanded and modernised naval fleet in raids against coastal T√¢y S∆°n territory. His fleet left Saigon and sailed northward on an annual basis during June and July, carried by southwesterly winds. The naval offensives were reinforced by infantry campaigns. His fleet would then return south when the monsoon ended, on the back of northeasterly winds. The large European wind-powered vessels gave the Nguy·ªÖn navy a commanding artillery advantage, as they had a superior range to the T√¢y S∆°n cannons on the coast. Combined with traditional galleys and a crew that was highly regarded for its discipline, skill and bravery,Mantienne, p. 532. the European-style vessels in the Nguy·ªÖn fleet inflicted hundreds of losses against the T√¢y S∆°n in 1792 and 1793. In 1794, after a successful campaign in the Nha Trang region, Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh ordered de Puymanel to build a citadel at Duyen Khanh, near the city, instead of retreating south with the seasonal northeasterly breeze. A Nguyen garrison was established there under the command of Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh's eldest son and heir, Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c C·∫£nh, assisted by Pigneau and de Puymanel. The T√¢y S∆°n laid siege to Duyen Khanh in May 1794, but Nguyen forces were able to keep them out. Shortly after the siege ended, reinforcements arrived from Saigon and offensive operations against the T√¢y S∆°n duly resumed. The campaign was the first time that the Nguy·ªÖn were able to operate in T√¢y S∆°n heartland during an unfavorable season. The defensive success of the citadel was a powerful psychological victory for the Nguy·ªÖn, demonstrating their ability to penetrate T√¢y S∆°n territory at any time of the year. The Nguy·ªÖn then proceeded to slowly erode the T√¢y S∆°n heartland. Heavy fighting occurred at the fortress of Qui Nh∆°n until it was captured in 1799 by Nguyen Canh's forces. However, the city was quickly lost and was not regained until 1801. The superior firepower of the improved navy played the decisive role in the ultimate recapture of the city, supporting a large overland attack. With the capture of their stronghold at Qui Nh∆°n, the vanquishing of the T√¢y S∆°n was inevitable. In June, the central city of Hu·∫ø, the former capital of the Nguy·ªÖn, fell and Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh crowned himself emperor, under the reign name Gia Long, which was derived from Gia ƒê·ªãnh (Saigon) and ThƒÉng Long (Hanoi) to symbolize the unification of northern and southern Vietnam.Tarling, p. 245. He then quickly overran the north, with Hanoi captured on 22 July 1802.Buttinger, p. 241. After a quarter- century of continuous fighting, Gia Long had unified these formerly fractious territorie, ultimately leading what is now modern Vietnam and elevated his family to a position never previously occupied by any Vietnamese royalty. Vietnam had never before occupied a larger landmass. Gia Long became the first Vietnamese ruler to reign over territory stretching from China in the north, all the way to the Gulf of Siam and the C√† Mau peninsula in the south. Gia Long's then petitioned the Qing dynasty of China for official recognition, which was promptly granted.Buttinger, p. 270. The French failure to honor the treaty signed by Pigneau meant Vietnam was not bound to cede the territory and trading rights that they had promised.McLeod, pp. 11-12. Due to a T√¢y S∆°n massacre of ethnic Chinese, the Nguy·ªÖn were subsequently supported by most ethnic Chinese against the T√¢y S∆°n.Choi, p. 35. The T√¢y S∆°n's downfall and defeat at the hands of Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c √Ånh was therefore due, at least in part, to the ethnic Chinese support given the Nguy·ªÖn.Choi, p. 74. Rule Gia Long's rule was noted for its strict Confucian orthodoxy.Buttinger, p. 240. Upon toppling the T√¢y S∆°n, he repealed their reforms and reimposed classical Confucian education and civil service systems. He moved the capital from Hanoi in the north to Hu·∫ø in central Vietnam to reflect the southward migration of the population over the preceding centuries. The Emperor built new fortresses and a palace in his new capital. Using French expertise, Gia Long modernized Vietnam's defensive capabilities and, in recognition of the assistance of his French friends, he permitted the activities of Catholic missionaries, something, however, which was less tolerated by his successors. Under Gia Long's rule, Vietnam strengthened its military dominance in Indochina, expelling Siam from Cambodia and turning it into a vassal state. Despite this, he was relatively isolationist in outlook towards European powers. Renaming Vietnam Gia Long decided to join the Imperial Chinese Tributary System. He sent an embassy to Qing China, and requested to change his country's name to Nam Vi·ªát (ÂçóË∂ä).Woodside, p. 120. Gia Long explained that the word Nam Vi·ªát derivated from An Nam (ÂÆâÂçó) and Vi·ªát Th∆∞·ªùng (Ë∂äË£≥), two toponyms mentioned in ancient Chinese records where located in northern and southern Vietnam respectively, to symbolize the unification of the country. The Qing Jiaqing Emperor of China refused his request because it had identical name with the ancient kingdom Nam Vi·ªát (Nanyue), and the territory of Nam Vi·ªát contained Liangguang where belonged to Qing China in that time. Instead, Jiaqing agreed to change it to Vi·ªát Nam (Ë∂äÂçó).Tr·∫ßn Tr·ªçng Kim, Vi·ªát Nam s·ª≠ l∆∞·ª£c, /Quy·ªÉn II, C·∫≠n kim th·ªùi ƒë·∫°i, Ch∆∞∆°ng I Gia Long's ƒê·∫°i Nam th·ª±c l·ª•c contains the diplomatic correspondence over the naming. However, Gia Long copied the Imperial Chinese system, based on the Chinese Confucian model and attempting to create a Vietnamese Imperial tributary system. \\"Trung Qu·ªëc\\" (‰∏≠Âúã) was used as a name for Vietnam by Gia Long in 1805.Woodside, p. 18. It was said \\"H√°n di h·ªØu h·∫°n\\" (, \\"the Vietnamese and the barbarians must have clear borders\\") by the Gia Long Emperor (Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c √Ånh) when differentiating between Khmer and Vietnamese.Choi, p. 34. Minh M·∫°ng implemented an acculturation integration policy directed at minority non-Vietnamese peoples.Choi, p. 136. Thanh nh√¢n (Ê∏Ö‰∫∫) was used to refer to ethnic Chinese by the Vietnamese while Vietnamese called themselves as H√°n nh√¢n (Êº¢‰∫∫) in Vietnam during the 1800s under Nguy·ªÖn rule.Choi, p. 137. Administrative structure L√™ VƒÉn Duy·ªát, the longest- serving and the last military protector of the four provinces of Cochinchina During the war era, Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh had maintained an embryonic bureaucracy in an attempt to prove his leadership ability to the people. Due to the incessant warfare, military officers were generally the most prominent members of his inner circle.McLeod, p. 15. This dependency on military backing continued to manifest itself throughout his reign. Vietnam was divided into three administrative regions. The old patrimony of the Nguy·ªÖn formed the central part of the empire (v√πng Kinh K·ª≥), with nine provinces, five of which were directly ruled by Gia Long and his mandarins from Hu·∫ø. The central administration at Hu·∫ø was divided into six ministries: Public affairs, finance, rites, war, justice and public works. Each was under a minister, assisted by two deputies and two or three councillors. Each of these ministries had around 70 employees assigned to various units. The heads of these ministries formed the Supreme Council. A treasurer general and a Chief of the Judicial Service assisted a governor general, who was in charge of a number of provinces.Hall, p. 432. The provinces were classified into tr·∫•n and dinh. These were in turn divided into ph·ªß, huy·ªán and ch√¢u. All important matters were examined by the Supreme Council in the presence of Gia Long. The officials tabled their reports for discussion and decision-making. The bureaucrats involved in the Supreme Council were selected from the high- ranking mandarins of the six ministries and the academies. Gia Long handled the northern and southern regions of Vietnam cautiously, not wanting them to be jarred by rapid centralization after centuries of national division.McLeod, p. 3. Tonkin, with the administrative seat of its imperial military protector (quan t·ªïng tr·∫•n) at Hanoi, had thirteen provinces (t·ªïng tr·∫•n B·∫Øc Th√†nh), and in the Red River Delta, the old officials of the Le administration continued in office. In the south, Saigon was the capital of the four provinces of Cochinchina (t·ªïng tr·∫•n Nam H√†), as well as the seat of the military protector.McLeod, p. 16. The citadels in the respective cities directly administered their military defense zones. This system allowed Gia Long to reward his leading supporters with highly powerful positions, giving them almost total autonomy in ordinary administrative and legal matters. This system persisted until 1831-32, when his son Minh M·∫°ng centralized the national government. In his attempts to re-establish a stable administration after centuries of civil war, Gia Long was not regarded as being innovative, preferring the traditional administration framework.Buttinger, p. 278. When Gia Long unified the country, it was described by Charles Maybon as being chaotic: \\"The wheels of administration were warped or no longer existed; the cadres of officials were empty, the hierarchy destroyed; taxes were not being collected, lists of communal property had disappeared, proprietary titles were lost, fields abandoned; roads bridges and public granaries had not been maintained; work in the mines had ceased. The administration of justice had been interrupted, every province was a prey to pirates, and violation of law went unpunished, while even the law itself had become uncertain.\\" Foreign military relations During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Cambodian empire had been in decline and Vietnamese people migrated south into the Mekong Delta, which had previously been Khmer territory.Cady, p. 266. Furthermore, Cambodia had been periodically invaded by both Vietnam and Siam. Cambodia lurched uneasily between both poles of domination as dictated by the internal strife of her two larger neighbors.Hall, pp. 432-433. In 1796, Ang Eng, a pro- Siamese king had died, leaving Ang Chan, who was born in 1791.Hall, p. 433. When Gia Long unified Vietnam, Eng was given investiture by Siam in order to hold out Vietnamese influence, but in 1803, a Cambodian mission paid tribute to Vietnam in attempt to placate Gia Long, something that became an annual routine. In 1807, Ang Chan requested formal investiture as a vassal of Gia Long.Hall, p. 434. Gia Long responded by sending an ambassador bearing the book of investiture, together with a seal of gilded silver. In 1812, Ang Chan refused a request from his brother Ang Snguon to share power, leading to a rebellion. Siam sent troops to support the rebel prince, hoping to enthrone him and wrest influence from Gia Long over Cambodia. In 1813, Gia Long responded by sending a large military contingent that forced the Siamese and Ang Snguon out of Cambodia. As a result, a Vietnamese garrison was permanently installed in the citadel at Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital. Thereafter, Siam made no attempts to regain control of Cambodia during Gia Long's rule.Buttinger, p. 305. Napoleon's aims to conquer Vietnam as a base to challenge British supremacy in India never materialized,Buttinger, p. 272. having been preoccupied by vast military ambitions on mainland Europe. However, France remained the only European power with permanent spokesmen in Vietnam during his reign. Trade relations Pigneau's aborted deal with France allowed Gia Long to keep his country closed to western trade.Buttinger, pp. 270-271. Gia Long was generally dismissive of European commercial overtures.Buttinger, p. 271. This was part of a policy of trying to maintain friendly relations with every European power by granting favors to none.Buttinger, pp. 271-273. In 1804, a British delegation attempted to negotiate trading privileges with Vietnam. It was the only offer of its kind until 1822, such was the extent of European disinterest in Asia during the Napoleonic Wars. Gia Long had purchased arms from British firms in Madras and Calcutta on credit,Buttinger, p. 307. prompting the British East India Company to send John Roberts to Hu·∫ø. However, Roberts's gifts were turned away and the negotiations for a commercial deal never started. The United Kingdom then made a request for the exclusive right to trade with Vietnam and the cession of the island of Cham near Faifo, which was rejected, as were further approaches from the Netherlands. Both of these failed attempts were attributed to the influence of the French mandarins.Buttinger, p. 308. In 1817, the French Prime Minister Armand-Emmanuel du Plessis dispatched the Cybele, a frigate with 52 guns to Tourane (now Da Nang) to \\"show French sympathy and to assure Gia Long of the benevolence of the King of France\\". The captain of the vessel was turned away, ostensibly on grounds of protocol for not carrying a royal letter from the French king.Buttinger, p. 309. Gia Long kept four French officers in his service after his coronation: Philippe Vannier, Jean-Baptiste Chaigneau, de Forsans and the doctor Despiau. All became high ranking mandarins and were treated well. They were given 50 bodyguards each, ornate residences and were exempt for having to prostrate before the emperor. Recommendations from French officials in Pondicherry to Napoleon Bonaparte suggesting the re-establishment of diplomatic relations with Vietnam were fruitless due to the preoccupation with war in Europe. However, French merchants from Bordeaux were later able to begin trading with Vietnam after the further efforts of the Duc de Richelieu.Hall, p. 435. Domestic policies and capital works thumb Gia Long abolished all large landholding by princes, nobles and high officials. He dismantled the 800-year-old practice of paying officials and rewarding or endowing nobles with a portion of the taxes from a village or a group thereof.Buttinger, p. 279. Existing highways were repaired and new ones constructed, with the north‚Äìsouth road from Saigon to L·∫°ng S∆°n put under restoration.Buttinger, p. 312. He organised a postal service to operate along the highways and public storehouses were built to alleviate starvation in drought-affected years. Gia Long enacted monetary reform and implemented a more socialized agrarian policy. However, the population growth far outstripped that of land clearing and cultivation.Buttinger, p. 280. There was little emphasis on innovation in agricultural technology, so the improvements in productivity were mainly derived from increasing the amount of cultivated farmland.Buttinger, pp. 281-282. Although the civil war was over, Gia Long decided to add to the two citadels that had been built under the supervision of French officers. Gia Long was convinced of their effectiveness and during his 18-year reign, a further 11 citadels were built throughout the country. The majority were built in the Vauban style, with pentagonal or hexagonal geometry, while a minority, including the one in Hu·∫ø, were built in a four- sided traditional Chinese design. The fortresses were built at Vinh, Thanh H√≥a, B·∫Øc Ninh, H√† Tƒ©nh, Th√°i Nguy√™n and H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng in the north, Hu·∫ø, Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i, Kh√°nh H√≤a and B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh in the centre, and Vƒ©nh Long in the Mekong Delta. Construction was at its most intense in the early phase of Gia Long's reign, only one of the 11 was built in the last six years of his rule.Mantienne, p. 526. De Puymanel and Lebrun left Vietnam before the end of the war, so the forts were designed by Vietnamese engineers who oversaw the construction. The position of Citadel Supervision Officer was created under the Ministry of War and made responsible for the work, underlining the importance that Gia Long placed on fortifications.Mantienne, p. 528. Gia Long's fortifications program was marred by accusations that the people labored all day and part of the night in all weather conditions,Buttinger, pp. 281, 316. and that as a direct consequence, land went fallow. Complaints of mandarin corruption and oppressive taxation were often levelled at his government. Following his coronation, Gia Long drastically reduced his naval fleet and by the 1810s, only two of the European-style vessels were still in service. The downsizing of the navy was mainly attributed to budgetary constraints caused by heavy spending on fortifications and transport infrastructure such as roads, dykes and canals. However, in 1819, a new phase of shipbuilding was launched, with Gia Long personally supervising the dockyards. Social policy In order to train and recruit government officials, Gia Long revived the Confucian court examinations that had been abolished by the T√¢y S∆°n. In 1803, he founded the National Academy (Qu·ªëc T·ª≠ Gi√°m) at Hu·∫ø. Its objective was to educate the sons of mandarins and meritorious students in Confucian classical literature. In 1804, Gia Long promulgated edicts establishing similar schools in the provinces, as well as guidelines to regulate their staff and curriculum. He appointed Directors of Education (quan ƒë·ªëc h·ªçc) to oversee the provincial education system and the selection process for the entrance examinations to the National Academy, beginning in 1802. The Directors were assisted by Subordinate and Assistant Directors (ph√≥ ƒë·ªëc h·ªçc or tr·ª£-gi√°o). Gia Long explained to his court in 1814 that the goal was to create a cadre of classically educated, politically loyal administrators: In 1807, Gia Long opened the first civil service examinations held under the Nguy·ªÖn dynasty, staged at regional level. From then on, the training and selection process for the imperial bureaucracy was largely centered on examinations. The curriculum for the examinations consisted of the Four Books and Five Classics, which focused on Chinese history leading up to the Song dynasty, while regarding other knowledge as irrelevant.McLeod, p. 17. Gia Long promulgated a new legal code to replace the system that had existed since the Hong Duc era of L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng in the 15th century. Work started in 1811 under a group of scholars led by Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Th√†nh, and in 1815, the B·ªô lu·∫≠t Gia Long (Gia Long Code) was issued. Although Gia Long claimed that his new system was a mixture of the Le code and Qing dynasty system of China, most scholars regard it as being a near complete copy of the Qing code. The code was later translated into French by Paul-Louis-F√©lix Philastre.Buttinger, p. 314. It focused on strengthening the power and authority of the emperor, his mandarins, and the traditional family unit. In cases of serious crimes, particularly those against the state, collective punishment was meted out to the family of the convict, including the death penalty.McLeod, p. 18. thumb Now that Vietnam was unified, the center of gravity of the country moved further south, following centuries of southerly migration and conquest, so Gia Long moved the seat of government from Hanoi to Hu·∫ø. Gia Long rebuilt the old citadel of Ph√∫ Xu√¢n into a fortress stronghold.Ring, Salkin and La Boda, p. 364. The structure was a square shape of 2.5 km per side.Cady, p. 408. A 9 m rampart was encased with masonry and protected by protruding bastions, each defended by 36 guns. The exterior and interior were flanked and reinforced by a series of moats. The citadel's defenders included an 800-strong elephant troop. The new palace structure, protocol and court dress were all taken directly from Qing dynasty styles, and his palace and fortress was intended to be a smaller copy of the Chinese Forbidden City in the 1800s.Woodside, pp. 126-130. Gia Long tolerated the Catholic faith of his French allies and permitted unimpeded missionary activities out of respect to his benefactors.Buttinger, pp. 241, 311. The missionary activity was dominated by the Spanish in Tonkin and French in the central and southern regions. At the time of his death, there were six European bishops in Vietnam. The population of Christians was estimated at 300,000 in Tonkin and 60,000 in Cochinchina.Cady, p. 409. However, he expressed dismay at the Catholic condemnation of the traditional ancestor worship, a basic tenet of Vietnamese culture.Buttinger, pp. 310, 262. Gia Long was also known for his disdain for Buddhism, the religion practiced by the majority of the population. Despite its popularity among ladies of the court, Gia Long often restricted the activities of Buddhists.Buttinger, p. 310. In August 1802, Gia Long retaliated against the captured T√¢y S∆°n leadership who had executed his family in the 1770s. The surviving members of the family and its leading generals and their families were executed.Buttinger, pp. 235, 266. The remains of Quang Trung and his queen were exhumed and desecrated, and his son, the last T√¢y S∆°n monarch Quang To·∫£n was bound to four elephants and torn apart. Gia Long repealed the changes enacted by Quang Trung and reverted to the prior Confucian orthodoxy. This included restoring the civil service to the forefront of decision making, ahead of the army, and reversed Quang Trung's education reforms, which put science before the study of Confucian literature.Buttinger, p. 265. Family and succession Minh M·∫°ng, Gia Long's fourth son and successor. Gia Long had many wives, but the most famous consorts are Empress Th·ª´a Thi√™n, Empress Thu·∫≠n Thi√™n, and Consort L√™ Ng·ªçc B√¨nh. In 1780, during the war against the T√¢y S∆°n, he married T·ªëng Th·ªã Lan, the daughter of a Nguyen general. She bore him two sons, the first being Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c Chi√™u, who died shortly after birth in Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc island, and later Crown Prince Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c C·∫£nh. Following Gia Long's ascension to the throne, she became Empress consort and was given the title of Empress Th·ª´a Thi√™n posthumously. Around 1781, during the war with the T√¢y S∆°n, he married his second wife Tr·∫ßn Th·ªã ƒêang, a daughter of one of his ministers. She bore him three sons, Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c ƒê·∫£m, Nguyen Phuc Dai and Nguyen Phuc Chan, and was posthumously given the title of Empress Thu·∫≠n Thi√™n. After his conquest of Vietnam, Gia Long, took his third wife, L√™ Ng·ªçc B√¨nh. A daughter of L√™ Hi·ªÉn T√¥ng, the second-last emperor of the L√™ dynasty, she was betrothed by Emperor Quang Trung to his son Quang To·∫£n. After Gia Long defeated the T√¢y S∆°n and executed Quang Toan, he took her as his wife. Gia Long had almost 100 concubines who were daughters of his mandarins; Gia Long did not favor polygamy but he did so to secure the loyalty of his inner circle. As Crown Prince Nguyen Canh had died of smallpox during the war against the T√¢y S∆°n, it was assumed that Canh's son would succeed Gia Long as emperor, but in 1816 Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c ƒê·∫£m, the son of his second wife, was appointed instead, and ruled as Minh M·∫°ng.Buttinger, p. 268. Gia Long chose him for his strong character and his deep aversion to westerners, whereas Canh's lineage had converted to Catholicism and were reluctant to maintain their Confucian traditions such as ancestor worship. Before his accession, Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c ƒê·∫£m was reported to have praised the Japanese for having expelled and eradicated Christianity from their country.Buttinger, p. 269. Gia Long told his son to treat the Europeans respectfully, especially the French, but not to grant them any position of preponderance. Gia Long died on 3 February 1820 and was buried at the Thien Tho Tomb and posthumously named Th·∫ø T·ªï Cao Ho√†ng ƒë·∫ø.Duiker, p. 60Kim, p. 416.

A refractometer is the instrument used to measure refractive index (\\"RI\\"). Although refractometers are best known for measuring liquids, they are also used to measure gases and solids; such as glass and gemstones. The RI of a substance is strongly influenced by temperature and the wavelength of light used to measure it, therefore, care must be taken to control or compensate for temperature differences and wavelength. RI measurements are usually reported at a reference temperature of 20 degrees Celsius, which is equal to 68 degrees Fahrenheit, and considered to be room temperature. A reference wavelength of 589.3 nm (the sodium D line) is most often used. Though RI is a dimensionless quantity, it is typically reported as nD20 (or n), where the \\"n\\" represents refractive index, the \\"D\\" denotes the wavelength, and the 20 denotes the reference temperature. Therefore, the refractive index of water at 20 degrees Celsius, taken at the Sodium D Line, would be reported as 1.3330 nD20. Refractometers are frequently used by grape growers and kiwifruit growers for Brix testing of sucrose levels in their fruit. Refractometry is also used in the gelatin industry. To convert the RI of a gelatin sol (reported in Brix) to a gelatin concentration, one need only multiply by eight-tenths (0.8). A sol with a 10.0 RI would therefore be 8% gelatin by weight. This is known to be a reliable conversion for gelatin sols as low as 1% up to over 50%. Types of refractometers There are four main types of fluid refractometers: traditional handheld refractometers, digital handheld refractometers, Abbe refractometers, and inline process refractometers.

Typical cyclic voltammogram where i_{pc} and i_{pa} show the peak cathodic and anodic current respectively for a reversible reaction. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is a type of potentiodynamic electrochemical measurement. In a cyclic voltammetry experiment, the working electrode potential is ramped linearly versus time. Unlike in linear sweep voltammetry, after the set potential is reached in a CV experiment, the working electrode's potential is ramped in the opposite direction to return to the initial potential. These cycles of ramps in potential may be repeated as many times as needed. The current at the working electrode is plotted versus the applied voltage (that is, the working electrode's potential) to give the cyclic voltammogram trace. Cyclic voltammetry is generally used to study the electrochemical properties of an analyte in solution or of a molecule that is adsorbed onto the electrode.  Experimental method  Figure 2. Cyclic voltammetry waveform. In cyclic voltammetry, the electrode potential ramps linearly versus time in cyclical phases (Figure 2). The rate of voltage change over time during each of these phases is known as the experiment's scan rate (V/s). The potential is measured between the working electrode and the reference electrode, while the current is measured between the working electrode and the counter electrode. These data are plotted as current (i) versus applied potential (E, often referred to as just 'potential'). In Figure 2, during the initial forward scan (from t0 to t1) an increasingly reducing potential is applied; thus the cathodic current will, at least initially, increase over this time period assuming that there are reducible analytes in the system. At some point after the reduction potential of the analyte is reached, the cathodic current will decrease as the concentration of reducible analyte is depleted. If the redox couple is reversible then during the reverse scan (from t1 to t2) the reduced analyte will start to be re-oxidized, giving rise to a current of reverse polarity (anodic current) to before. The more reversible the redox couple is, the more similar the oxidation peak will be in shape to the reduction peak. Hence, CV data can provide information about redox potentials and electrochemical reaction rates. For instance, if the electron transfer at the working electrode surface is fast and the current is limited by the diffusion of analyte species to the electrode surface, then the peak current will be proportional to the square root of the scan rate. This relationship is described by the Randles‚ÄìSevcik equation. In this situation, the CV experiment only samples a small portion of the solution, i.e., the diffusion layer at the electrode surface.  Characterization  The utility of cyclic voltammetry is highly dependent on the analyte being studied. The analyte has to be redox active within the potential window to be scanned. The analyte is in solution Reversible couples Potential against time, current against time and voltammogram (current against potential) for a one-electron, reversible redox couple diffusing freely in solution. The current density is normalised by 0.446 F C sqrt(D F nu / R T). Reductive current counted as negative. Often the analyte displays a reversible CV wave (such as that depicted in Figure 1), which is observed when all of the initial analyte can be recovered after a forward and reverse scan cycle. Although such reversible couples are simpler to analyze, they contain less information than more complex waveforms. The waveform of even reversible couples is complex owing to the combined effects of polarization and diffusion. The difference between the two peak potentials (Ep), ŒîEp, is of particular interest. : ŒîEp = Epa \\\\- Epc > 0 This difference mainly results from the effects of analyte diffusion rates. In the ideal case of a reversible 1e- couple, ŒîEp is 57 mV and the full-width half-max of the forward scan peak is 59 mV. Typical values observed experimentally are greater, often approaching 70 or 80 mV. The waveform is also affected by the rate of electron transfer, usually discussed as the activation barrier for electron transfer. A theoretical description of polarization overpotential is in part described by the Butler‚ÄìVolmer equation and Cottrell equation equations. In an ideal system the relationships reduces to E_{pa}-E_{pc}=\\\\frac{56.5\\\\text{ mV}}{n} for an n electron process. Focusing on current, reversible couples are characterized by ipa/ipc = 1. When a reversible peak is observed, thermodynamic information in the form of a half cell potential E01/2 can be determined. When waves are semi-reversible (ipa/ipc is close but not equal to 1), it may be possible to determine even more specific information (see electrochemical reaction mechanism). Nonreversible couples Many redox processes observed by CV are quasi- reversible or non-reversible. In such cases the thermodynamic potential E01/2 is often deduced by simulation. The irreversibility is indicated by ipa/ipc ‚â† 1. Deviations from unity are attributable to a subsequent chemical reaction that is triggered by the electron transfer. Such EC processes can be complex, involving isomerization, dissociation, association, etc.http://www.currentseparations.com/issues/18-1/cs18-1b.pdf  The analyte is adsorbed onto the electrode surface  Adsorbed species give simple voltammetric responses: ideally, at slow scan rates, there is no peak separation, the peak width is 90mV for a one-electron redox couple, and the peak current and peak area are proportional to scan rate (observing that the peak current is proportional to scan rate proves that the redox species that gives the peak is actually immobilised). The effect of increasing the scan rate can be used to measure the rate of interfacial electron transfer and/or the rates of reactions that are coupled to electron transfer. This technique has been useful to study redox proteins, some of which readily adsorb on various electrode materials, but the theory for biological and non-biological redox molecules is the same (see the page about protein film voltammetry).  Experimental setup  CV experiments are conducted on a solution in a cell fitted with electrodes. The solution consists of the solvent, in which is dissolved electrolyte and the species to be studied.Faulkner, L. R., \\"Understanding electrochemistry: Some distinctive concepts\\", Journal of Chemical Education 1983, 60, 262. The cell A standard CV experiment employs a cell fitted with three electrodes: reference electrode, working electrode, and counter electrode. This combination is sometimes referred to as a three-electrode setup. Electrolyte is usually added to the sample solution to ensure sufficient conductivity. The solvent, electrolyte, and material composition of the working electrode will determine the potential range that can be accessed during the experiment. The electrodes are immobile and sit in unstirred solutions during cyclic voltammetry. This \\"still\\" solution method gives rise to cyclic voltammetry's characteristic diffusion-controlled peaks. This method also allows a portion of the analyte to remain after reduction or oxidation so that it may display further redox activity. Stirring the solution between cyclic voltammetry traces is important in order to supply the electrode surface with fresh analyte for each new experiment. The solubility of an analyte can change drastically with its overall charge; as such it is common for reduced or oxidized analyte species to precipitate out onto the electrode. This layering of analyte can insulate the electrode surface, display its own redox activity in subsequent scans, or otherwise alter the electrode surface in a way that affects the CV measurements. For this reason it is often necessary to clean the electrodes between scans. Common materials for the working electrode include glassy carbon, platinum, and gold. These electrodes are generally encased in a rod of inert insulator with a disk exposed at one end. A regular working electrode has a radius within an order of magnitude of 1 mm. Having a controlled surface area with a well-defined shape is necessary for being able to interpret cyclic voltammetry results. To run cyclic voltammetry experiments at very high scan rates a regular working electrode is insufficient. High scan rates create peaks with large currents and increased resistances, which result in distortions. Ultramicroelectrodes can be used to minimize the current and resistance. The counter electrode, also known as the auxiliary or second electrode, can be any material that conducts current easily, will not react with the bulk solution, and has a surface area much larger than the working electrode. Common choices are platinum and graphite. Reactions occurring at the counter electrode surface are unimportant as long as it continues to conduct current well. To maintain the observed current the counter electrode will often oxidize or reduce the solvent or bulk electrolyte. Solvents CV can be conducted using a variety of solutions. Solvent choice for cyclic voltammetry takes into account several requirements. The solvent must dissolve the analyte and high concentrations of the supporting electrolyte. It must also be stable in the potential window of the experiment with respect to the working electrode. It must not react with either the analyte or the supporting electrolyte. It must be pure to prevent interference. Electrolyte The electrolyte ensures good electrical conductivity and minimizes iR drop such that the recorded potentials correspond to actual potentials. For aqueous solutions, many electrolytes are available, but typical ones are alkali metal salts of perchlorate and nitrate. In nonaqueous solvents, the range of electrolytes is more limited, and a popular choice is tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate.Geiger, W. E.; Barriere, F., \\"Organometallic Electrochemistry Based on Electrolytes Containing Weakly-Coordinating Fluoroarylborate Anions\\", Accounts of Chemical Research 2010, volume 43, pp. 1030-1039.  Related potentiometric techniques  Potentiodynamic techniques also exist that add low-amplitude AC perturbations to a potential ramp and measure variable response in a single frequency (AC voltammetry) or in many frequencies simultaneously (potentiodynamic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy). The response in alternating current is two-dimensional, characterized by both amplitude and phase. These data can be analyzed to determine information about different chemical processes (charge transfer, diffusion, double layer charging, etc.). Frequency response analysis enables simultaneous monitoring of the various processes that contribute to the potentiodynamic AC response of an electrochemical system. Whereas cyclic voltammetry is not a hydrodynamic technique, useful electrochemical methods are. In such cases, flow is achieved at the electrode surface by stirring the solution, pumping the solution, or rotating the electrode as is the case with rotating disk electrodes and rotating ring-disk electrodes. Such techniques target steady state conditions and produce waveforms that appear the same when scanned in either the positive or negative directions, thus limiting them to linear sweep voltammetry.  Applications  Cyclic voltammetry (CV) has become an important and widely used electroanalytical technique in many areas of chemistry. It is often used to study a variety of redox processes, to determine the stability of reaction products, the presence of intermediates in redox reactions, electron transfer kinetics, and the reversibility of a reaction. CV can also be used to determine the electron stoichiometry of a system, the diffusion coefficient of an analyte, and the formal reduction potential of an analyte, which can be used as an identification tool. In addition, because concentration is proportional to current in a reversible, Nernstian system, the concentration of an unknown solution can be determined by generating a calibration curve of current vs. concentration. In cellular biology it is used to measure the concentrations in living organisms. In organometallic chemistry, it is used to evaluate redox mechanisms.Geiger, W. E., \\"Reflections on Future Directions in Organometallic Electrochemistry\\", Organometallics 2011, volume 30, pp. 28-31.  Measuring antioxidant capacity  Cyclical voltammetry can be used to determine the antioxidant capacity in food and even skin.Kohen, Ron, et.al. Overall low molecular weight antioxidant activity of biological fluids and tissues by cyclic voltammetry.Methods Enzymol. 1999;300:285-96.Chevion, Shlomit, and Mordechai Chevion. \\"Antioxidant status and human health: Use of cyclic voltammetry for the evaluation of the antioxidant capacity of plasma and of edible plants.\\" Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 899.1 (2000): 308-325. Low molecular weight antioxidants, molecules that prevent other molecules from being oxidized by acting as reducing agents, are important in living cells because they inhibit cell damage or death caused by oxidation reactions that produce radicals.Sochor, Jiri, et al. \\"Electrochemistry as a tool for studying antioxidant properties.\\" Int. J. Electrochem. Sci 8 (2013): 8464-8489. Examples of antioxidants include flavonoids, whose antioxidant activity is greatly increased with more hydroxyl groups.Firuzi, Omidreza, et al. \\"Evaluation of the antioxidant activity of flavonoids by ‚Äúferric reducing antioxidant power‚Äù assay and cyclic voltammetry.\\" Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - General Subjects 1721.1 (2005): 174-184. Because traditional methods to determine antioxidant capacity involve tedious steps, techniques to increase the rate of the experiment are continually being researched. One such technique involves cyclic voltammetry because it can measure the antioxidant capacity by quickly measuring the redox behavior over a complex system without the need to measure each component's antioxidant capacity.Kohen, R. Vellaichamy E, Hrbac J, Gati I, Tirosh O.Quantification of the overall reactive oxygen species scavenging capacity of biological fluids and tissues. Free Radic Biol Med. 2000 Mar 15;28(6):871-9.Brcanovic, Jelena M., et al. \\"Cyclic Voltammetric Determination of Antioxidant Capacity of Cocoa Powder, Dark Chocolate and Milk Chocolate Samples: Correlation with Spectrophotometric Assays and Individual Phenolic Compounds.\\" Food Technology and Biotechnology 51.4 (2013): 460-470. Furthermore, antioxidants are quickly oxidized at inert electrodes, so the half-wave potential can be utilized to determine antioxidant capacity.Masek, Anna, et al. \\"Characteristics of compounds in hops using cyclic voltammetry, UV‚ÄìVIS, FTIR and GC‚ÄìMS analysis.\\" Food chemistry 156 (2014): 353-361. It is important to note that whenever cyclic voltammetry is utilized, it is usually compared to spectrophotometry or High Performance Liquid Chromotography (HPLC).Martinez, Sanja, et al. \\"Cyclic voltammetry study of plasma antioxidant capacity‚ÄìComparison with the DPPH and TAS spectrophotometric methods.\\"Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry 588.1 (2006): 68-73. Applications of the technique extend to food chemistry, where it is used to determine the antioxidant activity of red wine, chocolate, and hops. Additionally, it even has uses in the world of medicine in that it can determine antioxidants in the skin. Evaluation of a technique The technique being evaluated uses voltammetric sensors combined in an electronic tongue to observe the antioxidant capacity in red wines. These Electronic Tongues (ETs) consist of multiple sensing units like voltammetric sensors, which will have unique responses to certain compounds. This approach is optimal to use since samples of high complexity can be analyzed with high cross-selectivity. Thus, the sensors can be sensitive to pH and antioxidants. As usual, the voltage in the cell was monitored using a working electrode and a reference electrode (Silver/Silver Chloride electrode).Cet√≥, Xavi, et al. \\"Evaluation of red wines antioxidant capacity by means of a voltammetric e-tongue with an optimized sensor array.\\" Electrochimica Acta120 (2014): 180-186. Furthermore, a platinum counter electrode allows the current to continue to flow during the experiment. The Carbon Paste Electrodes sensor (CPE) and the Graphite-Epoxy Composite (GEC) electrode are tested in a saline solution before the scanning of the wine so that a reference signal can be obtained. The wines are then ready to be scanned, once with CPE and once with GEC. While cyclic voltammetry was successfully used to generate currents using the wine samples, the signals were complex and needed an additional extraction stage. It was found that the ET method could successfully analyze wine's antioxidant capacity as it agreed with traditional methods like TEAC, Folin-Ciocalteu, and I280 indexes. Additionally, the time was reduced, the sample did not have to be pretreated, and other reagents were unnecessary, all of which diminished the popularity of traditional methods.Arteaga, Jes√∫s F., et al. \\"Comparison of the simple cyclic voltammetry (CV) and DPPH assays for the determination of antioxidant capacity of active principles.\\" Molecules 17.5 (2012): 5126-5138. Thus, cyclic voltammetry successfully determines the antioxidant capacity and even improves previous results. Antioxidant capacity of chocolate and hops The phenolic antioxidants for cocoa powder, dark chocolate, and milk chocolate can also be determined via cyclic voltammetry. In order to achieve this, the anodic peaks are calculated and analyzed with the knowledge that the first and third anodic peaks can be assigned to the first and second oxidation of flavonoids, while the second anodic peak represents phenolic acids. Using the graph produced by cyclic voltammetry, the total phenolic and flavonoid content can be deduced in each of the three samples. It was observed that cocoa powder and dark chocolate had the highest antioxidant capacity since they had high total phenolic and flavonoid content. Milk chocolate had the lowest capacity as it had the lowest phenolic and flavonoid content. While the antioxidant content was given using the cyclic voltammetry anodic peaks, HPLC must then be used to determine the purity of catechins and procyanidin in cocoa powder, dark chocolate, and milk chocolate. Hops, the flowers used in making beer, contain antioxidant properties due to the presence of flavonoids and other polyphenolic compounds. In this cyclic voltammetry experiment, the working electrode voltage was determined using a ferricinium/ferrocene reference electrode. By comparing different hop extract samples, it was observed that the sample containing polyphenols that were oxidized at less positive potentials proved to have better antioxidant capacity.

He was a leading American Revolutionary statesman in the Cape Fear region, and a delegate for North Carolina in the Continental Congress from 1777 to 1779. Cornelius Harnett is the namesake of Harnett County, North Carolina. Personal life Harnett was born on April 10, 1723 to Cornelius and Elizabeth Harnett in Chowan County, North Carolina. Soon after he was born, his parents moved to Wilmington. As an adult, he obtained a plantation in Wilmington. He became a leading merchant there, and was interested in farming, milling, and mercantile ventures. Harnett was an Episcopalian, but has also been identified as a deist. Though he was an intelligent man, there is little known about his educational background. His intelligence served him well in his passion for politics. Harnett married Mary Holt where they lived on his second plantation, Poplar Grove, located in Scotts Hill, which is north of Wilmington. During Harnett's political career, he maintained his relationship with his wife through letters. William Wilkerson, his associate, would deliver the letters. Harnett's death came about after being captured and \\"thrown across a horse like a sack of meal\\". He was captured by the British upon their occupation of Wilmington in January 1781. His health steadily declined while imprisoned. He died April 28, 1781, shortly after being released on parole. Political career In 1750 Harnett became involved in public affairs when he was elected Wilmington town commissioner. He was appointed a justice of the peace for New Hanover County by Governor Gabriel Johnston. Harnett was elected to represent Wilmington in the Province of North Carolina House of Burgesses in 1754 and 1775. In 1765, Harnett became the chairman of the Sons of Liberty, and was a leader in the resistance to the Stamp Act. In 1775‚Äì1776, he served as the first president of the North Carolina Provincial Council, or Council of Safety, essentially the chief executive of the revolutionary state, although with limited powers. In 1776 he was excepted by Sir Henry Clinton from his proclamation of general amnesty. He was a member of the Continental Congress for 1777‚Äì1779. Harnett was delegate from Wilmington to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th North Carolina Provincial Congress. He was a delegate from Brunswick County and Vice President of the Fifth North Carolina Provincial Congress. References * Connor, Robert D. W.

Kuchi sh≈çga phoneticizes (that is, phonetically articulates) drum strokes using Japanese sound symbolism. Each syllable conveys information about how the drummer is to play a particular note. Kuchi sh≈çga notation is written in katakana, a syllabary familiar to all literate Japanese language speakers. Kuchi sh≈çga can be transliterated from katakana to a Latin alphabet using one of the various systems of r≈çmaji. Common phoneticizations Although kuchi sh≈çga does not have a fixed vocabulary, some phoneticizations are ubiquitous. Don typically means a deep, sustained sound from the center of the taiko. Do sometimes represents a short beat that is not allowed to resonate (i.e., one with a short decay). Doko, dogo, or doro means two drum-beats played in rapid succession. Tsu represents a lightly struck note; tsuku implies two soft tsu beats in rapid succession--one on the right side of the drum, the other on the left. Ka means a sharp tap on the rim of the taiko, and kara describes alternate right and left taps. Taiko players commonly phoneticize a right- handed bachi stroke with don, do, tsu, or ka, respectively; and a reserve kon, ko, ku, and ra for left-handed strokes. Two syllables are reserved for strokes on the tsuzumi, a drum that is much smaller than the taiko: Ta describes a tap on the side of the drum; pon refers to a stroke on the center of the drumhead. Rests Rests are variously indicated with fricative syllables, such as sa and ho; or with semivowels, such as iya. A polysyllable, such as sore and dokkoi, indicates a two-beat rest. This is called \\"kakegoe.\\" If the rest is not sung, the space is often filled with unscripted sounds called kiais. Explicitly assigning words to represent the periods of silence in a song is likely linked to the Japanese concept of ma, where the space between notes is as important as the notes themselves in a performance. Sample notation The following is an example of kuchi sh≈çga notation transliterated in r≈çmaji: Don (tsu) doko don, don (tsu) don kon, doko don (tsu) don When played in common time, this sequence constitutes three measures: 1 . 3&4, 1 . 3 4, 1&2 . 4.

Shooting a musk ox provides four times as much meat as a reindeer, but \\"Greenlanders would much rather have caribou or reindeer meat than musk or ox meat,\\" says Josephine Nymand.Caribou and muskoxen are meat and adventure. - The Danish-Greenlandic Environmental Cooperation \\"But the experience is just as important as the meat,\\" points out Peter Nielsen, Head of Office at the Ministry of Environment and Nature. \\"It is simply the most wonderful part of the year. The trips in for the caribou hunt in the beautiful autumn weather have a great social and physical meaning for people's wellbeing. It has many functions.\\"  Inuit culture  An Inuit family (1917) The long history of mutual dependence between humans and reindeer necessitates continuing efforts to safeguard their relationship and the welfare of both parties. Reindeer hunting ‚Äì which is also commonplace in many other parts of the world ‚Äì is considered so vital to the cultural heritage of certain groups that there is an attemptReindeer hunting as world heritage: A ten-thousand-year-long heritage. - Reindeer hunting as world heritageAbout the project. - Reindeer hunting as world heritageB√∏rge Brende to chair the World Heritage. - Reindeer hunting as world heritage being made to get it placed on UNESCO's World Heritage List.UNESCO's World Heritage List. - UNESCO A Walrus hunt in 1855. The identity of the Inuit is closely tied to their geography, history and their attitudes toward hunting ‚Äì \\"For Inuit, ecology, hunting and culture are synonymous\\".Wenzel G. \\"Animal Rights, Human Rights: Ecology, Economy and Ideology in the Canadian Arctic\\" (1991).

Pressure from environmental and conservation groups has led Greenland's Home Rule Government to set hunting limits for most species. In January 2006, a 150 animal limit was set for the most prized of all Greenlandic animals, the polar bear. Hunters in the region say it is hard to survive on the quotas that have been established. This is especially true due to the dramatic drop in seal skin prices in the late 1980s. That drop occurred after environmental pressure led to a collapse of the seal skin market in the United States. Today, the price of the skins remains so low that most Thule hunters tan only enough skins for personal use; they no longer process them for sale. Moreover, when asked what the single greatest threat to the traditional culture is, Qaanaaq hunter Lars Jeremiassen quickly replied, \\"Greenpeace\\". That response, (documented in 2006 by the Arctic I.CC.E. Project: Indigenous Climate Change Ethnographies,) reflects the devastating effect that environmentalist-led protests against sealing and seal products have had on the Inuit way of life, not just in Greenland, but throughout the Arctic.  Climate change  Another pressure for Greenland's hunters is climate change. According to the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, the largest study ever conducted on the effects of warming in the Arctic, winter temperatures above the 63rd parallel north have increased on average, by 2 to 5 Celsius over the past 50 years and could rise by yet another 10. That increase is having a dramatic effect on the wildlife, environment and culture of the high Arctic. In an interview for the Arctic I.C.C.E. Project, Savissavik hunter Simon Eliason said hunters are spending more time in the fjords (rather than on the sea ice) because there is less sea ice on which to hunt seal, walrus and polar bear. He also said that hunters who net seals under the ice in winter must pull in those nets within hours after an animal is caught. Worms and parasites that the hunters have never seen before rapidly riddle and destroy the carcasses if they are left in the water very long. Eliassen says he believes the parasites have moved north with the warmer water.  Traditional skills at risk  Finally, traditional Thule culture is threatened by development and the growing cash-based economy. Even the smallest settlements in northwest Greenland have electricity today, albeit a small supply of electricity powered by diesel generators. Having electricity, as well as ammunition, hunting rifles and other store-bought products, means that at least one member of every family must be in salaried employment. In most cases, that member is a woman--a wife, daughter or mother. The jobs held by the women allow the men to continue to hunt full-time. But one consequence of this division of labor is that Thule women are losing their knowledge of traditional skills faster than the men. These skills include flensing, treating and sewing skins.

This genus is sometimes called Orthoceratites. Note it is sometimes misspelled as Orthocera, Orthocerus or Orthoceros . Orthoceras was formerly thought to have had a worldwide distribution due to the genus' use as a wastebasket taxon for numerous species of conical-shelled nautiloids throughout the Paleozoic and Triassic. Now, Orthoceras sensu stricto refers to O. regulare, of Ordovician-aged Baltic Sea limestones of Sweden and neighboring areas. These are slender, elongate shells with the middle of the body chamber transversely constricted, and a subcentral orthochoanitic siphuncle. The surface is ornamented by a network of fine lirae . Many other very similar species are included under the genus Michelinoceras.  History of the name  Originally Orthoceras referred to all nautiloids with a straight-shell, called an \\"orthocone\\" . But later research on their internal structures, such as the siphuncle, cameral deposits, and others, showed that these actually belong to a number of groups, even different orders. According to the authoritative Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, the name Orthoceras is now only used to refer to the type species O. regulare from the Middle Ordovician of Sweden and parts of the former Soviet Union such as Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Estonia and Lithuania. The genus might include a few related species.  Confusion with Baculites  Orthoceras and related orthoconic nautiloid cephalopods are often confused with the superficially similar Baculites and related Cretaceous orthoconic ammonoids. Both are long and tubular in form, and both are common items for sale in rock shops (often under each other's names). Both lineages evidently evolved the tubular form independently of one another, and at different times in earth history. Orthoceras lived much earlier (Middle Ordovician) than Baculites (Late Cretaceous). The two types of fossils can be distinguished by many features, most obvious among which is the suture line: simple in Orthoceras (see image), intricately foliated in Baculites and related forms.

His hyphenated surname is a combination of his and his wife Nadine's unmarried surnames. In the 1980s and 1990s he wrote runs of series published by DC Comics, Image Comics, Comico, and other comics publishers, including DC's superhero series Flash and Wonder Woman among others. Additionally he has both written and drawn original creator-owned works, such as Journey: The Adventures of Wolverine MacAlistaire. Biography William Messner-Loebs was born in Ferndale, Michigan. His right arm was amputated above the shoulder in infancy because of a cancerous tumor; he writes and draws with his left hand. Loebs was a friend of Kevin Siembieda, and one of the players in Siembieda's role-playing group in Detroit; in 1981, his mother Frances (Schepeler) Loebs loaned Siembieda the money to print the first role-playing book for his company Palladium Games. His first comics work was for Power Comics Company and on Noble Comics' Justice Machine with Mike Gustovich. His first ongoing series was Journey: The Adventures of Wolverine MacAlistaire, about 19th-century Michigan frontier life, which he both wrote and illustrated. It was published from 1983 to 1986 by Aardvark-Vanaheim and Fantagraphics, followed by a limited series Journey: Wardrums. He wrote the 31-issue Jonny Quest series published by Comico from 1986 to 1988 and collaborated with artist Adam Kubert on the Jezebel Jade limited series, a spin-off from the Jonny Quest series. In 1988, he began writing The Flash with issue #15 and continued through #61. He and artist Greg LaRocque introduced Linda Park as a supporting character in the series in The Flash vol. 2 #28 (July 1989). He also reintroduced the Pied Piper as a reformed villain and established the character as gay, in issue #53 (Aug. 1991). Meanwhile he wrote Dr. Fate #25-41 and the Jaguar series for DC's Impact Comics imprint. He wrote Epicurus the Sage which was illustrated by Sam Kieth, and scripted The Maxx which was illustrated and co-written by Kieth. In 1990, Messner-Loebs became the writer of the Batman newspaper comic strip and wrote the strip until its cancellation the following year. In 1992 Loebs took over writing the Wonder Woman series, with pencils by Mike Deodato. During his run from #63 to #100, he created the character Artemis of Bana-Mighdall, for whom he wrote the mini- series Artemis: Requiem. Meanwhile he wrote Hawkman #9-27, penciled primarily by Steve Lieber.Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 267: \\"Hawkman fought a new string of dark adventures with the help of writer William Messner-Loebs and artist Steve Lieber.\\" In 1996 he had a brief run writing Marvel Comics' Thor.

In 2005, following years of limited freelance work and the loss of his and his wife's home in the early 2000s, Messner-Loebs‚Äôs financial condition was publicized in the local newspaper and comics news sites and Internet message boards. Author Clifford Meth teamed up with artist Neal Adams to create a benefit auction to help Messner-Loebs. The two also created an art tribute book entitled Heroes & Villains with all proceeds aiding Messner- Loebs. His financial situation improved somewhat, and he had a number of works published, including an issue of Green Arrow in 2005, and several pieces in The Three Tenors (Aardwolf Publishing), which he shared credits for along with Clifford Meth and artist Dave Cockrum. A new \\"Journey\\" story was included in the one-shot Many Happy Returns in 2008, and IDW Publishing reprinted the original material in paperback. He has done writing for Boom! Studios, including the four-issue Necronomicon and stories for Zombie Tales. He has done illustration work for the 2007 humor book Chicken Wings for the Beer Drinker's Soul and a monthly cartoon for the Livingston [County, MI] Parent Journal. In 2008, he discussed additional, more substantial new works with various publishers. In 2011, he wrote the DC Retroactive: The Flash ‚Äì The '80s and DC Retroactive: Wonder Woman ‚Äì The '90s one-shots. As of early 2018, William Messner-Loebs and his wife have continued to struggle financially, with Messner-Loebs working two part-time positions in Michigan. In 2019, he co-wrote, with Amy Chu, issues #3‚Äì5 of the limited series Kiss: The End for Dynamite Entertainment, and contributed to an independent comic book anthology called YEET Presents. In September of 2020, William Messner-Loebs was named Project Editor for Resurgence Comics.https://www.facebook.com/1852669548172943/posts/2958580187581868/ Awards In 1985, Messner-Loebs was nominated for the Russ Manning Most Promising Newcomer Award. He received an Inkpot Award in 1987 and his Jonny Quest series from Comico was nominated for the Kirby Award for Best Continuing Series and Best New Series that same year. In 1989, Messner-Loebs was nominated for an Eisner Award as Best Writer for Jonny Quest and his Jezebel Jade series was nominated for the Eisner Award for Best Finite Series. For his work on The Flash, he received the first GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comic Book in 1992. He received the Bill Finger Award for Writing Excellence in 2017.

It was developed in England by academics at the Lancaster University Systems Department through a ten-year action research program.Checkland, P.B. (2001) Soft Systems Methodology, in J. Rosenhead and J. Mingers (eds), Rational Analysis for a Problematic World Revisited. Chichester: Wiley Checkland P.B. (1981), Systems Thinking, Systems Practice, Wiley [rev 1999 ed] Checlnad P.B. and Scholes, J. (1990) Soft Systems in Action, Wiley [rev 1999 ed]  Overview  The methodology was developed from earlier systems engineering approaches, primarily by Peter Checkland and colleagues such as Brian Wilson. The primary use of SSM is in the analysis of complex situations where there are divergent views about the definition of the problem. These situations are \\"soft problems\\" such as: How to improve health services delivery? How to manage disaster planning? When should mentally disordered offenders be diverted from custody? What to do about homelessness amongst young people? In such situations, even the actual problem to be addressed may not be easy to agree upon. To intervene in such situations the soft systems approach uses the notion of a \\"system\\" as an interrogative device that will enable debate amongst concerned parties. In its 'classic' form the methodology consists of seven steps, with initial appreciation of the problem situation leading to the modelling of several human activity systems that might be thought relevant to the problem situation. By discussions and exploration of these, the decision-makers will arrive at accommodations (or, exceptionally, at consensus) over what kind of changes may be systemically desirable and feasible in the situation. Later explanations of the ideas give a more sophisticated view of this systemic method and give more attention to locating the methodology with respect to its philosophical underpinnings. It is the earlier classical view which is most widely used in practice. There are several hundred documented examples of the successful use of SSM in many different fields, ranging from ecology, to business and military logistics. It has been adopted by many organizations and incorporated into other approaches: in the 1990s, for example, it was the recommended planning tool for the UK government's SSADM system development methodology. The general applicability of the approach has led to some criticisms that it is functionalist, non-emancipatory or supports the status quo and existing power structures; this is a claim that users would deny, arguing that the methodology itself can be none of these, it is the user of the methodology that may choose to employ it in such a way. The methodology has been described in several books and many academic articles. Checkland P.B. (1981), Systems Thinking, Systems Practice, Wiley [rev 1999 ed] Checlnad P.B. and Scholes, J. (1990) Soft Systems in Action, Wiley [rev 1999 ed] SSM remains the most widely used and practical application of systems thinking,and other systems approaches such as critical systems thinking have incorporated many of its ideas.  Representation evolution  SSM had a gradual development process of the methodology as a whole from 1972 to 1990. During this period of time, four different representations of SSM were designed, becoming more sophisticated and at the same time less structured and broader in scope.  Blocks and arrows (1972)  In the first studies of what became SSM, the methodology is presented as a sequence of stages with iteration back to previous stages. The sequence was: analysis; root definition of relevant systems; conceptualization; comparison and definition of changes; selection of change to implement; design of change and implementation; appraisal. Seven stages (1981) In the first book written about SSM, the methodology is presented as a cluster of seven activities in a circular learning process called the seven-stage model. The seven stages are: # Enter situation considered problematical # Express the problem situation # Formulate root definitions of relevant systems of purposeful activity # Build conceptual models of the systems named in the root definitions # Compare models with real-world situations # Define possible changes which are both possible and feasible # Take action to improve the problem situation  Two streams (1988)  The two-stream model of SSM recognizes the crucially important role of history in human affairs. This expression of SSM is presented as an approach embodying not only a logic-based stream of analysis (via activity models) but also a cultural and political stream which enable judgements to be made about the accommodations between conflicting interests which might be reachable by the people concerned and which would enable action to be taken.  Four main activities (1990)  The four-activities model is iconic rather than descriptive and subsumes the cultural stream of analysis in the four activities. The four activities are: # Finding out about a problem situation, including culturally/politically # Formulating some relevant purposeful activity models # Debating the situation, using the models, seeking from that debate both: #* changes which would improve the situation and are regarded as both desirable and (culturally) feasible, and #* the accommodations between conflicting interests which will enable action # Taking action in the situation to bring about improvement CATWOE In 1975, David Smyth, a researcher in Checkland's department, observed that SSM was most successful when the root definition included certain elements. These elements, captured in the mnemonic CATWOE, identified the people, processes and environment that contribute to a situation, issue or problem that required analyzing. This is used to prompt thinking about what the business is trying to achieve. Business perspectives help the business analyst to consider the impact of any proposed solution on the people involved. There are six elements of CATWOE: * Customers ‚Äì Who are the beneficiaries of the highest level business process and how does the issue affect them? * Actors ‚Äì Who is involved in the situation, who will be involved in implementing solutions and what will impact their success? * Transformation process ‚Äì What is the transformation that lies at the heart of the system - transforming grapes into wine, transforming unsold goods into sold goods, transforming a societal need into a societal need met? * Weltanschauung (or Worldview) ‚Äì What is the big picture and what are the wider impacts of the issue? * Owner ‚Äì Who owns the process or situation being investigated and what role will they play in the solution? * Environmental constraints ‚Äì What are the constraints and limitations that will impact the solution and its success? Human activity system A human activity system can be defined as \\"notional system (i.e. not existing in any tangible form) where human beings are undertaking some activities that achieve some purpose\\".

As supplied it is in a plain backpack harness with no buoyancy aid. The casing is pressed aluminium with a hinged cover. It has a small optional nitrox cylinder which can be clipped on its outside to convert it to nitrox mode. It contains one oxygen cylinder and two absorbent canisters. In the bottom of its casing is an empty space which is intended for an underwater communications set. Here, \\"up\\", \\"back\\", etc. refer to a man wearing the set standing on land. The casing is thinner towards the lower end, to reduce drag. On the front of the harness of the navy frogman version there is a projecting metal plate intended to carry a limpet mine. The front of the harness is a tough rubber \\"apron\\". The loop of each breathing tube can be strapped down to the shoulder to keep it under control to stop it from catching on things or being easily grabbed from behind. On each side of the casing is a small clip to fasten a parachute to. The IDA71 rebreather in action Operating modes The IDA-71 can be used as an oxygen rebreather, or with the addition of an external cylinder, as a nitrox rebreather, which converts between nitrox and oxygen automatically by a pressure activated valve on the nitrox attachment. It can run as an ordinary diving rebreather. Or it can be run with one of its two absorbent canisters filled with potassium superoxide, which gives off oxygen as it absorbs carbon dioxide: 4KO2 \\\\+ 2CO2 = 2K2CO3 \\\\+ 3O2; in this mode the oxygen cylinder is a bailout, or to fill and flush the circuit at the start of the dive. This mode gives the set more duration underwater, but is dangerous and not to be risked by civilians because of the explosively hot reaction that happens if water gets on the potassium superoxide; whereas ordinary modern diver's rebreather absorbents have been designed to avoid producing a caustic solution (commonly called \\"cocktail\\") if they get wet. Tests at the United States Navy Experimental Diving Unit in Panama City, Florida showed that the IDA71 could give significantly longer dive time with superoxide in one of the canisters than without. For many years the IDA71 and similar have been a standard Russian frogman's and naval work diver's breathing set. The \\"71\\" in its name may be the year that it was designed, like with the numbers in the names of the AK series of Russian rifles. The name IDA comes from (translit. izoliruyushchiy dykhatel'nyy apparat, literally Insulating/Isolating Breathing Apparatus). Other name is Individual Breathing Apparatus (, translit. Individualniy Dykhatelniy Apparat). In its original Russian mode as an oxygen rebreather, its dive duration is said to be 4 hours. Filling both canisters with soda lime and putting a second oxygen cylinder in the empty space at the bottom, might increase its dive duration to 8 hours. A number of IDA71's have found their way out of the ex-USSR to Europe and America, where recreational divers have added a wing buoyancy compensator and converted them into manually controlled closed circuit rebreathers.

Excelling in many fields of study and statecraft, he was a mathematician, astronomer, meteorologist, geologist, entomologist, anatomist, climatologist, zoologist, botanist, pharmacologist, medical scientist, agronomist, archaeologist, ethnographer, cartographer, geographer, geophysicist, mineralogist, encyclopedist, military general, diplomat, hydraulic engineer, inventor, economist, academy chancellor, finance minister, governmental state inspector, philosopher, art critic, poet, and musician. He was the head official for the Bureau of Astronomy in the Song court, as well as an Assistant Minister of Imperial Hospitality.Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 33. At court his political allegiance was to the Reformist faction known as the New Policies Group, headed by Chancellor Wang Anshi (1021‚Äì1085). In his Dream Pool Essays or Dream Torrent Essays (; Mengxi Bitan) of 1088, Shen was the first to describe the magnetic needle compass, which would be used for navigation (first described in Europe by Alexander Neckam in 1187).Bowman (2000), 599.Mohn (2003), 1. Shen discovered the concept of true north in terms of magnetic declination towards the north pole, with experimentation of suspended magnetic needles and \\"the improved meridian determined by Shen's [astronomical] measurement of the distance between the pole star and true north\\".Sivin (1995), III, 22. This was the decisive step in human history to make compasses more useful for navigation, and may have been a concept unknown in Europe for another four hundred years (evidence of German sundials made circa 1450 show markings similar to Chinese geomancer compasses in regard to declination).Embree (1997), 843.Temple (1986), 115. Alongside his colleague Wei Pu, Shen planned to map the orbital paths of the Moon and the planets in an intensive five-year project involving daily observations, yet this was thwarted by political opponents at court. To aid his work in astronomy, Shen Kuo made improved designs of the armillary sphere, gnomon, sighting tube, and invented a new type of inflow water clock. Shen Kuo devised a geological hypothesis for land formation (geomorphology), based upon findings of inland marine fossils, knowledge of soil erosion, and the deposition of silt.Sivin (1995), III, 23‚Äì24. He also proposed a hypothesis of gradual climate change, after observing ancient petrified bamboos that were preserved underground in a dry northern habitat that would not support bamboo growth in his time. He was the first literary figure in China to mention the use of the drydock to repair boats suspended out of water, and also wrote of the effectiveness of the relatively new invention of the canal pound lock. Chinese philosopher Mozi (470‚Äì391 BC) so far is the first person in history to describe camera obscura (a basic camera). Shen implemented an improved version of the camera, nearly 2000 years later. Shen wrote extensively about movable type printing invented by Bi Sheng (990‚Äì1051), and because of his written works the legacy of Bi Sheng and the modern understanding of the earliest movable type has been handed down to later generations. Following an old tradition in China, Shen created a raised-relief map while inspecting borderlands. His description of an ancient crossbow mechanism which he himself unearthed proved to be a Jacob's staff, a surveying tool which wasn't known in Europe until described by Levi ben Gerson in 1321. Shen Kuo wrote several other books besides the Dream Pool Essays, yet much of the writing in his other books has not survived. Some of Shen's poetry was preserved in posthumous written works. Although much of his focus was on technical and scientific issues, he had an interest in divination and the supernatural, the latter including his vivid description of unidentified flying objects from eyewitness testimony. He also wrote commentary on ancient Daoist and Confucian texts.  Life   Birth and youth  Shen Kuo was born in Qiantang (modern-day Hangzhou) in the year 1031. His father Shen Zhou (; 978‚Äì1052) was a somewhat lower-class gentry figure serving in official posts on the provincial level; his mother was from a family of equal status in Suzhou, with her maiden name being Xu ().Sivin (1995), III, 1. Shen Kuo received his initial childhood education from his mother, which was a common practice in China during this period. She was very educated herself, teaching Kuo and his brother Pi () the military doctrines of her own elder brother Xu Tang (; 975‚Äì1016). Since Shen was unable to boast of a prominent familial clan history like many of his elite peers born in the north, he was forced to rely on his wit and stern determination to achieve in his studies, subsequently passing the imperial examinations and enter the challenging and sophisticated life of an exam-drafted state bureaucrat. The Bencao on traditional Chinese medicine; printed with woodblock printing press in 1249; Shen grew ill often as a child, and so developed an interest in medicinal cures. From about 1040 AD, Shen's family moved around Sichuan province and finally to the international seaport at Xiamen, where Shen's father accepted minor provincial posts in each new location.Sivin (1995), III, 5. Shen Zhou also served several years in the prestigious capital judiciary, the equivalent of a national supreme court. Shen Kuo took notice of the various towns and rural features of China as his family traveled, while he became interested during his youth in the diverse topography of the land. He also observed the intriguing aspects of his father's engagement in administrative governance and the managerial problems involved; these experiences had a deep impact on him as he later became a government official. Since he often became ill as a child, Shen Kuo also developed a natural curiosity about medicine and pharmaceutics. Shen Zhou died in the late winter of 1051 (or early 1052), when his son Shen Kuo was 21 years old. Shen Kuo grieved for his father, and following Confucian ethics, remained inactive in a state of mourning for three years until 1054 (or early 1055).Sivin (1995), III, 6. As of 1054, Shen began serving in minor local governmental posts. However, his natural abilities to plan, organize, and design were proven early in life; one example is his design and supervision of the hydraulic drainage of an embankment system, which converted some one hundred thousand acres (400 km¬≤) of swampland into prime farmland. Shen Kuo noted that the success of the silt fertilization method relied upon the effective operation of sluice gates of irrigation canals.Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 3, 230‚Äì231.  Official career  Shen's confidant, Emperor Shenzong of Song (r. 1067‚Äì1085), a Song era portrait painting. In 1063 Shen Kuo successfully passed the Imperial examinations, the difficult national-level standard test that every high official was required to pass in order to enter the governmental system. He not only passed the exam however, but was placed into the higher category of the best and brightest students. While serving at Yangzhou, Shen's brilliance and dutiful character caught the attention of Zhang Chu (; 1015‚Äì1080), the Fiscal Intendant of the region. Shen made a lasting impression upon Zhang, who recommended Shen for a court appointment in the financial administration of the central court. Shen would also eventually marry Zhang's daughter, who became his second wife. In his career as a scholar-official for the central government, Shen Kuo was also an ambassador to the Western Xia Dynasty and Liao Dynasty,Steinhardt (1997), 316. a military commander, a director of hydraulic works, and the leading chancellor of the Hanlin Academy.Needham (1986), Volume 1, 135. By 1072, Shen was appointed as the head official of the Bureau of Astronomy. With his leadership position in the bureau, Shen was responsible for projects in improving calendrical science,Bowman (2000), 105. and proposed many reforms to the Chinese calendar alongside the work of his colleague Wei Pu.Sivin (1995), III, 18. With his impressive skills and aptitude for matters of economy and finance, Shen was appointed as the Finance Commissioner at the central court. As written by Li Zhiyi, a man married to Hu Wenrou (granddaughter of Hu Su, a famous minister of the Song Dynasty), Shen Kuo was Li's mentor while Shen served as an official.Tao et al. (2004), 19. According to Li's epitaph for his wife, Shen would sometimes relay questions via Li to Hu when he needed clarification for his mathematical work, as Hu Wenrou was esteemed by Shen as a remarkable female mathematician. Shen lamented: \\"If only she were a man, Wenrou would be my friend.\\" While employed by the central government, Shen Kuo was also sent out with others to inspect the granary system of the empire, investigating problems of illegal tax- collection, negligence, ineffective disaster relief, and inadequate water- conservancy projects.Hymes & Schirokauer (1993), 109. While Shen was appointed as the regional inspector of Zhejiang in 1073, the Emperor requested that Shen pay a visit to the famous poet Su Shi (1037‚Äì1101), then an administrator in Hangzhou.Hartman (1990), 22. Shen took advantage of this meeting to copy some of Su's poetry, which he presented to the Emperor indicating that it expressed \\"abusive and hateful\\" speech against the Song court; these poems were later politicized by Li Ding and Shu Dan in order to level a court case against Su. (The Crow Terrace Poetry Trial, of 1079.) With his demonstrations of loyalty and ability, Shen Kuo was awarded the honorary title of a State Foundation Viscount by Emperor Shenzong of Song (r. 1067‚Äì1085), who placed a great amount of trust in Shen Kuo. He was even made 'companion to the heir apparent' (Â§™Â≠ê‰∏≠ÂÖÅ; 'Taizi zhongyun'). Portrait painting of Wang Anshi. At court Shen was a political favorite of the Chancellor Wang Anshi (1021‚Äì1086), who was the leader of the political faction of Reformers, also known as the New Policies Group (, Xin Fa).Sivin (1995), III, 3. Shen Kuo had a previous history with Wang Anshi, since it was Wang who had composed the funerary epitaph for Shen's father, Zhou. Shen Kuo soon impressed Wang Anshi with his skills and abilities as an administrator and government agent. In 1072, Shen was sent to supervise Wang's program of surveying the building of silt deposits in the Bian Canal outside the capital city. Using an original technique, Shen successfully dredged the canal and demonstrated the formidable value of the silt gathered as a fertilizer. He gained further reputation at court once he was dispatched as an envoy to the Khitan Liao Dynasty in the summer of 1075. The Khitans had made several aggressive negotiations of pushing their borders south, while manipulating several incompetent Song ambassadors who conceded to the Liao Kingdom's demands. In a brilliant display of diplomacy, Shen Kuo came to the camp of the Khitan monarch at Mt. Yongan (near modern Pingquan, Hebei), armed with copies of previously archived diplomatic negotiations between the Song and Liao dynasties. Shen Kuo refuted Emperor Daozong's bluffs point for point, while the Song reestablished their rightful border line. In regard to the L√Ω Dynasty of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát (in modern northern Vietnam), Shen demonstrated in his Dream Pool Essays that he was familiar with the key players (on the Vietnamese side) in the prelude to the Sino-Vietnamese War of 1075‚Äì1077.Anderson (2008), 202. With his reputable achievements, Shen became a trusted member of Wang Anshi's elite circle of eighteen unofficial core political loyalists to the New Policies Group. Boundaries of the Northern Song Dynasty, the Liao Dynasty, and the Western Xia. Although much of Wang Anshi's reforms outlined in the New Policies centered on state finance, land tax reform, and the Imperial examinations, there were also military concerns. This included policies of raising militias to lessen the expense of upholding a million soldiers,Ebrey et al. (2006), 164. putting government monopolies on saltpetre and sulphur production and distribution in 1076 (to ensure that gunpowder solutions would not fall into the hands of enemies),Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 7, 126.Zhang (1986), 489. and aggressive military policy towards Song's northern rivals of the Western Xia and Liao dynasties.Sivin (1995), III, 4‚Äì5. A few years after Song Dynasty military forces had made victorious territorial gains against the Tanguts of the Western Xia, in 1080 Shen Kuo was entrusted as a military officer in defense of Yanzhou (modern-day Yan'an, Shaanxi province).Sivin (1995), III, 8. During the autumn months of 1081, Shen was successful in defending Song Dynasty territory while capturing several fortified towns of the Western Xia.Sivin (1995), III, 9. The Emperor Shenzong of Song rewarded Shen with numerous titles for his merit in these battles, and in the sixteen months of Shen's military campaign, he received 273 letters from the Emperor. However, Emperor Shenzong trusted an arrogant military officer who disobeyed the emperor and Shen's proposal for strategic fortifications, instead fortifying what Shen considered useless strategic locations. Furthermore, this officer expelled Shen from his commanding post at the main citadel, so as to deny him any glory in chance of victory. The result of this was nearly catastrophic, as the forces of the arrogant officer were decimated; Xinzhong Yao states that the death toll was 60,000. Nonetheless, Shen was successful in defending his fortifications and the only possible Tangut invasion-route to Yanzhou.  Impeachment and later life  The new Chancellor Cai Que (; 1036‚Äì1093) held Shen responsible for the disaster and loss of life. Along with abandoning the territory which Shen Kuo had fought for, Cai ousted Shen from his seat of office. Shen's life was now forever changed, as he lost his once reputable career in state governance and the military. Shen was then put under probation in a fixed residence for the next six years. However, as he was isolated from governance, he decided to pick up the ink brush and dedicate himself to intensive scholarly studies. After completing two geographical atlases for a state-sponsored program, Shen was rewarded by having his sentence of probation lifted, allowing him to live in a place of his choice. Shen was also pardoned by the court for any previous faults or crimes that were claimed against him. luohan, by Liu Songnian, painted in 1207; Shen Kuo not only listed literati painting as one of his cherished pastimes, but also Buddhist meditation. In his more idle years removed from court affairs, Shen Kuo enjoyed pastimes of the Chinese gentry and literati that would indicate his intellectual level and cultural taste to others.Lian (2001), 24. As described in his Dream Pool Essays, Shen Kuo enjoyed the company of the \\"nine guests\\" (‰πùÂÆ¢, jiuke), a figure of speech for the Chinese zither, the older 17x17 line variant of weiqi (known today as go), Zen Buddhist meditation, ink (calligraphy and painting), tea drinking, alchemy, chanting poetry, conversation, and drinking wine.Lian (2001), 20. These nine activities were an extension to the older so-called Four Arts of the Chinese Scholar. According to Zhu Yu's book Pingzhou Table Talks (; Pingzhou Ketan) of 1119, Shen Kuo had two marriages; the second wife was the daughter of Zhang Chu (), who came from Huainan. Lady Zhang was said to be overbearing and fierce, often abusive to Shen Kuo, even attempting at one time to pull off his beard. Shen Kuo's children were often upset over this, and prostrated themselves to Lady Zhang to quit this behavior. Despite this, Lady Zhang went as far as to drive out Shen Kuo's son from his first marriage, expelling him from the household. However, after Lady Zhang died, Shen Kuo fell into a deep depression and even attempted to jump into the Yangtze River to drown himself. Although this suicide attempt failed, he would die a year later.Hongen.com (2000‚Äì2006). . Beijing Golden Human Computer Co., Ltd. . Retrieved on 2007-08-27. In the 1070s, Shen had purchased a lavish garden estate on the outskirts of modern-day Zhenjiang, Jiangsu province, a place of great beauty which he named \\"Dream Brook\\" (\\"Mengxi\\") after he visited it for the first time in 1086. Shen Kuo permanently moved to the Dream Brook Estate in 1088, and in that same year he completed his life's written work of the Dream Pool Essays, naming the book after his garden-estate property. It was there that Shen Kuo spent the last several years of his life in leisure, isolation, and illness, until his death in 1095.  Scholarly achievements  Shen Kuo wrote extensively on a wide range of different subjects. His written work included two geographical atlases, a treatise on music with mathematical harmonics, governmental administration, mathematical astronomy, astronomical instruments, martial defensive tactics and fortifications, painting, tea, medicine, and much poetry.Sivin (1995), III, 10. His scientific writings have been praised by sinologists such as Joseph Needham and Nathan Sivin, and he has been compared by Sivin to polymaths such as his contemporary Su Song, as well as Gottfried Leibniz and Mikhail Lomonosov.Sivin (1995), III, 11.  Raised-relief map  A Han Dynasty incense burner, showing artificial mountains as a lid decoration, which may have influenced the invention.Needham (1986), Volume 3, 580‚Äì581. If the account of Sima Qian (c. 145‚Äì86 BC) in his Records of the Grand Historian is proven correct upon the unearthing of Qin Shi Huang's (r. 221‚Äì210 BC) tomb, the raised-relief map has existed since the Qin Dynasty (221‚Äì206 BC).Temple (1986), 179. Robert Temple and Joseph Needham suggest that certain pottery vessels of the Han Dynasty (202 BC ‚Äì 220 AD) showing artificial mountains as lid decorations may have influenced the raised-relief map. The Han Dynasty general Ma Yuan (14 BC ‚Äì 49 AD) made a raised-relief map of valleys and mountains in a rice-constructed model of 32 AD.Crespigny (2007), 659. Such rice models were expounded on by the Tang Dynasty (618‚Äì907) author Jiang Fang in his Essay on the Art of Constructing Mountains with Rice (c. 845 AD). A raised-relief map made of wood representing all the provinces of the empire and put together like a giant 0.93 m2 (10 ft2) jigsaw puzzle was invented by Xie Zhuang (421‚Äì466 AD) during the Liu Song Dynasty (420‚Äì479). Shen's largest atlas included twenty three maps of China and foreign regions that were drawn at a uniform scale of 1:900,000. Shen also created a raised-relief map using sawdust, wood, beeswax, and wheat paste.Needham (1986), Volume 3, 579‚Äì580.Temple (1986), 180. Zhu Xi (1130‚Äì1200) was inspired by the raised-relief map of Huang Shang and so made his own portable map made of wood and clay which could be folded up from eight hinged pieces.Needham (1986), Volume 3, 580.  Pharmacology  For pharmacology, Shen wrote of the difficulties of adequate diagnosis and therapy, as well as the proper selection, preparation, and administration of drugs.Sivin (1995), III, 29. He held great concern for detail and philological accuracy in identification, use and cultivation of different types of medicinal herbs, such as in which months medicinal plants should be gathered, their exact ripening times, which parts should be used for therapy; for domesticated herbs he wrote about planting times, fertilization, and other matters of horticulture. In the realms of botany, zoology, and mineralogy, Shen Kuo documented and systematically described hundreds of different plants, agricultural crops, rare vegetation, animals, and minerals found in China.Needham (1986), Volume 6, Part 1, 475.Needham (1986), Volume 6, Part 1, 499.Needham (1986), Volume 6, Part 1, 501.Sivin (1995), III, 30. For example, Shen noted that the mineral orpiment was used to quickly erase writing errors on paper.Cherniack (1994), 95‚Äì96.  Civil engineering  A side view of a pound lock for canals, invented in China in the 10th century and described by Shen. Five bracket arm bases and two cantilever arms, from the Yingzao Fashi of 1103. The writing of Shen Kuo is the only source for the date when the drydock was first used in China. Shen Kuo wrote that during the Xi-Ning reign (1068‚Äì1077), the court official Huang Huaixin devised a plan for repairing 60 m (200 ft) long palatial boats that were a century old; essentially, Huang Huaixin devised the first Chinese drydock for suspending boats out of water. These boats were then placed in a roof-covered dock warehouse to protect them from weathering.Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 3, 660. Shen also wrote about the effectiveness of the new invention (i.e. by the 10th century engineer Qiao Weiyo) of the pound lock to replace the old flash lock design used in canals. He wrote that it saved the work of five hundred annual labors, annual costs of up to 1,250,000 strings of cash, and increased the size limit of boats accommodated from 21 tons/21000 kg to 113 tons/115000 kg.Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 3, 352. If it were not for Shen Kuo's analysis and quoting in his Dream Pool Essays of the writings of the architect Yu Hao (fl. 970), the latter's work would have been lost to history.Needham (1986), Volume 4, 141. Yu designed a famous wooden pagoda that burned down in 1044 and was replaced in 1049 by a brick pagoda (the 'Iron Pagoda') of similar height, but not of his design. From Shen's quotation‚Äîor perhaps Shen's own paraphrasing of Yu Hao's Timberwork Manual (Êú®Á∂ì; Mujing)‚Äîshows that already in the 10th century there was a graded system of building unit proportions, a system which Shen states had become more precise in his time but stating no one could possibly reproduce such a sound work.Chung (2004), 19. However, he did not anticipate the more complex and matured system of unit proportions embodied in the extensive written work by scholar-official Li Jie (1065‚Äì1110), the Treatise on Architectural Methods (ÁáüÈÄ†Ê≥ïÂºè; Yingzao Fashi) of 1103.Ruitenbeek (1996), 26‚Äì27. Klaas Ruitenbeek states that the version of the Timberwork Manual quoted by Shen is most likely Shen's summarization of Yu's work or a corrupted passage of the original by Yu Hao, as Shen writes: \\"According to some, the work was written by Yu Hao.\\"Ruitenbeek (1996), 26.  Anatomy  The Chinese had long taken an interest in examining the human body. For example in 16 AD, the Xin Dynasty usurper Wang Mang called for the dissection of an executed man, to examine his arteries and viscera in order to discover cures for illnesses.Bielenstein (1986), 239. Shen also took interest in human anatomy, dispelling the long-held Chinese theory that the throat contained three valves, writing, \\"When liquid and solid are imbibed together, how can it be that in one's mouth they sort themselves into two throat channels?\\"Sivin (1995), III, 30‚Äì31. Shen maintained that the larynx was the beginning of a system that distributed vital qi from the air throughout the body, and that the esophagus was a simple tube that dropped food into the stomach.Sivin (1995), III, 31. Following Shen's reasoning and correcting the findings of the dissection of executed bandits in 1045, an early 12th-century Chinese account of a bodily dissection finally supported Shen's belief in two throat valves, not three.Sivin (1995), III, 30‚Äì31, Footnote 27. Also, the later Song Dynasty judge and early forensic expert Song Ci (1186‚Äì1249) would promote the use of autopsy in order to solve homicide cases, as written in his Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified.Sung (1981), 12, 19, 20, 72.  Mathematics and optics  Yang Hui triangle (Pascal's triangle) using rod numerals, from a book by mathematician Zhu Shijie, 1303 An 18th-century diagram of camera obscura In the broad field of mathematics, Shen Kuo mastered many practical mathematical problems, including many complex formulas for geometry,Needham (1986), Volume 3, 39. circle packing,Needham (1986), Volume 3, 145. and chords and arcs problems employing trigonometry.Needham (1986), Volume 3, 109. Shen addressed problems of writing out very large numbers, as large as (104)43. Shen's \\"technique of small increments\\" laid the foundation in Chinese mathematics for packing problems involving equal difference series.Katz (2007), 308. Sal Restivo writes that Shen used summation of higher series to ascertain the number of kegs which could be piled in layers in a space shaped like the frustum of a rectangular pyramid.Restivo (1992), 32. In his formula \\"technique of intersecting circles\\", he created an approximation of the arc of a circle s given the diameter d, sagitta v, and length of the chord c subtending the arc, the length of which he approximated as s = c + 2v2/d. Restivo writes that Shen's work in the lengths of arcs of circles provided the basis for spherical trigonometry developed in the 13th century by Guo Shoujing (1231‚Äì1316). He also simplified the counting rods technique by outlining short cuts in algorithm procedures used on the counting board, an idea expanded on by the mathematician Yang Hui (1238‚Äì1298).Katz (2007), 308‚Äì309. Victor J. Katz asserts that Shen's method of \\"dividing by 9, increase by 1; dividing by 8, increase by 2,\\" was a direct forerunner to the rhyme scheme method of repeated addition \\"9, 1, bottom add 1; 9, 2, bottom add 2\\".Katz (2007), 309. Shen wrote extensively about what he had learned while working for the state treasury, including mathematical problems posed by computing land tax, estimating requirements, currency issues, metrology, and so forth.Sivin (1995), III, 12, 14. Shen once computed the amount of terrain space required for battle formations in military strategy,Sivin (1995), III, 14. and also computed the longest possible military campaign given the limits of human carriers who would bring their own food and food for other soldiers.Ebrey et al. (2006), 162. Shen wrote about the earlier Yi Xing (672‚Äì717), a Buddhist monk who applied an early escapement mechanism to a water-powered celestial globe.Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 473‚Äì475. By using mathematical permutations, Shen described Yi Xing's calculation of possible positions on a go board game. Shen calculated the total number for this using up to five rows and twenty five game pieces, which yielded the number 847,288,609,443.Sivin (1995), III, 15.Needham (1986), Volume 3, 139. Shen Kuo experimented with the pinhole camera and burning mirror as the ancient Chinese Mohists had done in the 4th century BC. Mozi first described the concept of camera obscura 2000 years earlier during the Warring States period. An Iraqi Muslim scientist Ibn al-Haytham (965‚Äì1039) further experimented with camera obscura. Then Shen Kuo was the first to attribute geometrical and quantitative properties to the camera obscura.Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 1, 98. Using a fitting metaphor, Shen compared optical image inversion to an oarlock and waisted drum. He also discussed focal points and noted that the image in a concave mirror is inverted. Shen, who never asserted that he was the first to experiment with camera obscura, hints in his writing that camera obscura was dealt with in the Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang written by Duan Chengshi (d. 863) during the Tang Dynasty (618‚Äì907), in regard to the inverted image of a Chinese pagoda by a seashore.  Magnetic needle compass  Since the time of the engineer and inventor Ma Jun (c. 200‚Äì265), the Chinese had used the south- pointing chariot, which did not employ magnetism, as a compass. In 1044 the Collection of the Most Important Military Techniques (; Wujing Zongyao) recorded that fish-shaped objects cut from sheet iron, magnetized by thermoremanence (essentially, heating that produced weak magnetic force), and placed in a water-filled bowl enclosed by a box were used for directional pathfinding alongside the south-pointing chariot.Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 1, 252. A Han Dynasty (202 BC‚Äì220 AD) ladle-and-basin lodestone south- pointing compass, used by ancient Chinese geomancers, but not for navigation. However, it was not until the time of Shen Kuo that the earliest magnetic compasses would be used for navigation. In his written work, Shen Kuo made the first known explicit reference to the magnetic compass-needle and the concept of true north.Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 1, 249‚Äì250.Hsu (1988), 102. He wrote that steel needles were magnetized once they were rubbed with lodestone, and that they were put in floating position or in mountings; he described the suspended compass as the best form to be used, and noted that the magnetic needle of compasses pointed either south or north.Sivin (1995), III, 21.Elisseeff (2000), 296. Shen Kuo asserted that the needle will point south but with a deviation, stating \\"[the magnetic needles] are always displaced slightly east rather than pointing due south.\\" Shen Kuo wrote that it was preferable to use the twenty-four-point rose instead of the old eight compass cardinal points ‚Äî and the former was recorded in use for navigation shortly after Shen's death. The preference of use for the twenty-four-point-rose compass may have arisen from Shen's finding of a more accurate astronomical meridian, determined by his measurement between the pole star and true north; however, it could also have been inspired by geomantic beliefs and practices. The book of the author Zhu Yu, the Pingzhou Table Talks published in 1119 (written from 1111 to 1117), was the first record of use of a compass for seafaring navigation.Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 1, 279. However, Zhu Yu's book recounts events back to 1086, when Shen Kuo was writing the Dream Pool Essays; this meant that in Shen's time the compass might have already been in navigational use. In any case, Shen Kuo's writing on magnetic compasses has proved invaluable for understanding China's earliest use of the compass for seafaring navigation.  Archaeology  Bronzeware from the Shang Dynasty (1600‚Äì1046 BC); Song era antiquarians and archeologists in search of antiques for reviving ancient rituals claimed to have found bronzewares dated as far back as the Shang era, which contained written inscriptions.Fairbank & Goldman (1992), 33. Many of Shen Kuo's contemporaries were interested in antiquarian pursuits of collecting old artworks.Ebrey et al. (2006), 163. They were also interested in archaeological pursuits, although for rather different reasons than why Shen Kuo held an interest in archaeology. While Shen's educated Confucian contemporaries were interested in obtaining ancient relics and antiques in order to revive their use in rituals, Shen was more concerned with how items from archeological finds were originally manufactured and what their functionality would have been, based on empirical evidence.Fraser & Haber (1986), 227. Shen Kuo criticized those in his day who reconstructed ancient ritual objects using only their imagination and not the tangible evidence from archeological digs or finds. Shen also disdained the notion of others that these objects were products of the \\"sages\\" or the aristocratic class of antiquity, rightfully crediting the items' manufacture and production to the common working people and artisans of previous eras. Fraser and Haber write that Shen Kuo \\"advocated the use of an interdisciplinary approach to archaeology and practiced such an approach himself through his work in metallurgy, optics, and geometry in the study of ancient measures.\\" While working in the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo's interest in archaeology and old relics led him to reconstruct an armillary sphere from existing models as well as from ancient texts that could provide additional information. Shen used ancient mirrors while conducting his optics experiments. He observed ancient weaponry, describing the scaled sight devices on ancient crossbows and the ancients' production of swords with composite blades that had a midrib of wrought iron and low-carbon steel while having two sharp edges of high-carbon steel. Being a knowledgeable musician, Shen also suggested suspending an ancient bell by using a hollow handle. In his assessment of the carved reliefs of the ancient Zhuwei Tomb, Shen stated that the reliefs demonstrate genuine Han Dynasty (202 BC‚Äì220 AD) era clothing.Rudolph (1963), 176. After unearthing an ancient crossbow device from a house's garden in Haichow, Jiangsu, Shen discovered that the cross-wire grid sighting device, marked in graduated measurements on the stock, could be used to calculate the height of a distant mountain in the same way that mathematicians could apply right-angle triangles to measure height.Needham (1986), Volume 3, 574. Needham asserts Shen had discovered the survey device known as Jacob's staff, which was not described elsewhere until the Proven√ßal Jewish mathematician Levi ben Gerson (1288‚Äì1344) wrote of it in 1321.Needham (1986), Volume 3, 573. Shen wrote that while viewing the whole of a mountain, the distance on the instrument was long, but while viewing a small part of the mountainside the distance was short due to the device's cross piece that had to be pushed further away from the observer's eye, with the graduation starting on the further end. He wrote that if one placed an arrow on the device and looked past its end, the degree of the mountain could be measured and thus its height could be calculated.  Geology  View of the Taihang Mountains, where Shen Kuo had his epiphany about geomorphology. The ancient Greek Aristotle (384 BC‚Äì322 BC) wrote in his Meteorology of how the earth had the potential for physical change, including the belief that all rivers and seas at one time did not exist where they were, and were dry. The Greek writer Xenophanes (570 BC‚Äì480 BC) wrote of how inland marine fossils were evidence that massive periodic flooding had wiped out mankind several times in the past, but never wrote of land formation or shifting seashores.Desmond (1975), 692‚Äì707. Du Yu (222‚Äì285) a Chinese Jin Dynasty officer, believed that the land of hills would eventually be leveled into valleys and valleys would gradually rise to form hills.Temple (1986), 169. The Daoist alchemist Ge Hong (284‚Äì364) wrote of the legendary immortal Magu; in a written dialogue by Ge, Ma Gu described how what was once the Eastern Sea (i.e. East China Sea) had transformed into solid land where mulberry trees grew, and would one day be filled with mountains and dry, dusty lands. The later Persian Muslim scholar Ab≈´ RayhƒÅn al-Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´ (973‚Äì1048) hypothesized that India was once covered by the Indian Ocean while observing rock formations at the mouths of rivers.Salam (1984), 179‚Äì213. Li Kan(1244‚Äì1320); using evidence of fossilized bamboo within China's dry northwestern climate zone, Shen Kuo hypothesized that climates naturally shifted geographically over time. It was Shen Kuo who formulated a hypothesis about the process of land formation (geomorphology) based upon several observations as evidence. This included his observation of fossil shells in a geological stratum of a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean. He inferred that the land was reshaped and formed by erosion of the mountains, uplift, and the deposition of silt, after observing strange natural erosions of the Taihang Mountains and the Yandang Mountain near Wenzhou.Needham (1986), Volume 3, 603‚Äì604. He hypothesized that, with the inundation of silt, the land of the continent must have been formed over an enormous span of time. While visiting the Taihang Mountains in 1074, Shen Kuo noticed strata of bivalve shells and ovoid rocks in a horizontal-running span through a cliff like a large belt.Sivin (1995), III, 23. Shen proposed that the cliff was once the location of an ancient seashore that by his time had shifted hundreds of miles east. Shen wrote that in the Zhiping reign period (1064‚Äì1067) a man of Zezhou unearthed an object in his garden that looked like a serpent or dragon, and after examining it, concluded the dead animal had apparently turned to \\"stone\\".Needham (1986), Volume 3, 618.Chan (2002), 15. The magistrate of Jincheng, Zheng Boshun, examined the creature as well, and noted the same scale-like markings that were seen on other marine animals. Shen Kuo likened this to the \\"stone crabs\\" found in China. Shen also wrote that since petrified bamboos were found underground in a climatic area where they had never been known to be grown, the climate there must have shifted geographically over time.Needham (1986), Volume 3, 614. Around the year 1080, Shen Kuo noted that a landslide on the bank of a large river near Yanzhou (modern Yan'an) had revealed an open space several dozens of feet under the ground once the bank collapsed. This underground space contained hundreds of petrified bamboos still intact with roots and trunks, \\"all turned to stone\\" as Shen Kuo wrote. Shen Kuo noted that bamboos do not grow in Yanzhou, located in northern China, and he was puzzled during which previous dynasty the bamboos could have grown. Considering that damp and gloomy low places provide suitable conditions for the growth of bamboo, Shen deduced that the climate of Yanzhou must have fit that description in very ancient times. Although this would have intrigued many of his readers, the study of paleoclimatology in medieval China never developed into an established discipline. The Song dynasty philosopher Zhu Xi (1130‚Äì1200) wrote of this curious natural phenomenon of fossils as well. He was known to have read the works of Shen Kuo. Shen's description of soil erosion and weathering predated that of Georgius Agricola in his book of 1546, De veteribus et novis metallis. Furthermore, Shen's theory of sedimentary deposition predated that of James Hutton, who published his groundbreaking work in 1802 (considered the foundation of modern geology).Needham (1986), Volume 3, 604. Historian Joseph Needham likened Shen's account to that of the Scottish scientist Roderick Murchison (1792‚Äì1871), who was inspired to become a geologist after observing a providential landslide.  Meteorology  Shen accurately hypothesized that rainbows were caused by sunlight passing through rain droplets. Early speculation and hypothesis pertaining to what is now known as meteorology had a long tradition in China before Shen Kuo.For example, Wang Chong (27‚Äì97) accurately described the process of the water cycle. Needham (1986), Volume 3, 468. Shen wrote vivid descriptions of tornadoes‚Äîthe first known description of them in East Asia. He also gave reasoning (earlier proposed by Sun Sikong, 1015‚Äì1076) that rainbows were formed by the shadow of the sun in rain, occurring when the sun would shine upon it.Sivin (1995), III, 24.Sivin (1984), 534.Kim (2000), 171. Paul Dong writes that Shen's explanation of the rainbow as a phenomenon of atmospheric refraction \\"is basically in accord with modern scientific principles.\\" In Europe, Roger Bacon (1214‚Äì1294) was the first to suggest that the colors of the rainbow were caused by the reflection and refraction of sunlight through rain drops.Sarkar, Salazar-Palma, Sengupta (2006), 21. Shen hypothesized that rays of sunlight refract before reaching the surface of the earth, hence people on earth observing the sun are not viewing it in its exact position, in other words, the altitude of the apparent sun is higher than the actual altitude of the sun. Dong writes that \\"at the time, this discovery was remarkably original.\\" Ibn al-Haytham, in his Book of Optics (1021), also discussed atmospheric refraction (in regard to twilight).  Astronomy and instruments  One of the five star maps published in 1092 AD for Su Song's horological and astronomical treatise, featuring Shen Kuo's corrected position of the pole star. Being the head official for the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo was an avid scholar of medieval astronomy, and improved the designs of several astronomical instruments. Shen is credited with making improved designs of the gnomon, armillary sphere, and clepsydra clock.Sivin (1995), III, 17. For the clepsydra he designed a new overflow-tank type, and argued for a more efficient higher-order interpolation instead of linear interpolation in calibrating the measure of time. Improving the 5th century model of the astronomical sighting tube, Shen Kuo widened its diameter so that the new calibration could observe the pole star indefinitely. This came about due to the position of the pole star shifting in position since the time of Zu Geng in the 5th century, hence Shen Kuo diligently observed the course of the pole star for three months, plotting the data of its course and coming to the conclusion that it had shifted slightly over three degrees. Apparently this astronomical finding had an impact upon the intellectual community in China at the time. Even Shen's political rival and contemporary astronomer Su Song featured Shen's corrected position of the pole star (halfway between Tian shu, at ‚àí350 degrees, and the current Polaris) in the fourth star map of his celestial atlas.Needham (1986), Volume 3, 278. The astronomical phenomena of the solar eclipse and lunar eclipse had been observed in the 4th century BC by astronomers Gan De and Shi Shen; the latter gave instructions on predicting the eclipses based on the relative position of the Moon to the Sun.Needham (1986), Volume 3, 411. The philosopher Wang Chong argued against the 'radiating influence' theory of Jing Fang's writing in the 1st century BC and that of Zhang Heng (78‚Äì139); the latter two correctly hypothesized that the brightness of the Moon was merely light reflected from the Sun.Needham (1986), Volume 3, 413‚Äì414. Jing Fang had written in the 1st century BC of how it was long accepted in China that the Sun and Moon were spherical in shape ('like a crossbow bullet'), not flat.Needham (1986), Volume 3, 227. Shen Kuo also wrote of solar and lunar eclipses in this manner, yet expanded upon this to explain why the celestial bodies were spherical, going against the 'flat earth' theory for celestial bodies.Needham (1986), Volume 3, 415‚Äì416. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Shen Kuo supported a round earth theory, which was introduced into Chinese science by Matteo Ricci and Xu Guangqi in the 17th century.Fan (1996), 431‚Äì432. When the Director of the Astronomical Observatory asked Shen Kuo if the shapes of the Sun and Moon were round like balls or flat like fans, Shen Kuo explained that celestial bodies were spherical because of knowledge of waxing and waning of the Moon. Much like what Zhang Heng had said, Shen Kuo likened the Moon to a ball of silver, which does not produce light, but simply reflects light if provided from another source (the Sun). He explained that when the Sun's light is slanting, the Moon appears full. He then explained if one were to cover any sort of sphere with white powder, and then viewed from the side it would appear to be a crescent, hence he reasoned that celestial bodies were spherical.Dong (2000), 72. He also wrote that, although the Sun and Moon were in conjunction and opposition with each other once a month, this did not mean the Sun would be eclipsed every time their paths met, because of the small obliquity of their orbital paths.Dong (2000), 71‚Äì72. The original diagram of Su Song's book of 1092 showing the inner workings of his clocktower; a mechanically rotated armillary sphere crowns the top. Shen is also known for his cosmological hypotheses in explaining the variations of planetary motions, including retrogradation.Sivin (1995), III, 16. His colleague Wei Pu realized that the old calculation technique for the mean Sun was inaccurate compared to the apparent Sun, since the latter was ahead of it in the accelerated phase of motion, and behind it in the retarded phase.Sivin (1995), III, 19. Shen's hypotheses were similar to the concept of the epicycle in the Greco-Roman tradition, only Shen compared the side-section of orbital paths of planets and variations of planetary speeds to points in the tips of a willow leaf.Sivin (1995), II, 71‚Äì72. In a similar rudimentary physical analogy of celestial motions, as John B. Henderson describes it, Shen likened the relationship of the Moon's path to the ecliptic, the path of the Sun, \\"to the figure of a rope coiled about a tree.\\"Henderson (1986), 128. Along with his colleague Wei Pu in the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo planned to plot out the exact coordinates of planetary and lunar movements by recording their astronomical observations three times a night for a continuum of five years. The Song astronomers of Shen's day still retained the lunar theory and coordinates of the earlier Yi Xing, which after 350 years had devolved into a state of considerable error. Shen criticized earlier Chinese astronomers for failing to describe celestial movement in spatial terms, yet he did not attempt to provide any reasoning for the motive power of the planets or other celestial movements. Shen and Wei began astronomical observations for the Moon and planets by plotting their locations three times a night for what should have been five successive years. The officials and astronomers at court were deeply opposed Wei and Shen's work, offended by their insistence that the coordinates of the renowned Yi Xing were inaccurate.Sivin (1995), III, 18‚Äì19. They also slandered Wei Pu, out of resentment that a commoner had expertise exceeding theirs.Sivin (1995), II, 73. When Wei and Shen made a public demonstration using the gnomon to prove the doubtful wrong, the other ministers reluctantly agreed to correct the lunar and solar errors.Sivin (1995), II, 72. Despite this success, they eventually dismissed Wei and Shen's tables of planetary motions.Sivin (1995), III, 7. Therefore, only the worst and most obvious planetary errors were corrected, and many inaccuracies remained.  Movable type printing  The Chinese Diamond Sutra, the oldest known printed book in world history (868), using woodblock printing. Shen Kuo wrote that during the Qingli reign period (1041‚Äì1048), under Emperor Renzong of Song (1022‚Äì1063), an obscure commoner and artisan known as Bi Sheng (990‚Äì1051) invented ceramic movable type printing.Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 1, 201.Gernet (1996), 335. Although the use of assembling individual characters to compose a piece of text had its origins in antiquity, Bi Sheng's methodical innovation was something completely revolutionary for his time. Shen Kuo noted that the process was tedious if one only wanted to print a few copies of a book, but if one desired to make hundreds or thousands of copies, the process was incredibly fast and efficient. Beyond Shen Kuo's writing, however, nothing is known of Bi Sheng's life or the influence of movable type in his lifetime.Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 1, 202‚Äì203. Although the details of Bi Sheng's life were scarcely known, Shen Kuo wrote: > When Bi Sheng died, his fount of type passed into the possession of my > followers (i.e. one of Shen's nephews), among whom it has been kept as a > precious possession until now.Sivin (1995), III, 27. A revolving table typecase with individual movable type characters arranged primarily by rhyming scheme, from Wang Zhen's book of agriculture published in 1313. There are a few surviving examples of books printed in the late Song Dynasty using movable type printing.Wu (1943), 211‚Äì212. This includes Zhou Bida's Notes of The Jade Hall () printed in 1193 using the method of baked- clay movable type characters outlined in the Dream Pool Essays.Xu Yinong Moveable Type Books () Yao Shu (1201‚Äì1278), an advisor to Kublai Khan, once persuaded a disciple Yang Gu to print philological primers and Neo-Confucian texts by using what he termed the \\"movable type of Shen Kuo\\".Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 1, 203. Wang Zhen (fl. 1290‚Äì1333), who wrote the valuable agricultural, scientific, and technological treatise of the Nong Shu, mentioned an alternative method of baking earthenware type with earthenware frames in order to make whole blocks. Wang Zhen also improved its use by inventing wooden movable type in the years 1297 or 1298, while he was a magistrate of Jingde, Anhui province.Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 1, 206. The earlier Bi Sheng had experimented with wooden movable type,Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 1, 205‚Äì206. but Wang's main contribution was improving the speed of typesetting with simple mechanical devices, along with the complex, systematic arrangement of wooden movable type involving the use of revolving tables.Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 1, 208. Although later metal movable type would be used in China, Wang Zhen experimented with tin metal movable type, but found its use to be inefficient.Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 1, 217. By the 15th century, metal movable type printing was developed in Ming Dynasty China (and earlier in Joseon Korea, by the mid 13th century), and was widely applied in China by at least the 16th century.Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 1, 211. In Jiangsu and Fujian, wealthy Ming era families sponsored the use of metal type printing (mostly using bronze). This included the printing works of Hua Sui (1439‚Äì1513), who pioneered the first Chinese bronze-type movable printing in the year 1490.Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 1, 212. In 1718, during the mid Qing Dynasty (1644‚Äì1912), the scholar of Tai'an known as Xu Zhiding developed movable type with enamelware instead of earthenware. There was also Zhai Jinsheng (b. 1784), a teacher of Jingxian, Anhui, who spent thirty years making a font of earthenware movable type, and by 1844 he had over 100,000 Chinese writing characters in five sizes. Despite these advances, movable type printing never gained the amount of widespread use in East Asia that woodblock printing had achieved since the Chinese Tang Dynasty in the 9th century. With written Chinese, the vast amount of written morpheme characters impeded movable type's acceptance and practical use, and was therefore seen as largely unsatisfactory. Furthermore, the European printing press, first invented by Johannes Gutenberg (1398‚Äì1468), was eventually wholly adopted as the standard in China, yet the tradition of woodblock printing remains popular in East Asian countries still.  Other achievements in science and technology  Shen Kuo described the phenomena of natural predator insects controlling the population of pests, the latter of which had the potential to wreak havoc upon the agricultural base of China.Needham (1986), Volume 6, Part 1, 545. While visiting the iron-producing district at Cizhou in 1075, Shen described the \\"partial decarburization\\" method of reforging cast iron under a cold blast, which Hartwell, Needham, and Wertime state is the predecessor of the Bessemer process.Hartwell (1966), 54. Shen was worried about deforestation due to the needs of the iron industry and ink makers using pine soot in the production process, so he suggested for the latter an alternative of petroleum, which he believed was \\"produced inexhaustibly within the earth\\".Menzies (1994), 24. Shen used the soot from the smoke of burned petroleum fuel (Áü≥Ê≤π Sh√≠y√≥u, \\"rock oil\\" as Shen called it) to invent a new, more durable type of writing ink; the Ming Dynasty pharmacologist Li Shizhen (1518‚Äì1593) wrote that Shen's ink was \\"lustrous like lacquer, and superior to that made from pinewood lamp-black,\\" or the soot from pinewood.Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 7, 75‚Äì76.Deng (2005), 36.  Beliefs and philosophy  Ideas of the philosopher Mencius deeply influenced Shen. Shen Kuo was much in favor of philosophical Daoist notions which challenged the authority of empirical science in his day. Although much could be discerned through empirical observation and recorded study, Daoism asserted that the secrets of the universe were boundless, something that scientific investigation could merely express in fragments and partial understandings.Ropp (1990), 170. Shen Kuo referred to the ancient Daoist I Ching in explaining the spiritual processes and attainment of foreknowledge that cannot be attained through \\"crude traces\\", which he likens to mathematical astronomy. Nathan Sivin proposes that Shen was the first in history to \\"make a clear distinction between our unconnected experiences and the unitary causal world we postulate to explain them,\\" which Biderman and Scharfstein state is arguably inherent in the works of Heraclitus, Plato, and Democritus as well.Biderman & Scharfstein (1989), xvii. Shen was a firm believer in destiny and prognostication, and made rational explanations for the relations between them.Sivin (1995), III, 34‚Äì35. Shen held a special interest in fate, mystical divination, bizarre phenomena, yet warned against the tendency to believe that all matters in life were preordained.Sivin (1995), III, 35. When describing an event where lightning had struck a house and all the wooden walls did not burn (but simply turned black) and lacquerwares inside were fine, yet metal objects had melted into liquid, Shen Kuo wrote: > Most people can only judge of things by the experiences of ordinary life, > but phenomena outside the scope of this are really quite numerous. How > insecure it is to investigate natural principles using only the light of > common knowledge, and subjective ideas.Needham (1986), Volume 3, 482. In his commentary on the ancient Confucian philosopher Mencius (372‚Äì289 BC), Shen wrote of the importance of choosing to follow what one knew to be a true path, yet the heart and mind could not attain full knowledge of truth through mere sensory experience.Sivin (1995), III, 34. In his own unique way but using terms influenced by the ideas of Mencius, Shen wrote of an autonomous inner authority that formed the basis for one's inclination towards moral choices, a concept linked to Shen's life experiences of surviving and obtaining success through self-reliance. Along with his commentary on the Chinese classic texts, Shen Kuo also wrote extensively on the topics of supernatural divination and Buddhist meditation.Ebrey (1999), 148.  Art criticism  A painting by Dong Yuan, who Shen praised for his ability to portray landscapes and natural scenery in a grand but realistic style. As an art critic, Shen criticized the paintings of Li Cheng (919‚Äì967) for failing to observe the principle of \\"seeing the small from the viewpoint of the large\\" in portraying buildings and the like.Needham (1986), Volume 4, 115. He praised the works of Dong Yuan (c. 934‚Äìc. 962); he noted that although a close-up view of Dong's work would create the impression that his brush techniques were cursory, seen from afar his landscape paintings would give the impression of grand, resplendent, and realistic scenery.Stanley-Baker (1977), 23.Barnhart (1970), 25.Li (1965), 61. In addition, Shen's writing on Dong's artworks represents the earliest known reference to the Jiangnan style of painting.Barnhart (1970), 24. In his \\"Song on Painting\\" and in his Dream Pool Essays, Shen praised the creative artworks of the Tang painter Wang Wei (701‚Äì761); Shen noted that Wang was unique in that he \\"penetrated into the mysterious reason and depth of creative activity,\\" but was criticized by others for not conforming his paintings to reality, such as his painting with a banana tree growing in a snowy, wintry landscape.Li (1965), 37‚Äì38, Footnote 98.Li (1974), 149.Parker (1999), 175.  Written works  Much of Shen Kuo's written work was probably purged under the leadership of minister Cai Jing (1046‚Äì1126), who revived the New Policies of Wang Anshi, although he set out on a campaign of attrition to destroy or radically alter the written work of his predecessors and especially Conservative enemies.Chen Dengyuan, cited in Sivin (1995), III, 44. For example, only six of Shen's books remain, and four of these have been significantly altered since the time they were penned by the author.Sivin (1995), III, 44‚Äì45. In modern times, the best attempt at a complete list and summary of Shen's writing was an appendix written by Hu Daojing in his standard edition of Brush Talks, written in 1956.Sivin (1995), III, 44.  Dream Pool Essays  Shen Kuo's Dream Pool Essays consists of some 507 separate essays exploring a wide range of subjects.Bodde (1991), 86. It was Shen's ultimate attempt to comprehend and describe a multitude of various aspects of nature, science, and reality, and all the practical and profound curiosities found in the world. The literal translation of the title, Dream Brook Brush Talks, refers to his Dream Brook estate, where he spent the last years of his life. About the title, he is quoted as saying: \\"Because I had only my writing brush and ink slab to converse with, I call it Brush Talks.\\" The book was originally 30 chapters long, yet an unknown Chinese author's edition of 1166 edited and reorganized the work into 26 chapters.Sivin (1995), III, 45. A passage called \\"Strange Happenings\\" contains a peculiar account of an unidentified flying object.  Other written works  Poet and statesman Su Shi, whose pharmaceutical work was combined with Shen Kuo's in 1126, in a Yuan Dynasty portrait by Zhao Mengfu. Although the Dream Pool Essays is certainly his most extensive and important work, Shen Kuo wrote other books as well. In 1075, Shen Kuo wrote the Xining Fengyuan Li (; The Oblatory Epoch astronomical system of the Splendid Peace reign period), which was lost, but listed in a 7th chapter of a Song Dynasty bibliography.Sivin (1995), III, 46. This was the official report of Shen Kuo on his reforms of the Chinese calendar, which were only partially adopted by the Song court's official calendar system. During his years of retirement from governmental service, Shen Kuo compiled a formulary known as the Liang Fang (; Good medicinal formulas). Around the year 1126 it was combined with a similar collection by the famous Su Shi (1037‚Äì1101), who was ironically a political opponent to Shen Kuo's faction of Reformers and New Policies supporters at court,Sivin (1995), III, 47. yet it was known that Shen Kuo and Su Shi were nonetheless friends and associates.Needham (1986), Volume 1, 137. Shen wrote the Mengqi Wanghuai Lu (; Record of longings forgotten at Dream Brook), which was also compiled during Shen's retirement. This book was a treatise in the working since his youth on rural life and ethnographic accounts of living conditions in the isolated mountain regions of China.Sivin (1995), III, 48. Only quotations of it survive in the Shuo Fu () collection, which mostly describe the agricultural implements and tools used by rural people in high mountain regions. Shen Kuo also wrote the Changxing Ji (; Collected Literary Works of [the Viscount of] Changxing). However, this book was without much doubt a posthumous collection, including various poems, prose, and administrative documents written by Shen. By the 15th century (during the Ming Dynasty), this book was reprinted, yet only the 19th chapter remained. This chapter was reprinted in 1718, yet poorly edited. Finally, in the 1950s the author Hu Daojing supplemented this small yet valuable work with additions of other scattered poems written by Shen, in the former's Collection of Shen Kua's Extant Poetry (Shanghai: Shang-hai Shu-tian, 1958). In the tradition of the popular Song era literary category of 'travel record literature' ('youji wenxue'),Hargett (1985), 67. Shen Kuo also wrote the Register of What Not to Forget, a traveler's guide to what type of carriage is suitable for a journey, the proper foods one should bring, the special clothing one should bring, and many other items.Hargett (1985), 71. In his Sequel to Numerous Things Revealed, the Song author Cheng Dachang (1123‚Äì1195) noted that stanzas prepared by Shen Kuo for military victory celebrations were later written down and published by Shen.Stock (1993), 94. This includes a short poem \\"Song of Triumph\\" by Shen Kuo, who uses the musical instrument mawei huqin ('horse-tail barbarian stringed instrument' or 'horse-tail fiddle'Stock (1993), 108.) of the northwestern Inner Asian nomads as a metaphor for prisoners-of-war led by Song troops: Historian Jonathan Stock notes that the bent bow described in the poem above represents the arched bow used to play the huqin, while the sound of the instrument itself represented the discontent expressed by the prisoners-of-war with their defeated khan.  Legacy   Praise, critique, and criticism  In the Routledge Curzon Encyclopedia of Confucianism, Xinzhong Yao states that Shen Kuo's legacy was tainted by his eager involvement in Wang Anshi's New Policies reforms, his actions criticized in the later traditional histories. However, Shen's reputation as a polymath has been well regarded. The British sinologist, historian, and biochemist Joseph Needham (1900‚Äì1995) stated that Shen Kuo was \\"one of the greatest scientific minds in Chinese history.\\"Fraser & Haber (1986), 226‚Äì227. The French sinologist Jacques Gernet is of the opinion that Shen possessed an \\"amazingly modern mind.\\"Gernet (1996), 338. Yao states of Shen's thorough recording of natural sciences in his Dream Pool Essays: > We must regard Shen Kuo's collection as an indispensable primary source > attesting to the unmatched level of attainment achieved by Chinese science > prior to the twelfth century.Yao (2003), 545. However, Toby E. Huff writes that Shen Kuo's \\"scattered set\\" of writings lacks clear-cut organization and \\"theoretical acuteness,\\" that is, scientific theory.Huff (2003), 303. Nathan Sivin wrote that Shen's originality stands \\"cheek by jowl with trivial didacticism, court anecdotes, and ephemeral curiosities\\" that provide little insight. Donald Holzman writes that Shen \\"has nowhere organized his observations into anything like a general theory.\\" Huff writes that this was a systemic problem of early Chinese science, which lacked systematic treatment that could be found in European works such as the Concordance and Discordant Canons by the lawyer Gratian of Bologna (fl. 12th century). In regard to an overarching concept of science which could branch together all the various sciences studied by the Chinese, Sivin asserts that the writings of Shen Kuo \\"do not indicate that he achieved, or even sought, an integrated framework for his diverse knowledge; the one common thread is the varied responsibilities of his career as a high civil servant.\\"Sivin (1988), 59.  Burial and posthumous honors  Upon his death, Shen Kuo was interred in a tomb in Yuhang District of Hangzhou, at the foot of the Taiping Hill. Yuhang Cultural Network (October 2003). Shen Kuo's Tomb The Yuhang District of Hangzhou Cultural Broadcasting Press and Publications Bureau. Retrieved on 2007-05-06. His tomb was eventually destroyed, yet Ming Dynasty records indicated its location, which was found in 1983 and protected by the government in 1986. The remnants of the tomb's brick structure remained, along with Song Dynasty glasswares and coins. The Hangzhou Municipal Committee completed a restoration of Shen's tomb in September 2001. In addition to his tomb, Shen Kuo's Mengxi garden estate, his former two-acre (8,000 m¬≤) property in Zhenjiang, was restored by the government in 1985. Zhenjiang.gov (October 2006). Talking Park The Zhenjiang municipal government office. Retrieved on 2007-05-07. However, the renovated Mengxi Garden is only part of the original of Shen Kuo's time. The Zhenjiang Foreign Experts Bureau (June 2002). Mengxi Garden The Zhenjiang Foreign Experts Bureau. Retrieved on 2007-05-07. A Qing Dynasty era hall built on the site is now used as the main admissions gate. In the Memorial Hall of the gardens, there is a large painting depicting the original garden of Shen Kuo's time, including wells, green bamboo groves, stone-paved paths, and decorated walls of the original halls. In this exhibition hall there stands a 1.4 m (4.6 ft) tall statue of Shen Kuo sitting on a platform, along with centuries-old published copies of his Dream Pool Essays in glass cabinets, one of which is from Japan. At the garden estate there are also displayed marble banners, statues of Shen Kuo, and a model of an armillary sphere; a small museum gallery depicts Shen's various achievements. The Purple Mountain Observatory in Nanjing discovered a new asteroid in 1964 and named it after Shen Kuo (2027 Shen Guo).

Struth is one of the most successful managers in Scottish and British football history, winning 30 major trophies in his career; a record 18 Scottish league championships, 10 Scottish Cups and two Scottish League Cups. Career Struth was born in Leith, Edinburgh, the eldest child of William Struth senior, a stonemason, and Isabella Cunningham.David Mason and Ian Stewart, \\"Mr Struth: The Boss\\" (Headline, 2013), p. 18. Struth grew up in Edinburgh and Milnathort (his father's birthplace) in Kinross-shire. Struth worked as a stonemason, but he also competed as a professional runner until he was in his 30s. In the early 1900s he began helping to train the players at his local football club, Heart of Midlothian F.C., and in 1908 he moved to Glasgow to become the trainer at Clyde.David Mason and Ian Stewart, \\"Mr Struth: The Boss\\" (Headline, 2013), p. 25. Struth moved to Rangers in 1914 to take up the position of assistant manager. At the age of 45, in 1920, he took over as manager after his predecessor William Wilton was drowned in a boating accident off Gourock. Struth went on to win the league title 18 times as manager, winning 14 titles in 19 years before the Second World War. This included winning five titles in a row between 1927 and 1931. Struth's tenure as manager spanned the club's first league and cup double in 1928, when Rangers lifted the Scottish Cup and ended a 25-year 'hoodoo', and its first treble in 1949, Struth becoming the first Scottish manager to achieve this honour. If wartime and local competitions (7 wartime league championships, 19 Glasgow Cups, 17 Glasgow Merchant Charity Cups and other wartime cups) are included, Struth won a total of 73 trophies during his career, making him the most decorated manager in British football history. Struth was renowned as a disciplinarian, insisting that the team wore a collar and tie when turning up for training; bowler hats were obligatory for Rangers players. Adam Little was signed by Struth and this interview gives an insight into his methods. In 1947, Struth became a Rangers director and was then appointed vice-chairman after retiring in 1954. In 1952 he had part of a leg amputated as a result of gangrene. He died on 21 September 1956, aged 81, at his home in Dumbreck and is buried in Craigton Cemetery, overlooking Ibrox Park. His wife, Catherine Forbes, predeceased him in 1941. The grave lies in the south-west section on a terrace on its north side. Recognition In 2005, Rangers' chairman Sir David Murray unveiled a bronze bust of Bill Struth, located in the Main Stand at Ibrox, now known as the \\"Bill Struth Main Stand\\" in honour of his contribution to Rangers Football Club. In 2016 a further memorial was placed at his grave listing his club achievements.  Famous quotes  When being presented with the portrait that now hangs in the Ibrox trophy room, Bill Struth said: Managerial Honours  Club  ;Rangers * Scottish League (18): 1920-21, 1922‚Äì23, 1923‚Äì24, 1924‚Äì25, 1926‚Äì27, 1927‚Äì28, 1928‚Äì29, 1929‚Äì30, 1930‚Äì31, 1932‚Äì33, 1933‚Äì34, 1934‚Äì35, 1936‚Äì37, 1938‚Äì39, 1946‚Äì47, 1948‚Äì49, 1949‚Äì50, 1952‚Äì53 * Scottish Cup (10): 1927-28, 1929‚Äì30, 1931‚Äì32, 1933‚Äì34, 1934‚Äì35, 1935‚Äì36, 1947‚Äì48, 1949‚Äì50, 1952‚Äì53 * Scottish League Cup (2): 1946-47, 1948‚Äì49  Individual  * 5th most decorated manager of all time (30 trophies)The ranking only includes trophies of at least national level References *  Further reading  * Mason, David., Stewart, Ian.

It has the capacity to further express an individuals identity and personality as there are accessories that come in different, shapes, sizes, hues etc. The term came into use in the 20th century. Types Fashion accessories can be loosely categorized into two general areas: those that are carried and those that are worn. Traditionally carried accessories include purses and handbags, hand fans, parasols and umbrellas, wallets, canes, and ceremonial swords. Accessories that are worn may include jackets, boots and shoes, cravats, ties, hats, bonnets, belts and suspenders, gloves, muffs, necklaces, bracelets, watches, eyewear, sashes, shawls, scarves, lanyards, socks, pins, piercings, rings, and stockings. The type of accessory that an individual chooses to wear or carry to complement their outfit can be determined by several factors including the specific context of where the individual is going. For example, if an individual is going to work their choice of accessory would differ to one who is going out to drinks or dinner thus depending on work or play different accessories would be chosen. Similarly, an individual's economical status, religious and cultural background would also be a contributing factor. History In Victorian fashion accessories such as fans, parasols and gloves held significance for how women experienced gender, race, and class. In this era, there was a trend for women to adopt, or aspire to, a more leisurely lifestyle. Consequently, gloves were often used by women to cover their hands and mask any signs of labour. Also, in the early 16th century in Italy hat badges were worn by civilian men of higher social status as a decorative item, in imitation of the cap badges worn by the invading military. Hat badges were often worn in conjunction with a decorative sword and hilt. Hat badges were fashioned after plaquettes and often depicted a scene with personal relevance to the wearer.  Present trends  As time has progressed fashion accessories have become more and more prominent in the immediate fashion world ranging from the runway to street wear. Today's generation of fashionistas has adopted a new way of wearing certain items to complete an outfit. Celebrities such as A$AP Rocky and Lil Uzi Vert have a unique style and have redefined what it means to wear an accessory. Many hurdles were cleared this year in the fashion world by icons such as Kanye West and Virgil Abloh, bringing freshness and innovation to the fashion industry. Virgil Abloh, CEO of Off-White and creative designer for Louis Vuitton, has paved a way for many trends to take off due to his usage of them in his runway shows consisting of the new \\"Dad Shoe\\" trend that's catching on quickly throughout many other big names such as Gucci and Balenciaga. Some other accessories that have gained popularity this year are side bags, clout glasses, long coats, and plaid designed articles. Although these trends are currently popular, fashion is an ever-changing field that adapts to its inhabitants. The future of fashion is always exciting and is credited with creating the most bizarre trends that seem to find its way to the closets of every inner city fashion enthusiast.

Dubbed the \\"King of Rumba Rock\\", he was one of the most popular musicians of his time in Africa and played an important role in world music. He was also a fashion icon who popularized the Sape look and style through his musical group Viva la Musica,Andreas Preuss (24 April 2016). with whom he performed on stages throughout the world.Margalit Fox (25 April 2016). Musical history Papa Wemba's road to fame and prominence began when he joined the music group Zaiko Langa Langa in the late 1960s. This was followed by his success as a founding member both of Isifi Lokole and then Yoka Lokole,\\"Both groups used the lokole, a hollow tree trunk played with two sticks, as a rhythmic foundation\\" along with a short stint as a member of Afrisa International for a few months. During these early stages of his career, he was establishing a style that included traditional Congolese rumba and soukous, infused with traditional African sounds, Caribbean rhythms, rock and soul. But Wemba gained international success and status with his band Viva La Musica, especially after he took them to Paris, France in the early 1980s. It was there that Wemba was able to achieve more of an \\"eclectic sound\\" in his work, influenced by western popular music that reflected a European flavor and style, referred to as \\"Europop.\\" Wemba spoke about this transition in his music during a 2004 interview: Zaiko Langa Langa Papa Wemba was one of the first musicians to join the influential rock-rumba band Zaiko Langa Langa (ZLL) after it was created in December 1969 in Kinshasa, by many well-known Congolese musicians including Nyoka Longo Jossart and Bimi Ombale, among others. He remained with the group for four years. Papa Wemba (then known as Jules Presley Shungu Wembadio) helped contribute to the success of Zaiko Langa Langa so that, by 1973, it was one of the more successful Congolese groups. By that time, ZLL's shows and performances featured a string of their popular hits, some of them written by Wemba. The latter included \\"Pauline\\", \\"C'est La V√©rit√©\\", \\"Chouchouna\\", and \\"Liwa Ya Somo\\". Zaiko Langa Langa had gained a strong and popular following even in a Congolese musical world that, in those days, was already dominated by various musical acts including Franco Luambo and his band TPOK Jazz, or Tabu Ley Rochereau's various ensembles. ZLL was also vying for an audience with other (at the time) new musical acts such as Bella-Bella and Empire Bakuba. Note: this website is in French (top of the page) and English (bottom of the page). Isifi Lokole In December 1974, at the pinnacle of their fame (and just a month after the Rumble in the Jungle between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in Kinshasa), Papa Wemba (usually called 'Shungu Wembadio' at this point in his career) along with Evoloko Lay Lay, Mavuela Somo and Bozi Boziana, left Zaiko Langa Langa to establish their own musical ensemble Isifi Lokole. Wemba later claimed that ISIFI was an acronym for \\"Institut du Savoir Ideologique pour la Formation des Idoles,\\" a claim that has still not been given total credence. In July 1975, Shungu Wembadio officially adopted the soon-to-be-well-known-worldwide name Papa Wemba. The \\"Papa\\" (father) part of his name had already been given to him as a traditional and cultural rite because he was his mother's first-born son. But in assuming a new name and public persona, \\"Papa\\" was now re-emphasized as an allusion to the demanding family responsibilities that Wemba assumed at very young age, since both parents were now deceased: Wemba's father in 1966, followed by his mother in 1973. Isifi Lokole would only last a year together as a group, with the single \\"Amazone\\" (a Wemba composition) as its biggest commercial \\"hit\\" record. Yoka Lokole In November 1975, Papa Wemba, Mavuela Somo and Bozi Boziana left Isifi Lokole to create the group Yoka Lokole (also known as The Kinshasa's Wa Fania All-Stars). Yoka Lokole contributed to the African pop music wave with their hit songs including \\"Matembele Bangui\\", \\"Lisuma ya Zazu\\" (Papa Wemba), \\"Mavuela Sala Keba\\", and \\"Bana Kin\\" (Mavuela Somo). Like Isifi Lokole, the electronic-instrument-driven Yoka Lokole would not last much longer than a year. After a year of modest success, controversies within Yoka Lokole over money and prestige were also complicated by Wemba's arrest and brief incarceration in Kinshasa Central prison in December 1976 when he was suspected of having a relationship with army general's daughter. The band continued to tour without Papa Wemba. For whatever reason (or reasons), whether it was personal or professional (with one source speculating that he was perhaps feeling diminished in the public's eye), by 1977 Wemba had formed a new group, and called it Viva la Musica. Viva la Musica In 1977‚Äì78, back home now in the Matonge neighborhood of Kinshasa, Papa Wemba set out to create his group Viva la Musica. This new band's name was suggested to him in 1974, when he attended a concert in Kinshasa that featured the New York-based Latinos, Fania All-Stars. During the concert, one of the singers would shout to the audience \\"Viva La Musica!\\" to an enthusiastic response. Wemba's vision was to structure Viva la Musica around young, talented but largely unknown artists, including the singers Prince Esp√©rant, Jadot \\"le Cambodgien\\" Sombele, Debaba el Shabab, Pepe Bipoli and Petit Aziza, and various guitarists such as Rigo Star, Syriana, and Bongo Wende. The new group included the traditional instrument lokole. There was also an associated dance, the mukonyonyo, as well as a fashion style. The band achieved immediate success and, during their first year performing together, the Kinshasa newspaper Elima named the band \\"best orchestra\\" and their single, \\"M√®re Sup√©rieure,\\" best song. During the following three years, Viva la Musica built on these initial accolades with more hit songs including \\"Moku Nyon Nyon\\", \\"Nyekesse Migue'l\\", and \\"Cou Cou Dindon\\". As time went by, it was revealed that Antoine Agbepa was the unknown writer of many of these songs, when Papa Wemba said, \\"Ooh! l'homme id√©e\\" (Oh! the idea-man!), thereby on-the-spot renaming the impressive young singer- songwriter Koffi Olomide ‚Äì and the name stuck. After his success already with three influential groups, in 1977 Papa Wemba established a kind of commune for musicians. To accomplish this, he used his family home (on Kanda-Kanda street) as a fashionable gathering place for Matonge youths. He named it \\"Village Molokai\\" and declared himself to be its tribal chief (chef coutumier). Move to Paris Beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Wemba (both by himself and with Viva la Musica) started traveling to Paris, believing there was a potentially wider audience for the music he had been helping to create during the preceding decade. As Wemba biographer Craig Harris put it: By the late 1980s and early 1990s, Wemba's style was more readily identifiable even as it had become an amalgamation of rumba, soukous and ndombolo, Latin and rock, melded to a European-oriented pop style. But still wanting to expand their musical horizons, and move in new musical directions, Viva la Musica took on a dual-identity. Wemba now maintained one group in Kinshasa (called at times \\"Nouvelle Ecriture\\", \\"Nouvel Ecrita\\" and then again \\"Viva la Musica\\") and another one in Paris (\\"Nouvelle Generation,\\" \\"La Cour des Grands\\" and now \\"Viva Tendance\\"). The group consistently maintained a high profile in world music with hits like \\"Le Voyageur\\" (1992), \\"Emotion\\" (1995), \\"Pole Position\\" (1996) and \\"Somo Trop\\" (October 2003). By this time, Wemba's use of African, Cuban and Western influences was not only one of Africa's most popular music styles, it was crossing cultural boundaries and attracting a more diverse audience outside of Africa. In 1993, Wemba joined with Peter Gabriel for the latter's Secret World Live tour, and this drew attention to Wemba's unique style and groundbreaking sound. The aforementioned Emotion album, released in 1995, showed that he was achieving a global following. This album appeared under Peter Gabriel's Real World record label, and sold more than 100,000 copies. Legal troubles In February 2003, Wemba was suspected of being involved in a network that had allegedly smuggled hundreds of illegal immigrants from the Democratic Republic of the Congo into Europe. At that point he was arrested in Paris and held while awaiting a trial. He then spent three-and-a-half months in prison until a ‚Ç¨30,000 bail was posted (some reports claimed it was paid by the Congolese government). Wemba was released in June 2003, an experience that, upon his release, he declared had had a profound psychological effect on him. The singer claimed to have undergone a spiritual conversion in jail and even recounted this episode on his album Somo Trop (released in October 2003). On the song \\"Num√©ro d'√©crou\\", he recalled the day \\"God\\" paid a visit to his cell. In 2004, he was convicted in France, fined and given a suspended prison sentence. Wemba returned to the Congo in 2006. Cultural influence In 1979, Papa Wemba became the unofficial leader of La Sape (Soci√©t√© des Ambianceurs et des Personnes d'√âl√©gance, literally translated as the \\"Society of Atmosphere-setters and Elegant People\\") which he promoted as a youth subculture in Zaire. Their style was influenced by the fashion centres of Paris and Milan. Wemba said: > The Sapeur cult promoted high standards of personal cleanliness, hygiene and > smart dress, to a whole generation of youth across Zaire. When I say well > groomed, well shaved, well perfumed, it's a characteristic that I am > insisting on among the young. I don't care about their education, since > education always comes first of all from the family. After Wemba's death, Cameroonian saxophonist Manu Dibango told the BBC during an interview: Papa Wemba's impact on the culture is also reflected by his influence on a new generation of musicians and performers. For example, Priyan Weerappuli (leader of the Sri Lankan group Pahan Silu) referred to Wemba as being among his greatest musical influences. Weerappuli claims that he was first introduced to Wemba's music in 2004 and was \\"deeply inspired by the free rhythms demonstrated by Wemba's Soukous style\\" and, from that point, \\"began experimenting with these rhythms in his own compositions.\\" Many others paid tribute to Papa Wemba's legacy after his death in April 2016. Some of them included not only Koffi Olomide and Manu Dibango (both mentioned previously), but musicians King Kikii and Femi Kuti, along with soccer star Samuel Eto'o (among others) gave testimony to his lasting influence on them. Film work Papa Wemba got some attention as a movie actor, primarily because he played the male lead role in a very successful Zairean film La Vie est Belle (Life is Beautiful) [1987] by Belgian director Beno√Æt Lamy and Congolese producer- director Ngangura Mweze. Wemba made another kind of contribution to cinema, thanks to his work on the soundtracks for Children of Men, Besieged, and Black Mic Mac. Wemba is also credited as \\"composer\\" of the scores for the films Identity Pieces, Macadam tribu, along with Life is Beautiful.. During his life, Wemba acted in a few more successful films, although he played only minor roles. As recently as 2012, he had a cameo role in the Belgian drama film Kinshasa Kids. Beyond the impact of his important role in Life is Beautiful, there are his many music videos and recorded band performances. Also, Wemba is featured (as himself) in many documentary films which were generally well received including; The Importance of Being Elegant, The Real World of Peter Gabriel and The African Rock 'n' Roll Years (all television) documentaries). Death Wemba died at the age of 66 after collapsing on stage in Abidjan, C√¥te d'Ivoire, during the FEMUA urban music festival on Sunday, 24 April 2016. On Monday, 25 April, it was reported that his widow, Mama-Marie Luzolo Amazone, flew to Abidjan \\"accompanied by family members and government officials.\\" In Wemba's hometown of Kinshasa, both fellow musicians and fans gathered together as a tribute to his legacy. Similar tributes also took place in Paris, London, Brussels and Nairobi. Selected discography Note: Papa Wemba was part of more than 35 album recordings.

A political satire on contemporary Athens, it features the personified god of wealth Plutus. Reflecting the development of Old Comedy towards New Comedy, it uses such familiar character types as the stupid master and the insubordinate slave to attack the morals of the time. Plot The play features an elderly Athenian citizen, Chremylos, and his slave Cario or Carion. Chremylos presents himself and his family as virtuous but poor, and has accordingly gone to seek advice from an oracle. The play begins as he returns to Athens from Delphi, having been instructed by Apollo to follow the first man he meets and persuade him to come home with him. That man turns out to be the god Plutus ‚Äî who is, contrary to all expectations, a blind beggar. After much argument, Plutus is convinced to enter Chremylos's house, where he will have his vision restored, meaning that \\"wealth\\" will now go only to those who deserve it in one way or another. The first part of the play examines the idea that wealth is not distributed to the virtuous, or necessarily to the non-virtuous, but instead it is distributed randomly. Chremylos is convinced that if Plutus's eyesight can be restored, these wrongs can be righted, making the world a better place. The second part introduces the goddess Penia (Poverty). She counters Chremylos's arguments that it is better to be rich by arguing that without poverty there would be no slaves (as every slave would buy his freedom) and no fine goods or luxury foods (as nobody would work if everyone were rich). After Plutus's eyesight is restored at the Temple of Asclepius, he formally becomes a member of Chremylos's household. At the same time, the entire world is turned upside-down economically and socially. Unsurprisingly, this gives rise to rancorous comments and claims of unfairness from those who have been deprived of their riches. In the end, the messenger god Hermes arrives to inform Chremylos and his family of the gods' anger. As in Aristophanes's The Birds, the gods have been starved of sacrifices, since human beings have all directed their attention to Plutus, and they no longer pay homage to the traditional Olympian gods. Hermes, worried about his own predicament, actually offers to work for the mortals and enters Chremylos's house as a servant on those conditions. Performance history Plutus was one of the first Greek plays to be performed using the new (post-Reformation) pronunciation of Greek diphthong developed by John Cheke and Thomas Smith during the 1530s, when it was enacted at St John's College, Cambridge.J.

He served as Minister for Finance from 2004 to 2006, Minister for Policy Coordination and State Secretary and Chief of Staff to Prime Minister G√∂ran Persson 1997-2002. Today he serves as Chairman of the Third Swedish National Pension Fund (AP3), one of Sweden's leading pension companies AMFhttps://www.amf.se/in-english/board-of-directors-and-management-team/ and Hems√∂,http://www.hemso.se/en/about/corporate-governance/styrelse/ and on the board of several Nordic private companies. P√§r Nuder is also Senior Counselor at Albright Stonebridge Grouphttp://www.albrightstonebridge.com/team/p√§r-nuder and Industrial Advisor to the private equity firm EQT Partners.http://www.eqt.se/Organization/Industrial-Advisors/ Biography P√§r Nuder grew up in √ñster√•ker, where he still resides. His father, Ants Nuder, was one of the numerous Estonian refugees who fled to Sweden to escape the Soviet invasion at the end of World War II. During his childhood, P√§r Nuder spent several summers in Israel, which has resulted in a strong personal commitment to the Middle East peace process. Educated at Stockholm University, Nuder has a Bachelor of Laws degree. Career Politics His political path began in the local Swedish Social Democratic Youth League club. From 1986 to 1989 he was the chairman of the Stockholm County branch of the organisation and from 1987 to 1990 he was a member of the national board. At the same time he was a member of the √ñster√•ker Municipal Executive Committee, from 1982 to 1994. In 1986 he started his career as a political adviser, first to the Minister for Justice (before being forced to resign in October 1987 as a result of the political fallout of the Soviet spy Stig Bergling's escape from custody) and later to the Prime Minister, first to Ingvar Carlsson and later to his successor, G√∂ran Persson. For a few years he also worked as a political secretary to the Social Democratic parliamentary party group. In 1994 he was elected a Member of Parliament. In 1997 he was offered the position of State Secretary in the Prime Minister's Office. Although he was more or less unknown to the general public at the time, he was generally believed to be G√∂ran Persson's close ally and one of his personal favourites to succeed him as party leader and Prime Minister. This impression was further strengthened by Persson's move to let Nuder join his Cabinet as Minister for Policy Coordination in 2002, an influential behind-the-scenes post. When Marita Ulvskog stepped down as Minister for Culture in September 2004 he took over the portfolio, although it was explicitly stated that this was not a long-term solution. The Prime Minister's intentions instead became public on 21 October 2004, when G√∂ran Persson announced a restructuring of his government in which P√§r Nuder was to take over as Minister of Finance after Bosse Ringholm. Responding to media questions on whether his plan was to be the next Prime Minister, he simply answered that he did not \\"think about it\\" and was concentrating on his tasks as Minister of Finance. He also restated the government's goal to get the rate of open unemployment below four percent again. In December 2004 he introduced the controversial term \\"K√∂ttberg\\" (\\"Mountain of meat\\") to describe the baby boomer generation (born in the 1940s) during a speech. This speech addressed the potential pension bomb Sweden is facing. During early 2008, he lost his position as Social Democratic candidate for Finance Minister due to quarrels with party leader Mona Sahlin. Nuder himself replied: \\"If she [Mona Sahlin] believes there is another person better suited to speak for the economic policy of Social Democracy in Sweden, then I won't hesitate to step aside for that person\\". He was succeeded as economic advisor for the Social Democratic party and its alternative for Finance Minister for the election in 2010 by Thomas √ñstros, earlier Minister of Education. Private Sector P√§r Nuder is currently Chairman of The Third National Pension Fund (AP3) and board member of several private companies in Sweden. He is also Senior Counselor of the global strategy firm Albright Stonebridge Group, advising clients on global financial trends and providing strategic advice to clients seeking to enter the European market. He is also advisor to the private equity fund EQT, several other Nordic companies and member of The President's Advisory Council, Tokyo University. He is a columnist at the business newspaper Dagens industri and has written an autobiography called Stolt men inte n√∂jd: en k√§rleksf√∂rklaring till politiken.https://www.adlibris.com/se/bok/stolt-men-inte-nojd-en- karleksforklaring-till-politiken-9789113021058 References External links Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:People from T√§by Municipality Category:Swedish people of Estonian descent Category:Swedish Social Democratic Party politicians Category:Swedish Ministers for Finance Category:Stockholm University alumni Category:Members of the Riksdag 2002‚Äì2006 ","title":"P√§r Nuder"},{"id":"1102132","text":"Cadalso is a small village in the west of Spain, near Portugal.

He is one of the most prominent of the sixty-three Nayanars, Tamil Saiva bhakti saints who lived between the sixth and the tenth centuries CE. Sambandar's hymns to Shiva were later collected to form the first three volumes of the Tirumurai, the religious canon of Tamil Saiva Siddhanta. He was a contemporary of Appar, another Saiva saint.Encyclopaedia of Jainism, Volume 1, page 5468 Life Amirthakadaieeshwarar temple relief depicting Appar bearing Sambandar's palanquin Information about Sambandar comes mainly from the Periya Puranam, the eleventh-century Tamil book on the Nayanars that forms the last volume of the Tirumurai, along with the earlier Tiruttondartokai, poetry by Sundarar and Nambiyandar Nambi's Tiru Tondar Tiruvandadi. A Sanskrit hagiography called Brahmapureesa Charitam is now lost. The first volumes of the Tirumurai contain three hundred and eighty-four poems of Sambandar, all that survive out of a reputed more than 10,000 hymns.The History and Culture of the Indian People: The classical age, page 330 According to the ancient texts, Sambandar was born to Sivapada Hrudiyar and his wife Bhagavathiar who lived in Sirkazhi in what is now Tamil Nadu. They were Saivite brahmins. When Sambandar was three years old his parents took him to the Shiva temple where Shiva and his consort Parvati appeared before the child. His father saw drops of milk on the child's mouth and asked who had fed him, whereupon the boy pointed to the sky and responded with the song Todudaya Seviyan, the first verse of the Tevaram. At his investiture with the sacred thread, at the age of seven, he is said to have expounded the Vedas with great clarity. Sambandar attained liberation (mukti) in \\"Mulam Nakshtara\\" in the Tamil month of \\"Vaigasi\\" at the age of sixteen soon after his marriage. In the first half of the seventh century, apart from Saivism, Jainism and Buddhism were among the popular faiths in south India. The Pandyan King Koon Pandiyan had converted to Jainism, which Sambandar had long expressed opposition to. His queen Mangayarkkarasiyar invited Sambandhar after the king fell ill.Hymns of the Tamil ≈öaivite saints, page 11 According to a Saivite legend, Sambandar performed music for the king, which cured the king's disease. Later, Sambandar reconverted the king back to Shaivism. The legend goes on to state that with Sambandar's consent, the king impaled around 8000 Jains. The ancient texts say that Sambandar brought two people back to life by singing hymns to them. One of those resurrected was the daughter of a business man, who offered her to Sambandar in marriage. He declined due to knowledge that he would soon die. At the age of 16, he is said to have attained salvation along with his bride during the marriage ceremony.

Temples revered Paadal Petra Sthalams are 275 temples that are revered in the verses of Tevaram and are amongst the greatest Shiva temples of the continent. Vaippu Sthalangal are places that were mentioned casually in the songs in Tevaram.International review for the history of religions, Volumes 15-17. International Association for the History of Religions, CatchWord (Online service) The focus of the moovars (first three poets) hymns suggests darshan (seeing and being seen by God) within the puja (worship) offering. The hymnists made classificatory lists of places like katu (for forest), turai (port or refuge), kulam (water tank) and kalam (field) being used - thus both structured and unstructured places in the religious context find a mention in Tevaram.Prentiss 1992, pp. 51-52 Tirumurai in worship services chola bronze, 12th century India, Freer Gallery of Art, Washington DC Tirumurai was one of the sole reasons for converting Vedic ritual to Agamic puja followed in Shiva temples. Though these two systems are overlapping, Agamic tradition ensures the perpetuation of the Vedic religion's emphasis on the efficacy of ritual as per Davis.Cort 1998, p. 176 Odhuvars, Sthanikars, or Kattalaiyars offer musical programmes in Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu by singing Tevaram after the daily rituals.Ghose 1996, p. 239 These are usually carried out as chorus programme soon after the divine offering. The singing of Tevaram was followed by musicals from the music pillars in such temples like Madurai Meenakshi Amman Temple, Nellaiappar Temple and Suchindram.Bhargava 2006, p. 467 The singers of these hymns were referred as Tirupadiyam Vinnapam seyvar or Pidarar, from the inscriptions of Nandivarman III in the Tiruvallam Bilavaneswara temple records. Rajaraja deputed 48 pidarars and made liberal provisions for their maintenance and successors.Vasudevan 2003, p. 13 A few earlier records give details about the gifts rendered to the singers of Tevaram from Parantaka I of the 8th century.Vasudevan 2003, pp. 109-110 A record belonging to Rajendra I mentions Tevaranayakan, the supervisor of Tevaram and shows the institutionalisation of Tevaram with the establishment of a department. There are records from Kulothunga Chola III from Nallanyanar temple in South Arcot indicating singing of Tiruvempavai and Tiruvalam of Manickavasagar during special occasion in the temple. From the 13th century, the texts were passed on to the Odhuvars by the Adheenams or charitable establishments. The charitable establishments that ran on philanthropy of individuals and merchant caravans had come to be because after the 13th century, the time of ancient nation states viz. cholas etc. was finished, and the temples became only denominated, voluntary, charitable places. This is briefed by a 15th-century, chidambaram temple inscription. During the time of cholas etc. the temple hymn service workers were known as uvacchar and marars. These terms are of very ancient origin and traceable to even early sangam times. Periya Puranam, the eleventh-century Tamil book on the Nayanars that forms the last volume of the Tirumurai primarily had references only to Tevaram and subsequently expanded to 12 parts and is one of the first anthologies of Tirumurai.Prentiss 1992, p. 140 One of the first anthologies of moovars hymns called the Tevara Arulmuraitirattu is linked to Tamil Saiva siddhantha philosophy by grouping ninety-nine verses into 10 categories. The category headings are God, soul, bond, grace,divine initiation, methodology, enlightenment, bliss, mantra and liberation - correspond to Umapthi's work, Tiruvarutpayan. Tirumurai kanda puranam is another anthology for Tirumurai as a whole, but primarily focuses on Tevaram. It is the first of the works to refer the collection of volumes as Tirumurai.Prentiss 1992, p. 144 Review and analysis There is strong dose of anti-Jain, anti-Buddhist and in general an anti-communal polemic in Tevaram poetry of Sambandar. This is only expected as we know from accounts as to how the saint was got incarnate out to destroy the excessive wickedness and duplicity perpetrated by rogue creeds. Sambandar is clear about his hatred for the evil and duplicity of the obscure communal creeds and the same opinion is expressed in the works of other divine incarnates of that period of both saiva and vaishnava pathways.Das 2005, p.32Cort 1998, p. 213 According to Aiyangar, Manickavasagar's Tiruvackam partakes the characters of Tevaram hymners before him and express more intense form of devotion. Manikkavasagar, like Sundarar and Sambandar before him does not mince words while criticising the misinformation campaign of Sramana (Buddhist and Jain) communal creeds and in many places of Tiruvasagam calls them senseless, duplicitous, deceitful and falseful (poy samayattar).Aiyangar 2004, p. 174 The fervor of utterances, the appeals to God by the Tamils do not find clear expression in other part of India.Eliot, p. 172 Sambandar's stone image is worshiped in almost all Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu. A Chola bronze of Sambandar with a height of in standing posture dated to about 12th century was found in Velankanni in Nagapattinam district. He is sported with catura posture with his feat on Padmasana and he is sported with jewels around his neck. Another image found in Tiruindalur in dancing posture with a height of dated 1150 has Sambandar sported with his right feet over a pedestal. Both the bronze images are stored in the Bronze gallery in Government Museum, Chennai. In 1921, an English translation of Sambandhar's hymns was done by Francis Kingsbury and GE Phillips, both of United Theological College, Bangalore (Edited by Fred Goodwill) and published in a book as Hymns of the Tamil ≈öaivite Saints, by the Oxford University Press Notes References      * External links * Festivals of Mylapore By Sambandar *Kolaru Pathigam meaning Category:644 births Category:660 deaths Category:Nayanars ","title":"Sambandar"},{"id":"1102138","text":"Monsieur N. is a 2003 British-French film directed by Antoine de Caunes.

The asteroid was discovered on 31 August 1973, by Russian astronomer Tamara Smirnova at Crimean Astrophysical Observatory, Nauchnyj, on the Crimean peninsula. It was named after Lyubov Kosmodemyanskaya, mother of Soviet heroes Zoya and Aleksandr.  Classification and orbit  Kosmodemyanskaya orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 2.1‚Äì2.9 AU once every 3 years and 10 months (1,402 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.16 and an inclination of 5¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid was first identified as at Turku Observatory in 1944. Its first used observation is a precovery taken at Palomar Observatory in 1956, extending the body's observation arc by 17 years prior to the official discovery observation at Nauchnyj.  Physical characteristics  Kosmodemyanskaya has been characterized as a stony S-type asteroid.  Lightcurves  The first rotational lightcurve was obtained by American astronomer Richard P. Binzel during a photometric survey of small main-belt asteroids in the 1980s. It showed a rotation period of 4.4 hours with a brightness variation of 0.09 magnitude (). In November 2004, another lightcurve of Kosmodemyanskaya was obtained by French amateur astronomer Laurent Bernasconi. Lightcurve analysis gave a period of 10 hours with an amplitude of 0.05 magnitude ().  Diameter and albedo  According to the survey carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Kosmodemyanskaya measures 4.843 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an exceptionally high albedo of 0.522, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 8.93 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 12.61.  Naming  This minor planet was named in memory of social worker Lyubov Kosmodemyanskaya (1900‚Äì1978), mother of Soviet heroes Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya and Aleksandr Kosmodemyansky. The minor planets 1793 Zoya and 1977 Shura, pet name for Aleksandr, were named after the two. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 1 April 1980 ().

With a total area of , this means a population density of . Main sights The Parroquial Mayor, Cuba's oldest church, in Sancti Spiritus center The Parroquial Mayor is located two blocks south of the town's main square; it is a venerable green-towered church whose early 16th-century origins make it the country's oldest. Nearby is the Museo de Arte Colonial (Colonial Art Museum), one of Sancti Sp√≠ritus's most attractive colonial homes and a standout attraction. The opulent former palatial mansion of the Valle Iznaga clan, one of Cuba's most elite families who fled Cuba after Fidel's Revolution, it became the property of the state in 1961. Ninety percent of what you see inside, from furniture to paintings, is original. Though the family obviously kept an impressive collection of Limoges porcelain, French gilded mirrors, Italian marble tables, and Baccarat crystal chandeliers here, it wasn't their primary residence; the house was used mostly to host family members in transit, so the furnishings were rather eclectic. The three bedrooms are decorated in grand style, though, with handmade lace, embroidered sheets, and hand-painted glass. There is a gorgeous and very Cuban leather sill√≥n fumador (smoking chair) and, in the music room, the mid-18th-century American piano, one of only two of its type in Cuba. In the tearoom is the family seal, which says: \\"El que m√°s vale no vale tanto como Valle vale\\" (\\"He who has the greatest worth isn't worth as much as a Valle is worth\\"‚Äîplaying off the Spanish word for \\"worth\\" with the family surname). Another interesting landmark is one of Cuba's older bridges over the Yayabo river. Built in 1815 with clay bricks it forms five arcs, the center being 9 meters tall. The entire bridge is only 85 meters long and was designed for pedestrians and carriages during colonial-era Cuba but has thus far resisted heavier modern traffic. Sancti Sp√≠ritus has a famous Medical University located at the Main road in Olivos III. It has students from all over the world representing 34 nationalities. The university is affiliated with ELAM in Havana. Transport The city is crossed in the middle by the Carretera Central (CC), the Cuban principal highway spanning the length of the island. It is also served by the Sancti Sp√≠ritus Airport and by the A1 motorway, at the exit \\"Sancti Sp√≠ritus- Yaguajay\\", located near Guayos. It counts a railway station on Cabaigu√°n- Sancti Sp√≠ritus-Tunas de Zaza line, with express trains from/to Havana, a terminal for interprovincial omnibuses and an urban bus service. Sport The local baseball team is the Sancti Sp√≠ritus Gallos, and its home ground is Jos√© Antonio Huelga Stadium. The local football team is the FC Sancti Sp√≠ritus.

The Republic was established after a joint Russo-Ottoman fleet captured the islands and ended a two-year rule by the First French Republic. Although the islanders had hoped for complete independence, the new state was granted only autonomy, becoming tributary to the Ottoman Porte. Nevertheless, it was the first time Greeks had been granted self-government since the fall of the last remnants of the Byzantine Empire to the Ottomans in 1460. In 1807, the republic was ceded to Napoleon's First French Empire, but the islands were not annexed by France, keeping their institutions of government. The British gradually took control of the islands, and following the Treaty of Paris, the islands were formally organised into the United States of the Ionian Islands under British protection.  Background: French rule and Russian conquest of the Ionian Islands  The Ionian Islands (Corfu, Paxoi, Zakynthos/Zante, Kefalonia, Lefkada, Ithaca, and Kythira/Cerigo) along with a handful of exclaves on the Epirote mainland, namely the coastal towns of Parga, Preveza, Vonitsa, and Butrinto, had been Venetian possessions for centuries, thereby becoming the only part of the Greek world to escape conquest by the Ottoman Empire, developing a distinct local culture, and becoming a place of \\"dynamic interaction between the West and [...] the Greek East\\", indeed serving as \\"Greek culture's window on the West\\", through which Western European ideas and culture were transmitted to the Greek world. Under Venetian rule, the population of the islands was divided into three classes: the privileged nobility, the urban middle class (cittadini) and the commoners (popolari). The nobility were mostly landowners, and derided mercantile activity, which was left to the urban burghers; as a result, the latter also came to amass wealth and land, and aspired to join the ruling class. In this contest, the rural peasantry was generally politically marginalized. This medieval social order was upset after the Fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797, when the islands came under French control. Shortly after, in the Treaty of Campo Formio, the islands were annexed to the French Republic and organized into three departments. The Republican French were welcomed by the populace, and the radical ideas of the French Revolution were implemented with the abolition of the local nobility, the equality of the social and religious communities (Orthodox, Catholic, and Jewish) and the installation of democratic regimes and local self-government on the islands. The French also created the islands' first public education system, and introduced the first printing press in what is now Greece. Inevitably, the French presence was resented by the local aristocracy, now deprived of its privileges, while the heavy taxation and anti-clericalism of the French soon made them unpopular with broad sections of the common populace as well. Following the French invasion of Egypt furthermore, the French presence in the Ionian Islands aroused the opposition of the Ottomans and the Russian Empire, allied with the British, as part of the War of the Second Coalition. No less than the Patriarch of Constantinople, Gregory V, issued a proclamation to the Islanders denouncing the \\"ungodly\\" French, calling upon them to rise in revolt, and promising, on behalf of the Ottoman Porte, to allow the Islands to choose their own form of government. In autumn 1798, a joint Russo-Ottoman fleet evicted the French from the other islands and finally captured Corfu on , while the autonomous Ottoman strongman Ali Pasha of Yanina took the opportunity to seize Butrinto, Preveza, and Vonitsa from the French. Establishment of the Septinsular Republic Restoration of the nobility In all the islands they occupied, the Russians at first installed provisional administrations of nobles and burghers alike. On 22 March, however, the Russian authorities invited assemblies of the nobles to undertake the governance of the Ionian Islands, thereby restoring the previous status quo. On the next day, the Great Council of Corfu was reconstituted; its very first action was a vote of thanks to the Allied rulers, the Ottoman Sultan, the Russian Emperor, and the British King. In Zakynthos, however, the local noble council preferred to direct its thanks exclusively to the British, an expression of the strong pro-British tendency on the island, due to the close commercial links centred on the currant trade. On , the commanders of the two fleets announced that the Ionian Islands would comprise a single state, governed by a Senate (ŒìŒµœÅŒøœÖœÉŒØŒ±) in Corfu city, composed of three representatives each from Corfu, Cephalonia, and Zakynthos, two from Lefkada, and one each from Ithaca, Kythira, and Paxoi. The Venetian nobleman , the last Venetian provveditore of Argostoli, was appointed head of the Senate, and entrusted with the creation of a constitution for the new state. Orio's draft constitution comprised 28 articles and one addendum, and envisaged a thoroughly aristocratic regime, with each island headed by a Great Council composed of the nobles and the upper bourgeoisie. The Great Councils would elected the senators. Each island would retain a local administrative council of six members and a treasury, but a central treasury would exist in Corfu. The Senate was the ultimate executive authority, and its president the head of state. A Small Council of 40 would be elected by the Great Councils of the three largest islands, and would be responsible for justice, the selection of officials, and advising on legislation. Each island's council would have to ratify the laws passed by the Senate. In addition, the use of the Greek language was sanctioned for the first time in the courts. Ushakov also restored the Orthodox Archbishopric of Corfu, which had been abolished in the 13th century by the Angevin rulers of Corfu. Treaty of Constantinople On 21 June 1799, the Senate sent a twelve-member delegation to Constantinople and Saint Petersburg, drawn from the upper classes of each island, to express its gratitude to the Sultan and Tsar and secure recognition of the new state's independence. The delegates were also tasked with producing a draft constitution and submitting it for ratification, as well as press for the restoration of the Islands' maritime and land frontier with the withdrawal of Ali Pasha from Butrinto, Preveza, and Vonitsa. The delegation included Orio, nominated as ambassador to St. Petersburg, and the presidency of the Senate passed to Count Spyridon Georgios Theotokis, who had previously headed the Provisional Municipality under French rule. Once in Constantinople, however, the delegation quickly realized that the Porte was not interested in recognizing the Islands' independence, but rather in creating a vassal state under Ottoman suzerainty. Two of the delegates, the Corfiot Count Antonio Maria Capodistrias and the Zakynthian Count Nikolaos Gradenigos Sigouros Desyllas remained in Constantinople to conduct negotiations with the Porte, while Orio and another delegate, Kladas, were to represent the Ionian cause in Saint Petersburg. In the negotiations that followed, the Constantinople delegates were pitted against the Saint Petersburg ones in a correspondence war over the nature of the new polity. On 21 March 1800, the Treaty of Constantinople was concluded between Russia and the Ottomans, joined later by the British, creating the Republic of the Seven United Islands (; ), the first autonomous Greek state since the Fall of the Byzantine Empire. According to the provisions of the treaty, the Ionian Islands would be a single federal state, with the individual islands preserving a degree of autonomy. It would follow the long-established model of the Republic of Ragusa, being an aristocratic republic led by the \\"primates and notables\\", and under Ottoman suzerainty, as token of which they would pay an annual tribute of 75,000 piastres to the Sultan. This was a victory for the Sultan, and a disappointment for the Islanders, who had been promised the right to choose their own form of governance in the proclamations of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, Gregory V, and the head of the Russian fleet, Admiral Fyodor Ushakov. The new state's constitution, once agreed, would be approved by the signatory powers. As the new state lacked military forces, Russian and Ottoman forces would remain to garrison its forts and guarantee its security until the end of the war against France. The mainland exclaves of Parga, Vonitsa, Preveza, and Butrinto, on the other hand, would remain under Ottoman control but would enjoy a special status similar to that of the Danubian Principalities. Adoption of the \\"Byzantine\\" Constitution At the same time, without consulting their colleagues in Saint Petersburg or the provisional government in the Islands, Capodistrias and Sigouros Desyllas also composed a new constitution, and designed the new flag of the state. The so- called \\"Byzantine\\" Constitution (constituzione bizantina), thus named most probably because it was composed in Constantinople (Byzantion), comprised 37 articles. It envisaged an aristocratic federal republic, with a local administration on every island, headed by three syndics, to be chosen annually from the Great Council of the nobles of each island. The syndics elected a \\"dean\\" (œÄœÅœçœÑŒ±ŒΩŒπœÇ) as head of administration for four-month tenures. The Senate in Corfu remained the highest authority of the federal state, composed of the representatives of the islands. Its president, the archon, was the head of state. The constitution was printed in Greek, with heavy use of Italian loanwords for administrative terms, by the patriarchal press in Constantinople. The new constitution was strongly reactionary, reversing the gains of the bourgeoisie in particular, in favour of the old noble families; even the titles of nobility granted in 1799, after the French left, and which were mostly given to the wealthy burghers, were rescinded. In keeping with the reactionary ideas embodied in the constitution was also the new flag, sporting the Venetian Lion of Saint Mark holding a bundle of seven arrows, symbolizing the islands, and a Bible; suggestions with more revolutionary overtones, such as the rising phoenix, were rejected. On 1 November 1800, the new constitution and flag were formally sanctioned by the Grand Vizier and blessed by the Patriarch in Constantinople. The Ionian envoys to St. Petersburg, Orio and Kladas, protested to the Tsar about the events in Constantinople, but in vain; Theotokis, who now was recognized as head of state with the title of prince, even dismissed Orio from his position. Political turmoil and secessionist movements, 1800‚Äì1801 Ioannis Kapodistrias in the 1820s On 26 December 1800, the two envoys to Constantinople arrived in Corfu as \\"Imperial Commissioners\\", i.e., the Sultan's representatives in the islands, with the task of overseeing the implementation of the \\"Byzantine\\" Constitution. On , the flag of the Septinsular Republic was formally raised at Corfu. The mission of the Imperial Commissioners‚ÄîAntonio Maria Capodistrias was soon replaced by his son, Ioannis Kapodistrias, the future first governor of Greece‚Äîquickly proved problematic: the reactionary nature of the new constitution, which limited political power to the nobility, immediately made it controversial, as the common people had grown used to the greater civic rights and liberties enjoyed during the French Republican rule. To this were added local grievances and power struggles, which resulted in secessionist tendencies in some islands. Already during the latter part of 1799, political tensions had led to the start of infighting, both among the nobility, as well as between the nobility and the other classes. While at Corfu, under the direct supervision of Ushakov, the elections of the new provisional authorities and their installation were orderly and peaceful, that was not the case in the other islands. Class and personal rivalries dominated the process there, and the arbitrary interventions of Ushakov's representative, Nikolai Tiesenhausen. In Zakynthos, for example, a plot was hatched to murder the nobles on 12 September 1799, the day the island's Great Council was to convene and elect the new government. While the plot was not carried out, its instigator, Antonio Martinengo, managed to bribe Tiesenhausen and secure an amnesty, whereas his co- conspirator Tsintos was shot. Due to the restiveness of the rural population, on 18 January 1800, the first repressive measures against the lower classes were announced. Rebellions in Cephalonia The mounting political passions came first to a head in Cephalonia, where the existence of a large middle class increased dissatisfaction with the reactionary local government. To this was joined the rivalry between the island's capital, Argostoli, and the town of Lixouri, and between the noble families of Metaxas and Anninos. On 24 August 1800 an armed mob of civilians and rebel soldiers seized the government house in Argostoli, as well as ransacking and destroying the houses and villas of the administration members. A new government was formed on 9 September, but only after Count Konstantinos Chorafas was given plenipotentiary powers and a force of Russian troops, the unrest was suppressed. This peace did not last long, and a revolt under the nobleman Efstathios Metaxas broke out in May 1801. In response, the Imperial Commissioners came to the island to mediate in the conflict and established a 22-member Committee of Public Safety, with themselves and Colonel Nikolaos Pierris as chairmen. In the end Metaxas' revolt was subdued by a compromise reached by Ioannis Kapodistrias: the previous government of the island resigned on 20 May, and the Commissioners along with the Committee of Public Safety took over the island's governance, with the aim of pacifying the island and disarming the inhabitants. Local passions hindered their work, however: in late May, the delegation of Lixouri withdrew from the committee and the Lixouriotes made threatening moves against Argostoli, forcing the Imperial Commissioners to visit Lixouri in person to calm matters. At the same time, the brothers Andreas and Kaisar Metaxas refused to acknowledge the Committee of Public Safety and rose in revolt, which was only suppressed after heavy combats on 15 June: Andreas surrendered, but Kaisar fled to Corfu. In the meantime, Lixouri had voted for secession from the Argostoli-based government, and sent envoys to Corfu demanding a separate administration for the town; at the same time, the dissatisfied peasants of Anogi also rebelled and began attacking Lixouri, until troops sent by the Committee of Public Safety clashed with them and drove them back. In order to restore order, the Imperial Commissioners convened the island's Great Council on 20 July, which according to the constitution elected the three syndics, the three senators-representatives and the other public officials. In all cases, the offices were equally apportioned among representatives of the island's three towns, Argostoli, Lixouri, and St George's Castle. After this was done, on 27 July the Imperial Commissioners felt able to proclaim the successful establishment of lawful government on the island. This proved premature, for in August, the peasantry around Lixouri rebelled, seized the town, and expelled the government garrison. Kapodistrias and Andreas Panas tried to mediate a settlement, but the rebels, backed by the local Austrian vice-consul, refused. Secessionist movements in Zakynthos and Ithaca One-gazeta coin of the Septinsular Republic Similar unrest also broke out in Kythira, where rioting peasants attacked the nobles and burghers before troops restored order, and in Lefkada. On Zakynthos, the turmoil continued, with constant clashes between rival groups and coalitions. While the central government planned a coup, another, pro-British coup broke out first. On 20 February 1801, Zakynthos seceded from the Republic, raising the British flag instead, apparently with the support of a supposed British colonel, a certain James Kallender, who happened to be on the island and became its military governor. The initiative was quickly denounced by the British ambassador to the Porte, the Earl of Elgin, but constitutional order was not restored until five Ottoman vessels and a British warship arrived before the island on 12 September 1801. A similar secessionist movement also briefly took hold of Ithaca, where the local government entertained contacts with Zakynthos. When the Imperial Commissioners arrived on 18 August on the island with the intention of installing a constitutionally-based administration, the local government resigned. Pro-British sentiments were limited to the capital of Vathy, however, while the rural population supported the Commissioners' efforts. Departure of the Russo‚ÄìOttoman troops and the \\"Honourable Deputation\\" Even Corfu was not spared unrest: on , bloody riots broke out due to the arrogant behaviour of armed Ottoman soldiers in the city. Its own troops unable to contain the situation‚Äîmost of the available forces had been shipped to Cephalonia‚Äîthe Senate handed over authority to the Russians, under Lt. Colonel Karl Hastfert, so as to prevent a general massacre and restore order. The Russian intervention calmed the situation, but the Senate requested that the Ottomans remove their troops from the island. Conversely, when the Russians announced their intention of removing their own troops, the Senate president Theotokis implored the Russian to remain and ensure the islands' domestic tranquility and external security. Nevertheless, on 25 August 1801, the occupying powers officially handed over control of the fortresses and departed. This act seriously undermined the stability of the government, whose repressive measures only alienated the burghers and peasantry further. By this time, the city of Corfu was virtually under siege by the rural population, which ransacked the nobility's country estates. While the Senate became increasingly powerless, power increasingly shifted to a group of burghers (Spyridon Delviniotis, Karolos Manesis, and Alexandros Avgoustos Kogevinas) who maintained contacts with the peasantry. To counter the restiveness of the populace, and the increasing demands for civic rights, the Senate gave Theotokis dictatorial powers. Theotokis formed an \\"Extraordinary Committee of Public Safety\\" (Commissione Estraordinaria di Pubblica Sicurezza) composed of Dimitrios Armenos, Stamos Chalikiopoulos, and Ioannis Kapadokas, but the rebellious lower classes refused to accept its authority. Instead the burghers and peasants elected their own delegates, resulting in the formation of a body of 64 men, the \\"Honourable Deputation of the City, Boroughs, and Villages of Corfu\\" (Onoranda Deputazione della citt√†, borghi e ville di Corf√π), which declared the 1800 constitution as void, and began drafting a new, more democratic constitution. The constitution proposed by the \\"Honourable Deputation\\" vested sovereign power in Corfu in a 240-member council of \\"Best Ones\\", elected for life in general, albeit indirect, suffrage. 100 members would come from the city, with 40 noblemen, 40 burghers, 14 merchants, and 6 artisans; the rest of the members would come from the countryside. Executive power was vested in a committee of four Procuratori, who were elected from among the \\"Best Ones\\" and chaired its proceedings. The council decided on all matters, and also elected the three representatives of the island to the Ionian Senate, which was intended to retain its original functions. The definition of \\"nobility\\", and with it suffrage, was broadened to all those who had an income of 1,000 thalers, regardless of residence or profession. Events proceeded quickly: the draft constitution was sent to the Senate on 21 October 1801, and ten days later, the \\"Honourable Deputation\\" demanded from Theotokis to appoint representatives of the nobility to form a common provisional government for Corfu. In a highly symbolic display of unity and class reconciliation, on 28 November the \\"Honourable Deputation\\" joined with 14 representatives of the \\"so-called nobility\\", as they were termed, to take over power; on the next day, the nobles signed the new constitution. Foreign intervention and the oligarchic constitution of 1803 The new regime of Corfu was not welcome to the Allied powers of the Second Coalition, nor to the noble-dominated Senate: in early March 1802, on the invitation of Theotokis, a British force landed on Corfu and joined with the troops of the Republic. The Ottomans also disapproved of events, although they recognized the necessity of reforms to the original constitution. The Porte charged Theotokis, who remained president of the Senate, to restore the previous status quo, until proper deliberations involving the Allied powers, the Imperial Commissioners, and the islanders could take place. The rural population was on the point of marching on Corfu city, but the warnings of the Ottomans to the \\"Honourable Deputation\\", and the French consul, Romieu, who addressed the peasants, temporarily calmed matters. With the situation still volatile, the Russians secured the agreement of the other Great Powers to send their own troops to the islands, with the Zakynthian count Giorgio Mocenigo, a former Russian ambassador to Florence and briefly the Septinsular Republic's envoy to St. Petersburg, as the Tsar's plenipotentiary. In the meantime, the Treaty of Amiens led to the formal recognition of the Republic, as constituted in the Treaty of Constantinople, by France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Batavian Republic. Arrival and reforms of Giorgio Mocenigo Mocenigo arrived at Corfu on 1 September 1802, with five Russian vessels and 1,600 troops. In the meantime, the proposals of the \\"Honourable Deputation\\" had been rejected, and only the presence of the British troops kept its supporters out of Corfu city. In this atmosphere, Mocenigo's arrival was welcomed by both sides: the nobles felt that he would support their authority, while the lower classes hoped that he would liberate them from it. Indeed, Mocenigo immediately began to reform the institutions of the Republic, by limiting the power of the nobles as well as the autonomy of the individual islands. Mocenigo established a new provisional government or \\"regency\\" (Reggenza) in each island, where executive power was concentrated in the hands of a \\"regent\\" (Reggente), who in all cases had to be from a different island, but was assisted by two deputies chosen by him from the island's population. While Theotokis, who was able to cooperate well with Mocenigo, remained as President of the Senate (and thus titulary head of state), the existing Senate was dissolved on 30 December 1802, and a provisional Senate appointed by Mocenigo, to general dissatisfaction. The new regime was quick to stamp out any sign of dissent or rebellion, and pro-French sentiment was frowned upon, particularly after the positive reception of a speech by the French general Sebastiani at Zakynthos. On 3 February 1803, the provisional Senate announced the creation of new electoral colleges, the so-called sincliti, replacing the old councils of the nobility. Nevertheless, membership to these was restricted by a series of property, citizenship, religious, and professional qualifications, so that they had a pronounced oligarchic character. These sinliti in turn elected a 40-member legislative body (Corpo Legislativo, with ten members each from Corfu, Cephalonia, and Zakynthos, four from Lefkada, two each from Ithaca and Kythira and one from Paxoi) and a seventeen-member Senate (with four members each from Corfu, Cephalonia, and Zakynthos, two from Lefkada, and one each from the other islands). The new Senate appointed Ioannis Kapodistrias as Secretary of State. Constitution of 1803 Antonios Komoutos, President of the Ionian Senate and head of state of the Septinsular Republic in 1803 On 26 October, the Constitutional Assembly convened, which on 5 December 1803 passed the new constitution of the Republic. Its 212 articles were a mixture of progressive principles and restrictions on political rights that ensured the oligarchic nature of the state. While the Venetian-era hereditary nobility was abolished, a new civic aristocracy (\\"constitutional nobility\\") took its place. Based on property or academic qualifications, it was composed of many former nobles as well as burghers. This new aristocracy formed the electorate for the sincliti, which continued to elect the Senate and the legislative body as before. The Constitution of 1803 introduced the principle of separation of powers, and instituted a new body, the \\"censors\\" (Censori) who were to safeguard compliance to the Constitution and function as advisors to the Senate. The Senate remained the main executive body, with three branches for foreign affairs, interior and finance affairs, and military affairs. Each island retained its own government for the time being, headed by a \\"dean\\" or \\"rector\\" (Pritano), while his two deputies were now named \\"regents\\" (Reggenti). Among the progressive elements of the new constitution were the institution of juries, personal liberties, the inviolability of a citizen's home, and religious tolerance. The constitution also contained a clause that made knowledge of the Greek language mandatory for any candidate for public office after 1810, while from 1820 on all public documents were to be exclusively in Greek. The new constitution went into force on 27 December, when the Metropolitan of Corfu blessed it and the president of the Constitutional Assembly and deputy president of the Senate took their oaths on it. With Theotokis having died on 24 November, a new president of the Senate and head of state of the Republic was elected: Antonios Komoutos from Zakynthos. The following period saw a flurry of legislative and administrative activity: between January and March 1804, laws concerning local administration, shipping, rural communes, and education were passed, the ecclesiastical administration was reformed, and the ministries were established. The Republic now became truly a proper state, and aroused the expectations and hopes of the Greek intelligentsia: Adamantios Korais and Eugenios Voulgaris dedicated their works to the Republic. Nevertheless, due to the machinations of Mocenigo, the Russians never ratified the new constitution. Furthermore, as the Russian plenipotentiary, Mocenigo was the most influential person in the state, with a decisive voice in all matters, and soon began to undermine the constitution by creating extraordinary committees, bypassing the ordinary courts, and establishing a Sublime Police, staffed by his own nominees and controlled by him. Relations with Ali Pasha, the Souliots, and the creation of the Greek Legion Relations between the Republic and its neighbour Ali Pasha were tense and complicated. The Ionian Islands, and especially Lefkada, were a common refuge for the sanctuary for klephts and brigands fleeing the Ottoman authorities of the Greek mainland. With the Islands as a secure base, they often launched raids on the Turkish- held shores. In turn, Ali Pasha harassed the Republic's citizens, and imposed heavy tolls on its vessels in the harbours he controlled. During this period, Ali Pasha in a series of campaigns suppressed the rebellious Souliots, who defied his authority. Advised by the turncoat Georgios Botsaris, Ali pursued a strategy of encircling the area of Souli with forts and besieging it. Already in 1800, the Souliots wrote to Theotokis for aid against the designs of Ali Pasha. The latter in turn threatened the inhabitants of Parga, to prevent them from lending any aid to the Souliots. By 1803, the position of the Souliots had grown dire, and they implored the Septinsular Republic for ammunition. A Souliot embassy visited Mocenigo, conveying an appeal to Tsar Alexander. Mocenigo gave them some ammunition, but secretly from the Russians; this and later requests for Russian mediation remained unanswered, even as Ali Pasha, with the Sultan's backing, moved to eradicate the last centres of Souliot resistance. The Souliots who managed to escape from Ali's forces made for Parga, but they were forced to cross the sea to the Septinsular Republic in March 1804, after Ali Pasha threatened to attack the city. In November 1803, the Republic signed a treaty with Ali Pasha, who was represented by the Metropolitan of Nafpaktos Ignatios. Souliote warrior in Corfu, with the New Fortress in the background Approximately 3,000 Souliots settled in the Ionian Islands, mostly in Corfu and Paxoi, where they were provided with farmland. The warlike Soulioes struggled to fit in their new environment, stealing cattle and firewood from local residents and lamenting the loss of their homeland. Anxious to expand its influence to the Greek mainland, Russia signed alliances with Himariot and Cham Albanian beys on 27 June 1804. Souliot refugees were mobilized for an offensive, which was cut short when Ali Pasha learned of the Russian plans and an Ottoman naval squadron made an unexpected appearance off Corfu. As French‚ÄìOttoman relations began to warm in 1805, the Russians began raising native military formations for the defence of the Ionian Islands, enrolling Souliots, Himariots, Acarnanians, and Moreots into the so-called \\"Greek Legion\\", which was placed under the command of the Greek- born Major-General Emmanouil Papadopoulos. In autumn 1805 the Greek Legion participated in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Naples, and in 1806 it fought against the French at the Bay of Kotor. \\"Russian\\" Constitution of 1806 Mocenigo's influence became decisive in the run-up to the revision of the 1803 constitution, scheduled for 1806. On Mocenigo's suggestion, the Senate instituted a \\"Decemvirate\\" (ŒîŒµŒ∫Œ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒØŒ±) to study the changes to the constitution; in the end, the council's suggestions reflected Mocenigo's designs. When the sincliti were convened to elect their representatives to the Constitutional Assembly on 13 September 1806, they turned into a sham: Mocenigo sent an envoy to every island with prepared lists of the representatives to be elected. Finally, when the Constitutional Assembly convened on 27 October, Mocenigo simply replaced the entire Legislative Council, which was to prepare the lists of the candidates for public office, with his own choices, and appointed Ioannis Kapodistrias as its secretary and rapporteur. Kapodistrias presented the draft constitution to the Constitutional Assembly on 22 December. These moves aroused considerable opposition, but Kapodistrias successfully argued that there was no alternative that would enjoy the consent of St. Petersburg, and the new constitution was approved five days later. The new constitution vested sovereignty in the so- called \\"active nobility\\", determined by income and academic titles. This restriction actually excluded some of the old noble families, that had become impoverished. A \\"Legislative Senate\\" of 17 members (four each for Corfu, Cephalonia, and Zakynthos, two for Lefkada, and one each for the minor islands), of whom nine served for three years and eight for four, was given legislative authority, while executive authority was vested in a five-member college, the principato. The members, known as the \\"heads of the republic\\" (Capi della repubblica), came one each from the three major islands of Corfu, Cephalonia, and Zakynthos, while the fourth came either from the three islands or from Lefkada, and the fifth either from Lefkada or from the minor islands. The principato had a rotating presidency, with a tenure of one year; for that year, the president was also the head of state and prince of the Republic. The principato further appointed the four ministers, for foreign affairs, war and naval affairs, interior affairs, finances and justice. The local governments of the islands were not changed, but the constitution of 1806 abolished many of the more progressive and liberal clauses of its predecessor; above all, it effectively abolished the Republic's autonomy by recognizing the right of Russia to intervene in its domestic and foreign affairs. It is still debated whether the revisions incorporated in the 1806 constitution reflected an initiative of the Russian government, or whether it was driven by a small coterie of men around Mocenigo to concentrate power in fewer hands. Nevertheless, the \\"Russian Constitution\\", as it soon became known, strongly reinforced the position of Russia and the pro-Russian elements in the Republic, arousing the suspicions of France. Russo-Turkish War and the end of the Republic In the meantime, however, the shifting alliances in Europe impacted the Republic as well, with Ottoman Turkey drifting away from Russia, and towards France. On 6 January 1807, the Ottoman Porte notified the Republic of the declaration of war with Russia. As de jure the Republic was an Ottoman vassal, the Porte demanded the Ionian Islands' adherence to the Ottoman camp against Russia. France followed by recalling its envoy and terminating its diplomatic relations with the Republic. Under Mocenigo's tutelage, the Ionian Senate on 17 June 1807 declared the end of the Republic's neutrality towards France, effectively bringing the islands into the War of the Fourth Coalition on the side of Russia. This situation was exploited by Ali Pasha, whose ambition to occupy the Ionian Islands was well known, and had received Napoleon's backing, as the Republic was now in the Russian orbit. In spring, his forces attacked Lefkada. The reinforcement of the island with Russian and Souliot troops, and the failure of Ali's troops to capture the Castle of Santa Maura, led to the attack being broken off. Nevertheless, on 2 June the Senate resolved the establishment of an \\"Ionian Encampment\\" (Campo Jonio) on Lefkada, comprising the Republic's regular forces as well as all the island militias. At the same time, a fortification programme was begun, and Ioannis Kapodistrias was named Commissioner Extraordinary to oversee it. The defence of Lefkada soon attracted widespread support, and even klepht captains from the mainland rushed to join it, including Katsantonis, Kitsos Botsaris, Dimitrios Karaiskos, Georgios Varnakiotis, and most notably, Theodoros Kolokotronis. It was there that Kapodistrias first came into contact with some of the chief military leaders of the subsequent Greek War of Independence. However, the fate of the Septinsular Republic would be decided in the battlefields and chanceries of Europe: in the Treaty of Tilsit in July, they were ceded once again to Napoleonic France. On 20 August, French troops landed on Corfu, followed three days later by General C√©sar Berthier, who received control of the islands from the Russian admiral Dmitry Senyavin. As the Russians departed, French troops replaced them in all islands, as well as the mainland dependency of Parga. Finally, on 1 September, contrary to his instructions to preserve the Islands' constitution, Berthier as Governor- General declared the annexation of the Septinsular Republic to France. Aftermath: Second French rule and British conquest General Fran√ßois-Xavier Donzelot, second French Governor-General of the Ionian Islands (1808‚Äì1814) Berthier moved swiftly to abolish the Republic's attributes as an independent state: the French flag was hoisted, all public officials and soldiers took an oath of allegiance to Napoleon, the embassies and agencies of the Republic abroad were abolished, and all domestic bodies apart from the courts and the Senate as well. These measures annoyed Napoleon, who replaced Berthier as Governor-General with Fran√ßois-Xavier Donzelot. His chief task, according to the instructions sent by Napoleon, was to defend the islands, and above all Corfu, against the mounting British threat. In November 1807, Napoleon regulated the administration of the new French possessions: the internal structure of the Republic was retained largely along the lines of the 1803 Constitution, including the Ionian Senate (although its members were now appointed rather than elected), but the administration was overseen by a Governor-General and an Imperial Commissioner, with Julien Bessi√®res the first to occupy the latter post. The British had reacted to the French takeover of the islands by a naval blockade, which impeded both trade and the supply of the islands. The resulting hardships, and the activities of British agents, inflamed anti-French sentiments, and some Ionian captains petitioned the British commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, John Stuart, for aid in expelling the French from the islands. Indeed, in October 1809 a British expeditionary force under Brigadier John Oswald arrived at Zakynthos, and issued a proclamation promising to restore the Ionian Islands' liberty and independence. Due to the small size of the French garrisons, the British quickly occupied Zakynthos and Cephalonia (4 October), Ithaca (8 October), and Kythira (12 October), installing provisional administrations according to the existing laws. The first major military operation was against Lefkada, in April 1810, where Greek auxiliaries under Theodoros Kolokotronis and the British major Richard Church played a particularly important role. Despite strong French resistance, the garrison surrendered on 16 April. On 29 May 1810, on the Paxoi islands a pro-British uprising broke out. The rebels evicted the small French garrison, raised the British flag, and attacked French sympathizers on the islands. However, British troops failed to arrive, and the French in Corfu quickly suppressed the uprising. The British established a Governor-General in Zakynthos (General Oswald until 1810, General George Airey until 1813, and General Sir James Campbell after). Each island was governed by a Governor with a five-member Executive Council, and a local legislative assembly, the Administrative Body. While the British- controlled islands returned to normality, the French-held islands of Corfu and Paxoi, under Donzelot and Imperial Commissioner Mathieu de Lesseps, suffered from the effects of the British blockade, which became official on 10 November 1810. Finally, Paxoi were occupied by the British in early 1813, followed by Parga on 22 March 1814, after a popular uprising evicted the French. Corfu held out until the first downfall of Napoleon and the restoration of Louis XVIII: The armistice of obliged the French to evacuate Corfu. In June, Donzelot surrendered the island to Campbell. The Ionian Senate, declaring that the Republic had been suspended but not abolished under the French and British occupation, tried to advocate for the independence of the Islands in the Congress of Vienna, but Campbell refused to accept this view, holding that the Republic had ceased to exist after Tilsit, and regarding the appointed Senate as not representative of the Ionian people. In the end, the Ionian Islands were formed into a British protectorate, the \\"United States of the Ionian Islands\\", which existed until the islands were united with the Kingdom of Greece in 1864.  Languages  Due to the long Venetian rule, the Ionian Islands were linguistically and culturally influenced by Italy. Italian culture and language retained a dominant status among the educated urban elites well into the 19th century‚ÄîItalian remained an official language until 1851‚Äîbut the lower classes remained \\"monolingually and monoculturally Greek\\". The official language was at first the Italian language and then in 1803 Greek became, along with Italian, one of the two official languages of the Republic. During the Venetian period, Italian was used for official purposes in the islands but it was also widely spoken in the cities, whereas in the countryside people continued to speak Greek. The only island in which Italian (Venetian) had a wider spread was Cefalonia, where a greater number of people had adopted Venetian as their first language. The constitution of the Septinsular Republic was printed in Greek by the patriarchal press in Constantinople, using many loanwords from Italian for technical terms. However, the new constitution approved in 1803 was drafted in Italian. The text of the constitution was prefaced by the report of the committee that drafted it, which stated that: \\"the noble, rich and harmonious Hellenic dialect, having been exiled by the Venetians, should be recalled to the dominion and become the language of administration and the interpreter of the active citizens.\\" This issue was considered to be so important that it was even given a separate article (Art. 211) in the constitution. According to the article, Greek was scheduled to replace Italian as the working language in public acts by the year 1820.  Religion  The Church of Panagia Mandrakina in Corfu town Most of the people on these islands during this period were Christians, with a small number of Jews on Corfu, Zante and an even smaller number on Cefalonia. The majority of Christians were Eastern Orthodox. However, there was a significant number of Catholics, especially on Corfu, Zante and Cefalonia. The Constitution of 1803 recognized Orthodoxy as the dominant faith; it also stated that the Roman Catholic faith was recognized and protected. The Constitution also provided for the enactment of a law defining the privileges of the Jews residing in the State.

The goal includes \\"locking\\" the knee, in order to rest the weight on the skeleton (and relieve the leg muscles of exertion as much as possible). Climbers may often execute the rest step spontaneously, if waiting either for the next step of a climber who is a step or two ahead, or for the energy to continue. Nevertheless, conscious practice at delaying the next step (requiring inhibition of a walking reflex) is widely deemed worthwhile. That skill enables ascent at the maximum steady pace, on slopes where quadriceps endurance, or the rate of consumption of either energy or oxygen is the factor limiting the rate of advance, whether some climbers or all in the party are operating at that limit. The rest step is especially emphasized in steep ascents on firm snow, often including the additional feature of keeping the moving foot close to the snow surface and scraping it against the snow as it comes to rest, especially to preserve and reinforce the improved footing available in the footprint left by the immediately previous climber.

He was released from prison in the United States after 33 years in 2020. Born in Armenia, Colombia, Lehder eventually ran a cocaine transport empire on Norman's Cay island, off the Florida coast in the central Bahamas. Lehder was one of the founding members of Muerte a Secuestradores (\\"MAS\\"), a paramilitary group whose focus was to retaliate against the kidnappings of cartel members and their families by the guerrillas. His motivation to join the MAS was to retaliate against the M-19 guerrilla movement, which, on November 19, 1981, attempted to kidnap him for a ransom; Lehder managed to escape from the kidnappers, though he was shot in the leg. He was one of the most important MAS and Medellin Cartel operators, and is considered to be one of the most important Colombian drug kingpins to have been successfully prosecuted in the United States. Additionally, Lehder founded \\"a neo-Nazi political party\\", the National Latin Movement, whose main function, police said, appeared to be to force Colombia to abrogate its extradition treaty with the United States.\\"  Early life  Carlos Lehder is of mixed German-Colombian descent. His father, Klaus Wilhelm Lehder, was an engineer who emigrated from Germany to Armenia, Colombia in 1928, where he participated in the construction of several buildings which had elevators, a rather modern and unusual characteristic at that place and time. When he married Helena Rivas, the daughter of a jeweller from Manizales, he changed his name to Guillermo Lehder. Guillermo and Helena had four sons, with Carlos Enrique, born on September 7, 1949, being the third. In Armenia, Colombia, the family owned a small inn called Pensi√≥n Alemana (which would later inspire Carlos to have his own luxurious Posada Alemana hotel), where German immigrants would regularly meet. They also ran a small business producing vegetable oils and importing luxury goods such as wine and canned foods. In 1943, following intelligence reports from the United States, the Lehders, along with many Germans in Colombia, were suspected of ideological links with the National Socialists and were investigated. The Pensi√≥n Alemana was alleged to have been a place where Nazis gathered intelligence. Carlos grew up in Armenia, Colombia until his parents divorced when he was 15, after which he emigrated with his mother to New York in the United States.  Criminal career   Early activities and prison  Carlos Lehder (left) snorting cocaine with former prison mate Steven Yakovac on Norman's Cay (1976) Lehder started out selling stolen cars and marijuana, as well as smuggling stolen cars between the U.S. and Canada. While serving a sentence for car theft in federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut, Lehder decided that, upon his release, he would take advantage of the burgeoning market for cocaine in the United States. To that end, he enlisted his prison bunkmate, former marijuana dealer George Jung, as a future partner. Jung had experience flying marijuana to the U.S. from Mexico in small aircraft, staying below radar level, and landing on dry lake beds. Inspired by the idea, Lehder decided to apply the principle to cocaine transport and formed a partnership with Jung. While in prison, Lehder set out to learn as much information as possible that could be useful to him in the cocaine business. He would sometimes even spend hours questioning fellow inmates about money laundering and smuggling. Jung allegedly said that Lehder kept countless files and constantly took notes. Lehder's ultimate scheme was to revolutionize the cocaine trade by transporting the drug to the United States, using small aircraft.  Starting his empire  After Lehder and Jung were released (both were paroled), they built up a small revenue stream through simple, traditional drug smuggling. Specifically, they enlisted two young U.S. citizen women to take a paid vacation to Antigua, receive cocaine, and carry it back with them to the U.S. in their suitcases. Repeating this process several times, Lehder and Jung soon had enough money for an airplane. Using a small stolen plane and a professional pilot, the pair began to fly cocaine into the United States via the Bahamas, in the process increasing their financial resources and building connections and trust with Colombian suppliers, while spreading money around among Bahamian government officials for political and judicial protection. Their unconventional method of drug-smuggling began to gain credibility.  Norman's Cay  In the late 1970s, the Lehder-Jung partnership began to diverge, due to some combination of Lehder's megalomania and his secret scheming to secure a personal Bahamian island as an all-purpose headquarters for his operations. That island was Norman's Cay, which at that point consisted of a marina, a yacht club, approximately 100 private homes, and an airstrip. In 1978, Lehder began buying up property and harassing and threatening the island's residents; at one point, a yacht was found drifting off the coast with the corpse of one of its owners aboard. Lehder is estimated to have spent $4.5 million on the island in total. As Lehder paid or forced the local population to leave, and began to assume total control of the island, Norman's Cay became his lawless private fiefdom. By this time, he had forced Jung out of the operation, and international criminal financier Robert Vesco had allegedly become a partner. Jung used his prior connections to take up a more modest line of independent smuggling for Pablo Escobar and stayed out of Lehder's way. From 1978 through 1982, the Cay was the Caribbean's main drug-smuggling hub, and a tropical hideaway and playground for Lehder and associates. They flew cocaine in from Colombia on all sorts of aircraft able to land fully loaded on the airstrip, reloaded it into various small aircraft, and then distributed it to locations in Georgia, Florida, and the Carolinas. Lehder was believed to have received 1 kilo out of every 4 that was transported through Norman's Cay. Lehder expanded a runway to , protected by radar, bodyguards, and Doberman attack dogs for the fleet of aircraft under his command. At the height of his operation, 300 kilograms of cocaine would arrive on the island daily, and Lehder's personal wealth mounted into the billions. He accumulated such staggering wealth that on two occasions he offered to pay the Colombian external debt. In 1978, he made an offer to do so to President Alfonso L√≥pez Michelsen, in exchange for a free space for drug trafficking. In 1982, through Pablo Escobar, who was a Colombian Congressman at the time, Lehder did so again, this time in an attempt to prevent his extradition.  Downfall  Their government's approval of the extradition of Colombians encouraged Escobar and Lehder to participate in politics. Lehder founded the National Latino Movement (Movimiento Latino Nacional, in Spanish), which managed three congressional seats, and popularized itself by making speeches against extradition. The April 30, 1984 assassination of Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, the Colombian Minister of Justice, initiated the beginning of the end for Lehder and the Medell√≠n Cartel. Lara had campaigned against the cartel's activities, and his murder marked a change in Colombian politics. President Belisario Betancur, who had previously opposed extraditing any Colombian drug lords to the United States, announced that he was now willing to extradite. Lehder was a leading individual on the crackdown list. Other major Medell√≠n Cartel associates fled to the protection of Manuel Noriega in Panama, but when Pablo Escobar discovered Noriega was plotting to betray him to the U.S. in return for amnesty, the cartel associates then fled to Nicaragua to seek the assistance of Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega. Escobar had paid some of Noriega's closest colonels to inform him of Noriega's intentions. Lehder's downfall was assisted by his blatant bribing of Bahamian officials, and the attention the activities on Norman's Cay were attracting.  Fugitive, capture, trial, and whereabouts  After Brian Ross's September 5, 1983 report, on the U.S. television network NBC, made public the corruption of Bahamian government leaders, Lehder could not return to Norman's Cay. The government had frozen all his bank accounts and taken over his property and possessions, and he went from being a billionaire to nearly bankrupt. While on the run in the jungle, he got sick with a fever. Escobar sent a helicopter for Lehder and brought him back to Medell√≠n, where he received medical attention to save his life. Even so, he was left very weak. When Lehder recovered, Escobar hired him as a bodyguard. Eventually, Lehder wanted to rebuild his fortune, but he was captured at a farm he had just established in Colombia, when a new employee of his informed the police of his location. Another hypothesis supported by Jhon Jairo Vel√°squez, better known as \\"Popeye\\", the head assassin of Pablo Escobar, is that fellow members of the Medell√≠n Cartel wanted him out of the picture due to his radical military-like behavior, which they believed would jeopardize their cocaine empire, and so Escobar himself provided Lehder's whereabouts to the police, leading to Lehder's capture. Having captured one of the Cartel's most powerful members, the U.S. government used him as a source of information about the details of the Cartel's secret empire, which later proved useful in assisting the Colombian government to dismantle the Cartel. In 1987, Lehder was extradited to the United States, where he was tried and sentenced to life without parole, plus an additional 135 years. Now all of the other cartel leaders knew what would happen if they were extradited, and soon afterward, the Medell√≠n Cartel organizations split up. These smaller organizations, especially Escobar's, were later attacked by the Cali Cartel, the Colombian police/army, and soon by the U.S. government, as well. A violent war began as the Medellin Cartel leaders tried to protect themselves by fighting back. In 1992, in exchange for Lehder's agreement to testify against Manuel Noriega, his sentence was reduced to a total of 55 years. Three years after that, Lehder wrote a letter to a Jacksonville federal district judge, complaining that the government had reneged on a deal to transfer him to a German prison. The letter was construed as a threat against the judge. Within weeks of sending that letter in the fall of 1995, Lehder was whisked away into the night, according to several protected witnesses at the Mesa Unit in Arizona. Lehder's brother, Federico Guillermo Lehder, who operated on the periphery of the business, might have been mistaken for Carlos, thus causing the reports of Carlos' being free and living overseas. According to journalist and author Tamara S. Inscoe-Johnson, who worked on the Lehder defense during the time in question, Lehder was simply transferred to another prison and has continued to be held in WITSEC, the U.S. Bureau of Prisons' version of the federal Witness Protection Program. Inscoe-Johnson argued that Lehder had not been released, despite Internet rumors to the contrary. Inscoe-Johnson also believed Lehder will never be released: allegedly, he would be privy to secret information regarding the CIA's and his own involvement in the Iran-Contra affair. On July 22, 2005, he appeared in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit to contest his sentence. Lehder appeared pro se, arguing that the United States failed to carry out its obligations under a cooperation agreement he had entered into with the United States Attorney's Office, after he held up his end of the deal. (United States v. Lehder-Rivas, 136 Fed. Appx. 324; 2005). In May 2007, Lehder requested the Supreme Court of Colombia and the Colombian government to intervene in order to comply with the extradition agreement established between Colombia and the USA, which stated that a maximum sentence of 30 years would be applied to any extradited Colombian citizen. Lehder argued then that, having already served 20 years in prison, which corresponded to two-thirds of the 30-year maximum time stated in the treaty, he had completed his legal sentence and should therefore be released. In May 2008, Lehder's lawyer declared to El Tiempo that a habeas corpus petition had been filed, alleging that Lehder's cooperation agreement had been violated and that \\"a court in Washington\\" had less than 30 days to respond to the notice. According to his lawyer, Lehder was transferred to minimum security prison in Florida. He was visited regularly by his family members, and had access to TV and to a computer with only email access. An article published by Cronica Del Quindio in January 2015 reported that Lehder could be released and extradited to Germany at any time. On June 24, 2015, Lehder wrote a letter to then-President of Colombia Juan Manuel Santos, in which he requested mediation with the United States to be allowed to return to Colombia. Lehder was released from prison on June 16, 2020 and escorted to Germany by two US officials on a regular passenger flight from New York to Frankfurt and handed over to German authorities. According to declarations made by his daughter, a reason for his release is a relapse of prostate cancer, which he had been diagnosed with years earlier, and which a charity in Germany has agreed to pay for the treatment.  Dramatic representations  * In the movie Blow (2001), the character Diego Delgado (played by the Spanish actor Jordi Moll√†), the cellmate of the main character George Jung at Danbury federal prison, who became Jung's good friend, business partner, and later his nemesis, was based on Carlos Lehder. * In the 2012 Caracol Televisi√≥n series Escobar, el Patr√≥n del Mal (Pablo Escobar: The Boss of Evil), Lehder is portrayed as Marcos Herber (by the Colombian actor and singer Alejandro Martinez). * Investigation Discovery's Manhunt: Kill or Capture episode, \\"Colombian Rambo\\" (August 26 2015), features the story of Carlos Lehder's rise and fall. * In the Netflix original drama/action television mini-series Narcos (2015), which follows drug kingpin Pablo Escobar as well as the ruthless Medell√≠n Cartel, Lehder is portrayed by . * In the 2017 film American Made, he was portrayed by Fredy Yate Escobar.

It is published by the New Century Foundation, which describes itself as a \\"race- realist, white advocacy organization\\". History The magazine and the New Century Foundation were established by Jared Taylor; the first issue of American Renaissance was published in November 1990. Both the magazine and foundation, as well as Taylor have had links with organizations such as the Council of Conservative Citizens, the Pioneer Fund, and the British National Party. Former Grand Wizards of the Ku Klux Klan Don Black and David Duke have attended American Renaissance conferences and have been seen talking with Taylor. The organization has held bi-annual conferences that attract neo- Nazis, white nationalists, white separatists, Holocaust deniers, and eugenicists. Attendance at the conferences has varied; in February 2008, some 300 people attended. Content American Renaissance is a white supremacist publication. It has been described as \\"alt-right\\" by The Guardian. On December 18, 2017, the accounts for the magazine and its editor Jared Taylor were suspended by Twitter. Before the suspension, the magazine's account had 32,800 followers. The publication promotes pseudoscientific notions \\"that attempt to demonstrate the intellectual and cultural superiority of whites and publishes articles on the supposed decline of American society because of integrationist social policies.\\" According to Carol M. Swain, \\"American Renaissance has become the leading intellectual journal of contemporary white nationalism with a small but highly educated readership which sees itself as the vanguard of a new race realism that seeks to rescue America from the harmful effects of multiculturalist dogmas.\\" YouTube banned the American Renaissance channel, along with those of individual white nationalists, in late June 2020 for ignoring the website's policies against hate speech. Reception and controversy Southern Poverty Law Center American Renaissance and the New Century Foundation appear on a list of 115 \\"white nationalist hate groups\\" published in the Intelligence Report of the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). Mark Potok, editor-in-chief of the Intelligence Report, has said: \\"Jared Taylor is the cultivated, cosmopolitan face of white supremacy. He is the guy who is providing the intellectual heft, in effect, to modern-day Klansmen.\\" Taylor stated in a radio interview: \\"I've never been a member of the Klan. I've never known a person who is a member of the Klan.\\" An article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that Taylor had at least met former Klansman David Duke at an American Renaissance conference, and sat with Don Black, a former Grand Wizard of the Klan, at Taylor's kitchen table. An article in the Intelliegence Report by Potok and Heidi Beirich, head of the SPLC's Intelligence Project stated: \\"American Renaissance has become increasingly important over the years, bringing a measure of intellectualism and seriousness to the typically thug-dominated world of white supremacy. Today, it may be the closest thing the extreme right has to a real think tank. Whether or not it survives, and in what form, genuinely matters.\\" Anti- Defamation League The American non-governmental organization Anti- Defamation League (ADL) describes American Renaissance as a \\"white supremacist journal\\". The ADL also writes: \\"Taylor eschews anti-Semitism. Seeing Jews as white, greatly influential and the 'conscience of society', Taylor rather seeks to partner with Jews who share his views on race and racial diversity\\" and \\"Jews have been speakers and/or participants at all eight American Renaissance conferences\\" although controversy followed accusations by David Duke, who was not a scheduled presenter, at the 2006 conference. Conferences American Renaissance has held conferences since 1994. Anti- racist activists were sometimes successful in persuading private hotels to cancel their reservations with American Renaissance. In 2011, the publication planned to hold a three-day conference at a Sheraton Airport hotel in Charlotte, North Carolina. The hotel canceled the group's booking amid plans by anti-racism activists and the Jewish Defense Organization (JDO) to protest at the conference site. The mayor pro tem of the city also reportedly contacted the hotel. Since 2012, the American Renaissance has held its conference held at Montgomery Bell State Park Inn in Burns, Tennessee, a state-owned site. Protests have often taken place outside the conference facilities. Alleged DHS memo regarding 2011 Tucson shooting A document‚Äîinitially claimed to be a leaked Department of Homeland Security (DHS) memo‚Äîalleged that Jared Lee Loughner, the accused gunman in the 2011 Tucson shooting that wounded Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and killed six bystanders, may have had ties to American Renaissance, which it called an \\"anti-ZOG (Zionist Government) and anti-semitic\\" group. In an interview with Fox News, Jared Taylor denied the organization ever used the term \\"ZOG\\" and said Loughner had no connection to them. DHS officials the following day reported: \\"the department has not established any such possibility, undercutting what appears to be the primary basis for this claim\\". Furthermore, no such memo had been issued. Major David Denlinger, commander of the Arizona Counter Terrorism Information Center acknowledged that the document came from his agency, but contained errors. He said that he has no reason to believe that Loughner had any direct connection with or was being directed by American Renaissance.

These software-defined radios are designed as successors to the JTRS- compatible CSCHR (PRC-148 and PRC-152) handhelds, securely transmitting voice and data simultaneously using Type 2 cryptography and the new Soldier Radio Waveform. The Army announced in June 2015 a Request for Proposal (RFP) for full-rate production of the HMS program. Goal was set for assessment in 2015-2016 and for full rate production in 2017.http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/soldier-battle-jtrs-the-hms-radio- set-07536/ Overview Launched with a Mission Needs Statement in 1997 and a subsequent requirements document in 1998 (which was revised several times), JTRS was a family of software-defined radios that were to work with many existing military and civilian radios. It included integrated encryption and Wideband Networking Software to create mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). The JTRS program was beset by delays and cost overruns, particularly Ground Mobile Radios (GMR), run by Boeing.The Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) and the Army‚Äôs Future Combat System (FCS): Issues for Congress, November 17, 2005 Problems included a decentralized management structure, changing requirements, and unexpected technical difficulties that increased size and weight goals that made it harder to add the required waveforms. The JTRS was built on the Software Communications Architecture (SCA), an open-architecture framework that tells designers how hardware and software are to operate in harmony. It governs the structure and operation of the JTRS, enabling programmable radios to load waveforms, run applications, and be networked into an integrated system. A Core Framework, providing a standard operating environment, must be implemented on every hardware set. Interoperability among radio sets was increased because the same waveform software can be easily ported to all radios. The Object Management Group (OMG), a not-for-profit consortium that produces and maintains computer industry specifications for interoperable enterprise applications, is working toward building an international commercial standard based on the SCA. JTRS Program of Record The Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) evolved from a loosely associated group of radio replacement programs to an integrated effort to network multiple weapon system platforms and forward combat units where it matters most ‚Äì at the last tactical mile. In 2005, JTRS was restructured under the leadership of a Joint Program Executive Officer (JPEO) headquartered in San Diego, California. The JPEO JTRS provides an enterprise acquisition and management approach to successfully and efficiently develop, produce, integrate, test and field the JTRS networking capability. The JTRS Enterprise was composed of five ACAT 1D programs of record - Network Enterprise Domain (NED), Ground Mobile Radios (GMR), Handheld, Manpack, & Small Form Fit (HMS), Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) JTRS, and Airborne, Maritime Fixed/Station (AMF) and one ACAT III program - Handheld JTRS Enhanced Multi-Band Intra-Team Radio (JEM). JTRS Network Enterprise Domain (NED) JTRS NED was responsible for the development, sustainment, and enhancement of interoperable networking and legacy software waveforms. NED's product line consists of: * 14 Legacy Waveforms ** Bowman VHF ** Collection Of Broadcasts From Remote Assets (COBRA) ** Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS) ** Have Quick II ** High Frequency Single sideband / Automatic link establishment (HF SSB/ALE) ** NATO Standardization Agreement 5066 (HF 5066) ** Link 16 ** Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) ** Ultra High Frequency Demand Assigned Multiple Access Satellite communications (UHF DAMA SATCOM) 181/182/183/184 ** Ultra High Frequency Line-of-Sight Communications System (UHF LOS) ** Very High Frequency Line-of-Sight Communications System (VHF LOS) * three Mobile Ad Hoc Networking Waveforms ** Wideband Networking Waveform [WNW] ** Soldier Radio Waveform [SRW] ** Mobile User Objective System [MUOS]‚ÄìRed Side Processing) * Network Enterprise Services (NES) including ** JTRS WNW Network Manager (JWNM) ** Soldier Radio Waveform Network Manager (SRWNM) ** JTRS Enterprise Network Manager (JENM) ** Enterprise Network Services (ENS) JTRS Ground Mobile Radios (GMR) JTRS GMR are a key enabler of the DoD and Army Transformation and will provide critical communications capabilities across the full spectrum of Joint operations. Through software reconfiguration, JTRS GMR can emulate current force radios and operate new internet protocol-based networking waveforms offering increased data throughput utilizing self-forming, self-healing, and managed communication networks. The GMR route and retransmit functionality links various waveforms in different frequency bands to form one internetwork. GMR can scale from one to four channels supporting multiple security levels and effectively use the frequency spectrum within the 2 megahertz to 2 gigahertz frequency range. The radios are Software Communications Architecture compliant with increased bandwidth through future waveforms and are interoperable with 4+ current force radio systems and the JTRS family of radios. Now that the GMR contract has been completed, the Army plans to leverage knowledge gained from the GMR Program in the upcoming Mid-Tier Networking Vehicular Radio solicitation.\\"US Army Testing Demonstrates Readiness of Raytheon's MAINGATE Radio.\\" Space War, January 13, 2012. JTRS Handheld, Manpack & Small Form Fit (HMS) JTRS HMS is a materiel solution meeting the requirements of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration/DoD Chief Information Officer for a Software Communications Architecture (SCA) compliant hardware system hosting SCA-compliant software waveforms (applications). The JTRS HMS contract was structured to address Increment 1, consisting of Phases 1 and 2. Increment 1, Phase 1 was to develop the AN/PRC-154 Rifleman Radio sets and embedded SFF-A (one channel), SFF-A (two channel) and SFF-D (one channel) versions. The AN/PRC-154 Rifleman Radio sets and SFFs were to utilize the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) in a sensitive but unclassified environment (Type 2). In order to mitigate program waveform porting and integration challenges, the SRW application, which is managed by the JTRS Network Enterprise Domain, was developed on a Waveform Development Environment with HMS as the lead platform for porting. Increment 1, Phase 2 was to develop the two channel manpack, two channel handheld, and embedded SFF-B, versions that are all Type 1 compliant for use in a classified environment. Waveforms on the phased sets include Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Satellite Communications, Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW), High Frequency (HF), Enhanced Position Location and Reporting System (EPLRS), Mobile-User Objective System (MUOS), and Single Channel Ground to Air Radio System (SINCGARS). Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) JTRS MIDS is a secure, scalable, modular, wireless, and jam-resistant digital information system currently providing Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN), Link-16, and J-Voice to airborne, ground, and maritime joint and coalition warfighting platforms. MIDS provides real-time and low-cost information and situational awareness via digital and voice, communications within the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Enterprise. The MIDS Program includes MIDS-LVT and the MIDS JTRS Terminal. MIDS-LVT is in full rate production and MIDS JTRS is in evolutionary development and limited production. MIDS JTRS is a ‚Äúform fit function‚Äù replacement for MIDS‚ÄìLVT and adds three additional channels for JTRS waveforms as required by joint and coalition warfighter. JTRS Airborne & Maritime/Fixed Station (AMF) AMF will provide a four-channel, full duplex, software-defined radio integrated into airborne, shipboard, and fixed-station platforms, enabling maritime and airborne forces to communicate seamlessly and with greater efficiency through implementation of five initial waveforms (i.e., Ultra-High Frequency Satellite Communications, Mobile User Objective System, Wideband Network Waveform, Soldier Radio Waveform, and Link 16) providing data, voice, and networking capabilities. JTRS AMF is software- reprogrammable, multi-band/multi-mode capable, mobile ad hoc network capable, and provides simultaneous voice, data, and video communications. The system is flexible enough to provide point-to-point and netted voice and data, whether it is between Service Command Centers, Shipboard Command Centers, Joint Operations Centers or other functional centers (e.g., intelligence, logistics, etc.). AMF will assist U.S. Armed Forces in the conduct of prompt, sustained, and synchronized operations, allowing warfighters the freedom to achieve information dominance in all domains; land, sea, air, space, and information.

The addition of the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) waveform means the radios will also use frequencies above 2 GHz. Waveforms that were to be supported included: * Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) * Single Channel Ground Air Radio System (SINCGARS) with Enhanced SINCGARS Improvement Program (ESIP), 30-88 MHz, FM, frequency hopping and single frequency * HAVE QUICK II military aircraft radio, 225-400 MHz, AM, frequency hopping * UHF SATCOM, 225-400 MHz, MIL-STD-188-181, -182, -183 and -184 protocols * Mobile User Objective System (MUOS): It is important to note that the JTRS HMS manpack is the only radio program of record that will deliver terminals supporting the next generation UHF TACSAT MUOS program. 85% of all MUOS terminals are expected to be ground radios, so if JTRS HMS fails, MUOS (funded in the billions) fails as well - unless a COTS solution is developed. This is only true from the Army viewpoint, other services also use MUOS, not related to JTRS. * Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS), 420-450 MHz spread spectrum * Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) (under development) * Link-4A, -11B, - 16, -22/TADIL tactical data links, 960-1215 MHz+ * VHF-AM civilian Air Traffic Control, 108-137 MHz, 25 (US) and 8.33 (European) kHz channels * High Frequency (HF) - Independent sideband (ISB) with automatic link establishment (ALE), and HF Air Traffic Control (ATC), 1.5-30 MHz * VHF/UHF-FM Land Mobile Radio (LMR), low-band 25-54 MHz, mid-band 72-76 MHz, high-band 136-175 MHz, 220-band 216-225 MHz, UHF/T 380-512 MHz, 800-band 764-869 MHz, TV-band 686-960 MHz, includes P25 public safety and homeland defense standard * civilian marine VHF-FM radio, 156 MHz band * Second generation Anti-jam Tactical UHF Radio for NATO (SATURN), 225-400 MHz PSK Anti-jam * Identification Friend or Foe (IFF), includes Mark X & XII/A with Selective Identification Feature (SIF) and Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS), Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) and Traffic Alert & Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), and Automatic Dependent Surveillance ‚Äì Addressable (ADS-A) and Broadcast (ADS-B) functionality, 1030 & 1090 MHz * Digital Wideband Transmission System (DWTS) Shipboard system for high capacity secure & nonsecure, line-of-sight (LOS), ship-to-ship, and ship-to-shore, 1350-1850 MHz * Soldier Radio & Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), 1.755-1.850, 2.450-2.483.5 GHz, Army Land Warrior program 802.11 * Cellular telephone & PCS, includes multiple US and overseas standards and NSA/NIST Type 1 through 4 COMSEC (SCIP) * Mobile Satellite Service (MSS), includes both VHF and UHF MSS bands and both fielded and emerging low Earth orbit and medium Earth orbit systems and standards, such as Iridium, Globalstar, et al.

In March 2006, the JPEO recommended changing the management structure, reducing the scope of the project, extending the deadline, and adding money. The JPEO's recommendations were accepted. The program is focusing on the toughest part: transformational networking. The JTRS radio was to be a telephone, computer and router in one box that can transmit from 2 MHz to 2 GHz. A September 2006 Government Accountability Office report said these changes had helped reduce the risk of more cost and schedule overruns to \\"moderate.\\"Restructured JTRS Program Reduces Risk, but Significant Challenges Remain The U.S. military no longer plans to quickly replace all of its 750,000 tactical radios. The program is budgeted at $6.8 billion to produce 180,000 radios, an average cost per radio of $37,700. Program delays forced DOD to spend an estimated $11 billion to buy more existing tactical radios, such as the U.S. Marine Corps' Integrated, Intra-Squad Radio, the AN/PRC-117F and the AN/PRC-150. On June 22, 2007, the Joint Program Executive Office issued the first JTRS-Approved radio (not JTRS-Certified) production contract. It gave Harris Corporation $2.7 billion and Thales Communications Inc. $3.5 billion for first-year procurement and allowed the firms to compete for more parts of the five-year program. Harris could make up to $7 billion; Thales, $9 billion.Harris, Thales Compete Multi-Billion JTRS Radio Procurement defense- update.com, July 3, 2007.

It was led by the Navy and grew out of the Navy's previous Digital Modular Radio program. Cluster 4, led by the Air Force, aimed to provide radios to Air Force and Navy fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. In 2004, Clusters 3 and 4 were combined into the Airborne and Maritime / Fixed-Station program. In 2006, the Army helicopter radio was added to this cluster. In early 2008, JTRS AMF attained Milestone B after it received an additional $700 million. Cost estimates conducted by OSD's CAIG determined that the original amount, just over $500 million, was too little. On March 28, 2008, Lockheed Martin announced that the JTRS Joint Program Executive Office picked it to design and provide tactical communications and networking gear for the Air Force, Army, Navy and other users. The initial System Development and Demonstration (SDD) contract value is $766 million. Subcontractors will include BAE Systems, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon. Work will be conducted at Scottsdale, Ariz.; San Diego, Calif.; Tampa, Fla.; Fort Wayne, Ind.; Gaithersburg, Md.; St. Paul, Minn.; Wayne, N.J.; Charleston, S.C.; and Chantilly and Reston, Va. * MIDS JTRS - In 2006, the JTRS program took over the effort to improve the Multifunctional Information Distribution System Low Volume Terminal (MIDS-LVT) design, which was developed by a 5-nation consortium in the 1990s.

It is a ten stage generator. The main discharge is on the left. The nine smaller sparks that can be seen in the image are the spark gaps that connect the charged capacitors in series. A Marx generator is an electrical circuit first described by Erwin Otto Marx in 1924.. This reference is suspect: the year 1924 and volume 25 do not match; the year 1924 corresponds to volume 45; volume 25 would be too early for Marx. Volker Weiss says 1925 and volume 45 which would also be wrong. Electrical World https://books.google.com/books?id=o3FEAQAAIAAJ&hl;=en suggests Marx' Flashover testing article was June 11, 1925. Its purpose is to generate a high-voltage pulse from a low-voltage DC supply. Marx generators are used in high-energy physics experiments, as well as to simulate the effects of lightning on power-line gear and aviation equipment. A bank of 36 Marx generators is used by Sandia National Laboratories to generate X-rays in their Z Machine. Principle of operation Marx generator diagrams; Although the left capacitor has the greatest charge rate, the generator is typically allowed to charge for a long period of time, and all capacitors eventually reach the same charge voltage.The circuit generates a high-voltage pulse by charging a number of capacitors in parallel, then suddenly connecting them in series. See the circuit above. At first, n capacitors (C) are charged in parallel to a voltage VC by a high-voltage DC power supply through the resistors (RC). The spark gaps used as switches have the voltage VC across them, but the gaps have a breakdown voltage greater than VC, so they all behave as open circuits while the capacitors charge. The last gap isolates the output of the generator from the load; without that gap, the load would prevent the capacitors from charging. To create the output pulse, the first spark gap is caused to break down (triggered); the breakdown effectively shorts the gap, placing the first two capacitors in series, applying a voltage of about 2VC across the second spark gap.Typical explanation; see, for example, http://www.kronjaeger.com/hv/hv/src/marx/index.html; the issue is more complicated. Another site uses charging inductors instead of resistors: http://hibp.ecse.rpi.edu/~leij/febetron/marx.html. Consequently, the second gap breaks down to add the third capacitor to the \\"stack\\", and the process continues to sequentially break down all of the gaps. This process of the spark gaps connecting the capacitors in series to create the high voltage is called erection. The last gap connects the output of the series \\"stack\\" of capacitors to the load. Ideally, the output voltage will be nVC, the number of capacitors times the charging voltage, but in practice the value is less. Note that none of the charging resistors Rc are subjected to more than the charging voltage even when the capacitors have been erected. The charge available is limited to the charge on the capacitors, so the output is a brief pulse as the capacitors discharge through the load. At some point, the spark gaps stop conducting, and the low-voltage supply begins charging the capacitors again. The principle of multiplying voltage by charging capacitors in parallel and discharging them in series is also used in the voltage multiplier circuit, used to produce high voltages for laser printers and cathode ray tube television sets, which has similarities to this circuit. The difference is that the voltage multiplier is powered with alternating current and produces a steady DC output voltage, whereas the Marx generator produces a pulse. Optimization To deliver 5 ns rise time pulses, the Marx generator is often built into a coaxial wave guide. The spark gaps are placed as close as possible together for maximum UV light exchange for minimum jitter. DC HV comes from underneath, pulsed HV leaves at the top into the coaxial line. The double line of spheres in the middle are the spark gaps, all other spheres are to avoid corona discharge. Blue=water capacitor. Grey=solid metal. Black= thin wire. The outer conductor also functions as a vessel, so that the gas and the pressure can be optimized. Proper performance depends upon capacitor selection and the timing of the discharge. Switching times can be improved by doping of the electrodes with radioactive isotopes caesium 137 or nickel 63, and by orienting the spark gaps so that ultraviolet light from a firing spark gap switch illuminates the remaining open spark gaps.E. Kuffel, W. S. Zaengl, J. Kuffel High voltage engineering: fundamentals, Newnes, 2000 , pages 63, 70 Insulation of the high voltages produced is often accomplished by immersing the Marx generator in transformer oil or a high pressure dielectric gas such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Note that the less resistance there is between the capacitor and the charging power supply, the faster it will charge. Thus, in this design, those closer to the power supply will charge quicker than those farther away. If the generator is allowed to charge long enough, all capacitors will attain the same voltage. In the ideal case, the closing of the switch closest to the charging power supply applies a voltage 2V to the second switch. This switch will then close, applying a voltage 3V to the third switch. This switch will then close, resulting in a cascade down the generator that produces nV at the generator output (again, only in the ideal case). The first switch may be allowed to spontaneously break down (sometimes called a self break) during charging if the absolute timing of the output pulse is unimportant. However, it is usually intentionally triggered once all the capacitors in the Marx bank have reached full charge, either by reducing the gap distance, by pulsing an additional trigger electrode (such as a Trigatron), by ionising the air in the gap using a pulsed laser, or by reducing the air pressure within the gap. The charging resistors, Rc, need to be properly sized for both charging and discharging. They are sometimes replaced with inductors for improved efficiency and faster charging. In many generators the resistors are made from plastic or glass tubing filled with dilute copper sulfate solution. These liquid resistors overcome many of the problems experienced by more-conventional solid resistive materials, which have a tendency to lower their resistance over time under high voltage conditions.  Short pulses  The Marx generator is also used to generate short high-power pulses for Pockels cells, driving a TEA laser, ignition of the conventional explosive of a nuclear weapon, and radar pulses. Shortness is relative, as the switching time of even high-speed versions is not less than 1 ns, and thus many low-power electronic devices are faster. In the design of high-speed circuits, electrodynamics is important, and the Marx generator supports this insofar as it uses short thick leads between its components, but the design is nevertheless essentially an electrostatic one. When the first gap breaks down, pure electrostatic theory predicts that the voltage across all stages rises. However, stages are coupled capacitively to ground and serially to each other, and thus each stage encounters a voltage rise that is increasingly weaker the further the stage is from the switching one; the adjacent stage to the switching one therefore encounters the largest voltage rise, and thus switches in turn. As more stages switch, the voltage rise to the remainder increases, which speeds up their operation. Thus a voltage rise fed into the first stage becomes amplified and steepened at the same time. In electrodynamic terms, when the first stage breaks down it creates a spherical electromagnetic wave whose electric field vector is opposed to the static high voltage. This moving electromagnetic field has the wrong orientation to trigger the next stage, and may even reach the load; such noise in front of the edge is undesirable in many switching applications. If the generator is inside a tube of (say) 1 m diameter, it requires around 10 wave reflections for the field to settle to static conditions, which restricts pulse leading edge width to 30 ns or more. Smaller devices are of course faster. The speed of a switch is determined by the speed of the charge carriers, which gets higher with higher voltage, and by the current available to charge the inevitable parasitic capacitance. In solid-state avalanche devices, a high voltage automatically leads to high current. Because the high voltage is applied only for a short time, solid-state switches will not heat up excessively. As compensation for the higher voltages encountered, the later stages have to carry lower charge too. Stage cooling and capacitor recharging also go well together. Stage variants Avalanche diodes can replace a spark gap for stage voltages less than 500 volts. The charge carriers easily leave the electrodes, so no extra ionisation is needed and jitter is low. The diodes also have a longer lifetime than spark gaps. A speedy switching device is an NPN avalanche transistor fitted with a coil between base and emitter. The transistor is initially switched off and about 300 volts exists across its collector-base junction. This voltage is high enough that a charge carrier in this region can create more carriers by impact ionisation, but the probability is too low to form a proper avalanche; instead a somewhat noisy leakage current flows. When the preceding stage switches, the emitter-base junction is pushed into forward bias and the collector-base junction enters full avalanche mode, so charge carriers injected into the collector-base region multiply in a chain reaction. Once the Marx generator has completely fired, voltages everywhere drop, each switch avalanche stops, its matched coil puts its base- emitter junction into reverse bias, and the low static field allows remaining charge carriers to drain out of its collector-base junction.  Applications  One application is so-called boxcar switching of a Pockels cell. Four Marx generators are used, each of the two electrodes of the Pockels cell being connected to a positive pulse generator and a negative pulse generator. Two generators of opposite polarity, one on each electrode, are first fired to charge the Pockels cell into one polarity. This will also partly charge the other two generators but not trigger them, because they have been only partly charged beforehand. Leakage through the Marx resistors needs to be compensated by a small bias current through the generator. At the trailing edge of the boxcar, the two other generators are fired to \\"reverse\\" the cell. Marx generators are used to provide high-voltage pulses for the testing of insulation of electrical apparatus such as large power transformers, or insulators used for supporting power transmission lines. Voltages applied may exceed two million volts for high-voltage apparatus.  See also  * ATLAS-I * Cockcroft-Walton generator ‚Äì a similar circuit which has the same \\"ladder\\" structure.

Another town, Gainsboro, was platted on this site in 1815, but it did not prosper. Kings Mills was established in 1884 as a company town for the King Powder Company, and the Peters Cartridge Company which ceased operations in 1944. The town is in the Mason (513) telephone exchange and is served by the Kings Mills/Kings Island post office (45034). It is in the Kings Local School District. The Little Miami Scenic Trail, which runs from Milford to Spring Valley, passes by the community on the eastern shore of the Little Miami River in the former Little Miami Railroad right-of- way. Kings Island amusement park and Great Wolf Lodge indoor water park are immediately south of the community in Mason.

Every difference of squares may be factored according to the identity :a^2-b^2 = (a+b)(a-b) in elementary algebra. Proof The proof of the factorization identity is straightforward. Starting from the left-hand side, apply the distributive law to get :(a+b)(a-b) = a^2+ba-ab-b^2 By the commutative law, the middle two terms cancel: :ba - ab = 0 leaving :(a+b)(a-b) = a^2-b^2 The resulting identity is one of the most commonly used in mathematics. Among many uses, it gives a simple proof of the AM‚ÄìGM inequality in two variables. The proof just given indicates the scope of the identity in abstract algebra: it will hold in any commutative ring R. Conversely, if this identity holds in a ring R for all pairs of elements a and b of the ring, then R is commutative. To see this, apply the distributive law to the right-hand side of the original equation and get :a^2 + ba - ab - b^2 and for this to be equal to a^2 - b^2, we must have :ba - ab = 0 for all pairs a, b of elements of R, so the ring R is commutative. Geometrical demonstrations 170px The difference of two squares can also be illustrated geometrically as the difference of two square areas in a plane. In the diagram, the shaded part represents the difference between the areas of the two squares, i.e. a^2 - b^2. The area of the shaded part can be found by adding the areas of the two rectangles; a(a-b) + b(a-b), which can be factorized to (a+b)(a-b). Therefore, a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b). Another geometric proof proceeds as follows: We start with the figure shown in the first diagram below, a large square with a smaller square removed from it. The side of the entire square is a, and the side of the small removed square is b. The area of the shaded region is a^2-b^2. A cut is made, splitting the region into two rectangular pieces, as shown in the second diagram. The larger piece, at the top, has width a and height a-b. The smaller piece, at the bottom, has width a-b and height b. Now the smaller piece can be detached, rotated, and placed to the right of the larger piece. In this new arrangement, shown in the last diagram below, the two pieces together form a rectangle, whose width is a+b and whose height is a-b. This rectangle's area is (a+b)(a-b). Since this rectangle came from rearranging the original figure, it must have the same area as the original figure. Therefore, a^2-b^2 = (a+b)(a-b). Image:Difference of two squares geometric proof.png Uses Factorization of polynomials and simplification of expressions The formula for the difference of two squares can be used for factoring polynomials that contain the square of a first quantity minus the square of a second quantity. For example, the polynomial x^4 - 1 can be factored as follows: :x^4 - 1 = (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1) = (x^2 + 1)(x + 1)(x - 1) As a second example, the first two terms of x^2 - y^2 + x - y can be factored as (x + y)(x - y), so we have: :x^2 - y^2 + x - y = (x + y)(x - y) + x - y = (x - y)(x + y + 1) Moreover, this formula can also be used for simplifying expressions: :(a+b)^2-(a-b)^2=(a+b+a-b)(a+b-a+b)=(2a)(2b)=4ab Complex number case: sum of two squares The difference of two squares is used to find the linear factors of the sum of two squares, using complex number coefficients. For example, the complex roots of z^2 + 4 can be found using difference of two squares: :z^2 + 4 : = z^2 - i^2 \\\\cdot 4 (since i^2 = -1) : = z^2 - (2 i)^2 : = (z + 2 i)(z - 2 i) Therefore, the linear factors are (z + 2 i) and (z - 2 i). Since the two factors found by this method are complex conjugates, we can use this in reverse as a method of multiplying a complex number to get a real number. This is used to get real denominators in complex fractions.Complex or imaginary numbers TheMathPage.com, retrieved 22 December 2011 Rationalising denominators The difference of two squares can also be used in the rationalising of irrational denominators.Multiplying Radicals TheMathPage.com, retrieved 22 December 2011 This is a method for removing surds from expressions (or at least moving them), applying to division by some combinations involving square roots. For example: The denominator of \\\\dfrac{5}{\\\\sqrt{3} + 4} can be rationalised as follows: :\\\\dfrac{5}{\\\\sqrt{3} + 4} : = \\\\dfrac{5}{\\\\sqrt{3} + 4} \\\\times \\\\dfrac{\\\\sqrt{3} - 4}{\\\\sqrt{3} - 4} : = \\\\dfrac{5(\\\\sqrt{3} - 4)}{(\\\\sqrt{3} + 4)(\\\\sqrt{3} - 4)} : = \\\\dfrac{5(\\\\sqrt{3} - 4)}{\\\\sqrt{3}^2 - 4^2} : = \\\\dfrac{5(\\\\sqrt{3} - 4)}{3 - 16} : = -\\\\dfrac{5(\\\\sqrt{3} - 4)}{13}. Here, the irrational denominator \\\\sqrt{3} + 4 has been rationalised to 13. Mental arithmetic The difference of two squares can also be used as an arithmetical short cut. If two numbers (whose average is a number which is easily squared) are multiplied, the difference of two squares can be used to give you the product of the original two numbers. For example: : 27 \\\\times 33 = (30 - 3)(30 + 3) Using the difference of two squares, 27 \\\\times 33 can be restated as :a^2 - b^2 which is 30^2 - 3^2 = 891. Difference of two consecutive perfect squares The difference of two consecutive perfect squares is the sum of the two bases n and n+1. This can be seen as follows: : \\\\begin{array}{lcl} (n+1)^2 - n^2 & = & ((n+1)+n)((n+1)-n) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = & 2n+1 \\\\end{array} Therefore, the difference of two consecutive perfect squares is an odd number. Similarly, the difference of two arbitrary perfect squares is calculated as follows: : \\\\begin{array}{lcl} (n+k)^2 - n^2 & = & ((n+k)+n)((n+k)-n) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = & k(2n+k) \\\\end{array} Therefore, the difference of two even perfect squares is a multiple of 4 and the difference of two odd perfect squares is a multiple of 8. Factorization of integers Several algorithms in number theory and cryptography use differences of squares to find factors of integers and detect composite numbers. A simple example is the Fermat factorization method, which considers the sequence of numbers x_i:=a_i^2-N, for a_i:=\\\\left\\\\lceil \\\\sqrt{N}\\\\right\\\\rceil+i. If one of the x_i equals a perfect square b^2, then N=a_i^2-b^2=(a_i+b)(a_i-b) is a (potentially non-trivial) factorization of N. This trick can be generalized as follows. If a^2\\\\equiv b^2 mod N and a ot\\\\equiv \\\\pm b mod N, then N is composite with non-trivial factors \\\\gcd(a-b,N) and \\\\gcd(a+b,N). This forms the basis of several factorization algorithms (such as the quadratic sieve) and can be combined with the Fermat primality test to give the stronger Miller‚ÄìRabin primality test. Generalizations arrows The identity also holds in inner product spaces over the field of real numbers, such as for dot product of Euclidean vectors: :{\\\\mathbf a}\\\\cdot{\\\\mathbf a} - {\\\\mathbf b}\\\\cdot{\\\\mathbf b} = ({\\\\mathbf a}+{\\\\mathbf b})\\\\cdot({\\\\mathbf a}-{\\\\mathbf b}) The proof is identical. By the way, assuming that and have equal norms (which means that their dot squares are equal), it demonstrates analytically the fact that two diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular.

Zopiclone is molecularly distinct from benzodiazepine drugs and is classed as a cyclopyrrolone. However, zopiclone increases the normal transmission of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the central nervous system, via modulating benzodiazepine receptors in the same way that benzodiazepine drugs do. Zopiclone is a sedative. It works by causing a depression or tranquilization of the central nervous system. After prolonged use, the body can become accustomed to the effects of zopiclone. When the dose is then reduced or the drug is abruptly stopped, withdrawal symptoms may result. These can include a range of symptoms similar to those of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Although withdrawal symptoms from therapeutic doses of zopiclone and its isomers (i.e., eszopiclone) do not typically present with convulsions and are therefore not considered life-threatening, patients may experience such significant agitation or anxiety that they seek emergency medical attention. In the United States, zopiclone is not commercially available, although its active stereoisomer, eszopiclone is. Zopiclone is a controlled substance in the United States, Japan, Brazil, and some European countries, and may be illegal to possess without a prescription. However, it is readily available in other countries and is not a controlled substance. Zopiclone is known colloquially as a \\"Z-drug\\". Other Z-drugs include zaleplon and zolpidem and were initially thought to be less addictive than benzodiazepines. However, this appraisal has shifted somewhat in the last few years as cases of addiction and habituation have been presented. Zopiclone is recommended to be taken on a short-term basis, usually no more than a week or two. Daily or continuous use of the drug is not usually advised, and caution must be taken when the compound is used in conjunction with antidepressants, sedatives or other drugs affecting the central nervous system. Medical uses A 7.5 mg zopiclone tablet. Zopiclone is used for the short-term treatment of insomnia where sleep initiation or sleep maintenance are prominent symptoms. Long-term use is not recommended, as tolerance, dependence, and addiction can occur. One low-quality study found that zopiclone is ineffective in improving sleep quality or increasing sleep time in shift workers - more research in this area has been recommended. Specific populations Elderly Zopiclone, similar to other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drugs, causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol consumption increases these impairments. Partial, but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments. Zopiclone increases postural sway and increases the number of falls in older people, as well as cognitive side effects. Falls are a significant cause of death in older people. An extensive review of the medical literature regarding the management of insomnia and the elderly found that considerable evidence of the effectiveness and lasting benefits of nondrug treatments for insomnia exist. Compared with the benzodiazepines, the nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics, such as zopiclone, offer few if any advantages in efficacy or tolerability in elderly persons. Newer agents such as the melatonin receptor agonists may be more suitable and effective for the management of chronic insomnia in elderly people. Long-term use of sedative-hypnotics for insomnia lacks an evidence base and is discouraged for reasons that include concerns about such potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment (anterograde amnesia), daytime sedation, motor incoordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls. In addition, the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drugs remains to be determined. Liver disease Patients with liver disease eliminate zopiclone much more slowly than normal patients and in addition experience exaggerated pharmacological effects of the drug. Miscellaneous Patients who suffer from muscle weakness due to myasthenia gravis or have poor respiratory reserves due to severe chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or other lung disease, nor can a patient with any untreated abnormality of the thyroid gland. Adverse reactions Sleeping pills, including zopiclone, have been associated with an increased risk of death. The British National Formulary states adverse reactions as follows: \\"taste disturbance (some report a metallic like taste); less commonly nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, headache; rarely amnesia, confusion, depression, hallucinations, nightmares; very rarely light headedness, incoordination, paradoxical effects [...] and sleep-walking also reported\\". Contraindications Zopiclone causes impaired driving skills similar to those of benzodiazepines. Long-term users of hypnotic drugs for sleep disorders develop only partial tolerance to adverse effects on driving with users of hypnotic drugs even after 1 year of use still showing an increased motor vehicle accident rate. Patients who drive motor vehicles should not take zopiclone unless they stop driving due to a significant increased risk of accidents in zopiclone users. Zopiclone induces impairment of psychomotor function. Driving or operating machinery should be avoided after taking zopiclone as effects can carry over to the next day, including impaired hand eye coordination. EEG and sleep It causes similar alterations on EEG readings and sleep architecture as benzodiazepines and causes disturbances in sleep architecture on withdrawal as part of its rebound effect. Zopiclone reduces both delta waves and the number of high-amplitude delta waves whilst increasing low-amplitude waves. Zopiclone reduces the total amount of time spent in REM sleep as well as delaying its onset. Cognitive behavioral therapy has been found to be superior to zopiclone in the treatment of insomnia and has been found to have lasting effects on sleep quality for at least a year after therapy. Overdose Zopiclone is sometimes used as a method of suicide. It has a similar fatality index to that of benzodiazepine drugs, apart from temazepam, which is particularly toxic in overdose.Buckley NA, Dawson AH, Whyte IM, McManus P, Ferguson N.Correlations between prescriptions and drugs taken in self-poisoning: Implications for prescribers and drug regulation.Med J Aust (in press) Deaths have occurred from zopiclone overdose, alone or in combination with other drugs. Overdose of zopiclone may present with excessive sedation and depressed respiratory function that may progress to coma and possibly death. Zopiclone combined with alcohol, opiates, or other central nervous system depressants may be even more likely to lead to fatal overdoses. Zopiclone overdosage can be treated with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil, which displaces zopiclone from its binding site on the benzodiazepine receptor, thereby rapidly reversing its effects. Serious effects on the heart may also occur from a zopiclone overdose when combined with piperazine. Death certificates show the number of zopiclone- related deaths is on the rise. When taken alone, it usually is not fatal, but when mixed with alcohol or other drugs such as opioids, or in patients with respiratory, or hepatic disorders, the risk of a serious and fatal overdose increases. Interactions Zopiclone also interacts with trimipramine and caffeine. Alcohol has an additive effect when combined with zopiclone, enhancing the adverse effects including the overdose potential of zopiclone significantly. Due to these risks and the increased risk for dependence, alcohol should be avoided when using zopiclone. Erythromycin appears to increase the absorption rate of zopiclone and prolong its elimination half- life, leading to increased plasma levels and more pronounced effects. Itraconazole has a similar effect on zopiclone pharmacokinetics as erythromycin. The elderly may be particularly sensitive to the erythromycin and itraconazole drug interaction with zopiclone. Temporary dosage reduction during combined therapy may be required, especially in the elderly. Rifampicin causes a very notable reduction in half-life of zopiclone and peak plasma levels, which results in a large reduction in the hypnotic effect of zopiclone. Phenytoin and carbamazepine may also provoke similar interactions. Ketoconazole and sulfaphenazole interfere with the metabolism of zopiclone. Nefazodone impairs the metabolism of zopiclone leading to increased zopiclone levels and marked next-day sedation. Pharmacology The therapeutic pharmacological properties of zopiclone include hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and myorelaxant properties. Zopiclone and benzodiazepines bind to the same sites on GABAA-containing receptors, causing an enhancement of the actions of GABA to produce the therapeutic and adverse effects of zopiclone. The metabolite of zopiclone called desmethylzopiclone is also pharmacologically active, although it has predominately anxiolytic properties. One study found some slight selectivity for zopiclone on Œ±1 and Œ±5 subunits, although it is regarded as being unselective in its binding to Œ±1, Œ±2, Œ±3, and Œ±5 GABAA benzodiazepine receptor complexes. Desmethylzopiclone has been found to have partial agonist properties, unlike the parent drug zopiclone, which is a full agonist. The mechanism of action of zopiclone is similar to benzodiazepines, with similar effects on locomotor activity and on dopamine and serotonin turnover. A meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials that compared benzodiazepines to zopiclone or other Z drugs such as zolpidem and zaleplon has found few clear and consistent differences between zopiclone and the benzodiazepines in sleep onset latency, total sleep duration, number of awakenings, quality of sleep, adverse events, tolerance, rebound insomnia, and daytime alertness. Zopiclone is in the cyclopyrrolone family of drugs. Other cyclopyrrolone drugs include suriclone. Zopiclone, although molecularly different from benzodiazepines, shares an almost identical pharmacological profile as benzodiazepines, including anxiolytic properties. Its mechanism of action is by binding to the benzodiazepine site and acting as a full agonist, which in turn positively modulates benzodiazepine-sensitive GABAA receptors and enhances GABA binding at the GABAA receptors to produce zopiclone's pharmacological properties. In addition to zopiclone's benzodiazepine pharmacological properties, it also has some barbiturate-like properties. In EEG studies, zopiclone significantly increases the energy of the beta frequency band and shows characteristics of high- voltage slow waves, desynchronization of hippocampal theta waves, and an increase in the energy of the delta frequency band. Zopiclone increases both stage 2 and slow-wave sleep (SWS), while zolpidem, an Œ±1-selective compound, increases only SWS and causes no effect on stage 2 sleep. Zopiclone is less selective to the Œ±1 site and has higher affinity to the Œ±2 site than zaleplon. Zopiclone is therefore very similar pharmacologically to benzodiazepines. Pharmacokinetics Two major zopiclone metabolites. After oral administration, zopiclone is rapidly absorbed, with a bioavailability around 75‚Äì80%. Time to peak plasma concentration is 1‚Äì2 hours. A high-fat meal preceding zopiclone administration does not change absorption (as measured by AUC), but reduces peak plasma levels and delays its occurrence, thus may delay the onset of therapeutic effects. The plasma protein-binding of zopiclone has been reported to be weak, between 45 and 80% (mean 52‚Äì59%). It is rapidly and widely distributed to body tissues, including the brain, and is excreted in urine, saliva, and breast milk. Zopiclone is partly extensively metabolized in the liver to form an active N-demethylated derivative (N-desmethylzopiclone) and an inactive zopiclone-N-oxide. Hepatic enzymes playing the most significant role in zopiclone metabolism are CYP3A4 and CYP2E1. In addition, about 50% of the administered dose is decarboxylated and excreted via the lungs. In urine, the N-demethyl and N-oxide metabolites account for 30% of the initial dose. Between 7 and 10% of zopiclone is recovered from the urine, indicating extensive metabolism of the drug before excretion. The terminal elimination half-life of zopiclone ranges from 3.5 to 6.5 hours (5 hours on average). The pharmacokinetics of zopiclone in humans are stereoselective. After oral administration of the racemic mixture, Cmax (time to maximum plasma concentration), area under the plasma time-concentration curve (AUC) and terminal elimination half-life values are higher for the dextrorotatory enantiomers, owing to the slower total clearance and smaller volume of distribution (corrected by the bioavailability), compared with the levorotatory enantiomer. In urine, the concentrations of the dextrorotatory enantiomers of the N-demethyl and N-oxide metabolites are higher than those of the respective antipodes. The pharmacokinetics of zopiclone are altered by aging and are influenced by renal and hepatic functions. In severe chronic kidney failure, the area under the curve value for zopiclone was larger and the half-life associated with the elimination rate constant longer, but these changes were not considered to be clinically significant. Sex and race have not been found to interact with pharmacokinetics of zopiclone. Chemistry The melting point of zopiclone is 178 ¬∞C. Zopiclone's solubility in water, at room temperature (25 ¬∞C) are 0.151 mg/mL. The logP value of zopiclone is 0.8. Detection in biological fluids Zopiclone may be measured in blood, plasma, or urine by chromatographic methods. Plasma concentrations are typically less than 100 Œºg/l during therapeutic use, but frequently exceed 100 Œºg/l in automotive vehicle operators arrested for impaired driving ability and may exceed 1000 Œºg/l in acutely poisoned patients. Post mortem blood concentrations are usually in a range of 0.4-3.9 mg/l in victims of fatal acute overdose.Kratzsch C, Tenberken O, Peters FT et al.

History Zopiclone was developed and first introduced in 1986 by Rh√¥ne-Poulenc S.A., now part of Sanofi-Aventis, the main worldwide manufacturer. Initially, it was promoted as an improvement on benzodiazepines, but a recent meta-analysis found it was no better than benzodiazepines in any of the aspects assessed. On April 4, 2005, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration listed zopiclone under schedule IV, due to evidence that the drug has addictive properties similar to benzodiazepines. Zopiclone, as traditionally sold worldwide, is a racemic mixture of two stereoisomers, only one of which is active. In 2005, the pharmaceutical company Sepracor of Marlborough, Massachusetts began marketing the active stereoisomer eszopiclone under the name Lunesta in the United States. This had the consequence of placing what is a generic drug in most of the world under patent control in the United States. Generic forms of Lunesta have since become available in the United States. Zopiclone is currently available off-patent in a number of European countries, as well as Brazil, Canada, and Hong Kong. The eszopiclone/zopiclone difference is in the dosage--the strongest eszopiclone dosage contains 3 mg of the therapeutic stereoisomer, whereas the highest zopiclone dosage (10 mg) contains 5 mg of the active stereoisomer. The two agents have not yet been studied in head-to-head clinical trials to determine the existence of any potential clinical differences (efficacy, side effects, developing dependence on the drug, safety, etc.). Society and culture Recreational use Zopiclone has the potential for misuse and dosage escalation, drug abuse, and drug dependence. It is abused orally and sometimes intravenously, and often combined with alcohol to achieve a combined sedative hypnotic‚Äîalcohol euphoria. Patients abusing the drug are also at risk of dependence. Withdrawal symptoms can be seen after long-term use of normal doses even after a gradual reduction regimen. The Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties recommends zopiclone prescriptions not exceed 7 to 10 days, owing to concerns of addiction, tolerance, and physical dependence. Two types of drug misuse can occur: either recreational misuse, wherein the drug is taken to achieve a high, or when the drug is continued long-term against medical advice. Zopiclone may be more addictive than benzodiazepines. Those with a history of substance misuse or mental health disorders may be at an increased risk of high-dose zopiclone misuse. High dose misuse of zopiclone and increasing popularity amongst drug abusers who have been prescribed with zopiclone The symptoms of zopiclone addiction can include depression, dysphoria, hopelessness, slow thoughts, social isolation, worrying, sexual anhedonia, and nervousness. Zopiclone and other sedative hypnotic drugs are detected frequently in cases of people suspected of driving under the influence of drugs. Other drugs, including the benzodiazepines and zolpidem, are also found in high numbers of suspected drugged drivers. Many drivers have blood levels far exceeding the therapeutic dose range and often in combination with other alcohol, illegal, or prescription drugs of abuse, suggesting a high degree of abuse potential for benzodiazepines, zolpidem, and zopiclone. Zopiclone, which at prescribed doses causes moderate impairment the next day, has been estimated to increase the risk of vehicle accidents by 50%, causing an increase of 503 excess accidents per 100,000 persons. Zaleplon or other nonimpairing sleep aids were recommended be used instead of zopiclone to reduce traffic accidents. Zopiclone as with other hypnotic drugs is sometimes abused to carry out criminal acts such as sexual assaults. Zopiclone has crosstolerance with barbiturates and is able to suppress barbiturate withdrawal signs. It is frequently self-administered intravenously in studies on monkeys, suggesting a high risk of abuse potential. Zopiclone is in the top ten medications obtained using a false prescription in France.

The 76th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff played between the National League (NL) champion Pittsburgh Pirates (98‚Äì64) and the American League (AL) champion Baltimore Orioles (102‚Äì57). The Pirates won in seven games, becoming the fourth team in World Series history to come back from a three-games-to-one deficit to win the Series. This marked the second time in the 1970s the Pirates won a World Series Game 7 on the road against the Orioles, the previous time being in the 1971 World Series. The Pirates were famous for adopting Sister Sledge's hit song \\"We Are Family\\" as their theme song during the 1979 season. Willie Stargell, pitcher Bruce Kison, and catcher Manny Sanguill√©n were the only players left over from the Pirates team that defeated the Orioles in 1971, and Orioles' pitcher Jim Palmer, shortstop Mark Belanger, and manager Earl Weaver were the only remaining Orioles from the 1971 team. Grant Jackson pitched for the Orioles in the 1971 series and for the Pirates in the 1979 series. In this Series, it was the AL team's \\"turn\\" to play by NL rules, meaning no designated hitter and the Orioles' pitchers would have to bat. While this resulted in Tim Stoddard getting his first major league hit and runs batted in in Game 4, overall, it hurt the Orioles because Lee May, their designated hitter for much of the season and a key part of their offense, was only able to bat three times in the whole series. Willie Stargell, who was named the World Series Most Valuable Player, hit .400 with a record seven extra-base hits and matched Reggie Jackson's record of 25 total bases, set in 1977. The 1979 Pirates were the last team to win Game 7 of a World Series on the road until the San Francisco Giants defeated the Royals in Kansas City to win Game 7 of the series. With the Steelers having already won Super Bowl XIII (they would later repeat in Super Bowl XIV following the Pirates' championship), Pittsburgh also became the third city to win both the Super Bowl and the World Series in the same season or calendar year. New York's Jets and Mets won championships in the 1969 calendar year, followed by Baltimore (Orioles and Colts) in the 1970 season, New York (Mets and Giants) in the 1986 season, and Boston/New England in the 2004 (Red Sox and Patriots) and 2018 seasons (Red Sox and Patriots). Background Baltimore Orioles These same two teams also met in . Earl Weaver's Orioles had won the first two games of that series only to lose to Danny Murtaugh's Pirates in seven. This time Pittsburgh manager Chuck Tanner was looking to win a Series of his own. Gone were the likes of slugger Boog Powell and defensive wizard Brooks Robinson‚Äîshortstop Mark Belanger and pitcher Jim Palmer were the only two remaining players from the 1971 roster. A young (23-year-old) \\"Steady Eddie\\" Murray was a staple at first-base and an emerging superstar. The only other real \\"star\\" hitter on the team was right- fielder Ken Singleton who set career highs in home runs, 35, and runs batted in, 111, in the regular season. Center fielder Al Bumbry provided the speed, 37 swipes, and outfielder Gary Roenicke and third-baseman Doug DeCinces provided some additional power. The talented pitching staff was captained by veteran catcher Rick Dempsey. The starters were led by 1979 Cy Young Award winner Mike Flanagan (23‚Äì9, 3.08), Scott McGregor (13‚Äì6, 3.35), Steve Stone (11‚Äì7, 3.77) and Jim Palmer (10‚Äì6, 3.30). The bullpen helped with 30 wins against only 13 losses led by Don Stanhouse (7‚Äì3, 21 saves) and Tippy Martinez (10‚Äì3, 2.88). The Orioles won the American League East rather easily, finishing eight games ahead of the second place Milwaukee Brewers. Many considered the series a bit of a whitewash, but it was clear the Orioles were the better team overall. Pittsburgh Pirates On the other hand, these Pittsburgh Pirates struggled early in the season, eventually winning the National League East by just two games over the Montreal Expos. Only after getting infielders, Tim Foli (from the New York Mets) and Bill Madlock (from the San Francisco Giants), did the Pirates start winning consistently. The great Roberto Clemente had inspired the 1971 team toward the title and the key ingredient to this team was his successor and spiritual leader, 38-year-old Willie \\"Pops\\" Stargell. His clubhouse demeanor, a simple good-heartedness and friendly manner, helped keep the Pirates loose during a tight divisional race with a surprise sweep of the always powerful Cincinnati Reds in the League Championship Series. The Bucs lineup featured the National League leader in stolen bases, Omar Moreno with 77; team runs batted in leader, Dave Parker with 94, and two-time batting champion, Bill Madlock (1975, 1976). Madlock would add two more batting titles in 1981 and 1983. The pitching staff was a ragtag bunch led by the \\"Candy-Man\\" John Candelaria's 14 wins (nine losses), with five other pitchers winning ten or more games. The tall and lean Kent Tekulve had 31 saves, good for second in the league, while winning ten games. \\"Pops\\" Stargell would hit three home runs in this series becoming the oldest player to win both the regular season MVP and the World Series MVP. His \\"Family\\" would persevere after losing three out of the first four games, giving Earl Weaver and his Orioles a d√©j√† vu nightmare when the Bucs came back to win in seven games. Summary Matchups Game 1 Game 1 was originally scheduled for Tuesday, October 9 but was postponed due to a wintry mix of rain and snow.Speciale, Christina. \\"First Measurable Snow,\\" WeatherWorks, Sunday, October 10, 2013. When it was played the following night, the first-pitch temperature of 41 ¬∞F (5 ¬∞C) was the coldest in the history of the Fall Classic until it was eclipsed 18 years later in Game 4 of the 1997 World Series. A steady rain that fell throughout the contest also factored into the six total errors, three committed by each team. All five Orioles runs were scored in the first inning; two on a throwing error by second baseman Phil Garner, followed by one on a wild pitch by starter Bruce Kison and the final two on a Doug DeCinces home run. A pair of RBIs each for Garner (two-out single in the sixth) and Willie Stargell (groundout in the fourth, leadoff homer in the eighth) sparked a Pirates comeback that fell a run short. Game 2 This time, the Pirates struck first with two in the second on an RBI single by Bill Madlock and a sacrifice fly by catcher Ed Ott. The Orioles countered in the bottom half of the inning with an Eddie Murray homer. Murray would also tie the game in the sixth by doubling in Ken Singleton. Murray tried to put the Orioles ahead in the same inning by tagging and attempting to score on a line-out to right by John Lowenstein, but Dave Parker threw him out easily. Making the decision to send Murray was made that much more odd by the fact that Parker's throw to the plate arrived well ahead of him. Murray tried to bowl Ott over at the plate, but the stocky Ott held fast, staying on his feet. Murray also made a questionable base running decision in the eighth. With Murray on second and Doug DeCinces on first with no outs, Lowenstein grounded to shortstop Tim Foli. Murray strangely stopped instead of running out the force play. Foli attempted a tag which Murray eluded, and then threw to Phil Garner at second to force DeCinces. Murray's hesitation allowed Garner to throw to third and catch him in a rundown. Murray slowed up returning to second when he should have sped back since he was entitled to the base with DeCinces being forced out. Murray would not collect another hit or RBI for the rest of the Series. In the ninth, after a two-out single by Ott and a walk to Garner, Manny Sanguill√©n pinch-hit for Don Robinson and hacked a high and outside fastball from Don Stanhouse into right for a single. Ott barely slid past the outstretched arms of catcher Rick Dempsey to score the winning run, after Murray had questionably cut-off a strong throw from RF Ken Singleton. Kent Tekulve retired the side in the ninth for the save. Game 3 The Pirates jumped out to an early 3-0 lead on a Dave Parker sacrifice fly in the first and a one-out, two-run double by Garner in the second. A Benny Ayala one-out, two-run homer cut the Orioles' deficit to one just before a 67-minute rain delay in the middle of the third inning. The Orioles seized the momentum after play resumed by scoring five runs in the fourth, highlighted by a Kiko Garcia bases-loaded triple that chased Pirates starter John Candelaria from the game along with an RBI single by Ken Singleton and groundout by Doug DeCinces off of Enrique Romo. Garcia added a two-out RBI single in the seventh, finishing the evening going 4-for-4 with four RBI. Scott McGregor allowed only one other run after the second (on Bill Madlock's RBI single in the sixth after a Willie Stargell double) and pitched a complete game to give the Orioles a 2‚Äì1 series lead. Game 4 The Pirates seized an early 4-0 lead in the second on a leadoff homer by Stargell, a two-run double by Ott and an Omar Moreno two-out RBI single. The first two were among five straight hits that effectively ended starter Dennis Mart√≠nez's afternoon. The Orioles countered with three runs in the third off Jim Bibby on consecutive one-out doubles by Garcia (2 RBI) and Ken Singleton. The Pirates stretched their lead to 6-3 on RBI doubles by John Milner and Parker in the fifth and sixth innings respectively. In the eighth, Earl Weaver once again showed some strategic genius. With one out and the bases loaded, Pirates manager Chuck Tanner sent in submarining relief ace Kent Tekulve to face right-handed hitting Gary Roenicke. Weaver countered by pinch-hitting lefty John Lowenstein, figuring the lefty would be better able to hit Tekulve's sidewhip pitches. Lowenstein made the move pay off by slamming a two-run double. After a walk loaded the bases again, Weaver sent another lefty hitter, Terry Crowley, to bat for Dave Skaggs. Crowley smashed another two-run double off Tekulve to give the Orioles the lead. To add insult to injury, pitcher Tim Stoddard, batting because Weaver was out of pinch hitters at that point, followed with an RBI single. An RBI force-out by Bumbry ended the scoring. Game 5 With a world championship on the line and Game 1 starter Bruce Kison injured, Chuck Tanner decided to go with little-used veteran left-hander Jim Rooker as his starter. He would let Rooker go as long as possible, then bring in Bert Blyleven to finish, saving his two best pitchers, sore- shouldered John Candelaria and Jim Bibby for Games 6 and 7, if played. The risky move more than paid off as Rooker gave Tanner five good innings, retiring the first 10 batters, no-hitting for four innings, and holding the Orioles to one run in the fifth when Gary Roenicke scored on a double play grounder. The Pirate bats finally came alive against Mike Flanagan in the sixth on a sacrifice fly by Willie Stargell and an RBI single by Bill Madlock. The Pirates added two more in the seventh on a RBI triple by Tim Foli and a RBI double by Dave Parker, and then three more in the eighth on a RBI single by Phil Garner and a two-run single by Foli. Thanks to the unexpected performance from Rooker, a 4‚Äìfor‚Äì4 day from Madlock, and Foli's three RBIs, the Pirates had staved off defeat. Chuck Tanner's mother died the morning of Game 5 (this was mentioned during the telecast by announcer Howard Cosell). The 1960 World Series hero Bill Mazeroski threw out the first ball in Game 5, which would be Three Rivers Stadium's final World Series game and, to date, the last World Series game played in Pittsburgh. Game 6 Back home at Memorial Stadium, local baseball coach Mary Dobkin threw out the ceremonial first pitch. The Oriole bats continued to be unexpectedly cold as John Candelaria and Jim Palmer locked into a scoreless duel through six innings. Dave Parker broke the ice with a RBI single in the seventh, followed by a Stargell sacrifice fly. The Pirates added two more runs in the eighth on a Bill Robinson sac fly and a RBI single by Omar Moreno. After the game Howard Cosell in his limo was surrounded and attacked by angry Oriole fans with shaving cream, which prompted Baltimore police to complement his private security for Game 7. Game 7 The Pirates capped an amazing comeback on the strength of Willie Stargell, who went 4‚Äìfor‚Äì5 with a single, two doubles, and a towering two-run homer in the sixth off Scott McGregor. McGregor pitched eight solid innings in a losing cause. For insurance in the ninth, Omar Moreno collected an RBI single, while another run scored when Dave Parker and Bill Robinson were hit by pitches back-to-back, scoring Moreno. Orioles manager Earl Weaver made five pitching changes in the ninth inning in an attempt to keep the game within reach. The O's only run came on a Rich Dauer homer in the third, the team's second RBI in the last three games. Significantly, Eddie Murray, the Orioles' main offensive threat, was 0-for-21 in the final five games of the Series, including a fly-out to Parker to end the eighth with the bases loaded (following an intentional walk to Ken Singleton). Following their six run outburst in the eighth inning of Game 4, the Birds scored only two runs on 17 hits over the series final 28 innings. Pirates reliever Grant Jackson got the win after 2 innings after relieving Don Robinson, who had relieved Jim Bibby who lasted four innings and allowed the lone Oriole run. U.S. President Jimmy Carter made an appearance in Game 7‚Äîhe threw out the first pitch‚Äîand after the game made a visit to the victorious Pittsburgh clubhouse. Prior to the ceremonial first pitch, Bill Schustik played the National Anthem. Pirates closer Kent Tekulve earned a save. With the exception of winning the 2013 National League Wild Card Game this is the last postseason series the Pirates have won. Composite box 1979 World Series (4‚Äì3): Pittsburgh Pirates (N.L.) over Baltimore Orioles (A.L.) Records *Five Pirates had ten or more hits in this series, a World Series record. Willie Stargell and Phil Garner had 12 hits each, Omar Moreno 11, and Tim Foli and Dave Parker 10 each. Bill Madlock came close to a sixth with nine hits. The Baltimore Orioles set a record by manager Earl Weaver for most pitchers used in a single inning (five). Uniforms The Pirates wore four different uniform combinations during the series: * gold cap, black jersey and gold pants for Games 1 and 5 * black cap, gold jersey and black pants for Games 2, 6 and 7 * black cap and solid white pinstriped uniform for Game 3 * black cap and solid gold uniform for Game 4. The Orioles wore three different uniform combinations of their own: * white cap, orange jersey and white pants for Games 1 and 7 * white cap, white jersey and white pants for Games 2 and 6 * white cap, grey jersey and grey pants for Games 3, 4 and 5 Broadcasting This was the first World Series in which the participating teams' announcers were not involved in the play-calling on national radio. (Network television had ended the practice two years earlier.) For the '79 Classic, Vin Scully and Sparky Anderson handled the play-by-play work for the CBS Radio Network. The Series was televised by ABC Sports, with play-by-play announcers Keith Jackson (in Baltimore) and Al Michaels (in Pittsburgh), and color commentators Howard Cosell and Don Drysdale. ABC's broadcast was also simulcast over the Orioles' and Pirates' respective local television outlets, CBS affiliates WMAR-TV in Baltimore and KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh, in addition to ABC's own affiliates WJZ- TV and WTAE-TV. *In 2006 a \\"collector's edition\\" DVD box set, featuring the complete ABC telecasts of all seven games, was issued by Major League Baseball and A&E; Home Video.

Semi-professionals are not amateur because they receive regular payment from their team (company), but at a much lower rate than a full-time professional athlete. As a result, players may have (or seek) full- time employment elsewhere. A semipro player/team could also be one that represents a place of employment that only the employees are allowed to play on. In this case, it is considered semipro because their employer pays them, but for their regular job, not for playing on the company's team. Origin The San Francisco Olympic Club fielded an American football team in 1890. That year, the Olympic Club was accused by a rival club of enticing athletes to jump to its ranks with offers of jobs. An investigation by the Amateur Athletic Union ruled that the Olympics' practice was not actually professionalism but only a \\"semi\\" form of it, inventing the term \\"semi-pro\\". Although the Amateur Athletic Union did not like the idea very much, it decided that clubs could indeed offer employment without losing their amateur status or compromising the athlete. North America In North America, semi- professional athletes and teams were far more common in the early and mid-20th century than they are today. There are many benefits, such as collegiate eligibility and the attendant scholarships, in maintaining amateur status (unlike the Amateur Athletic Union, the NCAA forbids any sort of compensation outside of scholarships, including job offers tied to their playing). Eligibility for participation in the Olympics in some sports is still dependent upon maintaining a purely amateur status (although far less so than was previously the case), and such athletes may be supported by government money, business sponsorships, and other systems. At the same time, professional sports have become such a massive and remunerative business that even many low-level feeder teams can afford to have fully professional athletes. In Canada, semi-professionalism is prevalent in junior ice hockey, in which the top level players (most of whom are teenagers still in, or just out of, high school) are paid at a semi-professional level. This is not the case in the United States, where college ice hockey dominates at that age group; the junior leagues in the United States generally operate as fully amateur teams to maintain the players' eligibility to play in college. Lower- end minor leagues and more obscure sports often operate at a semi-professional level due to cost concerns. Because the cost of running a fully professional American football team is prohibitive, semi-pro football is common at the adult levels, particularly in the indoor variety, providing an outlet for players who have used up their NCAA eligibility and have no further use for maintaining amateur status; as a sport that normally plays only one game per week, football is especially suited for semi-pro play. The National Lacrosse League, whose teams also typically play only one game per week, pays a salary that is enough to be considered fully professional, but players also are able to pursue outside employment to supplement their income. The lowest levels of organized baseball are also effectively semi-professional, as the short summer seasons and low salaries require players to hold jobs in the offseason to make ends meet. United Kingdom There are several hundred semi-professional football teams at non-League level. The bottom division of the English Football League (the fourth tier of the English football league system) has traditionally been the cut-off point between professional (\\"full-time\\") and semi-professional (\\"part-time\\") in English football. However, many teams in the top non-League competition, the National League, have become \\"full-time\\" professional clubs in an effort to achieve League status. Many former League clubs also remain as fully professional teams following relegation to the lower leagues at least for as long as they retain a large enough average attendance to generate the income needed to pay the players. Women's football in England is semi-professional at the top levels, as finances depend on promotion and relegation both of parent male teams and of the female teams themselves. Full professionalism for women is still in the planning stages; top female players often depend on other sources of income (such as coaching and physical training), and many attend university or college while playing. In Scottish football, semi-professional teams compete at all levels below the Scottish Premiership, with most teams below the second-level Scottish Championship being semi-professional. Historically, English rugby league and rugby union have had one full-time professional division, with semi- professional divisions at the next level down. The second tier of union, the RFU Championship, became fully professional beginning with the 2009‚Äì10 season.

Offshore volcanoes form islands, resulting in a volcanic island arc. Generally, volcanic arcs result from the subduction of an oceanic tectonic plate under another tectonic plate, and often parallel an oceanic trench. The oceanic plate is saturated with water, and volatiles such as water drastically lower the melting point of the mantle. As the oceanic plate is subducted, it is subjected to greater and greater pressures with increasing depth. This pressure squeezes water out of the plate and introduces it to the mantle. Here the mantle melts and forms magma at depth under the overriding plate. The magma ascends to form an arc of volcanoes parallel to the subduction zone. These should not be confused with hotspot volcanic chains, where volcanoes often form one after another in the middle of a tectonic plate, as the plate moves over the hotspot, and so the volcanoes progress in age from one end of the chain to the other. The Hawaiian Islands form a typical hotspot chain; the older islands (tens of millions of years old) to the northwest are smaller and have more soil than the recently created (400,000 years ago) Hawaii island itself, which is more rocky. Hotspot volcanoes are also known as \\"intra-plate\\" volcanoes, and the islands they create are known as Volcanic Ocean Islands. Volcanic arcs do not generally exhibit such a simple age-pattern. There are two types of volcanic arcs: * oceanic arcs form when oceanic crust subducts beneath other oceanic crust on an adjacent plate, creating a volcanic island arc. (Not all island arcs are volcanic island arcs.) * continental arcs form when oceanic crust subducts beneath continental crust on an adjacent plate, creating an arc-shaped mountain belt. In some situations, a single subduction zone may show both aspects along its length, as part of a plate subducts beneath a continent and part beneath adjacent oceanic crust. Volcanoes are present in almost any mountain belt, but this does not make it a volcanic arc. Often there are isolated, but impressively huge volcanoes in a mountain belt. For instance, Vesuvius and the Etna volcanoes in Italy are part of separate but different kinds of mountainous volcanic ensembles. The active front of a volcanic arc is the belt where volcanism develops at a given time. Active fronts may move over time (millions of years), changing their distance from the oceanic trench as well as their width. Petrology In a subduction zone, loss of water from the subducted slab induces partial melting of the overriding mantle and generates low-density, calc-alkaline magma that buoyantly rises to intrude and be extruded through the lithosphere of the overriding plate. This loss of water is due to the destabilization of the mineral chlorite at approximately 40‚Äì60 km depth.Grove, T. L., N. Chatterjee, S. W. Parman, and E. M√©dard (2006), The Influence of H2O on Mantle Wedge Melting, Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 249, 74‚Äì89.Grove, T.L., C. B. Till, N. Chatterjee, and E. M√©dard (submitted 2008), Transport of H2O in subduction zones and its role in the formation and location of arc volcanoes, Nature. This is the reason for island arc volcanism at consistent distances from the subducting slab: because the temperature-pressure conditions for flux-melting volcanism due to chlorite destabilization will always occur at the same depth, the distance from the trench to the arc volcanoes is determined only by the dip angle of the subducting slab. On the subducting side of the arc is a deep and narrow oceanic trench, which is the trace at the Earth's surface of the boundary between the down-going and overriding plates. This trench is created by the gravitational pull of the relatively dense subducting plate pulling the leading edge of the plate downward. Multiple earthquakes occur along this subduction boundary with the seismic hypocenters located at increasing depth under the island arc: these quakes define the Wadati‚ÄìBenioff zones. The volcanic arc forms when the subducting plate reaches a depth of about . Ocean basins that are being reduced by subduction are called 'remnant oceans' as they will slowly be shrunken out of existence and crushed in the subsequent orogenic collision. This process has happened over and over in the geologic history of the Earth. In the rock record, volcanic arcs can be seen as the volcanic rocks themselves, but because volcanic rock is easily weathered and eroded, it is more typical that they are seen as plutonic rocks, the rocks that formed underneath the arc (e.g. the Sierra Nevada batholith), or in the sedimentary record as lithic sandstones. Examples Two classic examples of oceanic island arcs are the Mariana Islands in the western Pacific Ocean and the Lesser Antilles in the western Atlantic Ocean. The Cascade Volcanic Arc in western North America and the Andes along the western edge of South America are examples of continental volcanic arcs. The best examples of volcanic arcs with both sets of characteristics are in the North Pacific, with the Aleutian Arc consisting of the Aleutian Islands and their extension the Aleutian Range on the Alaska Peninsula, and the Kuril-Kamchatka Arc comprising the Kuril Islands and southern Kamchatka Peninsula.

Opened in 1910 with a single wooden stand, it underwent numerous renovations during its lifespan and hosted fixtures with over 60,000 spectators in attendance. At the time of its closure in 2009, it had a capacity of 21,508. Cardiff City had originally been playing home fixtures at Sophia Gardens but the lack of facilities at the ground had prevented them from joining the Southern Football League. To combat this, club founder Bartley Wilson secured a plot of land from Cardiff Corporation that had previously been used as a rubbish tip and construction of a new ground began in 1909. The stadium was completed a year later and named Ninian Park after Lieutenant-Colonel Lord Ninian Crichton-Stuart, who had acted as a financial guarantor for the build. A friendly match against Football League First Division champions Aston Villa was organised to open the ground. It was originally constructed with a single wooden stand and three large banks made of ash, but gradual improvements saw stands constructed on all sides of the pitch. The four stands were named the Canton Stand, the Grange End, the Popular Bank and the Grandstand. The ground was also used as the home stadium for the Wales national football team from 1911 until the late 1980s, hosting 84 international fixtures during its existence. Safety concerns led to the ground's capacity being drastically reduced and Cardiff Arms Park replacing the stadium as the preferred home venue for the national side. The Welsh national side holds the record attendance for a match at Ninian Park; 62,634 fans watched a fixture against England on 17 October 1959. Cardiff City's club record attendance of 57,893 came at the stadium during a Football League fixture against Arsenal on 22 April 1953. The ground hosted its last match on 25 April 2009 against Ipswich Town and was demolished soon after, being replaced by the adjacent newly constructed Cardiff City Stadium. The site was converted into a residential housing estate that was named Ninian Park after the ground. History Construction and early years Lord Ninian after whom Ninian Park is named, in Cathays Park, Cardiff|alt=A statue of a figure in military attire Following the founding of the club in 1899, Cardiff City F.C. (originally named Riverside A.F.C.) played their home matches at Sophia Gardens. The club was becoming increasingly popular with local people, but the facilities at Sophia Gardens were deemed inadequate for this growing support due to the lack of turnstiles or an enclosed pitch. The limitations meant the club was forced to turn down an invitation to join the newly formed Southern Football League Second Division in 1908. To capitalise on growing interest, Cardiff organised friendly matches against Crystal Palace, Bristol City and Middlesbrough that were held at Cardiff Arms Park and the Harlequins Ground, part of Cardiff High School. The attendances convinced club founder Bartley Wilson of the potential success of a professional football club in Cardiff, and he approached the Bute Estate, a large landholder within the city, about securing a plot of land to build a new ground at Leckwith Common. The club was instead offered an area of waste ground by Councillor John Mander which was known as Tanyard Lane with the incentive that Cardiff Corporation would assist in the construction of the ground. Located between Sloper Road and a local railway station, the area had been used previously as a rubbish tip and an allotment ground. The club chose an area of around five acres near a junction on Leckwith Road. They were offered the ground on an initial seven-year lease with a yearly rent of ¬£90. This was to be supported by guarantors should the club have financial difficulties and be unable to maintain payments. Local volunteers and workers were used to clear the site of debris and level the surface. The ground was surrounded by large mounds of ash and slag sourced from the furnaces of local companies and used to form banking for spectators. A white fence was erected around the outside of the ground. A small 200-seat wooden stand and changing rooms were added to complete the build. To secure the site, the club was required to provide two or more guarantors to back the deal. One of the guarantors who had initially agreed to support the project later pulled out during development. This led the club's solicitor, Norman Robertson, to address a local council meeting, stating that \\"there had been difficulties in obtaining promises of support\\" due to the uncertain state of the coal industry. Lieutenant-Colonel Lord Ninian Crichton-Stuart, son of John Patrick Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute, stepped in to offer his financial support. In appreciation of his contribution, the ground was subsequently named Ninian Park, replacing the original planned name Sloper Park. The other four guarantors for the site were David Alfred Thomas, 1st Viscount Rhondda, J. Bell Harrison and local councillors Charles Wall and H.C. Vivian. A further 24 people offered to become sureties if their contribution would be limited to ¬£5. Harry Bradshaw, secretary of the Southern Football League, inspected the ground ahead of the 1910‚Äì11 season. He declared that Ninian Park had \\"the making of the finest football ground in the country\\" and allowed Cardiff City to join the Southern League's Second Division. Cardiff held two trial matches at the ground, the club's professional players competing against its amateur players in preparation for the opening match. The new ground was officially opened at 5:00 pm on 1 September 1910 with a friendly against Aston Villa, reigning champions of the Football League First Division, that attracted a crowd of around 7,000 people. The match began with a ceremonial kick-off performed by Lord Ninian and ended in a 2‚Äì1 defeat for Cardiff. Jack Evans became the first player to score for the club at the ground. The first competitive match played at Ninian Park was the opening match of the 1910‚Äì11 season, which took place three weeks later on 24 September 1910. The match ended in a 4‚Äì1 victory for Cardiff over Ton Pentre and attracted a crowd of around 8,000. In November, a larger timber stand that could hold up to 3,000 spectators was built at the Canton end of the ground. Several players who worked as labourers in their spare time helped to complete construction. The stand was extended three years later to cover the length of the pitch. Less than a year after it opened, Ninian Park was chosen as the new home ground for the Wales national football team, replacing Cardiff Arms Park. It hosted its first international fixture on 6 March 1911, a 2‚Äì2 draw against Scotland in front of 17,000 spectators in the 1910‚Äì11 British Home Championship. The Times described the ground as \\"primitive\\" and reported that it had contributed to the poor standard of play. During its formative years, the pitch sometimes bore signs of its former use as a rubbish tip with debris such as glass often rising to the surface. The club paid players 6d an hour to arrive early before matches and help clear the pitch of objects. This approach was not always successful; Scottish international Peter McWilliam suffered a gash to his leg in the first international fixture that ended his playing career, and Wales' Billy Meredith also suffered a cut knee during the match. Cardiff's Jack Evans was scarred for life in a similar incident in a later match when a piece of glass cut his knee. In the early years at the stadium, the ground contained only one changing room and washing area, meaning home and away teams shared facilities. This continued until a separate dressing room was constructed in 1913. A local primary school, originally named Virgil Street Board School, adopted the name of the ground in 1911, becoming Ninian Park Primary School. Football League and development Ninian Park featured on an alt=An Ordnance Survey map Cardiff won promotion from the Second Division of the Southern Football League to the First Division in 1912‚Äì13. Following the resumption of league football after the First World War, the team's fourth- placed finish in the 1919‚Äì20 season raised enough income to eliminate the club's debts. This also allowed for the construction of an all-seater stand at Ninian Park behind the north goal which was named the Canton Stand. In 1920, Cardiff was elected to the Second Division of The Football League, helping attendances increase significantly. Matches against well known clubs in the top two divisions of the English football league system attracted considerable interest, with attendances averaging over 28,000 in the Second Division. Further improvements were implemented after this first season in The Football League; a roof was erected over the new Canton Stand, the spectator banks were raised and the pitch was relaid with sea-washed turf, a fine variety of grass grown on the coast that is cleansed by tidal flow. The club stated that the new playing surface was \\"now equal to the best in the country.\\" Attendances rose again as Cardiff won promotion to the First Division after one season. The opening match of the 1921‚Äì22 season attracted a crowd of over 55,000 for a 1‚Äì0 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur. The turnstiles were closed once 50,000 spectators had been let into the ground, but the remaining crowds outside, still queuing for entry, forced open the exit gates and entered the ground. Club estimates put the attendance at between 56,000 and 60,000, with spectators even climbing the scoreboard to gain a vantage point. In 1923, plans were initiated to build new dressing rooms and offices at the ground but the project proved too costly. This was partly due to the expense of replacing the sea-washed turf, which had proved troublesome and had been described as \\"treacherous\\" in the two years since it had been installed. The pitch at the ground would prove problematic for several seasons and the club eventually enlisted the help of seed specialists Suttons to improve the quality of the surface. Victory in the 1927 FA Cup Final raised enough funds for a roof to be erected over the terrace at the Grangetown end of the ground. Built by local company Connies & Meaden Limited, it was officially opened on 1 September 1928 before a league match against Burnley by the Lord Mayor of Cardiff, Arthur John Howell. It could hold 18,000 spectators. The investment in the stadium proved detrimental to the team as manager Fred Stewart was left with little money to reinvest in an ageing squad. Replacements were sourced from amateur clubs, but the side was relegated to the Football League Third Division South by 1932. With the club's finances dwindling, the board was keen to add new revenue streams. Boxing matches were soon held at Ninian Park with the first professional event in August 1931 featuring former British light-heavyweight champion Frank Moody. The 1932 Cardiff Sports Carnival was also based at the ground, which included the final of the 12-mile road race finishing with three laps around the stands. The idea of installing a greyhound track at the stadium was also proposed the same year but was met with opposition from council and footballing authorities before being abandoned. On 18 January 1937, the main stand caught fire after thieves attempted to break into the club's safe using explosives. They mistakenly believed that money taken from gate receipts in an FA Cup tie against Grimsby Town was stored inside. The match had attracted a season-high attendance of more than 36,000 spectators leading to higher than usual income. The fire was discovered at 3:45 am by a local policeman. He alerted the fire brigade but they were unable to douse the fire before it destroyed the stand, the dressing rooms and offices. It also claimed the lives of the club's watchdog Jack as well as one of the club's cats and destroyed the majority of its historical records. The stand was largely destroyed in the blaze but was rebuilt using a brick and stone construction before the outbreak of World War II. Prior to the return of The Football League after the war, Ninian Park hosted its first European opposition when Dynamo Moscow played Cardiff as part of a tour of the United Kingdom in 1945. Cardiff, chosen for being deemed the leading club in Wales, suffered a heavy 10‚Äì1 defeat to the visiting side but did earn a substantial profit from ticket sales. alt=A football stand containing blue seats Over the following few decades, several areas of the ground underwent significant renovations. The main stand was extended in 1947 at a cost of ¬£9,000, with a new concrete terrace being added in front of the original seating area. Floodlights were added to the ground for the first time in 1960. Ninian Park was one of the last Football League grounds to have them installed. During this period the club's popularity had increased as they challenged for a return to the First Division. On 27 August 1949, Cardiff sold 60,855 tickets for a South Wales derby match against Swansea Town but only 57,510 entered the ground on the day. Their record attendance for a match was set four years later, on 22 April 1953, when a crowd of 57,893 watched a First Division match against Arsenal. In February 1958, the ground was host to the second leg of the 1958 FIFA World Cup play-off qualifying match between Wales and Israel. Already leading 2‚Äì0 from the first leg, Wales secured a second victory by the same scoreline to reach the World Cup finals for the only time in the team's history. Later that year, Connies & Meaden were employed again to construct a large roof over the rear section of the Popular Bank and to extend the stand the length of the pitch. In the early 1960s, qualification for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup by virtue of winning the Welsh Cup was introduced and Cardiff entered European competition for the first time in the 1964‚Äì65 season. The side were drawn against Danish semi-professional team Esbjerg fB and the first European tie held at Ninian Park took place on 13 October for the second leg of the fixture. After a goalless draw in the first leg, Peter King scored the only goal of the tie to secure a 1‚Äì0 aggregate victory for Cardiff in front of a crowd of around 9,000. The low crowd was blamed on the relatively unknown status of the opposition; the club's match against Portuguese side Sporting CP, reigning champions of the competition, in the following round attracted over 23,000 spectators, the biggest home crowd the club had played in front of for nearly two years. This was bettered again in the following round when 38,458 supporters attended a 1‚Äì0 defeat against Spanish side Real Zaragoza. As the club's fortunes declined during the 1960s crowd numbers fell, but during the 1972‚Äì73 season Cardiff spent ¬£225,000 extending the main stand capacity by a further 4,500 seats under the stewardship of new chairman David Goldstone. In 1975, the Safety of Sports Grounds Act was introduced, and two years later local authorities introduced sanctions on Ninian Park that saw the capacity reduced from 46,000 to just 10,000 over safety concerns. The club was forced to pay ¬£600,000 towards improving the ground's safety features to ensure that Ninian Park could be maintained and awarded the necessary safety certificate. A sum of ¬£200,000 was provided by the Football Grounds Improvement Trust and ¬£27,000 by the Football Association of Wales (FAW). The Safety Act also required that the Grange End Stand be overhauled. This included the demolition of the roof, and the removal of banking that severely reduced the overall capacity of the ground. Director Tony Clemo later complained that the restrictions were unduly harsh, stating \\"There was no common sense [...] the Grangetown Stand had to be demolished in 1978 when the council's safety officers said that if there was two feet of snow and an 80 mile an hour wind blowing, it would be unsafe. We maintained that if there were two feet of snow and an 80 mile and hour wind, we wouldn't be playing football anyway! They insisted and down it came! It was a total waste of time and money.\\" The club did benefit from a relationship with engineering firm Kenton Utilities who undertook most of the work at a reduced rate due to the firm being owned by another Cardiff director, Bob Grogan. During a qualifying match between Wales and Scotland for the 1986 FIFA World Cup on 10 September 1985, Scotland manager Jock Stein collapsed at the ground after suffering a heart-attack during the final minutes of the match. He was taken to the ground's medical room where he received treatment, but doctors were unable to revive him. In memory of Stein, a plaque was installed in one of the dugouts at the ground. Downscaling, closure and demolition In the late 1980s, increasing concerns over safety issues saw Ninian Park replaced as the main home venue of the Wales national side by Cardiff Arms Park. A few matches were played there until it hosted its final international fixture, a UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying match on 14 October 1998 against Belarus. In January 1990, the club was dealt a blow when thieves broke into the stadium following an FA Cup tie against Queens Park Rangers. They stole ¬£50,000 of gate receipts by gaining access to offices via the pitch. The money was eventually recovered. Some was found in the house of one of the perpetrators; the majority was found buried on Caerphilly Mountain. Later the same year, the FAW chose to move a UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying match between Wales and Belgium to Cardiff Arms Park over fears that proposed safety improvements at Ninian Park would not be completed in time. FAW secretary Alun Evans alluded to the fact that matches between Belgium and the Home Nations were still deemed to be \\"sensitive\\" following the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985. Cardiff threatened legal action over the decision, stating that the club could \\"meet any deadline\\" to complete the work, but were unsuccessful. The game went ahead at Cardiff Arms Park. With Cardiff struggling financially and owing several payments to their landlords the City of Cardiff Council, the club was forced to close three stands in the ground to save on policing costs during matches. The closure remained in place for a year until Rick Wright acquired control of the club and invested heavily in updating the ground. Improvements included installing 2,100 seats and extending the roof in the Grandstand, replacing terracing in the Popular Bank with 5,330 seats and refurbishing the Grange End and the Canton Stand, which added a further 1,761 seats. Wright decided to sell his stake in the club in 1993 and a feasibility study of Ninian Park carried out by Tarmac Group on behalf of a prospective buyer estimated that the redevelopment of the ground would cost an estimated ¬£4.6 million. The increasingly dilapidated nature of the ground gained national attention following Cardiff's victory over Leeds United in the FA Cup in January 2002 due to crowd trouble after the match. Jeff Cooksley, Chief Superintendent of South Wales Police, commented that, although no objection was made to using the ground, Ninian Park was a \\"very old ground, [...] and is very poorly designed compared with modern standards.\\" alt=A football stand containing blue seats Plans for a new stadium to replace Ninian Park were in development for several years before Cardiff City officially submitted an application to local councils. Welsh Rugby Union chief executive David Moffett originally objected to the proposals as he wished for the club to use the Millennium Stadium as their home ground instead to maximise the occupancy levels of the stadium. The plans for a 30,000-seat stadium, with the potential to expand to 60,000, were eventually approved by Cardiff council, and plans were submitted in 2006. Work started on the new Cardiff City Stadium at the end of 2007 on the site of the Cardiff Athletics Stadium at an expected cost of ¬£38 million. The last ever football match played by Cardiff at Ninian Park was a 3‚Äì0 defeat by Ipswich Town on 25 April 2009. The final senior player to score at the ground was Jon Stead, then of Ipswich Town; the last player for Cardiff to score at the ground was Ross McCormack in a 3‚Äì1 victory over Burnley in the penultimate senior game at Ninian Park. After the final match, an online memorabilia auction was setup, with items such as goalposts, office furniture and supporters' seats being listed for sale. alt=A gate entering a housing estate The stadium was handed over to Redrow Homes by Cardiff chairman Peter Ridsdale on 10 September 2009. The 99-year-old Ninian Park was demolished later in 2009 to make way for a housing development. Redrow built 142 houses on the site that retained the name Ninian Park. A planted square was proposed at the centre of the new housing development, in the area of Ninian Park's centre spot. The first show home of the ¬£24 million development was opened in late spring 2010, with a mixture of terraced, detached and semi-detached houses. The first families moved into the new housing in November 2010. The main road was named Bartley Wilson Way after the founder of Cardiff City. Structure and facilities At the time of its closure in 2009, Ninian Park had a capacity of 21,508 and comprised four stands; the Grandstand, the Grange End, the Popular Bank and the Canton Stand. The Popular Bank in 1983 with the advert for alt=A black and white led photograph of a football stand The Grandstand was an all-seated stand that was built before the Second World War to replace the original wooden structure that had been destroyed in a fire. The stand had originally contained a standing section at the bottom, but this was later converted to seats. Press areas reserved for journalists had been located in the stand since 1960. Directly opposite was the Popular Bank, which was commonly referred to as the \\"Bob Bank\\" as it previously cost one shilling (known as one bob) to enter. It was originally an all-standing construction with no roof on its completion in 1910. A roof was constructed in 1958, and the top half of the stand was converted to seating in the early 1990s. The Popular Bank became well known for the advertising featured on the roof of the stand. In 1960, an advert for Captain Morgan rum, named after Sir Henry Morgan who hailed from Cardiff, was painted on the roof and remained in place for 42 years. The advert was the longest running stadium roof advert in the history of The Football League. It was replaced in 2001 by an advert for Hyper Value. The Grange End and Canton Stand were both named after local districts in the city, Grangetown and Canton. The Grange End also housed visiting away fans and due to crowd trouble, had featured a fence to separate opposing fans and netting to stop objects being thrown. It was removed in 2006, becoming the last venue in the Football League to remove fencing between opposing fans. The Canton Stand also housed executive boxes, hospitality areas and several club offices. These areas had originally been commissioned in the 1980s but financial difficulties at the club delayed the completion of the project until 2001. The ground featured floodlights in each corner and a plasma-screen television showed highlights during the game. The television was bought by the club in 2002 from Bolton Wanderers. They had used the screen in their former ground Burnden Park before moving to the Reebok Stadium. It was located between the Popular Bank and the Grange End. Transport Ninian Park railway station The stadium and surrounding area was served by Ninian Park railway station (on the Cardiff City Line) on one side of Sloper Road and Grangetown railway station (on the Vale Line) on the other side. Ninian Park Station (originally named Ninian Park Halt) was built in 1912 by the Taff Vale Railway at the junction of Sloper Road and Leckwith Road. Railway officials had been encouraged by increasing crowd numbers at the club's matches and looked to capitalise on the interest. When the railway was privatised, the stations became part of the Valley Lines. Trains operated frequently to Central and Queen Street stations. By road, the stadium was also served by the A4232 dual carriageway, which is approximately away from the Leckwith Interchange. Other usage Sporting events Rugby Cardiff Rugby Club played at Ninian Park twice between 1960 and 1961 as their ground did not have floodlights. The Cardiff City Blue Dragons rugby league team used the ground as their home between 1981 and 1984. The team had been founded by Cardiff City director Bob Grogan as a way of generating income and ensuring that Ninian Park was being used more frequently. Initially the project proved a moderate success. Having been set up at a cost of less than ¬£50,000, the side was credited with keeping the football club afloat by former Cardiff director Tony Clemo, who commented \\"We weren't getting many through the gates but rugby league helped to keep Cardiff City going [...] The Blue Dragons income was paying the rents and rates and there was always a small profit at the end of the day.\\" The team's first match against Salford on 31 August 1981 attracted more than 9,000 spectators. However, the Blue Dragons failed to reach the top tier of Rugby league and crowds dropped to below 1,000 by the end of the first season. Grogan's death soon after led to the club folding after a year playing in Bridgend. The Welsh national rugby league team, the Wales Dragons, used Ninian Park as one of its home venues. The ground hosted seven internationals between 1981 and 1995 with the first match a 15‚Äì20 defeat to England in November 1981. Ahead of the game, rugby officials had hoped to draw a crowd of more than 10,000 but the final figure was around 8,000. The Dragons held a 3‚Äì3 record at Ninian Park, winning their last game 28‚Äì6 over France before the largest international rugby league crowd at the ground (a sellout 10,250) on their way to a semi-final berth in the 1995 Rugby League World Cup. The 1999 final of the WRU Challenge Cup was also held at the ground, featuring Swansea RFC defeating Llanelli RFC 37‚Äì10. Other Cardiff-born boxer Jack Petersen fought at the ground on several occasions, including victories over Hein M√ºller and George Cook that attracted crowds of more than 40,000. The ground also hosted several boxing World title fights; Ronnie James contested the first World title fight ever held in Wales when he fought American Ike Williams for the NBA Lightweight Title in September 1946. The bout lasted until the ninth round when reigning champion Williams knocked James out in front of a crowd of 45,000 people. Howard Winstone's rematch against reigning WBC and WBA featherweight champion Vicente Saldivar was also held at Ninian Park; Salvidar claimed a narrow victory over Winstone by half a point. During the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games held in Cardiff, Ninian Park hosted the show jumping championships, although the sport was only an exhibition event at the games. A trial event to inform 1960 Summer Olympics equestrian team selection was also hosted at the ground in May 1960. Other sporting uses included hosting an exhibition basketball game between the Harlem Globetrotters and the United States Star Basketeers Team in June 1958 and an American football match featuring the Cardiff Tigers team in 1986. Concerts The ground has been used for numerous other events. Pope John Paul II visited the city on 2 June 1982, touring several locations, appearing at a National Youth Rally held at Ninian Park attended by 35,000 people. As part of his Rastaman Vibration Tour, reggae singer Bob Marley staged a concert at the ground on 19 June 1976 for the West Coast Rock Show. He was supported by Country Joe and the Fish and Eric Burdon among others. The concert had originally been scheduled for Stephen Stills. When he was unable to play, Marley filled the date. Records The highest attendance recorded at the ground is 62,634, for a match between Wales and England on 17 October 1959 in the 1959‚Äì60 British Home Championship. Cardiff City's record attendance at the ground was 57,893 during a league fixture against Arsenal on 22 April 1953. Although a match against Swansea Town in August 1949 sold 60,855 tickets only an attendance of 57,510 was recorded through the turnstiles on the day. The ground holds the record for the highest attendance for a Welsh Cup match after 37,500 fans watched Cardiff defeat Swansea Town 3‚Äì2 in the 1956 final. It also holds the record for the highest non-final Welsh Cup attendance with 22,500 fans attending a semifinal between Cardiff and Merthyr Tydfil in 1949. The highest season average attendance record was set during the 1952‚Äì53 season with 37,937. The lowest season average was recorded in the 1986‚Äì87 season with 2,856. That season also included the club's lowest ever home attendance for a fixture in the Football League when 1,510 fans attended a match against Hartlepool United on 7 May.

The story concerns two strangers who become dangerously close after witnessing a deadly accident. It stars Daniel Craig, Rhys Ifans and Samantha Morton with Bill Nighy, Susan Lynch and Corin Redgrave. Plot Joe has planned an afternoon in the English countryside with his partner, Claire. As they prepare to open a bottle of champagne, a hot air balloon drifts into the field. The pilot catches his leg in the anchor rope, while the only passenger, a boy, is too scared to jump down. Joe and three other men rush to secure the basket. Just as they grab on, wind rushes into the field, and at once the rescuers are airborne. Joe manages to drop to the ground, as do the others, except for one who is lifted into the sky. They watch as the man falls to his death. Recalling the events at dinner with his friends Robin, Rachel, and Claire, Joe reveals the impact the incident has had on his battered psyche. The balloon eventually landed safely, the boy unscathed. Joe later goes to retrieve the body of the fallen man with fellow rescuer Jed Parry. Jed feels an instant connection with Joe‚Äîone that, as the weeks go by, becomes ever more intense. Days later, Joe, feeling guilty, spends time trying to map out ways that could have saved the man. One day, he receives a phone call from Jed, telling him to come outside so that they can talk about what happened. Joe looks out the window and sees Jed standing across the road from his house staring up at Joe's window. Joe is reluctant but Jed promises that he will leave Joe alone if he comes outside and talks to him. After Jed makes some comments that make Joe uneasy, he decides to leave, telling Jed to leave him alone. Not too long after this, Joe visits a local bookshop and Jed makes an appearance, appearing to have followed Joe. Joe is confused and angered by this and tells Jed that he does not want to see him at all. Jed is hurt by this and continues to tell Joe to \\"be brave\\" and admit what passed between them at the field. Joe is lecturing at the college where he works. At lunch, he sits down with a colleague and then spots Jed sitting at the table next to him. He shouts at Jed, causing a scene when Jed tells him to \\"be brave\\" again. Joe tells Jed that all he wants is for Jed to leave him alone. After hearing this, Jed leaves the restaurant. Joe then visits the wife of the man who had died and she tells him that she believes that he was having an affair after the police returned a picnic basket for two that was found in his car, along with an unknown woman's scarf. After hearing this, he decides to figure out who was with the man on the day he died. On Joe's birthday, Claire makes him a special birthday dinner. At dinner, it is clear to see the strain on their relationship. After Claire sees that Joe is lost in thought and not paying her any attention, she angrily clears the table. She is fed up with Joe's behaviour and lack of communication. The next day, Joe goes swimming and sees Jed standing by the window of the pool. Joe asks Jed to meet him in the caf√©. They talk and Joe demands to know why Jed won't leave him alone. Jed, once again, makes Joe uneasy and he leaves. Later, Joe and Claire are joined by Robin and Rachel, Claire's brother and his new girlfriend. Joe then tells Claire that he had planned to propose to her on the day of the accident. She asks Joe if he's changed his mind and he remains silent. This drives another wedge between them and the evening is ruined. The next day at Joe's lecture, Jed appears in the classroom and sings to Joe. They then go outside and Jed talks about how Joe is sending him signals, using a curtain reference. Joe is confused, tells Jed to leave and then later that night researches the significance between stalkers and \\"curtain signals\\". He finally concludes that Jed standing beneath his window every night watches him draw the curtains, thinking that the way they are drawn is a secret message (such as \\"come and see me\\", \\"I love you\\", or \\"talk to me\\"). After explaining this to Claire, he looks out of the window and sees Jed sitting in the park across from his house watching him. Joe asks Claire to come to the window and look at Jed but she, frustrated, goes back to sleep. The next morning, Claire comes down the stairs and tells Joe that it is over between them. Joe, angry, pays a visit to Jed and they argue. Joe then gets drunk before going to Robin and Rachel's house where he stays the night. When he wakes up, his friend tells him that Claire just called and that Claire had told him to come over as Jed was in their house. Joe races to his house and enters the living room to find Jed and Claire sitting next to each other on the sofa. Jed looks as if he has been beaten up and falsely blames Joe. Claire appears to believe Jed's story. Joe loses his temper and then out of the blue, Jed stabs Claire with a kitchen knife and she falls to the floor, bleeding profusely. Joe then pretends to accept Jed into his life and they kiss. As they kiss, Joe grabs hold of the knife from Jed and stabs him. Jed falls to the floor, while Joe rushes to Claire's aid and phones an ambulance. Joe is back on the field where it all started, with the wife and daughter of the man who died. They are joined by a couple who explain that the woman's husband had not cheated on her but was giving the couple a lift in his car. The picnic basket and scarf were theirs, and they were too embarrassed to intercede, as they were having an affair. The wife is happy to discover the truth and sad that she had believed her husband was cheating. Joe then tells the man's daughter her father was very brave. After this, Joe is joined by Claire, who survived the stabbing; they are still separated. As they sit on the grass and talk, Joe tries to find apologize for what happened to them. Claire says, \\"Don't say anything\\". During the ending credits, Jed, who also survived, is shown in a mental institution and appears to be obsessively writing a letter. He smiles.

It also has sedative (calming) properties, as well as amnestic (inducing forgetfulness), anticonvulsant, and skeletal muscle relaxant effects. It was patented in 1961 and came into medical use in 1965. Medical use Alodorm bottle containing 25 tablets of 5mg Nitrazepam. Nitrazepam is used to treat short-term sleeping problems (insomnia), namely difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakening, early awakening, or a combination of each. Nitrazepam is sometimes tried to treat epilepsy when other medications fail. It has been found to be more effective than clonazepam in the treatment of West syndrome, which is an age-dependent epilepsy, affecting the very young. In uncontrolled studies, nitrazepam has shown effectiveness in infantile spasms and is sometimes considered when other anti- seizure drugs have failed. However, drowsiness, hypotonia, and most significantly tolerance to anti-seizure effects typically develop with long- term treatment, generally limiting Nitrazepam to acute seizure management. Side effects More common More common side effects may include: Central nervous system depression, including somnolence, dizziness, depressed mood, fatigue, ataxia, headache, vertigo, impairment of memory, impairment of motor functions, hangover feeling in the morning, slurred speech, decreased physical performance, numbed emotions, reduced alertness, muscle weakness, double vision, and inattention have been reported. Unpleasant dreams and rebound insomnia have also been reported. Nitrazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine with an elimination half-life of 15‚Äì38 hours (mean elimination half-life 26 hours). Residual \\"hangover\\" effects after nighttime administration of nitrazepam such as sleepiness, impaired psychomotor and cognitive functions may persist into the next day, which may impair the ability of users to drive safely and increases the risk of falls and hip fractures. Less common Less common side effects may include: Hypotension, faintness, palpitation, rash or pruritus, gastrointestinal disturbances, and changes in libido are less common. Very infrequently, paradoxical reactions may occur, for example, excitement, stimulation, hallucinations, hyperactivity, and insomnia. Also, depressed or increased dreaming, disorientation, severe sedation, retrograde amnesia, headache, hypothermia, and delirium tremens are reported. Severe liver toxicity has also been reported. Cancer Benzodiazepine use is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer. Mortality Nitrazepam therapy, compared with other drug therapies, increases risk of death when used for intractable epilepsy in an analysis of 302 patients. The risk of death from nitrazepam therapy may be greater in younger patients (children below 3.4 years in the study) with intractable epilepsy. In older children (above 3.4 years), the tendency appears to be reversed in this study. Nitrazepam may cause sudden death in children. It can cause swallowing incoordination, high-peaked esophageal peristalsis, bronchospasm, delayed cricopharyngeal relaxation, and severe respiratory distress necessitating ventilatory support in children. Nitrazepam may promote the development of parasympathetic overactivity or vagotonia, leading to potentially fatal respiratory distress in children. Liver Nitrazepam has been associated with severe hepatic disorders, similar to other nitrobenzodiazepines. Nitrobenzodiazepines such as nitrazepam, nimetazepam, flunitrazepam, and clonazepam are more toxic to the liver than other benzodiazepines as they are metabolically activated by CYP3A4 which can result in cytotoxicity. This activation can lead to the generation of free radicals and oxidation of thiol, as well as covalent binding with endogenous macromolecules; this results, then, in oxidation of cellular components or inhibition of normal cellular function. Metabolism of a nontoxic drug to reactive metabolites has been causally connected with a variety of adverse reactions. Long-term effects Long-term use of nitrazepam carries mental and physical health risks, such as the development of cognitive deficits. These adverse effects show improvement after a period of abstinence. Abuse potential Recreational use of nitrazepam is common. A monograph for the drug says: \\"Treatment with nitrazepam should usually not exceed seven to ten consecutive days. Use for more than two to three consecutive weeks requires complete re-evaluation of the patient. Prescriptions for nitrazepam should be written for short-term use (seven to ten days) and it should not be prescribed in quantities exceeding a one-month supply. Dependence can occur in as little as four weeks.\\" Tolerance Tolerance to nitrazepam's effects occurs with regular use. Increased levels of GABA in cerebral tissue and alterations in the activity state of the serotoninergic system occur as a result of nitrazepam tolerance. Tolerance to the sleep-inducing effects of nitrazepam occurs after about seven days; tolerance also frequently occurs to its anticonvulsant effects. Dependence and withdrawal Nitrazepam can cause dependence, addiction, and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal from nitrazepam may lead to withdrawal symptoms which are similar to those seen with alcohol and barbiturates. Common withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, insomnia, concentration problems, and fatigue. Discontinuation of nitrazepam produced rebound insomnia after short-term single nightly dose therapy. Special precautions Benzodiazepines require special precautions if used in alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Caution should be exercised in prescribing nitrazepam to anyone who is of working age due to the significant impairment of psychomotor skills; this impairment is greater when the higher dosages are prescribed. Nitrazepam in doses of 5 mg or more causes significant deterioration in vigilance performance combined with increased feelings of sleepiness. Nitrazepam at doses of 5 mg or higher impairs driving skills and like other hypnotic drugs, it is associated with an increased risk of traffic accidents. In the elderly, nitrazepam is associated with an increased risk of falls and hip fractures due to impairments of body balance. The elimination half-life of nitrazepam is 40 hours in the elderly and 29 hours in younger adults. Nitrazepam is commonly taken in overdose by drug abusers or suicidal individuals, sometimes leading to death. Nitrazepam is teratogenic if taken in overdose during pregnancy with 30% of births showing congenital abnormalities. It is a popular drug of abuse in countries where it is available. Doses as low as 5 mg can impair driving skills. Therefore, people driving or conducting activities which require vigilance should exercise caution in using nitrazepam or possibly avoid it altogether. Elderly Nitrazepam, similar to other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines, causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. Combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments. Nitrazepam has been found to be dangerous in elderly patients due to a significantly increased risk of falls. This increased risk is probably due to the drug effects of nitrazepam persisting well into the next day. Nitrazepam is a particularly unsuitable hypnotic for the elderly as it induces a disability characterised by general mental deterioration, inability to walk, incontinence, dysarthric, confusion, stumbling, falls, and disoriention which can occur from doses as low as 5 mg. The nitrazepam-induced symptomatology can lead to a misdiagnosis of brain disease in the elderly, for example dementia, and can also lead to the symptoms of postural hypotension which may also be misdiagnosed. A geriatric unit reportedly was seeing as many as seven patients a month with nitrazepam-induced disabilities and health problems. The drug was recommended to join the barbiturates in not being prescribed to the elderly. Only nitrazepam and lorazepam were found to increase the risk of falls and fractures in the elderly. CNS depression occurs much more frequently in the elderly and is especially common in doses above 5 mg of nitrazepam. Both young and old patients report sleeping better after three nights' use of nitrazepam, but they also reported feeling less awake and were slower on psychomotor testing up to 36 hours after intake of nitrazepam. The elderly showed cognitive deficits, making significantly more mistakes in psychomotor testing than younger patients despite similar plasma levels of the drug, suggesting the elderly are more sensitive to nitrazepam due to increased sensitivity of the aging brain to it. Confusion and disorientation can result from chronic nitrazepam administration to elderly subjects. Also, the effects of a single dose of nitrazepam may last up to 60 hours after administration. Children Nitrazepam is not recommended for use in those under 18 years of age. Use in very young children may be especially dangerous. Children treated with nitrazepam for epilepsies may develop tolerance within months of continued use, with dose escalation often occurring with prolonged use. Sleepiness, deterioration in motor skills and ataxia were common side effects in children with tuberous sclerosis treated with nitrazepam. The side effects of nitrazepam may impair the development of motor and cognitive skills in children treated with nitrazepam. Withdrawal only occasionally resulted in a return of seizures and some children withdrawn from nitrazepam appeared to improve. Development, for example the ability to walk at five years of age, was impaired in many children taking nitrazepam, but was not impaired with several other nonbenzodiazepine antiepileptic agents. Children being treated with nitrazepam have been recommended to be reviewed and have their nitrazepam gradually discontinued whenever appropriate. Excess sedation, hypersalivation, swallowing difficulty, and high incidence of aspiration pneumonia, as well as several deaths, have been associated with nitrazepam therapy in children. Pregnancy Nitrazepam is not recommended during pregnancy as it is associated with causing a neonatal withdrawal syndrome and is not generally recommended in alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals or people with comorbid psychiatric disorders. The Dutch, British and French system called the System of Objectified Judgement Analysis for assessing whether drugs should be included in drug formularies based on clinical efficacy, adverse effects, pharmacokinetic properties, toxicity, and drug interactions was used to assess nitrazepam. A Dutch analysis using the system found nitrazepam to be unsuitable in drug-prescribing formularies. The use of nitrazepam during pregnancy can lead to intoxication of the newborn. A neonatal withdrawal syndrome can also occur if nitrazepam or other benzodiazepines are used during pregnancy with symptoms such as hyperexcitability, tremor, and gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea or vomiting) occurring. Breast feeding by mothers using nitrazepam is not recommended. Nitrazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine with a risk of drug accumulation, though no active metabolites are formed during metabolism. Accumulation can occur in various body organs, including the heart; accumulation is even greater in babies. Nitrazepam rapidly crosses the placenta and is present in breast milk in high quantities. Therefore, benzodiazepines including nitrazepam should be avoided during pregnancy. In early pregnancy, nitrazepam levels are lower in the baby than in the mother, and in the later stages of pregnancy, nitrazepam is found in equal levels in both the mother and the unborn child. Internationally benzodiazepines are known to cause harm when used during pregnancy and nitrazepam is a category D drug during pregnancy. Benzodiazepines are lipophilic and rapidly penetrate membranes, so rapidly penetrate the placenta with significant uptake of the drug. Use of benzodiazepines such as nitrazepam in late pregnancy in especially high doses may result in floppy infant syndrome. Use in the third trimester of pregnancy may result in the development of a severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome in the neonate. Withdrawal symptoms from benzodiazepines in the neonate may include hypotonia, and reluctance to suckle, to apnoeic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. These symptoms may persist for hours or months after birth. Other precautions Caution in hypotension Caution in those suffering from hypotension, nitrazepam may worsen hypotension. Caution in hypothyroidism Caution should be exercised by people who have hypothyroidism, as this condition may cause a long delay in the metabolism of nitrazepam leading to significant drug accumulation. Contraindications Nitrazepam should be avoided in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), especially during acute exacerbations of COPD, because serious respiratory depression may occur in patients receiving hypnotics. As with other hypnotic drugs, nitrazepam is associated with an increased risk of traffic accidents. Nitrazepam is recommended to be avoided in patients who drive or operate machinery. A study assessing driving skills of sedative hypnotic users found the users of nitrazepam to be significantly impaired up to 17 hours after dosing, whereas users of temazepam did not show significant impairments of driving ability. These results reflect the long-acting nature of nitrazepam. Interactions Nitrazepam interacts with the antibiotic erythromycin, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, which affects concentration peak time. Alone, this interaction is not believed to be clinically important. However, anxiety, tremor, and depression were documented in a case report involving a patient undergoing treatment for acute pneumonia and renal failure. Following administration of nitrazepam, triazolam, and subsequently erythromycin, the patient experienced repetitive hallucinations and abnormal bodily sensations. Coadministration of benzodiazepine drugs at therapeutic doses with erythromycin may cause serious psychotic symptoms, especially in persons with other, significant physical complications. Oral contraceptive pills reduce the clearance of nitrazepam, which may lead to increased plasma levels of nitrazepam and accumulation. Rifampin significantly increases the clearance of nitrazepam, while probenecid significantly decreases its clearance. Cimetidine slows down the elimination rate of nitrazepam, leading to more prolonged effects and increased risk of accumulation. Alcohol in combination with nitrazepam may cause a synergistic enhancement of the hypotensive properties of both benzodiazepines and alcohol. Benzodiazepines including nitrazepam may inhibit the glucuronidation of morphine, leading to increased levels and prolongation of the effects of morphine in rat experiments. Pharmacology Nitrazepam is a nitrobenzodiazepine. It is a 1,4 benzodiazepine, with the chemical name 1,3-Dihydro-7-nitro-5-phenyl-2H-1,4- benzodiazepin-2-one. It is long acting, lipophilic, and metabolised hepatically by oxidative pathways. It acts on benzodiazepine receptors in the brain which are associated with the GABA receptors, causing an enhanced binding of GABA to GABAA receptors. GABA is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, involved in inducing sleepiness, muscular relaxation, and control of anxiety and seizures, and slows down the central nervous system. Nitrazepam is similar in action to the z-drug zopiclone prescribed for insomnia. The anticonvulsant properties of nitrazepam and other benzodiazepines may be in part or entirely due to binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels rather than benzodiazepine receptors. Sustained repetitive firing seems to be limited by benzodiazepines effect of slowing recovery of sodium channels from inactivation in mouse spinal cord cell cultures. The muscle relaxant properties of nitrazepam are produced via inhibition of polysynaptic pathways in the spinal cord of decerebrate cats. It is a full agonist of the benzodiazepine receptor. The endogenous opioid system may play a role in some of the pharmacological properties of nitrazepam in rats. Nitrazepam causes a decrease in the cerebral contents of the amino acids glycine and alanine in the mouse brain. The decrease may be due to activation of benzodiazepine receptors. At high doses decreases in histamine turnover occur as a result of nitrazepam's action at the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor complex in mouse brain. Nitrazepam has demonstrated cortisol-suppressing properties in humans. It is an agonist for both central benzodiazepine receptors and to the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors found in rat neuroblastoma cells. EEG and sleep In sleep laboratory studies, nitrazepam decreased sleep onset latency. In psychogeriatric inpatients, it was found to be no more effective than placebo tablets in increasing total time spent asleep and to significantly impair trial subjects' abilities to move and carry out everyday activities the next day, and it should not be used as a sleep aid in psychogeriatric inpatients. The drug causes a delay in the onset, and decrease in the duration of REM sleep. Following discontinuation of the drug, REM sleep rebound has been reported in some studies. Nitrazepam is reported to significantly affect stages of sleep - a decrease in stage 1, 3, and 4 sleep and an increase in stage 2. In young volunteers, the pharmacological properties of nitrazepam were found to produce sedation and impaired psychomotor performance and standing steadiness. EEG tests showed decreased alpha activity and increased the beta activity, according to blood plasma levels of nitrazepam. Performance was significantly impaired 13 hours after dosing with nitrazepam, as were decision-making skills. EEG tests show more drowsiness and light sleep 18 hours after nitrazepam intake, more so than amylobarbitone. Fast activity was recorded via EEG 18 hours after nitrazepam dosing. An animal study demonstrated that nitrazepam induces a drowsy pattern of spontaneous EEG including high-voltage slow waves and spindle bursts increase in the cortex and amygdala, while the hippocampal theta rhythm is desynchronized. Also low-voltage fast waves occur particularly in the cortical EEG. The EEG arousal response to auditory stimulation and to electric stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular formation, posterior hypothalamus and centromedian thalamus is significantly suppressed. The photic driving response elicited by a flash light in the visual cortex is also suppressed by nitrazepam. Estazolam was found to be more potent however. Nitrazepam increases the slow wave light sleep (SWLS) in a dose-dependent manner whilst suppressing deep sleep stages. Less time is spent in stages 3 and 4 which are the deep sleep stages, when benzodiazepines such as nitrazepam are used. Benzodiazepines are therefore not good hypnotics in the treatment of insomnia. The suppression of deep sleep stages by benzodiazepines may be especially problematic to the elderly as they naturally spend less time in the deep sleep stage. Pharmacokinetics Nitrazepam is largely bound to plasma proteins. Benzodiazepines such as nitrazepam are lipid-soluble and have a high cerebral uptake. The time for nitrazepam to reach peak plasma concentrations following oral administration is about 2 hours (0.5 to 5 hours). The half-life of nitrazepam is between 16.5 and 48.3 hours. In young people, nitrazepam has a half-life of about 29 hours and a much longer half-life of 40 hours in the elderly. Both low dose (5 mg) and high dose (10 mg) of nitrazepam significantly increases growth hormone levels in humans. Nitrazepam's half- life in the cerebrospinal fluid, 68 hours, indicates that nitrazepam is eliminated extremely slowly from the cerebrospinal fluid. Concomitant food intake has no influence on the rate of absorption of nitrazepam nor on its bioavailability. Therefore, nitrazepam can be taken with or without food. Overdose Nitrazepam overdose may result in stereotypical symptoms of benzodiazepine overdose including intoxication, impaired balance and slurred speech. In cases of severe overdose this may progress to a comatose state with the possibility of death. The risk of nitrazepam overdose is increased significantly if nitrazepam is abused in conjunction with opioids, as was highlighted in a review of deaths of users of the opioid buprenorphine. Nitrobenzodiazepines such as nitrazepam can result in a severe neurological effects. Nitrazepam taken in overdose is associated with a high level of congenital abnormalities (30 percent of births). Most of the congentital abnormalities were mild deformities. Severe nitrazepam overdose resulting in coma causes the central somatosensory conduction time (CCT) after median nerve stimulation to be prolonged and the N20 to be dispersed. Brain-stem auditory evoked potentials demonstrate delayed interpeak latencies (IPLs) I-III, III-V and I-V. Toxic overdoses therefore of nitrazepam cause prolonged CCT and IPLs. An alpha pattern coma can be a feature of nitrazepam overdose with alpha patterns being most prominent in the frontal and central regions of the brain. Benzodiazepines were implicated in 39% of suicides by drug poisoning in Sweden, with nitrazepam and flunitrazepam accounting for 90% of benzodiazepine implicated suicides, in the elderly over a period of 2 decades. In three quarters of cases death was due to drowning, typically in the bath. Benzodiazepines were the predominant drug class in suicides in this review of Swedish death certificates. In 72% of the cases benzodiazepines were the only drug consumed. Benzodiazepines and in particular nitrazepam and flunitrazepam should therefore be prescribed with caution in the elderly. In a brain sample of a fatal nitrazepam poisoning high concentrations of nitrazepam and its metabolite were found in the brain of the deceased person. In a retrospective study of deaths, when benzodiazepines were implicated in the deaths, the benzodiazepines nitrazepam and flunitrazepam were the most common benzodiazepines involved. Benzodiazepines were a factor in all deaths related to drug addiction in this study of causes of deaths. Nitrazepam and flunitrazepam were significantly more commonly implicated in suicide related deaths than natural deaths. In four of the cases benzodiazepines alone were the only cause of death. In Australia, nitrazepam and temazepam were the benzodiazepines most commonly detected in overdose drug related deaths. In a third of cases benzodiazepines were the sole cause of death. Individuals with chronic illnesses are much more vulnerable to lethal overdose with nitrazepam, as fatal overdoses can occur at relatively low doses in these individuals. Synthesis Reaction of 2-amino-5-nitrobenzophenone (1) with bromoacetyl bromide forms the amide 2. Ring closure in liquid ammonia affords nitrazepam (3). More simply, diazepinone (4) can be nitrated directly at the more reactive C7 position with potassium nitrate in sulfuric acid.

Early career Wood was born in Lunenburg, Massachusetts. He was admitted to United States Military Academy at West Point on May 17, 1805 and graduated on October 30, 1806. After graduation he served as assistant Engineer in the construction of the defenses at Governor's Island in New York harbor, 1807. In February 1808 he was promoted to First Lieutenant. He assisted in the construction of Castle Williams in New York Harbor and Fort Norfolk in Virginia. War of 1812 Shortly after the start of the War of 1812, Wood was promoted to captain on July 1, 1812. He conducted the defence of Fort Meigs during its siege, was engaged in the sortie of May 5, 1813, for which he received a brevet (honorary promotion) to major. He was in command of the artillery at the battle of the Thames on October 5 of the same year. He was appointed acting adjutant-general to General William Henry Harrison in October 1813 and was transferred to the northern army in 1814. Wood was engaged in all the battles of that northern campaign, including the capture of Fort Erie on July 3. Wood was also in the battles of Chippawa and Niagara Falls, and was brevetted Lieutenant Colonel for bravery at the last- named action. After the battle of Niagara, the American army fell back to Fort Erie where Colonel Wood, then in command of the 21st Infantry Regiment, participated in the defense the fort on August 15, 1814. Colonel Wood died of wounds he received while leading a sortie from Fort Erie on September 17, 1814. Colonel Wood's burial location is unknown. While there is a monument to him in the West Point Cemetery, there is no evidence he is buried there. Legacy Wood was greatly admired by Major General Jacob Brown, who was Wood's commander at the time of his death and later the commanding general of the U.S. Army. Brown commissioned a monument in Wood's honor at West Point. Brown also had Fort Wood on Bedloe's Island in New York Harbor, on which the Statue of Liberty was later built, named after Wood. He is also the namesake of Wood County, Ohio.http://www.co.wood.oh.us/history/default.htm Wood's Monument at West Point was originally located near the parade field but was moved to the post cemetery in 1885. Wood was one of the first graduates of West Point to be killed in action. (The first was Ensign George Ronan, who was killed near Fort Dearborn in Chicago, Illinois on August 15, 1812.)

Unlike other letter variants such as \\"long s\\" which originally were orthographically distinctive, r rotunda has always been a calligraphic variant, used when the letter r followed a letter with a rounded stroke towards the right side, such as o, b, p, h (and d in typefaces where this letter has no vertical stroke, as in ‚àÇ, √∞). In this way, it is comparable to numerous other special types used for ligatures or conjoined letters in early modern typesetting.  Form  early printing, from a page printed by Pablo Hurus in 1496 in Zaragoza, Spain. The sample includes the types for r rotunda (marked red), ordinary r (marked green), and Tironian et (marked blue). William Caslon I (1692-1766) in 1763 in London. The sample shows r rotunda used in the words or, Mayors and corporate. Also seen in this sample are the ff and ct ligatures. This symbol came in several different shapes, all of which were of x-height. The shape of the letter used in blackletter scripts Textualis as well as Rotunda is reminiscent of \\"half an r\\", namely, the right side of the Roman capital \\"R\\"; it looks similar to an Arabic numeral \\"2\\". Like minuscules in general, the origins of the letter are in cursive writing as it was common during the medieval period, ultimately derived from scribal practice during Late Antiquity. The r rotunda shape of cursive r resembling the numeral \\"2\\" is also found in a number of medieval scribal abbreviations containing r, e.g. in the signs for the Latin word-final syllables ram, -orum and -arum. There are variant forms for the r rotunda glyph. Also found in Textura manuscripts is a very narrow second variant, in the form of one solid diamond atop another atop a vertical stroke. Another form found in German typefaces was a variant of that previous, with the part of an \\"s\\" that looks like an integral sign atop something rather like a \\"c\\". It can be found used as the second \\"r\\" of a pair and after \\"e\\". A fifth form, used in the 18th century in some French italic typefaces, was a derivative either of the Schrift form of the minuscule \\"r\\" or of similar typefaces used elsewhere. Its form was of a backwards \\"J\\" set just after the same shape rotated 180 degrees. They were separated by a space smaller than the stroke width between them, and the whole character was slanted as though it were cursive. As this typeface had the \\"d\\" that curved to the left, it was used after that character as well. By then, though, the character was the same width as a regular \\"r\\" so it was maintained because it appeared to its users to have some elegance or to remind them of prestigious old calligraphy. Use for Tironian et Example of etc. typeset with r rotunda in a Fraktur typeface The abbreviation etc. was typeset using the Tironian et (‚Åä), as ‚Åäc. in early incunables. Later, when typesets no longer contained a glyph for the Tironian et, it became common practice to use the r rotunda glyph instead, setting Íùõc. for etc.  Demise  Comparison of the r rotunda and the normal r in the Leeds Uni typeface Use of the letter form was never widespread except in blackletter scripts and so it fell out of use in English in the 16th century as roman scripts became predominant. Modern cursive scripts use a letter r that has a resemblance to the r rotunda. Encoding The Unicode letter pair rendered in different fonts Geneva, included with MacOS. The letter was proposed to be added to Unicode in 2005, in the Latin Extended-D block. As per Unicode 5.1 the encodings are and , although there seems to be no real evidence for the historical existence of a capital version and a normal capital R seems to have been used instead. Before, the Medieval Unicode Font Initiative (MUFI) had allocated it in the Private Use Area (PUA) of medievalist fonts at U+F20E and U+F22D. Since the characters are available in Unicode, MUFI recommends that the Unicode code points be used, not the PUA code points. Some fonts treat the glyph as a mere stylistic variant of \\"r\\" and may make it available by smart font features, e.g. Open Type 'hist', 'hlig', 'calt', 'salt' or 'ss**'. Latin Extended-D also has characters for medieval scribal abbreviations. Among them is the abbreviation for the syllable rum, consisting of a r rotunda with a cut, resulting in a shape very similar to the astrological symbol for Jupiter (‚ôÉ). *U+A75C Íùú LATIN CAPITAL LETTER RUM ROTUNDA *U+A75D Íùù LATIN SMALL LETTER RUM ROTUNDA References  External links  * Category:Blackletter Category:Typography Category:Palaeographic letter variants ","title":"R rotunda"},{"id":"1102374","text":"Tilghman Mayfield Tucker (February 5, 1802 ‚Äì April 3, 1859) was Governor of Mississippi from 1842 to 1844.

Tucker was elected in 1831 to the Mississippi House of Representatives as a Democrat and was the first representative from Lowndes County, and served until 1835. From 1838 to 1841 he served in the state senate. By 1841, the aftermath of the Panic of 1837 had caused a division among Mississippi Democrats. The issue was whether the state would honor the bonds of the Planters Bank and Union Bank, both of which had failed in the panic. Some Democrats stated that they would support the Whig gubernatorial candidate David Shattuck who wanted the redemption of the bonds. Though Tucker was at first reluctant to accept the Democratic nomination in a hopeless race, he accepted and won with a narrow victory. During Tucker's two-year term (1842‚Äì1844), the Democratic Party remained divided over the bond issue. Also, Tucker's political opponents accused him of not acting fast enough in matter of state treasurer Richard S. Graves, who had embezzled $44,000 of state funding and fled to Canada. Tucker did not run for re-election, but he did win one term in the U.S. House of Representatives from March 4, 1843 to March 3, 1845. He then retired from public life and moved to his Louisiana plantation home named Cottonwood. While visiting his father near Bexar in Marion County, Alabama, Tucker died on April 3, 1859.

Early life He was born to Joseph and Elizabeth (Rice) Brown, a poor farming family, in the Chester District of South Carolina, at the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in 1813. In 1823, when he was only 10 years old his family moved to the new state of Mississippi. The Brown family settled Copiah County, south of the state capital, Jackson. Raising cotton in the new frontier state proved to be lucrative for the Brown family. In 1824, just one year after settling in Mississippi, Joseph Brown was elected Justice of the Peace in Copiah County. By 1825, two years after arriving in Mississippi, he was the third-largest taxpayer in the county, owning 18 slaves. By 1832, he was farming a plantation of 1,600 acres and owned 23 slaves. In 1829, Albert Brown entered Mississippi College, but he soon transferred to Jefferson College, which he attended for about six months.Ranck, p. 1. Political career During his lifetime, Brown was one of the most popular and the most influential men in Mississippi. He is considered to be the father of the public school system and of the University of Mississippi. His rhetorical attacks on illiteracy are considered to have made a substantial contribution to the cause of education in Mississippi. He was also a Fire-Eater and a strong advocate for the expansion of slavery. In 1858, he said: \\"I want a foothold in Central America... because I want to plant slavery there.... I want Cuba,... Tamaulipas, Potosi, and one or two other Mexican States; and I want them all for the same reason - for the planting or spreading of slavery.\\" (Akhil Reed Amar, America's Constitution, A Biography (2005) 267, quoting M.W. Mcklusky, ed., Speeches, Messages, and Other Writings of the Hon. Albert G. Brown (1859), 594-5) Indeed, he went on to say, \\"I would spread the blessings of slavery, like the religion of our Divine Master, to the uttermost ends of the earth.\\" To those who agreed with such views, \\"Albert Gallatin Brown possessed magical powers. With many learnt spells, handsome continence, surrounded by a luxuriant, flowing beard and dark-curly hair, in every sense he looked distinguished. Courageous, he was void of vanity; animated, he was persuasive; his spirit, crackerish to the extreme.\\" In his speech, Reuben Davis, who knew him well, states in his book Reminiscences on Mississippi and Mississippians that Brown \\"was the best- balanced man I ever knew.... In politics, he had strategy with-out corruption, and handled all his opponents with skill but never descended to intrigue.\\" During a lifetime, most of which was spent in an epoch of bitter controversy, his most intimate friends never heard him speak ill of others. Brown served three terms in the state legislature, four in the US Congress, one on the circuit bench. He was twice elected United States senator, twice Governor, and one senator in the Confederate Congress. Rand wrote that \\"the political career of Albert Gallatin Brown provides one of the most amazing chapters in Mississippi history.\\" Death Overcome by a stroke of apoplexy, Brown fell face down in a shallow pond at his home near Terry in 1880. His last remains rest in Greenwood Cemetery, Jackson. Personal life Brown's first wife was Elizabeth Frances Thornton Taliaferro (1817‚Äì1836) of Virginia, who died about five months after the marriage. She was the daughter of Richard Henry Taliaferro, Sr. (1783‚Äì1830) and Frances Walker Gilmer (ca. 1784-1826). Brown's second wife was Roberta Eugenia Young (1813‚Äì1886), daughter of Brig. Gen. Robert Young (1768‚Äì1824) and Elizabeth Mary Conrad (1772‚Äì1810). Roberta's older sister was Elizabeth Mary Young (1804‚Äì1859), the wife of Philip Richard Fendall II (1794‚Äì1867), the District Attorney of the District of Columbia. Legacy In Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, a narrative written by the escaped slave Harriet Jacobs, Brown is called out by Jacobs for supporting slavery in a speech to Congress despite the fact that he \\"could not be ignorant of [the wrongdoings perpetrated against slaves], for they are of frequent occurrence in every Southern State.\\" Jacobs, Harriet A., Lydia Maria Child, and Jean Fagan.

As of 2005, it is inhabited by 13 Christian Orthodox monks led by hegumen Macarie Bogu»ô. It is part of the Bucharest archdiocese. Overview \\"Biserica Veche\\" (The Old Church) at the Sinaia Monastery Situated in the Prahova Valley, the monastery gave its name to the nearby town of Sinaia. The monastery consists of two courtyards surrounded by low buildings. In the centre of each courtyard there is a small church built in the Byzantine style. One of them‚Äî\\"Biserica Veche\\" (The Old Church)‚Äîdates from 1695, while the more recent \\"Biserica Mare\\" (The Great Church) was built in 1846. The monks possess a library that is a repository for valuable jewels belonging to the Cantacuzino family, as well as the earliest Romanian translation of the Bible, dated 1668. Take Ionescu, former Prime Minister of Romania, is buried on the grounds. History Prince (SpƒÉtarul) Mihail Cantacuzino founded the monastery upon his return from a pilgrimage to Mount Sinai. The first buildings were completed between 1690 and 1695. It was designed to serve as a monastery as well as a fortified stronghold on the route from Brasov to Bucharest. The initial plan was for the monastery to hold 12 monks, to imitate the Twelve Apostles, but in time the number of monks grew. In the midst of the Russo-Turkish War, 1735‚Äì1739, before deserting the monastery, monks hid the valuables by burying them inside a bell. During a battle, the Turks defeated troops stationed within the walls of the monastery. The Ottomans burned the area and broke through the wall in two places. Until 1850, Sinaia consisted of little more than the monastery and a group of huts. In 1864, however, the monastic estate was assigned to the Board of Civil Hospitals (Eforia Spitalelor Civile), which opened a hospital and several baths, and helped develop mineral springs in Sinaia. In 1948, the monastery was put under the patronage of the Archdiocese of Bucharest from the Board of Civil Hospitals. The Romanian Patriarch, Justinian Marina, restored the buildings between the years 1951 and 1957 with money from the Archdiocese. During this period, the whole monastery was fitted with running water, electricity, and natural gas. Thanks to the efforts of King Carol I, the Great Church of the monastery became the first church to use electric lights in Romania. The Old Church The entrance door of the Old Church The Old Church was built in 1695. In 2006, it was closed to begin a restoration project to return it to its former beauty. The original interior painting was completed by P√¢rvu Mutu and were restored for the first time in 1795. The Old Church has reopened as of 2016. The Great Church Under the leadership of Hegumens Ioasaf and Paisie, construction of The Great Church began in 1842 using funds allocated by the monastery and was completed in 1846. This smaller structure was enlarged by the Board of Civil Hospitals during a period from 1897 to 1903. These efforts gave the building the appearance it has today. Current appearance Created by architect George Mandrea, the structure utilizes the Moldavian style and the Br√¢ncovenesc style from Walachia. It is said that the belt of three green enamel lines that encircle the building represent the unity of the Holy Trinity in one God and the unity of the Three Romanian Kingdoms in one country. Paintings The gold mosaic paintings were created by Danish artist Aage Exner in a typical neo-Byzantine style. The main illustrations show five persons: * Iosif Gheorghian mitropolit primat ‚Äì he re-opened the building in 1903 * Carol I of Romania ‚Äì shown dressed as an officer, with his right hand upon a rock pillar with a missing piece. This symbolizes the missing Romanian territories at that time * Elisabeth of Wied ‚Äì Queen consort of Romania, known in the literary world as Carmen Sylva * Princess Maria of Romania ‚Äì Queen Elisabeta's only child, who died at an early age * Mihail Cantacuzino ‚Äì builder of the Old Church Furniture The furniture was made of wood (sycamore, maple, and oak) by Constantin Babic and his students at the Bucharest Art School (·π¢coala de Arte si Meserii). The King's throne displays the royal emblem and the motto Nihil sine Deo (Nothing without God). The Queen's throne is embossed with the letters E.D.,\\"Welcome to Romania website\\",2005‚Äì2011,\\"\\", accessed: 14 January 2011 Both thrones are gold-plated. The two Russian icons, of Saint Serghei and Saint Nicholas, were a gift from Tsar Nicholas II of Russia in 1903. They were presented to the Hegumen Nifon Arhimandritul for the baptism of Prince Nicholae, son of King Ferdinand. A remarkable piece adorning the monastery is the epitaphios by Anna Roth, made of silk and gold on a cotton base. It took three years (from 1897 to 1900) to finish. The bell tower The Bell Tower as seen from within the walls During the leadership of Hegumen Nifon Popescu (1888‚Äì1909), a large bell tower was added to the monastery walls. It was completed in 1892. The bell was brought from the Col≈£ea Tower in Bucharest. The museum In 1895 the museum of the monastery was opened, the first exhibition of religious objects in Romania. It holds collections of icons and crosses from the 17th century, the very first Bible in Romanian (Bucharest, 1688), and many other precious objects. The museum is open every day but Mondays, from April to October 10:00-16:00 and during winter time only for groups over 20. Fee: 5 lei (2 lei for students). Location The monastery is nearby Pele≈ü Castle and it can be reached by train as Sinaia railway station is just 'downstairs' from the monastery. It is also accessible by road.

Education He attended the I Liceum Og√≥lnokszta≈ÇcƒÖce im. Miko≈Çaja Kopernika (1st Secondary High School of Miko≈Çaj Kopernik) in Bielsko-Bia≈Ça. Zurek earned his M.Sc. in physics at AGH University of Science and Technology, Krak√≥w, Poland in 1974 and completed his Ph.D. under advisor William C. Schieve at the University of Texas at Austin in 1979.CV He spent two years at Caltech as a Tolman Fellow, and started at LANL as a J. Oppenheimer Fellow. Career He was the leader of the Theoretical Astrophysics Group at Los Alamos from 1991 until he was made a Laboratory Fellow in the Theory Division in 1996. Zurek is currently a foreign associate of the Cosmology' Program at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. He served as a member of the external faculty of the Santa Fe Institute, and has been a visiting professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Zurek co-organized the programs Quantum Coherence and Decoherence and Quantum Computing and Chaos at UCSB's Institute for Theoretical Physics. He researches decoherence, physics of quantum and classical information, non-equilibrium dynamics of defect generation, and astrophysics. He is also the co-author, along with William Wootters and Dennis Dieks, of a proof stating that a single quantum cannot be cloned (see the no cloning theorem). He also coined the terms einselection and quantum discord. Zurek with his colleague Tom W. B. Kibble pioneered a paradigmatic framework for understanding defect generation in non-equilibrium processes, particularly, for understanding topological defects generated when a second-order phase transition point is crossed at a finite rate. The paradigm covers phenomena of enormous varieties and scales, ranging from structure formation in the early Universe to vortex generation in superfluids. The key mechanism of critical defect generation is known as the Kibble‚ÄìZurek mechanism, and the resulting scaling laws known as the Kibble‚ÄìZurek scaling laws. He pointed out the fundamental role of environment in determining a set of special basis states immune to environmental decoherence (pointer basis) which defines a classical measuring apparatus unambiguously. His work on decoherence paves a way towards the understanding of emergence of the classical world from the quantum mechanical one, getting rid of ad hoc demarcations between the two, like the one imposed by Niels Bohr in the famous Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. The underlying mechanism proposed and developed by Zurek and his collaborators is known as quantum Darwinism. His work also has a lot of potential benefit to the emerging field of quantum computing. He is a pioneer in information physics, edited an influential book on \\"Complexity, Entropy and the Physics of Information\\", and spearheaded the efforts that finally exorcised Maxwell's demon. Zurek showed that the demon can extract energy from its environment for \\"free\\" as long as it (a) is able to find structure in the environment, and (b) is able to compress this pattern (whereas the remaining code is more succinct than the brute-force description of the structure). In this way the demon can exploit thermal fluctuations. However, he showed that in thermodynamic equilibrium (the most likely state of the environment), the demon can at best break even, even if the information about the environment is compressed. As a result of his exploration, Zurek suggests to redefine entropy and distinguish between two parts: the part that we already know about the environment (measured in Kolmogorov complexity), and, conditioned on our knowledge, the remaining uncertainty (measured in Shannon entropy). He is a staff scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory and also a Laboratory Fellow (a prestigious distinction for a US National Laboratory scientist).

This includes acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, neuroblastoma, and small cell lung cancer among others. It is given intravenously. Most people experience some side effects from vincristine treatment. Commonly it causes a change in sensation, hair loss, constipation, difficulty walking, and headaches. Serious side effects may include neuropathic pain, lung damage, or low white blood cells which increases the risk of infection. Use during pregnancy may result in birth defects. It works by stopping cells from dividing properly. Vincristine was first isolated in 1961. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is a vinca alkaloid that can be obtained from the Madagascar periwinkle Catharanthus roseus. Medical uses Vincristine is delivered via intravenous infusion for use in various types of chemotherapy regimens. Its main uses are in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as part of the chemotherapy regimen CHOP, Hodgkin's lymphoma as part of MOPP, COPP, BEACOPP, or the less popular Stanford V chemotherapy regimen in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and in treatment for nephroblastoma. It is also used to induce remission in ALL with dexamethasone and L-Asparaginase, and in combination with prednisone to treat childhood leukemia. Vincristine is occasionally used as an immunosuppressant, for example, in treating thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Side effects The main side effects of vincristine are chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, hyponatremia, constipation, and hair loss. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy can be severe, and may be a reason to reduce or avoid using vincristine. The symptoms of this are progressive and enduring tingling numbness, pain and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes affecting the arms and legs. One of the first symptoms of peripheral neuropathy is foot drop: A person with a family history of foot drop and/or Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) should avoid the taking of vincristine. Accidental injection of vinca alkaloids into the spinal canal (intrathecal administration) is highly dangerous, with a mortality rate approaching 100 percent. The medical literature documents cases of ascending paralysis due to massive encephalopathy and spinal nerve demyelination, accompanied by intractable pain, almost uniformly leading to death. Several patients have survived after aggressive and immediate intervention. Rescue treatments consist of washout of the cerebrospinal fluid and administration of protective medications. Children may do better following this injury. One child, who was aggressively treated at the time of the injection, recovered almost completely with only mild neurological deficits. A significant series of inadvertent intrathecal vincristine administration occurred in China in 2007 when batches of cytarabine and methotrexate (both often used intrathecally) manufactured by the company Shanghai Hualian were found to be contaminated with vincristine. The overuse of vincristine may also lead to drug resistance by overexpression of the p-glycoprotein pump (Pgp). There is an attempt to overcome resistance by the addition of derivatives and substituents to the vincristine molecule. Mechanism of action Vincristine works partly by binding to the tubulin protein, stopping the tubulin dimers from polymerizing to form microtubules, causing the cell to be unable to separate its chromosomes during the metaphase. The cell then undergoes apoptosis. The vincristine molecule inhibits leukocyte production and maturation. A downside, however, to Vincristine is that it does not only affect the division of cancer cells. It affects all rapidly dividing cell types, making it necessary for the very specific administration of the drug. Pharmacology The natural extraction of vincristine from Catharanthus roseus is produced at a percent yield of less than 0.0003%. For this reason, alternate methods to produce synthetic vincristine are being used. Vincristine is created through the semi-synthesis coupling of indole alkaloids vindoline and catharanthine in the vinca plant. It can also now be synthesized through a stereocontrolled total synthesis technique which retains the correct stereochemistry at C18' and C2'. The absolute stereochemistry at these carbons is responsible for vincristine's anticancer activity. The liposome encapsulation of vincristine enhances the efficacy of the vincristine drug while simultaneously decreasing the neurotoxicity associated with it. Liposome encapsulation increases vincristine's plasma concentration and circulation lifetime in the body, and allows the drug to enter cells more easily. History thumb Having been used as a folk remedy for centuries, studies in the 1950s revealed that the rosy periwinkle Catharanthus roseus contained over 120 alkaloids, many of which are biologically active, the two most significant being vincristine and vinblastine. While initial studies for its use in diabetes mellitus were disappointing, the discovery that it caused myelosuppression (decreased activity of the bone marrow) led to its study in mice with leukemia, whose lifespan was prolonged by the use of a vinca preparation. Treatment of the ground plant with Skelly-B defatting agent and an acid benzene extract led to a fraction termed \\"fraction A\\". This fraction was further treated with aluminium oxide, chromatography, trichloromethane, benz-dichloromethane, and separation by pH to yield vincristine. Vincristine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 1963 under the trade name Oncovin and was marketed by Eli Lilly Company. The drug was initially discovered by a team at Lilly Research Laboratories where it was demonstrated that vincristine cured artificially induced leukemia in mice. Vincristine also induced remission of acute leukemias of childhood. Production of vincristine required one ton of dried periwinkle leaves to produce one ounce of vincristine. Periwinkle was grown on a ranch in Texas. Society and culture  Suppliers  Until recently, two generic drug makers were suppliers of vincristine in the United States: Teva and Pfizer. In 2019 Teva stopped producing vincristine, leaving Pfizer as the only company in production. Teva has said that they will restart production, and expect it to be available in 2020.  Shortage  In October 2019 an impending shortage was reported; no adequate substitute is known for treating childhood-cancers. Controversy Pharmaceutical bioprospecting Vincristine's origins are debated as an example of pharmaceutical bioprospecting in the fields of ethnobotany and ethnomedicine. Some consider the catharanthus roseus plant from which vincristine is derived, and its folk remedies to be endemic to Madagascar, and that Madagascar was denied royalties from vincristine sales. However, catharanthus roseus has a documented history in folk medicine treatments in other locations. In 1963, Lilly researchers acknowledged that the plant was used in Brazil to treat hemorrhage, scurvy, toothaches, and chronic wounds; in the British West Indies to treat diabetic ulcers; and in the Philippines and South Africa as a oral hypoglycemic agent ‚Äì but not as a treatment for cancer. Catharanthus roseus has been a cosmopolitan species since before the Industrial Revolution and the plant's use in folk remedies suggested general bioactivity for diabetes treatment, not cancer. In the mid- eighteenth century, botanist Judith Sumner recorded the arrival of catharanthus roses at London's Chelsea Physic Garden from the Jardin des plantes in Paris. It's unclear how the plant first arrived in Paris and the details of its origins in Madagascar beyond reports of its transport from Madagascar by early European explorers. Vincristine was initially distributed at cost to increase accessibility, though later switched to a for-profit model to recover the costs of production and development. According to Michael Brown, vincristine may not be a tidy example of pharmaceutical bioprospecting, but it demonstrates how pharmaceuticals with a history of use in folk medicine have intellectual property claims which are difficult to untangle. Since ethonobotanical studies and pharmaceutical bioprospecting depend on traditional knowledge from indigenous communities, the process of sourcing botanical and biological knowledge raises issues of the proper representation of the indigenous and local knowledge.

Early years and education Born in Chicago, Illinois into a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant family of considerable wealth, Mary Jayne Gold was educated at the Master's School at Dobbs Ferry, New York and a finishing school in Italy. In the 1930s, her money allowed her to enjoy the vibrant social scene in London and Paris. Piloting her own airplane, she traveled around Europe, spending her time at luxury hotels, skiing at the best resorts in the Alps, and socializing with the elite of the day. During World War II Gold was living in a Paris apartment when France fell to the onslaught of the German army in 1940. She fled to the Mediterranean seaport of Marseille in southern France which, although not Nazi occupied, was under the control of the collaborationist Vichy regime. In Marseille she met Miriam Davenport, an American art student, and Varian Fry, an American journalist and intellectual. Fry had come to France on a personal mission to help members of Europe's intellectual and artistic community escape the Nazi threat. In the armistice agreement between Germany and defeated France, France had agreed to \\"surrender on demand\\" refugees to the Nazis.* Peggy Guggenheim, Out of This Century, Confessions of an Art Addict, (Foreword by Gore Vidal, (Introduction by Alfred H. Barr Jr.) p.192, ANCHOR BOOKS, Doubleday & Company, Inc. Universe Books 1979, Instead of returning to the United States, Mary Jayne Gold chose to remain and joined Davenport and Fry along with other volunteers in sheltering refugees and organizing their escape through the mountains to Spain or by smuggling them aboard freighters sailing to either North Africa or ports in North or South America. She was helped in part by returning French Foreign Legionnaire turned local gangster Raymond Couraud, who became her lover. Mary Jayne Gold helped subsidize the operation which is credited with participating in the rescue of some 2,000 refugees, Among the escapees were notables such as the sculptor Jacques Lipchitz, artist Marc Chagall, writer Hannah Arendt and Nobel Prize winner, physician and biochemist Otto Meyerhof. In fall 1941, Mary Jayne Gold returned to the United States, while Couraud traveled to Spain and onwards to England, where he became a war hero in the Special Air Service. After the war After the war, she divided her time between her apartment in New York City and a house she had built in the village of Gassin, Var, not far from St. Tropez, on the French Riviera. In 1980, she wrote about her wartime experiences in the memoir Crossroads Marseilles 1940, published by Doubleday in 1980, and translated into French in 2001 by Alice Seelow. Mary Jayne Gold's literary estate was left to Pierre Sauvage. Mary Jayne Gold never married and had no children. She died of pancreatic cancer in 1997 at her villa in Gassin. Her great-nephew's mother, Alison Leslie Gold, is a well-known author of books on the Holocaust, notably, Anne Frank Remembered: The Story of the Woman Who Helped Hide the Frank Family (1987), which was co-written with Miep Gies.

(; September 13, 1923 ‚Äì November 29, 1941) was a Soviet partisan.Pravda.ru Russian women heroes of the Great Patriotic War, a photo report She was executed after acts of sabotage against the invading armies of Nazi Germany; after stories emerged of her defiance towards her captors, she was posthumously declared a Hero of the Soviet Union.Kazimiera J. Cottam: Women in War and Resistance: Selected Biographies of Soviet Women Soldiers, , page 297 She became one of the most revered heroines of the Soviet Union.The Voice of Russia: Road to Victory: Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya Family The Kosmodemyansky family name was constructed by joining the names of Saints Cosmas and Damian (Kosma and Demyan in Russian). From the 17th century, the Kosmodemyansky were priests in the Russian Orthodox Church. Zoya's grandfather Pyotr Kosmodemyansky was murdered in 1918 by militant atheists for his opposition to blasphemy.Valentina Kuchenkova Martyrdom of village priest Pyotr Kosmodemyansky (in Russian) Zoya (her name is a Russian form of the Greek name Zoe, which means \\"life\\") was born in 1923 in the village of Osino-Gay (–û—Å–∏–Ω–æ- –ì–∞–π) (meaning Aspen Woods), near the city of Tambov. Her father, Anatoly Kosmodemyansky, studied in a theological seminary, but did not graduate. He later worked as a librarian. Her mother, Lyubov Kosmodemyanskaya (n√©e Churikova), was a school teacher. In 1925 Zoya's brother, Aleksandr Kosmodemyansky, was born. Like his sister, he was awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union, and, like Zoya, posthumously. In 1929, the family moved to Siberia for fear of persecution. In 1930 they moved to Moscow.Vladimir Kreslavsky The truth about Zoya and Shura(in Russian) Life and death Kosmodemyanskaya joined the Komsomol in 1938. In October 1941, still a high school student in Moscow, she volunteered for a partisan unit. She was assigned to the partisan unit 9903 (Staff of the Western Front). Of the one thousand people who joined the unit in October 1941, only half survived the war. At the village of Obukhovo near Naro-Fominsk, Kosmodemyanskaya and other partisans crossed the front line and entered territory occupied by the Germans. They mined roads and cut communication lines. On November 27, 1941, Kosmodemyanskaya received an assignment to burn the village of Petrishchevo, where a German cavalry regiment was stationed. Together with fellow partisans Boris Krainov and Vasily Klubkov, she set fire to three houses in the village.–ì–æ—Ä–∏–Ω–æ–≤ –ú. –ú. –ó–æ—è –ö–æ—Å–º–æ–¥–µ–º—å—è–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è. –û—Ç–µ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è. The partisans believed that one of the houses was being used as a German communications center and that occupying forces were using others for accommodation. The writer A. Zhovtis has disputed these claims, arguing that officially Petrishchevo was not a point of permanent deployment of German troops. However, the villagers said that virtually all the houses of the village were used for accommodation by the German troops transported along the main roads near the village. After the first attempt at arson, Krainov did not wait for Kosmodemyanskaya and Klubkov at the agreed meeting place and left, returning to his own. Later, Klubkov was also captured by the Germans. Kosmodemyanskaya, having missed her comrades and left alone, decided to return to Petrishchevo and continue the arson campaign. However, the German military authorities in the village had by then organized a gathering of local residents, forming a militia in order to avoid further arson. After being arrested, Kosmodemyanskaya was stripped, beaten, interrogated and tortured with 200 lashes and her body burnt, but refused to give any information. The following morning she was marched to the center of the village with a board around her neck bearing the inscription 'Houseburner' and hanged. Her final words were: and to the Germans: Before the moment of hanging, with the rope on her neck, she said: The Germans left her body hanging on the gallows for several weeks. One of her breasts was cut off and her body desecrated by Germans or collaborators. Eventually she was buried just before the Soviets regained the territory in January 1942. Fame The story of Kosmodemyanskaya's death became popular after Pravda published an article written by Pyotr Lidov on January 27, 1942. The journalist had heard about her execution from an elderly peasant, and was impressed by her courage. The witness recounted: \\"They were hanging her and she was giving a speech. They were hanging her and she was threatening them.\\" Lidov travelled to Petrishchevo, collected details from local residents and published an article about the then-unknown partisan girl. Soon after, Joseph Stalin noticed the article. He proclaimed: \\"Here is the people's heroine\\", which started a propaganda campaign honouring Kosmodemyanskaya. In February, she was identified and was awarded the order of Hero of the Soviet Union.Mikhail Gorinov, Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya (1923‚Äì1941) , Otechestvennaya istoriia, ‚Ññ1, 2003, Kosmodemyanskaya's account was repeatedly published in Pravda. Numerous Soviet writers, artists, sculptors and poets dedicated their works to her. In 1944, the film Zoya was made about her. She was also referred to in the film Girl No. 217, which depicted atrocities committed against Soviet prisoners of war by the Nazis. Her image was also used frequently in anti-German propaganda which encouraged violence against the German occupying forces. Many streets, kolkhozes and Pioneer organizations in the Soviet Union were named after Kosmodemyanskaya. Her portrait became a part of ceremonial procedures of commemoration performed by pioneers, and was used as a symbol of the highest distinction awarded to the best class in school. The Soviets erected a monument in her honour not far from the village of Petrishchevo. Another statue is located at the Partizanskaya Moscow Metro station. A 4108-meter (13,478 feet) mountain peak in Trans-Ili Alatau is named after her. A minor planet 1793 Zoya, discovered in 1968 by Soviet astronomer Tamara Mikhailovna Smirnova, is named after her. Kosmodemyanskaya is buried at Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. Zoya Phan, an outspoken political activist for the Karen people and member of the Burma Campaign UK, was named after Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya by her father, Padoh Mahn Sha Lah Phan. He chose the name because he had read about Kosmodemyanskaya while studying at Yangon University and saw several parallels between the Karen resistance against the Burmese government and the Soviet resistance against the Nazis in Europe.Zoya Phan, Damien Lewis. \\"Little Daughter: a Memoir of Survival in Burma and the West\\", 2009 Post-Soviet research and controversy 1990s media controversy Kosmodemyanskaya's life became a subject of media controversy during the 1990s. In September 1991, an article by Aleksandr Zhovtis was published in the weekly Russian magazine Argumenty i Fakty.Alexander Zhovtis Corrections to the canonical versions, Argumenty i Fakty, N39, 1991Legends of the Great Patriotic War. Zoya Kosomodemyanskaya Mass-media in internet. April 5, 2005 The article alleged that there were no German troops in the village of Petrishchevo, in spite of several photos of her being hanged by German soldiers. Zhovtis blamed Stalin's scorched earth policy for the 'unnecessary' death of the young woman. The newspaper subsequently published letters from readers, many of which included stories contradicting the mainstream version. One researcher claimed that the person executed in Petrishchevo was not Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya but a \\"missing in action\\" partisan, although later official conclusion from the Institute for Criminal Expertise and the Department of Justice of the Russian Federation stated otherwise. The Argumenty i Fakty articles prompted a response from Pravda observer Viktor Kozhemyaka in the form of an article titled Fifty years after her death Zoya is tortured and executed again.Viktor Kozhemyaka. Fifty years after her death Zoya is tortured and executed again Pravda November 29, 1991 Ten years later, Kozhemyaka wrote another article Zoya is executed yet again,Viktor Kozhemyaka Zoya is executed yet again Pravda, November 29 and November 30, 2001 in which he lamented some \\"absurd material\\" on Internet discussion forums, which alleged that Zoya had hurt Russian peasants rather than German troops, that she suffered from schizophrenia, and that she was a fanatical Stalinist. In 1997, the newspaper Glasnost published the previously unknown protocols of the official commission of residents of Petrishchevo village and Gribtsovsky selsoviet from January 25, 1942 (two months after Zoya's execution).Ivan Osadchy Her name and deeds are immortal, Glasnost, September 24, 1997 The protocols stated that Kosmodemyanskaya was caught while trying to destroy a stable containing more than 300 German horses. They also described her torture and execution. A slightly different story was recorded in the notes of researcher Pyotr Lidov, published in Parlamentskaya Gazeta in 1999. According to these, Kosmodemyanskaya and Vasily Klubkov were caught while asleep on the outskirts of Petrishchevo. The Germans were called by Petrishchevo resident Semyon Sviridov. Lidov's notes also included an interview with a German noncommissioned officer taken prisoner by the Red Army. The interview described the negative effect on the morale of the German soldiers who witnessed the burning of the houses. Klubkov's betrayal version Some details of Kosmodemyanskaya's assignment and arrest were classified for about sixty years because treachery might have been involved. The case was declassified in 2002, and then reviewed by Russia's Chief Military Prosecutor Office, and it was decided that Vasily Klubkov, who betrayed Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, was not eligible for rehabilitation. According to the case, three Soviet combatants, Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, Vasily Klubkov, and their commander Boris Krainov, had to perform acts of sabotage in Reichskommissariat Ostland. They had been given the task of setting fire to houses in the village of Petrishchevo, where German troops were quartered. Krainov was to operate in the central part of the village, Kosmodemyanskaya in the southern and Klubkov in the northern parts. Krainov was the first to carry out his task and returned to the base. Kosmodemyanskaya performed her task too, and three columns of flame in the southern part of Petrishchevo were seen from the base. Only the northern part was not set on fire. According to Klubkov, he was captured by two German soldiers and taken to their headquarters. A German officer threatened to kill him, and Klubkov gave him the names of Kosmodemyanskaya and Krainov. After this, Kosmodemyanskaya was captured by the Germans.

By age 25, Carn√© had already directed his first short film, Nogent, Eldorado du dimanche (1929). He assisted Feyder (and Ren√© Clair) on several films through to La kermesse h√©ro√Øque (1935). Feyder accepted an invitation to work in England for Alexander Korda, for whom he made Knight Without Armour (1937), but made it possible for Carn√© to take over his project, Jenny (1936), as its director. The film marked the beginning of a successful collaboration with surrealist poet and screenwriter Jacques Pr√©vert. This collaborative relationship lasted for more than a dozen years, during which Carn√© and Pr√©vert created their best remembered films. Together, they were involved in the poetic realism film movement of fatalistic tragedies; Ginette Vincendeau said that \\"the movement‚Äôs greatest classics are probably Marcel Carn√©‚Äôs Le Quai des brumes in 1938 and Le Jour Se L√®ve in 1939.\\" Under the German occupation of France during World War II, Carn√© worked in the Vichy zone where he subverted the regime's attempts to control art; several of his team were Jewish, including Joseph Kosma and set designer Alexandre Trauner. Under difficult conditions they made Carn√©'s most highly regarded film Les Enfants du paradis (Children of Paradise, 1945) released after the Liberation of France. In the late 1990s, the film was voted \\"Best French Film of the Century\\" in a poll of 600 French critics and professionals. Post war, he and Pr√©vert followed this triumph with what at the time was the most expensive production ever undertaken in the history of French film. But the result, titled Les Portes de la nuit, was panned by the critics and a box office failure and was their last completed film. By the 1950s, Carn√©'s reputation was in eclipse. The critics of Cahiers du cin√©ma, who became the film makers of the New Wave, dismissed him and placed his films' merits solely with Pr√©vert.Gilbert Adair and Mike Goodridge Obituary: Marcel Carn√©, The Independent, 1 November 1996 Other than his 1958 hit Les Tricheurs, Carn√©'s postwar films met with only uneven success and many were greeted by an almost unrelenting negative criticism from the press and within members of the film industry. In 1958, Carn√© was the Head of the Jury at the 6th Berlin International Film Festival. His 1971 film Law Breakers was entered into the 7th Moscow International Film Festival. Carn√© made his last film in 1976. Carn√© was openly homosexual. Several of his later films contain references to male homosexuality or bisexuality. His one-time partner was Roland Lesaffre who appeared in many of his films.

Harith returned to Mecca to announce the death of \`AbdullƒÅh to his aged father and his bereaved wife ƒÄminah.Ibn Sa'd/Haq pp. 107-108.Armstrong, Karen. Muhammad : A Biography of the Prophet. HarperSanFrancisco: San Francisco, 1993. Abdullah left a few camels and goats and a slave girl named Umm Ayman as terms of inheritance. He was buried in Dar ul Nabeghah in Madina (today Saudi Arabia) and his mausoleum was demolished in 1976. Reportedly he was reburied in Al' Baqee Graveyard next to Muhammad's son. Estate 'AbdullƒÅh left five camels, a herd of sheep and goats, and an Abyssinian slave nurse, called Umm Ayman, who was to take care of his son Muhammad.Ibn Sa'd/Haq p. 109. This patrimony does not prove that 'AbdullƒÅh was wealthy, but at the same time it does not prove that he was poor. Furthermore, 'AbdullƒÅh was still a young man capable of working and of amassing a fortune. His father was still alive and none of his wealth had as yet been transferred to his sons.Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources, Martin Lings, George Allen & Unwin, 1983, p24 Fate in the afterlife Islamic scholars have long been divided over the religious beliefs of Muhammad's parents and their fate in the afterlife. One transmission by Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah states that God refused to forgive Aminah for her disbelief. Another transmission in Musnad al-Bazzar states that Muhammad's mother was brought back to life and accepted Islam then returned to the barzakh. Some Ash øari and Shafi‚Äòi scholars argued that neither would be punished in the afterlife, as they were ahl al-fatrah, or \\"people of the interval\\" between the prophetic messages of Jesus and Muhammad. The concept of ahl al-fatrah is not universally accepted among Islamic scholars, and there is debate concerning the extent of salvation available for active practitioners of polytheism, though the majority of scholars have come to agree with it and disregard the ahadith stating that Muhammad's parents were condemned to hell. While a work attributed to Abu Hanifa, an early Sunni scholar, stated that both Aminah and Abdullah died upon their innate nature (mata 'ala al-fitra), some later authors of mawlid texts related a tradition in which Aminah and Abdullah were temporarily revived and embraced Islam. Scholars like Ibn Taymiyya stated that this was a lie, though al-Qurtubi stated that the concept did not disagree with Islamic theology. According to Ali al-Qari, the preferred view is that both the parents of Muhammad were Muslims. According to Al-Suyuti, Isma'il Haqqi, and other Islamic scholars all of the narrations indicating that the parents of Muhammad were not forgiven were later abrogated when they were brought to life and accepted Islam. Shia Muslims believe that all of Muhammad's ancestors, Aminah included, were monotheists and therefore entitled to paradise. A Shia tradition states that God forbade the fires of hell from touching either of Muhammad's parents.

Their breathing sets are the Siebe Gorman CDBA. The Subskimmer is a Diver Propulsion Vehicle which is a form of RIB (inflatable boat) with an outboard petrol (gasoline) engine. It is equipped to inflate and deflate itself as it runs. When submerged it seals its engine and runs with battery-electric thrusters, which are on a rotatable cross-arm, and is deflated. Thus it transforms between a fast light surface boat and a submerged diver propulsion vehicle. The central box contains the pump to deflate and inflate the tubes, and miscellaneous kit. The batteries, being heavy, are in a thick tube along its keel. Its outboard motor has a long snorkel so the Subskimmer can run on motor just submerged to try to avoid detection. Its thrusters are on a rotatable cross-arm which contains navigation kit. The Subskimmer project was started in the late 1970s by Submarine Products Ltd. of Hexham in Northumberland in England, the first boats being sold in their original form in 1983/84. There are 3 photographs of a working Subskimmer being demonstrated in Portsmouth, in the 15 September 1983 edition of the Daily Telegraph newspaper; the caption states its range as at underwater and at on the surface.

She then took over for Letty Lind in The Girl from Kays at the Apollo Theatre, earning good notices for her graceful, acrobatic dancing in particular. Next, she earned considerable fame playing Thisbe in the hit musical The Orchid (1903), where she danced in pink pyjamas while singing \\"The Pink Pyjama Girl\\". She continued to appear in Edwardes' productions in 1905 and 1906, including three successes at the Prince of Wales Theatre: Lady Madcap (1905, in which she performed a popular Parisian dance, \\"La Maxixe\\"), Lady Dorothy Congress in The Little Cherub (1906)Culme, John. \\"Gabrielle Ray, Lily Elsie, Zena Dare and Grace Pindar play football in The Little Cherub\\", Footlight Notes, 12 July 2008 and So-Hie in See See (1906).

She did not appear at the well-attended scheduled wedding ceremony at St Edwards Roman Catholic Church in Windsor because of Loder's failure to sign the prenuptial contract that guaranteed her financial security, but he claimed it was an oversight, and the marriage took place three days later. In 1913 Loder committed adultery and deserted Ray, ignoring her letters pleading with him to return to her. She filed for restitution of conjugal rights, but Loder did not respond to the legal order, and the couple divorced in 1914.England & Wales, Civil Divorce Records, 1858‚Äì1918: 1914, 05161-05170, 05161: Loder via Ancestry.com The broken marriage was difficult for Ray, but in 1915 she returned to the stage to play the role of Estelle in the musical Betty at the Gaiety Theatre and, in the following year, appeared in the revue Flying Colours at the London Hippodrome.

Roles during this decade included Maid Marian in Babes in the Wood at Prince's Theatre in Bradford at Christmas 1919 and Mother Goose at the Theatre Royal, Manchester, at Christmas 1920.

Three-legged crow commonly found in mythology and art. The three-legged (or tripedal) crow () is a creature found in various mythologies and arts of East Asia. It is believed by East Asian cultures to inhabit and represent the Sun. It has also been found figured on ancient coins from Lycia and Pamphylia. The earliest forms of the tripedal crow have been found in China. Evidence of the earliest bird-Sun motif or totemic articles excavated around 5000 B.C. from the lower Yangtze River delta area. This bird-Sun totem heritage was observed in later Yangshao and Longshan cultures.Chinese Prehistory The Chinese have several versions of crow and crow-Sun tales. But the most popular depiction and myth of the Sun crow is that of the Yangwu or Jinwu, the \\"golden crow\\".Yatagrarasu: The three- legged crow and its possible origins China In Chinese mythology and culture, the three-legged crow is called the sanzuwu (; Cantonese: sam1zuk1wu1; Shanghainese: sae tsoh u) and is present in many myths. It is also mentioned in the Shanhaijing. The earliest known depiction of a three- legged crow appears in Neolithic pottery of the Yangshao culture. The sanzuwu is also of the Twelve Medallions that is used in the decoration of formal imperial garments in ancient China. Sun crow in Chinese mythology Western Han silk painting funeral procession banner found in the Mawangdui Han tomb of Lady Dai (d. 168 BCE), depicting the lunar toad (top left) and the solar crow (top right). Mural from the Han dynasty (206 BC‚Äì220 AD)period found in Henan province depicting a three-legged crow. The most popular depiction and myth of a sanzuwu is that of a sun crow called the Yangwu () or more commonly referred to as the Jƒ´nw≈´ () or \\"golden crow\\". Even though it is described as a crow or raven, it is usually colored red instead of black. A silk painting from the Western Han excavated at the Mawangdui archaeological site also depicts a \\"golden crow\\" in the sun. According to folklore, there were originally ten sun crows which settled in 10 separate suns. They perched on a red mulberry tree called the Fusang (), literally meaning \\"the leaning mulberry tree\\", in the East at the foot of the Valley of the Sun. This mulberry tree was said to have many mouths opening from its branches. Each day one of the sun crows would be rostered to travel around the world on a carriage, driven by Xihe, the 'mother' of the suns. As soon as one sun crow returned, another one would set forth in its journey crossing the sky. According to Shanhaijing, the sun crows loved eating two grasses of immortality, one called the Diri (), or \\"ground sun\\", and the other the Chunsheng (), or \\"spring grow\\". The sun crows would often descend from heaven on to the earth and feast on these grasses, but Xihe did not like this; thus, she covered their eyes to prevent them from doing so. Folklore also held that, at around 2170 BC, all ten sun crows came out on the same day, causing the world to burn; Houyi, the celestial archer saved the day by shooting down all but one of the sun crows. (See Mid-Autumn Festival for variants of this legend.) Other tripedal creatures in Chinese mythology In Chinese mythology, there are other three-legged creatures besides the crow, for instance, the yu \\"a three-legged tortoise that causes malaria\\".Wolfram Eberhard (1968), The Local Cultures of South and East China, E.J. Brill, 193-195. The three-legged crow symbolizing the sun has a yin yang counterpart in the ch√°nch√∫ \\"three-legged toad\\" symbolizing the moon (along with the moon rabbit). According to an ancient tradition, this toad is the transformed Chang'e lunar deity who stole the elixir of life from her husband Houyi the archer, and fled to the moon where she was turned into a toad.Wolfram Eberhard (1986), A Dictionary of Chinese Symbols: Hidden Symbols in Chinese Life and Thought, Routledge, 292. The F√®nghu√°ng is commonly depicted as being two- legged but there are some instances in art in which it has a three-legged appearance.Feng Huang, Emperor of BirdsAncient Spiral: The Phoenix Xi Wangmu (Queen Mother of the West) is also said to have three green birds () that gathered food for her and in Han-period religious art they were depicted as having three legs.Xi Wangmu Summary In the Yongtai Tomb dating to the Tang Dynasty Era, when the Cult of Xi Wangu flourished, the birds are also shown as being three-legged.China 1999 - Tang Dynasty Day Japan Yatagarasu guides legendary Emperor Jimmu towards the plain of Yamato. In Japanese mythology, this flying creature is a raven or a jungle crow called Yatagarasu and the appearance of the great bird is construed as evidence of the will of Heaven or divine intervention in human affairs. Although Yatagarasu is mentioned in a number of places in Shint≈ç, the depictions are primarily seen on Edo wood art, dating back to the early 1800s wood-art era. Although not as celebrated today, the crow is a mark of rebirth and rejuvenation; the animal that has historically cleaned up after great battles symbolized the renaissance after such tragedy. Yatagarasu as a crow-god is a symbol specifically of guidance. This great crow was sent from heaven as a guide for legendary Emperor Jimmu on his initial journey from the region which would become Kumano to what would become Yamato, (Yoshino and then Kashihara). It is generally accepted that Yatagarasu is an incarnation of Taketsunimi no mikoto, but none of the early surviving documentary records are quite so specific. In more than one instance, Yatagarasu appears as a three legged crow not in Kojiki but in Wamy≈ç Ruijush≈ç. Both the Japan Football Association and subsequently its administered teams such as the Japan national football team use the symbol of Yatagarasu in their emblems and badges respectively.OrganisationÔΩúJFAÔΩúJapan Football Association The winner of the Emperor's Cup is also given the honor of wearing the Yatagarasu emblem the following season. Although the Yatagarasu is commonly perceived as a three-legged crow, there is in fact no mention of it being such in the original Kojiki. Consequently, it is theorised that this is a result of a later possible misinterpretation during the Heian period that the Yatagarasu and the Chinese Yangwu refer to an identical entity. Korea Three-legged crow flanked by dragon and phoenix. Mural from the Korean Goguryeo period. In Korean mythology, it is known as Samjogo (hangul: ; hanja: ). During the period of the Goguryo kingdom, the Samjok-o was considered a symbol of the sun. The ancient Goguryo people thought that a three-legged crow lived in the sun while a turtle lived in the moon. Samjok-o was a highly regarded symbol of power, thought superior to both the dragon and the Korean bonghwang. Although the Samjok-o is mainly considered the symbol of Goguryeo, it is also found in Goryeo and Joseon dynasty. Samjoko was appeared in a story , about Yeono and Seo couple, who lived on the beach of the East Sea in 157 (King Adalala 4), rode to Japan on a moving rock. The Japanese took two people to Japan as kings and noblemen. At that time, the light of the sun and the moon disappeared in Silla, and the official who looked and said that the sun and the moon were in Silla and went to Japan. King Adalala sent an official to Japan to return to the Yeono and Seo couple, but Yeono said that take the silk that made by his wife, Seo, and sacrifice it to the sky. As he said, the sun and moon were brighter again. In modern Korea, Samjok-o is still found especially in dramas such as Jumong. The three-legged crow was one of several emblems under consideration to replace the bonghwang in the Korean seal of state when its revision was considered in 2008.\\"Three-Legged Bird to Replace Phoenix on State Seal,\\" Chosun Ilbo (Seoul). January 16, 2006. The Samjok-o appears also in Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors FC's current emblem. There are some Korean companies using Samjok-o as their corporate logos.

Its website launched in 1997, and an online archive of its entire back catalog became available to subscribers in 2013. Since 1985, the magazine's annual year-in- review issue, Rewind, has named an album or release of the year based on critics' ballots. Originally, The Wire covered the British jazz scene with an emphasis on avant-garde and free jazz. It was marketed as a more adventurous alternative to its conservative competitor Jazz Journal, and targeted younger readers at a time when Melody Maker had abandoned jazz coverage. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the magazine expanded its scope until it included a broad range of musical genres under the umbrella of non-mainstream or experimental music. Since then, The Wire's coverage has included experimental rock, electronica, alternative hip hop, modern classical, free improvisation, nu jazz and traditional music. The magazine has been independently owned since 2001, when the six permanent staff members purchased the magazine from previous owner Naim Attallah. Publication history The Wire is a monthly magazine that specialises in a diverse spectrum of avant-garde and experimental music. A 1999 subscription flyer for the magazine advertised its subject matter as \\"non-mainstream\\" music. In the late 1980s and early 1990s The Wire transitioned from exclusive coverage of jazz to coverage of contemporary music in general, maintaining its prioritisation of the avant- garde. Since its founding in 1982, its monthly circulation has reportedly ranged from about 7,000 to about 20,000.; . Within the American and British music journalism markets, The Wire was among a generation of music magazines launched in the 1980s. That decade also saw the debuts of The Face (1980), Kerrang! (1981), Maximumrocknroll (1982), Mixmag (1983), Alternative Press (1985), Spin (1985), Q (1986), Hip Hop Connection (1988) and The Source (1988), among others. According to writer Simon Warner, The Wire took on a level of \\"influence disproportionate to its niche readership\\" compared to other music magazines born in the 1980s, because \\"not only listeners but music makers and producers were drawn to its columns.\\" Most of these magazines, The Wire included, differentiated themselves by targeting a narrow segment of readers based on demographics and taste. This was commonly done, for example, by devoting coverage to specific musical subcultures as Kerrang! did with heavy metal or The Source with hip hop. Another industry trend was polarization between two styles of writing: popular criticism for mass-market consumers versus intellectual criticism for underground music connoisseurs. The Wire was certainly positioned on the \\"highbrow\\" end of the industry‚Äîeven if, as editor Tony Herrington said, the magazine preferred \\"intelligence to intellectualism\\". Its embrace of high-minded, literate criticism aligned it with publications like New Statesman, a politics and culture magazine that started to publish pieces by rock journalists, and Melody Maker, which had hired a group of academically oriented new writers like Simon Reynolds who were influenced by post-structuralism. \\"The Wire\\" contrasted most sharply in approach with Q, which emphasised celebrity personalities and the classic-rock canon. The Wire was among the major British music magazines of the 1990s, a decade that represented an overall peak for the print magazine industry before the next two decades brought the rise of digital journalism and a general decline in print readership. However, The Wire has held a steady circulation and remained in print even as other magazines that once sported much larger circulations have folded or become online-only titles. NME once sold 300,000 weekly copies at its peak in the 1970s, but by 2016 it only sold 20,000‚Äîthe same number The Wire sold at that time‚Äîand in March 2018 NME ended its print edition altogether.; . The Wire was considered one of the most significant independently owned publications covering the musical underground in the 2000s, alongside Fact, Rock-A-Rolla, Dusted and innumerable blogs. 1982: Founding as a jazz magazine The Wire debuted as a quarterly jazz magazine in the summer of 1982. The magazine was co-founded by jazz promoter Anthony Wood and journalist Chrissie Murray. Lacking office space, Wood and Murray prepared the first issues of the magazine an Italian restaurant on St Martin's Lane. The staff sold copies of the first issue to concert-goers at a jazz festival in Knebworth and at the Camden Jazz Festival. At that time, Germany was considered the cultural centre of jazz in Europe‚Äîespecially European free jazz. There was greater cultural appreciation for jazz in Germany than in Britain and a greater volume of dedicated press coverage, even though the British jazz scene was actually larger than the continental scene. In an introductory essay explaining the magazine's editorial policy and scope, Wood said The Wire intended to target the demographic of listeners under the age of 25, who he felt were poorly served by the state of jazz writing in Britain. The only other British jazz magazine in print at the time was Jazz Journal, which Wood criticised for its conservative approach: \\"the reverend gentlemen at Jazz Journal continue, at best, to admit only grudgingly that jazz has got beyond 1948; at worst, deny its current development.\\" In addition, Wood noted, the British weekly magazine Melody Maker had by 1982 virtually abandoned jazz coverage. The Wire would emphasise boundary-pushing musicians; at the outset, Wood declared that free jazz and free improvisation would \\"be given a loud enough voice to be heard above the dissenters who are still questioning the music's validity.\\" The magazine was named after \\"The Wire\\", a composition by American jazz saxophonist Steve Lacy, whose \\"musical farsightedness\\" the magazine hoped to emulate. Twenty years later, Lacy's composition was used as the opening track of the box set The Wire 20 Years 1982‚Äì2002. 1983‚Äì84: Acquisition by the Namara Group In 1984, Wood sold The Wire to Naim Attallah and it became part of the Namara Group. Attallah's other properties included The Oldie, Literary Review and Quartet Books.; . Wood announced the new owner, along with a switch from quarterly to monthly publishing, in the October 1984 issue. Reflecting on the early years as part of the Namara Group, Tony Herrington said: Attallah's laissez-faire attitude and the magazine's editorial freedom contrasted with the state of other UK music magazines in the 1980s. Competition among weeklies like NME, Melody Maker and Sounds heightened in the 1980s, and these publications began to prioritise circulation, advertising and commercial appeal, which resulted in editorial constraint. The Wire did not impose significant editorial demands or stylistic revisions on its writers and, as such, it became an attractive publication for freelancers who had started their careers at UK weeklies during the post-punk era. 1985‚Äì1992: Expanding beyond jazz Former NME staffer Richard Cook took over as editor in July 1985; by September, Wood's name was gone altogether from the masthead. Around this time there was a resurgence of interest in jazz among white British \\"hipsters\\"‚Äîa trend that lasted until the 1987 \\"Black Monday\\" market crash. As editor, Cook refurbished The Wire so it would seem stylish and appealing to the new wave of British jazz hipsters, but he increasingly steered the magazine toward a pluralistic, multi-genre approach. The Wire also began to develop a house style that tended toward the philosophical and cerebral, printing \\"articles peppered with references to Gilles Deleuze and F√©lix Guattari, or Jacques Attali's monograph Noise.\\" Under Cook's editorial oversight, The Wire significantly broadened its coverage of music in genres other than jazz. He hired a new graphic design team and promoted longtime contributor Mark Sinker to assistant editor. The formerly jazz-focused magazine's covers in this period featured decidedly non-jazz artists like Michael Jackson, Prince, Philip Glass, John Lee Hooker and Van Morrison; meanwhile, articles published inside the magazine profiled a broad range of musicians, including Elvis Costello, Stravinsky, Mozart, Frank Zappa, Prokofiev, Bob Marley and Haydn. Cook told Jazz Forum in 1991 that The Wire was \\"going into overdrive\\" with ambitions to expand its domestic and international sales. Estimating the magazine's monthly circulation at 15,000‚Äì20,000 copies, Cook said he hoped to reach 25,000. But his efforts to expand the magazine's circulation had mixed results. Chris Parker, the magazine's publisher between 1984 and 1989, said the changes did not make an \\"appreciable\\" increase in sales; in Parker's view, \\"for every would-be hip young thing we recruited to the readership, we lost a diehard jazz fan who just wished to know if Howard Riley or Stan Tracey had made another album and what it was like.\\" Regardless of Cook's impact on sales figures, several of his contemporaries acknowledged that he had made The Wire a more accessible publication. Scottish writer Brian Morton said \\"[u]nder Cook's editorship, The Wire evolved from a small, coterie magazine into a more broadly based music journal that covered mainstream jazz as well as the avant-garde, but one that also began moving into other areas of music: pop, soul, reggae, classical.\\" John Fordham, the jazz critic for The Guardian, credited Cook with \\"transforming [The Wires] content and design and opening out a specialised, sometimes uninviting publication\\" to a broader audience. British-Ghanaian writer Kodwo Eshun pointed to \\"Black Science Fiction\\", an essay by Sinker from the February 1992 issue, as a major influence on Afrofuturism, a term that was coined the following year.; . 1992‚Äì1994: Mark Sinker's editorship Mark Sinker (pictured in 2014) had a brief, controversial tenure as editor of The Wire. Though he was sacked, his run as editor has received retrospective praise. In June 1992, Cook left The Wire for a position at PolyGram UK and was succeeded by Sinker. Cook's departure coincided with the magazine's 100th issue, an unannounced move that caught Sinker by surprise. Though he only served as editor for 18 months, Sinker took a bold editorial approach. During his brief tenure, few covers featured portraits of musicians, and instead often featured abstract photos of isolated objects, like a sofa or a toy robot. Sinker devoted issues to broad themes such as \\"Music and Censorship\\", \\"Music in the Realm of Bodily Desire\\" and \\"Music and the American Dream\\", and for these issues he commissioned multiple argumentative essays on those topics. In retrospect, he characterised his attitude as editor thusly: Sinker's vision‚Äîlater characterised as \\"a thorny, quizzical, fanzine cum proto-Weblog\\"‚Äîclashed with then-publisher Adele Yaron's ideal of \\"a sleek and stylish urban music 'n' lifestyle monthly\\". Yaron sacked Sinker when a potential buyer requested his removal as part of, in Sinker's words, the \\"bride price\\" for the deal. While Sinker's stint as editor was brief and controversial, music writers have praised his editorial decisions in retrospect and highlighted his influence on the magazine's future directions. The French writer-musician Rubin Steiner considered the August 1993 issue with Bj√∂rk on the cover to be a definitive turning point, signalling the start of constant changes in coverage that would follow, after which The Wire could no longer be considered a jazz magazine. The Guardian columnist Maggoty Lamb said Sinker's tenure was \\"visionary\\" and had laid the \\"foundation\\" for the magazine to become a \\"thriving institutional presence\\". At Pitchfork, Tom Ewing argued that the argumentative articles Sinker commissioned \\"weren't simply trying to shock or drive readers off‚Äîthey achieved both‚Äîbut were trying to build, as ... Sinker put it, [a place] where people could 'have fun starting arguments,' ones that could co-exist within a comfort zone.\\" 1994‚Äì1999: \\"Adventures in Modern Music\\" After Sinker was sacked, Tony Herrington took over as editor starting with the March 1994 issue. Herrington had contributed to the magazine as a freelancer since the 1980s, but he had minimal experience as an editor and had only become a permanent staffer the year prior. Yaron left shortly afterward, and so Herrington assumed the position of publisher as well. By January 1995 the magazine adopted the new subtitle \\"Adventures in Modern Music\\", which it used continuously until 2012. In the 1990s, longtime contributor Simon Reynolds (pictured in 2011) coined the genre \\"post-rock\\" and wrote influential essays on a variety of developments in rave that he termed the \\"hardcore continuum\\". Two months after Herrington became editor, the magazine published an influential piece by Simon Reynolds in which he defined the parameters of the genre \\"post-rock\\".; ; . The genre and its associated artists became a focus for the magazine in the mid to late 1990s, along with electronica and nascent subgenres like illbient and glitch. Throughout the decade, Reynolds also contributed a series of essays on post-rave trends in UK dance music, covering jungle, drum 'n' bass, hardstep, neurofunk and 2-step garage. These essays culminated in his theorizing of the \\"hardcore continuum\\": a diverse, ever-evolving tradition of electronic dance music that had diverged from American-born house and techno to become a distinctly British style.; . The magazine launched its website, , in October 1997. By 1999, the magazine reportedly reached a monthly circulation of about 20,000 copies. 2000‚Äìpresent: Staff buyout and independent ownership Rob Young became editor in March 2000. Later that year, the magazine's staff bought it from the Namara Group. When Herrington learned Naim Attallah was preparing for retirement and wanted to sell the magazine, he offered to buy it himself; Attallah replied \\"I know how much I pay you and you can't afford it.\\" Herrington consulted with his fellow staffers, secured a loan and negotiated with Attallah for about six months. The six permanent members of the staff‚ÄîHerrington, Young, Chris Bohn, Ben House, Anne Hilde Neset and Andy Tait‚Äîpurchased the company on 21 December 2000 and announced the sale in the February 2001 issue. The magazine has been independently published since then. In 2002 the magazine commemorated its 20th anniversary with a special issue, the publication of the book Undercurrents: The Hidden Wiring of Modern Music and a 3-CD box set, The Wire 20 Years 1982‚Äì2002. In the 2000s, The Wire devoted significant attention on the emerging genre of dubstep. Several noteworthy musical genres were coined or first defined in the pages of The Wire in that decade, including microhouse, by Philip Sherburne, in 2001;; . New Weird America, by David Keenan, in 2003;; . and hypnagogic pop, also by Keenan, in 2009.; . In 2007, The Wire reportedly sold about 17,500 copies per issue. A press release from the same year gave the magazine's monthly circulation as 20,000 copies, with 9,000 subscribers. In 2013, the magazine made available its entire archive‚Äîamounting to 25,000 pages at that time‚Äîto subscribers, via the site Exact Editions. Content A series of new music compilation CDs called The Wire Tapper has been given away with the magazine since 1998. The magazine has used the strapline \\"Adventures in Modern Music\\" since 1994; on 14 December 2011 The Wire's staff announced that the magazine's old strapline \\"Adventures In Modern Music\\" had been replaced by \\"Adventures In Sound And Music\\". In addition to the Wire Tapper CDs, subscribers receive label, country and festival samplers. Apart from the numerous album reviews every month, the magazine has features such as \\"The Invisible Jukebox\\", an interview conducted by way of unknown tracks being played to an artist, and \\"The Primer\\", an in-depth article on a genre or act. It also features the avant music scene of a particular city every issue. In addition to its musical focus, the magazine likes to investigate cover art and mixed media artistic works. Since January 2003 The Wire has been presenting a weekly radio programme on the London community radio station Resonance FM, which uses the magazine's strapline as its title and is hosted in turns by members of The Wire. The Wire celebrated its 400th issue in June 2017. Design and photography The Wire does not employ staff photographers. Instead, the magazine commissions all of its photography from freelancers or relies on musicians and labels to provide their own publicity photos. In recent years, the magazine has published work by photographers like Nigel Shafran, Todd Hido, Tom Hunter, Pieter Hugo, Alec Soth, Clare Shilland, Leon Chew, Jake Walters, Juan Diego Valera, Michael Schmelling, Mark Peckmezian, and Takashi Homma. The Wires first art director was Terry Coleman. Paul Elliman took over art direction in January 1986; by July, he debuted a serif-typeface logo that the magazine would continue to use, with variations, until 2001. Lucy Ward succeeded Elliman as art director in July 1988 and introduced a broader array of fonts. Under both Elliman and Ward, the minimalist aesthetic of The Wire favoured simple typography, black-and-white photography and ample white space. Elliman and Ward's late-1980s work for The Wire has been praised by their contemporaries in the graphic design field. Robert Newman‚Äîa former design director at magazines like Entertainment Weekly, New York and The Village Voice‚Äîsaid The Wires minimal design contrasted with colourful late-80s trends in both British and American magazine design. Newman said he was inspired by Elliman's designs and borrowed stylistic elements for his The Village Voice layouts. In Newman's opinion, Elliman and Ward produced \\"some of the most beautiful and remarkable magazine covers of that (or any) era, timeless designs that still look strikingly contemporary today.\\" John L. Walters, an editor and owner of the quarterly design magazine Eye said their designs did not look \\"home made or like academic papers (or both)\\", as other specialist magazines of the time tended to look, and said the magazine \\"took musicians seriously, and its design made them look good without trying‚Äîbe they stars, greying veterans or young turks.\\" John O'Reilly cited Elliman's work for The Wire among the \\"most exciting and apparently vibrant work of the 1980s\\" and said it shared a \\"kind of melancholia\\" with Neville Brody's work from the period and Vaughan Oliver's designs for the record label 4AD. A major redesign was completed in 2001 by Non-Format, a design team composed of Kjell Ekhorn and Jon Forss, who were working out of an office next to The Wire. Ekhorn and Forss were the magazine's art directors between 2001 and 2005.; . Herrington, who was familiar with their previous work designing music packaging, approached the team to redesign the magazine. In addition to designing the magazine's current logo, they designed each issue of the magazine until 2005. While they retained the magazine's overall clean, Modernist aesthetic, they incorporated highly intricate, unpredictable details into the designs of features.; At first, Ekhorn and Forss created custom layouts and typographies in nearly every issue, rather than relying on standardised templates for features; however, this became too much work, and they eventually settled on using a single style across several months at a time. Their typographic work often added elaborate variations to base fonts, which included winding, branching curlicues and interwoven illustrative elements; Karen Sottosanti described their typical design work as \\"type made of stars or flowers that exploded into negative space [and] type that merged with images of tree branches or birds.\\".; . David Jury praised Non-Format's designs, writing that the magazine \\"retained an identity all its own through its creative use of experimental headline fonts, white space and excellent photography.\\" Noteworthy examples of Non-Format's cover art include the July 2004 issue, which portrayed the composer Alvin Lucier using brainwaves he had recorded with electrodes at a concert, and the December 2004 issue \\"In Praise of the Riff\\", which placed repetitive black lines across the cover and pushed the logo to the bottom right, halfway off the page. In 2011 Complex named Non- Format's March 2005 cover with MF Doom among the 50 greatest hip-hop magazine covers. The Wire Rewind Every January since 1986, The Wire has published a year-in-review issue with a critics' poll. The staff collates ballots submitted by its contributors into a list of the year's best releases. Originally, the poll only selected the best jazz LP of the year. In 1992, the main poll grew to include albums in any musical genre, and in 2011 it began accepting releases in any format or medium, not just \\"albums\\". In addition to the main all-genre list there are typically shorter lists of the best releases within selected genres as well. These year-in-review issues have been called Rewind since 1997. Like the magazine itself, The Wires critics' polls have garnered a reputation for their unconventional, eclectic selections. (\\"[The Wires] lists do not look like any other magazines', as rather obscure music is often featured\\"). Guardian columnist Maggoty Lamb commented in 2007 that The Wire has \\"the annual best-of list most likely to single out an ensemble called Kiss the Anus of the Black Cat as having made 'one of the most interesting records of the year'.\\" When the magazine named James Ferraro's vaporwave album Far Side Virtual its 2011 Release of the Year, Eric Grandy remarked in Seattle Weekly that it was \\"[n]o surprise that willfully obscurantist British rag the Wires Best of 2011 list is topped by James Ferraro's winking Windows '97 soft- rock hellscape ... and further ranges from the Beach Boys' Smile Sessions to Laurel Halo and Hype Williams.\\" Reception Over the years, The Wire has received both praise and derision. Positive commentary about the magazine has often referred to its diverse range of coverage and unique status as a longstanding publication devoted to music outside the mainstream. In 2005 the writer Bill Martin called it an \\"invaluable resource\\" and said \\"there is no other English-language magazine today of comparable scope.\\" On the occasion of the magazine's 400th issue in 2017, Josh Baines of Noisey praised the magazine for \\"examining‚Äîin the kind of detail that puts most other publications to shame‚Äîsound and music from every conceivable angle\\" and \\"treating boundary- pushing music with diligence, care, and above all else, enthusiasm\\". The same year, designer Adrian Shaughnessy said that he regarded The Wire and the British film magazine Sight & Sound as the only two magazines that \\"remain unmissable\\"; he said both publications had \\"serious writing at their core\\", which \\"is never softened to make it 'accessible' to a wider audience,\\" and he said both were still \\"stonking good reads that have introduced me to hours of pleasure that I might otherwise have missed.\\" Unfavourable assessments of the magazine have often derided its avant-garde sensibility as pretentious, self- important and inaccessible. Gail Brennan at The Sydney Morning Herald opined in 1993 that The Wire \\"covers a surprising range of music while bringing a narrow and contrived 'punk' attitude to bear. Let's be blunt. It is a pretentious magazine.\\" In 1999, The Wire was mocked in \\"The Rock Critical List\\", an anonymous zine distributed to newspapers and magazines that ridiculed a number of music journalists, critics and editors. The writer of \\"The Rock Critical List\\" had this to say about The Wire: Others within the avant-garde music scene have also criticised The Wire. For example Ben Watson, who has contributed to The Wire himself, critiqued the magazine's editorial approach to covering noise music. In Watson's view, the magazine has had a tendency to treat noise musicians' work as \\"so worthy, alternative and dis- corporate\\" that virtually all of it must be inherently meritorious. This tendency results in an institutional reluctance to distinguish between good noise music and mere noise, along with an excess of positive, yet shallow, reviews. Rather than delving deeper into the genre's radical political dimensions, Watson argued, The Wire has instead curated its noise coverage based on superficial trends of underground fashionability; he suggested that the writing may sometimes provide \\"a clue as to how some new crew of hopeless hairy Stateside noisemaker muffins have been selected: 'Thurston says they're okay...'.\\" The magazine's writing on noise came to rely on a style of \\"descriptive objectivity\\" that studiously avoids any actual evaluation of quality; as Watson wrote, Watson also recalled bristling at Herrington's suggestion to \\"think niche\\" when writing for the magazine, which he took as an anti-universalist and commercially motivated attitude. In a 2007 interview, Herrington addressed the magazine's reputation for pondering music that he joked might \\"sound like a steamroller running over a broken fax machine\\", saying: \\"Most people would take the mickey out of some bloke making music by bowing away at the femur of a mountain goat, but we'll give them the benefit of the doubt.\\"  Live events  Books There are multiple books based on material first published in The Wire. Invisible Jukebox(1998), published by Quartet Books, collected entries from the recurring feature of the same name. For these features, an interviewer plays several pieces of music for a musician without identifying them, usually selecting tracks that the musician would be expected to know. The musician is challenged to guess the artist and title, as well as to comment on the music. Undercurrents: The Hidden Wiring of Modern Music(2002) was published by Continuum as part of the magazine's 20th anniversary; it collected a mix of new and previously published essays about important but overlooked developments in the history of modern music. The Wire Primers(2009), out on Verso, collected 19 essays that give introductions to various genres and artists. Savage Pencil Presents Trip or Squeek's Big Amplifier(2012) collected Savage Pencil cartoons from the preceding twelve years. Most recently, Epiphanies: Life-changing Encounters With Music(2015) anthologized essays from a recurring guest column about musical experiences that made a profound impact on the writer.

Early life and career Clark was born in Lebanon, Ohio, near Cincinnati, on May 24, 1811 and subsequently moved to Mississippi. He is the great grandfather of Judge Charles Clark who served on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit from 1969 to 1992 and was the chairman of the United States Judicial Conference. In the late 1830s and early 1840s, Clark, a lawyer, represented a settler in a dispute with some Choctaw Native Americans over land in the Mississippi Delta. The dispute led to a series of lawsuits before the Mississippi Supreme Court. The settler ultimately prevailed, and gave Clark a large tract of land between Beulah, Mississippi and the Mississippi River as his legal fee. In the late 1840s, Clark formed a plantation on the land, naming it Doe-Roe, pseudonyms commonly used in the legal profession to represent unnamed or unknown litigants (e.g., John Doe, Roe v. Wade). The state of literacy being what it was at the time, however, the plantation came to be known by its phonic representation, Doro. According to archives at Delta State University, \\"The plantation grew to over and became the most prosperous in the region, operating until 1913. It was prominent in the social, political and economic affairs of Bolivar County.\\"*Doro Plantation Archaeological Artifacts and Reports, Delta State University Civil War Following the secession of Mississippi in early 1861, Clark was appointed as a brigadier general in the Mississippi 1st Corps, a state militia organization that later entered the Confederate Army. He commanded the brigade at engagements in Kentucky and then a division under Leonidas Polk at the Battle of Shiloh, where he was slightly wounded. He was promoted to the rank of major general of Mississippi State Troops in 1863. Clark led a division at the Battle of Baton Rouge, where he was severely wounded and captured. He spent time as a prisoner of war before being released. On November 16, 1863, Clark was inaugurated as governor of Mississippi under Confederate auspices. He served in this capacity until June 13, 1865, when he was forcibly removed from office by occupation forces of the United States Army and replaced by William L. Sharkey, a respected judge and staunch Unionist who had been in total opposition to secession. Clark was briefly imprisoned at Fort Pulaski near Savannah, Georgia. Clarke was ex officio President of the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during his tenure as Governor of Mississippi. Despite losing the governorship, he remained on the Board for almost ten years after his term ended. In 1871, he purchased Routhland, an Antebellum mansion in Natchez, Mississippi.Steven Brooke, The Majesty of Natchez, Gretna, Louisiana: Pelican Publishing, pp. 52-53 Death He died in Bolivar County, Mississippi, on December 18, 1877, and was buried at the family graveyard in that county.

Early life and education Jane Ann \\"Nansi\\" Richards was born at Pen-y-bont-fawr, Oswestry. An expert on both the triple and pedal harps, she always maintained that the greatest influences on her life were her father Thomas Richards, the Kale (Welsh Romanies) who stayed on their farm, and Tom Lloyd (Telynor Ceiriog, 1848-1917), who taught her to play the harp. She also studied at the Guildhall School of Music in London, with harpist John Thomas. Musical career She won the National Eisteddfod harp competition three times in succession. After a year at the Guildhall School of Music, she toured with American comedian \\"Happy\\" Fanny Fields. The two young women devised tricks for Nansi to do while playing the harp, such as playing with her back turned, or playing two harps simultaneously. Nansi Richards was appointed Royal Harpist to the Prince of Wales in 1911, a title she held until her death; the role remained vacant until it was reinstated in 2000.Press release, Office of the Prince of Wales, \\"Hannah Stone Becomes New Official Harpist to HRH The Prince of Wales\\" (June 27, 2011).

Harvard-educated former banker Mikitani envisioned the site as an online shopping mall, offering the opposite of what the larger companies like IBM were trying to do with similar services, by offering empowerment to merchants rather than trying to tightly control the virtual storefront. The service was offered for a smaller fee than the larger Internet malls were charging, and merchants were given more control, such as the ability to customize their storefronts on the site.Hiroshi Mikitani, \\"E-Commerce Lessons From The Early Days Of 'Virtual Shopping Malls'\\", Fast Company, March 19, 2013.Stephanie Strom, \\"Online Overseas\\", The New York Times, June 7, 2000. 2000s The company went public through an IPO on the JASDAQ market on April 19, 2000.Phred Dvorak, \\"Japan's Highly Popular Rakuten Plans IPO Despite Shaky Market\\", The Wall Street Journal, April 18, 2000.

Map History The city of Mauguio Carnon, seventh city of the Herault department and chief town of the district, is located 11 km east of Montpellier. The altitude of the village is between 4 and 6 meters above sea level, the mont is a raised net peaking at more than 20 meters. This anomaly cannot receive any explanation from a geological point of view, because it is indeed a totally artificial relief created by the lords of the region, the Lords of Melgueil, to establish their castle. The city of Mauguio has a rich history, since in the Middle Ages, it was the first Melgueil medieval city of Lower Languedoc, where the origin of the name of its inhabitants: the Melgoriens. Mauguio is also home to one of the largest Spanish communities in France. The city covers 7500 hectares, of which nearly 2,500 are occupied by l‚ÄôEtang de l‚ÄôOr (a lagoon) and 3,500 hectares are occupied by fertile land, orchards and vineyards, as the city has expanded in the early twentieth century with viticulture. L‚ÄôEtang de l‚ÄôOr covers about 30% of the territory. This site is recognized wetland of national importance. \\"Beautiful and typical residence for birds, it has a rich fauna and a really diverse flora. With Huts Salting and many other places to discover, it is part of an exceptional natural heritage. The territory offers outstanding farmland, preserved prodigal. He plays the role of Montpellier's garden, its market gardens supplying the basin montpelli√©ran with asparagus, cantaloupes, strawberries...and many other crops. The resort of Carnon, its coastal strip and the marina, make it a popular summer tourist destination. The six miles of protected dunes and beaches are renowned for the quality of their sand and water. The marina is growing in reputation. On its banks, every night, you can participate in summer activities that extend late into the season and start in the spring. Another important asset of the city, the Montpellier-M√©diterran√©e International Airport, which result on a vast network of communication and modernity. North-east of the city, the BIA Louvade is another growing area. Many craft enterprises settled there and boost the economy.

The school was founded and permanently endowed from the shipping and banking fortune of Stephen Girard after his death in 1831. Girard College enrolls academically capable students, grades one through twelve, and awards a full scholarship with a yearly value of approximately $63,000 to every child admitted. The scholarship covers most of the costs of attending Girard, including tuition, room and board, books and school uniforms. The scholarship may be renewed yearly until the student's high school graduation. Applicants must be at least six years old (by the first day of first grade), demonstrate good social skills and the potential for scholastic achievement, and come from a single-parent, low-income (determined by HUD guidelines) family. Girard accepts students on the basis of previous school records, admissions testing, a visit and interviews. The process is conducted without preference for race, gender, religion or national origin. Girard's mission is to prepare students for advanced education and life as informed, ethical, and productive citizens through a rigorous educational program that promotes intellectual, social, and emotional growth. Stephen Girard's legacy Born in the Atlantic merchant and naval seaport city of Bordeaux, in the Kingdom of France, Stephen Girard (1750-1831), was the eldest of nine children. His mother died when he was age 11, and he left home at the age of 14 to spend the next 12 years sailing the seas and learning the international mercantile and shipping business. Girard arrived in the Delaware Bay and River port city of Philadelphia in May 1776, during the momentous summer of American Revolutionary War events at the nearby old Pennsylvania State House (now Independence Hall) and remained there for the rest of his life. During his 55 years in the \\"City of Brotherly Love,\\" he became one of the richest Americans of his time. Girard was married (at age 27) to Mary Lum, from 1777 until her death in 1815. They had no children. His initial success in business and the source of his first fortune was international shipping and merchant activities. He sent his cargo sailing ships, crews and captains around the world, trading goods and amassing a fortune. He deposited his growing wealth in the First Bank of the United States, a semi-private/public financial institution, chartered by Congress, with deposits and an official relationship with the United States Department of the Treasury and its domineering first Secretary of the Treasury, the newly appointed Alexander Hamilton, under the administration of the first President George Washington. The new First Bank of the U.S. had been recently established on behalf of private financiers, businessmen and the new central U.S. Government in the temporary national capital of Philadelphia. When the First Bank of the U.S. lost its charter two decades later in 1811, Girard bought the bank's landmark Greek Revival-styled building, left his deposited money and accounts there, and reopened as a new financial institution named the \\"Bank of Stephen Girard.\\" This made him America's first private banker. He then made his second fortune in banking. Stephen Girard used his position as banker to raise the $16 million required for the fledgling U.S. government to fight the War of 1812 against the Kingdom of Great Britain, after war was declared by the Congress at the request of fourth President James Madison in June. By the time of his death, his fortune totaled approximately $7.5 million. One of the most interesting chapters of Girard's life was his role in fighting Philadelphia's devastating yellow fever epidemic in the summer of 1793. He was instrumental in running the city's hospital at William Hamilton's home, \\"Bush Hill,\\" using his business skills to better organize the primitive hospital's health care procedures and record- keeping and becoming personally involved in the nursing of patients. With the assistance of noted attorney William J. Duane, (1780-1865), in the 1820s, he wrote a long will and testament, outlining every detail of how his fortune would be used. He delighted in keeping the document secret, knowing that everyone wondered what would happen to his fortune. Immediately after his death in 1831, the provisions of his will were made public. In addition to extensive personal and institutional bequests, he left the bulk of his fortune to the city of Philadelphia to build and operate a residential school for impoverished white orphans. This innovative social vision was considered extremely unusual both then and now: to use the Girard fortune not to endow another so-called \\"Ivy League\\" college or university but to assist children in need. In 1831, the bequest was the largest single act of philanthropy up to that time in American history. Girard's will eventually became famous for his restriction that students must be \\"poor, white, male, orphans.\\" One by one, each of those requirements has been removed. The school remained for needy white boys for over a century. From May 1954, with the U. S. Supreme Court decision in Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, there was increasing interest in making Girard College racially integrated, as the city's public schools had long been. After an extended, bitter, 14-year civil- rights struggleincluding Martin Luther King Jr.'s August 1965 address to a crowd outside Girard's front gates (\\"[Philadelphia,] the cradle of liberty, that has ... a kind of Berlin Wall to keep the colored children of God out\\") the first four black boys entered the school in September 1968. Sixteen years later, the policy of an all-male student body was also changed, and the first girls, both black and white, were admitted in 1984. Current enrollment of the Girard College in the 21st century is about evenly divided between boys and girls and about 90% African-American. The Girard Estate remains open in perpetuity. Its endowment and financial resources are held in trust by the courts of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which provides much of the school's operating budget. History Girard College was founded in 1833, three years before the establishment of the second-oldest public high school in America, the Central High School of Philadelphia, which soon became the capstone and flagship of the Philadelphia City Public Schools system and followed the first such secondary school in New England's Massachusetts, of the English High School of Boston in 1821, and six years before the third oldest such institution further south in Baltimore, Maryland, then named \\"The High School\\", (later renamed the \\"Male High School\\", then the \\"Central High School of Baltimore\\" when two female public high schools were established), and later The Baltimore City College, which is its title today, both are ensconced in landmark distinctive structures and are of the modern \\"magnet school\\" type, with college prep/academic curricula, strict admission standards, with noted faculty and famous alumni with respected roles in their cities and states, similar to Girard's historic role in Philadelphia along with later Central High and Girls' High. The buildings and classrooms for Girard took some time to design and construct with their expensive \\"Greek Revival\\" stone architecture, but were ready and opened on January 1, 1848, under provisions of Girard's will supervised by the appointed trustees, including banker and financier Nicholas Biddle, (1786-1844). His vision as a school for poor, white, orphaned boys was unique in educating an entirely unserved population. Girard saw a chance to educate boys who might never reach their potential and to prepare them for useful, productive lives. Girard's vision for the school can best be understood in the context of early 19th Century Philadelphia. The city was then at the forefront of creating innovative American institutions designed to solve a specific social challenge, such as the newly founded and constructed Eastern State Penitentiary (humane incarceration), the Pennsylvania Hospital (mental illness), the Pennsylvania Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb (disabilities), and the Franklin Institute (scientific knowledge). Girard chose to dedicate his immense fortune to help educate young men of Philadelphia as Americans for the future. The specific term \\"orphan\\" appears in the will, and Girard specified \\"poor, white, male\\" orphans. However, in 1831, a mother who became a widow had no rights and resources, and \\"guardians\\" were often appointed by the \\"Probate\\" or \\"Orphan courts\\" of the city and state. In reality, Girard operated as a school for boys who were fatherless rather than children with no living parents or guardians. (The College in the 19th Century determined the legal definition of the term \\"orphan\\" was \\"a fatherless child.\\") As the 20th Century progressed and women achieved full and equal rights and status including the right to vote, the descriptive term \\"orphans\\" became outmoded and deemed erroneous as a term of modern reference for Girard students. Not part of the School District of Philadelphia, which had long been racially integrated (as being in a northern, formerly \\"free state\\"), Girard College was still considered \\"private\\" even though it had a very public educational mission, and was racially segregated long before the consideration of the \\"Brown v. Board of Education\\" legal case. Girard College was ordered to desegregate by the U.S. Supreme Court's 1954 unanimous decision. Perhaps the key to the ruling was that Girard, following its founder's will, was administered by the \\"Board of Directors of City Trusts,\\" and that public institution could not continue to maintain the historically out-dated entrance requirement. For fourteen years, the legal battle to desegregate Girard College continued. Cecil B. Moore and the Philadelphia Freedom Fighters marched around the wall encompassing the campus for seven months in 1965. Stanley Branche and seven other members of the Black Coalition Movement were arrested when they attempted to scale the walls. A highlight of these protests came on August 2 of that year when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. came to the front gates of Girard's campus and addressed the protesters. The first four African-American male students were finally admitted on September 11, 1968. The first female student was admitted as a first grader in 1984, following more adjustments to the admission criteria, so that the death of a father was no longer required. Girls were gradually integrated into the College over a 12-year enrollment period with subsequent new female students only permitted to enroll in the same graduating class as the first female student or a younger class. The first young women graduated with a Girard diploma in 1993. Girard's first female valedictorian was Kimberly Green. The graduating Class of 1996 was the first class to graduate with more female students than males, although it remains more or less balanced from year to year. The College made history in May 2009, when it named Autumn Adkins as its 16th president, the first female chief administrator in its (then) 160-year existence. Adkins, now Autumn Adkins Graves, was not only the first woman but also the first African- American to head the College. Adkins resigned in 2012. Following Adkins, Clarence D. Armbrister, was the first African-American man to serve in this role. The school's current President is Heather Wathington. Program All students live in single-sex dormitories arranged by grade level. Residential advisers occupy apartments in the dorm buildings. Girard requires that all students participate in the five-day program for the full benefit of its academic and residential curricula. All students go home on weekends. Girard is open to students of all religious backgrounds. Once a month at the beginning of the school day, however, all students attend a non-denominational assembly in the school's Chapel, offering a continuing forum for spiritual and moral development. Entering 2016, student enrollment at Girard is projected to be 311; of these, 122 are Elementary School students (grades 1 to 5) and 89 are Middle Schoolers and 100 will attend the High School (grades 9 to 12). Girard employs 127 faculty members; of which 71 are academic teachers and 56 are residential advisers. Class sizes range between 12 and 20 students in the elementary school and 16-22 students in the middle school. In the high school, honors classes have 15 students, and regular classes - 20 to 25 students. Girard's performance-based curriculum is in accordance with national standards. All grade levels and subject areas have specific benchmarks and content standards that measure successful student outcomes and achievements. Girard is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. It also holds membership in the National Association of Independent Schools, the Association of Boarding Schools, and the Coalition for Residential Education. Virtually all of Girard's graduates are accepted into accredited colleges and universities with approximately 95% continuing to higher-education institutions, a percentage far higher than most public high schools in the School District of Philadelphia. Founder's Hall Founder's Hall at Girard College (1833‚Äì1847) is considered one of the finest examples of American Greek Revival architecture, for which it is designated a National Historic Landmark. School founder Girard specified in his will the dimensions and plan of the building. Nicholas Biddle (1786‚Äì1844) was chairman of the School's building committee, banker and financier and president of the later revived and reorganized Second Bank of the United States in Philadelphia. Girard's will demanded an architectural competition for the school's design. Endowed with his $2-million contribution, the 1832 competition was the first American architectural competition to have truly national participation.Bruce Laverty, Michael J. Lewis, and Michelle Taillon Taylor, Monument to Philanthropy: The Design and Building of Girard College, 1832-1848 (Philadelphia: Girard College, 1998) The winning architect was Thomas Ustick Walter (1804‚Äì1887). After the Girard commission, Walter designed the dome of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. He returned to Philadelphia and became an assistant architect on the City Hall and, in 1857, a founding member of the American Institute of Architects (AIA). Founder's Hall was the school's original classroom building. It has three main floors, each measuring . The plan for each floor, according to Stephen Girard's specifications, consists of a front hall, four 50 ft. square rooms with 25 ft. ceilings arranged two-by- two, and a back hall that is the same size as the front hall. The scale of the spaces was impressively large when the building first opened. Resulting from his association with architect Walter, Nicholas Biddle hired him in 1834 to convert the Biddle country seat, Andalusia, in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, from a large Pennsylvania farmhouse into an exemplary domestic Greek-Revival structure.

The iron ore that originates on these lines is transloaded to ships at Two Harbors, Minnesota, then sent by ship to Conneaut, Ohio, where it is again transloaded to B&LE; trains. It is then taken down to steel mills in the Pittsburgh region, mainly to the blast furnaces at US Steel's Edgar Thomson Plant in Braddock, Pennsylvania, part of the Mon Valley Works. As of Fall 2018, the active locomotives on B&LE; are former Illinois Central SD70's, 1028 & 1022, CN 5422 (SD60), 5291, 5346( SD40-2Ws), and B&LE; 867, 868(SD38AC), 905 (SD40T-3). History The Pittsburgh, Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad Company was founded in 1897 by Andrew Carnegie to haul iron ore and other products from the port at Conneaut, Ohio on the Great Lakes to Carnegie Steel Company plants in Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. On the return trip, Pennsylvania coal was hauled north to Conneaut Harbor. The company was created largely out of a series of small predecessor companies including the Pittsburgh, Shenango and Lake Erie Railroad, and the Butler and Pittsburgh Railroad Company. The company was renamed the Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad in 1900. Carnegie Steel had an exclusive 99-year lease to the PS&LE.; This lease was acquired by US Steel when that company acquired Carnegie Steel in 1901. At the end of 1925 B&LE; operated 228 miles of road on 631 miles of track; at the end of 1970 mileages were 220 and 489. In 1988 the Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad became part of Transtar, Inc., a privately held transportation holding company with principal operations in railroad freight transportation, dock operations, Great Lakes shipping, and inland river barging that were formerly subsidiaries of USX, the holding company that owns U.S. Steel. In 2001 the Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad became part of Great Lakes Transportation, LLC. On May 10, 2004 Canadian National Railway acquired the Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad. Iron ore and coal are still the route's major freight commodities. Route notes B&LE; logo on a hopper at Cedar Rapids, Iowa The B&LE; connects with the Norfolk Southern Railway at Wallace Junction, near Girard, Pennsylvania, and at the Shenango Yard in Greenville, Pennsylvania. The Union Railroad connects at the B&LE;'s southern terminus at Penn Hills' North Bessemer Yard. CSX (formerly the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad) connects at Shenango Yard (the Pennsylvania Railroad may have connected here, too), and the Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad connects at Calvin Yard in Butler, Pennsylvania. The B&LE; formerly interchanged at Osgood, Pennsylvania with the New York Central System, later Penn Central Railroad and then Conrail, until the latter abandoned the line in 1988. The main rail yard and locomotive and car shops are in Greenville, Pennsylvania. Although the B&LE; acquired some early diesel-electric switching locomotives painted black with yellow trim, in 1950 the company adopted a locomotive color scheme of bright orange and black which is still in use. Because the B&LE;'s primary traffic is iron ore, it adopted rust-colored hoppers so the ore wouldn't produce noticeable stains on its cars. B&LE; 1593 The B&LE; carried passengers many years ago, and indeed kept a spur line from its main line east to Conneaut Lake Park amusement park for dropping off and picking up excursionists visiting the park. The B&LE; main line divides around Greenville, between a waypoint north of the Village of Osgood called 'KO' and another waypoint near the Village of Kremis that used the telegraph call name 'KY', for the \\"Osgood- Kremis\\" cut-off (\\"K-O\\") that joined the original \\"Old Line\\" there. The latter still winds down along the Little Shenango and Shenango Rivers into downtown Greenville (where the B&LE; shops are located), and then climbs back up to Kremis, en route to Fredonia and North Bessemer. The B&LE; constructed the shortcut K-O Line in 1901-02 to bypass the steep, winding route through Greenville. From 'KO Junction', it runs south over a long () viaduct above the Little Shenango River, the original B&LE; Old Line, the former NYC RR's JF&C; Branch and the former Erie RR's Chicago‚ÄîNew York main line at Osgood. It then passes east of downtown Greenville at a relatively high elevation, and rejoins the original line at KY, near Kremis. The K-O Line cut-off shortened KO to KY run by 3.1 miles vs. the Old Line. Except for the Osgood Viaduct, this cut-off was double-tracked for many years but, since the arrival of CTC signaling in the Fifties, is now entirely single track.Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad (2009) Kenneth C. Springirth Fonthill Media The B&LE; operated a line from Queen Junction (near Butler, PA) to Brady's Bend, PA. It was known as the Western Allegheny Division, and it was known as the last line that the B&LE;'s F-Units ran on. F-unit service on the line ended in 1992, and the last train, which was pulled by EMD SD-9 ran in November of 1994. The line sat out of service until 2000, when it was abandoned. The tracks were removed in 2002, and today, the right of way is barely visible. There was originally one tunnel on the B&LE; mainline at Culmerville, but it was dug out or \\"daylighted\\" in 1922, converting it to an open cut through a hill. As it approaches Bessemer, the B&LE; is also noticeable where it crosses the Allegheny River on the Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad Bridge immediately east of and parallel to the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Locomotives Bessemer & Lake Erie SD38AC #869.

The grade began at 0.9% climb, then pitched up to 1% for much of the next 13 miles (21 km).\\" The B&LE; also had a number of switchers, including 0-6-0s and 0-8-0s. The road dieselized in 1953. In the diesel era, B&LE;'s motive power has always been mostly Electro- Motive Division. It dieselized with many EMD F-units, which were supplemented by SD9s, SD18s and ALCo RSD15s. Later, it bought a number of EMD SD38ACs and SD38-2s to replace the F-units. In the late 1990s, it bought many EMD SD40T-3 \\"Tunnel Motors\\" from Southern Pacific Railroad to replace the 1950s-vintage SD9s.

As a generalization, a value judgment can refer to a judgment based upon a particular set of values or on a particular value system. A related meaning of value judgment is an expedient evaluation based upon limited information at hand, an evaluation undertaken because a decision must be made on short notice. Explanation The term value judgment can be used objectively to refer to any injunction that implies an obligation to carry out an act, implicitly involving the terms \\"ought\\" or \\"should\\". It can be used either in a positive sense, signifying that a judgment must be made taking a value system into account, or in a disparaging sense, signifying a judgment made by personal whim rather than objective thought or evidence. In its positive sense, a recommendation to make a value judgment is an admonition to consider carefully, to avoid whim and impetuousness, and search for consonance with one's deeper convictions, and to search for an objective, verifiable, public, and consensual set of evidence for the opinion. In its disparaging sense the term value judgment implies a conclusion is insular, one-sided, and not objective ‚Äî contrasting with judgments based upon deliberation, balance and public evidence. Value judgment also can refer to a tentative judgment based on a considered appraisal of the information at hand, taken to be incomplete and evolving‚Äîfor example, a value judgment on whether to launch a military attack, or as to procedure in a medical emergency. In this case the quality of judgment suffers because the information available is incomplete as a result of exigency, rather than as a result of cultural or personal limitations. Most commonly the term value judgment refers to an individual's opinion. Of course, the individual's opinion is formed to a degree by their belief system, and the culture to which they belong. So a natural extension of the term value judgment is to include declarations seen one way from one value system, but may be seen differently from another. Conceptually this extension of definition is related both to the anthropological axiom \\"cultural relativism\\" (that is, that cultural meaning derives from a context) and to the term \\"moral relativism\\" (that is, that moral and ethical propositions are not universal truths, but stem from cultural context). A value judgment formed within a specific value system may be parochial, and may be subject to dispute in a wider audience. Value- neutral Value-neutral is a related adjective suggesting independence from a value system. The object itself is considered value-neutral when it is neither good nor bad, neither useful nor useless, neither significant nor trite, until placed in some social context. For example, the classification of an object sometimes depends upon context: Whether or not an object is a tool or a weapon, or if human remains are an artifact or an ancestor. A famous quote from mathematician G.H. Hardy indicates how he places the \\"value-neutral\\" subject of mathematics into a particular social context: \\"A science is said to be useful if its development tends to accentuate the existing inequalities of wealth, or more directly promotes the destruction of human life\\". For a discussion of whether technology is value neutral, see Martin and Schinzinger, and Wallace. An item may have value and be value-neutral regardless of social context if its utility or importance is more-or-less self-evident, for example, oxygen supports life in all societies. Value judgements and their context Some argue that true objectivity is impossible, that even the most rigorous rational analysis is founded on the set of values accepted in the course of analysis. Consequently, all conclusions are necessarily value judgments (and therefore may be parochial). Of course, putting all conclusions in one category does nothing to distinguish between them, and is therefore a useless descriptor. Categorizing a conclusion as a value judgment takes substance when the context framing the judgment is specified. As an example, scientific \\"truths\\" are considered objective, but are held tentatively, with the understanding that more careful evidence and/or wider experience might change matters. Further, a scientific view (in the sense of a conclusion based upon a value system) is a value judgment that is socially constructed based upon rigorous evaluation and wide consensus. With this example in mind, characterizing a view as a value judgment is vague without description of the context surrounding it. However, as noted in the first segment of this article, in common usage the term value judgment has a much simpler meaning with context simply implied, not specified.

Traditional pack animals are diverse including camels, goats, yaks, reindeer, water buffaloes, and llamas as well as the more familiar pack animals like dogs, horses, donkeys, and mules. Pack versus draft The term pack animal is traditionally used in contrast to draft animal, which is a working animal that typically pulls a load behind itself (such as a plow, a cart, a sled or a heavy log) rather than carrying cargo directly on its back. For instance, sled dogs pull loads but do not normally carry them, while working elephants have been used for centuries to haul logs out of forests. Diversity Traditional pack animals include ungulates such as camels, the domestic yak, reindeer, goats, water buffaloes and llama, and domesticated members of the horse family including horses, donkeys, and mules. Occasionally, dogs can be used to carry small loads.

Bridgeport, California, 2014 Hauling of goods in wagons with horses and oxen gradually displaced the use of packhorses, which had been important until the Middle Ages, by the sixteenth century. Pack animals may be fitted with pack saddles and may also carry saddlebags. While traditional usage of pack animals by nomadic tribespeople is declining, a new market is growing in the tourist expeditions industry in regions such as the High Atlas mountains of Morocco, allowing visitors the comfort of backpacking with animals. The use of pack animals \\"is considered a valid means of viewing and experiencing\\" some National Parks in America, subject to guidelines and closed areas. In the 21st century, special forces have received guidance on the use of horses, mules, llamas, camels, dogs, and elephants as pack animals. Load carrying capacity The maximum load for a camel is roughly 300 kg. Yaks are loaded differently according to region. In Sichuan, is carried for 30 km in 6 hours. In Qinghai, at 4100 m altitude, packs of up to are routinely carried, while up to is carried by the heaviest steers for short periods. Llamas can carry roughly a quarter of their body weight, so an adult male of can carry some . Loads for equids are disputed.

Born in Paris, France, Albert Guillaume became a leading caricaturist during the Belle √âpoque. While remembered for his poster art, Guillaume also did oil paintings such as \\"Soir√©e parisienne,\\" a portrait of Parisian dinner society. He created theater posters as well as advertising posters that were greatly influenced by the work of one of the preeminent poster painters, Jules Ch√©ret.  Poster art  Guillaume thrived during the international poster mania of the Gay Nineties. During this period, a collection of notable artists helped transform the boulevards of Paris into a gallery of fine art. Toulouse-Lautrec set the stage in 1891 with his famous poster, Moulin Rouge. Other fine art posters followed and the streets came alive with color. Posters soon appeared from many of the era's great masters. Artists such as Ch√©ret, Livemont, Hermann-Paul and Mucha helped shape the Parisian landscape. Jules Ch√©ret is often called the \\"father of the modern poster.\\" From 1895 until 1900, he collaborated with the era's great poster artists to produce a series of smaller works suitable for collectors. For six years, Ch√©ret and his collaborators painstakingly reproduced four posters a month. The series was a smashing success. The \\"Masters of Posters\\" collection included many works by Guillaume and it was through this series that he became known to a wider audience. The collection remains popular to this day.  Caricature  Guillaume is also known for satirical drawings that were published in Parisian humor magazines such as Gil Blas, Le Rire, L‚ÄôAssiette au Beurre, and Le Figaro illustr√©. These magazines appeared as Parisians started to acquire an increased appetite for arts, culture and politics. Guillaume lampooned the foibles of French society at a time when French governance was frequently characterized by corruption and mismanagement.  Recognition  The winner of a bronze medal at the Universal Exhibition of 1900 in Paris, Guillaume had many of his illustrations published in albums by such firms as \\"Ernest Maindron\\" and \\"Librairie illustr√©e, J. Tallandier\\" including three albums of military cartoons with the preface for the 1896 edition written by Georges Courteline.  Death  Albert Guillaume died during the occupation in the rural village of Faux in the Dordogne d√©partement of France in 1942.

Rock (SS-274) was laid down by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Co., Manitowoc, Wisc., 23 December 1942; launched 20 June 1943; sponsored by Mrs. B. O. Wells, and commissioned 26 October 1943, Comdr. John Jay Flachsenhar in command. After a month of intensive training in Lake Michigan, Rock passed through the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal (at the time known as the Chicago Drainage Canal) to Lockport, Ill. There she entered a floating drydock for her voyage down the Mississippi River. She arrived in New Orleans on 29 November 1943, and got underway 6 days later for Panama, where she received further training before sailing for Pearl Harbor on 2 January 1944. Following voyage repairs Rock departed from Pearl Harbor for her first war patrol on 8 February 1944. First and second war patrols, February ‚Äì May 1944 On 29 February 1944, Rock contacted a large enemy convoy en route to Truk. Detected by destroyer Asashimo while making a night surface approach on the convoy, she fired a spread of four torpedoes from her stern tubes at the closing enemy destroyer without scoring. Then illuminated by the destroyer's searchlight, and under fire from the surface ship's guns, she dived. For 4 hours she underwent depth charge attacks, but survived. That night she surfaced and found that her periscopes were excessively damaged and that her bridge had been riddled with shrapnel. The damage necessitated a return to Pearl Harbor for repairs. Later that night, the busy Asashimo sank . Rock began her second war patrol on 4 April 1944, destination Honsh≈´. However, after 34 days in the Bungo Suido and Sagami Wan area without action, she returned to Majuro where she was refitted by . Third war patrol, June ‚Äì August 1944 Rock, in company with and , departed Majuro on 22 June 1944, in a coordinated attack group to patrol the Luzon Strait. At dawn on 19 July Rock attacked a Japanese convoy of seven large ships and three escorts, firing 10 torpedoes, six of which exploded. But, as she immediately dove to escape a depth-charge attack, she could not observe their effect. Two days later Rock contacted another enemy convoy consisting of six large ships and four escorts. She launched four torpedoes, two of which seemed to hit but, again Rock was forced down by depth charges and unable to assess damage to her targets. During the remainder of her time on station, Rock weathered a severe typhoon and witnessed the sinking of Japanese submarine I-29 by Sawfish. On 27 July she headed toward Pearl Harbor. Fourth war patrol, September ‚Äì November 1944 Rock departed Pearl Harbor on 9 September 1944, en route for the South China Sea for her fourth patrol. On 26 October 1944, she scored three hits on a tanker, Rock's only sinking, Takasago Maru No. 7, accompanied by three escorts. On 27 October 1944, she fired nine torpedoes at , stranded on Bombay Shoal, to prevent her salvage by the Japanese. Three of the torpedoes were hits. This patrol ended when Rock departed the area and sailed for Fremantle, Western Australia, for refit. Fifth and sixth war patrols, December 1944 ‚Äì May 1945 On 14 December 1944, Rock departed Fremantle on her fifth patrol. The only event of note during this 64-day patrol was the rescuing of a downed pilot from . At the start of her sixth patrol, 7 March to 4 May 1945 she picked up 15 merchant seamen from the , adrift in a life raft for 32 days, and landed them at Exmouth. Continuing northward the next day, Rock was bombed by an aircraft and that night she was struck by a dud torpedo. Neither attack caused any critical damage. In a night attack on 27 March, Rock fired on an enemy destroyer escort without success. On 18 April she joined in bombarding Batan Island to leave the Japanese radio station in ruins. Rock then turned toward Saipan to complete a 54-day patrol. From the Marianas the submarine headed for the United States, arriving at Hunter's Point, San Francisco, 14 May for overhaul. She sailed for Pearl Harbor 7 August 1945, but with the cessation of hostilities was ordered east. Officially credited with damaging 42,282 tons of enemy shipping during her six war patrols, Rock participated in Navy Day celebrations at New Orleans, then proceeded to New London where she began inactivation in November 1945. She was decommissioned 1 May 1946 and was berthed as a unit of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Radar picket submarine (SSR-274), 1953‚Äì1959 In early 1951 Rock was towed from New London to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, where she was converted to a radar picket submarine by bisecting her at the forward bulkhead of the control room and inserting a section between the control room and the forward battery to house the new CIC and the majority of her new electronic equipment. Reclassified SSR-274 on 18 July 1952, Rock recommissioned at Philadelphia 12 October 1953. After a short period of training with SubRon 6 off the Virginia Capes, she proceeded to San Diego to join SubRon 5. On 23 July 1954, she departed San Diego for the western Pacific area and a 6-month tour on the Taiwan Strait Patrol. She subsequently alternated deployments to WestPac with operations off the Pacific coast. She made 6-month deployments to WestPac in 1956 and during the winter of 1958‚Äì1959. Auxiliary general submarine (AGSS-274), 1959‚Äì1969 On 31 December 1959 there no longer existed an operational requirement for a radar picket submarine in the Fleet, and on that date the Air Control Center was decommissioned and Rock was redesignated \\"auxiliary general submarine\\" AGSS-274. Following operations off the Pacific coast and another overhaul, Rock again deployed to WestPac in November 1961. She made subsequent 6-month deployments to WestPac in 1963, 1965, 1966‚Äì1967, and 1968. Operating in the eastern Pacific during the first half of 1969, Rock departed San Diego 11 July and conducted operations in support of fleet training in the Hawaiian operating areas until steaming 16 August for the Pacific coast. Less than a month later, on 13 September 1969, Rock decommissioned at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. Struck from the Navy List on the same day, she was designated for use as a target to destruction. Rock earned four battle stars for World War II service.

It was the successor of Scribner's Monthly Magazine and ceased publication in 1930. History In 1921, The Cambridge History of English and American Literature summarized the early history of the magazine: The magazine was very successful during the 19th century, most notably for the aforementioned series of articles about the American Civil War, which ran for three years during the 1880s. It included reminiscences of 230 participants from all ranks of the service on both sides of the conflict. According to an author writing in the New York Times, the publication of The Century \\"made New-York, instead of London, the centre of the illustrated periodicals published in the English language‚Ä¶\\" The magazine was also a notable publisher of fiction, presenting excerpts of Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn in 1884 and 1885 and Henry James' The Bostonians. Upon Gilder‚Äôs death in 1909, Robert Underwood Johnson replaced him as editor. According to Arthur John, the magazine‚Äôs \\"later history was marked by sudden shifts in content, format, and editorial direction.\\" Glenn Frank was editor from 1921 to 1925, a period during which The Century was known for its editorials on current events and began to cut back on illustrations, which were completely eliminated after Frank left the magazine. In 1929, due to competition from cheaper magazines and newspapers, The Century became a quarterly, and in 1930 it was merged with The Forum. At the time it folded, The Century had 20,000 subscribers, less than a tenth of its peak circulation of the late nineteenth century. Scribner‚Äôs Monthly Magazine, the periodical that became The Century in 1881, should not be confused with the Scribner‚Äôs Magazine that began publication in 1887. The noted critic and editor Frank Crowninshield briefly served as the magazine's art editor.  Philosophy and political positions  The tone and content of The Century changed over its long history. It began as an Evangelical Christian publication, but over time began to speak to a more general educated audience as it developed into the largest periodical in the country. Religion Novelist and poet Josiah G. Holland was one of the three original founders of Scribner‚Äôs Monthly and wrote regular editorials for the periodical, setting the tone for the magazine's content. As Holland was deeply religious, Scribner's to a great extent reflected the views and concerns of the Evangelical Christian community. While hostile towards sectarianism within Protestantism, Scribner's initially took a strong stand against both Catholicism and those who doubted the divinity of Christ. In the first issue, under the heading \\"Papa and the Dogma,\\" Holland claimed that it was freedom that made the Protestant nations of Europe strong while their Catholic neighbors were, as a result of their religion, in a state of decay. Less than one year later, the magazine attacked the skepticism of Henry David Thoreau. Mormon polygamy was also a frequent target. One contributor traveled to Utah to observe the Mormon settlement there and argued that the new sect would have to end its practice of plural marriage if it was to survive and American control could be exercised over the western territories. At the same time, Scribner‚Äôs Monthly, being non-dogmatic in its Protestantism, expressed little hostility towards modern science. For example, a three-part series discussed how believing Christians should meet the intellectual challenges of religious skepticism, and in 1874 two writers engaged one another in a debate over whether Christians should attempt to prove the divinity of Christ through science. By the end of the 1870s, however, Scribner‚Äôs had departed from its original Evangelical orientation. An April 1879 editorial declared all seekers of truth, whether believing Christians or not, to be allies, regarding this new view as simply an application of the Golden Rule. Catholics were said to have just as much to teach Protestants as Protestants had to teach Catholics. After the magazine became The Century in 1881, it continued to hold onto this secular outlook under Gilder. The break with the past was reflected in the magazine‚Äôs changing treatment of the question of evolution. In 1875, Scribner‚Äôs argued that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that Darwinism was true and attributed its wide acceptance to a contemporary bias towards novel ideas, even though the author did not on principle reject the idea that proof could be forthcoming. Upon the death of Charles Darwin in 1883, however, The Century published a laudatory tribute to the scientist written by Alfred Wallace. The magazine remained secular into its later days, in 1923 criticizing the \\"poisonous dogmatism\\" of the thought of William Jennings Bryan and what the magazine saw as his religious fundamentalism. Over the years, The Century would publish works by a large number of writers who were agnostics or atheists, including famous skeptic Bertrand Russell. American nationalism From the very beginning of his tenure as editor in 1881 to his death in 1909, The Century reflected the ideals of Gilder. He sought to create and help shape a \\"refined\\" American high culture, often contributing his own poetry to that end. Everything from its historical memoirs to political commentary reflected the influence of nineteenth century romanticism. An unsigned May 1885 editorial expressed pride over the belief of the staff that the periodical had achieved wide circulation while remaining a quality product. This reflected the view that as a general matter there was usually a tradeoff between quality and quantity. The Century was generally seen as a conservative magazine and hoped to promote reconciliation between the North and South after the trauma of the Civil War. According to J. Arthur Bond, the magazine was instrumental in creating and shaping post-war American nationalism. In the words of one contemporary, Gilder‚Äôs \\"spirited and tireless endeavor [ ] was to give the organic life of the American people purity of character and nobility of expression.\\" During his tenure as editor, he promoted patriotism and the glorification of American historical figures. Seeing itself as having an \\"elevating\\" mission, its \\"mixture of nationalism and cultural advocacy informed even the most ‚Äòordinary‚Äô of the magazine's articles.\\" Often touching on many of these themes, Theodore Roosevelt wrote as a regular contributor to the magazine over three decades, a span which included one article he published while serving as President. Gilder developed relationships with several contemporary prominent figures, including a close friendship with Grover Cleveland which he wrote about upon the death of the former president. It has been argued that the decline in the popularity of the magazine from the 1890s on was connected to the general triumph of more egalitarian ideologies and the collapse of nineteenth century romanticism and idealism. Concerns over national unity and the preservation of traditional American culture were reflected in the magazine‚Äôs writings on immigration. An 1884 article discussed the composition and geographical distribution of immigrant populations, and expressed optimism over the prospect of the newer Americans assimilating into the larger population. At the same time, the article warned that measures should be taken against potential threats to national unity through fractionalization. As immigration increased over the next few decades, however, The Century became more alarmed over its effects on the future of the country, citing concerns over, among other matters, crime, illiteracy, and the overpopulation of cities. In 1904, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge took to the pages of the magazine to argue for the importance of keeping out \\"undesirable\\" immigrants. Twenty years later, editor Glenn Frank attacked the Ku Klux Klan and other nativists, but nonetheless wrote that \\"[t]he hour for very severe restrictions on immigration has come‚Ä¶\\" The same author returned to some of the same themes when he again attacked the KKK several months later for both its religious and racial doctrines. Reconstruction and civil rights In the immediate post-Reconstruction era, contributors to The Century debated what should be done about the postwar South and the newly free slaves, generally advocating for amicable relations between the regions and national unity. In 1873 and 1874, Scribner‚Äôs ran a number of articles under the title \\"The Great South,\\" a series which lasted fourteen issues. Based on Edward King‚Äôs travels, the author‚Äôs accounts generally portrayed the region in a sympathetic light and the series was warmly received by Southerners. In 1876, Scribner‚Äôs published a eulogy to Robert E. Lee, along with an editorial postscript praising the spirit of \\"sectional friendliness\\" of the piece. On the question of the freedmen, a wide variety of contemporary views were represented. Writing for Scribner‚Äôs in 1874, one author argued that blacks were unfit to be schooled with white children. On the other hand, an 1885 article by George W. Cable despaired over what he saw as the failure to protect the rights of southern blacks after the Civil War and argued that this was the result of the former confederate states evading federal law. Henry W. Grady, responding a few months later, disputed the earlier author‚Äôs characterization of the situation, claiming that while legal rights had been granted, southern whites would never accept social integration between the races. Cable‚Äôs criticisms of the ex-Confederacy also drew a rebuke by Robert Lewis Dabney. Even when sympathetic to the cause of the newly freed slaves, writers who argued for helping them usually did so on paternalistic grounds. Bishop T. U. Dudley, for example, expressed doubt that much could be done to elevate the status of American blacks, but argued that Christian principles required helping them to the greatest extent possible. The question of how much government policy could do to improve the circumstances of the former slaves continued to be debated over the decades. By the turn of the century, the debates would be conducted in the language of science. Robert Bennett Bean, a medical doctor, published a 1906 article arguing that social policy should be based on realistic assessments of the relative mental capacities of blacks and whites. He claimed that blacks had, on average, smaller brains than Asians or Caucasians, a finding he attributed to heredity. Similarly, Charles Francis Adams spent two years in Egypt and the Sudan and referenced his experiences to argue in 1906 that the unfortunate circumstances of American blacks were mainly due to inherently low capabilities rather than history. In the same issue, however, the editors felt it necessary to mention the dissenting view of Franz Boas, who had painted a more optimistic picture of the potential of Africans in a different periodical two years earlier. Booker T. Washington contributed four articles to the magazine in the first decade of the twentieth century, including one on \\"Heroes in Black Skins.\\" and another that discussed efforts of blacks to become homeowners. A 1903 editorial sang the praises of Washington, calling him the \\"Moses of his people\\" and contrasting him favorably with W.E.B. Du Bois. Reflecting the magazine‚Äôs later shift leftward, Du Bois himself contributed an article to The Century in 1923. Several editorials around that time criticized the revived Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s. Frank Tannenbaum, for example, wrote that the Klan of the Reconstruction era \\"was a reflex of the vindictiveness of Northern politicians and of the unscrupulous carpet-baggers who swooped down upon the South as a vulture upon a wounded and stricken victim.\\" But the contemporary Klan, according to Tannenbaum, had no such justification and simply reflected fears of change and other pathologies of segments of the white population. Progressive causes The magazine championed several Progressive causes popular in its time. Among these were several civil service reforms including competitive examinations for public offices, which its writers saw as a way to promote good governance and reduce class privilege. Similarly, in 1894 Henry Cabot Lodge attacked the \\"un-American\\" practice of patronage. The Century also took up some of the environmental causes of its day, expressing satisfaction over the first attempts by the federal government to preserve the nation's forests, and in its later days supported women's suffrage. Finally, the magazine occasionally published articles in favor of eugenics. Frank, for example, while disparaging the racism of the KKK, encouraged what he called the better individuals of every race to use the tools of modern science to focus on improving the genetic quality of all populations. Socialism and the labor movement Scribner‚Äôs generally defended the principles of classical economics and opposed socialism. William Graham Sumner wrote an article for the magazine in this vein praising traditional capitalist virtues such as self-reliance and individualism and attributing poverty to laziness and vice. On the other hand, Holland occasionally directed his ire towards \\"soulless\\" corporations that he accused of exploiting workers. In the view of the magazine, both capitalists and workers had moral obligations. In its early days, The Century tended to adopt the same views as its predecessor. It defended capitalism, but refrained from unreflectively denouncing all forms of regulation. For example, an 1886 article opposed socialism but argued that in the future there would be more need for government activism than there had been in the past. Over the next few decades, The Century would publish several forceful denunciations of socialist theories and practice. In the 1890s Gilder and his editors took the position that labor unions were a foreign imposition, one of the many negative consequences of a relatively open immigration policy. Similarly, socialism was said to punish success, a concept that was anathema to the philosophy of his magazine. Despite its conservative leanings, the magazine was open to dissenting views on economic issues in a way that it was not on deeper philosophical matters. The March 1904 issue allowed workers to publish contributions making the case for labor unions as appropriate checks on big business. Two years later, an editorial praised some of the accomplishments of the labor movement, while still maintaining that it needed to be reformed. In its later years, after the Russian Revolution had brought the issue to the attention of the public, The Century opposed the spread of Communism. Employing Nietzschean terminology, Lothrop Stoddard in 1919 called Bolshevism \\"the heresy of the Underman,\\" in contrast to Prussianism, the \\"heresy of the Overman,\\" which had been defeated in the First World War. He went on to argue that the Bolshevik Revolution had only been the local manifestation of a phenomenon that would have to be defeated worldwide and that Vladimir Lenin was \\"a modern Jenghiz Khan plotting the plunder of a world.\\" Turn-of-the-20th-century decline While remaining extremely influential and well-regarded among the American elite, the popularity of The Century began to decline in the 1890s and would never regain the prominence it had as the leading American periodical of the late nineteenth century. By 1900, it had about 125,000 subscribers, half of the circulation it had in the 1880s. The Century suffered due to competition from other cheaper magazines, many of which Gilder and his staff considered vulgar. Although Gilder had been a zealous reformer, as a conservative in politics and values he never embraced the Progressive movement. As its circulation declined, the magazine took a more pessimistic tone and began to write less and less about current events. An 1898 editorial criticized \\"the profusion in the literary and pictorial ‚Äòoutput‚Äô which has a tendency to befog the intellect and lower the standards of taste.\\" A few months later the magazine lamented that the \\"age of reflection\\" had given way to the \\"age of agitation\\" spread by \\"[f]ast trains and cheap print‚Ä¶\\" Similarly, a 1902 editorial argued that divorce was a threat to civilization, and nothing would be more likely to cure this ill than literature \\"celebrating the sanctive and ever-lasting virtues of self-control, forbearance, devotion, and honor.\\" Gilder characteristically saw a connection between a decline in morals and contemporary social problems and believed, conversely, that ennobling art could be a solution. Even in an artistic sense, The Century of the late nineteenth century was slow to adapt to the times. In 1889, after much resistance it became the last major periodical to include photographic illustrations. The editors remained attached to painted drawings, which The Century had become renowned for. In the pages of the magazine Gilder explained this preference by complaining of the trend toward the \\"minute and literal representation of the visible world\\" seen in photography, as opposed to painting, which preserved only that which deserved to be recorded for posterity. He went on to argue that the spread of printing and writing would have a similar vulgarizing and cheapening effect on the written word. Thus, the magazine maintained a great deal of self-awareness about the causes of its declining influence. According to one modern author, in the first decade of the twentieth century, Gilder and the other editors \\"continued to bear aloft the flame of the ideal\\" in a changing era and gave \\"no thought of cheapening the magazine to slow the steady drifting away of subscribers.\\" After Gilder‚Äôs death in 1909, The Century would survive another two decades but never regain its position as the leading American periodical. Later years, 1909-1930 Robert Underwood Johnson was editor of The Century from Gilder‚Äôs death in 1909 until his resignation in 1913. The 1910s would be marked by financial difficulties and a further decline, as the magazine competed with other periodicals of both similar and lesser quality. The Century still attracted some of the best fiction authors of the day, however. H.G. Wells‚Äô \\"prophetic trilogy\\" The World Set Free was serialized in the magazine in the first three issues of 1914. Glenn Frank became editor of The Century in 1921, until he left this position in 1925 to become president of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. He wrote a series of editorials in which he laid out his thoughts on the future of Western civilization. The editorials used colorful language and usually stressed the idea that contemporary social problems had created a need for social engineering and government activism in both domestic and international affairs. For example, in 1923, Frank wrote that Senator Lodge and his isolationist supporters were \\"the amoeba of politics, strange survivals from a prehistoric era of the lowest form of political intelligence.\\" He later argued for what he called \\"an intelligently flexible conservatism.\\" While warning of what he referred to as the dangers of reactionaries on the right and radicals on the left, Frank was also known for expressing a great deal of optimism over the prospect of using the social sciences to improve human affairs. This kind of enthusiasm for reform through science rather than moral progress was a noticeable break from the philosophy of the magazine during the eras of Holland and Gilder. Other writers stressed similar themes throughout the Frank era. Reflecting the magazine‚Äôs tilt to the left, a 1924 article called for \\"industrial democracy\\" to be adopted in American factories. Even the magazine's opposition to socialism was tempered, with Benjamin Stolberg arguing that the Red Scare had been an overreaction and that the Bolshevik threat to the United States had failed to materialize. The leftward shift during this time was not total, however, and, despite the tone that Frank's editorials gave to the magazine, The Century remained open to a wide variety of views. Noted conservative G.K. Chesterton, for example, contributed an essay that was highly critical of contemporary art. Frank was succeeded in 1925 by Hewitt H. Howland, who remained as editor until the magazine merged with The Forum in 1930. Historical memoirs and major reporting Civil War series In 1877, Scribner's published a series of short accounts from those who took part in the Battle of Mobile Bay. The Century continued this kind of historical reporting with a first-person account of John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry it published in 1883, followed in the same issue by a rejoinder from Frank B. Sanborn, a self-described \\"radical abolitionist\\" who had helped finance the mission. Gilder, himself a Union veteran, soon began regularly running the reflections of major Civil War figures. Originally planned to run for twelve months, the series drew so much interest that it lasted for three years and eventually led to a four-volume book. Among the contributors to the series were Union generals Ulysses S. Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman, Philip Sheridan, and George B. McClellan. As The Century tried to avoid bias and promote American unity, it also sought out and accepted accounts from those on the Confederate side, including the generals James Longstreet and P. G. T. Beauregard. The contributions led readers who had served in the war to submit unsolicited recollections and previously unpublished documents to the magazine, in addition to criticisms and rebuttals of published pieces. These submissions were so numerous that in 1885 The Century began to include them in a section titled \\"Memoranda on the Civil War.\\" The magazine had in effect become a forum for those who had fought each other in battle two decades earlier. In the pages of The Century, they could discuss their battles and mutually celebrate the bravery and heroism of both sides. The idea for soliciting recollections of the Civil War originally came from assistant editor Clarence Buel, who later wrote of the difficulties he had in going about convincing former military leaders to share their experiences. In fact, Grant would not agree to contribute to the series until the former general and president had run into financial difficulties. The editors became engrossed in the Civil War project, and sometimes took tours of the famous battle sites, bringing along commanders to explain their exploits and artists to draw sketches of the scenes for the magazine. The Century office became a regular meeting place for former comrades and adversaries, as reflected in a letter an excited Gilder sent to his wife exclaiming \\"Grant one day and Beauregard the next!\\" Before the publication of the series, Sherman was the only major figure of the war who had written a first-person account. Afterwards, the works that Grant, Sheridan, and McClellan contributed to The Century led to books by each of those generals. As a result of the Civil War recollections, the number of subscribers to the magazine jumped to 250,000, a then unprecedented number for a magazine of its kind. Edward Weeks wrote that even by 1950 no \\"quality magazine\\" had ever had as many subscribers as The Century did in the 1880s, even though by that time the reading public had tripled in size. As of 1892, it was also the most widely circulated periodical of its price in England, with 20,000 subscribers.  Lincoln biography  The Century also acquired the rights to publish excerpts from the manuscript of a biography of President Abraham Lincoln written by his former secretaries John Hay and John G. Nicolay. The result was a series titled Abraham Lincoln: A History, which ran over three years. Decades later, The Century would return to Abraham Lincoln as a symbol of the republic's lost virtue. The February 1909 issue had a drawing of Lincoln on its cover and included twenty-two portraits of the former president within its pages along with pictures of his life mask and a cast of his hands. Gilder's contribution to the issue, \\"Lincoln the Leader\\", held the subject up as an ideal for modern statesmen to emulate.  Russian dissidents  In the late 1880s, George Kennan traveled to Russia and wrote a series of reports on the revolutionaries who had opposed Tsar Alexander II and been sent to prisons in Siberia. Seeing him as a writer sympathetic to the autocratic regime and hostile towards its opponents, the Russian government granted Kennan relative freedom to travel around the country. During his travels, however, the author changed his mind and wrote accounts that were highly critical of the regime. His reports included detailed illustrations of the suffering of those who suffered on account of their opposition to the government. In one article, Kennan told the story of how when the decision to assassinate the Tsar was made, 47 individuals volunteered to carry out the mission. Arguing that individuals fighting for civil liberties were rarely as fanatical as the Russian revolutionaries, Kennan wrote that he believed that it was the treatment of prisoners that led to such stringent opposition to the government. He noted that \\"playing upon the deepest and most intense of human emotions as a means of extorting information from unwilling witnesses\\" was routine in prisons holding political offenders. For example, a young woman was led to incriminate her loved ones by being told that they had already confessed. Sometimes, a revolutionary would be told that he was going to meet his mother, taken to her, and then stopped and later informed that he would only see her if he answered questions about his past activities. A twenty-two-year-old mother was falsely led to believe that if she did not cooperate with the authorities her infant could be taken from her. The author also reported that it was common practice for prisoners to be left in solitary confinement for years while government officials searched the empire for evidence with which the offenders could be charged. Kennan came to see himself as a voice for the Russian liberals and was subsequently banned from the country. His writings on Russia were eventually published in a two-volume book. A representative of the Russian government replied to Kennan's arguments in The Century in 1893 and the magazine subsequently published a rebuttal by the author. Kennan‚Äôs writings on Russia and his subsequent activism were perhaps the main causes behind the rise of anti-Tsar sentiment and sympathy for the revolutionary cause among late nineteenth-century American elites. In addition to publishing magazine articles and books, the author also began to give popular lectures on the subject, including dozens of speeches in Chicago, New York City, and Boston. In order to make an impression on the crowd, Kennan would often appear in front of them in the ragged clothes and shackles of a Russian prisoner. This advocacy inspired the formation of a number of American organizations that took up the cause of the exiles, the most prominent of them being the Society of Friends of Russian Freedom. Other histories and recollections In the early 1900s, The Century continued to publish the writings of some of the most famous historians of the era along with first-person accounts of those who had worked in the highest levels of government. Justin Harvey Smith published four articles on the American Revolution in The Century in 1902 and 1903. The next year, S. Weir Mitchell contributed a series on the life of George Washington as a young man. 1907 advertisement for The Century promoting writings by President Roosevelt and then Secretary of War William TaftIn addition to Theodore Roosevelt, The Century claimed a handful of other presidents as contributors. Grover Cleveland provided an account of perhaps the tensest moment of his two presidential administrations, the 1895 Venezuela border controversy with Britain. Andrew D. White contributed a series titled \\"Chapters from My Diplomatic Life\\" on his experiences serving in Germany and Russia. In September 1901, Woodrow Wilson wrote \\"Edmund Burke and the French Revolution\\" while still a professor at Princeton. In 1907 future President William Howard Taft wrote about the Panama Canal while serving as Secretary of War. Over the years, The Century also published first person accounts of individuals who had worked for various presidents. Col. William H. Cook, a bodyguard who served for over 50 years in the White House, shared his memories of the administrations of Andrew Johnson and Rutherford B. Hayes. Historian James Ford Rhodes also contributed an article on the Hayes Administration, which the editors called a kind of postscript to the last-published volume of his history of the United States. Science In its early years, Scribner's Monthly published a regular feature titled \\"Nature and Science.\\" Remaining consistent with its broad mission to educate the public, The Century published articles by some of the most prominent scientists and inventors of the day. Thomas Edison contributed to a symposium on roentgen rays and also once sat for an interview with the magazine. In the June 1900 issue, Nikola Tesla contributed a long article on \\"the problem of increasing human energy.\\" In a piece that combined the magazine's interests in political and scientific issues, geneticist and Marxist J.B.S. Haldane published a 1923 article on the societal implications of technological progress. Literature and the arts Gilder has been called the \\"literary arbiter of his time.\\" Support for artistic excellence reflected his belief in the importance of self-improvement and the celebration of high standards. The works that appeared in his time also reflected the magazine‚Äôs moralism, as they banned references to sex, vulgarity, and insults to Christianity. The Century published the works of a number of major literary figures. In addition to the aforementioned works of Mark Twain and Henry James, pulp magazine author Ellis Parker Butler contributed 30 stories, articles and poems to the magazine between 1896 and 1913, including \\"My Cyclone-proof House\\", which appeared in the November 1896 issue. This short story was Butler's first piece published in a major magazine. His works were illustrated by such famous artists as Jay Hambidge, May Wilson Preston, Florence Scovel Shinn, Frederic Dorr Steele, and Frederic R. Gruger. The Century published a full-color portrait of Butler (with his wife Ada and daughter Elsie) in the December 1909 issue. The portrait was drawn by family friend Ernest L. Blumenschein. The magazine also published the work of Jack London and the first-person account and ink drawings from Tierra del Fuego of American painter Rockwell Kent. Noted engraver Alexander Wilson Drake was a long-time contributor to both The Century Magazine and its earlier incarnation as Scribner's Monthly. The Century Company produced a memorial edition of Alexander Wilson Drake's fiction and art titled Three Midnight Stories in 1916. The Century also employed many notable editorial cartoonists, including Oscar Cesare. Bohemian composer Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k was another noted contributor to The Century Magazine, writing during his stay at the National Conservatory in New York in the 1890s. In 1894, The Century Magazine published his fine tribute to fellow composer Franz Schubert. During the 1900s and 1910s the Anglo-Canadian poet, story writer and essayist Marjorie Pickthall was a regular contributor to The Century Magazine.

A 1967 newsreel depicting several peace walks.  350 km Long Peace Walk New Zealand Kharlzada Kasrat Rai, the World Record for Peace Walks, has devoted his life for the cause of Peace, Education, Health and Cultural activities. He has achieved a widespread fame for the sake of his noble cause. He has conducted several walks with the flag of peace within and beyond the boundaries of Pakistan. He is doing a 350 km Long Peace Walk from Wellington to Christchurch in commemoration of the Christchurch Mosques Attack. He is doing this walk voluntarily for the sake of humanity and Peace. The Peace Walk will start from New Zealand Parliament on 5th March. India Starting in 1951, Vinoba Bhave undertook a peace walk with many of his followers throughout India for land reform. He walked for more than a decade, asking landowners to consider him a son and give him one-sixth of their land for him to distribute to the poor. A peace walk campaign called \\"Freedom Walk\\" was organized by the Free Software Community in Kerala in 2008. Four volunteers walked 750 miles (1,200 km) from one end of the state to the other to promote free software.Freedom Walk Freedom Walk, FSF Blog, Jan. 14, 2009 Europe Hungary and Italy In 2014, a group launched the first permanent peace walk route, which runs from Budapest along the former division between Eastern and Western Europe, and ends in Trieste, Italy. Donol Corcoran of Ireland had completed the \\"European Peace Walk\\" six times by July 2019. Peace walk for the Unity of Hungary, on the 29th of March, 2014 A peace walk for the Unity of Hungary occurred in March 2014. United Kingdom In 1984, members of a peace camp walked 26 miles from RAF Daws Hill to Naphill through country roads to raise money for The Angry Pacifist magazine. United States About 7,000 San Diego Peace Marchers in Balboa Park Protest the Iraq War, March 15, 2003 Various peace organizations throughout the United States organized marches to protest wars, including the Iraq War, on a regular basis. Sometimes these marches are coordinated to take place on the same day across the nation. In San Diego, the greatest number of anti-war protesters, an estimated 7,000, turned out for a demonstration on March 15, 2003, five days before the beginning of the Iraq War. Native Americans have organized numerous cross- country peace walks, including the \\"Longest Walk\\" in 1978 and the \\"Long Walk for Survival\\" in 1980. The projects raised awareness not only for peace, but environmental issues and protection of native sites. In 1984, several walks crossed the nation, including \\"On the Line,\\" which traced the route of trains carrying nuclear weapons from Bangor Base, Washington, to Charleston, South Carolina, and the \\"Peace Pilgrimage of Europeans.\\" The Carter-King Peace Walk at Freedom Park in Atlanta opened in 2003. The 1.5-mile stretch connects the landmarks that commemorate the only two Georgia winners of the Nobel Peace Prize: Martin Luther King Jr. and Jimmy Carter. International From India across the world From 1963 to 1965, two members of Gandhi‚Äôs Sarvodaya movement, Satish Kumar and Prabhakar Menon, walked an estimated 8,000 miles from New Delhi to Washington, D.C., via Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Russia, Poland, Germany, France, and Belgium. They crossed the channel and Atlantic Ocean via ships. Bhave gave two gifts to Kumar and Menon: pennilessness, i.e. voluntary poverty, and vegetarianism. From 1982 through 1986, Prem Kumar walked some 17,000 kilometers (about 10,500 miles) around the world for peace and development in poorer countries. He then organized walks in India involving participants from other countries and started social service organizations. Interfaith Pilgrimage for Peace and Life The \\"Interfaith Pilgrimage for Peace and Life\\" started in Auschwitz, Poland, on December 8, 1994, and ended in Nagasaki on the 50th anniversary of the Nagasaki bombing on August 9, 1995. It was led by Nipponzan-My≈çh≈çji-Daisanga Japanese Buddhist monks. The monks, however, were dwarfed in number by American, European, South American, and Japanese lay people. The trip was organized to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II as well as to be a witness to suffering in contemporary war zones. From Auschwitz, the group walked to Vienna, then traveled through Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia. They crossed the front lines of the Bosnian War in Mostar and held a day of vigil, fasting and prayer there. The next leg took them through Israel, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, Jordan and Iraq. The group traveled across the front lines in Cambodia, where they joined the Dhammayietra, an annual Cambodian peace walk led by Maha Ghosananda, known by some as \\"the \\"Gandhi of Cambodia.\\" They then visited war sites in Vietnam and the Philippines before going to Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This walk was one of many peace pilgrimages organized by the Nipponzan- My≈çh≈çji-Daisanga monks, but this one was among the largest and longest. More than 1,000 people participated in at least part of the pilgrimage, including Buddhists, Quakers, Catholics, Muslims and Jews. A Walk to Moscow Donna Bradley and her son on A Walk For Survival, Oregon Coast, April 22, 1980 \\"A Walk to Moscow\\" was one of many walks for peace in the 20th century. They were specially organized by groups of pacifists and peace activists who wanted to protest against the politics of war and the use of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. In 1960-61, the Committee for Non-Violent Action organized the \\"San Francisco to Moscow Walk for Peace.\\" The group covered some 6,000 miles in ten months and was able to walk through Russia. Walk organizer Bradford Lyttle wrote a book on the project called You Come with Naked Hands. In 1981-83, a group walked across the United States and Europe to Moscow to show solidarity with all people and to demonstrate in a grassroots way that all people are linked by their right to live on the earth in peace and safety. This walk was conceived by organizers while on another peace walk called \\"A Walk for Survival\\", which went from Santa Cruz, California, to Bangor Base, Washington, in 1980. While at a requested meeting with the Russian Consulate in San Francisco, co- organizer Jack Chalmers asked if the group continued to walk eastward across the U.S. and then to Europe, would it be allowed to walk to Moscow? The Consulate official answered, \\"Of course.\\" So when \\"A Walk for Survival\\" ended at the site of a Trident nuclear submarine base in Bangor, organizers immediately started planning \\"A Walk to Moscow.\\" The project began in Bangor on March 1, 1981, and reached the East Coast in time to stay for the winter in Boston. Members flew to Europe in March 1982 and walked across the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, and Federal Republic of Germany. Members took some side trips to Ireland and West Berlin by bus, returning to the starting point so the walking route could continue uninterrupted. Advance teams were sent a few weeks ahead to cities and towns along a prospective route to organize media opportunities, speaking engagements and accommodations. Decisions were made by complete consensus, which often led to long and stormy meetings. The German Democratic Republic had refused entry to the group, so members walked south to Bavaria and stayed there for the winter while negotiating for visas to enter Czechoslovakia, Poland and the USSR. \\"A Walk to Moscow\\" (the indefinite article, rather than the definite \\"The Walk,\\" was important to many original walkers, as it implied that it was only one initiative and others would hopefully follow. The distinction was, however, lost on people in the Eastern countries as Slavonic languages do not have words for \\"an\\" or \\"the.\\") spent nearly a year in Europe working from an old mill house in Regnitzlosau, Germany. It was difficult to get the governments then in the Communist Bloc to allow the group to walk through their territory. While some group members negotiated, other walkers visited places on foot in Germany and gave talks to local peace groups. Some members got involved in passive resistance, chaining themselves to railings over conscription in Germany, and others fasted for peace in the world. Some went to Denmark to meet with peace groups and talk about the walk. In 1983, visas were obtained for Czechoslovakia and Poland, and a continuous walking route was planned and successfully carried out as far as the border between Poland and the USSR. Relations with official peace groups in those countries were tricky; the Czech government tried to incorporate the initiative into its showpiece pro-Warsaw Pact 1983 conference in Prague. However, the group did not participate, although a few members lobbied delegates outside and were invited in for one discussion. Walking across the USSR was not permitted, however. The group entered and transited to Minsk, then Smolensk, hoping for some compromise in negotiations. But that did not happen. At this point, many members chose to return and not go to Moscow; some tried to walk to Moscow anyway but were immediately apprehended and sent to rejoin the others in Minsk. When the walk finished, some people from the group talked at a CND rally about their work and the passive resistance movement. The group membership was international, as people came from all over the world to join and make a difference. Some Walk to Moscow participants later met with other walks that crossed the U.S. and Europe, including Walk of the People - A Pilgrimage for Life, which occurred from 1984 to 1985. That project was also not allowed to walk in Russia, but some members rode a train to Moscow to meet with officials and ordinary people. Women Cross DMZ The Women Cross DMZ (Korean demilitarized zone) group, which included noted American feminist and activist Gloria Steinem, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mairead Maguire, and organizer Christine Ahn, conducted a peace symposium in Pyongyang in May 2015. The all-women group was allowed to walk across the DMZ, separating North and South Korea, for peace a few days after the symposium.

He is considered a pioneer in Art Nouveau design. Biography Grasset was born in Lausanne, Switzerland on 25 May 1845.Murray Robertson, p.103 He was raised in an artistic environment as the son of a cabinetmaker and sculptor who taught him at an early age how to use the chisel and the gouge.Jean-Fran√ßois Luneau, p.359 He studied drawing under Francois-Louis David Bocion (1828‚Äì1890) and in 1861 went to Z√ºrich to study architecture. After completing his education, he visited Egypt, an experience that would later be reflected in a number of his poster designs. He became an admirer of Japanese art, which influenced some of his designs as well. Between 1869 and 1870, Grasset worked as a painter and sculptor in Lausanne. He moved to Paris in 1871 where he designed furniture, wallpapers, fabrics, and tapestries as well as ceramics and jewelry. He created architectural elements of woodwork that were integrated into buildings. His fine art decorative pieces were crafted from ivory, gold, and other precious materials in unique combinations and his creations are considered a cornerstone of Art Nouveau motifs and patterns. In 1877 Eug√®ne Grasset turned to graphic design, producing income-generating products such as postcards and eventually postage stamps for both France and Switzerland. It was poster art, however, that quickly became his forte. Some of his works became part of the Ma√Ætres de l'Affiche, including his lithograph, \\"Jeanne d'Arc Sarah Bernhardt\\". In 1890, he designed the \\"Semeuse who spreads seeds of dandelion\\" logo used by the dictionary publishers, √âditions Larousse. With the growing popularity of French posters in the United States, Grasset was soon contacted by several American companies. In the 1880s, he did his first American commission and more success led to his cover design for the 1892 Christmas issue of Harper's Magazine. In 1894 Grasset created \\"The Wooly Horse\\" and \\"The Sun of Austerlitz\\" for The Century Magazine to help advertise their serialized story on the life of Napoleon Bonaparte. The \\"Wooly Horse\\" image proved so popular that Louis Comfort Tiffany recreated it in stained glass. Grasset's work for U.S. institutions helped pave the way for Art Nouveau to dominate American art. Grasset brooch, Mus√©e d'Orsay Grasset taught design at the √âcole Gu√©rin from 1890 to 1903, at the √âcole d‚ÄôArt graphique in the rue Madame from 1903 to 1904, at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re from 1904 to 1913, and at the √âcole Estienne in Paris. Grasset had freely adapted the alphabet of Nicolas Jenson (1471) with the intention of using it to print a book on his own method for ornamental composition, inspired by the courses he gave to the Gu√©rin school. Georges Peignot acquired Grasset's alphabet and obtained an official patent October 7, 1897 for the typeface under the name, \\"Grasset\\".

He is best known as a former member of the band Jamiroquai. Biography  Early life  Zender was born in Sheffield, England. He comes from a family with a musical background, Zender's father was a musician, his uncle was a flamenco guitarist, and his older sister participated in punk bands. His family relocated to Norristown, Pennsylvania when Zender was seven years old. He moved back to England at age 15, where attended Leighton Park School in Reading, UK for a year in 1988‚Äì89 before being expelled. Zender left his home when he was seventeen with two thousand pounds that his mother had saved, to give him a head start in life. As Zender said, he never had good business acumen, so instead of investing that money in some way, he visited a music store and bought a Warwick Streamer bass guitar which cost nearly the whole amount given to him by his mother. Before picking up a Warwick, Zender played a Music Man Stingray bass guitar. Of his early bands, the most famous was the prank rock group Fabulous, a 1991 outfit chiefly made up of NME writers and photographers. He also said that in another interview, he played a drum with a circus group without animals at that time.  Jamiroquai (1993‚Äì1998)  Zender was one of the members of the band of Jamiroquai. Jamiroquai has been in existence since 1992. He joined the band when the album released in 1993. To be auditioned for Jamiroquai, Stuart met leader Jason Kay (Jay Kay) through Nick Van Gelder(the first drummer in Jamiroquai), acquaintance of the circus group. While enrolled in Jamiroquai, he became famous by playing impressive melodic basslines. Zender was asked to become an official Warwick basses endorser. He received a number of unique custom shop Streamer models. Zender left Jamiroquai in 1998 during the recording of their fourth album, Synkronized, because of conflicts with the band leader Jay Kay. The circumstances behind his departure have never been fully revealed, but Zender told of his anger that he and the other band members were not being credited enough for assisting in songwriting and producing. He also said that he resigned to spend more time with his new wife Melanie Blatt, one of UK girl group All Saints, and their new baby Lilyella. (1998‚Äìpresent) After Jamiroquai, Zender had his own project with the British soul artist, Don-E, called \\"AZUR\\" which signed a record deal with d'Angelo's label. However, the project was shelved and was then available on the Internet for a short time. He has also played bass guitar with other artists, including All Saints, Omar, Lauryn Hill, D'Angelo, Gorillaz, Samuel Purdey, Ms. Dynamite and Stevie Wonder. He and Melanie Blatt were together for seven years. They have one daughter, named Lilyella. Some of Zender's most recent work should have been with his latest band \\"LEROI\\". Zender explained they were signed to Geffen Records in Los Angeles but The deal fell through after the heads of the company, Polly Anthony and Jordan Shurr, who signed them, were made redundant. Zender left Los Angeles in summer 2006 to become the musical director and bass guitar player for Mark Ronson. The release of the album Version in 2007 proved to be a larger success than first expected. He has played bass guitar for Ronson at events such as \\"Radio 1's Big Weekend\\", \\"O2 Wireless at Hyde Park\\", \\"Global Gathering\\" and \\"Glastonbury\\", and festivals all over Europe including \\"Montreux Jazz Festival\\" in Switzerland and \\"North Sea Jazz Festival\\" in Rotterdam. They were also special guests on Jay-Z's UK tour.

Vincentia was the daughter of Baron Ferdinand Vincenz de Merode (1803-1866) and Countess Constance Eleonore Vincentia Emilia Berchtold von und zu Ungarschitz (1826-1855). Vincentia was estranged from Cl√©o's father. Cl√©o was of Austrian, Belgian, French, German, Greek, and Macedonian descent. She was raised Catholic. At the age of eight, she was sent to study dance and made her professional debut at age eleven. de M√©rode became renowned for her glamour even more than for her dancing skills, and her image began appearing on such things as postcards and playing cards. A particular new hairstyle she chose to wear became the talk of Parisian women and was quickly adopted as a popular style for all. Her fame was such that Alexandre Falgui√®re sculpted The Dancer in her image, which today can be seen in the Mus√©e d'Orsay. In 1895, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec did her portrait, as would Charles Puyo, Alfredo Muller, and Giovanni Boldini. Her picture was taken by some of the most illustrious photographers of the day, including F√©lix Nadar. M√©rode, Liane de Pougy, and La Belle Otero appear in a fashionable crowd in the Bois de Boulogne drawn by Guth, 1897 In 1896, King Leopold II attended the ballet and saw M√©rode dance. The 61-year-old Belgian king became enamoured with the 21-year-old ballet star, and gossip started that she was his latest mistress. Because the King had had two children with a woman reputed to be a prostitute, M√©rode's reputation suffered, and she had to live with it for the rest of her life. Nevertheless, she became an international star, performing across Europe and in the United States. At the peak of her popularity, she chose to dance at the Folies Berg√®re, taking the risk to do something other elites of the ballet had never done before. Her performance gained her a whole new following. Very popular in Austria as well as in Germany, her character appeared in the German film Women of Passion (1926), played by Fern Andra. In Vienna, her beauty caught the attention of painter Gustav Klimt, whose primary focus was on female sexuality. Their story was the basis of the film Klimt, in which the character \\"Lea de Castro\\" is based on Cl√©o de M√©rode. de M√©rode continued to dance until her early fifties, when she retired to the seaside resort of Biarritz in the Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques d√©partement of France. She then taught ballet before retiring in 1965 at 90 years old. In 1950, de M√©rode sued Simone de Beauvoir for libel for calling her a courtesan in her book The Second Sex. de M√©rode won the lawsuit, and the passage was taken out of the book. In 1955, she published her autobiography, Le Ballet de ma vie (The Dance of My Life).Garval, Michael D. (2012). Cl√©o de M√©rode and the Rise of Modern Celebrity Culture. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. p. 38. . de M√©rode never married or had children, and she claimed in her autobiography that she had only been involved with two men in her life. She was engaged to a French aristocrat for nearly ten years before he died of Typhoid fever in 1904, and she was the companion of the Spanish sculptor and diplomat Luis de P√©rinat, Marquis de P√©rinat (1872‚Äì1923) from 1906 to 1919. She was a vegetarian. M√©rode's grave at P√®re Lachaise Cl√©o de M√©rode died on 17 October 1966 and was interred in the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris in Division 90. A statue of her by Luis de P√©rinat, mourning her mother, who is interred in the same plot, decorates the gravestone.

Renamed the Cutlass Calais for 1988, and briefly available in 1987 as the limited edition GMO Quad 4, the Calais shared the GM N platform with the Pontiac Grand Am and the Buick Skylark/Buick Somerset -- and was superseded by the Oldsmobile Achieva in 1992. The Calais was selected the Indianapolis 500 Pace car for 1985 and was driven by actor James Garner. The first production model (VIN 1G3NT27UXFM200001), was a white Calais Supreme two-door with a gray velour interior. Equipped with an automatic transmission and the 92 horsepower, 151 CID pushrod four-cylinder engine (also known as GM's \\"Iron Duke\\" Tech-IV), this particular model was outfitted with nearly every available option, including wire wheel covers. While this front-wheel drive car is maintained by the R.E. Olds Transportation Museum in Lansing, Michigan, it was one of more than 700 vehicles that made up the GM Heritage Collection of historically significant vehicles that date back to the early 1900s. The Calais Supreme was auctioned in April, 2009, and sold for $6,820. In 1987, the Quad 4 engine was developed and became available in a special limited edition of the Calais called the \\"GMO Quad 4\\". Early television ads touting the new engine's abilities showed video of the Calais GMO Quad 4 racing around city streets (the submodel was dropped, however the Quad 4 engine continued to be available for several years afterward). Another, later special Cutlass Calais model was the 1990 to 1991 Quad-442. It used a high-output version of the four-cylinder coupled to a 5-speed manual transmission. This same High Output version was also available in the top-of- the-line Cutlass Calais International Series. 1991 Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais International Series coupe The International Series was available as both a 2-door or a 4-door and featured exclusive options for the Calais range including lower front and rear facias, lower rocker extensions, and quad- tipped sport exhaust. Changes inside include thickly bolstered sport seats which feature driver-side power controls and were available in cloth with leather accents or full leather. The International Series came standard with power locks and windows with driver's side auto-down, a multifunction Driver Information Center in the center console, full gauges, cruise control, and the uplevel FE3 sport suspension. The standard engine for the International was the new-for-1990 Quad 4 H.O. although the normal Quad 4 L.O. and automatic transmission were an option. Optional equipment on the International series included keyless entry and a Delco CD player. Previously, the Cutlass Calais nameplate was used on top-line versions of the Cutlass Supreme coup√© (differing from the Supreme only in minor trim details) from 1978 to 1984. There was also a Cadillac Calais model, sold from 1965 to 1976.

It is famous in American colonial history for its role as a key passageway through the lower central Appalachians. Long used by Native American nations, the Cumberland Gap was brought to the attention of settlers in 1750 by Thomas Walker, a Virginia physician and explorer. The path was used by a team of frontiersmen led by Daniel Boone, making it accessible to pioneers who used it to journey into the western frontiers of Kentucky and Tennessee. It was an important part of the Wilderness Road and is now part of the Cumberland Gap National Historical Park. Geography A map of the Cumberland Gap (red text) The Cumberland Gap is one of many passes in the Appalachian Mountains but the only one in the continuous Cumberland Mountain ridgeline. It lies within Cumberland Gap National Historical Park and is located on the border of present-day Kentucky and Virginia, approximately northeast of the tri-state marker with Tennessee. The V-shaped gap serves as a gateway to the west. The base of the gap is about above the valley floor, even though the north side of the pass was lowered during the construction of Old U.S. Route 25E. To the south, the ridge rises above the pass, while to the north the Pinnacle Overlook towers above (elevation ). Because it is centrally located in the United States, the region around Cumberland Gap experiences all four seasons. The summers are typically sunny, warm and humid with average high temperatures in the mid to upper 80s F (29-32C). In the winter months, January through March, temperatures range in the 30s to 40s F (0s C) and are generally mild with rain and few periods of snow. The nearest cities are Middlesboro, Kentucky, and Harrogate, Tennessee. The nearby town of Cumberland Gap, in Tennessee, is named after the gap. Geology The gap was formed by the development of three major structural features: the Pine Mountain Thrust Sheet, the Middlesboro Syncline, and the Rocky Face Fault. Lateral compressive forces of sedimentary rocks from deep layers of the Earth's crust pushing upward 320 to 200 million years ago created the thrust sheet. Resistance on the fault from the opposing Cumberland Mountain to Pine Mountain caused the U-shaped structure of the Middlesboro Syncline. The once flat-lying sedimentary rocks were deformed roughly 40 degrees northwest. Further constriction to the northwest of Cumberland Mountain developed into a fault trending north-to-south called the Rocky Face Fault, which eventually cut through Cumberland Mountain. This combination of natural geological processes created ideal conditions for weathering and erosion of the rocks. The discovery of the Middlesboro impact structure has proposed new details in the formation of Cumberland Gap. Less than 300 million years ago a meteorite, \\"approximately the size of a football field\\", struck the earth, creating the Middlesboro Crater. One of three astroblemes in the state, it is a diameter meteorite impact crater with the city of Middlesboro, Kentucky, built entirely inside it. Detailed mapping by geologists in the 1960s led many to interpret the geological features of the area to be the site of an ancient impact. In 1966 Robert Dietz discovered shatter cones in nearby sandstone, proving recent speculation. Shatter cones, a rock-shattering pattern naturally formed only during impact events, are found in abundance in the area. The presence of shatter cones found also helped confirm the origin of impact. In September 2003, the site was designated a Distinguished Geologic Site by the Kentucky Society of Professional Geologists. Without the Rocky Face Fault, it would have been difficult for pack-horses to navigate this gap and the gap in Pine Mountain near Pineville, and it would be improbable that wagon roads would have been constructed at an early date. Middlesboro is the only place in the world where coal is mined inside an astrobleme. Special mining techniques must be used in the complicated strata of this crater.Milam & Kuehn, 36 History Map showing Cumberland Gap in relation to the Wilderness Road route from Virginia to Kentucky The passage created by Cumberland Gap was well traveled by Native Americans long before the arrival of European-American settlers. The passage through the gap was originally created by herds of woodland buffalo that traveled across it over thousands of years, drawn by the abundance of salt in the region. The earliest written account of Cumberland Gap dates to the 1670s, by Abraham Wood of Virginia. Union soldiers passing through Cumberland Gap, 1863 The gap was named for Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, son of King George II of Great Britain, who had many places named for him in the American colonies after the Battle of Culloden. The explorer Thomas Walker gave the name to the Cumberland River in 1750, and the name soon spread to many other features in the region, such as the Cumberland Gap. In 1769 Joseph Martin built a fort nearby at present-day Rose Hill, Virginia, on behalf of Walker's land claimants. But Martin and his men were chased out of the area by Native Americans, and Martin did not return until 1775. Old US 25E sign In 1775 Daniel Boone, hired by the Transylvania Company, arrived in the region leading a company of men to widen the path through the gap to make settlement of Kentucky and Tennessee easier. On his arrival, Boone discovered that Martin had already arrived in Powell Valley, where Martin and his men were clearing land for their own settlement ‚Äì the westernmost settlement in English colonial America at the time. By the 1790s, the trail that Boone and his men built had been widened to accommodate wagon traffic and became known as the Wilderness Road. Daniel Boone Escorting Settlers through the Cumberland Gap (George Caleb Bingham, oil on canvas, 1851‚Äì52) Several American Civil War engagements occurred in and around the Cumberland Gap and are known as the Battle of the Cumberland Gap. In June 1862, Union Army General George W. Morgan captured the gap for the Union. In September of that year, Confederate States Army forces under Edmund Kirby Smith occupied the gap during General Braxton Bragg's Kentucky Invasion. The following year, in a bloodless engagement in September 1863, Union Army troops under General Ambrose Burnside forced the surrender of 2,300 Confederates defending the gap, gaining Union control of the gap for the remainder of the war. It is estimated that between 200,000 and 300,000 European-American settlers passed through the gap on their way into Kentucky and the Ohio Valley before 1810. Today 18,000 cars pass beneath the site daily, and 1.2 million people visit the park on the site annually. The park features many hiking trails. Construction of the Cumberland Gap Tunnel in 1991 U.S. Route 25E passed overland through the gap before the completion of the Cumberland Gap Tunnel in 1996. The original trail was then restored.

There are 15 various vegetation communities throughout the park, with some of them in special locations, such as mountain bogs, low-elevation wetlands, and rocky bluffs. Fauna Of the 371 species of animals listed so far within the park, 33 are mammals, 89 are birds, 29 amphibians, 15 reptiles, 27 fish, and 187 are insects, however many others remain to be included. Visitors to the park can expect to see gray squirrels, white-tailed deer, cottontail rabbits, songbirds, hawks, snakes, turtles, and perhaps black bear or bobcat. Over 120 species of birds have been logged in the park on the website eBird.

It was intended to formulate a merchant shipbuilding program to design and build five hundred modern merchant cargo ships to replace the World War I vintage vessels that comprised the bulk of the United States Merchant Marine, and to administer a subsidy system authorized by the Act to offset the cost differential between building in the U.S. and operating ships under the American flag. It also formed the United States Maritime Service for the training of seagoing ship's officers to man the new fleet. As a symbol of the rebirth of the U.S. Merchant Marine and Merchant Shipbuilding under the Merchant Marine Act, the first vessel contracted for was . Owned by the United States Lines, she briefly operated in the passenger liner and cruise service before being converted into a high- speed transport, per her design. From 1939 through the end of World War II, the Maritime Commission funded and administered the largest and most successful merchant shipbuilding effort in world history, producing thousands of ships, including Liberty ships, Victory ships, and others, notably Type C1, Type C2, Type C3, Type C4 freighters and T2 tankers. By the end of the war, U.S. shipyards working under Maritime Commission contracts had built a total of 5,777 oceangoing merchant and naval ships. A huge postwar contraction followed, with massive sell-offs to foreign militaries and commercial fleets. The last major shipbuilding project undertaken by the Commission was to oversee the design and construction of the super passenger liner which was intended to be both a symbol of American technological might and maritime predominance but also could be quickly converted into the world's fastest naval troop transport. The Maritime Commission was abolished on 24 May 1950, and its functions were divided between the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission which was responsible for regulating shipping trades and trade routes and the United States Maritime Administration, which was responsible for administering the construction and operating subsidy programs, maintaining NDRF, and operating the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy which had been built and opened during World War II and which continues to be funded as the nation's federally operated maritime academy under 46 USC 310. History Purposes The purpose of the Maritime Commission was multifold as described in the Merchant Marine Act's Declaration of Policy. The first role was to formulate a merchant shipbuilding program to design and then have built over a ten-year period 900 modern fast merchant cargo ships which would replace the World War I-vintage vessels which made up the bulk of the U.S. Merchant Marine prior to the Act. Those ships were intended to be chartered (leased) to U.S. shipping companies for their use in the foreign seagoing trades for whom they would be able to offer better and more economical freight services to their clients. The ships were also intended to serve as a reserve naval auxiliary force in the event of armed conflict which was a duty the U.S. merchant fleet had often filled throughout the years since the Revolutionary War. The second role given to the Maritime Commission was to administer a subsidy system authorized by the Act which would offset the differential cost between both building in the U.S. and operating ships under the American flag. Another function given to the Commission involved the formation of the U.S. Maritime Service for the training of seagoing ship's officers to man the new fleet. The actual licensing of officers and seamen still resided with the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation. WWII United States Maritime Commission poster Pre-World War II President Roosevelt nominated Joseph P. Kennedy first head of the Commission. Kennedy held that position until February 1938 when he left to become US Ambassador to Great Britain. After Kennedy's departure, the chairmanship was assumed by Rear Admiral Emory S. Land, USN (ret.), who had been the head of U.S. Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair prior to his appointment to the Commission on the behest of the President and where he had been a deputy commissioner since the founding of the body. The other four members of the Commission in the years before the beginning of World War II were a mix of retired naval officers and men from disciplines of law and business. The man most notable in the group Land brought to the Commission was Commander Howard L. Vickery, USN, who, like Land, was a naval officer closely involved in the construction of new Navy vessels. Vickery became responsible for overseeing the Commission's shipbuilding functions including the design and construction of the ships, developing shipyards to build them and companies to manufacture the complicated and highly specialized ship's machinery. As World War II drew closer, Vickery was very much at the forefront of putting into place the Emergency Shipbuilding Program which man like Henry J. Kaiser were so instrumental in developing into an industry which would perform some of the greatest feats of wartime industrial production ever previously witnessed and never since matched. As a symbol of the rebirth of the U.S. Merchant Marine and Merchant Shipbuilding under the Merchant Marine Act, the first vessel contracted for was , which was owned by the United States Line and operated in the passenger liner and cruise service during 1940-1. Upon the U.S. entry into World War II, America was requisitioned by the U.S. Navy and became . In the prewar years, several dozen other merchant ships were built for the Commission under its original 500 ship Long Range Shipbuilding Program but it wasn't until the late fall of 1940 the critical importance of the Commission to the defense of the lifeline to Great Britain and to the national mobilization for war became apparent when the beginnings of the Emergency Shipbuilding program were laid. Together, all the Maritime Commission's shipbuilding program became known as Ships for Victory and great pride was taken in it by the many thousands of ordinary citizens went to work in the shipyards and joined the ranks of the shipbuilding workforce. World War II From 1939 through the end of World War II, the Maritime Commission funded and administered the largest and most successful merchant shipbuilding effort in world history, producing thousands of ships, including Liberty ships, Victory ships, and others, notably Type C1, Type C2, Type C3, Type C4 freighters and T2 tankers. Most of the C2s and C3s were converted to Navy auxiliaries, notably attack cargo ships, attack transports, and escort aircraft carriers and many of the tankers became fleet replenishment oilers. The Commission also was tasked with the construction of many hundred \\"military type\\" vessels such as Landing Ship, Tank (LST)s and s and large troop transports. By the end of the war, U.S. shipyards working under Maritime Commission contracts had built a total of 5,777 oceangoing merchant and naval ships. In early 1942 both the training and licensing was transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard for administration, but then late in the fall of 1942, the Maritime Service was transferred to the newly created War Shipping Administration which itself was created for the purpose of overseeing the operation of the fleet of merchant ships being built by the Emergency Program for the needs of the U.S. Armed Services. The WSA was added to the list of wartime agencies created within the Roosevelt Administration and was intended to relieve the already full plate of responsibilities of the Commission, yet they shared the same Chairman in Admiral Land and so worked very closely together. Post World War II With the end of World War II, both the Emergency and Long Range shipbuilding programs were terminated as there were far too many merchant vessels now for the Nation's peacetime needs. In 1946, the Commission was chaired by Vice admiral William W. Smith and the Merchant Ship Sales Act was passed to sell off a large portion of the ships previously built during the war to commercial buyers, both domestic and foreign. This facilitated the rebuilding of the fleets of both allied nations such as Great Britain, Norway and Greece which had lost a majority of their prewar vessels to the Battles of the Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. Although not sold outright to nations that were enemies during the war, U.S. merchant ships helped nations such as Japan, which had lost many hundreds of its merchant vessels to the Allies' submarine offensive in the western Pacific, recover their merchant shipping capacity via the loan of vessels and the carrying of relief cargoes to war ravaged Europe. Ships were also used in both the rebuilding programs under the Marshall Plan and the transport of food aid sent during the desperate winter of 1945-46 when famine loomed large over much of the European continent. For the next 25 years, in ports all around the world one could find dozens of ships which had been built during the war but which now were used in peace. Many of those same ships continued to sail until the early 1980s but most had been sold for scrap in the 1960s and 1970s as more modern designs were developed and more efficient slow speed diesel engines introduced to replace the steamships which predominated those built by the Commission during the war years. Ships not disposed of through the Ship Sales Act were placed into one of eight National Defense Reserve Fleet(NDRF) sites maintained on the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf coasts. On several occasions in the postwar years ships in the reserve fleets were activated for both military and humanitarian aid missions. The last major mobilization of the NDRF came during the Vietnam War. Since then, a smaller fleet of ships called the Ready Reserve Force has been mobilized to support both humanitarian and military missions. SS United States The last major shipbuilding project undertaken by the Commission was to oversee the design and construction of the super passenger liner , which was intended to be both a symbol of American technological might and maritime predominance but also could be quickly converted into the world's fastest naval troop transport.

The British Royal Navy used it for many years. It was for underwater work rather than for combat diving. The main oxygen cylinders are on the diver's back. The oxygen cylinders at the front of the diver are for bailout. In its basic mode it was an oxygen rebreather; but some of the cylinders could be replaced by diluent cylinders for nitrox mode (which the Navy called \\"mixture\\"), and then the set was sometimes called CDMBA. The Royal Navy was using nitrox from 1944, but did not reveal its nitrox techniques, and in the 1960s and afterwards civilian divers had to retread the same ground and develop nitrox diving independently. In later years it was called DSSCCD from \\"Diving Set, Self- Contained, Clearance Diver\\". Design 2 types of fullface mask used with the CDBA and UBA and SCBA; the oval type is older. The CDBA was very popular with the clearance divers. It is comfortable since there is no cylinder on the middle of the back, no bulky buoyancy compensator, and it requires very little weight. As the rebreather has a single \\"pendulum\\" breathing tube, the diver must breathe deeply to avoid carbon dioxide build-up. The counterlung is eight litres. As with all rebreathers, the diver should breathe continuously to keep the gas flowing over the absorbent. Dives on the unit are limited to 90 minutes. Instead of a weight belt there is a weight pouch at the back, full of lead ball weights in diameter. In an emergency, the diver could pull a line which opened the weight pouch to jettison these weights. It is intended to be used with a fullface mask with one breathing tube. At first (during World War II and after) a mask with an oval or circular flat window (as seen in images at this link) was used; later the mask with the newer type of rectangular window mostly flat but folded back at the sides was used. Modes of setting up the CDBA The front cylinders were intended as a bailout; the main cylinders are on the back. For a short dive the set could be used without the back cylinders, using only the front cylinders; this made the set very light and compact and suitable for getting through small holes. Even with the back cylinders the diver is much more compact and streamlined and agile than most recreational open circuit scuba. The front and the back of the harness can unclip from each other at the shoulders. There is no automatic gas control: so safe use of the set relied entirely on training. Computer-generated image of three frogmen riding a Subskimmer underwater. Their breathing sets are the Siebe Gorman CDBA. Other similar rebreathers 2 frogmen with Siebe Gorman SCBA (or similar) 1950's-type rebreathers British \\"frogman's\\" sets used the same shape of counterlung as the CDBA but different cylinders. One type was the \\"Swimmer Canoeists Breathing Apparatus\\" (SCBA), which had oxygen cylinders on the back, vertically for better streamlining in swimming, the oxygen connections thinner, and no cylinders on the front, leaving the diver's lower front uncluttered for climbing in and out of small boats. The SCBA gave 90 minutes dive duration with no reserve. In mixture (nitrox or heliox) mode it was called SCMBA. An old photograph seems to show the cylinders (and perhaps also the weights) in a tied or laced canvas casing rather than held on with metal clamps, and a rectangular fullface mask as with the CDBA. There is a British armed forces manual about the SCBA, dated 1984 as if the SCBA was still in use then, showing separate eyes-and-nose mask and strapped-in mouthpiece and no canvas pouch, and separate sport-type weight belt with buckle-shaped weights all at the back. The design of the Swimmer Canoeists Breathing Apparatus likely changed down the years. The LOSE (Lightweight Oxygen Swimmers Equipment), a diving rebreather formerly made by Siebe Gorman, was similar to a Swimmer Canoeist's Breathing Apparatus including the cylinder backpack. Other British frogmen's sets had no back cylinders and one or more big cylinders across the belly: one of these modes was the UBA (Underwater Breathing Apparatus). Other meanings of those initials *The letters \\"SCBA\\" had two other meanings connected to breathing sets: **Submerged Chamber Breathing Apparatus (formerly used to aerate submerged air-chambers). **Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (its modern meaning, it means industrial breathing sets (usually open-circuit) for use on land): see SCBA.

The Brahma S≈´tras consists of 555 aphoristic verses (sutras) in four chapters. These verses are primarily about the nature of human existence and universe, and ideas about the metaphysical principle of Ultimate Reality called Brahman. The first chapter discusses the metaphysics of Absolute Reality, the second chapter reviews and addresses the objections raised by the ideas of competing orthodox schools of Hindu philosophies such as Nyaya, Yoga, Vaisheshika and Mimamsa as well as heterodox schools such as Buddhism and Jainism,Gregory Darling (2007), An Evaluation of the VedƒÅntic Critique of Buddhism, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 161-164 the third chapter discusses epistemology and path to gaining spiritually liberating knowledge, and the last chapter states why such a knowledge is an important human need. The Brahma S≈´tras is one of three most important texts in Vedanta along with the Principal Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita. It has been influential to various schools of Indian philosophies, but interpreted differently by the non-dualistic Advaita Vedanta sub-school, the theistic Vishishtadvaita and Dvaita Vedanta sub-schools, as well as others.Vedanta Hindu Philosophy Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2013) Several commentaries on the Brahma S≈´tras are lost to history or yet to be found; of the surviving ones, the most well studied commentaries on the Brahma S≈´tras include the bhashya by Adi Shankara, Ramanuja, Madhvacharya, Bhaskara and many others. It is also known as the Vedanta Sutra (Sanskrit: ‡§µ‡•á‡§¶‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§§ ‡§∏‡•Ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞), deriving this name from Vedanta which literally means the \\"final aim of the Vedas\\".Paul Deussen, The System of the Vedanta: According to Badarayana's Brahma-Sutras and Shankara's Commentary thereon, Translator: Charles Johnston, , pages 3-4 Other names for Brahma S≈´tras is Shariraka Sutra, wherein Shariraka means \\"that which lives in the body (Sharira), or the Self, Soul\\", and Bhikshu-sutra, which literally means \\"Sutras for monks or mendicants\\".NV Isaeva (1992), Shankara and Indian Philosophy, State University of New York Press, , page 35 with footnote 30 Author and chronology The Brahma S≈´tras or Brahmasutra are attributed to Badarayana. In some texts, Badarayana is also called Vyasa, which literally means \\"one who arranges\\". BƒÅdarƒÅyana was the Guru (teacher) of Jaimini, the latter credited with authoring Mimamsa Sutras of the Mimamsa school of Hindu philosophy. This is likely, given that both Badarayana and Jaimini quote each other as they analyze each other's theories, Badarayana emphasizing knowledge while Jaimini emphasizes rituals, sometimes agreeing with each other, sometimes disagreeing, often anti-thesis of the other.Paul Deussen, The System of the Vedanta: According to Badarayana's Brahma-Sutras and Shankara's Commentary thereon, Translator: Charles Johnston, , page 20 The Brahma S≈´tras text is dated to centuries that followed Buddha and Mahavira, because it mentions and critiques the ideas of Buddhism and Jainism in Chapter 2. The text's relative chronology is also based on the fact that Badarayana quotes all major known orthodox Hindu schools of philosophy except Nyaya.Paul Deussen, The System of the Vedanta: According to Badarayana's Brahma-Sutras and Shankara's Commentary thereon, Translator: Charles Johnston, , page 21 The exact century of its composition or completion in final form is unknown, but scholars such as Lochtefeld suggest that the text was complete sometime between 500 and 200 BCE,James Lochtefeld, Brahman, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A‚ÄìM, Rosen Publishing, , page 746Klaus K Klostermaier (2010), A Survey of Hinduism, Third Edition, State University of New York Press, , page 501 while Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Dasgupta independently suggest the 2nd century BCE as more likely. Paul Deussen places it between 200 BCE and 400 CE.NV Isaeva (1992), Shankara and Indian Philosophy, State University of New York Press, , page 36 Hermann Jacobi in early 20th century suggested that Madhyamaka Buddhist concepts such as Sunyavada, acknowledged in the Brahma S≈´tras, may be a late invention, and suggests that both Sunyavada and Brahma S≈´tras may therefore have emerged between 200-450 CE. Daniel Ingalls disagreed with Jacobi chronology in his 1954 paper, critiquing Jacobi's assumptions and interpretation of sutras 2.2.28-32 in dating the entire document, and stating that \\"the Brahma S≈´tras could not have been composed later than the start of the common era\\".Daniel Ingalls (1954), Sankara's Arguments Against the Buddhists, Philosophy East and West, Volume 3, Number 4, page 299Gregory Darling (2007), An Evaluation of the VedƒÅntic Critique of Buddhism, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 6-7 According to Hajime Nakamura, the Brahma S≈´traswere likely complete in the current form between 400 and 450 CE. The existence of earlier versions of the Brahma S≈´tras, and multiple authors predating Badarayana, is supported by textual evidence. Some scholars, such as Sengaku Mayeda, state Brahma S≈´tra that has survived into the modern times may be the work of multiple authors but those who lived after Badarayana, and that these authors composed the currently surviving Brahma S≈´tras starting about 300 BCE through about 400-450 CE.≈öa·πÖkarƒÅcƒÅrya; Sengaku Mayeda (2006), A Thousand Teachings: The Upade≈õasƒÅhasrƒ´ of ≈öa·πÖkara, State University of New York Press, , page 12 Nakamura states that the original version of Brahma S≈´tras is likely very ancient and its inception coincides with the Kalpa Sutras period (1st- millennium BCE).Klaus Witz (1998), The Supreme Wisdom of the Upani·π£ads: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 53 with footnote 118 Natalia Isaeva states, \\"on the whole, scholars are rather unanimous, considering the most probable date for Brahma S≈´tras sometime between the 2nd-century BCE and the 2nd-century CE.

Sutras were meant to assist the memory of the student who had gone through long discussions with his guru, as memory aids or clues and maximum thoughts were compressed in a few words which were unambiguous, giving the essence of the arguments on the topic.Sutras were memory clues The Sutras of the text, states Adi Shankara in his commentary, are structured like a string that ties together the Vedanta texts like a garland of flowers. Contents Sengaku Mayeda states that the Brahma S≈´tras distills and consolidates the extensive teachings found in a variety of Upanishads of Hinduism, summarizing, arranging, unifying and systematizing the Upanishadic theories, possibly \\"written from a BhedƒÅbheda VedƒÅntic viewpoint.\\"Andrew J. Nicholson, Bhedabheda Vedanta, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy Prior to the creation of the Brahmasutras, the Vedic literature had grown into an enormous collection of ideas and practices, ranging from practical rituals (karma-kanda) to abstract philosophy (jnana-kanda). Different and conflicting theories on metaphysical problems, diverse mutually contradicting unsystematized teachings on rituals and philosophies multiplied in the four Vedas, creating the need for consolidated and systematized content summary of the Sruti. This was achieved by Jaimini's Mimamsa-sutra which focused on externalized rituals as the spiritual path, while Badarayana's Brahma S≈´tras focused on internalized philosophy as the spiritual path.Paul Deussen, The System of the Vedanta: According to Badarayana's Brahma-Sutras and Shankara's Commentary thereon, Translator: Charles Johnston, , pages 19-25, 6-12 The text reviews and critiques most major orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy as well as all heterodox Indian philosophies such as Buddhism, with the exception of Samkhya and Yoga philosophies which it holds in high regards and recurrently refers to them in all its four chapters, adding in sutras 2.1.3 and 4.2.21 that Yoga and Samkhya are similar.Paul Deussen, The System of the Vedanta: According to Badarayana's Brahma S≈´tras and Shankara's Commentary thereon, Translator: Charles Johnston, , pages 22-23 The text cites and quotes from the ten Principal Upanishads often, the Kaushitaki Upanishad and the Shvetashvatara Upanishad in several sutras, but also mentions Upanishads now unknown and lost. The contents of the text also acknowledge and analyze the various Vedic schools, and mentions the existence of multiple, diverging versions of the same underlying text.Paul Deussen, The System of the Vedanta: According to Badarayana's Brahma-Sutras and Shankara's Commentary thereon, Translator: Charles Johnston, , page 24 The sutras of the Brahma S≈´tras are aphorisms, which Paul Deussen states to be \\"threads stretched out in weaving to form the basis of the web\\", and intelligible \\"when the woof is added\\" with a commentary.Paul Deussen, The System of the Vedanta: According to Badarayana's Brahma-Sutras and Shankara's Commentary thereon, Translator: Charles Johnston, , page 26 Chapter 1: What is Brahman? The first chapter is regarded in Vedanta tradition as Samanvaya (Harmony), because it distills, synchronizes and brings into a harmonious whole the seemingly diverse and conflicting passages in various Sruti texts.Jose Pereira (1986), BƒÅdarƒÅyana: Creator of Systematic Theology, Religious Studies (Cambridge University Press), Volume 22, Issue 2, pages 193-204 It consists of 134 sutras, with eleven Adhikaranas in the first Pada, seven Adhikaranas in second, fourteen Adhikaranas in third, and eight in the fourth Pada.George Thibaut, Vedanta Sutras Part 1, , Volume 34 (Editor: Max Muller), Oxford University Press, pages xxxii-xlvi The different sub-schools of Vedanta have interpreted the sutras in the last Pada differently, and some count only seven Adhikaranas in the fourth Pada. This Brahma S≈´tras chapter asserts that all the Upanishads primarily aim and coherently describe the knowledge and meditation of Brahman, the ultimate reality.Francis X Clooney (1993), Theology After Vedanta: An Experiment in Comparative Theology, State University of New York Press, , pages 68-71 Brahman is the source from which the world came into existence, in whom it inheres and to which it returns. The only source for the knowledge of this Brahman is the Sruti or the Upanishads.Harshananda, Swami (2009), The Six Systems of Hindu Philosophy, A Primer, p.73 The sutras 1.1.5-11 quotes the Samkhya school's view that the Principle of the world is unconscious, and instead asserts that the Principle of the world is conscious and the Brahman itself. The remaining sutras in Pada 1.1, all sutras of 1.2 and 1.3 assert that Brahman is the primary focus of the Upanishads, is various aspects of empirical reality, quoting various verses in support, from Taittiriya Upanishad, Chandogya Upanishad, Kaushitaki Upanishad, Mundaka Upanishad, Katha Upanishad, Brihadaranyaka Upanishad and Prashna Upanishad.Paul Deussen, The System of the Vedanta: According to Badarayana's Brahma-Sutras and Shankara's Commentary thereon, Translator: Charles Johnston, , pages 39-40Brahma sutra Bhasya Adi Shankara, Archive 2 The first chapter in sutras 1.4.1-15 presents the Samkhya theories on Prakriti, and presents its arguments that these are inconsistent and misinterpretation of the Katha, Brihadaranyaka, Shvetashvatara and Taittiriya Upanishad. Sutras 1.4.23 through 1.4.27 state that Brahman is the efficient cause and the material cause of the world. The last sutra of the first chapter states that the arguments on the refutation of Samkhya theories also apply to the atomists (Vaisheshika school of Hindu philosophy). Chapter 2: Review of competing theories Second chapter (Avirodha: non-conflict, non-contradiction): discusses and refutes the possible objections to VedƒÅnta philosophy, and states that the central themes of Vedanta are consistent across the various Vedic texts. The Brahma S≈´tra states, examines and dismisses the refutations raised by other schools of thoughts, those now classified under Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism.Harshananda, Swami (2009), The Six Systems of Hindu Philosophy, A Primer, p.75 The second chapter consists of 157 sutras, with thirteen Adhikaranas in the first Pada, eight in second, seventeen Adhikaranas in third, and nine in the fourth Pada.George Thibaut, Vedanta Sutras Part 1, , Volume 34 (Editor: Max Muller), Oxford University Press, pages xlvii-lix The second chapter of the Brahma S≈´tra has been variously interpreted by various monist, theistic and other sub-schools of Vedanta.≈öa·πÖkarƒÅcƒÅrya; Sengaku Mayeda (2006), A Thousand Teachings: The Upade≈õasƒÅhasrƒ´ of ≈öa·πÖkara, State University of New York Press, , pages 12-13 The Advaita school for example, states Francis Clooney, asserts that the \\"identity of Atman and Brahman\\" based Advaita system is the coherent system while other systems conflict with the Upanishads, or are internally inconsistent, or incoherent with observed reality and cosmos. The theistic sub-schools interpret the text to be stating that Atman is different than Brahman, and thereafter each explains how other systems conflict with the Upanishads or are incoherent. The Pada 2.1 opens with Adhikarana on Samkhya and Vaisheshika schools argument that Smritis should be a basis for examining the concept of Brahman, and their objections to the Vedanta theory of reflection. The Brahma S≈´tras asserts in 2.1.13 through 2.1.20 that the subject and object are one in Brahman, which agrees with Samkhya that there is an identity in cause and effect, adding that the Brahman and the empirical world are therefore one. The sutras 2.1.21 through 2.1.36 present the problem of evil, offering its own doctrine to address it, asserting that Brahman is neither unjust nor cruel, and that inequality and evil exists in the world because of will, choices and circumstances created by actions of living beings over time. The sutras in Pada 2.1 are variously interpreted by Advaita, Dvaita, Vishishtadvaita and other sub-schools of Vedanta.S Biderman (1982), A 'Constitutive' God: An Indian Suggestion, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 32, No. 4, pages 425-437AL Herman (1971), Indian Theodicy: ≈öa·πÅkara and RƒÅmƒÅnuja on Brahma S≈´tra II. 1. 32-36, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 21, No. 3, pages 265-281 The monist Advaita school holds that ignorance or Avidya (wrong knowledge) is the root of \\"problem of evil\\"; in contrast, dualistic Vedanta schools hold karma and samsara to be the root.Stephen Kaplan (2007), VidyƒÅ and AvidyƒÅ: Simultaneous and Coterminous?: A Holographic Model to Illuminate the Advaita Debate, Philosophy East and West, Volume 57, Number 2, pages 178-203 The atomistic physico-theological theories of Vaisheshika and Samkhya school are the focus of the first seventeen sutras of Pada 2.2. The theories of Buddhism are refuted in sutras 2.2.18 through 2.2.32, while the theories of Jainism are analyzed by the text in sutras 2.2.33 through 2.2.36. The theories of other orthodox traditions are discussed in 2.2.37 through 2.2.45. Ramanuja and Shankara disagree in their formulation as well as critique of then extant orthodox traditions, in their respective commentaries, but both agree that the theory on emergence of Pradyumna (intellect) in the competing orthodox system is the primary flaw.George Thibaut, Vedanta Sutras Part 1, , Volume 34 (Editor: Max Muller), Oxford University Press, page li The first eight case studies in the third Pada of chapter 2 discuss whether the world has an origin or not, whether the universe is co-eternal with Brahman or is an effect of Brahman (interpreted as dualistic God in theistic sub-schools of Vedanta), and whether the universe returns into Brahman periodically. The last nine Adhikaranas of the third Pada discuss the nature of soul, whether it is eternal, is soul an agent, soul's relationship to Brahman, and states its proof that the soul exists and is immortal.Paul Deussen (1993), The System of the Vedanta: According to Badarayana's Brahma-Sutras and Shankara's Commentary thereon, Translator: Charles Johnston, , pages 285-354 The last Pada of the second chapter extracts and summarizes the theories of human body, sensory organs, action organs and their relationship to Prana (vital breath) in the various Vedic Brahmanas and Upanishads.George Thibaut, Vedanta Sutras Part 1, , Volume 34 (Editor: Max Muller), Oxford University Press, pages lixGeorge Thibaut, Vedanta Sutras Part 2, The Sacred Books of the East, Volume 38 (Editor: Max Muller), Oxford University Press, pages 74-100 The Brahma S≈´tras states that the organs inside a living being are independent principles, in the seventh and eighth Adhikarana of the fourth Pada. The various sub-schools of Vedanta interpret the sutras in the fourth Pada differently. Chapter 3: The means to spiritual knowledge The Vedanta texts, state sutras 3.1.1-4 and 3.3.5-19 of Brahmasutra, describe different forms of meditation. These should be combined, merged into one and practiced, because there is nondifference of their basic import, that of Self, mind, knowledge and a state.Klaus Witz (1998), The Supreme Wisdom of the Upani·π£ads: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 210-212Michael Comans (1993), The question of the importance of Samadhi in modern and classical Advaita Vedanta, Philosophy East & West, Volume 43, Number 1, pages 19-38 Third chapter (SƒÅdhana: the means): describes the process by which ultimate emancipation can be achieved. The topics discussed are diverse.Harshananda, Swami (2009), The Six Systems of Hindu Philosophy, A Primer, p.77 The third chapter is the longest and consists of 186 sutras, with six Adhikaranas in its first Pada, eight in second, thirty six in third, and fourteen Adhikaranas in the fourth Pada.George Thibaut, Vedanta Sutras Part 1, , Volume 34 (Editor: Max Muller), Oxford University Press, pages lix-lxxvi The third Brahma S≈´tras chapter focuses on the nature of spiritual knowledge and epistemic paths to it. The theory of death and rebirth,George Thibaut, Vedanta Sutras Part 2, The Sacred Books of the East, Volume 38 (Editor: Max Muller), Oxford University Press, pages 100-132 karma and importance of conduct and free will,George Thibaut, Vedanta Sutras Part 2, The Sacred Books of the East, Volume 38 (Editor: Max Muller), Oxford University Press, pages 112-121 and the connection between Atman (Self, Soul) and the Brahman are discussed in sections 3.1 and 3.2 of the text.George Thibaut, Vedanta Sutras Part 2, The Sacred Books of the East, Volume 38 (Editor: Max Muller), Oxford University Press, pages 133-183 Sections 3.3 and 3.4 describe the need for self-study, reflection of texts read, meditation, etc.,Klaus Witz (1998), The Supreme Wisdom of the Upani·π£ads: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 209-216 as steps while one makes progress and the role of sannyasa (monk, mendicant) in the pursuit of spiritual knowledge. ;Meditation The third pada, states George Thibaut, opens a new section and theme in chapter 3 of the Brahma S≈´tras, asserting that meditation is central to the Vedic texts, and summarizing the Vedic theories, from different Shakha (Vedic schools), on \\"how the individual soul is enabled by meditation on Brahman to obtain final release\\".George Thibaut, Vedanta Sutras Part 1, , Volume 34 (Editor: Max Muller), Oxford University Press, pages lxvi-lxxv These sutras constitute a significant part of the text, extensively refer to the oldest Upanishads, and their commentaries by different Vedanta sub-schools have been extensive, signifying the large historic tradition around meditation, and acceptance of Yoga-sutras teachings in Vedanta.Klaus Witz (1998), The Supreme Wisdom of the Upani·π£ads: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 198-200; See also, Francis X Clooney (1993), Theology After Vedanta: An Experiment in Comparative Theology, State University of New York Press, , pages 70-72 Meditation is defined in Vedanta texts of commentary on the Sutras, states Klaus Witz, as \\"a continuous succession of comparable basic conceptions, beliefs, not interspersed with dissimilar ones, which proceeds according to the scriptures and relates to an object enjoined in the scriptures\\". It is described by Vedantins as a practice of concentrating on an object of meditation, states Witz, a state of \\"absorption or immersion into essentially a single thought\\" and \\"concentrating on it, excluding conventional notions, till one if as completely identified with it as with one's body\\". While this practice is discussed in Vedic texts, their formulations were differently described by different Vedic schools. The Brahma-sutra, in Adhikaranas of third and fourth pada, states Thibaut, assert that there is no contradiction in these teachings and that \\"the different Upanishads have to be viewed as teaching the same matter, and therefore the ideas must be combined in one meditation\\". The most referred to texts in these sections are the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the Chandogya Upanishad, the Kaushitaki Upanishad, the Katha Upanishad, and the non-Upanishadic parts of Shatapatha Brahmana and Aitereya Aranyaka. The topic of meditation, state the Brahma-sutras, is the spiritual knowledge of Brahman; the object of this knowledge, states Thibaut, is \\"Brahman viewed as the inner Self of all\\".George Thibaut, Vedanta Sutras Part 1, , Volume 34 (Editor: Max Muller), Oxford University Press, pages lxxii-lxxiii The Brahma Sutras, in addition to recommending meditation, suggest that rituals and rites are unnecessary because it is knowledge that achieves the purpose. In sutras 3.4.26 and 3.4.27, the text adds that rituals, however, can spiritually prepare a mind, remove impurities within, empower calmness and distractions from sensory pursuits, and therefore assist in its ability to meditate and gain the ultimate knowledge.George Thibaut, Vedanta Sutras Part 2, The Sacred Books of the East, Volume 38 (Editor: Max Muller), Oxford University Press, pages 307-309 The text also discusses, in sutras 3.4.28 to 3.4.31 whether there are restrictions on food (meat) one can ingest, during the spiritual journey. The sutras, translates Thibaut, derive from the Vedic texts that there is \\"a prohibition of doing harm to any living creature\\", however, the scriptures state, \\"only in danger of life, in cases of highest need, food of any kind is permitted to be eaten\\".George Thibaut, Vedanta Sutras Part 2, The Sacred Books of the East, Volume 38 (Editor: Max Muller), Oxford University Press, pages 309-312 The last three sutras of the chapter 3 assert that a person, pursuing means to spiritual knowledge, should seek a childlike state of innocence, a psychological state that is free of anger, self-centeredness, pride and arrogance. The text declares that according to the Vedic literature knowledge is possible in this life, that one is one's own obstruction in this journey, that liberation and freedom is the fruit of knowledge.George Thibaut, Vedanta Sutras Part 2, The Sacred Books of the East, Volume 38 (Editor: Max Muller), Oxford University Press, pages 325-330 Chapter 4: The benefits of spiritual knowledge Fourth chapter (Phala: the result): talks of the state that is achieved in final emancipation. This is the shortest chapter with 78 sutras and 38 adhikaranas. The last chapter contains fourteen Adhikaranas in its first Pada, eleven in second, six in third, and seven Adhikaranas in the fourth.George Thibaut, Vedanta Sutras Part 1, , Volume 34 (Editor: Max Muller), Oxford University Press, pages lxxvi-lxxxv The last chapter of the Brahma S≈´tras discusses the need and fruits of self-knowledge, the state of freedom and liberation. The opening sutras of chapter 4 continue the discussion of meditation as means to knowledge, with sutra 4.1.3 summarizing it to be the state where the person accepts, \\"I am Brahman, not another being\\" (Adi Shankara), as \\"Thou indeed I am, O holy divinity, and I indeed thou art, O holy divinity\\" (Jabalas), and \\"God is to be contemplated as the Self\\" and the individual is as the body of God (Ramanuja).George Thibaut, Vedanta Sutras Part 2, The Sacred Books of the East, Volume 38 (Editor: Max Muller), Oxford University Press, pages 337-340Paul Deussen, The System of the Vedanta: According to Badarayana's Brahma-Sutras and Shankara's Commentary thereon, Translator: Charles Johnston, , pages 401-417 The liberated soul, asserts the Brahma S≈´tras, is of the nature of Brahman, with inner power and knowledge, free from evil, free from grief, free from suffering, one of bliss and \\"for such there is freedom in all worlds\\".George Thibaut, Vedanta Sutras Part 2, The Sacred Books of the East, Volume 38 (Editor: Max Muller), Oxford University Press, pages 407-411 Commentaries Numerous commentaries have been written on the Brahma S≈´tras text, but many such as that of Bodhayana, Upavarsa, and eighteen out of twenty one mentioned by Narayana in Madhvavijaya-bhava-prakashika are considered lost. Of the surviving commentaries, the earliest extant one is by Adi Shankara. The diversity of Brahma S≈´tras commentaries by various sub-schools of Hinduism (see table) attests to the central importance of the Upanishads, that the text summarizes. { align=\\"center\\" style=\\" background: transparent; \\" |+ Some commentaries on Brahma S≈´tras |-style=\\"text-align: center;\\" width=140px style=\\"background: #ffad66;\\" Scholar width=80px style=\\"background: #ffcc80;\\" Century width=100px style=\\"background: #ffcc80;\\" School width=100px style=\\"background: #ffcc80;\\" Sampradaya width= 140px style=\\"background: #ffcc80;\\" Theme/InfluenceSteven Katz (2000), Mysticism and Sacred Scripture, Oxford University Press, , page 12 |-style=\\"text-align: center;\\" width=140px Shankara width=80px 500 BC width=100px Advaita width=100px ? width= 140px Non-dualism |-style=\\"text-align: center;\\" width=140px Bhaskara, Yadava Prakasha width=80px 10th-century width=100px Bhedabheda width=100px ? width= 140px Bhakti movement |-style=\\"text-align: center;\\" width=140px Ramanuja width=80px 11th-century width=100px Vishishtadvaita width=100px Sri (Lakshmi) Sampradaya width= 140px Qualified Advaita Vaishnavism |-style=\\"text-align: center;\\" width=140px Madhva, also known as Purnaprajna and Ananda Teertha width=80px 13th-century width=100px Dvaita width=100px Bramha (Madhva)\\\\ Sampradaya width= 140px Dualism Vaishnavism |-style=\\"text-align: center;\\" width=140px Nimbarka width=80px 13th-century width=100px Dvaitadvaita width=100px Kumara Sampradaya width= 140px Differential monism |-style=\\"text-align: center;\\" width=140px Srikantha width=80px 3100 BC width=100px Shaivism width=100px Shaivism width= 140px Theistic Monism Saiva SiddhantaK Sivaraman (2001), ≈öaivism in Philosophical Perspective, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 33-36, 472-499Gavin Flood (1989), Shared Realities and Symbolic Forms in Kashmir ≈öaivism, Numen, Vol. 36, Fasc. 2, pages 225-247 |-style=\\"text-align: center;\\" width=140px Vallabha width=80px 16th-century width=100px Shuddhadvaita width=100px Rudra Sampradaya width= 140px Pure non-dualism |-style=\\"text-align: center;\\" width=140px Shuka width=80px 16th-century width=100px Bhedavada width=100px ? width= 140px Revised dualism |-style=\\"text-align: center;\\" |Baladeva Vidyabhushana (Gaudiya Vaishnavism) |16th-Century |AcintyabhedƒÅbheda width=100px Brahma-Madhva-Gaudiya Vaisnava Sampradaya width=100px |Inconceivable/Paradoxical Oneness and Difference |} Exegesis The sutras in the text can be, and have been read in different ways. Some commentators read each line separately, while others sometimes read two as one treating some sutras as contextually connected. Creative readers have read the last word of a sutra as the starting word for the next, some treat a given verse as Purva-paksha (opposing viewpoint) while others read the same verse as Siddhanta (proposed doctrine, or conclusion). For example, states Gregory Darling, Adi Shankara in his commentary on sutra 4.3.14 considers saguna Brahman mentioned therein as Purva-paksha, but acknowledges that some scholars interpret this sutra as a Siddhanta.Gregory Darling (2007), An Evaluation of the VedƒÅntic Critique of Buddhism, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 8 Translations The Brahma S≈´tras has been translated into German by Paul Deussen, and in English by George Thibaut.William Theodore De Bary and Ainslie Embree (2013), A Guide to Oriental Classics, Columbia University Press, , page 97 The Thibaut translation is, state De Bary and Embree, \\"probably the best complete translation in English\\". Vinayak Sakaram Ghate of Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute which has one of the largest collections of rare book manuscripts of India has analysed the Brahma Sutra commentaries of Nimbarka, Ramanuja, Vallabha, Adi Shankara and Madhvacharya in detail and has written the complete analysis with conclusion that Nimbarka's and Ramanuja's commentaries give the closest meaning of the Brahma Sutras taking into account of both kinds of Sutras, those which speak of oneness and those which speak of difference. He has also concluded that the commentaries of Shankara and Madhva give skewed interpretations when dealing with those sutras which deal with difference and oneness respectively. Influence The text is part of the Prasthanatrayi, or the three starting points for the Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy. The Brahma S≈´tras constitute the NyƒÅya prasthƒÅna (‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ø ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§æ‡§®) or \\"starting point of reasoning canonical base\\", while the Principal Upanishads constitute the Sruti prasthƒÅna or \\"starting point of heard scriptures\\", and the Bhagavad Gita constitutes the Smriti prasthƒÅna or the \\"starting point of remembered canonical base\\". The nature and influence of Brahma S≈´tras, states Paul Deussen, \\"stands to the Upanishad's in the same relation as the Christian Dogmatics to the New Testament: it investigates their teaching about God, the world, the soul, in its conditions of wandering and of deliverance, removes apparent contradictions of the doctrines, binds them systematically together, and is specially concerned to defend them against the attacks of the opponents\\".Paul Deussen, The System of the Vedanta: According to Badarayana's Brahma-Sutras and Shankara's Commentary thereon, Translator: Charles Johnston, , pages 20-21 The Vedas, according to Vedanta, consists of two parts, states Deussen, which show \\"far reaching analogy with the Old and New Testaments\\", a Part of Works (karma-kanda) which includes the benedictory mantras, sacrifices and ceremonies like the Old Testament, and a Part of Knowledge (jnana-kanda) which focuses on metaphysical questions about the world, creator, soul, theology, morals and virtues like the New Testament. The respective influence of the two documents, of the New Testament on Christianity, and the Brahma S≈´tras on Hinduism has been very significant. This analogy of influence has many common elements but, states Arvind Sharma, there are differences in the role and influence of New Testament in Christianity and the Brahma S≈´tras in the Hindu traditions, because in Hinduism texts were never considered as closed, the means and the meaning of soteriology differed, and a diversity of ideas on duality and monism as well as God was accepted.Arvind Sharma (1995), The Philosophy of Religion and Advaita Vedanta, Penn State University Press, , pages 62-71 The impact of Brahma S≈´tras text on Vedanta, and in turn Hinduism, has been historic and central, states Nakamura:Hajime Nakamura (2004), A History of Early VedƒÅnta Philosophy, Part 2, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 3 Frithjof Schuon states the role of Brahma S≈´tras in Hinduism as follows,  See also  * Prasthanatrayi Notes References External links ;Translations and transliteration * The Vedanta Sutras Part 1, Translated by George Thibaut (English, 1890, Adi Shankara Exegesis, Theistic interpretation) * The Vedanta Sutras Part 2, Translated by George Thibaut (English, 1890, Adi Shankara Exegesis, Theistic interpretation) * The Vedanta Sutras Translated by George Thibaut (English, 1890, Ramanuja Exegesis, Theistic interpretation) *Comparative analysis of traditional commentaries on Brahma Sutras. https://archive.org/download/in.ernet.dli.2015.283844/2015.283844.The- Vedanta.pdf * Brahma Sutra, The Philosophy of Spiritual Life (English) Translated by Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (English, Multiple scholars includes monist and theistic interpretation), - at archive.org * Brahma sutra in 10 Indian languages and Roman Transliteration IIT Kanpur ;Commentaries * Sri Bhashya - Brahma Sutra Bhashya by Ramanujacharya (Sanskrit) - at archive.org * Brahma Sutra Bhashya by Adi Shankaracharya (Sanskrit) - at archive.org * Brahmasutra Sankara Bhashya, with Ratna-Prabha of Govindananda, Bhamati of Vachaspati Misra and Nyaya-Nirnaya of Anandagari (Sanskrit) - at archive.org * Brahmasutra Sankara Bhashya, with Bhamati of Vachaspati Misra, Kalpataru of Amalananda and Parimala of Appaya Dikshita (Sanskrit) - at archive.org * Anubhashya on the Brahma Sutra by Vallabhacharya with Commentaries (4 Volumes Combined) (Sanskrit) - at archive.org * Brahmasutra Bhasya of Sri Madhvacharya with Glosses (Sanskrit) - at archive.org * Vedanta-Parijata-Saurabha of Nimbarka and Vedanta-Kaustubha of Srinivasa (English) - at archive.org [or Proofread edition including glossary] Category:Hindu texts Category:Vedanta Category:Sutra literature Category:Sanskrit texts Category:Ancient Indian literature ","title":"Brahma Sutras"},{"id":"1102645","text":"HMAS Perth (FFH 157) is an Anzac-class frigate of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

Around the same time, the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) was looking to replace four Leander-class frigates; a deterioration in New Zealand-United States relations, the need to improve alliances with nearby nations, and the commonalities between the RAN and RNZN ships' requirements led the two nations to begin collaborating on the acquisition in 1987.Greener, Timing is everything, pp. 23‚Äì9Jones, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 245 Tenders were requested by the Anzac Ship Project at the end of 1986, with 12 ship designs (including an airship) submitted.Greener, Timing is everything, p. 30 By August 1987, the tenders were narrowed down in October to Blohm + Voss's MEKO 200 design, the M class (later Karel Doorman class) offered by Royal Schelde, and a scaled-down Type 23 frigate proposed by Yarrow Shipbuilders.Greener, Timing is everything, p. 31 In 1989, the Australian government announced that Melbourne-based shipbuilder AMECON (which became Tenix Defence) would build the modified MEKO 200 design.Grazebrook, Anzac frigates sail diverging courses The Australians ordered eight ships, while New Zealand ordered two, with an unexercised option for two more.Wertheim (ed.), The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World, p. 20Greener, Timing is everything, pp. 43‚Äì4 The Anzacs are based on Blohm + Voss' MEKO 200 PN (or Vasco da Gama class) frigates, modified to meet Australian and New Zealand specifications and maximise the use of locally built equipment.Wertheim, The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World, pp. 20‚Äì1 Each frigate has a full load displacement.Sharpe (ed.), Jane's Fighting Ships 1998‚Äì99, pgs. 25, 470 The ships are long at the waterline, and long overall, with a beam of , and a full load draught of .

During February and March 2015, an MH-60R Seahawk Romeo helicopter from 725 Squadron RAN was embarked aboard Perth for at-sea trials of the new helicopter. In June of 2016 Perth was deployed to the Middle East Region on Operation Manitou as part of the coalition taskforce to stop criminal activities such as piracy and drug trafficking. Perth was the Royal Australian Navy's 63rd ship rotation since 1991.

He personally saved the U.S. government from financial collapse during the War of 1812, and became one of the wealthiest people in America, estimated to have been the fourth richest American of all time, based on the ratio of his fortune to contemporary GDP.In Fortune Magazine: \\"richest Americans: , with an estimated wealth at death of $7,500,000 Girard's Wealth/GDP ratio equalled 1/150. Childless, he devoted much of his fortune to philanthropy, particularly the education and welfare of orphans. His legacy is still felt in his adopted home of Philadelphia.Wildes, 1943. Early life Girard was born in Bordeaux, France on 21 May 1750 the son of a common sailor.Robert Chambers' Book of Days vol 2. p.767 He lost the sight of his right eye at the age of eight and had little education. He travelled to New York as a cabin boy in 1760 and stayed there, working in the coastal trader system along the east coast and as far south as the Caribbean.Robert Chambers Book of Days vol.2 p.766 He was licensed as a captain in 1773, visited California in 1774, and thence with the assistance of a New York merchant began to trade to and from New Orleans and Port au Prince. In May 1776, he was driven into the port of Philadelphia by a British fleet and settled there running a grocery and liquor shop. By 1790, he had a fortune of ¬£6000 plus a small fleet of trading vessels. In 1791 his ships at St Domingo in Haiti were involved in trying to salvage goods for European slave owners during the slave revolt. It was claimed that he was left with ¬£10.000 of goods stowed on his ships, the owners of which were massacred, He said he could not trace any owners for the goods and so they were conveniently added to his own possessions.Robert Chambers Book of Days vol2. p.767 Marriage In 1776, Girard met Mary Lum, a Philadelphia native nine years his junior. They married soon afterwards, and Girard purchased a home at 211 Mill Street in Mount Holly Township, New Jersey. She was the daughter of John Lum, a shipbuilder who died three months before the marriage. In 1778 Girard became a resident of Pennsylvania. By 1785 Mary had begun succumbing to sudden, erratic emotional outbursts. Mental instability and violent rages ensued, leading to a diagnosis of incurable mental instability. Though Girard was initially devastated, by 1787 he took a mistress, Sally Bickham. In August 1790 Girard committed his wife to the Pennsylvania Hospital (today part of the University of Pennsylvania) as an incurable lunatic. He provided her every luxury for comfort, she gave birth to a girl whose sire is not entirely certain. The child, baptized with the name Mary, died a few months later while under the care of Mrs. John Hatcher, who had been hired by Girard as a nurse. Girard spent the remainder of his life with mistresses. Yellow fever In 1793, there was an outbreak of yellow fever in Philadelphia. Although many other well-to-do citizens chose to leave the city, Girard stayed to care for the sick and dying. He supervised the conversion of a mansion outside the city limits into a hospital and recruited volunteers to nurse victims, and personally cared for patients. For his efforts, Girard was feted as a hero after the outbreak subsided. Again during the yellow fever epidemic of 1797-1798 he took the lead in relieving the poor and caring for the sick. Girard Bank Steel engraving of Stephen Girard by Alonzo ChappelAfter the charter for the First Bank of the United States expired in 1811, Girard purchased most of its stock and its facilities on South Third Street in Philadelphia, and reestablished it under his direct personal ownership. He hired George Simpson, the cashier of the First Bank, as cashier of the new bank, and with seven other employees, opened for business on May 18, 1812. He allowed the Trustees of the First Bank of the United States to use some offices and space in the vaults to continue the process of winding down the affairs of the closed bank at a very nominal rent. Although Pennsylvania law prohibited an association of individuals from banking without a charter, it made no such prohibition on a single individual doing so. Philadelphia banks balked at accepting the notes that Girard issued on his personal credit and lobbied the state to force him to incorporate, without success. Girard's Bank was a principal source of government credit during the War of 1812 an outstanding $1 million. Towards the end of the war, when the financial credit of the U.S. government was at its lowest, Girard placed nearly all of his resources at the disposal of the government and underwrote up to 95 percent of the war loan issue, which enabled the United States to carry on the war. After the war, he became a large stockholder in and one of the directors of the Second Bank of the United States. Girard's bank became the Girard Trust Company, and later Girard Bank. It merged with Mellon Bank in 1983, and was largely sold to Citizens Bank two decades later. Its monumental headquarters building still stands at Broad and Chestnut Streets in Philadelphia. Death, will and legacy Statue in Stephen Girard Park, Philadelphia, PA On December 22, 1830, Stephen Girard was seriously injured while crossing the street near Second and Market Streets in Philadelphia. He was knocked down by a horse and wagon, and one of its wheels ran over the left side of his face, lacerating his cheek and ear, as well as damaging his good (left) eye. Despite his age (81), he got up unassisted and returned to his nearby home, where a doctor dressed his wound. He threw himself back into his banking business, although he remained out of sight for two months. Nevertheless, he never fully recovered and he died on December 26, 1831, coincidentally the Feast of St. Etienne--St. Stephen's Day in the Western Church. He was buried in the vault he built for his nephew in the Holy Trinity Catholic cemetery, then at Sixth and Spruce Streets. Twenty years later, his remains were re-interred in the Founder's Hall vestibule at Girard College behind a statue by Nicholas Gevelot, a French sculptor living in Philadelphia. At the time of his death, Girard was the wealthiest man in America. Michael Klepper and Robert Gunther, in their book The Wealthy 100, posit that, with adjustment for inflation, Girard was the fourth-wealthiest American of all time as of 1996, behind John D. Rockefeller, Cornelius Vanderbilt and John Jacob Astor. He left $1,800,000. He was an atheist all the way up to his death, and he included his views on religion in his last testament. Girard's will was contested by his family in France but was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in a landmark case, Vidal et al. vs Girard's Executors, 43 U.S. 127 (1844). He bequeathed nearly his entire fortune to charitable and municipal institutions of Philadelphia and New Orleans, including an endowment of $400,000 for establishing a boarding school for \\"poor, male, white orphans\\" in Philadelphia, primarily those who were the children of coal miners, which opened as the Girard College in 1848. Girard also made a bequest of $10,000 to the public schools of Philadelphia, with the income from its investment to be used for the purchase of books for the school libraries, and a bequest for the establishment of funds to procure medals for deserving pupils.The Public Schools of Philadelphia: Historical, Biographical, Statistical by John Trevor Custis, Burk & McFetridge Co.

The pressure of the magma is high enough that the overlying strata are forced upward and folded, giving the laccolith a dome or mushroom-like form (or possibly conical or wedge-shape) with a generally planar base. Over time, erosion can form small hills and even mountains around a central peak since the magma rock is likely more resistant to weathering than the host rock. The growth of laccoliths can take as little as a few months when associated with a single magma injection event, or up to hundreds or thousands of years by multiple magmatic pulses stacking sills on top of each other and deforming the host rock incrementally. thumb|upright=1.3Basic types of intrusions: 1\\\\. Laccolith 2\\\\. Small dike 3\\\\. Batholith 4\\\\. Dike 5\\\\. Sill 6\\\\. Volcanic neck, pipe 7\\\\. Lopolith Note: As a general rule, in contrast to the smoldering volcanic vent in the figure, these names refer to the fully cooled and usually millions-of-years- old rock formations, which are the result of the underground magmatic activity shown. Etymology The term was first applied as laccolite by Grove Karl Gilbert after his study of intrusions of diorite in the Henry Mountains of Utah in about 1875. The word laccolith derived in 1875--1880, from Greek, l√°kko(s), meaning pond, plus -lith, meaning stone. Where laccoliths form Laccoliths tend to form at relatively shallow depths and in some cases are formed by relatively viscous magmas, such as those that crystallize to diorite, granodiorite, and granite. In those cases cooling underground may take place slowly, giving time for larger crystals to form in the cooling magma. In other cases less viscous magma such as shonkinite may form phenocrysts of augite at depth, then inject through a vertical feeder dike that ends in a laccolith.\\"Beall, Joseph J.\\" \\"Pseudo-Rhythmic Layering in the Square Butte Alkali-Gabbro Laccolith.\\" American Mineralogist. 57:7-8 (July‚ÄìAugust 1972). The surface rock above laccoliths often erodes away completely, leaving the core mound of igneous rock. Examples The filled and solidified magma chamber of Torres del Paine (Patagonia) is one of the best exposed laccoliths, built up incrementally by horizontal granitic and mafic magma intrusions over 162 ¬± 11 thousand years. Horizontal sheeted intrusions were fed by vertical intrusions. The small Barber Hill syenite- stock laccolith in Charlotte, Vermont, has several volcanic trachyte dikes associated with it. Molybdenite is also visible in outcrops on this exposed laccolith. In Big Bend Ranch State Park, at the southwesternmost visible extent of the Ouachita orogeny, lies the Solitario. It consists of the eroded remains of a laccolith, presumably named for the sense of solitude that observers within the structure might have, due to the partial illusion of endless expanse in all directions. One of the largest laccoliths in the United States is Pine Valley Mountain in the Pine Valley Mountain Wilderness area near St. George, Utah. Problems reconstructing shapes of intrusions The original shape of intrusions can be difficult to reconstruct. For instance, Devils Tower in Wyoming and Needle Rock in Colorado were both thought to be volcanic necks, but further study has suggested they are eroded laccoliths. At Devils Tower, intrusion would have had to cool very slowly so as to form the slender pencil-shaped columns of phonolite porphyry seen today. However, erosion has stripped away the overlying and surrounding rock, so it is impossible to reconstruct the original shape of the igneous intrusion, which may or may not be the remnant of a laccolith. At other localities, such as in the Henry Mountains and other isolated mountain ranges of the Colorado Plateau, some intrusions demonstrably have the classic shapes of laccoliths. On Earth's moon There are many examples of possible laccoliths on the surface of the Moon. These igneous features may be confused with impact craters.

She was laid down in 2002 by Tenix Defence Systems and commissioned in 2005. In 2007, Toowoomba was deployed to the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Slipper. Her second deployment to the Middle East occurred during the second half of 2009. As part of this, she became the first RAN vessel to operate with the counter-piracy Combined Task Force 151.

Around the same time, the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) was looking to replace four Leander-class frigates; a deterioration in New Zealand-United States relations, the need to improve alliances with nearby nations, and the commonalities between the RAN and RNZN ships' requirements led the two nations to begin collaborating on the acquisition in 1987.Greener, Timing is everything, pp. 23‚Äì9Jones, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 245 Tenders were requested by the Anzac Ship Project at the end of 1986, with 12 ship designs (including an airship) submitted.Greener, Timing is everything, p. 30 By August 1987, the tenders were narrowed down in October to Blohm + Voss's MEKO 200 design, the M class (later Karel Doorman class) offered by Royal Schelde, and a scaled-down Type 23 frigate proposed by Yarrow Shipbuilders.Greener, Timing is everything, p. 31 In 1989, the Australian government announced that Melbourne-based shipbuilder AMECON (which became Tenix Defense) would build the modified MEKO 200 design.Grazebrook, Anzac frigates sail diverging courses The Australians ordered eight ships, while New Zealand ordered two, with an unexercised option for two more.Wertheim (ed.), The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World, p. 20Greener, Timing is everything, pp. 43‚Äì4 Toowomba in 2018 The Anzacs are based on Blohm + Voss' MEKO 200 PN (or Vasco da Gama-class) frigates, modified to meet Australian and New Zealand specifications and maximise the use of locally built equipment.Wertheim, The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World, pp. 20‚Äì1 Each frigate has a full load displacement.Sharpe (ed.), Jane's Fighting Ships 1998‚Äì99, pgs. 25, 470 The ships are long at the waterline, and long overall, with a beam of , and a full load draught of .

In June 2009, Toowoomba sailed from Fleet Base West, Western Australia to embark upon the ship's second MEAO deployment. In September, the frigate was assigned to Combined Task Force 151 (CTF-151); Toowoomba was the first Australian warship to work with CTF-151, a US-led, multinational force tasked with protecting merchant vessels from pirate attacks off the coast of Somalia.RAN Website, Counter-Piracy First for Toowoomba Toowoomba was assigned to escort merchant shipping and conduct overt patrols in the International Recommended Transit Corridor (IRTC), a shipping lane extending the Gulf of Aden towards the Somali Basin and the Horn of Africa, in support of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1846 and 1851. The frigate also operated with the counter-terrorism Combined Task Force 150 (CTF-150) in the Arabian Sea.

Colgan, The Sunday Business Post, 22 September 2002, retrieved 3 March 2009 In 1992, he was arrested for cocaine possession and soliciting while on a golf holiday in Florida, USA. His arrest triggered the end of his leadership of Dunnes Stores, as family turmoil led to control falling to his sister Margaret Heffernan and the company paying IR¬£100 million for Ben Dunne's share of the business. He was again embroiled in scandal in the mid-1990s when it emerged he had given large amounts of money to a number of Irish politicians, mainly from the Fianna F√°il party including the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey. He also gave money to Michael Lowry of Fine Gael. Mr Justice Brian McCracken, sole member of The McCracken Tribunal which was established by the Irish Government in 1997, found that Dunne knowingly assisted Lowry in evading his tax obligations. On 22 March 2011, the Moriarty Tribunal concluded of Ben Dunne's dealings with Michael Lowry that \\"What was contemplated and attempted on the part of Mr Dunne and Mr Lowry was profoundly corrupt to a degree that was nothing short of breathtaking\\": the report referring to its finding Lowry sought to influence a rent review of a building part-owned by Dunne.

Dunne was working on a new health club, to open in D√∫n Laoghaire in Dublin, but abandoned the project due to complaints from local residents. In April 2005 he paid ¬£3,000,000 for a site in Motspur Park, New Malden (South London), former home of BBC Football Club and other BBC sports facilities. His intent was to apply for planning permission to build a leisure and fitness centre, but he did not do so. Instead, in February 2008, his company Barkisland Developments Limited submitted a planning application to the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Council for change of use of the sports ground to a cemetery. The application to change the former BBC Sports Ground into a cemetery was withdrawn on 3 October 2008. It had become clear that planning permission was likely to be refused. Objections were lodged by many local residents, sports clubs, Sport England and the Mayor of London.

The Super Soaker was invented in 1989 by engineer Lonnie Johnson and designed by William Raucci. The prototype combined PVC pipe, acrylic glass, and an empty plastic soda bottle. Originally sold by Larami and now produced by Hasbro under the Nerf brand, Super Soaker has generated more than $1 billion in total sales. The first Super Soaker went on sale in 1990 and was originally called the Power Drencher, or the \\"Shaw\\" because of its ability to shoot straight and narrow. Rebranding the name to Super Soaker occurred in 1991 together with a series of TV advertisements that resulted in 2 million water guns being sold. Super Soakers were popular for many years‚Äîso popular, in fact, that the term super soaker is sometimes used generically, to refer to any type of toy pressurized water gun.  History  In 1982, Air Force and NASA engineer Lonnie Johnson conceived of the idea of a pressurized water gun after shooting a powerful stream of water in his bathroom while performing experiments for a new type of refrigeration system. Several months later he built a prototype in his basement, using Plexiglas, PVC pipe, O-ring seals and a two-litre soda bottle for the ample reservoir. Johnson originally wanted to produce the toy himself, but realized that the costs were out of his reach. He attempted to arrange partnerships with toy companies to bring the product to market, but it was not until 1989 that he found success. While at the American International Toy Fair in New York City, he met the vice president of the toy company Larami, who showed interest in the idea. In 1982, Johnson decided to shift his focus from his current scientific career at NASA to the Super Soaker because the Super Soaker could potentially create enough funding for his own research goals. The revenue that Lonnie received from the Super Soaker licensing provided enough money for Lonnie to create Johnson Research & Development Co., Inc.Smith, Monica. \\"Meet Lonnie Johnson, the Man Behind the Super Soaker\\". Lemelson Center. Smithsonian National Museum of American History. Retrieved 3 July 2017. Johnson then went home and built an improved prototype and made a trip to their headquarters in Philadelphia where he made a successful sales pitch. Refinements made with Larami design director, William Raucci, and engineering consultant, Bruce D'Andrade, made its mass production feasible, and the first commercial version of the water gun appeared in stores the following year as the Power Drencher. In 1991 it achieved commercial success under its new name, Super Soaker. Technology Piston pumper Piston water guns have been produced for many years. These guns do not have triggers; they are fired simply by pumping. Although this design feature allows them to reload rapidly, piston pumpers tend to have less range and less power than other designs. Air pressure (pressurized reservoir) Originally made popular by the Super Soaker 50, pressurized reservoir systems are still common for small water guns. A water gun using this system is pressurized by air being pumped and compressed into its reservoir. When the trigger is pulled, a valve is opened and the compressed air pushes the water out of the nozzle. Super Soaker started with two pressurized reservoir water guns, and has continued to produce them in various shapes and sizes. Air pressure (separate chamber) This is a more powerful air pressure system that was also first introduced by Super Soaker. It is designed so that water is pumped from the reservoir into an empty plastic container. As the water is pumped in, the air sitting inside becomes compressed. When the trigger is pulled, the valve opens and the compressed air forces the water out. The brand first used separate air pressure in 1991 on the Super Soaker 100 and has since used the technology in many other water guns. Spring-powered Super Soaker has made a few spring-powered water guns. They first made the Quick Blast in 2008. The Quick Blast was a triggerless gun which functioned similarly to piston pumpers, but had a spring-loaded piston inside. The Quick Blast had a firing valve, which automatically opened once a certain pressure was reached. The spring would then push the water out the nozzle. The Super Soaker Shot Blast, released in 2010, used a system nearly identical to the Quick Blast with different styling. In 2013, Super Soaker produced the Flash Blast. While this blaster was spring-powered, this pistol-sized blaster used a system different from the previous two. Its slide was cocked back once. Then the trigger was pulled, firing a short stream of water. Function of this gun is similar to Nerf guns. Motorized Super Soaker later made many motorized water guns. In 2011, they released the Thunderstorm, which used an electric pump to push water directly out the nozzle. In 2012, Super Soaker made two motorized water guns: The Lightningstorm, a reproduction of the Thunderstorm with added accessories, and the Electrostorm, a smaller motorized gun. Each required four AA batteries to run. CPS (Constant Pressure System) The Constant Pressure System is the most powerful system used by Super Soaker. The user pumps water from the reservoir into a rubber bladder, which expands as more water is forced into it. The stretched rubber exerts a constant pressure on the water, giving the blaster a thick and constant stream throughout the entire shot. In most older models, the resulting blast is forceful enough that recoil can be felt. Hasbro has implemented the Constant Pressure System in Super Soaker blasters a number of times since completing the takeover of Larami Corp in 2002. The most recent implementation was in the 2011 'Hydro Cannon', while the largest post-takeover pressure chamber (at 900ml) is found in the 2007 'HydroBlitz' blaster. Original series models of Super Soakers Airman using a Super Soaker The following are the original models of Super Soaker guns: ;Super Soaker 10 : Weighing in at less than 3 ounces, the SS10 was a sub-compact, pistol-type model that was easily concealable due to its small size (56 mL tank volume, model year 1993) ;Super Soaker 20 : The SS20 was a pistol-type model which came with an either a rear-mounted or a grip- mounted pump. (115 mL tank volume, model year 1992) ;Super Soaker 25 : Designed with the grip-mounted pump, the SS25 came with a belt and additional, surplus water tank. (177 mL tank volume, model year 1992) ;Super Soaker 30 : The original pistol-sized gun, the SS30 was released with the very first models in 1991. While only slightly heavier than the SS20, it holds more than twice the water in its reservoir. (265 mL tank volume, model year 1991) ;Super Soaker 40 : With a design similar to that of the classic SS50, the SS40 possessed somewhat more compact size dimensions. While it also came with a significantly smaller water reservoir, the SS40 was a later model of more durable construction and was touted on its accompanying packaging as \\"the most powerful watergun ever!\\" (490 mL tank volume, model year 1993) ;Super Soaker 50 : The original mid-size weapon, the SS50 was a best-selling model. Known for its impressive range due its novel air pressure system, the SS50 has become a cultural icon. In 2015, the SS50 was the model exemplified when the Super Soaker brand was nominated for the National Toy Hall of Fame. (730 mL tank volume, model year 1991) ;Super Soaker 60 : While still a mid-size weapon, the SS60 was one of the last of the original models and came designed more comparably to the SS100. With an enhanced nozzle, rugged construction, and a separate pressure chamber, the SS60 required less pumps to achieve maximum pressure. (890 mL tank volume, model year 1994) ;Super Soaker 100 : Befitting its triple-digit number designation, this larger-sized weapon was the biggest Super Soaker until the release of the SS200. It came with a weight and tank reservoir double that of most mid-sized models, and was accordingly known for its range and capacity. (1500 mL tank volume, model year 1991) ;Super Soaker 200 : The biggest and heaviest of all the original weapons until the release of the SS300, the Super Soaker 200 came with a carry-strap to increase its ergonomics. This model also came with dual full-size water tanks, a large pressure chamber, and multiple, adjustable nozzle settings. (2050 mL tank volume, model year 1992) ;Super Soaker 300 : Armed with 3 air-pressured firing chambers and a large 6.5 L tank, the backpack-fed Super Soaker 300 came with an appropriately wider nozzle-opening for increased output. While the model had some weight and durability issues, it possessed the ability to outclass all other models, particularly in terms of sheer water volume (6500 mL tank volume, model year 1993) Super Soaker CPS 2000 The Super Soaker CPS 2000 is a Constant Pressure System (CPS) class water gun released in 1996 by Larami. It was the first model in the CPS line, which initially included only a single blaster. Today, it is a sought-after and revered soaker by enthusiasts and members of the online community. It remains the most powerful stock water blaster sold in stores in terms of range and soakage, a title it took from the Super Soaker 300 and has held to today. The CPS 2000 has gained a reputation for its size and power, though it has been criticized for its low field life (shooting time between refills) depleting its pressure chamber in only 1 second and only being able to fire 4 or 5 such shots before needing to be refilled. An additional downside is the large number of pumps that it takes to fully pressurize (20-24 depending on version). The original version of the CPS 2000 was released in spring of 1996. Being the first water gun to ever sport a Constant Pressure System (CPS), it began what many refer to as the \\"third age of water wars\\" (the first beginning upon the release of the Super Soaker 50 in 1991 and the second after the Super Soaker 300 was released in 1993). The most powerful blaster of its time and still currently unmatched by commercial water guns, it sports a 25X water output (1X equals 1.2 oz/second). CPS 2000's warning label The CPS 2000 Mk2 was a replacement to the Mk1, with a tank capacity 33% smaller (20 oz) than the Mk1 (30 oz). Additionally, the Mk2 reportedly possessed poorer shot time, output, and range than the Mk1. The most visible differences between the two are; * The Mk1 has a much longer pressure gauge than the Mk2. * The Mk2 has a tethered reservoir cap to prevent loss, the Mk1's is untethered. * The pump handle on some Mk2s has a grey disc with a pin visible. This is absent on the Mk1. Awards In 2011, the Nerf Super Soaker Shot Blast was awarded \\"Outdoor Toy of the Year\\" at the 11th Annual Toy of the Year Awards, which is held at the American International Toy Fair in New York City. In 2015, Super Soaker was inducted to National Toy Hall of Fame. Legal issues In 2010, Buzz Bee Toys was successfully sued by Hasbro for patent infringement. Hasbro claimed that Buzz Bee Toys infringed on a patent related to its \\"Super Soaker water toy.\\" Although it is unknown exactly what the dispute was over, it is strongly suggested that Hasbro was suing for the Water Warriors Hydro-Power water guns, which were becoming too similar to Super Soaker's Constant Pressure System. Since then, the Water Warriors line has not contained a single Hydro-Power water gun. In November 2013, Lonnie Johnson and his company Johnson Research and Development Co. were awarded nearly US$73 million following a dispute with Hasbro over underpaid royalties from 2007 to 2012.

The Irish form Cill Chainnigh means \\"church of Canice\\". It is thought that the √ì Cionnaith sept was part of the U√≠ Maine kingdom, based in Connacht. Within this area, the name is associated traditionally with counties Galway and Roscommon. Kenny is ranked at number 76 in the list of the most common surnames in Ireland. Other spellings include O'Kenny, Kenney, Kennie, Kinnie and Kinny. The given name Kenny is most often used as a short form of the name Kenneth and a diminutive form of Ken but it is also used as a surname.

It is north-east of Wakefield and south-west of Castleford, and at the time of the 2011 Census, the population of the civil parish was 20,872, whilst the Normanton ward of the Wakefield City Council had a population of 16,220. History The Domesday Book gives information on 'Norman-tune' as: > In Normantune there are 10 carucates for geld, which 5 plows can plough. 2 > thegns had 2 manors there T.R.E.

Pestell, 1973 Normanton was originally surrounded by a moat, and in Norman times was the site of an enclosed settlement (chosen for its strategic view points across the surrounding area), and became known as 'Norman ‚Äì tune', or 'Norman ‚Äì ton'. At the time the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086, the colonisation of Yorkshire by the Normans was well underway. Archaeological evidence at today's Normanton points to Haw Hill (or How Hill), an eminence that was probably a Norman defensive strategic mound once reinforced by a wooden palisade.Normanton, Its Name, History of Normanton, wakefield.gov.uk The evidence of a Norman motte-and-bailey fortification at the town, and the name, is likely evidence that Normanton's name derived from the substantial Anglo- Norman presence in the area. Nearby, after all, were Tickhill, the fortress of Norman magnate Roger de Busli, as well as other new Norman power centres. Although the area had once been part of the Scandinavian Danelaw, William the Conqueror's scorched earth northern campaign had left the area ripe for exploitation by his Lords. By all measures, Normanton likely owes its name to these new aggressive warriors. Hanson House, Normanton, ca. 1890 One of the earliest buildings to survive within the village is Hanson House. This is set back from the church and has a timber frame construction. The building was constructed in the mid-15th century, with a later wing added in the 18th century. A fire has damaged the building, which is being restored and modernised. Growth All Saints' Parish Church rooms circa 1880 All Saints' Parish Church rooms in 2008 A grammar school was founded in Normanton by John Freeston (now the 'Parish Rooms'..later moved to the site of the, Normanton Junior School on Church Lane) in 1592,Pastell, Ibid. but the town remained very small until it became the focus of several railway lines in the mid-19th century. Work began in 1837 under the supervision of George Stephenson on the construction of the North Midland Railway from Derby to Leeds. This was soon followed by an addition to the York and North Midland Railway from York and then the Manchester and Leeds Railway from Manchester which all extended to Normanton thereby giving the town access to much of the country. The Leeds and Manchester lines crossed a stretch across the Pennines and at the time had the world's longest railway station platform at Normanton, a quarter of a mile long. The station was, for the next ten years or so, the most important in England, employing over 700 people who looked after the station's 700,000 passengers a year. In Victorian times Normanton station was one of the most important stations in Northern England, and Queen Victoria stopped over in the Station Hotel. The town also served as an important part of the transport infrastructure for national and local industries including coal and bricks, although most of this was lost during the 1950s and 1960s with the last remaining operational brickworks eventually closing in the mid-1990s. There were three brickworks in town which were all built within the small area of Newland, taking advantage of the abundance of clay from the area. A fourth works was founded in the 1890s by a Thomas Kirk from Nottingham, who had heard rumours that Normanton was rapidly turning into an important junction on the railways. Both Kirk and his sons used their life savings and formed the Normanton Brick Company at nearby Altofts which finally closed in 2011 The coming of the railways enabled the locally mined coal to be sent across the country. Demand soon outstripped supply and many more shafts were sunk to reach the coal seams under the town. In 1871 Dom Pedro, the Emperor of Brazil, visited Normanton with his Empress and gave his name (in a slightly altered form) to the Don Pedro Colliery at Hopetown. Today roads in the area of the former colliery retain the name. At their peak the collieries employed over 10,000 men, most of whom wanted to move themselves and their families to Normanton. The town enjoyed a boom period with more mines opening and more shafts being sunk in order to meet the increasing demand for coal until, by the mid-1970s, most coal seams in the Normanton area were worked- out. Decline The disputes surrounding the miners' strike of 1984‚Äì85 meant that many mines across the country were to close although by this stage there were no collieries still in production in Normanton. However, the strike still affected many families in the area, as Normanton colliers still worked in pits in neighbouring towns. The area once occupied by the St John's or Newland Colliery is now part of the controversial Welbeck landfill site which has been the subject of both local and national media attention since its development as a toxic tip. The site attracted so much negative attention that the group Residents Against Toxic Scheme (RATS) was established to halt planning permission for the disposal of toxic chemicals at the site, claiming the scheme was an extreme health hazard. Normanton suffered decline in the years following the miners' strike. The railway station was in such a state of neglect and disrepair that the decision was made to demolish it in 1986; the section of railway line between Goosehill Junction and Crofton Interchange were lifted the year after. Very little now remains of Normanton's railway and mining heritage. Modern Normanton has become a growing commuter suburb of the Leeds City Region, with relatively cheap housing and efficient transport links. The town is still accessible via Normanton railway station, and is currently served by an unmanned island platform station with regular trains to Leeds, Castleford, Wakefield and Sheffield Meadowhall Interchange. The addition and expansion of the Eurolink Industrial Estate at Junction 31 of the M62 attracted national and multi-national corporations to locate their distribution depots to Normanton. Being centrally located within the UK, the town is served by three major motorway networks: the M62 linking Liverpool to Hull (west to east); the M1 linking Leeds to London (North to South); and the North of England via a new link between the M62 and the A1(M) at nearby Ferrybridge. Landmarks Church All Saints' Church, Normanton All Saints' is the Church of England parish church of Normanton, West Yorkshire. It is believed to have existed since at least 1256 and is built in the Perpendicular style. Newland The Newland estate was a small township on the outskirts of Normanton and lies on the north bank of the River Calder. Existing since 1213 when it was established by King John as a preceptory of the Knights Templar, it was later transferred to the similar organisation, the \\"Knights Hospitaller\\" in 1256. The property belonging to the Hospitallers was dissolved by King Henry VIII who bestowed the property upon himself. The earliest known preceptor of the Knights Hospitaller was Simon Paccable in 1313. Newland was once held by the Levett family, and William Levett, who was lord of the manor, was admitted tenant of the Knights Hospitaller on 2 October 1447. The estate changed hands of ownership a number of times since King Henry VIII sold the land in 1544, with final ownership landing on the Warmfield Company Limited in 1926, who ran brickworks until the mid-20th century. Newland today is kept as a nature reserve, with the remains of the estate overgrown with shrubs and plant life, the remains of Newland Hall still stand in the woodlands as a derelict building that last saw occupancy in 1972. A small fishing area just outside the Newland Estate is used by local fishermen.  Transport  Normanton is just off of Junction 31 of the M62. It has a railway station, Normanton Railway Station. The town is on bus routes and is served by taxi and minibus companies.  Education  The following is a list of schools in Normanton: * Normanton All Saints Primary School * Normanton Junior School * Normanton Outwood Academy Freeston (FKA Freeston Business and Enterprise College and Freeston High School) * Woodhouse First School (now Newlands Primary) * Woodlands Middle School (now Newlands Primary) * Altofts Junior School * Normanton Common Primary Academy * St John the Baptist Catholic Primary School * Martin Frobisher Primary School * Lee Brigg Primary School Sports The town is home to a cricket club ‚Äì Normanton St John's CC, and 2 football teams ‚Äì A.S.

The structure was intact but abandoned at the time of filming and was the ideal location favoured by the ITV production team. In the series a body was found by the Police in one of the factory's old kilns. Within 18 months of filming, the structure had been declared unsafe, and was partially demolished, leaving only the chimney stack standing.

He is considered to be one of the \\"Fathers of Italian football\\", due to his association with Genoa CFC and his contribution to the modern day variation of the game in Italy. Biography He was born in 1867 in the Stoke Newington district of London to William Spensley and Elizabeth Alice Richardson. Although he was born and grew up in London, the Spensley family were originally from the Swaledale area in Yorkshire. Richardson Spensley had the opportunity to travel far and wide as an adult. Amongst the most keen interests which he had acquired whilst travelling were oriental religion, languages (he was versed in Greek and Sanskrit), boxing and football. In addition to working as a doctor, he spent some time as a correspondent for the British newspaper the Daily Mail. Football in Genoa Richardson Spensley arrived in Genoa in 1896, initially for the purpose of curing English sailors on the coal ships. He joined Genoa Cricket & Athletics Club, a cricket and athletics club formed by British expatriates. He opened the footballing section for the club on 10 April 1897 and was put in place as its first ever manager. This was innovative as the modern day footballing scene in Italy was in its embryonic stages: if not for Edoardo Bosio in Turin founding clubs, there would have been no football at all in Italy at Richardson Spensley's time of arrival. Richardson Spensley participated as a player-manager for Genoa in the first ever Italian Football Championship (which he initiated) during 1898 which his club won. The following season, he switched position from defender to goalkeeper, playing on until 1906. Including the first title, Genoa won the Italian league six times while Richardson Spensley was at the helm. After retiring from playing when he was almost 40 years old, he stayed on in the management role for one more year, before leaving entirely. Scouting and death While living in England he had known Robert Baden- Powell who founded the Scout Movement, from whom he had received an autographed copy of Scouting for Boys. Along with a Genovese man named Mario Mazza, they founded the first Italian scouting movement called Federazione Italiana dello Scautismo in 1910. During World War I, he worked in the medical field putting his scouting abilities to use as a lieutenant in the Royal Army Medical Corps. He was injured on the battle field while tending to the wounds of an enemy out of compassion. He died at Mainz, Germany in hospital not long after. His body was one of many moved in 1922 from smaller graveyards to larger cemeteries in Germany (no British bodies were returned to Britain). Spensley was reburied at Niederzwehren War Cemetery south of Kassel.

The parish includes the small town of High Bentham, occasionally known as Higher Bentham or just Bentham, and the older adjacent village of Low Bentham. The town lies on the River Wenning, just west of the Yorkshire Dales National Park and on the northern edge of the Forest of Bowland. The original centre of the town lay in Low Bentham, but a market was granted to High Bentham in the 14th century, and it became a centre for weaving from the 18th century, particularly after weavers in the town discovered how to weave hosepipes from flax.  Governance  An electoral ward of the same name exists. This ward includes Burton in Lonsdale and well as the Bentham (Town) ward and has a total population taken at the 2011 census of 3,606. The ward falls within the Skipton and Ripon parliamentary constituency. The Bentham Town Council is responsible for local matters and the Town Hall built in 1894. This facility includes several bookable spaces used by community groups and available for hire on a private basis as well as housing the town's tourist information centre. Airedale NHS Foundation Trust is the responsible trust for health matters for the population across the civil parish. Bentham Medical Centre is located centrally within the town. Community The town has hosted an agricultural show since the middle of the 19th century. The show, which take place annually on the first Saturday of September, is a traditional agricultural show with handicraft and horticulture as well as sheep, cattle and poultry competitions, but no horse classes. The 146th Bentham Agricultural Show was held in 2018 at the Bentham Auction Mart. In addition to the traditional agricultural show, the town also hosts an annual Carnival procession in June of each year. In addition to a themed street parade, the event usually culminates with a funfair and stalls hosted at the Bentham Auction Mart. The town's Auction Mart was founded in 1903 and provides an important venue for community events as well as regular livestock sales. The site hosts bonfire night fireworks and Christmas market events in addition to the Agricultural Show and Carnival. Bentham is served by Bentham Community Primary School, which caters for children aged three to eleven and, as of 2016 had just under 150 students on its roll. The Bentham News is the monthly community publication for the town. Established in 1982 the publication currently circulates over 2,000 copies which are delivered free by volunteers to every household in Bentham. The publication is also available at central points in the town and outlying areas.  Walking: Heritage Trails  Bentham has several circular heritage trails. There are three trails in total and these are colour coded, purple, pink and blue. The Purple Trail is long with a route through Ridding Lane Farm and over Shaky Bridge. This route is largely on footpaths and includes a number of stone styles along a circular route along the Wenning valley. The Pink Trail is long and extends the purple trail further along the river valley and also passes close by the Old Quarry in the northeast of the town, with a short section, about , on the road. The Blue Trail is the longest of the three trails at over . This route climbs up out of the town to the South and into the Forest of Bowland. The route included several ladder styles, and takes in the Great Stone of Fourstones, known locally as Big Stone where walkers can take in impressive views of the Yorkshire Three Peaks.  Public houses and eateries  High Bentham has several pubs: the Black Bull, the Hogs and Heifers, The Horse and Farrier, and The Coach House (known previously called The Brown Cow). The town's pubs, and Working Mens Club play host to a number of events. Low Bentham has two pubs, the Sundial and the Punch Bowl. There are also two Bar/Eateries called The Black Pig and The Angus Depot, several cafes and an Indian restaurant and takeaway.  Railway  The Leeds to Morecambe railway passes through the unmanned Bentham Station. The station was opened in 1850 and has about 18,000 users per year. When it first opened it was owned by the \\"Little\\" North Western Railway, it was later bought by the Midland Railway and is now operated by Northern. The station is supported Friends of Bentham Station (FOBS), a community group which has formally registered a stakeholder interest with Northern Rail. Churches There are two churches in High Bentham: St Boniface Roman Catholic Church and Bentham Methodist Chapel. St John the Baptist Church and Bentham Quakers Meeting House are in Low Bentham. Bentham has several youth groups for teenagers including the Bentham Youth Caf√© (BYC) which is on the Main Street and Monday's Youth Club which is organised by 4Youth. There are also separate youth drop-in sessions on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursdays of each week which are also run by and held at the Youth Cafe. For younger children Springboard and Adventurers groups are held at the Methodist Church. St Margaret's Church in High Bentham closed in 2013 due to the building being unstable and a failure to raise sufficient funds for repairs. St John the Baptist Church St John the Baptist church St John the Baptist Church is one of the oldest churches in the area, and was noted in the Domesday Book in 1086. During restoration work in the 19th century, a Saxon cross was discovered in the wall of the tower, and blackened stones in the tower wall are evidence that it was almost totally destroyed by fire after the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. The church contains a display of Tudor glass, which is similar to some of the glass in York Minster. The present building was built in the 1870s by Richard Norman Shaw, and includes an ancient coffin slab dating from about 1340; the Kirkbeck Stone dating from the 17th century; a 15th-century bell hanging in the porch; and a reredos in Caen stone with marble panels. The church reputedly has the heaviest peal of six bells in Yorkshire, and together weigh . The old organ, which is no longer playable, was built by William Hill of London as a \\"house organ\\" for Walker Joy, a prosperous oil merchant in Leeds; his brother designed a hydraulic engine to pump the bellows, making it the first ever to be blown by mechanical power. The churchyard contains a memorial to Robert Poole, a gravedigger, consisting of a sculptured shovel leaning against a tree trunk. It is a grade II* listed building. Golf Club Bentham Golf Club is located on Robin Lane to the northern edge of the town. The Club has an 18-hole course which was established in the 1920s plus a driving range and 'footgolf' course. The course is set in the countryside to the south of the Three Peaks and is privately owned.

It especially focuses on the Three Angels' Messages of Revelation 14. Beginning as a radio program dedicated to Christian evangelism, it has expanded into television programming, training, lifestyle, educational, health, prophecy seminars and online Bible study ministries. History Amazing Facts was founded in 1965 by Joe Crews in Baltimore, Maryland. Inspired by the success of The Rest Of The Story, hosted by Paul Harvey, Joe Crews' original objective for Amazing Facts was to reach out to both Christian and non-Christian listeners via daily 15-minute programs by opening with a scientific or historic fact, and how it applies to the overall Biblical messages. Later, the program offered accompanying home Bible study courses, as well as books written by Crews himself. In 1987, Amazing Facts initiated a television ministry that has expanded to four programs as well as periodic evangelism series. Shortly before his death in 1994, Crews invited Douglas Edward Batchelor (better known as simply Doug Batchelor) to assume the position of president/speaker, which he holds to this day. Today, the Amazing Facts radio program \\"Bible Answers Live\\" broadcasts mainly out of Sacramento, California each Sunday evening to about 155 national stations. Media programming Amazing Facts programming is available on a variety of over-the-air, cable and satellite stations In addition, programs are archived on the website.

Richards, Sr., is a Seventh- day Adventist religious radio ministry headquartered in Loveland, Colorado. Initially airing in 1929 on a single radio station in Los Angeles the Voice of Prophecy has since grown to numerous stations throughout the United States and Canada. It was one of the first religious programs in the United States to broadcast nationally. Under the leadership of Shawn and Jean Boonstra, the ministry has now expanded into additional forms of media, including the weekly Disclosure broadcast and Discovery Mountain radio adventure series for kids. Additional projects include humanitarian efforts in countries such as India and Myanmar. History H.M.S. Richards, Sr. began a regular radio program on October 19, 1929 on KNX (AM) in Los Angeles. Richards earliest studio was his South Gate Tabernacle near Long Beach, where he was presenting nightly evangelistic meetings. His office was a renovated chicken coop in Walnut Park, California. Seventh-day Adventist Church members donated their old eyeglasses and gave teeth with gold fillings and jewelry and watches to help buy the first radio time on Long Beach station KGER. Later Richards presented daily live broadcasts of The Tabernacle of the Air over KGER in Long Beach, California, and live weekly remote broadcasts from his tabernacle to KMPC (AM) in Beverly Hills. In January 1937 the broadcast footprint expanded over a network of several stations of the Don Lee Broadcasting System, and the name of the broadcast was changed to the Voice of Prophecy. The first Voice of Prophecy coast-to-coast broadcast was over 89 stations of the Mutual Broadcasting System on Sunday, January 4, 1942. It was one of the first religious programs to broadcast nationally. Up until the early 1950s broadcasts were produced live. Mispronounced names and singer mistakes went out unedited to the listeners. By 1980, Richards had a $6 million budget. The Voice of Prophecy broadcast each Sunday to 700 stations around the world. Throughout the years Voice of Prophecy broadcasts were marked by an opening theme song of \\"Lift Up the Trumpet\\" performed by the King's Heralds quartet and closed with Richard's poem \\"Have Faith in God\\" each week having a new verse written. Speakers H.M.S. Richards, Sr. was speaker from 1929 to 1969. In 1969, Richards' son, H.M.S. Richards, Jr., succeeded him and was speaker from 1969 to 1992. He was followed by Pastor Lonnie Melashenko, then by Fred Kinsey. The current speaker is Shawn Boonstra. Musicians Various musicians perform on the broadcast. Female vocalist Del Delker began as a regular on the program since 1947. The male quartet King's Heralds also performed weekly on the program from 1936 until 1982. Wayne Hooper served as musical director until his retirement in 1980. Discover Bible School A key program of Voice of Prophecy is the Discover Bible School. Introduced on February 1, 1942 as The Bible School of the Air, it was one of the first correspondence Bible schools in North America. Known today as the Discover Bible School it offers free Bible guides by mail or online and has affiliate schools in over 120 countries with lessons in over 80 languages and dialects. In 2010, the Bible School celebrated its one millionth graduate.  Evangelists  Jim Reinking became a Voice of Prophecy evangelist in 1998 and served the ministry for 13 years.

Reimerdes was the first test of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), a United States federal law. The plaintiffs, 8 movie studios, successfully sought an injunction against the distribution of DeCSS, a program capable of decrypting content protected using the Content Scramble System (a DRM scheme commonly used to protect DVDs.) It was produced and released without a license from DVD Copy Control Association (DVD CCA), the trade organization responsible for DVD copy protection. DeCSS was released in October 1999 on LiViD, a mailing list focused on producing programming tools and software libraries relevant to DVD use on Linux. The motion picture industry became aware of the existence of DeCSS later that same month and began litigation on a number of fronts. Procedural history District court On January 14, 2000, eight movie studios (Universal City Studios, Inc., Paramount Pictures Corporation, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc., Tristar Pictures, Inc., Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., Time Warner Entertainment Co., Disney Enterprises, Inc. and Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation) filed a lawsuit against Eric Corley (publisher of 2600: The Hacker Quarterly magazine), Shawn Reimerdes, Roman Kazan and 2600 Enterprises, Inc. The movie studios claimed that all three defendants, by making available DeCSS, were 'trafficking in circumvention devices', an illegal act under the DMCA. The studios sought injunctive relief in the form of a court order preventing the defendants from further publicizing or disseminating the DeCSS program, as well as damages. In mid-January, shortly after the suit was filed, the Court granted a preliminary injunction barring defendants from posting DeCSS. This action allowed the court to prevent the further dissemination of DeCSS until the court could officially decide the legality of disseminating DeCSS. The court felt this precaution was necessary given that the movie studios supplied a reasonable argument that widespread dissemination of DeCSS would cause irreparable harm to their interests. After the preliminary injunction was issued, Reimerdes and Kazan both entered into consent decrees with the plaintiffs and were subsequently dropped from the suit. The consent decree that Reimerdes entered into barred him both from posting the code for DeCSS and from linking to other sites that did so. Reimerdes was originally sued because he hosted the source code for DeCSS on dvd-copy.com, a personal website. The consent decree that Kazan entered into was similar to Reimerdes'. Kazan was initially sued because he ran an internet hosting service that hosted websites offering DeCSS. Corley removed DeCSS from 2600.com after the preliminary injunction was issued, but did not reach a settlement agreement. 2600 Enterprises Inc. was also added to the lawsuit after the preliminary injunction was issued. Although Corley removed the source code for DeCSS, in what Corley termed an act of \\"electronic civil disobedience,\\" 2600.com continued to host links to other websites that hosted the source code for DeCSS. By July 2000, they had compiled links to nearly 500 such sites. The defendants sought to invalidate the DMCA itself on constitutional and other grounds. After a three-day trial, United States District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan issued an 89-page ruling on August 17, 2000, upholding the motion picture industry's position and the constitutionality of the DMCA. > :In the final analysis, the dispute between these parties is simply put if > not necessarily simply resolved. Plaintiffs have invested huge sums over the > years in producing motion pictures in reliance upon a legal framework that, > through the law of copyright, has ensured that they will have the exclusive > right to copy and distribute those motion pictures for economic gain. They > contend that the advent of new technology should not alter this long > established structure. Defendants, on the other hand, are adherents of a > movement that believes that information should be available without charge > to anyone clever enough to break into the computer systems or data storage > media in which it is located. Less radically, they have raised a legitimate > concern about the possible impact on traditional fair use of access control > measures in the digital era. Each side is entitled to its views. In our > society, however, clashes of competing interests like this are resolved by > Congress. For now, at least, Congress has resolved this clash in the DMCA > and in plaintiffs' favor. Given the peculiar characteristics of computer > programs for circumventing encryption and other access control measures, the > DMCA as applied to posting and linking here does not contravene the First > Amendment. Judge Kaplan also spoke to the legality of Corley and 2600.com's continued linking to sites that offered DeCSS for download, saying > To the extent that defendants have linked to sites that automatically > commence the process of downloading DeCSS upon a user being transferred by > defendants' hyperlink there, there can be no serious question. Defendants > are engaged in the functional equivalent of transferring DeCSS code to the > user themselves. Substantially the same is true of defendants' hyperlinks to > web pages that display nothing more than the DeCSS code or present the user > only with the choice of commencing a download of DeCSS and no other > content... In addition to the legal opinion issued by Judge Kaplan affirming the constitutionally of the DMCA and rejecting the defendant's arguments, Kaplan also issued a second document permanently enjoining Corley from engaging in any activities related to the further dissemination of DeCSS or any other content protection schemes developed for DVDs. U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit The case was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, attracting fifteen amicus curiae briefs. After a hearing on May 1, 2001 a three judge panel (Judges Newman, Cabranes and Thompson) affirmed Judge Kaplan on November 28. Although Judge Kaplan's opinion was upheld, the appellate court did agree with the view (held by Corley) that computer programs are a form of protected speech regardless of whether they are in source code or object code form, which commentators regarded as significant. They also agreed with Corley that the DMCA was properly subject to intermediate scrutiny. The appellate court's opinion focused on Corley's First Amendment defenses. Citing the precedent set in Hill v. Colorado that law that incidentally restricts speech for reasons that are \\"justified without reference to the content of regulated speech\\", are not unconstitutional, the appellate court found, like the district court had, that even though DeCSS was a form of speech, it was constitutional to limit it because the limitations were related to the functionality of DeCSS, and not the content of the speech. The court also considered Corley's fair use defense, but said the specific facts of the suit put the constitutionality of the DMCA's effect on fair use beyond the scope of the case, because the defendants had not claimed to be engaging in fair use themselves. The ruling noted, \\"In the first place, the Appellants do not claim to be making fair use of any copyrighted materials, and nothing in the injunction prohibits them from making such fair use. They are barred from trafficking in a decryption code that enables unauthorized access to copyrighted materials.\\" The appellate court also held that the encryption did not prevent \\"a variety of traditional fair uses of DVD movies, such as commenting on their content, quoting excerpts from their screenplays, and even recording portions of the video images and sounds on film or tape by pointing a camera, a camcorder, or a microphone at a monitor as it displays the DVD movie. The fact that the resulting copy will not be as perfect or as manipulable as a digital copy obtained by having direct access to the DVD movie in its digital form, provides no basis for a claim of unconstitutional limitation of fair use.\\" Reception and subsequent developments Both the district and appellate court rulings were controversial, and have been widely criticized by free speech advocates such as the ACLU and the EFF, as well as other groups such as the American Library Association, the author of The Boondocks, and others. Some organizations, such as the NFL and MLB, supported the decisions. Corley initially planned to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court, but decided not to after consultation with his lawyers. Despite the courts' rulings, DeCSS is still widely available on the Internet. See also * Chamberlain v.

He was the primary French judge during the proceedings, with Robert Falco as his alternate. Donnedieu was born in N√Æmes. Prior to the war, he had campaigned for the concept of an International Criminal Court while serving as a professor of Criminal Law at the University of Paris. He also became director of the Paris Institute of Criminology. Later in 1947, he would again submit his idea before the United Nations' Committee on the Progressive Development of International Law and its Codification. In 1935 Donnedieu accepted an invitation to Berlin from Hans Frank, Hitler's personal lawyer and later Governor-General of occupied Poland. They debated the idea of an international criminal court. During the trials, Donnedieu was noted for protesting against the charges of Conspiracy to Wage War as he felt it was too broad to be served in such a monumental trial. As a corollary of this view, he strongly protested against the conviction of Colonel-General Alfred Jodl, stating that it was a miscarriage of justice for the professional soldier to be convicted - when he held no allegiance to Nazism. Jodl was later exonerated posthumously by a German court, citing Donnedieu's statement. On 28 February 1953, a West German denazification court declared Jodl not guilty of breaking international law. This not guilty declaration was revoked on 3 September 1953, by the Minister of Political Liberation for Bavaria. His trial secretary was Yves Beigbeder. Donnedieu was also the one to suggest that a firing squad might be a more honourable way to execute those found guilty - though that was strongly contested by Francis Biddle and Iona Nikitchenko. Along with Lemkin (the Academic who devised the term \\"genocide\\" in his 1944 book Axis Rule in Occupied Europe) and Vespasian V. Pella, he was consulted by John Peters Humphrey to prepare the United Nations Secretariat Draft for the Convention on the Prevention of Genocide. Donnedieu died in Paris in 1952. His grandson Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres served as France's Minister of Culture from 2004 to 2007.

He is most famous for his role as lead and rhythm guitarist, as well as occasional backing vocalist and Mellotron player, in the American rock band the Strokes. Valensi has also worked as a songwriter and session guitarist with various artists, including Sia, Blondie, Brody Dalle, Regina Spektor and Kate Pierson. In 2013, he founded side-project CRX, for which he acts as singer, songwriter and lead and rhythm guitarist. Their debut album, New Skin, was released on October 28, 2016. Early life Valensi was born in New York City, to a Tunisian father and a French mother, Danielle. Valensi's father died when Nick was nine. He began learning guitar at the age of five, following an impromptu strum on one of his father's guitars. His father described him as a natural guitarist, due to his quickness at picking up the ability to strum along with the rhythm of songs at a young age. Growing up, Valensi spent many summers at his grandfather's home near Bordeaux, until the age of 16. He has two sisters, C√©line and Alessandra.The Face Magazine August 2002 He attended The Dwight School, where he met and formed a band with Fabrizio Moretti and Julian Casablancas, and later Hunter College, where he met Nikolai Fraiture.

But once I started playing with Julian, that's when I really started to understand music.\\" Instruments and influences Valensi in 2002 Valensi's main guitar, which he uses for nearly every live show and recorded song, is a 1990s Epiphone Riviera with Gibson P-94 pick-ups, which was given to him by friend and fellow Strokes guitarist Albert Hammond Jr. In a 2004 interview with Epiphone, he called it \\"the greatest guitar never made\\" because Gibson had never produced a semi-hollow with humbucker-sized P-94 pickups. He has several models in different colours (all with P-94s), including multiple naturals, one in vintage sunburst, one in red, and a 12-string elite in red. In 2005, Epiphone released a signature model of his guitar, the Elitist Nick Valensi Riviera P-94, and followed it up with a standard model Nick Valensi Riviera P-94 in 2007. Back-up/warm-up guitars include an Epiphone Dot fitted with 2 P-94s, an Epiphone Casino, an Epiphone Sheraton, and a Gibson Faded Special Double Cutaway with 2 P-90s. Valensi often borrows fellow Strokes guitarist Albert Hammond, Jr.'s backup guitars, which include a Gibson Les Paul Jr. and a Les Paul Special. New guitars used for the First Impressions of Earth tour include a Les Paul Custom in black, a Fender Telecaster Custom (which he can be seen using in the music video for Under Cover of Darkness ), and a Duesenberg semi-hollow. Valensi's main amplifier is a 2x12\\" Fender Hot Rod DeVille, used with Fender 4x12\\" extension cabinets during live shows. He also recently purchased a Carr amplifier to use on the last few stops of the First Impressions tour. His pedalboard consists of a Visual Sound Jekyll & Hyde Ultimate Overdrive pedal, Boss TR-2 Tremolo, Vox Cooltron Bulldog Distortion, MXR Micro Amp (2) and a Boss TU-2 Chromatic Tuner.

He is a member of the UMP center-right party, and the grandson of Henri Donnedieu de Vabres. Biography Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres has a degree in economics, and a diploma from the Paris Institute of Political Studies, a traditional starting point for attending the √âcole nationale d'administration (ENA), a school for high-level civil servants, which he entered in 1978. After graduating in 1980 from ENA, he started his career in the prefectoral administration as a sub-prefect, chief of staff of the Indre- et-Loire prefect, then was secretary-general for the police in the Centre region (1980‚Äì1981), secretary-general of the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence prefecture (1981‚Äì1982), sub-prefect of the Ch√¢teau-Thierry arrondissement (1982‚Äì1985). Political career From 1986 to 2001 he was regional councillor in the Centre region, president of the UDF group and reporter for the budget (1986‚Äì1993). He began his national political career as an aide to Fran√ßois L√©otard when the latter was Minister of Culture (1987‚Äì1988) in the government of then prime minister Jacques Chirac, then as chief of staff in the Republican Party, then one of the components of the UDF. Starting from 1990, he became a member of the political bureau of the party, then delegate-general from 1995 √† 1997. From 1993 to 1995, he was an aide to Fran√ßois L√©otard, Minister of Defence in the government of then prime minister √âdouard Balladur. Within this role, he participated in the negotiation of an important sale of two anti-air frigates to Saudi Arabia by a company affiliated with the Ministry; the contract, for approximately 19 billion French francs, was signed on 19 November 1994. There were suspicions that this contract generated massive kickbacks for the funding of the Republican Party and, as a consequence, a complex judicial enquiry was started. Finally, on 16 February 2004, the correctional court of Paris convicted Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres of money laundering, with a ‚Ç¨15,000 fine.Donnedieu de Vabres et L√©otard condamn√©s, l'express.fr He was not, however, deprived of the right to run for office. During the 1995 presidential election, Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres was in the campaign team of √âdouard Balladur. In March 2001, he was the right-wing candidate in the municipal election in Tours in March 2001, but he was beaten by the outgoing PS mayor, Jean Germain. From 1997 to 2002 he was deputy to the National Assembly for the first constituency of Indre-et-Loire, from the UDF center-right party. In 1999, he voted against the PACS, a domestic partnership law aimed at enabling homosexuals to form legal couples. During the 2002 presidential election, he distanced himself from the UDF leader Fran√ßois Bayrou and supported Jacques Chirac's reelection bid. At the ensuing legislative election, he was reelected deputy. On 7 May 2002, he was appointed delegate minister for European affairs in the government of Jean-Pierre Raffarin, a position that he quit in the 16 June cabinet reshuffle as a result of the announcement of the aforementioned criminal investigation in the financial affairs of the Republican Party. He became deputy secretary general of the UMP party, the party supporting Jacques Chirac, then spokesperson in 2003. Despite his 16 February 2004, conviction, he was, on 31 March, appointed Minister of Culture and communication in the third cabinet of prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, and was kept at this position on 2 June 2005, for the government of Dominique de Villepin. In 2005, he rose to fame by defending the controversial DADVSI copyright bill before the French parliament, resulting in a variety of criticism against him from both the opposition and members of his own party. On this occasion, president of the National Assembly Jean-Louis Debr√©, a fellow UMP member, is reported to have declared that Donnedieu de Vabres was \\"a zero who put us in the shit and, from the start, dragged us into an adventure\\".Le Canard Encha√Æn√©, 15 March 2006 Because of his staunch support for the law, he is the target of a campaign of Google bombing mapping ministre blanchisseur (\\"laundering minister\\") to a press article about his conviction.

It is the second game developed by Introversion Software, and is set within a computer environment that simulates artificial intelligence. It received favorable reviews and won three awards at the 2006 Independent Games Festival. A multiplayer sequel, Multiwinia, was released for Windows in 2008. Darwinia and Multiwinia were released together as Darwinia+ for the Xbox 360 in 2010. Plot Darwinia was created as a digital theme world for artificially intelligent polygons by Dr. Sepulveda. Housed in a massive network of surplus Protologic 68000 machines from the 1980s, Darwinia is a world where the single-poly Darwinians, with their simple, but growing AI, can grow and evolve. Darwinia is also where the world can visit to see them frolicking in their natural, fractal habitat. A Darwinian lives a life working and growing, until the eventual death of the Darwinian, which releases their digital soul to later be reincarnated. However, the player arrives in the midst of an emergency. Darwinia has been infected by a computer virus, and Sepulveda is in near panic, watching decades of research being corrupted and being used up. Sepulveda enlists the player, a curious hacker who stumbled across Darwinia by accident, to aid him in rescuing the Darwinians and drive off the computer virus. The player is given access to the combat programs, simple tools that originally began as mini- games. These are now the only means of attack against the virus. As the player progresses, it soon becomes clear this is not enough, and that triggers the third aspect of the gameplay, which is evolution. The first two levels of the video game act as an introduction and allow the player to familiarize themselves with the controls. After that, Dr. Sepulveda begins assigning tasks that span several levels to achieve a long-term objective. The first task involves clearing the virus population from and reactivating the Mines and Power Generator to provide resources for the Construction Yard. Once done, the Yard begins producing armored units, allowing the player to move on. The next task involves the reincarnation of Darwinians: the Soul Repository in the center of Darwinia collects the floating souls, and sends them down to the Receiver, where the Darwinians gather them and send them to the Pattern Buffer to be reprogrammed with the main Darwinian blueprint code, where they are sent to the Biosphere to be reborn. The player must clear the Viruses from all the facilities and reactivate them. In the final level of the game, Sepulveda traces the Viral infection back to its source, which is e-mail spam. After Sepulveda had accidentally flashed an image of his face across the skies of Darwinia, The Darwinians had assumed him to be God. They then re-aligned a portal inside Darwinia in an attempt to communicate with God. The Darwinians managed to access Sepulveda's computer, downloading several files and eventually downloading the Spam. The e-mails were infected with a very nasty strain of internet virus which corrupted the Darwinians. The player is tasked to destroying the few remaining e-mails. Gameplay A Squad attacking its target with an airstrike Darwinia mixes elements from strategy, action, puzzle, hacker and God games alike, meaning that it does not fall under a specific video game genre. The player has the ability to run several programs through the Task Manager, similar to units used in many real-time strategy games. Research allows the player to upgrade programs and weapons, which is critical as the enemy develops. Mission objectives are given at each location/level, as the player and the Darwinians attempt to wipe out the Viruses. Development Darwinia was inspired by the theme of the first Indie Game Jam, where a group of programmers experimented with generating tens of thousands of sprites on screen at once. Introversion began prototyping a war game with more units on screen than had ever been done at that point. After months of iteration and development, this coalesced into the gameplay for Darwinia. The initial beta testing of Darwinia began on 27 August 2004, and the beta testing of the full game started on 26 November, the same year. A demo level of Darwinia was released 3 months later on 21 January, and can be downloaded from the Darwinia website. Darwinia was released in Europe on 4 March 2005 (the U.S. version followed on 12 June 2006), while the Macintosh version was released 30 March 2005 by publisher Ambrosia Software. A patch was released on 28 April 2005 for Microsoft Windows, bringing the version to 1.2. New features included an improved unit selection system, as well as numerous modding updates including the ability to create custom strings. Another patch (version 1.3) was released in September 2005, which includes the option (enabled by default) of clicking icons or using keyboard shortcuts to create units instead of using the gesture system. A new demo, using features of the above-mentioned version 1.3 patch and an entirely new level \\"Launchpad\\" not in the full game, was released in September 2005. Darwinia was released on Steam on 14 December 2005. This helped solve some of Introversion's distribution problems, and allowed for localized versions to be developed; a German translation was included with the Steam release. A new patch was released on 10 March 2006 bringing the version up to 1.42 and adding difficulty settings ranging from 1 to 10. Higher difficulties increase the number, speed, and health of monsters. It also increases the speed of the player's own units. eGames-owned Cinemaware on 4 April 2006 issued a press release announcing they would bring Darwinia to US markets in June 2006. Beta testing signups for version 1.5.x started on 15 December 2006. A Windows Vista exclusive version of Darwinia with extra eye candy and 3 additional levels was released on 31 January 2007. Version 1.5.1.1 patch released on 18 June 2007, providing support for DirectX 9c, including extra eye candy and the \\"Launchpad\\" level. In 2010 in context of a Bundle sale the source code of the game was made available for purchase under a non-open-source license. Darwinia+ Darwinia+ is the version of Darwinia for the Xbox 360, released on the Xbox Live Arcade on 11 February 2010. It includes updated versions of both Darwinia and Multiwinia.

Some sources omit the A -> B pattern. It is named after Sige-Yuki Kuroda, who originally called it a linear bounded grammar‚Äîa terminology that was also used by a few other authors thereafter. Every grammar in Kuroda normal form is noncontracting, and therefore, generates a context-sensitive language. Conversely, every context-sensitive language which does not generate the empty string can be generated by a grammar in Kuroda normal form. A straightforward technique attributed to Gy√∂rgy R√©v√©sz transforms a grammar in Kuroda's form to Chomsky's CSG: AB -> CD is replaced by four context-sensitive rules AB -> AZ, AZ -> WZ, WZ -> WD and WD -> CD. This technique also proves that every noncontracting grammar is context-sensitive. There is a similar normal form for unrestricted grammars as well, which at least some authors call \\"Kuroda normal form\\" too: :AB -> CD or :A -> BC or :A -> a or :A -> Œµ where Œµ is the empty string. Every unrestricted grammar is [weakly] equivalent to one using only productions of this form. If the rule AB ‚Üí CD is eliminated from the above, then one obtains context-free languages. The Penttonen normal form (for unrestricted grammars) is a special case where A = C in the first rule above. For context-sensitive grammars, the Penttonen normal form, also called the one-sided normal form (following Penttonen's own terminology) is just: :AB -> AD or :A -> BC or :A -> a As the name suggests, for every context-sensitive grammar, there exists a [weakly] equivalent one-sided/Penttonen normal form.

Originally a weighing scale manufacturer, it later diversified into pumps, engines, windmills, coffee grinders, radios, farm tractors, feed mills, locomotives, and industrial supplies until it was purchased by Penn Texas in 1958 and later, in 1999, by Goodrich Corp. It used the trade name Fairbanks-Morse. There are three separate corporate entities that could be considered successors to the company, none of which is a complete and direct descendant of the original company. All claim the heritage of Fairbanks Morse and Company: *Fairbanks Scales is a privately owned company in Kansas City, Missouri, that manufactures scales *Fairbanks Morse , a portfolio company of Arcline Investment Management, is a company based in Beloit, Wisconsin, that manufactures and services engines *Fairbanks Nijhuis is a part of Pentair Water in Kansas City, Kansas, and manufactures pumps Founding and early history Fairbanks-Morse windmill Fairbanks Morse and Company began in 1823 when inventor Thaddeus Fairbanks opened an ironworks in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, to manufacture two of his patented inventions: a cast iron plow and a heating stove. In 1829 he started a hemp dressing business for which he built the machinery. Though unsuccessful in fabricating for fiber factories, another invention by Thaddeus, the platform scale, formed the basis for a great enterprise. That device was patented in June 1832, and a generation later, with his brother Erastus Fairbanks, the E. & T. Fairbanks & Company was selling thousands of scales, first in the United States, later in Europe, South America, and even Imperial China. Fairbanks scales won 63 medals over the years in international competition. It became the leading manufacturer in the US, and the best-known company the world over until Henry Ford and the Ford Corporation assumed this title in the 1920s. In Wisconsin, a former missionary named Leonard Wheeler designed a durable windmill for pumping water, the Eclipse windmill. Wheeler set up shop in Beloit just after the Civil War. Soon half a million windmills dotted the landscape throughout the West and as far away as Australia. At about the same time, a Fairbanks & Company employee, Charles Hosmer Morse, opened a Fairbanks office in Chicago, from which he expanded the company's territory of operation and widened its product line. As part of this expansion, Morse brought Wheeler and his Eclipse Windmill pumps into business with the Fairbanks company. Morse later became a partner in the Fairbanks Company and by the end of the nineteenth century, it was known as Fairbanks Morse & Company and was headquartered in Chicago. Canadian and American cities had branch dealerships, with Fairbanks first coming to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in 1876 and later opening a factory there. Fairbanks platform scale Market expansion 1910 Model H. Fairbanks Morse Type T gas engine In the late nineteenth century, business expanded in the Western United States, as did the company's catalog. It grew to include typewriters, hand trucks, railway velocipedes, pumps, tractors, and a variety of warehouse and bulk shipping tools. The company became an industrial supplier distributing complete \\"turn-key\\" systems: tools, plumbing, gauges, gaskets, parts, valves, and pipe. Its 1910 catalog contained over 800 pages. thumb|Fairbanks Morse model 32 was a 1932 update of the Model Y diesel engine. The Fairbanks Morse Company began producing oil and naptha engines in the 1890s with the purchase of the Charter line of engines (the first commercially available gas engine). They had the idea that an engine could be used as backup power for when one of their Eclipse windmills wasn't getting wind. The Fairbanks Morse gas engine became a success with farmers. Electricity generation and oilfield work also used these engines. Small lighting plants built by the company were also popular. Fairbanks Morse power plants evolved by burning kerosene in 1893, coal gas in 1905, then to semi-diesel engines in 1913 and to full diesel engines in 1924. The Model N was popular in stationary industrial applications. In 1934, Fairbanks-Morse entered the radio business by acquiring the Audiola Radio Co. After a 1939 factory fire FM decided to exit the radio business. Fairbanks-Morse radios are well known for their colorfulness.https://www.radiomuseum.org/dsp_hersteller_detail.cfm?company_id=2394 The company also had brief forays into building automobiles, tractors, corn shellers, hammermills, cranes, televisions, and refrigerators, but output was small in these fields. After the expiration of Rudolf Diesel's American license in 1912, Fairbanks Morse entered the large engine business. The company's larger Model Y semi-diesel became a standard workhorse, and sugar, rice, timber, and mine mills used the engine. The model Y was available in sizes from one through six cylinders, or 10 to . The Y-VA engine was the first high-compression, cold-start, full diesel developed by Fairbanks Morse without the acquisition of any foreign patent. This machine was developed in Beloit and introduced in 1924. The company expanded its line to the marine CO engine (Many 100 H.P. CO marine engines were used in the Philippine Islands to power ferry boats) as well as the mill model E, a modernized Y diesel. From this, Fairbanks-Morse became a major engine manufacturer and developed plants for railway and marine applications. The development of the diesel locomotive, tug, and ship in the 1930s fostered the expansion of the company. \\"Z\\" Engine Line Fairbanks-Morse renamed their headless Model to \\"Z\\" in July 1914, according to engine historian C.H. Wendel. On all \\"Z\\" engines the gasoline tank is located in the base. In 1917, they expanded the line to include more sizes. In 1918, they stopped making headless models and adapted the 1.5 H.P. to have a head, and larger H.P. engines could now run on Kerosene. In 1928 The \\"Z\\" style \\"D\\" was introduced, and was entirely enclosed. The Z was made in incremental sizes of 3, 6, 12, 15 and up to . Over a half million units were produced in the following 30 years. In the early 1980s the line was sold off to Bell. The model Z found favor with farmers, and is a collectable today. Advertisement for 1916 \\"Z\\" engine Seagoing diesel engines Fairbanks-Morse opposed piston diesel engines on the WWII submarine (on display in San Francisco). During World War I, a large order of 60 30 H.P. CO marine engines were installed in British decoy fishing ships to lure German submarines within range of their 6\\" naval guns. In 1939 Fairbanks-Morse developed a marine engine using an unusual opposed piston (O. P.) design, similar in arrangement to a series of German Junkers aircraft diesels. The most common variant for submarines through the 1990s was the 38D 8-1/8 engine, ranging from 4 to 12 cylinders. This engine was delivered to the U.S. Navy in large numbers, often for use in fleet submarines, which used 9- or 10-cylinder versions as main engines in World War II. When the innovative but faulty \\"pancake\\" engines of the proved unworkable, they were replaced with World War II-style Fairbanks- Morse engines, and these remained standard on US diesel-powered submarines through the early 1960s. These and other Fairbanks-Morse O. P. engines were also used as backup power on US nuclear submarines through the of the 1990s. Fairbanks-Morse ranked 60th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.Peck, Merton J. & Scherer, Frederic M. The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis (1962) Harvard Business School p.619 The US Navy has had Fairbanks-Morse diesels in operation on its submarines almost continuously since 1938. They remain in service on -, Seawolf-, and nuclear submarines of the US Navy. In addition to O.P. engines (used in the USCGC Hamilton class), Fairbanks-Morse license builds Pielstick (used in the s and s), Alco (used in ), and M.A.N. design engines. Railroad locomotives Train Master\\", 1953 Shortly after it won its first US Navy contract, the company introduced its bore by stroke opposed piston diesel to the rail industry, installing the engine in various self-propelled railcars.Lamb, p. 85 This engine proved unreliable, and was superseded by a larger 5-cylinder bore by stroke engine that produced 800 H.P. and was installed in the OP800 railcars in 1939. In 1935, F-M initiated a long-term plan to build locomotives in house when it hired electrical engineer John K. Stotz from Westinghouse Electric Corporation and began developing plans for a 1,000 H.P. switcher and a 2,000 H.P. multipurpose locomotive. While the company was ready to begin production of the units in 1940, the War Production Board (WPB) denied it permission, citing the national interest of F-M's production of submarine engines and a locomotive market supplied by existing manufacturers. In 1943, the WPB approved F-M's plans to sell locomotives, and it introduced the 1,000 H.P. switcher H-10-44 in 1944, followed by the 2,000 cab unit, dubbed the Erie-built for its outsourced assembly location, in late 1945. The early locomotives soon proved unreliable, as high-stress railroad service exposed weaknesses in the engine that had not been seen in less demanding marine applications.Lamb, p. 88 In 1947, F-M reorganized its locomotive division with the hiring of new managers and the construction of a dedicated factory the following year. Model OP800 railcar In 1947, F-M introduced two new road switcher models, the 1,500 H.P. H-15-44 and the 2,000 H.P. H-20-44.Lamb, p. 96 In late 1949, the company's new cab units, named the Consolidated Line, were introduced to replace the Erie-builts in its catalog. None of the late 1940s models sold as well as competing units from EMD and Alco, and the Consolidated Line fared particularly poorly as cab units fell out of favor on American railroads. In 1951 F-M began designing a new large locomotive, and in 1953 it introduced the 2,400 H.P. H-24-66 Train Master, then the highest powered locomotive available.Lamb, p. 99 It too proved unpopular, and in 1958 F-M built its last locomotive for the American market, followed in 1963 by its final delivery to a Mexican customer. In total, it sold 1,460 diesel locomotives. Post-war power products Fairbanks Morse continued to build diesel and gas engines, as it had been doing for the first half of the twentieth century. This is in addition to the pump and engine division, which produced Canadian Fairbanks Morse branded products for farms, factories and mines. Export offices were established in Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires; a factory was opened in Mexico, where model Z engines were built well into the 1980s. An Australian branch factory, similar to the Canadian Branch operation, was opened and remote sheep stations benefited from their products. It dated from 1902, when Cooper Sheep Shearing Machinery Ltd was set up in Sydney, and became an agent for Fairbanks Morse in that Hemisphere. Fairbanks-Morse warehouse, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan The company sold and updated the Eclipse model of windmill pumps in North America until they became obsolete with widespread rural electrification in the 1940s. Low cost electricity from the grid eliminated the need for local power production by small and medium diesel plants. While many Fairbanks Morse engines dutifully served into the late twentieth century, modernization, regional plant closures, and electricity were too much competition. An inter-family feud for control of the company in 1956 between the sons of Charles Morse weakened the company. Consequently, Fairbanks-Morse was merged with Penn-Western in 1958. The downhill slide continued for the next few decades, with assets being sold off, and branches of the company closed. Regional sales offices were closed, and the one-shop model no longer appealed to buyers in the new consumer age. Automakers, tractor makers and locomotive builders made inroads into Fairbanks-Morse's market share. Thus the company spiraled down, and was sold. Corporate disposition US Navy sailors adjust the connecting rod cap on a Fairbanks Morse diesel generator trainer Fairbanks Morse and Company merged with Penn-Texas Corporation in 1958 to form Fairbanks Whitney Corporation. Fairbanks Whitney was reorganized as Colt Industries in 1964, taking the name from Colt Manufacturing, the maker of firearms and an asset of Penn-Texas. In 1988, the Fairbanks Morse Pump division was sold off to private investors to become Fairbanks Morse Pump. It was subsequently purchased by Pentair as part of an acquisition of General Signal Pump Group in 1997. In 1988, the scale business was sold off by Colt Industries and became Fairbanks Scales, still an independent company. In 1990, Colt Industries sold its firearms business to C.F. Holdings Corp as Colt's Manufacturing Company, Inc. and became Coltec Industries. Coltec merged with BFGoodrich corporation in 1999 and retained the BFGoodrich name. In 2002, as part of a series of divestitures of non-aerospace divisions, BFGoodrich spun off its engineered industrial products division as EnPro Industries, Inc. and became Goodrich Corporation. EnPro was then the parent company of Fairbanks Morse Engine until 2020 when Fairbanks Morse was sold to Arcline Investment Management. As a result, there are now three companies using either the Fairbanks or Fairbanks Morse trademarks, with lineage to the original Fairbanks Morse and Company.

After his retirement from sports he worked as a television commentator. Amateur career Rudi Altig was born in Mannheim, Baden, Germany, an area which had produced good track riders.Sporting Cyclist, UK, December 1966 He began racing in 1952, following his older brother, Willi. The brothers teamed for madison and other two-man races, becoming the best in the country. The British promoter, Jim Wallace, booked Altig to ride with Hans JaroszewiczWilli had been invited but had fallen ill. at a meeting on Herne Hill velodrome in Good Friday in 1956. He said: > What a pair they made! They just about slaughtered a top-class field of > international riders, with all our best home lads. Only Michel Rousseau, > later that year to become world sprint champion, was able to take a points > sprint from them. That was in the first sprint, too; thereafter the German > pair gained not only every sprint for points but every prime [lap prize] as > well ... They went on to Coventry [another meeting held over Easter] and did > much the same thing, winning everything in which they rode, so classy was > their performance. Altig became national sprint champion in 1957 and 1958. Then Karly Ziegler, a coach, took over his preparation when he joined the Endspurt Mannheim club and Altig became a pursuiter. He won the 1959 national pursuit championship and won the madison championship with his brother. Later that year he beat many of the world's best pursuiters to become world champion in Amsterdam. Professional track career Altig was allowed by the Union Cycliste Internationale to turn professional in 1960Coups de P√©dales, Belgium, undated cutting within a year of his world championship. He rode his first professional six-day, in Denmark, that winter. Wallace said: > No man ever settled down better or quicker to a pro career than the able > Altig. In the hurly-burly world of indoor track racing. Rudi never seemed a > novice. Settling down at once, tearing strips off established stars, he soon > started to fill indoor tracks which had long forgotten the welcome sight of > a 'house full' sign. He brought back the biggest winter racing boom to > Germany for many years, reminiscent of the balmy pre-war days. With seven > tracks at home - more than in the rest of Europe - Altig had a busy time and > was soon in the big money. He won the world pursuit championship in 1960 and 1961 and won 62 races on the track. He won 22 six-day races, particularly in Germany, including four in Cologne and Dortmund. He never rode the Giro di Lombardia because it clashed with the start of the winter season on the track. He said: > I rode the track because I could win money. If I hadn't been able to win > money on the track, I wouldn't have travelled all the velodromes of the > world to ride six-days. Now, riders are better paid and they don't need to > hammer themselves on the road and the track. We, in our era, we did > everything to try to win money. Modern times are different, you have to > understand that. You can't compare the two eras. But I don't regret ours. Altig, who was tall and weighed , sprinted on the track on 52 or 53 √ó 16 and rode pursuits on 52 √ó 15. \\"He gave his bikes as hard a time as he gave his adversaries,\\" said the writer, Olivier Dazat. Road career Altig (right) with his brother Willi in 1966 Altig started his professional career as a track rider; it was Rapha√´l G√©miniani who persuaded him his future was on the road. Altig agreed because fame on the road would give him better contracts on the track. He won the Vuelta a Espa√±a and three of its stages in 1962. He led the general classification for five days in his first Tour de France that same season, winning three stages and the points competition, and finishing 31st. He won his first classic in 1964, the Tour of Flanders after riding 60 km alone and winning by four minutes. In the same year he won the German National Road Race. In 1965 he finished second to Englishman Tom Simpson in the professional road championship in San Sebasti√°n, Spain. Simpson said: > I could not accept that Altig could beat me. Going round the back of the > circuit we came to a gentleman's agreement. Both of us had worked hard in > our little break and therefore we each deserved an equal chance of victory. > We agreed to separate when we reached the one kilometre to go board and ride > in side by side. Altig was quite happy about this for I am sure he thought > he could put it across me. So there we were, two gentlemen virtually > fighting a duel over the last kilometre. I was glad that Altig had accepted > my proposal for it was the fairest way out. I have always regarded him as a > great rider and his showing that day did nothing to make me change my mind. But the world title was not denied for long: he won the 1966 championship not too far away from his home, at the N√ºrburgring. There was controversy because Altig had been helped by Gianni Motta, riding that day for Italy but normally Altig's companion in the Molteni team. The concern was quickly overshadowed by the refusal of the first three riders to give urine samples for a drugs check.Nicholson, Geoffrey (1991, Le Tour, Hodder and Stoughton, UK, p160, They were protesting at what they saw was the laxity with which tests were carried out and at what they considered restrictions on the way they prepared themselves. Altig said: \\"We are professionals, not sportsmen.\\" The three were disqualified and suspended but ten days later the Union Cycliste Internationale allowed the result to stand. UAE stamp Altig took three stages in that year's Tour, finishing 12th place overall, and two more in the Giro d'Italia, in which he came 13th. The second and final classic win came in the 1968 Milan‚ÄìSan Remo. He also took two stages of that year's Vuelta, finishing 18th overall. In 1969 he finished 9th in the Giro, and won the prologue individual time trial of the Tour de France. Jacques Anquetil Altig rode his first Tour as a domestique and as team sprinter for Jacques Anquetil. The two developed a rocky relationship in the Tour of Spain that hardened when Altig took the yellow jersey early in the Tour de France. Anquetil criticised him because his team would have to ride at the front and chase every attack to protect a rider too heavy to keep his lead through the mountains. The two never became close until they rode for different teams. That same year the two were paired for the Trofeo Baracchi, a 111 km two-man time-trial in Italy. The writer Ren√© de Latour wrote: > Generally in a race of the Barrachi type, the changes are very rapid, with > stints of no more than 300 yards.

In 2013, the parish merged into the new parish Gulpilhares e Valadares. The population in 2011 was 10,678,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 5.14 km2.Eurostat Today the shoreside vicinity is very popular for its nightlife and the bars along its well-known beach. It is also possible to see some old sanatoriums used mostly in the 1940s and 1950s to treat people suffering from bone fractures and diseases like tuberculosis. The sanatoriums were established here because the region is extremely rich in iodine, valuable for its antiseptic uses in medicine. Valadares is also very famous for Cer√¢mica de Valadares that today it is considered the biggest and most varied National Manufacture provider of sanitary ware and ceramic fittings. There is a train station.  Coat of arms and flag  The coat of arms are made up of a ceramic vase on the center with a dentate wheel behind, on the left is maize and on the right a shield over the water, on the bottom is water. The flag has two white and two blue squares. The ceramic vase with a dentate wheel represents the ceramic industry and the archaeological findings. The maize represents the fields in Vila Ch√°. The shield represents the shields of Vila Nova de Gaia coat of arms. The water represents the ocean and the beach of Valadares. The colors blue and white represent the ocean and foam of the waves.  History  Sanat√≥rio Mar√≠timo do Norte, in Valadares. The name Valadares originates from the word \\"Vallado\\", that means obstacle. That may be the \\"Crasto de Valadares\\" a fortification from the second period of the Iron Age (450 b.C.). This \\"Crastos\\" on the northwest of Iberian Peninsula, goes from the 5th century B.C. to AD 5th century. In the Middle Ages, Valadares belonged to the Monastery of Grij√≥. During the first half of the 20th century, Valadares enjoyed a considerable development, being one of the most developed parishes of Gaia, due to the existence of the Cer√¢mica de Valadares, one important Train Station, Sanatoriums, several Schools and a theatre (Cine- teatro Eduardo Braz√£o).  Culture  There is a traditional dessert in Valadares - The \\"Velhote\\", a kind of sweet bread with lemon and cinnamon. The origin of this dessert isn't cleared yet, but most people believe that it was created in the 19th century by a lady who came from Braga. It is said that when king Carlos I and queen Amelia went to Oporto, they ate \\"Velhotes\\". The patron of Valadares is S. Salvador.

The two genera, Triops and Lepidurus, are considered living fossils, having not changed significantly in outward form since the Triassic. They have a broad, flat carapace, which conceals the head and bears a single pair of compound eyes. The abdomen is long, appears to be segmented and bears numerous pairs of flattened legs. The telson is flanked by a pair of long, thin caudal rami. Phenotypic plasticity within taxa makes species-level identification difficult, and is further compounded by variation in the mode of reproduction. Notostracans are omnivores living on the bottom of temporary pools and shallow lakes. Description Notostracans are long, with a broad carapace at the front end, and a long, slender abdomen. This gives them a similar overall shape to a tadpole, from which the common name tadpole shrimp derives. The carapace is dorso-ventrally flattened, smooth, and bears no rostrum; it includes the head, and the two sessile compound eyes are located together on top of the head. The two pairs of antennae are much reduced, with the second pair sometimes missing altogether. The mouthparts comprise a pair of uniramous mandibles and no maxillipeds. The ventral side of Triops australiensis, showing the many pairs of phyllopodous legs The trunk comprises a large number of \\"body rings\\", which appear to be body segments, but do not always reflect the underlying segmentation. The first eleven body rings compose the thorax and bear one pair of legs each, the last of which also bears the genital opening. In the female, it is modified to form a \\"brood pouch\\". The first one or two pairs of legs differ from the remainder, and probably function as sensory organs. The remaining segments form the abdomen. The number of body rings is variable both within and between species, and the number of pairs of legs per body ring can rise as high as six. The legs become progressively smaller along the abdomen, with the last segments being legless. The abdomen ends in a telson and a pair of long, thin, multi-articulate caudal rami. The form of the telson varies between the two genera: in Lepidurus, a rounded projection extends between the caudal rami, while in Triops there is no such projection. Life cycle A collection of lake sediment containing the pink eggs of Triops longicaudatus Within the Notostraca, and even within species, there is variation in the mode of reproduction, with some populations reproducing sexually, some showing self-fertilisation of females, and some showing a mix of the two. The frequency of males in populations is therefore highly variable. In sexual populations, the sperm leave the male's body through simple pores, there being no penis. The eggs are released by the female and then held in the cup-like brood pouch. The eggs are retained by the female only for a short time before being laid, and the larvae develop directly, without passing through a metamorphosis. Ecology and distribution Notostracans are omnivorous, eating small animals such as fishes and fairy shrimp. They are found worldwide in freshwater, brackish water or saline pools, as well as in shallow lakes, peat bogs and moorland. In Californian rice paddies, the species Triops longicaudatus is considered a pest, because it stirs up sediment, preventing light from reaching the rice seedlings. Evolution and fossil record The fossil record of Notostraca is extensive, occurring in a wide range of geological deposits, and reaching back to the Carboniferous. The lack of major morphological change since has led to Notostraca being described as a living fossil. Kazacharthra, a group known only from Triassic and Jurassic fossils from Kazakhstan and Western China, are closely related to notostracans, and may belong within the order Notostraca. The \\"central autapomorphy\\" of the Notostraca is the abandonment of filter feeding in open water, and the development of a benthic lifestyle in muddy waters, taking up food from particles of sediment and preying on small animals. A number of other characteristics are correlated with this change, including the increased size of the animal compared to its relatives, and the loss of the ability to hinge the carapace; although a central keel marks the former separation into two valves, the adductor muscle is missing. Notostracans retain the plesiomorphic condition of having two separate compound eyes, which abut, but have not become united, as seen in other groups of Branchiopoda. Taxonomy The extant members of order Notostraca composed a single family, Triopsidae, with only two genera, Triops and Lepidurus. The problematic Middle Ordovician fossil Douglasocaris has been erected and placed in its own family Douglasocaridae by Caster & Brooks 1956, and may be ancestral to Notostraca. The phenotypic plasticity shown by notostracan species make identification to the species level difficult. Many putative species have been described based on morphological variation, such that by the 1950s, as many as 70 species were recognised. Two important revisions ‚Äì those of Linder in 1952 and Longhurst in 1955 ‚Äì synonymised many taxa, and resulted in the recognition of only 11 species in the two genera. This taxonomy was accepted for decades, \\"even attaining the status of dogma\\". More recent studies, especially those employing molecular phylogenetics, have shown that the eleven currently recognised species conceal a greater number of reproductively isolated populations.

P√®re Claude-Jean Allouez established the Mission de Saint-Joseph in the 1680s. Allouez ministered to the local Native Americans, who were primarily Odawa and Ojibwe. The French built the fort in 1691 as a trading post on the lower Saint Joseph River. It was located where one branch of the Old Sauk Trail, a major east-west Native American trail, and the north-south Grand River Trail meet; together the combined trail fords the river. The fort was a significant stronghold of the fur trade at the southern end of Lake Michigan. Prior to the French and Indian War (the North American front of the Seven Years' War in Europe), the post had a French garrison of 10 soldiers, a commandant, blacksmith, Catholic priest, interpreter, and 15 additional households.Nassaney, 28 Following their victory in the war, the British took over the fort and maintained it for the fur trade. During the American Revolutionary War, they used it to supply their American Indian allies against the rebellious Continentals. The Spanish raided the fort in 1781 and briefly claimed it and the St. Joseph River as their territory. The British maintained the fort until after the United States victory in the Northwest Indian War and the signing of Jay's Treaty in 1795. This settled the northern border. After the British abandoned the fort, it fell into ruin and was overtaken by forest. The fort site was not rediscovered until 1998. An archeology excavation has been underway since 2002. Among the rare artifacts discovered is an intact Jesuit religious medallion from the 1730s, one of only two found in North America. In December 2010, the team revealed a foundation wall and corner posts of one of the original buildings. The site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a state-registered site as well. French and Indian War During the Battle of Jumonville Glen, considered the first battle of the French and Indian War in North America, Joseph Coulon de Jumonville was killed. He was the son of Nicolas-Antoine Coulon de Villiers and the half-brother of Captain Louis Coulon de Villiers, who was stationed at Fort St. Joseph. Louis Coulon de Villiers vowed revenge for his brother's death. After the British defeat of France in the Seven Years' War, France transferred the fort to the British, who occupied it in October 1761. Pontiac's Rebellion On May 25, 1763, during Pontiac's Rebellion, the fort was captured by Potawatomi warriors. They killed most of the British 15-man garrison outright, and took the commander, Ensign Francis Schlosser, captive. They took him to Detroit to be ransomed as a prisoner, as was common practice for higher-ranking men. After Pontiac's Rebellion was suppressed, the British maintained the fort as a trading post, but did not garrison it again until 1779, during the American Revolutionary War. American Revolution Raid of 1780 During the war, the British used Fort St. Joseph to equip the Miami, Potawatomi, and other American Indians who were their allies in the war against the rebellious Continentals. In 1780 Americans from Cahokia, Illinois, led by Jean-Baptiste Hamelin and Lt. Thomas Brady, raided the fort. The British Lt. Dagneaux Du Quindre led forces after the raiding party; he overtook and defeated them near Petit Fort (in present-day Indiana). Spanish Expedition of 1781 After the defeat of Hamelin's party, two Milwaukee chiefs, El Heturn√≤ and Naquiguen, traveled to Spanish-held St. Louis; they arrived on 26 December 1780, to report the failed raid. They asked for assistance to raid the fort again. Don Francisco Cruzat, Commandant of St. Louis, dispatched the militia Captain Don Eugenio Pour√© with 60 volunteers and Native allies. The force also included Ensign Charles Tayon and the interpreter Louis Chevalier. The Spanish and Native force travelled via the Illinois River and Kankakee River to modern Dunns Bridge, Indiana. There they turned northeast and marched overland to Fort St. Joseph. Before the Spanish and their allies attacked the fort, they promised the Potawatomi half the bounty if they would remain neutral.Skaggs, 214 Captain Pour√© took Fort St. Joseph by surprise on 12 February 1781 by racing across the frozen river and taking the fort before the defenders could go to arms. He had the Spanish colors raised and claimed Fort St. Joseph and the St. Joseph River for Spain. His troops plundered the fort for one day, distributing the goods among natives before departing. Lt. Dagneau de Quindre arrived the next day, but was unable to persuade his native allies to pursue the raiders. The Spanish returned to St. Louis on 6 March without incident. Pour√© delivered the British flag to Cruzat.Skaggs, 208 Some historians have described the attack as Spanish retaliation for the British attack on St. Louis in the previous year. When Cruzat wrote about it to Governor G√°lvez, he justified the raid as needing to appear strong to his Native allies, and to forestall British actions in the region.Skaggs, 219 Although Cruzat treated the raid as an act of Indian affairs, the looting and destruction of goods held at Fort St. Joseph also dissuaded a second British attack into Spanish territory.Par√©, pg 47-48 Jay's Treaty The British finally abandoned the fort after the United States victory in the Northwest Indian War and the signing of Jay's Treaty in 1795. The fort gradually fell into ruin and was overgrown. Based on its Fort St. Joseph expedition, Spain claimed lands east of the Mississippi River, but this was not recognized by the United States. With the signing of Pinckney's Treaty (1795) with the US, Spain gave up any claim of land east of the Mississippi.Skaggs, 209 Because of the long dispute over the land, the diplomats Benjamin Franklin and John Jay considered the Spanish campaign at Fort St. Joseph to have been little more than a ploy to claim the Northwest Territory. Franklin warned they want to \\"shut us up within the Appalachian Mountains.\\" Rediscovery to present Pothunters in the late 1800s recovered hundreds of artifacts from the fort site, which are now displayed in the Fort St. Joseph Museum in Niles. They include \\"trade silver, musket parts, glass beads, buttons, gunflints, knife blades, and door hinges.\\" The specific location of the 15-acre fort site was forgotten, and part of it is likely underwater since a dam downriver raised the water level. The site was not rediscovered until an archeological survey in 1998.Lou Mumford, \\"Fort St. Joseph believed located\\", South Bend Tribune, November 6, 1998 \\"Transcript of press conference given by Dr. Michael Nassaney\\", November 5, 1998, Michigan Archaeological Society website Support the Fort, a local interest group founded in 1992, has helped sponsor a major archeological excavation on site, which began in 2002. The team from Western Michigan University (WMU) has conducted a public archeology program as the project has developed. A total of 10,000 visitors have attended the annual two-day field school. WMU's related activities have included workshops for graduate students and volunteers, three week-long training programs for middle school and high school teachers, and community outreach, including biweekly lectures at the library. The seasonal excavations have uncovered rare artifacts, such as a 1730s Jesuit religious medallion, one of only two found in North America.Dr. Michael S.

In the future, they intend to construct a replica of the fort. It will include space to interpret the artifacts found through controlled excavation. This was the only fort in Michigan to have been under the flags of four nations: France, Great Britain, Spain, and the United States. It was always a multicultural site, a meeting and trading place for the ethnic Europeans with the Potowatomi, Ottawa and Ojibwe nations. It was sometimes the scene for formal marriages among the ethnicities.Nassaney, 29 References  Sources   * Nassaney, Dr. Michael S., Dr. Jose Antonio Brandao, Dr. William M. Cremins, and Brock A.

It was patterned after the French angelot or ange, which had been issued since 1340. The name derived from its representation of the archangel Michael slaying a dragon. As it was considered a new issue of the noble, it was also called the angel-noble. In 1472, the half-angel was introduced with a similar design weighing 40 grains (2.6 grams) with a diameter of 20 to 21 millimeters. Design Reverse: Depicts a ship with arms and rays of sun at the masthead. Legend: , meaning \\"By Thy cross save us, Christ Redeemer.\\" Value The angel varied in value from 6 shillings 8 pence to 11 shillings between Edward's reign and the time of James I. Under Charles I, it was last coined in 1642.Gold Pennies Florins Leopards Nobles Ryals & Angels * In 1526 during the reign of Henry VIII, it increased to seven shillings and six pence (7 s. 6 d.) or 90 pence. * In 1544, it increased again to eight shillings (8 s.) or 96 pence. * In 1550 during the reign of Edward VI it increased to ten shillings (10 s.) or 120 pence or ¬£. * In 1612 during the reign of James I it increased to eleven shillings (11 s.) or 132 pence. * In 1619 it decreased to ten shillings (10 s.) and at that point in time it weighed 70 grains (4.5 g). In 1663, Charles II replaced the existing coinage with entirely new designs struck by machine (\\"milled\\"). The standard gold coin then became the Guinea. Social impact The angel was such an iconic coin that many English pubs were named after it. The Angel Inn in Islington (after which the Angel tube station is named) was one of these. The angel was traditionally given to sufferers of the disease known as \\"king's evil\\", in a mediaeval ceremony intended to heal them with the \\"royal touch\\". After it was no longer minted, medals with the same device (called touch pieces) were given instead. The 1610 General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in Glasgow was named after the coins. M'Crie writes: \\"The bribery practised at this Assembly was shamefully notorious.

Cobb, Jr. (guitar). The band's current lineup consists of Daughtry and Justo, along with guitarists David Anderson and Steve Stone, bassist Justin Senker and drummer Rodger Stephan. Early career In the spring of 1970, three former members of the Candymen (Rodney Justo, Dean Daughtry and Robert Nix) and the Classics IV (Daughtry and James B. Cobb, Jr.) became the session band for the newly opened Studio One recording studio in Doraville, Georgia, near Atlanta. After playing on other artists' recordings, the Atlanta Rhythm Section was formed in 1971, with Justo (singer), Barry Bailey (guitar), Paul Goddard (bass), Daughtry (keyboards), Nix (drums) and Cobb (guitar). Bailey and Goddard had played together in several groups and, like the Candymen, had also backed up Roy Orbison. The group's name was thought up by Studio One's owner Buddy Buie and his two partners in the venture, Cobb and Bill Lowery. Signed by Decca Records, the band released their first album, Atlanta Rhythm Section, in January 1972. Due to the record's limited commercial success, Justo quit the band, relocating to New York City as a session singer. He was replaced by Ronnie Hammond, assistant to Studio One's engineer, Rodney Mills. Mills also later worked as the band's road manager and sound man and Buie, also the band's manager and producer as well as co-owner of Studio One, is listed first on almost all of their songwriting credits. With Hammond on board, the band's second release, Back Up Against the Wall (February 1973), also failed to sell and Decca dumped ARS from their roster. Buie's manager, Jeff Franklin, who was based in New York and had got the group the deal with Decca, was then able to get ARS signed to Polydor for their third release, Third Annual Pipe Dream, in August 1974. As a special thank-you to Bailey, Daughtry and Goddard for appearing on his pioneering 1970 Christian Rock album Mylon, We Believe, Mylon LeFevre performed on one of the Pipe Dream tracks, \\"Jesus Hearted People\\" (Buie, Bailey, Goddard, Daughtry and Rodney Mills had all been regular players at Master Sound and LeFevre's studio, LeFevre Sound, before they built Studio One). Pipe Dream yielded the band's first hit single, \\"Doraville\\", which peaked at #35 and pulled the album up to #74 on Billboards Top 200 by November 1974. The band's next two releases, Dog Days (August 1975) and Red Tape (April 1976), sold in even lesser quantities, but ARS toured extensively in 1975‚Äì1976, with numerous shows in the South, Northeast and Midwest. On July 18, 1975, the band appeared with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra during an outdoor show in Atlanta in Chastain Park. And in August of that same year, they opened both for The Who at the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Florida, and The Rolling Stones at the Municipal Auditorium in West Palm Beach, Florida. The hit years The increased exposure paid off as the group's next album, A Rock and Roll Alternative (December 1976), rose to #13 on the Billboard chart and was certified gold in the spring of 1977. The debut single from the record, \\"So in to You\\", peaked at #7 on April 30. On September 3, 1977 ARS played their biggest show yet, the Dog Day Rockfest at Atlanta's Grant Field on the campus of Georgia Tech. Heart and Foreigner were the opening acts and Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band co-headlined with ARS. In January 1978 ARS released what would turn out to be its most successful album, Champagne Jam, which led off with the song \\"Large Time\\", a tribute to Lynyrd Skynyrd, some of whom had lost their lives in a plane crash the previous October. Champagne Jam became their biggest selling album, selling over a million and certified platinum. The album provided two more hits for the band, \\"Imaginary Lover\\" (#7) and \\"I'm Not Gonna Let It Bother Me Tonight\\" (#14). On June 24, 1978 the band appeared at the Knebworth Festival in Knebworth, England, before a crowd of 60,000 on a bill that included Genesis, Jefferson Starship, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Brand X, Devo and Roy Harper. On July 1, 1978, they played before more than 80,000 at Texxas Jam at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, Texas with Walter Egan, Van Halen, Eddie Money, Head East, Journey, Heart, Ted Nugent, Aerosmith, Mahogany Rush and Cheech & Chong. On August 26, 1978, it was Canada Jam at Mosport Park in Bowmanville, Ontario, Canada, before their largest audience yet (over 110,000) with the Doobie Brothers and the Commodores, among others. The following week, ARS had a rock festival of their own, Champagne Jam, at Grant Field at Georgia Tech on September 3, 1978, which also included Santana, the Doobie Brothers, Eddie Money, Mose Jones and Mother's Finest. Three weeks later, they appeared on the White House lawn at President Jimmy Carter's invitation for his son Chip's 28th birthday party. The band had previously met Carter while he was still governor of Georgia during a press junket for their third album and had campaigned for him in 1976 during his run for the presidency. The eighth Atlanta Rhythm Section album, Underdog, was released in June 1979 and produced Top 20 hits \\"Do It or Die\\" (#19) and \\"Spooky\\" (#17), a remake of Cobb's and Buie's 1968 Classics IV hit. Early in 1979, drummer Robert Nix, the group's primary lyricist, had a falling out with manager/producer Buie over the group's musical direction. Nix wished to move in a more rocking direction while Buie was content with their current approach, which incorporated the mellower ballads. The rest of the band's dissatisfaction with Nix's excessive \\"lifestyle choices\\" sealed his fate and he was replaced by Roy Yeager, who had previously played for Lobo. Champagne Jam II on July 7, 1979 at Georgia Tech featured ARS, Aerosmith, the Cars, Dixie Dregs and Whiteface. In October, an ARS live performance from Studio One was released as the double live set Are You Ready. Besides the group's hits and popular tracks up to that time, the album also contained the fan favorite \\"Another Man's Woman\\". Decline and departures In August 1980 ARS performed three concerts in Japan alongside Cheap Trick and other acts as a part of Japan Jam 2. The Boys from Doraville (August 1980) showed a steep falling off in sales for the group as radio programmers began turning their attention away from Southern rock to other rock genres, such as new wave. The album provided no hit singles and was their last for Polydor. Another reason for the drop-off in sales may have been the departure of their advocate, Arnie Geller, from Polydor in 1977 to form the Buie/Gellar Organization and BGO Records with Buddy Buie. As a result, the group departed Polydor, which led to a breach of contract lawsuit from the company that was later settled in the band's favor. Bruce Lundvall offered a better deal at Columbia Records (CBS), who released the next ARS album, Quinella, in August 1981, containing the hit \\"Alien\\" (#29) but, like The Boys From Doraville, struggled with sales. In 1982 ARS worked on a second album for CBS, to be titled Longing For A Feeling. Before completion, CBS wanted the band to drop some of the tracks and record more. Buie and the band refused, the album was shelved, and CBS dropped its contract with ARS. Late in 1982, singer Ronnie Hammond decided to leave ARS for a solo career, joined by Buie (who ceased managing the ARS), though their work with Alabama musicians never resulted in commercial release. After buying out his partners, Buie continued to run Studio One until 1986 when he sold it to Georgia State University. Unfortunately, the cost of running the studio was too high and it was closed in 1989. Buie died at age 74 on July 18, 2015. Drummer Roy Yeager tripped over a fallen tree while the band was on tour in Daytona Beach in 1982 and suffered a severe broken leg. One of the band's road crew, Danny Biget, took over on drums, and ARS persuaded Rodney Justo to return to do some shows in early 1983. Justo had moved from session singer to lead singer again in the mid-1970s with a group from Alabama called Beaverteeth. He then left the music industry for a number of years and eventually took up a sales position with a wine company. During 1983‚Äì1984, the group went to Nashville and tried working with Buddy Buie's former associate Chips Moman, a more country-oriented producer, on a proposed new record label called Triad, in conjunction with producer Buddy Killen and former Capricorn Records head Phil Walden. But results were slow to come and, dissatisfied with this direction, bassist Paul Goddard and drummer Biget left to work with British producer Eddy Offord in another band with former Dixie Dregs keyboardist T Lavitz and guitarist Pat Buchanan, called Interpol, that was in a more progressive rock direction; unfortunately, Interpol never got off the ground. The Chips Moman Nashville project, which was given the tentative name Hardball, was completed but the album, like their previous effort for CBS, has never been released. Two new members, Tommy Stribling (bass) and Keith Hamrick (drums), joined in late 1983 and ARS, now without a recording contract, continued to play shows, mostly in the South. Greenville, South Carolina native Andy Anderson, who'd been playing with Billy Joe Royal, was recommended by his friend Hamrick in 1984 as the new front man and sang on the unreleased Moman project after Justo was let go. In 1985 the group tried a new singer, Jeff Logan, who had previously appeared with a band called High Cotton. But Logan's higher voice didn't fit with the band's musical style and Anderson soon returned as lead vocalist. Bassist Stribling went on to leave in February 1986, turning it over to Steve Stone. In late 1986, J. R. Cobb left to concentrate more on songwriting and session work at Moman's new studio in Memphis (for The Highway Men, among others) and Stribling came back to play guitar. The personnel shuffles continued as Hamrick also departed in late 1986 and was replaced by Sean Burke (who joined in early 1987). Another new lead singer, Shaun Williamson, was rolled in in 1987. In 1988, Williamson, Stribling and Stone were all let go as Bailey and Daughtry sought to revamp the band by bringing back Ronnie Hammond. Ronnie Hammond returns In 1988 Hammond, Bailey and Daughtry returned to the studio with Sean Burke and two new players, Brendan O'Brien (guitar) and J. E. Garnett (bass), to produce a new album with Buddy Buie and Rodney Mills that had more of an \\"'80s rock sound\\". Released in October 1989 on the CBS/Epic subsidiary label Imagine, Truth in a Structured Form, ARS's first album in eight years, featured a heavy drum sound that propelled almost every track and a sharper, more synthesized gloss over the songs, with all, except one, being written by Buddy Buie and Ronnie Hammond, another departure from their previous approach. O'Brien, who was co-producer as well as guitarist on the album, was invited to go on the road with the band but he declined, preferring to continue his career in session work (today he is a much in demand producer, having worked with Bob Dylan, Pearl Jam and Bruce Springsteen). Steve Stone then returned, as guitarist this time. But album sales for Truth lagged and there was another hiatus in their recorded work as the band continued to tour, with Burke's friend Justin Senker replacing Garnett on bass in May 1992 (after subbing a show for him late the previous year in Louisville, Kentucky) and R.J. Vealey taking over the drum chair from Burke in 1995 after the latter suffered a leg injury. In 1995 the group went back into the studio, this time to re-record some of their classic songs. This new collection was recorded in North Carolina and the resulting live-in-studio sound of Atlanta Rhythm Section '96 (released on CMC International in April 1996) presented a different, less polished take on some of their classic tunes and captured the sound of their live performances from that period. It was also around this time that ARS was elected to the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. The band, joined by \\"classic era\\" members Cobb, Nix and Goddard, was honored at a September 1996 induction ceremony at the Georgia World Congress Center. ARS then recorded Partly Plugged, which was released in January 1997 on the independent Southern Tracks label. It featured some new songs and more remakes of some classics. On December 28, 1998 singer Ronnie Hammond, who had battled alcoholism and depression off and on over the years, got into a confrontation with police in Macon, Georgia and forced an officer to shoot him. Hammond was seriously injured, but survived the injury and dealt with the depression. The band's fifteenth album, Eufaula, was released in February 1999 but problems occurred almost immediately as the record label, Platinum Entertainment, faced financial troubles and was not able to support the album as intended. ARS continued to tour on a limited basis. But on November 13, 1999, tragedy struck. After the band had finished an afternoon set at a concert festival in Orlando, Florida, 37-year-old drummer R. J. Vealey complained of indigestion and then collapsed and died of a heart attack. \\"It was very sudden, very shocking\\", said guitarist Barry Bailey. \\"He was a great drummer, the best drummer this band ever had.\\" ARS then continued on upon recruiting new drummer Jim Keeling. Later changes In early 1999, with Hammond hospitalized, Andy Anderson returned to front the band until Hammond was well enough to return. Anderson would return again in May 2000 to sub another show for Ronnie. In 2001, Anderson was back again after Ronnie decided to take a gig with another group, Voices of Classic Rock. Ronnie left touring altogether soon afterward to focus on family and songwriting. A retirement show for Ronnie was held on December 6, 2002, at the club Whiskey River in Macon. Ronnie performed, backed by Dean Daughtry, Justin Senker, Steve Stone, Jim Keeling, Wendall Cox (from Travis Tritt's band) and Mike Causey (from Stillwater). Hammond died on March 14, 2011, in Forsyth, Georgia, at age 60 of heart failure. In early 2006, Barry Bailey, suffering from multiple sclerosis, retired from the group to take care of his wife, who was sick with cancer (which took her life on July 6, 2006). Steve Stone played most of the lead from this point on and Andy Anderson's long-time Billy Joe Royal bandmate and golf buddy, Alan Accardi, was brought in as second guitarist. Alan, a Nashville veteran, would stay with the band for more than a year but it was clear that a player with more of a rock sound was needed, so a friend of Jim Keeling, Huntsville, Alabama native David Anderson, from the band Brother Cane, was brought in as the new guitarist in April 2007. In 2006 former ARS drummer Roy Yeager was involved in a controversy concerning the destruction of a Tennessee American Civil War landmark.Jenkins House At Stones River Destroyed For Development by Deborah Fitts, Civil War News August, 2006. On March 26, 2008 singer Andy Anderson suffered a heart attack just before he was to catch a plane to Las Vegas to join the band for a two-night stand at the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino. Andy's friend Steve Croson (who'd played alongside him for years in Billy Joe Royal's band) lived in Vegas and was able to step in on short notice. In April and May, original singer Rodney Justo returned, joined by ARS's 1987‚Äì88 singer Shaun Williamson, until Andy was healthy enough to return in May. The return of Paul Goddard and Rodney Justo In May 2011 Rodney Justo and original bassist Paul Goddard returned after a 28-year absence. Paul's second tenure with the band was short-lived as he died of cancer on April 29, 2014. After Paul's death, ARS continued to play shows with a lineup of Rodney Justo, Dean Daughtry, Steve Stone, Dave Anderson, Justin Senker and Jim Keeling. Keeling, who left ARS to spend more time with his family, was replaced in March 2016 by Justo's friend Rodger Stephan (who had also played drums with Marty Balin). During the spring of 2017, Atlanta keyboardist Lee Shealey was brought in to sub for Dean Daughtry, who had a broken wrist. And from August to October of that same year, singer Andy Anderson returned to the band yet again to stand in for Justo, who was recovering from back surgery. Present day The band still tours, playing mostly festivals and nostalgia-themed concerts. Their most recent album of new recordings, With All Due Respect (May 2011), was largely covers of other artists' songs (Lynyrd Skynyrd, Allman Brothers, etc.) alongside re-recordings of classic ARS tunes, done at Southern Tracks Studios with longtime engineer Rodney Mills. The album also featured guest performances by Rodney Justo and Paul Goddard, just before they rejoined the group, and Ronnie Hammond, in his final recorded appearance. From The Vaults (May 2012), released on the Fuel label, was a double CD collection of unreleased tracks both studio and live and even featured some pre-ARS Candymen performances.

The book has been broadly embraced by the professional and amateur magic community but initially met with negative reviews from the two major US trade publications MAGIC and Genii. Demand for the book has been high, despite the initial inability of the original publisher to reprint the text. Ownership of the copyright has recently returned to the author (along with two other books Darwin Ortiz At The Card Table and Cardshark) and the books are once again being made available to the trade. Ortiz's second book on magic theory, Designing Miracles is an exposition on the design of powerful magical effects, and is subtitled Creating the Illusion of Impossibility. The book posits and analyzes various theories regarding the perception and cognition of lay audiences and provides practical examples and advice on the construction of effects, aimed at maximizing their impact and deceptiveness to a lay audience. The most recent book published with Darwin Ortiz's original routines was Lessons in Card Mastery. Ortiz's major work for the lay public on gaming protection is Gambling Scams 1984. He also authored an influential annotation of S. W. Erdnase's The Expert at the Card Table titled The Annotated Erdnase in 1991 which was published to the magic trade.

As with many Catholic prayers, the name Angelus is derived from its incipit--the first few words of the text: Angelus Domini nuntiavit Mari√¶ (\\"The Angel of the Lord declared unto Mary\\"). The devotion is practised by reciting as versicle and response three Biblical verses narrating the mystery, alternating with the prayer \\"Hail Mary\\". The Angelus exemplifies a species of prayers called the \\"prayer of the devotee\\".Prayer: a history by Philip Zaleski, 2005 p. 128 The devotion was traditionally recited in Roman Catholic churches, convents, and monasteries three times daily: 06:00, 12:00 and 18:00 (many churches still follow the devotion, and some practice it at home). The devotion is also observed by some Anglican, Western Rite Orthodox, and Lutheran churches. The Angelus is usually accompanied by the ringing of the Angelus bell, which is a call to prayer and to spread goodwill to everyone. The angel referred to in the prayer is Gabriel, a messenger of God who revealed to the Virgin Mary that she would conceive a child to be born the Son of God (Luke 1:26‚Äì38). History According to Herbert Thurston, the Angelus originated with the 11th-century monastic custom of reciting three Hail Marys at the evening, or Compline, bell.Thurston, Herbert. \\"Angelus.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 27 April 2020 The first written documentation stems from the Italian Franciscan friar Sinigardi di Arezzo (died 1282).Schauerle 218 Franciscan friaries in Italy document the use in 1263 and 1295. The current form of the Angelus prayer is included in a Venetian Catechism from 1560. The older usages seem to have commemorated the resurrection of Christ in the morning, his suffering at noon, and the annunciation in the evening. In 1269, St Bonaventure urged the faithful to adopt the custom of the Franciscans of saying three Hail Marys as the Compline bell was rung.Schauerle 220 The Angelus is not identical to the \\"Noon Bell\\" ordered by Pope Calixtus III (1455‚Äì58) in 1456, who asked for a long midday bell-ringing and prayer for protection against the Turkish invasions of his time. In his 1956 Apostolic Letter Dum Maerenti Animo about the persecution of the Catholic church in Eastern Europe and China, Pope Pius XII recalls the 500th anniversary of the \\"Noon Bell\\", a prayer crusade ordered by his predecessors against what they considered to be dangers from the East. He again asks the faithful throughout the world, to pray for the persecuted Church in the East during the mid-day Angelus. The custom of reciting it in the morning apparently grew from the monastic custom of saying three Hail Marys while a bell rang at Prime. The noon time custom apparently arose from the noon time commemoration of the Passion on Fridays. The institution of the Angelus is by some ascribed to Pope Urban II, by some to Pope John XXII in the year 1317. The triple recitation is ascribed to Louis XI of France, who in 1472 ordered it to be recited three times daily. The form of the prayer was standardised by the 17th century. The manner of ringing the Angelus‚Äîthe triple stroke repeated three times, with a pause between each set of three (a total of nine strokes), sometimes followed by a longer peal as at curfew‚Äîseems to have been long established. The 15th-century constitutions of Syon monastery dictate that the lay brother \\"shall toll the Ave bell nine strokes at three times, keeping the space of one Pater and Ave between each three tollings\\".Schauerle 221 The pattern of ringing on Irish radio and television consists of three groups of three peals, each group separated by a pause, followed by a group of nine peals, for a total of eighteen rings.Recording of the Angelus on Irish television 2007-01-02. In his Apostolic Letter Marialis Cultus (1974), Pope Paul VI encouraged the praying of the Angelus considering it important and a reminder to faithful Catholics of the Paschal Mystery, in which by recalling the incarnation of the son of God they pray that they may be led \\"through his passion and cross to the glory of his resurrection.\\" Modern usage It is common practice that during the recital of the Angelus prayer, for the lines \\"And the Word was made flesh/And dwelt among us\\", those reciting the prayer bow or genuflect. Either of these actions draws attention to the moment of the Incarnation of Christ into human flesh. During Paschaltide, the Marian antiphon Regina C≈ìli with versicle and prayer, is used in place of the Angelus. In some Catholic schools, the Angelus is recited periodically. In most Franciscan and contemplative monasteries, the Angelus continues to be prayed three times a day. In Germany, particular dioceses and their radio stations ring the Angelus. In addition, Roman Catholic churches (and some Protestant ones) ring the Angelus bell thrice daily. In Ireland, the Angelus is currently broadcast every night before the main evening news at 18:00 on the main national TV channel, RT√â One, and on the broadcaster's sister radio station, Radio 1, at noon and 18:00. In 2015, in advertising for a commission to independent film makers to produce versions of the Angelus, RT√â described the playing of the Angelus as follows: > The daily \\"Angelus\\" broadcast on RT√â One is by far RT√â's longest-running and > most watched Religious programme. It's also, possibly, the most > controversial. For some, the reflective slot, which airs for just one minute > in every 1440 per day and on only one RT√â TV channel, is as much part of > Ireland's unique cultural identity as the harp on your passport; for others, > it's an anachronism ‚Äì a reminder of more homogeneously and observantly > Christian times. RT√â Audience Research finds that a clear majority of Irish viewers still favours keeping the \\"Angelus\\" broadcasts, chimes and all. Its appeal is summarised by one audience member as follows: \\"To the person of faith, it's a moment of grace; to the person without faith, it's a moment of peace. What's not to like?\\" The station also notes that the prayer itself is never broadcast. The Angelus is broadcast daily on radio in the city of Monterrey, Mexico, at 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00. In Brazil, radio stations associated with the Catholic Radio Network (Rede Cat√≥lica de R√°dio in Portuguese) broadcast the Angelus daily at 18:00, radio stations that are not affiliated with the network but are run by Catholic personnel also broadcast the prayer at the same hour. : In the Philippines, radio and television stations run by the Catholic Church and some religious orders broadcast the Angelus at 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00. The devotion is also broadcast over the public address system at noon and 18:00 in some shopping malls, and in many Catholic educational institutions mostly at noon on schooldays (some only ring bells at 18:00). In the United States and Canada, some Catholic radio stations run by laity broadcast the Angelus daily. American Trappist monasteries and convents often combine the Angelus with midday prayers or Vespers and pray them together in the Church. At the Roman Catholic University of Portland, the bell tower near the centre of campus tolls the Angelus at noon and 18:00. Papal custom Pope Francis during the Angelus Address in Vatican City, 2018. In Vatican City since Pope John XXIII, the Pope delivers an address every Sunday at noon. Pope John spoke of the Angelus \\"as a summary of 'the christian epic' in three books: the divine invitation and initiative; the human response of obedience, fiat; and the result of this obedience, the Word made flesh.\\"Hebblethwaite, Peter. \\"The Mariology of Three Popes\\", Mary in Christian Tradition, p. 55 Known informally as the Angelus Address (\\"Regina C≈ìli Address\\" during Eastertide), the short ritual is broadcast by public television (Rai Uno) and Eurovision Network. At the end of the Address, the Pope leads recitation of the Angelus or Regina C≈ìli, and concludes with a blessing upon the crowds in Saint Peter's Square and televiewers. Anglican practice The Angelus is found in two popular twentieth-century Anglo- Catholic manuals of devotion. The Practice of Religion: A Short Manual of Instructions and Devotions by Archibald Campbell Knowles, first published in 1908, refers to the Angelus as \\"the memorial of the Incarnation\\" and notes that \\"In the Mystery of the Incarnation we worship and adore Our Lord as God of God, we honour and reverence Saint Mary as 'Blessed among women.' In honouring Mary, the Instrument of the Incarnation, we really honour Christ, Who became Incarnate.\\"Knowles, Archibald Campbell, The Practice of Religion: A Short Manual of Instructions and Devotions, New York: Morehouse-Gorham Co., 7th ed., 1935. p. 183. The Angelus is also found in Saint Augustine's Prayer Book: A Book of Devotion for members of the Episcopal Church, first published in 1947 (Revised Edition, 1967).Gavitt, Loren, ed., Saint Augustine's Prayer Book: A Book of Devotion for members of the Episcopal Church, West Park, New York: Holy Cross Publications, Revised Edition, 1967. p. 18. In many Anglo- Catholic communities of the Anglican Communion, there is a tradition of singing the Angelus,An example from a Lincolnshire, England, Anglican church. particularly before or after the Sunday parish Mass.Demonstration video by an Anglican priest on his YouTube channel.\\"Singing the Angelus as part of Anglican patrimony\\", article on the English Roman Catholic Ordinariate news page.

In the published Anglican versions of the Angelus, the text of the concluding collect of the Annunciation is: We beseech Thee, O LORD, pour Thy grace into our hearts; that as we have known the Incarnation of Thy Son, Jesus Christ, by the message of an angel, so by His Cross and Passion we may be brought unto the glory of His Resurrection. Through the same Jesus Christ our Lord. In poetry The poem \\"The Irish Unionist's Farewell\\" by Sir John Betjeman has this line \\"and the Angelus is calling\\". Francis Bret Harte wrote \\"The Angelus\\" referencing the twilight tolling of the Angelus bell at a Californian mission. Denis Florence MacCarthy's poem \\"The Bell-Founder\\" describes the fashioning of Angelus bells. Angelus is mentioned in Book 11 of Pan Tadeusz by Adam Mickiewicz. Francis Jammes' most famous collection of poems is the 1897 De l'ang√©lus de l'aube √† l'ang√©lus du soir (\\"From morning Angelus to evening Angelus\\"). In \\"The Angelus\\", Donegal poet Elizabeth Shane portrays an elderly couple cutting peat reminiscent of the scene in Millet's painting.Shane, Elizabeth. \\"The Angelus\\" In a poem set to music circa 1919, \\"The Foggy Dew\\", Canon Charles O'Neill (1887‚Äì1963) memorialized the Easter Rising also known as the Easter Rebellion of 1916. One of the lines reads: \\"But the Angelus Bell o'er the Liffey's swell rang out in the foggy dew\\". A poem by E A Poe \\"A Catholic Hymn\\" and various similar names in 1835 as part of a short story and again in 1845. Apparently written after hearing the Angelus bells whilst passing a church. Angelus bell The Angelus, in all its stages of development, was closely associated with the ringing of a church bell. The bell is still rung in some English country churches and has often been mistaken for, and alleged to be a remnant of, the curfew bell. The Angelus is replaced by Regina Coeli during Eastertide, and is not recited on Good Friday or Holy Saturday. The ringing of the Angelus bell may have been inspired by St. Francis of Assisi after his 1219 visit to the Holy Land, where he observed the call of the muezzin five times a day, calling Muslims to prayer. https://anglicanfocus.org.au/2019/09/30/the-saint-and-the-sultan/ https://mushare.marian.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context;=fp_deng Where the town bell and the bells of the principal church or monastery were distinct, the curfew was generally rung upon the town bell. Where the church bell served for both purposes, the Ave and the curfew were probably rung upon the same bell at different hours. The ringing of the Angelus in the 14th century and even in the 13th century must have been very general. The number of bells belonging to these two centuries that still survive is relatively low, but a considerable proportion bear inscriptions that suggest that they were originally intended to serve as Ave bells. Many bear the words Ave Maria; or, as in the case of a bell at Helfta, near Eisleben, in Germany, dated 1234, the whole sentence: Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum. Bells inscribed with Ave Maria are also numerous in England, but there the Angelus bells seem in a very large number of instances to have been dedicated to St Gabriel, the angel mentioned in the prayer (Luke 1:26‚Äì27). In the Diocese of Lincoln alone there are nineteen surviving medieval bells bearing the name of Gabriel, while only six bear the name of Michael, a much more popular patron in other respects. In France, the Ave Maria seems to have been the ordinary label for Angelus bells; but in Germany the most common inscription of all, even in the case of many bells of the 13th century, is the words O Rex Glori√¶ Veni Cum Pace (\\"O King of Glory, Come with Peace\\"). In Germany, the Netherlands, and in some parts of France, the Angelus bell was regularly known as the Peace bell, and pro pace schlagen (to toll for peace) was a phrase popularly used for ringing the Angelus. In Italy the three recitals of the Angelus are referred to as avemmaria, hence L' avemmaria del giorno, L' avemmaria del mezzo giorno and L' avemmaria della sera. It was customary at one time to calculate hours of the day from the evening Angelus, or avemmaria for short. Hence the origin of the phrase that appears in Leoncavallo's opera Pagliacci: \\"venti tre ore\\"' (\\"the twenty-third hour\\") refers to one hour before the evening Angelus.  Music  Franz Biebl set the prayer for two men's choirs, called Ave Maria (Angelus Domini), published also in versions for mixed choirs.

It is one of two comprehensive high schools in the Traverse City Area Public Schools district.  History  The first public school in Traverse City opened in 1853. In 1877, it was moved to a new building called the Central School, built at Seventh and Pine Streets, which was rebuilt as a brick building in 1886. In 1934, the Central school building burned down, and students were relocated to the nearby Perry Hannah House while the school was being rebuilt. In 1959, grades 10 through 12 moved into a new building called Traverse City Senior High School at its present day location, on grounds formerly owned by the Northwestern Michigan College. In 1997, because of overcrowding at the school, which had become one of the largest high schools in Michigan, a second high school was built, and opened in early 1998. The new high school became Traverse City West Senior High School, and the existing one was renamed to Traverse City Central High School.left  Demographics  The demographic breakdown of the 1,426 students enrolled in 2018-19 was: * Male - 49.8% * Female - 50.2% * Native American - 1.5% * Asian - 1.9% * Black - 1.3% * Hispanic - 4.0% * Pacific Islander - 0.2% * White - 88.7% * Multiracial - 2.3% In addition, 26.9% of students were eligible for reduced-price or free lunch.  Athletics  Traverse City Central's sports teams are known as the Trojans. The school is part of the Big North Conference, and is considered a Class A school by MHSAA. Central has an intense across-town rivalry with Traverse City West Senior High Titans. Each year, the schools hold an annual football game to honor veterans known as the \\"Patriot Game\\".

It is the second feature film directed by Kubrick, the first being his 1953 debut feature Fear and Desire. The film stars Jamie Smith, Irene Kane, and Frank Silvera.. The film is about Davey Gordon (Jamie Smith), a 29-year-old welterweight New York boxer at the end of his career, and his relationship with his neighbor, taxi dancer Gloria Price (Irene Kane), and her violent employer Vincent Rapallo (Frank Silvera). Plot The drama begins with Davey in his apartment room, mentally preparing for a big fight against Kid Rodriguez. On the other side of the building across the courtyard, he gazes upon Gloria, an attractive taxi dancer, getting ready for work. As they both walk out of the building, they run into each other but say nothing. Gloria is picked up by her boss Vincent. As Davey is losing his fight, Gloria is dealing with her boss in his office as he tries to kiss her repeatedly. That evening Davey is awakened by screams coming from Gloria's apartment. As he looks across the courtyard, he sees that Gloria is being attacked by Vincent. He runs to her room, but Vincent has made his getaway. Davey comforts Gloria and she goes to sleep comfortable that Davey is in the room to protect her. However, Vincent is not deterred and proceeds to interfere in their lives. When they decide to leave town, Davey and Gloria arrange to get money they are each owed. Gloria tries to get money from Vincent at the dance hall, and Davey asks his manager to meet him there as well. When a street performer steals Davey's scarf, he chases after him. Davey's manager arrives but does not see Davey. Vincent sends two goons out to rough Davey up, but they mistake the manager for Davey and kill him in the alley. Vincent kidnaps Gloria and has his two goons hold her hostage. Davey returns to Gloria's apartment and sees the police across the courtyard in his apartment. They assume he killed his manager. Davey leaves to rescue Gloria, but he is captured and restrained as well, leading to a chase and confrontation in an abandoned warehouse full of mannequins. During the struggle, Davey kills Vincent and rescues Gloria. He and Gloria are cleared of all charges by the police, and Davey buys a train ticket back to the West Coast. At the train station, Davey assumes she will not join him, but at the last minute, Gloria rushes in, and they kiss. Cast Background This was Kubrick's second feature. Kubrick removed his first film Fear and Desire from circulation over his dissatisfaction with it. Kubrick directed it between the ages of 23 and 24, and had to borrow $40,000 from his uncle Martin Perveler, who owned a chain of drug stores in Los Angeles. The film, originally titled Kiss Me, Kill Me, was also financed privately through family and friends, but because Fear and Desire did not recoup its production budget, Perveler did not invest this time. Most of the initial budget was covered by Morris Bousel, a Bronx pharmacist who was rewarded with a co-producer credit. Kubrick began to shoot the film with sound recorded on location, as was common practice in Hollywood. However, frustrated by the intrusion of the microphone into his lighting scheme, Kubrick fired his sound-man and decided to post-dub the entire film as he had with his first film.Hughes, David (2000). The Complete Kubrick. Virgin Publishing Ltd, pp. 26-27. The film is notable for its location shots in the old Penn Station, which was demolished in 1963, as well as Times Square, and the run-down streets of the Brooklyn waterfront and Soho loft areas. Ballerina Ruth Sobotka, Kubrick's wife at the time, was the art director for this film, as well as for Kubrick's next, The Killing. She is also featured in a long dance solo, playing the role of Iris. Irene Kane (real life writer Chris Chase, n√©e Irene Greengard) is the female lead. Against Kubrick's wishes, United Artists required the film be recut with a happy ending. United Artists paid $100,000 for the film and also agreed to provide $100,000 for Kubrick's next, The Killing.Tino Balio, United Artists: The Company That Changed the Film Industry, University of Wisconsin Press, 1987 p. 157 The film features a song \\"Once\\", written by Norman Gimbel and Arden Clar. It is one of Gimbel's earliest contributions to a film, although his lyrics do not actually appear in the final version. Reception film trailer Critical response When released, the staff at Variety magazine gave the film a mixed review, and wrote, \\"Ex-Look photographer Stanley Kubrick turned out Killer's Kiss on the proverbial shoestring. Kiss was more than a warm-up for Kubrick's talents, for not only did he co-produce but he directed, photographed and edited the venture from his own screenplay [originally written by Howard Sackler] and original story...Kubrick's low-key lensing occasionally catches the flavor of the seamy side of Gotham life. His scenes of tawdry Broadway, gloomy tenements and grotesque brick-and-stone structures that make up Manhattan's downtown eastside loft district help offset the script's deficiencies.\\"Variety film review (1955); last accessed February 21, 2008. More recently, New York Times film critic Janet Maslin reviewed the film, and wrote, \\"Killer's Kiss brought the director onto more conventional territory, with a film noir plot about a boxer, a gangster and a dance hall girl. Using Times Square and even the subway as his backdrop, Mr. Kubrick worked in an uncharacteristically naturalistic style despite the genre material, with mixed but still fascinating results. The actress playing the dance hall girl, billed as Irene Kane, is the writer Chris Chase, whose work has frequently appeared in The New York Times. Jamie Smith plays the boxer, whose career is described as 'one long promise without fulfillment.' In the case of Mr. Kubrick's own career, the fulfillment came later. But here is the promise.\\"Maslin, Janet. Ibid. Rotten Tomatoes rates it 84% \\"Fresh,\\" based on eighteen reviews.

He is best known for his translation of Beowulf, still widely used in universities, colleges and high schools. Other important translations include Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote,, Poems and Prose from the Old English, The Voice of the Night: Complete Poetry and Prose of Chairil Anwar, The Essential Horace, and Rabelais' Gargantua and Pantagruel and Dante's The Divine Comedy.  Biography  Raffel was born in New York City in 1928. An alumnus of James Madison High School in Brooklyn, New York (1944), Raffel was educated at Brooklyn College (B.A., 1948), Ohio State University (M.A., 1949), and Yale Law School (J.D., 1958). As a Ford Foundation fellow, Raffel taught English in Makassar, Indonesia from 1953 to 1955. Following the completion of his legal studies and admission to the New York State Bar in 1959, Raffel practiced law as an associate at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy before deciding that he was not suited to practice law. Between 1960 and 1963, he served as founding editor of Foundation News, a trade journal published by the Council on Foundations. From 1989 until his death, he held the Chair in Humanities at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, ultimately retiring from active service as distinguished professor emeritus of arts and humanities and professor emeritus of English in 2003. Previously, he taught at Brooklyn College (lecturer in English, 1950‚Äì51), Stony Brook University (instructor of English, 1964‚Äì65; assistant professor of English, 1965‚Äì66), the University at Buffalo (associate professor of English, 1966‚Äì68), the University of Haifa (visiting professor of English, 1968‚Äì69), the University of Texas at Austin (visiting professor of English, 1969‚Äì70; professor of English and classics and chair of the graduate program in comparative literature, 1970‚Äì71), the Ontario College of Art (senior tutor, 1971‚Äì72), York University (visiting professor of humanities, 1972‚Äì75), Emory University (visiting professor, spring 1974) and the University of Denver (professor of English, 1975‚Äì89). Raffel died on September 29, 2015 at the age of 87.http://www.mourning.com/obituaries/Burton-Nathan- Raffel/http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/2015/09/30/author-professor- burton-raffel-dies/73085732/  Translations  He translated many poems, including the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf, poems by Horace, and Gargantua and Pantagruel by Fran√ßois Rabelais. In 1964, Raffel recorded an album along with Robert P. Creed, on Folkways Records entitled Lyrics from the Old English. In 1996, he published his translation of Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote, which has been acclaimed for making Cervantes more accessible to the modern generation. In 2006, Yale University Press published his new translation of the Nibelungenlied. Among his many edited and translated publications are Poems and Prose from the Old English, and Chr√©tien de Troyes' Clig√®s, Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart, Perceval, the Story of the Grail, Erec and Enide, and Yvain, the Knight of the Lion. Raffel worked with Yale University Press and Harold Bloom on a series of 14 annotated Shakespeare plays. In 2008 the Modern Library published his new translation of Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales. Raffel's main contribution to translation theory was the principle of \\"syntactic tracking\\", which he championed in a monograph published in 1994.Burton Raffel, The Art of Translating Prose, University Park PA: Penn State University Press, 1994. According to this theory, a good translation of a prose literary text should track the syntax of the original element-by-element, never joining sentences where the original separated them, never splitting a long sentence, never rearranging the order of ideas. The accuracy of tracking is measured syntactically by counting punctuation marks: the best translation will be the one which comes closest to the original in a statistical analysis of commas, colons and full stops. Raffel claimed that those translators who heed the syntax also make the best lexical choices, so that tracking becomes a measure not only of syntactic accuracy but of translating skills per se. This principle has since been applied in scholarly studies of translations of classical and modern works.For example: Steven J. Willett, \\"Thucydides Domesticated and 'Foreignized'\\". In: Arion 7,2 (1999), 118‚Äì145; Graeme Dunphy, \\"Tracking Christa Wolf: Problembew√§ltigung und syntaktische Pr√§zision in der englischen und franz√∂sischen √úbersetzung von Kindheitsmuster\\", in Michael Neecke & Lu Jiang, Un√ºbersetzbar? Zur Kritik der literarischen √úbersetzung, Hamburg 2013, 35‚Äì60.  Literary production  Over the years he published numerous volumes of poetry; however, only one remains in print: Beethoven in Denver. Beethoven describes what happens when the dead composer visits Denver, Colorado in the late 1970s. Also set in Colorado was the Raffel-scripted film, The Legend of Alfred Packer, the first film version of the story of Alferd Packer.

It is found principally in the mouths of tropical American and African rivers. Sawfish (SS-276) was laid down on 20 January 1942 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard, Kittery, Maine; launched on 23 June 1942; sponsored by Hattie Wyatt Caraway, the first woman to be elected to the United States Senate; and commissioned on 26 August 1942, Lieutenant Commander Eugene T. Sands in command. After shakedown‚Äîoff Portsmouth, in Narragansett Bay, and en route to the Panama Canal‚Äîthe new submarine arrived at Pearl Harbor on 21 January 1943. Ten days later, she got underway for the first of her 10 war patrols.  First and second war patrols, January ‚Äì June 1943  Sawfish proceeded to waters off southwestern Japan where she attacked several targets and concluded that she had sunk or damaged some. However, they turned out to be two neutral Soviet cargo ships, Ilmen and Kola. A careful study of Japanese and American records after the war did not confirm any other sinkings on Sawfishs first war patrol, which ended when she reached Midway on 25 March. The submarine departed Midway on 15 April and headed for Japan. On 5 May off the coast of Honsh≈´, she sank the converted gunboat, Hakkai Maru. A fortnight later, she stalked an enemy task force but lost her quarry in heavy swells. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 6 June.  Third war patrol, June ‚Äì August 1943  Underway again on the last day of the month, Sawfish set course for the East China Sea. On the night of 21 July, she attacked convoy Hi-3 of nine ships and concluded that she had scored several hits. However, postwar assessment of records was unable to confirm any kills during this attack or during her operations for the next five days. Finally, early on the morning of 27 July, her luck changed when she attacked a convoy escorted by a 720-ton minelayer. Comdr. Sands fired a spread of four torpedoes from a range of only . He went deep as soon as the ‚Äúfish‚Äù were clear and, in less than half a minute, the submarine was jolted by a violent explosion. Fearing that the detonation had been premature, Sands remained deep for over an hour. When he ascended to periscope depth, the convoy had escaped, but the escort, coastal minelayer, Hirashima, was sinking. Sawfish returned to Pearl Harbor on 10 August.  Fourth and fifth war patrols, September ‚Äì December 1943  During her fourth patrol, 10 September to 16 October, defective torpedoes frustrated the seven attacks which she made in the Sea of Japan before she returned to Midway. She got underway for the Bonins and her fifth patrol on 1 November. On 8 December, she sank 3,267-ton passenger-cargo ship, Sansei Maru, and returned to Midway on 19 December. She soon proceeded to Hunter's Point Navy Yard, San Francisco, California, for overhaul.  Sixth and seventh war patrols, April ‚Äì August 1944  Back in top trim, the submarine returned to Pearl Harbor early in the spring. On 8 April 1944, she got underway for Japanese waters and her sixth war patrol. However, she only encountered two targets: a cargo ship which she attacked on 25 April and a second vessel which she sighted four days later‚Äîtoo fast and too far away for the submarine to attack. Although the submarine reported scoring two hits on the cargo ship, Japanese records contain no evidence of any sinking in the vicinity of the attack. During her seventh war patrol, Sawfish joined and for wolfpack operations. The submarines sortied from Majuro on 22 June and headed for the Philippines. On 18 July, she damaged a tanker and, on 26 July, fired a spread of four torpedoes at surfaced Japanese submarine (one of only six Axis powers submarines to attempt trans- oceanic Yanagi missions), which exploded and sank. After a fruitless chase of a large Japanese convoy, the wolfpack ended the patrol at Pearl Harbor on 15 August.  Eighth war patrol, September ‚Äì November 1944  During Sawfish's eighth war patrol, her commanding officer, Comdr. Alan B. Banister, led a wolfpack which included , and from time to time other submarines. The pack departed Pearl Harbor on 9 September and headed for waters south of Formosa where the submarines took a heavy toll on enemy shipping. Sawfish, herself, accounted for a 6,521-ton tanker, Tachibana Maru, on 9 October and a 6,838-ton seaplane tender, , on 23 October. During the patrol, Sawfish also served on lifeguard station off Formosa in support of carrier raids. On 16 October, she rescued a pilot from VF-15 of ) who had survived four and one-half days at sea in a small rubber boat without food, water, or sunshade. The wolfpack returned to Majuro on 8 November.  Ninth and tenth war patrols, December 1944 ‚Äì April 1945  Sawfish got underway on 17 December 1944 and returned to waters off Formosa where she spent her entire ninth war patrol on lifeguard station. She rescued a pilot on 21 January 1945 before heading toward Guam. She reached Apra Harbor on 4 February for refit. Sawfish sailed on 10 March for her 10th and last war patrol which she spent on lifeguard station off Nansei Shoto supporting air strikes preparing for and covering the conquest of Okinawa. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 26 April and soon proceeded to San Francisco for overhaul in the Bethlehem Steel Company yard there.  Post-war service  She was ready for action and heading toward Hawaii on 15 August when hostilities ended. She reached Pearl Harbor on 22 August but soon headed back to the west coast for duty as a training ship for the West Coast Fleet Sound School. She returned to Hawaii early in 1946, but was back at San Francisco on 22 March for inactivation. She was decommissioned on 26 June 1946 and remained in reserve at Mare Island Naval Shipyard until May 1947 when she proceeded to San Pedro for duty as a Naval Reserve training ship. On 1 April 1960, Sawfish was stricken from the Navy List and scrapped. Sawfish received eight battle stars for service during World War II.

It is composed of 19 verses (ƒÅyƒÅt). It is sometimes also known as S≈´rat IqrƒÅ (, \\"Read\\"). Chapter 96 is traditionally believed to have been Muhammad's first revelation. While on retreat in the Cave of Hira, located at Mountain Jabal al-Nour near Mecca, Gabriel appears before Muhammad and commands him to ‚ÄúRead!‚Äù. He responded, ‚ÄúBut I cannot read!‚Äù. Then the angel Gabriel embraced him tightly and then revealed to him the first lines, ‚ÄúRead: In the name of your Lord Who created, (1) Created man from a clot. (2) Read: And your Lord is the Most Generous, (3) Who taught by the pen, (4) Taught man that which he knew not.‚Äù (Bukhari 4953). It is traditionally understood the first five ayats (1‚Äì5) of Surah Alaq were revealed, however this is not the first fully complete Surah to be revealed and was actually revealed in 3 parts.  The meaning of 'alaq  The linguistic definition of  ªalaq (singular  ªalaqah ) is \\"leech\\", \\"medicinal leech\\", \\"coagulated blood\\", \\"blood clot\\", or \\"the early stage of the embryo\\".Sahin, H. (2006). \\"Alaq\\". In O. Leaman (Ed.), The Qur‚Äôan: An Encyclopedia: Routledge  ªAlaq is also a derivative of  ªalaqa which means \\"attached and hanging to something.\\"Hussain, S. (1980). The Clot (al-‚ÄòAlaq). The Islamic Quarterly, Vol. 24, no. 3-4, pp. 107-1wklfn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\10. Professor Abdul Haleem mentions that \\" ªalaq‚Äù can also mean anything that clings: a clot of blood, a leech, even a lump of mud. All these meanings involve the basic idea of clinging or sticking.\\"Abdel Haleem, M. A. (2005). The Qur æan.

(2012). \\"Embryology in the Qur‚Äôan: The ‚ÄòAlaqah Stage\\" (page 6), http://islampapers.com/2012/02/09/alaqah Period of revelation This sura has two parts: the first consists of vv. 1‚Äì5, and the second of vv. 6‚Äì19. The majority of Islamic scholars agreed that the first part forms the first revelation to be sent down to Muhammad in 610. In this regard, the Hadith from Aisha, which Ibn Hanbal, Bukhari, Muslim and other traditionists have related with several chains of authorities, is one of the most authentic Hadith on the subject. In it Aisha narrates the full story of the beginning of revelation as she herself heard it from Muhammad. Besides, Ibn Abbas, Abu Musa al-Ashari and a group of the Companions also are reported to have stated that these were the very first verses of the Quran to be revealed to Muhammad. The second part was revealed later, when Muhammad began to perform the prescribed prayer in the precincts of the Kaaba, and Abu Jahl tried to prevent him from this with threats. 96:1-5 The first revelation  The first five verses of this sura are believed by some to be the first verses of the Qur'an claimed to be related by Muhammad. He received them while on a retreat in a mountain cave at Hira, just outside the city of Makkah in 610 CE. A few commentators disagree with this account, claiming that the first revelation was the beginning of surat al-Muddaththir or surat al-Fatiha, but theirs is a minority position. Moreover, the term ‚ÄòInsan‚Äô which is translated to man or human appears 65 times in the Qur'an, applying to both sexes of mankind, a generic ‚Äòman‚Äô.Haleem, M. A.. The Qur'an: a new translation. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008. The concept of a divinity telling a human to speak is found in many cultures, and parallels have been drawn between Muhammad's experience and that recounted by Beda Venerabilis in what is called \\"Caedmon's Hymn\\".  96:6‚Äì19 the morality and beliefs of mankind  The remainder of the sura, claimed to have been revealed later, questions the morality and beliefs of mankind, who \\"thinks himself self-sufficient\\", unaware that all things will return to their Lord. Once man becomes self-satisfied, he has the tendency to transgress. These ayahs were revealed shortly after Muhammed started to pray publicly, as many people questioned his actions. The text continues, addressing the impiety of \\"the man who forbids Our servant to pray\\". These later lines are thought to date from the time when Muhammad began to pray the salat in the Kaaba. Abu Jahl attempted to interrupt the prayer by trampling on Muhammad's neck while he was prostrated. \\"Does he not realize that God sees all?\\" The Qur'an commands Muhammad (and by inference all believers) to continue the prayer regardless, as those who persecute the faithful are unaware that God sees what they do. After the first 8 ayahs were revealed, Muhammed left the cave at Hira, and then surahs Ad-Duha, Nashra, and the second part of this surah were revealed after 6 months. More specifically, ayahs 9‚Äì14 were revealed when Muhammed first began praying publicly near the Ka‚ÄôBah because the Meccans didn't comprehend what he was doing. These were directed towards people who tried to stop others from making devotions toward Allah. Once Abu Jahl (member of the Quraish) saw Muhammed praying publicly, he thought that Muhammed had adopted a new religion and tried to drive him away from the Ka‚ÄôBah. He gathered a crowd and asked: ‚ÄúIs Muhammed setting his face on the ground in front of you (praying)?‚Äù When they replied in affirmative he said: ‚Äúby the gods Al-Lat and Al-Uzza, if I ever catch him in that act of worship (salah), I will set my foot on his neck and rub his face in the dust.‚Äù Abu Jahl wanted to follow through on his threat, but when he saw Muhammed he stepped forward, motioned to put his foot on his neck, but then became frightened and left. When asked about it later, he said that he had seen a vision of a ditch right in front of Muhammed, filled with fire and a ghoul with fiery wings. After Muhammed heard about the remark, he said: ‚Äúif he would have come near me, the angels would have struck him down and torn him into pieces.‚Äù More specifically, ayahs 15‚Äì19 were about when Abu Jahl saw Muhammed pray again near the Ka‚ÄôBah, and said ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt I tell you not to do this!‚Äù The prophet scolded him and said that he had the right to pray here, because he was a born citizen of Makkah. Abu Jahl said ‚Äúyou dare to scold me! By God, with one call I can fill this valley with supporters!‚Äù This passage was revealed: ‚ÄúIf (Abu Jahl) would have called upon his men, the angel of punishment would have seized him.‚Äù These ayahs are more about the punishment that Abu Jahl (or any transgressor) would encounter, if he would have interrupted Muhammed (or a devotee) during prayer. The translated words ‚Äòbow down‚Äô in verse 19 comes from the word ‚ÄòSujud‚Äô which refers to the position in Muslim prayer where the head, hands, knees, and toes are on the ground.Haleem, M. A.. The Qur'an: a new translation. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008.  Specific Ayah Meanings  Ayahs 1‚Äì3: These ayahs are talking about how Allah created human beings from Alaq (The Clot of blood or The Clinging Thing). After this ayah was revealed, Muhammed responded by saying that he didn't know how to read. After angel Jibraeel squeezed Muhammed's chest a few times, and the 3rd ayah was revealed, Muhammed read even though he did not know how to read or write. Ayahs 4‚Äì5: These ayah stress the importance of an education for a Muslim. As time goes on, things progress and advance, and everything comes from Allah. Allah opens peoples brains to new things, and this ayah stresses the importance of furthering your education. This hadeeth in relation to this ayah was revealed which says: ‚Äúa person who reads is handsome in the eyes of Allah.‚Äù Ayah 6‚Äì8: Even though Allah does so many things for us we still disobey him. Some people say that they do not need Allah. It does not matter because everyone will return to him on the Day of Judgement for reckoning. Ayahs 9‚Äì10: In this ayah ‚Äúthe one who discourages‚Äù references Abu Jahl when he tried to stop Muhammed from making devotions towards Allah, and anyone else for that matter. Ayahs 11‚Äì14: These ayahs question whether the ‚Äúone who discourages‚Äù is being ‚Äúguided‚Äù or even ‚Äúconcerned‚Äù about god. They also emphasize that if someone is praying not to stop them because Allah is always watching. Ayahs 15‚Äì19: These ayahs explain why the person who interrupts someone in prayer is said that they will be dragged from their ‚Äúlying, sinful, forelock.‚Äù This phrase comes from Abu Jahl, who in the battle of Badr was killed by the hands of 2 child orphans of Medinah. His body was thrown into a well and they dragged him by his hair, which is specifically in reference to ayah 15. Hadith The first and foremost exegesis/tafsir of the Qur'an is found in hadith of Muhammad.≈ûatibi, El-muvafakat Although scholars including ibn Taymiyyah claim that Muhammad has commented on the whole of the Qur'an, others including Ghazali cite the limited amount of narratives, thus indicating that he has commented only on a portion of the Qur'an.Muhsin Demirci, Tefsir Usul√º, 120 ·∏§adƒ´th (ÿ≠ÿØŸäÿ´) is literally \\"speech\\" or \\"report\\", that is a recorded saying or tradition of Muhammad validated by isnad; with Sirah Rasul Allah these comprise the sunnah and reveal shariah.

Born and raised a Lutheran, he adopted the name Angelus (Latin for \\"angel\\" or \\"heavenly messenger\\") and the epithet Silesius (\\"Silesian\\") on converting to Catholicism in 1653. While studying in the Netherlands, he began to read the works of medieval mystics and became acquainted with the works of the German mystic Jacob B√∂hme through B√∂hme's friend, Abraham von Franckenberg. Silesius's mystical beliefs caused tension between him and Lutheran authorities and led to his eventual conversion to Catholicism. He took holy orders under the Franciscans and was ordained a priest in 1661. Ten years later, in 1671, he retired to a Jesuit house where he remained for the rest of his life. An enthusiastic convert and priest, Silesius worked to convince German Protestants in Silesia to return to the Roman Catholic Church. He composed 55 tracts and pamphlets condemning Protestantism, several of which were published in two folio volumes entitled Ecclesiologia (i.e., Ecclesiology). He is now remembered chiefly for his religious poetry, and in particular for two poetical works both published in 1657: Heilige Seelenlust (literally, \\"The Soul's Holy Desires\\"), a collection of more than 200 religious hymn texts that have been used by Catholics and Protestants; and Cherubinischer Wandersmann (\\"The Cherubinic Pilgrim\\"), a collection of 1,676 short poems, mostly Alexandrine couplets. His poetry explores themes of mysticism, quietism, and pantheism within an orthodox Catholic context. Life Early life and education While his exact birthdate is unknown, it is believed that Silesius was born in December 1624 in Breslau, the capital of Silesia. The earliest mention of him is the registration of his baptism on Christmas Day, 25 December 1624. At the time, Silesia was a German-speaking province of the Habsburg Empire. Today, it is the southwestern region of Poland. Baptized Johann Scheffler, he was the first of three children. His parents, who married in February 1624, were Lutheran Protestants.Sources (including Flitch, vide infra) state he had a younger sister, Magdalena (b. 1626), and brother, Christian (b. 1630). His sister Magdalena married a doctor named Tobias Br√ºckner. His brother Christian is recorded in history as either \\"feebleminded\\" or mentally ill. His father, Stanislaus Scheffler (‚Äì1637), was of Polish ancestry and was a member of the lower nobility. Stanislaus dedicated his life to the military, was made Lord of Borowice (or Vorwicze) and received a knighthood from King Sigismund III. A few years before his son's birth, he had retired from military service in Krak√≥w. In 1624, he was 62. The child's mother, Maria Hennemann (‚Äì1639), was a 24-year-old daughter of a local physician with ties to the Habsburg Imperial court. Scheffler obtained his early education at the Elisabethsgymnasium (Saint Elizabeth's Gymnasium, or high school) in Breslau. His earliest poems were written and published during these formative years. Scheffler was probably influenced by the recently published works of poet and scholar Martin Opitz and by one of his teachers, poet Christoph K√∂ler. He subsequently studied medicine and science at the University of Strasbourg (or Strassburg) in Alsace for a year in 1643. It was a Lutheran university with a course of study that embraced Renaissance humanism. From 1644 to 1647, he attended Leiden University. At this time, he was introduced to the writings of Jacob B√∂hme (1575‚Äì1624) and became acquainted with one of B√∂hme's friends, Abraham von Franckenberg (1593‚Äì1652), who probably introduced him to ancient Kabbalist writings, alchemy, and hermeticism, and to mystic writers living in Amsterdam.Stockum, T.C. von. Zwischen Jakob B√∂hme und Johannes Scheffler: Abraham von Franckenberg (1593‚Äì1652) und Daniel Czepko von Reigersfeld (1605‚Äì1660). (Amsterdam: Mededelingen der Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie von Wetenschappen, 1967), passim. Franckenberg had been compiling a complete edition of B√∂hme's work at the time Scheffler resided in the Netherlands. The Dutch Republic provided refuge to many religious sects, mystics, and scholars who were persecuted elsewhere in Europe. Scheffler then went to Italy and enrolled in studies at the University of Padua in Padua in September 1647. A year later, he received a doctoral degree in philosophy and medicine and returned to his homeland. Physician On 3 November 1649, Scheffler was appointed to be the court physician to Silvius I Nimrod, Duke of W√ºrttemberg- Oels (1622‚Äì1664) and was given an annual salary of 175 thalers. Although he was \\"recommended to the Duke on account of his good qualities and his experience in medicine,\\" it is likely that Scheffler's friend and mentor, Abraham von Franckenberg, had arranged the appointment given his closeness to the Duke. Franckenberg was the son of a minor noble from the village of Ludwigsdorf near Oels within the duchy. Franckenberg returned to the region the year before. It is also possible that Scheffler's brother-in-law, Tobias Br√ºckner, who was also a physician to the Duke of W√ºrttemberg-Oels, may have recommended him. Scheffler soon was not happy in his position as his personal mysticism and critical views on Lutheran doctrine (especially his disagreements with the Augsburg Confession) caused friction with the Duke and members of the ducal court. The Duke was characterized in history as being \\"a zealous Lutheran and very bigoted.\\" Coincidentally, it was at this time that Scheffler began to have mystical visions, which along with his public pronouncements led local Lutheran clergy to consider him a heretic. After Franckenberg's death in June 1652, Scheffler resigned his position‚Äîhe may have been forced to resign‚Äîand sought refuge under the protection of the Roman Catholic Church.Hatfield, Edwin Francis. The Poets of the Church: A series of biographical sketches of hymn-writers with notes on their hymns. (New York: Anson D.F. Randolph & Co., 1884), p. 530. Priest and poet Protestant authorities attacked and denounced Silesius in print for his Catholic and mystical beliefs, as with this caricature from the Wohlverdientes Kapitel (1664) depicting him as a peddler of potions, rosaries, gambling cards and dice, spectacles, and other immoral wares.Carus, Paul. \\"Angelus Silesius\\" in The Open Court Volume XXII (Chicago: The Open Court Publishing Company, 1908), 290‚Äì297. The Lutheran authorities in the Reformed states of the Empire were not tolerant of Scheffler's increasing mysticism, and he was publicly attacked and denounced as a heretic. At this time, the Habsburg rulers (who were Catholic) were pushing for a Counter Reformation and advocated a re- Catholicisation of Europe. Scheffler sought to convert to Catholicism and was received by the Church of Saint Matthias in Breslau on 12 June 1653. Upon being received, he took the name Angelus, the Latin form of \\"angel\\", derived from the Greek √°ngelos (, \\"messenger\\"); for his epithet, he took Silesius (Latin for \\"Silesian\\"). It is uncertain why he took this name, but he may have added it in honour of his native Silesia or to honor a favourite scholastic, mystic or theosophic author, to distinguish himself from other famous writers of his era: perhaps the Spanish mystic writer Juan de los √Ångeles (author of The Triumph of Love) or Lutheran theologian Johann Angelus in Darmstadt. He no longer used the name Scheffler, but did on occasion use his first name, Johann. From 1653 until his death, he used the names Angelus Silesius and also Johann Angelus Silesius. Shortly after his conversion, on 24 March 1654, Silesius received an appointment as Imperial Court Physician to Ferdinand III, the Holy Roman Emperor. However, this was probably an honorary position to offer some official protection against Lutheran attackers, as Silesius never went to Vienna to serve the Imperial Court. It is very likely that he never practiced medicine after his conversion to Catholicism. In the late 1650s, he sought permission (a nihil obstat or imprimatur) from Catholic authorities in Vienna and Breslau to begin publishing his poetry. He had begun writing poetry at an early age, publishing a few occasional pieces when a schoolboy in 1641 and 1642. He attempted to publish poetry while working for the Duke of W√ºrttemberg-Oels, but was refused permission by the Duke's orthodox Lutheran court clergyman, Christoph Freitag. However, in 1657, after obtaining the approval of the Catholic Church, two collections of his poems were published‚Äîthe works for which he is known‚ÄîHeilige Seelenlust (\\"The Soul's Holy Desire\\") and Der Cherubinische Wandersmann (\\"The Cherubinic Pilgrim\\"). On 27 February 1661, Silesius took holy orders as a Franciscan. Three months later, he was ordained a priest in the Silesian Duchy of Neisse‚Äîan area of successful re-Catholicisation and one of two ecclesiastical states within the region (that is, ruled by a Prince-Bishop). When his friend Sebastian von Rostock (1607‚Äì1671) became Prince-Bishop of Breslau, Silesius was appointed his Rath und Hofmarschall (a counselor and Chamberlain). During this time, he began publishing over fifty tracts attacking Lutheranism and the Protestant Reformation. Thirty-nine of these essays he later compiled into a two-volume folio collection entitled Ecclesiologia (1676). Death After the death of the Prince-Bishop of Breslau in 1671, Silesius retired to the Hospice of the Knights of the Cross with the Red Star (the Matthiasstift), a Jesuit house associated with the church of Saint Matthias at Breslau. He died on 9 July 1677 and was buried there. Some sources claim he died from tuberculosis (\\"consumption\\"), others describe his illness as a \\"wasting sickness.\\" Immediately after news of his death spread, several of his Protestant detractors spread the untrue rumor that Silesius had hanged himself. By his Will, he distributed his fortune, largely inherited from his father's noble estate, to pious and charitable institutions, including orphanages. Importance Des Angelus Silesius Cherubinischer Wandersmann (1905) Interpretation of his work The poetry of Angelus Silesius consists largely of epigrams in the form of alexandrine couplets‚Äîthe style that dominated German poetry and mystical literature during the Baroque era. According to Baker, the epigram was key to conveying mysticism, because \\"the epigram with its tendency towards brevity and pointedness is a suitable genre to cope with the aesthetic problem of the ineffability of the mystical experience.\\"Baker, Christopher (ed.), \\"Johann Scheffler (Angelus Silesius)\\" in Absolutism and the Scientific Revolution, 1600‚Äì1720: A Biographical Dictionary (Wesport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 2002), 343. The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition identifies these epigrams as Reimspr√ºche‚Äîor rhymed distichs‚Äîand describes them as: Silesius's poetry directs the reader to seek a path toward a desired spiritual state, an eternal stillness, by eschewing material or physical needs and the human will. It requires an understanding of God that is informed by the ideas of apophatic theology and of antithesis and paradox.Reinhart, Max (ed.). Early Modern German Literature 1350‚Äì1700. Camden House History of German Literature. Volume 4 (Rochester, New York: Camden House, 2007), 447. Some of Silesius's writings and beliefs that bordered on pantheism or panentheism caused tensions between Silesius and local Protestant authorities. However, in the introduction to Cherubinischer Wandersmann, he explained his poetry (especially its paradoxes) within the framework of Catholic orthodoxy and denied pantheism which would have run afoul of Catholic doctrine. His mysticism is informed by the influences of B√∂hme and Franckenberg as well as of prominent writers Meister Eckhart (1260‚Äì1327), Johannes Tauler (‚Äì1361), Heinrich Suso (‚Äì1366), and Jan van Ruysbroeck (1293/4‚Äì1381). Critic and literary theorist Georg Ellinger surmised in his study of Silesius that his poetry was influenced by loneliness (especially due to the death of his parents and becoming an orphan early in life), ungoverned impulsivity, and lack of personal fulfillment, rendering much of his poetry confessional and exhibiting internal psychological conflict.Ellinger, Georg. Angelus Silesius (Breslau: W.G. Korn, 1927). Use in hymns Several of the poems of Silesius have been used or adapted as hymns used in Protestant and Catholic services. In many early Lutheran and Protestant hymnals, these lyrics were attributed to \\"anonymous\\", rather than admit they were penned by the Catholic Silesius, known for his criticism and advocacy against Protestantism. In many instances, the verse of Silesius is attributed in print to \\"anonymous\\" or to \\"I.A.\\" While I.A. were the Latin initials for Iohannis Angelus they were often misinterpreted as Incerti auctoris, meaning \\"unknown author\\". Likewise, several truly anonymous works were later misattributed to Silesius, thanks to the same ambiguous initials. Verses by Silesius appear in the lyrics of hymns published in N√ºrnberg Gesang-Buch (1676), Freylinghausen's Gesang-Buch (1704), Porst's Gesang-Buch (1713); and Burg's Gesang-Buch (1746). Seventy-nine hymns using his verses were included in Nicolaus Zinzendorf's Christ-Catholisches Singe und Bet-B√ºchlein (1727). During the 18th Century, they were frequently in use in the Lutheran, Catholic, and Moravian Churches. Many of these hymns are still popular in Christian churches today. Silesius in modern culture Monument in Wroc≈Çaw In 1934, Hugo Distler based 14 motets of his Totentanz on texts from The Cherubinic Pilgrim. In a series of lectures entitled Siete Noches (\\"Seven Nights\\") (1980), Argentine writer and poet Jorge Luis Borges (1899‚Äì1986) remarks that the essence of poetry can be encapsulated in a single line from Silesius. Borges wrote: > I will end with a great line by the poet who, in the seventeenth century, > took the strangely real and poetic name of Angelus Silesius. It is the > summary of all I have said tonight ‚Äî except that I have said it by means of > reasoning and simulated reasoning. I will say it first in Spanish and then > in German: : La rosa es sin porqu√©; florece porque florece. : Die Rose ist > ohne warum; sie bl√ºhet weil sie bl√ºhet.Borges, Jorge Luis. Seite Noches. > (Mexico City: Fondo de Cultura Econ√≥mica, 1980), 120‚Äì121; translated by > Weinberger, Eliot. Seven Nights. (New York: New Directions, 1984), 93‚Äì94. > The lectures were originally given in 1977. The line he quoted, Die Rose ist ohne warum; sie bl√ºhet, weil sie bl√ºhet... from Silesius's The Cherubinic Pilgrim (1657), can be translated as: \\"The Rose is without a 'wherefor'‚Äîshe blooms because she blooms.\\" The influence of mysticism is seen in the work of Borges, especially in his poetry, which frequently references Silesius and his work.See, for instance, the Borges poem Al idioma alem√°n (\\"To the German language\\") in El oro de los tigres (PDF) (1972). This same line was often referenced in the work of Martin Heidegger (1889‚Äì1976) who (building on the work of Leibniz and Hegel) explored mysticism in many of his works, in which he defines a theory of truth as phenomenal and defying any rational explanation. Heidegger was commenting on the rational philosophy of German philosopher and mathematician Leibniz (1646‚Äì1716)‚Äîa contemporary of Silesius‚Äîwho called the mystic's poetry \\"beautiful\\", but \\"extraordinarily daring, full of difficult metaphors and inclined almost to godlessness\\"Dutens, Ludovici (ed.) Gothofredi Guillelmi Leibnitii Opera Omnia (6 volumes) (Geneva: s.n., 1768; reprinted Hildesheim: Georg Olms, 1989), VI:56.Heidegger, Martin. Der Satz vom Grund. (Pfullingen: Verlag Gunther Neske, 1957), 68‚Äì69; translated by Lilly, Reginald. The Principle of Reason. (Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 1991), 36 ff. despite Silesius's mysticism being contrary to Leibniz's principium reddendae rationis sufficientis, the Principle of sufficient reason. In the 1991 American film Cape Fear directed by Martin Scorsese, Max Cady (played by Robert De Niro) quotes a verse of Silesius.Strick, Wesley and Webb, James R. Screenplay for \\"Cape Fear\\" (1991 film) adapted from the novel The Executioners by John D. MacDonald. The verse is: However, the context of this line in the film does not match the context intended by Silesius. The character of Cady uses it to emphasize dramatically to his intended victims the power of his individual will and his god-like ability to exact a violent vengeance. The context intended by Silesius was of man's realization through his spiritual potential for perfection that he was of the same substance with God in the sense of the mystical divine union or theosis‚Äîthat experience of direct communion of love between the believer and God as equals.

These are called grades. Although there are music examinations available to school and university students alongside other regular qualifications and assessments, there are also a number of independent bodies who solely provide assessment in musical ability which are open to all. Overview Trinity College London was the first organization to offer examinations in music to external students in 1877. As of 2018, Trinity College London conducts around 850,000 assessmentshttps://www.trinitycollege.com/site/?id=6 worldwide per year, as does the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music. Other examination boards based in the UK include the London College of Music, Victoria College of Music and Drama, the National College of Music and Rockschool (RSL Awards). Many students who enter these exams have taken a course of music lessons with a private tutor, although some are self-taught. Often this is a way for children to receive music training over and above what is provided at their usual place of learning, although private lessons are also popular with adults who turn to music later in life. Music exams are set in both theory and practical aspects. The theory examinations are taken by pupils of all instruments and typically cover areas such as musical notation, construction of scales and composition. The practical exams concentrate on the particular instrument favored by the pupil, for example piano, guitar or flute. Rockschool exams include electric guitar, acoustic guitar, bass, drums, ukulele and keyboardshttps://www.rslawards.com/rockschool/. They cover elements such as playing set pieces, technical work including scales, sight reading, aural, musical knowledge and improvisation. In the United Kingdom the music exams are graded from 1 to 8, with Grade 1 being the entry level, and Grade 8 being the standard required for entry to higher study in a music college. Additionally, Trinity College London offers an Initial level qualification at Entry Level 3 of the UK Qualifications and Credit Framework, and ABRSM offer a Prep Test qualification as a useful preparation before the Grade 1 exam. LCM offers one Pre-preparatory and two Step exams at this level and VCM offers four Introductory grades aimed at those in the first 18 months of learning. Other reputable music examination boards offering examinations on musical instruments and music theory include: * Australian Music Examinations Board * The Royal Conservatory of Music (Canada) * University of South Africa - Directorate Music * ANZCA Music Examinations (Australia, New Zealand and Asia) * New Zealand Music Examinations Board * Royal Irish Academy of Music Different music examination boards may have different grade levels for instruments and music theory examination. Depending on how they are recognised by regulatory bodies such as Ofqual, examination results or credits may be transferable from one exam board to the other.

In 1685‚Äì1688 he was on a diplomatic mission to Siam. He became governor of Bangkok and a general in the Siamese army, and left Siam shortly before King Narai fell ill and was deposed by a coup d'√©tat. Biography Claude de Forbin was born in the village Gardanne in the Provence, as a member of a family established in Marseilles in the 14th century. Later divided into several branches, Claude de Forbin was the most famous of the branch Farbin Gardanne. High-spirited and ungovernable in his boyhood, he ran away from his home, and through the influence of an uncle entered the navy, serving his first campaign in 1675. For a short time he quit the navy and entered the musketeers. There, he killed the chevalier de Gourdon in a duel, and was sentenced to death by the Parliament of Aix; he managed to obtain a grace and joined the Navy under his brother's identity. He served under the Count d'Estr√©es during the American campaign, and under Duquesne that of Algiers in 1683, on all occasions distinguishing himself by his impetuous courage. Grand Admiral of Siam Claude de Forbin-Gardanne The most remarkable episode of his life was his mission to Siam. During the administration of the Greek adventurer Phaulcon in that country, the project was formed of introducing the Christian religion and European civilisation, and the king sent an embassy to Louis XIV. In response a French embassy was sent out, Forbin accompanying the Chevalier de Chaumont with the rank of major aboard the Oiseau. When Chaumont returned to France, Forbin was induced to remain in the service of the Siamese king, and accepted, though with much reluctance, the posts of grand admiral, general of all the king's armies and governor of Bangkok. During his tenure he crushed the Makassar Revolt at Bangkok, although almost at the cost of his own life. His position, however, was soon made untenable by the jealousy and intrigues of the minister Phaulcon; and at the end of two years he left Siam, reaching France in 1688. He was replaced as Governor of Bangkok by the Chevalier de Beauregard. War with England Claude de Forbin was afterwards fully engaged in active service, first with Jean Bart in the war with England, when they escorted a convoy; attacked by superior forces, Forbin, aboard the Jeux, and Jean Bart, aboard the Railleuse, sacrificed themselves in a delaying action to allow the convoy the escape. They were both captured and taken to Plymouth. They succeeded in making their escape after 11 days, crossed the Channel on a small craft, and were soon serving their country again. Made a capitaine de vaisseau in June 1689, he commanded the Neptune in the Battle of Beachy Head (1690). After a campaign in the North Sea in 1691, he commanded the Perle in Barfleur, where he was wounded. He greatly distinguished himself at the battle of Lagos in 1693. Commanding the Marquis in 1695, he campaigned in the Mediterranean and Constantinople. In 1697, he served in Catalonia in the siege of Barcelona. During the War of the Spanish Succession, he led a three-ship of the line division in the Adriatic, where he blockaded Venice, bombed Trieste and ramsonned Fiume. In 1703 and 1704, he hunted down the privateers from Vlissingen. In June 1706, he attacked an English convoy, capturing seven ships; on 12 July, he seized two Dutch ships, and on 28 October, engaging a strongly escorted Dutch convoy, he captured three ships and sank another one. In 1707, he was made a Chef d'Escadre (Rear-Admiral). On 12 May he captured a British convoy of 18 ships en route for Portugal. In the summer he led the Mars and a division into the White Sea, returning to Brest on 23 September with 34 captured ships. Battle at The Lizard (1707), by Jean Antoine Th√©odore de Gudin. On 21 October in the Battle at the Lizard, he helped Duguay-Trouin in destroying almost entirely an English convoy set for Portugal: of 80 ships, 60 merchantman and four ships of the line were captured, and 1 other was sunk. In 1708, he led Prince James Francis Edward Stuart to Scotland, in an attempt to reconquer the Throne of England; ill-prepared, the attempt failed, and Forbin ceased to navigate. He quit the Navy in January 1715, and died on 4 March 1733 in Saint-Marcel Castle near Marseille. His Memories were published in 1730, written by his secretary. Sometimes hated for his harsh and strong personality, Forbin entered the legend as one of the most brilliant sailors of the time.

Nice Memorial/Senator Thomas \\"Mac\\" Middleton Bridge, also known as the Potomac River Bridge, is a , two-lane continuous truss bridge that spans the Potomac River between Newburg in Charles County, Maryland and Dahlgren in King George County, Virginia, United States. The bridge is narrow (one lane in each direction with no shoulders), steep (up to 3.75 percent grade), and has a reduced speed limit ( on the main span, even slower through the southbound toll gates and plaza). By contrast, the approach roads on both sides of the bridge feature four lanes (2 in each direction), full shoulders, and speed limits. This combination forces vehicles to slow and merge as they cross the bridge, which often results in backups. This two lane bridge carries U.S. Route 301, which is a spur of U.S. Route 1 and a popular north-south alternative for bypassing the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area and its frequently congested roads such as Interstate 95, Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway), and the Woodrow Wilson Bridge to the north along the Potomac River. The traffic growth/volume in Southern Maryland has led to congestion and delays, especially on holidays and weekends. In 2014, the bridge handled approximately 6.4 million vehicles, with a daily average of approximately 17,500. It is one of eight toll facilities operated by the Maryland Transportation Authority, and is one of two toll bridges over the Potomac River. The other, the privately owned Oldtown Low Water Toll Bridge, connects Maryland and West Virginia, far upstream. In March 2020, all- electronic tolling was implemented as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with tolls payable through E-ZPass or Video Tolling, which uses automatic license plate recognition. All-electronic tolling was made permanent in August 2020. History Wide view of the bridge A photograph of the Harry W. Nice Bridge taken from Virginia. The border with Maryland is at the foreground shoreline. President Franklin D. Roosevelt presided over the ground-breaking ceremony for the bridge in 1938. Known as the Potomac River Bridge when opened in December 1940, the bridge was renamed in 1967 for Harry W. Nice (1877‚Äì1941) who served as governor of Maryland from 1935 to 1939. The bridge was the first south of Washington, D.C. to provide a highway link between Maryland and Virginia. In October 2018, the name of retiring state Senator Thomas M. Middleton was added to the bridge, making it officially the Governor Harry W. Nice Memorial/Senator Thomas \\"Mac\\" Middleton Bridge. Future In June 2006, the Maryland Transportation Authority initiated the Governor Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge Improvement Project. This project is exploring upgrade/replacement of the main span, which is a bottleneck as the bridge is only two lanes, whereas U.S. Route 301 is a four lane divided highway in both Maryland and Virginia. As of June 2007, it was in the planning stage. In December 2007, The Washington Post reported that six alternatives had been identified. In December 2012, it was reported that the MdTA completed a study of the Nice Bridge and received approval from the federal government to replace the current structure with a span with four lanes and a bike/pedestrian path, to be located just north of the existing bridge, which will be removed upon completion of the replacement crossing. The MdTA estimated the cost of a replacement span at about $850 million, but funding is not currently identified. The project is being coordinated with the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), and is proceeding in conjunction with the Maryland State Highway Administration's U.S. Route 301 South Corridor Transportation Study and the U.S. Route 301 Waldorf Area Transportation Improvements Project. On November 21, 2013, Governor Martin O‚ÄôMalley announced that the MD Transportation Authority (MDTA) Board has approved an additional $50 million in its final six-year capital program (FY 2014 ‚Äì FY 2019) to fund initial design and right-of-way acquisition for the project to replace the Governor Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge (US 301), which connects Charles County, Maryland and King George County, Virginia, across the Potomac River. The planning phase of the project was completed in fall 2012. The selected alternative consists of a new four-lane bridge built parallel to, and north of, the existing bridge, which would be removed upon completion of the new bridge. Opposition to a new bridge from Governor Larry Hogan had prevented construction from being scheduled. However, on November 21, 2016, the Maryland Transportation Authority Board voted unanimously to build a new, 4-lane bridge just north of the current structure. Construction is scheduled to start in 2020 with completion set for 2023. The approved bridge design has several design alterations which shave more than $200 million from the originally projected price of around $1 billion, allowing Governor Hogan to shift his support in favor of the bridge.

Mickelsen Safeguard Complex Missile Site Radar, one of the prominent features of the only completed complex under the Safeguard Program; radar and underground control building on the right, underground power plant on the left. The Safeguard Program was a U.S. Army anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system designed to protect the U.S. Air Force's Minuteman ICBM silos from attack, thus preserving the US's nuclear deterrent fleet. It was intended primarily to protect against the very small Chinese ICBM fleet, limited Soviet attacks and various other limited-launch scenarios. A full-scale attack by the Soviets would easily overwhelm it. It was designed to allow gradual upgrades to provide similar lightweight coverage over the entire United States over time. Safeguard was the ultimate development of an ever-changing series of designs produced by Bell Labs that started in the 1950s with the LIM-49 Nike Zeus. By 1960 it was clear that Zeus offered almost no protection against a sophisticated attack using decoys. A new design emerged, Nike-X, with the ability to defend against attacks with hundreds of warheads and thousands of decoys, but the cost of the system was enormous. Looking for alternatives, the Sentinel program offered a lightweight cover that would protect against limited attacks. Sentinel began construction in 1968 but ran into a firestorm of protest over its bases being placed in suburban areas. In March 1969, incoming President Richard M. Nixon announced that Sentinel would be cancelled and redirected to protect the missile farms, and that its bases would be placed well away from any civilian areas. The debate about ABM protection of US ICBMs had been going on for over a decade when Safeguard was announced, and the arguments against such a system were well known both in the military and civilian circles. In military circles, the most basic argument against Safeguard was that adding an ABM requires the Soviets to build another ICBM to counter it, but the same is true if the US builds another ICBM instead. The Air Force was far more interested in building more of their own ICBMs than Army ABMs, and lobbied against the Army continually. In the public sphere, opinion by the late 1960s was anti-military in general, and in an era of ongoing Strategic Arms Limitation Talks the entire concept was derided as sabre rattling. Safeguard had been developed to calm opposition but found itself just as heavily opposed. Nixon pressed ahead in spite of objections and complaints about limited performance, and the reasons for his strong support remains a subject of debate among historians and political commentators. Through the Safeguard era, talks between the US and Soviet Union originally started by President Lyndon B. Johnson were continuing. The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 limited the US and Soviet Union to two ABM sites each. Safeguard was scaled back to sites in North Dakota and Montana, abandoning initial work at a site in Missouri, and cancelling all other planned bases. Construction on the two remaining bases continued until 1974, when an additional agreement limited both countries to a single ABM site. The Montana site was abandoned with the main radar partially completed. The remaining base in North Dakota, the Stanley R. Mickelsen Safeguard Complex, became active on 1 April 1975 and fully operational on 1 October 1975. By that time the House Appropriations Committee had already voted to deactivate it. The base was shut down on 10 February 1976. History Nike Zeus An anti-ICBM defensive ABM system was first considered by the US Army in 1955 under the name Nike II. This was essentially an upgraded version of their Nike B surface-to-air missile (SAM) along with dramatically improved radars and computers able to detect the incoming reentry vehicles (RVs) and develop tracking information while still leaving enough time for the interceptor missile to climb to its altitude. Zeus had limited traffic handling capabilities, designed to deal with a small number of attacking missiles arriving over a period of as long as an hour. It was calculated that an attack of only four missiles arriving within one minute would allow one of the warheads to pass by while the system was busy attacking others, making it relatively easy to attack the Zeus base. However, in an era when ICBMs cost about the same as a strategic bomber, such an attack would cost an enormous amount. Through the late 1950s a new generation of much lighter thermonuclear bombs cut warhead weight from in the case of the original Soviet R-7 Semyorka ICBM to perhaps , and further reductions were known to be possible - the US's W47 of the UGM-27 Polaris weighed only . This meant that much smaller rockets could carry these new warheads to the same range, greatly reducing the cost of the missile, making them far cheaper than bombers or any other delivery system. When Nikita Khrushchev angrily boasted that the Soviet Union was producing new missiles \\"like sausages\\", the US responded by building more ICBMs of their own, rather than attempting to defend against them with Zeus. Adding to the problems, as the warhead weight dropped, existing missiles had leftover throw weight that could be used for various radar decoys, which Zeus proved unable to distinguish from the actual RV. The Army calculated that as many as twenty Zeus' would have to be fired to ensure a single incoming missile was destroyed. Nike-X Faced with these problems, both the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations turned to the newly created ARPA to suggest solutions. ARPA noted that because the decoys were lighter than the actual warhead, they would slow down more rapidly as they reentered the lower atmosphere. They proposed a system using a short range missile that could wait until the warhead was below altitude, at which point the decoys would have been decluttered. Desiring to destroy the missile before it was below altitude, combined with the per second terminal speed of the RV meant there were only 2 to 3 seconds to develop a track and shoot the interceptor. This would demand extremely fast missiles, high-performance radars and advanced computers. In 1963, Robert McNamara cancelled the upcoming deployment of Zeus and announced that money would instead be provided for research into this new system, now known as Nike-X. Construction on the new phased array radar and its associated computer systems began at the MAR-I site in White Sands Missile Range. MAR could track hundreds of warheads and the interceptor missiles sent to attack them, meaning the Soviets would have to launch hundreds of missiles if they wanted to overwhelm it. And now that decoys were no longer an issue, the cost- exchange ratio fell back to reasonable levels. The Nike-X developed the same sort of trouble as the Zeus before it. In this case it was ironically due to the Soviet's own ABM system which was very similar to Zeus. To ensure they could defeat it, the US Air Force began equipping their own ICBMs with decoys, which would defeat the Soviet's Zeus-like system. However, concerned that the Soviets would upgrade their system to Nike-X like performance, they instead began replacing their warheads with lighter ones, and carrying three of them. This meant that every US missile would require three (or six accounting for redundancy) interceptors. When the same calculations were run for Nike-X, it was calculated that they would have to deploy 7,000 Sprint missiles, and the cost-exchange ratio was 20-to-1 in favor of the Soviets. When presented with these numbers, McNamara concluded that deploying Nike-X would prompt to Soviets to build more ICBMs, increasing the risk of an accidental war. From this point on, he opposed building a \\"heavy\\" ABM system like Nike-X. Sentinel In spite of all of these problems, which McNamara repeatedly made public in a series of talks, the Johnson administration was under intense pressure to deploy an ABM system. In 1966 Congress voted to provide deployment funding for Nike-X, although McNamara refused to use it. As the 1967 elections approached, it became clear that this was going to be a major election issue. McNamara proposed arms limitations talks with the Soviets to put upper limits on the numbers of ABMs and warheads, but the Glassboro Summit Conference ultimately came to nothing. By late 1967 it was clear the Soviets were not seriously considering limitations, and were continuing deployment of their own ABM system. In September, the Chinese tested their first H-bomb. McNamara and Johnson seized on this as a solution to the problem; a defense against the tiny Chinese fleet was both technically possible and relatively low-cost. Deploying this system would mute the ongoing debate, even over the long term if the option was open to expand the system to Nike-X coverage levels in the future. On 18 September 1967, McNamara announced the Sentinel program, with 17 bases covering all of the US, along with a total of just under 700 missiles, about the number in a baseline Nike-X. Nixon, having campaigned that the Democrats were deliberately dragging their feet on the ABM, inherited the system with his election win. He also inherited a massive NIMBY backlash that blew up in late 1968 when the Army chose to deploy the missiles in suburban locations to allow future expansion to be easier. City-dwellers could tolerate the idea of an armed rocket attack against bombers going on over their heads. They were less comfortable with the concept of nuclear anti-missiles detonating against incoming missiles at low altitudes. The issue came to a head at a meeting outside Boston, when an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 people showed up to express their displeasure in spite of a raging blizzard. Congressmen were flooded by letters from constituents demanding the sites be moved, and Congress was soon threatening to freeze all additional funds for the system. Nixon announced construction would be delayed while the system underwent a review. Safeguard The review was completed on 14 March 1969 and announced in a lengthy speech made by Nixon and various DoD advisers. The entire concept was reviewed and all possibilities considered fresh. Among these, the idea of a heavyweight Nike-X-like system was considered, but Defense Secretary Melvin Laird apparently came to the same conclusion as McNamara before him, stating that the protection the system offered simply didn't justify the cost; However, they disagreed with the concept of a light city defense as well. There was no reason to deploy a system that only worked under contrived circumstances, especially as accepting them as possibilities meant that the enemy was ignoring your deterrent. If that was the case, why have missiles at all? The real issue becomes ensuring they cannot ignore your deterrent, and it was this concept that Nixon chose. Instead of deploying the ABM system to protect cities, the new deployment would protect the missile bases themselves, ensuring that no limited attack could be contemplated. This did not have to be perfect, or even close to it; Operation An aerial image of the Stanley R. Mickelsen Safeguard Complex Safeguard was a two-layer defense system. The long-range Spartan missile would attempt interception outside the Earth's atmosphere. The missile's long range allowed protection of a large geographic area. If the Spartan failed to intercept the incoming offensive missile, the high performance and high speed but short ranged Sprint missile would attempt an interception within the atmosphere. Both missiles used nuclear warheads, and they relied on destroying or damaging the incoming warhead with radiation rather than heat or blast. The Spartan carried a weapon with a yield; the Sprint in the range.http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Weapons/Allbombs.html The envisioned sequence was as follows: # Enemy launch detected by Defense Support Program satellites, sensing the hot infrared exhaust of the ICBM booster. # While in the mid-course phase, the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System radars in the far north would detect the incoming warheads. # As the warheads approached (but while still in outer space) the Safeguard long-range Perimeter Acquisition Radar (PAR) would detect them, providing filtered information to the shorter-range and more precise Missile Site Radar (MSR). # While the incoming warhead came within range of the MSR, the associated computer systems would calculate intercept trajectories and launch times. Original deployment plan Plans were made in the late 1960s to deploy Safeguard systems in three locations, Whiteman AFB, Missouri, Malmstrom AFB, Montana, and Grand Forks AFB, North Dakota, to protect important strategic weapons assets. However the Whiteman AFB location was canceled despite the fact that specific missile and radar site locations had already been selected. Construction was actually commenced at the North Dakota and Montana sites, but only the North Dakota site was completed. Remnants of the incomplete PAR system still remain in rural Montana. Nb: Includes photos and cites James H. Kitchens, \\"A History of the Huntsville Division (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers)\\", q.v. Components The Safeguard system consisted of several primary components, the Perimeter Acquisition Radar, the Missile Site Radar, the Spartan missile launchers, co- located Sprint missile launchers, and Remote Sprint missile launchers. Perimeter Acquisition Radar (PAR) The PAR, known now as PARCS, is still operational The PAR was a large passive electronically scanned array radar that was intended to detect incoming ballistic missile warheads as they crossed over the North Pole region. Potential targets detected by the PAR would be sent to the Missile Site Radar (MSR) and to North American Aerospace Defense Command. Two radar sites were intended to be constructed on the northern border of the United States, one in Montana and one in North Dakota. Construction was begun at both locations, but because of the ratification of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, only the site at North Dakota was completed. That site, near Cavalier, North Dakota, is now operated by the United States Air Force as Cavalier Air Force Station. Missile Site Radar (MSR) The Missile Site Radar was the control of the Safeguard system. It housed the computers and a phased array radar necessary to track and hit back at incoming ICBM warheads. The radar building itself is a pyramid structure several stories tall. Construction was begun in both Montana and North Dakota, but only the North Dakota site remains standing. The MSR complex included 30 Spartan missile launchers and 16 Sprint missile launchers. Remote Sprint Launchers (RSL) Remote Sprint Launchers were established around the MSR main complex in order to place missile launchers closer to their intended targets, and thus reduce the flight range to the targets. Four sites were completed, and they still remain there, around the MSR complex in Nekoma, North Dakota. Incomplete sites Remnants of the Montana PAR site are located east of Conrad, Montana, at . The remnants of the Montana Missile Site Radar were dismantled and buried.

It is the largest hummingbird found outside of South America and the largest sabrewing. The adult male is deep violet, with a dark green back and wing coverts. The shafts of the male's outer primary flight feathers are thickened and flattened to give the distinctive feature which gives the sabrewings their English and scientific names. The three outer pairs of feathers of the otherwise black tail are white; this gives rise to the scientific species name, hemileucurus translating as \\"half-white tail\\", but several other sabrewings share the tail pattern, not least the white-tailed sabrewing of Venezuela and Tobago. The female is dark green above and grey below apart from a violet throat; the tail pattern is the same as the male's. Young violet sabrewings have buff edges to the feathers and lack any violet, although juvenile males may be dusky green-blue below. The food of this species is nectar, taken mainly from undergrowth flowers with Heliconias and bananas as favourites. The males are less aggressive and territorial at flowers than their size would suggest. The call of the violet sabrewing is a sharp twitter, and the song of the male, given at leks of up to ten males, is a high-pitched piercing cheep tsew cheep tik-tik tsew.

Life Born in the Andalusian city of M√°laga in 1899, Prados was offered a place at Madrid's famous Residencia de estudiantes in 1914 and moved into its university section in 1918. Here he met Lorca, Dal√≠, Bu√±uel and many other young people who were to become celebrated and influential figures in Spanish art and literature. In 1921 a long-running lung complaint forced him to retire to a sanatorium in Davosplatz, Switzerland, where he spent most of the year. In this enforced seclusion from wider society he read widely in European literature and settled upon becoming a writer himself. Emerging from the sanatorium in 1922, he resumed his academic training: taking courses at the universities of Freiburg and Berlin; visiting museums and art galleries across Germany; immersing himself in the artistic culture of Paris and meeting, amongst others, Pablo Picasso. In the summer of 1924 he returned to M√°laga, where he continued writing. Together with Manuel Altolaguirre he founded the magazine Litoral, one of the most influential literary and artistic publications of 1920s Spain. In 1925 he became an Editor for the Sur printing-house, again working closely with Altolaguirre. Sur was responsible for publishing most of the work of the Generation of '27, and the quality of their editing brought Prados and Altolaguirre international prestige. At the same time as he was working in literature and pursuing his own creative talents, Prados took an increasing interest in social affairs and politics, particularly the marginalisation of the poorest sectors of society. The climate of violence in M√°laga after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 led him to return to Madrid, where he joined the Alianza de Intelectuales Antifascistas and began contributing enthusiastically to the intellectual side of the Republican cause. As well as publishing his own works (his compilation of war poetry, Destino fiel, won the National Literature Prize in 1938), he edited various books including Homenaje al poeta Federico Garc√≠a Lorca and Romancero general de la guerra de Espa√±a. He moved to Barcelona in 1938 and took charge, again with Altolaguirre, of the publications of the Republican Ministry of Public Instruction. However, as a prominent Republican he was soon forced to flee Spain altogether as the Nationalists won victory in the Civil War. He escaped to Paris and then, early in July 1939, in the company of a variety of other intellectual Republican figures, to Mexico, where he lived until his death in 1962. Work Early work, 1925 - 1928: Prados's poetry highlights in particular the relationship between the natural world and the otherness of being, mixing avant-garde and surrealist elements with his own Arabic/Andalusian roots. *Tiempo *Veinte poemas en verso *Seis estampas paraun rompecabezas *Canciones del farero *Vuelta *El misterio del agua Political poetry, 1932 - 1938: Prados devotes himself to outspokenly social and political poetry, developing these themes using surrealist language. *La voz cautiva *Andando, andando por el mundo *La tierra que no alienta *Seis estancias *Llanto en la sangre *El llanto subterr√°neo *Tres cantos *Homenaje al poeta Federico Garc√≠a Lorca contra su muerte *Romances *Romancero general de la guerra de Espa√±a *Cancionero menor para los combatientes *Destino fiel (a collection of all his war poetry, won the Premio Nacional de Literatura in 1938) Poetry from exile, 1939 - 1962: Prados's later poetry carries a profound sense of rootlessness and solitude. Thematically his work becomes much denser and more philosophical, addressing the complexity of concepts such as new life, solidarity and love. *M√≠nima muerte *Jard√≠n cerrado *Memoria del olvido *Penumbras *R√≠o natural *Circuncisi√≥n del sue√±o *Signos del ser Category:1899 births Category:1962 deaths Category:People from M√°laga Category:Generation of '27 Category:Spanish male poets Category:Andalusian writers Category:Spanish people of the Spanish Civil War (Republican faction) Category:Exiles of the Spanish Civil War in Mexico Category:20th-century Spanish poets Category:20th-century Spanish male writers Category:Spanish editors Category:LGBT history in Spain ","title":"Emilio Prados"},{"id":"1103083","text":"Baby Ruth candy bars at General Store in Portsmouth, North Carolina.

Square capitals were used to write inscriptions, and less often to supplement everyday handwriting. When written in documents this style is known as Latin book hand. For everyday writing the Romans used a current cursive hand known as Latin cursive. Notable examples of square capitals used for inscriptions are found on the Roman Pantheon, Trajan's Column, and the Arch of Titus, all in Rome. Square capitals are characterized by sharp, straight lines, supple curves, thick and thin strokes, angled stressing and incised serifs. These Roman capitals are also called majuscules, as a counterpart to minuscule letters such as Merovingian and Carolingian. Before the 4th century, square capitals were used to write de luxe copies of the works of authors categorized as \\"pagan\\" by Christians, especially those of Virgil; the only three surviving manuscripts using this letter, among them the Vergilius Augusteus, contain works by Virgil. After the 5th century the square capitals fell out of use, except as a display lettering for titles and chapter headings in conjunction with various script hands for body text: for example, uncials. Square capitals were greatly respected by artisans of the Renaissance such as Geoffroy Tory and Felice Feliciano. A few centuries later, they were also a major inspiration for artisans of the Arts and Crafts movement such as Edward Johnston and Eric Gill, and so many signs and engravings created with an intentionally artistic design in the twentieth century are based on them. Edward Catich is noted for the fullest development of the thesis that the inscribed Roman square capitals owed their form, including the serifs, wholly to the use of the flat brush, rather than to the exigencies of the chisel or other stone cutting tools. Although not universally accepted, the brushed- origin thesis had been proposed in the nineteenth century. Catich made a complete study and proposed a convincing ductus by which the forms were created, using a flat brush and then chisel. He promulgated his views in two works, Letters Redrawn from the Trajan Inscription in Rome and The Origin of the Serif: Brush Writing and Roman Letters. During the early era of the movable type printing press, Roman square capitals became the primary inspiration for the capital letters in early serif typefaces; Roman type, especially that developed by those associated with Aldus Manutius, came to produce a number of typefaces still used to the present day.Bringhurst, Robert (2008), The Elements of Typographic Style (version 3.2).

In 2003, the law school moved into a new facility in downtown Baltimore near the Inner Harbor and Oriole Park at Camden Yards. In 2011, the law school received a donation from the W.P. Carey Foundation, the largest gift in the school's history. In response, the law school changed its name to the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law. The law school was ranked 36th by the U.S. News & World Report in 2008 and 47th . The 2021 edition also gave Maryland Law top standing in part-time programs (#5), health care law (#7), environmental law (#10), dispute resolution (#13), and clinical training (#6). Maryland Law is fully accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA). It is a member of the Association of American Law Schools and has a chapter of the Order of the Coif honor society. History Founded in 1816 as the Maryland Law Institute, with regular instruction beginning in 1824, it is the second-oldest law school in the United States, behind only William & Mary Law School. After the law school denied admission to black applicant Donald Gaines Murray on account of his race, in 1936 the Maryland Court of Appeals ruled that the law school must admit him.\\"JBHE Chronology of Major Landmarks in the Progress of African Americans in Higher Education\\", JBHE. Student body right There are approximately 705 students enrolled at Maryland Law in the Juris Doctor (J.D.), Master of Laws (LL.M.), and Master of Science in Law (M.S.L.) programs combined. The racial makeup of students in the J.D. program is approximately , with about 35% identifying as a minority race (and the remainder are unknown or did not specify). Around 72% of J.D. students are under 25 years old. There are more than 40 student organizations, four specialized legal centers, and five law journals. Costs and employment Employment outcomes According to Maryland Law's official data reported to the American Bar Association, 91.1% of 2016 graduates were employed nine months after graduation. For those who chose private practice, the median starting salary was $132,500. According to Maryland Law's Law School Transparency (LST) report, nine months after graduation, 57.6% of had obtained full-time, long- term legal jobs and 19.6% were underemployed, meaning they were either unemployed, pursuing additional degrees, or working in nonprofessional, short- term, or part-time jobs. Costs For the 2019-2020 academic year, tuition and fees for full-time J.D. students are $32,808 for Maryland residents and $48,426 for out-of-state students. For part-time J.D. students, tuition and fees are $21,538 for Maryland residents and $31,704 for out-of-state students. The estimated total cost of attendance for J.D. students, which includes tuition and fees, living expenses, transportation expenses, book expenses, and health insurance, is $61,745 for full-time students who are Maryland residents, $79,277 for full-time out-of-state students, $45,123 for part-time students who are Maryland residents, and $56,972 for part-time out-of-state students. During the 2017-18 academic year, 80% of students received a scholarship or grant from Maryland Law, including 83% of full-time students and 68% of part-time students. Academics Curriculum  Core  The core curriculum at Maryland Law for J.D. students includes courses in civil procedure, constitutional law, torts, property, contracts, and criminal law, as well as a two-semester sequence of courses focusing on legal skills of analysis, research, writing, and oral argument. After completing these initial courses, students are required to complete additional coursework in constitutional law, ethics, and legal research, and satisfy experiential and writing requirements. This core curriculum forms the basis for more specialized study through more than 150 elective courses, seminars, independent studies, simulations, clinics, and externships. The LL.M. degree program is designed for students who have earned a prior law degree, either a J.D. degree from a law school in the United States or a law degree from a school in another country. Students must complete coursework in a specialty field and may choose to write a thesis. LL.M. students who did not earn a prior law degree in an American law school must take a course on introductory American law, but otherwise, no specific courses are required for LL.M. students. Specialty programs Maryland Law is home to several specialty programs that enable students to explore areas of interest through experiential learning and a specialized curriculum. The main specialty areas include: * Alternative Dispute Resolution * Business Law * Clinical Law * Cybersecurity and Crisis Management * Environmental Law * Health Care Law * Intellectual Property Law * International and Comparative Law * Public Health Law * Women, Leadership, and Equality Students can focus in other areas as well, such as criminal law, dispute resolution, family law/child advocacy, general practice, jurisprudence/legal history, labor/employment law, administrative law, property/real estate/decedent's estates law, public interest law/community development, and tax law. Clinical law program Through the Cardin Requirement, named after Maryland Law alumnus U.S. Senator Benjamin Cardin, each full-time day student in the J.D. program must gain hands-on legal experience by representing actual clients who would otherwise lack access to justice. Most students fulfill the Cardin Requirement through the Clinical Law Program, which provides free legal services to Maryland's poorest citizens each year. More than 25 clinics focus on a broad range of practice areas, including civil and criminal litigation, advice and counseling, and transactional work. Civil practice areas include environmental law, health, housing and community development, juvenile law and children, AIDS, and immigration. Criminal student attorneys often represent defendants in misdemeanor cases in Maryland's district courts, as well as work in the School of Law's community justice efforts. In addition to in-house clinical work, students may gain experience in public and private nonprofit externships in the Baltimore-Washington region. Initiatives In addition to formal specialty programs, the law school sponsors a variety of academic and public service initiatives. These initiatives enhance the educational and scholarly mission of the law school and also serve the community. * Agriculture Law Education Initiative * Leadership, Ethics and Democracy (LEAD) Initiative: In spring 2008, the Fetzer Institute made a three-year $1.6 million funding commitment to the School of Law to help it respond to these challenges and create a Leadership, Ethics and Democracy program (LEAD). * Legislation, politics, and public policy: The University of Maryland School of Law offers students an educational experience in the areas of legislation, public policy and public interest practice. * Linking law and the arts: The University of Maryland School of Law, in conjunction with local arts organizations and as part of the \\"Linking Law and Arts\\" series, uses theater and art to help address complex legal, social, and public policy issues. As part of their commitment to blending law and the arts, students and professors at Maryland Law produced a short film in 2010 about the handling of war tribunals at Guantanamo Bay titled \\"The Response\\" starring Aasif Mandvi. UMD Carey Law is also one of fewer than 10 law schools in the United States to offer a course in Visual Legal Advocacy, teaching students how to and encouraging them to incorporate cinema into their advocacy work. *The Moser Ethics in Action Initiative *Erin Levitas Initiative Dual-degree programs The law school offers several dual-degree options: Business Maryland Law has a combined J.D./ through: * Robert H.

Complex and library Maryland Law, including the Thurgood Marshall Law Library, occupies a complex that supports the school's programs integrating classroom and experiential learning. The facility opened in 2002 and contains three courtrooms, including the Ceremonial Moot Courtroom, where state and federal trial and appellate courts regularly sit in session to hear cases. The Thurgood Marshall Law Library houses a collection of more than 495,000 volumes and equivalents accessible through the online catalog. A staff of 23, including 11 librarians, provides customized reference and consulting services to faculty and students. In addition to LexisNexis, Westlaw and Bloomberg Law, the library offers a legal and non-legal Web-based electronic databases. The library is named after Justice Thurgood Marshall.

Quran 68 describes God's justice and the judgment day. Three notable themes of this Surah are response to the opponents objections, warning and admonition to the disbelievers, and exhortation of patience to the Islamic prophet Muhammad.http://www.alim.org/library/quran/surah/introduction/68/MAL Chronologically, this is the first appearance of any of the \\"disjointed\\" [i.e., single] letters (muqattaat) which precede a number of the surahs of the Qur'anMuhammad Asad, Al-Qur'an translation, The Message of the Qur'an, First Hardback, 1980, Dar Al-Andalus, Gibraltar, while in Quranic Order this is the last surah to have the appearance of (muqattaat). Asbab al-nuzul Asbab al- nuzul (occasions or circumstances of revelation) is a secondary genre of Qur'anic exegesis (tafsir) directed at establishing the context in which specific verses of the Qur'an were revealed. Though of some use in reconstructing the Qur'an's historicity, asbab is by nature an exegetical rather than a historiographical genre, and as such usually associates the verses it explicates with general situations rather than specific events. Most of the mufassirun say that this surah was revealed at Mecca, at a stage when opposition to Muhammad had grown very strong and intense verbally. At the same time, here seems absence of any physical violence towards Muslims. According to some historians including William Muir,The Cor√¢n ‚Äì William Muir ayaat 9 to 16 refer to Walid ibn al-Mughirah as his personality traits fit in the character defined in these ayaat and a tradition by Ibn Abbas that \\"We know of no one whom God has described in the derogatory way in which He describes him, blighting him with ignominy that will never leave him (the adverbial qualifier [ba'da dhalika, 'moreover'] is semantically connected to zanim, 'ignoble')\\".Tafsir al-Jalalayn by Jalal al-Din al-Mahalli and Jalal ad-Din as- Suyuti Tafsir al-Jalalayn also highlights the correlation in 16th ayah: \\"Soon We shall brand him on the snout\\" and his nose being chopped off by a sword at the Battle of Badr. However the target personality is not restricted to a single person as the ayaat describe a personality type and not a name and the description starts with a plural form: \\"So do not obey the deniers\\". Period of revelation Surahs in the Qur'an are not arranged in the chronological order of revelation because order of wahy or chronological order of revelation is not a part of Quran but according to Aisha: \\"Muhammed always recited the Quran in Chronological order even in prayer\\" and there are many verses on arrangement of Quran e.g. Surah Furqhan Verse 32 \\"...we have repeated it in perfect arrangement\\" . Also other imaams tell that Ali was ordered by Muhammed to arrange the Quran in Chronological Order. According to Israr Ahmed: Muhammed told his followers the placement (sahaba) in Quranic order of every Wahy revealed along with the original text of Quran, Israr Ahmed's word on this cannot be taken as the only truth or the only view on this subject.Israr Ahmed ‚Äì Bayan-ul-Quran ‚Äì Introduction Wm Theodore de Bary, an East Asian studies expert, describes that \\"The final process of collection and codification of the Quran text was guided by one over-arching principle: God's words must not in any way be distorted or sullied by human intervention. For this reason, no serious attempt, apparently, was made to edit the numerous revelations, organize them into thematic units, or present them in chronological order....\\".Approaches to the Asian Classics, Irene Bloom, Wm Theodore de Bary, Columbia University Press, 1990, p. 65 , 9780231070058 Surat Al-Qalam is a Meccan suraQuran Verses in Chronological Order and meccan suras are chronologically earlier suras that were revealed to Muhammad at Mecca before the hijrah to Medina in 622 CE. They are typically shorter, with relatively short ayat, and mostly come near the end of the Qur'an's 114 surahs. Most of the surahs containing muqatta'at are Meccan. Henceforth apart from traditions, this surah qualifies to be Meccan typically. According to some classical traditions, commentaries and tafsirs the proposed order is 2nd in place right after Muhammad's first revelation. The supporting argument of this surah being the second revelation is that Arabs were unaware of angels in the time of Jahiliyyah and news of Muhammad's first revelation made them curious about the sanity of Muhammad, thus to refute this idea God revealed the first seven ayaat of Surah Qalam.Surah Al-Qalam (68:1‚Äì7) On the other hand, the latest suggested order is 18th place according to Theodor N√∂ldeke and John Medows RodwellThe Koran(1861) , Paperback setting the order band from 2nd to 18th. Sayyid Qutb (d. 1966), who was an Egyptian author, Islamist of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, in his Magnum opus Fi Zilal al-Qur'an (In the shades of the Qur'an) highlights a very interesting fact that The opening and the ending of the surah tackles the same point, therefore it is not possible to identify a specific time of revelation.Sayid Qutb, Fi Dhilal al-Quran. Beirut: Dar al-Shurruq (1981) George Sale estimates the revelation to be from fourth year of Islam.Sale, G., A Comprehensive Commentary on the Quran, (1896) The major scholars of Islam agree (Ijma) however that this is one of the earliest surahs to be revealed at Makkah.Abul A'la Maududi ‚Äì Tafhim ul-Qur'an (The Meaning of the Qur'an)Abdullah Yusuf Ali ‚Äì Quran English Translation & Commentary And perhaps the most balanced statement regarding time of revelation of this surah comes from Muhammad Asad (2 July 1900 ‚Äì 20 February 1992)Windhager, G√ºnther (2002). Leopold Weiss alias Muhammad Asad: Von Galizien nach Arabien 1900‚Äì1927 (in German). . p. 203 a Jewish-born Austro- Hungarian journalist, traveler, writer, linguist, thinker, political theorist, diplomat and Islamic scholar: > In the chronological order of revelation, this surah most probably occupies > the third place. Some authorities ‚Äì among them Suyuti ‚Äì incline to the view > that it was revealed immediately after the first five verses of surah 96 > (\\"The Germ-Cell\\"); this, however, is contradicted by some of the best- > authenticated traditions, according to which most of surah 74 came second in > the order of revelation (see introductory note to that surah). In any case, > \\"The Pen\\" is undoubtedly one of the oldest parts of the Qur'an. ‚ÄîMuhammad > Asad ‚Äì The Message of The Qur'an 1980 Coherence with adjacent surahs The idea of textual relation between the verses of a chapter has been discussed under various titles such as nazm and munasabah in non-English literature and coherence, text relations, intertextuality, and unity in English literature. Hamiduddin Farahi, an Islamic scholar of the Indian subcontinent, is known for his work on the concept of nazm, or coherence, in the Quran. Fakhruddin al-Razi (died 1209 CE), Zarkashi (died 1392) and several other classical as well as contemporary Quranic scholars have contributed to the studies. Connection with previous surah Surah Al-Mulk (67) and Surah Qalam (68) form a pair with regard to their subject matter.http://www.al-mawrid.org/index.php/articles/view/suurahs- mulk-qalam Thus there is no principal difference between the central themes and topics of the two. The difference lies in the style, nature of arguments and the tone adopted. In Surah Mulk, the Quraysh are warned of the Day of Judgement, while in Surah Qalam they are warned of the punishment which a people necessarily face if they deny their punishment of the Day of Judgement, similar is the warning sounded in this s≈´rah. However, this s≈´rah is more stern in its tone.http://www.al-mawrid.org/index.php/articles/view/surah- qalam-part-1-2 surah Mulk focused on believing in Allah, this surah Qalam focuses on believing in His Messenger, Muhammad.Abdul Nasir Jangda - Tafsir lectures - Bayyinah Institute, 2300 Valley View ln. Suite 500 Irving, TX 75062 Connection with next surah Surah Al-Haaqqa (69) also deeply resembles Surah Qalam (68), both having same the central theme: substantiation of the Day of Judgement. However, the nature of arguments differ. Just as the greatness and truth of the Qur'an are explained in the surah Qalam (68) and people are warned of the consequences of rejecting the Qur'an, similarly, in the next surah (69) this subject is discussed. The difference is that in surah 68, it is discussed in the opening part while in surah 69 it is in the concluding part. (Javed Ahmad Ghamidi (born 1951), a Pakistani Muslim theologian, Quran scholar, exegete, and educationist). Near the end of surah Qalam, Allah says:Quran Surah 68: ayah 44 \\"then leave Me (to deal) with the one who rejects this Hadeeth/Statement.‚Äú and in the beginning of surah Al- Haaqqa, Allah tells how He dealt with previous nations ( øƒÄd and Thamud) who rejected and oppressed the Messenger of Allah who came to them. Allah mentioned two groups of people briefly in surah Qalam; i.e. in Ayah 38 He mentions the people of Paradise, and in ayah 42 He mentions people who will not be able to prostrate/sajdah to Allah. Allah talks about two groups of people who receive their books on Judgment Day, good and bad.http://www.linguisticmiracle.com/tafsir/haqqah Theme of the surah There are almost seven divisions in the Qur'an according to Themes.Tadabbur-i- Quran#Contents The last of these seven sections goes from surah Al-Mulk [surah number 67] to surah Al-Nas [surah number 114]. This final part [last seventh of the Quran] focuses on sources of reflection, people, final scenes they will face on Judgment Day and hellfire and paradise in generalhttp://www.linguisticmiracle.com/tafsir/qalam and admonition to the Quraysh about their fate in the present and the hereafter if they deny Muhammad, specifically. The surah carries the theme \\"Let the good carry on their work, in spite of abuse of Companions of Evil: let all remember Allah, before Whom all men are on trial.\\"(Quran 68:1-33)Abdullah Yusuf Ali ‚Äì Quran English Translation & Commentary Note#C.247 True judgement comes from Allah, and not from the false standards of men.Quran 68:34-52http://www.quran4u.com/Tafsiraya/068%20Qalam.pdf Muhammad is addressed as if to say: \\"The disbelievers call you a madman whereas the Book that you are presenting and the sublime conduct that you practise are by themselves sufficient to refute their false accusations. Soon they will see as to who was mad and who was sane.\\" The disbelievers are admonished that well-being in the hereafter inevitably belongs to those who are God-conscious. It is utterly against reason that in the hereafter, the obedient servants should meet the same fate as the guilty. Those who are being called upon to bow before God in the world and refuse to do so, would be unable to prostrate themselves on the Day of Resurrection, even if they wanted to do so, and thus would stand disgraced and condemned. They have no reasonable ground for opposing the Prophet Muhammad, they cannot either make the claim that they know with certainty that he is not a true messenger of God, nor that what he says is false. In conclusion, Muhammad has been exhorted: \\"Bear with patience the hardships that you may have to face in the way of preaching the Faith until Allah's judgement arrives, and avoid the impatience which caused suffering and affliction to Jonah.\\" Subject matter of the surah This surah opens with the single discrete Arabic letter Nun (letter) and the oath of the Divine One swearing by the instrument of The Pen, as well as all knowledge that people are able to preserve and communicate thereby, is split into three parts according to the subject matter: * 1st part ‚Äì Defending Muhammad. Allah has declared Muhammad to be of the highest moral character and Do not yield any disbelieving oath monger, slanderer and wicked person.http://www.alim.org/library/quran/ayah/theme/68#sthash.hYBjzRAz.dpuf * 2nd part ‚Äì The example of companions of the Garden [aS-haab al Jannah]. What happened to the arrogant stingy owners of a garden who did not want to pay charity? * 3rd part ‚Äì Harshly rebuking those who deny life after death.Quran 68:17 to 68:33 The disbelievers would say that ‚Äì if hypothetically there is a life in the next world, \\"What is preventing us from being in power in the next world, just as we are in power in this world?\\" a ‚Äì Response: Do you think that Allah is so unjust that He cannot see the difference between the one who is right (and submits to Him) and the one who is wrong (disbelieves in His signs)? b - Allah challenges the disbelievers that if there is no next life, or that the disbelievers will be successful in the next life, then produce your evidence or proof that this is true. c ‚Äì the surah begins with Allah defending His Messenger, and then ends with consoling him. Consolation from Allah to the Islamic prophet Muhammad is; And do not rush (don't become impatient). Why? Because there was another Messenger ‚Äì Prophet Yunus (Jonah) ‚Äì the companion of the Whale (saahib-il Hoot). He became a little bit impatient for the help of Allah to arrive/he rushed a little bit.http://www.linguisticmiracle.com/home/qalam Hadith about al- Qalam Although scholars including ibn Taymiyyah claim that Muhammad has commented on the whole of the Qur'an, others including Ghazali cite the limited amount of narratives, thus indicating that he has commented only on a portion of the Qur'anMuhsin Demirci, Tefsir Usul√º, 120 yet the first and foremost exegesis/tafsir of the Qur'an is found in hadith of Muhammad.≈ûatibi, El-muvafakat Hadƒ´th (ÿ≠ÿØŸäÿ´) is literally \\"speech\\"; recorded saying or tradition of Muhammad validated by isnad; with Sirah Rasul Allah these comprise the sunnah and reveal shariah.

Since salah is one of the prior most practice in Islam, its connection surah al-Qalam according to hadith is as followes : * Alqamah ibn Waqqas and Al-Aswad ibn Yazid said: A man came to Ibn Mas'ud. He said: I recite the mufassal surahs in one rak'ah. You might recite it quickly as one recites verse (poetry) quickly, or as the dried dates fall down (from the tree). But the Prophet (pbuh) used to recite two equal surahs in one rak'ah; he would recite (for instance) surahs an-Najm (53) and ar-Rahman (55) in one rak'ah, surahs Iqtarabat (54) and al-Haqqah (69) in one rak'ah, surahs at-Tur (52) and adh-Dhariyat (51) in one rak'ah, surahs al-Waqi'ah (56) and Nun (68) in one rak'ah, surahs al- Ma'arij (70) and an-Nazi'at (79) in one rak'ah, surahs al-Mutaffifin (83) and Abasa (80) in one rak'ah, surahs al-Muddaththir (74) and al-Muzzammil (73) in one rak'ah, surahs al-Insan (76) and al-Qiyamah (75) in one rak'ah, surahs an- Naba' (78) and al-Mursalat (77) in one rak'ah, and surahs ad-Dukhan (44) and at-Takwir (81) in one rak'ah.Narrated Ibn Mas'ud: Abu Dawud said: This is the arrangement of Ibn Mas'ud himself. Reference: Sunan Abi Dawud 1396 In-book: Book 6, Hadith 26 English translation: Book 6, Hadith 1391 Surah al-Qalam contains an ayah \\"The Day the shin will be uncovered and they are invited to prostration but the disbelievers will not be able\\".Quran 68:42 This ayah is from the category of Mutashabih and cannot be explained or understood decisively except from the hadith. * The Messenger of Allah said, \\"dajjal (the Antichrist) will appear in my Ummah and he will stay in the world for forty. I do not know whether this will be forty days or forty months or forty years. Allah will then send (Prophet) 'Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary). 'Isa will pursue him and slaughter him. Then people will survive for seven years (i.e., after the demise of 'Isa) in the state that there will be no rancour between two persons. Then Allah will send a cool breeze from the side of Ash-Sham. None will remain upon the face of the earth having the smallest particle of good or Faith in him but he will die, so much so that even if someone amongst you will enter the innermost part of a mountain, this breeze will reach that place also and will cause him to die. Only the wicked people will survive and they will be as fast as birds (i.e., to commit evil) and as ferocious towards one another as wild beasts. They will never appreciate the good, nor condemn evil. Then Shaitan (Satan) will come to them in the garb of a man and will say: 'Will you not obey me?' They will say: 'What do you order us to do?' He will command them to worship idols. They will have abundance of sustenance and will lead comfortable lives. Then the Trumpet will be blown. Every one hearing it, will turn his neck towards it and will raise it. The first one to hear that Trumpet will be a man who will be busy repairing the basin for his camels. He will become unconscious. Allah will send, or will cause to send, rain which will be like dew and there will grow out of it (like wild growth) the bodies of the people. Then the second Trumpet will be blown and they will stand up and begin to look around. Then it will be said: 'O people! Go to your Rubb.' Then there will be a command: 'Make them stand there.' After it they will be called to account. Then it will be said: 'Separate from them the share of the Fire.' It will be asked: 'How much?' It will be said: 'Nine hundred and ninety-nine out of every thousand.' That will be the Day which will make children hoary-headed men because of its terror and that will be the Day when the Shin will be uncovered.\\"'Abd Allah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As (May Allah be pleased with them) said that Narrated Abu Sa‚Äòid al-Khudri Narrated this Hadith[Muslim] Sunnah.com reference : Book 19, Hadith 3 Arabic/English book reference : Book 19, Hadith 1810 * Narrated Abu Sa‚Äòid al-Khudri: We said, \\"O Allah's Messenger (Ô∑∫)!

For seeing your Lord on that Day as you have no difficulty in seeing the sun and the moon (in a clear sky).\\" ...When there remain only those who used to worship Allah (solely), both the obedient ones and the mischievous ones, it will be said to them, 'What keeps you here when all the people have gone?' They will say, 'We parted with them (in the world) when we were in greater need of them than we are today, we heard the call of one proclaiming, 'Let every nation follow what they used to worship,' and now we are waiting for our Lord.' Then the Almighty will come to them in a shape other than the one which they saw the first time, and He will say, 'I am your Lord,' and they will say, 'You are not our Lord.' And none will speak: to Him then but the Prophets, and then it will be said to them, 'Do you know any sign by which you can recognize Him?' They will say. The Shin,' and so Allah will then uncover His Shin whereupon every believer will prostrate before Him and there will remain those who used to prostrate before Him just for showing off and for gaining good reputation. These people will try to prostrate but their backs will be rigid like one piece of a wood (and they will not be able to prostrate).

It is the most common mineral of thorium and is nearly always strongly radioactive. It was named in 1829 to reflect its thorium content. Thorite was discovered in 1828 on the island of L√∏v√∏ya, Norway, by the vicar and mineralogist, Hans Morten Thrane Esmark, who sent the first specimens of this black mineral to his father, Jens Esmark, who was a professor of mineralogy and geology. Occurrence Thorite in Prague national museum Small crystals of green thorite under magnification Specimens of thorite generally come from igneous pegmatites and volcanic extrusive rocks, hydrothermal veins and contact metamorphic rocks. It is also known to occur as small grains in detrital sands. Crystals are rare, but when found can produce nicely shaped short prismatic crystals with pyramidal terminations. It is commonly associated with zircon, monazite, gadolinite, fergusonite, uraninite, yttrialite and pyrochlore. Thorite is currently an important ore of uranium. A variety of thorite, often called \\"uranothorite\\", is particularly rich in uranium and has been a viable uranium ore at Bancroft in Ontario, Canada. Other varieties of thorite include \\"orangite\\", an orange variety, and \\"calciothorite\\", an impure variety with trace amounts of calcium. Properties Thorite is commonly metamict and hydrated, making it optically isotropic and amorphous. Owing to differences in composition, the specific gravity varies from 4.4 to 6.6 g/cm3. Hardness is 4.5 and the luster is vitreous or resinous. The color is normally black, but also brownish black, orange, yellowish-orange and dark green. Because thorite is highly radioactive, specimens are often metamict. This is a condition found in radioactive minerals that results from the destructive effects of its own radiation on its crystal lattice. The effect can destroy a crystal lattice completely while leaving the outward appearance unchanged.

This body of law, along with early Scandinavian law and Germanic law, descended from a family of ancient Germanic custom and legal thought. However, Anglo-Saxon law codes are distinct from other early Germanic legal statements ‚Äì known as the leges barbarorum, in part because they were written in Anglo-Saxon instead of in Latin. The laws of the Anglo-Saxons were the second in medieval Western Europe after those of the Irish to be expressed in a language other than Latin. Overview Inked records of early Germanic law (leges barbarorum) were, in many ways, the product of Roman influence. Throughout the early middle ages, as various \\"Teutonic\\", or Germanic, tribes on the continent came into closer and more peaceful contact with the highly institutionalized civilizations surrounding the Mediterranean ‚Äì chiefly the Roman empire ‚Äì it was inevitable that they would be affected by the cultural influences emanating from the south. Many Germanic tribes and nations subsequently began to imitate the cultural and institutional facets of Roman civilization. Few of these imitations were so important or had such a profound impact on the nature of \\"barbarian\\" life as the adoption of writing, a technology which spread throughout the Germanic kingdoms hand-in-hand with Christianity, a religion based on literacy. Up to this point, the laws, or customs, of the barbarian nations of Northern Europe were essentially oral: they were occasionally recited publicly, and relied for their continuation upon word-of-mouth, and the memory, perhaps capricious, of those whose burden it was to remember them. With writing, however, it was possible to set the ancient customs of the Northern Europeans into a lasting and more or less fixed form, using ink and parchment. It was a general trend among the Germanic tribes of Europe that adaptation of the Roman system of writing was soon followed by the production of a national code of laws. It was inevitable, too, that, in imitating the Roman practice of writing down law, facets of Roman law and jurisprudence would influence these new Germanic codes. The numerous legal and customary statements which make up the earliest written Germanic law codes from the continent are testament to the influences of Roman language and Roman law, as each was written in Latin (a foreign language) and was often significantly influenced by Byzantine Emperor Justinian's great legal code. In Britain, the situation was somewhat different, as Rome had retreated from the island by about 400 AD, and the native inhabitants who remained were, for a time, left relatively free of foreign influence. When, in 597 AD, strong Roman influence again reached the island of Britain (by now in the hands of the Anglo-Saxons), it was in the form of Christianity, the practitioners of which brought with them the art of letters, writing, and literacy. It is significant that it was shortly after the arrival of the first evangelical mission in England, led by Augustine and sent by Pope Gregory I, the first Anglo-Saxon law code appeared, issued by √Üthelberht, King of Kent. The first six pronouncements of this code deal solely with sanctions against molesting the property of the Christian church and its officers, notably demanding twelvefold compensation for stealing from God's house. In contrast, compensation for stealing from the king is set at only ninefold. Writing in the eighth century, the Venerable Bede comments that King √Üthelberht, \\"beside all other benefits that he of wise policy bestowed upon his subjects, appointed them, with his council of wise men, judicial dooms according to the examples of the Romans.\\" Iuxta exempla Romanorum is the Latin phrase Bede uses here; the meaning of this statement has exercised the curiosity of historians for centuries. It was not, as with the continental Germanic tribes, that √Üthelberht had the law written down in Latin; rather, without precedent, he used his own native language, Old English, to express the \\"dooms\\", or laws and judgements, which had force in his kingdom. Some have speculated that \\"according to the examples of the Romans\\" simply meant that √Üthelberht had decided to cast the law in writing, whereas previously it had always been a matter of unwritten tradition and custom, handed down through generations through oral transmission, and supplemented by the edicts of kings. As such, √Üthelberht's law code constitutes an important break in the tradition of Anglo-Saxon law: the body of Kentish legal customs, or at least a portion of them, were now represented by a written statement ‚Äì fixed, unchanging, no longer subject to the vagaries of memory. Law was now something that could be pointed to and, significantly, disseminated with ease. Whatever the exact motives for making oral law into written code were, King √Üthelberht's law code was the first of a long series of Anglo-Saxon law codes that would be published in England for the next four and a half centuries. Almost without exception, every official version of royal law issued during the Anglo-Saxon period was written in Old English. Divisions The various types of secular legal pronouncements which survive from the Anglo-Saxon period can be grouped into three general categories, according to the manner of their publication: # Laws and collections of laws promulgated by public authority; # Statements of custom # Private compilations of legal rules and enactments Laws and collections of laws promulgated by public authority To the first division belong the laws of the Kentish kings, √Üthelberht, Hlothhere and Eadric, Withraed; those of Ine of Wessex, of Offa (now lost), of Alfred the Great, Edward the Elder, √Üthelstan (The Judicia civitatis Lundoniae are a guild statute confirmed by King √Üthelstan), Edmund I, Edgar, √Üthelred and Cnut; the treaty between Alfred and Guthrum and the so-called treaty between Edward and Guthrum.  Statements of Custom  The statements of custom included a great many of the rules entered in collections promulgated by kings; most of the paragraphs of √Üthelberht's, Hlothhere's and Eadric's, and Ine's laws, are popular legal customs that have received the stamp of royal authority by their insertion in official codes. On the other hand, from Withraed's and Alfred's laws downwards, the element of enactment by central authority becomes more and more prominent. The kings endeavour, with the help of secular and clerical witan, to introduce new rules and to break the power of long-standing customs (e.g. the precepts about the keeping of holidays, the enactments of Edmund restricting private vengeance, and the solidarity of kindreds as to feuds, and the like). There are, however, no outward signs enabling us to distinguish conclusively between both categories of laws in the codes, nor is it possible to draw a line between permanent laws and personal ordinances of single sovereigns, as has been attempted in the case of Frankish legislation. Influences The oldest Anglo-Saxon law codes, especially from Kent and Wessex, reveal a close affinity to the laws of the North Sea peoples‚Äîthose of the Saxons, Frisians, and Scandinavians. For example, one finds a division of social ranks reminiscent of the threefold gradation of nearby peoples (cf. OE eorl \\"nobleman\\", ƒãeorl \\"freeman\\", √æƒìow \\"bondman\\", Norse jarl, karl, √ær√¶ll, Frisian etheling, friling, lƒìt), and not of the twofold Frankish one (baro \\"freeman\\", l√¶tus \\"bondman\\"), nor of the slight differentiation of the Upper Germans and Lombards. In subsequent history there is a good deal of resemblance between the capitularies' legislation of Charlemagne and his successors on one hand, the acts of Alfred, Edward the Elder, √Üthelstan and Edgar on the other, a resemblance called forth less by direct borrowing of Frankish institutions than by the similarity of political problems and condition. Frankish law becomes a powerful modifying element in English legal history after the Conquest, when it was introduced wholesale in royal and in feudal courts. The Scandinavian invasions brought in many northern legal customs, especially in the districts thickly populated with Danes. The Domesday survey of Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Yorkshire, Norfolk, etc., shows remarkable deviations in local organization and justice (lagmen, sokes), and great peculiarities as to status (socmen, freemen), while from laws and a few charters we can perceive some influence on criminal law (nidings-vaerk), special usages as to fines (lahslit), the keeping of peace, attestation and sureties of acts (faestermen), etc. But, on the whole, the introduction of Danish and Norse elements, apart from local cases, was more important owing to the conflicts and compromises it called forth and its social results than on account of any distinct trail of Scandinavian views in English law. The Scandinavian newcomers coalesced easily and quickly with the native population. The direct influence of Roman law was not great during the Saxon period: there is neither the transmission of important legal doctrines, chiefly through the medium of Visigothic codes, nor the continuous stream of Roman tradition in local usage. But indirectly Roman law did exert a by no means insignificant influence through the medium of the Church, which, for all its apparent insular character, was still permeated with Roman ideas and forms of culture. The Old English \\"books\\" are derived in a roundabout way from Roman models, and the tribal law of real property was deeply modified by the introduction of individualistic notions as to ownership, donations, wills, rights of women, etc. Yet in this respect also the Norman Conquest increased the store of Roman conceptions by breaking the national isolation of the English Church and opening the way for closer intercourse with France and Italy. Important features Folk-right and privilege The Anglo-Saxon legal system cannot be understood unless one realizes the fundamental opposition between folk-right and privilege. Folk-right is the aggregate of rules, formulated or latent but susceptible of formulation, which can be appealed to as the expression of the juridical consciousness of the people at large or of the communities of which it is composed. It is tribal in its origin, and differentiated, not according to boundaries between states, but on national and provincial lines. There may be the folk-right of West and East Saxons, of East Angles, of Kentish men, Mercians, Northumbrians, Danes, Welshmen, and these main folk-right divisions remain even when tribal kingdoms disappear and the people are concentrated in one or two realms. The chief centres for the formulation and application of folk-right were, in the 10th and 11th centuries, the shire-moots, while the witan of the realm generally placed themselves on the higher ground of State expediency, although occasionally using folk-right ideas. The older law of real property, of succession, of contracts, the customary tariffs of fines, were mainly regulated by folk-right; the reeves employed by the king and great men were supposed to take care of local and rural affairs according to folk-right. The law had to be declared and applied by the people itself in its communities, while the spokesmen of the people were neither democratic majorities nor individual experts, but a few leading men‚Äîthe twelve eldest thanes or some similar quorum. Folk-right could, however, be broken or modified by special law or special grant, and the fountain of such privileges was the royal power. Alterations and exceptions were, as a matter of fact, suggested by the interested parties themselves, and chiefly by the Church. Thus a privileged land-tenure was created‚Äîbookland; the rules as to the succession of kinsmen were set at nought by concession of testamentary power and confirmations of grants and wills; special exemptions from the jurisdiction of the hundreds and special privileges as to levying fines were conferred. In process of time the rights originating in royal grants of privilege overbalanced, as it were, folk-right in many respects, and became themselves the starting-point of a new legal system‚Äîthe feudal one.  Criminal justice  Anglo-Saxon England did not have a professional standing law enforcement body analogous to modern police. In general, if a crime was committed then there was a victim, and it was up to the victim ‚Äì or the victim's family ‚Äì to seek justice. However, after the tenth century there were some changes in Anglo-Saxon England. All shires, or counties, were subdivided into hundreds. These hundreds were subdivided into tithings. The three types of division had three types of representatives as well: the tithings had a tithingman, the hundreds a hundredman and the shires a shire-reeve. They met every four weeks. The main function of this group seems to have been administrative: the king spoke to the shire-reeve, the shire-reeve spoke to the hundredmen, and the hundredmen spoke to the tithingmen when giving tasks. Examples of tasks could be, for instance, that legitimate trading was encouraged or that there was no cattle theft. They also dealt with crimes that were against a king's peace. But still the biggest power of seeking justice lay in the hands of the victim or the victim's family. The judicial functions of the Anglo-Saxon legal system was mainly practiced by courts. Once a charge had been brought, it had to be heard by a court which would decide whether or not a crime had been committed and, if so, what action was necessary. The hundred court met every 4 weeks but the shire court only met twice a year. Lawsuits could be passed on to the shire court if the hundred court was not able to reach a judgement. The preservation of peace Another feature of vital importance in the history of Anglo-Saxon law is its tendency towards the preservation of peace. Already in √Üthelberht's legislation we find characteristic fines inflicted for breach of the peace of householders of different ranks‚Äîthe ceorl, the eorl, and the king himself appearing as the most exalted among them. Peace is considered not so much a state of equilibrium and friendly relations between parties, but rather as the rule of a third within a certain region‚Äîa house, an estate, a kingdom. This leads on one side to the recognition of private authorities‚Äîthe father's in his family, the master's as to servants, the lord's as to his personal or territorial dependents. On the other hand, the tendency to maintain peace naturally takes its course towards the strongest ruler, the king, and we witness in Anglo-Saxon law the gradual evolution of more and more stringent and complete rules in respect of the king's peace and its infringements. The codices of the early 11th century (Cnut, Aethelred) establish specific conditions of guaranteed peace or protection depending on particular limitations in time or place, known as grith, such as ciric-gri√∞ \\"church- grith\\" (right of asylum in a church) or hand-gri√∞ \\"hand-grith\\" (protection under the king's hand). Legislation In course of time the natural associations get loosened and intermixed, and this calls forth the elaborate legislation of the later Anglo-Saxon kings. Regulations are issued about the sale of cattle in the presence of witnesses. Enactments about the pursuit of thieves, and the calling in of warrantors to justify sales of chattels, are other expressions of the difficulties attending peaceful intercourse. Personal surety groups appear as a complement of and substitute for more collective responsibility. The hlaford and his hiredmen are an institution not only of private patronage, but also of supervision for the sake of laying hands on malefactors and suspected persons. The landrica assumes the same part in a territorial district. Ultimately the laws of the 10th and 11th centuries show the beginnings of the frankpledge associations, which came to influence an important part of the feudal age. Language and dialect The English dialect in which the Anglo-Saxon laws have been handed down is in most cases a common speech derived from West Saxon. By the tenth century the West Saxons had become predominant among the Anglo-Saxon kings, and their lands were home to some of the most developed religious and monastic centres on the island. It was such centres which had the wealth, expertise, and motivation, to create and to copy texts for distribution. Therefore, the dialect current in the South ‚Äì and particularly that of Winchester ‚Äì became the dominant literary dialect. As most of the surviving Old English law codes are only preserved in copies made during the eleventh century, the West Saxon dialect is predominant. However, traces of the Kentish dialect can be detected in codes copied out in the Textus Roffensis, a manuscript containing the earliest Kentish laws. Northumbrian dialectical peculiarities are also noticeable in some codes, while Danish words occur as technical terms in some documents, especially those composed in the eleventh century. With the Norman Conquest, Latin took the place of English as the language of legislation, though many technical terms from English for which Latin did not have an equivalent expression were retained.

Biography Harry Nice was born in Washington D.C., but was raised in Baltimore, Maryland. He later attended Baltimore City College, Dickinson College and graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law in 1899. He was married to Edna Viola Amos in 1905, with whom he had two sons, Harry Jr, and William, who died in childhood. Nice served as assistant to the State's Attorney in Baltimore, but later resigned to run for the Republican nomination for governor of Maryland in 1919. He lost to Democrat Albert C. Ritchie by a narrow margin. Following the defeat, Nice accepted a position in the Appeals Tax Court of Baltimore City as a judge from 1920 until 1924. In 1934, running under the campaign motto of \\"Right the wrong of 1919\\", Nice again challenged Ritchie and defeated him by 6,149 votes. Nice rose to become governor during the national depression, which brought great financial hardships to the state budget. To help find a solution to the situation, Nice assigned a committee to investigate ways of alleviating the debt, but was not pleased with the recommendations of raising taxes. Neither he nor the Maryland General Assembly felt it would be wise to raise taxes at such a rate. Also as governor, Nice redesigned the governors' residence at Government House, changing the architectural style from Victorian to Georgian. After losing the support of his party, Nice was defeated by Herbert R. O'Conor in 1938. He attempted to run for the U.S. Senate in 1940, but was unsuccessful and resumed his law practice in Baltimore. He died on February 25, 1941 in Richmond, Virginia.

He was elected to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom in 1918, and besides an interval of months in 1923‚Äì24, remained in parliament until his death. His Cabinet roles were as the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the National Government (1931‚Äì1935) of Ramsay MacDonald; as the Secretary of State for Scotland in the National Government (1935‚Äì1937) of Stanley Baldwin; and as Minister of Health in Neville Chamberlain's National Government (1937‚Äì1939) and the short-lived Chamberlain war ministry. While in medical training at university he was President of the Glasgow University Union and served in the First World War, winning the Military Cross on two occasions. In the course of his career he was Member of Parliament for the constituencies of Lanark, Glasgow Kelvingrove, and Combined Scottish Universities. He was also Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, Rector of the University of Aberdeen, and Rector of the University of Glasgow. Early life He was born in Lanark the eldest son of William Elliot, of the livestock auctioneers' firm Lawrie and Symington, and his wife, Ellen Elizabeth Shiels. His mother died during the birth of his youngest sibling. The children were thereafter raised by the mother's relatives in Glasgow. They appear to have had a company, Shiels, Elliot and Nelson, who made farming equipment including the Shiels patent milking machine.Glasgow Post Office Directory 1900 Elliot was raised in Glasgow and educated at the high school in Lanark and The Glasgow Academy. One of his friends from the Academy, through university and beyond, was the playwright Osborne Henry Mavor. From 1905 he studied science and medicine at the University of Glasgow. In the election for Rector of the University of Glasgow in 1908, Elliot assisted the Liberal Club campaign to elect the Liberal David Lloyd George, supported the candidacy of George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston, and according to Henry Mavor, ultimately voted for Keir Hardie, founder of the Labour Party. In 1909‚Äì10 he was editor of the Glasgow University Magazine. He co-wrote the university song \\"Ygorra\\". Elliot graduated BSc in 1910. As a postgraduate he was President of the Glasgow University Union, 1911‚Äì12. While in the British Army's Glasgow University Officers' Training Corps, he befriended John Boyd Orr. He graduated MB ChB in 1913. In 1913‚Äì14 he was houseman (a newly qualified doctor) at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary.  First World War  At the onset of the First World War the Special Reserve of the Royal Army Medical Corps was mobilised and in December 1914 Elliot was attached as a medical officer to the Royal Scots Greys on the Western Front. He won a Military Cross for his actions at Wancourt during the Battle of Arras in April 1917. He won a second Military Cross in the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917, adding a bar to the original medal. Walter received a leg wound in the final month of the war, but returned home safely. His younger brother Dan Elliot was killed in 1915, during the Gallipoli campaign. After the war, Elliot refused his father's urging to enter the family business, Lawrie and Symington, and instead began a political career after being asked to stand for election while recovering from his war-wound. The invitation came from the governing Lloyd George ministry, a coalition government of the Liberal Party with the Conservative Party and their allies the Unionist Party. Elliot was indifferent to party-political divisions, and was reputed to have agreed to stand before asking which party's ticket he should stand for.  Member of Parliament  Elliot then entered politics and was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Lanark in the 1918 general election, standing as a Unionist. In 1919 he was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Liberal Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Health for Scotland, John Pratt. During his first stint in parliament he shared a house in Westminster with Liberal MP Colin Coote, who was later to write a biography of Elliot. In the same period Elliot met Blanche \\"Baffy\\" Dugdale niece and biographer of Arthur Balfour, whose Zionism Elliot came to support. Elliot also undertook scientific research during parliamentary recesses; his friend John Boyd Orr invited him to work at the Rowett Research Institute. In the Commons, Elliot supported the Government of Ireland Act 1920, which established the Partition of Ireland into Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland as an attempt at Home Rule. At the pivotal Carlton Club meeting on 19 October 1922, he supported the Conservative Party's ongoing coalition government of the Lloyd George ministry, but the Party favoured ending its involvement. From Elliot's research emerged a doctoral thesis on nutrition in pigs submitted to the University of Glasgow and for which Elliot was made Doctor of Science in 1923. He lost this seat in the 1923 general election but regained a place in the House of Commons months later in the 1924 Glasgow Kelvingrove by-election, a seat he held until July 1945.  Junior Minister  In January 1923 Elliot was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Health for Scotland in the government of Stanley Baldwin. He briefly lost the post during the Labour Party's 1924 first MacDonald ministry, but regained it after Baldwin's return to power that same year. In July 1926 Elliot was made to Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, a role he filled until 1929. He made an official visit to Colonial Nigeria in 1927. He was involved in the passage of the Local Government Act 1929, as well as reforms to administration in Scotland in 1928 and changes to Scottish ministers' positions in 1926. In 1924 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir Robert Blyth Greig, Frederick Orpen Bower, Arthur Crichton Mitchell, and William Archer Porter Tait. Elliot was involved in the Empire Marketing Board from October 1927, having been appointed president of the Imperial Research Conference in Westminster Hall. and with John Boyd Orr began a project that conducted experiments in 1927 proving the value of feeding free milk to children in schools, and this persuaded Elliot to extend the pilot scheme to all Scotland's schools by legislation. Elliot was a supporter of the Empire Marketing Board Film Unit and its work on documentary films, particularly those of John Grierson, including Drifters in 1929. In May 1928, Elliot and Arthur Samuel, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury were reported to be working together in helping the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Winston Churchill in the budget debate. After the formation of the first National Government (1931), Elliot was appointed Financial Secretary to the Treasury, a post he retained in the following second National Government (1931‚Äì1935). Early in 1932 Elliot was made a Privy Counsellor.  Cabinet Minister  Political dispute over the British Empire Economic Conference held in Ottawa in summer 1932 ‚Äì in which the British Dominions' governments discussed solutions to the Great Depression ‚Äì eventually caused the replacement of the then Home Secretary Herbert Samuel with Sir John Gilmour, 2nd Baronet. In the same cabinet reshuffle, it was generally anticipated that Elliot would be appointed Secretary of State for Scotland, including by Elliot himself and by the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, but unexpectedly Elliot was appointed to replace Gilmour as Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food while Godfrey Collins became the Scottish Secretary after the departure of Sir Archibald Sinclair, 4th Baronet. He was seen by many as a rising star. In 1932 he entered the Cabinet as Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and subsequently served as Secretary of State for Scotland and Minister of Health. Amongst his achievements were the Agricultural Marketing Act which sought to protect food producers from going bankrupt amidst massive surpluses and collapsing prices, the introduction of free milk for school children and formation of the National Housing Company which built prefabricated steel-based \\"Weir Houses\\" (produced for industrialist William Weir, 1st Viscount Weir) in Clydeside. While Minister of Agriculture, Elliot asked John Boyd Orr, who advocated a national food policy, to prepare a report on nutrition and public health, though it went unpublished because of their political ramifications. Orr published the report himself as Food, Health and Income in early 1936, advocating national and international co-ordination on nutrition. He was elected Rector of the University of Aberdeen in 1933, serving until 1936. Elliot was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1935. On 29 March 1939, Elliot passed the Cancer Act 1939 - \\"An Act to make further provision for the treatment of cancer, to authorise the Minister of Health to lend money to the National Radium Trust, to prohibit certain advertisements relating to cancer, and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid\\". All provisions in the Act for improving the treatment of cancer nationally have since been stripped, leaving only the prohibition against advertisements relating to cancer treatments. In 1938 Elliot's career reached a turning point when he came close to resigning over the Munich Agreement but decided against. Consequently, his political stock began to fall and when Winston Churchill replaced Neville Chamberlain as Prime Minister in 1940, Elliot was dropped from the government. He later served as Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. In the 1945 election, he lost his Kelvingrove seat by just 88 votes.1945 General Election result. Walter Elliot helped save the Palace of Westminster's great hall during the Blitz. Westminster Hall (built 1097) is the largest remnant of the medieval palace; its roof greater span than any timber roof in England, built by Hugh Herland (begun 1393).  Second World War  Churchill did not include Elliot in the Churchill war ministry during the Second World War; instead, Churchill offered him the post of Governor of British Burma (the \\"Scottish Colony\\") in October 1940, which Elliot refused. Since leaving government, Elliot become deputy assistant adjutant-general at Chester. There he dealt with refugees from The Blitz. After refusing the governorship of Burma, in January the following year he accepted the role of director of public relations at the War Office. He also sat on the Scottish Council of State established by Churchill's Secretary of State for Scotland, Tom Johnston, since Elliot was himself a former Scotland Secretary. In May 1941, during the London Blitz, Elliot chanced to be nearby the Palace of Westminster during a heavy air-raid which damaged the building. In the fire that followed, he was able to direct the London Fire Brigade to focus their efforts on saving the centuries-old Westminster Hall, with its unrivalled medieval hammerbeam roof, rather than on the Victorian Gothic chamber of the House of Commons, which was destroyed. During his time at the War Office, Elliot commissioned war artists in co-operation with Kenneth Clark, the Surveyor of the King's Pictures, director of the National Gallery, and instigator of the War Artists' Advisory Committee. He also commissioned war- work from writers, including Eric Linklater. At the end of the year Elliot left his job at the War Office; he retired from the British Army having been promoted Colonel. He was chair of the Public Accounts Committee, a powerful House of Commons select committee, in 1942. During his chairmanship, he handled an inquiry examining deals between the Marconi Company and the Air Ministry; the investigation ended in the company forfeiting the proceeds. In the beginning of 1943, Elliot suffered serious injury in an accident at the railway station at Hawick, while boarding a train on the Waverley Route between Edinburgh and Carlisle. He took the rest of 1943 to recover. In this time he was chair of committee on herring fisheries and published a collection of broadcasts he had made the previous year as Long Distance. In early 1944 Elliot travelled to British West Africa, where he was instrumental in the eventual establishment of universities in the Gold Coast, the Sierra Leone Colony and Protectorate, and British Nigeria. The commission established to deal with higher education in West Africa was chaired by Elliot. Elliot had a meeting with Joseph Stalin as part of a parliamentary delegation to the Soviet Union, one of the Allies, in spring 1945. In the 1945 general election which brought the Attlee ministry to power, he lost the Glasgow Kelvingrove constituency to Labour's John Williams.  Backbencher  He was returned for the Combined Scottish Universities seat in the November 1946 Combined Scottish Universities by-election, in which he replaced John Boyd Orr, who had resigned to become Director-General of the United Nations' new Food and Agriculture Organization. (This was the last such election.) When the university seats were abolished, Elliot returned to Kelvingrove where he beat his Labour opponent from 1945, John Lloyd Williams, and SNP candidate Hugh MacDiarmid in the 1950 election. Between 1947 and 1950, Elliot was the elected Rector of the University of Glasgow. He was a governor of The Peckham Experiment in 1949. The same year, Elliot undertook a journey to the newly-established State of Israel to report for The Daily Telegraph. Elliot was a strong supporter of Israel. In 1954 Elliot led the Parliamentary Delegation of Inquiry into the Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya Colony. He also led the popular Elliot Commission on Higher Education in West Africa whose report informed the creation of the first university colleges in West African countries such as Nigeria and Ghana. Elliot co-founded the NATO Parliamentary Assembly in 1955, and was its treasurer, often travelling to North America on NATO business. He frequently attended the K√∂nigswinter Conference at K√∂nigswinter in West Germany, an Anglo-German meeting of parliamentarians held annually from 1950. Besides his fellowship in the Royal Society and the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Elliot was also fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. Six universities awarded him honorary Legum Doctor (LLD) doctorates, including all the ancient universities of Scotland (Aberdeen, Edinburgh, St Andrews, Glasgow) and the universities of Leeds and Manchester. He received an honorary Doctor of Science (DSc) degree from the University of South Africa. He was made a Companion of Honour (CH) in 1952. He was also Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland 1956‚Äì1957. He regularly appeared on the BBC television programme The Brains Trust and the BBC Home Service's radio programme Any Questions?.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVpCUtNdM0Q Family Elliot married Helen Hamilton on 27 August 1919, but she died on 8 September in a mountaineering accident on their honeymoon on the Isle of Skye's Cuillin hills. He married secondly Katharine Tennant (the daughter of Sir Charles Tennant, 1st Baronet and a half-sister of Margot Asquith) on 2 April 1934.  Death  He died at the family estate of Harwood (inherited from his father) in Bonchester Bridge on 8 January 1958 of a coronary thrombosis. He was buried in Hobkirk churchyard three days later. On Elliot's death, his widow stood as a Unionist for her husband's former seat of Glasgow Kelvingrove; she was defeated in the 1958 Glasgow Kelvingrove by-election by Labour's Mary McAlister. Afterwards she was instead one the four women initially created a life peer under the Life Peerages Act 1958. As the Baroness Elliot of Harwood, she was the first woman to speak in the modern House of Lords.Memorial bench dedicated to Walter Elliot in Princes Street Gardens, Edinburgh, \\"presented by fellow officers of the Royal Scots Greys\\" Publications *Toryism in the Twentieth Century (1927) *Long Distance (1943) Recognition The Elliot Library at the Glasgow University Union is named after him.

The experiment ran from 1981 until 1990, and its main objective was to discover the W and Z bosons. UA2, together with the UA1 experiment, succeeded in discovering these particles in 1983, leading to the 1984 Nobel Prize in Physics being awarded to Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer. The UA2 experiment also observed the first evidence for jet production in hadron collisions in 1981, and was involved in the searches of the top quark and of supersymmetric particles. Pierre Darriulat was the spokesperson of UA2 from 1981 to 1986, followed by Luigi Di Lella from 1986 to 1990. Background Around 1968 Sheldon Glashow, Steven Weinberg, and Abdus Salam came up with the electroweak theory, which unified electromagnetism and weak interactions, and for which they shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics. The theory postulated the existence of W and Z bosons, and the pressure on the research community to prove the existence of these particles experimentally was substantial. During the 70s it was established that the masses of the W and Z bosons were in the range of 60 to 80 GeV (W boson) and 75 to 92 GeV (Z boson) ‚Äî energies too large to be accessible by any accelerator in operation at that time. In 1976, Carlo Rubbia, Peter McIntyre and David Cline proposed to modify a proton accelerator ‚Äî at that time a proton accelerator was already running at Fermilab and one was under construction at CERN (SPS) ‚Äî into a proton‚Äìantiproton collider, able to reach energies large enough to produce W and Z bosons. The proposal was adopted at CERN in 1978, and the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) was modified to occasionally operate as a proton-antiproton collider (SpS). History On 29 June 1978 the UA1 experiment was approved. Two proposals for a second detector, with the same purpose as UA1, were made the same year. On 14 December 1978, the proposal of Pierre Darriulat, Luigi Di Lella and collaborators, was approved. Like UA1, UA2 was a moveable detector, custom built around the beam pipe of the collider, which searched proton‚Äìantiproton collisions for signatures of the W and Z particles. The UA2 experiment began operating in December 1981. The initial UA2 collaboration consisted of about 60 physicists from Bern, CERN, Copenhagen, Orsay, Pavia and Saclay. From 1981 to 1985, the UA1 and UA2 experiments collected data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately . From 1985 to 1987 the SpS was upgraded, and the luminosity of the machine increased by a factor 10 compared to the previous performance. The UA2 sub-detectors were also upgraded, making the detector hermetic, which increased its ability to measure missing transverse energy. The second experimental phase ran from 1987 to 1990. Groups from Cambridge, Heidelberg, Milano, Perugia and Pisa joined the collaboration, which grew to about 100 physicists. During this phase, UA2 accumulated data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of in three major running periods. After nearly ten years of operation, the UA2 experimental program stopped running at the end of 1990. Components and operation Civil engineering for the underground experimental hall at LSS4 The UA1 and UA2 experiments recorded data during proton‚Äìantiproton collision operation and moved back after periods of data taking, so that the SPS could revert to fixed-target operation. UA2 was moved on air cushions when removed from the beam pipe of the SpS. Construction The UA2 experiment was located some 50 meters underground, in the ring of the SPS/SpS accelerator, and was housed in a big cavern. The cavern was large enough to house the detector, provide room for it to be assembled in a \\"garage position\\" without shutting down the accelerator and to where it was also moved back after periods of data taking. The accelerator could therefore revert to fixed-target operation, after periods of operating as a collider. Detectors The UA1 and the UA2 experiments had many things in common; they were both operating on the same accelerator and both had the same objective (to discover the W and Z bosons). The main difference was the detector design; UA1 was a multipurpose detector, while UA2 had a more limited scope. UA2 was optimized for the detection of electrons from W and Z decays. The emphasis was on a highly granular calorimeter ‚Äì a detector measuring how much energy particles deposit ‚Äì with spherical projective geometry, which also was well adapted to the detection of hadronic jets. Charged particle tracking was performed in the central detector, and energy measurements were performed in the calorimeters. Unlike UA1, UA2 had no muon detector. Detector for the UA2 experiment. The picture shows the detector after the 1985-1987 upgrade, when new end-cap calorimeters were added to improve the search for the top quark and new physics. The calorimeter had 24 slices, each weighing 4 tons. These slices were arranged around the collision point like segments of an orange. Particles ejected from the collision produced showers of secondary particles in the layers of heavy material. These showers passed through layers of plastic scintillators, generating light which was read with photomultiplier by the data collection electronics. The amount of light was proportional to the energy of the original particle. Accurate calibration of the central calorimeter allowed the W and Z masses to be measured with a precision of about 1%. Upgrades of the detector The 1985-1987 upgrade of the detector was aimed at two aspects: full calorimeter coverage and better electron identification at lower transverse momenta. The first aspect was addressed by replacing the end-caps with new calorimeters that covered the regions 6¬∞-40¬∞ with respect to the beam direction, thereby hermetically sealing the detector. The end-cap calorimeters consisted of lead/scintillator samplings for the electromagnetic part, and iron/scintillator for the hadronic part. The performance and granularity of the new calorimeters were set to match the central calorimeter, which was of importance for the triggering system. The electron identification was improved by the use of a completely new central tracking detector assembly, partly consisting of a pioneering silicone-pad detector. In 1989, the collaboration pushed this concept even further by developing a Silicon Pad Detector (SPD) with finer pad segmentation to be placed directly around the collision region beam pipe. This detector was built as a cylinder, closely surrounding the beam pipe. The detector had to fit into the available space of less than 1 cm. It was therefore necessary to miniaturize the components of the detector. This was achieved with two brand new technologies: the silicon sensor and the Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). Existing electronics were too bulky, and therefore a novel ASIC had to be developed. This was the first silicon tracker adapted to a collider experiment, a technology prior to the present silicon detectors. Results W boson at CERN. From right to left: Carlo Rubbia, spokesperson of the UA1 experiment; Simon van der Meer, responsible for developing the stochastic cooling technique; Herwig Schopper, Director-General of CERN; Erwin Gabathuler, Research Director at CERN, and Pierre Darriulat, spokesperson of the UA2 experiment. Hadronic jets at high transverse momentum The very first result of the UA2 collaboration, published on 2 December 1982, was the first unambiguous observation of hadronic jet production at high transverse momentum from hadronic collisions. Observations of hadronic jets confirmed that the theory of quantum chromodynamics could describe the gross features of the strong parton interaction. Discovery of the W and Z bosons The UA2 and UA1 collaboration chose to search for the W boson by identifying its leptonic decay, because the hadronic decays, although more frequent, have a larger background. By the end 1982, the SpS had reached high enough luminosity to permit the observation of W \\\\rightarrow e u and W \\\\rightarrow \\\\mu u decays. On 22 January 1983, the UA2 collaboration announced that the UA2 detector had recorded four events that were candidates for a W boson. This brought the combined number of candidate events seen by UA1 and UA2 up to 10. Three days later, CERN made a public announcement that the W boson was found. The next step was to track down the Z boson. However, the theory said that the Z boson would be ten times rarer than the W boson. The experiments therefore needed to collect several times the data collected in the 1982 run that showed the existence of the W boson. With improved techniques and methods, the luminosity was increased substantially. These efforts were successful, and on 1 June 1983, the formal announcement of the discovery of the Z boson was made at CERN. Search for the top quark Throughout the runs with the upgraded detector, the UA2 collaboration was in competition with experiments at Fermilab in the US in the search for the top quark. Physicists had anticipated its existence since 1977, when its partner ‚Äî the bottom quark ‚Äî was discovered. It was felt that the discovery of the top quark was imminent. During the 1987-1990 run UA2 collected 2065 W \\\\rightarrow e u decays, and 251 Z decays to electron pairs, from which the ratio of the mass of the W boson and the mass of the Z boson could be measured with a precision of 0.5%. By 1991 a precise measurement for the mass of the Z boson from LEP had become available. Using the ratio of the W mass to Z mass, a first precise measurement of the W mass could be made. These mass values could be used to predict the top quark from its virtual effect on the W mass. The result of this study gave a top quark mass value in the range of 110 GeV to 220 GeV, beyond the reach for direct detection by UA2 at the SpS. The top quark was ultimately discovered in 1995 by physicists at Fermilab with a mass near 175 GeV.

The road continues west into the Regional Municipality of Peel as Regional Road 2 and east into the Regional Municipality of Durham Regions as Regional Road 37. The road is considered a high-density transit corridor by Metrolinx. At its intersection with Yonge Street in North York, the Finch subway station and the Finch Bus Terminal carry some of the highest numbers of commuters in the city. History The intersection of Bayview and Finch was opened October 1960, eliminating a jog in both roads over Newtonbrook Creek Finch Avenue was named after hotel owner John Finch, who operated John Finch's Hotel at the northeast corner of Finch Avenue and Yonge Street in Toronto.A Glimpse of Toronto's History City Planning Division, Urban Development Services, City of Toronto 2001, MPLS 087 The road allowance was a concession road, and at one time, there were a number of older churches, schoolhouses, and cemeteries on each side of the road. In the 1950s, Ontario Hydro built a series of transmission lines around Toronto, and paralleled Finch from Highway 400 eastward into Pickering. A compressed natural gas pipeline also follows this routing. As suburban development in North York progressed northward in the 1960s, Finch was rapidly reconstructed from a gravel road into a four-laned traffic artery. This began with the realignment of several sections, such as at Bayview where Newtonbrook Creek flows diagonally beneath the crossroads. A rail overpass west of Leslie was built by 1968. In the west, Finch originally ended at the Humber River at Islington Avenue. A separate western section was later constructed as development occurred in the-then Borough of Etobicoke. Traffic proceeding west had to travel on Islington, south across the Humber to Albion Road, and west beyond Kipling Avenue to reach it. In the early 1990s, this gap was closed. Earlier, in the 1980s a short extension was built northwestward into Mississauga and Brampton with the construction of Highway 427, turning onto the Gorewood Drive concession (formerly Toronto Gore Township Concession 3). Finch ends at Steeles Avenue, and Gorewood Drive continues it for a short distance north of Highway 407, where the concession is cut off by the Claireville Conservation Area. The concession is then called McVean Drive in northeastern Brampton, north of Queen Street, the former Highway 7. It then continues into Caledon as Centreville Creek Road. On August 19, 2005, a freak rainstorm in Toronto caused the Black Creek water level to rise, which caused a section of Finch Avenue West near Sentinel Road (due south of York University between Keele and Jane Streets) to collapse, leaving a deep pit that prevented any pedestrian or vehicular traffic from passing through. The crater left where a 4 lane roadway once was is approximately 20-25 feet (7 metres) deep.http://jane- finch.com/pictures/flood2005.htm Two lanes reopened in late 2005, and the remaining lanes opened in April 2006. On July 24, 2009, two sinkholes appeared on Finch Avenue West between Dufferin Street and Bathurst Street. Route description Finch Ave. (circled) in Mississauga290px Despite its length (one of the longest streets in the Greater Toronto Area), few major landmarks are on Finch; it runs primarily through business and residential areas. The North York City Centre area, at the intersection with Yonge Street, has many condominium and office high-rises. Most of Finch Avenue west of Morningside Avenue is a four to six-lane principal arterial, with a speed limit of 60 km/h (35-40 mph) in most sections. East of Morningside, Finch Av. E becomes Staines Rd. a collector road that runs through residential communities, northeast to Steeles Av. E. East of Morningside the road is signed as Old Finch Avenue requiring connections with several north-south streets (Sewells Road, Meadowvale Road and Plug Hat Road) before continues briefly at the south end of Beare Road heading east as it enters into the City of Pickering in Durham Region after Scarborough-Pickering Townline where it is also known as Durham Regional Road 37. In Pickering, Finch Avenue is also known as Durham Road # 37 and continues east to Brock Road (Durham Regional Road 1). It ends at a cul- de-sac at Kingston Road (Durham Regional Highway 2 and formerly provincial Highway 2), and Kingston Rd. continues the concession line to the eastern boundary of Oshawa. In Mississauga and Brampton, Finch Avenue is designated as Peel Regional Road 2, and is the shortest road corridor under the jurisdiction of the Region of Peel. Transit infrastructure Finch subway station on the eastern branch of Line 1 Yonge‚ÄìUniversity of the Toronto subway is located at the intersection of Finch Avenue and Yonge Street. It is the northern terminus of the eastern branch and is a major regional transit hub. The Finch Bus Terminal, a hub for GO Transit, York Region Transit and Viva buses, is next to the station. Finch Avenue is served by buses of the Toronto Transit Commission 24 hours a day through regular routes (36 Finch West and 39 Finch East) and Blue Night Network routes (336 Finch West and 339 Finch East).Jeffrey Kay. \\"36 Finch / 36 Finch West.\\" Transit Toronto.Jeffrey Kay. \\"39 Finch East.\\" Transit Toronto. One express route, 939 Finch Express, provide faster transit along Finch Avenue and connects to Scarborough Centre station on Line 3 Scarborough in the east. Finch West station on the western branch of Line 1, was opened on December 17, 2017, and is located at the intersection of Finch Avenue and Keele Street. In 2007, former mayor David Miller proposed the construction of several light rail lines under the Transit City plan, one of which was Line 6 Finch West, which was proposed to operated between Humber College in the west and Finch West station in the east. After intermittently abandoning the proposal by succeeding mayor Rob Ford, the line was later approved for funding by Metrolinx and had been scheduled for completion in 2022, but after consultation with Mosaic Transit Group, the consortium selected to build the line for a construction schedule, Metrolinx delayed completion of the line to 2023.

They refer to their style often as \\"Rotterdoom\\". It is largely inspired by bands like My Dying Bride and early Anathema, but the last album is slower and more melodic. The vocals are mostly intelligible death grunts but with occasional clean vocals. Their home-venue is Baroeg in Rotterdam. History The roots of Officium Triste go back to the early 1990s when Martin and Johan decided to form a metal band. The name of this band was Re√Øncremated. In the spring of 1994, the last line-up of this band decided to quit and reform under a new moniker with a different musical approach. The new moniker became Officium Triste. Musically, they started to compose heavy and melodic doom metal. The start of Officium Triste went pretty smooth and new songs were composed quickly. This resulted in the decision to record a demo, which was recorded at the Elektra in Sliedrecht on the 4th and 5 August 1994. The recordings were low-budget and made using a 4-track recorder. This recording session resulted in the Demo '94 which included three songs and an intro. The reactions from the underground scene were positive and eventually, all 200 copies were sold out. The music on this demo resulted in a deal with a label called Fuck You Records for a 7\\" EP. Officium Triste entered the Excess studio in Rotterdam on 19 and 20 February 1995 to record two new songs and an intro. Due to supposed lack of money the label did nothing. After a delay of a year, the band decided to release the EP by themselves. Vocalist Pim started Weeping Willow Records and released the EP Mountains Of Depressiveness pressed on red vinyl limited to 500 copies in the summer of 1996. In the meantime, during the summer of 1995, bass player Maarten quit the band and was replaced by Johan. Although the recordings were over a year old by the time they were released, the reactions within the scene were very good. This resulted in a deal with Dutch underground label Teutonic Existence Records for an album. The band entered Excess studio again to record the CD in December 1996. They recorded five new songs and re-recorded two songs from the demo and one from the EP in slightly different versions. In February 1997, the recording sessions were finished. The album Ne Vivam was released late April of the same year. Additionally, one track was delivered for an all-Dutch compilation CD to be released by Moonlight Records from Germany. This compilation was supposed to hit the scene early 1996 featuring bands like Orphanage, Callenish Circle and Asra√Ø amongst others, but nothing has happened yet and it seems this compilation will never see the light of day. Officium Triste also got more gigs that went very well. The absolute highlight to date has to be the support for Anathema at the Noorderligt venue in Tilburg, the Netherlands in May 1997. The next recordings Officium Triste made were three new tracks (again using Excess studio) for a split MiniCD release with Cold Mourning from Monterey, California, United States. This MCD was also released through Weeping Willow Records, containing two songs by each band. Officium Triste were also featured on a compilation CD released by Innocent Record Productions from the Netherlands. The track featured was \\"Dreams Of Sorrow\\" of the Ne Vivam album. This compilation did not receive much attention. In September 1998, some irritation between the band members led to the decision to disband. They played a successful goodbye- gig, again supporting Anathema, in their hometown Rotterdam at Baroeg. They also decided to release one more CD-single. This CD contained 'left-overs' from the last two recording sessions: \\"Roses on my Grave\\" was recorded at the same time as the songs for the split-MCD and had never before been released and \\"Headstone\\" was a cover song from the English band Chorus of Ruin, recorded during the Ne Vivam session. In the meantime Martin, Johan and Pim decided to continue and created a new band, XI:LIX (also known as Eleven Fiftynine or 11:59). A new guitarist, also named Johan, was recruited and they started working on new songs. After seven months the former members of Officium Triste decided to meet in the pub to have a drink for old-times sake and decided to reform the band. Johan the new guitarist was also taken in the line-up, leading to a line-up featuring 3 guitarists. In January 2000, Officium Triste recorded two new songs, \\"Pathway of Broken Glass\\" and \\"Divinity\\" for a promo. The song \\"Roses on my Grave\\" was also included. This promo was sent to labels for a possible deal. During April 2000, 'new man' Johan wanted to quit due to lack of time. July 2000, the band let bass-player Johan go. He was replaced by Lawrence who used to play guitar in Death Sentence and drums in Liar of Golgotha. The release of the promo lead to a two-album deal with Displeased Records from the Netherlands. The band entered Valvesound studios in Schiedam, the Netherlands in April 2001 to record a second full-length album. In 10 days it was recorded and mixed. The album was called The Pathway and contains seven songs. Meanwhile, the band did some live performances with the new line-up. In October 2001 the album The Pathway was released as well as a re-issue of the self-financed \\"Goodbye\\" MiniCD Roses on my Grave a limited 7\\" EP with a slightly different cover. After the release of The Pathway, Officium Triste did a number of gigs of which the support slot for Candlemass in 013 Tilburg and the appearance on the Doom Shall Rise festival were highlights in the history of Officium Triste. The band also started working on new material for their third opus and decided to record the next album in their own studio ‚ÄúEl Pato‚Äù run by guitarist Johan. The band recorded a demo consisting of one song and Displeased gave green light to record the next album at ‚ÄúEl Pato‚Äù. During December 2003 and March 2004 they recorded the five-track album Reason. A lot of shows were done to promote this album directly after the release. In 2005, the band re-released a CD version of the debut album ‚ÄúNe Vivam‚Äù through Russia's Serpent's Lair Productions. This album already was re-released on vinyl in 2003 on Badger Records. At this time the band also started to think about their next re-lease since they once again signed a deal for two albums with Displeased Records. At the end of 2006 Officium Triste felt they were ready to record their fourth album and booked the Excess Studio in Rotterdam. In the first week of January 2007 most parts of the album were recorded and in February the guitar parts were recorded at the band's own El Pato studio. In May the album called ‚ÄúGiving Yourself Away‚Äù featuring six new songs was released. At the same time guitarist Johan decided to leave the band after 13 years. His replacement is Bram Bijlhout, former guitarist/ vocalist for the Dutch band Imbolc.

Hornak, Encyclopedia of Imaging Science and Technology (John Wiley & Sons, 2002) including imaging things that the human eye cannot detect. As an evolving field it includes research and researchers from physics, mathematics, electrical engineering, computer vision, computer science, and perceptual psychology. Imaging chain The foundation of imaging science as a discipline is the \\"imaging chain\\" ‚Äì a conceptual model describing all of the factors which must be considered when developing a system for creating visual renderings (images). In general, the links of the imaging chain include: # The human visual system. Designers must also consider the psychophysical processes which take place in human beings as they make sense of information received through the visual system. # The subject of the image. When developing an imaging system, designers must consider the observables associated with the subjects which will be imaged. These observables generally take the form of emitted or reflected energy, such as electromagnetic energy or mechanical energy. # The capture device. Once the observables associated with the subject are characterized, designers can then identify and integrate the technologies needed to capture those observables. For example, in the case of consumer digital cameras, those technologies include optics for collecting energy in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, and electronic detectors for converting the electromagnetic energy into an electronic signal. # The processor. For all digital imaging systems, the electronic signals produced by the capture device must be manipulated by an algorithm which formats the signals so they can be displayed as an image. In practice, there are often multiple processors involved in the creation of a digital image. # The display. The display takes the electronic signals which have been manipulated by the processor and renders them on some visual medium. Examples include paper (for printed, or \\"hard copy\\" images), television, computer monitor, or projector. Note that some imaging scientists will include additional \\"links\\" in their description of the imaging chain. For example, some will include the \\"source\\" of the energy which \\"illuminates\\" or interacts with the subject of the image. Others will include storage and/or transmission systems. Subfields within imaging science include: image processing, computer vision, 3D computer graphics, animations, atmospheric optics, astronomical imaging, digital image restoration, digital imaging, color science, digital photography, holography, magnetic resonance imaging, medical imaging, microdensitometry, optics, photography, remote sensing, radar imaging, radiometry, silver halide, ultrasound imaging, photoacoustic imaging, thermal imaging, visual perception, and various printing technologies.

The river begins northeast of the hamlet of Millers Mills and flows generally south to the village of Sidney, where it converges with the Susquehanna River, which drains into the Chesapeake Bay, a bay of the Atlantic Ocean. Most of the length of the Unadilla forms the western border of Otsego County and the eastern borders of Chenango and Madison counties, all in New York. This border made up a significant portion of the Fort Stanwix Treaty Line of 1768. It was meant to establish the border for an Indian reserve, beyond which European-American settlers were not supposed to go. Settlers resented British efforts to control their movements, and continued to encroach on Native American territories. Branches The Unadilla has two branches which join at Unadilla Forks on the Otsego-Madison County border. *The main branch of the Unadilla, referred to as the Unadilla River, starts northeast of the hamlet of Millers Mills in southwestern Herkimer County. *The West Branch Unadilla River starts a few miles north of Bridgewater in southeast Oneida County. This branch was known as Eghwagy Creek during the early 18th century. Tributaries The Unadilla's tributaries, from north to south, include: * Campbell Brook: from the east, near the Skaneateles Turnpike north of Leonardsville *Button Creek: from the west, between Leonardsville and West Edmeston * Beaver Creek: from the west, between South Brookfield and Columbus Quarter * Tallette Creek: from the west, near Columbus Quarter *Center Brook: from the west, at New Berlin *Wharton Creek: from the east, at New Berlin *Butternut Creek: from the east, near Mount Upton *Guilford Creek: from the west, north of Sidney Alternate names and spellings Unadilla has had various spellings and alternate names, particularly in the 18th century:History of Chenango County, Ch. 7 *Che-on-a-dill-ha: Oneida dialect *Teyonadelhouogh: Gideon Hawley, Journey to Broome County, Oquaga (Onaheghgwage), 1753 *Tiona-derha: Guy Johnson's 1768 map *Tienaderha: Guy Johnson's 1771 map and Southeir's 1779 map *Tianaderaha: Surveyor-General, Simeon De Witt's map c.1790 *Tianaderha: Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768 *Tunadilla: Common spelling 18th century correspondence *Susquehannock: Vaughan's 18th century Chorographical Map See also *List of New York rivers References *History of Chenango County, Ch. 7. *Francis W.

Possible location of Edmestons' expansion into the 20 Townships west of the Unadilla, c. 1792 General William Edmeston (died 1804) was a British Army officer who owned an estate in New York State. As a captain in the 48th Regiment of Foot, he was posted to North America in 1755 with his brother, Lieutenant Robert Edmeston, to fight in the French and Indian War. In 1763, by royal proclamation, the brothers were each awarded 5,000 acres (20 km¬≤) of land in the colonies for their military service. They attempted to establish their claims in what was then a disputed part of the New Hampshire Grants, now Vermont. However, in 1770 they decided to locate on the east bank of the Unadilla River in New York State just west of George Croghan's Otsego patent, in what is now the Town of Edmeston in Otsego County. They established their homes on the land, which became known as the Mount Edmeston Tracts. The transactions were facilitated by Percifer Carr, who had been a sergeant in the 48th with Edmeston and when the Edmeston brothers later returned to England, Carr would be employed as caretaker of their land. When the American War of Independence broke out in 1775 Edmonston was arrested by the Americans and sent to Boston to be exchanged, after which he became Lieutenant-Colonel of the 48th Foot. He was captured by a French privateer in 1779, but he made his way to England the following year and spent the remainder of the war serving in Europe as a lieutenant-colonel, first with the 48th Foot but from 1782 to 1783 with the 50th Foot. Between 1793 and 1796 he was the Colonel of the short-lived 95th Regiment of Foot and in 1802 he was appointed Colonel of the 1st Royal Veteran Battalion. He was promoted full general in 1803. He died the following year and was buried at Hanwell, Middlesex on 3 July 1804. References *James H.

History Although the membership is restricted and exclusive, by 2000 there were over two hundred members, who meet bi-annually in Rome. The association sends out a quarterly newsletter where members can tell of particularly interesting or difficult cases. An exorcist priest must have the permission of his bishop to join the group. Within the Roman Catholic Church a priest may only perform an exorcism with the express consent of his bishop or local ordinary,\\"Can. 1172\\", \\"Code of Canon Law\\" and only, to the extent necessary, after an examination of the patient by doctors and psychiatrists in order to determine that the affliction has no natural origin. A priest is required by canon law to be devout, knowledgeable, prudent, and respected for his integrity. Father Amorth began the organization in the hopes of increasing the number of official exorcists worldwide and to alert more dioceses about the problem, which he believed had been ignored or suppressed by some priests and bishops. During his lifetime, Father Amorth was the honorary president of AIE. His successor as president was Father Giancarlo Gramolazzo, who died in November 2010 and was succeeded in turn by Capuchin father Cipriano de Meo (born January 5, 1924), and then by Fr. Francesco Bamonte, the current president. References  External links  * Mexicans confront Satanism with National Meeting of Exorcists * \\"An Evening with an Exorcist,\\" a talk given by Fr.

It is said to have been revealed during the Quraysh Conflict with Muhammad in answer a challenge over the distinguishing attributes of the GOD Mohammed invited them to worship.George Sale's footnotes to Quran 113, AlKoran Al-Ikhlas is not merely the name of this surah but also the title of its contents, for it deals exclusively with Tawhid. The other surahs of the Quran generally have been designated after a word occurring in them, but in this surah the word Ikhlas has occurred nowhere. It has been given this name in view of its meaning and subject matter.

Welch, art. ‚Äòal-·∏≤ur‚ÄôƒÅn‚Äô in Encyclopaedia of Islam, 2nd edn. On early development of sura headings see Adam Gacek, Arabic Manuscripts: A Vademecum For Readers, Handbook of Oriental Studies (Leiden/Boston: Brill, 2009), pp. 219‚Äì20. This surah was among those to receive many different titles. It is a short declaration of tawhid, Allah's absolute oneness, consisting of four ayat. Al-Ikhlas means \\"the purity\\" or \\"the refining\\". It is disputed whether this is a Meccan or Medinan sura. The former seems more probable, particularly since it seems to have been alluded to by Bilal of Abyssinia, who, when he was being tortured by his cruel master, is said to have repeated \\"Ahad, Ahad!\\" (unique, referring as here to God). It is reported from Ubayy ibn Ka'b that it was revealed after the polytheists asked \\"O Muhammad! Tell us the lineage of your Lord.\\" Q112:1-2 none comparable to God Surah Al-Ikhlas contains four verses: 112:1. Say: He is Allah, One. 112:2. Allah As-Samad. 112:3. He begets not, nor was He begotten. 112:4. And there is none comparable to Him. About this, Tafsir Ibn Kathir says: This word (Al-Ahad) cannot be used for anyone in affirmation except Allah the Mighty and Majestic, because He is perfect in all of His attributes and actions. Hadith Al-Ikhlas in Maghribi script, 18th Century. According to hadiths, this surah is an especially important and honored part of the Quran: * Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: A man heard another man reciting (in the prayers): 'Say (O Muhammad): \\"He is Allah, the One.\\" (112.1) And he recited it repeatedly. When it was morning, he went to the Prophet and informed him about that as if he considered that the recitation of that Sura by itself was not enough. Allah's Apostle said, \\"By Him in Whose Hand my life is, it is equal to one-third of the Quran.\\"Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 93: Oneness, Uniqueness of Allah (Tawheed) Volume 9, Number 471 http://www.islamicity.com/mosque/sunnah/bukhari/093.sbt.html * Narrated Yahya related to me from Malik from Ibn Shihab that Humayd ibn Abd ar-Rahman ibn Awf had told him that Surat al-Ikhlas (Surah 112) was equal to a third of the Qur'an, and that Surat al-Mulk (Surah 67) pleaded for its owner.Imam Malik's Muwatta Chapter No: 15, The Quran Hadith no: 19 * Narrated 'Aisha: The Prophet sent (an army unit) under the command of a man who used to lead his companions in the prayers and would finish his recitation with (the Sura 112): 'Say (O Muhammad): \\"He is Allah, the One.\\" ' (112.1) When they returned (from the battle), they mentioned that to the Prophet. He said (to them), \\"Ask him why he does so.\\" They asked him and he said, \\"I do so because it mentions the qualities of the Beneficent and I love to recite it (in my prayer).\\" The Prophet; said (to them), \\"Tell him that Allah loves him\\"Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 93: Oneness, Uniqueness of Allah (Tawheed) Volume 9, Number 472 * Imam Malik bin Anas recorded from Ubayd bin Hunayn that he heard Abu Hurayrah saying, \\"I went out with the Prophet and he heard a man reciting \`Say: He is Allah, the One.' So the Messenger of Allah said, (It is obligatory). I asked, \`What is obligatory' He replied, \\"Paradise.\\" * Narrated by Abu Said, the Prophet said to his companions, \\"Is it difficult for any of you to recite one third of the Qur'an in one night?\\" This suggestion was difficult for them so they said, \\"Who among us has the power to do so, O Allah's Apostle?\\" Allah Apostle replied: \\" Allah (the) One, the Self- Sufficient Master Whom all creatures need.'

So they asked him and he said, \\"Because it is the description of Ar-Rahman and I love to recite it.

The town would have been a vital part of the road infrastructure of Roman Britain. The Fortified town would provide a safe, warm resting place where provisions for the journey could be purchased and horses and other livestock could be safely stabled overnight. The town would also provide some protection for the wider population in the vicinity in times of danger. In close proximity of the town there are several other Roman sites which are connected with Bannaventa. These include the remains of a villa on the summit of nearby Borough Hill,Borough Hill (Daventry) and its History by William Edgar, Page 39 ASIN: B001075ZNY another smaller settlement between Thrupp lodge and Thrupp Grounds (SP 599651)An Inventory of Archaeological Sites in North West Northamptonshire, Page 154, Fig 118. and various other small homesteads have been located at grid references SP613638, SP608649 and another Roman villa at SP605649.An Inventory of Archaeological Sites in North West Northamptonshire, Page 153, Fig 116. Rediscovery It was not until the early 18th century that the site of Bannaventa was positively identified. Previously, sites at nearby Weedon Bec, Daventry-Borough Hill and even Northampton had been suggested.Borough Hill (Daventry) and its History by William Edgar, Page 54, Discussion on the Location. ASIN: B001075ZNY There have been many archaeological finds across the site including the discovery of a skeleton and numerous cremations in a Roman burial ground a little south of the boundary of the fortifications. Other discoveries include Constantinian coins, some foundations, stonework, and pottery; most were found in the early 18th century and they led to the definitive location of the town.An Inventory of Archaeological Sites in North West Northamptonshire, Page 150 . More finds in the 20th century have been discovered and are listed below: View from the North West corner of Bannaventa *A number of rubbish pits dating from the 1st and 2nd century *In 1900, Roman coins of Victorinus and Samian ware, remnants of buildings including wall plaster, rotten wood, roof slates, and a cobbled floor. * In 1922 Roman coins including a Sestertius of Hadrian. * In 1957 a Large Nene Valley beaker, large painted pot, part of a glass bowl. Fragments of a black Samian pot plus many other artifacts. In 1970 the site was photographed from the air. This revealed the position of Roman Watling Street as it bisected the town, and the outline of the town lying to the west of the A5.1970 Air Photographs taken by J.K.S. St Joseph, Cambridge University Air Photographs The settlement was enclosed by an irregular quadrilateral shape with broad rounded corners, bounded by a series of three sets of banks and ditches. The enclosed area covered some 13.5 acres (55,000 m¬≤). Inside the enclosure evidence has been found of the wooden buildings which made up most of the town. Current status Nothing obviously Roman now remains above ground and has no public access, and is privately owned and farmed as an arable field. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Possible Saint Patrick's birthplace Saint Patrick, patron saint of Ireland, tells us in his Confession that he had been born in a settlement called Bannavem Taburniae.Confessio of St Patrick. The location is unknown, but the first part of the name can probably be read as Bannaventa. This led at least one local historian to guess that Patrick was born at the Roman town described above.Borough Hill (Daventry) and its History by William Edgar, Page 57 However an early Life of Patrick describes his birthplace as \\"near the western sea\\", as indeed we should expect, as he was carried into slavery in Ireland by Irish raiders. The name of Patrick's birthplace incorporated some such word as \\"Taburniae\\", probably to distinguish it from the Bannaventa now in Northamptonshire.A. L. F.

The provincial Social Credit movement was divided in its early years and was largely under the influence of the Alberta Social Credit League and did not have a functional leadership before 1952. The 1952 leadership convention was held when the party was largely dominated by the Alberta leadership of the national social credit movement. Alberta Premier Ernest Manning hand-picked Ernest George Hansell to lead the British Columbia party into the election despite the fact that Hansell was an Alberta politician. W.A.C. Bennett was chosen party leader by Social Credit MLAs following the election. In 1973, the party elected W.A.C. Bennett's son, Bill Bennett, on the first ballot. All of the party's leadership conventions before 1993 were delegated, i.e., local party riding associations selected delegates to attend a convention and elect a leader by secret ballot. The 1993 leadership election was determined by a \\"one-member, one-vote\\" system, using mail-in preferential ballots. The 1994 leadership election used the same system, but did not incorporate preferential balloting as there were only two candidates. 1952 leadership convention Held April 27, 1952 *Reverend Ernest George Hansell acclaimed *W.A.C. Bennett (declined nomination) *Lyle Wicks (declined nomination) At this time the Alberta Social Credit League still dominated the British Columbia association. Hansell, an Alberta Social Credit Member of Parliament, was the hand-picked candidate of Alberta Premier Ernest Manning. Bennett and Wicks were both nominated from the floor, however, but declined allowing Hansell to be acclaimed. Following the general election in which Social Credit unexpectedly emerged as the largest party, Wicks, who was the British Columbia party's president, called a new leadership vote at which only elected Social Credit MLAs could vote. In this contest, held on July 15, 1952, Bennett defeated Philip Gaglardi by a margin of 10 to 9 to become Social Credit leader and was invited by the lieutenant- governor to become Premier of the province. 1973 leadership convention (Held on November 24, 1973.)

The basic concept behind these algorithms is the divide-and-conquer approach from computer science. An eigenvalue problem is divided into two problems of roughly half the size, each of these are solved recursively, and the eigenvalues of the original problem are computed from the results of these smaller problems. Here we present the simplest version of a divide-and-conquer algorithm, similar to the one originally proposed by Cuppen in 1981. Many details that lie outside the scope of this article will be omitted; however, without considering these details, the algorithm is not fully stable. Background As with most eigenvalue algorithms for Hermitian matrices, divide-and-conquer begins with a reduction to tridiagonal form. For an m \\\\times m matrix, the standard method for this, via Householder reflections, takes \\\\frac{4}{3}m^{3} flops, or \\\\frac{8}{3}m^{3} if eigenvectors are needed as well. There are other algorithms, such as the Arnoldi iteration, which may do better for certain classes of matrices; we will not consider this further here. In certain cases, it is possible to deflate an eigenvalue problem into smaller problems. Consider a block diagonal matrix :T = \\\\begin{bmatrix} T_{1} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & T_{2}\\\\end{bmatrix}. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of T are simply those of T_{1} and T_{2}, and it will almost always be faster to solve these two smaller problems than to solve the original problem all at once. This technique can be used to improve the efficiency of many eigenvalue algorithms, but it has special significance to divide-and-conquer. For the rest of this article, we will assume the input to the divide-and-conquer algorithm is an m \\\\times m real symmetric tridiagonal matrix T. Although the algorithm can be modified for Hermitian matrices, we do not give the details here. Divide The divide part of the divide-and- conquer algorithm comes from the realization that a tridiagonal matrix is \\"almost\\" block diagonal. :Image:Almost block diagonal.png The size of submatrix T_{1} we will call n \\\\times n, and then T_{2} is (m - n) \\\\times (m - n). Note that the remark about T being almost block diagonal is true regardless of how n is chosen (i.e., there are many ways to so decompose the matrix). However, it makes sense, from an efficiency standpoint, to choose n \\\\approx m/2. We write T as a block diagonal matrix, plus a rank-1 correction: :Image:Block diagonal plus correction.png The only difference between T_{1} and \\\\hat{T}_{1} is that the lower right entry t_{nn} in \\\\hat{T}_{1} has been replaced with t_{nn} - \\\\beta and similarly, in \\\\hat{T}_{2} the top left entry t_{n+1,n+1} has been replaced with t_{n+1,n+1} - \\\\beta. The remainder of the divide step is to solve for the eigenvalues (and if desired the eigenvectors) of \\\\hat{T}_{1} and \\\\hat{T}_{2}, that is to find the diagonalizations \\\\hat{T}_{1} = Q_{1} D_{1} Q_{1}^{T} and \\\\hat{T}_{2} = Q_{2} D_{2} Q_{2}^{T}. This can be accomplished with recursive calls to the divide-and-conquer algorithm, although practical implementations often switch to the QR algorithm for small enough submatrices. Conquer The conquer part of the algorithm is the unintuitive part. Given the diagonalizations of the submatrices, calculated above, how do we find the diagonalization of the original matrix? First, define z^{T} = (q_{1}^{T},q_{2}^{T}), where q_{1}^{T} is the last row of Q_{1} and q_{2}^{T} is the first row of Q_{2}. It is now elementary to show that :T = \\\\begin{bmatrix} Q_{1} & \\\\\\\\\\\\ & Q_{2} \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\left( \\\\begin{bmatrix} D_{1} & \\\\\\\\\\\\ & D_{2} \\\\end{bmatrix} + \\\\beta z z^{T} \\\\right) \\\\begin{bmatrix} Q_{1}^{T} & \\\\\\\\\\\\ & Q_{2}^{T} \\\\end{bmatrix} The remaining task has been reduced to finding the eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix plus a rank- one correction. Before showing how to do this, let us simplify the notation. We are looking for the eigenvalues of the matrix D + w w^{T}, where D is diagonal with distinct entries and w is any vector with nonzero entries. If wi is zero, (e_i,di) is an eigenpair of D + w w^{T} since (D + w w^{T})e_i = De_i = d_i e_i. If \\\\lambda is an eigenvalue, we have: :(D + w w^{T})q = \\\\lambda q where q is the corresponding eigenvector. Now :(D - \\\\lambda I)q + w(w^{T}q) = 0 :q + (D - \\\\lambda I)^{-1} w(w^{T}q) = 0 :w^{T}q + w^{T}(D - \\\\lambda I)^{-1} w(w^{T}q) = 0 Keep in mind that w^{T}q is a nonzero scalar. Neither w nor q are zero. If w^{T}q were to be zero, q would be an eigenvector of D by (D + w w^{T})q = \\\\lambda q. If that were the case, q would contain only one nonzero position since D is distinct diagonal and thus the inner product w^{T}q can not be zero after all. Therefore, we have: :1 + w^{T}(D - \\\\lambda I)^{-1} w = 0 or written as a scalar equation, :1 + \\\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\\\frac{w_{j}^{2}}{d_{j} - \\\\lambda} = 0. This equation is known as the secular equation. The problem has therefore been reduced to finding the roots of the rational function defined by the left-hand side of this equation. All general eigenvalue algorithms must be iterative, and the divide-and-conquer algorithm is no different. Solving the nonlinear secular equation requires an iterative technique, such as the Newton‚ÄìRaphson method. However, each root can be found in O(1) iterations, each of which requires \\\\Theta(m) flops (for an m-degree rational function), making the cost of the iterative part of this algorithm \\\\Theta(m^{2}). Analysis As is common for divide and conquer algorithms, we will use the master theorem for divide-and-conquer recurrences to analyze the running time. Remember that above we stated we choose n \\\\approx m/2. We can write the recurrence relation: :T(m) = 2 \\\\times T\\\\left(\\\\frac{m}{2}\\\\right) + \\\\Theta(m^{2}) In the notation of the Master theorem, a = b = 2 and thus \\\\log_{b} a = 1. Clearly, \\\\Theta(m^{2}) = \\\\Omega(m^{1}), so we have :T(m) = \\\\Theta(m^{2}) Remember that above we pointed out that reducing a Hermitian matrix to tridiagonal form takes \\\\frac{4}{3}m^{3} flops. This dwarfs the running time of the divide-and-conquer part, and at this point it is not clear what advantage the divide-and-conquer algorithm offers over the QR algorithm (which also takes \\\\Theta(m^{2}) flops for tridiagonal matrices). The advantage of divide-and-conquer comes when eigenvectors are needed as well. If this is the case, reduction to tridiagonal form takes \\\\frac{8}{3}m^{3}, but the second part of the algorithm takes \\\\Theta(m^{3}) as well. For the QR algorithm with a reasonable target precision, this is \\\\approx 6 m^{3}, whereas for divide-and- conquer it is \\\\approx \\\\frac{4}{3}m^{3}. The reason for this improvement is that in divide-and-conquer, the \\\\Theta(m^{3}) part of the algorithm (multiplying Q matrices) is separate from the iteration, whereas in QR, this must occur in every iterative step. Adding the \\\\frac{8}{3}m^{3} flops for the reduction, the total improvement is from \\\\approx 9 m^{3} to \\\\approx 4 m^{3} flops. Practical use of the divide-and-conquer algorithm has shown that in most realistic eigenvalue problems, the algorithm actually does better than this. The reason is that very often the matrices Q and the vectors z tend to be numerically sparse, meaning that they have many entries with values smaller than the floating point precision, allowing for numerical deflation, i.e. breaking the problem into uncoupled subproblems. Variants and implementation The algorithm presented here is the simplest version. In many practical implementations, more complicated rank-1 corrections are used to guarantee stability; some variants even use rank-2 corrections. There exist specialized root-finding techniques for rational functions that may do better than the Newton-Raphson method in terms of both performance and stability. These can be used to improve the iterative part of the divide-and-conquer algorithm. The divide-and-conquer algorithm is readily parallelized, and linear algebra computing packages such as LAPACK contain high-quality parallel implementations.

UHV conditions are created by pumping the gas out of a UHV chamber. At these low pressures the mean free path of a gas molecule is greater than approximately 40 km, so the gas is in free molecular flow, and gas molecules will collide with the chamber walls many times before colliding with each other. Almost all molecular interactions therefore take place on various surfaces in the chamber. UHV conditions are integral to scientific research. Surface science experiments often require a chemically clean sample surface with the absence of any unwanted adsorbates. Surface analysis tools such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and low energy ion scattering require UHV conditions for the transmission of electron or ion beams. For the same reason, beam pipes in particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider are kept at UHV.  Overview  Maintaining UHV conditions requires the use of unusual materials for equipment. Useful concepts for UHV include: * Sorption of gases * Kinetic theory of gases * Gas transport and pumping * Vacuum pumps and systems * Vapour pressure Typically, UHV requires: *High pumping speed -- possibly multiple vacuum pumps in series and/or parallel *Minimized surface area in the chamber *High conductance tubing to pumps -- short and fat, without obstruction *Use of low-outgassing materials such as certain stainless steels *Avoid creating pits of trapped gas behind bolts, welding voids, etc. *Electropolishing of all metal parts after machining or welding *Use of low vapor pressure materials (ceramics, glass, metals, teflon if unbaked) *Baking of the system to remove water or hydrocarbons adsorbed to the walls *Chilling of chamber walls to cryogenic temperatures during use *Avoiding all traces of hydrocarbons, including skin oils in a fingerprint -- always use gloves Hydrogen and carbon monoxide are the most common background gases in a well- designed, well-baked UHV system. Both Hydrogen and CO diffuse out from the grain boundaries in stainless steel. Helium could diffuse through the steel and glass from the outside air, but this effect is usually negligible due to the low abundance of He in the atmosphere. Measurement Pressure Measurement of high vacuum is done using a nonabsolute gauge that measures a pressure-related property of the vacuum, for example, its thermal conductivity. See, for example, Pacey. These gauges must be calibrated. The gauges capable of measuring the lowest pressures are magnetic gauges based upon the pressure dependence of the current in a spontaneous gas discharge in intersecting electric and magnetic fields. UHV pressures are measured with an ion gauge, either of the hot filament or inverted magnetron type. Leak rate In any vacuum system, some gas will continue to escape into the chamber over time and slowly increase the pressure if it is not pumped out. This leak rate is usually measured in mbar L/s or torr L/s. While some gas release is inevitable, if the leak rate is too high, it can slow down or even prevent the system from reaching low pressure. There are a variety of possible reasons for an increase in pressure. These include simple air leaks, virtual leaks, and desorption (either from surfaces or volume). A variety of methods for leak detection exist. Large leaks can be found by pressurizing the chamber, and looking for bubbles in soapy water, while tiny leaks can require more sensitive methods, up to using a tracer gas and specialized Helium mass spectrometer. Outgassing Outgassing is a problem for UHV systems. Outgassing can occur from two sources: surfaces and bulk materials. Outgassing from bulk materials is minimized by selection of materials with low vapor pressures (such as glass, stainless steel, and ceramics) for everything inside the system. Materials which are not generally considered absorbent can outgas, including most plastics and some metals. For example, vessels lined with a highly gas-permeable material such as palladium (which is a high-capacity hydrogen sponge) create special outgassing problems. Outgassing from surfaces is a subtler problem. At extremely low pressures, more gas molecules are adsorbed on the walls than are floating in the chamber, so the total surface area inside a chamber is more important than its volume for reaching UHV. Water is a significant source of outgassing because a thin layer of water vapor rapidly adsorbs to everything whenever the chamber is opened to air. Water evaporates from surfaces too slowly to be fully removed at room temperature, but just fast enough to present a continuous level of background contamination. Removal of water and similar gases generally requires baking the UHV system at 200 to 400 ¬∞C while vacuum pumps are running. During chamber use, the walls of the chamber may be chilled using liquid nitrogen to reduce outgassing further. Bake-out In order to reach low pressures, is often useful to heat the entire system above 100 ¬∞C for many hours (a process known as bake-out) to remove water and other trace gases which adsorb on the surfaces of the chamber. This may also be required upon \\"cycling\\" the equipment to atmosphere. This process significantly speeds up the process of outgassing, allowing low pressures to be reached much faster. System design Pumping There is no single vacuum pump that can operate all the way from atmospheric pressure to ultra-high vacuum. Instead, a series of different pumps is used, according to the appropriate pressure range for each pump. In the first stage, a roughing pump clears most of the gas from the chamber. This is followed by one or more vacuum pumps that operate at low pressures. Pumps commonly used in this second stage to achieve UHV include: *Turbomolecular pumps (especially compound pumps which incorporate a molecular drag section and/or magnetic bearing types) *Ion pumps *Titanium sublimation pumps *Non-evaporable getter (NEG) pumps *Cryopumps *Diffusion pumps, especially when used with a cryogenic trap designed to minimize backstreaming of pump oil into the systems. Turbo pumps and diffusion pumps rely on supersonic attack upon system molecules by the blades and high speed vapor stream, respectively. Airlocks To save time, energy, and integrity of the UHV volume an airlock is often used. The airlock volume has one door or valve facing the UHV side of the volume, and another door against atmospheric pressure through which samples or workpieces are initially introduced. After sample introduction and assuring that the door against atmosphere is closed, the airlock volume is typically pumped down to a medium-high vacuum. In some cases the workpiece itself is baked out or otherwise pre-cleaned under this medium-high vacuum. The gateway to the UHV chamber is then opened, the workpiece transferred to the UHV by robotic means or by other contrivance if necessary, and the UHV valve re-closed. While the initial workpiece is being processed under UHV, a subsequent sample can be introduced into the airlock volume, pre-cleaned, and so-on and so-forth, saving much time. Although a \\"puff\\" of gas is generally released into the UHV system when the valve to the airlock volume is opened, the UHV system pumps can generally snatch this gas away before it has time to adsorb onto the UHV surfaces. In a system well designed with suitable airlocks, the UHV components seldom need bakeout and the UHV may improve over time even as workpieces are introduced and removed. Seals Metal seals, with knife edges on both sides cutting into a soft, copper gasket are employed. This metal-to-metal seal can maintain pressures down to 100 pPa (~10‚àí12 Torr). Although generally considered single use, the skilled operator can obtain several uses through the use of feeler gauges of decreasing size with each iteration, as long as the knife edges are in perfect condition. Material limitations Many common materials are used sparingly if at all due to high vapor pressure, high adsorptivity or absorptivity resulting in subsequent troublesome outgassing, or high permeability in the face of differential pressure (i.e.: \\"through-gassing\\"): * The majority of organic compounds cannot be used: **Plastics, other than PTFE and PEEK: plastics in other uses are replaced with ceramics or metals. Limited use of fluoroelastomers (such as Viton) and perfluoroelastomers (such as Kalrez) as gasket materials can be considered if metal gaskets are inconvenient, though these polymers can be expensive. Although through-gassing of elastomerics can not be avoided, experiments have shown that slow out-gassing of water vapor is, initially at least, the more important limitation. This effect can be minimized by pre-baking under medium vacuum. ** Glues: special glues for high vacuum must be used, generally epoxies with a high mineral filler content. Among the most popular of these include asbestos in the formulation. This allows for an epoxy with good initial properties and able to retain reasonable performance across multiple bake-outs. * Some steels: due to oxidization of carbon steel, which greatly increases adsorption area, only stainless steel is used. Particularly, non-leaded and low-sulfur austenitic grades such as 304 and 316 are preferred. These steels include at least 18% chromium and 8% nickel. Variants of stainless steel include low-carbon grades (such as 304L and 316L), and grades with additives such as niobium and molybdenum to reduce the formation of chromium carbide (which provides no corrosion resistance). Common designations include 316L (low carbon), and 316LN (low carbon with nitrogen). Chromium carbide precipitation at the grain boundaries can render a stainless steel less resistant to oxidation. * Lead: Soldering is performed using lead-free solder. Occasionally pure lead is used as a gasket material between flat surfaces in lieu of a copper/knife edge system. * Indium: Indium is sometimes used as a deformable gasket material for vacuum seals, especially in cryogenic apparatus, but its low melting point prevents use in baked systems. In a more esoteric application, the low melting point of Indium is taken advantage of as a renewable seal in high vacuum valves. These valves are used several times, generally with the aid of a torque wrench set to increasing torque with each iteration. When the indium seal is exhausted, it is melted and reforms itself and thus is ready for another round of uses. * Zinc, cadmium: High vapor pressures during system bake-out virtually preclude their use. *Aluminum: Although aluminum itself has a vapor pressure which makes it unsuitable for use in UHV systems, the same oxides which protect aluminum against corrosion improve its characteristics under UHV. Although initial experiments with aluminum suggested milling under mineral oil to maintain a thin, consistent layer of oxide, it has become increasingly accepted that aluminum is a suitable UHV material without special preparation. Paradoxically, aluminum oxide, especially when embedded as particles in stainless steel as for example from sanding in an attempt to reduce the surface area of the steel, is considered a problematic contaminant. * Cleaning is very important for UHV. Common cleaning procedures include degreasing with detergents, organic solvents, or chlorinated hydrocarbons. Electropolishing is often used to reduce the surface area from which adsorbed gases can be emitted. Etching of stainless steel using hydrofluoric and nitric acid forms a chromium rich surface, followed by a nitric acid passivation step, which forms a chromium oxide rich surface. This surface retards the diffusion of hydrogen into the chamber. Technical limitations: * Screws: Threads have a high surface area and tend to \\"trap\\" gases, and therefore, are avoided. Blind holes are especially avoided, due to the trapped gas at the base of the screw and slow venting through the threads, which is commonly known as a \\"virtual leak\\". This can be mitigated by designing components to include through-holes for all threaded connections, or by using vented screws (which have a hole drilled through their central axis or a notch along the threads). Vented Screws allow trapped gases to flow freely from the base of the screw, eliminating virtual leaks and speeding up the pump-down process. * Welding: Processes such as gas metal arc welding and shielded metal arc welding cannot be used, due to the deposition of impure material and potential introduction of voids or porosity. Gas tungsten arc welding (with an appropriate heat profile and properly selected filler material) is necessary. Other clean processes, such as electron beam welding or laser beam welding, are also acceptable; however, those that involve potential slag inclusions (such as submerged arc welding and flux-cored arc welding) are obviously not. To avoid trapping gas or high vapor pressure molecules, welds must fully penetrate the joint or be made from the interior surface.  UHV manipulator  A UHV manipulator allows an object which is inside a vacuum chamber and under vacuum to be mechanically positioned. It may provide rotary motion, linear motion, or a combination of both. The most complex devices give motion in three axes and rotations around two of those axes. To generate the mechanical movement inside the chamber, three basic mechanisms are commonly employed: a mechanical coupling through the vacuum wall (using a vacuum-tight seal around the coupling: a welded metal bellows for example), a magnetic coupling that transfers motion from air-side to vacuum-side: or a sliding seal using special greases of very low vapor pressure or ferromagnetic fluid. Such special greases can exceed USD $100 per ounce. Various forms of motion control are available for manipulators, such as knobs, handwheels, motors, stepping motors, piezoelectric motors, and pneumatics. The use of motors in a vacuum environment often requires special design or other special considerations, as the convective cooling taken for granted under atmospheric conditions is not available in a UHV environment. The manipulator or sample holder may include features that allow additional control and testing of a sample, such as the ability to apply heat, cooling, voltage, or a magnetic field. Sample heating can be accomplished by electron bombardment or thermal radiation. For electron bombardment, the sample holder is equipped with a filament which emits electrons when biased at a high negative potential. The impact of the electrons bombarding the sample at high energy causes it to heat. For thermal radiation, a filament is mounted close to the sample and resistively heated to high temperature. The infrared energy from the filament heats the sample.  Typical uses  Ultra-high vacuum is necessary for many surface analytic techniques such as: * X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) * Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) * Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) * Thermal desorption spectroscopy (TPD) * Thin film growth and preparation techniques with stringent requirements for purity, such as molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), UHV chemical vapor deposition (CVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD) and UHV pulsed laser deposition (PLD) * Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) * Field emission microscopy and Field ion microscopy * Atom Probe Tomography (APT) UHV is necessary for these applications to reduce surface contamination, by reducing the number of molecules reaching the sample over a given time period. At 0.1 mPa (10‚àí6 Torr), it only takes 1 second to cover a surface with a contaminant, so much lower pressures are needed for long experiments. UHV is also required for: * Particle accelerators The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has three UH vacuum systems. The lowest pressure is found in the pipes the proton beam speeds through near the interaction (collision) points. Here helium cooling pipes also act as cryopumps. The maximum allowable pressure is 10‚àí6 Pa (10‚àí8 mbar) * Gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO, VIRGO, GEO 600, and TAMA 300. The LIGO experimental apparatus is housed in a 10,000 m3 (353,000 cu.ft.) vacuum chamber at 10‚àí7 Pa (10‚àí9 mbar) in order to eliminate temperature fluctuations and sound waves which would jostle the mirrors far too much for gravitational waves to be sensed. * Atomic physics experiments which use cold atoms, such as ion trapping or making Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensates and, while not compulsory, can prove beneficial in applications such as: * Molecular beam epitaxy, E-beam evaporation, sputtering and other deposition techniques. * Atomic force microscopy. High vacuum enables high Q factors on the cantilever oscillation. * Scanning tunneling microscopy. High vacuum reduces oxidation and contamination, hence enables imaging and the achievement of atomic resolution on clean metal and semiconductor surfaces, e.g. imaging the surface reconstruction of the unoxidized silicon surface. * Electron-beam lithography  See also  * Vacuum engineering * Vacuum gauge * Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology * Vacuum state * Orders of magnitude (pressure) References  External links  * Online Surface Science Course Category:Vacuum systems Category:Vacuum ","title":"Ultra-high vacuum"},{"id":"1103361","text":"Elkmont may refer to: *Elkmont, Alabama *Elkmont, Tennessee ","title":"Elkmont"},{"id":"1103363","text":"The Island Council is the legislature of the Pitcairn Islands.

Construction There are several kinds of planimeters, but all operate in a similar way. The precise way in which they are constructed varies, with the main types of mechanical planimeter being polar, linear and Prytz or \\"hatchet\\" planimeters. The Swiss mathematician Jakob Amsler-Laffon built the first modern planimeter in 1854, the concept having been pioneered by Johann Martin Hermann in 1814. Many developments followed Amsler's famous planimeter, including electronic versions. The Amsler (polar) type consists of a two-bar linkage. At the end of one link is a pointer, used to trace around the boundary of the shape to be measured. The other end of the linkage pivots freely on a weight that keeps it from moving. Near the junction of the two links is a measuring wheel of calibrated diameter, with a scale to show fine rotation, and worm gearing for an auxiliary turns counter scale. As the area outline is traced, this wheel rolls on the surface of the drawing. The operator sets the wheel, turns the counter to zero, and then traces the pointer around the perimeter of the shape. When the tracing is complete, the scales at the measuring wheel show the shape's area. When the planimeter's measuring wheel moves perpendicular to its axis, it rolls, and this movement is recorded. When the measuring wheel moves parallel to its axis, the wheel skids without rolling, so this movement is ignored. That means the planimeter measures the distance that its measuring wheel travels, projected perpendicularly to the measuring wheel's axis of rotation. The area of the shape is proportional to the number of turns through which the measuring wheel rotates. The polar planimeter is restricted by design to measuring areas within limits determined by its size and geometry. However, the linear type has no restriction in one dimension, because it can roll. Its wheels must not slip, because the movement must be constrained to a straight line. Developments of the planimeter can establish the position of the first moment of area (center of mass), and even the second moment of area. The images show the principles of a linear and a polar planimeter. The pointer M at one end of the planimeter follows the contour C of the surface S to be measured. For the linear planimeter the movement of the \\"elbow\\" E is restricted to the y-axis. For the polar planimeter the \\"elbow\\" is connected to an arm with its other endpoint O at a fixed position. Connected to the arm ME is the measuring wheel with its axis of rotation parallel to ME. A movement of the arm ME can be decomposed into a movement perpendicular to ME, causing the wheel to rotate, and a movement parallel to ME, causing the wheel to skid, with no contribution to its reading. Principle Principle of the linear planimeter The working of the linear planimeter may be explained by measuring the area of a rectangle ABCD (see image). Moving with the pointer from A to B the arm EM moves through the yellow parallelogram, with area equal to PQ√óEM. This area is also equal to the area of the parallelogram A\\"ABB\\". The measuring wheel measures the distance PQ (perpendicular to EM). Moving from C to D the arm EM moves through the green parallelogram, with area equal to the area of the rectangle D\\"DCC\\". The measuring wheel now moves in the opposite direction, subtracting this reading from the former. The movements along BC and DA are the same but opposite, so they cancel each other with no net effect on the reading of the wheel. The net result is the measuring of the difference of the yellow and green areas, which is the area of ABCD. Mathematical derivation The operation of a linear planimeter can be justified by applying Green's theorem onto the components of the vector field N, given by: :\\\\\\\\!\\\\,N(x,y)=(b-y,x), where b is the y-coordinate of the elbow E. This vector field is perpendicular to the measuring arm EM: :\\\\overrightarrow{EM}\\\\cdot N = xN_x+(y-b)N_y=0 and has a constant size, equal to the length m of the measuring arm: :\\\\\\\\!\\\\,\\\\|N\\\\=\\\\sqrt{(b-y)^2+x^2}=m Then: : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\oint_C(N_x \\\\, dx + N_y \\\\, dy) = \\\\iint_S\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial N_y}{\\\\partial x}-\\\\frac{\\\\partial N_x}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right) \\\\, dx \\\\, dy \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] = {} & \\\\iint_S\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial x}-\\\\frac{\\\\partial (b-y)}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right) \\\\, dx \\\\, dy = \\\\iint_S \\\\, dx \\\\, dy = A, \\\\end{align} because: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial y}(y-b) = \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial y}\\\\sqrt{m^2-x^2} = 0, The left hand side of the above equation, which is equal to the area A enclosed by the contour, is proportional to the distance measured by the measuring wheel, with proportionality factor m, the length of the measuring arm. The justification for the above derivation lies in noting that the linear planimeter only records movement perpendicular to its measuring arm, or when :N\\\\cdot(dx,dy)=N_xdx+N_ydy is non-zero. When this quantity is integrated over the closed curve C, Green's theorem and the area follow.  Polar coordinates  The connection with Green's theorem can be understood in terms of integration in polar coordinates: in polar coordinates, area is computed by the integral \\\\scriptstyle \\\\int_\\\\theta \\\\tfrac{1}{2} (r(\\\\theta))^2\\\\,d\\\\theta, where the form being integrated is quadratic in r, meaning that the rate at which area changes with respect to change in angle varies quadratically with the radius. For a parametric equation in polar coordinates, where both r and Œ∏ vary as a function of time, this becomes :\\\\int_t \\\\tfrac{1}{2} (r(t))^2 \\\\, d(\\\\theta(t)) = \\\\int_t \\\\tfrac{1}{2} (r(t))^2\\\\, \\\\dot \\\\theta(t)\\\\,dt. For a polar planimeter the total rotation of the wheel is proportional to \\\\scriptstyle \\\\int_t r(t)\\\\, \\\\dot \\\\theta(t)\\\\,dt, as the rotation is proportional to the distance traveled, which at any point in time is proportional to radius and to change in angle, as in the circumference of a circle (\\\\scriptstyle \\\\int r\\\\,d\\\\theta = 2\\\\pi r). This last integrand \\\\scriptstyle r(t) \\\\,\\\\dot \\\\theta(t) can be recognized as the derivative of the earlier integrand \\\\scriptstyle \\\\tfrac{1}{2} (r(t))^2 \\\\dot \\\\theta(t) (with respect to r), and shows that a polar planimeter computes the area integral in terms of the derivative, which is reflected in Green's theorem, which equates a line integral of a function on a (1-dimensional) contour to the (2-dimensional) integral of the derivative.

Surrounded by city park land and circled by bike and walking trails, it is popular for many outdoor activities. The lake has an area of and a maximum depth of . Lake and surrounding area The lake (center) from the air The lake is part of the Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway, connecting with Lake of the Isles on the northeast, Cedar Lake and Brownie Lake on the northwest, and Lake Harriet on the south. The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board trail system has a trail around the lake for bicyclists and skaters and a trail around it for pedestrians. Both of these trails connect to the larger trail system via connections to Lake of the Isles and Lake Harriet. In addition, the Midtown Greenway Trail is located just north of the lake and Lake Street. The lake itself is popular for canoeing, kayaking, and windsurfing, and it has three swimming beaches. Bathers at the lake, about 1917 The three beaches are North Beach on the north side of the lake, 32nd Beach on the east, and Thomas Beach on the south. There is Bde Maka Ska Park and surrounding park land offers parking, picnicking, volleyball, and athletic fields. It is also home of sailing, hosting the Calhoun Yacht Club, the Minneapolis Sailing Center, as well as local high school teams and the University of St. Thomas Sailing Team. Stereoscopic image of the lake by Benjamin Franklin Upton From 1829-1839, it was the site of the Bdew√°khathu≈ãwa≈ã Dakota agricultural village known as ·∏¢eyate Otu≈ãwe. A plaque on the east side of the lake commemorates the mission station built by Samuel and Gideon Pond where they created the first alphabet for the Dakota language at Cloudman's Village. In 2019, the Bde Maka Ska Public Art Project was completed on the village site. On the west side is The Bakken, an old mansion with medicinal gardens and a library and museum devoted to medical electricity and the history of electromagnetism. The Como-Harriet Streetcar Line operates between the lake and Lake Harriet.  Naming  \\"Lake Mendoza\\" (as it was sometimes called) in 1908 Historic names The Dakota originally called the lake Mde Maka Ska (standardized Lakota/Dakota spelling ; English approximation: Be-DAY Mah-KAH-Ska) meaning Lake White Earth, or Lake White Bank, a name that probably was given by the Ioway who inhabited the area until the 16th century. Another Dakota name for the lake may have been Mde Med'oza, which was the name initially adopted by settlers, either as Lake Medoza or in translation as Loon Lake. The Dakota also described it as Heyate Mde, meaning the set back lake. Calhoun naming The United States Secretary of War, John C. Calhoun, sent the Army to survey the area that would surround Fort Snelling in 1817. Calhoun had also authorized the construction of Fort Snelling, one of the earliest American settlements in the state. The surveyors named the water body \\"Lake Calhoun\\" in his honor, and the Fort Snelling Military Reservation survey map of Lt. James L. Thompson in 1839 shows that name for the lake. The downtown Minneapolis skyline and refectory building reflected in the lake in 2017 Calhoun‚ÄìBde Maka Ska naming dispute Calhoun's legacy as a slaveowner and pro-slavery politician led critics to question whether he was the best person to be honored. In 2011 the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board (MPRB) visited the issue. Their legal counsel concluded that the board could not legally change the name, as state law gives that power to the Commissioner of Natural Resources, and then only in the first 40 years after the name was designated. Following the Charleston church shooting in June 2015, a fresh drive to change the name started via an online petition and the Park Board indicated it would look into whether they could change the lake's name through state action. At the time, the Minneapolis Star Tribune published an article quoting Calhoun's views on the black race: > The number of deaf and dumb, blind, idiots and insane of the Negroes in the > States that have changed the ancient relations between the races [and are no > longer slaves] is one out of every ninety-six; while in the States adhering > to it [slavery], it is one out of every six hundred and sixty-one; being > nearly six to one against the free blacks in the same state as well as his actions in ordering the flogging of one his own slaves.Furst, Randy, \\"John C. Calhoun, namesake of a Minneapolis lake, beat his slaves and trumpeted slavery\\", Minneapolis Star Tribune, July 11, 2015. In fall 2015 the board added the Dakota name to signage below the official name. In March 2016, an advisory group decided by majority vote to urge the MPRB to restore the lake's former name. There was also a proposal to rename the lake for Senator Paul Wellstone, who is buried in nearby Lakewood Cemetery. In 2017, the Minneapolis Park Board voted unanimously to recommend changing the lake's name back to Bde Maka Ska and the Hennepin County commissioners agreed. In January 2018, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) made Bde Maka Ska the official name in Minnesota. To change it at the federal level, the state submitted materials to the U.S. Board on Geographic Names, which approved the change in June 2018. Park signs around the lake use only the name Bde Maka Ska. On April 29, 2019, the Minnesota Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the DNR, holding that a name that had been in use more than 40 years could only be changed by the legislature. The MPRB stated they would continue to keep the signage of Bde Maka Ska at the lake and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said, \\"I will continue to call Bde Maka Ska by its rightful name. That was the lake's name before people who look like me renamed it to honor a slavery apologist and ‚Äî as far as I'm concerned ‚Äî that is still its name today\\". The DNR appealed the decision, and also released a statement confirming that the federal Board on Geographic Names had adopted Bde Maka Ska as the lake's official name Executive secretary of the U.S. Board on Geographic Names Lou Yost said, \\"State legislation (or court ruling) is not binding on the Federal Government. The name at the Federal level will remain Bde Maka Ska as was approved at the BGN's June 21, 2018 meeting\\". The decision was appealed to the Minnesota Supreme Court, which heard oral argument November 13, 2019. On May 13, 2020, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources had the authority to rename Lake Calhoun as Bde Maka Ska, ruling that the law restricting renaming only applied to county boards, not to the DNR. Fish The lake covered with ice and snow in December The lake contains black crappie, bluegill, bowfin, common carp, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed, tiger muskellunge, walleye, white sucker, and yellow perch. Some fish consumption guideline restrictions have been placed on the lake's bluegill, crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, walleye, and white sucker due to mercury and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid contamination. In 1991, the then-Minnesota state record tiger muskellunge at was caught in the lake.

First page of the manuscript written in Medieval Latin Gesta Hungarorum, or The Deeds of the Hungarians, is the first extant Hungarian book about history. Its genre is not chronicle, but gesta, meaning \\"deeds\\" or \\"acts\\", which is a medieval entertaining literature. It was written by an unidentified author who has traditionally been called Anonymus in scholarly works. According to most historians, the work was completed between around 1200 and 1230. The Gesta exists in a sole manuscript from the second part of the 13th century, which was for centuries held in Vienna. It is part of the collection of Sz√©ch√©nyi National Library in Budapest. The principal subject of the Gesta is the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin at the turn of the 9th and 10th centuries, and it writes of the origin of the Hungarians, identifying the Hungarians' ancestors with the ancient Scythians. Many of its sources‚Äîincluding the Bible, Isidore of Seville's Etymologiae, the 7th-century Exordia Scythica, the late 9th-century Regino of Pr√ºm's Chronicon, and early medieval romances of Alexander the Great‚Äîhave been identified by scholars. Anonymus also used folk songs and ballads when writing his work. He knew a version of the late 11th-century \\"Hungarian Chronicle\\" the text of which has partially been preserved in his work and in later chronicles, but his narration of the Hungarian Conquest differs from the version provided by the other chronicles. Anonymus did not mention the opponents of the conquering Hungarians known from sources written around 900, but he wrote of the Hungarians' fight against rulers unknown from other sources. According to a scholarly theory, he used place names when naming the opponents of the Hungarians. Background An 11th-century copy of the Annals of Fulda‚Äîan important contemporaneous source of the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin Although the Hungarians, or Magyars, seem to have used their own alphabet before adopting Christianity in the 11th century, most information of their early history was recorded by Muslim, Byzantine and Western European authors. For instance, the Annals of Fulda, Regino of Pr√ºm's Chronicon, and Emperor Constantine VII's De administrando imperio contain contemporaneous or nearly contemporaneous reports of their conquest of the Carpathian Basin at the turn of the 9th and 10th centuries. Among the Hungarians, oral tradition‚Äîsongs and ballads‚Äîpreserved the memory of the most important historical events. The Illuminated Chronicle explicitly stated that the \\"seven captains\\" who led the Hungarians during the Conquest \\"composed lays about themselves and sang them among themselves in order to win worldly renown and to publish their names abroad, so that their posterity might be able to boast and brag to neighbours and friends when these songs were heard\\".The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle (ch. 36), p. 100. The Gesta Hungarorum, or The Deeds of the Hungarians, is the first extant Hungarian chronicle. Its principal subject is the conquest of the Carpathian Basin and it narrates the background and the immediate aftermath of the conquest. Many historiansincluding Carlile Aylmer Macartney and Andr√°s R√≥na-Tasagree that Simon of K√©za's chronicle, the Illuminated Chronicle and other works composed in the 13th‚Äì15th centuries preserved texts which had been written before the completion of the Gesta. They say that the first \\"Hungarian Chronicle\\" was completed in the second half of the 11th century or in the early 12th century. The existence of this ancient chronicle is proven by later sources. One Ricardus's report of a journey of a group of Dominican friars in the early 1230s refers to a chronicle, The Deeds of the Christian Hungarians, which contained information of an eastern Magna Hungaria. The Illuminated Chronicle from 1358 refers to \\"the ancient books about the deeds of the Hungarians\\"The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle (ch. 82), p. 111. in connection with the pagan uprisings of the 11th century. The earliest \\"Hungarian Chronicle\\" was expanded and rewritten several times in the 12th‚Äì14th centuries, but its content can only be reconstructed based on 14th-century works. Manuscript Chapter 31 of the Gesta Hungarorum The work exists in a sole manuscript. The codex is in size and contains 24 folios, including two blank pages. The first page of the codex originally contained the beginning of the Gesta. It was blanked because the scribe had made mistakes when writing the text. The work was written in a Gothic minuscule. The style of the letters and decorations, including the elaborate initial on its first page, shows that the manuscript was completed in the middle or in the second part of the 13th century. Scribal errors suggest that the extant manuscript is a copy of the original work. For instance, the scribe wrote Cleopatram instead of Neopatram in the text narrating a Hungarian raid in the Byzantine Empire although the context clearly shows that the author of the Gesta referred to Neopatras (now Ypati in Greece). The history of the manuscript up until the early 17th century is unknown. It became part of the collection of the Imperial Library in Vienna between 1601 and 1636. In this period, the court librarian Sebastian Tengnagel registered it under the title Historia Hungarica de VII primis ducibus Hungariae auctore Belae regis notario (\\"Hungarian History of the First Seven Princes of Hungary Written by King B√©la's Notary\\"). Tengnagel added numbers to the folios and the chapters. The codex was bound with a leather book cover, impressed with a double-headed eagle, in the late 18th century. The manuscript, which was transferred to Hungary in 1933 or 1934, is held in the Sz√©ch√©nyi National Library in Budapest. The author 20th-century statue of the anonymous author of the Gesta Hungarorum in Vajdahunyad Castle in Budapest The author of the Gesta Hungarorum has been known as Anonymus ever since the publication of the first Hungarian translation of his work in 1790. The author described himself as \\"P who is called magister, and sometime notary of the most glorious B√©la, king of Hungary of fond memory\\"Anonymus, Notary of King B√©la: The Deeds of the Hungarians (Prologue), p. 3. in the opening sentence of the Gesta. The identification of this King B√©la is subject to scholarly debate, because four Hungarian monarchs bore this name. Most historians identify the king with B√©la III of Hungary who died in 1196. Anonymus dedicated his work to \\"the most venerable man N\\" who had been his schoolmate in an unspecified school. Anonymus mentioned that they had found pleasure in reading the Trojan History, a work attributed to Dares Phrygius, which enjoyed popularity in the Middle Ages. He also referred to a work of the Trojan War that he had \\"brought most lovingly together into one volume\\" upon his masters' instructions. Anonymus stated that he had decided to write of \\"the genealogy of the kings of Hungary and of their noblemen\\" because he had no knowledge of any decent account of the Hungarian Conquest. According to scholars who identify Anonymus as King B√©la III's notary, he wrote his Gesta around 1200 or in the first decades of the 13th century. The study of place names mentioned in the Gesta suggests that Anonymus had a detailed knowledge both of the wider region of √ìbuda and Csepel Island (in and to the south of present-day Budapest) and of the lands along the upper courses of the river Tisza. For instance, he mentioned a dozen places‚Äîsettlements, ferries and streams‚Äîin the former region, including \\"a small river that flows through a stone culvert\\"Anonymus, Notary of King B√©la: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 53), p. 115. to √ìbuda. He did not write of the southern and eastern parts of Transylvania. Sources Minstrels and folk-singers reciting heroic songs were well-known figures of the age of Anonymus. He explicitly referred to \\"the gabbling rhymes of mistrels and the spurious tales of peasants who have not forgotten the brave deeds and wars of the Hungarians\\"Anonymus, Notary of King B√©la: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 42.), p. 91. even to his time. However, he did not conceal his scorn for oral tradition, stating that it \\"would be most unworthy and completely unfitting for the so most noble people of Hungary to hear as if in sleep of the beginning of their kind and of their bravery and deeds from the false stories of peasants and the gabbling song of minstrels\\".Anonymus, Notary of King B√©la: The Deeds of the Hungarians (Prologue), p. 5. All the same, stylistic elements (including formulaic repetitions which can be found in his text) imply that he occasionally used heroic songs. According to Krist√≥, the legend of Emese's dream of the \\"falcon that seemed to come to her and impregnate her\\"Anonymus, Notary of King B√©la: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 3.), p. 13. was one of the motifs that Anonymus borrowed from oral tradition. Anonymus, as Macartney says, claimed to \\"rely solely on written sources, as alone trustworthy\\" when writing his work. Among his sources, Anonymus explicitly mentioned the Bible and Dares Phrygius's Trojan History. He borrowed texts from the latter work and adopted its \\"overall structure of short but informative accounts naming important protagonists and main events\\", according to historians Martyn Rady and L√°szl√≥ Veszpr√©my. Anonymus also referred to \\"historians writing of the deeds of the Romans\\"Anonymus, Notary of King B√©la: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 1.), p. 9. when narrating the history of the Scythians. According to Krist√≥, Gy√∂rffy and Thoroczkay, Anonymus obviously read the so-called Exordia Scythica (\\"Scythian Genesis\\"), a 7th-century abridgement of a work of the 2nd- century historian, Justin. Anonymus used Regino of Pr√ºm's Chronicon, that he mentioned as \\"the annals of chronicles\\"Anonymus, Notary of King B√©la: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 7.), p. 21. in his Gesta. He accepted Regino of Pr√ºm's view when identifying the Scythians as the Hungarians' ancestors. Sometimes, he misinterpreted his sources. For instance, he wrote of \\"the boundaries of the Caranthians of the Mura\\" (Carinthinorum Moroanensium fines)Anonymus, Notary of King B√©la: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 50.), pp. 106-107. instead of the \\"lands of the Carinthians, Moravians\\" (Carantenorum, Marahensium ... fines)The Chronicle of Regino of Pr√ºm (year 889), p. 205. of which he read in Regino of Pr√ºm's Chronicon, which shows that Anonymus did not understand Regino of Pr√ºm's reference to the Moravians. Direct borrowings from Isidore of Seville's Etymologiae, Hugh of Bologna's Rationes dictani prosaice, and medieval romances about Alexander the Great prove that Anonymus also used these works. According to Macartney, textual coincidences show that Anonymus adopted parts of late 12th-century chronicles narrating Frederick Barbarossa's crusade. For instance, Anonymus' descriptions of tournaments seem to have been taken from Arnold of L√ºbeck's Chronicle of the Slavs. Anonymus also used the ancient \\"Hungarian Chronicle\\" or its sources. However, there are differences between Anonymus' narration of the Hungarian Conquest and other works preserving texts from the ancient chronicle. For instance, the Illuminated Chronicle wrote of the Hungarians' arrival in Transylvania across the Carpathian Mountains from the east at the beginning of the Conquest, but according to Anonymus the Hungarians invaded Transylvania across the valleys of the Mese≈ü Mountains from the west at a later stage. A map which depicts the Carpathian Basin on the eve of the Hungarian Conquest taking into account the narration of the Gesta Hungarorum Sources from the turn of the 9th and 10th centuries mentioned more than a dozen persons who played an important role in the history of the Carpathian Basin at the time of the Hungarian Conquest. Anonymus did not mention any of them; he did not refer, for instance, to Arnulf of Carinthia, Boris I of Bulgaria, and Svatopluk I of Moravia. On the other hand, none of the persons whom Anonymus listed among the opponents of the conquering Hungarians‚Äîfor instance, the Bulgarian Salan, the Khazar Menumorut and the Vlach Gelouwere mentioned in other sources. According to Gy√∂rffy, Engel, and other historians, Anonymus either invented these personalities or listed them anachronistically among the conquering Hungarians' opponents. Martyn Rady and L√°szl√≥ Veszpr√©my explicitly describe the Gesta Hungarorum as a \\"'toponymic romance'that seeks to explain place-names by reference to imagined events or persons, and vice versa.\\" For instance, Gy√∂rffy writes that Gelou's story was based on the conquest of Gyula of Transylvania's realm by Stephen I of Hungary in the early 11th century and Gelou was named after the town GilƒÉu where he was killed in battle, according to Anonymus. Anonymus likewise wrote that the Bulgarian Laborec had died at the River Laborec and the Czech Zubur on the Mount Zobor near Nitra. Anonymus did not allude to the Hungarians' decisive victory over the united Bavarian forces in the Battle of Pressburg in 907, but he narrated battles unknown from other works. Anonymus seems to have applied place names when creating these battles, according to Gy≈ërffy. For instance, the Gesta Hungarorum wrote of a battle between the Greeks and the Hungarians at a ford by the River Tisza which was named after this event as \\"Ford of the Greeks\\",Anonymus, Notary of King B√©la: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 39.), p. 85. according to Anonymus, although it received this name after its revenues were granted to the Greek Orthodox monastery of Sremska Mitrovica in the 12th century. Late 9th-century sources mentioned the Avars, the Bavarians, the Bulgarians, the Danubian Slavs, the Gepids and the Moravians among the peoples inhabiting the Carpathian Basin. Anonymus did not mention the Avars, the Bavarians, the Gepids and the Moravians, but he listed the Czechs, the Greeks, the Khazars, the \\"Romans\\" and their shepherds, the Sz√©kelys, and the Vlachs besides the Bulgarians and the Slavs. According to Gy√∂rffy and Madgearu, Anonymus may have based his list of the peoples inhabiting the Carpathian Basin on the local Slavs' oral tradition which was preserved in the early 12th-century Russian Primary Chronicle. The latter source described the Slavs as the first settlers in the Carpathian Basin and mentioned that they were conquered by the \\"Volokhi\\" before the Hungarians arrived and expelled the Volokhi. According to Gy√∂rffy, Krist√≥ and other historians, Anonymus misinterpreted his source when identifying the Volokhi with the Vlachs, because the Volokhi were actually Franks who occupied Pannonia, but the Hungarians expelled them during the Conquest. But Spinei, Pop and other historians write that Russian Primary Chronicle confirms Anonymus's report of the Hungarians' fight against the Vlachs. Madgearu, who does not associate the Volokhi with the Vlachs, emphasizes that Anonymous \\"had no interest to invent the presence of the [Vlachs] in Transylvania in the 10th century, because if [Vlachs] had indeed arrived there in the 12th century, his readers would not have believed this assertion\\". Gy√∂rffy says that the Vlachs, Cumans, Czechs and other peoples whose presence in the late-9th-century Carpathian Basin cannot be proven based on sources from the same period reflects the situation of the late 13th century. Structure The Gesta contains a prologue and 57 chapters. In the prologue, Anonymus introduced himself and declared that he decided to write his work to put in writing the early history of the Hungarians and their conquest of the Carpathian Basin. In addition, he stated that he wanted to write of the genealogy of the royal √Årp√°d dynasty and of the noble families of the Kingdom of Hungary. The first seven chapters describe the Hungarians' legendary homelandmentioned as Scythia or Dentumogerand their departure from there. According to Macartney, the first chapter was based on the late 11th-century \\"Hungarian Chronicle\\", and it contains interpolations from the Exordia Scythica and Regino of Pr√ºm's chronicle. The second chapter explains that the Hungarians were named after \\"Hunguar\\"Anonymus, Notary of King B√©la: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 2.), p. 13. (present-day Uzhhorod in Ukraine). The third chapter preserved the totemistic pre-Christian tradition of the origin of the √Årp√°d dynasty, narrating Emese's dream of the falcon impregnating her before the birth of her son, √Ålmos. The next section describes √Ålmos, mentioning that he was \\"more powerful and wiser than all the princes of Scythia\\",Anonymus, Notary of King B√©la: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 4.), p. 15. which may have derived from oral tradition or from the common wording of contemporaneous legal documents. The fifth chapter writes of the election of √Ålmos as \\"the leader and master\\"Anonymus, Notary of King B√©la: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 5.), p. 17. of the Hungarians, mentioning a blood-mingling ceremony. In this section, Anonymus states that the Hungarians \\"chose to seek for themselves the land of Pannonia that they had heard from rumor had been the land of King Attila\\" whom Anonymus describes as √Ålmos's forefather. The next chapter narrates the oath that the leaders of the Hungarians took after √Ålmos's election, including the confirmation of the hereditary right of √Ålmos's descendants to rule and the right of his electors and his electors' offspring to hold the highest offices in the realm. In the seventh chapter, Anonymus writes of the Hungarians' departure from Scythia and their route across the river \\"Etil\\" and \\"Russia which is called Suzdal\\" to Kiev. The next four sections of the Gesta describe the fights of the Hungarians with the Rus' people and the \\"Cumans\\". Anonymus's report of the Hungarians' passing by Kiev was based on the ancient \\"Hungarian Chronicle\\", according to Macartney. References to the Hungarians' march by Kiev towards the Carpathian Basin can also be found in the Russian Primary Chronicle, and in Simon of K√©za's and Henry of M√ºgeln's chronicles. In an attempt to make his work more entertaining, Anonymus supplemented this information with vivid battle-scenes borrowed from the Trojan History and the romances about Alexander the Great, according to Macartney. Anonymus mentions an alliance between the Rus' people and the \\"Cumans\\" against the Hungarians. Macartney, Gy√∂rffy, Spinei and many other historians agree that he misinterpreted the Hungarian word kun, which originally designated all nomadic Turkic peoples, and wrongly identified the Kuns mentioned in one of his sources with the Cumans of his age. The latter had at least twice supported the Rus' princes against the Hungarian monarchs in the 12th century, which explains Anonymus's mistake. The ninth chapter of the Gesta describes the submission of the Rus' and \\"Cuman\\" princes to √Ålmos. Anonymus also writes how seven Cuman chieftains joined the Hungarians, which may have preserved the memory of the integration of the Kabars in the Hungarian tribal alliance based on oral tradition of the noble families of Kabar origin, according to Gy√∂rffy. Reception and editions The existence of a sole manuscript of the Gesta Hungarorum shows that the chronicle \\"was not very popular during either its author's lifetime or the subsequent centuries\\", according to historian Florin Curta. Later chronicles did not use the Gesta, suggesting that Anonymus's contemporaries knew that he had invented most details of his account of the Hungarian Conquest, according to Gyula Krist√≥. For instance, Friar Julian and his Dominican brethren studied The Deeds of the Christian Hungarians instead of Anonymus's work before departing for the ancient homeland of the Magyars in the early 1230s. The Gesta was first published as the first volume of the series Scriptures rerum Hungaricarum in 1746 by Johann Georg von Schwandtner. Matthias B√©l wrote a preface to this first edition. Professors of the Universities of Halle and G√∂ttingen soon raised their doubts about the reliability of the Gesta, emphasizing, for instance, the anachronistic description of the Rus' principalities. The Slovak scholar Juraj Sklen√°r dismissed Anonymus's work in the 1780s, pointing out that Anonymus failed to mention Great Moravia.. When demanding the emancipation of the Romanians of Transylvania in the late 18th century, the authors of the Supplex Libellus Valachorum referred to Anonymus's work. Anonymus's three heroesGelou, Glad and Menumorutplay a preeminent role in Romanian historiography. Romanian historians have always presented them as Romanian rulers whose presence in the Gesta proves the existence of Romanian polities in the territory of present- day Romania at the time of the Hungarian Conquest. The Romanian government even published a full-page advertisement about the reliability of Anonymus's reference to the Romanians in the New York Times in 1987. The view of modern historians on the Gesta Hungarorum is mixed: some consider it a reliable source; others consider its information doubtful. Alexandru Madgearu, who wrote a monography of the Gesta Hungarorum, concluded that the \\"analysis of several fragments of\\" the Gesta Hungarorum \\"has demonstrated that this work is generally credible, even if it ignores important events and characters and even if it makes some chronological mistakes\\". According to Neagu Djuvara, the factual accuracy of Anonymus's work is likely high, because it is the earliest preserved Hungarian chronicle and is based on even older Hungarian chronicles. On the other hand, Carlile Aylmer Macartney described Anonymus's work as \\"the most famous, the most obscure, the most exasperating and most misleading of all the early Hungarian texts\\" in his book of medieval Hungarian historians. Paul Robert Magocsi also regarded the Gesta as an unreliable work.

Based on the Earth's orbit around the Sun and the solar system's speed with respect to the center of the galaxy (which on short time scales can be considered constant), the Earth should be exposed to a higher flux of dark matter particles around June 2, when its orbital speed is added to the one of the solar system with respect to the galaxy and to a smaller one around December 2, when the two velocities are subtracted. The annual modulation signature is distinctive since the effect induced by dark matter particles must simultaneously satisfy many requirements. Description The experimental set-up was located deep underground in the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy. The experimental set-up was made by nine 9.70 kg low- radioactivity scintillating thallium-doped sodium iodide crystals [NaI(Tl)]. Each crystal was faced by two low-background photomultipliers through 10 cm light guides. The detectors were installed inside a sealed copper box flushed with highly pure nitrogen in order to insulate the detectors from air that contains trace amounts of radon, a radioactive gas. To reduce the natural environmental background the copper box is enclosed inside a multicomponent multi-ton passive shield made of copper, lead, polyethylene/paraffin, cadmium foil. A plexiglas box encloses the whole shield and is also kept in a highly pure nitrogen atmosphere. A concrete neutron moderator 1 m thick largely surrounds the set-up. Results The DAMA/NaI set-up observed the annual modulation signature over 7 annual cycles (1995‚Äì2002). The presence of a model independent positive evidence in the data of DAMA/NaI was first reported by the DAMA collaboration in fall 1997 and published beginning of 1998. The final paper with the full results was published in 2003 after the end of experiment in July 2002. Various corollary investigations are continuing and have also been published. The model-independent evidence is compatible with a wide set of scenarios regarding the nature of the dark matter candidate and related astrophysical, nuclear and particle physics, for example: neutralinos, inelastic dark matter, self-interacting dark matter, and heavy 4th generation neutrinos, A careful quantitative investigation of possible sources of systematic and side reactions has been regularly carried out and published at the time of each data release. No systematic effect or side reaction able to account for the observed modulation amplitude and to simultaneously satisfy all the requirements of the signature has been found. The experiment has also obtained and published many results on other processes and approaches. Skepticism Negative results from the XENON Dark Matter Search Experiment seem to contradict DAMA/Nal's results. The COSINE-100 collaboration has been working in Korea towards confirming or refuting the DAMA-signal. They are using a similar experimental setup to DAMA (NaI(Ti)-crystals). They published their results in December 2018 in the journal Nature; their conclusion was that their \\"result rules out WIMP‚Äìnucleon interactions as the cause of the annual modulation observed by the DAMA collaboration\\". A possible explanation of the reported modulation was pointed out as originating from the data analysis procedure. A yearly subtraction of the constant component can give rise to a sawtooth residual in the presence of a slower time dependence. Follow-up DAMA/NaI has been replaced by the new generation experiment, DAMA/LIBRA. These experiments are carried out by Italian and Chinese researchers.

Biography After The High School of Music & Art in New York City, Philip Corner received his BA (1955) at CCNY, where his most important teacher was Fritz Jahoda; and an MA (1959) from Columbia University where his composition teachers were Otto Luening and Henry Cowell, The two years in between (1955‚Äì57) were spent in Paris at the Conservatoire Nat'l de Musique, following the class \\"Philosophie Musicale\\" of Olivier Messiaen. Equally important was his friendship with the Canadian painter Paul-Emile Borduas, who introduced him to \\"la grande aventure nord-am√©ricaine\\", to which he returned and became part of the group around John Cage. At the same time he resumed his studies of the piano with Dorothy Taubman, which was to have a significant role in his compositional as well as performing life. He taught Modern Music at the New School for Social Research from 1967‚Äì1970, inheriting the class founded by John Cage at double remove after Richard Maxfield, with whom he was teaching assistant, and Malcolm Goldstein. His teaching career started at a New York City high school and continued at the New Lincoln School where he helped develop the music department and introduced innovative courses (1966‚Äì1972). During this period he was married to the astrologer and trance medium Julie Winter who was also a minister in the Church of Religious Science, with which he too was associated, composing music to be sung at meditation sessions. From 1972 to 1992 he continued as professor at the newly established Livingston College, a part of Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, soon to be absorbed into the Mason Gross School of the Arts. He then took early retirement and moved to Reggio Emilia, Italy where he had previous contact through the Pari e Dispari \\"Arte Club Internazionale\\". An early friend, the dancer and choreographer Phoebe Neville, joined him there and became his wife and performance partner. He was a founding participant of Fluxus since 1961, was a resident composer and musician with the Judson Dance Theatre from 1962 to 1964 and later with the Experimental Intermedia Foundation upon the invitation of Elaine Summers, for whose dance company he served as musician. He co-founded with Malcolm Goldstein and James Tenney the Tone Roads Chamber Ensemble in 1963 (active until 1970), with Julie Winter Sounds Out of Silent Spaces in 1972 (active until 1979) and with Barbara Benary and Daniel Goode, Gamelan Son of Lion in 1976 (still active). Works Corner became interested in calligraphy during military service in Korea in 1960‚Äì1961 and studied it with Ki-sung Kim; it is often incorporated into his scores. While there he became enamored with Korean traditional music, particularly the jeongak composition Sujecheon, which he describes as \\"the most beautiful piece of music in the history of the world.\\" Many of his scores are open-ended in that some elements are specified, but others are left partially or entirely to the discretion of the performers. Some employ standard notation, whereas others are graphic scores, text scores, etc. His music also frequently explores unintentional sound, chance activities, minimalism, and non-Western instruments and tuning systems. Improvisation is important, though not exclusive; some \\"performance proposals\\" lead to a kind of ecstatic semi-trance. Contact with artists in other media, especially dance and the visual arts, as well as a long-standing interest in Eastern religions such as Zen Buddhism and study of the music of composers from the Baroque and Pre-Baroque eras, has likewise impacted his music. Representative works include the ensemble pieces Passionate Expanse of the Law, Sang-teh/Situations and Through the Mysterious Barricade, among many others. Also in his incredibly large oeuvre are piano pieces (perfect, Pictures of Pictures from Pictures of Pictures), choral works (Peace, be still), electronic music (the war cantata Oracle), and more than 400 works in the Gamelan series, to mention only some of his catalogue. He divides his output into five periods, each one reflective of his attitudes at the time: #Culture, 1950s #The World, 1960s and 1970s #Mind, 1970s and 1980s #Body, 1980s and 1990s #Spirit; Soul, 1999‚Äìpresent Frog Peak Music, a Composer's Collective, has undertaken to make as much as possible of his opera omnia available by on-order photocopy publication. Non-musical activities In addition to his work as a composer and musician, he has created numerous assemblages, calligraphy, collages, drawings, and paintings, many of which have been exhibited internationally. He has also written much poetry, which like some of his music, has occasionally appeared under his Korean pseudonym Gwan Pok, meaning \\"Contemplating Waterfall\\". Editions in silk-screen have been brought out by the Archivio F. Conz, Verona, and Pari e Dispari Agency in Reggio Emilia, among others. Works are regularly exhibited in galleries, mostly in Europe, and are in notable museum collections. His principal gallery is UnimediaModern in Genova, whose director Caterina Gualco maintains a large collection. Other important collectors are Hermann Braun in Germany (deceased 2009) and Luigi Bonotto in Bassano who maintains an extensive documentation.

In Sikhism it is used to describe a being who has attained spiritual enlightenment and divine knowledge and power through union with God.  Etymology  Sant is sometimes translated as \\"saint\\", but this is a false cognate (there is no etymological commonality). Sant is derived from the Sanskrit root sat, which can mean \\"truth, reality, essence\\", and saint is derived from Latin sanctus, which means \\"holy, sacred\\",William Pinch (1996), Peasants and Monks in British India, University of California Press, , page 181 footnote 3 from Indo- European root sak-, \\"to sanctify\\" Schomer and McLeod explain Sant as preceptor of Sat or \\"truth, reality\\", in the sense of \\"'one who knows the truth' or 'one who has experienced Ultimate Reality', that is a person who has achieved a state of spiritual enlightenment or mystical self-realisation\\". William Pinch suggests the best translation of sant is \\"truth-exemplar\\".  Usage  Sant differs from saint not merely in the etymological sense but also in usage. The word is used in various contexts:John Hawley and Mark Juergensmeyer (2008), Songs of the Saints of India, Oxford University Press, , pages 2-8 *In fifteenth- and sixteenth-century India under Islamic rule, it was used generally to describe teachers and poet-scholars who led worshippers and communities the praises of god or goddess within the Bhakti movement in Hinduism. *In modern era, the term sometimes describes any holy man or woman who advocates a particular form of spirituality or members of the group that leads a Sant Mat (teachings of a spiritual congregation). *The term is also used in a generic sense and in this respect is similar to the usage of saint to indicate a morally good person. As such, it has been applied to a wide range of gurus (not to be confused with Sikh gurus) and other religious leaders.  Sikhism  *In Sikhism, a Sant, Brahmgiani, or Bhagat is any human being that has attained God realization and spiritual communion with God. Sikhs believe that the divine energy of God can be experienced by humans on Earth. This is attained through continual recitation and spiritual internalization of God's name (Naam Japo/Naam Simran). Sikhs commonly utilize Waheguru as the name of God which translates into \\"Wondrous Guru\\". *Sants can originate from any religion. Figures such as Kabir, Ravidas, Namdev, Farid, Bhikkan and others are known as \\"Sants\\" or \\"Bhagats\\", despite some being of Islam or Hindu faith. Divine knowledge is universal, and their knowledge after obtaining enlightenment through Naam Simran has been compiled and included in the holy book of Sikhism, the Sri Guru Granth Sahib, * Sants are holy persons of very exalted status, one of being the ideal human being. As such, Sikhs are encouraged to seek the company and holy congregation of Sants (Sadh-Sangat), learn from them, and attain \\"santhood\\" through intensive reading and contemplation of Sikh scripture (gurbani) and Naam Simran. *The virtuous life associated with a sant or a brahmgyani (one who has a perfect knowledge of God) is strenuously defined in Sikh gurbani, most notably in the Sukhmani Sahib passage of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib. Sikhism advocates for people of all faiths to realize and become one with God, and attaining union with God is the highest form of spiritual enlightenment.

Amsler was born on the Stalden near the village of Schinznach in the district of Brugg, canton Aargau, and died in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. His father was Jakob Amsler-Amsler (1779‚Äì1869). On graduating from school in 1843, he went to the University of Jena and then to the University of K√∂nigsberg to study theology. At K√∂nigsberg he changed courses, deciding to focus on mathematics and physics after meeting the inspiring Franz Neumann. Among Amsler's fellow students at K√∂nigsberg were Gustav Robert Kirchhoff and Siegfried Heinrich Aronhold. Amsler gained his doctorate from K√∂nigsberg in 1848 and returned to Switzerland in the same year. In 1851 he became a Privatdozent at the University of Z√ºrich and later in that year accepted a position as a mathematics teacher at the Gymnasium in Schaffhausen. In 1854 Amsler married Elise Laffon (1830‚Äì1899). The couple had two daughters and three sons. Their oldest son Alfred Amsler (1857‚Äì1940) was a mathematician and engineer in his own right and succeeded to his father as the owner and director of the factory. From about 1885 until about 1905, father and son closely cooperated on many projects in their business; many of their ideas, inventions and constructions of the time are difficult to attribute to either one of them.

He currently serves as vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, where he oversees research on the Middle East. He was Jordan's first ambassador to Israel and former ambassador to the United States.Noam Chomsky, \\"Is the world too big to fail?\\", Salon.com, 21 April 2011. Education and early career Muasher attended Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, where he earned a bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering in 1977, a master of science degree in computer engineering in 1978, and a Ph.D., also in computer engineering, in 1981. Muasher began his career working as a journalist for the Jordan Times, the only Jordanian newspaper in the English language. He then entered government service, working in communications in the Ministry of Planning, at the prime minister's office as press adviser, and as director of the Jordan Information Bureau in Washington, D.C. Career Jordanian politics In 1995, following the 1994 Israel‚ÄìJordan peace treaty, Muasher became Jordan's first ambassador to Israel. Then, in 1996, he became minister of information and the government spokesperson. From 1997 to 2002, he served in Washington, D.C., again as ambassador to the United States, and helped negotiate the Jordan‚ÄìU.S. Free Trade Agreement, the first free-trade agreement the United States signed with an Arab country. He returned to Jordan in January 2002 to serve as foreign minister, where he played a central role in developing the Arab Peace Initiative and the Middle East roadmap. He served until October 2004, when he gained the post of deputy prime minister in a cabinet reshuffle under former Prime Minister Adnan Badran that sought to continue reform and shrink the bureaucracy. He served as the deputy prime minister until November 2005. In 2005 he developed the National Agenda, a long-term political, economic and social reform plan for Jordan. The making up of the plan involved 450 Jordanian stakeholders and experts giving solutions and deadlines to implement them. The National Agenda was never actually realized because, according to Muasher, it was thwarted by a group of political elites and bureaucrats, eager to keep a rentier-based state system, rather than one based on merit. According to Sultan Sooud Al-Qassemi, al-Muasher, a Christian, was dropped from the post to please the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood. From 2006 to 2007, he was a member of the Jordanian Senate. International policy making From March 2007 to 2010, he served as senior vice president of external affairs at the World Bank. He currently serves as vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, where he oversees research on the Middle East from Washington, D.C., and Beirut, Lebanon. In 2011 Muasher took seat in the advisory council of The Hague Institute for Global Justice.

Background and early life Beginning life as Philip Lloyd- Greame, he was the younger son of Lieutenant-Colonel Yarburgh George Lloyd- Greame (1840‚Äì1928) of Sewerby House, Bridlington, Yorkshire, by his wife Dora Letitia O'Brien, a daughter of the Right Reverend James Thomas O'Brien, Bishop of Ossory. His paternal grandfather was Yarburgh Gamaliel Lloyd, later Lloyd- Greame (1813‚Äì1890), who inherited Sewerby House by the will of his maternal uncle Yarburgh Greame, later Yarburgh (1782‚Äì1856). He was educated at Winchester College, an all-boys public school in Winchester. He studied law at University College, Oxford, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1905. Then became an Honorary Fellow of his college and was admitted to the Inner Temple. He joined the British Army in 1914, following the start of the First World War. He was mentioned in despatches and promoted to the rank of Major. In 1916, he was awarded the Military Cross (MC) while serving on the Western Front as a brigade major to the 124th Brigade of the 41st Division. During the war, Cunliffe-Lister spent time with Winston Churchill at his advanced HQ Lawrence Farm. They later worked together in the Stanley Baldwin ministries of the 1920s, when Cunliffe-Lister served as a minister of state.Churchill to Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, 30 Dec 1924, Companion to Winston S. Churchill, vol.V, pt 1, p.326 In 1917 he was appointed joint secretary to the Minister of National Service. He was noticed by David Lloyd George, who recruited the young man to be chairman of the Labour sub-committee of the war cabinet in Downing Street. At the end of the war, he stood as a Conservative candidate in the Coupon election of 1918. Political career He agreed to join the Coalition slate and was elected for Hendon. He would hold this seat until his elevation to the House of Lords in 1935. His strong intellect was immediately recognizable as a member of the National Expenditure select committee scrutinizing the controversial McKenna Duties and Homes Fit For Heroes, after which in 1920 he was knighted. He achieved his first ministerial post as Additional Under-Secretary Foreign Affairs in 1920 and took charge of the Overseas Trade Department in 1921 as Additional Parliamentary Secretary. In 1922 he became a Privy Counsellor and was appointed President of the Board of Trade, an office he would hold with two breaks until 1931. This fast elevation to the Cabinet came about because of the collapse of the Lloyd George Coalition Government, which forced the new Prime Minister Bonar Law to promote many inexperienced MPs. In 1923, Law was forced to resign due to failing health and there was discussion as to whether he would be succeeded by Stanley Baldwin or Lord Curzon. As the last survivor of Law's Cabinet, Lloyd-Greame would later assert that it was Cabinet hostility to Curzon that prevented his appointment as Prime Minister, when he returned from the Imperial Economic Council. On 27 November 1924 Lloyd-Greame changed his surname to Cunliffe-Lister so as to be able to inherit property from his wife's family. Raised to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire in 1929. In 1931 Cunliffe-Lister was one of the Conservatives chosen to negotiate with the Labour Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald as the latter's government collapsed and was replaced by the multi-party National Government. As a sign of his prominence within the party, Cunliffe-Lister was one of just four Conservatives in the emergency Cabinet of 10, serving for the third and final time as President of the Board of Trade. The National Government won a massive election victory in the 1931 general election but was internally divided on the question of protective tariffs. So as to balance the Cabinet Cunliffe-Lister was replaced at the Board of Trade by the supposed Free Trader Walter Runciman, and instead became Secretary of State for the Colonies, which he would hold until June 1935. When MacDonald retired as Prime Minister and was succeeded by Stanley Baldwin a Cabinet reshuffle took place in which Cunliffe-Lister became Secretary of State for Air. At the 1935 general election he did not contest his seat and was instead ennobled as Viscount Swinton, retaining his ministerial office for the next three years into the premiership of Neville Chamberlain he took the strategic post of Secretary of State for Air responsible for Britain air defences in the lead up to war. As Swinton was now in the House of Lords his hands were free to be Chairman of the UK Commercial Corporation responsible for boosting enterprise and output. So Chamberlain appointed the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Lord Winterton (an Irish peer who sat in the House of Commons) to speak for the Air Ministry in the Commons. This arrangement did not prove successful and in May 1938 there was a disastrous debate on air and it became clear to Chamberlain that the Secretary of State must sit in the House of Commons. Swinton was dismissed, his political career seemingly over. After serving as Minister Resident in West Africa and being made a Companion of Honour in 1943, during the Second World War Swinton's career revived when he was appointed as the first Minister of Civil Aviation, a post he held until the end of the war. During 1944 he served on the Executive Committee and on the Steering Committee at the Convention on International Civil Aviation done in Chicago, formally representing the United Kingdom. When Winston Churchill formed his peacetime government in 1951 he appointed Swinton as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister for War Materials a year later. As Deputy Leader of the House of Lords Lord Swinton was also Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations for three years. When in 1955 Churchill retired, Swinton insisted on retiring too, and he was further ennobled as the Earl of Swinton. Towards the end of his life, Swinton was an Honorary Fellow of University College, Oxford.Honorary Fellows. University College Record, Volume III, Number 5, page 292, October 1960. Family Philip Lloyd-Greame married Mary Constance \\"Molly\\" Boynton (died 1974) on 5 September 1912. She was the granddaughter of industrialist Samuel Cunliffe-Lister, 1st Baron Masham who had bought the castle in 1882. In 1924, Philip and Molly Lloyd-Greame took the name of Cunliffe-Lister and moved to Swinton Park (sold in 1980 by the 2nd Earl and bought back 2000 by his nephew, Lord Masham and the latter's family). * John Yarburgh Cunliffe-Lister (1913‚Äì14 April 1943) * S/Ldr The Hon Philip Ingram Cunliffe-Lister DSO RAF (1918‚Äì1956) Their elder son, John, was killed in the Second World War, leaving two sons of his own, of whom the elder grandson succeeded his grandfather as the 2nd Earl of Swinton, and was succeeded 2006 by his younger brother as the 3rd Earl of Swinton.

The browser was the first demonstrated to be portable to several different operating systems. Operated from a simple command-line interface, it could be widely used on many computers and computer terminals throughout the Internet. The browser was developed starting in 1990, and then supported by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) as an example and test application for the libwww library.  History  One of the fundamental concepts of the \\"World Wide Web\\" projects at CERN was \\"universal readership\\". In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee had already written the first browser, WorldWideWeb (later renamed to Nexus), but that program only worked on the proprietary software of NeXT computers, which were in limited use. Berners-Lee and his team could not port the WorldWideWeb application with its features‚Äîincluding the graphical WYSIWYG editor‚Äî to the more widely deployed X Window System, since they had no experience in programming it. The team recruited Nicola Pellow, a math student intern working at CERN, to write a \\"passive browser\\" so basic that it could run on most computers of that time. The name \\"Line Mode Browser\\" refers to the fact that, to ensure compatibility with the earliest computer terminals such as Teletype machines, the program only displayed text, (no images) and had only line-by-line text input (no cursor positioning). Development started in November 1990 and the browser was demonstrated in December 1990. The development environment used resources from the PRIAM project, a French language acronym for \\"PRojet Interdivisionnaire d'Assistance aux Microprocesseurs\\", a project to standardise microprocessor development across CERN. The short development time produced software in a simplified dialect of the C programming language. The official standard ANSI C was not yet available on all platforms. The Line Mode Browser was released to a limited audience on VAX, RS/6000 and Sun-4 computers in March 1991. Before the release of the first publicly available version, it was integrated into the CERN Program Library (CERNLIB), used mostly by the High-Energy Physics- community. The first beta of the browser was released on 8 April 1991. Berners-Lee announced the browser's availability in August 1991 in the alt.hypertext newsgroup of Usenet. Users could use the browser from anywhere in the Internet through the telnet protocol to the info.cern.ch machine (which was also the first web server). The spreading news of the World Wide Web in 1991 increased interest in the project at CERN and other laboratories such as DESY in Germany, and elsewhere throughout the world. The first stable version, 1.1, was released in January 1992.The PC-NFS version (dated 92.01.16) for MS- DOS: wwwpcnfs.zip (NOTE: Firefox browsers may refuse to download the file, claiming that \\"file contains a virus or malware\\". VirusTotal results.). Since version 1.2l, released in October 1992, the browser has used the common code library (later called libwww). The main developer, Pellow, started working on the MacWWW project, and both browsers began to share some source code. In the May 1993 World Wide Web Newsletter Berners-Lee announced that the browser was released into the public domain to reduce the work on new clients. On 21 March 1995, with the release of version 3.0, CERN put the full responsibility for maintaining the Line Mode Browser on the W3C. The Line Mode Browser and the libwww library are closely tied together‚Äîthe last independent release of a separate browser component was in 1995, and the browser became part of libwww. The Agora World Wide Web email browser was based on the Line Mode Browser. The Line Mode Browser was very popular in the beginning of the web, since it was the only web browser available for all operating systems. Statistics from January 1994 show that Mosaic had quickly changed the web browser landscape and only 2% of all World Wide Web users browsed by Line Mode Browser. The new niche of text-only web browser was filled by Lynx, which made the Line Mode Browser largely irrelevant as a browser. One reason was that Lynx is much more flexible than the Line Mode Browser. It then became a test application for the libwww.  Operating mode  The simplicity of the Line Mode Browser had several limitations. The Line Mode Browser was designed to work on any operating system using what were called \\"dumb\\" terminals. The user interface had to be as simple as possible. The user began with a command-line interface specifying a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The requested web page was then printed line by line on the screen, like a teleprinter. Websites were displayed using the first versions of HTML. Formatting was achieved with capitalization, indentation, and new lines. Header elements were capitalized, centered and separated from the normal text by empty lines. Navigation was not controlled by a pointing device such as a mouse or arrow keys, but by text commands typed into the program. Numbers in brackets are displayed for each link; links are opened by typing the corresponding number into the program. This led one journalist of the time to write: \\"The Web is a way of finding information by typing numbers.\\" The page scrolled down when an empty command (carriage return) was entered, and scrolled up with the command \\"\`u\`\\". The command \\"\`b\`\\" navigated backwards in history, and new pages were navigated with \\"\`g http://...\`\\" (for go to) and the URL. The browser had no authoring functions, so pages could only be read and not edited. This was considered to be unfortunate by Robert Cailliau, one of the developers:  Features  The Line Mode Browser was designed to be able to be platform independent. There are official ports to Apollo/Domain, IBM RS6000, DECStation/ultrix, VAX/VMS, VAX/Ultrix, MS-DOS, Unix, Windows, Classic Mac OS, Linux, MVS, VM/CMS, FreeBSD, Solaris, and to macOS. The browser supports many protocols like File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Gopher, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), and Wide area information server (WAIS). Other features included rlogin and telnet hyperlinks, Cyrillic support (added on 25 November 1994 in version 2.15), and ability to be set up as a proxy client. The browser could run as a background process and download files. The Line Mode Browser has had problems recognizing character entities, properly collapsing whitespace, and supporting tables and frames.

Mulki served as Prime Minister until he submitted his resignation on 4 June 2018 after protests had swept the country because of his government's IMF-backed austerity measures that aimed to tackle Jordan's growing public debt. The measures would raise the price of goods and services, as well as hike the tax rate. Early life Born in Amman in 1951, Mulki received a bachelor's degree in production engineering in Egypt in 1974 and pursued his Masters and Doctoral degrees from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Career He served as Jordan's ambassador to Egypt and as Jordan's permanent representative at the Arab League. He has held several ministerial positions; water, energy, supplies, industry and foreign affairs ministries. Mulki chaired the negotiating committee which produced the Israel-Jordan peace treaty between Jordan and Israel in 1994.Aljazeera Jordan: Hani Mulki 'likely to improve ties with Israel', May 30, 2016 During his time as foreign minister, Jordan experienced diplomatic issues with both Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Mulki was appointed as Scientific Advisor to the King, and then a member of the Senate. On 9 February 2011, Mulki was reappointed as Minister of Trade and Industries. On 9 November 2014, he was appointed Chief Commissioner of the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority, replacing Kamel Mahadin. On 29 May 2016, Mulki was appointed as the Prime Minister of Jordan, succeeding Abdullah Ensour. His cabinet was sworn in on 1 June. After the 2016 general election Mulki order a cabinet reshuffle, which resulted in three new portfolios, 22 ministers remaining and the introduction of 7 new ministers. Rising Jordanian public debt led Mulki in 2016 to negotiate a 3-year program $732 million loan facility with the International Monetary Fund, which would see the public debt falling from 95% of the GDP to 77% by 2021. The austerity program raised prices on several food staples in 2016 and 2017, making him very unpopular in the country. A 22 March 2018 report by Carnegie Endowment for International Peace commented on Mulki's policies: \\"Mulki declared openly that his predecessors had left the country at the brink of insolvency and that the failure to take tough revenue-raising measure would lead to a debt crisis which would destroy the country. And he is correct. What is more doubtful is Mulki‚Äôs assertion that Jordan ‚Äúwill get out of the bottleneck‚Äù in 2019. While the measures to raise taxes and reduce subsidies buy time, they leave Jordan struggling to stay afloat and dependent on the continued flow of extensive aid.\\" A nationwide strike organized by trade unions on 30 May 2018 in protest of Mulki's government presenting amendments to the 2014 income tax law to Parliament. The next day, his government raised fuel and electricity prices in response to rising international oil prices, prompting crowds of protestors to pour in the 4th circle near the Prime Ministry in Amman. King Abdullah intervened on 1 June and ordered the freeze of price hikes. Mulki's cabinet acquiesced but said the decision would cost the treasury $20 million. Despite the freeze, widespread protests continued due to the tax law. He submitted his resignation on 4 June 2018 and was succeeded by Omar Razzaz, his education minister.

Features include a distinct craniofacial phenotype and intellectual disability. Signs and symptoms The most common characteristics include a distinct craniofacial phenotype (microcephaly, micrognathia, short philtrum, prominent glabella, ocular hypertelorism, dysplastic ears and periauricular tags), growth restriction, intellectual disability, muscle hypotonia, seizures, and congenital heart defects. Less common characteristics include hypospadias, colobomata of the iris, renal anomalies, and deafness. Antibody deficiencies are also common, including common variable immunodeficiency and IgA deficiency. T-cell immunity is normal. Genetics Wolf‚ÄìHirschhorn syndrome is a microdeletion syndrome caused by a deletion within HSA band 4p16.3 of the short arm of chromosome 4, particularly in the region of WHSC1 and WHSC2. About 87% of cases represent a de novo deletion, while about 13% are inherited from a parent with a chromosome translocation. In the cases of familial transmission, there is a 2 to 1 excess of maternal transmission. Of the de novo cases, 80% are paternally derived. Severity of symptoms and expressed phenotype differ based on the amount of genetic material deleted. The critical region for determining the phenotype is at 4p16.3 and can often be detected through genetic testing and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Genetic testing and genetic counseling is offered to affected families. Diagnosis Initial diagnosis is based on distinct craniofacial phenotype after birth. Diagnosis of WHS is confirmed by the detection of a deletion in the WHSCR. Chromosomal microarray and Cytogenetic analysis.D4S96 or D4Z1 chromosome band 4p16.3‚Äìspecific probe (Wolf-Hirschhorn region, Vysis, Inc) is available for FISH study. Epidemiology The minimum birth incidence has been estimated as 1 in 50,000.

Steelhead (SS-280) was laid down on 1 June 1942 by the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine; launched on 11 September 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Marguerite Brown; and commissioned on 7 December 1942, Lt. Comdr. David L. Whelchel in command.  First war patrol, April ‚Äì June 1943  Steelhead held her shakedown off Long Island in December 1942 and January 1943. In February, she sailed for the Pacific and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 8 April. After intensive training, she sailed for Midway Island; topped off her fuel there on 25 April, and began her first war patrol. She planted 12 mines off the Japanese mainland near Erimo Saki and then bombarded a steel plant and iron foundry near Muroran, Hokkaid≈ç. She fired no torpedoes, and the submarine returned to Midway in early June.  Second war patrol, June ‚Äì August 1943  On her second patrol, 30 June to 6 August, Steelhead fired 10 torpedoes at a Japanese task force on 10 July. Explosions were heard, but specific damage could not be ascertained. After refitting at Pearl Harbor, the ship sailed on 13 September for the Gilbert Islands where she operated as a lifeguard submarine off Tarawa during bombardment by Army aircraft. She called at Johnston Island for fuel and provisions and departed on 25 September to resume her patrol which took her into the Palau Islands. On 6 October off the Carolines, she damaged tanker Kazalhaya, which sank later that day. All her torpedoes expended, Steelhead sighted a large convoy which she trailed, while sending information to other submarines in the area.  Third, fourth, and fifth war patrols, December 1943 ‚Äì August 1944  On her next patrol, Steelhead operated off Bungo Suido from late December 1943 to early March 1944. On 10 January 1944, she torpedoed and sank the 6,795 ton converted salvage vessel, Yamabiko Maru. Her fourth patrol, off Formosa from early April to 23 May, provided no targets worthy of torpedo fire, but she sank a trawler by gunfire. On 17 June, she sortied from Midway Island with and to patrol south of Formosa. On 31 July, the submarine made three successful attacks in which one ship was damaged and two were sunk. Parche also sank two from the convoy. Upon concluding the patrol when she arrived at Pearl Harbor on 16 August, Steelhead was routed to the West Coast for a much needed overhaul. For his services in that last patrol Whelchel, a grandson of Confederate Lieutenant General James Longstreet, was awarded the Silver Star.  Sixth war patrol, April ‚Äì August 1945  While in drydock, on 1 October 1944 Steelhead suffered a serious fire which required the installation of a new conning tower. After a long repair period, the submarine stood out of San Francisco on 16 April 1945, en route to Pearl Harbor. Steelhead began her last war patrol on 13 May. She performed lifeguard duty in the Caroline Islands and later patrolled in the Tokyo Bay area. She made no torpedo attacks but sank two trawlers by gunfire. The patrol ended at Midway Island on 5 August and, 20 days later, she sailed for the West Coast. Steelhead arrived at San Francisco on 5 September 1945 and provided services for the West Coast Sonar School until 2 January 1946. She sailed to Pearl Harbor and operated from there until March when she steamed back to San Francisco for inactivation. The submarine was placed in reserve, out of commission, on 29 June 1946 and attached to the Pacific Reserve Fleet. In May 1947, Steelhead was placed in service, in reserve, and used as a reserve training ship until struck from the Navy List on 1 April 1960.

It was based on the US M4 Sherman, but fitted with the powerful 3-inch (76.2 mm) calibre British 17-pounder anti-tank gun as its main weapon. Originally conceived as a stopgap until future British tank designs came into service, the Sherman Firefly became the most common vehicle mounting the 17-pounder in the war. During the war, the British Army made extensive use of Sherman tanks. Though they expected to have their own tank models developed soon, the previously rejected idea of mounting the 17-pounder in the existing Sherman was eventually accepted, despite initial government resistance. This proved fortunate, as both the Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger and Cruiser Mk VIII Cromwell tank designs experienced difficulties and delays. After the difficult problem of getting such a large gun to fit in the Sherman's turret was solved, the Firefly was put into production in early 1944, in time to equip Field Marshal Montgomery's 21st Army Group for the Normandy landings. It soon became highly valued, as its gun could almost always penetrate the armour of the Panther and Tiger tanks it faced in Normandy,Milner, Marc, (2014) Stopping the Panzers, University of Kansas Press, 1 something no other British Army tank could reliably do at that time. In recognition of this, German tank and anti-tank gun crews were instructed to attack Fireflies first. Because the Firefly had a visibly longer barrel, crews tried to camouflage it so the tank would look like a normal 75 mm-gun Sherman from a distance. Between 2,100 and 2,200 were manufactured before production wound down in 1945.  Origins  The idea of fitting a 17-pounder gun into a Sherman tank had initially been rejected by the Ministry of Supply's Tank Decision Board. Although the British Army had made extensive use of the American-built Sherman tank, it was intended that a new generation of British tanks would replace it in the anti-tank role. First, there was the Cromwell tank, which was expected to use the Vickers high velocity 75 mm gun; this gun would have had superior anti-tank performance to the US 75 mm and 76 mm guns that were mounted in the Sherman. The second was the A30 Challenger, which was based on the Cromwell but with the even more powerful 17-pounder gun.J. Buckley (2004) These two tanks‚Äîand their successors, the Comet and the Centurion, which were already on the drawing board‚Äîwere to replace the Sherman in British service, and so the prospect of diverting resources to mount the 17-pounder on the Sherman seemed undesirable.Fletcher (2008) Nonetheless, several unofficial attempts were made to improve the firepower of the Sherman. The earliest attempt can be credited to Major George Brighty of the Royal Tank Regiment while he was at Lulworth Armoured Fighting School in early 1943. Despite the A30 Challenger undergoing initial trials at Lulworth, Brighty was convinced that the Sherman was a better mount for the 17-pounder. However, the turret of the Sherman was too small to allow for the very long recoil of the gun. In a radical adjustment, Brighty removed the recoil system and locked the gun in place, thus forcing the entire tank to absorb the recoil, but this was a far from ideal situation and there was no telling how long the tank would have been able to handle such a set-up. Around June 1943, a colleague of Brighty, Lieutenant Colonel George Witheridge of the Royal Tank Regiment, arrived at Lulworth. A veteran of the North Africa campaign, Witheridge had experienced first-hand the one-sided battles between British tanks armed with 2-pounder guns against Rommel's formidable tanks and anti-tank guns. During the Battle of Gazala in mid-1942, Witheridge had been blown out of his (US supplied) M3 Grant medium tank, and though he recovered from his wounds, he was declared unfit to return to combat duty. Instead, in January 1943, he was posted to Fort Knox in the United States for six months to advise on gunnery, where he was \\"sold\\" on the Sherman tanks.Fletcher (2008) p.10 While at Lulworth, Witheridge inspected the A30 Challenger, and \\"joined in the chorus of complaints\\" about the tank. Upon looking up Brighty and learning of his attempts to use the Sherman, Witheridge lent his assistance. He advised Brighty on methods to solve the recoil issue. Not long after, Witheridge and Brighty received a notice from the Department of Tank Design (DTD) to cease their efforts. Unwilling to abandon the project, Witheridge, using his connections with such influential people as Major General Raymond Briggs, former GOC of the 1st Armoured Division in North Africa and now director of the Royal Armoured Corps, and successfully lobbied Claude Gibb, Director-General of Weapons and Instruments Production at the Ministry of Supply, to make it an official ministry project. In doing so, the endeavour was taken out of the hands of the highly enthusiastic and devoted amateurs at Lulworth who had initiated it and given to professional tank developers.Fletcher (2008) pp.11‚Äì12  Design  It was W.G.K. Kilbourn, a Vickers engineer working for the DTD at the time, who transformed their idea into the reality of the prototype of the tank that would serve the British forces from the invasion of Normandy in June 1944 onwards. The first thing Kilbourn had to fix was the lack of a workable recoil system for the 17-pounder. The 17-pounder travelled back as it absorbed the recoil of the blast. This was too long for the Sherman's turret.Fletcher (2008) p.13 Kilbourn solved this problem by redesigning the recoil system completely rather than modifying it. The recoil cylinders were shortened and placed on both sides of the gun to take advantage of the width of the turret. Rear view of the Firefly at the Bovington Tank Museum showing the external radio \\"bustle\\". The gun breech itself was also rotated 90 degrees to allow loading from the leftUS-designed tanks put the gunner on the right and loader on the left. British practice was the reverse rather than from on top.Hart (2007), The radio, normally mounted in the back of the turret in British tanks, had to be moved; an armoured box (a \\"bustle\\") was attached to the back of the turret to house it, with access through a large hole cut through the turret. The next problem encountered by Kilbourn was that the gun cradle, the metal block on which the gun sat, had to be shortened to allow the gun to fit into the Firefly, and thus the gun itself was not very stable. Kilbourn had a new barrel designed for the 17-pounder that had a longer untapered section at the base, which helped solve the stability problem. A new mantlet was designed to house this gun and accept the modified cradle. The Firefly had no armour or mobility advantages over the normal Sherman tank beyond the additional 13 mm of protection added to its mantlet. The modifications were extensive enough that 17-pounders intended for the Firefly had to be factory-built specifically for it. Kilbourn had to deal with other problems. On the standard Sherman tank, there was a single hatch in the turret through which the commander, gunner and loader entered and left the tank. However, the 17-pounder's larger breech and recoil system made it significantly more difficult for the loader to exit quickly if the tank was hit; a new hatch was cut into the top of the turret over the gunner's position to resolve this.Fletcher (2008) p.14 The final major change was the elimination of the hull gunner in favour of space for more 17-pounder ammunition, which was significantly longer than the original 75 mm. By October and November 1943, enthusiasm began to grow for the project. The 21st Army Group was informed of the new tank in October 1943. Even before final testing had taken place in February 1944, an order for 2,100 Sherman tanks armed with 17-pounder guns was placed, as the Challenger programme was suffering constant delays and it was realised that few would be ready for Normandy. Even worse, it was discovered that the Cromwell did not have a turret ring wide enough to take the new High Velocity 75mm gun (50 calibres long), so it would have to be armed with the general purpose Ordnance QF 75 mm. This left the Firefly as the only tank available with firepower superior to the QF 75 mm gun in the British Army's arsenal, earning it the \\"highest priority\\" from Winston Churchill. Name The nickname \\"Firefly\\" was adopted due to the bright muzzle flash of the main gun.Zaloga, Steven. Armored Thunderbolt ‚Äì The U.S. Army Sherman in World War II. Stackpole Books, 2008. p. 133. It was sometimes used at unit level (brigade/regiment) war diaries from March 1944, along with \\"Mayfly\\". During the war, Shermans with 17-pounder guns were usually known as \\"1C\\", \\"1C Hybrid\\", or \\"VC\\", depending on the basic mark of the vehicle. In British nomenclature, a \\"C\\" at the end of the Roman numeral indicated a tank equipped with the 17-pounder.for more on the explanation of the various marks, see Lend-Lease Sherman tanks#British nomenclature The name \\"Firefly\\" in period sources often refers to any vehicle with a 17-pounder gun, often the 17pdr SP Achilles M10C variant of the M10 tank destroyer.  Armament  Loading 17-pounder APCBC rounds into a Firefly The main armament of the Sherman Firefly was the Ordnance Quick-Firing 17-pounder. Designed as the successor to the British QF 6-pounder, the 17-pounder was the most powerful British tank gun of the war, and one of the most powerful of any nationality, being able to penetrate more armour than the 8.8 cm KwK 36 fitted to the German Tiger I or the Panther tank's 7.5 cm KwK 42. The Firefly 17-pounder was able to penetrate some 163 mm of armour at and 150 mm at using standard armour piercing, capped, ballistic capped (APCBC) ammunition. Armour piercing, discarding sabot (APDS) ammunition could penetrate some 256 mm of armour at 500 m and 233 mm at 1,000 m, which on paper could defeat the armour of almost every German armoured fighting vehicle at any likely range. However, war production APDS rounds lacked accuracy, and the 50 mm penetrator was less destructive after it had penetrated enemy tank armour than the 76.2 mm APCBC shell. APDS ammunition was rare until the post-war period. While the Sherman Firefly was capable of carrying 77 rounds of ammunition, design features of the tank meant only 23 rounds were easily and readily available when the tank was in action. Though the 17-pounder had superior anti-tank capabilities, it lacked an effective HE round and was thus inferior to the standard Sherman 75mm gun against soft targets, such as infantry, buildings and lightly armoured vehicles. As the war in Europe neared its close, the Allies found themselves encountering these more often than heavy German tanks. Allied tank units therefore typically refused to completely switch to Fireflies. A good HE shell for the gun only became available in late 1944, and even then was not as potent as the standard Sherman 75 mm HE shell. Another problem was that the powerful blast from the 17-pounder gun kicked up large amounts of dirt as well as smoke, making it difficult for the gunner to observe the fall of shot (and forcing him to rely on the commander to observe it and to order corrections) and revealing the position of the tank (forcing the Firefly to move every few shots). On top of these issues, the recoil and muzzle blast could be severely jarring to Firefly crews, and the muzzle blast frequently caused night blindness. The latter was a problem common to any tank armed with a high velocity gun, including the Panther and Tiger I. The cramped turret meant that loading the large shell was difficult, so the Firefly had a slower rate of fire than a standard M4 Sherman. Since the Firefly was a stopgap, these problems were never eliminated, as it was supposed to be retired with the introduction of the new British tank designs such as the Comet and later Centurion. The Firefly's secondary armament was the standard Browning .30 caliber (7.62 mm) coaxial machine gun in the turret, the hull-mounted machine gun being removed to increase ammunition storage for the main gun. A top- mounted Browning M2 .50 caliber (12.7 mm) machine gun was also attached, though many crews removed it, due to its awkward mounting and position near the commander, which limited a full 360-degree view when the hatch was open. In 1945, some British Fireflies were fitted with a rail on either side of the turret for two \\"60 lb\\" high-explosive 3-inch rockets. Called \\"Sherman Tulips\\", these were used at the Rhine Crossing by the 1st Coldstream Guards. The rockets, accurate when fired from aircraft, were less accurate when fired from a stationary platform, such as a tank, as they had little initial slipstream over the fins. The RP-3 was only effective when its 60-pound warhead hit the target.Fletcher (2008) p. 6  Production and distribution  A Sherman Firefly crosses 'Euston Bridge' over the Orne as it moves up to the start line for Operation Goodwood, 18 July 1944 Three different variants of Sherman Firefly served during the Second World War, each based on a different variant of the M4 Sherman. The Firefly conversion was carried out on Sherman I (M4), Sherman I Hybrid (M4 Composite) and Sherman V (M4A4) tanks. Some sources state that several Sherman IIs (M4A1) were converted and used in action, but photos allegedly showing these conversions are in fact views of the front half of Sherman I Hybrid Fireflies. To complicate matters, a very small number of Canadian licence-built Sherman IIs (M4A1), the Grizzly, were converted to Fireflies in Canada and used for training, but none saw action. The majority of Shermans converted were the Sherman V/M4A4 model, of which the British received about 7,200. The Sherman VC and IC variants are easily distinguished by their lower hulls; the VC having a lengthened hull, and a larger gaps between the suspension units. They employed the three-piece bolted transmission housing. The Sherman IC usually sported the cast transmission housing. The Hybrid can be distinguished by its upper hull, which is cast and gives it a distinctive curved look in comparison to the more boxy hull of a typical Sherman. Production of the Firefly started in January 1944 and, by 31 May, some 342 Sherman Fireflies had been delivered to Montgomery's 21st Army Group for the D-Day landings. As a result, British tank troops were composed of three standard Shermans and one Firefly. The same distribution occurred in Cromwell units, but this caused logistical problems, as each Cromwell troop then needed to be supplied with parts for two different tanks. The Firefly was also slower than the Cromwell. Churchill units received no Fireflies, and as a result often had to rely on any attached M10 or M10 Achilles units to provide increased firepower to deal with tanks their own guns could not eliminate. Production was limited by the availability of suitable tanks, with the phasing out of 75 mm Sherman production. To make up numbers, Sherman I and Sherman I Hybrids were also converted. From D-Day in June to the end of the Battle of Normandy in late August, almost 400 Sherman Fireflies were converted, more than sufficient to replace any permanent tank losses during the battle.Hayward (2001), p. 20 In late 1944, with the creation of an effective high-explosive shell for the 17-pounder gun, British units started to receive two Fireflies per troop. By February 1945, some 2,000 Sherman Fireflies had been built and British, Commonwealth and Polish armoured units were equipped with a 50/50 mix of 75 mm and 17-pounder-armed Shermans. In the spring of 1945, production of the Firefly was scaled down, with the last tank being delivered in May 1945. This was the result of several factors, from superior home-grown designs like the Comet and Centurion coming into service to replace the Firefly, to the impending defeat of Nazi Germany, and the inferior design of Japan's tanks, which it seemed would be the next opponents the British would have to face after the fall of Germany. Overall production of the Sherman Firefly reached some 2,100 ‚Äì 2,200 tanks; exact numbers are hard to determine as documents give contradictory totals. Jane's World War II Tanks and Fighting Vehicles gives a production of 1783 vehicles in 1944 and 563 in 1945, for a total of 2,346.Ness (2002), p. 22 Sherman Firefly gives a number of 2002 conversions made between January 1944 and February 1945 or a total of 2,139 conversions.Hayward (2001), p. 21  Service   Normandy  \\"60 lb\\" air- to-ground rockets on rails attached to the turret The earliest firefly tanks were in North Africa but new Fireflies were introduced to armoured brigadesThe British \\"Tank Brigades\\" were equipped with Churchills and divisions in the 21st Army Group in 1944, just in time for the Normandy landings. The timing was fortunate as Allied intelligence had begun to realise in early 1944 through statistical analysis that the Germans were fielding a much larger number of more formidable tanks (such as the Panther) than had been anticipated. This information was slow to reach Allied military planners, who had mistakenly assumed the Panther, like the Tiger, would be a rare heavy tank with a limited production run, so the number of Panthers deployed came as a surprise to Allied formation commanders and tank crews forced to engage them with guns that could not penetrate the frontal armour except at short range. Ken Tout, who served as a tank gunner and tank commander in the 1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry in Normandy in 1944, described the effect of mounting a 17-pounder in the Sherman: Panthers and Tigers accounted for only 30% of the 2,300 German tanks deployed in Normandy; the rest being Panzer IVs, Sturmgesch√ºtz IIIs and other tanks that the 75 mm gun Shermans were able to effectively handle. However, the importance of Caen and Montgomery's operations, which pinned German armoured forces in front of the British positions so the American units could break out to the west, meant that British and Commonwealth units had to face over 70% of all German armour deployed during the Battle of Normandy, as well as over half of the elite, well-equipped Waffen-SS Panzer units. As a result, the Sherman Firefly was perhaps the most valued tank by British and Commonwealth commanders, as it was the only tank in the British Army able to reliably penetrate the frontal armour of Panthers and Tigers at the standard combat ranges in Normandy. This fact did not go unnoticed by the Germans, who realised that these long-barrel Shermans posed a much greater threat to their heavy tanks than the normal Shermans, and German tank crews and anti-tank gun crews were instructed to eliminate Fireflies first. Similarly, the Firefly crews realised that the distinctive long barrel of their 17-pounder gun made their Fireflies stand out from standard Shermans, so they attempted to disguise their tanks to reduce the likelihood of being targeted. Some crews had the front half of the olive drab gun barrel painted white on the bottom, or white with dark green on top, to give the illusion of a shorter gun barrel. Another suggestion was for a shorter wooden dummy gun to be mounted on the rear of the turret and point forward; however, this tactic does not appear to have been used in combat. Firefly of 5th Canadian Armoured Division assists troops of 49th (West Riding) Division to clear the Germans from Ede, Netherlands, 17 April 1945 Despite being a high priority target, Fireflies appear to have had a statistically lower chance of being knocked out than standard Shermans, probably due more to how they were employed than to the actual effectiveness of the attempted camouflaging of the long barrel. Given the high value placed on Fireflies, a common tactic was for commanders to reconnoitre the battlefield before a battle, to look for good overwatch positions. During the battle, Fireflies would stay behind in those positions and cover the ordinary Shermans as they pushed forward, eliminating any enemy tanks that revealed themselves when they opened fire on the advancing Shermans, and moving forward only when the standard Shermans had secured the area or when they could no longer cover them. Similarly, when on the move, troop commanders tended to position Fireflies in the rear to reduce the chance of their being knocked out. However, given the relatively unpredictable nature of battle, this setup was not always practical or possible, and many times, Fireflies were forced to engage enemies in the open, where they could be identified. Despite this, the Firefly's increased firepower was much valued, and during many engagements, the Firefly proved its worth, knocking out Tigers and Panthers at long range, as well as less formidable tanks like the Panzer IVs and StuGs. Norrey-en- Bessin One example of this increased firepower was displayed by Lt. G. K. Henry's Firefly during the defence of Norrey-en-Bessin on 9 June against an attack by the 3rd Company of the 12th SS Panzer Regiment of the 12th SS Panzer Division. Determined to capture the town in preparation for a larger offensive to drive the British and Canadians back into the sea, Kurt Meyer ordered 12 Panthers of the 3rd Company and infantry to attack Norrey and drive the Canadians out of the town. The attack got under way at 1300 hours, with the Panthers racing towards the town at full speed, stopping only to fire their guns. However, they quickly outran their infantry support, which was forced to ground by Allied artillery fire. Within of the town, nine standard Shermans of the Canadian 1st Hussars opened fire into the advancing Panthers' flanks. Lt. Henry's gunner, Trooper A. Chapman, waited until the Panthers \\"lined up like ducks in a row\\" and quickly knocked out five Panthers with just six rounds. The attack was repulsed with the loss of seven of the 12 Panthers.Milner (2014), 5 A Sherman Firefly of 7th Armoured Division in Hamburg, 4 May 1945 Tilly-sur-Seulles A similar example occurred on 14 June, during Operation Perch. Sgt. Harris of the 4th/7th Dragoon Guards, along with three standard Shermans, set up defensive positions along with the infantry after successfully driving out the Germans from the village of Ling√®vres, near Tilly-sur-Seulles, France. Looking through his binoculars, Sgt. Harris spotted two Panthers advancing from the east. He opened fire at a range of , knocking out the lead Panther with his first shot, and the other with his second. Relocating to a well-concealed flanking position on the other side of the town, he spotted another three Panthers approaching from the west. He and his gunner, Trooper Mackillop, eliminated them with just three rounds. Saint- Aignan-de-Cramesnil In perhaps their most famous action, British and Canadian Fireflies defeated the heavy armour of a German counterattack at Saint-Aignan-de-Cramesnil during Operation Totalize on 8 August 1944, resulting in the destruction of five Tiger tanks and the death of the attack's leader, the noted German tank commander Michael Wittmann. The battle involved Fireflies from A Squadron, 1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry, 33rd Armoured Brigade; A Squadron, the Sherbrooke Fusiliers Regiment, 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade and B Squadron, The 144th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps, 33rd Armoured Brigade. They ambushed a group of seven Tiger tanks from the 3rd Company and HQ Company, 101st SS Heavy Tank Battalion supported by Panzer IV tanks and StuG IV assault guns.Reid (2005), p. 414Tout (1998) The tanks of the 1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry reached the French village of Saint-Aignan-de- Cramesnil on the morning of 8 August 1944.Reid (2005),Tout (2007),Tout (1998) While B Squadron stayed around the village, A and C Squadrons moved further south into a wood called Delle de la Roque. C Squadron positioned themselves on the east side of the woods and the under-strength A Squadron in the southern portion with No. 3 Troop on the western edge of the wood. From this position, they overlooked a large open section of ground and were able to watch as German tanks advanced up Route Nationale 158 from the town of Cintheaux. They held their fire until the German tanks were well within range. Ekins, the gunner of Sergeant Gordon's Sherman Firefly (Velikye Luki ‚Äì A Squadron's tanks were named after towns in the Soviet Union) - had yet to fire his gun in action.Hart (2007), p. 52-69 With the Tigers in range a 12-minute battle commenced that saw Ekins destroy all three Tigers that No. 3 Troop could see. A short time later, the main German counterattack was made in the direction of C Squadron. A Squadron (less Sgt Gordon who had been wounded and had already bailed out of the Firefly) moved over to support them and in the resulting combat, Ekins destroyed a Panzer IV before his tank was hit and the crew were forced to bail out.  Italy  Although the Normandy campaign had priority, Fireflies also served with distinction in British, Commonwealth and Polish units in the Italian campaign.

A contemporary and lifelong friend of Beethoven, he is now best remembered for his substantial early contributions to the wind quintet literature and his role as teacher of pupils including Franz Liszt, Hector Berlioz and C√©sar Franck. He was also an accomplished theorist, and wrote several treatises on various aspects of composition. Some of his theoretical work dealt with experimental methods of composition, which he applied in a variety of works such as fugues and √©tudes for piano and string quartet. None of the advanced ideas he advocated in the most radical of his music and writings, such as polyrhythm, polytonality and microtonal music, were accepted or employed by other nineteenth-century composers. Due to Reicha's unwillingness to have his music published (like Michael Haydn before him), he fell into obscurity soon after his death and his life and work have yet to be intensively studied.  Life   1770‚Äì1805: Early years, first visit to Paris and the Viennese period  Reicha was born in Prague. His father ≈†imon, the town piper of the city, died when Anton was just 10 months old. Apparently Reicha's mother was not interested in her son's education, and so in 1780 he ran away from home following a sudden impulse ‚Äì as he recounted in his memoirs, he jumped onto a passing carriage. He first visited his paternal grandfather in Klatovy, and then his paternal uncle Josef Reicha, a virtuoso cellist, conductor and composer living in Wallerstein, Bavaria, who adopted him. Josef and his wife, being childless, could give young Anton their full attention: Josef taught him violin and piano, his wife insisted on his being taught French and German, and he was also taught the flute. In 1785 the family moved to Bonn, where Reicha became a member of the Hofkapelle of Max Franz, Elector of Cologne, playing violin and second flute in the court orchestra under his uncle's direction. The young Beethoven entered the Hofkapelle as violist and organist in 1789 and Reicha befriended him. Christian Gottlob Neefe, one of the most important figures in the musical life of the city at the time, may well have instructed both Reicha and his gifted piano pupil Beethoven in composition and introduced them to the works of Johann Sebastian Bach, such as The Well-Tempered Clavier. From about 1785 Reicha studied composition secretly, against his uncle's wishes, composing and conducting his first symphony in 1787 and entering the University of Bonn in 1789, where he studied and performed until 1794, when Bonn was attacked and captured by the French. He managed to escape to Hamburg, vowed never to perform in public again and began to earn a living teaching harmony, composition and piano. He continued composing and studied mathematics, philosophy and, significantly, methods of teaching composition. In 1799 he moved to Paris, hoping to achieve success as an opera composer. These hopes were dashed, however: he could neither get his old librettos accepted nor find suitable new ones despite support from friends and influential members of the aristocracy, and moved on to Vienna in 1801. Once there, like Beethoven and the young Schubert, he studied with Antonio Salieri and Johann Georg Albrechtsberger. Both were renowned teachers, and Albrechtsberger was also an important theorist and acknowledged authority on counterpoint and fugal theory. Reicha called on Haydn, whom he had met several times in Bonn and Hamburg during the 1790s, and renewed his friendship with Beethoven, whom he had not seen since 1792, when the latter moved from Bonn to Vienna. At this time (late 1802‚Äì3) Beethoven's Eroica symphony was in gestation, and it is likely that the two men exchanged ideas on fugues in modern composition. Reicha's move to Vienna marked the beginning of a more productive and successful period in his life. As he wrote in his memoirs, \\"The number of works I finished in Vienna is astonishing. Once started, my verve and imagination were indefatigable. Ideas came to me so rapidly it was often difficult to set them down without losing some of them. I always had a great penchant for doing the unusual in composition. When writing in an original vein, my creative faculties and spirit seemed keener than when following the precepts of my predecessors.\\"Reicha's autobiography, Notes sur Antoine Reicha, quoted in Ron Drummond, \\"Program Notes for a Performance of Anton√≠n Rejcha's C Minor String Quartet\\". In 1801, Reicha's opera L'ouragan, which failed in Paris, was performed at the palace of Prince Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz, a prominent patron of Beethoven. Empress Maria Theresa commissioned another opera after this performance, Argine, regina di Granata, which was only privately performed. His studies in Hamburg came to fruition here with the publication of several semi-didactic, encyclopedic works such as 36 Fugues for piano (published in 1803, dedicated to Haydn) and L'art de varier, a large- scale variation cycle (composed in 1803/04 for Prince Louis Ferdinand), and the treatise Practische Beispiele (published in 1803), which contained 24 compositions.  1806‚Äì36: Departure from Vienna and life in Paris  Reicha's life and career in Vienna were interrupted by Napoleon's November 1805 occupation of the city by French troops. In 1806 Reicha travelled to Leipzig to arrange a performance of his new work, the cantata Lenore (stopping at Prague to see his mother for the first time since 1780), but because Leipzig was blockaded by the French, not only was the performance cancelled but he could not return to Vienna for several months. When he did return it was not for long, because by 1808 the Austrian Empire was already preparing for another war, the War of the Fifth Coalition, so Reicha decided to move back to Paris. He was soon teaching composition privately, future prolific composer George Onslow being one of his pupils by 1808. This time three of his many operas were produced, but they all failed; yet his fame as theorist and teacher increased steadily, and by 1817 most of his pupils became professors at the Conservatoire de Paris. The following year, Reicha himself was appointed professor of counterpoint and fugue at the Conservatoire with the support of Louis XVIII, despite opposition from its influential professor of composition and (from 1822) director Luigi Cherubini P√®re Lachaise, Paris This second Paris period produced several important theoretical writings. Cours de composition musicale, published by 1818, became the standard text on composition at the Conservatoire; the Trait√© de m√©lodie of 1814, a treatise on melody, was also widely studied. Another semi-didactic work, 34 √âtudes for piano, was published by 1817. It was also in Paris that Reicha started composing the 25 wind quintets which proved to be his most enduring works: far more conservative musically than the experimental fugues he had written in Vienna, but exploiting the skill of his virtuosi from the Op√©ra Comique to extend significantly the technique and musical ambitions of future players of the still evolving wind instruments. In 1818 he married Virginie Enaust, who bore him two daughters. Around this time he taught composition to the future pioneer of the modern oboe Henri Brod, and in 1819 he began teaching harmony and music theory to Louise Farrenc; after interrupting her studies for her own marriage, she completed studies at the Paris Conservatory with Reicha in 1825. Reicha stayed in Paris for the rest of his life. He became a naturalized citizen of his adopted country in 1829 and Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur in 1835. That same year, he succeeded Fran√ßois-Adrien Boieldieu at the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. He published two more large treatises, Trait√© de haute composition musicale (1824‚Äì6) (Treatise on advanced musical composition) and Art du compositeur dramatique (1833) (Art of dramatic composition), on writing opera. His ideas expressed in the former work sparked some controversy at the Conservatoire. In 1826 Franz Liszt, Hector Berlioz and Henri Cohen became students of his, as did composers Charles Gounod and Pauline Viardot sometime later. Berlioz in his MemoirsBerlioz, Hector, translated by Cairns, David (1865, 1912, 2002). The Memoirs of Hector Berlioz. Hardback. Everyman's Library/Random House. (pp20‚Äì21) acknowledges that Reicha was 'an admirable teacher of counterpoint' who cared about his pupils and whose 'lessons were models of integrity and thoroughness' ‚Äì high praise indeed from one so critical of the Conservatoire in general. Fr√©d√©ric Chopin considered studying with him in 1829 shortly after arriving in Paris from his native Poland, but ultimately decided otherwise. From June 1835 until Reicha's death in May 1836, the young C√©sar Franck took private lessons. His notebooks survive (in the Biblioth√®que Nationale in Paris) with Reicha's annotations (and a later cryptic comment possibly by Erik Satie), showing how hard Reicha worked his 13-year-old pupil. Reicha was buried at the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery, and Luigi Cherubini resumed the teaching of counterpoint at the Conservatoire, replacing Reicha's heretical work on fugue with his own as the standard text.  Works  It is difficult to present a coherent list of Reicha's works, because the opus numbers assigned to them at the time of publication are in disarray, some pieces were supposedly lost, and many works were published several times, sometimes as part of larger collections. His surviving oeuvre covers a vast array of genres and forms, from opera to piano fugues. He is best known today for his 25 wind quintets, composed in Paris between 1811 and 1820, which were mostly premiered from 1817 in the foyer of the Th√©√¢tre Favart by some of the world's finest wind soloists, to such effect that they were played all over Europe shortly afterward. Reicha claimed in his memoirs that his wind quintets filled a void: \\"At that time, there was a dearth not only of good classic[al] music, but of any good music at all for wind instruments, simply because the composers knew little of their technique.\\"Reicha's autobiography, Notes sur Antoine Reicha, quoted in Bill McGlaughlin's \\"A World Of Winds: Making Your Own Quintet ‚Äì The Father of the Wind Quintet\\", see Indeed, Reicha's experiences as a flautist must have helped in the creation of these pieces, in which he systematically explored the possibilities of the wind ensemble and invented an extended sonata form variant that could accommodate as many as five principal themes.Ron Drummond, \\"Anton Reicha: A Biographical Sketch\\" Reicha wrote his first experimental quintet in 1811; the 'incomparably superior' first two of the later published quintets of Opus 88 were written by 1814 after further study of the instruments and collaboration with his players, with the remaining four completed before publication in 1817. Three further sets of six were published as Opus 91 in 1818, Opus 99 in 1819 and Opus 100 in 1820. The final piano exercise of Reicha's Op. 30, featuring two staves of music for each hand, and four different clefs Musically, the wind quintets represent a more conservative trend in Reicha's oeuvre when compared to his earlier work, namely the compositions of the Viennese period. In the quintets, as he describes in his preface, Reicha wanted to expand the technical limits of the five still evolving wind instruments (hand horn, 'un- rationalised' flute and clarinet, double reeds with fewer keys), and thereby also the ambitions of amateur wind players, by establishing a nucleus for a corpus of substantial work like that available to string players (and consciously more serious than the Harmoniemusik of the last century). His writing combines virtuoso display (often still very challenging today, yet idiomatic for each instrument), popular elements (from the comic opera his soloists played, from his Bohemian folk heritage, from the military background to his life ‚Äì many marches, 'walking' themes and fanfares), and his lifelong more academic interests in variation form and counterpoint. Four of the quintets have trios in passacaglia form, the repeating theme however being on different instruments in each case so not necessarily in the bass. The earlier Beethoven connection, now severed, is revisited in the scherzo of the quintet in E-flat Op. 100 no. 3, which contains clear musical quotations (most obvious in the horn part) from both the scherzo of his Eroica (also in E-flat major) and the first movement of his 5th symphonies. Berlioz says the quintets \\"enjoyed a certain vogue in Paris for a number of years. They are interesting pieces but a little cold\\", while Louis Spohr, who was visiting Paris in 1820-21 and reserved judgment until he had heard several performed, assessed them in a letter home (which he included in his autobiography) as having too many ideas linked carelessly or not at all (\\"were he less rich, he would be richer\\"), \\"yet the minuets and scherzi, as short pieces, are less open to this objection, and some of them are real masterpieces in form and contents\\". Spohr was generally impressed by the virtuosity of the wind soloists and was very pleased with their performance of his own piano and wind quintet. Berlioz also comments on two of the players (in other works): \\", the first flute...has to dominate...so he transposes the flute line up an octave, thus destroying the composer's intention\\" (p. 56); of Gustave Vogt's cor anglais playing he says (p. 23): \\"However remarkable the singer...I find it hard to believe she can ever have made it sound as natural and touching as it did on Vogt's instrument\\". Reicha was particularly close personally to the horn player L-F Dauprat, whom he nominated in his will as an executor and supplementary guardian to his two daughters. Technical wizardry also prevails in compositions that illustrate Reicha's theoretical treatise Practische Beispiele (Practical Examples) of 1803, where techniques such as bitonality and polyrhythm are explored in extremely difficult sight-reading exercises. 36 fugues for piano, published in 1803, was conceived as an illustration of Reicha's neue Fugensystem, i.e. those new ideas about fugues which had piqued Beethoven. Reicha proposed that second entries of fugue subjects in major keys could occur in keys other than the standard dominant), to widen the possibilities for modulations and undermine the conservative tonal stability of the fugue. The fugues of the collection not only illustrate this point, but also employ a variety of extremely convoluted technical tricks such as polyrhythm (no. 30), combined (nos. 24, 28), asymmetrical (no. 20) and simply uncommon (no. 10 is in 12/4, no. 12 in 2/8) meters and time signatures, some of which are derived from folk music, an approach that directly anticipates that of later composers such as B√©la Bart√≥k.V√°clav Jan S√Ωkora. Preface to an edition of 36 Fugues for Piano, Kassel: B√§renreiter, 1973, #19117‚Äì119. No. 13 is a modal fugue played on white keys only, in which cadences are possible on all but the 7th degree of the scale without further alteration. Six fugues employ two subjects, one has three, and No. 15 has six. In several of the fugues, Reicha established a link with the old tradition by using subjects by Haydn (no. 3), Bach (no. 5), Mozart (no. 7), Scarlatti (no. 9), Frescobaldi (no. 14) and Handel (no. 15). Many of the technical accomplishments are unique to fugue literature. Fugue No. 15 from 36 Fugues of 1803 features six subjects developed simultaneously The √©tudes of op. 97, √âtudes dans le genre fugu√©, published in Paris by 1817, are similarly advanced. Each composition is preceded by Reicha's comments for young composers. Thirty of the 34 √©tudes included are fugues, and every √©tude is preceded by a prelude based on a particular technical or compositional problem. Again an exceptionally large number of forms and textures is used, including, for example, the variation form with extensive use of invertible counterpoint (no. 3), or an Andante in C minor based on the famous Folia harmonic progression. Reicha's massive cycle of variations, L'art de varier, uses the same pedagogical principle and includes variations in the form of four-voice fugues, program music variations, toccata-like hand-crossing variations, etc., foreshadowing in many aspects not only Beethoven's Diabelli Variations, but also works by Schubert, Wagner and Debussy.Jan Racek. Foreword to the critical edition of \\"L'art de varier\\", Praha: St√°tn√≠ hudebn√≠ vydavatelstv√≠, 1961 Many of Reicha's string quartets are similarly advanced, and also anticipate numerous later developments. The eight Vienna string quartets (1801‚Äì5) are among his most important works. Though largely ignored since Reicha's death, they were highly influential during his lifetime and left their mark on the quartets of Beethoven and Schubert,Ron Drummond: \\"The String Quartets of Anton Reicha ‚Äì Introduction\\" much as Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier was ignored by the public but well known to Beethoven and Chopin. Reicha also wrote prolifically for various kinds of ensembles other than wind quintets and string quartets, including violin sonatas, piano trios, horn trios, flute quartets, various works for solo wind or string instruments accompanied by strings, and works for voice. He also wrote in larger-scale genres, including at least eight known symphonies, seven operas, and choral works such as a Requiem. Much of Reicha's music remained unpublished and/or unperformed during his life, and virtually all of it fell into obscurity after his death. This is partly explained by Reicha's own decisions he reflected on in his autobiography: \\"Many of my works have never been heard because of my aversion to seeking performances [...] I counted the time spent in such efforts as lost, and preferred to remain at my desk.\\" He also frequently advocated ideas, such as the use of quarter tones, that were too far ahead of his time to be understood by his contemporaries.  Writings  Reicha's major theoretical and pedagogical works include the following: * Practische Beispiele: ein Beitrag zur Geistescultur des Tonsetzers ... begleitet mit philosophisch-practischen Anmerkungen (1803), a didactic work that includes 25 sight-reading exercises of extreme difficulty, some of which were later published separately or in collections such as the 36 fugues. The exercises are divided into three groups: one for polyrhythm, one for polytonality and one that included exercises written on four staves and so required knowledge of the alto and tenor clefs. * ' (Paris, 1814), on melody, translated into German by Czerny * ' (1818), on composition, translated into German by Czerny (From Chapter 9 of Czerny's Letters to a Young Lady: \\"My view was only to give you a general idea of Harmony or Thorough Bass; and when you begin the study of it in a regular manner - and I hear with pleasure that you are shortly about to do so, and that your worthy teacher has selected for the purpose the excellent Treatise on Harmony by Reicha...\\") * ' (2 vols. 1824‚Äì1826), translated into German by Czerny around 1835. In this late treatise Reicha expressed some of his most daring ideas, such as the use of quarter tones and folk music (which was almost completely neglected at the time). An article in this treatise deals with the problem of irregular resolution of dissonant chords, formulating a simple law for its successful employment; this article was so innovative and celebrated, that it was published even by itself in the past and in the present, the latest English translation being the one by Lorenzo M. A. Giorgi (A new theory for the resolution of discords, according to the Modern Musical System, 2017). * ' (4 vols., 1833), on the writing of opera. Provides an exhaustive account of contemporary performance techniques and is supplemented with examples from Reicha's own operas. In addition to these, a number of smaller texts by him exist. These include an outline of Reicha's system for writing fugues, √úber das neue Fugensystem (published as a foreword to the 1805 edition of 36 fugues), Sur la musique comme art purement sentimental (before 1814, literally \\"On music as a purely emotional art\\"), Petit trait√© d'harmonie pratique √† 2 parties (c. 1814, a short \\"practical treatise\\" on harmony), a number of articles and the poem An Joseph Haydn, published in the preface to 36 fugues (which were dedicated to Haydn).

It is also called the Jacobite War in Ireland or the Williamite‚ÄìJacobite War in Ireland. The proximate cause of the war was the Glorious Revolution of 1688, in which James, a Catholic, was overthrown as king of England, Ireland and Scotland and replaced by his Protestant daughter Mary and nephew and son-in-law William, ruling as joint monarchs. James's supporters initially retained control of Ireland, which he hoped to use as a base for a campaign to reclaim all three kingdoms. The conflict in Ireland also involved long-standing domestic issues of land ownership, religion and civic rights; most Irish Catholics supported James in the hope he would address their grievances. A small number of English and Scottish Catholics, and Protestants of the established Church in Ireland, also fought on the Jacobite side, while most Irish Protestants supported or actively fought for William's regime. While the war's Irish name emphasises its aspect as a domestic conflict between James and William, some contemporaries and many modern commentators have viewed it as part of a wider European conflict known as the Nine Years' War or War of the Grand Alliance in which William, as Stadtholder of the Dutch Republic, led a multi-national coalition against France under Louis XIV. William's deposition of James was partly driven by his need to control and mobilise English military and commercial power, while Louis provided limited material support to the Jacobites: both sides were aware of the Irish war's potential to divert military resources from the Continent. The war began with a series of skirmishes between James's Irish Army, which had stayed loyal in 1688, and militia forces raised by Irish Protestants: they culminated in the Siege of Derry, where the Jacobites failed to regain control of one of the north's key towns. William landed a force including English, Scottish, Dutch, Danish and other troops to put down Jacobite resistance. James left Ireland after a reverse at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, as did William after a successful Jacobite defence of Limerick; the remaining Jacobite forces were decisively defeated at the Battle of Aughrim in 1691, and negotiated terms in the Treaty of Limerick. A contemporary witness, George Story, calculated that the war had claimed 100,000 lives through sickness, famine, and in battle. Subsequent Jacobite risings were confined to Scotland and England, but the war was to have a lasting effect on the political and cultural landscape of Ireland, confirming British and Protestant rule over the country for over two centuries. While the Treaty of Limerick had offered a series of guarantees to Catholics, subsequent extension of the Penal Laws, particularly during the War of the Spanish Succession, would further erode their civic rights. The Williamite victories at Derry and the Boyne are still celebrated by some, mostly Ulster Protestant, unionists in Ireland today. Background; Glorious Revolution James II & VII In March 1689, James II & VII landed in Ireland with French military support, seeking to regain the thrones of England, Ireland and Scotland, after being deposed in the 1688 Glorious Revolution. Despite his Catholicism, James became king in 1685 with widespread support in all three kingdoms, due to fear of civil war if he were bypassed; by 1688, it seemed only his removal could prevent one. When the Parliaments of Scotland and England refused to pass measures of tolerance for Catholics and Nonconformists in 1685, James suspended them and thereafter ruled by decree. His increasingly authoritarian approach undercut his supporters and caused great concern but it took two events in June 1688 for dissent to turn into a crisis. On the 10th, the birth of James Francis Edward created a Catholic heir and excluded James' Protestant daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange. The prosecution of the Seven Bishops for seditious libel was seen as an assault on the Church of England and their acquittal on 30 June destroyed James' political authority in England and Scotland. In Europe, the Dutch Republic and its allies were on the brink of war with France, which made securing English resources vital. French troops attacked the Rhineland in late September, launching the 1688‚Äì1697 Nine Years' War; on 5 November, William landed in South-West England, James' army deserted and he fled to France on 23 December. Earl of Tyrconnell, Lord Deputy and James' chief lieutenant in Ireland There was wider support for James in Ireland, where around 75% of the population were Catholic, although in Ulster Protestants comprised nearly 50%. James's associate Richard Talbot, Earl of Tyrconnell became Lord Deputy of Ireland in 1687 and began a rapid programme of appointing Catholics to the army and other public offices. By February 1689, the Irish army was almost exclusively Catholic, albeit poorly equipped, half-trained and unpaid. However, a long-standing problem for the Stuarts was that while Irish Catholics were one of their main bases of support, concessions threatened Protestant support in all three kingdoms, especially England. Reversing the land confiscations of the 1650s was non-negotiable for Irish Catholics, whose ownership declined from 90% in 1600 to 22% by 1685, but changes were viewed with extreme hostility by the Protestants who were its beneficiaries. Pre-1688, this meant James often backed Protestants in disputes over land, and adopted commercial policies favouring English, rather than Irish, merchants. As a result, the 1662 Settlement made few changes and primarily benefited the Old English Catholic elite. This faction, led by Tyrconnell's brother-in-law, the Earl of Limerick, feared they would lose from a war either way, and preferred a minimalist solution that was rejected by the majority. Finally, demands for Irish autonomy clashed with Stuart ideology, first set out by James VI and I in 1603, which his successors followed with great consistency, including Prince Charles in 1745. It envisaged a unitary state of England, Scotland and Ireland, ruled by a monarch whose authority came from God and where the role of Parliament and the church was to obey. Like Louis XIV, James claimed the right to appoint Catholic bishops and clergy in his kingdoms, an alteration to existing practice that caused conflict with Pope Innocent XI. Innocent's family bank lent William money, a fact kept secret for over three centuries, but his opposition also impacted support from other Catholic leaders. On 13 April 1689, Louis wrote to D'Avaux that \\"the Pope sets so bad an example to all the other Catholic princes, we can scarcely hope [for their help]\\". 1688‚Äì1689: the North James was so confident of Ireland that in September he ordered 2,500 troops, or around 40% of the Irish army, transferred to England. This deprived Tyrconnell of vital trained personnel, while their presence led to near mutiny in several of James' most reliable English units. Many of the Irish rank and file were arrested after William's landing and later sent to serve under Emperor Leopold in the Austrian‚ÄìOttoman War. News of the landing was greeted with Williamite demonstrations in Belfast, offset by a more cautious response elsewhere. Arthur Rawdon, who later organised the Army of the North, had offered to fight for James against Monmouth in 1685 and did not commit to William until March 1689. Protestants were concentrated in Ulster and urban centres such as Sligo and Dublin, which Tyrconnell sought to secure with Catholic units of the Irish army. Enniskillen Castle Catholic troops under the Earl of Antrim were refused entry to Derry on 7 December, Enniskillen doing the same a few days later. A significant factor was the unsettled political situation; Derry's Protestant leaders simultaneously declared their \\"duty and loyalty to our sovereign lord, the King\\" and the siege did not begin until April. Many Irish Protestants initially appealed to James for protection, not William. Apparently shaken by the speed of James's fall, Tyrconnell opened negotiations with William, although this may have been a delaying tactic. His wife, Frances Talbot, was the elder sister of Sarah Churchill, whose husband Marlborough was a key member of the English military conspiracy against James. One of those transferred to England in September was Richard Hamilton, an Irish Catholic professional soldier. Confined in the Tower of London after James' flight, in January William sent him to negotiate with Tyrconnell, a mission he abandoned once back in Ireland. In January, warrants were issued for the recruitment of another 40,000 levies, almost entirely Catholic and organised along standard regimental lines. By spring 1689, the army theoretically had around 36,000 men, although experienced officers remained in short supply. Paying, equipping and training this number was impossible and many were organised as Rapparees or irregulars, largely beyond Tyrconnell's control. Despite assurances of protection, the easiest way to obtain supplies or money was to confiscate it from Protestants; many fled to the North or England, spreading \\"predictions of impending catastrophe\\". Control of Eastern Ulster (bottom left) allowed direct communication with western Scotland Fears grew as areas outside the towns became increasingly lawless, exacerbated when Dublin Castle ordered Protestant militia to be disarmed. This caused an exodus from the countryside; the population of Derry grew from 2,500 in December to over 30,000 by April. Doubts over the ability of Tyrconnell's regime to ensure law and order was not confined to Protestants; many Catholics also sought security abroad or in large towns. On 8 March, the English Parliament approved funding for an Irish expeditionary force of 22,230 men, composed of new levies and European mercenaries. James landed in Kinsale on 12 March, accompanied by French regulars under de Rosen, along with English, Scottish and Irish volunteers. Hamilton was appointed Jacobite commander in the North and on 14 March secured eastern Ulster by routing a Williamite militia at Dromore. On 11 April, Viscount Dundee launched a Jacobite rising in Scotland; on 18th, James joined the siege of Derry and on 29th, the French landed another 1,500‚Äì3,000 Jacobites at Bantry Bay. When reinforcements from England reached Derry in mid-April, governor Robert Lundy advised them to return, claiming the city was indefensible. Their commanders, Richards and Cunningham, were dismissed by William for cowardice and Lundy fled the town in disguise. Carrickfergus Castle; its surrender on 27 August ended the Jacobite presence in the North By spring 1689, the new regime was threatened by Jacobite advances in Ireland and Western Scotland. William viewed Ireland as a French proxy invasion, best dealt with by attacking France; he reluctantly agreed to divert resources only because 'abandoning' beleaguered Irish Protestants was politically unacceptable in England and Scotland. On the other hand, French involvement in Ireland was a key factor in England's decision to join the Grand Alliance and become part of the wider European war. The Jacobite focus on western Ulster, specifically Derry and Enniskillen, was a strategic error. Control of eastern Ulster was of greater significance, since it allowed mutual support between Irish and Scots Jacobites and made resupply from England far more difficult. By mid May, the Williamite position had improved; on 16th, government forces retained control of Kintyre, cutting direct links between Scotland and Ireland. The main Jacobite army was stuck outside Derry, its French contingent proving more unpopular with their Irish colleagues than their opponents. On 11 June, four battalions of Williamite reinforcements under the tough and experienced Percy Kirke arrived on the Foyle, north of Derry. Schomberg (1615‚Äì1690), Williamite commander in Ireland; immensely experienced, he was a Marshal of France, England and Portugal. The war in the North turned on three events in the last week of July. Dundee's victory at Killiecrankie on 27th was offset by his own death and heavy losses among his troops, ending the Scottish rising as a serious threat. On the 28th, Kirke's forces broke the Jacobite blockade with naval support and raised the siege of Derry; the besiegers fired the surrounding countryside and retreated south. On the 31st, a Jacobite attack on Enniskillen was defeated at Newtownbutler; over 1,500 men were killed and its leader Mountcashel captured. From a position of virtual domination, the Jacobites lost their hold on Ulster within a week. On 13 August, Schomberg landed in Belfast Lough with the main Williamite army; by the end of the month, he had more than 20,000 men. Carrickfergus fell on 27 August; James insisted on holding Dundalk, against the advice of his French advisors who wanted to retreat beyond the Shannon. Tyrconnell was pessimistic about their chances but an opportunity for Schomberg to end the war by taking Dundalk was missed, largely due to a complete failure of logistics. Ireland was a relatively poor country with a small population, obliging both armies to depend on external support. While this ultimately proved a greater problem for the Jacobites, Schomberg's men lacked tents, coal, food and clothing, largely because his inexperienced commissary agent in Chester could not charter enough ships. This was worsened by choosing a campsite on low, marshy ground, which autumn rains and lack of hygiene quickly turned into a stinking swamp. Nearly 6,000 men died from disease before Schomberg ordered a withdrawal into winter quarters in November. Inspecting the abandoned camp, John Stevens, an English Catholic serving with the Grand Prior's Regiment, recorded that \\"besides the infinite number of graves a vast number of dead bodies was found there unburied, and not a few yet breathing but almost devoured with lice and other vermin. This spectacle not a little astonished such of our men as ventured in amongst them\\". Jacobite political and strategic objectives 1689-1690 d'Avaux, whose relationship with the Irish was one of mutual mistrust and dislike The Jacobites were undermined by differing political and strategic objectives, reflected in the Irish Parliament that sat from May to July. Since no elections were held in Fermanagh and Donegal, the Commons was 70 members short and largely composed of Catholics; of these, a minority were Gaelic- speakers or 'Old Irish, the majority being Old English. Five Protestant peers and four Church of Ireland bishops sat in the Lords, with Anthony Dopping, Bishop of Meath acting as leader of the opposition. Dubbed the \\"Patriot Parliament\\" by 19th century nationalist historian Charles Duffy, in reality it was deeply divided. James viewed the English throne as his main objective and every concession made in Ireland potentially weakened his position in England and Scotland. In the early stages of the war, Protestant Jacobite support was more significant than often appreciated and included many members of the established Church of Ireland, the most prominent being Viscount Mountjoy. His opposition to Irish autonomy meant James made concessions with great reluctance and despite his own Catholicism, insisted on the rights of the established church. Tyrconnell viewed the restoration of James as secondary to an autonomous Ireland, although there is little evidence to support suggestions he held talks with Louis XIV on a French-backed satellite state. He represented the minority of Catholics who benefited from the 1662 Land Settlement and had no desire to change it; led by the Earl of Limerick, this faction urged a compromise settlement with William in January. This placed them in opposition to the Old Irish, a majority in the country but a minority in Parliament, whose main demand was restoration of lands confiscated after the Cromwellian conquest. Significant factions within the Irish Parliament preferred to negotiate, which meant avoiding combat to preserve the army and retain as much territory as possible. Since England was his main objective, James saw Ireland as a distraction; a cross-Channel invasion was the only viable option and the French suggestion of doing so via the Irish Sea ignored reality. First, history showed involving Ireland was the best way to strengthen English opposition; this meant victory might actually weaken his chances, although as James pointed out, the French provided only enough to keep the war going, not win it. Second, the French navy could neither save Ulster or even supply their own forces, making it unlikely they could control the Irish Sea long enough to land troops in the face of a hostile population. Peripheral rebellions in Ireland and Scotland were a cost-effective way for France to divert British resources from Europe. This meant prolonging the war was more useful than winning it, although potentially devastating for the local populace, a dilemma that resurfaced in the 1745 Scottish Rising. In 1689, the French envoy d'Avaux urged the Jacobites to withdraw beyond the Shannon, first destroying everything in between, including Dublin. Unsurprisingly, this suggestion was rejected, while the Irish were united in their dislike of the French in general and d'Avaux in particular. The feeling was mutual; when replaced in April 1690, d'Avaux told his successor Lauzun the Irish were 'a poor-spirited and cowardly people, whose soldiers never fight and whose officers will never obey orders.' 1690: the Boyne and Limerick In April 1690, an additional 6,000 French regulars arrived, in exchange for Mountcashel and 5,387 of the Irish army's best troops, who were sent to France. To retain as much territory as possible, the Jacobites held a line along the River Boyne, first destroying or removing crops and livestock to the north. This reduced the local population to utter misery; a French official recorded his horror at seeing them \\"eating grass like horses\\" or lying dead at the roadside. It took over fifty years for the area around Drogheda to recover from this devastation. Faced by English demands to resolve the position in Ireland, William decided to take personal command and commit the majority of his available forces there, irrespective of the military situation in Flanders. On 14 June 1690, 300 ships arrived in Belfast Lough carrying nearly 31,000 men, a combination of Dutch, English and Danish regiments. Parliament backed him with increased funding and the issues faced by Schomberg were remedied, transportation costs alone rising from ¬£15,000 in 1689 to over ¬£100,000 in 1690. The Boyne; an indecisive Williamite victory, in which Schomberg was killed (bottom right) The Jacobites established defensive positions on the south bank of the Boyne at Oldbridge, outside Drogheda. On 1 July, William crossed the river in several places, forcing them to retreat but the battle was not decisive. Total dead on both sides was under 2,000, one being Schomberg; weakened by desertion, the Jacobite army retreated to Limerick and William entered Dublin unopposed. Elsewhere, victory at Fleurus on 1 July gave the French control of Flanders; on the same day as the Boyne, they defeated a combined Anglo-Dutch fleet at Beachy Head, causing panic in England. As a former English naval commander, James recognised control of the Channel was a rare opportunity and returned to France to urge an immediate invasion. However, the French failed to follow up their victory and by August, the Anglo-Dutch fleet had regained command of the sea. Tyrconnell had spent the winter of 1689 to 1690 urging Louis XIV to support a \\"descent on England\\" and avoid fighting on Irish soil. His requests were rejected; an invasion required enormous expenditure and Louis trusted neither James nor his English supporters. While there were sound strategic reasons for his hurried departure, which were backed by his senior commanders, James has gone down in Irish history as or \\"James the beshitten/coward\\". An opportunity to end the war was missed when William overestimated the strength of his position. The Declaration of Finglas of 17 July excluded Jacobite officers and the Catholic landed class from a general pardon, encouraging them to continue fighting. Shortly afterwards, James Douglas and 7,500 men tried to break the Jacobite defensive line along the Shannon by taking Athlone; they lacked siege artillery and were forced to withdraw. King John's Castle and Thomond Bridge at Limerick City. Limerick was besieged by the Williamites in 1690 and 1691. Limerick, strategic key to the west of Ireland, became William's next objective, the Jacobites concentrating the bulk of their forces in the city. A detachment under Marlborough captured Cork and Kinsale but Limerick repulsed a series of assaults, inflicting heavy casualties. Cavalry raids led by Patrick Sarsfield destroyed William's artillery train and heavy rain prevented replacements. Faced by multiple threats in mainland Europe, William withdrew and left Ireland in late 1690, the Jacobites retaining large parts of western Ireland. Dutch general de Ginkell assumed command, based at Kilkenny, with Douglas in Ulster and the Danes under W√ºrttemberg at Waterford. Protestant administration was re-established in the counties held by Williamites, with arrests and confiscation of Jacobite estates, intended to reward William's supporters. Ginkel pointed out doing so in cash, not land, was cheaper than a month of war and urged more generous terms. On 24 July, a letter from James confirmed ships were on their way to evacuate the French brigade and any others who wanted to leave; he also released his Irish officers from their oaths, allowing them to seek a negotiated end to the war. Tyrconnell and the French troops sailed from Galway in early September; James's inexperienced illegitimate son Berwick was left in command, supported by a council of officers composed of Thomas Maxwell, Dominic Sheldon, John Hamilton and Sarsfield. Tyrconnell hoped to obtain sufficient French support to extend the conflict and gain better terms, which he told Louis could be done with limited numbers of French troops. A negotiated peace also required him to reduce the influence of the pro-war party, led by Sarsfield, who was increasingly popular with the army. He told James the pro-war group wanted Irish autonomy or even independence, while he wished to see Ireland linked firmly to England; to do so, he needed arms, money and an 'experienced' French general to replace Sarsfield and Berwick. 1691: Athlone, Aughrim and the Second Siege of Limerick Dutch general Ginkell; he advocated a cautious approach and attempted to end Jacobite resistance by offering a revised peace settlement. By late 1690, divisions between the Jacobite \\"Peace Party\\" and \\"War Party\\" had widened. Those who supported Tyrconnell's efforts to negotiate with William included senior officers Thomas Maxwell and John Hamilton, in addition to political figures such as Lord Riverston and Denis Daly. Sarsfield's \\"War Party\\" argued William could still be defeated; while once characterised as representing the 'Old Irish' interest, its leaders included the English officer Dorrington and 'Old English' Purcell and Luttrell. Encouraged by William's failure to take Limerick and looking to reduce Tyrconnell's influence, Sarsfield's faction appealed directly to Louis XIV requesting that Tyrconnell and Berwick were removed from office. They also asked for substantial French military aid, although this was unlikely as the French regime saw Flanders, the Rhine, and Italy as greater strategic priorities. Ginkell had finally obtained William's permission to offer the Jacobites moderate terms of surrender, including a guarantee of religious toleration, but when in December the \\"Peace Party\\" made moves to accept, Sarsfield demanded that Berwick have Hamilton, Riverston and Daly arrested. Berwick complied, although likely with the tacit approval of Tyrconnell, who returned from France to try and regain control by offering Sarsfield concessions. Deeply alarmed by the rift between his Irish supporters, James was persuaded to request further military support directly from Louis. Louis dispatched general the Marquis de St Ruth to replace Berwick as commander of the Irish Army, with secret instructions to assess the situation and help Louis make a decision on whether to send additional military aid. St Ruth, accompanied by lieutenant-generals de Tess√© and d'Usson, arrived at Limerick on 9 May; they brought sufficient arms, corn and meal to sustain the army until the autumn, but no troops or money. By late spring, concerned that a French convoy could land further reinforcements at Galway or Limerick, Ginkell began making preparations to enter the field as quickly as possible. During May, both sides began assembling their forces for a summer campaign, the Jacobites at Limerick and the Williamites at Mullingar, while low-level skirmishing continued. On 16 June, Ginkell's cavalry began reconnoitring from Ballymore towards Athlone. St Ruth had initially strung out his forces behind the line of the Shannon, but by 19 June he realised Athlone was the target and began concentrating his troops west of the town. Ginkell breached the Jacobite lines of defence and took Athlone on 30 June after a short but bloody siege, taking Maxwell prisoner; St Ruth failed in his attempts to relieve the garrison and fell back to the west. Athlone was seen as a significant victory for William's forces, as it was believed that St Ruth's army would probably collapse if the Shannon was crossed. The Lords Justice in Dublin issued a proclamation offering generous terms for Jacobites who surrendered, including a free pardon, restoration of forfeited estates, and the offer of similar or higher rank and pay if they wished to join William's army. The Jacobite command fell apart in mutual recriminations: Sarsfield's faction accused Maxwell, a follower of Tyrconnell, of treachery, while St Ruth's subordinate d'Usson sided with Tyrconnell, who appointed him governor of Galway. Memorial cross on the site of the Battle of Aughrim, where 7000 men died on 12 July 1691 and the Jacobite cause in Ireland was defeated Unaware of the location of St Ruth's main army and assuming he was outnumbered, on 10 July Ginkell continued a cautious advance through Ballinasloe down the main Limerick and Galway road. St Ruth's initial plan, endorsed by Tyrconnell, had been to fall back on Limerick and force the Williamites into another year of campaigning, but wishing to redeem his errors at Athlone he appears to have instead decided to force a decisive battle. Ginkell, with 20,000 men, found his way blocked by St Ruth's similarly sized army at Aughrim on the early morning of 12 July. Despite a brave and tenacious defence by the inexperienced Irish infantry, the Battle of Aughrim would see St Ruth dead, many senior Jacobite officers captured or killed, and the Jacobite army shattered. D'Usson succeeded as overall commander: he surrendered Galway on 21 July, on advantageous terms. Following Aughrim the remnants of St Ruth's army retreated to the mountains before regrouping under Sarsfield's command at Limerick, where the defences were still in the process of being repaired: many of the Jacobite infantry regiments were seriously depleted, although some stragglers arrived later. Tyrconnell, who had been sick for some time, died at Limerick shortly afterwards, depriving the Jacobites of their main negotiator. Sarsfield and the Jacobites' main army surrendered at Limerick in October after a short siege. Treaty of Limerick and aftermath Sarsfield, now the senior Jacobite commander, and Ginkell signed the Treaty of Limerick on 3 October 1691. It promised that Catholics would remain free to practice their religion and gave legal protection to any Jacobites willing to stay in Ireland and give an oath of loyalty to William and Mary, although the estates of those killed prior to the treaty were still liable to forfeiture. The treaty also agreed to Sarsfield's demand that those still serving in the Jacobite army could leave for France. Popularly known in Ireland as the \\"Flight of the Wild Geese\\", the process began almost immediately, using English ships sailing from Cork; French ships completed it by December. Modern estimates suggest that around 19,000 soldiers and rapparees departed: women and children brought the figure to slightly over 20,000, or about one per cent of Ireland's population. Story alleged that some of the soldiers had to be forced on board the ships when they learned they would be joining the French. Most were unable to bring or to contact their families and many appear to have deserted en route from Limerick to Cork. The \\"Wild Geese\\" were initially formed into James II's army in exile. After James's death, they were merged into France's Irish Brigade, which had been set up in 1689 using the 6,000 troops accompanying Mountcashel. Disbanded Jacobites still presented a considerable risk to security in Ireland and despite resistance from the English and Irish parliaments, William continued to encourage them to join his own army; by the end of 1693 a further 3,650 former Jacobites had joined William's forces fighting on the Continent. The Lord Lieutenant Viscount Sidney eventually restricted enlistment to \\"known Protestants\\", upon which the last remnants of the Jacobite army still in Ireland were sent home with a financial inducement to keep the peace. In the interim the English legislature, possibly acting under pressure from Irish Protestant refugees in London, passed a 1691 Act \\"for the Abrogating the Oath of Supremacy in Ireland and Appointing other Oaths\\". This required anyone taking the Oath of Supremacy, such as when practising law, as a physician, or when taking a seat in the Irish Parliament, to deny transubstantiation; it effectively barred all Catholics, although included a clause exempting beneficiaries of the articles of Limerick in some circumstances. Despite this, many Protestants were initially outraged by their perception that the treaty had left the Jacobites \\"immune to the penalties of defeat\\". The fact that the administration chose to forbid searches for Jacobite arms and horses in order to prevent the settling of private scores was taken as evidence of pro- Catholic bias, and it was even rumoured that the Lord Chancellor Sir Charles Porter was a \\"secret Jacobite\\". Continuing fears over Catholics' potential support of a French invasion and the appointment in 1695 of Capell as Lord Deputy saw a change of attitude. The same year, the Irish Parliament passed the Disarming Act, forbidding Catholics other than the Limerick and Galway 'articlemen' to own a weapon or a horse worth more than ¬£5. A second 1695 bill, designed to deter Irish Catholics \\"from their foreign correspondency and dependency\\" and aimed particularly at the country's \\"English ancient families\\", restrained Catholics from educating their children abroad. Catholic gentry saw such actions as a serious breach of faith, summed up by the phrase (\\"remember Limerick and Saxon perfidy\\") supposedly used in later years by the exiles of the Irish Brigade. However, despite later extension of the penal laws, the 'articlemen' of Limerick, Galway, Drogheda and other garrisons subject to Williamite articles of surrender generally stayed exempt for the remainder of their lives. Long-term effects The Williamite victory in the war in Ireland had two main long-term results. The first was that it ensured James II would not regain his thrones in England, Ireland, and Scotland by military means. The second was that it ensured closer British and Protestant dominance over Ireland. Until the nineteenth century, Ireland was ruled by what became known as the \\"Protestant Ascendancy\\", the mostly Protestant ruling class. The majority Irish Catholic community and the Ulster-Scots Presbyterian community were systematically excluded from power, which was based on land ownership. For over a century after the war, Irish Catholics maintained a sentimental attachment to the Jacobite cause, portraying James and the Stuarts as the rightful monarchs who would have given a just settlement to Ireland, including self-government, restoration of confiscated lands and tolerance for Catholicism. Thousands of Irish soldiers left the country to serve the Stuart monarchs in the Spanish and French armies. Until 1766 France and the Papacy remained committed to restoring the Stuarts to their British Kingdoms, at least one composite Irish battalion (500 men) drawn from Irish soldiers in the French service fought on the Jacobite side in the Scottish Jacobite uprisings up to the Battle of Culloden in 1746. The war also began the penetration of the Irish Protestant gentry into the British army's officer corps; by the 1770s Irish Protestants made up about one third of the officer corps as a whole, a number hugely disproportionate to their population. Protestants portrayed the Williamite victory as a triumph for religious and civil liberty. Triumphant murals of King William still controversially adorn gable walls in Ulster, and the defeat of the Catholics in the Williamite war are still commemorated by Protestant Unionists, by the Orange Order on the Twelfth of July.

It was used as a torpedo bomber by the mine- torpedo regiments of Soviet Naval Aviation between 1952‚Äì59 and exported to the People's Republic of China. Development The Tu-14 had its origin in the three-engined '73' design which used a pair of Rolls-Royce Nene turbojets under the wings and a single Rolls-Royce Derwent V in the tail, in an installation much like that of the central engine of a Boeing 727. The availability of the Klimov VK-1, a more-powerful version of the Nene, allowed the RD-500 to be deleted from the preliminary design, which was given the internal designation of \\"81\\". The other major change was the addition of a PSBN navigation radar which required a fifth crewmember to operate. This was rejected by the VVS and Tupolev reworked the design to eliminate the dorsal and ventral turrets and reduce the crew to only three, the pilot, a bombardier-navigator, and a tail gunner. It retained the two fixed Nudelman- Rikhter NR-23 cannon in the fuselage nose, but the design of the fuselage was changed to give the gunner his own separate pressurized compartment and a KDU-81 tail turret armed with another pair of NR-23 guns.Gordon & Rigamant, pp. 126‚Äì127 Construction of the prototype began in August 1949, using components from the canceled Tu-73S prototypes, and was completed in October. The manufacturer's tests were conducted between 13 October 1949 and 21 January 1950. Its State acceptance trials lasted from 23 January to 27 May 1950 and it was accepted for production, provided that the problems with the KDU-81 turret were resolved and that ejection seats were provided for the pilot and gunner, a hot air deicing was to be fitted and the gun mount in the nose revised. The first five preproduction aircraft did not incorporate these changes as they were built using Tu-73S components, after the factory in Irkutsk had prematurely begun production of that bomber. One of these was sent to Moscow where it was evaluated by Soviet Naval Aviation for use as a torpedo bomber. The sixth aircraft did incorporate all these changes as well as the navigator's ejection seat requested by Naval Aviation, and it was evaluated in May 1951. It was recommended for production as the Tu-14T and entered service in 1952 with Naval Aviation. About 150 were produced and served with the mine- torpedo regiments of Naval Aviation until 1959. It was given the NATO reporting name Bosun. After it was withdrawn from service, several were used for various test programs, including one evaluating ramjet engines.Gordon & Rigamant, p. 128 Up to 50 used Tu-14Ts were delivered to the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force although quantities and dates cannot be confirmed.Gunston, p. 142 The second preproduction Tu-14 was converted into a day or night photographic reconnaissance aircraft with the OKB designation of \\"89\\". The conversion was fairly minor and involved an unpressurized central cabin that housed two automatic pivoting cameras, two fuel tanks and another camera fitted in the bomb bay and another camera for oblique photography was mounted in the aircraft's tail for the daylight photography role. All cameras and their viewports were electrically heated to prevent misting and icing at altitude. For night photography, the fuel tanks and camera in the bomb bay were removed and a variety of flare bombs were carried to illuminate the targets. In addition, the screen of the PSBN-M navigation radar could be photographed by a special camera and both the pilot and navigator could record their own observations using a voice recorder. However, the VVS had already decided to use the Il-28R reconnaissance version of the standard Il-28 by the time that the \\"89\\" first flew on 23 March 1951 and Tupolev decided not to submit it for State acceptance trials.Gordon & Rigamant, p. 129 Variants *Tu-14 ‚Äì Light bomber version (not accepted for service). *Tu-14R ‚Äì Reconnaissance version (prototype only).

For example, Greek letter names are acrophonic: the names of the letters Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥, Œ¥, are spelled with the respective letters: (alpha), (beta), (gamma), (delta). The paradigm for acrophonic alphabets is the Proto- Sinaitic script and the succeeding Phoenician alphabet, in which the letter A, representing the sound , is thought to have derived from an Egyptian hieroglyph representing an ox, and is called \\"ox\\",  æalp, which starts with the glottal stop sound the letter represents. The Latin alphabet is descended from the Phoenician, and the stylized head of an ox can still be seen if the letter A is turned upside-down: ‚àÄ. The second letter of the Phoenician alphabet is bet (which means \\"house\\" and looks a bit like a shelter) representing the sound [b], and from ƒÅlep-bƒìt came the word \\"alphabet\\"another case where the beginning of a thing gives the name to the whole, which was in fact common practice in the ancient Near East. The Glagolitic and early Cyrillic alphabets, although not consisting of ideograms, also have letters named acrophonically. The letters representing /a, b, v, g, d, e/ are named Az, Buky, Vedi, Glagol, Dobro, Est. Naming the letters in order, one recites a poem, a mnemonic which helps students and scholars learn the alphabet: Az buky vedi, glagol‚Äô dobro est‚Äô means \\"I know letters, [the] word is good\\" in Old Church Slavonic. In Irish and Ogham, letters were formerly named after trees, for example A was ailm (white fir), B was beith (birch) and C was coll (hazel). The rune alphabets used by the Germanic peoples were also named acrophonically; for example, the first three letters, which represented the sounds /f, u, √æ/, were named f√©, ur, √æurs in Norse (wealth, slag/rain, giant) and feoh, ur, √æorn in Old English (wealth, ox, thorn). Both sets of names probably stemmed from Proto-Germanic *fehu, *uruz, *thurisaz. The Thai alphabet is learned acrophonically, each letter being represented pictorially in school-books (chicken, egg, ox, snake, bell, etc.). Rudyard Kipling gives a fictional description of the process in one of his Just So Stories, \\"How the Alphabet was Made.\\"Just So Stories, Rudyard Kipling Modern radiotelephony and aviation uses spelling alphabets (the best-known of which is the NATO Phonetic Alphabet, which begins with Alfa, Bravo, Charlie, Delta...) in which the letters of the English alphabet are arbitrarily assigned words and names in an acrophonic manner to avoid misunderstanding. Most notes of the solfege scalenamely re, mi, fa, sol, and laderive their names from the first syllable of the lines of Ut queant laxis, a Latin hymn.

They rise to 600 metres above the surrounding Southland Plains, of which the hills mark a northern extremity. The Hokonui forms part of the Southland Syncline, a geological fold system which extends northwestward from the coast at The Catlins.

The AMIEU was formed in 1906 as the Federated Butchers Union, and changed its name to the AMIEU in 1912. Its registered industrial coverage (per the 1906 registration) is \\"Butchering Meat Refrigerating and kindred industries.\\" (1906 AMIEU registration) The AMIEU elects all officials from the rank and file for four year terms, excepting the Federal President and Secretary who are elected by a collegiate system. Early history: the AMIEU and the Australian IWW The AMIEU was organised between 1906 and 1920, particularly in Queensland, by the revolutionary union the Industrial Workers of the World. The IWW, or Wobblies, encouraged Meatworkers to set up boards of control on job sites. These boards functioned, effectively, as works councils in the Meat industry. The boards were particularly strong in North Queensland where, under the direction of state organiser Walter Russell Crampton, they controlled production levels through direct action. Meat industry sheds in North Queensland were so effectively organised that the sheds became closed shops. This was known in the day as Preference of Employment. (1911 AMIEU Preference of Employment contract, AMEIU history, page 2) The AMEIU used the skilled portion of the workforce, the slaughtering gang, to infiltrate non-union towns in North Queensland. These towns were essentially company towns. The slaughtering gang was irreplaceable due to their skill, they were mobile as their skill was in demand across multiple shops, and they were militant. The AMIEU considered itself an industrial union and enrolled all workers in a particular workplace regardless of their trade‚Äîthe meatworkers represented boilermakers, engine drivers and maintenance workers who worked in the meat industry. The Queensland organising techniques spread to southern states. Shop committees (workers councils) were established at the Melbourne and Corio works in Victoria in 1917, on the initiative of C. Coupe. Coupe believed shop committees would, \\"ultimately form part of the machinery of government for the workers when they are prepared to take control of the industries, to be run in the interests of the working class.\\" (quoted in AMIEU history, page 4) In South Australia councils were also established, and in 1919 the South Australian branch of the AMIEU reported to the federal council, \\"No dispute along the old lines of a cessation of work has taken place within the past two years. Job control and scientific organisation has rendered obsolete this medieval method of fighting. The arbitration method of securing our rights has often been discussed, and has been submitted to most adverse criticism; and, so far as this branch is concerned, unless the whole aim and present methods of the arbitration system are speedily altered, we will have none of it.\\" (quotes in AMIEU history, page 5) The councils actively organised go-slows and sabotage, as replacements for strike action. Revolutionary unionism is unusual in Australian history, and the 1908‚Äì1923 period was particularly militant. In the same period the AMIEU was organising workers councils; the IWW was organising general strikes, forgery scandals and arson attacks in New South Wales to prevent continued Australian involvement in the First World War, and to protect workers rights. The IWW was a large force behind these upheavals in NSW, and when the IWW was persecuted nationally after 1916, the AMIEU supported them. Recent history IN 1983, the AMIEU was involved in a major industrial dispute at the Mudginberri abattoir in the Northern Territory. The AMIEU served a log of claims on Mudginberri and on all other abattoirs in the Northern Territory, seeking a unit tally system to be set up. Mudginberri chose to fight the claim, with the backing of the National Farmers' Federation.

It runs in a straight line from its east portal, along the Deerfield River in the town of Florida, to its west portal in the city of North Adams. Work began in 1851 under an estimated cost of $2 million and ended in 1875, having used $21 million. At its completion, the tunnel was the world's second-longest, after the Mont Cenis Tunnel through the French Alps. It was the longest tunnel in North America until the 1916 completion of the Connaught Tunnel under Rogers Pass in British Columbia. It remains the longest active transportation tunnel east of the Rocky Mountains, and is the sixth longest railroad tunnel in North America. The American Society of Civil Engineers made the tunnel an Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1975. \\"Hoosac\\" is an Algonquian word meaning \\"place of stones\\". Construction Proposal and beginning The Hoosac Tunnel Guide The tunnel project was originally proposed in 1819 as a canal to connect Boston to Upstate New York via the Deerfield River on the east of the Hoosac Range and the Hoosic River on the west. That project was shelved, and later reborn as part of the new Troy and Greenfield Railroad. The project was nicknamed \\"The Great Bore\\" by its critics, including future Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., who said that he would like to \\"wall up a dozen lawyers at one end of the tunnel and put a good fee at the other.\\" The most important proponent of the northern route and the Hoosac Tunnel was Alvah Crocker, a self-made paper mill owner from Fitchburg, Massachusetts. The project, which was promoted by Crocker but mostly organized and engineered by others, notably Hermann Haupt in the early stages, and several other firms under contract, under the direction of several head engineers assigned by the state of Massachusetts, which took over the project after it initially failed and went bankrupt. In 1841, Crocker formed the Fitchburg Railroad (chartered 1842, opened 1845) between Boston and Fitchburg. In 1844, Crocker incorporated the existing Vermont and Massachusetts Railroad, which ran from Fitchburg west to Greenfield, as well as northward (from Millers Falls) to Brattleboro, Vermont. In 1848, Crocker secured from the legislature a charter for the Troy & Greenfield Railroad (T & G), with provisions for a tunnel through Hoosac Mountain. The first chief engineer of the tunnel project was A.F. Edwards. In 1854, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts provided $2,000,000 in credit to Edward Wellman Serrell and Company, which began work in 1855. In 1856, Herman Haupt took over as chief engineer. The Western Railroad, led by Chester W. Chapin, which ran a southern route through Springfield and Pittsfield, opposed the Hoosac Tunnel and its northern route through the state. It successfully lobbied to block state funding of the tunnel in 1861, which bankrupted Haupt and temporarily stopped the project. Haupt had excavated , or about a fifth of the distance, at that point. He left and became a Union Army railroad engineer and general in the American Civil War. Completion Profile of Hoosac Mountain In 1862, the Troy and Greenfield Railroad defaulted on its loan from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which foreclosed on the mortgage and took control of the railroad, including the tunnel project. The state sent engineer Charles Storrow to Europe to study modern tunneling techniques, including the use of nitroglycerin and compressed air. In 1863 the state, with Alvah Crocker now superintendent of railroads, restarted the project and made Thomas Doane the chief engineer. In 1868, the Massachusetts state legislature appropriated $5 million to complete the project. Canadian engineer Walter Shanly (sometimes spelled Shanley) and his brother Francis took over the project from the state and remained through the completion of the tunnel boring. Among the consulting engineers at the time was Benjamin Henry Latrobe II, a noted civil engineer who was serving as the chief engineer of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The final chief engineer was Bernard N. Farren, who took over on November 19, 1874, and on Thanksgiving Day that year, the last 16 feet of rock was removed beneath the town of North Adams. Farren completed the work, including enlarging sections of the tunnel, reinforcing weak areas with arching, completing drainage systems and completing the east tunnel facade. The first train passed through the tunnel on February 9, 1875. Technology The tunnel construction project required excavation of of rock. On March 16, 1853, \\"Wilson's Patented Stone-Cutting Machine\\" (a tunnel boring machine) was used; it failed after excavating of rock. Tunnel builders resorted to hand digging, and later used the Burleigh Drilling-machine, one of the first pneumatic drills. Construction also featured the first large-scale commercial use of nitroglycerin and electric blasting caps and the first such use in the United States. Digging the Central Shaft also allowed workers to open two additional faces to excavate: once the shaft was completed in 1870, workers dug outwards from the center to meet the tunnels being dug from the east and west portals. Engineers built a elevator to hoist the excavated rock from the Central Shaft. One of the many engineering challenges posed by the project was getting the proper alignment between the four tunnel segments that were being dug: the east and west portal tunnels and the two tunnels dug outward from the central shaft. Engineers cleared a path through the forest over the mountain and strung a straight line from the east to west portals through \\"sighting posts\\" on the east and west peaks of Hoosac Mountain. In 1866, Thomas Doane took over as chief engineer. He resurveyed the alignment of the tunnel by constructing six towers. Ruins of the westernmost Hoosac Tunnel alignment tower, located on Ragged Mountain in North Adams, Massachusetts The alignment towers served to make sure the tunnel stayed true to its course. Grooved iron markers were originally used instead of these towers. Each tower, except the Rowe Neck tower, consisted of a transit scope, a sloped wooden roof on the top of the stone structure. Repeated surveys verified the line ran true between the posts, and steel bolts were installed at fixed intervals along the line. Only four of the towers remain today, in ruins and can be found by using old roads and some bushwhacking through the current forest overgrowth. On December 12, 1872, workers opened the east portal tunnel to the Central Shaft-dug tunnel, which were aligned within , a tremendous engineering achievement at that time. On November 27, 1873, the remainder of the tunnel was opened to the west portal tunnel. Lewis Cuyler of the Hoosac Tunnel Museum Society described the project as the \\"fountainhead of modern tunnel technology\\". The American Society of Civil Engineers made the tunnel an Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1975. Accidents Deadly accidents during construction killed 196 workers, leading the survivors to dub the Tunnel the \\"Bloody Pit.\\" Many of its victims died in explosions, most by black powder, others by the more powerful but less stable nitroglycerin. Among the deadliest incidents was the horrendous Central Shaft accident. On October 17, 1867, workers were digging the tunnel's vertical exhaust shaft when a candle in the hoist building ignited naphtha fumes that had leaked from a \\"Gasometer\\" lamp. The ensuing explosion set the hoist on fire, and it collapsed into the shaft. Four men near the top of the shaft escaped, but 13 men working below were trapped by falling naphtha and pieces of iron. The pumps were also destroyed, and the shaft began to fill with water. A worker named Mallory was lowered into the shaft by a rope the next day; he was overcome by fumes and reported no survivors, and no further rescue attempts were made. Several months later, workers reached the shaft's bottom and found that several victims had survived long enough to fashion a raft before suffocating. Operations East Portal c. 1915, showing test section at left West Portal, looking out, in 1916 World War I. The Troy and Boston Railroad and its Southern Vermont Railroad and Troy and Greenfield Railroad opened in 1859 from Troy, New York, on the New York Central Railroad and Hudson River Railroad, east to North Adams at the west portal of the tunnel. The 1863 state buyout of the Troy and Greenfield Railroad opened the way for competition through the tunnel. The Boston, Hoosac Tunnel and Western Railway was organized in 1877 to build from near the Massachusetts‚ÄìVermont border, where state ownership ended, parallel to the Troy and Boston Railroad to near Johnsonville, New York and then west via Schenectady to Rotterdam Junction on what became the New York, West Shore, and Buffalo Railway in 1880. The line was being planned as a part of the Delaware and Hudson Company's system and as part of the Erie Railroad system via the Delaware and Hudson Company's Albany and Susquehanna Railroad. East of Greenfield, the east end of state ownership, the BHT&W; would have built its own line to terminal facilities at Winthrop. The first train passed through the tunnel on February 9, 1875. Regular service via the tunnel between Boston and Troy, New York began the following year. The tunnel and Troy and Greenfield Railroad were bought by the Fitchburg Railroad in 1877. The Boston and Maine Railroad bought the Fitchburg Railroad in 1900. Competition between the two companies caused various court challenges were made. In late 1878 the T&B; attempted to evict the BHT&W; from the roadbed of the abandoned Albany Northern Railroad between Hart's Falls and Eagle Bridge. The BHT&W; lost that case, but continued to use the right-of-way. The case lasted until late 1881 when it was overturned. In May 1879, a frog war was feared at Hoosick Junction, where the BHT&W; was to cross the T&B;'s Troy and Bennington Railroad. In July, Cornelius Vanderbilt, who owned the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad, acquired a controlling interest in the T&B;, threatening to build a branch to Saratoga Springs unless the BHT&W;/D&H; alliance was ended. In November, an appellate court ruled that the application to cross the Troy and Bennington was improperly made to the Troy and Boston, and the T&B; claimed that the improvements, including a stone bridge, were forfeit. The first train ran over the full BHT&W; to Mechanicville on December 6, 1879, and revenue service began December 20, with general offices at North Adams. In 1881, the BHT&W; was being planned as part of a larger system west to Oswego and Buffalo. The line was not built, but the BHT&W; opened an extension west to Rotterdam Junction on the New York, West Shore, and Buffalo Railway. The New York Central and Hudson River Railroad took over the NYWS&B; in 1886, and in 1887 the Fitchburg Railroad bought both the T&B; and the BHT&W;, as well at the Troy and Greenfield Railroad, including the tunnel, ending the rivalry. In 1910, the tunnel was electrified with the goal of reducing smoke and increasing the speed of traffic. Three years later, traffic within the tunnel was so heavy, at 70,000 cars a month, that the power plant in Adams, with its 6000 kW generator, could not keep up. Power was then drawn from a nearby dam three miles north of the eastern entrance. In 1926, 3000 ft of the western end of the tunnel were deepened by 1.5 ft. Electrification ended in the tunnel in 1946 with the advent of diesel locomotives, and a fan was installed in the Central Shaft to remove Diesel exhaust fumes. Today, the Central Shaft system remains in place; however, ventilation relies on a single fan operating on low power due to the low number of trains on the line. The last regularly-scheduled Boston and Maine Railroad passenger train, the Minute Man, passed through the tunnel in 1958.Ronald Dale Karr, 'The Rail Lines of Southern New England,' Branch Line Press, 1995, p. 168 In 2009, ownership of the tunnel was transferred to Pan Am Southern, a 50-50 joint venture of Pan Am Railways and Norfolk Southern Railway. Freight trains through the tunnel are operated by Springfield Terminal Railway, the train operating subsidiary of Pan Am Railways. The route is currently used to transport freight but has seen excursion trains on rare occasions. It was converted to a single track in 1957. Clearances were increased in 1997 and 2007, the former by lowering the track, the latter by grinding 15 inches (38 cm) off the roof, allowing trailer on flat car (TOFC) and tri-level automobile carriers to pass. In March 2012, the Federal Railroad Administration awarded a $2 million grant to the Massachusetts Department of Transportation for preliminary engineering on further increasing clearance in the tunnel to allow double stack container trains to use the tunnel.Massachusetts Awarded $2 Million to Initiate Improvements Needed to Expand Freight Rail Service Into New England As of 2019, MassDOT, with FRA support, has surveyed the 155-mile Patriot Corridor, including the Hoosac Tunnel, and identified 19 improvement projects needed to achieve double-stack clearance. MassDOT is preparing needed environmental reviews.About the Patriot Corridor Double-Stack Clearance Initiative Project, Massachusetts Department of Transportation, accessed November 26, 2019, As of 2020, eight freight trains per day operate through the tunnel. On February 12, 2020, the tunnel collapsed approximately 300 feet from the West Portal. Subsequent collapses occurred in the following days. Crews were able to repair the tunnel. Freight traffic was detoured over the New England Central Railroad and Vermont Railway while Intermodal traffic was detoured via CSX during the closure.. The tunnel reopened on April 4, 2020, after a two month closure, with some repairs still ongoing. https://www.recorder.com/Hoosac-tunnel-in- North-Adams-reopens-to-trains-33757983 See also *Western Gateway Heritage State Park *National Register of Historic Places listings in Berkshire County, Massachusetts *Box Tunnel Footnotes References  *Hampson, Rick. \\"Tunnel a Wonder of the 19th Century\\", Chicago Daily Herald (August 24, 1980) p. 42 \\"The Story of the Hoosac Tunnel\\", Atlantic Monthly, (March 1882) *\\"The Hoosac Tunnel Tragedy\\", The Defiance Democrat (Ohio) (November 16, 1867) p. 1 *\\"Fighting for Eastern Traffic\\", New York Times (January 2, 1879) p. 5 *\\"Railroad Rioting Feared\\", New York Times (May 25, 1879) p. 1 *\\"The Hoosac Tunnel Route\\", New York Times (July 5, 1879) p. 1 *\\"Railroad Methods\\", New York Times (November 26, 1879) p. 1 *\\"Railroad Management\\", New York Times (December 7, 1879) p. 1 *\\"First Train Over the Boston, Hoosac Tunnel and Western\\", New York Times (December 21, 1879) p. 2 *\\"A Great Railroad Project\\", New York Times (April 11, 1881) p. 1 *\\"Boston, Hoosac Tunnel and Western Victory\\"', New York Times (October 5, 1881) p. 2 Further reading  External links * HoosacTunnel.net - a website dedicated to the Hoosac Tunnel * Hoosac Tunnel information - from the Catskill Archive * Hoosac Tunnel: Abode of the Damned? - Exploration of the tunnel, October 14, 2002 * Western Gateway Heritage State Park - Learn about the construction of the Hoosac Tunnel.

After a researcher records her death from a heart attack, her colleagues join forces to retrieve the information and play it back. Plot Scientists invent a brain‚Äìcomputer interface enabling sensations to be recorded from a person's brain and converted to tape for others to experience. The team includes estranged husband and wife Michael and Karen, as well as Michael's colleague Lillian. At CEO Alex's instruction, the team demonstrates the device to investors to gain financing. Karen dons the recorder while working with Michael and Lillian. When Michael plays the tape back, the group realizes that emotional experiences are also recorded. Michael tapes his memories of times with Karen, which he shares with her, leading to their reconciliation. Lillian is pressured by backers to admit Landon to the team, whom she sees as part of the military-industrial complex. She disagrees with their plan to have the invention developed for military use. One team member, Gordy, has sexual intercourse while wearing the recorder, and shares the tape with colleagues, including Hal. Hal splices one section of the tape into a continuous orgasm, which results in sensory overload, leading to his forced retirement. Tensions increase as the possibilities for abuse become clear. Suffering from heart problems and a constant cigarette smoker, Lillian suffers a heart attack while working alone. Realizing she is about to die, Lillian records her experience. Michael later decides to experience Lillian's recording, but nearly dies when his body simulates a heart attack. Michael modifies his console to filter the physical output, and replays the tape. He sees \\"memory bubbles\\"‚Äîmoments from Lillian's life. Michael experiences Lillian's memories of a humorous exchange with Michael as he plays with an industrial robot, a surprise birthday party, and being devastated when Alex tells her that an earlier project is cancelled. Scientists wanting to discover the machine's military capabilities are monitoring the equipment as Michael plays Lillian's tape. They have Gordy experience the tape, but Landon ignores the advice of the monitoring staff that Michael made modifications to his terminal. Gordy dies from experiencing Lillian's heart attack. Michael's playback is cut short by Hal, but having witnessed the near-death experience makes Michael curious to see the entire tape. Alex has the recording locked away and tells Michael he will not be allowed to view it. When he returns to work, Michael walks in on Landon and outside technicians going through his research records. Alex responds to his protests by firing Michael and Karen. Michael attempts to hack into the lab's computers. Hal advises him to look under \\"Project Brainstorm\\", a program the military created to use their invention for torture and brainwashing. Michael accesses a tape from his den and quickly stops viewing it because of its disturbing nature. Michael and Karen's son Chris inadvertently views the tape, causing him to have a psychotic experience that results in his hospitalization. Alex visits and Michael confronts him about Project Brainstorm, blaming Alex for his son's condition. Alex denies any knowledge of the project, then informs Michael of Gordy's death. Michael vows to destroy his work and enlists the help of Karen and Hal. Michael and Karen head to the Pinehurst Resort and, realizing they are under surveillance, stage a fight that results in Karen leaving for Hal's house. As the two feign reconciliation over the phone, Michael accesses the Brainstorm computer via another phone line while Karen hacks into the system, sabotaging the robots that manufacture the interface terminals. Karen shuts down the security system, locking the staff outside and enabling Michael to load Lillian's tape and experience it uninterrupted. With the plant in chaos, Robert orders Michael's arrest. Karen leaves the house to meet with Michael. Hal and his wife, Wendy, send the last of Karen's commands to the company computers, shutting down the plant. Karen meets with Michael while the tape is playing. Michael bears witness to the afterlife, experiencing a vision of hell before traveling away from Earth and through the universe, even after the tape ends. He ultimately has visions of angels and departed souls flying into a great cosmic Light. Michael then collapses. Karen sobs, believing him dead. She pleads for Michael to stay alive. Awakening from the experience, he weeps with joy and embraces Karen.

In September 1981 the cast and crew traveled to North Carolina to begin six weeks of shooting at locations including the Elion-Hitchings Building in Research Triangle Park and Duke University, before moving back to the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios in Culver City, California in November to film interior scenes. Natalie Wood's death The film was nearly scuttled by Natalie Wood's death during a production break in November 1981. By this time, Wood had already completed all of her major scenes, but due to mounting financial problems, MGM took Wood's death as an opportunity to shut down the already troubled production. \\"When she died,\\" said Trumbull, \\"all the sets were locked and frozen on all the stages. No one could get in or out without special permission while all the negotiations took place.\\" Trumbull believed that the financially strapped MGM simply got cold feet about putting up the rest of the money to complete Brainstorm. \\"MGM's problem was that insurance institution Lloyd's of London, when it took depositions from me and other people, realized that the film could be finished. Why should they pay an insurance claim for something that really wasn't damaged goods?\\" When MGM refused to pay for the film to be completed, Lloyd's of London provided $2.75 million for Trumbull to complete principal photography and an additional $3.5 million towards post-production. Meanwhile, other studios showed interest in buying Brainstorm from MGM to release as their own production. \\"MGM decided to allow Lloyd's of London to offer the film to many of the major studios in town,\\" said Trumbull. \\"Several of them made bids to MGM. And the studio suddenly realized that a lot of other people in this town were excited about Brainstorm, and were ready to put up millions of dollars. MGM figured they'd look like jerks if they let it go and it turned out to be a big success. So they finally decided to work out this deal where Lloyd's of London would put up the remaining money and become a profit participant.\\" Trumbull proceeded to complete the film by rewriting the script and using Natalie Wood's younger sister Lana for Wood's few remaining scenes. The film carries the dedication credit \\"To Natalie\\".  Effects  The film was conceived as an introduction to Trumbull's Showscan 60 frames- per-second 70mm film process. \\"In movies people often do flashbacks and point- of-view shots as a gauzy, mysterious, distant kind of image,\\" Trumbull recalled, \\"And I wanted to do just the opposite, which was to make the material of the mind even more real and high-impact than 'reality'\\". However, MGM backed out of plans to release the experimental picture in the new format. Trumbull instead shot the virtual reality sequences in 24 frames-per-second Super Panavision 70 with an aspect ratio of 2.2:1. The rest of the film was shot in conventional 35mm with an aspect ratio of approximately 1.7 to 1.  Soundtrack  The score to Brainstorm was composed and conducted by James Horner, it won him the Saturn Award for Best Music in 1983. The Var√®se Sarabande album/CD release is a re-recording with the London Symphony Orchestra, produced shortly before the original theatrical release.Brainstorm soundtrack review at Filmtracks.com Reception Brainstorm was finally released on September 30, 1983, almost two years after Wood's death. However, it opened on a small number of screens and with little publicity, despite being trumpeted unofficially as \\"Natalie Wood's last movie\\". Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 55% of 20 critics have given the film a positive review with an average rating of 5.69/10. Janet Maslin of the New York Times gave particular credit to Louise Fletcher's \\"superb performance\\". Christopher John reviewed Brainstorm in Ares Magazine Special Edition #2 and commented that \\"For those looking for nothing more than the same old spaceships and monsters, well, this one probably isn't for you ‚Äì but then again, you've got all the movies you need this year. Brainstorm is for the rest of us.\\" Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a mixed 2 stars out a possible 4, describing the premise as \\"a good idea for a movie\\" and credited Trumbull with providing \\"intriguing\\" special effects. However, Ebert thought the cast was not used well: \\"The characters take such a secondary importance to the gadget that we never feel much for them.\\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/brainstorm-1983 The film was not a commercial success, with a production budget of $18 million and grossing only $10 million in ticket sales in North America. Because of the immensely troubled production and disagreements with MGM, Trumbull opted never to direct a Hollywood film again. In 1983 he stated \\"I have no interest...in doing another Hollywood feature film...Absolutely none. The movie business is so totally screwed up that I just don't have the energy to invest three or four years in a feature film. Moviemaking is like waging war. It destroys your personal life, too. The people who can survive the process of making films have largely given up their personal lives in order to do that, just because it's such a battle to make a movie. And in doing that, they've isolated themselves from the very audience that they're trying to reach.\\" In 2013, he explained that the uncertain circumstances of Natalie Wood's death were the main reason for this decision. He has since returned to filmmaking.

The term passenger car can also be associated with a sleeping car, baggage, dining, railway post office and prisoner transport cars. In some countries, such as the UK, some coaching stock (whether designed, converted or adapted) to not carry passengers are referred to as \\"NPCS\\" ( non-passenger coaching stock); similarly some maintenance (engineering) stock can be known as \\"MOW\\" ‚Äì maintenance of way ‚Äì in the US. History 19th century: First passenger cars and early development clerestory cars on display at the Mid-Continent Railway Museum in North Freedom, Wisconsin Up until about the end of the 19th century, most passenger cars were constructed of wood. The first passenger trains did not travel very far, but they were able to haul many more passengers for a longer distance than any wagons pulled by horses. As railways were first constructed in England, so too were the first passenger cars. One of the early coach designs was the \\"Stanhope\\". It featured a roof and small holes in the floor for drainage when it rained, and had separate compartments for different classes of travel. The only problem with this design is that the passengers were expected to stand for their entire trip. The first passenger cars in the United States resembled stagecoaches. They were short, often less than long and had two axles. British railways had a head start on American railroads, with the first \\"bed-carriage\\" (an early sleeping car) being built there as early as 1838 for use on the London and Birmingham Railway and the Grand Junction Railway. Britain's early sleepers, when made up for sleeping, extended the foot of the bed into a boot section at the end of the carriage. The cars were still too short to allow more than two or three beds to be positioned end to end. Britain's Royal Mail commissioned and built the first Travelling Post Office cars in the late 1840s as well. These cars resembled coaches in their short wheelbase and exterior design, but were equipped with nets on the sides of the cars to catch mail bags while the train was in motion. American RPOs, first appearing in the 1860s, also featured equipment to catch mail bags at speed, but the American design more closely resembled a large hook that would catch the mailbag in its crook. When not in use, the hook would swivel down against the side of the car to prevent it from catching obstacles. The interior of a Pullman car on the Chicago and Alton Railroad circa 1900 As locomotive technology progressed in the mid-19th century, trains grew in length and weight. Passenger cars, particularly in America, grew along with them, first getting longer with the addition of a second truck (one at each end), and wider as their suspensions improved. Cars built for European use featured side door compartments, while American car design favored what was called a train coach, a single long cabin with rows of seats, with doors located at the ends of the car. Early American sleeping cars were not compartmented, but by the end of the 19th century they were. The compartments in the later sleepers were accessed from a side hall running the length of the cars, similar to the design of European cars well into the 20th century. Many American passenger trains, particularly the long distance ones, included a car at the end of the train called an observation car. Until about the 1930s, these had an open-air platform at the rear, the \\"observation platform\\". These evolved into the closed end car, usually with a rounded end which was still called an \\"observation car\\". The interiors of observation cars varied. Many had special chairs and tables. The end platforms of all passenger cars changed around the turn of the 20th century. Older cars had open platforms between cars. Passengers would enter and leave a car through a door at the end of the car which led to a narrow platform. Steps on either side of the platform were used for getting on or off the train, and one might hop from one car platform to another. Later cars had enclosed platforms called vestibules which together with gangway connections allowed passengers not only to enter and exit the train protected from the elements, but also to move more easily between cars with the same protection. Dining cars first appeared in the late 1870s and into the 1880s. Until this time, the common practice was to stop for meals at restaurants along the way (which led to the rise of Fred Harvey's chain of Harvey House restaurants in America). At first, the dining car was simply a place to serve meals that were picked up en route, but they soon evolved to include galleys in which the meals were prepared. The introduction of vestibuled cars, which for the first time allowed easy movement from car to car, aided the adoption of dining cars, lounge cars, and other specialized cars. 1900‚Äì1950: Lighter materials, new car types CB&Q;'s Pioneer Zephyr. The carbody was made of stainless steel in 1934; it is seen here at Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry in 2003. By the 1920s, passenger cars on the larger standard gauge railroads were normally between and long. The cars of this time were still quite ornate, many of them being built by experienced coach makers and skilled carpenters. In the United States, the so- called \\"chair car\\" with individual seating became commonplace on long-distance routes. With the 1930s came the widespread use of stainless steel for car bodies. The typical passenger car was now much lighter than its wood cousins of old. The new \\"lightweight\\" and streamlined cars carried passengers in speed and comfort to an extent that had not been experienced to date. Aluminum and Cor-Ten steel were also used in lightweight car construction, but stainless steel was the preferred material for car bodies. Stainless steel cars could be and often were, left unpainted except for the car's reporting marks that were required by law. By the end of the 1930s, railroads and car builders were debuting car body and interior styles that could only be dreamed of before. In 1937, the Pullman Company delivered the first cars equipped with roomettes ‚Äì that is, the car's interior was sectioned off into compartments, much like the coaches that were still in widespread use across Europe. Pullman's roomettes, however, were designed with a single traveller in mind. The roomette featured a large picture window, a privacy door, a single fold-away bed, a sink and a small toilet. The roomette's floor space was barely larger than the space taken up by the bed, but it allowed the traveller to ride in luxury compared to the multilevel semiprivate berths of old. Now that passenger cars were lighter, they were able to carry heavier loads, but the size of the average passenger that rode in them didn't increase to match the cars' new capacities. The average passenger car could not be made any wider or longer due to side clearances along the railroad lines, but they generally could get taller because they were still lower than many freight cars and locomotives. The railroads soon began building and buying dome and bilevel cars to carry more passengers. 1950‚Äìpresent: High-technology advancements Amtrak Cascades operates with tilting Talgo permanently coupled trainsets Starting in the 1950s, the passenger travel market declined in North America, though there was growth in commuter rail. Private intercity passenger service in the U.S. mostly ended with the creation of Amtrak in 1971. Amtrak took over equipment and stations from most of the railroads in the U.S. with intercity service. The higher clearances in North America enabled a major advancement in passenger car design, bi-level (double-decker) commuter coaches that could hold more passengers. These cars started to become common in the United States in the 1960s, and were adopted by Amtrak for the Superliner design as well as by many other railroads and manufacturers. By the year 2000 double-deckers rivaled single level cars in use around the world. While intercity passenger rail travel declined in America, ridership continued to increase in other parts of the world. With the increase came an increased use of newer technology on existing and new equipment. The Spanish company Talgo began experimenting in the 1940s with technology that would enable the axles to steer into a curve, allowing the train to move around the curve at a higher speed. The steering axles evolved into mechanisms that would also tilt the passenger car as it entered a curve to counter the centrifugal force experienced by the train, further increasing speeds on existing track. Today, Talgo trains are used in many places in Europe and they have also found a home in North America on some short and medium distance routes such as Eugene, Oregon, to Vancouver, British Columbia. Another type of tilting train that is seeing widespread use across Europe is the Pendolino. These trains, built by Fiat Ferroviaria (now owned by Alstom), are in regular service in Italy, Portugal, Slovenia, Finland, Czech Republic and the United Kingdom. Using tilting trains, railroads are able to run passenger trains over the same tracks at higher speeds than would otherwise be possible. Amtrak continued to push the development of U.S.-designed passenger equipment even when the market demand didn't support it, ordering a number of new passenger locomotive and car types in the 1980s and 1990s. However, by the year 2000 Amtrak went to European manufacturers for the Amtrak Cascades (Talgo) and Acela Express trains, their premier services. These trains use new designs and are made to operate as coherent \\"trainsets\\". High-speed trains are made up of cars from a single manufacturer and usually of a uniform design (although the dining car on the German ICE 1 has a dome). In the 1960s and 1970s countries around the world started to develop trains capable of traveling in the 150‚Äì200 mph range, to rival air travel. One of the first was France's TGV which entered service in 1981. By the year 2000, Western Europe's major cities (London, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, Geneva, Berlin, Rome, etc.) were connected by high-speed rail service. Often tilting and high-speed cars are left in \\"trainsets\\" throughout their service. For example, articulated cars cannot be uncoupled without special equipment because the individual cars share trucks. This gives modern trains a smooth, coherent appearance because all the cars and often the engines share a similar design and paint scheme. Heavyweight vs. lightweight A heavyweight car is one that is physically heavier than a lightweight car due to its construction. While early cars used wood construction, Pullman switched to heavyweight riveted steel construction in 1910, more or less at the same time as other rail car manufacturers. Heavyweights are said to offer a more luxurious ride due to their added mass (from the plate steel construction and concrete floor) and, usually, six- wheeled trucks (bogies). The stepped roof line of early heavyweights usually consisted of a center sill section (the clerestory) that ran the length of the car and extended above the roof sides by as much as a foot. This section of the roof usually had windows or shutters that could be opened for ventilation while the train was in motion. However, railroad crews and passengers quickly discovered that when these windows were opened on a passenger train pulled by one or more steam locomotives, smoke and soot from the locomotives tended to drift in through the windows, especially when the train went through a tunnel. In the early 20th century, air conditioning was added to heavyweight cars for the first time. An air conditioned heavyweight car could be spotted easily since the area where the roof vent windows existed was now covered, either partially or in full, by the air conditioning duct. As lightweight cars were introduced, many heavyweight cars were repurposed into maintenance of way service by the railroads that owned them. Lightweight passenger cars required developments in steel processing that were not available until the 1920s and 1930s. By building passenger cars out of steel instead of wood, the manufacturers were able to build lighter weight cars with smooth or fluted sides and smooth roof lines. Steel cars were ushered in at the beginning of the streamline era of the 1930s (although not all lightweight cars were streamlined) and steel has continued in use ever since then. With the use of steel for the car sides, railroads were able to offer more innovative passenger car types. Railroads did not build or use dome cars until the first lightweight cars were introduced because the sides of heavyweight cars were not strong enough to support the weight of the dome and its passengers. Lightweight cars also enabled the railroads to operate longer passenger trains; the reduced car weight meant that more passengers could be carried in a greater number of cars with the same locomotives. The cost savings in hauling capacity coupled with the increased car type options led to the quick replacement of heavyweight cars with lightweight cars.  Car types  Traditionally the passenger car can be split into a number of distinct types. Eurostar Italia The most basic division is between cars which do carry passengers and \\"head end\\" equipment. The latter are run as part of passenger trains, but do not themselves carry passengers. Traditionally they were put between the locomotive and the passenger-carrying cars in the consist, hence the name. Some specialized types are variants of or combine elements of the most basic types. Also, the basic design of passenger cars is evolving, with articulated units that have shared trucks, with double-decker designs, and with the \\"low floor\\" design where the loading area is very close to the ground and slung between the trucks. Passenger-carrying types Coach Finnish bilevel coach. The seating arrangement is of the \\"open\\" type. Reclining seats in a coach car. An open-type [3+3] chair car of Indian Railways, India The interior of an Australian compartment car, viewed from the connecting side corridor The coach is the most basic type of passenger car, also sometimes referred to as \\"chair cars\\". Two main variants exist. In one variant, an \\"open coach\\" has a central aisle; the car's interior is often filled with row upon row of seats as in a passenger airliner. Other arrangements of the \\"open\\" type are also found, including seats around tables, seats facing the aisle (often found on mass transit trains since they increase standing room for rush hour), and variations of all three. Seating arrangement is typically [2+2], while the hard seat in China has [3+2] arrangements. The seating arrangements and density, as well as the absence or presence of other facilities depends on the intended use ‚Äì from mass transit systems to long distance luxury trains. Some cars have reclining seats to allow for easier sleeping by passengers not traveling in a sleeping car. In another variant, \\"closed\\" coaches or \\"compartment\\" cars have a side corridor to connect individual compartments along the body of the train, each with two rows of seats facing each other. In both arrangements carry-on baggage is stowed on a shelf above the passenger seating area. The opening into the cars is usually located at both ends of the carriage, often into a small hallway ‚Äì which in railway parlance is termed a vestibule. Earlier designs of UK coaching stock had additional door or doors along their length, some supporting compartmentalised carriages. \\"Composite\\" coaches are also known. These are mixed-class cars featuring both open seating and compartments. One such coach is the Composite Corridor, introduced for British Rail in the 1950s; though such coaches existed from early pre-grouping days, at the end of the 19th century. In India, normal carriages often have double height seating, with benches (berths), so that people can sit above one another (not unlike a bunk bed). In other countries, true double decker carriages are becoming more common. The seats in most coaches until the middle of the 20th century were usually bench seats; the backs of these seats could be adjusted, often with one hand, to face in either direction so the car would not have to be turned for a return trip. The conductor would simply walk down the aisle in the car, reversing the seat backs to prepare for the return trip. This arrangement is still used in some modern trains. Dining car A dining car (or diner) is used to serve meals to the passengers. Its interior may be split with a portion of the interior partitioned off for a galley, which is off-limits to passengers. A narrow hallway is left between the galley and one side wall of the car for passengers to use. The remainder of the interior is laid out with tables and chairs to look like a long, narrow restaurant dining room. There are special personnel to perform waitstaff and kitchen duties. Lounge Amtrak Superliner lounge car (also a low-floor, double-decker car) Lounge cars carry a bar and public seating. They usually have benches, armchairs or large swivelling chairs along the sides of the car. They often have small tables for drinks, or may be large enough to play cards. Some lounge cars include small pianos and are staffed by contracted musicians to entertain the passengers. These cars are often pulled in addition to the dining car, and on very long trains in addition to one or more snack or caf√© cars. Caf√© cars, such as the Amtrak caf√© cars, are simpler, lacking window-facing seats, instead, rows of tables with facing pairs of bench seats, split by a food and drink counter. Lounge cars are an important part of the appeal of passenger trains when compared to aircraft, buses and cars; there is more space to move around, socialize, eat and drink, and a good view. Observation A heavyweight observation car The observation car almost always operated as the last car in a passenger train, in US practice. Its interior could include features of a coach, lounge, diner, or sleeper. The main spotting feature was at the tail end of the car ‚Äì some more modern US designs had walls of the car usually curved together to form a large U shape, and larger windows were installed all around the end of the car; earlier designs had square ends with an observation open deck (preserved stock in Southern Africa, Oceania and many countries elsewhere.) Before these cars were built with steel walls, the observation end of heavyweight cars in the US and Canada resembled a roofed porch area. Larger windows were installed at the observation end on these cars as well. At this end of the car, there was almost always a lounge where passengers could enjoy the view as they watched the track rapidly recede into the distance. Sleeping car Often called \\"sleepers\\" or \\"Pullman cars\\" (after the main American operator), these cars provide sleeping arrangements for passengers travelling at night. Early models were divided into sections, where coach seating converted at night into semi-private berths. More modern interiors are normally partitioned into separate bedroom compartments for passengers. The beds are designed in such a way that they either roll or fold out of the way or convert into seats for daytime use. Compartments vary in size; some are large enough for only a bed, while others resemble efficiency apartments including bathrooms. In China, sleeping cars still serve as major travel classes in long-range rail transport. The classes of sleeping cars include hard sleeper (YW) with six bunks per compartment, soft sleeper (RW) typically with four bunks, deluxe soft sleeper (GRW) typically with two bunks. Trailer car A trailer car is a passenger car that carries little or no traction or power related equipment, and are similar to regular passenger cars in a locomotive-hauled train. Head-end equipment Baggage car Image:Resgodsvagn.jpg|A resgodsvagn of the Swedish State Railways (SJ) in Malm√∂ in 1988 Image:STCR57636-oct132003.jpg|A baggage car File:XL25K 206110@BJI (20150527105848).JPG|A China Railway XL25K baggage car at Beijing railway station Although passengers generally were not allowed access to the baggage car, they were included in a great number of passenger trains as regular equipment. The baggage car is a car that was normally placed between the train's motive power and the remainder of the passenger train. The car's interior is normally wide open and is used to carry passengers' checked baggage. Baggage cars were also sometimes commissioned by freight companies to haul less-than-carload (LCL) shipments along passenger routes (Railway Express Agency was one such freight company). Some baggage cars included restroom facilities for the train crew, so many baggage cars had doors to access them just like any other passenger car. Baggage cars could be designed to look like the rest of a passenger train's cars, or they could be repurposed box cars equipped with high-speed trucks and passenger train steam and air connections. A special type of baggage car came equipped with doors on one end to facilitate transport of large pieces of equipment and scenery for Broadway shows and other productions. These \\"theatrical\\" baggage cars were assigned theatrical names (i.e. Romeo and Juliet), and were similar to the \\"horse cars\\" that were used to transport racehorses. Express car Express cars carried high-value freight in passenger consists. These cars resembled baggage cars, although in some cases specially-equipped box cars or refrigerator cars were used. Horse car Specialized stock cars were used to transport horses and other high value livestock as part of passenger consists. Similar equipment is used in circus trains to transport their animals. Prisoner car In some countries, such as Russia, convicts are transported from court to prison or from one prison to another by railway. In such transportation a specific type of coach, prisoner car, is used. It contains several cell compartments with minimal interior and commodities, and a separate guard compartment. Usually the windows are of nontransparent opaque glass to prevent prisoners from seeing outside and determine where they are, and windows usually also have bars to prevent escapes. Unlike other passenger cars, prisoner cars do not have doors at the ends of the wagon. Railway post office The interior of a railway post office on display at the National Railroad Museum in Green Bay, Wisconsin Like baggage cars, railway post office (RPO; US term) cars or travelling post offices (TPOs; British term) were not accessible to paying passengers. These cars' interiors were designed with sorting facilities that were often seen and used in conventional post offices around the world. The RPO is where mail was sorted while the train was en route. Because these cars carried mail, which often included valuables or quantities of cash and checks, the RPO staff (who were employed by the postal service and not the railroad) were the only train crews allowed to carry guns. The RPO cars were normally placed in a passenger train between the train's motive power and baggage cars, further inhibiting their access by passengers. Specialized types Colonist Car A colonist car or emigrant car was a special sleeping car designed to take immigrants from ocean ports to settlement areas in western North America at the cheapest possible fare. They offered simple sleeping berths and a cooking area for immigrants who were expected to bring their own food and bedding.. Combine A coach-baggage combine A combine is a car that combines features of a head-end and a regular passenger car. The most common combination is that of a coach and a baggage car, but the combination of coach and post office car was also common. Combines were used most frequently on branch lines and short line railroads where there wasn't necessarily enough traffic to economically justify single- purpose cars. As lightweight cars began to appear on railroads, passenger cars more frequently combined features of two or more car types on one car, and the classic heavyweight combine fell out of use. Control car (cab) A double-decker driving trailer in Germany A driving trailer in Czech Republic A control car (also known as a \\"driving trailer\\" in Europe and the UK) is a passenger car which lets the train be run in reverse with the locomotive at the back. It is common on commuter trains in the US, Canada and Europe. This can be important for serving small towns without extensive switching facilities, dead-end lines, and having a fast turnaround when changing directions in commuter service. Dome car A dome car can include features of a coach car, sleeping car, a lounge car, dining car, and an observation car. Within the United States, the primary manufacturers were The Budd Company (stainless steel construction), The Pullman Company (steel construction), and ACF (American Car & Foundry, aluminum construction). A portion of the car, usually in the center, is split between two levels, with stairs leading both up and down from the train's regular passenger car floor level. The lower level of the dome usually consisted of a small lounge area, while the upper portion was usually coach or lounge seating within a \\"bubble\\" of glass on the car's roof. Budd Co. dome cars used curved class, whereas Pullman company cars used flat panels of glass that were positioned at different angles above the roofline. Passengers in the upper portion of the dome were able to see in all directions from a vantage point above the train's roof line. On some dome cars, the lower portion was built as a galley, where car attendants used dumbwaiters to transfer items between the galley and a dining area in the dome portion of the car. In the United States, the Union Pacific railroad was the primary user of dome dining cars in the pre-Amtrak era. Some dome cars were built with the dome extending the entire length of the car (a \\"full dome\\" car), while others had only a small observation bubble. There were also combination dome-observation cars built which were meant to be the last car on the train, with both rear observation and the dome up top. Dome observation cars came in both round end, and square end versions. The Union Pacific, in the US, was the primary user of square-end observation cars, prior to Amtrak, although the Burlington Route had several square-end cars of stainless steel. Double-decker or bilevel coach A Bombardier BiLevel Coach As passenger car construction improved to the point where dome cars were introduced, some passenger car manufacturers began building double decker passenger train cars for use in areas that are more heavily populated or to carry more passengers over a long distance while using fewer cars (such as Amtrak's Superliner cars). Cars used on long-distance passenger trains could combine features of any of the basic car types, while cars used in local commuter service are often strictly coach types on both levels. Double decker coaches were tried in the UK (SR Class 4DD) but the experiment was unsuccessful because the restricted British loading gauge resulted in cramped conditions. Drovers' car Drovers' cars were used on long distance livestock trains in the western United States. The purpose of a drovers' car was to accommodate the livestock's handlers on the journey between the ranch and processing plant. They were usually shorter, older cars, and equipped with stove heaters, as no trainline steam heating was provided. Hospital car A variety of hospital trains operate around the world, employing specialist carriages equipped as hospital wards, treatment rooms, and full- scale operating theatres (US: operating rooms). Narragansett-style excursion car A Narragansett-style excursion car on the Walt Disney World Railroad Narragansett-style excursion cars are open-air passenger cars with cross-bench seating first popularized by rail lines in New England.. Current operating examples of these train cars can be found on the Disneyland Railroad in California and on the Walt Disney World Railroad in Florida.. Similar coaches are also found on the Western River Railroad in Tokyo Disneyland. Prisoner transport car Many countries historically used special railroad cars to transport prisoners. The tradition is now extinct anywhere except for the post-Soviet countries where dedicated cars (modified sleeping cars) continue to be routinely used for that purpose. Real Soviet prisoner cars and respective procedures was may be seen in The Guard and several other crime-related films. Private car A heavyweight Pullman \\"business car\\" Many cars built by Pullman and other companies were either originally built or later converted for use as business and private cars which served as the \\"private jet\\" of the early-to-mid-20th century. They were used by railroad officials and dignitaries as business cars, and wealthy individuals for travel and entertainment. There are various configurations, but the cars generally have an observation platform and include a full kitchen, dining room, state rooms, secretary's room, an observation room, and often servant's quarters. A number of these private cars have survived the decades and some are used for tour rides, leasing for private events, etc. A small number of private cars (along with other types of passenger cars), have been upgraded to meet current Amtrak regulations, and may be chartered by their owners for private travel attached to Amtrak trains. The only current example in Britain is the British Royal Train. Troop sleeper A \\"troop sleeper\\" was a railroad passenger car which had been constructed to serve as something of a mobile barracks (essentially, a sleeping car) for transporting troops over distances sufficient to require overnight accommodations. This method allowed part of the trip to be made overnight, reducing the amount of transit time required and increasing travel efficiency. Troop kitchens, rolling galleys, also joined the consists in order to provide meal service en route (the troops took their meals in their seats or bunks). Troop hospital cars, also based on the troop sleeper carbody, transported wounded servicemen and typically travelled in solid strings on special trains averaging fifteen cars each. Car technology Passenger cars are as almost as old as railroading itself, and their development paralleled that of freight cars. Early two axle cars gave way to conventional two truck construction with the floor of the car riding above the wheels; link and pin couplers gave way to automatic types. Several construction details characterized passenger equipment. Passenger trains were expected to run at higher speeds than freight service, and therefore passenger trucks evolved to allow superior ride and better tracking at those speeds. Over time, in most cases provision was made for passengers and train staff to move from car to car; therefore platforms and later vestibules were used to bridge the gap. In later years a number of changes to this basic form were introduced to allow for improvements in speed, comfort, and expense. Articulated TGVs (coupled) with articulated trainsets Articulated passenger cars are becoming increasingly common in Europe and the US. This means that the passenger cars share trucks and that the passageways between them are more or less permanently attached. The cars are kept in \\"trainsets\\" and not split up during normal operations. Articulated cars have a number of advantages. They save on the total number of wheels and trucks, reducing costs and maintenance expenses. Further, movement between cars is safer and easier than with traditional designs. Finally, it is possible to implement tilting schemes such as the Talgo design which allow the train to lean into curves. The chief disadvantage is that failure of a single car disables the entire set, since individual cars cannot be readily switched in and out of the consist. Low-floor Siemens light rail vehicle (articulated, low-floor) in Portland, Oregon In some countries (such as the US), platform level may be below the level of the floor of passenger cars, resulting in a significant step up from platform level ‚Äì leading to slower boarding times, which are important for high-capacity systems. Low-floor cars have their main passenger and loading floor directly on level with the loading platform, instead of having a step up to the passenger compartment as was traditional until around the 1970s. This is achieved by having a low-slung chassis with the \\"low floor\\" resting between the trucks, rather than resting completely on top with a simpler straight chassis design. This improved design is seen in many passenger cars today, especially double decker cars. The low floor enables easy access for bicycles, strollers, suitcases, wheelchairs and those with disabilities, which is otherwise not always convenient or even possible with the traditional passenger car design. Within the United States, the Pennsylvania Railroad developed 'The Keystone' 7 car set of cars with their own attached (head end) power car in the late 1950s. It was mostly used between New York City and Washington, DC. Boarding was at the normal platform level, at the end of the cars, with the centre section between the trucks lowered to give the cars a lower centre of gravity, and higher speed capability. Self-propelled passenger equipment These vehicles usually carry motive power in each individual unit. Trams, light rail vehicles and subways have been widely constructed in urban areas throughout the world since the late 19th century. By the year 1900, electric-powered passenger cars were ubiquitous in the developed world, but they fell into decline after World War II, especially in the U.S. By the year 2000 they had regained popularity and modern lines were being rebuilt where they had been torn up only 40 years earlier to make way for automobiles. On lighter-trafficked rural railways, powered diesel cars (such as the Budd Rail Diesel Car) continue to be popular. In Germany, the new Talent design shows that the diesel-powered passenger car is still a viable part of rail service. In the UK, locomotive-hauled passenger trains have largely been replaced by diesel multiple units and electric multiple units, such as the Bombardier Voyager family and the Hitachi A-Train AT300 family, even on express services. Tilting These cars are able to tilt to counter the effects of inertia when turning, making the ride more comfortable for the passengers. Amtrak has adopted Talgo trainsets for its Amtrak Cascades service in the Pacific Northwest. Other manufacturers have also implemented tilting designs. The British Rail Class 390 is a tilting train operating in the UK. Passenger car manufacturers While some railroads, like the Milwaukee Road, preferred to build their own passenger cars, several railcar manufacturers built the majority of passenger cars in revenue service. Most of these companies produced both passenger and freight equipment for the railroads. This is by no means a comprehensive list of all passenger car builders (see List of rolling stock manufacturers for a more complete list). Quite a large number of firms built passenger cars over the years, but the majority of cars in the 20th century were built by these companies. American Car and Foundry American Car and Foundry was formed in 1899 through the merger of 13 smaller railroad car manufacturing companies (in much the same way as the American Locomotive Company was formed from the merger of 8 smaller locomotive manufacturers two years later in 1901). ACF built the first all-steel passenger car in the world for Interborough Rapid Transit in 1904, and then built the first steel cars used on the London Underground in the following year. The company continued to manufacture passenger equipment until 1959. ACF still manufactures freight cars today. Bombardier SNCB Bombardier is the largest manufacturer of passenger cars in the world. This company started in Canada and has become multi- national, making everything from passenger cars to commuter aircraft in factories around the world. Budd Company The Budd Company got its start in the early 1930s when Edward G. Budd developed a way to build carbodies out of stainless steel. In 1932 he completed his first railcar, dubbed the Green Goose. It used rubber tires and a stainless steel body, and was powered by the engine out of Budd's own Chrysler Imperial automobile. Budd sold a few of these early powered cars to the Reading Railroad, Pennsylvania Railroad and the Texas and Pacific Railway. The next year, Ralph Budd, only a very distant relation, but president of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad at the time, came to Budd to build the Pioneer Zephyr. Budd was soon called on by another railroad president before the end of the decade. Samuel T. Bledsoe asked Budd to build the new lightweight cars for the Santa Fe's new Super Chief passenger train. Budd continued building lightweight powered and unpowered cars through the 20th century for nearly every major railroad in North America. This included some of the Metroliners, for use between New York City and Washington, DC, as well as the Amfleet I coaches, lounges, and caf√© cars of the early 1970s. India * Integral Coach Factory, Chennai * Rail Coach Factory, Raebareli * Rail Coach Factory, Kapurthala Kawasaki Kawasaki has been manufacturing passenger rail cars at its facility in Lincoln, Nebraska, since 2001. Kawasaki's Lincoln plant has manufactured rail cars for MBTA, NYCT, PATH, MNR with cars that have led the way with the industry's best MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures). Kawasaki Rail Car was the first American rail car manufacturer to achieve the International Organization for Standardization ISO-9002 certification. Pullman The most famous of all the car manufacturers was Pullman, which began as the Pullman Palace Car Company founded by George Pullman in 1867. The Pullman Palace Car Company manufactured railroad cars in the mid-to-late 19th century through the early decades of the 20th century during the boom of railroads in the United States. Pullman developed the sleeping car which carried his name into the 1980s. In 1900, the Pullman Palace Car Company was reorganized as The Pullman Co.. In 1924, Pullman Car & Manufacturing Co. was organized from the previous Pullman manufacturing department to consolidate the car building interests of The Pullman Co. In 1934, Pullman Car & Manufacturing merged with Standard Steel Car Co. to form the Pullman-Standard Car Manufacturing Company, which remained in the car manufacturing business until 1982. Pullman manufactured its last cars for Amtrak in 1981. The last car built and delivered at the end of July 1981 was named George Mortimer Pullman in honor of the company's founder. Siemens Siemens was founded in 1847 in Berlin, Germany building Conglomerates, Electric and Industry products, Healthcare Radioative systems, rolling stock, etc. The Siemens \\"Viaggio\\" passenger car models are to all purposes in the European railways: Viaggio Twin: double-deck coaches used on CityNightLine and √ñBB CityShuttle regional trains; Viaggio Classic: Original Siemens passenger cars, similar to Eurofima UIC cars, used in Germany, Greece, Czech Republic and Austria; Viaggio Light: new low-floor regional passenger coaches now used in Israel and Viaggio Comfort: New luxury articulated coaches used on √ñBB's railjet and Siemens Coach 2000 prototype lounge car. St. Louis Car Company Founded in April 1887, in its namesake city, St. Louis Car Company manufactured railroad cars for streetcar lines (urban passenger railways) and steam railroads. The company made brief forays into building automobiles and aircraft, but they are best known as the manufacturers of Birney and PCC streetcars which have seen worldwide use. St. Louis Car Company closed in 1973. Lighting, heating, air-conditioning electrical connection cables on a sleeper car in China The earliest form of train lighting was provided by Colza oil lamps. The next stage was gas lighting, using compressed gas stored in cylinders under the coaches. Finally, electric lighting was introduced. Early railway coaches had no heating but passengers could hire foot-warmers. These worked on the same principle a modern sodium acetate heating pads. Later, steam heating was introduced, using a steam supply from the steam locomotive. Steam heating continued into the diesel locomotive era, with steam supplied by a steam generator. Now, electric heating is almost universal and air-conditioning is often provided as well. In the case of diesel multiple units, the coaches may be heated by waste heat from the engines, as in an automobile.  Capacitors  In a subway car, tram or train, an insulator at a track switch may cut off power from the car for a few feet along the line and use a large capacitor to store energy to drive the subway car through the gap in the power feed.

He was the first Professor of pathology at Cornell University and became famous with the discovery of a form of malignant bone tumor that later became known as Ewing's sarcoma. Life James Ewing, was born in 1866 to a prominent family of Pittsburgh. When he was 14 he was diagnosed with osteomyelitis and was bedridden for two years.Simon Cotterill for Cancer Index. About James Ewing, 1866 - 1943 Last modified: 16/03/99 He first completed his B.A. in 1888 at Amherst College and then studied medicine at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of New York, from 1888 to 1891. He returned to the College of Physicians and Surgeons as instructor in histology (1893-1897), and clinical pathology (1897-1898). After a brief stint as a surgeon with the US Army, Ewing was appointed in 1899 the first professor of clinical pathology at the newly formed Medical College of Cornell University in New York, where he was the only full-time professor. In 1902, Ewing helped to establish one of the first funds for cancer research, endowed by Mrs. Collis P. Huntington. With his discoveries using that research funding, Ewing became the most important experimental oncologist and helped to found, in 1907, the American Association for Cancer Research, and in 1913, the American Society for the Control of Cancer, now the American Cancer Society. In 1906 Ewing, working with S.P. Beebe and collaborators, proved for the first time that a cancer (canine transmissible venereal tumor in dogs) could be transmitted from one animal to another.Ewing, James & Beebe, S. P. (1906).

In 1910, Ewing had approached New York Hospital about establishing a clinical research facility; when this fell through, he established a collaboration with Memorial Hospital (which would become Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) with the help of industrialist and philanthropist James Douglas, who gave $100,000 to endow twenty beds for clinical research, equipment for working with radium, and a clinical laboratory to Memorial for that purpose. Douglas' enthusiasm and funding for development of radiation therapy for cancer inspired Ewing to become one of the pioneers in developing this treatment. Ewing soon took over effective leadership of clinical and laboratory research at Memorial. In 1919 Ewing published the first edition of Neoplastic Diseases: A Text-Book on Tumors.Ewing, James. (1919). Neoplastic Diseases: A Textbook on Tumors. Philadelphia, W. B. Saunders, and London. Fourth edition 1940. The book, which is translated into numerous languages, becomes a cornerstone of modern oncology by establishing a systematic and comprehensive basis for diagnosing human cancer. In 1921 he published his first work on a new kind of malignant osteoma (cancer of the bone), which later received his name: Ewing's sarcoma.Ewing, James. (1922).

CMUs are some of the most versatile building products available because of the wide variety of appearances that can be achieved using them. Those that use cinders (fly ash or bottom ash) as an aggregate material are called cinder blocks in the United States, breeze blocks (breeze is a synonym of ash) in the United Kingdom, and hollow blocks in the Philippines. In New Zealand and Canada they are known as concrete blocks (a name common in the United States also). In New Zealand, they are also called construction blocks. In Australia they are also called Besser blocks and Besser bricks, because the Besser Company was a major supplier of machines that made concrete blocks. Clinker blocks use clinker as aggregate. In non-technical usage, the terms cinder block and breeze block are often generalized to cover all of these varieties. Composition Concrete blocks are made from cast concrete (e.g. Portland cement and aggregate, usually sand and fine gravel, for high-density blocks). Lower density blocks may use industrial wastes, such as fly ash or bottom ash, as an aggregate. Recycled materials, such as post-consumer glass, slag cement, or recycled aggregate, are often used in the composition of the blocks. Use of recycled materials within blocks can create different appearances in the block, such as a terrazzo finish, and may help the finished structure earn LEED certification. Lightweight blocks can also be produced using autoclaved aerated concrete. Sizes and structure The use of blockwork allows structures to be built in the traditional masonry style with layers (or courses) of staggered blocks. Concrete blocks may be produced with hollow centers (cores) to reduce weight, improve insulation and provide an interconnected void into which concrete can be poured to solidify the entire wall after it's built. Blocks come in modular sizes, with the most popular typically referred to (by their thickness) as \\"4-inch\\", \\"6-inch\\", \\"8-inch\\", and \\"12-inch\\". In the US, CMU blocks are nominally long and wide. Their actual dimensions are less than the nominal dimensions (to allow for -inch mortar joints between blocks in any orientation). In Ireland and the UK, blocks are usually excluding mortar joints. In Australia, New Zealand and Canada, blocks are usually excluding mortar joints. Block cores are typically tapered so that their top surface (as laid) has a greater surface on which to spread a mortar bed and for easier handling. Most CMU's have two cores, but three- and four- core units are also produced. A core also allows for the insertion of steel reinforcement to span courses in order to increase tensile strength. This is accomplished by grouting the voids of blocks containing rebar with concrete. Thus reinforced, CMU walls are better able to resist lateral forces such as wind load and seismic forces. A variety of specialized shapes exist to allow special construction features. U-shaped blocks or knockout blocks with notches to allow the construction of bond beams or lintel assemblies, using horizontal reinforcing grouted into place in the cavity. Blocks with a channel on the end, known as \\"jamb blocks\\", allow doors to be secured to wall assemblies. Blocks with grooved ends permit the construction of control joints, allowing a filler material to be anchored between the un-mortared block ends. Other features, such as radiused corners known as \\"bullnoses\\" may be incorporated. A wide variety of decorative profiles also exist. Concrete masonry units may be formulated with special aggregates to produce specific colors or textures for finish use. Special textures may be produced by splitting a ribbed or solid two-block unit; such factory-produced units are called \\"split-rib\\" or \\"split- face\\" blocks. Blocks may be scored by grooves the width of a mortar joint to simulate different block modules. For example, an block may be scored in the middle to simulate masonry, with the grooves filled with mortar and struck to match the true joints. United States Uses Concrete block, when built with integral steel reinforcing or in tandem with concrete columns and tie beams and reinforced with rebar, is a very common building material for the load-bearing walls of buildings, in what is termed concrete block structure (CBS) construction. American suburban houses typically employ a concrete foundation and slab with a concrete block wall on the perimeter. Other common uses for concrete block wall is interior fire-rated partition walls, and exterior backup wall for attachment of building envelope systems and fa√ßades. Structural properties Concrete masonry walls may be ungrouted, partially grouted, or fully grouted, the latter two enhancing their structural strength. Additionally, steel reinforcement bars (rebar) can be used both vertically and horizontally inside a CMU wall to maximize its structural performance. The cells in which the rebar is placed must be grouted for the bars to bond to the wall. For this reason, high seismic zones typically only allow fully grouted walls in their building codes. The American design code that guides design engineers in using CMU as a structural system is the Masonry Standards Joint Committee's Building Code Requirements & Specification for Masonry Structures (TMS 402/ACI 530/ASCE 5). The compressive strength of concrete masonry units and masonry walls varies from approximately to based on the type of concrete used to manufacture the unit, stacking orientation, the type of mortar used to build the wall, and other factors.

A Fabian and a member of the Labour Party, he served as Governor of Jamaica and as Secretary of State for India in the first government of Ramsay MacDonald. He was the uncle of the actor Laurence Olivier. Background Olivier was born in Colchester, the second of eight children of Anne Elizabeth Hardcastle Arnould and the Reverend Henry Arnold Olivier, a stern Anglican. His brothers included Henry (1850‚Äì1935), who had a military career ending as a colonel,Holden, p.11 Herbert, a successful portrait painter, and Gerard (1869‚Äì1939), a clergyman (the father of Laurence).Darlington, p. 13 During Olivier's youth, the family spent time at Lausanne and Kineton, and at Poulshott in Wiltshire, where Henry Olivier was rector. Sydney Olivier was sent to Tonbridge School, and then studied philosophy and theology at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. At Oxford he became a close friend of Graham Wallas, who came from a similar background. After graduation Olivier resisted family pressure to train as a barrister and instead sat the competitive examination for the Civil Service. He came first, beating Sidney Webb into second place. Olivier entered the Colonial Office in the spring of 1882, working as a resident clerk. He was joined by Webb shortly afterwards, and the two became good friends. In contrast to Webb, Olivier was an impulsive and dominating dandy, nicknamed the \\"socialist hidalgo\\". At this time Olivier also worked at Toynbee Hall in the East End of London, living in the slums of Whitechapel and teaching Latin at the Working Men's College. He was a member of the Land Reform Union, where he met George Bernard Shaw in 1883, and part of team which in 1883 established a monthly periodical called the Christian Socialist, inspired by the Christian Socialist movement of 1848‚Äì1852. Olivier had become enthusiastic about Positivism after working as a tutor to the son of Henry Compton, a leading Positivist. He was attracted to the Positivist vision of a moral reform of capitalism, rather than mere amelioration, and for a while entertained this notion as an alternative to socialism that might be more palatable to Victorian England. On 1 May 1885, Olivier and Sidney Webb followed Shaw's lead and enrolled in the Fabian Society, which had been formed at the start of 1884; Wallas joined the following year, and the three became known as the Three Musketeers of the Society, with Shaw as their D'Artagnan. Partly through Olivier, the Fabians would adopt the policy of reforming capitalism as a necessary precursor to explicitly socialist reforms, Olivier arguing that the sudden introduction of socialism would result in either anarchy or tyranny and attacking Marxism's neglect of non-economic values. The same month that he joined the Fabians, Olivier married Margaret Cox, the sister of Harold Cox, an old school friend and later a Liberal member of parliament. Olivier's wife was intimidated by the Fabians, preferring the less politically involved Simple Life movement, but Olivier was an eager member of the movement, serving as the Society's secretary from 1886 to 1890. He began speaking at the Hampstead Historic Society, a reading group for a number of Fabians, and developed his speaking skills to address larger meetings. In the summer of 1887 he took part in the Fabians' mock legislature experiment, the Charing Cross Parliament, as Colonial Secretary. Fabian and civil servant In 1888 Olivier wrote the seventh Fabian tract, Capital and Land, in which he criticised Georgism (a system, popular with some Radicals and Christian Socialists, in which land continued to be privately owned and managed but should be taxed for the benefit of the community) and instead advocated the communal ownership and control of land. That year he performed with Annie Besant clerical duties at the strike headquarters during the Bryant and May match factory strike. By now he was one of the \\"Big Four\\" of the Fabian movement in London, with Shaw, Webb and Wallas. In 1889 he wrote Moral Aspects of the Basis of Socialism in the Essays in Fabian Socialism, an attempt to develop a distinct programme for the Fabians. That year he stood down as Secretary of the Fabian Society, being succeeded by Edward R. Pease. The Oliviers bought a holiday home in Limpsfield in the North Downs; they had two daughters by now, and a third was born in November. He was a guest speaker at the London School of Economics, which had many Fabian connections. In October 1890, having established an excellent reputation at the Colonial Office, Sydney Olivier was appointed as acting Colonial Secretary of British Honduras. He continued to be active in the Fabian Society during his periods back in London. In 1891 the Oliviers made a permanent home in Limpsfield; several other Fabians and radicals moved to the area, and they soon became the dominant force on the parish council. In 1892, Olivier and Shaw attacked Robert Blatchford, Fabian leader in Manchester, for calling for members to boycott both the Conservative and Liberal parties at the ballot, regardless of the policies of individual candidates. In 1895 he was posted to the Leeward Islands as Auditor-General, a special appointment to examine and reorganise the finances of the colony. After this he returned to London, working as Private Secretary to the Under-Secretary to the Colonial Office, Lord Selbourne. In 1897 he became Secretary to the West Indian Royal Commission, and during 1898 he went to Washington to take part in trade negotiations on behalf of the West Indian Colonies. In the run-up to the Second Boer War, the executive of the Fabian Society became split. Some Fabians, including Olivier and Ramsay MacDonald, adhering to the traditional Liberal opposition to militarism and imperialism, opposed the war; Olivier claimed that the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Joseph Chamberlain, had engineered the conflict to increase British holdings in South Africa. Other Fabians, including Webb and Shaw, believed military action could be used to promote democracy and civilisation, whilst some also felt that the best policy was to reform the British Empire rather than, as Olivier advocated, retreating from it. The majority of the leading Fabians believed that it was a just war and that the native population would be better off under the British than under the Boers, whom many saw as religious fundamentalists and bigots. After a series of close votes, the executive came out in support of the declaration of war, although the Society would change its position during the war, as the government's conduct came under scrutiny. Governor of Jamaica alt=Photo of Sir Sydney and his four daughters on horseback in Jamaica in 1903 Having caused a stir in Downing Street by voicing his opposition to the war and his criticisms of Chamberlain, Olivier was posted as Colonial Secretary in Jamaica, departing in early 1900. He again enhanced his reputation as a colonial administrator, and was acting governor later in 1900 and again in 1902. This posting ended in 1903 and Olivier returned to England, but he went back to Jamaica a short while later to work in relief and rehabilitation following a devastating hurricane, and served as acting governor for a third time. He returned to England in September 1904, and spent three years as Principal Secretary to the West Africa and West Indian Department of the Colonial Office. During this time he was again active in the Fabian Society. Feeling that the society had been stagnating since 1897, he hoped that a prominent new member, H. G. Wells, would be able to re-energise it. He supported Wells' campaign for a more radical Fabian agenda in 1906, but by the end of the year he had come to find Wells too erratic. In 1907, following a devastating earthquake in Jamaica, Olivier returned to the colony as governor. He was appointed a KCMG, making him Sir Sydney Olivier. He quickly reestablished order after the earthquake, and his reforms of the colony's government proved to be very popular. He was responsible for the construction of the Public Buildings in downtown Kingston in which the bureaucracy and courts were housed after the earthquake. He served in this post until 1913 then returned to England permanently, though he took very little part in Fabian activities upon his return. Moving outside of the Colonial Office, he served as Permanent Secretary to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries for four years, then as assistant comptroller and auditor of the Exchequer from 1917 until 1920, when he retired from the civil service to devote himself to philosophical and political study. However, this proved not to be the end of his public life. The Sydney Olivier Interscholastic Challenge Shield is the oldest and most prestigious schoolboy football title in Jamaica. The competition started in 1909 and the Shield is played between winners of DaCosta Cup for Rural Area Champions and Manning Cup for Urban Area Champions. Peer and Secretary of State for India In January 1924 Olivier was appointed Secretary of State for India in the first Labour government and sworn of the Privy Council The following month he was raised to the peerage by Ramsay MacDonald as Baron Olivier, of Ramsden in the County of Oxford. His appointment as India Secretary dismayed those who had expected the office to go to Josiah Wedgwood, a supporter of the Indian independence movement. Under Olivier there was no departure from the Conservative policy on India, although Mahatma Gandhi was released from prison after serving only two years out of a six-year sentence. Olivier's attitude to Empire had changed and he rejected calls for a new conference to discuss changes to the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms of 1921, reaffirming the traditional argument that Britain's contribution to India gave it a right to be there and that the native Indians were not ready for self-government. Privately, he believed that the problems of India could not be solved at that time or by a minority Labour government, and resolved to merely defend the status quo. In July 1924, he sided unsuccessfully with Wedgwood, Philip Snowden and J. H. Thomas in the Cabinet, opposing the promise of a loan to the Soviet Union, and was critical of MacDonald's decision to call an unnecessary election later that year. MacDonald did not give him an office in the Labour government of 1929, instead sending him to the West Indies to investigate the sugar trade. Following this he retired for the final time, living in the Cotswolds and then Sussex. He had tried writing poetry during his early years but without any success. He wrote throughout his life, faring better with a few plays (first performed at the Fabian Society) and a Fabian paper on √âmile Zola (1890), but was most noted for several books on colonial matters, including White Capital and Coloured Labour in 1906 and Jamaica, the Blessed Island in 1936. Having no sons, Olivier's peerage became extinct upon his death in 1943. His nephew, the actor Laurence Olivier, would be granted a life peerage in 1970 as Baron Olivier, of Brighton in East Sussex. Family life Four daughters were born to the couple: Hon. Margery Olivier (1886‚Äì1974), Hon. Brynhild Olivier (20 May 1887 ‚Äì 13 January 1935), Hon. Daphne Olivier (1889 ‚Äì 14 July 1950) and Hon. No√´l Olivier (1893‚Äì1969). They were prominent in the Cambridge and Bloomsbury social circles around Rupert Brooke and in what Virginia Woolf dubbed the Neo-Pagans. Evelyn Louise Nicholson, Olivier, was his sister. After his death, his wife Margaret edited and published his letters and other writings.

Early depictions of some form of han as an individual expression are found in examples of traditional Korean stories, poems, and songs. An example of han as a collective expression was observed by Westerners in 1907, but a national culture of han did not exist in Korea. The contemporary concept of han, that it is a national characteristic of the Korean people, is a modern phenomenon that originated during the Japanese occupation of Korea from Japanese colonial stereotypes and the characterization of Korean art and culture as \\"sorrowful\\" in Yanagi S≈çetsu's theory of the \\"beauty of sorrow\\". The idea that han is a specifically Korean characteristic was adopted and popularized by Koreans in the 20th century. A central aspect of han today is loss of identity. Han is most commonly associated with families who were separated during the Korean War. New generations of Koreans seemingly inherit han because of growing up in a divided country. Han is depicted in many aspects of modern Korean culture, such as film and contemporary pansori.  Definitions and characteristics  Han is derived from the Chinese character ÊÅ®, which means resentment, hatred, or regret. Definitions and characteristics of han are highly subjective. According to the Translation Journal, \\"Han is frequently translated as sorrow, spite, rancor, regret, resentment or grief, among many other attempts to explain a concept that has no English equivalent.\\" The novelist Pak Kyongni describes han as both sadness and hope. The film director Im Kwon-Taek, many of whose films deal with han, says that Koreans have different interpretations of han. Joshua D. Pilzer defines han: \\"A complex emotional cluster often translated as 'resentful sorrow.' Thought by many to be essentially Korean, and by many others to be the product of modern, post-colonial efforts to create a 'Korean' essence.\\" ; Essentialist view * Kim Yol-kyu defined han as \\"the collective trauma and the memories of sufferings imposed upon [the Korean people] in the name of oppression over the course of the nation's five thousand-odd years of history\\". Kim said that the meaning of han is ambiguous. Kim Yol-kyu provided examples of stories, poems, and songs in which some form of han is depicted. * The minjung theologian Suh Nam-dong described han as \\"a feeling of unresolved resentment against injustices suffered, a sense of helplessness because of the overwhelming odds against one, a feeling of acute pain in one's guts and bowels, making the whole body writhe and squirm, and an obstinate urge to take revenge and to right the wrong‚Äîall these combined\\". * Jon Huer describes han as a generational feeling of \\"having been 'wronged' by a superior agent\\", such as fate or the government; he says that the accumulated han in Korea is enormous because of a long history of suffering from invasion, poverty, and international indifference. * According to John M. Glionna, han is \\"intensely personal, yet carried around collectively, a national torch, a badge of suffering tempered by a sense of resiliency\\". ; Modern view * Michael D. Shin describes han: \\"In fact, it's modern. It's a term that captures something of the modern experience of Koreans.\\" Shin says that defining han in terms of emotions is highly subjective; almost any negative emotion can be called \\"han\\". He argues that the central aspect of han is loss of identity, and defines han as \\"the complex of emotions that result from the traumatic loss of collective identity\\". Han is most commonly associated with divided families: families who were separated during the Korean War. According to Shin, all Koreans may experience han, or a \\"constant feeling of being less than whole\\", because of not having a collective identity as a result of the continued division of Korea. Furthermore, new generations of Koreans seemingly inherit it because of growing up in a divided country. * Sandra So Hee Chi Kim argues that the current usage of the word han in Korean is \\"a postcolonial translation of a Japanese colonial construct\\". Similar manifestations of han exist in other Asian languages and cultures, but it has acquired ethnonationalist and essentialist tones in Korea. * According to Joshua D. Pilzer, the idea of han as a national characteristic is recent and arises from Koreans' \\"modern search for national essences in the wake of colonialism, and in the midst of authoritarian capitalist development and national division\\".  History   Han in premodern Korea  \\"Han\\" is not found in the first Korean‚ÄìEnglish dictionary, published by James S. Gale in 1897, and is rarely found in classical Korean literature. According to Michael D. Shin: \\"In actuality, classical Korean literature is full of joy and satire and humor, stuff that you don't associate with han. Han is a very small and minor part of classical Korean literature.\\" According to Go Misuk, han in classical Korean literature was rare but suddenly became more prominent in the early 20th century. Traditional Korean stories almost always have happy endings. According to Kim Yol-kyu, Koreans used humor as one way to relieve pent-up han, which is why han is always accompanied by humor in folk music and pansori. All surviving pansori epics have happy endings. According to Michael D. Shin, a collective expression of han was observed by Western missionaries during the Great Pyongyang Revival of 1907. William Blair, a missionary, described the revival: \\"Then began a meeting the like of which I had never seen before, nor wish to see again unless in God's sight it is absolutely necessary. Every sin a human being can commit was publicly confessed that night.\\" Lord William Cecil observed: \\"[The missionary] reached only the words \\"My Father\\" when with a rush a power from without seemed to take hold of the meeting. The Europeans described its manifestations as terrifying. Nearly everybody present was seized with the most poignant sense of mental anguish; before each one his own sins seemed to be rising in condemnation of his life.\\" Shin calls what they observed a very raw form of han, and argues that the \\"awkward\\" and \\"terrifying\\" way in which it was expressed suggests that a culture of han did not exist at that time. According to William Blair, it was an outpouring of the Holy Spirit.  Han in modern Korea  Yanagi S≈çetsu was prompted to write about the \\"beauty of sorrow\\" by the March First Movement, in which approximately 2,000,000 Koreans participated in more than 1,500 demonstrations. A very raw form of han, on a collective level, was observed in 1907, but a national culture of han did not exist in Korea. The concept of han, as a national characteristic, originated from Yanagi S≈çetsu's theory of the \\"beauty of sorrow\\" () and Japanese colonial stereotypes of Korea and its people. Following the March First Movement, an independence movement that ended with the death of about 7,000 Koreans at the hands of the Japanese police and military, the Japanese art critic Yanagi S≈çetsu wrote articles in 1919 and 1920, expressing sympathy for the Korean people and appreciation for Korean art. In his 1920 article, Yanagi said: \\"The long, harsh and painful history of Korea is expressed in the hidden loneliness and sadness of their art. It always has a sad beauty and loneliness that brings you to tears. When I look at it, I can not control the emotion that fills my heart. Where else can I find such beauty of sadness.\\" The characterization of Korea as sad and stagnant was common in Imperial Japan; Japanese historiography of Korea was centered on the idea that Korea was stagnant. To justify the colonization of Korea, the Japanese propagated an image of Koreans as an inferior, uncivilized people, who were incapable of being independent and prone to being invaded and oppressed. The Japanese viewed Korea's \\"sorrow\\" as being because of \\"a national history of unremitting disaster\\". Yanagi's views of Korea mirrored those of contemporary Japanese colonial politics. Yanagi said that Korean history was characterized by instability, invasion, and subservience; the \\"sadness\\" of Korean history was said to be manifested in Korean art, which, according to Yanagi, embodied the \\"beauty of sorrow\\". Yanagi contributed to the naturalization of Japanese colonialism in Korea. The last Korean emperor, Sunjong, was directly associated with han. Following his death in 1926, an article said that his \\"life of han\\" ended in sadness. The Dong-a Ilbo wrote: \\"The anger, bitterness, and sorrow built up inside us have become mixed together, and it could be said that the passing of the Yunghui Emperor [Sunjong] has touched the hearts of the Joseon people and released their pent- up sadness.\\" Han became political because Sunjong's death symbolized the end of Korean history. Yanagi S≈çetsu was an influential figure in colonial Korea, and was accepted as a true friend by contemporary Koreans; he sought to preserve the traditional art of Korea, held fund-raising lectures and concerts for humanitarian aid, and spoke out in defense of Korean people and cultural heritage. Moderate Korean nationalists, who had a non-confrontational approach toward Japanese authority, supported Yanagi, and the Dong-a Ilbo actively promoted and sponsored him. Yanagi was admired by prominent figures in the fields of history, art, and media, who had a profound influence on the formation of modern Korean concepts of traditional art, aesthetics, and history. The concept of han, based on the \\"beauty of sorrow\\", was propagated by Korean scholars and writers, continuing Yanagi's legacy, and gradually spread to the entire education system. According to Jeong Il-seong, the passage of modern Korean history, going from the Japanese occupation to independence to national division to civil war to military dictatorship, influenced figures in art and culture to adopt the concept of han. Sandra So Hee Chi Kim's article on han says that \\"the term han itself emerged as a significant ideological concept during the 1970s\\" and \\"[s]ome contend that it was during the Park Chung Hee regime that the idea of han transformed from a personal sense of sorrow and resentment to a broader, national experience of unrelenting suffering and injustice\\". Han was used politically to promote \\"Korean uniqueness\\" and ethnic-national solidarity through a sense of \\"shared suffering\\". Han acquired a biologistic aspect, as seen in descriptions of han by the poet Ko Un, \\"We Koreans were born from the womb of Han and brought up in the womb of Han\\", and the film critic Ahn Byung-Sup, \\"Han is an inherent characteristic of the Korean character ... It becomes part of the blood and breath of a person\\". Korean theologians anachronistically argued that han was a national sentiment in premodern Korea. During the authoritarian regime of Park Chung Hee, the idea of han, and thus resentment and suffering, as a national characteristic of the Korean people may have been an ideological state apparatus to indoctrinate the working class into accepting the hardships of rapid industrialization and economic inequality; the idea of sadness being an inherent Korean trait had served a similar purpose during the Japanese occupation to naturalize the suffering of the colonized Koreans. Sunghee Choi, an art education scholar, said that her inculcation of han in education started as early as elementary school.  Criticism of the \\"beauty of sorrow\\"  Yanagi S≈çetsu viewed the \\"whiteness\\" of Joseon white porcelain, among other aspects of Korean culture, as the color of sadness. Yanagi later revised his view: Joseon white porcelain emanates from an \\"instinctive faith in nature\\", not sadness. Citing historical examples, Kim Talsu argues that, from a Korean perspective, white is the color of humor and dynamism. Yanagi S≈çetsu's theory of the \\"beauty of sorrow\\" has received criticism in both Korea and, more recently, Japan. It has been described as prejudiced, imperialistic, orientalist, sentimentalist, colonialist, and under-theorized. Yanagi's interpretation of Korean history and art has been disputed. The \\"beauty of sorrow\\" was criticized by Koreans as early as 1922. In 1974, the poet Choe Harim published an influential article that established the \\"aesthetics of colonialism\\" and accused Yanagi's theory of imperialism, colonialism, sentimentalism, and a \\"superficial interpretation of Korean history\\". Choe criticized Yanagi's view, that Korean art has a \\"beauty of sorrow\\" because Korea has long suffered at the hands of foreign countries, as being in accordance with Japanese colonial policies, which, he said, were intended to instill a sense of defeat and shame in Koreans about Korean history. Mark Peterson disagrees with the view that Korea experienced many invasions, a view that he says is a 20th-century phenomenon that was advocated during the Japanese colonial period, and argues that Korea experienced very few invasions and had long periods of peace and stability. Peterson also disagrees with the Japanese colonial view of Korea as stagnant, inefficient, and corrupt. John Duncan calls the idea that Korea experienced constant invasions or that Korea has a \\"history of suffering\\" () a myth, and argues that premodern Korean history is characterized by very long periods of peace. According to David C. Kang, the dominant narrative depicting Korean history as \\"one of almost incessant foreign incursions\\" is a meme that emerged in the 20th century. Mari Nakami says that Yanagi did not profess to be an expert or intend for his theory to be an \\"objective observation\\" or a \\"scientifically approached scholarly study\\", but rather \\"an expression of the human heart\\". Furthermore, Nakami argues that the \\"beauty of sorrow\\" was not the only perspective Yanagi had of Korean art: He expressed admiration and praise for Korean art, such as the Seokguram, and believed that most Japanese national art was Korean in origin or an imitation of Korean art. Yanagi gradually changed his theory of Korean art from the \\"beauty of sorrow\\" to the \\"beauty of health\\", the \\"beauty of naturalness\\", and the \\"beauty of unity\\". Despite receiving criticism for his theory, Yanagi S≈çetsu has oft been praised for his humanism and preservation of traditional Korean art. In 1984, he was posthumously awarded the Bogwan Order of Cultural Merit, the first to be awarded to a non-Korean.  Proverbs  > Frost can fall even in May and June, if a woman harbors a grudge [han]. (A > woman's vengeance knows no bounds.) Han is expressed in many Korean proverbs, with central themes being womanhood, also known as yeohan (), and poverty. According to Kim Yol-kyu, \\"\\" (as poor as a church mouse) is about han.  In popular culture  Han, as a theme, is expressed in contemporary pansori. In the late 20th century, the sorrowful \\"Western style\\" of pansori overtook the vigorous \\"Eastern style\\" of pansori, and pansori began being called the \\"sound of han\\". All surviving pansori epics end happily, but contemporary pansori focuses on the trials and tribulations of the characters, commonly without reaching the happy ending because of the contemporary popularity of excerpt performances. The history of pansori in the late 20th century, including the recent canonization of han, has led to great concern in the pansori community. In American media, han has been referenced in Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown, \\"Koreatown, Los Angeles\\", and The West Wing, \\"Han\\".  In the Korean diaspora  Korean American scholar Elaine H. Kim has written on han in relation to the 1992 Los Angeles riots. In Korean American literary works (e.g., Dictee by Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, The Language of Blood by Jane Jeong Trenka, Notes from the Divided Country by Suji Kwock Kim, and Comfort Woman by Nora Okja Keller) Americans of Korean descent are sometimes portrayed as experiencing \\"Americanized\\" or second-generational han.  Hwabyeong  According to a study from 1994, based on personal interviews, exposure to han was deemed one of the main causes of hwabyeong.

The Carta de Foral, or simply Foral, was a royal document in Portugal and its former empire, whose purpose was to establish a concelho (Council) and regulate its administration, borders and privileges. A newly founded town would also need the king's approval through a Foral, in order to be considered one. In this case, the town's administration and privileges would be defined in that document. Forais were granted between the 12th and the 16th centuries. The Foral was the basis for municipal foundation, thus the most important event of a city or town's history. It was critical to a successful land settling and an increase in crop yields, by giving more freedom and dignity, via a concession, to farmers, in an age when people were subject to near slave work, as servants of landlords. The Foral made a concelho free from feudal control, transferring power down to a neighbours council (concelho), with its own municipal autonomy. As a result, the population would become directly and exclusively under the dominion and jurisdiction of the crown, excluding the Lord from the power hierarchy. The Foral granted public lands to the collective use of the community, regulated taxes, tolls and fines and established protection rights and military duties within royal service. A pillory (pelourinho) is directly linked to a Foral. It was raised after the Foral was granted and placed in the main square of the town.

From 1970 through 2020, it served as home field of the Pawtucket Red Sox (PawSox), a Minor League Baseball affiliate of the Boston Red Sox. Completed in 1942, the stadium first hosted an affiliated minor league team in 1946, the Pawtucket Slaters, a Boston Braves farm team. In 1981, the stadium hosted the longest professional baseball game in history, as the PawSox defeated the Rochester Red Wings in 33 innings by a score of 3‚Äì2. History Early years The project to build the stadium began in 1938 and was championed by then- Pawtucket Mayor Thomas P. McCoy. It was to be built on a swampy piece of land known as Hammond's Pond and, to this day, the stadium sits at the end of Pond Street. On the afternoon of November 3, 1940, Mayor McCoy laid the foundation cornerstone. Initially known as Pawtucket Stadium, it was completed in 1942, and in 1946 was officially named in honor of Mayor McCoy, who had died in August 1945. McCoy Stadium first began hosting affiliated Minor League Baseball in 1946. The Pawtucket Slaters, a Class B affiliate of the Boston Braves, was the first team to call McCoy Stadium home. The Pawtucket Slaters would play for four seasons in the New England League, as Braves affiliates. Professional baseball disappeared from Pawtucket for 16 years. It finally returned in 1966, as McCoy became home of the Pawtucket Indians, who competed at the Double-A level in the Eastern League as an affiliate of the Cleveland Indians. After two seasons, the Indians moved to Waterbury, Connecticut, and McCoy was again without a team. Red Sox arrival In 1969, the Boston Red Sox had their Eastern League affiliate, the Pittsfield Red Sox of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, play at McCoy Stadium twice‚Äîone game in July and a doubleheader in August; the two events drew a total of over 10,000 fans. After the season, it was reported that the Pittsfield Red Sox would be relocated to McCoy Stadium. The team moved prior to the 1970 season, becoming the Pawtucket Red Sox, known colloquially as the \\"PawSox\\". The franchise spent three seasons playing in the Double-A Eastern League before being promoted to the Triple-A International League. In 1976, debt-ridden owner Phil Anez threatened to move the team to New Jersey, but sold the franchise to Marvin Adelson, who lost the ballclub after threatening to move to Massachusetts. During that year, the team was briefly known as the Rhode Island Red Sox, but that name lasted just one season. Just before the 1977 season, Canadian expatriate businessman Ben Mondor arrived and successfully resurrected the fallen franchise. Mondor owned the team until his death on October 3, 2010, and was a well-beloved member of the community, as he turned the ballpark and franchise into one of the most fan-friendly in all of professional baseball. The PawSox brought four championship titles to McCoy Stadium and Pawtucket, winning the Governors' Cup (the International League championship since 1933) in 1973, 1984, 2012, and 2014. Red Sox departure In February 2015, a group of New England business leaders, led by Larry Lucchino, purchased the Pawtucket Red Sox. In August 2018, ownership announced that it would relocate the team to a new stadium in Worcester, Massachusetts, in April 2021, becoming the Worcester Red Sox. While 2020 was planned to be the PawSox' final season of play at McCoy Stadium, the Minor League Baseball season was cancelled, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Thus, the final game contested by the PawSox at McCoy Stadium was the team's last game of the 2019 International League season, a 5‚Äì4 home victory over the Lehigh Valley IronPigs in 10 innings, played on September 2, 2019. During the 2020 Major League Baseball season, McCoy Stadium served as the alternate training site for the Boston Red Sox. Future plans Without the PawSox as a tenant, the future of McCoy Stadium is unclear. In December 2019, Pawtucket's mayor, Donald Grebien, indicated options include bringing another minor league team to Pawtucket or \\"tearing the ballpark down for a new use.\\" Stadium features The scoreboard in left field One of the unique features of the ballpark is the expansive foul territory. The foul area forms a complete semicircle between first and third, and in order to fit the baselines in between the ends of the seating areas, the area behind home plate is quite vast. This is especially notable since the major league Red Sox' home park, Fenway Park, has the smallest foul territory in the majors. The two dugouts are actually embedded into the wall underneath the grandstands (as are the luxury boxes, just beyond them). The first row of seats is elevated eight feet above field level. Despite that unusual box seat elevation, those seeking autographs of the players have found a way to contact their PawSox, using a technique more common to fans in bleacher seats behind an outfield wall. Fans wishing to have a scorebook, baseball, baseball card, or other souvenir signed by a player will go autograph \\"fishing\\". Complete with hook and reel (or, often, a hollowed-out milk jug and a rope), autograph seekers lower their items over the front of the seats and dangle them down in front of the dugouts below. The ballplayers can sign the item, tug on the line, and the fan pulls up their newly autographed memorabilia. A series of murals depicting notable former PawSox players was displayed in the stadium prior to the 1998 renovation, but was taken down since the new stadium configuration resulted in fans not passing them anymore. In 2004, after many fans asked what happened to them, funds were made available to restore and re- hang the old murals, as well as commission a few new ones of more recent players. Some six dozen paintings now adorn the entrance ramps throughout the stadium. The left-field berm provides great views of the action, and affords families on a budget an inexpensive way to enjoy the ballpark. Above the berms are walkways, affording patrons 360¬∞ views of the ballpark. They are made especially for the handicapped from which to utilize and enjoy the game. Renovations For many years, McCoy Stadium was not up to International League standards. The park had only 6,000 seats and was barely handicapped accessible. There were also a number of broken seats, and the facility was starting to show structural issues in the mid-1990s. For several years, the team's ownership was unsure of what to do, and it was even announced that the PawSox might be moved to Worcester, Massachusetts. Eventually, owner Ben Mondor announced that they would renovate the facility, and that renovations would be done to maintain the historical integrity of the ballpark. The renovations began in 1998 and included a new terraced berm in left field, a grassy knoll where fans can sit next to the PawSox bullpen and watch the game up close. The seating capacity was increased to 10,031 by adding three full sections of seats. In addition to the original quarter-circle seating bowl, McCoy now features an extended left-field line seating area and souvenir stand, as well as outfield bleacher seating and new parking areas. Luxury boxes were constructed below the new seating area at field level. All seats are now accessed through an entry tower near third base, instead of the circular ramps which still remain behind home plate. The seats are elevated above the field, and patrons must climb two sets of stairs (or take an elevator) to reach the main concourse and outfield berm areas. With the renovations to the stadium, the Pawtucket Red Sox raised their average game day attendance to a league leading 9,561 in 2005. Notable games and incidents * On April 18, 1981, the Pawtucket Red Sox began the longest game in professional baseball history. For 20 innings, the PawSox battled the Rochester Red Wings in a 1‚Äì1 tie. The Red Wings would finally score in the top of the 21st inning to take the lead. The PawSox then scored a run in the bottom of the inning. The game was far from over. The game went on until 4:07 a.m. because the umpires did not have a curfew rule in their copy of the rule book. Finally the league president was reached and demanded that the game be suspended. The score was tied, 2‚Äì2 after the 32nd inning. When the game finally did resume on June 23, it took only 18 minutes to complete, as Dave Koza of the PawSox drove in the winning run in the bottom of the 33rd inning. Two future Hall of Famers were part of the historic game. Cal Ripken, Jr. went 2‚Äì13 on the night playing third base for Rochester. Wade Boggs played third base for Pawtucket and went 4‚Äì12 with a double and an RBI. 19 fans remained in the stands when the game was called for the night, and they received lifetime passes to McCoy Stadium. * On April 9, 1992, during the PawSox' home opener against Rochester, WJAR-TV sports reporter Joe Rocco started a live report on the side of the field, while the game was in progress, for that day's 6 p.m. edition of \\"News Watch 10\\". Because the bright newscamera lights bothered some of the players, the home plate umpire went over and told Rocco that they were not going to hold up the game for a live news report. Rocco asked for 30 seconds to finish his report, but the umpire refused and called security to eject Rocco, forcing Rocco to end his live report. * On July 3, 2001, PawSox player Israel \\"Izzy\\" Alcantara was hit by a pitch by Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons pitcher Blas Cede√±o. Feeling that he had been thrown at, Alcantara responded by kicking catcher Jeremy Salazar in the chest and then charging the mound. The pitcher backed away, and after momentarily trying to get anyone on the Red Barons to fight, Alcantara was engulfed in the ensuing bench-clearing brawl. Alcantara was suspended for six games. * On July 14, 2004, McCoy Stadium hosted the Triple-A All-Star Game between the International League and the Pacific Coast League. The IL won the game, 4‚Äì3 in 10 innings, before a crowd of 11,192. * On April 26, 2006, Durham Bulls player and Tampa Bay Devil Rays prospect Delmon Young (younger brother of Dmitri Young) threw a bat at a replacement umpire who had ejected him from the game. Young struck out on a called third strike, and stood at the plate (silently, according to PawSox catcher Corky Miller) before walking away. When the umpire signaled that he was ejected, Young responded by throwing his bat, end-over-end, at the umpire, who was hit in his chest protector with the bat. The International League suspended Young for 50 games for the incident. * McCoy has seen two perfect games thrown by PawSox pitchers. On June 1, 2000, Tomokazu Ohka defeated the Charlotte Knights 2‚Äì0, needing just 76 pitches to retire all 27 Charlotte batters. On August 10, 2003, Bronson Arroyo blanked the Buffalo Bisons by a score of 7‚Äì0. Arroyo was called up to the Boston Red Sox later that month. Attendance When Ben Mondor bought control of the team in 1977, the PawSox drew only 70,354 fans (1,082 per game) to McCoy, which seated 5,800 people at the time. A few seats were added along the way, and during the mid-1990s, the park's capacity was listed as 7,002. In 1999, the first season after the McCoy expansion, the PawSox averaged a paid attendance of 8,403 per game, and in 2000 it increased to 8,733. That figure represented 87% of every seat for every game being sold, where no other team in the league was above 70%. The club's top two attendance figures have come in 2004 and 2005, and with a paid attendance of 688,421, the '05 PawSox ranked fourth among all minor-league teams in any sport in North America. In New England, they ranked as the biggest draw of any sporting event except their parent club, the Red Sox at Fenway Park. Going into the 2006 season, the top 88 single-game attendance figures have come in the past seven years since the expansion. The current record crowd of 11,802 was set on September 5, 2004, for a late-season game against Scranton with the PawSox in playoff contention. (The season finale the next day, at 11,067, ranks 13th.) Prior to the expansion, the notable single- game record occurred on July 1, 1982, when 9,389 showed up for the pitching match-up of Mark Fidrych versus Dave Righetti. Other events Political rally On October 30, 1944, then Senator and Vice-Presidential candidate Harry S. Truman addressed a Democratic rally at the stadium, in support of re- electing President Franklin D. Roosevelt. High school football McCoy Stadium in football configuration. Once a year, on the night before Thanksgiving, football is played inside McCoy Stadium. Tolman High School and Saint Raphael Academy play their regular season games at the adjacent Pariseau Field (also known as the McCoy Annex). But, for 73 years, the two schools played each other on Thanksgiving, with most of those games played inside McCoy Stadium. That holiday rivalry ended in 2001 but the games still continue. The schools alternate the use of the stadium. Tolman hosts their new rival, the crosstown Shea High School, on the odd-number years. Saint Raphael will host Moses Brown School on the even-number years. In the mid-1990s the original Saints-Tolman game moved from Thanksgiving morning to the night before. Concerts For three years, McCoy Stadium hosted an annual concert during the summer. Bob Dylan was the first to perform at the stadium in 2006. Collective Soul, Live and Counting Crows performed in 2007. In 2008, Boston- based bands The Mighty Mighty Bosstones and Dropkick Murphys performed at McCoy as part of a three-stadium tour. The tour also included LeLacheur Park in Lowell, Massachusetts and Hadlock Field in Portland, Maine. These stadiums are also home Boston Red Sox minor league teams, respectively the Lowell Spinners and Portland Sea Dogs. Dining on the Diamond After the cancellation of the 2020 minor league baseball season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the PawSox developed a \\"Dining on the Diamond\\" program which served dinner to nearly 6,000 people on the baseball field from June through August, with a waiting list of more than 3,600 entering September.

Their early releases had the sound of youth crew, with lyrics relating to social issues or being straight edge. The later material was a lot more emo influenced, integrating more emotional lyrics, softer vocal delivery and octave chords. This eventually led the way for other straight edge/hardcore bands to do so, such as Split Lip and Falling Forward.

Historically in Lancashire, it is surrounded by Crossens, High Park and Marshside in the ancient parish of North Meols on the northern fringe of what is now Southport.  History  In 1575, a shipwreck occurred off the Churchtown coast, the cargo of which contained potatoes, was washed ashore. Subsequently, the village became the first place in England where they were grown. The Botanic Gardens was at one time the terminus for the Southport tram system, and evidence can be seen in the large turning circle at the front of the gardens. Stocks dating from 1741 can be found adjacent to the church wall on St. Cuthbert's Road close to Botanic Gardens. The centre of the old village retains much of its character from bygone ages - with the green in front of St Cuthbert's Church flanked by the two local pubs - the Bold Arms and the Hesketh Arms. This is covered by a preservation order which covers much of Botanic Road, where some thatched cottages still exist. On one side of the Hesketh Arms is the entrance to Meols Hall, home of the Hesketh family.  Geography  Churchtown is situated in North West England. The closest cities are Preston to the north east and Liverpool to the south. Churchtown is a suburb of Southport which has the nearest town centre. To the North of Churchtown, is Crossens, which is the most northerly suburb of Southport. To the west of Churchtown is Marshside, to the east High Park, and to the south is the Hesketh Park area. The village is one of many villages on the West Lancashire Coastal Plain, most of the village is only slightly above sea-level just like the nearby village of Banks which means the village can be susceptible to flooding during heavy rainfall. There are embankments to the north of nearby Marshside and there are drainage systems across the area, the closest being the Three Pools Waterway to the East of the village which is controlled by the pumping station at the Banks/ Crossens border.  Education  Churchtown has one primary school (Churchtown Primary School) which is situated on St Cuthbert's Road and access is also available via Botanic Gardens The school is a \\"community school\\" (i.e. not a church school) but is closely associated with St Cuthbert's Church. It is among the ten biggest primary schools in the country, with nearly 900 pupils, and was described by OFSTED in February 2010 as \\"outstanding\\" (grade 1). In 2017, there was a further short inspection and the school was rated \\"good\\" https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/files/2733805/urn/104861.pdf  Religious Sites  St Cuthberts Church from the Grave Yard 2008 The Village has three Churches * St Cuthbert's Church - Church of England - St Cuthberts Road * Churchtown United Reformed Church - Non-Conformist - Botanic Road * Marshside Road Methodist Church - borders the fine line between Churchtown and Marshside.

The line closed in 1964. The A565 road runs through the north of the village and is considered by some local people to be the boundary of Churchtown and Marshside. There are many bus stops throughout the village and local area which link to all over the Southport area and suburbs, with services extending into Liverpool, West Lancashire, and Preston.

Landmarks Ely's Arch Ely's Arch Braemor Road is still marked by a triumphal arch from the 18th century, which originally led to Rathfarnham Castle. The erection of this gateway is attributed to Henry Loftus, Earl of Ely from 1769 to 1783 who was also responsible for the classical work on the castle itself. The arch is named the new gate on Frizell's map of 1779. After the division of the estate in 1913 the arch became the entrance to the Castle Golf Club but was later abandoned in favour of the more direct Woodside Drive entrance. Braemor Road (and Braemor Drive, Braemor Avenue, etc.) was developed in the late 1940s and early 1950s by builders called Brady and Morton. They conflated and abbreviated the names resulting in the name Braemor.Streetnames and Placenames DLR Bottle Tower Bottle Tower The Bottle Tower (or Hall's Barn) is a structure on Whitehall Road. It was built by Major Hall in 1742 in imitation of the better constructed Wonderful Barn erected about the same period near Leixlip. The floors and other timber work have long disappeared and the winding stone steps are not considered safe to ascend. While the ground floor may have been used as a barn, the first and second floors appear to have been residential as they are both fitted with fireplaces. A smaller structure behind the barn, built on somewhat similar lines was a pigeon house. The old house named Whitehall, which was demolished some years ago, stood adjacent to the barn. It was also built by Major Hall around the same time. In 1778 it became the residence of Rev. Jeremy Walsh, curate of Dundrum, and in 1795 it was converted into a boarding house by Mr. Ml. Kelly. A newspaper advertisement in 1816 invites enquiries from prospective visitors. In a description written in the last century the old-fashioned kitchen and panelled staircase are specially noted. Lewis' Topographical Dictionary of Ireland (1837) features many of the old houses in Churchtown under the reference village of Rathfarnham. The houses include Landscape, of H. O'Callaghan, Esq.; Whitehall, of W. P. Matthews, Esq.; Newtown, of John Kirby, Esq., LL.D., M.D., in the grounds of which there are some very fine evergreens. Also included is Barton Lodge, of W. Conlan, Esq. which probably gave the name of Barton Road, Rathfarnam and Barton Road East, Churchtown. Nutgrove, of P. Jones, Esq. which was situated on Nutgrove Avenue, halfway between the Good Shepherd church and Rathfarnam village and Whitehall, of T. Laffan, Esq., an out-office of which is built in the shape of a pottery furnace, with a winding flight of steps on the outside to the top, whence there is a commanding prospect of the surrounding country repeats our description of the Bottle Tower.A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland by Samuel Lewis, 1837, Library Ireland Rocque‚Äôs 1760 map of Dublin shows Newtown House at the bottom on the South Dublin county council historical map site. To the left of Newtown (or south) and along The Glen river would be Landscape House and Whitehall House. Above these (or west) would be Nutgrove House ‚Äì half way to Rathfarnam village.Maps of Rathfarnham ‚Äì South Dublin County History Taylor's 1816 map of the environs of Dublin gives a view of Churchtown, east of Ely's Demense. This shows the present Landscape area, Newtown House (now Villas), Whitehall and Whitebarn. Landscape Road features between the Glen River and Newtown House and this seems to swing left onto modern day Braemor Road before meeting the modern day Dodder Park Road at Ely's Arch. Nutgrove School also features, then The Ponds and further south is Barton Lane. William Duncan's maps of the county of Dublin (1821) you can see White Barn and Newtown Villas. To the left of Newtown is a large house on what probably became Braemor Park. This was possibly Fetherstonaugh House which became the Church of Ireland Theological College or more likely Ardavon House which was the original Mount Carmel hospital building. Berwick House Berwick House Berwick House is a tall building at the bend in Whitehall Road. Recently occupied by the De La Salle Brothers, it seems to be identical to a house named Waxfield where the death is recorded in 1766 of John Lamprey. In 1836 it was known as Hazelbrook, a name which was later transferred to the nearby, now defunct, Hughes Brothers milk bottling plant. The Hughes Brothers original house, built in 1898, and called Hazelbrook House, was rebuilt in the Bunratty Folk Park in 2001. From 1844 to 1899 it was known as Bachelor's Hall, after which it became the headquarters of a Charitable Institution under the name of Berwick Home. In 1944 it again became a private residence and the name was changed to Berwick House. The Ponds Loreto Terrace on the north side of Rathfarnam's Loreto Abbey was formerly known as \\"the Ponds\\", a name originating apparently from the large pond which two hundred years ago occupied the low-lying field between Loreto Terrace and Nutgrove Avenue. This area was described in Weston St. John Joyce's The Neighbourhood of Dublin in 1912 as the \\"dilapidated locality known as the Ponds\\" but it has since been largely rebuilt. An old photograph from Larry O'Connor's collection shows what it looked like at that time. The last of the old houses was demolished in the mid-1980s. It was a very early 18th century gabled residence named Grove Cottage and was probably the oldest occupied house in Dublin. This place was the scene of a skirmish at the outbreak of the rising of 1798. The insurgents of the south county assembled at the Ponds on 24 May 1798 under the leadership of David Keely, James Byrne, Edward Keogh and Ledwich. The latter two had been members of Lord Ely's yeomanry but had taken to the field with the United Irishmen. The insurgents were attacked by the local yeomanry corps but were able to defend themselves and the yeomanry was forced to retreat. A party of regular troops was then sent against them and a stiff encounter took place. A number of the insurgents were killed or wounded and some prisoners taken including Keogh and Ledwich. The survivors retreated, joining up with a party from Clondalkin, and a further engagement took place at the turnpike on the Rathcoole road where the enemy was successfully repulsed.

The site for the shopping centre was located on part of the old Lamb's Jam orchards. The centre included Ireland's first drive through restaurant when McDonald's opened a branch there. The American style experience of driving up to the window, ordering your food and driving away was a novelty at the time. There were other firsts when Nutgrove, including the country's first social welfare services office was located in a shopping mall.Nutgrove Shopping Centre at the heart of the Community - Nutgrove Shopping Centre Religion St. Nahi's church and graveyard The suburb of Churchtown is probably named after St. Nahi's Church (Church of Ireland) just off the Churchtown road. It is more easily viewed these days from the William Dargan Bridge, close to Dundrum village. St. Nahi's was rebuilt several times‚Äîin 950, 1650 and 1750. The present restoration was completed in 1910. The public housing flats in Churchtown, across from the Bottle Tower pub, are named St. Nathy's after the church.

HB Ice Cream was named after the Hughes Brothers dairy and was produced at Hazelbrook Farm, across the road from the Good Shepherd national school.HB |HB ‚Äì The History Braemor Rooms Until the late 1980s the County Club pub on the Churchtown Road Upper had a cabaret attached called the Braemor Rooms. The Dubliners had a residency every August and Guy Mitchell also played there. The owners of the County Club however decided to change the purpose to a disco/nightclub, and changed the name from 'The Braemor Rooms' to 'Faces'. This eventually led to the demise of the pub and club. It was developed in 2018 by The Press Up Group trading as a restaurant called Union Cafe. Other pubs in the area are Churchtown Stores, The Bottle Tower and The Glenside.

Cummings was born in Sidbury (near Sidmouth) in Devon. He was educated at St Paul's Cathedral Choir School and the City of London School, becoming a pupil of Dr E. J. Hopkins, J. W. Hobbs and Alberto Randegger, and was for many years a chorister in St Paul's Cathedral and the Temple Church. In 1847, as a teenager, he was one of the choristers when Felix Mendelssohn conducted the first London performance of his Elijah at Exeter Hall. Cummings also sang at numerous festivals and concerts throughout Great Britain and twice toured in the United States. His performance at the Triennial Festival of the Handel and Haydn Society in Boston was noticed as follows by the Chicago Tribune of 15 May 1871: > The tenor is also a new-comer, brought from England for this occasion, Mr. > Wm. H. Cummings. He is a slightly-built gentleman, about five feet ten > inches high, has light hair, a receding forehead, a light gentlemanly- > looking (but not distingue) mustache, and stands quietly while singing. His > voice is a tenor of good volume, and admirable quality‚Äîlike a silver > trumpet. The intonation is to be relied on, and his delivery of the tone > pleasant. The words are delivered as well as possible, both in recitative > and the airs. I doubt whether Mr. Cummings be a great singer, yet he is a > better oratorio tenor than I have heard. He is entirely innocent of tremolo > and absurd affectation. He is credited in 1855 with linking Mendelssohn's tune to Charles Wesley's words \\"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\\", which are now universally inextricably linked. At the Birmingham Festival he was the last-minute tenor soloist at the premiere of The Masque at Kenilworth (1866) by Arthur Sullivan, taking Mario's place (with only half-an-hour's notice to prepare). He was also the tenor soloist there for the premiere of the sacred cantata The Woman of Samaria by William Sterndale Bennett in 1867. Cummings founded the Purcell Society in 1876. He served as singing professor at the Royal Academy of Music for 15 years beginning in 1879. He held strong views on singing and delivered the occasional stern tirade attacking the \\"pernicious vibrato\\". As late as 1907 he gave an address on \\"The Culture of the Voice\\" in which he praised the messa di voce (which was obsolete by then) and, according to the Derby Daily Telegraph of 4 January 1907, administered: > a crushing rebuke to those who indulge in what is known as the 'tremolo'. It > is, as the Doctor said, a reprehensible habit. Apart from the fact that it > mars the beauty of many fine voices, it is, I agree, \\"a most distressing > fault to the auditors, who frequently listen in doubt as to the precise > pitch of the note the singer is endeavouring to produce\\". He later became a professor and later the principal of the Guildhall School of Music. One of his notable pupils at the school was conductor Bruce Carey. He received an honorary Doctorate in Music from Dublin University in 1900 and was made a gentleman of the Chapel Royal. In 1902, he published a book on the origins of \\"God Save the King\\".God Save the King, William H.

Min is from \\"Ïù∏ÎØº (Inmin)\\" may be translated as \\"people\\" and jung is from \\"ÎåÄÏ§ë (Daejung)\\" which translated as \\"public\\". Thus, minjung can be translated to mean \\"the masses\\" or \\"the people.\\" However, in the Korean political and cultural context, \\"public (ÎåÄÏ§ë)\\" is not an adequate translation, and \\"the people (Ïù∏ÎØº)\\" carries a Communist connotation that makes it dangerous in anti- Communist South Korea. Nonetheless, \\"the people\\" is close to what minjung seeks to convey, both sociologically and politically. For Koreans, minjung are those who are oppressed politically, exploited economically, marginalized sociologically, despised culturally, and condemned religiously. For example, the Minjung Party founded in October 2017. Thus, the notion of minjung came to identify and inform the struggle for democracy in South Korea. That is, the term minjung works as a kind of worldview that provides the categories in which social reality is organized and understood. One of the basic precepts of this worldview is that history should be understood from the point of view of the minjung, or that the minjung are the subjects (and not victims) of history. The idea of Minjung can be traced back to the late Joseon dynasty's Silhak movement through the works of Jeong Yak-yong and Yi Hwang.  Background  After the Korean War ended and South Korea ran its own government under their first president, Syngman Rhee, there were several military coups and forces involved in a reformation of the new government. Notably, there was President Park Chung-hee (1961‚Äì1979) and President Chun Doo-hwan.  Park Chung-hee (1961‚Äì1979)  While Minjung (the mass of people) was suffering and struggling from a decade of mismanagement and corruption by the Rhee presidency, a major student uprising, and some American interference, managed to oust Syngman Rhee. Afterwards, a group of military officers led by General Park Chung-hee seized power in South Korea through a coup d' etat, and declared himself President. The period from 1965 to 1971 was one of rapid economic growth and comparative political stability. To achieve economic stability, Park Chung-hee created the first Five-Year Economic Development Plan (to start in 1962), the first such overall development program ever prepared for Korea. The five-year plan gave priority to the following things: # Development of energy industries such as coal production and electric power # Expansion of agricultural production aimed at increasing farm income and correction of the structural imbalance of the national economy # Development of basic industries and the economic infrastructure # Maximum utilization of idle resources; increased employment; conservation and utilization of land # Improvement of the balance of payments through export promotion # Promotion of science and technology. Park ran for reelection in 1967, and became the president of the Third and Fourth Republic of Korea; he served for 16 years.  Minjung movement   Labor movements   YH Company protest  In August 1979, around 200 young female workers at YH Trading Company protested the company's decision to close down. YH had become a huge wig exporting company during the 1960s; however, the company's position had significantly deteriorated by the end of the 1970s. On August 7, 1979, YH Company closed down. The young women workers protested and fasted against the company's closure. The police got involved and forcefully removed the women from the building. During this violent action, one young worker was killed. Her death was significant and triggered many protest movements throughout South Korea. It may be considered one of the most important sparks of opposition towards President Park Chung-hee and the demise of his presidency.Cumings, Bruce. Korea's Place in the Sun: a Modern History. (378). New York: Norton, 2005. Print.  Gwangju Democratization Movement  The Gwangju Democratization Movement, officially renamed the Gwangju Democratization Movement in 1987, began on May 18, 1980. The citizens of Gwangju, seeking the abolition of martial law and the resignation of General Chun Doo-hwan, initiated the movement. As General Chun Doo-hwan and the military tried to maintain martial law, students and some civilians came together to demonstrate their disapproval. On May 18, 200 male students tried to enter a school that was forced into closure by officials. During the attempt, the students were heavily injured. Seeing this, civilians decided to join in but were stopped by military forces. In the end, many civilians were injured and killed, thus starting the Gwangju Movement. On May 19, as the movement grew to 5000 civilians, the military brought in an armoured motorcar and marched in with guns wielding fixed-bayonets. On May 20, 200,000 civilians marched through the military force and stopped all communications systems in the city so the military would not bring in reinforcements. Thus, Gwangju was freed. Chun Doo-hwan was the ROK army general and president of South Korea from 1980 to 1988. Chun started his coup by making himself head of the KCIA and keeping his position as head of the Defense Security of Command. Minjung gathered to the streets to protest and demonstrate their opinions about Chun's action. On May 17, 1980, Chun declared martial law to finalize his coup.Cumings, Bruce. Korea's Place in the Sun: a Modern History. (381). New York: Norton, 2005. Print. Chun fired and arrested high officials and students who were opposed to his actions. On the next day, martial law was declared and about 500 people came together to Gwangju's streets to protest and demand the repeal of the martial law. \\"One woman student was pilloried near the town square, where a paratrooper attacked her breasts with a bayonet.\\"Cumings, Bruce. Korea's Place in the Sun: a Modern History. (382). New York: Norton, 2005. Print. The soldiers shot and killed people who kept protesting and refused to go home. Gwangju Rebellion is also called Gwangju massacre because of the number of casualties inflicted on the protesters. It is unclear how many people actually died in the Gwangju Rebellion, but one source indicates the number to be between 2,300 to 4,900 deaths in May 1980.Lost Victory: An Overview of the Korean People's Struggle for Democracy in 1987. Edited by Christian Institute for the Study of Justice and Development. Seoul: Minjungsa, 1988. As a result of this chaos, Chun took it upon himself to isolate about 37,000 journalists, students, teachers, labor organizers, and civil servants in condemned and confined camps up in the mountain areas to promote \\"a time of cleansing their minds and spirits.\\" Chun was not willing to let these movements go without making it very clear that he was not going to tolerate this. He said he was setting up these boot camps for those \\"who would see the error of their ways after lots of push-ups, marathon running, small- group criticism and self-criticism, and ideological exhortation.\\"Cumings, Bruce. Korea's Place in the Sun: A Modern History. (384). New York: Norton, 2005. Print.  World-wide democratization  The 1980s marked a worldwide spark of democratization. The decline of the Soviet Union Bloc led to the breakdown of European Communist regimes in 1989. The Hungarian Solidarity Movement is one example of major revolutions during the 1980s. Much of dictatorships in Latin America also collapsed. In Philippines, the ousting of dictator Ferdinand Marcos and the subsequent \\"yellow revolution\\" led the way to democratization. These circumstances worldwide bear resemblance with the fall of the Chun regime, and the revolutions are akin to the Kwanju incident (albeit the discrepancies in human casualties).Cumings, Bruce. Korea's Place in the Sun: a Modern History. (391). New York: Norton, 2005. Print. Scholar Samuel P. Huntington referred to this period as the \\"Third Wave\\" of Democratization.See Huntington, Samuel P. The Third Wave: Democratization in the Late Twentieth Century. Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1991. Print.  Anti-American sentiments  The United States' supposed involvement in the Gwangju rebellion triggered the rapid spread of anti-Americanism sentiments. The protesters were expecting Americans to intervene for their side. Instead, the Twentieth Division of the ROK Army was sent to the area in response to the uprising. Although many Koreans, and especially those who had favored or participated in the uprising, blamed the U.S. Government for \\"releasing\\" these troops from their duties near the DMZ, the American general in charge of defending against North Korean (DPRK) attack had no idea that they were going to be moved. He was awakened by a late-night telephone call by the ROK president, informing him that the Twentieth had been removed from their positions along the DMZ‚Äîthus creating a huge gap in the defensive line in the event of large-scale infiltration from the North‚Äîand sent south to Gwangju. Nevertheless, because the U.S. Command was nominally in control of joint forces, the urban legend persists that the United States was responsible for the forcible repression of the uprising by military means. Because of this, the US took a portion of the blame: :There may not have been an alternative to turning a cold shoulder to the citizens of Gwangju... But American operational control under the United States-South Korean Combined Forces Command made U.S. responsibility inescapable, and the release of frontline troops made hash of Carter's human rights policies; the United States paid dearly for both in Korean attitudes thereafter. Initially, before Gwangju, there were negative attitudes towards the United States growing because of their support of Chun Doo-hwan. But Gwangju really catalyzed the Anti-Americanism among Koreans.  Student protests  During the presidential election in March 1960, Syngman Rhee sought out a fourth term. Considering his age of eighty-five, there was serious concern for Rhee's health and his future fulfillment of leadership within the Liberal Party. Therefore, in order to maintain power, the Liberal Party gained the desire to win at all costs. The Liberal Party did end up winning the election; Syngman Rhee and Yi Kibung (Vice President) officially won. However, the election process was corrupted. The \\"ballot boxes had been stuffed with votes for the government candidates even before the voting took place.\\" In reaction to the Liberal Party's rigged victory, the outraged citizens and students of all ages protested through street demonstrations. As a declaration indicting the government's abuse of power, on April 19, 1960, Yi Sujong expressed: \\"We want to plant the seeds of reason, truth, freedom, and the spirit of the university in the barren soil of our country.\\"[Hanguk hyondae myong nonsol chip (A supplement to Sin Tonga monthly, January 1972), p. 305] Through the protest, the students became a power of influence among the people of Korea. Although the South Korean government had claimed to be a \\"democratic\\" nation, its actions did not display the exercise of democracy. The students sparked a vital movement in South Korea. These protests are evidence of students understanding of their own power and capabilities to influence the nation. Students were fervent in their search for their own rights because they learned from history. A middle schooler by the name of Kim Chu-yol in a sense became a symbol of the sacrifice for freedom.Cumings, Bruce. Korea's Place in the Sun: a Modern History. New York: Norton, 2005:392 Print. They needed to fight for their rights just like their fathers. \\"Look at the torch of freedom that we are now raising! Listen, in these hours of darkness, as we proudly toll the bell of freedom, just as our fathers and elder brothers did under the iron yoke of the Japanese imperialist\\". This was a new type of movement to which Korea was not accustomed which would be a key instrument in allowing students to begin to voice their opinions and fight for their rights.  Normalization Treaty protest  In the 1960s, Park Chunghee saw normalization of relations with Japan as a way to gain start-up capital for industrial development. Mass demonstrations ensued against the signing of the normalization treaty. Demonstrators were met with military force in 1964, but in 1965, the treaty was ratified.  Importance of the church  Following the model of Liberation Theology established in the Latin American states, the Korean Catholic church became a haven for those opposing Park Chung-Hee's policies.Cumings, Bruce. Korea's Place in the Sun: a Modern History. (376). New York: Norton, 2005. Print This was largely due to governmental agencies', particularly the KCIA, reluctance to use military force against the church. The issues of democratization and evangelism were conflate, and some church leaders went so far as to lead protests against the authoritarian regime. The Minjung movement utilized theological arguments to support and legitimize the move towards a more democratic state.Ro, Kee Hyang(1993). The American social gospel and Koren Minjung theology look at labor: A comparison (M.A. thesis) Wilfrid Laurier University The model of Liberation Theology was viable in Korea due to the relatively high percentage of Koreans who practiced Christianity. (In 2005, approximately 1/3 of the Korean population claimed to be practicing Christians). The church provided a unique haven for anti-authoritarian dissent to develop.  Movement influences   Kim Chiha  Born in the southwestern province of Cholla, Kim Chi-ha is known for being a critic that played a large role in the Pak regime. Participation in anti-government activities, resulted in his multiple arrests which granted him the time to write a satire in experimental pan'sori form, \\"Five Bandits\\" (). This poem expresses his opposition towards the corrupt authoritarian government. \\"The poem condemned the five core power groups of the Pak regime - business tycoons, members of the National Assembly of South Korea (legislature), senior government officials, generals, and cabinet ministers - as 'five bandits' who had brazenly acquired wealth by illicit means.\\"Kim Chiha, Cry of the People and Other Poems, pp. 39-59 As a result of the poem's publication, Kim Chiha was arrested on the charge of \\"abetting the propaganda lines\\" of North Korea. In 1974, Kim Chiha was sentenced to death for violating the National Security Act and instigating rebellion. However, due to protesters like: Willy Brandt, Jean-Paul Sartre and Oe Kenzaburo, he was released in 1979.Choe, Yong-ho., Lee, Peter H., and de Barry, Wm. Theodore., eds. Sources of Korean Tradition, Chichester, NY: Columbia University Press,p401, 2000.  Kim Taejung  One of the great leaders of the cause was Kim Taejung (Kim Dae-jung), who stated that the economic development doesn't have to come with sacrifice of democracy and political freedom. Kim Taejung is often described as \\"a fierce and articulate critic, Kim castigated the government for abuses of power, corruption, and the social inequities created thereby and made an appeal for those who had not shared in the economic growth or who had been victimized by human rights violations.\\"Choe, Yong-ho., Lee, Peter H., and de Barry, Wm. Theodore., eds. Sources of Korean Tradition, Chichester, NY: Columbia University Press, 2000. Fierce critics such as Kim Taejung won wide popularity with the people of South Korea. Such men with devotion to steer the nation into a democratic nation fueled the students and white collars to achieve what we call Minjung movement today. With significant efforts from Minjung, \\"a mass movement for democracy, embracing students, workers, and many in the middle class, finally brought a democratic breakthrough in Korea.\\" Such powerful leaders like Kim Taejung pay a price for standing up for what they believe in. He was \\"subjected to frequent political persecution and even targeted for assassination attempts\\".Choe, Yong-ho., Lee, Peter H., and de Barry, Wm. Theodore., eds.

Through his devotion and criticism of an unfair government he was \\"sentenced to death on a false charge\\" which was later relieved through the United States. He still had to suffer by staying in jail for four years where he was under partial solitary confinement. Kim Taejung, undeterred, took advantage of his jail time to reflect and recharge. He worked through all the obstacles the government enforced such as \\"being exiled to the United States\\" and \\"prohibited from engaging in political activities\\".Choe, Yong-ho., Lee, Peter H., and de Barry, Wm.

Kim Taejung would not have the reputation of a fierce and one of the many great leaders if he had not kept fighting as he did. He ran for presidency three times and finally was elected in 1997 \\"marking the first time an opposition party candidate had won a presidential election in South Korea\\".Choe, Yong-ho., Lee, Peter H., and de Barry, Wm. Theodore., eds. Sources of Korean Tradition, Chichester, NY: Columbia University Press,p431, 2000.  Democracy  According to Kim Taejung democracy is essential to the people of South Korea because it gives the people some sense of ownership over their nation. It gives them freedom and motivates them to defend it. Kim Taejung admits that because of Korean's history and culture which was heavily influenced by Buddhism and Confucianism, it is difficult for South Korea to adapt to Democracy. Democracy is an idea that was invented by the Western civilization. However, this instrument can be used in South Korea if the people of South Korea want to serve under the principles of democracy which is freedom, justice, and human dignity. Kim Taejung argues that South Korea does yearn for democracy. Even when you look at the history of the Tonghak Rebellion, this resistance occurred because the peasants wanted equality and less corruption. Even before South Korea became a democratic nation, the people wanted this political government.Choe, Yong-ho., Lee, Peter H., and de Barry, Wm. Theodore., eds. Sources of Korean Tradition, Chichester, NY: Columbia University Press, 2000. pg 441 - 443 Kim Taejung believes that the most ideal economic system for a democratic nation would be a free enterprise system. However, he argues that although South Korea claims to be a democratic nation with free enterprise, this nation does not follow its principles. There is no free competition. South Korea is filled with big corporations with monopolies that are protected by the government which eliminates all competition. Also, he argues that in a free enterprise system, society and government should be able to provide and protect the working class. He even goes on to say that \\"the workers in our country are the other major role players\\". However, the authoritarian government abuses these workers and their freedom. They are treated unjustly and are not fairly rewarded. Also, there is no balance between the social classes. There is such a huge division between the higher class and the lower class which consists of farmers, workers, and small business men. In order for South Korea to break out of its shell, a balanced growth is necessary.  Presidential Inaugural Address: 1998  Meanwhile, The infamous Asian financial crisis set forth in 1997, while the election was taking place. Foreign reserves were diminishing and economic issues such as high cost and low efficiency were threatening South Korea's investors. In his presidential inaugural address in February 1998, Kim Taejung addressed the economic standpoint of the country at the time. Kim also emphasized the importance of Korea's agriculture, farming, and foreign investments. Educational reform was highly encouraged and teaching future generations of societal values. He concluded by reflecting upon the thousands of years of heritage and fight for Korea's difficulties thus far.Korea Update 9:2 (2 March 1998)  See also  * Communist Party of China * Minjung theology * Minjung art * Undongkwon  References   Further reading  * Category:Protests in Korea Category:Protests in South Korea Category:Social movements in South Korea Category:Korean words and phrases Category:South Korean democracy movements ","title":"Minjung"},{"id":"1103683","text":"Two ships of the United States Navy have borne the name Callaghan, in honor of Rear Admiral Daniel J.

The personal name Cellach means 'bright-headed'. The principal Munster sept of the name Callaghan were lords of Cine√°l Aodha in South Cork originally. This area is west of Mallow along the Blackwater river valley. The family were dispossessed of their ancestral home and by the Cromwellian Plantation and settled in East Clare. In 1994, Don Juan O'Callaghan of Tortosa was recognised by the Genealogical Office as the senior descendant in the male line of the last inaugurated O'Callaghan. The O'Callaghan land near Mallow, forfeited by Donough O'Callaghan after the Irish rebellion of 1641, came into the hands of a family called Longfield or Longueville, who built a 20-bedroom Georgian mansion there. In a twist of history, of the ancient O'Callaghan land returned to O'Callaghan hands in the twentieth century, when Longueville House was bought by a descendant of Donough O'Callaghan. The ancestral estate of the O'Callaghans, now a luxury hotel, is owned by William O'Callaghan.

Roman cursive (or Latin cursive) is a form of handwriting (or a script) used in ancient Rome and to some extent into the Middle Ages. It is customarily divided into old (or ancient) cursive and new cursive.  Old Roman cursive  Old Roman cursive, also called majuscule cursive and capitalis cursive, was the everyday form of handwriting used for writing letters, by merchants writing business accounts, by schoolchildren learning the Latin alphabet, and even by emperors issuing commands. A more formal style of writing was based on Roman square capitals, but cursive was used for quicker, informal writing. Most inscriptions at Pompeii, conserved due to being buried in a volcanic eruption in 79 CE, are written in this script.

It is most commonly attested from the 1st century BCE to the 3rd century CE, but it likely existed earlier than that. In the early 2nd century BC, the comedian Plautus, in Pseudolus, makes reference to the illegibility of cursive letters: As the above extract shows, Old Roman cursive was considered difficult to read and roundly mocked even in its heyday, and as current cursive forms of the Latin script have evolved in another direction, it is hardly legible to modern readers. The script uses many ligatures, and some letters are hard to recognize ‚Äì \\"a\\" looks like an uncial \\"a\\", but with the left stroke still straight, \\"b\\" and \\"d\\" are hard to distinguish, \\"e\\" is a full height letter (like the \\"s\\"), \\"p\\" and \\"t\\" are very similar, and \\"v\\" is written above the baseline, resembling a floating breve.Oxford, Scripts at Vindolanda page 2 page 3  New Roman cursive  New Roman cursive, also called minuscule cursive or later Roman cursive, developed from old Roman cursive. It was used from approximately the 3rd century to the 7th century, and uses letterforms that are more recognizable to modern readers: \\"a\\", \\"b\\", \\"d\\", and \\"e\\" have taken a more familiar shape, and the other letters are proportionate to each other rather than varying wildly in size and placement on the line. These letter forms would gradually evolve into various scripts with a more regional character by the 7th century, such as the Visigothic script in the Visigothic Kingdom, the Beneventan script in southern Italy, or the Merovingian script in northern France.

The Gospel of Mark specifies that two mites (Greek lepta) are together worth a quadrans, the smallest Roman coin. A lepton was the smallest and least valuable coin in circulation in Judea, worth about six minutes of an average daily wage.. New English Translation. Biblical narrative The Widow's Mite (Le denier de la veuve) - James Tissot \\"He sat down opposite the treasury and observed how the crowd put money into the treasury. Many rich people put in large sums. A poor widow also came and put in two small coins worth a few cents. Calling his disciples to himself, he said to them, 'Amen, I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all the other contributors to the treasury. For they have all contributed from their surplus wealth, but she, from her poverty, has contributed all she had, her whole livelihood.NAB, Mark 12:41-44 Commentary Baroque fresco at Ottobeuren. The traditional interpretation of this story tends to view it as contrasting the conduct of the scribes with that of the widow, and encouraging generous giving; often read with 2 Corinthians 9:7, \\"... for God loves a cheerful giver.\\" However, Addison Wright observes that there is no indication given of the widow's demeanor or frame of mind. He points out that earlier, in Mark 7:10-13, Jesus takes to task the scribes and Pharisees for a hypocrisy that would impoverish parents.Wright, Addison G. \\"The Widow's Mite: Praise or Lament\\", The Catholic Biblical Quarterly, 44, 1982, pp.256-265 > For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and 'Whoever curses > father or mother shall die.' Yet you say, 'If a person says to father or > mother, \\"Any support you might have had from me is qorban\\"' (meaning, > dedicated to God), you allow him to do nothing more for his father or > mother. You nullify the word of God in favor of your tradition that you have > handed on. And you do many such things.\\" In the passage immediately prior to Jesus taking a seat opposite the Temple treasury, he is portrayed as condemning religious leaders who feign piety, accept honor from people, and steal from widows. \\"Beware of the scribes, who like to go around in long robes and accept greetings in the marketplaces, seats of honor in synagogues, and places of honor at banquets. They devour the houses of widows and, as a pretext, recite lengthy prayers. They will receive a very severe condemnation.\\"NAB, Mark 12:38-40 The same religious leaders who would reduce widows to poverty also encourage them to make pious donations beyond their means. In Wright's opinion, rather than commending the widow's generosity, Jesus is condemning both the social system that renders her poor, and \\"... the value system that motivates her action, and he condemns the people who conditioned her to do it.\\" Elizabeth Struthers Malbon concludes that Wright's interpretation is \\"more ingenious than convincing.\\"Elizabeth Struthers Malbon, In the Company of Jesus: Characters in Mark‚Äôs Gospel (Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox Press, 2000), 176. Others see the widow's contribution as an act of radical self-abandonment in service to God, an act of strength on the part of a poor widow.Turid Karlsen Seim, The Double Message: Patterns of Gender in Luke-Acts (London: T&T; Clark, 1990), 245; James L. Resseguie, Spiritual Landscape: Images of the Spiritual Life in the Gospel of Luke (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2004), 56-57. Like Jesus who gives his whole life, the woman gives œÄŒ¨ŒΩœÑŒ± œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ Œ≤ŒØŒøŒΩ (panta ton bion), \\"all [her] life.\\"Malbon, In Company, 176; Resseguie, Spiritual Landscape, 57. Quentin Quesnell sees in this account \\"... a rebuke and rejection of the wrongdoers.\\"Quesnell, Quentin. The Mind of Mark, (AnBib 38), Rome Biblical Institute, 1969, 151 Quesnell notes that if Jesus' statement was to be seen as an endorsement of the widow's action, it bears none of the usual comments, such as \\"Go, and do likewise.\\" The account of the Widow's Mite is followed by, \\"As he was making his way out of the temple area one of his disciples said to him, \\"Look, teacher, what stones and what buildings!\\" Jesus said to him, \\"Do you see these great buildings? There will not be one stone left upon another that will not be thrown down.\\"Mark 13:1-2 Wright notes the irony that as the Temple was destroyed in the year 70, the widow's gift was not only misguided, but for nothing. The King James Bible translation In Jesus' times in Judea, the small copper coin was called a lepton; there was no coin called by the English term \\"mite\\" at that time. However, there was a mite in the time of the creation of the King James Bible, as indeed there had been at the time of earliest modern English translation of the New Testament by William Tyndale in 1525. The denomination was well known in the Southern Netherlands. Both the duke of Brabant and the count of Flanders issued them and they were sometimes imitated in the North. English poet Geoffrey Chaucer refers to the myte in his unfinished poem Anelida and Arcite (c. 1370).Geoffrey Chaucer, Anelida and Arcite (circa 1370), line 269. Originally, the Brabant mijt (maille in French) was 1/76 stuiver, the Flemish mijt 1/48 stuiver. When the two areas were united under the dukes of Burgundy and later under the Habsburgs, the rate of the mijt was set at 1/32 stuiver. More important, they were the very smallest copper coins. By 1611, they were no longer minted, but they were still in circulation.

It has no local political distinction or representation and is included as part of the two council wards which make up Formby (Harington and Ravenmeols), nor is it any longer separated in a physical sense from the town. The area is often considered to be affluent with local celebrities, footballers, politicians and businessmen making it their home (see people from Formby). Shireburn Road in Freshfield is the most expensive road in Merseyside, house prices on the exclusive road averaged ¬£1,159,831 in 2009. History The name did not exist until Formby's second railway station, Freshfield, was built in 1854. The name was chosen, as the local landowner, Thomas Fresh, owned the adjacent model farm and fields. Fresh was Inspector of Nuisances in Liverpool and was one of the celebrated trio of pioneering officers appointed in 1847 by the Borough of Liverpool's Health of the Town Committee; the others being William Henry Duncan, the UK's first medical officer of health, and James Newlands, borough engineer (though Fresh had been in a similar post for more than two years previously). A process of reverse naming seems to have occurred with some people referring to the area of Formby around this station as \\"Freshfield\\". The title originally proposed was \\"Freshton\\". Governance Until 1974, Freshfield was part of the urban district of Formby within the administrative county of Lancashire. Since 1 April 1974, it has formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton, in Merseyside. From 1950 until 2010 Freshfield like the rest of Formby formed part of the constituency of Crosby, The MP for Crosby from 1997 until 2010 was Claire Curtis-Thomas, a member of the Labour Party, prior to her election the seat was generally considered to be a safe Conservative Party stronghold with Tory MPs elected at every election barring the 1981 Crosby by-election where Shirley Williams of the Social Democratic Party was elected to represent the constituency. As a result of the Crosby constituency being abolished for the 2010 general election, Freshfield like the rest of Formby is part of the newly created Sefton Central constituency represented by Bill Esterson, a member of the Labour Party. For elections to Sefton Council, Freshfield is divided between two electoral wards with three councillors each: Harington ward, whose councillors are Gillian Cuthbertson, Alf Doran, and Denise Dutton, all members of the Conservative Party, and Ravenmeols ward, whose councillors are Barry Griffiths, Anne Ibbs, David Mcivor, again all Conservative Party members. Community The area contains The Freshfield Hotel and The Grapes pubs, Victoria Hall and Victoria Road (a long avenue on which several famous English sportsmen have lived). RAF Woodvale is nearby. Transport Freshfield railway station is situated on the Liverpool to Southport branch of Merseyrail's Northern Line.

The Hollyford Track is a tramping track in New Zealand. Located at the northern edge of Fiordland, in the southwestern South Island, it is unusual among Fiordland's major tracks in that it is largely flat and accessible year-round. It follows the Hollyford River which in turn follows the course of the Hollyford Valley. History The MƒÅori people were the first to settle the area around Martins Bay, though by the time of the arrival of Europeans in the mid-19th century, only a handful remained in the area. One of these was Tutoko, for whom Mount Tutoko, which rises 2700m above the Hollyford valley, was subsequently named. he first Europeans to reach the bay via an inland route was Patrick Caples from Hollyford County Tipperary Ireland in 1863, although early runholders David McKellar and George Gunn had mapped some of the valley two years previously. Also in 1863, a small ship captained by a Captain Alabaster crossed the sandbar at Martins Bay to reach Lake McKerrow. In the early days of European settlement, there was much enthusiasm for a commercial port at Martins Bay, led by the Otago Provincial Council. A settlement - Jamestown - was surveyed and several houses built, but the lack of road links to the rest of the province and the dangerous sandbar led to the gradual waning of the settlement, which was practically deserted by 1879, only some eleven years after its founding. Only one family, the McKenzies, remained close to Martins Bay. They sold their property to Davy Gunn in 1926. Gunn continued to farm the area, and also mapped the area and was a pioneer in the tramping tourism industry, taking parties of walkers along the valleys of the Hollyford, Pyke and Cascade Rivers. After his death in 1955, his son Murray continued to guide trampers in the area, and started \\"Gunn's Camp\\", a rest-stop for trampers with store and small museum, which still stands near the southern end of the track, around 10 km from the Milford Sound-Te Anau highway. The gravel road was being constructed up until 1941 when the workers were taken off the job for the war effort and was worked on both ends. After World War II the idea of a road linking Haast to Hollyford was reignited to allow access and used prison and unemployed labor to progress the work. In 1960, the valley became part of Fiordland National Park and Davy Gunn's original tracks have since been upgraded and tramping huts established. The track The track is 56 kilometres in length. It runs in a roughly south-north direction, its southern end being accessible by road 15 kilometres to the east of the Homer Tunnel, and its northern end being at the Tasman Sea coast at Martins Bay, north of Milford Sound. For most of its path, the track follows the course of the Hollyford River / Hollyford Valley. Features of the track are the two lakes, Lake Alabaster (or Waiwahuika) and Lake McKerrow (or Whakatipu Waitai), the latter being a fiord now cut off from the sea by sediment. The track runs through lowland forest, with views of surrounding mountains. Wildlife visible from the track include seals, penguins, and herons. The track is part of the Department of Conservation network with several bunk huts scattered along its length. It also has a guided operation operated by Ngai Tahu Tourism (owned by the main South Island Maori tribal group) with their own Lodges at Pyke and Martins Bay. The guided option combines hiking, jetboating and helicopter flights in a three-day journey from the mountains to the sea. Freedom walkers can make the walk more accessible by flying into or out of Martins Bay. Walkers are advised to be aware that the 2-3 day section from the Pyke River to Martins Bay alongside Lake McKerrow is well known as the 'Demon Trail'. This due to its uneven nature with multiple side streams. The Demon trail is aptly named and can be slippery in the wet. Road proposals There have been a number of proposals for a road in the vicinity of the track to link Haast with the Milford Sound road, proposed as early as the 1870s. In 2001 a widely distributed newspaper advertising supplement \\"The South Island Loop\\" promoted the Hollyford road as well as a road in the vicinity of the Heaphy Track. Mayors in the South Island and other supporters pushed for having the road built. Forest and Bird, New Zealand's largest conservation organisation, called it the \\"biological equivalent of smashing the Mona Lisa\\". In January 2010, the National-led government confirmed that it was considering a Hollyford road proposal. The Westland District Council and the owner of a hotel chain are backing plans for the road. The plans were however put on hold in March 2010, when government decided that the investment was a low priority.

The 98th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff between the American League (AL) champion Anaheim Angels and the National League (NL) champion San Francisco Giants; the Angels defeated the Giants, four games to three, to win their first, and, to date, only World Series championship. The series was played from October 19‚Äì27, 2002, at Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco and Edison International Field of Anaheim in Anaheim. This was the first World Series since the 1995 inception of the wild card in MLB (and the last until ) in which both wild card teams would vie for the title. The Angels finished the regular season in second place in the AL West division. They defeated the four-time defending AL champion New York Yankees, three games to one, in the best-of-five AL Division Series, and in doing so won their first postseason series in franchise history. They then defeated the Minnesota Twins, four games to one, in the best-of-seven AL Championship Series to advance to the World Series, another first in franchise history. The Giants finished the regular season in second place in the NL West division. They defeated the Atlanta Braves in the NL Division Series and the St. Louis Cardinals in the NL Championship Series to advance to the World Series, giving the team their 20th NL pennant and 17th appearance in the Fall Classic but only their third since moving from New York City to San Francisco in 1958. The series was the fourth World Series played between two teams from California, after , , and . Barry Bonds, Reggie Sanders, and J. T. Snow each hit home runs to help propel the Giants to win Game one. Game two was a high- scoring affair that the Angels ultimately won on Tim Salmon's eighth-inning home run. The Angels routed the Giants in Game three, but lost Game four on a tie-breaking eighth-inning single by the Giants' David Bell. The Giants brought the Angels to the brink of elimination by winning Game five in a blowout. The Giants were eight outs away from winning the Series in Game six, but late game home runs by Scott Spiezio and Darin Erstad, as well as a two- RBI double by Troy Glaus helped the Angels overcome a five-run, seventh-inning deficit to win. A three-run double by Garret Anderson was the difference in the Angels' Game seven win to clinch the series. Glaus was named the World Series Most Valuable Player. The two teams set a record for combined most home runs in a World Series (21), which stood until 2017. Background This was the fourth World Series played between two teams from California and the last World Series as of today involving two teams from the same state. The 1974 World Series saw the Oakland Athletics defeat the Los Angeles Dodgers; the series saw the Dodgers getting revenge by defeating the Athletics. In the San Francisco Giants were defeated by the Oakland Athletics. The managers of the two clubs, Mike Scioscia of the Angels and Dusty Baker of the Giants, were teammates on the Dodgers from 1980‚Äì1983, and won a World Series in . This was the first World Series to feature opposing managers who had been teammates on a World Championship team as players. San Francisco Giants Since their 1958 move from New York City to San Francisco, the Giants franchise and its fans had a long history of futility, frustration, and disappointment. The Giants had won their last World Series crown before the move, in . Since the move, the Giants made it to the Series twice but lost both times. These included a dramatic, down-to-the-wire loss to the New York Yankees in the seven-game classic 1962 World Series, and a four-game sweep by their crosstown rival Oakland Athletics in the 1989 World Series that was marred by the Loma Prieta earthquake. Their most recent postseason appearance was in 2000, when they were defeated by the New York Mets in the NLDS. In addition, the Giants narrowly missed winning the N.L. pennant in 1959, 1964, 1965 and 1966. They finished in second place five years in a row from 1965‚Äì1969 and lost the 1971 NLCS to the Pittsburgh Pirates. 2002 was Dusty Baker's tenth season as manager of the Giants. It was also their third season playing at Pacific Bell Park (now Oracle Park). The Giants finished the previous season with a record of 90‚Äì72, finishing in second place in the NL West, two games behind the Arizona Diamondbacks. They also finished in second place in the NL wild card standings, three games behind the St. Louis Cardinals. Notable player departures included 2001 midseason acquisition Andr√©s Galarraga, who departed as a free agent, and Shawn Estes, who was traded to the New York Mets in exchange for Tsuyoshi Shinjo and Desi Relaford. Notable player acquisitions included Reggie Sanders, a free agent, and David Bell, who the Giants received from the Seattle Mariners in exchange for Desi Relaford and cash. During the season the Giants also acquired Kenny Lofton from the Chicago White Sox in exchange for two minor leaguers. Sanders, Bell, Shinjo, and Lofton helped bolster a Giants offense led by longtime Giants Barry Bonds, J. T. Snow, Rich Aurilia, and Jeff Kent, as well as relative newcomer Benito Santiago. The starting pitching rotation was led by Kirk Rueter and Jason Schmidt, with a bullpen led by Tim Worrell and closer Robb Nen. During the 2002 regular season, the Giants led the NL West standings for most of April and a few days in May; however, by the end of May they had fallen to third place behind the Los Angeles Dodgers and Arizona Diamondbacks. They spent most of the next three months in third place, but on September 9 they took second place for good, while the Dodgers either tied them or fell to third place for the rest of the season. The Giants finished the regular season with a record of 95‚Äì66, games behind the NL West champion Diamondbacks. They won the NL wild card, games ahead of the runner-up Dodgers. Dusty Baker became the first black manager to participate in a World Series since Cito Gaston for Toronto in and . This was Giants' outfielder Reggie Sanders' second consecutive World Series appearance with different teams‚Äîin he got there with the Arizona Diamondbacks. This was the first time this happened since Don Baylor did it in three consecutive years with the Boston Red Sox in , the Minnesota Twins in , and with the Oakland Athletics in . Anaheim Angels Like the Giants, the Angels and their fans carried a long history of futility and disappointment. Enfranchised in 1961, the Angels had never before played in the World Series. They came close several times, including ALCS losses in 1979 to the Baltimore Orioles, 1982 to the Milwaukee Brewers, and in 1986 to the Boston Red Sox. After dropping the 1979 ALCS in four games, the Angels brought their opponents to the brink of elimination in each of those last two series, before losing the next three consecutive games and the series. The 1986 ALCS, in which the Angels were as close as 1 strike away from the World Series, was the Angels' latest postseason appearance, though they came close in 1995 when they lost a one-game tie-breaker for the AL West championship to the Seattle Mariners after blowing a 14-game lead in the standings. 2002 was the Angels' third season under manager Mike Scioscia. The Angels finished the previous injury marred season with a record of 75‚Äì87, finishing in third place in the AL West. The most notable personnel change during the offseason was the trade of first baseman Mo Vaughn to the New York Mets in exchange for pitcher Kevin Appier. Offensively, the team was led by longtime Angels Garret Anderson, Darin Erstad, Troy Glaus and Tim Salmon, as well as relative newcomers Adam Kennedy and David Eckstein. The starting pitching rotation was led by Ram√≥n Ortiz and Jarrod Washburn, as well as mid-season call-up John Lackey, while the bullpen was led by setup man Brendan Donnelly and closer Troy Percival. The bullpen was bolstered in late September by the addition of 20-year-old reliever prospect Francisco Rodriguez. The Angels spent much of the season trailing the first-place Seattle Mariners and on occasion the Oakland Athletics in the AL West standings. However, the A's and Angels both mounted late-season comebacks that, coupled with a poor August record for the Mariners, knocked the Mariners down to third place. The A's won 20 straight games at one point, and the Angels finished the season in second place with a 99‚Äì63 record, four games behind the A's, but won the AL wild card, six games ahead of the Boston Red Sox and Seattle Mariners. Their 99 wins was third best in the A.L. and fourth best in baseball. Summary Matchups Game 1 San Francisco won 4‚Äì3 at Edison International Field of Anaheim (now Angel Stadium of Anaheim) to take a 1‚Äì0 series lead. As he strode into the batter's box to open the second inning, Barry Bonds was finally making his first (and only) World Series appearance; in his first at bat on a 2‚Äì1 pitch from Angels starter Jarrod Washburn, Bonds smoked a line drive for a home run to right field, which gave the Giants a quick 1‚Äì0 lead. Reggie Sanders then followed that up with an opposite-field homer later in the inning. With the Giants leading 2‚Äì1 in the fifth, Giants batter J. T. Snow (who formerly played for the Angels) hit a two-run shot over the center field wall after Sanders singled to give San Francisco a three-run advantage. Eventual Series MVP Troy Glaus hit two home runs for the Angels, one in the second and another in the sixth off Giants starter Jason Schmidt. Adam Kennedy drove in a run with a base hit in the sixth as well to trim the deficit to 4‚Äì3. However, Schmidt was effective otherwise, along with reliever F√©lix Rodr√≠guez and closer Robb Nen, as they held off the Halos the rest of the way. Game 2 Game 2 was a slugfest that saw the lead fluctuate wildly between the two teams. The Angels plated five runs in the first inning by batting around against Giants starting pitcher Russ Ortiz. David Eckstein singled to lead off and scored on Darin Erstad's double. After Tim Salmon singled, Garret Anderson's RBI single made it 2‚Äì0 Angels. After Troy Glaus flew out, consecutive RBI singles by Brad Fullmer and Scott Spiezio made it 4‚Äì0 Angels. Fullmer stole home plate for the Angels' fifth run of the inning. In the second inning, however, Kevin Appier surrendered most of the lead by allowing a three-run homer to Sanders followed by a shot to David Bell. The Angels answered with a two-run home run from veteran Tim Salmon to make it 7‚Äì4 in the Angels' favor. Ortiz would not finish the inning and was relieved by Chad Zerbe, who provided four innings of relief. Appier did not last much longer than Ortiz, as he was pulled in the third and replaced by John Lackey, the Angels scheduled starter for Game 4, after surrendering a lead-off home run to Jeff Kent. Lackey temporarily quieted the Giants' offense but ran into trouble in the fifth inning, allowing a double and intentional walk. Ben Weber relieved him but allowed a single to Benito Santiago to load the bases, then a two-run single to J. T. Snow that tied the game. After Reggie Sanders struck out, consecutive RBI singles by David Bell and Shawon Dunston gave the Giants a 9‚Äì7 lead. The Angels turned to 20-year-old rookie reliever Francisco Rodriguez, who answered by shutting down the Giants offense for the next three innings. He retired nine batters in a row on 25 pitches (22 were strikes). Meanwhile, the Angels chipped away at their deficit. In the bottom of the fifth, Glaus and Fullmer hit back-to-back leadoff singles before the former scored on Spezio's sacrifice fly. Next inning, Erstad doubled with two outs. Zerbe was relieved by Jay Witasick, who walked Tim Salmon. Aaron Fultz relieved Witasick and allowed an RBI single to Anderson to tie the game, but Salmon was thrown out at third to end the inning. Salmon drilled a two-run home run with two outs in the eighth inning off of F√©lix Rodr√≠guez, giving Anaheim an 11‚Äì9 lead. Closer Troy Percival retired the first two batters in the ninth, and, after allowing a mammoth shot from Bonds that landed halfway up the right field bleachers, retired Benito Santiago to even the series. Bonds became the first player since Ted Simmons in the 1982 World Series to hit a home run in his first two World Series games, joining Simmons, Dusty Rhodes in the 1954 World Series and Jimmie Foxx in the 1929 World Series. The feat would later be duplicated by Craig Monroe of the Tigers in the 2006 World Series. Giants pitchers failed to strike out a batter for the entire game, the first time this had happened in the World Series since Game 7 of the 1960 World Series; as of 2016 it remains the last time a team has not recorded a strikeout in a World Series game. The Angels won despite giving up four home runs to the Giants, compared to one by the Angels. Game 3 Anaheim won 10‚Äì4 in the first World Series game at Pacific Bell Park (now Oracle Park). The Angels batted around twice without a home run in either of their four-run innings. They became the first team in World Series history to bat around in consecutive innings. Barry Bonds hit another home run, becoming the first player to homer in his first three World Series games. The Giants struck first on Benito Santiago's based-loaded groundout in the first off of Ram√≥n Ortiz, but Giants starter Liv√°n Hern√°ndez walked David Eckstein to lead off the third and allowed a subsequent double to Darin Erstad. An error on Tim Salmon's groundball allowed Eckstein to score. After Garret Anderson flew out, Troy Glaus hit an RBI single and Scott Spiezio followed with a two-run triple. Next inning, Anderson's RBI groundout with runners on second and third chased Hernandez. Jay Witasick entered in relief and walked Glaus before allowing RBI singles to Spiezio, Adam Kennedy and Bengie Molina, which increased Anaheim's lead to 8‚Äì1. Rich Aurilia hit a one- out home run in the fifth for the Giants. After Jeff Kent singled, Bonds's home run made it 8‚Äì4, but the Giants did not score after that. The Angels added to their lead on Eckstein's RBI single in the sixth off of Aaron Fultz and Erstad's bases-loaded fielder's choice in the eighth off of Scott Eyre. Giants public address announcer Renel Brooks-Moon is recognized by the Baseball Hall of Fame as the first female announcer of a championship game in any professional sport for her role in the 2002 World Series. Her scorecard from Game 3 is on display in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York. Until 2014, this game was the Giants' only World Series loss at home since Pacific Bell Park opened in 2000. They proceeded to win the final two games in this series, then won four straight home games in their next two World Series appearances in 2010 and 2012 until finally losing at home in Game 3 in 2014. Game 4 The Angels struck first in the second on David Eckstein's bases-loaded sacrifice fly, then made it 3‚Äì0 next inning on Troy Glaus's two-run home run off of starter Kirk Rueter. In the bottom of the fifth, however, Angels starter John Lackey allowed three consecutive leadoff singles, the last of which by Rich Aurilia scoring Rueter. Jeff Kent's sacrifice fly cut the Giants' lead to 3‚Äì2 and NLCS MVP Benito Santiago tied the game with a single in after the Angels walked Barry Bonds with a runner on second and two outs. David Bell put the Giants ahead with an RBI single in the bottom of the eighth off of Francisco Rodriguez. The run was unearned, due to Anaheim catcher Bengie Molina's passed ball during the previous at-bat, allowing J. T. Snow to move to second. Tim Worrell got the win for the Giants. San Francisco scored a 4‚Äì3 victory to tie the series and ensured a return trip to Anaheim. Game 5 San Francisco took a 16‚Äì4 blowout win in a game in which the Angels never led. The most well-known moment in this game occurred in the bottom of the seventh when Giants first baseman J. T. Snow scored off a Kenny Lofton triple. Three-year-old batboy Darren Baker, son of Giants manager Dusty Baker, ran to home plate to collect Lofton's bat before the play was completed and was quickly lifted by the jacket by Snow with one hand as he crossed the plate, with David Bell close on his heels. Had Snow not acted quickly, Darren could have been seriously injured in a play at home plate. Giants' second-baseman Jeff Kent hit two home runs to break out of a slump (hitting his first home run since Game 2), driving in four runs. In the bottom of the first, Barry Bonds's double off of Jarrod Washburn with runners on first and second gave the Giants an early lead. Benito Santiago's sacrifice fly, followed by three consecutive walks made it 3‚Äì0 Giants. Next inning, Benito's bases-loaded single scored two and Reggie Sanders's sacrifice fly scored another. Orlando Palmeiro doubled to lead off the top of the fifth, moved to third on David Eckstein's single and scored on Darin Erstad's sacrifice fly. After Tim Salmon singled, a wild pitch by starter Jason Schmidt allowed Eckstein to score. After Garret Anderson struck out, Troy Glaus's RBI double cut the Giants' lead to 6‚Äì3. The Angels cut it to 6‚Äì4 next inning off of Chad Zerbe on Eckstein's groundout with runners on second and third, but did not score again. Kent's two-run home run in the bottom half off of Ben Weber widened the Giants' lead to 8‚Äì4. Next inning, Kenny Lofton's two-run triple made it 10‚Äì4 Giants. Scot Shields relieved Weber and after Aurilia struck out, Kent's second home run of the game made it 12‚Äì4 Giants. Next inning, Shields allowed consecutive one-out singles to J. T. Snow and David Bell, then an error on Tsuyoshi Shinjo's ground ball made it 13‚Äì4 Giants. After Lofton grounded out, Aurilia capped the scoring with a three-run home run. Scott Eyre retired the Angels in order in the ninth as the Giants were one win away from a World Series title. Chad Zerbe earned the win for the Giants. 2002's game 5 shares one peculiar record with 1960's game 2. The two games share the World Series record for most runs scored by a game winning team, 16, who ultimately went on to lose the series. Game 6 The turning point in the Series came in Game 6. Following the top of the seventh inning, the Giants led 5-0 but then proceeded to surrender three runs in the bottom of the inning and another three runs in the bottom of the eighth inning and lost the game 6‚Äì5. The game was scoreless through the first four innings. In the top of the fifth, San Francisco took the lead. David Bell singled with one out, then Shawon Dunston's home run made it 2‚Äì0 Giants. After Kenny Lofton doubled, Francisco Rodr√≠guez relieved Kevin Appier. Lofton stole third and scored on a wild pitch. In the top of the sixth, Barry Bonds homered off Rodriguez to make it 4‚Äì0, and the Giants added another run in the top of the seventh when Lofton singled and stole second and was driven in by a single by Jeff Kent. Leading 5‚Äì0 with one out in the bottom of the seventh inning, eight outs away from the Giants' first World Series title since moving to San Francisco in 1958, Giants manager Dusty Baker pulled starting pitcher Russ Ortiz, who had shut out the Angels during the game, for setup man F√©lix Rodr√≠guez after Ortiz gave up consecutive singles to third baseman Troy Glaus and designated hitter Brad Fullmer. In a widely publicized move, Baker gave Ortiz the game ball as he sent him back to the dugout. During the pitching change the Rally Monkey came on the JumboTron, sending 45,037 Angels fans into a frenzy. Angels first baseman Scott Spiezio then fouled off pitch after pitch before finally hitting a three-run home run that barely cleared the wall in right field. Ortiz would be charged with two runs and a no-decision, his second of the series. The rally continued in the eighth inning, as Angels center fielder Darin Erstad hit a leadoff line-drive home run, followed by consecutive singles by Tim Salmon and Garret Anderson. When Bonds misplayed Anderson's shallow left field bloop single, Chone Figgins (who had pinch-run for Salmon) and Anderson took third and second base, respectively. With no outs, two runners in scoring position and now only a 5‚Äì4 lead, Baker brought in closer Robb Nen to pitch to Glaus, hoping that Nen could induce a strikeout that might yet preserve the Giants' slim lead. However, Glaus slugged a double to the left-center field gap over Bonds' head to drive in the tying and go- ahead runs and giving Nen a blown save. Nen managed to keep Glaus from scoring, and that was the final score. In the ninth inning, Angels closer Troy Percival struck out Tom Goodwin, induced a foul popout from Lofton, and struck out Rich Aurilia to preserve the 6‚Äì5 victory in front of the jubilant home crowd. The comeback from a five-run deficit was the largest in World Series history for an elimination game. Game 7 Game 7 proved to be somewhat anticlimactic after the drama of Game 6. The Giants scored the first run in the top of the second inning when Reggie Sanders hit a sacrifice fly to score Benito Santiago from third, but the Angels responded with a run-scoring double from catcher Bengie Molina that scored Scott Spiezio from first after he had walked with two outs. A three-run double to right field from left fielder Garret Anderson pushed the lead to a 4‚Äì1 lead and gave San Francisco starter Liv√°n Hern√°ndez the loss. Hern√°ndez was yanked following Anderson's double, and Chad Zerbe got out of the nightmarish inning. Zerbe, Kirk Rueter, and Tim Worrell held the Angels scoreless, but it was not enough. Rookie starting pitcher John Lackey maintained that lead through five innings, and turned the game over to the strong Angels bullpen. In the ninth inning, closer Troy Percival provided some tense moments as he opened the inning by putting two Giants players on base, with only one out. But Tsuyoshi Shinjo‚Äîthe first Japanese-born player in a World Series game‚Äîstruck out swinging, and Kenny Lofton, also representing the tying run, flied out to Darin Erstad in right- center field to end the Series. The Angels won Game 7, 4‚Äì1, to claim their franchise's first and only World Series championship to date. John Lackey became the first rookie pitcher to win a World Series Game 7 since 1909. In Game 7, three rookie pitchers (John Lackey, Brendan Donnelly, and Francisco Rodr√≠guez) combined to throw eight innings while only giving up one run combined. The Angels won the World Series despite scoring fewer runs (41) than the Giants (44). The Angels lost the first game in all three rounds of the playoffs (Division Series, League Championship Series, and World Series), yet rebounded to win each time. They were the first, and to date only, team to do this since the new postseason format was created in 1994. Until 2017, this was the last time a franchise would win its first World Series title. It was also the second year in a row that the feat had been accomplished; in 2001, the Diamondbacks beat the Yankees in just their fourth year of existence. Also in those two years, both teams won the World Series in just their first appearance, which did not happen again until 2019, when the Washington Nationals would accomplish the feat. The Angels became the first American League (AL) champion team not representing the AL East Division to win the World Series since the Minnesota Twins in 1991. The Angels were also the first American League Wild Card winner to win the World Series. With this win the Angels got rid of the supposed curse on their head stemming from Anaheim Stadium being built on an ancient Indian burial ground.http://sabr.org/research/witches-hexes-and-plain-bad-luck-reputed- curse-los-angeles-angels-anaheim Composite box 2002 World Series (4‚Äì3): Anaheim Angels (A.L.) over San Francisco Giants (N.L.) Impact and aftermath Victorious Angels players being honored at the White House Rose Garden by President George W. Bush. The Angels and the Giants combined to log 85 runs over the course of the series, the largest combined run total for both teams in World Series history. This remains the most recent championship series played entirely within one state. Angels The 2002 World Series win began the most successful era in Angels franchise history, making six postseason appearances from 2002‚Äì2009. Before 2002 they had been to the postseason three times in franchise history (1979, 1982, and 1986). They advanced to the ALCS in 2005 and 2009, but lost those series respectively to the Chicago White Sox and New York Yankees, each while en route to their own World Series championship. The Angels were the most recent team to win the championship in its first World Series appearance until the Washington Nationals accomplished the feat in ; between 2002 and 2019, all first-time World Series participants would lose‚Äîthe Houston Astros in , Colorado Rockies in , Tampa Bay Rays in , and Texas Rangers in . Giants The Giants would return to the postseason the following season, but lost the NLDS to the Florida Marlins while they were en route to a World Series championship. After a second-place finish in 2004, the Giants had losing seasons for the next four years. After losing 90 games in 2008, the Giants won 88 games for a surprising third-place finish in 2009. Building on their 2009 season, the Giants made the playoffs again in 2010, defeating the Braves in the NLDS, and the Phillies in the NLCS en route to the World Series, where they defeated the Rangers in five games, earning the long-awaited championship they could not reach in 2002. In 2012, after fighting back from down two games to none in the NLDS against the Cincinnati Reds and down three games to one against the defending World Series Champions, the St. Louis Cardinals in the NLCS, they swept the Detroit Tigers for their second World Series Championship in three years. In 2014, the Giants added their third title in five seasons by defeating the Kansas City Royals in seven games. This was the last World Series where home-field advantage alternated between the National and American Leagues each year. As a result of the tie in the 2002 All-Star Game, beginning in 2003 home-field advantage in the World Series was controversially granted to the league that won the All- Star Game. That practice ended after the 2016 Series; beginning in 2017, the team with the best regular season record will enjoy home field advantage, the same format used in the National Basketball Association's Finals and National Hockey League's Stanley Cup Finals.

The program focuses on critiquing the Australian media together with interconnections including political. It played a key role in revealing the unethical behaviour of radio talkback hosts, which became known as the \\"cash for comment affair\\" and was the subject of an investigation by the Australian Broadcasting Authority. Format Former host Jonathan Holmes sitting at the desk Media Watch is a 15-minute program which identifies, investigates and examines instances of what the program determines to be failings in news coverage by Australian media outlets. The series features a single host speaking directly to camera, detailing a mix of amusing or embarrassing editing gaffes (such as miscaptioned photographs or spelling errors) as well as more serious criticism including media bias and breaches of journalistic ethics and standards. Over the years, the emphasis has shifted towards the latter. Although most episodes of Media Watch focus on any recent incidents of media misconduct, episodes sometimes focus on a single issue of particular importance (for instance, media coverage of a recent election). Presenters Stuart Littlemore was the inaugural host of Media Watch and remains the longest-running host to date. Following his nine-year tenure, various other journalists have hosted the program. Paul Barry, who previously hosted the program in 2000 and for a brief period in 2010, resumed hosting duties in 2013. * Stuart Littlemore (1989‚Äì97) * Richard Ackland (1998‚Äì99) * David Marr (2002‚Äì04) * Liz Jackson (2005) * Monica Attard (2006‚Äì07) * Jonathan Holmes (2008‚Äì13) * Paul Barry (2000, 2010, 2013‚Äì) Notable pieces \\"Cash for comment\\" In 1999, the program revealed that influential talkback radio hosts Alan Jones and John Laws had been paid to provide favourable on-air comment about companies such as Qantas, Optus, Foxtel and Mirvac, without disclosing these arrangements to listeners. It also persistently criticised the then Australian Broadcasting Authority (superseded by the Australian Communications and Media Authority in 2005) as impotent or unwilling to regulate broadcast media, and to properly scrutinise figures such as Jones and Laws. The revelations won Media Watch staffers Richard Ackland, Deborah Richards and Anne Connolly two Walkley Awards: the Gold Walkley, and the Walkley for TV Current Affairs Reporting (Less Than 10 Minutes). In 2004, Media Watch played a major part in forcing the resignation of ABA head David Flint, after it was discovered that Flint had sent Jones admiring and effusive letters at a time when the ABA was investigating Jones concerning further cash for comment allegations. The reports won Media Watch another Walkley, TV Current Affairs Reporting (Less Than 20 Minutes) to staffers David Marr, Peter McEvoy and Sally Virgoe. 60 Minutes 1995 massacre at Srebrenica story Australian 60 Minutes reporter Richard Carleton sued Media Watch over allegations of plagiarism. The judge found that the allegations were untrue and declined to award any damages. The ABC World Today reported on 18 December 2002: \\"The veteran reporter was horrified to see Media Watch accuse him of plagiarising a BBC documentary on the 1995 massacre at Srebrenica for his Channel Nine program. But today a judge ruled that even though the program did defame Mr Richard Carleton and two colleagues, it was fair comment and no damages were awarded.\\"Michael Vincent (18 December 2002). Carleton, Media Watch divided over defamation ruling. The World Today. Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Retrieved on 19 October 2020.  \\"The Truth Behind Tuam\\"  In June 2014, the program examined false claims of a mass grave being discovered in County Galway, on the West of Ireland, found on the site of an old mother and baby home run by nuns in the town of Tuam. The story was repeated by global broadcasters including the ABC. In his editorial about the incident, Barry concluded \\"So why did the media fall for it? ... [I]t matched our prejudices. And it made such great headlines, it was really too good to check. And who cared if it suggested those nuns were mass murderers?\\"The truth behind Tuam; Media Watch; www.abc.net.au; 19 October 2020 Cancellation and return This ability to generate controversy led to the temporary cancellation of the show. In 2000, host Paul Barry was controversially sacked and, in 2001, the program itself was axed by Jonathan Shier, the head of the ABC. However, in early 2002, after Shier was himself sacked in similarly controversial circumstances, the show returned with David Marr as the new host. While Media Watch was off air, former host, Stuart Littlemore, presented a replacement program, Littlemore, that also examined issues about the media, running for 13 episodes between March and May 2001. Media Bites Starting in 2017 in conjunction with the Media Watch series' return, a weekly online spin-off series, Media Bites, was created. A new episode is uploaded every Thursday to their website, social media outlet, iView and ABC's official YouTube channel, each episode running for about two minutes. Unlike the main show, Media Bites is more casual in presentation, Paul Barry sits in the production office (not a studio) talking to the camera in a position similar to many online vloggers. Barry is often in more casual clothing using the light source of the office instead of professional lighting. Each episode has the same format, two mini- stories and the week's alternative fact. The mini-stories are in essence a shorter version of the main series in-depth format, introducing the story and explaining the problem. For example, a story where Woman's Day ran an article about Paul Hogan's ex-wife (Noelene Hogan) in which, using a photo of Noelene with her son, the article incorrectly portrays the son as her deceased partner Reg, stating the couple were a \\"cute pair\\", only to be corrected by a tweet from a family member. The Alternative Fact of the Week points out an incorrect or baffling tidbit, often involving US President Donald Trump. Episodes conclude with a \\"teaser\\" for the following episode of the main show. The episodes contain the same sarcasm and quips from Barry as does the main show. Episodes are edited in a similar fashion to the main show, with relevant corresponding images, text and effects relating to his narration. The stand- out difference in editing is that subtitles are permanently part of the video along the bottom of the screen, instead of being an optional closed caption. Reception The show's presenters have taken some pride in the vehemence of the criticism it attracts; at one point, the opening credits were made up of a montage of such criticisms, prominently featuring a description of original presenter Stuart Littlemore as a 'pompous git'. In 2002, the then-editor of The Daily Telegraph, Campbell Reid, sent host David Marr a dead fish; a replica of it is now awarded as the Campbell Reid Perpetual Trophy for the Brazen Recycling of Other People's Work. Known as \\"The Barra\\" and bearing the motto Carpe Verbatim, it is awarded annually for bad journalism and particularly plagiarism (a practice for which Reid was frequently criticised). Media Watch scrutinises all media outlets, and has criticised its own network, the ABC. When David Marr was host from 2002 to 2004, the show often criticised Marr's employer John Fairfax Holdings. Robert Manne, writing in The Age in 2007, commented that: > Media Watch was once, unashamedly, a program of the left... was sometimes > unbalanced and unfair, usually intelligent and witty, always fearless and > tough. No program more effectively tracked the steady drift of the political > culture to the right. No program more effectively scrutinised the politics > and practices of the contemporary commercial mainstream media‚Äîthe rise of > commentariat Islamophobia, the scandal of \\"cash for comment\\". The fact that > it was not \\"impartial\\" was the key to its unpopularity in certain quarters, > but also to its importance and success. Media analysis programs and segments on Sky News Australia also describe the program as having consistent left wing bias, but see this as a weakness and not a strength of the program. Following the 2019 Election, Sky News Australia media analyst Chris Kenny, wrote for The Australian that the program's reliance on Labor Party or Trade Union aligned journalists to criticise News Ltd, coupled with a failure to disclose those associations, undermines the credibility of host Paul Barry's editorials against News Ltd.Partisan push on ABC‚Äôs Media Watch; www.theaustralian.com.au; 2 Sept. 2019 The Australian, which is regularly criticised by Media Watch, has been a long-term counter- critic of the show. In August 2007 it editorialised that Media Watch \\"lacks journalistic integrity and conducts its affairs along the lines of an insiders' club that pushes its ideological prejudice at taxpayers' expense\\". In June 2007, an episode of Media Watch entitled \\"Have Your Spray\\" strongly criticised The Daily Telegraph, among others, for failing to censor racist comments on their website forums posted over an extended period, but then allowed strongly anti-Semitic comments to remain on its own web forum for a \\"few minutes\\" until removed. The ABC later launched an internal inquiry into Media Watch reliance on IslamicSydney, \\"an Islamic website that peddle[s] anti-Semitic and jihadi messages\\", for this story.

It can be thought of as the Fourier transform to the n-th power, where n need not be an integer -- thus, it can transform a function to any intermediate domain between time and frequency. Its applications range from filter design and signal analysis to phase retrieval and pattern recognition. The FRFT can be used to define fractional convolution, correlation, and other operations, and can also be further generalized into the linear canonical transformation (LCT). An early definition of the FRFT was introduced by Condon,E. U. Condon, \\"Immersion of the Fourier transform in a continuous group of functional transformations\\", Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

(Note that this article refers to the chirp-z transform variant, not the FRFT.) as essentially another name for a z-transform, and in particular for the case that corresponds to a discrete Fourier transform shifted by a fractional amount in frequency space (multiplying the input by a linear chirp) and evaluating at a fractional set of frequency points (e.g. considering only a small portion of the spectrum). (Such transforms can be evaluated efficiently by Bluestein's FFT algorithm.) This terminology has fallen out of use in most of the technical literature, however, in preference to the FRFT. The remainder of this article describes the FRFT. Introduction The continuous Fourier transform \\\\mathcal{F} of a function is a unitary operator of L2 that maps the function ∆í to its frequential version ∆íÃÇ (all expressions are taken in the L2 sense, rather than pointwise): :\\\\hat{f}(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x)\\\\ e^{- 2\\\\pi i x \\\\xi}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}x and ∆í is determined by ∆íÃÇ via the inverse transform \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} :f(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\hat{f}(\\\\xi)\\\\ e^{2 \\\\pi i \\\\xi x}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\xi, Let us study its n-th iterated \\\\mathcal{F}^{n} defined by \\\\mathcal{F}^{n}[f] = \\\\mathcal{F}[\\\\mathcal{F}^{n-1}[f and \\\\mathcal{F}^{-n} = (\\\\mathcal{F}^{-1})^n when n is a non-negative integer, and \\\\mathcal{F}^{0}[f] = f. Their sequence is finite since \\\\mathcal{F} is a 4-periodic automorphism: for every function ∆í, \\\\mathcal{F}^4 [f] = f. More precisely, let us introduce the parity operator \\\\mathcal{P} that inverts x, \\\\mathcal{P}[f]\\\\colon x \\\\mapsto f(-x). Then the following properties hold: :\\\\mathcal{F}^0 = \\\\mathrm{Id}, \\\\qquad \\\\mathcal{F}^1 = \\\\mathcal{F}, \\\\qquad \\\\mathcal{F}^2 = \\\\mathcal{P}, \\\\qquad \\\\mathcal{F}^4 = \\\\mathrm{Id} :\\\\mathcal{F}^3 = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} = \\\\mathcal{P} \\\\circ \\\\mathcal{F} = \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\circ \\\\mathcal{P}. The FRFT provides a family of linear transforms that further extends this definition to handle non-integer powers of the FT. Definition Note: some authors write the transform in terms of the \\"order \\" instead of the \\"angle \\", in which case the is usually times . Although these two forms are equivalent, one must be careful about which definition the author uses. For any real , the -angle fractional Fourier transform of a function ∆í is denoted by \\\\mathcal{F}_\\\\alpha (u) and defined by Formally, this formula is only valid when the input function is in a sufficiently nice space (such as L1 or Schwartz space), and is defined via a density argument, in a way similar to that of the ordinary Fourier transform (see article), in the general case. If is an integer multiple of œÄ, then the cotangent and cosecant functions above diverge. However, this can be handled by taking the limit, and leads to a Dirac delta function in the integrand. More directly, since \\\\mathcal{F}^2(f)=f(-t)~, ~~\\\\mathcal{F}_{\\\\alpha} ~ (f) must be simply or for an even or odd multiple of respectively. For , this becomes precisely the definition of the continuous Fourier transform, and for it is the definition of the inverse continuous Fourier transform. The FrFT argument is neither a spatial one nor a frequency . We will see why it can be interpreted as linear combination of both coordinates . When we want to distinguish the -angular fractional domain, we will let x_a denote the argument of \\\\mathcal{F}_\\\\alpha. Remark: with the angular frequency œâ convention instead of the frequency one, the FrFT formula is the Mehler kernel, :\\\\mathcal{F}_\\\\alpha(f)(\\\\omega) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1-i\\\\cot(\\\\alpha)}{2\\\\pi}} e^{i \\\\cot(\\\\alpha) \\\\omega^2/2} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\csc(\\\\alpha) \\\\omega t + i \\\\cot(\\\\alpha) t^2/2} f(t)\\\\, dt~. Properties The -th order fractional Fourier transform operator, \\\\mathcal{F}_\\\\alpha, has the properties: * Additivity. For any real angles , ::\\\\mathcal{F}_{\\\\alpha+\\\\beta} = \\\\mathcal{F}_\\\\alpha \\\\circ \\\\mathcal{F}_\\\\beta = \\\\mathcal{F}_\\\\beta \\\\circ \\\\mathcal{F}_\\\\alpha. * Linearity. ::\\\\mathcal{F}_\\\\alpha \\\\left [\\\\sum olimits_k b_kf_k(u) \\\\right ]=\\\\sum olimits_k b_k\\\\mathcal{F}_\\\\alpha \\\\left [f_k(u) \\\\right ] * Integer Orders.

Rather, the fractional Fourier transform of f(u/M) turns out to be a scaled and chirp modulated version of f_{\\\\alpha'}(u) where \\\\alpha eq\\\\alpha' is a different order. Fractional kernel The FrFT is an integral transform :\\\\mathcal{F}_\\\\alpha f (u) = \\\\int K_\\\\alpha (u, x) f(x)\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x where the Œ±-angle kernel is :K_\\\\alpha (u, x) = \\\\begin{cases}\\\\sqrt{1-i\\\\cot(\\\\alpha)} \\\\exp \\\\left(i \\\\pi (\\\\cot(\\\\alpha)(x^2+ u^2) -2 \\\\csc(\\\\alpha) u x) \\\\right) & \\\\mbox{if } \\\\alpha \\\\mbox{ is not a multiple of }\\\\pi, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\delta (u - x) & \\\\mbox{if } \\\\alpha \\\\mbox{ is a multiple of } 2\\\\pi, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\delta (u + x) & \\\\mbox{if } \\\\alpha+\\\\pi \\\\mbox{ is a multiple of } 2\\\\pi, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{cases} Here again the special cases are consistent with the limit behavior when approaches a multiple of . The FrFT has the same properties as its kernels : * symmetry: K_\\\\alpha~(u, u')=K_\\\\alpha ~(u', u) * inverse: K_\\\\alpha^{-1} (u, u') = K_\\\\alpha^* (u, u') = K_{-\\\\alpha} (u', u) * additivity: K_{\\\\alpha+\\\\beta} (u,u') = \\\\int K_\\\\alpha (u, u) K_\\\\beta (u, u')\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}u.  Related transforms  There also exist related fractional generalizations of similar transforms such as the discrete Fourier transform. The discrete fractional Fourier transform is defined by Zeev Zalevsky in and . A quantum algorithm to implement a version of the discrete fractional Fourier transform in subpolynomial time is described by Somma.Rolando D.

A generalization of the classical wavelet transform (WT) in the fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) domains. The FRWT is proposed in order to rectify the limitations of the WT and the FRFT. This transform not only inherits the advantages of multiresolution analysis of the WT, but also has the capability of signal representations in the fractional domain which is similar to the FRFT. Compared with the existing FRWT, the FRWT (defined by Shi, Zhang, and Liu 2012) can offer signal representations in the time-fractional-frequency plane. See also the chirplet transform for a related generalization of the Fourier transform. Generalizations The Fourier transform is essentially bosonic; it works because it is consistent with the superposition principle and related interference patterns. There is also a fermionic Fourier transform.Hendrik De Bie, Fourier transform and related integral transforms in superspace (2008), http://www.arxiv.org/abs/0805.1918 These have been generalized into a supersymmetric FRFT, and a supersymmetric Radon transform. There is also a fractional Radon transform, a symplectic FRFT, and a symplectic wavelet transform.Hong-yi Fan and Li-yun Hu, Optical transformation from chirplet to fractional Fourier transformation kernel (2009), http://www.arxiv.org/abs/0902.1800 Because quantum circuits are based on unitary operations, they are useful for computing integral transforms as the latter are unitary operators on a function space. A quantum circuit has been designed which implements the FRFT.Andreas Klappenecker and Martin Roetteler, Engineering Functional Quantum Algorithms (2002), http://www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0208130  Interpretation  A rect function turns into a sinc function as the order of the fractional Fourier transform becomes 1 The usual interpretation of the Fourier transform is as a transformation of a time domain signal into a frequency domain signal. On the other hand, the interpretation of the inverse Fourier transform is as a transformation of a frequency domain signal into a time domain signal. Apparently, fractional Fourier transforms can transform a signal (either in the time domain or frequency domain) into the domain between time and frequency: it is a rotation in the time-frequency domain. This perspective is generalized by the linear canonical transformation, which generalizes the fractional Fourier transform and allows linear transforms of the time- frequency domain other than rotation. Take the below figure as an example. If the signal in the time domain is rectangular (as below), it will become a sinc function in the frequency domain. But if we apply the fractional Fourier transform to the rectangular signal, the transformation output will be in the domain between time and frequency. Fractional Fourier transform Actually, fractional Fourier transform is a rotation operation on the time frequency distribution. From the definition above, for Œ± = 0, there will be no change after applying fractional Fourier transform, and for Œ± = œÄ/2, fractional Fourier transform becomes a Fourier transform, which rotates the time frequency distribution with œÄ/2. For other value of Œ±, fractional Fourier transform rotates the time frequency distribution according to Œ±. The following figure shows the results of the fractional Fourier transform with different values of Œ±. Time/frequency distribution of fractional Fourier transform  Application  Fractional Fourier transform can be used in time frequency analysis and DSP.E. Sejdiƒá, I. Djuroviƒá, LJ. Stankoviƒá, ‚ÄúFractional Fourier transform as a signal processing tool: An overview of recent developments‚Äù, Signal Processing, vol. 91, no. 6, pp. 1351‚Äì1369, June 2011. doi:10.1016/j.sigpro.2010.10.008. It is useful to filter noise, but with the condition that it does not overlap with the desired signal in the time‚Äìfrequency domain. Consider the following example. We cannot apply a filter directly to eliminate the noise, but with the help of the fractional Fourier transform, we can rotate the signal (including the desired signal and noise) first. We then apply a specific filter, which will allow only the desired signal to pass. Thus the noise will be removed completely. Then we use the fractional Fourier transform again to rotate the signal back and we can get the desired signal. Fractional Fourier transform in DSP Thus, using just truncation in the time domain, or equivalently low-pass filters in the frequency domain, one can cut out any convex set in time‚Äìfrequency space; just using time domain or frequency domain methods without fractional Fourier transforms only allow cutting out rectangles parallel to the axes. Fractional Fourier transforms also have applications in quantum physics. For example, they are used to formulate entropic uncertainty relations. They are also useful in the design of optical systems and for optimizing holographic storage efficiency.N. C. P√©gard and J. W. Fleischer, \\"Optimizing holographic data storage using a fractional Fourier transform\\", Opt. Lett. 36, 2551‚Äì2553 (2011) .

It is made of metal, carbon fiber, or, occasionally, wood, and is typically extensible from the bottom of the instrument, secured there with a thumbscrew or other tightening mechanism. Most bass clarinets and contrabassoons also have a similar fixture. Types of endpins Endpins are usually tipped with a point to stick into the floor, which is sometimes capped with black rubber to preserve the floor's surface and provide friction. Generally, endpins are parallel to the long axis of the instrument, but some cellists and bassists fit their instruments with a Tortelier-style endpin, which angles more towards the floor, improving mobility at the expense of stability. Also, some endpins have a secondary extension for tall musicians. The endpin also may have notches cut in it, allowing it to have extra holding strength at these points. This design is particularly common on string basses and beginning-level cellos. The former often require these because of their greater weight. Endpin anchors Left-hand pressure on a cello fingerboard, acting against the fulcrum of the player's chest and/or knees, may cause the endpin to slip forward on the floor. To prevent this slippage, objects known as \\"endpin stoppers\\", \\"pinstops\\", \\"donuts\\", \\"black holes\\", \\"endpin anchors\\", \\"endpin holders\\", \\"spike holders\\" or \\"rock stops\\" are sometimes used. One type of endpin stopper is placed between the endpin and the floor to add surface area and enhance friction, and stands alone. With this sort, the base must be made out of a non-slippery material like rubber. One very common type consists of a pliable disc surrounding a circular cup to hold the endpin's tip, such as the \\"Sure-Stop\\". A different sort of endpin stopper uses the musician's chair as an anchor. T-shaped wooden stoppers are anchored by placing the top of the T behind the chair legs. Straight plank stoppers use one or two straps with loops at the end which are anchored around the chair legs. Since in this case the distance from the stopper to the chair is usually fixed, such stoppers typically have a line of dents running down the plank, allowing the instrument's angle to be adjusted by placing the endpin in a different dent. Basses do not always require stoppers, being heavier and usually played in a more vertical orientation than a cello. However, bassists often use rockstops when sitting on a stool or when playing on high-glossed floors or uneven surfaces. Endpins and flooring Pointed endpins can cause extensive damage, especially to tile and wooden flooring. Many music rooms bear evidence of this in a myriad of small holes or chips. Here, rubber tips and/or stoppers are beneficial. On carpet, the damage is less extensive. The bare tip is thus most effective in outdoor conditions, carpeted areas, and old flooring where the damage will not be as serious. However, the sharper the endpin, the more likely it is to go through the standard rubber tip.

During the autumn and winter it is found in southern Queensland, western New South Wales, western Victoria, and also in South and Western Australia. Adult bogong moths breed and larvae hatch during this period, consuming winter pasture plants during their growth. During the spring, the moths migrate south or east and reside in mountains such as Mount Bogong, where they gregariously aestivate over the summer until their return towards breeding grounds again in the autumn. The moth's name, bogong, is derived from the Australian Aboriginal Dhudhuroa word bugung, describing the brown colouration of the moth. It is an icon of Australian wildlife due to its historical role as an important food source and because aboriginal tribes would come to where the moths spend the summer to feast on them and hold intertribal gatherings. In recent years, it has become well known for its accidental invasion of major cities like Canberra, Melbourne, and Sydney due to strong winds during its spring migration. Concerns have been raised over the potential role of agriculture in turning the bogong moth into a biovector of arsenic in the Australian Alps. Aggregations of bogong moths in aestivation sites has led to the bioaccumulation of the pollutant in both the surrounding local environment and within predators, particularly in the endangered mountain pygmy-possum. However, no conclusive evidence has directly linked agriculture as the source of arsenic in bogong moths.  Taxonomy  The bogong moth was first described by French lepidopterist Jean Baptiste Boisduval in 1832, who described the moth as Noctua infusa from a type specimen from Australia. He described the moth as having blackish brown hind wings. However, in 1903 British entomologist George Hampson classified a specimen with white hind wings under this name, alongside another specimen of Agrotis spina with blackish brown hind wings. Australian amateur entomologist Alfred Jefferis Turner identified A. spina as a synonym of A. infusa in 1920. I. F. B. Common, an Australian entomologist, found specimens with both hind wing colours in 1954. Specimens with the white hind wings were only found during specific months in mercury vapour light traps near Canberra, and he attributed the white hind wing specimens to a seasonal form. The moth's name, bogong, is derived from the Australian Aboriginal Dhudhuroa word bugung, meaning brown moth. Its presence has contributed to the naming of numerous locations and landmarks. For example, a town, Bogong, in the Australian state of Victoria has been named after the moth.Physical Map of Australia, special advertising feature of Australia.com on pg 16, National Geographic magazine, May 2006, Washington DC Mount Bogong, located south of the Bogong High Plains, is also named after the moth, with its traditional name, Warkwoolowler, meaning the mountain where Aboriginal people collected the 'boo.gong fly'. In the Australian state of New South Wales, a series of mountains in the Kosciuszko National Park are named the Bogong Peaks.  Description  Side profile of an adult Adult bogong moths have an overall dark brown colouration, with a dark stripe interrupted by two light-coloured spots on the wings, distinguishing it from other moths. There are visual differences between the migratory and nonmigratory forms of the moth; migratory moths have brown hind wings while nonmigratory moths have paler hind wings. Bogong moths have a wingspan ranging between 40‚Äì50 mm (1.6-2.0 in), and a body length of around 25‚Äì35 mm (1-1.4 in). The average weight of an adult bogong moth is 0.326 grams. Bogong moth eggs are dome‚Äìshaped in appearance and are vertically ridged. They are 0.7 mm (0.03 in) in diameter and 0.4 mm (0.02 in) in height. Caterpillars initially start out with a pale colouration, but as they grow and consume food they become green with pale and dark stripes and spots. Larvae achieve a maximum length of 50 mm (2.0 in).  Distribution and habitat  Bogong moth populations are primarily located across southern Australia, west of the Great Dividing Range. The regions contain populations of nonmigratory and migratory moths of this species, distinguished by their differing seasonal presences in each region. The adult bogong moth lays eggs across New South Wales, southern Queensland, and northern parts of Victoria, where larvae hatch and grow until adulthood. During the spring season and subsequent summer aestivation, bogong moths migrate south or east towards the Australian Alps, and can be found in the Australian Capital Territory and Bogong Mountains. However, bogong moths can also be found in locations as far as Tasmania and New Zealand due to strong winds that blow them off their path.  Breeding grounds  Bogong moth eggs and larvae are primarily found in self-mulching soils (soil that mixes itself) and crop pastures, where both wild and agricultural larval food sources are abundant during the autumn and winter seasons. The heavy presence of larvae in these pastures can lead to significant crop damage. During the spring and summer seasons, when grasses overtake these pastures, conditions are unfavourable for larval survival since larvae do not consume these plants. This leads to delayed breeding, as bogong moths are multivoltine and so can raise multiple generations. Instead, adult bogong moths migrate in a southerly direction during the summer and aestivate (remain dormant), until conditions are favourable again.  Aestivation sites  During the spring migration, adult bogong moths can be found in their ideal aestivation sites, which generally consist of cool, dark caves and crevices but can include spaces underneath tors and even fallen tree trunks. Stable temperatures and humidity make these locations ideal for bogong moth aestivation. Crevices regulate their environment through wind flow, and caves generally have more regular temperatures and greater humidity. This reduces water loss in bogong moths during their inactivity. While temporary sites can be used in lower elevations, these sites undergo massive population fluctuations and movements throughout their use. Permanent aestivation sites are generally found in higher altitudes of 1500 metres (4920 ft) or above, with the largest, most stable aggregations found on the summits of mountains such as Mt. Gingera.  Life cycle  Adult bogong moths lay up to 2000 eggs in the soil or on plants near the soil after returning from aestivation sites in the autumn migration. Incubation times vary depending on temperature, with eggs hatching after a period of 4‚Äì7 days in laboratory conditions. The larvae of bogong moths undergo six instars. Caterpillars grow slowly throughout the first three instars, taking until June to develop over the winter. However, the larvae go through fast growth during the spring, reaching the final instar in late August to September, soon before migration. They are active at night, when they feed on plants within breeding grounds. Larvae undergo pupation in soil chambers at a depth of 20‚Äì150 mm (0.8-7.9 in). Pupation can last between 3‚Äì11 weeks depending on the temperature and environment. Pupae are 20 mm (0.8 in) in length and have a shiny, brown appearance. Adults emerge from the soil chambers and shortly after begin migration. Adult bogong moths are active at night, and have different seasonal behaviors. During the spring, bogong moths feed and migrate south, where they aestivate during the summer. Adult bogong moths are not sexually mature yet, and do not actively seek food during this period of dormancy. In autumn, the moths migrate again and return to their breeding grounds, laying eggs and dying.

Attacks on a wide variety of cultivated crops have been seen, with plants such as Medicago species, wheat, cabbages, cauliflowers, silver beet, peas, and potatoes all recorded being consumed by bogong moth caterpillars. However, the larvae avoid grasses, which overtake pastures during the summer, making summer unfavourable due to lack of larval food sources. Adult bogong moths feed on the nectar of flowers such as Epacris, Grevillea and Eucalyptus while breeding or migrating, but will not actively feed during aestivation.  Migration  Bogong moths undergo whole scale long-distance migration biannually, in which they can travel up to 965 km (600 miles). The spring migration begins in early September and occurs from the lowlands of Southern Australia south towards the Australian Alps for purposes of reaching aestivation sites. During the summer, the moths remain in their aestivation sites until autumn, when they migrate back towards the breeding grounds of the lowlands as early as February, but primarily in April. The bogong moth utilizes particular aestivation sites repeatedly throughout migrations, as seen with the development of parasites that depend on the regular arrival and departure of the moths from caves. The population within each aestivation site fluctuates throughout the summer due to moth mortality and the departure and arrival of moths either migrating further south for aestivation or north to return to breeding grounds. However, this differs from changes during migration periods, when the populations rapidly increase with arrival or decrease with departure. Bogong moths are nocturnal migrants, but the exact mechanism for long-distance navigation is not clear. It is possible that they are oriented by light, as seen in the influence of light intensity on activity during aestivation. Additionally, bogong moths may use an internal magnetic compass to aid in navigation, as seen in the similar monarch butterfly. A study published in 2018 concluded that the Bogong moth uses a combination of the Earth's magnetic field and recognizable landmarks to calibrate their route. However, there are also nonmigratory populations; this generally occurs in areas with favourable conditions, where migration to avoid harsh conditions such as seasonal changes in larval food crop abundance is not necessary. Some populations of bogong moths in areas such as Tasmania and in coastal populations of New South Wales do not migrate, and reach sexual maturity at a faster rate than migratory populations.  Social aggregation  Gregarious aggregation of bogong moths during aestivation During the spring migration, bogong moths gregariously aggregate with densities reaching 17,000 moths per square metre (10.8 square feet) within caves, crevices, and other areas hidden from the sunlight. The lack of light and relatively constant temperature and humidity makes these spots favourable during aestivation. The first moths that arrive occupy the deepest and darkest locations, using their fore tarsi to grip onto the rock faces, and aggregations form around these initial areas, with moths arriving later settling for less ideal areas with more sunlight, higher temperatures, and decreased humidity. To diminish the amount of light that reaches their light- sensitive eyes, later moths push themselves underneath the wings and abdomens of moths that arrived earlier and place their hind legs on top of the moths beneath them. This physical contact and aggregation allow the moths to retain body moisture. When the aestivating moths are disturbed, the moths within the area of disturbance briefly spread out and leave the aggregation, dropping excrement when unsettled before quickly returning to the aggregation and re- positioning themselves. While the moths mostly remain dormant during aestivation, there are some periods of activity within the aggregation which are correlated to changes in light intensity. During dawn and dusk, portions of the population become active, first crawling around and spreading out, and then flying out of their shelter into the open. While some water drinking has been observed, no evidence of copulation or active foraging has been found during these periods of activity.  Diapause  Facultative diapause, an optional period of delayed development in response to environmental conditions, accompanies the biannual migration of the bogong moths. While one generation of moths goes through the two migrations each year, multiple generations are possible in favourable conditions and higher temperatures, as growth across all life stages can occur faster. For example, without the diapause, the bogong moth would normally complete sexual maturation within 50 days. However, this maturation is delayed due to the lack of larval food sources during the summer season. During the summer, hot temperatures occur and grasses, which are an unfavourable diet for bogong moth larvae, overtake pastures and make up the majority of the plants occupying the pastures. Bogong moths avoid this harsh environment by delaying development during the summer so that their eggs do not hatch in a poorly-suited environment; instead, they migrate to cooler, more suitable areas and delay their development during aestivation until the winter season, when they return to the breeding grounds and winter pasture crops begin to grow again. During aestivation, the bogong moths remain dormant for several months, possibly delaying development due to the lower temperatures. The food they consume during the migration is also dedicated to building fat reserves for aestivation rather than development, as bogong moths must consume more food during the autumn migration before maturation and mating. However, in areas with favourable conditions, bogong moths do not have to migrate during the summer.  Ecology   Enemies   Predators  The bogong moth suffers from predation during both its migration and aestivation. During the spring and autumn migrations, several species of birds, mammals, and even fish have been recorded preying on the moth. Little raven, currawong and Richard's pipit congregations form to feast on bogong moths as they travel from aestivation sites during migration. Aboriginal tribes also traveled to aestivation sites to feast on the dormant moths, and may have searched for these bird congregations to locate these sites. Bats also attack the moths during active flight periods during the dusk, and foxes, bush rats, and dusky antechinus have been recorded eating moths. Of the mammals that prey on the bogong moth, the endangered mountain pygmy-possum is the most reliant on bogong moths as a source of food. Parasites on the antennae of an adult moth  Parasites  Two species of mermithid nematodes parasitize the bogong moth during its aestivation: Amphimermis bogongae and Hexamermis cavicola. The parasites are transmitted to bogong moths through water; the early instar larval nematodes reside in the debris of the cave floors of common aestivation sites, and crawl up to reach the moths through trickles of water coming down the walls. Bogong moths are infected upon their arrival within the caves once they drink the water. After a few months, the larval nematodes emerge from the moths, which causes the moth to die, and burrow into the cave floor, where they mature and lay eggs over the winter and wait for the next spring migration of the moths. The nematodes are unusual in that they parasitize adult bogong moths instead of the more commonly utilized larval host stage. The nematodes' life cycles demonstrate an adaptation to the migration of the bogong moths, as they are dependent on bogong moths returning to the same aestivation sites.  Biovector of arsenic  In 2001, a few months after rainfall had washed out debris consisting of dead moths from within the cave, the complete death of local grasses was seen outside of an aestivation site of the bogong moth. Investigation into the causes of the grass mortality showed that the concentration of arsenic in the surrounding areas was much higher than normal, and the source was determined to be the bogong moths. Since the bogong moths do not feed at their aestivation sites, they had absorbed arsenic from lowland feeding sites as larvae and subsequently transported it over long distances into the mountains. Bioaccumulation, the absorption and accumulation of substances by organisms, occurs with arsenic in bogong moths. While levels within each individual moth are small, the sheer quantity of moths in the area led to a concentration of the pollutant to damaging levels in the environment. The presence of arsenic has also been shown in the feces of mammals such as the mountain pygmy-possum, demonstrating the bioaccumulation of this pollutant in animals. While no source has been determined, concerns have been raised over the possible role of agriculture in the bioaccumulation of arsenic due to its presence in historically and presently-used insecticides. This has led to the discontinued use of insecticides in controlling the bogong moth in urban areas, in favour of less intrusive methods. Decline in numbers In the spring and summer seasons of 2017-8 and 2018-9, dramatic drops in numbers of the moths in the Alpine caves have been observed. Millions of the moths have usually lined the walls of these caves over summer, but for the past two seasons there have been none in some caves, according to Professor Eric Warrant of Lund University in Sweden. He says that the drop in numbers was probably caused by a lack of rainfall due to winter drought in their breeding areas and climate change, the lack of rain producing insufficient vegetation to feed the caterpillars. Some caves still harboured thousands of moths, which suggested that the moths \\"came from different breeding grounds, where one location wasn't as badly affected by the drought as the other. I don't think they will disappear completely, but there's certainly a possibility that they could become locally extinct at their breeding grounds.\\", Warrant said. Other biologists and ecologists have pointed to the dramatic effect on animals which feed on the moths, which are an important source of protein for wildlife, including the threatened mountain pygmy possum as well as other insectivorous mammals and birds. \\"The vulnerability of the Australian Alps to climate change is the worst in the world because we've got these short little mountains so when it gets warmer, there is nowhere for these cold-adapted species to go\\", according to Euan Ritchie, a wildlife ecologist at Deakin University.  Interactions with humans   Food source  Bogong moths were historically used as a food source by Aboriginal tribes located in Southeastern Australia. Tribes would travel to the Australian Capital Territories towards the summits of mountains to harvest moths, where they also met with other Aboriginal tribes, fostering intertribal relations as people gathered and feasted during these harvests. People would travel into the caves and scrape aestivating moths off the walls into nets and dishes using sticks. Once gathered, the moths would be roasted to remove the scales and wings and then either eaten immediately or ground into a paste and made into \\"moth meat\\" cakes that would last and could be taken home. The moth was said to have a nice nutty flavor that was most similar to walnuts or almonds. The bogong moth is an icon of Australian wildlife due to this historical role as an important food source and as an intertribal gathering point for Aboriginal tribes in Southeastern Australia.  Pest of crop plants  Bogong moths have had a role in damaging crop plants since winter pastures serve as breeding grounds and larval food sources. Outbreaks of caterpillars have been recorded across New South Wales, with damage primarily done to heavy black soil flats. Medicago species, wheat, cabbages, cauliflowers, silver beet, peas, and potatoes have been recorded as being attacked by bogong moth larvae.Bogong moths in Sydney, aggregating in the crevices of a building. Control The bogong moth is a minor and irregular pest of crop plants in Australia. This makes it difficult to predict their pattern and control. Typically, control of this species is not cost effective. However, if there are heavy damaging outbreaks of the bogong moth, insecticide is applied to the crops that are affected by it.  Migration issues  Millions of bogong moths have been blown off course from their spring migration into major cities like Canberra, Melbourne, and Sydney due to strong winds, with notable instances of bogong moth invasions including the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. The large amount of light and noise present can also attract moths towards cities. Parliament House in Canberra, present in the middle of the bogong moth flight path during migrations, was notably susceptible to moths. Light pollution from the building traps them during their flight and encourages the moth to find shelter within crevices, shadows, and sometimes even the insides of the buildings during the light and heat of the day. Efforts have been made to try and drive the moths out by turning off lights, covering attractive corners and pathways indoors, and using insecticides. However, insecticide use has ceased in urban areas due to concerns over environmental consequences.

Biography He was born in Desio in the province of Milan. Simeoni is known for his maverick actions. During the stage win in the Vuelta he stopped just before the finish line and walked across the finish line with his bike in his hands. He did so as a tribute to the victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks. Later the Union Cycliste Internationale fined him for this. In May 2009 he returned his Italian Championship jersey as a protest after his team was not invited to the 2009 Giro d'Italia.Simeoni hands back jersey after Giro snub Following his retirement, Simeoni started organizing local races and set up a youth team. In early 2017, he was set to take up a position within the Italian Cycling Federation but was forced to withdraw due to a rule preventing anyone with a doping offense from taking office. The federation was unable to take into account that Simeoni's sentence came in the light of a confession during the court cases against Michele Ferrari. Feud with Lance Armstrong More famous is Simeoni's argument with Lance Armstrong. Simeoni was treated by doctor Michele Ferrari, who was also Armstrong's doctor. Simeoni testified in court that he began doping in 1993, that Dr. Ferrari had prescribed him doping products such as EPO and Human Growth Hormone in 1996 and 1997, and that Ferrari also gave him instructions on how to use these products and that he used them.Simeoni testifies: \\"Dr Ferrari prescribed EPO\\", CyclingNews, February 13, 2002 In 2001 and 2002 Simeoni was suspended for several months for doping use. Armstrong reportedly called Simeoni a \\"liar\\" in an interview with the French newspaper Le Monde in July 2003. Simeoni lodged a charge of defamation against Armstrong and demanded ‚Ç¨100,000. Simeoni announced that he would give any money awarded to him to charity. In 2006 Simeoni dropped the lawsuit. On the 18th stage of the 2004 edition of the Tour de France, Simeoni gapped up to a breakaway of six riders that posed no threat to Armstrong's leading position. By then, Armstrong was leading the race by seven minutes, and was well on his way to his sixth consecutive Tour victory. Nevertheless, Armstrong broke from the peloton and chased Simeoni down, prompting Armstrong's rival T-Mobile Team to try to catch the breakaway. This would not only catch Simeoni, but end any realistic chance of the six riders in the original breakaway had of winning the stage. The six riders implored Armstrong to drop back to the peloton, but Armstrong would not go unless Simeoni went with him.Stage 18 - July 23: Annemasse - Lons le Saunier, 166.5 km, CyclingNews, July 23, 2004 Armstrong's longtime top domestique, George Hincapie, later recalled being surprised at Armstrong's move, given his all- but-insurmountable lead. In full view of the television cameras, Armstrong put his hand on Simeoni's back and spoke to him. Simeoni subsequently told the United States Anti-Doping Agency that Armstrong told him in Italian: Armstrong then spoke to some of the other riders in the breakaway. It later emerged that Armstrong told them that he would not allow the breakaway to survive as long as Simeoni was part of it. At that point, the other riders badgered Simeoni until he dropped back to the peloton with Armstrong. When Simeoni dropped back, he was abused by many other riders, including Andrea Peron, Filippo Pozzato and Giuseppe Guerini. In a later interview, he told of how Daniele Nardello also abused him, calling him \\"a disgrace\\".Jeremy Whittle - Bad Blood Afterwards, Armstrong made a \\"zip-the-lips\\" gesture but later said that Simeoni \\"did not deserve\\" to win a stage. Armstrong said he was acting under the traditional authority granted to the \\"Patron\\" of the peloton by the unwritten rules of cycling.Stage 20 - July 25: Montreau - Paris-Champs- Elysees, 163 km, CyclingNews, July 25, 2004 He claimed that he was \\"protecting the interests of the peloton,\\" and that Simeoni was out to \\"destroy the sport that pays him.\\" The race ended two days later. By this time, Armstrong had long since secured his victory, and as such, the final stage is a slow stage in which the celebration starts early. This year, however, Simeoni continuously attacked to take revenge for what Armstrong did three days before. Each time, Armstrong's team chased him down. Simeoni was again insulted and spat at by other riders after this. Since Simeoni was a prosecution witness in legal proceedings against Ferrari at the time of Armstrong's move against him in the 2004 Tour, Italian authorities threatened to bring charges of witness intimidation against Armstrong. In March 2005 Armstrong was interviewed by the authorities, apparently without resolution. Armstrong had been indicted by Italian authorities in December 2005. A criminal court refused to hear the case in January 2006.Simeoni, Armstrong drop defamation actions , VeloNews, April 13, 2006 On March 6, 2006 Armstong's attorney asked a court to drop charges in Simeoni's defamation lawsuit. On April 13, 2006 Simeoni dropped the defamation suit and Armstrong dismissed his countersuit. Like Christophe Bassons six years earlier, Simeoni's career suffered after his confrontation with Armstrong. He found it hard to catch on with a team. The final straw came in 2009, when his team was left out of the 2009 Giro d'Italia even though he won the 2008 Italian National champion Road race. In protest, Simeoni returned his 2008 Italian Championship jersey in protest in May 2009. He was suspended for four months by the Italian Cycling Federation for doing so. He retired at the end of the 2009 season. In October 2012, USADA stripped Armstrong of all seven of his Tour titles and banned from all sports that follow the World Anti-Doping Code for life, effectively ending his competitive career. Simeoni was one of the key witnesses in USADA's case against Armstrong and related how Armstrong threatened him during the 2004 Tour. In its \\"reasoned decision\\" announcing Armstrong's ban, USADA harshly criticized Armstrong's behavior during the incident, which it called a \\"sad moment in cycling.\\" It found that Armstrong's decision to chase Simeoni down was \\"dangerous and impetuous,\\" since it put him at serious risk of an accident. Moreover, it found that Armstrong had engaged in \\"attempted witness intimidation,\\" which was in and of itself a violation of the World Anti-Doping Code. Armstrong confessed to doping in January 2013. When asked about the confession, Simeoni said: \\"I acknowledge Armstrong's confession on television but he put me through such a humiliating experience and damaged me so much, in terms of sport, morale, and finances that I don't know if I could ever forgive him.\\"http://www.news.com.au/sport/cycling/italian-cyclist-filippo-simeoni-not- ready-to-forgive-lance-armstrong/story-fngr0c3c-1226557279367 Simeoni was played by Belgian former professional cyclist Kevin Hulsmans in the 2015 film The Program.

The HNC, selected the aging civilian politician Phan Kh·∫Øc S·ª≠u as chief of state, and S·ª≠u selected H∆∞∆°ng as prime minister, a position that had greater power. However, Kh√°nh and the senior generals retained the real power.Moyar (2004), pp. 765-66. At the time, both Saigon and Washington were planning a large-scale bombing campaign against North Vietnam in an attempt to deter communist aggression, but were waiting for stability in the south before starting the air strikes.Kahin, pp. 240-80. In January 1965, H∆∞∆°ng introduced a series of measures to intensify the anti-communist war effort by expanding military expenditure using aid money and equipment from the Americans, and increasing the size of the armed forces by widening the terms of conscription. This provoked widespread anti- H∆∞∆°ng demonstrations and riots across the country, mainly from conscription- aged students and pro-negotiations Buddhists.Kahin, pp. 267-69. Reliant on Buddhist support, Kh√°nh did little to try to contain the protests.Moyar (2004), pp. 774-75. Kh√°nh then decided to have the armed forces take over the government. On 27 January, Kh√°nh removed H∆∞∆°ng in a bloodless putsch with the support of Thi and Ky. He promised to leave politics once the situation was stabilized and hand over power to a civilian body. It was believed that some of the officers supported Kh√°nh's increased power so that it would give him an opportunity to fail and be removed permanently.Moyar (2006), p. 775. Kh√°nh persisted with the facade of civilian government by retaining figurehead chief of state Phan Kh·∫Øc S·ª≠u and making economics professor Nguy·ªÖn Xu√¢n O√°nh the caretaker prime minister.Karnow, p. 400.Kahin, p. 293. Kh√°nh's deposal of the prime minister nullified a counter-plot involving H∆∞∆°ng that had developed during the civil disorders that forced him from office. In an attempt to pre- empt his deposal, H∆∞∆°ng had backed a plot led by some ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát-oriented Catholic officers reported to include Generals Thieu and Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu C√≥. They planned to remove Kh√°nh and bring Khiem back from Washington. The US Embassy in Saigon was privately supportive of the aim, but was not ready to fully back the move as they regarded it as poorly thought out and potentially a political embarrassment due to the need to use an American plane to transport some plotters, including Khiem, between Saigon and Washington. As a result, the Deputy Ambassador U. Alexis Johnson only promised asylum for H∆∞∆°ng if necessary.Kahin, p. 297. Kh√°nh's deposal of H∆∞∆°ng further heightened American opposition to him and fears that his reliance on Buddhist support would result in his not taking a hardline position against the communists.Kahin, pp. 294-95. Aware that US support for him was further ebbing away, Kh√°nh tried to initiate peace negotiations with the Vi·ªát C·ªông, but he only managed an exchange of letters and was yet to organize any meetings or negotiations before he was overthrown. In the meantime, this only intensified US efforts to engineer a coup, and many of Kh√°nh's colleagues--mostly Catholic ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát supporters--had by then privately concluded that he was set to pursue a deal with the communists.Kahin, p. 295. Many of whom felt that Kh√°nh thought of himself as the \\"Sihanouk of Vietnam\\"; the Cambodian monarch had managed to avoid the Cold War for the time being by shunning both communist and anti- communist blocs. During the first half of February, suspicions and evidence against Kh√°nh began to solidify, an example being his order to release the wife of communist leader Hu·ª≥nh T·∫•n Ph√°t from jail. Taylor's superiors in Washington began to align with his view, giving him more scope to agitate for a coup.Kahin, p. 511.Kahin, p. 296. 1967 Presidential election In the 1967 South Vietnamese presidential election, H∆∞∆°ng finished fourth with 474,100 votes (10.0%).Nohlen, D, Grotz, F & Hartmann, C (2001) Elections in Asia: A data handbook, Volume II, p331 Presidency On 21 April 1975, Thi·ªáu resigned and handed the presidency to H∆∞∆°ng. On 28 April 1975, after one week as president, Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn H∆∞∆°ng resigned and handed power over to General D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh, who presided over the surrender of the government two days later. Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn H∆∞∆°ng was placed under house arrest by the communist regime. When deemed adequately reformed in 1977, his civil rights were restored but he declined. Instead, he asked for all officials of the ARVN to be released from prison before he would take his place among the freed. His request was ignored. The former president died quietly in his own home in 1982.

He was a close friend of General and Mexican President Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna. During the Texas Revolution, Castrill√≥n advocated for mercy for captured Texian soldiers. He was killed at the Battle of San Jacinto, despite attempts by Republic of Texas Secretary of War Thomas Rusk to save his life. Early life Manuel Fern√°ndez Castrill√≥n was born in either Cuba or Spain.http://www.sanjacinto- museum.org/The_Battle/Commanders/Castrillon/#Pane2 Although he was originally a member of a Spanish force attempting to subdue the Mexican rebels during the Mexican War of Independence, Castrill√≥n soon switched sides and served with the Mexican independence forces.Todish et al. (1998), p. 115. He served under Mexican General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna in an 1822 battle for Veracruz, and again later as Santa Anna worked to quell various rebellions.Fisher, Handbook of Texas Texas Revolution During the Texas Revolution, Castrill√≥n served as Santa Anna's aide-de-camp. Battle of the Alamo He joined Santa Anna on the 1836 invasion of Texas, which first journeyed to San Antonio de Bexar, and besieged the small Texan force garrisoned at the Alamo. Castrill√≥n often argued against Santa Anna's decision to immediately assault the Alamo, advocating instead that the Mexican army wait for the arrival of the heavier cannon that would reduce the Alamo walls to rubble. On March 6, 1836, during the final assault of the Alamo, Castrill√≥n took command of the Toluca Battalion after Colonel Francisco Duque was wounded. This column attacked the north wall of the Alamo.Edmondson (2000), pp. 356-7. According to the diary of Jos√© Enrique de la Pe√±a, after the Mexican victory at the Battle of the Alamo, Castrill√≥n brought before Santa Anna six or seven Texians who he had taken prisoner during the final Alamo assault. Historian Edmondson speculates that these men may have been sick and unable to participate in the fighting;Edmondson (2000), p. 373. other historians have theorized that the prisoners may have included Davy Crockett, who Castrill√≥n spared when the final small band of Texians was overwhelmed.Hardin (1994), p. 198. Castrill√≥n petitioned that their lives be spared. Santa Anna had stated that no prisoners would be taken and ordered the Texians executed on the spot. Weeks later, during the Goliad Massacre, Fern√°ndez Castrill√≥n also protested - in vain - the execution of nearly 400 Texian prisoners, including their leader, James Fannin. After the Battle of the Alamo, the Mexican army moved east into the more settled areas of Texas. Battle of San Jacinto Castrill√≥n saw no further fighting until April 21, 1836, when Texas General Sam Houston launched a surprise attack on Mexican forces at the Battle of San Jacinto. As Texian forces jumped the makeshift barricades surrounding the Mexican army encampment, Castrill√≥n, Santa Anna, and Colonel Juan Almonte all began shouting orders, some contradictory, in the hopes of rallying their troops to mount a defense. Castrill√≥n took charge of the men operating the army's single cannon, the \\"Golden Standard\\". Within a few moments, most of the Mexican artillerymen had been killed by Texian riflemen. The surviving troops fled, shouting at Castrill√≥n to join them.Hardin (1994), p. 211. According to reports from survivors of the battle, Castrill√≥n shouted back that \\"I have been in forty battles and never showed my back. I am too old to do it now.\\"Hardin (1994), p. 212. He then turned back to the cannon. His bravery impressed Thomas J. Rusk, the acting Secretary of the War for the new Republic of Texas government. Rusk rode along the Texian lines, shouting at his men to spare the general. At one point, he knocked aside rifles that were trained on Castrill√≥n. His efforts were in vain; other Texian troops rode straight past Rusk and shot and killed Castrill√≥n. Many Texians held Castrill√≥n as a hero who chose to fight when he could have run. Santa Anna, however, later decried Castrill√≥n as an incompetent fool whose actions led to the Mexican defeat. Castrill√≥n's body was claimed by his friend Lorenzo de Zavala, a member of the Republic of Texas cabinet, and buried in the nearby de Zavala family cemetery. The cemetery is located at 3523 Independence Pkwy, La Porte, Texas.

The oldest manuscript copies of the work are found in Vienna (Austrian National Library, Codex 2527) and in Wolfenb√ºttel (Herzog-August-Bibliothek, Cod. Guelf. Gud. Lat. 69 2¬∞). Gotthold Ephraim Lessing rediscovered the document when he worked as librarian in Wolfenb√ºttel, and published excerpts in 1774. These aroused great interest as they disproved Vasari's myth of Jan van Eyck developing the technique of oil painting in the early 15th century, about which antiquaries had already become suspicious.Gotlieb, Marc, \\"The Painter's Secret: Invention and Rivalry from Vasari to Balzac\\", p. 473, The Art Bulletin, Vol. 84, No. 3 (Sep., 2002), pp. 469‚Äì490, JSTOR Theophilus' Schedula allows detailed insights into the techniques used in the applied arts in the high Middle Ages. The work is divided into three books. The first covers the production and use of painting and drawing materials (painting techniques, paints, and ink), especially for illumination of texts and painting of walls. The second deals with the production of stained glass and techniques of glass painting, while the last deals with various techniques of goldsmithing and other metalwork. It also includes an introduction into the building of organs. Theophilus contains perhaps the earliest reference to oil paint. The work has been translated into English, French, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, Hungarian, German, Italian, Japanese, Bulgarian, and Russian, mostly in the 19th and 20th centuries. 'Theophilus' was quite possibly a Benedictine monk. It has been suggested (particularly by Eckhard Freise) that Theophilus is the same person as the artisan monk Roger of Helmarshausen. Roger appears to have come from Stavelot Abbey in the Meuse River region, was active as an artist and author between 1100 and 1107 in St. Pantaleon's church in Cologne, and moved to Helmarshausen Abbey in 1107. The identity of the two men has been argued among researchers for some time, but Freise's conclusions have not yet been accepted by all researchers. Other suggestions have also been made, and at present there can not be said to be a consensus., \\"Around Theophilus\\": expert meeting, Wolfenb√ºttel 2010. Theophilus, as the author of a \\"handbook\\", has been described as a mere theorist, but this view is currently in the minority. The First Book, on painting, is not particularly well-informed, but adequately reliable, the Second, on glass, is better, while most of the Third Book is clearly the work of a practising metalworker. It has recently been suggested that the apparent contradictory evidence as to dating, practical experience, and location of 'Theophilus' is best explained if the Schedula is understood to be a compilation.Clarke, M.

It was released in 1973, and popularised by Games Workshop in 1985. Players build railways and then run trains along them.  Gameplay  The game is in two stages; in the first part players draw tracks on the card using washable finetip pens (allowing the board to be cleaned for reuse). Players have a building allowance each turn; building through difficult terrain costs more moves. Players earn money for connecting cities to their railway network, and pay other players for connecting to or building alongside their track. Once all cities are joined by railway tracks, the second part of the game starts. Players race their trains along the tracks between randomly chosen pairs of cities; just as in real life, players must pay other players to use elements of their track if they don't have a complete route of their own. The choice of routes raced is random; each city is used one or more times. Money is awarded to the trains that arrive first and second, and the player with the most money when all routes have been raced is the winner.  History  Watts, a geography teacher, originally developed the game as a teaching aid to help students become familiar with the geography of industrialized countries and to try to demonstrate how geography and competition had resulted in lines being developed in some places but not others. He had self-published the game, initially in kit form (hex sheets and colouring instructions) for many years, from at least the early 1970s, before it was released in a boxed set. Trading as \\"Rostherne Games\\", Watts sold individual maps, together with brief instructions and the special dice required. Many maps were available, based on Watts' own encyclopedic knowledge of railway history, and each set in a specific geographical area, such as England, Scotland, Leeds to Liverpool, or India. The maps were made of laminated paper, and the Rostherne Games edition of Railway Rivals was both addictive and very cheap. During the height of the UK postal Diplomacy hobby in the 1980s and 1990s, Railway Rivals (with slightly adapted rules to allow for simultaneous building) was probably the second most widely played game after Diplomacy itself, with several zines (including Watts' own Rostherne Games Review) dedicated principally to Railway Rivals. In the 1980s, the game was formally published first by Butehorn and then by Schmidt Spiele (from 1981), both in Germany, and won the Spiel des Jahres in 1984. In the UK, it was the mass-market Games Workshop edition that brought it to many people's attention. The GW game board was made of laminated card, with a map of Central England on one side and the Western USA on the other; pens, dice and small plastic trains were also included. The game has subsequently been republished under its German name, Dampfross, initially by Laurin (1990) and then by Queen Games (1995). In 1998 Watts sold the rights to all Rostherne Games to Theo Clarke.  Maps  Initially, the towns on the maps were indexed by the 36 numbers 11-66, allowing a town to be randomly generated by rolling two standard dice. Some towns could have more than one index number associated with them; for example, on maps that included London, it was usual for London to have 4 or even 6 index numbers to reflect its size. As Watts' experience increased, map design got more complex. It became standard for a map to have six \\"special runs\\" to destinations at the edges of the map, or special classes of town (for example, sea ports). In redesigns of some early maps, valleys were widened, to make it easier for more than one player to have a route along them. The building cost of going into or out of a hill was also reduced, again increasing competition for previously secure groups of towns. The first digit of a town's number was considered its \\"sector\\" and in postal games GMs would ensure that in the racing phase each sector would see one race to each other sector and one to a special run, to ensure a uniform distribution of the races. In the game's late-1980s and early-1990s heyday, Watts appeared to target a more \\"gamer\\" than \\"family\\" audience, producing maps on larger hex sheets and with 52 towns indexed by cards rather than the 42 given by the towns + special runs. This led to games taking longer to complete; this appears to have been unpopular with the market, as from 1992 on new map designs in general went back to having 36 towns + special runs and using smaller hex sheets. At this point Watts began to make more use of \\"small towns\\", towns which shared their index number with one other town and only scored 3 points rather than 6 for the first player to connect to them; this seems to have been a compromise to allow him to encourage the development of historically occurring tracks without lengthening the game. The original maps are now out of print. Nevertheless, hundreds of after-market maps have been developed for Railway Rivals (including one for Middle-earth), and they can be developed straightforwardly by enthusiasts. The results of games of Railway Rivals can be compared with the way that real railways developed in a particular area.

Colorado State University is the current academic sponsor, and the program is conducted on a cruise ship. Nearly 73,000 undergraduate students from over 1,500 colleges and universities have participated in Semester at Sea. During the spring and fall semesters, up to 600 undergraduates participate in the 100- to 110-day program. During the semester the ship circumnavigates the globe, traveling from North America east (across the Atlantic) or west (across the Pacific) and visiting 10 to 11 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, South America, and North America. Although the program had voyages through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal, piracy concerns in the Gulf of Aden have changed a typical voyage to around Africa. ISE had hosted a summer, 65-day Semester at Sea program which focused on one region of the world. In May 2011, SaS introduced a 26-day Maymester voyage with a curriculum based around the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals. The Maymester voyage offered students the opportunity to earn four to five transferable credits. After the Maymester 2012 voyage, however, Semester at Sea canceled the short-term voyages due to low enrollment. A two-week, December‚ÄìJanuary Enrichment Voyage for continuing education participants was also cancelled. The voyages' itineraries focused on Central and South America, often transiting the Panama Canal or traveling up the Amazon River. The ISE presently offers fall and spring voyages.  Academics  Students attend classes in a number of subjects and disciplines, including humanities courses relevant to one (or more) of the countries on the itinerary, while the ship is at sea. All students are required to take an interdisciplinary, core global- studies course. Although Colorado State University is the program's academic sponsor, Semester at Sea and is open to students from any university. Faculty members are drawn from colleges and universities throughout the United States and around the world. No classes are taught in port, and students can take Semester at Sea-sponsored trips or travel independently in the port country. Before arriving at a port, they are briefed on the culture and societal rules of the country they are visiting. At the port of call, guest speakers (including community leaders and American ambassadors) deliver lectures to the students and faculty. The pre-port briefing and guest lectures are intended to prepare students for their stay in the country.

A lease was announced in May 2015 for the ship previously known as the to be renovated, re-flagged and renamed the , operated by V-Ships. Semester at Sea has used a number of ships as its floating campus, including the MS Seven Seas (formerly the USS Long Island), the SS Ryndam (not the later freighter of that name), the SS Universe (formerly the SS Atlantic), the and the . The SS Seawise University (formerly the RMS Queen Elizabeth), which SaS intended to use, burned and sank in 1972 in Hong Kong Harbour during her conversion into a floating campus. The Universe Explorer, which retired in 2005, had four main decks and a small swimming pool at the stern of the ship. The Seawise University, Universe, and Universe Explorer were supplied and managed by Tung Chao Yung's Seawise Foundation. Concerns about the separation of the Institute for Shipboard Education and the Seawise Foundation and the safety of the MV Explorer contributed to the University of Pittsburgh's severing ties to the program in 2005.  Ports of call  The program itinerary differs each semester, and the ship typically docks at 10 or 11 ports. An early-1990s spring itinerary included Nassau, Caracas, Salvador (Brazil), Cape Town, Mombasa, Chennai, Singapore, Shanghai, Osaka and Hong Kong. More recent voyages have explored Hawaii, Japan, China, Vietnam, Myanmar, India, Mauritius, South Africa, Ghana, Morocco and the Netherlands. The fall 2019 itinerary included the Netherlands, Poland, the Kiel Canal, Portugal, Spain, Croatia, Morocco, Ghana, Brazil, Trinidad and Tobago, the Panama Canal, Ecuador and Costa Rica. Denmark was a port of call in summer 2008, Namibia in fall 2008, Bulgaria in summer 2009 and Senegal in fall 2015 (the program's first visits to those countries).

Accessed 2011-06-30 The spring 1994 voyage (on the SS Universe) ended in Hong Kong because the ship was scheduled for dry-dock maintenance after the voyage. However, the ship was unable to adhere to its sailing schedule during the semester due to mechanical difficulties. It made several unscheduled stops, and had to anchor between ports while repairs were made. The ship was towed to the South China Sea and anchored overnight, guarded by crew members against piracy. A planned stop at Manila was canceled, and the Universe was rerouted to Singapore. Examinations were completed at anchor in the harbor, and the students and faculty were flown to the next two planned ports (Osaka and Shanghai). In Shanghai, the Universe met the students for the final leg of the voyage to Hong Kong. 1997's fall voyage was rerouted due to terrorism concerns. Ramzi Yousef was convicted of masterminding the 1993 World Trade Center bombing on November 12 of that year, and the U.S. State Department issued a travel warning for American citizens in the Middle East. The Luxor massacre occurred five days later, while the ship was docked in Port Said and the students were in Egypt. Although no students were involved, fears of terrorism resulted in the removal of the next two ports (Israel and Turkey) from the itinerary and the ship was rerouted to Cyprus and Spain.  2000‚Äì2009  Two incidents occurred during the fall 2000 semester on the SS Universe Explorer. Entering Vietnam, the ship was struck by a barge; its hull was damaged, and student rooms were closed. The Universe Explorer remained an extra day in Vietnam for repairs. Preparing to head north through the Suez Canal to Egypt, Turkey, Croatia, and Spain, the ship's captain decided to reroute due to threats to ships in the Suez region; the voyage instead stopped in Kenya, South Africa, and Brazil. After the September 11 attacks, the Universe Explorer was redirected after its stop in Kobe. The planned route ‚Äì from Penang and the Indian Ocean through the Suez Canal to ports in Egypt and Croatia ‚Äì was changed by the U.S. State Department to include Singapore, Seychelles, and Cape Town. On the Indian Ocean, the ship's communication with other vessels was limited to protect the American citizens on board. On January 26, 2005, the MV Explorer weathered a combination of three storms in the North Pacific. A freak wave smashed the windows of the bridge, breaking one of them and briefly affecting the ship's navigation systems. The U.S. Coast Guard dispatched a Lockheed HC-130 search-and-rescue plane and two cutters after receiving a distress call from the ship. Two crew members were injured during the incident. While the ship was repaired in Honolulu, the students were flown to Hong Kong to continue their courses. The Explorer rejoined them in Ho Chi Minh City, and completed the semester. Later that year, safety concerns were cited by the University of Pittsburgh for ending its 24-year academic sponsorship of the program. 2005's summer voyage was rerouted from London to Le Havre due to safety concerns after the July 7 London bombings. During the fall 2006 voyage, Typhoon Shanshan caused the MV Explorer (en route from Japan to Qingdao, China) to be rerouted to Hong Kong. The summer 2008 voyage was rerouted from Istanbul to Alexandria due to bomb threats in Turkey. That fall, a University of Wisconsin student was struck and killed by a drunk driver in Hong Kong. The spring and fall 2009 itineraries were altered to avoid Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden.  2010‚Äì2019  During the fall 2010 voyage, a University of California, Santa Barbara student died while the ship was docked in Ho Chi Minh City. The spring 2011 itinerary was changed after the T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami, and the MV Explorer docked in Taiwan. During the fall 2012 voyage, a University of Virginia student died in a recreational-boating accident while the ship was docked in Roseau, Dominica. The fall 2014 voyage was rerouted from Senegal and Ghana to Italy and Spain due to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and State Department warnings about the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, and later voyages were also rescheduled. The MS World Odyssey fall 2015 trip was rerouted from Turkey to Croatia to avoid terrorism and the refugee crisis. The spring 2017 voyage was rerouted from Mauritius at the request of the vessel owner, and the ship went from India to South Africa. On November 7, 2017 in Bagan, Myanmar, a St. Edward's University student was fatally injured in a fall from a pagoda.  Coronavirus Related Updates  Spring 2020 The Spring 2020 voyage avoided a number of countries (including China) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The students, faculty, staff, and Lifelong Learners aboard the MV World Odyssey, were rerouted to Vietnam for an extra week to make up for lost time in China. The World Odyssey left Kobe as scheduled on January 28, arriving in Ho Chi Minh City on February 4. The ship left Ho Chi Minh City three hours late. The original itinerary had the World Odyssey stopping in Malaysia from February 19 to 24 before heading to India from February 29 to March 5. After a one-day fuel stop in Malaysia on February 19, the World Odyssey attempted to reroute to Victoria, Seychelles with an expected arrival on February 27 and departure on March 1. The evening before arrival, however, the Seychellois government denied the vessel entry. The World Odyssey then headed south to Mauritius, and docked on February 29. The ship spent one day in port, followed by two days at sea around the island due to limited dock availability; it then returned to dock in Port Louis on March 3‚Äì7. The morning of March 6, students were informed of another itinerary change due to quarantine concerns when arriving at European ports from North Africa. SAS concluded the Spring 2020 voyage, cancelling all South Africa related programming on March 12 and advised students to return home from Cape Town in light of a U.S. State Department worldwide travel advisory. All students were required to disembark from the World Odyssey between March 14, 2020 and March 16, 2020, were provided with resources to help them travel home, and completed the academic program remotely from March 17 and April 20.  Fall 2020  On Tuesday, May 12, 2020, Semester at Sea announced that the Fall 2020 voyage would not be sailing as planned citing the COVID-19 pandemic and health and safety being the primary decision factor. The modified itinerary was scheduled to being with an online program and then continuing on with a condensed voyage beginning in late October. Voyagers were scheduled to embark in Tenerife, Canary Islands, sail on to Trinidad and Tobago, Belize, Colombia, Panama Canal Transit, Ecuador, and Easter Island (Chile) with final voyage disembarkation taking place in Puntarenas, Costa Rica.

Ries was a friend, pupil and secretary of Ludwig van Beethoven. He composed eight symphonies, a violin concerto, eight piano concertos, three operas, and numerous other works, including 26 string quartets. In 1838 he published a collection of reminiscences of his teacher Beethoven, co-written with Franz Wegeler. The symphonies, some chamber works‚Äîmost of them with piano‚Äîhis violin concerto and his piano concertos have been recorded, exhibiting a style which, given his connection to Beethoven, lies between the Classical and early Romantic styles.  Early life  Ries was born into a musical family of Bonn. His grandfather, Johann Ries (1723‚Äì1784), was appointed court trumpeter to the Elector of Cologne at Bonn. Ries was the eldest son of the violinist and Archbishopric Music Director Franz Anton Ries (1755-1846) and the brother of violinist and composer (Pieter) Hubert Ries (1802-1886) and violinist Joseph Ries (1798-1850). He received piano lessons from his father and was instructed by Bernhard Romberg, who also belonged to the Bonn Hofkapelle as a cellist. At the end of 1798 he went for further training in Arnsberg to meet an organist friend of his father; a year later he went to Munich. There he worked hard as a music copyist. The French dissolved the Electoral court of Bonn and disbanded its orchestra, but in the early months of 1803 the penniless Ries managed to reach Vienna, with a letter of introduction written by the Munich-based composer Carl Cannabich on 29 December 1802. Ries was then the pupil of Ludwig van Beethoven, who had received some early instruction at Bonn from Ries's father, Franz Ries. Together with Carl Czerny, Ries was the only pupil who Beethoven taught during these years. Beethoven took great care of the young man, teaching him piano, sending him to Albrechtsberger for harmony and composition and securing for him positions as piano tutor in aristocratic households in Baden and Silesia. Ries was soon also Beethoven's secretary: he had correspondence with publishers, copied notes, completed errands and provided Beethoven the beautiful apartment in the Pasqualati House where the composer lived for several years. Ries made his public debut as a pianist in July 1804, playing Beethoven's C minor concerto, Op. 37, with his own cadenza, which he was allowed to write. His performance received glowing reviews. Ries spent the summers of 1803 and 1804 with Beethoven in Baden bei Wien, as well as in D√∂bling. Ries' work as a secretary and a copyist won Beethoven's confidence in negotiations with publishers and he became a fast friend. One of the most famous stories told about Ries is connected with the first rehearsal of the Eroica Symphony, when Ries, during the performance, mistakenly believed that the horn player had come in too early and said so aloud, infuriating Beethoven. Ries feared conscription in the occupying French army (though he was blind in one eye) and so he fled Vienna in September 1805. He stayed in Bonn for a year with his family, and this is where he wrote his first piano concerto in C major, now known as Concerto no. 6 for piano and orchestra. While Ries was living in Bonn, his two piano sonatas, op. 1, dedicated to Beethoven were published by Simrock.H. P. Clive, Beethoven and His World: A Biographical Dictionary, p. 285 Starting in 1807, Ries spent the next two years in Paris before returning to Vienna. Here Ries quickly expanded his catalogue of works (mainly to chamber and piano music, such as the later popular Septet op. 25). Ries had great difficulty succeeding in the capital city of the French Army and was at times so discouraged that he wanted to give up the profession of music and seek a position in the civil service. On 27 August 1808, Ries arrived back in Vienna, where he again made contact with Beethoven. Ries helped Beethoven with the premieres of the Fifth and Sixth Symphonies and other works for the benefit concert held on 22 December 1808. In July 1809, Ries left Vienna for the second time; this time he was threatened by the call-up to the Austrian military, which mobilized all forces against the threat to Vienna by Napoleon. Again he took refuge in his paternal home of Bonn and spent the next one and a half years composing a series of larger works: his first Symphony, his second Piano Concerto in C minor (later known as Concerto no. 4 op. 115) and his Violin Concerto (unpublished during his lifetime) in E minor op. 24. Later life In January 1811, Ries left for Russia with the goal of an extended concert trip via Kassel, Hamburg, Copenhagen, Stockholm to St. Petersburg. There, he met his old teacher Bernhard Romberg, with whom he played concerts in Western Russia. He composed two piano concertos for this tour, No. 2 in E flat major, op. 42 and No. 3 in C sharp minor, op. 55. However, in the summer of 1812, with Napoleon advancing on Moscow, Ries left Russia to tour across Europe, arriving in London in April 1813. The composer's next eleven years were spent in England. Johann Peter Salomon, the great friend and patron of Haydn‚Äîwho had formerly played with Franz Anton Ries in the court orchestra at Bonn‚Äîincluded Ries regularly in his Philharmonic concert series, where a review praised his \\"romantic wildness\\". In London too, Ries established himself as a respected piano teacher in the wealthy districts of the city and in 1814 he married Harriet Mangeon (1796-1863), from an opulent family. In 1815 he became a member of the Philharmonic Society and in the same year was elected to be one of its directors. Ries never lost touch with Beethoven and had a role in the London publications of many works of Beethoven after the peace of 1815, including the 1822 commission from the Philharmonic Society that resulted in the Choral Symphony. Commemorative plaque of the London premier of Beethoven's 9th symphony, commissioned by Ries Ries wrote his Symphony No. 2 in D minor (numbered as Symphony no. 5), inspired by the quality of the Orchestra of the Philharmonic Society. His compositional work is effectively split in two at this time. Ries composed most of his orchestral works during his time in London: six of his eight symphonies (as well as two of his five concert overtures) were created for concerts of the Philharmonic Society. On the other hand, he wrote now increasingly light fare for the piano: fantasies, rondos, variations, adapted divertimentos and others, mostly about well-known opera arias or popular folk song melodies. the production of chamber music (string quartets, violin sonatas) and intermediate piano music (sonatas) came almost to a standstill. After 1820 he had disagreements with his fellow directors of the Philharmonic Society; Ries was of the opinion that his works were not adequately taken into account in the programming of concerts. In 1821, he resigned his position of Director and began to increase his contacts with continental Europe with the idea of a return. On 3 May 1824 he gave his farewell concert in London, at which he dedicated a Piano Concerto (Concerto no. 7 in A minor for piano and orchestra op. 132). In July 1824 Ries retired to Germany with his English wife and three children, but returned to musical life in Frankfurt am Main as composer and conductor. His reputation as an instrumental composer and bandleader had strengthened now in Central Europe. In 1834 he was appointed head of the city orchestra and Singakademie in Aachen, for which he wrote two oratorios, Der Sieg des Glaubens (1829) and Die K√∂nige in Israel (1837), both of which have been recorded. In addition, he was festival director of the Lower Rhenish Music Festival eight times ‚Äî between 1824 and 1837. The first year he was the director of the festival he took the opportunity of performing Beethoven's 9th Symphony, which was the German premier of this work. In Godesburg during 1825 and 1826 Ries wrote five string quartets (op. 150, no. 1‚Äì2; op. 166, no. 1; WoO 34 and 36). String quartets were a genre that Ries had barely touched. For his entire time in London he only wrote three works of this genre. Beginning in April 1827 the Ries family moved to Frankfurt am Main. In Frankfurt the existence of a renowned Opera House attracted him. Since 1826, he had had plans to write operas, which he brought to fruition in the years 1827/28. On 15 October 1828, his first opera, The Robber Bride, was premiered in Frankfurt with great success. To the direction of the Dublin Music Festival in 1831 he used a month's stay in London, where he composed his second opera, The Sorceress (published in Germany under the title Liska or the Witch by Gyllensteen). It was premiered on 4 August 1831 at the London Royal Adelphi Theatre. His third opera was composed in 1834 (Die Nacht auf dem Libanon WoO 51), which for many years remained unperformed. In 1832/33 Ries and his wife made a several-month journey through Italy for a concert tour (which would remain his last), which led to Venice, Milan, Rome and Naples. During the trip, Ries wrote his last Piano Concerto (in G minor op. 177), his last Piano Sonata (A flat major op. 176) and his last String Quartet (F minor WoO 48, during his lifetime, unpublished). In the summer of 1834, Ries was briefly Director of the Aachen Theatre Orchestra in conversation; but he rejected the offer. In the winter 1836/37 Ries stopped in Paris; there, he composed his last work for orchestra (the overture dramatique L'apparition WoO 61) and briefly went to London, where he succeeded in the world premiere of his new overture in a concert of the Philharmonic Society (13 March). Ries returned to Frankfurt and he accepted an offer in August 1837. Ries was not able to fulfill the offer since he died on 13 January 1838 after a short and unexpected illness. When Ries died, he was so forgotten that no leading music magazine wrote an obituary for him. Ferdinand Ries is buried in the Tomb (No. 45) of the Klotz family in the Frankfurt am Main cemetery. The music Cecil Hill wrote a scholarly thematic catalog, listed below, of Ries's 300 works: for each work he provided incipits (opening themes) for each movement, dedications, known early reviews, and known dates of composition. While one of the few widely circulated recordings of Ries's music was for some time that of his third piano concerto, now all of his symphonies, the other concertos, and a number of chamber works are available on compact disc, and his surviving music for piano and orchestra and chamber works are the focus of ongoing projects on various record labels as well.

It is the first book in Card's The Tales of Alvin Maker series and is about Alvin Miller, the seventh son of a seventh son. Seventh Son won a Locus Award and was nominated for both the Hugo and World Fantasy Awards in 1988. Seventh sons have strong \\"knacks\\" (specific magical abilities), and seventh sons of seventh sons are both extraordinarily rare and powerful. In fact, young Alvin appears to be the only one in the world. His abilities make him the target of The Unmaker, who recognizes Alvin's powers as those of a Maker‚Äîonly the second ever, and it had been a long time since the first had walked on water and turned water to wine. The Unmaker works largely through water, trying to kill Alvin in his early years, before he can master his abilities. Plot summary Alvin's family is migrating west. When they try to cross the Hatrack River, an unknown force known as the Unmaker tries to stop the as-yet-unborn Alvin from being born - since Alvin would be the seventh son of a seventh son, therefore possessing incredible powers as a Maker. The force sends a tree down the river to crush the wagon the pregnant Mrs. Miller is riding in. Her eldest son Vigor diverts the tree, but is mortally wounded in the act. Because a seventh son must be born while the other six are alive, Vigor desperately clings to life until Alvin is born. Help is dispatched at the insistence of five-year-old \\"torch\\" (a person who, among other things, can see the life forces of people and under certain conditions, their myriad alternate futures) Peggy Guester, who sees Alvin and Alvin's possible future as a Maker. As the years pass, Alvin avoids numerous attempts of an unknown force trying to kill him, often helped by the intervention of a mysterious protector. Alvin's father, a non-believer in God, believes that a water spirit is trying to kill Alvin. When Alvin is seven, a new Reverend, named Thrower, arrives in town, trying to build a church. Alvin's father refuses to help, but Mrs. Miller has all of her sons work on building the church. When the ridgebeam is being placed onto the church in construction, it shivers and breaks, seemingly about to fall on Alvin. However, mid-air, it breaks in two, and misses Alvin - yet another example of Alvin's near-death experiences. When Alvin goes home, he provokes one of his sisters by poking her, so they get revenge on Alvin by putting needles into his night gown. Alvin avenges himself by using his knack to send cockroaches after his sisters. The plan works, Alvin winning a victory over his sisters. However, afterwards, he has a vision he dubs Shining Man, who makes him promise only to use his knack for good. When Alvin is ten, \\"Taleswapper\\" (William Blake) a traveling storyteller arrives in the town Alvin's parents have founded. After stopping by Alvin's brother-in-law's house (who directs Taleswapper to the Miller house), he visits the church, where he notices that the altar has been touched upon by an evil entity. Reverend Thrower kicks him out, and Taleswapper goes to the Millers' place, where his timely intervention stops Mr. Miller from killing Alvin. Taleswapper is welcomed in. Taleswapper helps to put a name to the unknown force that tries to stop Alvin from realizing his true powers as a Maker: the Unmaker. Meanwhile, the Reverend Philadelphia Thrower becomes a tool of the Unmaker - the evil force that touched the altar. Soon the Miller family goes to a quarry to cut out a millstone. Here one of Alvin's knacks is revealed - single-handedly he cuts the millstone through hard rock. During the night, Taleswapper and Mr. Miller guard the millstone. Mr. Miller tells Taleswapper a story about how a force is trying to use him to kill Alvin. Taleswapper advises Mr. Miller to send Alvin away to someplace where he may be safe. The next day, the millstone is taken home. The Unmaker finally manages to injure Alvin, by making a millstone fall on him. Taleswapper encourages him to heal himself. Alvin does so, but finds that a part of his bone he cannot heal alone. He realizes that he might need outside help to heal himself. Reverend Thrower (acting as a surgeon) attempts to kill him, but finds himself blocked by a mysterious force. Alvin heals himself (with the aid of his brother Measure, who performs the surgery). Alvin is contracted as an apprentice to a blacksmith in the town on the Hatrack River where he was born. Taleswapper meets Peggy. It is revealed that she, using her torch powers and Alvin's birth caul, had protected Alvin all these years, and the Unmaker was only able to hurt Alvin with the millstone because Alvin himself overrode her powers. The book's sequel, second in the tales of Alvin's life, is Red Prophet.

Chicago has played a central role in American economic, cultural and political history. Since the 1850s Chicago has been one of the dominant metropolises in the Midwestern United States, and has been the largest city in the Midwest since the 1880 census. The area's recorded history begins with the arrival of French explorers, missionaries and fur traders in the late 17th century and their interaction with the local Pottawatomie Native Americans. Jean Baptiste Point du Sable was the first permanent non-indigenous settler in the area, having a house at the mouth of the Chicago River in the late 18th century. There were small settlements and a U.S. Army fort, but the soldiers and settlers were all driven off in 1812. The modern city was incorporated in 1837 by Northern businessmen and grew rapidly from real estate speculation and the realization that it had a commanding position in the emerging inland transportation network, based on lake traffic and railroads, controlling access from the Great Lakes into the Mississippi River basin. Despite a fire in 1871 that destroyed the Central Business District, the city grew exponentially, becoming the nation's rail center and the dominant Midwestern center for manufacturing, commerce, finance, higher education, religion, broadcasting, sports, jazz, and high culture. The city was a magnet for European immigrants‚Äîat first Germans, Irish and Scandinavians, then from the 1890s to 1914, Jews, Czechs, Poles and Italians. They were all absorbed in the city's powerful ward-based political machines. Many joined militant labor unions, and Chicago became notorious for its violent strikes, and high wages. Large numbers of African Americans migrated from the South starting in the World War I era as part of the Great Migration. Mexicans started arriving after 1910, and Puerto Ricans after 1945. The Cook County suburbs grew rapidly after 1945, but the Democratic party machine kept both the city and suburbs under control, especially under mayor Richard J. Daley, who was chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party. Deindustrialization after 1970 closed the stockyards and most of the steel mills and factories, but the city retained its role as a financial and transportation hub. Increasingly it emphasized its service roles in medicine, higher education, and tourism. The city formed the political base for national leaders of the Democratic Party, especially Stephen A. Douglas in the 1850s, Adlai Stevenson in the 1950s, and Barack Obama in recent years. Pre-1830  Early native settlements  Retrospective map showing how Chicago may have appeared in 1812 (right is north, published in 1884) Chicago in 1820 At its first appearance in records by explorers, the Chicago area was inhabited by a number of Algonquian peoples, including the Mascouten and Miami. The name \\"Chicago\\" is derived from a French rendering of the Native American word shikaakwa, known to botanists as Allium tricoccum, from the Miami-Illinois language. The first known reference to the site of the current city of Chicago as \\"Checagou\\" was by Robert de LaSalle around 1679 in a memoir. Henri Joutel, in his journal of 1688, noted that the wild garlic, called \\"chicagoua\\", grew abundantly in the area. According to his diary of late September 1687: The tribe was part of the Miami Confederacy, which included the Illini and Kickapoo. In 1671, Potawatomi guides first took the French trader Nicolas Perrot to the Miami villages near the site of present-day Chicago.Potawatomi history Pierre Fran√ßois Xavier de Charlevoix would write in 1721 that the Miami had a settlement in what is now Chicago around 1670. Chicago's location at a short canoe portage (the Chicago Portage) connecting the Great Lakes with the Mississippi River system attracted the attention of many French explorers, notably Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette in 1673. The Jesuit Relations indicate that by this time, the Iroquois tribes of New York had driven the Algonquian tribes entirely out of Lower Michigan and as far as this portage, during the later Beaver Wars. Ren√©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, who traversed the Kankakee and Illinois Rivers south of Chicago in the winter of 1681‚Äì82, identified the Des Plaines River as the western boundary of the Miami. In 1683, La Salle built Fort St. Louis on the Illinois River. Almost two thousand Miami, including Weas and Piankeshaws, left the Chicago area to gather on the opposite shore at the Grand Village of the Illinois, seeking French protection from the Iroquois. In 1696, French Jesuits led by Jean- Fran√ßois Buisson de Saint-Cosme built the Mission of the Guardian Angel to Christianize the local Wea and Miami people.Garraghan, Gilbert J. (1921). The Catholic Church in Chicago, 1673-1871, p. 13. Loyola University Press. Shortly thereafter, Augustin le Gardeur de Courtemanche visited the settlement on behalf of the French government, seeking peace between the Miami and Iroquois. Miami chief Chichikatalo accompanied de Courtemanche to Montreal. The Algonquian tribes began to retake the lost territory in the ensuing decades, and in 1701, the Iroquois formally abandoned their claim to their \\"hunting grounds\\" as far as the portage to England in the Nanfan Treaty, which was finally ratified in 1726. This was largely a political maneuver of little practicality, as the English then had no presence in the region whatsoever, the French and their Algonquian allies being the dominant force in the area. A writer in 1718 noted at the Was had a village in Chicago, but had recently fled due to concerns about approaching Ojibwes and Pottawatomis. The Iroquois and Meskwaki probably drove out all Miami from the Chicago area by the end of the 1720s. The Pottawatomi assumed control of the area, but probably did not have any major settlements in Chicago. French and allied use of the Chicago portage was mostly abandoned during the 1720s because of continual Native American raids during the Fox Wars.Charles J. Balesi, The Time of the French in the Heart of North America, 1673-1818. 3rd ed. (2000) There was also a Michigamea chief named Chicago who may have lived in the region. In the 1680s, the Illinois River was called the Chicago River.Wayne C. Temple, Indian Villages of the Illinois Country: Historic Tribes, p. 12: http://www.museum.state.il.us/publications/epub/indian_villages_il_country_wayne_temple.pdf. First non-native settlements The first settler in Chicago was Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, a free black man, who built a farm at the mouth of the Chicago River in the 1780s. He left Chicago in 1800. In 1968, Point du Sable was honored at Pioneer Court as the city's founder and featured as a symbol. Fort Dearborn depicted as in 1831, sketched 1850s although the accuracy of the sketch was debated soon after it appeared. In 1795, following the Northwest Indian War, some Native Americans ceded the area of Chicago to the United States for a military post in the Treaty of Greenville. The US built Fort Dearborn in 1803 on the Chicago River. It was destroyed by Indian forces during the War of 1812 in the Battle of Fort Dearborn, and many of the inhabitants were killed or taken prisoner. The fort had been ordered to evacuate. During the evacuation soldiers and civilians were overtaken near what is today Prairie Avenue. After the end of the war, the Potawatomi ceded the land to the United States in the 1816 Treaty of St. Louis. (Today, this treaty is commemorated in Indian Boundary Park.) Fort Dearborn was rebuilt in 1818 and used until 1837.Lloyd Lewis and Henry Justin Smith, Chicago: The History of Its Reputation, Chicago: 1929; Kessinger Publishing, LLC, reprint 2009, accessed 24 Aug 2010 19th century city 1821 Survey of Chicago Thompson's plat, the first official map of what would become the City of Chicago. Chicago in 1830, as depicted in 1884 Chicago in 1832, as depicted in 1892 Chicago in 1836 Chicago from the west in 1845 Extensions to city limits through 1884 In 1829, the Illinois legislature appointed commissioners to locate a canal and lay out the surrounding town. The commissioners employed James Thompson to survey and plat the town of Chicago, which at the time had a population of less than 100. Historians regard the August 4, 1830 filing of the plat as the official recognition of a location known as Chicago. Yankee entrepreneurs saw the potential of Chicago as a transportation hub in the 1830s and engaged in land speculation to obtain the choicest lots. On August 12, 1833, the Town of Chicago was incorporated with a population of 350.The first boundaries of the new town were Kinzie, Desplaines, Madison, and State Streets, which included an area of about three-eighths of a square mile (1 km2). See Frank Alfred Randall, John D. Randall, History of the Development of Building Construction in Chicago 1999, pp. 57, 88. On July 12, 1834, the Illinois from Sackets Harbor, New York was the first commercial schooner to enter the harbor, a sign of the Great Lakes trade that would benefit both Chicago and New York state. Chicago was granted a city charter by the State of Illinois on March 4, 1837; it was part of the larger Cook County. By 1840 the boom town had a population of over 4,000. After 1830, the rich farmlands of northern Illinois attracted Yankee settlers. Yankee real estate operators created a city overnight in the 1830s. To open the surrounding farmlands to trade, the Cook County commissioners built roads south and west; the latter crossed the \\"dismal Nine-mile Swamp,\\" the Des Plaines River, and went southwest to Walker's Grove, now the Village of Plainfield. The roads enabled hundreds of wagons per day of farm produce to arrive, so the entrepreneurs built grain elevators and docks to load ships bound for points east through the Great Lakes. Produce was shipped through the Erie Canal and down the Hudson River to New York City; the growth of the Midwest farms expanded New York City as a port. In 1837 Chicago held its first mayoral election, electing William B. Ogden as its inaugural mayor. Emergence as a transportation hub 1853 Bird's eye view of Chicago 1857 Bird's eye view of Chicago In 1848, the opening of the Illinois and Michigan Canal allowed shipping from the Great Lakes through Chicago to the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. The first rail line to Chicago, the Galena & Chicago Union Railroad was completed the same year. Chicago would go on to become the transportation hub of the United States with its road, rail, water and later air connections. Chicago also became home to national retailers offering catalog shopping such as Montgomery Ward and Sears, Roebuck and Company, which used the transportation lines to ship all over the nation. By the 1850s, the construction of railroads made Chicago a major hub; over 30 lines entered the city. The main lines from the East ended in Chicago, and those oriented to the West began in Chicago, so by 1860 the city became the nation's trans-shipment and warehousing center. Factories were created, most famously the harvester factory opened in 1847 by Cyrus Hall McCormick. It was a processing center for natural resource commodities extracted in the West. The Wisconsin forests supported the millwork and lumber business; the Illinois hinterland provided the wheat. Hundreds of thousands of hogs and cattle were shipped to Chicago for slaughter, preserved in salt, and transported to eastern markets. By 1870 refrigerated cars allowed the shipping of fresh meat to eastern cities.William Cronin, Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West. (1991) The prairie bog nature of the area provided a fertile ground for disease-carrying insects. In springtime Chicago was so muddy from the high water that horses could scarcely move. Comical signs proclaiming \\"Fastest route to China\\" or \\"No Bottom Here\\" were placed to warn people of the mud. Travelers reported Chicago was the filthiest city in America. The city created a massive sewer system. In the first phase, sewage pipes were laid across the city above ground, to use gravity to move the waste. The city was built in a low-lying area subject to flooding. In 1856, the city council decided that the entire city should be elevated four to five feet by using a newly available jacking-up process. In one instance, the 5-story Brigg's Hotel, weighing 22,000 tons, was lifted while it continued to operate. Observing that such a thing could never have happened in Europe, the British historian Paul Johnson cites the astounding feat as a dramatic example of American determination and ingenuity: based on the conviction that anything material is possible.Paul Johnson, History of the American People, Harper Perennial, U.S.A., 1999, p. 570. Immigration and population in the 19th century 1874 Birds eye map of Chicago A bird's-eye view of Chicago in 1898. It became the second American city to reach a population of 1.6 million Chicago - State St at Madison Street, 1897 Although originally settled by Yankees in the 1830s, in the 1840s many Irish Catholics came to the city as a result of the Great Famine. Later in the century, the railroads, stockyards and other heavy industry of the late 19th century attracted a variety of skilled workers from Europe, especially Germans, Polish, English, Swedes, Norwegians and Dutch.Melvin Holli, and Peter d'A. Jones, eds. Ethnic Chicago: A multicultural portrait (1995). In 1840, Chicago was the 92nd most populous city in the United States. Its population grew so rapidly that twenty years later, it was the ninth most populous city in the country. In the pivotal year of 1848, Chicago saw the completion of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, its first steam locomotives, the introduction of steam-powered grain elevators, the arrival of the telegraph, and the founding of the Chicago Board of Trade.Goebel-Bain, Angela, 2009, \\"From Humble Beginnings: Lincoln's Illinois 1830-1861,\\" The Living Museum, 71(1&2): 5-25; p. 21 By 1870 Chicago had grown to become the nation's second largest city, and one of the largest cities in the world. By 1857 Chicago was the largest city in what was then called the Northwest. In 20 years, Chicago grew from 4,000 people to over 90,000. Chicago surpassed St. Louis and Cincinnati as the major city in the West and gained political notice as the home of Stephen Douglas, the 1860 presidential nominee of the Northern Democrats. The 1860 Republican National Convention in Chicago nominated home-state candidate Abraham Lincoln. The city's government and voluntary societies gave generous support to soldiers during the war.Kurt A. Carlson, \\"Backing the Boys in the Civil War: Chicago's Home Front Supports the Troops - and Grows in the Process,\\" Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society, (2011) 104#1/2, pp 140-165 Many of the newcomers were Irish Catholic and German immigrants. Their neighborhood saloons, a center of male social life, were attacked in the mid-1850s by the local Know-Nothing Party, which drew its strength from evangelical Protestants. The new party was anti-immigration and anti-liquor, and called for the purification of politics by reducing the power of the saloonkeepers. In 1855, the Know Nothings elected Levi Boone mayor, who banned Sunday sales of liquor and beer. His aggressive law enforcement sparked the Lager Beer Riot of April 1855, which erupted outside a courthouse where eight Germans were being tried for liquor ordinance violations. After 1865, saloons became community centers only for local ethnic men, as reformers saw them as places that incited riotous behavior and moral decay.Perry R. Duis, The Saloon: Public Drinking in Chicago and Boston, 1880-1920 (1983) Salons were also sources of musical entertainment. Francis O'Neill, an Irish immigrant who later became police chief, published compendiums of Irish music largely collected from other newcomers playing in saloons.Chief O'Neill Blog Between 1870 and 1900, Chicago grew from a city of 299,000 to nearly 1.7 million, at the time the fastest-growing city in world history. Chicago's flourishing economy attracted huge numbers of new immigrants from Eastern and Central Europe, especially Jews, Poles and Italians along with many smaller groups. Many business people and professionals arrived from the eastern states. Relatively few new arrivals came from Chicago's rural hinterland. The exponential growth put increasing pollution on the environment, as hazards to public health impacted everyone. Gilded Age The Chicago Water Tower, one of the few surviving buildings after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. A residential building in Chicago's Lincoln Park in 1885, when the city had dirt roads In 1871, most of the city burned in the Great Chicago Fire. The damage from the fire was immense; 300 people died, 18,000 buildings were destroyed and nearly 100,000 of the city's 300,000 residents were left homeless. Several key factors exacerbated the spread of the fire. At the time, most of Chicago's buildings and sidewalks were constructed of wood. Also, the lack of attention to proper waste disposal practices, sometimes deliberate to favor certain industries, left an abundance of flammable pollutants in the Chicago River, along which the fire spread from the city's South Side to the north. The fire led to the incorporation of stringent fire-safety codes that included a strong preference for masonry construction.Carl Smith, Urban Disorder and the Shape of Belief: The Great Chicago Fire, the Haymarket Bomb, and the Model Town of Pullman (1996) Danish immigrant Jens Jensen arrived in 1886 and soon became a successful and celebrated landscape designer. Jensen's work was characterized by a democratic approach to landscaping, informed by his interest in social justice and conservation, and a rejection of antidemocratic formalism. Among Jensen's creations were four Chicago city parks, most famously Columbus Park. His work also included garden design for some of the region's most influential millionaires. The World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 was constructed on former wetlands at the present location of Jackson Park along Lake Michigan in Chicago's Hyde Park neighborhood. The land was reclaimed according to a design by landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted. The temporary pavilions, which followed a classical theme, were designed by a committee of the city's architects under the direction of Daniel Burnham. It was called the \\"White City\\" for the appearance of its buildings.Norman Bolotin and Christine Laing, The World's Columbian Exposition: The Chicago World's Fair of 1893 (2002) excerpt and text search The Exposition drew 27.5 million visitors and is considered among the most influential world's fairs in history, affecting art, architecture and design throughout the nation.Chicago History. Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau. The classical architectural style contributed to a revival of Beaux Arts architecture that borrowed from historical styles, although Chicago was also developing the original skyscraper and organic forms based in new technologies. The fair featured the first, and until recently, largest Ferris wheel ever built. The soft, swampy ground near the lake proved unstable ground for tall masonry buildings. While that was an early constraint, builders developed the innovative use of steel framing for support and invented the skyscraper in Chicago, which became a leader in modern architecture and set the model nationwide for achieving vertical city densities.Daniel Bluestone, Constructing Chicago (1993) Developers and citizens began immediate reconstruction on the existing Jeffersonian grid. The building boom that followed saved the city's status as the transportation and trade hub of the Midwest. Massive reconstruction using the newest materials and methods catapulted Chicago into its status as a city on par with New York and became the birthplace of modern architecture in the United States.Harold M. Mayer, and Richard C. Wade. Chicago: Growth of a Metropolis (1969) Rise of industry and commerce 1893 Bird's eye view of Chicago The Home Insurance Building in Chicago, the world's first skyscraper. Chicago became the center of the nation's advertising industry after New York City. Albert Lasker, known as the \\"father of modern advertising,\\" made Chicago his base from 1898 to 1942. As head of the Lord and Thomas agency, Lasker devised a copywriting technique that appealed directly to the psychology of the consumer. Women, who seldom smoked cigarettes, were told that if they smoked Lucky Strikes, they could stay slender. Lasker's use of radio, particularly with his campaigns for Palmolive soap, Pepsodent toothpaste, Kotex products, and Lucky Strike cigarettes, not only revolutionized the advertising industry but also significantly changed popular culture.Arthur W. Schultz, \\"Albert Lasker's Advertising Revolution,\\" Chicago History, Nov 2002, Vol. 31#2 pp 36-53 Gambling In Chicago, like other rapidly growing industrial centers with large immigrant working-class neighborhoods, gambling was a major issue. The city's elite upper-class had private clubs and closely supervised horse racing tracks. The middle-class reformers focused on the workers, who discovered freedom and independence in gambling that was a world apart from their closely supervised factory jobs and gambled to validate risk-taking aspect of masculinity, betting heavily on dice, card games, policy, and cock fights. Already, by the 1850s, hundreds of saloons offered gambling opportunities, including off-track betting on the horses.See Christopher Thale, \\"Gambling\\" Encyclopedia of Chicago (2004)Richard C. Lindberg, Chicago by Gaslight: A History of Chicago's Netherworld: 1880-1920 (2005) excerpt Historian Mark Holler argues that organized crime provided upward mobility to ambitious ethnics. The high-income, high-visibility vice lords, and racketeers built their careers and profits in ghetto neighborhoods, often branching into local politics to protect their domains.Mark H. Haller, \\"Organized Crime in Urban Society: Chicago in the Twentieth Century\\" Journal of Social History (1971) 5#2 pp. 210-234 Online For example, in 1868‚Äì1888, Chicagoan Michael C. McDonald, \\"The Gambler King of Clark Street,\\" kept numerous Democratic machine politicians on expense account to protect his gambling empire and keep the goo-goo reformers at bay. In large cities, illegal businesses like gambling and prostitution were typically contained in the geographically segregated red light districts. The business owners made regularly scheduled payments to police and politicians, which they treated as a licensing expense. The informal rates became standardized. For example, in Chicago, they ranged from $20 a month for a cheap brothel to $1000 a month for luxurious operations in Chicago. Reform elements never accepted the segregated vice districts and wanted them all destroyed, but in large cities, the political machine was powerful enough to keep the reformers at bay. Finally, around 1900‚Äì1910, the reformers grew politically strong enough to shut down the system of vice segregation and the survivors went underground.Perry Duis, The Saloon: Public Drinking in Chicago and Boston, 1880-1920 (1983) pp 230-73. 20th century Chicago's manufacturing and retail sectors, fostered by the expansion of railroads throughout the upper Midwest and East, grew rapidly and came to dominate the Midwest and greatly influence the nation's economy. The Chicago Union Stock Yards dominated the packing trade. Chicago became the world's largest rail hub, and one of its busiest ports by shipping traffic on the Great Lakes. Commodity resources, such as lumber, iron and coal, were brought to Chicago and Ohio for processing, with products shipped both East and West to support new growth.William Cronon, Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West (1991) Merchants' Hotel on left, looking North from State and Washington Streets, before 1868 Lake Michigan -- the primary source of fresh water for the city -- became polluted from the rapidly growing industries in and around Chicago; a new way of procuring clean water was needed. In 1885 the civil engineer Lyman Edgar Cooley proposed the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. He envisioned a deep waterway that would dilute and divert the city's sewage by funneling water from Lake Michigan into a canal, which would drain into the Mississippi River via the Illinois River. Beyond presenting a solution for Chicago's sewage problem, Cooley's proposal appealed to the economic need to link the Midwest with America's central waterways to compete with East Coast shipping and railroad industries. Strong regional support for the project led the Illinois legislature to circumvent the federal government and complete the canal with state funding. The opening in January 1900 met with controversy and a lawsuit against Chicago's appropriation of water from Lake Michigan. By the 1920s the lawsuit was divided between the states of the Mississippi River Valley, who supported the development of deep waterways linking the Great Lakes with the Mississippi, and the Great Lakes states, which feared sinking water levels might harm shipping in the lakes. In 1929 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in support of Chicago's use of the canal to promote commerce, but ordered the city to discontinue its use for sewage disposal.Lorien Foote, \\"Bring the Sea to Us: the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal and the Industrialization of the Midwest, 1885-1929\\", Journal of Illinois History 1999 2(1): 39-56. ISSN 1522-0532 Birds-eye view of Chicago in 1916 New construction boomed in the 1920s, with notable landmarks such as the Merchandise Mart and art deco Chicago Board of Trade Building completed in 1930. The Wall Street Crash of 1929, the Great Depression and diversion of resources into World War II led to the suspension for years of new construction. The Century of Progress International Exposition was the name of the World's Fair held on the Near South Side lakefront from 1933 to 1934 to celebrate the city's centennial. The theme of the fair was technological innovation over the century since Chicago's founding. More than 40 million people visited the fair, which symbolized for many hope for Chicago and the nation, then in the midst of the Great Depression. Loop street scene in 1900; colorized photograph Politics in the late 19th and early 20th centuries During the election of April 23, 1875, the voters of Chicago chose to operate under the Illinois Cities and Villages Act of 1872. Chicago still operates under this act, in lieu of a charter. The Cities and Villages Act has been revised several times since, and may be found in Chapter 65 of the Illinois Compiled Statutes.

Late-19th-century big city newspapers such as the Chicago Daily News - founded in 1875 by Melville Stone - ushered in an era of news reporting that was, unlike earlier periods, in tune with the particulars of community life in specific cities. Vigorous competition between older and newer-style city papers soon broke out, centered on civic activism and sensationalist reporting of urban political issues and the numerous problems associated with rapid urban growth. Competition was especially fierce between the Chicago Times (Democratic), the Chicago Tribune (Republican), and the Daily News (independent), with the latter becoming the city's most popular paper by the 1880s.David Paul Nord, \\"Read All about It\\"\\" Chicago History 2002 31(1): 26-57. ISSN 0272-8540 The city's boasting lobbyists and politicians earned Chicago the nickname \\"Windy City\\" in the New York press. The city adopted the nickname as its own. Polarized attitudes of labor and business in Chicago prompted a strike by workers' lobbying for an eight-hour work day, later named the Haymarket affair. A peaceful demonstration on May 4, 1886, at Haymarket near the west side was interrupted by a bomb thrown at police; seven police officers were killed. Widespread violence broke out. A group of anarchists were tried for inciting the riot and convicted. Several were hanged and others were pardoned. The episode was a watershed moment in the labor movement, and its history was commemorated in the annual May Day celebrations. By 1900, Progressive Era political and legal reformers initiated far-ranging changes in the American criminal justice system, with Chicago taking the lead. The city became notorious worldwide for its rate of murders in the early 20th century, yet the courts failed to convict the killers. More than three-fourths of cases were not closed. Even when the police made arrests in cases where killers' identities were known, jurors typically exonerated or acquitted them. A blend of gender-, race-, and class-based notions of justice trumped the rule of law, producing low homicide conviction rates during a period of soaring violence.Jeffrey S. Adler, \\"'It Is His First Offense. We Might as Well Let Him Go': Homicide and Criminal Justice in Chicago, 1875-1920.\\" Journal of Social History 2006 40(1): 5-24. ISSN 0022-4529 Fulltext: History Cooperative and Project Muse During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, rates of domestic murder tripled in Chicago. Domestic homicide was often a manifestation of strains in gender relations induced by urban and industrial change. At the core of such family murders were male attempts to preserve masculine authority. Yet, there were nuances in the motives for the murder of family members, and study of the patterns of domestic homicide among different ethnic groups reveals basic cultural differences. German male immigrants tended to murder over declining status and the failure to achieve economic prosperity. In addition, they were likely to kill all members of the family, and then commit suicide in the ultimate attempt at maintaining control. Italian men killed family members to save a gender-based ideal of respectability that entailed patriarchal control over women and family reputation. African American men, like the Germans, often murdered in response to economic conditions but not over desperation about the future. Like the Italians, the killers tended to be young, but family honor was not usually at stake. Instead, black men murdered to regain control of wives and lovers who resisted their patriarchal \\"rights\\".Adler, \\"We've Got a Right to Fight; We're Married\\": Domestic Homicide in Chicago, 1875‚Äì1920, 2003 Progressive reformers in the business community created the Chicago Crime Commission (CCC) in 1919 after an investigation into a robbery at a factory showed the city's criminal justice system was deficient. The CCC initially served as a watchdog of the justice system. After its suggestion that the city's justice system begin collecting criminal records was rejected, the CCC assumed a more active role in fighting crime. The commission's role expanded further after Frank J. Loesch became president in 1928. Loesch recognized the need to eliminate the glamor that Chicago's media typically attributed to criminals. Determined to expose the violence of the crime world, Loesch drafted a list of \\"public enemies\\"; among them was Al Capone, whom he made a scapegoat for widespread social problems.Bill Barnhart, \\"Public Enemies: Chicago Origins of Personalized Anticrime Campaigns\\", Journal of Illinois History 2001 4(4): 258-270. ISSN 1522-0532 After the passage of Prohibition, the 1920s brought international notoriety to Chicago. Bootleggers and smugglers bringing in liquor from Canada formed powerful gangs. They competed with each other for lucrative profits, and to evade the police, to bring liquor to speakeasies and private clients. The most notorious was Al Capone. Immigration and migration in the 20th century State Street circa 1907 International Ballooning Contest, Aero Park, Chicago, July 4, 1908 Birds eye view of Chicago in 1938 From 1890 to 1914, migrations swelled, attracting to the city of mostly unskilled Catholic and Jewish immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, including Italians, Greeks, Czechs, Poles, Lithuanians, Ukrainians, Hungarians, and Slovaks. World War I cut off immigration from Europe, which brought hundreds of thousands of southern blacks and whites into Northern cities to fill in the labor shortages. The Immigration Act of 1924 restricted populations from southern and eastern Europe, apart from refugees after World War II. The heavy annual turnover of ethnic populations ended, and the groups stabilized, each favoring specific neighborhoods.Melvin G. Holli and Peter d‚ÄôA. Jones, eds. Ethnic Chicago: A Multicultural Portrait (4th ed. 1995). While whites from rural areas arrived and generally settled in the suburban parts of the city, large numbers of blacks from the South arrived as well.Hana Layson with Kenneth Warren, \\"Chicago and the Great Migration, 1915‚Äì1950\\" online From the Newberry Library The near South Side of the city became the first Black residential area, as it had the oldest, less expensive housing. Although restricted by segregation and competing ethnic groups such as the Irish, gradually continued black migration caused this community to expand, as well as the black neighborhoods on the near West Side. These were de facto segregated areas (few blacks were tolerated in ethnic white neighborhoods); the Irish and ethnic groups who had been longer in the city began to move to outer areas and the suburbs. After World War II, the city built public housing for working-class families to upgrade residential quality. The high-rise design of such public housing proved a problem when industrial jobs left the city and poor families became concentrated in the facilities. After 1950, public housing high rises anchored poor black neighborhoods south and west of the Loop. \\"Old stock\\" Americans who relocated to Chicago after 1900 preferred the outlying areas and suburbs, with their commutes eased by train lines, making Oak Park and Evanston enclaves of the upper middle class. In the 1910s, high-rise luxury apartments were constructed along the lakefront north of the Loop, continuing into the 21st century. They attracted wealthy residents but few families with children, as wealthier families moved to suburbs for the schools. There were problems in the public school system; mostly Catholic students attended schools in the large parochial system, which was of middling quality.James W. Sanders, The education of an urban minority: Catholics in Chicago, 1833-1965 (Oxford University Press, 1977). There were a few private schools. The Latin School, Francis Parker and later The Bateman School, all centrally located served those who could afford to pay. The northern and western suburbs developed some of the best public schools in the nation, which were strongly supported by their wealthier residents. The suburban trend accelerated after 1945, with the construction of highways and train lines that made commuting easier. Middle-class Chicagoans headed to the outlying areas of the city, and then into the Cook County and Dupage County suburbs. As ethnic Jews and Irish rose in economic class, they left the city and headed north. Well-educated migrants from around the country moved to the far suburbs. Chicago's Polonia sustained diverse political cultures in the early twentieth century, each with its own newspaper. In 1920 the community had a choice of five daily papers ‚Äì from the Socialist Dziennik Ludowy (People's Daily; 1907‚Äì1925) to the Polish Roman Catholic Union's Dziennik Zjednoczenia (Union Daily; 1921‚Äì1939). The decision to subscribe to a particular paper reaffirmed a particular ideology or institutional network based on ethnicity and class, which lent itself to different alliances and different strategies.Jon Bekken, \\"Negotiating Class and Ethnicity: the Polish-language Press in Chicago\\", Polish American Studies 2000 57(2): 5-29. ISSN 0032-2806. Oak Street Beach, 1925 As the First World War cut off immigration, tens of thousands of African Americans came north in the Great Migration out of the rural South. With new populations competing for limited housing and jobs, especially on the South Side, social tensions rose in the city. Postwar years were more difficult. Black veterans looked for more respect for having served their nation, and some whites resented it. In 1919, the Chicago race riot erupted, in what became known as \\"Red Summer\\", when other major cities also suffered mass racial violence based in competition for jobs and housing as the country tried to absorb veterans in the postwar years. During the riot, thirty-eight people died (23 black and 15 white) and over five hundred were injured. Much of the violence against blacks in Chicago was led by members of ethnic Irish athletic clubs, who had much political power in the city and defended their \\"territory\\" against African Americans. As was typical in these occurrences, more blacks than whites died in the violence. Concentrating the family resources to achieve home ownership was a common strategy in the ethnic European neighborhoods. It meant sacrificing current consumption, and pulling children out of school as soon as they could earn a wage. By 1900, working-class ethnic immigrants owned homes at higher rates than native-born people. After borrowing from friends and building associations, immigrants kept boarders, grew market gardens, and opened home- based commercial laundries, eroding home-work distinctions, while sending out women and children to work to repay loans. They sought not middle-class upward mobility but the security of home ownership. Many social workers wanted them to pursue upward job mobility (which required more education), but realtors asserted that houses were better than a bank for a poor man. With hindsight, and considering uninsured banks' precariousness, this appears to have been true. Chicago's workers made immense sacrifices for home ownership, contributing to Chicago's sprawling suburban geography and to modern myths about the American dream. The Jewish community, by contrast, rented apartments and maximized education and upward mobility for the next generation.Elaine Lewinnek, \\"Better than a Bank for a Poor Man? Home Financing Strategies in Early Chicago.\\" Journal of Urban History 2006 32(2): 274-301. ISSN 0096-1442 Fulltext: Sage; see also Joseph C. Bigott, From Cottage to Bungalow: Houses and the Working Classes in Metropolitan Chicago, 1869-1929 (2001) excerpt and text search Beginning in the 1940s, waves of Hispanic immigrants began to arrive. The largest numbers were from Mexico and Puerto Rico, as well as Cuba during Fidel Castro's rise. During the 1980s, Hispanic immigrants were more likely to be from Central and South America. After 1965 and the change in US immigration laws, numerous Asian immigrants came; the largest proportion were well-educated Indians and Chinese, who generally settled directly in the suburbs. By the 1970s gentrification began in the city, in some cases with people renovating housing in old inner city neighborhoods, and attracting singles and gay people. Labor unions Chicago skyline from Northerly Island Taken sometime in 1941 After 1900 Chicago was a heavily unionized city, apart from the factories (which were non-union until the 1930s). The IWW was founded in Chicago in June 1905 at a convention of 200 socialists, anarchists, and radical trade unionists from all over the United States. The Railroad brotherhoods were strong, as were the crafts unions affiliated with the American Federation of Labor. The AFL unions operated through the Chicago Federation of Labor to minimize jurisdictional conflicts, which caused many strikes as two unions battled to control a work site. The unionized teamsters in Chicago enjoyed an unusually strong bargaining position when they contended with employers around the city, or supported another union in a specific strike. Their wagons could easily be positioned to disrupt streetcars and block traffic. In addition, their families and neighborhood supporters often surrounded and attacked the wagons of nonunion teamsters who were strikebreaking. When the teamsters used their clout to engage in sympathy strikes, employers decided to coordinate their antiunion efforts, claiming that the teamsters held too much power over commerce in their control of the streets. The teamsters' strike in 1905 represented a clash both over labor issues and the public nature of the streets. To the employers, the streets were arteries for commerce, while to the teamsters, they remained public spaces integral to their neighborhoods.David Witwer, \\"Unionized Teamsters and the Struggle over the Streets of the Early-Twentieth-century City\\", Social Science History 2000 24(1): 183-222. ISSN 0145-5532 Fulltext: Project Muse World War II On December 2, 1942, the world's first controlled nuclear reaction was conducted at the University of Chicago as part of the top secret Manhattan Project. During World War II, the steel mills in the city of Chicago alone accounted for 20% of all steel production in the United States and 10% of global production. The city produced more steel than the United Kingdom during the war, and surpassed Nazi Germany's output in 1943 (after barely missing in 1942). The city's diversified industrial base made it second only to Detroit in the value‚Äî$24 billion‚Äîof war goods produced. Over 1,400 companies produced everything from field rations to parachutes to torpedoes, while new aircraft plants employed 100,000 in the construction of engines, aluminum sheeting, bombsights, and other components. The Great Migration, which had been on pause due to the Depression, resumed at an even faster pace as the 1910 - 1930 period, as hundreds of thousands of black Americans arrived in the city to work in the steel mills, railroads, and shipping yards. Post World War II House in Chicago's inner city, 1974. Photo by Danny Lyon. Returning World War II veterans and immigrants from Europe (in particular Displaced Persons from Eastern Europe) created a postwar economic boom and led to the development of huge housing tracts on Chicago's Northwest and Southwest Sides. The city was extensively photographed during the post‚Äìwar years by street photographers such as Richard Nickel and Vivian Maier. Picasso sculpture in Chicago, Illinois‚Äîthe sculptor refused to be paid the $100,000 fee due him and donated it to the people of Chicago Starting in the 1950s, in the postwar desire for new and improved housing, aided by new highways and commuter train lines, many middle and higher income Americans began moving from the inner-city of Chicago to the suburbs. Changes in industry after 1950, with restructuring of the stockyards and steel industries, led to massive job losses in the city for working-class people. The city population shrank by nearly 700,000. The City Council devised \\"Plan 21\\" to improve neighborhoods and focused on creating \\"Suburbs within the city\\" near downtown and the lakefront. It built public housing to try to improve housing standards in the city. As a result, many poor were uprooted from newly created enclaves of Black, Latino and poor in neighborhoods such as Near North, Wicker Park, Lakeview, Uptown, Cabrini‚ÄìGreen, West Town and Lincoln Park. The passage of civil rights laws in the 1960s also affected Chicago and other northern cities. In the 1960s and 1970s, many middle and upper income Americans continued to move from the city for better housing and schools in the suburbs. Office building resumed in the 1960s. When completed in 1974, the Sears Tower, now known as the Willis Tower, at 1451 feet was the world's tallest building. It was designed by the famous Chicago firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, which designed many of the city's famous buildings. Politics in the 20th and 21st centuries In the early 20th century, the Chicago Traction Wars were a dominant controversy in Chicago politics. Mayor Richard J. Daley served 1955‚Äì1976, dominating the city's machine politics by his control of the Cook County Democratic Central Committee, which selected party nominees, who were usually elected in the Democratic stronghold. Daley took credit for building four major expressways focused on the Loop, and city-owned O'Hare Airport (which became the world's busiest airport, displacing Midway Airport's prior claims). Several neighborhoods near downtown and the lakefront were gentrified and transformed into \\"suburbs within the city\\". He held office during the unrest of the 1960s, some of which was provoked by the police department's discriminatory practices. In the Lincoln Park, Lakeview, Wicker Park and Humboldt Park communities, the Young Lords under the leadership of Jose Cha Cha Jimenez marched and held sit ins to protest the displacement of Latinos and the poor. After the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, major riots of despair resulted in the burning down of sections of the black neighborhoods of the South and West sides. Protests against the Vietnam War at the 1968 Democratic National Convention, held in Chicago, resulted in street violence, with televised broadcasts of the Chicago police's beating of unarmed protesters. In 1979, Jane Byrne, the city's first woman mayor, was elected, winning the Democratic primary due to a citywide outrage about the ineffective snow removal across the city. In 1983, Harold Washington became the first black mayor of Chicago. Richard M. Daley, son of Richard J. Daley, became mayor in 1989, and was repeatedly reelected until he declined to seek re- election in 2011. He sparked debate by demolishing many of the city's vast public housing projects, which had deteriorated and were holding too may poor and dysfunctional families. Concepts for new affordable and public housing have changed to include many new features to make them more viable: smaller scale, environmental designs for public safety, mixed-rate housing, etc. New projects during Daley's administration have been designed to be environmentally sound, more accessible and better for their occupants. In 2011, Rahm Emanuel was elected mayor of Chicago. Since the 1990s, Chicago has seen a turnaround with many revitalized inner city neighborhoods. The city's diversity has grown with new immigrants, with larger percentages of ethnic groups such as Asians, Mexicans and Puerto Ricans. In the 1990s, Chicago gained 113,000 new inhabitants. Since the 1920s, the lakefront has been lined with high-rise apartment buildings for middle classes who work in the city. Chicago earned the title of \\"City of the Year\\" in 2008 from GQ for contributions in architecture and literature, its world of politics, and the downtown's starring role in the Batman movie The Dark Knight. The city was rated by Moody's as having the most balanced economy in the United States due to its high level of diversification. Accessed from World Business Chicago. Flag Four historical events are commemorated by the four red stars on Chicago's flag: The United States' Fort Dearborn, established at the mouth of the Chicago River in 1803; the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, which destroyed much of the city; the World Columbian Exposition of 1893, by which Chicago celebrated its recovery from the fire; and the Century of Progress World's Fair of 1933‚Äì1934, which celebrated the city's centennial. The flag's two blue stripes symbolize the north and south branches of the Chicago River, which flows through the city's downtown. The three white stripes represent the North, West and South sides of the city, Lake Michigan being the east side. Major disasters The most famous and serious disaster was the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. On December 30, 1903, the \\"absolutely fireproof\\", five-week-old Iroquois Theater was engulfed by fire. The fire lasted less than thirty minutes; 602 people died as a result of being burned, asphyxiated, or trampled.Anthony P. Hatch, \\"Inferno at the Iroquois.\\" Chicago History 2003 32(2): 4‚Äì31. ISSN 0272-8540 The S.S. Eastland was a cruise ship based in Chicago and used for tours. On 24 July 1915‚Äîa calm, sunny day‚Äîthe ship was taking on passengers when it rolled over while tied to a dock in the Chicago River. A total of 844 passengers and crew were killed. An investigation found that the Eastland had become too heavy with rescue gear that had been ordered by Congress in the wake of the Titanic disaster.George Hilton, Eastland: Legacy of the Titanic (1997) On December 1, 1958, the Our Lady of the Angels School Fire occurred in the Humboldt Park area. The fire killed 92 students and three nuns; in response, fire safety improvements were made to public and private schools across the United States.David Cowan and John Kuenster, To Sleep with the Angels: The Story of a Fire (1996) excerpt April 13, 1992, billions of dollars in damage was caused by the Chicago Flood, when a hole was accidentally drilled into the long-abandoned (and mostly forgotten) Chicago Tunnel system, which was still connected to the basements of numerous buildings in the Loop.

It is served by an MBTA Commuter Rail line, several MBTA bus lines and the MBTA Orange Line in nearby Jamaica Plain. Roslindale has its own branch of the Boston Public Library, the neighborhood is covered by Boston Police District E-5 in West Roxbury, Boston EMS Ambulance 17 is stationed in Roslindale, and the Boston Fire Department has a station on Canterbury Street which houses Ladder 16, Engine 53 & District Chief 12. Roslindale's original Engine Company 45, was deactivated on April 10, 1981, due to budget cuts. The portion of the Arnold Arboretum south of Bussey Street is located in Roslindale. Six miles south- southwest of downtown Boston, Roslindale was originally part of the town of Roxbury. In 1851, current day Jamaica Plain, Roslindale and West Roxbury seceded from Roxbury. The area voted in 1873 to be annexed to the City of Boston. In the 1860s, the area was called South Street Crossing, due to the railroad's intersection with South Street. However, when the community applied for a post office district of its own, the name \\"South Street Crossing\\" proved to be unacceptable to the government. The name Roslindale was suggested by John Pierce, a well-traveled member of the community, who told the assembled citizens that the area reminded him of the historic town of Roslin, Scotland, outside Edinburgh. Pierce thought the area was like a dale because of the hills surrounding it. Thus the combination of \\"Roslin\\" and \\"dale\\" was submitted to the United States Postal Service and the name Roslindale was formally established.Anthony Mitchell Sammarco (1997). Images of America ‚Äî Roslindale. Arcadia Publishing. . Roslindale grew residentially as a classic streetcar suburb. The railway was built after the American Civil War, and spawned a new round of commercial development. Roslindale saw steady growth in its residential population, beginning in the 1880s, with the introduction of the horse-drawn street railway service between Forest Hills and Dedham. On March 14, 1887, a Boston & Providence Railroad train consisting of a locomotive and nine passenger cars inbound from Dedham to Boston with over 200 passengers, was passing over a bridge at Bussey Street, in the current Arnold Arboretum, when the bridge collapsed causing the rear five cars to pile up on top of each other, killing twenty-three and injuring over one hundred. This is considered one of the first major rail catastrophes in the country, and contributed to the widespread inspection of train bridges across the U.S. In the 1920s, Roslindale Village assumed the configuration it has today, with tree-lined Adams Park at its center. Roslindale falls in a crease between several other Boston neighborhoods and the parts of Roslindale adjacent to these surrounding neighborhoods take on the characteristics of those neighborhoods. For example, the western part of Roslindale blends seamlessly with West Roxbury's one and two family residences and tree lined streets; and Roslindale's northern area consists of dense two and three family residences amidst light industrial buildings similar to the adjacent Stony Brook corridor in Jamaica Plain. Prior to the rise of suburban shopping malls in the 1970s, the Roslindale business district, Roslindale Square, was a major shopping district for the city of Boston, with department stores, showrooms, food markets, and a movie theatre. After suffering years of vacant storefronts and increased vandalism during the 1970s, 1980s & 1990s Roslindale Square enjoys limited success today as a local shopping district. Roslindale is a diverse neighborhood‚Äîaccording to the 2010 census, the racial makeup of its inhabitants was 49% Non-Hispanic White, 18% Non-Hispanic Black or African- American, 25% Hispanic or Latino and 3% Asian or Pacific Islander.

Greye and programmed by Malcolm Evans in 1981 for the Sinclair ZX81 platform with the 16 KB memory expansion. The game was initially released by J. K. Greye Software in early 1982 and re-released later the same year by Evans' own startup, New Generation Software. Rendered using low-resolution character block \\"graphics\\", it was one of the first 3D games for a home computer, A look at Sir Clive Sinclair's computers. and one of the first games incorporating typical elements of the genre that would later be termed survival horror. 3D Monster Maze puts the player in a maze with one exit and a hostile monster, the Tyrannosaurus rex. There, the player must traverse the maze, from the first- person perspective, and escape through the exit without being eaten. J.K.Greye Software went on to become a very successful games company publishing 6 Game Tapes for the Sinclair ZX81 - 2 in 3D - 3D Monster Maze & 3D Defender, both designed by J.K.Greye and programmed by Malcolm Evans. New Generation Software went on to become a well-known software firm with the Sinclair platform and continued to pioneer the 3D gaming technology for ZX81 and the later model Sinclair ZX Spectrum. The press immediately gave the game a title of a \\"firm favourite\\" of the ZX81 users. Decades later, it became popular with the retrogaming community, inspiring remakes and fuelling ZX81 emulation projects. A ZX81 emulator packaged with 3D Monster Maze and other famous games; licensed under the GPL (but written in Visual Basic). Usable for playing and viewing the BASIC portion of the game on the Microsoft Windows. Gameplay The game uses an 18-by-16 cell maze which is randomly generated. Reply from Malcolm Evans describing maze generation. Initially the T. rex lies in wait. Once the player starts moving, the beast begins hunting. Thereafter, the T. rex may either calm down (if the player goes into a part of the maze that is far enough away), or become more active as the player comes closer. If the T. rex gets a direct view of its prey, the monster will run directly at the player. The T. rex anxiety level, reported to the player as a statement in the status line, provides an indirect clue to the player's relative distance from the monster. These statements are: REX LIES IN WAIT, followed by HE IS HUNTING FOR YOU, FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING, REX HAS SEEN YOU, and RUN HE IS BESIDE YOU or RUN HE IS BEHIND YOU. The player's speed is greater than the monster's, thus it is possible to escape by running (unless the player is trapped in a dead end). Scan of 3D Monster Maze instructions. The player can manually map the maze on a piece of paper with each step, but this becomes increasingly difficult as the pace increases. The fast pace can also lead to hard keyboard presses, which, in turn, can shake the computer/16K memory expansion connection, and lead to a sudden reset with several minutes worth reload time. A look at Sir Clive Sinclair's computers. Points are awarded for each step made by the player any time the dinosaur is on an active hunt. Since the player runs faster than the monster, it is possible to accumulate points by running around in circles with the monster just a few steps behind. Points are also given upon successfully getting away through an exit and into another maze. Screenshot from the introduction of 3D Monster Maze with the opening of the game legend scrolling by. When the game ends, the player is informed about being \\"sentenced to roam the maze forever\\", and then can either \\"appeal\\" or continue playing again in the last maze. If the appeal is attempted, it is rejected with 50% probability, in which case the player is sent back to roam the previous maze again. An appeal which is accepted effectively results in the computer self-reset via BASIC's \`NEW\` statement. Development Malcolm Evans 3D Monster Maze was the first game programmed by Malcolm Evans based on a design by J.K.Greye. Featuring Malcolm Evans following the Trashman hit game. He worked in the aerospace industry, first in aircraft design, and then as a microprocessor scientist at Sperry Gyroscope at Bristol, United Kingdom. He received a ZX81 from his wife for his thirty-seventh birthday in April 1981\\\\. Malcolm developed basic aspects of the game to test what the computer was capable of, and completed it after adding design features suggested by J.K.Greye, including adding the T.Rex and turning the Maze into a game. Friends persuaded Malcolm that the game was of high enough quality to sell and it was eventually released by J.K. Greye Software in February 1982. An article about New Generation Software, the firm that was started with the 3D Monster Maze development. When soon after that the Bristol branch of Sperry Gyroscope closed, Malcolm made a decision to concentrate fully on computer gaming. The firm New Generation Software he had founded kept producing 3D games for the Sinclair Research computers, and became synonymous with 3D gaming on this platform for some time. Discussion of the 3D gaming scene on the Sinclair computers, naturally opened by 3D Monster Maze. Some of his games were hailed by the gaming scene, but some titles occasionally drew criticism from reviewers for their fancy graphics but poor game plot. After releasing 3D Defender and Breakout for the ZX81, Games by Malcolm Evans published by J.K. Greye Software. Malcolm switched the development efforts from ZX81 to ZX Spectrum as the latter model hit the market. In addition to republishing the 3D Monster Maze, the new firm also released such game titles as Escape, 3D Tunnel, Knot in 3D, Corridors of Genon, Trashman and Travel with Trashman, Light Magic, Jonah Barrington's Squash, The Custard Kid and Cliff Hanger. Reception Teeth fill the screen as the player is eaten. The game was sold domestically in the UK and overseas, and became a hit shortly after it was released: Contemporary reviews described it as \\"the best game I have seen for the Sinclair ZX81\\" and \\"Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant! Straight away this gets into my personal top ten ZX Programs ... Undoubtedly one of the best ZX programs available.\\". Even though it did not use the undocumented hi-res graphics feature of the ZX81, and rendered the scene with pseudo-graphics characters (available in the standard ZX81 character set), the game was considered to be a remarkable achievement, utilising the machine's capabilities to its best: Soon the Sinclair platform users began switching over to the newer ZX Spectrum, which had better graphics resolution and colour, bigger RAM and ROM, as well as sound capability and a sleeker look and feel. Some people still continued to use their ZX81, and even the Spectrum users gave credit to 3D Monster Maze as the game that brought the 3D aspect into the home computer gaming: Monster Maze's praises brought recognition to Malcolm Evans and his firm, New Generation Software, which continued releasing further games that further improved the 3D gaming experience. Even when later hit games by N.G.S., such as Trashman, were covered by the gaming media reviews, 3D Monster Maze was remembered as the landmark impressive start: Edge in 2006 stated that 3D Monster Maze \\"is the original survival horror game\\", writing \\"Ask any player and they'll tell you what 3D Monster Maze was chiefly about: fear, panic, terror and facing an implacable, relentless foe who's going to get you in the end.\\" Retro Gamer agreed, in 2014 stating that \\"Survival horror may have been a phrase first coined by Resident Evil, but it could've easily applied to Malcolm Evans' massive hit.\\" With ZX81 games played mostly in emulated environments by the retrogaming community, it still fetches enthusiastic reviews, even while modern high-end gaming consoles and home computers provide much richer capabilities for one's immersion into a first- person 3D game: Technology pseudo-graphics characters used as the building blocks of the 3D picture. The graphical view, animated in real time at around 6 frames per second, is composed of 8√ó8 pixel black-and-white characters, so the view is roughly square, taking a 25√ó24 area on the 32√ó24 text screen. Sub-character resolution of the ZX81 pseudo-graphics character set makes the resolution doubled in each dimension (making the view consist of 50√ó48 \\"larger pixels\\"). Using the 6 pseudo-graphics with a dithering pattern also made it possible for the game author to incorporate a third colour (grey) in the black-and-white picture. Part of the screen is reserved for the score count, and a one-line status message is occasionally overlaid at the bottom of the graphical view. The player always runs along the corridor's centreline, and looks in the current direction only, which simplifies the rendering task. Screenshot from 3D Monster Maze. The monster, a Tyrannosaurus rex, is two steps away. The game's 3D engine and the random maze creation code is written in Z80 machine code, produced with an assembler. This is augmented by several dozen BASIC lines for less critical tasks, such as the initial greetings and the game legend animation inter-line delay. The machine code subroutines block is embedded into the BASIC line 0, beginning with a \`REM\` (BASIC comment) statement, making the interpreter step over it. If, by accident, one tries to edit the line via the BASIC line editor, the changes will not be accepted since 0 is an invalid line number. Such code is typically created by first creating a line with a valid number, and then modifying the number field in the BASIC program area using direct memory manipulation, such as \`POKE\`. An article describing how LINE 0 works on Sinclair computers. No copy protection is embedded into the game; moreover, the magnetic tapes of the time being unreliable, one could reuse the save entry point in the BASIC code (that was used by the original developers to have the game auto-run upon being loaded by the user) in order to save another program copy to the tape (for archival/backup purposes). The game is controlled by three of the keyboard cursor control keys (left, forward and right, respectively 5, 7 and 8 on the ZX81 keyboard). The game speed can also be controlled ‚Äî according to the original cassette inlay, the BASIC line 370 has a hardwired constant determining a busy waiting loop delay. The constant initially is set to 5; by varying it from 0 to 9 the game can be adjusted from faster to slower tempo. The 6 frame/s figure corresponds to the delay set to zero, while holding the \\"forward\\" key to run straight. A somewhat jerky motion is perceived at this slow framerate which gives a feeling of being jerked along with each step of a desperate heavy run.

Life Yang Xiu was the son of Yang Biao (Ê•äÂΩ™) and a grandson of Yang Ci (Ê•äË≥ú). His mother, Lady Yuan (Ë¢ÅÊ∞è), was Yuan Shu's sister. Sometime during the 200s, Yang Xiu was nominated as xiaolian and became a Registrar (‰∏ªÁ∞ø) under Cao Cao, the Imperial Chancellor. He was said to have been skilled in both civil and military affairs and understood Cao Cao well. Because of this, Yang Xiu became an influential figure in the government. Yang Xiu was a close friend of Cao Cao's son, Cao Zhi, and became involved in the succession struggle between Cao Zhi and his brother Cao Pi. Yang Xiu's close links with Cao Zhi caused him misfortune during Cao Zhi's occasional misbehaviour such as the incident in Ye city, where Cao Zhi drunkenly rode through the gate reserved for only the emperor. But the final blow was when Yang Xiu was discovered to have leaked the council's discussion agenda to Cao Zhi so that his friend could prepare beforehand and impress Cao Cao. Because of this and remembering his connection with Yuan Shu, Cao Cao had Yang Xiu executed. Prior to Yang Xiu's death, Cao Cao had written a letter to his father Yang Biao, reproaching him for his son's arrogance. After news of his execution, Yang Biao was struck by grief and self-blame, becoming gray-haired and thin. Upon hearing this, Cao Cao sent Yang Biao many gifts to compensate for the loss of his son. Anecdotes In Romance of the Three Kingdoms In the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Cao Cao thinks that Yang Xiu is too boastful and overconfident in his cleverness, and eventually kills him after what is known as the \\"chicken rib\\" incident. (When Cao Cao's army was at Hanzhong, preparing for battle, Cao Cao was brought some soup with chicken ribs in it and thoughtlessly muttered the word \\"chicken rib\\" a few times. Yang Xiu immediately thought he knew what Cao Cao implied: he explained that \\"chicken rib\\" is a metaphor for \\"retreat\\" and told all generals to make the soldiers pack their bags and get ready to retreat. When Cao Cao was alerted that Yang Xiu had given a false camp-wide signal, he was immensely angered and executed Yang Xiu.) In an earlier chapter, Yang Xiu was described by Mi Heng as one of the two sole \\"talented\\" officials under Cao Cao (the other being Kong Rong). This however should be taken with a grain of salt, as Mi Heng's expressed opinions on other characters, as well as his own actions and the disaster that befell him because of them, make him appear as a poor judge of character.

It deals with the effects of domestic violence (which King had touched upon before in the novels It, Insomnia, Dolores Claiborne, Needful Things, and many others) and, unusually for a King novel, relies for its fantastic element on Greek mythology. In his memoir, On Writing, King states that Rose Madder and Insomnia are \\"stiff, trying-too-hard novels.\\" Plot In 1985, Rose Daniels' husband, Norman, beats her while she is four months pregnant, causing her to miscarry. Rose considers leaving Norman but dismisses the idea: Norman is a policeman, and is excellent at finding people. He also has a violent temper and has been recently accused of assaulting and raping a black woman named Wendy Yarrow. The subsequent lawsuit and internal affairs investigation has made him even more volatile. Nine years later, Rose is making the bed. She sees a drop of blood on the sheet that dripped from her nose the night before, when Norman had punched her in the face for spilling iced tea on him. Rose realizes that she has passively suffered through Norman's abuse for fourteen years and that if she continues to put up with it, he will eventually kill her. Rose departs on a bus with their bank card. Once Norman realizes that Rose is gone, he resolves to hunt her down and kill her. Rose arrives in a Midwestern city, disoriented and afraid. At the bus station, she meets a man named Peter Slowik, who guides her to a local women's shelter. She quickly makes several friends and, with the help of shelter director Anna Stevenson, gets an apartment and a job as a hotel housekeeper. When Rose tries to pawn her engagement ring, she takes a liking to a painting of a woman in a rose madder gown. She trades her ring for the painting, which has no signature. Bill Steiner, the owner of the pawnshop, asks her for a date. Rose falls in love with him, but she is afraid to begin a new relationship. Rose discovers that the painting seems to change from time to time. Eventually she is able to travel through it. On the other side, she encounters a woman called Dorcas, who resembles Wendy Yarrow. She also sees the woman in the painting, whom she calls \\"Rose Madder\\" because of her gown and her evident madness. Rose Madder asks Rose to rescue her baby from an underground labyrinth inhabited by a blind, one-eyed bull called Erinyes who orients by his sense of smell. Dorcas leads Rose to the edge of the temple grounds. Dorcas cannot enter the labyrinth, as she is afflicted by the same mysterious illness as her mistress, and Erinyes would be able to smell her. Before Rose parts from Dorcas, she is made to strip naked and rip her nightgown into several strips. One is soaked in Dorcas' blood and tied around a rock. Rose enters the temple, where she manages to save the child, escape Erinyes, and return the baby girl to Rose Madder, who promises to repay her. Rose returns to her world and puts the strange incident at the back of her mind. Norman arrives in the city, attacks some of Rose's friends from the shelter, and then goes to Rose's apartment. He kills a policemen assigned to protect her, poses as one of them in the patrol car, and sees Rose and Bill returning from the police station. He attacks them, almost strangling Bill, but Rose is able to fight him off because she believes she is wearing the golden arm circlet Rose Madder had given her. After injuring Norman, Rose carries Bill to the apartment, where she sees the circlet on her table and realizes she has been fighting Norman alone the whole time. Rose tricks Norman into following her into the painting, then leads him to Rose Madder, who kills him. Rose returns to her world with instructions from Rose Madder to \\"remember the tree\\". She eventually marries Bill and has a daughter, but finds that the violent rages that characterized both Norman and Rose Madder have begun to spring up within her. She remembers that Rose Madder allowed her to take some seeds home with her, which she plants along with Norman's police ring in a secret grove by her favorite lake. The seed grows into a beautiful but deadly tree. She revisits the tree periodically as it grows, and is able to release her rage and go on with her life. Adaptations A film adaptation of Rose Madder was in development in 2011, but the project fell apart. There was an audiobook made narrated by Blair Brown.

It is located at the southwestern end of Lake Iseo. Territory The town of Paratico is part of the hilly area called Franciacorta. History Paratico lies at Franciacorta's extreme western border, in a splendid position overlooking Lake Iseo. The place name had already made its appearance in the year 975, when the Longobard Erberto donated to his nephew Rotepaldo some of his properties, among which, Paratico. Its past strategic importance is attested by the impressive ruins of the powerful castello Lantieri, located on a hill top and commanding a view all over the surrounding landscape. The castle was probably built in the 13th century, perhaps on the foundations of an older castle, dating back to 1007. It rises on a solitary place, ideal to control the outlet of the Oglio river from Lake Iseo, and to survey the roads leading to the plain and to Bergamo. The Lantieri family, in the 15th century, had already spread into several branches; they sided with the Ghibellines, and owned many properties, both in Paratico and Torbiato, including some stone quarries. According to the \\"Chronicle of the Lantieri de Paratico family\\", written in 1600, Dante Alighieri stayed at the castle in 1311. Here, the poet would have drawn his inspiration to conceive Purgatory's structure and to compose some of his lyrics. In Vanzago, on the old road to Capriolo, there was a 13th-century castle, subsequently transformed into a convent and then, in 1850, into a hospital. Today it has become a farm. In the locality of S. Pietro rises the church of that name, dating back to 1730; on 8 December, every year, it is the scene of a traditional festival dedicated to the \\"Madonna of the Apples\\" (the legend says that the man used to offer an apple to his lady, in token of his love). The parish church dates back to the 15th century. Previous to the construction of S. Peter's cemetery, corpses were buried around this church; it was enlarged and renovated in 1724 and furtherly improved in 1878. Some interesting works are preserved in its interior, such as the polychrome inlaid high altar and the splendid Rosary kaltar, with marble marquetry. Fusia's water mill and irrigation ditch represent a complex medieval achievement of hydraulic engineering; they favoured the development of commercial and market activities in Paratico. The surrounding hills offer some enchanting vistas. The sandstone called \\"Sarnico's stone\\" is still quarried from these hills; it was much used for construction in past centuries. The splendid position between the lake and the hills, and its good hotel facilities, make Paratico one of the favourite tourist spots of the whole territory.

It is involved in bacterial cell wall biosynthesis, namely, the transpeptidation that crosslinks the peptide side chains of peptidoglycan strands. The antibiotic penicillin irreversibly binds to and inhibits the activity of the transpeptidase enzyme by forming a highly stable penicilloyl-enzyme intermediate. Because of the interaction between penicillin and transpeptidase, this enzyme is also known as penicillin-binding protein (PBP).  Mechanism  DD-transpeptidase is mechanistically similar to the proteolytic reactions of the trypsin protein family. DD-transpeptidase catalytic mechanism Crosslinking of peptidyl moieties of adjacent glycan strands is a two-step reaction. The first step involves the cleavage of the D-alanyl-D-alanine bond of a peptide unit precursor acting as carbonyl donor, the release of the carboxyl-terminal D-alanine, and the formation of the acyl- enzyme. The second step involves the breakdown of the acyl-enzyme intermediate and the formation of a new peptide bond between the carbonyl of the D-alanyl moiety and theamino group of another peptide unit. Most discussion of DD- peptidase mechanisms revolves around the catalysts of proton transfer. During formation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate, a proton must be removed from the active site serine hydroxyl group and one must be added to the amine leaving group. A similar proton movement must be facilitated in deacylation. The identity of the general acid and base catalysts involved in these proton transfers has not yet been elucidated. However, the catalytic triad tyrosine, lysine, and serine, as well as serine, lysine, serine have been proposed.  Structure  Transpeptidases are members of the penicilloyl-serine transferase superfamily, which has a signature SxxK conserved motif. With \\"x\\" denoting a variable amino acid residue, the transpeptidases of this superfamily show a trend in the form of three motifs: SxxK, SxN (or analogue), and KTG (or analogue). These motifs occur at equivalent places, and are roughly equally spaced, along the polypeptide chain. The folded protein brings these motifs close to each other at the catalytic center between an all-Œ± domain and an Œ±/Œ≤ domain. With \\"x\\" denoting a variable amino acid residue, the transpeptidases of this superfamily show a trend in the form of three motifs: SxxK, SxN (or analogue), and KTG (or analogue). These motifs occur at equivalent places, and are roughly equally spaced, along the polypeptide chain. The folded protein brings these motifs close to each other at the catalytic center between an all-Œ± domain and an Œ±/Œ≤ domain. The structure of the streptomyces K15 DD- transpeptidase has been studied, and consists of a single polypeptide chain organized into two domains. One domain contains mainly Œ±-helices, and the second one is of Œ±/Œ≤-type. The center of the catalytic cleft is occupied by the Ser35-Thr36-Thr37-Lys38 tetrad, which includes the nucleophilic Ser35 residue at the amino-terminal end of helix Œ±2. One side of the cavity is defined by the Ser96-Gly97-Cys98 loop connecting helices Œ±4 and Œ±5. The Lys213-Thr214-Gly215 triad lies on strand Œ≤3 on the opposite side of the cavity. The backbone NH group of the essential Ser35 residue and that of Ser216 downstream from the motif Lys213-Thr214-Gly215 occupy positions that are compatible with the oxyanion hole function required for catalysis. The enzyme is classified as a DD-transpeptidase because the susceptible peptide bond of the carbonyl donor extends between two carbon atoms with the D-configuration.  Biological Function  All bacteria possess at least one, most often several, monofunctional serine DD-peptidases.  Disease Relevance  The structural similarity between (A) D-Ala-D-Ala terminus of peptidoglycan terminus and (B) penicillins. Transpeptidases misrecognize penicillins for the TPase catalytic reaction. This enzyme is an excellent drug target because it is essential, is accessible from the periplasm, and has no equivalent in mammalian cells. DD-transpeptidase is the target protein of Œ≤-lactam antibiotics (e.g. penicillin) This is because the structure of the Œ≤-lactam closely resembles the D-ala-D-ala residue. Œ≤-lactams exert their effect by competitively inactivating the serine DD-transpeptidase catalytic site. Penicillin is a cyclic analogue of the D-Ala-D-Ala terminated carbonyl donors, therefore in the presence of this antibiotic, the reaction stops at the level of the serine ester-linked penicilloyl enzyme. Thus Œ≤-lactam antibiotics force these enzymes to behave like penicillin binding proteins. Kinetically, the interaction between the DD-peptidase and beta-lactams is a three-step reaction: E+I\\\\rightleftharpoons E\\\\cdot I\\\\rightarrow E-I*\\\\rightarrow E + P Beta-Iactams may form an adduct E-I* of high stability with DD-transpeptidase. The half life of this adduct is around hours, whereas the half-life of the normal reaction is in the order of milliseconds. The interference with the enzyme processes responsible for cell wall formation results in cellular lysis and death due to the triggering of the autolytic system in the bacteria.

The group's name is derived from \\"Jo Jo Gunne\\", a Chuck Berry song that peaked at #83 as a single in November 1958. Career Ferguson and Andes, along with Mark's brother Matt Andes (born February 6, 1949; guitar, vocals) and William \\"Curly\\" Smith (born January 31, 1952, Wolf Point, Montana; drums, vocals, and harp), were signed to Asylum Records. Jo Jo Gunne had a Number 6 hit in the UK Singles Chart with the song, \\"Run Run Run\\", taken from their first album, Jo Jo Gunne (1972), which peaked at 27 in U.S. charts, and received airplay on U.S. album- oriented rock FM radio stations. The song reached number 30 in Canada. The group did not maintain the commercial momentum of their first release. They broke up in 1975. Personnel changes Following the first album, Mark Andes left the band after a falling out with his brother Matt and Ferguson and was replaced by Jimmie Randall. Randall introduced a brighter bass sound and helped increase the band's overall volume. Matt Andes left after Jumpin' the Gunne, and he was briefly replaced by Starr Donaldson (born September 23, 1950). A more permanent replacement was found in John Staehely (born 25 January 1952, Austin, Texas), who had played on Feedback, the Spirit album that followed Ferguson and Andes's departure. Staehely's overdriven guitar was a complete change from Matt Andes's Ry Cooder style slide guitar. After the band broke up, Ferguson recorded several solo albums, including the hit singles \\"Thunder Island\\" and \\"Shakedown Cruise\\", and scored TV shows and mostly non-notable movies. Mark Andes next joined Firefall and, later, Heart. Smith went on to have a career as a session drummer, and also played with Spirit in the 1980s and Boston from 1994 to 2000. Recordings The band's first album Jo Jo Gunne was released in 1972 and the first single \\"Run, Run, Run\\" became a top 40 hit with the album riding the charts to #57 on Billboard's Top 100 Albums. Their second album Bite Down Hard was a minor success peaking on the Billboard Top 200 chart at #75. The fact that there was no breakout single failed to generate interest and sales for the band. The album was produced by Bill Szymczyk who was best known at the time for his production work on Joe Walsh's Barnstorm and B.B. King's Completely Well which featured the hit single \\"The Thrill Is Gone\\". The band's third album Jumpin' the Gunne failed to rise any higher than #169 on the Billboard Top 200 chart, due in large part to the album cover's depiction of an obesely fat naked woman flying over the group in bed. The band's fourth album, So...Where's the Show?, featured new guitarist John Staehely. Staehely's harder edged sound complemented Ferguson's songs giving the band a much harder rock sound than on their previous efforts. Reunion The original line-up temporarily got back together around 1992. In a July 1995 interview in Vintage Guitar Magazine, Mark Andes recalls: \\"Curly Smith called me up and noted that it was the twentieth anniversary of when that band had formed; Steve Lukather took us into the studio and we recorded a lot of new material, but it didn't go anywhere\\". They began recording again in 2005 in Santa Barbara at Jay Ferguson's studio. The 2005 recordings were eventually put out as an album, Big Chain, on Blue Hand Records. The music was co-produced by the band and engineered by Ferguson.

Early life She was born Anna Jacoba Westra in 1936 in Leiden, Netherlands, the only child of Pieter Hein Westra and Hendrika Christina van Doorn.Handboek: Ans Westra Photographs, 2004, published by Blair Wakefield Exhibitions In 1953, Westra moved to Rotterdam and studied at the Industrieschool voor Meisjes, graduating in 1957 with a Diploma in Arts and Craft teaching, specialising in artistic needlework.Handboek: Ans Westra Photographs, 2004, published by Blair Wakefield Exhibitions The same year, she left the Netherlands for New Zealand, and she became a naturalised New Zealand citizen in 1963. Career Initial interest in photography Westra was exposed to photography as a teenager by her stepfather. A visit in 1956 to the international exhibition The Family of Man in Amsterdam, together with a book by Joan van der Keukens, Wij Zijn 17 (We Are Seventeen), inspired Ans' first photographic documentation, which featured her fellow students. Her obsession with capturing the world through a camera was instilled after encountering the famous Family of Man exhibition in Amsterdam. This utopian, quasi- anthropological exhibition, curated by MoMA‚Äôs Edward Steichen, toured the world from 1955 to 1963, and was a major influence on Westra‚Äôs work, as was precocious teenager Joan van der Keuken‚Äôs 1955 photobook Wij Zijn 17 (We Are 17), which depicts the lives of post-war Dutch youth. In 1957, Westra travelled to New Zealand to visit her father who had earlier immigrated. She stayed in Auckland and worked for eight months at Crown Lynn Potteries. Professional photography In 1958 she moved to Wellington, where she joined the Wellington Camera Club and worked in various local photographic studios.Handboek: Ans Westra Photographs, 2004, published by Blair Wakefield Exhibition In 1960, Westra received international recognition winning a prize from the UK Photography magazine for her work entitled Assignment No. 2. That same year Westra had her first photograph published in New Zealand on the cover of Te Ao Hou, a magazine published by the Department of Maori Affairs. In 1962 she began working as a full-time, freelance documentary photographer. Much of her early work was for the School Publications Branch of the Department of Education and Te Ao Hou.Handboek: Ans Westra Photographs, 2004, published by Blair Wakefield Exhibitions In 1964 her school bulletin Washday at the Pa was published, and distributed to primary school classrooms throughout New Zealand. Soon after its release the journal was withdrawn by order of the Minister of Education at the request of the Maori Women‚Äôs Welfare League. Later in 1964 Washday at the Pa was privately republished by the Caxton Press.Handboek: Ans Westra Photographs, 2004, published by Blair Wakefield Exhibitions Westra received a Certificate of Excellence from the New York World‚Äôs Fair photographic exhibition in 1964‚Äì1965.Handboek: Ans Westra Photographs, 2004, published by Blair Wakefield Exhibitions Westra had a relationship with writer Barry Crump for three months and their son Erik John Westra was born on 7 May 1965. Later that year Ans Westra returned to the Netherlands to live until 1969.Handboek: Ans Westra Photographs, 2004, published by Blair Wakefield Exhibitions In 1967 Maori was published with photography by Westra and text by James Ritchie.Handboek: Ans Westra Photographs, 2004, published by Blair Wakefield Exhibitions Westra's daughter, Lisa Christina van Hulst was born on 1 July 1973; her second son, Adrian Jacob van Hulst was born three years later on 4 December 1976.Handboek: Ans Westra Photographs, 2004, published by Blair Wakefield Exhibitions In 1982 an archive of Westra's negatives was established at the Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington.Handboek: Ans Westra Photographs, 2004, published by Blair Wakefield Exhibitions Westra was the Pacific regional winner of the Commonwealth Photography Award in 1986, travelling to the Philippines to photograph and then onwards to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and America. In the late 1980s and 1990s, Westra undertook several artist-in- residences including at the Dowse Art Museum, Lower Hutt (1988‚Äì89), the Tylee Cottage Residency, Wanganui (1993) and in 1996, she was awarded the inaugural Southland Art Foundation Artist in Residence award by Southland Art Foundation, Southern Institute of Technology, Southland Museum and Art Gallery and Creative New Zealand. In 1998 she was artist-in-residence at the Otago School of Fine Arts, Otago Polytechnic.Handboek: Ans Westra Photographs, 2004, published by Blair Wakefield Exhibitions Westra was the subject of the 2006 documentary Ans Westra: Private Journeys/Public Thoughts by Luit Bieringa. Westra's 2009 book and exhibition, The Crescent Moon: The Asian Face of Islam in New Zealand features her own photographs, with text by New Zealand writer Adrienne Jansen. The book's interviews and photographs of 37 individuals give insights into the lives of Asian Muslims in New Zealand.\\"The Crescent Moon.\\" Asia New Zealand Foundation. 2009. .

The Gulf of Paria () is a shallow (180m at its deepest) semi-enclosed inland sea located between the island of Trinidad (Republic of Trinidad and Tobago) and the east coast of Venezuela. It separates the two countries by as little as 15 km at its narrowest and 120 km at its widest points. The tides within the gulf are semi- diurnal in nature with a range of approximately 1m.https://www.fig.net/resources/proceedings/fig_proceedings/athens/papers/wsh2/WSH2_3_Neale.pdf The Gulf of Paria is considered to be one of the best natural harbours on the Atlantic coast of the Americas. The jurisdiction of the Gulf of Paria is split between Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela with Trinidad and Tobago having control over approximately (37.7%) and Venezuela the remainder(62.3%).United States Department of State It was originally named the Gulf of the Whale () by Christopher Columbus, but the 19th century whaling industry eliminated whales from the area and populations have never recovered. Cartographic sources of the late 18th century repeatedly refer to it as the Sad Gulf ().Mapa de la ysla de Trinidad. Archivo General de Indias. Unidad: Mapas y Planos. Signatura: MP-Venezuela, 185. Portal de Archivos Espa√±oles Cedros Bay, with the Columbus Channel in the background In the north, the gulf is connected to the Caribbean Sea through the Dragons' Mouths () between the Paria Peninsula of Venezuela and the Chaguaramas Peninsula of Trinidad. In the south, the gulf is connected to the Atlantic through the Columbus Channel, also known as the Serpent's Mouth (), between the Cedros Peninsula and the Orinoco Delta. Panoramic view of Gulf of Paria looking south-east. Oil and natural gas The Gulf of Paria lies entirely within the broad strike-slip plate boundary zone of the southeastern Caribbean. The structure of the Gulf consists of a complex set of transtensional basins superimposed on a fold-and-thrust belt (Serrania del Interior of eastern Venezuela). The petroleum of Trinidad has been generated by prolific Upper Cretaceous source rocks, time equivalent to the La Luna and Querecual formations in Columbia and Venezuela. These source rocks were then overlain by a thick succession of Paleogene deep water sediments (shales and deep water sandstones) and shallow marine siliciclastic reservoir rocks. The transpression due to the influence of the Caribbean plate created several sub-basins across the Trinidad area; each having distinctive petroleum systems. The hydrocarbon basins in Trinidad are Southern Basin, Columbus Basin, Carupano Basin, Central Range/Darrien Rdige Basin and the Caroni Basin and Gulf of Paria Pull-apart Basin.http://www.energy.gov.tt/wp- content/uploads/2014/02/petroleum_geo.pdf The Caroni Basin is a Cenozoic basin bounded to the north by the El Pilar fault zone and the Northern Range fold- thrust belt and to the south by the Central Range fold-thrust belt. Its stratigraphy features a shallowing section from the Miocene which overlies Palaeocene and Lower Cretaceous deep water sediments. The Gulf of Paria is the western offshore extension of the Caroni basin. However its deformation is now extensional due to the right-stepping of the dextral El Pilar fault to the dextral Warm Springs fault. The Los Bajos fault separates the Gulf of Paria from the Southern basin sediments. Natural gas has been discovered in the onshore Caroni basin while in the Gulf of Paria, both oil and gas have been discovered.http://www.firstmagazine.com/Krishna Persad.pdf Fisheries The Gulf of Paria is a brackish water body - wet season salinities are below 23 ppt (parts per thousand) with extensive mangroves along the Venezuelan and Trinidadian coastlines. This body of water is basically a shallow sedimentary basin with a maximum depth of 0f 30m (16 fathoms) and a smooth substratum of fine mud with patches of shell debris and sand (Kenny and Bacon, 1981). These conditions lend itself to favourable fisheries conditions and the gulf itself is an important fishery (Heileman and Ramsaroop, 1990). The proximity of the Orinoco Delta to the Gulf suggests that these waters are strongly influenced by fluvial discharges from the Amazon and Orinoco River systems, with the intensity of these discharges varying with the seasons (van Andel and Postma, 1954; Gade, 1961). These rivers are thought to be important effectors of nutrient enhancing upwelling currents on the adjacent continental shelf and sources of primary and secondary productivity for the water around Trinidad, especially in the Gulf (Farbes, 1983). As such, Trinidad supports a more productive and diverse exploitable fish and invertebrate resource base than most of the Eastern Caribbean islands (Agard et al. 1996). The Gulf of Paria is the most important fishing ground for shrimp and finfish in Trinidad.http://www.ema.co.tt/docs/public/comments/NEC_PLSEIP%20SUPPL%20EIA_APP%20XII_090306.pdf Port and logistics Major ports located within the Gulf of Paria basin include: * The Port of Port of Spain * Plipdeco's Port of Point Lisas in Couva * Port of San Fernando * Port of Point Fortin * Pedernales in Venezuela's Delta Amacuro state *Oldendorff Carriers floating facility - Oldendorff Carriers has been operating a floating facility consisting of two cranes, within Trinidadian waters since 2012, for the purpose of transhipment of iron ore from Santana, Brazil to the Middle and Far East.

He served as the 35th mayor of San Francisco, from 1964 to 1968, the first Democrat elected to the office in 50 years, and the first in an unbroken line of Democratic mayors that lasts to the present (). His term in the United States House of Representatives, immediately prior to his mayoralty (1949-1964), also broke a long streak of Republican tenure (44 years) and began a streak of Democratic representatives for San Francisco (and, coincidentally, the ) that continues to the present (). Shelley earned a law degree from the University of San Francisco in 1932. He served in the United States Coast Guard during World War II and was a member of the California State Senate from 1938 to 1946. He ran an unsuccessful race for the Lieutenant Governor's office against Goodwin Knight in 1946. Shelley would then make his mark as a leader of the California delegation to the 1948 Democratic National Convention, when he helped marshal his state's votes to support a strong civil rights plank. Shelley entered the United States House of Representatives in 1949 and served until 1964, when he stepped down to be inaugurated Mayor of San Francisco after winning the November, 1963 election by nearly a 12-point margin against his nearest opponent, Harold Dobbs (50-38.5%). Early life, family and education John Francis Shelley was the oldest of nine children born to Dennis Shelley and Mary Casey Shelley on September 3, 1905. His father was an immigrant from County Cork, Ireland (then part of the United Kingdom), who became a longshoreman in California. He grew up in the Mission District of San Francisco, then \\"a tough working-class district,\\" where he \\"acquired a deep-seated belief that 'working it out instead of fighting it out' was the best policy when disagreement was encountered.\\" He attended Mission High School, where in 1923 he was elected student body president. He studied law at the University of San Francisco, while working as a bakery driver and playing varsity football. Early union activities After graduation (receiving his law degree in 1932), Shelley became a business agent for the Bakery Wagon Drivers Union. In 1936 he became an AFL official, defeating an incumbent to become vice-president of the San Francisco Labor Council. He was the council's representative to the Pacific coast's first industrial development conference aimed at girls and hosted by several Northern California YWCAs. Shelley was elected President of the Council in 1937. Shortly into his term, the Council began organizing state agricultural and cannery workers under the AFL. Shelley was one of the leaders of the California People's Legislative Conference, a group supporting Washington state's minimum wage, while the Supreme Court was entertaining a constitutional challenge against it in West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish. Beginning in the Spring of 1937 Shelley faced two crises. First, there was growing labor unrest. Second, the Committee for Industrial Organization actively attempted to replace the AFL as bargaining agent for local unionized shops. Strikes and threats of strikes in Northern California followed first the sit-down strike against General Motors and then strikes at several Works Progress Administration projects in the San Francisco Bay area. Shelley was active in settling several labor disputes, but despite his efforts 3,500 members of six unions went on strike against 16 leading San Francisco Hotels on May 1, 1937. Continuation at page 10. On the same day, the AFL purged the CIO from the Alameda Labor Council owing to a jurisdictional dispute between the AFL Longshoremen and the CIO Teamsters, Continuation at page 2. a move that the San Francisco Labor Council strongly disapproved. In the midst of the hotel strike, 2100 elevators and janitors in buildings citywide voted to strike, but the work-stoppage was postponed by the international to continue negotiating. Other unions voted to strike, including the milk wagon drivers. Relations with the FBI Prior to his election as U.S. Congressman, Shelley was included in the FBI's Custodial Detention (DETCOM) files. The FBI's \\"DETCOM Program\\" \\"was concerned with the individuals 'to be given priority arrest in the event of ... an emergency.'\\" Priority under the Detcom program was given to \\"all top functionaries, all key figures, all individuals tabbed under the Comsab program\\", and \\"any other individual who, though he does not fall in the above groups, should be given priority arrest because of some peculiar circumstances\\". A memo by Warren Olney III alerted FBI Director Hoover to the fact that Shelley was recently elected and remained targeted, along with one other California congressman, to be arrested by the FBI as a security risk in case of a Soviet attack.FBI File 100-356062-sub 34, section 11 (Custodial Detention, Field Files), page 21, reproduced in National Security and the FBI Surveillance of Enemy Aliens, a microfilm series by Gale Cengage Learning (Woodbridge, Connecticut: Primary Source Media, c2009), reel 18. A July 23, 1962 FBI search slip on Shelley is check-marked for \\"subversive references only\\" and remains heavily redacted with numerous unreleased documents. Mayor of San Francisco Shelley's term as mayor was filled with challenges, including strikes over discriminatory hiring practices against African-Americans at the Palace Hotel, a public nurse strike in 1966, and a threatened San Francisco Symphony Orchestra strike in 1967. Shelley was mayor during the Summer of Love, a time of radicalism in the Haight-Ashbury and turmoil throughout the city. The Black rage toward \\"Auto Row\\" on Van Ness Avenue. Shelley was faced with riots in Bayview-Hunters Point on September 27, 1966, after a white police officer fatally shot a black youth accused of auto theft. Shelley declared a state of emergency in the city for six days. After the riots ended, Shelley took several public steps to improve relations between city government and the African-American community. He appointed the city and county's first African-American supervisor, Terry Francois. Shelley took an aggressive stance against several prominent anti- development mobilizations during his tenure, including movements in opposition to development at the Yerba Buena Gardens and in the Western Addition. Shelley bowed out of running for a second term in office; his stated reasons were health-related, but it was thought that prominent political forces in the city's establishment wanted a more stringently pro-development mayor in office. Family Shelley's son, Kevin Shelley, was a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors from 1990 to 1996, a member of the California State Assembly from 1997 to 2003 and served as California Secretary of State from 2003 to 2005. Shelley's daughter, Joan-Marie Shelley, was a French teacher for 30 years at Lincoln High School and Lowell High School in San Francisco Unified School District and carried on the family tradition of labor union leadership, serving as vice-president (1978-1984) and president (1984-1989) of the San Francisco Federation of Teachers and as the founding president (1989-1997) of the United Educators of San Francisco, a merger of the local American Federation of Teachers and local National Education Association unions.

Even with his connection to \\"Fast Weltweit\\", Bernd never released any records with them. When he was 20, Begemann moved to Hamburg to later create the band known as Die Antwort (engl.: The Answer). With Die Antwort, Begemann would finally be able to do the music he's always desired. This made the \\"Hamburg-Ostwestfalen-Verbindung\\" (the Hamburg-East-Westphalian Connection). 1988 was the year that it finally happened: Die Antwort released its first CD. Produced for 150,000 german marks (by RCA), the (untitled) CD flopped because, according to some people, the band's \\"image was too hard for their soft sound\\". Eventually, Die Antwort broke up as a band. With respect to his musical attitude, Begemann said: \\"I only make music because nobody can speak for me. I'm the only one who can. That's why being punk doesn't just mean drinking cheap beer and puking on the sidewalk.\\"  Discography   Bernd Begemann and Die Befreiung  Albums * Unsere Liebe ist ein Aufstand (2004) * Glanz (2008) * Ich erkl√§re diese Krise f√ºr beendet (2009) Singles * Ich habe nichts erreicht au√üer dir (2004)  Bernd Begemann and Dirk Darmstaedter  Albums * This Road Doesn't Lead to My House Anymore (2003) * So geht das jede Nacht (2010)  Bernd Begemann  Albums * Rezession, Baby!

Debuting in the original Mortal Kombat game from 1992, she was a late addition to the game following a decision that the game needed a female character. Within the series canon, she is the commanding officer of the United States Special Forces and later of a specialized U.S. government agency. Her goal in most of the games is to pursue and capture the villain Kano, as well as eliminate his criminal syndicate, the Black Dragon. In later games, she is joined in this effort by her comrade Jax Briggs, and her and Johnny Cage's daughter, Cassie Cage. One of the original seven player characters of the Mortal Kombat franchise, Sonya was inspired by the martial artist Cynthia Rothrock and has featured in almost all of the games since her inception. She has also appeared in alternate MK media, including the two live-action films, the animated series Defenders of the Realm, the web series Legacy, print media like the comics series, and official merchandise. Appearances Video games Sonya Blade is one of the main heroes of the Mortal Kombat series. Hailing from Austin, Texas, she is a second-generation United States Special Forces officer who followed in the footsteps of her father, Major Herman Blade. Her impulsive personality is catalyzed by her superior and good friend Major Jackson \\"Jax\\" Briggs. Sonya also has a long- standing feud with a thug known as Kano, who stands for everything she despises. In the original Mortal Kombat (1992), Lieutenant Sonya Blade and her team were pursuing Kano, leader of the Black Dragon international crime organization. After he jumped aboard an old junk in order to escape capture, Sonya and her comrades followed him to a remote island where Shang Tsung's Mortal Kombat tournament was underway. Upon arrival, they were ambushed by Tsung's personal guard, and Sonya was forced to compete in order to spare her companions' lives. Shang Tsung, however, had no intention of fulfilling his end of the bargain and had her unit killed. After he was defeated by Shaolin monk Liu Kang in the final battle, Sonya teamed up with movie star Johnny Cage and Kano to fight off the Shokan, Prince Goro. During the battle, the island began to crumble and she and Kano were sent to Outworld as Shang Tsung's prisoners to appease the Outworld emperor, Shao Kahn. Sonya was able to send a signal to Jax from Outworld and, during the events of Mortal Kombat II (1993), he traveled there to find her. Jax made contact with the other Earthrealm warriors, and together they learned of Shao Kahn's scheme to invade Earth. Before and during their imprisonment, Sonya and Kano were forced to put their differences aside and work together to survive in Outworld. She was later freed by Jax, who arrested Kano, but as soon as they passed through the portal to Earthrealm, Kano escaped and fled back to Outworld. Sonya was one of a few selected Earthrealm warriors whose souls were not taken following Shao Kahn's invasion of Earth in Mortal Kombat 3 (1995). She re-encountered Kano on top of a skyscraper near his fortress and after a fight, hurled him off the roof to his apparent death. In Mortal Kombat 4 (1997), after her journey into Outworld and Shao Kahn's near destruction of Earth, Sonya became a member of the U.S. government's Outer World Investigation Agency (OIA). However, she continued to have conflicts with the Black Dragon, especially after its last known member, Jarek, fled to Edenia while Sonya was chasing him. This led her and Jax to team up with Liu Kang and thunder god Raiden to free the realm from the fallen Elder God Shinnok's grasp and to prevent him from coming to Earth. After Shinnok's defeat, in which Jarek had reluctantly participated in to save himself, he tried to kill Sonya, but Jax intervened and dropped him off a cliff. After returning to Earthrealm, Jax and Sonya found the cyborg Cyrax malfunctioning in a desert. The two brought him back to OIA headquarters, where they were able to restore his humanity before helping him join the agency. In Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance (2002), while on an assignment in the East, Sonya learned the OIA had been destroyed by an accomplice of the titular alliance of Shang Tsung and Quan Chi. Not long after, Raiden sought out her aid against the Deadly Alliance and instructed her to meet with his other chosen warriors on Shang Tsung's abandoned island, where she developed a rivalry with Frost. To earn the right to pass into Outworld, each warrior had to defeat a representation of his or her adversary. To Sonya's surprise, hers was a stranger with a red dragon on his back. She was killed in battle against the Deadly Alliance's Tarkatan forces, but their victory was short-lived as the Dragon King Onaga reclaimed Outworld and defeated them in turn. With his ability to raise the dead at will, he resurrected Sonya and her fallen comrades to serve as his slaves until their souls were freed by Liu Kang and Shao Kahn's enforcer Ermac during Mortal Kombat: Deception (2004). In Mortal Kombat: Armageddon (2006), Sonya returned to Earth after Onaga's defeat, with the intention of continuing her assault on both the Black and Red Dragon clans, only to be forced to focus on a newly established threat. In her absence, the Tekunin cyber ninja clan had grown powerful enough to disrupt Earth civilization and had violated the laws of Mortal Kombat by engaging in illegal interdimensional alliances with unknown parties. Sonya succeeded in downing the Tekunin's flagship, helmed by their Grandmaster Sektor. She sent in a team led by Jax to hunt for survivors, but they mysteriously vanished. Fearing for Jax's safety, she tracked the signal of a homing beacon placed on Tekunin prisoner Taven, who escaped thanks to her intervention, and eventually confronted him in Arktika to interrogate him, only to be beaten. Sonya later fights alongside her friends in the Battle of Armageddon in Edenia, only to become one of its many casualties; torn apart by an unknown opponent. In the Mortal Kombat reboot game (2011), an alternate-timeline retelling of the first three games, Sonya teams up with Jax in his mission to bring down the Black Dragon, succeeding in seizing many of their weapons caches. However, after their key informant, Kano, was discovered to actually to be a high-powered member of the organization, Sonya and Jax focus solely on his capture following the deaths of many of their comrades in subsequent ambushes.Sonya MK2011 Bio - Kamidogu. Retrieved March 3, 2014.Jax MK2011 Bio - Kamidogu. Retrieved March 3, 2014. This leads them to the Mortal Kombat tournament on Shang Tsung's uncharted island, where Jax is captured and imprisoned, forcing Sonya to participate in the tournament in order to spare his life; during which she unwillingly becomes acquainted with pompous movie star Johnny Cage after repeatedly rejecting his advances. Sonya soon encounters Shang Tsung himself, but Raiden, whom she had not met yet in this timeline, intervenes before she can fight him. He enables Sonya to free a wounded Jax, but Shang Tsung destroys their extraction transport and presents Kano to Sonya as a challenge. While she emerges victorious, she is forbidden to take him prisoner. Raiden reappears and heals Jax's injuries, causing Sonya to become aware of both his presence and her crucial role in defending Earthrealm alongside his chosen warriors. After Liu Kang's victory over Shang Tsung in the first tournament, Sonya is abducted and held captive in Outworld before being rescued by Jax, but after his arms are obliterated in a confrontation with Ermac, she transports him back to Earthrealm for medical attention; missing the second tournament entirely. Sonya and Jax reunite with the other Earthrealm warriors as they assemble to fight Shao Kahn's takeover, but most of them are massacred by his wife, Queen Sindel; leaving Sonya and Cage among the only survivors after the Kahn's demise and Raiden accidentally killing Liu Kang. Sonya returns as a playable character in Mortal Kombat X (2015). Two years following Shao Kahn's death, Shinnok and his forces attack Earthrealm, but General Sonya Blade, along with Johnny and Kenshi, aid Raiden in imprisoning Shinnok in his own amulet. The two later track down Quan Chi, Shinnok's second-in-command, and defeat him; restoring Jax as well as Sub-Zero and Scorpion to normal. Over the following 25 years, Sonya and Johnny Cage marry and have a daughter, Cassie Cage, but the two later divorce; allegedly due to Sonya frequently putting work before her family. However, after Cassie defeats Shinnok and saves Earthrealm, she, Sonya, and Johnny become a family again. In Mortal Kombat 11 (2019), Sonya, Cassie, and Jax's daughter Jacqui lead a Special Forces strike team in storming the Netherrealm before they can attack Earthrealm. After being trapped under debris, Sonya sacrifices herself to ensure the mission's success and her allies' escape; devastating Johnny and Cassie. When the keeper of time Kronika causes temporal anomalies amidst her plot to reset time, a younger version of Sonya was brought to the present. Upon learning of what happened to her present self, she was initially outraged that she had a child with Johnny and that Cassie apparently left her behind. Just as she learns her older self ordered Cassie to do so, she is captured by the present and past versions of Kano and forced to fight for the Black Dragon's entertainment before the Special Forces rescued her. During the ensuing fight, Sonya killed Kano's younger counterpart, erasing his present self from existence. Following this, she began to warm up to her Johnny and reconciled with Cassie. Sonya appears as one of the warriors representing the Mortal Kombat universe in the non-canonical crossover game, Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe (2008). In the story mode, Sonya is investigating the dimensional imbalance caused by Shao Kahn and Darkseid's inadvertent fusion into Dark Kahn. After defeating Catwoman, Baraka, Captain Marvel, and Green Lantern, Sonya and Jax return to their base to use a teleportation machine in an attempt to reach the DC Universe. When she finds Jax with Green Lantern, Sonya once again challenges the latter, only to be defeated and imprisoned before she and Jax escaped again. When Earthrealm's heroes and Outworld's villains join forces to fight invaders from the DC universe, Sonya reluctantly teams up with Kano to track a foreign energy signal, but they are confronted and defeated by the Joker and Deathstroke. When both sides meet for one last battle, Sonya once again fights Catwoman. In the end, she is knocked unconscious while Raiden and Superman defeat Dark Kahn and separate their universes. Design, portrayal and gameplay There were originally no plans for Sonya's inclusion in Mortal Kombat, which was supposed to feature only six characters, and she was added only when the president of Williams gave the development team an additional six weeks (adding to its already ten months of production) and told them to polish the game.GamesTM 2, page 21. At first, the additional character was actually Jax/Stryker; when the developers decided they need a \\"girl fighter\\", Sonya was created and his story was applied to her. The early Mortal Kombat series' character designer and writer John Tobias said he created \\"characters like Liu Kang or Shang Tsung, who represented the more mystical sides of the story, and Johnny Cage, Sonya or Jax, who came from places grounded more in reality...[Sonya and Kitana] were both important pieces of the game's fiction and archetypal structure of characters. But, player demographic was primarily a hardcore male audience and so the look and design of our female characters pandered to them back then just as they do today.\\"In Konversation: Mortal Kombat Online vs John Tobias - Part 1, Mortal Kombat Online, 09/17/2012. John Tobias' picture of Cynthia Rothrock inspired Sonya in the 1992 Mortal Kombat Sonya was named after one of the sisters of co-designer Ed Boon, as confirmed in Tanya's biography card in the special edition of Mortal Kombat: Deception. The character was inspired by martial artist and actress Cynthia Rothrock, who claimed, \\"they contacted me when I was in my prime in terms of my career, and I was too expensive for them. When I do conventions I do have a few people recognizing me for her, but I really had nothing to do with it. (...) It was a raw deal and I could have sued, but I'm not that type of person.\\" Sonya's original actress, Elizabeth Malecki, was recruited by Daniel Pesina at a fitness club where she worked as an aerobic instructor and had no idea about video games. She also was the only one of the cast who was not a martial arts expert, but had a dance and athletics background. She said: \\"Sonya was supposed to be special forces and a martial artist, so I decided to pull in the army green tights. And since I was into aerobics, I gave her the thong that was so popular back then for women to wear in exercise classes.\\" Her Sonya had some special moves like a roundhouse kick that were filmed but did not appear in the game. Malecki and some other Mortal Kombat actors later filed an unsuccessful lawsuit against Midway Games over unpaid royalties from the home versions of the game and the unauthorized use of her likeness in its sequel (in Judge Robert Gettleman's ruling, the character's name is misspelled as \\"Sonja\\"). alt= Sonya and Kano were the least popular characters of the first game and so the team decided to replace them, saving image memory space and time for the new characters. Producers said Sonya was \\"chucked out\\" from the game in favour of the palette swapped Kitana and Mileena as part of revamping the game, so it would better compete against Street Fighter II and its popular female character Chun-Li.The One Amiga 75 (December 1994) Sonya and Kano were promptly dropped for the first sequel and appear in Mortal Kombat II only in one of the backgrounds, chained in Kahn's Arena. At the time, Tobias said: \\"We still wanted to include them in the story line, so we had them captured. I don't know where or when or in what form, but Sonya and Kano will be back.\\" However, they both soon returned as playable characters in the very next game and Sonya proved to be one of the most popular of the Mortal Kombat characters. According to Midway's Mark Turmell, Sonya's Mortal Kombat 3 actress Kerri Hoskins \\"started getting phone calls from kids at home because we'd published her name.\\"Retro Gamer 116, page 41. Hoskins, whose martial arts training consisted of \\"some Tang Soo Do and a past of WWF wrestling and gymnastics,\\" said she was asked to join the cast of MK3 after establishing a working relationship at Midway with the producers of NBA Jam. She later also voiced Sonya for Mortal Kombat 4. Sonya's later voice actresses included Beth Melewski (MK:SM), Dana Lyn Baron (MKvDCU, MK2011), Tricia Helfer (MKX), and Ronda Rousey (MK11). Her motion actor during the Deception-Annihilation era was Carlos Pesina. Vincent Proce's concept art for an alternative version of Sonya in the cancelled original reboot game. The eventual 2011 reboot reinstated the character in her traditional soldier role The action-adventure spin-off game Mortal Kombat: Special Forces, which was eventually released in 2000 following delays, had been originally planned to star Sonya and to have both Jax and her (with a codename of \\"Panther\\") as playable characters, but Sonya's part was dropped again due to deadline issues exacerbated by Tobias's sudden departure from the company. For the abortive project with a working title of Mortal Kombat 8 (which was cancelled in favor of Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe), Sonya's look was considered to be \\"dramatically revamped\\" and she was to be given more character backstory, described as \\"the daughter of a Texas Ranger\\". The 2011's reboot's producer Shaun Himmerick wrote: \\"I love how we use Sonya in the game, I think it is really a great reference to MK and should be fun for the fans.\\" NetherRealm Studios art director Steve Beran said: \\"When you look at the version of Sonya or Scorpion from the first Mortal Kombat, it's almost laughable how simple their costumes were. You have to give fans the recognizability of their favorite characters, but make it not look like Sonya's wearing a leotard and workout clothes\\" (as in the early games).Official Xbox Magazine 126 (September 2011), page 43. Nevertheless, Sonya's original outfit did appear in Mortal Kombat X via downloadable content. Sonya's original special move is \\"Leg Grab\\", a handstand leg throw that was an idea of Malecki's (with a similar cartwheel kick since Mortal Kombat 4). Her signature Fatality is the \\"Kiss of Death\\"Retro Gamer 40, page 29. (an idea of Daniel Pesina's), a finishing move that makes the defeated opponent burn alive into a charred skeleton. At , Sonya is one of the tallest female characters and she stands out because of her long legs. For her initial appearance in the original Mortal Kombat game, SNES Force described her as having \\"the best jumping skills of any character ‚Äî her air punch and flying kick work well against most opponents. Her force wave is excellent for long range battles giving her a good all round performance, though she is fairly weak.\\"SNES Force 6 (November 1993), page 83. According to Nintendo Power, Sonya could be a \\"juggling demon\\" in Mortal Kombat Trilogy when in hands of an experienced player.Nintendo Power 91 (p.70). Total 64 opined she \\"is a nifty little fighter\\" in Trilogy, whose only weakness is that her attacks are lacking power when compared to some of the other characters.Total 64 2/97, page 60. Other appearances Live-action and animation Kerri Hoskins also portrayed the character in the theatrical show Mortal Kombat: Live Tour that emphasized getting young audiences into the martial arts, while the actors would travel to schools to give motivational speeches to students. Hoskins enthused that her experience in the Live Tour \\"was a riot\\" and that she felt \\"like a rock star.\\" In the show, Sonya takes part in the search for the powerful Dragon Amulet, until she is taken hostage by Shao Kahn at the end the first act in Outworld, motivating Jax and Liu Kang to save both her and the world in the second act. A publicity photo of 21-year-old left Bridgette Wilson was cast as Sonya in the first Mortal Kombat movie after the filmmakers' original choice, Cameron Diaz, injured her wrist during martial arts training and dropped out. During production, Wilson was given the nickname \\"RoboBabe\\" by director Paul Anderson,Goldman, Michael R. Mortal Kombat: The Movie: Behind the Scenes. Prima Lifestyles (1995). and performed her own stuntwork.TimesDaily, August 21, 1995, page 20. The character's stern personality and storyline in the film were faithful to the games, as was the depiction of her vendetta against Kano for murdering her (unnamed) partner. Kano baits her into boarding Shang Tsung's ship, where she encounters Cage and Liu Kang for the first time and engages in a standoff with Sub-Zero. Shang Tsung had conspired with Kano beforehand in arranging for him to fight Sonya at the tournament in anticipation of her defeat, which fails as Sonya defeats and kills Kano. She is later abducted by Shang Tsung and taken to the Emperor's castle in Outworld where she is challenged by Shang Tsung to final combat, which she staunchly refuses to do just before the arrival of Liu Kang, Cage and Kitana. According to the film's official magazine Mortal Kombat: The Ultimate Battle for Humanity, Shang Tsung intended for Sonya to become his queen after successfully conquering Earthrealm. Sonya was also one of the main protagonists, alongside Cage and Liu in the 1995 animated film Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins, a prequel to the movie wherein she was voiced by Jennifer Hale. For the 1997 sequel, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, Sandra Hess replaced Wilson as Sonya (Kerri Hoskins had too auditioned for the role, but did not \\"make the last cut of three girls\\" due to having no acting experience). In the film, Sonya is devastated by the death of Johnny Cage, who is killed by Kahn after saving her life. She then grudgingly joins Raiden in locating Jax, whom she rescues from, and helps him fight off, an extermination squad led by Cyrax. However, they later come into conflict with one another due to her sustained grief over Cage's death and her refusal to fill Jax in on the details of the Earthrealmers' mission, and they temporarily split apart as a result. They ultimately reunite with Liu Kang and Kitana and succeed in stopping Kahn from bringing Earth to ruin. Sonya has two fight scenes in the film, first defeating Mileena by breaking her neck in a mud pit after splitting from Jax, then squaring off against Ermac at the climax, during which Noob Saibot spawns from his chest and they assault her with repeated attacks until Jax intervenes to defeat Noob Saibot, enabling Sonya to regain the upper hand and emerge victorious against Ermac. Hess hated the mud scene due to the freezing cold, and said her favourite was the Cyrax fight.. In Brent V. Friedman and Bryce Zabel's screenplays for Annihilation, Sonya forcibly drowns Mileena in deep mud in the first draft and kills Mileena with her own sai in a revised script. Sonya was one of the lead characters in the 1996 animated TV series Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm, for which she was voiced by Olivia d'Abo. She is again Jax's partner and was given a signature catchphrase (\\"Kombat time!\\"). She is a wild and impulsive character who often has personality clashes with Raiden, while her impetuousness in combat sometimes yielded consequences for her teammates. Her vendetta against Kano was explained and was explored further in two separate episodes, in which Kano was shown to have killed her partner, Wexler, who was named after Threshold writer and producer Joshua Wexler.Joshua Wexler - Threshold Entertainment, 2006. Retrieved March 8, 2014.

The official character guide describes her as \\"completely unrestrained and volatile, a la Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon.\\" Following the loss of her previous two partners, Sonya \\"has built a wall around herself to protect herself from getting hurt again and feel the guilt and pain of watching those around her perish.\\" For Mortal Kombat: Rebirth, director Kevin Tancharoen's 2010 short film that served as a pitch for a feature-length reboot for Warner Bros.,UPDATE: What is Mortal Kombat: Rebirth?, ComingSoon.net, June 9, 2010. Sonya, played by Jeri Ryan, is a lieutenant in the fictional Deacon City Police Department who makes a brief appearance during Jax's interrogation of Hanzo Hasashi (Scorpion). Ryan reprised the role for the first two episodes of Tancharoen's 2011 web series Mortal Kombat: Legacy, in which Sonya again works with Jax to bust the Black Dragon, but her obsession with Kano leads to her capture, forcing Jax and Stryker to conduct a raid on the warehouse where the Dragons are carrying out their operations. While Sonya manages to free herself during the fracas, Jax later suffers massive damage to his arms after protecting her from an explosion. Ryan was slated to return for the second season but was forced to turn it down due to her ongoing work on Body of Proof.Eric Goldman, Comic-Con: Mortal Kombat Legacy Season 2 is Coming, IGN, July 14, 2012. Ryan said that she was familiar with the series but had never played the games and took the role as a favor for a friend, and that she was probably the only cast member who was not a martial artist. Ryan described her Sonya as \\"significantly more dressed than the video [game] version\\" and \\"a badass broad\\" that was \\"fun\\" to play, and was probably more believable and real world grounded in this version. It was the most physical acting she did since her role in Star Trek: Voyager a decade earlier; she noted her fight scenes were shorter than the others since she did not have much time to train, but she was helped by the fight choreographer and by Sonya's use of firearms... Tancharoen stated that Ryan could possibly return for the third season before the series ended with his departure. Sonya blade was one of the lead characters in the 2020 animated movie Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion's Revenge, who was voiced by Jennifer Carpenter. Jessica McNamee will portray Sonya for the 2021 reboot of the film series. Literature In the Malibu Comics licensed Mortal Kombat series, Sonya appeared with all of the characters from the first game (minus Reptile) in the 1994 Blood & Thunder miniseries, the first issue of which borrowed liberally from John Tobias' comic in detailing her dogged pursuit of Kano alongside her Special Forces comrades, and his escape onto Shang Tsung's junk that is en route to the tournament, the difference being that she voluntarily enters the island grounds to question Shang Tsung directly about Kano, rather than being captured and forced to fight per the first game's storyline and the official comic by John Tobias. Her lone partner in the series was an original character named Lance, who sported a cybernetic arm (similar to Jax's metal arms in MK3) and also participates in the tournament, but in the second issue he is killed by Kano in one of only two organized fights that commenced in the entire Malibu run. In the fourth issue, when the characters are stranded in Outworld, Johnny Cage encounters the ruler of a small village who looks exactly like Sonya, and brazenly kisses her; the woman (named Aynos; \\"Sonya\\" spelled backwards) immediately sentences him to death for the infraction before the real Sonya intervenes and teams up with Cage to defeat the imposter, which sparks a friendship between the two combatants. In issue six, she handily overpowers Kano in battle but is then not seen again for the rest of the comic, and in the Tournament Edition wrap-up of the miniseries, Sonya is victorious over Mileena in a fight that begins with Mileena stabbing her, and the storyline concludes with Sonya and Jax leaving with Kano in custody. In the second six-issue miniseries, 1995's Battlewave, Sonya learns of a brutal attack on Jax, and enlists Cage's help in her investigation, but convinced that only someone from Outworld could inflict such injury, she returns to Shang Tsung's island on her own, only to be attacked by Kintaro and taken to Shao Kahn's tower. She is brainwashed by Reptile into marrying Kahn, but in the Battlewave finale, the Earth warriors disrupt the ceremony and Sonya snaps out of the trance on her own. The issue featured an additional short story titled \\"Every Dog Has Its Day\\", which explored the relationship between Sonya and Cage after she is cast in his latest movie. In the 1995 two-issue miniseries U.S. Special Forces, she and Jax work to capture an original Black Dragon character named Rojack. Sonya was the only character throughout the entire Malibu series who never referred to themselves in the third person. The first film's novelization by Martin Delrio includes a detailed opening scene of an unsuccessful joint mission of arresting Black Dragon members by the Special Forces and an international task force, which culminates in Kano killing the task force's lieutenant who is designated therein as Sonya's murdered partner.Delrio, Martin. Mortal Kombat. Tor Books (1995). . Sonya also has a fight scene with Jade that she wins before it officially begins after she fatally kicks Jade in the head after Jade returns her bow. Sonya was described in this scene as wearing \\"an Army- issue T-shirt\\" and \\"tightly-laced combat boots.\\" She also spares Kano's life in their fight, refusing to fall prey to Shang Tsung's scheme while declaring that nobody \\"owned\\" her.

Overview The album is essentially a career-retrospective for Hay: he is best known as the lead singer for the 1980s Australian pop band Men at Work, and roughly half of the songs on this album are Hay's solo studio renderings of works from the Men at Work catalog, while several others are remixes or re-recordings of material from his solo albums. Some songs are almost identical to the original recordings (e.g. \\"Be Good Johnny\\") while others are complete reinterpretations (e.g. acoustic versions of \\"Down Under\\" and \\"Who Can It Be Now?\\"). The album concludes with a version of \\"Down Under\\" recorded with the group Wild Clams. The album was re-released on vinyl in 2014 with different tracklisting replacing several tracks with new ones. Reception Allmusic gave a mostly negative review of the album, saying of the Men at Work covers that \\"While such acoustic Men at Work tracks as \\"Overkill\\" and \\"Who Can It Be Now?\\" are quite charming and worth hearing, the pointless re-recordings of \\"Be Good Johnny\\" and \\"It's a Mistake\\" (which are almost identical to the originals) are pretty darn pointless.\\" They summarized his solo reworkings as \\"worth hearing, but of course, they're not up to the high Business as Usual standards.\\" They concluded that the album \\"will only be of interest to the hardest of hardcore Colin Hay fan.\\" The Associated Press wrote that, \\"In the best possible sense, Man @ Work is like Colin Hay's cover version of his own greatest hits album.\\" Track listing All tracks written by Colin Hay, except where noted.

The Long Trail is the oldest long-distance hiking trail in America and stretches from the Massachusetts state line to the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border, along the main ridge of the Green Mountains. History Conceived on March 11, 1910 by James P. Taylor who was at the time the Assistant Headmaster of the Vermont Academy in Windsor, Vermont. Taylor lobbied other Vermont residents who shared his dream of a mission to \\"make the Vermont mountains play a larger part in the life of the people by protecting and maintaining the Long Trail system and fostering, through education, the stewardship of Vermont's hiking trails and mountains\\". In 1910, work began on the construction of America's first long-distance hiking path known as The Long Trail. The club completed the Long Trail in 1930. Today With 10,000 members, the club remains responsible for the trail, and is recognized by the state legislature as \\"the founder, sponsor, defender, and protector\\" of the Long Trail System. gmcburlington.org In addition to being the steward of the Long Trail, the Club's advocacy and education efforts also protect Vermont's many other hiking trails. Through its land protection program in northern Vermont, the Club has protected almost 80 miles of the Long Trail System, conserved 25,099acres, and completed 89 land and easement acquisitions since 1986. Moreover, The GMC publishes guidebooks, newsletters, and other printed media that serve hikers who wish to walk the Long Trail. The Green Mountain Club maintains the 272 mile Long Trail in cooperation with the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation, U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service, Appalachian Trail Conservancy, and private landowners. The Green Mountain Club also manages the section of the Appalachian Trail that passes through Vermont. The Appalachian Trail follows the Long Trail from the Vermont/Massachusetts state line to Route 4, at which point the Long Trail continues north and the Appalachian Trail heads eastward towards the White Mountains in New Hampshire. The GMC also manages other hiking trails in Vermont's Northeast Kingdom region.

The character was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. In the character's earliest appearances, she was a popular girl at the high school Peter Parker attends. She has been a regular supporting character in the various Spider-Man series in an on-and-off basis, and has ties to the Green Goblin and Molten Man. Laura Harrier portrayed Liz in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017). This version of the character is the daughter of the Vulture. Publication history Liz Allan is first named in The Amazing Spider-Man #4 (September 1963), the same issue in which Betty Brant first appears. However, an unnamed blonde female high school student in Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) appears to be Liz Allan, and The Marvel Encyclopedia lists this as her official first appearance. She was a supporting character in the series until Amazing Spider-Man #28 (September 1965), which bids farewell to Liz as both she and Spider-Man graduate from high school. Nearly a decade later, Liz Allan was brought back in a story arc in Amazing Spider-Man #132-133 (May‚ÄìJune 1974), in which it is revealed that she is the Molten Man's stepsister. Writer Gerry Conway recalled, \\"I liked doing callbacks to the run I was most influenced by, the original Stan Lee/Steve Ditko era, so bringing Liz back was something I'd wanted to do for a long time. And it gave me a reason to go back and look through the issues she was in, which brought me to the Molten Man's first appearance.\\" Fictional character biography Liz Allan was a high school student that attended Midtown High School together, and a minor love interest of Peter Parker and Flash Thompson. Initially, Peter likes Liz. However, she is Flash's girlfriend and initially considers Peter something of a loser, even taking part in the general ridicule that Peter endures on a daily basis.

However, after she hears an ailing Peter had donned a Spider-Man costume in order to save Betty Brant from Doctor Octopus, she develops a crush on him.The Amazing Spider-Man #12 By this time, however, Peter's interest has waned considerably, as he notes that Liz never showed any real interest in him until he began dating Betty Brant, and assumes that Liz's feelings are little more than a schoolgirl crush.

In Amazing Spider-Man #28 (September 1965), Peter and Liz graduate from high school.

Her mother reveals that her Uncle Frank, otherwise known as the Blob is actually her father. This conversation is interrupted by Magneto, who tells Liz that she must go with him to see her father. This is prevented when the X-Men arrive at her doorstep. Liz is pressured to decide between the Brotherhood or the X-Men. After asking Spider-Man's advice, she decides she doesn't want to follow either group, and that she is angry at her mother for lying to her for all these years, and flies away.

It is commonly used as a boastful claim of dominance over the intended listener. It may also be a part of role play between consenting adults or as a claim of sexual dominance. According to the Historical Dictionary of American Slang, the phrase dates back to 1681, when sex workers would use it to ask each other who their procurer was. Its modern popularity has been attributed to its frequent use in sexually suggestive skits broadcast in the 1980s by radio shock jock Doug Tracht; Tracht states he heard the term being used in a non-sexual manner in the 1968 song \\"Time of the Season\\" by The Zombies and \\"converted it to have a spicy connotation\\". The phrase is used in countless films and televisions shows, and is also used as a title for various forms of media including video games and songs.

In 2016, Skog√•s had 14,451 inhabitants. The suburb has conjoined with its northern neighbour Tr√•ngsund, forming a municipality district with a population of 22,200 people. The largest employer is the commercial centre in L√§nna. Sights include the √Ögesta Nature Reserve, the lakes Drevviken, Magelungen and Orl√•ngen, the congregations church Mariakyrkan, Tr√•ngsund Manor and the upper secondary school √ñstra Gymnasiet. Beatebergsanstalten, a jail for minor offenders, is located in the northwest of Skog√•s. Skog√•s is served by line 43 of the Stockholm commuter rail, and is 20 minutes from Stockholm City Station. Swedish national road 73 passes Skog√•s on its way to Nyn√§shamn. The name Skog√•s comes from the two words skog 'forest' and √•s 'ridge'; hence \\"the forest-covered ridge\\", reflecting Skog√•s's topography of hills, ridges and valleys.  History  Skog√•s started its history as a cottage summer retreat outside the capital but was given town-like structures during the 1960s, when the town-centre containing some 30 shops was finished. During the 1980s a large settlement of rowhouses (the largest in the country) was added in the eastern part of the suburb and since then, several areas of villas and one-family houses have increased the population greatly. Since 1997, there has been an urge in Skog√•s and Tr√•ngsund to leave Huddinge Municipality, and form an own municipality. The major idea for the name of such a new municipality would be Drevviken, named after the adjacent lake. A local political party, Drevvikenpartiet, was formed before the 1998 elections, and a referendum was held in all of the municipality, with a majority for leaving in the Skog√•s- Tr√•ngsund area, and a majority for them staying in the rest of Huddinge. After the 2006 elections, neither the socialist or non-socialist parties gained a majority in Huddinge municipality, and Drevvikenpartiet joined a coalition with the non-socialist parties in exchange for the promise of a new referendum on April 20, 2008. This referendum was to be held in Skog√•s and Tr√•ngsund only, but this time the no-side won quite clearly, 58.8% no and 40.1% yes.

Helpem Fren means \\"help a friend\\" in Solomon Islands Pidgin. The mission officially ended on 30 June 2017.  Causes for unrest  Deep-seated problems of land alienation dating from colonialism, unresolved after independence, led to a number of compensation claims on land use; and ethnic violence between 1998 and 2003. \\"The Honiara Peace Accord that was signed by the warring parties (Guadalcanal and Malaita), the government and the Commonwealth Special Envoy (Major General Sitiveni Rabuka) recognised several root causes of the conflict: *Land demands ‚Äì Guadalcanal leaders wanted all alienated land titles, which had been leased to government and to individual developers, to be returned to landowners (including any other land acquired illegally). *Political demands ‚Äì Guadalcanal wanted the establishment of a state government in order to have control over: the sale or use of local land; the distribution of wealth derived from local natural resources; and the migration of people in and out of the province. *Compensation demands ‚Äì Guadalcanal wanted payment for the lives of its indigenous people, who have been brutally murdered for their lands or for other reasons.\\" The warring parties mentioned were mainly the Solomon Islands Government, the Isatabu Freedom Movement and the Malaita Eagle Force led by, among others, Jimmy Rasta and Harold Keke.  International response  Map of the Solomon Islands A sizeable international security contingent of 2,200 police and troops, led by Australia (under the Australian Federal Police and Australian Defence Force name \\"Operation Anode\\") and New Zealand, and with representatives from about six other Pacific nations began arriving on 24 July 2003. Nick Warner assumed the role of Special Coordinator as leader of RAMSI, working with the Solomon Islands Government and assisted by a New Zealand Deputy Special Coordinator, Peter Noble, and Fijian Assistant Special Coordinator, Sekove Naqiolevu. Major contributing nations to RAMSI include Australia (which directed the operation), Fiji, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and Tonga. Pacific countries contribute to RAMSI including Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. Personnel from the Pacific countries are predominantly police officers served as part of RAMSI's Participating Police Force (PPF). Initially, the commander of \\"Combined Task Force 635\\" (CTF 635) ‚Äì the military element of the Mission ‚Äì was Lieutenant Colonel John Frewen, commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (2 RAR), and the deputy commander Major Vern Bennett, New Zealand Army, from Linton. The Land Component included HQ 2 RAR from Townsville, 200 Australian infantry from 2 RAR, a Fijian rifle company, probably from 3 Fiji Infantry Regiment, Queen Elizabeth Bks, Suva, and a Pacific Islands Company, under an Australian Company commander, with Tongan, PNG, and Australian rifle platoons. Supporting elements included eight Iroquois Helicopters, four each from 3 SQN, Royal New Zealand Air Force and 171 Operational Support Squadron, Australian Army, a PNG engineer troop, New Zealand engineer and medical elements, an Australian Combat Service Support Team, with some personnel from Army level troops from Sydney plus logistics personnel from New Zealand, and four Australian Project Nervana Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for surveillance.Colin Robinson & Steve Wyatt, 'Operation Helpem Fren,' Version 2.3, Orbat.com, 9 August 2003 In 2004, James Batley took over as Special Coordinator, followed by Tim George in late 2006. In 2005 New Zealander Paul Ash became Deputy Special Coordinator, followed by Dr Jonathan Austin in 2007. Mataiasi Lomaloma succeeded Naqiolevu as Assistant Special Coordinator in late 2005. Military personnel provide security, material and logistical assistance to police forces assisting the Solomon Islands Government in the restoration of law and order. From November 2003, the military component was reduced, as stability gradually returned to the country, and a sizeable civilian contingent, composed of economists, development assistance specialists and budget advisors commenced the reconstruction of the government, economy and finances of the Solomon Islands. The civilian contingent is now made up of around 130 personnel from many pacific countries, the most sizeable being Australia and New Zealand. Early successes included the stabilisation of government finances and normalisation of debt, as well as a number of economic reforms. Civilians in RAMSI are now focussing on capacity building of Solomon Islanders to take over the roles. Difficulties include the lack of available skilled Solomon Islanders. Former Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare was outspoken in his criticism of RAMSI, which he accused of being dominated by Australia and of undermining the Solomons' sovereignty.\\"RAMSI undermining Solomons' sovereignty: Sogavare\\", Campbell Cooney, ABC News, 16 October 2007\\"Building bridges in the Solomons\\", Anna Jones, BBC, 4 January 2008\\"Australia's Dominance Drives Wedge Into Pacific\\", Selwyn Manning, Scoop.co.nz, 24 October 2006 By contrast, his successor Prime Minister Derek Sikua has stated he supports RAMSI,\\"Sikua: Nation keen to retain RAMSI\\", Fiji Times, 29 January 2008 and has criticised his predecessor, saying in January 2008: \\"I think for some time in the last 18 months, the Solomon Islands government was preoccupied with finding fault in RAMSI.\\"\\"New Solomons PM pledges RAMSI support\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 21 January 2008 Sikua has stated: :\\"[We will] provide leadership that will work closely with RAMSI to achieve clearly stated and agreed objectives for the long-term benefit of Solomon Islands.

Australian deaths  Solomon Islands Ministry of Finance. In the early hours of 22 December 2004, Australian Protective Service Officer Adam Dunning was ambushed and killed while on a routine vehicle patrol with another officer in Honiara. Within 24 hours, a rifle company group from the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment was flown into the Solomon Islands. In early January 2005, a joint operation between the Royal Solomon Islands Police (RSIP) and Participating Police Force (PPF) resulted in the arrest of James Tatau. Tatau was charged with Dunning's murder, the attempted murder of his colleague, and an earlier shooting incident on a Participating Police Force (PPF) vehicle, in which a bullet narrowly missed two PPF officers. After the arrest, the military presence within RAMSI was again reduced. By 2005, the five troop-contributing nations (Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Tonga) together provided approximately 40 personnel to support the PPF. Solomon Islanders James Tatau and John Hen Ome were acquitted after standing trial for the killing of Adam Dunning in May 2007. An Australian soldier, Private Jamie Clark, died in 2005 after falling down a sinkhole while serving as a peacekeeper in the Solomon Islands.  Riots following 2006 general election  Australian soldiers assigned to RAMSI burning guns in October 2003 On 18 April 2006 Snyder Rini was elected Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands in a general election. This sparked rioting in Honiara amidst allegations that the election was fixed with the aid of money from Chinese businessmen. Parts of Honiara were razed and looted, with Chinese-owned property particularly targeted.\\"Zero tolerance for violence in Solomons\\", 25 April 2006, New Zealand Press Association With up to 90% of their shops burnt down in Chinatown, most Chinese have evacuated the country in fear of their personal safety. Snyder Rini resigned on the floor of Parliament on 26 April after just eight days as Prime Minister and as MPs were due to vote on a motion of no confidence against him. In response, from 20 April 2006, RAMSI forces were rapidly bolstered by a further 220 Australian troops. New Zealand sent a further rifle company and 30 police to increase its RAMSI contribution to around 160 troops and 67 police.Media Release ‚Äì Solomon Islands ‚Äì New Zealand Defence Force Assistance, 20 April 2006, New Zealand Defence ForceMedia Release ‚Äì Further Deployment to the Solomon Islands, 21 April 2006, New Zealand Defence Force The PPF comprised police officers from 15 Pacific nations: Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Republic of Marshall Islands, Palau, Federated States of Micronesia, Niue, Tonga, Samoa, Cook Islands, Vanuatu, Nauru, Kiribati and Tuvalu. 2013 military withdrawal On 1 July 2013, Australia, New Zealand, Tonga and Papua New Guinean forces began a \\"phased redeployment\\" from the Solomon Islands after it was assessed that the security situation in the country had stabilised. The last Australian infantry returned to Australia on 1 August 2013. All Australian personnel and equipment were scheduled to be withdrawn by September 2013. After arriving on 24 July 2003, a total of 7,270 Australian personnel deployed during that country's support to RAMSI. Of these, 2,122 were Reserve personnel.  Cost  In the year of 2011‚Äì12, $43.5 million was spent on the Australian contribution to the RAMSI. In 2014 Jenny Hayward-Jones at the Lowy Institute estimated that Australian government spending on RAMSI as $2.6 billion in real terms to that date.

He was the leader of Mongolia during its transition into democracy in 1990. Early life Batm√∂nkh was born in Khyargas sum of Uvs aimag on 10 March 1926. When starting primary school, he took his brother's name, Jamba, as a surname. After graduating seventh grade in his native Uvs aimag, he entered the National University of Mongolia's two year preparatory program. From 1947 to 1951, he studied at the National University's School of Economics. He met his future wife when they were both 16 years old. Both Batm√∂nkh and Daariimaa were housed in the same dormitory, when they were studying in the National University of Mongolia's School of Economics, and the Agricultural Technical College, respectively. They were married one year later. Daariimaa worked for 33 years at the National University of Mongolia Library, until 1988, when she retired. Early political career Batm√∂nkh became a member of the ruling Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) in 1948. In 1951, Batm√∂nkh started work as a professor at the Pedagogical University. In 1973, after working as a professor and director at the university for over twenty years, he was promoted to Minister of Science (Superintendent of the Department of Science Education of the Party's Central Bureau). In the spring of 1974, he was promoted to Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the MPRP. In June 1974, during a Session of the People's Great Khural, he was further promoted to the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, an office analogous to Prime Minister. Leadership of Mongolia (1984‚Äì1989) In 1984, along with D. Molomjamts, Batm√∂nkh played a key role in easing Tsedenbal's way out of power. In 1984, he became the Head of State when the party's long-time leader, Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, was ousted in a party congress. Batm√∂nkh strengthened Mongolia's alliance with the Soviet Union, but as in many other communist countries, there was much pressure for the party to give up power. He also called for the improvement of relations with China, saying during a meeting with President Kim Il sung while on a state visit to Pyongyang in November 1986 that \\"renewing the development of Sino-Mongolian relations is important for our two countries‚Äô people‚Äôs common interest\\". Batm√∂nkh at Kim Il sung on a 1988 North Korean stamp. Batm√∂nkh's reign contributed to the creation of major energy (the construction of Ulaanbaatar and Erdenet power stations, and the connection of the Central high-power electric grid with the Soviet Union's Siberian Grid) and mining (the beginning of the operations of Erdenet and Baganuur coal mines, and Bor-Ondor gypsum mine) infrastructure, together with, various other light production and food processing factories. Role in the Mongolian Revolution of 1990 In late 1989, the Democratic movement garnered strength. In March 1990 the first democratic alliance, called Ardchilsan Kholboo (Mongolian Democratic Union), launched a hunger strike urging that the communist government led by Batm√∂nkh resign. Batm√∂nkh decreed that the only way to end the situation was the resignation of the MPRP's Politburo, and maintained a strict policy of never using force. A book was later published with title \\"Never use force.\\" After discussions with the members of the Politburo and after the Eighth Congress of the Party's Central Committee, the MPRP officially stepped down from power on 9 March 1990. Batm√∂nkh's widow later recounted: \\"It was March of 1990. Batm√∂nkh was sitting at home, preparing for his speech to the MPRP's 8th Congress. The telephone rang, and after speaking a while he suddenly said \\"We few Mongolians should never make each other's noses bleed\\" and threw the phone away. It was not typical of him, he was a very calm person. He then said \\"Some leaders have come together and asked me to sign something. I'll go there and come back\\". He kept asking for his tie, not seeing that it was right next to him. To think about it now, he was very flustered and nervous. He went out without eating, just drinking a cup of tea at the door. I stayed at home, nervous that the protestors had clashed outside. In reality, they (others in Politburo and in authority) had asked him to sign a draft of a decree to crack down and scatter the protest outside. People who were present there later recalled that Batm√∂nkh said \\"I will never sign this. We few Mongols have not yet come to the point that we will make each other's noses bleed,\\" smacked the table, and left the room.\\" \\"He had resigned by the time he came home that evening. He didn't say what happened to me in detail. He was never a person to talk much about work. He was a very calm person,\\" his widow said. After retirement In 1990, most of his family members became unemployed after being accused of political corruption. He and his wife made bread and sold deel and gutals. From 1992 until his death, he lived in Dambadarjaa (Sukhbaatar district) while planting vegetables and fruits. He was privately critical of the new administration (particularly of Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat, the new president) after his retirement. He died in 1997.  In popular culture  Batm√∂nkh's role in the 1990 democratic movement was dramatized in the 2016 Mongolian film \\"Don't Forget\\" (\\"–ë“Ø“Ø –º–∞—Ä—Ç\\").

Many of his novels are based in exotic locations such as Istanbul, Saigon, or Nagasaki. One of his novels, Les Civilis√©s, about life in French colonial Indochina, won the third Prix Goncourt for 1905. He was elected to a chair at the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise on 26 March 1935, in competition with Paul Claudel, partly thanks to lobbying efforts by Pierre Benoit. Biography Initially, Claude Farr√®re had followed his father, an infantry colonel who served in the French colonies: he was admitted to the French Naval Academy in 1894, was made lieutenant in 1906 and was promoted to captain during 1918. He resigned the next year to concentrate on his writing career. Claude Farr√®re was a friend and was partly mentored by two other famous French writers of this period, i.e. Pierre Lou√øs and Pierre Loti, the latter having been as well a former Navy officer and a writer of books based in overseas countries and cultures. He was a prolific writer, and many of his books are based on his overseas travels and on exotic cultures, especially in Asia, the Orient and North Africa, partly based on his travels when he was an officer with the French Navy. His works have now largely fallen from favour, even among French readers, although some of his most famous books, such as 'Fum√©e d'opium', 'Les Civilis√©s', La 'Bataille' or 'Les hommes nouveaux' have been reedited in France at the end of the 20th century and the early 21st century. One anecdotal and indirect reference to Claude Farr√®re is the perfume \\"Mitsouko\\" created by the long-lived perfumer Jacques Guerlain, with whom Claude Farr√®re was friend. The story of Mitsouko is found in Farr√®re's novel La Bataille ('The Battle', 1909), which is a romance based upon Japan modernization and westernization during the Meiji period and upon the 1905 naval Battle of Tsushima when the Imperial Japanese Navy defeated the Russian Imperial Navy . In Claude Farr√®re's book 'La Bataille', Mitsouko was a beautiful Japanese woman whose name meant both 'honey comb' and 'mystery', who was married to a noble Japanese Navy officer and who had an ill-fated love affair with an English officer. 'La Bataille' was translated in several foreign languages, including into Serbian by Veljko M. Miliƒáeviƒá under the title 'Boj' (The Battle), published in Sarajevo in 1912. Farr√®re's name has also been given to a street in Sultanahmet, Istanbul for his favorable description of Turkish culture and Turks.≈ûahika Tem√ºr: Istanbul street named after French friend of Turks at Turkish Daily News Orhan Pamuk's publisher, ƒ∞leti≈üim Publishing, is situated on this street (\\"Klod Farer Caddesi\\" as spelled in Turkish). A number of Farr√®re's novels were translated and published internationally under his real name, Fr√©d√©ric-Charles Bargone. On 6 May 1932, at the opening of a Paris book fair at the H√¥tel Salomon de Rothschild, Farr√®re was in conversation with French President Paul Doumer when several shots were fired by Paul Gorguloff, a mentally unstable Russian √©migr√©. Doumer was fatally wounded. Farr√®re wrestled with the assassin until the police arrived.

Wright (January 6, 1949 ‚Äì January 12, 2016) was an American poet. She was a MacArthur Fellow, a Guggenheim Fellow, and the Poet Laureate of Rhode Island. Background C. D. Wright was born in Mountain Home, Arkansas, to a chancery judge and a court reporter. She earned a BA in French from Memphis State University (now the University of Memphis) in 1971 and briefly attended law school before leaving to pursue an MFA from the University of Arkansas, which she received in 1976. Her poetry thesis was titled Alla Breve Loving. In 1977, the publishing company founded by Frank Stanford, Lost Roads Publishers, published Wright's first collection, Room Rented by A Single Woman. After Stanford died in 1978, Wright took over Lost Roads, continuing its mission of publishing new poets and starting the practice of publishing translations. In 1979, she moved to San Francisco, where she met poet Forrest Gander. Wright and Gander married in 1983 and had a son, Brecht. The husband and wife were co-editors at Lost Roads until 2005. In 1981, Wright and Gander moved to Dolores Hidalgo, Mexico, where she completed her third book of poems, Translation of the Gospel Back into Tongues. In 1983, they moved to Providence, Rhode Island, where she began teaching at Brown University as the Israel J. Kapstein Professor of English. Over the next 30 years, Wright won many major American literary prizes (including fellowships from the Lila Wallace, Guggenheim, Lannan, and MacArthur Foundations) while publishing one of the most eclectic bodies of poetic work of her generation. The cyclical erotic and tormented fragments of Just Whistle are as distinct from the compressed, sensual narratives of Translation of the Gospel Back into Tongues as from the lyrical southern paeans of Further Adventures with You. Perhaps her most original and internationally influential publications are the book- length works Deepstep Come Shining, One Big Self, and One With Others. Each developed, in new directions, Wright's formally innovative and fundamentally ethical meditations on the South, on race relations, on incarceration, and on the lives of the unsung. Together, those books helped to define and extend the possibilities for documentary poetics in the 21st century. In 2013, Wright was elected a chancellor of the Academy of American Poets. Stephanie Burt has described Wright as an Elliptical Poet, but Burt did not use that description in an essay she published as a tribute to Wright just after Wright's death. As Joel Brouwer has said, she \\"belongs to a school of exactly one.\\" C.D. Wright died on January 12, 2016, six days after her 67th birthday. Her brother, Warren Wright, reported that she \\"died peacefully in her sleep of thrombosis, a clot, after an overly long flight from Chile.\\" At the time of her death, she was living in Barrington, Rhode Island. Poetry Wright's poetry is rooted in a sense of place and time and often employs distinct voices in dialogue, particularly those of the American South. Her work is formally inventive and often documentary in spirit, in the sense that it honors those whose stories or voices might be lost, were it not for her own writing. Her diction mixes high and low to surprising effect, and her range of reference is both broad and deep, including phrases from other languages, allusions to other poems, and pieces of conversation. Her books include precisely distilled lyrics such as those collected in Tremble as well as book-length poems beginning with Just Whistle, her first collaboration with photographer Deborah Luster. In a 2001 interview with Kent Johnson, Wright said, > As to my own aesthetic associations‚Äîaffiliations, sympathies‚ÄîI have never > belonged to a notable element of writers who identified with one another > partly because I come from Arkansas, specifically that part of Arkansas > known for its resistance-to-joining, a non-urban environment where readily > identifiable groups and sub-groups are less likely to form. In the same interview, she states, > The theoretically-driven San Francisco poets who were in cahoots with poets > in New York and conversant with European vanguard movements‚Äîthey provided me > with a need to become critically aware of my back-home ways; sharpened me to > a degree. I'm grateful for the exposure, the education. I am indebted to > particular poets' work from that point in time, but I am not an intellectual > in the sense that qualifies or requires me to belong to a manifestoed-group. > And of course one comes to take some pride in one's own outsider > status.Johnson, Kent. ‚ÄúLooking for ‚Äòone untranslatable song‚Äô: C.D.

Wright's later work includes String Light; Deepstep Come Shining, a book-length poem; and One Big Self: Prisoners of Louisiana, another collaboration with photographer Deborah Luster. One Big Self: An Investigation contains just the poems. Her poems are featured in American Alphabets: 25 Contemporary Poets (2006) and many other anthologies.

The steel barrel has an integrated Weaver style rail (similar to a Picatinny). This pistol is distinguished by two features: An integral rail along the top edge of the gun permits easy mounting of optical sights and other accessories. The gun's alloy frame and alloy-shrouded barrel help keep weight down for a full-sized pistol. Design The 22A is a hammer-fired, semi-automatic .22 caliber pistol. The enclosed hammer rotates in the frame, hitting the rear of the firing pin in the slide, which then hits the rim of the chambered round. After chambering the first round by pulling back and releasing the slide, each firing ejects the spent cartridge, cocks the hammer, and then strips a new round from the magazine and loads it into the chamber. The hammer is automatically cocked, and pulling the trigger simply releases it. This results in a lower trigger pull force unlike a double-action pistol where the trigger must first cock the hammer and then release it. A frame mounted safety switch is present along the left side of the frame in the conventional location to be operated by the user's right thumb. Patridge-type target sights are standard on this gun, with the rear sight adjustable for both windage and elevation. The front sight is integral with the barrel shroud and is not removable or adjustable. An integral feed ramp at the barrel breech helps assure reliable loading of rounds into the chamber from the magazine. Later models incorporate a magazine safety that does not permit the gun to fire unless the magazine is fully seated. This feature helps prevent accidental discharge during careless handling especially during cleaning. The magazine release is located on the front of the grip making it easy to locate and also makes it ambidextrous since it is equally well placed for both right and left handed shooters. This is more of a problem for people with smaller hands where the finger tips may lay on the front of the handle when gripping the gun. The gun takes down for cleaning via a pushbutton at the front that disengages the barrel from the frame. It is therefore possible to rapidly exchange barrels, for example to switch on and off one with a mounted scope, etc. There were several variants in terms of available barrel length (4\\", 5\\", 7\\"), target grips, and frame colors (gray or black). The stainless steel version (as opposed to the blued steel) was called the 22S.

At the time of the DART mission, only the Russian Space Agency and JAXA (formerly NASDA) had autonomous space craft navigation. Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC) was the prime contractor for construction, launch and operation of the DART vehicle with a project cost of $95 million US(2005). The contract was awarded in June 2001 and the spacecraft was launched on April 15, 2005. The mission ended prematurely, very shortly after an anomalous slow-velocity collision with its target spacecraft, having completed less than half of the original mission autonomous rendezvous objectives.  Mission  DART was launched on a Pegasus rocket into a polar circular parking orbit of and has International Designator 2005-014-A. The craft is and weighs . The maneuvering system comprised 16 nitrogen-fueled thrusters with three hydrazine-fueled thrusters and a reaction control system including six nitrogen-fueled thrusters from the Pegasus fourth stage, which forms an integral part of the craft. The target spacecraft was an OSC MUBLCOM (Multiple-Path Beyond-Line-of-Sight Communications) prototype communications relay satellite weighing approximately launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base on 18 May 1999 with International Designator 1999-026-B. DART spacecraft and Pegasus launch vehicle attached underneath Orbital's L-1011 aircraft After launch, DART successfully achieved orbit and within hours made a rendezvous with the target satellite. The automated systems aboard DART successfully acquired the target and began autonomously approaching it. During proximity operations, multiple malfunctions in navigation, propellant management and collision avoidance programming led to a soft collision with the target and premature destruction and retirement of the DART spacecraft. DART had no capability for interactive piloting from the ground or for uploading new programming after launch, thus all on-orbit operations were directed by DART itself based upon pre-programmed criteria. The launch occurred on April 15, 2005.  Objectives   Automatic orbital transfer maneuvers  The craft autonomously navigated via a series of orbit transfer maneuvers to reach the target satellite. No navigational information was relayed to the vehicle after launch; it navigated autonomously and with GPS.  Proximity operations with AVGS  Once the spacecraft had navigated to the target satellite, it was to have performed a series of proximity maneuvers. The maneuvers would have demonstrated the capabilities of the AVGS (Advanced Video Guidance Sensor). It was planned to demonstrate station keeping, docking axis approach, circumnavigation, and a collision avoidance maneuver. DART would have then departed the vicinity and retired to a final orbit. The entire sequence was to have been accomplished under autonomous control.  Additional demonstrations  * Validate ground test results of the AVGS and proximity-operations algorithms * Provide hardware capabilities for future missions by validating the AVGS in the space environment DART at Vandenberg AFB  Mishap investigation board  NASA convened a mishap investigation board to determine the reason for the DART spacecraft anomaly. First reports pointed to the spacecraft running out of fuel before concluding its mission.(Spaceflightnow) On April 14, 2006 NASA announced that they would not release the investigation's report, citing that the report includes details protected by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. On May 15, 2006 NASA released a public summary of the DART mishap investigation board report (NASA press release). NASA revealed that a critical navigation failure occurred when the DART and MUBLCOM spacecraft were about 200 meters apart, which precluded the full activation of the AVGS and allowed DART to approach MUBLCOM without accurate ranging information. A later failure of the collision avoidance system, which was relying upon inaccurate position and velocity information, allowed DART to ultimately collide with MUBLCOM at a relative speed of approximately 1.5 meters per second. Both spacecraft survived the collision without apparent damage. Throughout the autonomous proximity operations, DART used its limited propellant faster than anticipated, which caused \\"a premature end to the mission\\" 3 minutes 49 seconds after the collision. DART initiated its retirement programming, removed itself from the vicinity of MUBLCOM, and prepared for deorbit. After the collision, MUBLCOM \\"regained its operational status after an automatic system reset\\". The DART Mishap Investigation Board determined that only 11 of the 27 defined mission objectives were partially or fully met, all of which related to the launch, early orbit, rendezvous, departure, and retirement phases. None of the 14 objectives related to the proximity operations phase were met.  Current status  DART re-entered Earth's atmosphere at around 08:32 UTC on May 7, 2016 over the South Pacific.https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/displayTrajectory.action?id=2005-014Ahttps://spaceflight101.com/re- entry/re-entry-dart-autonomous-rendezvous-demonstrator-meets-its-fiery-end/  See also  *Attitude control *Orbital Express *Spacecraft References  External links  * DART at Marshall Space Flight Center * NASA Press release about the DART mishap 16 April 2005 * Mishap overview and description of the cause 15 May 2006 * DART Mishap Investigation Board Final Report January 4, 2007 * NASA DART press kit April 2015 Category:NASA satellites Category:Derelict satellites orbiting Earth Category:Spacecraft launched in 2005 Category:Satellite collisions Category:Spacecraft launched by Pegasus rockets ","title":"DART (satellite)"},{"id":"1104088","text":"John-Michael Tebelak (September 17, 1949 - April 2, 1985) was an American playwright and director. He was best known for creating the musical Godspell, that is based on the Gospel of Saint Matthew. Composer Stephen Schwartz wrote the music for Godspell. Some of the lyrics are original to the show, while others were taken from either the Bible or traditional hymns in the 1940 Episcopal hymnal. Biography  Education and Godspell  Tebelak was born in Berea, Ohio and graduated from Berea High School in 1966. He first produced Godspell as his master's thesis, under Lawrence Carra, at Carnegie Mellon University in December 1970. He had been studying Greek and Roman mythology, but became fascinated by the joy expressed in the Gospels, with the deadline for his thesis two weeks away. He attended an Easter Vigil service in 1970 at Pittsburgh's St. Paul Cathedral, wearing his usual overalls and a T-shirt. A police officer frisked him for drugs after the service. He wrote, of this experience, \\"I left with the feeling that, rather than rolling the rock away from the Tomb, they were piling more on. I went home, took out my manuscript, and worked it to completion in a non-stop frenzy.\\" Though he never completed his coursework at the university, Carnegie Mellon did award him a degree.

Abnormal nipple discharge may be described as any discharge not associated with lactation. The nature of the discharge may range in color, consistency and composition, and occur in one or both breasts. Although it is considered normal in a wide variety of circumstances it is the third major reason involving the breasts for which women seek medical attention, after breast lumps and breast pain. It is also known to occur in adolescent boys and girls going through puberty. Nipple discharge may be milk as a result of pregnancy or hormone problems such as high prolactin. Or it may be due to an underlying breast disease. About 3% of cases are due to cancer. Signs and symptoms Nipple discharge refers to any fluid that seeps out of the nipple of the breast. Discharge from the nipple does not occur in lactating women. And discharge in non-pregnant women or women who are not breastfeeding may not cause concern. Men that have discharge from their nipples are not typical. Discharge from the nipples of men or boys may indicate a problem. Discharge from the nipples can appear without squeezing or may only be noticeable if the nipples are squeezed. One nipple can have discharge while the other does not. The discharge can be clear, green, bloody, brown or straw-colored. The consistency can be thick, thin, sticky or watery. Treatment Initially, an evaluation of malignancy is always indicated. If no abnormality is found, then a surgical duct excision may resolve the symptoms. Treatment also depends on whether single-duct or multiple-duct discharge is present, and whether the symptoms of nipple discharge are distressing to the patient. In some cases, there may be no need for any further intervention; in others, microdochectomy or a total duct excision may be appropriate. If the patient wishes to conserve the ability to breastfeed and only single-duct discharge is present, then ductoscopy or galactography should be considered in view of performing a localised duct excision.

The character has been depicted as part of the supporting cast of Daredevil (Matt Murdock); Foggy is Matt's best friend and, for most of the series, his law partner. The character was created by Stan Lee and Bill Everett. Initially, Foggy was portrayed as a deeply conflicted character, continuously caught between his strong vocational disagreements with Matt, their rivalry for the affections of Karen Page, and his loyalty to his friend. Despite being a highly successful lawyer, he is also tormented by feelings of inferiority to his law partner. However, since the early 1980s he has often been reduced to comic relief, and his down-to- earth, everyman lifestyle acts as a contrast to his grim superhero colleague. For the first couple years of Daredevil, Foggy's appearance greatly varied from issue to issue, though he was most commonly drawn as a trim, handsome, and neatly groomed young man. Since his first portrayal by Gene Colan, in Daredevil #20, he has consistently been drawn as a short, slightly pudgy man with a generally relaxed appearance. He has been portrayed by Jon Favreau in the 2003 film adaptation. Foggy Nelson was also portrayed by Elden Henson in the Marvel Television productions Daredevil, The Defenders, an episode of the second season of Jessica Jones, and an episode of the second season of Luke Cage on Netflix for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Publication history Foggy Nelson first appeared in Daredevil #1 (April 1964), and was created by Stan Lee and Bill Everett. Foggy Nelson received an entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89 #5. Fictional character biography The Beginning Foggy is Matt Murdock's roommate while they study at Columbia Law School. Matt protects Foggy against bullies and helps him study. When Matt begins dating Elektra Natchios, Foggy disapproves, because he thinks she is dangerous. After Elektra leaves the university, Matt and Foggy transfer to Harvard Law School. After graduating, Matt and Foggy open up a private law practice. They hire a secretary, Karen Page,Daredevil #1 (April 1964). with whom both Matt and Foggy fall in love. Foggy soon realizes that Karen is in love with Matt, and sees him as only a friend, dealing a heavy wound to his ego. He's approached by Abner Jonas to be a third-party candidate for district attorney, and in a party given by Jonas, Foggy meets an old high-school classmate, Deborah Harris. He is smitten with her, and she returns his romantic interest.Daredevil #10 (October 1965). However, Daredevil uncovers that Jonas is secretly the criminal mastermind The Organizer, that Debbie is Jonas's lover, and that her flirtation with Foggy was solely a means to get him under their control. Foggy helps foil the Organizer's plans, and Debbie is taken to jail. Nelson is heartbroken and again turns his attentions to Karen Page.Daredevil #11 (December 1965). Foggy, unaware of his partner's double life as a superhero, is suspicious about Matt's sudden and unexplained absences, and his frequent bruises. To avoid those suspicions, Murdock resorts to creating his \\"twin brother\\" Mike Murdock (Matt himself in disguise),Daredevil #25 (February 1967). faking his death, or asking someone else to wear the costume. To Foggy's dismay, Karen becomes as enamored of Mike Murdock as she is of his \\"brother\\" Matt. To further his frustration with Matt, despite Foggy's repeated protests that his preference is for corporate law, his partner favors taking on costumed supervillains as clients, occasionally even leaving Foggy no choice but to represent the supervillain at trial.Daredevil #25-26 District attorney Nelson is again approached to be a candidate for district attorney, this time without hidden agendas: he's really fond of the idea of being able to do something to fight crime actively, and sets himself to work with enthusiasm. Shortly after, Debbie Harris's jail term expires, and she immediately gets in touch with Foggy.Daredevil #36 (January 1968). She and Foggy start to date again, despite Foggy's fears that it would be bad for his campaign to date an ex-convict, as well as his doubts as to the motives for Debbie's interest in him.Daredevil #38 (March 1968). While dating her publicly for the first time since her incarceration, Debbie is ransomed to the Time Continuum by the Unholy trio, led by the Exterminator.Daredevil #39 (April 1968). Foggy and Daredevil investigate, each on his own side. Foggy is made a prisoner by the Exterminator and Daredevil comes to the rescue. A fight ensues and there's an explosion, after which Foggy finds some rags of the DD uniform: it is then assumed that \\"Mike Murdock\\" has died. Debbie returns from the Time Continuum and she and Foggy resume their happy relationship.Daredevil #41 (June 1968). There's a schism between Matt and Foggy, as due to Matt's troubled relationship with Karen, and his own troubles as Daredevil, he doesn't help Foggy in his campaign. Foggy feels abandoned and Matt isn't able to explain without revealing his secret. However, Foggy wins the election,Daredevil #48 (January 1969). the two reconcile and Foggy offers Matt an opportunity to become assistant to the DA. Later, Foggy is blackmailed by the mysterious Mr. Kline, and is forced by him to prosecute the Black Widow, who is defended by Matt.Daredevil #82-84 This again severs their longtime friendship and Matt leaves for San Francisco with the Widow. They again reconcile when Foggy is badly wounded while investigating a criminal conspiracy by Black Spectre, and Matt comes back to New York to help him in his fight against crime.Daredevil #108 The Storefront After losing the re-election for District Attorney to Blake Tower (and a slurring campaign against him by Jester, who had earlier failed to coerce Foggy into ending his campaign for district attorney),Daredevil #42, 127-130 Foggy resumes his career as counselor, again with Matt, in a free clinic called \\"The Storefront\\".Daredevil #131 Becky Blake, a law student, is later hired to work as the firm's secretary.Daredevil #155 (November 1978). Foggy proposes to Debbie, and they are married.Daredevil #166 (September 1980). Elektra is hired by the Kingpin to assassinate Foggy. However, upon confronting Foggy, he recognizes her as \\"Matt's girl\\". Unable to kill Foggy after this, Elektra abandons her assignment, which leads to her death at the hands of Bullseye.Daredevil #181 (April 1982). The decline and fall of Nelson and Murdock Foggy's marriage begins to go sour, as he is an easy going fellow whom his wife wants, unsuccessfully, to transform into a high socialite. The jaded Debbie begins having an affair with Micah Synn, chieftain of a savage tribe,Daredevil #204 (March 1984). and she coerces Foggy to lie in Synn's favor.Daredevil #207, 210. An abusive brute, Synn later takes Debbie prisoner.Daredevil #212 (November 1984). After escaping, she immediately returns to Foggy,Daredevil #213 (December 1984). and he publicly admits his lies in order to denounce Synn's crimes.Daredevil #214 (January 1985). Despite this, their marriage is badly damaged and they eventually divorce. In addition, Foggy's behavior in the Synn case damages the Nelson and Murdock firm's reputation, and Murdock loses interest in his work and devotes more time to his costumed career. Foggy can't fight alone against the lack of clients and the cascading of bills, and the Nelson & Murdock premises are closed down. Foggy is so depressed that he considers suicide, but after he is caught in a fight between the Vulture and Daredevil, the immediacy of death makes him realize that he much prefers to be alive.Daredevil #225 (December 1985). Following a bad breakup with Matt and a robbery of her apartment, Glorianna O'Breen turns to Foggy for comfort; he reassures her but rejects her romantic advances out of loyalty to Matt. At the same time, Matt is accused of paying a witness to perjure himself, and Foggy acts as his attorney. Despite a frameup by the Kingpin himself, Foggy gets Matt released without jail time.Daredevil #227 (February 1986). After the trial, Matt disappears and the Kingpin, impressed by Foggy's performance at the trial, has him hired through one of his firms, Kelco. With Matt gone, Foggy begins dating Glorianna while working on an appeal to have Murdock's law license reinstated.Daredevil #228-233 As Kelco's attorney, Nelson defends the company against charges from a boy who was blinded by toxic waste they deposited in rivers.Daredevil #248, 250-251, 255. Glorianna is disillusioned with and eventually leaves him.Daredevil #290 (March 1991). Foggy quits his job with Kelco when he learns that the company is owned by the Kingpin.Daredevil #256 (July 1988). He and Matt are later reunited,Daredevil #291 (April 1991). and he helps Matt win back his law license.Daredevil #300 (January 1992). When Daredevil's identity is outed to the press by an assistant of Ben Urich, Murdock fakes his death.Daredevil #325 (February 1994). Karen and Foggy later find Matt still alive, in a state of stupor, in his yellow Daredevil uniform but without the mask.Daredevil #347 Foggy finally realizes Matt's secret identity. They reconcile and become law partners again. \\"Sharpe, Nelson & Murdock\\" Rosalind Sharpe, a famous and controversial Boston attorney, offers for Nelson and Murdock to become her associates. It is later revealed that Rosalind Sharpe is Nelson's biological mother: she divorced her husband and abandoned her son in order to be able to pursue her career as a lawyer. It was Sharpe's career that enticed her son to become a lawyer. Foggy starts dating Liz Allan, remaining with her through such moments as the 'resurrection' of her father- in-law Norman Osborn.Peter Parker: Spider-Man #75 Later, the villain Mysterio manipulates him into having an affair with another woman, and then makes it appear Nelson murdered the woman after the affair (which Foggy can't remember clearly as he was drugged by Mysterio). Liz visits Foggy in prison, where he Foggy confesses to cheating on her, and she leaves him. After the machinations by Mysterio are disclosed, Foggy is set free, but he feels bad about having failed Liz, and doesn't attempt to resume the relationship.Daredevil (vol. 2) #8 Sharpe fires Foggy, as she doesn't want the murder affair to bring bad publicity to the firm. When Matt Murdock starts preparing Foggy's defense, she orders him to stand down, resulting in Matt quitting the firm out of disgust.Daredevil (vol. 2) #2 Foggy personally counsels superheroes on diverse occasions, such as when he takes the case of the superhero Vance Astrovik, who killed his abusive father in a fit of rage. Foggy loses the case, as his opposition convinces the jury that Vance could have stopped his father without killing him.

Post-Secret Wars After the reconstruction of reality, Matt assists the Purple Children ‚Äì the children of his old foe the Purple Man, who have inherited their father's powers ‚Äì and in return, they erase all public knowledge that Matt Murdock is Daredevil. The only person Matt re-reveals his identity to is Foggy, who occasionally resents the pressure this puts him under. Other versions 1872 During the \\"Secret Wars\\" storyline, a Wild West version of Foggy Nelson resides in the Battleworld domain of the Valley of Doom. Franklin Nelson works as a judge in the town of Timely.

MC2 In MC2, Foggy Nelson marries Liz Allan and is the stepfather to Norman \\"Normie\\" Osborn III. He has outlived Murdock, who has been murdered. (though his soul lives on in Darkdevil.) Foggy acts as counsel to Wilson Fisk, but he quits when he learns that Fisk was responsible for Murdock's death. After Liz's death, Foggy buries himself in his work and he blames himself when Normie goes temporarily insane, taking the mantle of the Green Goblin again. After Normie reforms, the two finally bond. When Normie gets engaged to the former supervillain Raptor, Foggy disapproves and feels guilty when Normie is once again temporarily transformed into a supervillain. Darkdevil works as an intern at Nelson's law firm and gives legal advice to Normie and Raptor. Foggy is unaware of Darkdevil's ties to Murdock and Spider-Man. Ultimate Marvel In the Ultimate Marvel universe, Foggy is Matthew Murdock's college roommate. In Ultimate Spider-Man Annual #2, an adult Foggy Nelson talks with Spider-Man. He made a brief appearance in Ultimates 2 as part of a legal team, with Murdock, representing Bruce Banner in a case against him for his actions as the Hulk. He later shows up after the events of cataclysm to inform S.H.I.E.L.D director Monica Chang that the U.S. government has decided to dismantle S.H.I.E.L.D and will be holding Chang responsible for her failure to prevent the mass destruction which occurred after Galactus's attack of Earth. In other media Television * The 1989 TV movie The Trial of The Incredible Hulk, was an unsuccessful backdoor pilot for a Daredevil spinoff series. An unnamed and un-credited character appeared in an early scene who was identified as Matt Murdock's partner in the law firm. Although this character had minimal dialogue, presumably, he would have been established as Foggy Nelson had the spin-off series been greenlighted. * Foggy Nelson appears in several Marvel's Netflix TV shows, portrayed by Elden Henson: **Foggy appears in Daredevil. In the first season, Foggy meets Matt when they are roommates at Columbia Law School, and quickly become best friends. He also begins dating Marci Stahl (Amy Rutberg), another law student. While interning at Landman & Zack, Matt becomes disgusted by the firm's treatment of a terminally ill patient being sued by one of the firm's clients for breach of confidentiality and convinces Foggy that they should quit and start their own firm in Hell's Kitchen to fight for 'the little guy'. Matt and Foggy's friendship falters after he discovers Matt bleeding out from an ambush attack by Nobu and Wilson Fisk, but they reconcile by the season finale. Early in the season, Foggy also learns that Marci has joined Landman & Zack, and later persuades her into helping Nelson & Murdock after he and Matt discover that her partners at L&Z; are working for Fisk. In the second season, Foggy and Matt take the case for the defense of Frank Castle against crooked district attorney Samantha Reyes despite the potential effect it could have on their firm given Frank's actions. They lose the case, which, along with the strain of Matt's double-life as Daredevil, ruins their firm, but Foggy is recognized positively for his efforts in the case and opening statement (which he made up on the spot due to Matt's tardiness) and Jeri Hogarth hires him on at Hogarth, Chao & Benowitz on a recommendation from Marci, who joined the firm after Fisk was arrested. Matt encourages him to take it and move on from Nelson & Murdock, saying he deserves better than what Matt offered. ** Foggy appears in The Defenders. Since leaving Nelson & Murdock, Foggy has cut his hair short into a more corporate slicked-back appearance, and he and Marci are back to dating full-time. He is introduced in the first episode, where it is revealed that Claire hired him to defend Luke Cage and clear him of all his charges. Later on, Foggy meets Matt for drinks at Josie's and outsources case work to him. Hogarth tasks Foggy with keeping an eye on Jessica Jones after her investigation of John Raymond attracts major police scrutiny, a matter that Foggy in turn passes off to Matt. When the Hand begin threatening and going after the Defenders' loved ones, Matt has Karen and Foggy shelter with Trish, Malcolm, Claire, and Colleen in the 29th Precinct until the threat passes. After Elektra captures Danny and kills Stick, the other three Defenders are picked up by the cops for questioning at the precinct. Foggy is quick to caution Matt about the risk of his two lives colliding and how it is necessary that the NYPD only see Matt as a lawyer. Since he has faith in Matt, he also secretly sneaks back to Matt's apartment to give him his Daredevil suit. When Matt is seemingly killed in the destruction of Midland Circle, Foggy and Karen are devastated, and the two of them later have a private vigil in Matt's church. ** Foggy appears in the second season of Jessica Jones. When Chao and Benowitz try to force Jeri out over her prior behavior in the debacle with her former secretary and Kilgrave (under the pretense of her recent ALS diagnosis), Foggy offers to help Jeri fight back against her partners, but Jeri angrily tells him to mind his own business and not get involved in her personal problems. Although he is not seen or mentioned again, a conversation Hogarth is having on the phone with realtors in the season 2 finale implies that Foggy and Marci will be joining her at her new law firm. ** Foggy appears in the second season of Luke Cage. Luke calls upon Foggy to help him out when he's sued for assaulting Dontrell \\"Cockroach\\" Hamilton with Benjamin Donovan representing him. Foggy encourages Luke to take up an offer to attend a fundraiser with Piranha Jones, who is offering Luke $150,000 to appear. Foggy is last seen helping the wounded after the party gets attacked by Bushmaster's gang, although dialogue in later episodes establishes that he was unharmed. After Mariah Dillard is arrested, Luke later calls Foggy to request Big Ben Donovan's cell number so that he can arrange a visit with Mariah. ** In the third season of Daredevil, Foggy runs for District Attorney with the encouragement of Marci, as a way of finding purpose in his life without Matt around. Things between him and Karen are strained at the start of the season as Karen continues to hold out hope that Matt is still alive. The third season also introduces Foggy's family, who are established to run a butcher shop named Nelson's Meats. Film * Foggy Nelson appears in Daredevil, portrayed by Jon Favreau. The character's background and relationship with Matt Murdock are faithful to the comics, but his personality greatly differs. In the film, Foggy is much more ambitious and has no reservations about taking on clients who he suspects are guilty. The Director's Cut DVD version includes many additional scenes rounding out the two characters and their friendship.

History Ealrly life She had two younger siblings: Domitia Lepida Minor and Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (cos. AD 32). The date of her birth is not recorded and can be only estimated as no later than 7 BC, but possibly as much as 10 years earlier, if one would allow a long delay between her birth and those of her two siblings. Marriages Domitia was likely married to a cousin of Sejanus named Quintus Junius Blaesus with whom she had a son named Junius Blaesus who served as a governor under emperor Vitellius. She married the consul Decimus Haterius Agrippa, who died in 32 as a victim of Tiberius' reign of terror. Domitia bore Agrippa a son, Quintus Haterius Antoninus (cos. AD 53) in approximately 20. In 33 Domitia married the witty, wealthy, and influential Gaius Sallustius Crispus Passienus. Crispus was the adopted grandson and biological great-great nephew of the historian Sallust. After January 41, Crispus divorced Domitia, so he could marry Domitia's former sister-in-law Agrippina the Younger, who had recently returned from exile. Thereby, Crispus became the stepfather of Agrippina's son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (Nero), who was Domitia's nephew. Crispus soon died mysteriously, leaving a fortune to Agrippina and her son. Later life During the reigns of Caligula, Claudius and Nero, Domitia was an influential rival to Agrippina. In June 59, she died while confined to a bed with severe constipation. Nero was visiting her at the time, and she commented that when he shaved his beard (a Roman symbolic act, usually performed during a ceremony at the age of twenty-one), she would gladly die peacefully. Nero turned to those with him and joked, \\"I'll take it off at once.\\" According to a rumor, he then ordered the doctors to administer a fatal dose of laxative to his aunt and seized her property while she was dying. Modern scholars such as Miriam T. Griffin distrust the claim that Nero poisoned her. References * (edd.), Prosopographia Imperii Romani saeculi I, II et III, Berlin, 1933 - .

The tournament is sponsored by the American Forensic Association with the Ford Motor Company Fund. History of the NDT The National Debate Tournament (NDT) began in 1947 at the United States Military Academy at West Point. Twenty-nine schools competed at the first NDT debating: \\"Resolved: That labor should be given a direct share in the management of industry\\". It remained at West Point through 1966, at which time the Tournament Director met with the district chairs and advised them that at the tournament banquet of the Military Academy's decision to discontinue hosting the NDT in the ensuing years in part because of the increased demands on space and money that the United States' growing involvement in the Vietnam War was placing on the Academy. Since then the tournament has moved to different member schools each year and only three schools have hosted it twice. In the first NDT, teams were nominated by committees from their district. This was soon replaced with district qualifying tournaments. Eight, post district tournament, \\"second round\\" at- large bids were awarded beginning in 1968 and continuing through 1970, enlarging the field to 44 teams, and two of these second round selections \\"cleared\\", or finished in the top sixteen in the preliminary rounds, in 1968, three cleared in 1969 and four of the eight post district tournament qualifiers cleared in 1970. Prior to 1970, a school could only send one team to the NDT, but the tournament committee relented to pressure from some of the more successful programs and a total of eight schools sent two teams to the 1970 National Debate Tournament that year. The winner of that tournament, designated Kansas \\"B\\", would not have been eligible to participate if the one team per school rule had remained in force. In 1971, the format was amended to assign seventeen at large bids prior to district qualifying tournaments followed by the selection of an additional 27 teams by the district tournaments and another eight in a second at large selection round, enlarging the field to 52 teams. Ten regular season tournaments were designated to be \\"qualifying tournaments\\", such that winning one earned that team an automatic NDT berth, and the remainder of the first at-large round teams were selected by vote of the selection committee. That format lasted for just two years. Starting in 1973 and continuing to the present, sixteen at large bids are awarded to teams based on records prior to the district tournament selections, and additional at-large bids are awarded after the district qualifying tournaments. The field was enlarged to 62 teams in 1973 and stayed that size until 1987, when it was enlarged to include 74 teams, and it then varied in size from 72 to 78 teams over the next decade. Since 1992, a limited number of schools, currently six, have been allowed to send a third team. Mutual preference judging (MPJ) was adopted by the NDT two and a half decades ago. Under MPJ, each debate team ranks the judging pool according to their preferences and judges are selected such that both teams prefer the chosen judge equally (if possible). Under earlier systems, debaters ranked judges into categories; for the last decade, an ordinal system has been adopted in which each judge is ranked from most to least preferred. Algorithms have been developed that create judge assignments that maximize preference and mutuality, optimizing assignment first for teams with three losses, then teams with two losses, then teams with one loss, then undefeated teams, and finally teams with more than three losses (and who therefore are ineligible for elimination rounds). Selection of Teams Currently, selection of the 78 teams participating at the NDT involves a three stage process. First, the national committee selects 16 teams and awards them a First Round At-Large Bid. These teams have been ranked by their seasonal performance to have been the top debate teams in the nation. The national committee then apportions 46 bids to each of the nine NDT Districts. Each district is free to decide how these bids will be awarded to teams within each district. Most, although not all, districts decide to hold a district tournament, where the top teams will receive a bid. The final and third step for qualification is the Second Round At-Large Bid. Similar to a First Round Bid, the national committee selects the top 16 teams not already qualified to fill out the field for the NDT. Although in some cases, these final 16 teams may not be the true best 16 teams not already qualified to the tournament. The NDT has a standing rule stating a school cannot qualify more than two teams to the tournament, with the exception of at most six schools per year, who are allowed to qualify a third team, if the third team in question has shown merit for selection. Traditions *\\"The Big Board\\": Started at the first NDT, complete results for each team are listed on the \\"Big Board\\" in the central area, horse-race style. *Orally announcing pairings: Started at the first NDT, the pairings for each round are read out loud to the contestants. The announcements are known for the unusual manner in which they are conveyed. For instance, the announcer might say, \\"The 51st National Debate Tournament, round the first.\\" This is then followed by the \\"pairings\\" of opposing teams, judges, room numbers, and the expected start time. A poll conducted at the 2005 NDT showed strong support for continuing this tradition. *Cadet escorts: Cadets at the USMA escort debaters to their rounds and carry their tubs. Although this tradition was discontinued when the NDT moved from the USMA, it has reemerged at the regular season tournament hosted by the USMA.  Winners   Past Resolutions  The National Debate Tournament currently debates the topic selected by the Cross Examination Debate Association, but used to debate its own, separate, topic. Wake Forest University maintains a list of earlier resolutions used at the National Debate Tournament.

Large iron meteorite falls have been witnessed and fragments recovered but never before, in recorded history, a fall of this magnitude. An estimated 23 tonnes of fragments survived the fiery passage through the atmosphere and reached the Earth. The fragments are dwarfed by the 1920-published meteorite find of the roughly 80,000-year-old landing of the Hoba meteorite, weighing 60 tonnes.  Impact  The 10th anniversary stamp. It reproduces a painting by P. J. Medvedev. At around 10:30 on 12 February 1947, eyewitnesses in the Sikhote-Alin Mountains, Primorye, Soviet Union, observed a large bolide brighter than the sun that came out of the north and descended at an angle of about 41 degrees. The bright flash and the deafening sound of the fall were observed for around the point of impact not far from Luchegorsk and approximately northeast of Vladivostok. A smoke trail, estimated at long, remained in the sky for several hours. As the meteor, traveling at a speed of about , entered the atmosphere, it began to break apart, and the fragments fell together. At an altitude of about , the largest mass apparently broke up in a violent explosion called an air burst. On November 20, 1957 the Soviet Union issued a stamp for the 10th anniversary of the Sikhote-Alin meteorite shower. It reproduces a painting by P. I. Medvedev, a Soviet artist who witnessed the fall: he was sitting in his window starting a sketch when the fireball appeared, so he immediately began drawing what he saw.  Orbit  Because the meteor fell during daytime, it was observed by many eyewitnesses. Evaluation of this observational data allowed V. G. Fesenkov, then chairman of the meteorite committee of the USSR Academy of Science, to estimate the meteoroid's orbit before it encountered the Earth. This orbit was ellipse-shaped, with its point of greatest distance from the sun situated within the asteroid belt, similar to many other small bodies crossing the orbit of the Earth. Such an orbit was probably created by collisions within the asteroid belt.  Size  Sikhote-Alin is a massive fall with the pre-atmospheric mass of the meteoroid estimated at approximately . A more recent estimate by Tsvetkov (and others) puts the mass at around . Krinov had estimated the post-atmospheric mass of the meteoroid at some .  Strewn field and craters  The strewn field for this meteorite covered an elliptical area of about . Some of the fragments made impact craters, the largest of which was about across and deep. Fragments of the meteorite were also driven into the surrounding trees.  Composition and classification  Section The Sikhote-Alin meteorite is classified as an iron meteorite belonging to the meteorite group IIAB and with a coarse octahedrite structure. It is composed of approximately 93% iron, 5.9% nickel, 0.42% cobalt, 0.46% phosphorus, and 0.28% sulfur, with trace amounts of germanium and iridium. Minerals present include taenite, plessite, troilite, chromite, kamacite, and schreibersite. Specimens Specimens of the Sikhote-Alin Meteorite are basically of two types: # individual, thumbprinted or regmaglypted specimens, showing fusion crust and signs of atmospheric ablation # shrapnel or fragmented specimens, sharp-edged pieces of torn metal showing evidence of violent fragmentation The first type probably broke off the main object early in the descent. These pieces are characterized by regmaglypts (cavities resembling thumb prints) in the surface of each specimen. The second type are fragments which were either torn apart during the atmospheric explosions or blasted apart upon impact on the frozen ground. Most were probably the result of the explosion at altitude. A large specimen is on display in Moscow. Many other specimens are held by Russian Academy of Science and many smaller specimens exist in the collectors' market.

The two vehicles involved in the project were the Boeing X-45 and Northrop Grumman X-47. J-UCAS was managed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. In the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review, it was stated that the J-UCAS program would be terminated and instead a new long-range strategic bomber program, \\"Next-Generation Bomber\\", for the Air Force has been launched.\\"Pentagon Sets Plan For New Bomber, Terminates J-UCAS Program\\", GlobalSecurity.org, 13 January 2006 The program was revitalized into a Navy-only program named UCAS-D.\\"Carrier UCAVs: The Return of UCAS\\", Defense Industry Daily, 7 February 2010 History It is unusual for DARPA to be involved with advanced development programs; the agency normally performs proof-of-concept demonstrations and then hands follow-on programs on to interested military services. Apparently this arrangement was driven from the office of the secretary of defense, the idea being that DARPA would be able to keep the development effort on track until advanced demonstrators were available, and then the program would have so much momentum that it would keep on going. The long list of US military UAV programs that have been bungled and dropped after much expense and effort, with some of them like the Hunter ending up effectively reaching operational service in spite of it, provoked the decision. Of course, the candidates for the J-UCAS program included developments of the follow-ons to the Boeing X-45A and the Northrop Grumman X-47 Pegasus. DARPA and Boeing had been working on the \\"X-45B\\", a scaled-up X-45A that was seen as the prototype for an operational machine that would reach service in 2008, and would carry a 1,590 kilogram (3,500 pound) warload to a combat radius of 1,665 kilometers (900 nautical miles). Two were to be built, but before any metal could be bent for the two X-45B prototypes planned, the Air Force redirected the effort to an even more capable machine, the \\"X-45C\\". The X-45C, as currently envisioned, will be a flying wing powered by a single F404-GE-102D turbofan engine. Current specs include: The payload and range specifications are as defined by J-UCAS requirements. The operational radius specification is for a strike to a predefined target and back home again. A secondary range specification dictates a two-hour loiter capability at a radius of 1,850 kilometers (1,000 NMI). Partly because of the pressure from Boeing, in the summer of 2003, Northrop Grumman formed an alliance with Lockheed Martin to help develop the \\"X-47B\\", a follow-on to the X-47 that would compete against Boeing efforts. The alliance, which repeats the successful teamup that won the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter effort, is focused on building a modular stealthy UCAV that could be adapted to a wide range of missions. It would have a speed of Mach 0.8 at 10,670 meters (35,000 feet) and endurance of up to 12 hours. The goal of the J-UCAS effort is to select a single contractor to provide from 10 to 12 machines for operational evaluation in the 2007-2008 time frame. Current plans are to obtain two X-45Cs and two X-47Bs to perform a comparative evaluation and then select a winner for development in the 2010 time frame. Specifications for the J-UCAS are still evolving. Right now, both services envision a stealthy machine with a pricetag of $10 to US$15 million, which is actually modest for a sophisticated stealthy combat aircraft. The USAF envisions that J-UCAS will feature: * Stores pylons on the wings for external fuel tanks or additional munitions. * Mid-air refueling capability. * A narrow field-of-view SAR-MTI system for targeting and post-strike damage assessment. The USAF has envisioned an operational UCAV as being stored in broken-down form inside a container that can be airlifted, with the UCAV having a specified \\"shelf life\\" of 20 years. It would be removed from the container every few years for inspections and could be checked with an electronic test system. The Air Force would also like to use an operational UCAV as the basis of a \\"penetrating jammer\\" platform that would penetrate enemy airspace to blind hostile radars. It would replace the Grumman EA-6B Prowler manned electronic warfare aircraft in this role. A reconnaissance payload is also being considered. However, the Air Force wants to focus on the strike role first. Over the long term, the Air Force is interested in using a UCAV as a platform to carry directed-energy weapons, initially a \\"high power microwave (HPM)\\" weapon to fry adversary electronic systems. The HPM weapon would be \\"fired\\" out an aperture on the front of the aircraft, with electronic steering used to direct the beam over an arc covering about 45 degrees to either side of the UCAV. The HPM weapon could be followed by a high power laser weapon. The Navy is interested in many of the features on the Air Force wish list, though the Navy has put reconnaissance and jamming at the top of the list and strike at the bottom, and seems to be indifferent to the containerization concept. Of course, a navalized UCAV would have a stronger airframe and landing gear for carrier takeoffs and landings; an arresting hook; and avionics for automated carrier approach and landing, along with a \\"relative navigation system\\" that will tell the UCAV where it is relative to the carrier. A big concern of program officials is to ensure that widespread use of UCAVs does not increase the number of friendly fire incidents or collateral damage to civilian targets. The evaluation program will investigate this matter in detail. One of the concepts now being given considerable thought is use of a manned aircraft, such as an F-15E Strike Eagle, as a UCAV \\"mothership\\", with the weapons systems officer in the back seat directing one or more UCAVs over high-speed datalink.

It differs from classical imperialism in two ways: it involves a much smaller commitment of resources, and it does not involve new settlement by the imperial power. The term was first popularized by Canadian author Michael Ignatieff in his book Empire Lite: Nation-Building in Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan (2003). Here and in other writings, Ignatieff identifies the author of empire lite as the United States, the world's last military superpower. The purpose of empire lite, Ignatieff believes, is to build a global \\"humanitarian empire\\" of free, self- governing countries through long-term nation building ‚Äî including the use of military force ‚Äî in failed or failing states. Ignatieff supported the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 because he saw it as one such intervention, a step he later regretted.

The state government's electorate is Blue Mountains and the state member is Labor's Trisha Lee Doyle. Federally, the electorate is Macquarie and the federal member is Labor's Susan Templeman. Warrimoo is located 75 kilometres west of Sydney, in the local government area of the City of Blue Mountains. Local council Mayor is Labor's Mark Greenhill. Warrimoo borders the townships/suburbs of Blaxland, Mount Riverview, Sun Valley and Valley Heights. The suburb is 5 train stops from Penrith and 11 train stops to Katoomba. Population The population of Warrimoo is mostly European background. Languages apart from English spoken in Warrimoo include French, Mandarin, Greek, Spanish and Italian. 31 per cent of residents hold bachelor's degrees or higher and 30% are professionals. More than 35% claim to have no religious affiliation. The median weekly household income is $2,097. Local Services Warrimoo railway station At the centre of Warrimoo is railway station (with bike racks) and Warrimoo Citizens Hall. There are several shops around the train station including a post office, fire station, cafe, car mechanic, antique shops, Italian restaurant/venue hire and an old fashioned general store which is a popular tourist bus stop off point for groups heading to Katoomba and the Jenolan Caves. Other local businesses include: * Blue Mountains Driving School * Blue Sky music recording studio * Sky Valley Studio * Dance Empire dance studio * The Craft Company * Warrimoo Kitchens The closest shopping mall is Westfield Penrith.

Transport Warrimoo railway station is on the Blue Mountains Line of the NSW TrainLink intercity network. Warrimoo is also serviced by bus through Blue Mountains Transit and uber. The original 1918 Warrimoo station burnt down in a bushfire in the 1950s and was subsequently rebuilt. A decision by the NSW Liberal government to buy new South Korean made trains has resulted in controversy over Warrimoo's train station which may need renovating to accommodate the trains that are up to 205 metres long. Added to that, the train tracks may also need adjusting. Western Sydney Airport is due to open in 2026 with a train link via Parramatta. Schools/childcare Warrimoo is served by a private childcare facility (Bush babies), small public school on Florabella Rd (Warrimoo Public School) and a K-12 a private school (Wycliffe). Other nearby schools include Blue Mountains Grammar School, Springwood High and Blaxland High. Culture Blinky Bill mural Author and illustrator Dorothy Wall, who lived in Florabella St (1934‚Äì37), placed Warrimoo on the map with her children's books about the mischievous koala, Blinky Bill. Polish born film maker Yoram Gross, turned the books into movies bringing the iconic character onto the world stage. Blinky Bill is not the only koala bear story written by a Blue Mountains resident. Not far away is the Norman Lindsay Gallery and Museum in Faulconbridge. Norman Lindsay wrote about Bunyip Bluegum, the anthropomorphic koala star of well known children's book, The Magic Pudding which was also turned into a movie, directed by Karl Zwicky. Former Daily Telegraph journalist and founding 'House and Garden' editor Beryl Guertner, lived in Warrimoo. There are local music and choir groups that are community run such as the Moo Choir, which meets and performs out of the Warrimoo Public School hall, and the biannual music group, the Sound Lounge. George Finey, who was a cartoonist on the Daily Telegraph also spent time living in Warrimoo. University and TAFE Western Sydney University has a campus in Penrith, 5 train stops away. Blue Mountains TAFE colleges are in Wentworth Falls, Katoomba, Nepean and Penrith. Bushwalking The Florabella Pass Track is a popular and scenic nature walk from Warrimoo into Blaxland and passes through abundant foliage, creeks and rare wildlife. The bush walk leads into a thick rainforest filled with Lyrebirds, Flame Robins, Sulphur-Crested Cockatoos, Gang Gang Cockatoos, Owls and other rare species. The Pippas Pass portion of the track is renowned for its colourful bushland such as flannel flowers, Waratah plants and pink angophoras and its shelter caves. The walk is less than 9 km however involves some steep hiking. There are many other bushwalking tracks. The Wilderness Society and other environmental groups encourage koala sightings to be reported due to their endangered existence. History Warrimoo is an Aboriginal word meaning eagle's nest or place of the screaming white bird.\\"Origin of Blue Mountains Town Names\\" Blue Mountains City Council In 1898, a railway station platform named Karabah (meaning 'large garden' in Armenian) was built in the area to service a developing estate, possibly sharing the same name. It had closed before World War I, but in 1918 a new station was built, not much further down the Blue Mountains line, named Warrimoo. Entrepreneur and developer, Arthur Rickard was behind the development of Warrimoo. His plan was to subdivide blocks so there were a mixture of small blocks and larger blocks which he established to promote sustainable living. On what was known as the Warrimoo Estate, Rickard encouraged residents to develop orchards, vegetable gardens and raise chickens. Warrimoo retains many historical homes and buildings throughout the village including a distillery (where the local public school now sits) and a former 'Bordillo'. Charity worker and gospeller George Ardill, moved to Warrimoo in his latter years. He lived at 13 Florabella rd. During his years there, Ardill built numerous homes along Florabella st and The Avenue which he set up for homeless women and children.

The program is broadcast live every weekday, from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. ET. The show is produced in the New York City studios of radio station WOR and is sometimes transmitted via ISDN from Hannity's home in Centre Island, New York. The show is now syndicated by Premiere Networks, a subsidiary of iHeartMedia, on terrestrial radio affiliates across the United States, and the Sirius XM Patriot channel 125. The primary focus of the program is the politics of the day, with interviews of liberal and conservatives commentators. The Sean Hannity Show is the second most-listened to commercial radio show with millions of listeners, behind only The Rush Limbaugh Show. Syndication Show host Sean Hannity in 2004 Syndication began through the ABC Radio Networks on September 10, 2001, one day before the September 11 attacks. The program is carried on WSB in Atlanta, Georgia (third hour delayed two hours), KFYI in Phoenix, Arizona, WOKV in Jacksonville, Florida, WDTK in Detroit, WCBM in Baltimore, Maryland and WKRC in Cincinnati, Ohio, among others. The show is carried in most markets by a Citadel Broadcasting radio station; the show is owned by Citadel Broadcasting, which acquired the ABC Radio networks in 2006. Hannity's first version of his radio show was in the late 1980s as a volunteer broadcaster for the University of California, Santa Barbara's radio station, KCSB-FM. He was dismissed from the station in 1989, following a controversial interview about AIDS in which he insulted a lesbian caller. Later, Hannity would bring his program to WVNN in Athens, Alabama and NewsRadio WGST in Atlanta, Georgia. Hannity is the second highest rated talk program, only behind The Rush Limbaugh Show, which leads into Hannity on many stations. The show is carried on 530 stations. He is a three-time consecutive winner of Radio & Records National Talk Show Host of The Year Award from 2003-2005, as well as the National Association of Broadcasters' 2003, 2004 and 2005 Marconi awards for Talk Show Host of the Year, and the Talkers Magazine 2017 Freedom of Speech Award. In 2004, Hannity signed a US$25 million, five- year contract extension with ABC Radio to continue the show through 2009; however, ABC Radio's acquisition by Citadel Broadcasting on June 12, 2007 gave Hannity an opportunity to leave one year after the acquisition. In July 2008, it was announced that Hannity's show would be co-managed by Citadel's ABC Radio Networks and Premiere Radio Networks, a division of Clear Channel Communications. Premiere Radio would handle advertising sales and distribution to all non-Citadel owned stations, including Clear Channel-owned stations. Hannity already had agreements with approximately 80 Clear Channel stations in a separate agreement. The two networks would cooperate for special circumstances. Radio show The show primarily features a mixture of monologues, conversations with callers, and interviews with those in the news. Content Hannity's frequent political targets include terrorism, illegal immigration, weapon of mass destruction in Iraq, and the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. He frequently characterizes American liberalism as a movement more in line with democratic socialism than classical liberalism.Is the John Birch Society \\"Liberal\\"? Alan Scholl. February 1, 2007 The show frequently features \\"man on the street\\" interviews (Man On The Street Thursday), where New York pedestrians are stopped and questioned about politics. Hannity will sometimes debate the answers with participants. The show also features the occasional inclusion of behind the scenes staff, including producers Elisha, Lynda, \\"Sweet Baby\\" James, and animal-rights proponent \\"Flipper\\". \\"Gregster\\" is the engineer who typically plays the audio clips. The show used to close daily with the segment \\"Trash the Lines\\" where calls were taken unscreened, with callers given approximately five seconds to say whatever they wanted. The segment, which had its roots in a late-night show Hannity hosted earlier in his career, has been used less frequently since the summer of 2006. Following the election victory of Democrat Barack Obama, Hannity has hyperbolically referred to his show as \\"conservatism in exile\\", \\"the conservative resistance,\\" \\"the conservative underground.\\" Opening themes Each hour of The Sean Hannity Show used to open with the following musical pieces, in order: 1\\\\. The introduction (iterated twice) spliced with the second singing of the refrain of \\"Independence Day\\" performed by Martina McBride. 2\\\\. Carmina Burana (Orff), over which announcer Scott Shannon traditionally proclaimed, \\"From coast to coast, from border to border, from sea to shining sea, Sean Hannity is on!\\" The quote usually spilled over into the opening riff of \\"Eye of the Tiger\\" by Survivor and Carmina Burana is also used in \\"Glory\\" & \\"Jackass: The Movie\\". However, neither Carmina Burana nor Shannon's traditional voiceover is now in use. The show has frequently changed its opening voiceover to reflect current events. 3\\\\. The instrumental opening to \\"The Way It Is\\" performed by Bruce Hornsby and the Range, over which Hannity begins speaking. This has not been used in recent broadcasts. Occasionally on the third hour, \\"Eye of the Tiger\\" by Survivor would replace both Carmina Burana and \\"The Way It Is\\", with Shannon announcing, \\"Overlooking Madison Square Garden, deep in the heart of midtown Manhattan, the last beacon of truth in a troubled time! This is The Sean Hannity Show and the world- famous Final Hour Free-for-All!\\" Sometimes during election years, an additional announcement was made after Carmina Burana, proclaiming the edition to be \\"a special edition of The Sean Hannity Show: The Battle for America,\\" featuring a countdown until Election Day. On Election Day 2007 (November 6, 2007), the \\"special edition\\" message counted down the days that remained until the 2008 Iowa Caucus (January 3, 2008), \\"Super Tuesday\\" (February 5, 2008), and Election Day (November 4, 2008). As of mid-2011, the show's opening sequence is: # The second refrain of \\"Independence Day\\" # A variety of quotes (which change every week or two, depending on current events) by Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Occupy Wall Street protesters, and/or other liberal figures # Scott Shannon announcing, \\"Freedom is back in style. Welcome to the revolution.\\" # The line \\"'cause we'll put a boot in your ass / it's the American way\\" from Toby Keith's \\"Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American)\\" # Shannon again, saying, \\"This is The Sean Hannity Show!\\" In mid-2014, \\"Independence Day\\" was retired and replaced by \\"This Is How We Roll\\" by Florida Georgia Line as the show's theme song. The \\"Hate-Hannity Hotline\\" Hannity provides a phone line for people who disagree with him to call in. He plays some of these clips at the beginning of the bottom half-hour segment of the show. He usually supplements these clips with the explanation that he is performing a service to the American people by \\"Absorbing the hate and bitterness of the angry left so that they will be nicer to you when you meet them along your way.\\" This has appeared with less frequency in the radio show, though on the revamped Hannity on the Fox News Channel, this has become a regular segment (usually airing on Thursday). Guest hosts WABC personality Mark Levin frequently filled in for Hannity during the host's absence until Levin obtained his own syndicated program. Guest hosts have included Barry Farber, Mike Gallagher, Curtis Sliwa, Kirby Wilbur, Dennis Miller, and Mark Simone. Guests on his show The frequent guests on his radio show included John McCain, Rudy Giuliani, Mike Huckabee, Newt Gingrich, Mitt Romney, Bobby Jindal, Fred Thompson and other politicians from both sides of the political aisle. Book club The Hannity show also has a book club with author interviews and discussions on topics. More recent books have included Strategery by Bill Sammon and Fight Back by G. Gordon Liddy. Hannity has also authored three New York Times bestsellers on politics and current events. Show website Hannity's website offers subscribers to the \\"Hannity Insider\\" subscription service live and recorded streaming audio of the program, available for download to an iPod or other MP3 player. In addition, the program was added to the Armed Forces Radio Network in December 2005. Audio streams of The Sean Hannity Show average more than 190,000 subscribed listeners per month. There is also Hannidate, a chat room for conservative singles, both heterosexual and gay. The website also includes a forum to discuss political topics. Respectful conversation and debate is encouraged.Hannidate website See also *Alan Colmes *Hannity *Hannity & Colmes * Hannity's America References External links  Show ratings via Talkers Magazine *

It is attached to the southwestern rim of the larger, eroded Vasco da Gama formation, and to the southeast of the crater Einstein. The crater was observed for the first time in 1963 by Arthus and Ewen Whitaker in the book Rectified Lunar Atlas. The rim of Bohr is worn and eroded, and a pair of small, bowl-shaped craters lies across the western rim.

His pen name is a tribute to his magnum opus, a rendering of the Mahabharata in Kannada. Kumara Vyasa literally means \\"Little Vyasa\\" or \\"Son of Vyasa\\" (author of the Mahabharata). He was the contemporary and archrival of the famous, Veerashaiva, poet laureate Chamarasa who wrote the seminal work Prabhulingaleele covering the lives of Allama Prabhu and other Shiva Sharanas, circa 1435. Both poets worked in the court of Deva Raya II. Works Gada Parva (lit, \\"Battle of the clubs\\") section of Kumaravyasa's epic Mahabharata in Kannada dated to c.1425-1450 Parts of the Kannada epics-Kumaravyasa's Mahabharata and Lakshmisha's Jaimini Bharata Kumara Vyasa's most famous work, the Karnata Bharata Kathamanjari (the Mahabharata of Karnataka) is popularly known as Gadugina Bharata and Kumaravyasa Bharata. It is an adaptation of the first ten parvas (chapters) of the Mahabharata. A devotee of Krishna, Kumara Vyasa ends his epic with the coronation of Yudhishthira, the eldest of the Pandavas. The work is celebrated in Kannada literature due to its universal appeal. Gadugina Bharata is composed in the Bhamini Shatpadi metre, a form of six lined stanzas. Kumara Vyasa explores a wide range of human emotions, examines values, and displays extensive mastery over vocabulary. The work is particularly known for its use of sophisticated metaphors. Kumara Vyasa is also renowned for his characterization. Karnata Bharata Kathamanjari is also known as Dasha Parva Bharata because it originally had only ten parvas as opposed to the eighteen in the original Mahabharata. Kumara's Kathamanjari covers only up to the Gadayuddha, the battle between Duryodhana and Bheema, and the killing of Duryodhana. The subsequent parts of the original Mahabharata like the Yudhishthira Pattabhishekha, Ashwa Medha Yaaga, and the Swargaarohana Parva are not included. It may be noted that Lakshmeesha, another great poet who was born a few decades after Kumara's death, took up and completed Ashwa Medha Yaaga parva alone in his work Jaimini Bharata in Kannada. This spiritual work was considered equal to Kathamanjari for its narration. There is a strong belief among locals that Kumara was a blessed poet of Sri Veera Narayana, another name for Lord Vishnu. The poet sat in front of the sanctum sanctorum in the temple and Narayana himself narrated the story of the ancient Mahabharatha from behind the statue. The poet transformed the story excellent poetry. However, Narayana laid down a condition that Kumara was to only listen to this voice without attempting to see the source or the spirit narrating the story. When the tenth parva of his work was complete, Kumara was deeply curious to see the narrator. Much to his surprise, he saw Narayana himself narrating the story. He also saw a scene of the Kurukshetra War as if it were happening in front of him. However, Kumara had violated the condition that he not search for the source of the voice. At that point, the lord disappeared and the narration of the Mahabharata stopped forever. Kumara has shown an exemplary writing style in the introduction. He proudly claims that his poetry is matchless and that it caters to the taste of all kinds of readers. He writes that in his poetry \\"A king enjoys the valor, A brahmin the essence of all vedas, philosopher the ultimate philosophy, ministers and state administrators the tact of rule and Lovers the romantic notes.\\" In addition, he proudly acclaims that this work of his is the \\"Master of the works of all other great scholars.\\" However, his selflessness may be noted when he says he merely noted all that was narrated by his lord, the actual poet. Kumara Vyasa's other, lesser-known work is Airavata. Place and time mantapa of the Veeranarayana temple in Gadag, where Kumara Vyasa is known to have written his epic, the Kumaravyasa Bharata His magnum opus, Karnata Bharata Kathamanjari, was completed in 1430 when Deva Raya II was ruling the Vijayanagara empire. Kumara Vyasa earned high esteem as a poet in his court. Kumara Vyasa was mentioned by other prominent 15th century poets, such as Kanaka Dasa and Timmanna Kavi. Kumara Vyasa lived in Koliwad, a village from Gadag in North Karnataka. According to popular legend, Kumara Vyasa is said to have composed his work at the Veeranarayana temple in Gadag. A pillar known as Kumara Vyasa's pillar stands in the temple to this day. Influence on Kannada literature Kumara Vyasa's works belong to the Nadugannada (Middle-age Kannada) period of Kannada literature. His influence on later Kannada literature is significant. Gadugina Bharata is still widely read. It is popularly sung in a unique style known as Gamaka. See also *Kannada literature *Kannada References Bibliography * Dr. Suryanath U.
