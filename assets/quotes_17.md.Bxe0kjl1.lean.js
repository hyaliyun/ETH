This short- lived label was an attempt to avoid the compromises of working for major companies. Intended to showcase work by new musicians, only about two dozen albums were issued before the company closed in 1957.Debut Records discography at Jazzdisco.org; accessed January 2, 2012 Nonetheless, several prominent jazz musicians made their first recordings as leaders for Debut, including pianist Paul Bley, and trumpeters Kenny Dorham and Thad Jones. Saxophonist Hank Mobley made his recording debut on the label, as a sideman with Roach.Pekar, H. A View of Debut, Metro, Oct. 30-Nov. 5, 1997 Teo Macero, later a producer with Miles Davis, recorded his first album as a leader as a saxophonist for Debut, an album described by critic Dan MorgensternSee Morgenstern's notes for the 4-CD set The Debut Records Story as an oddball fusion of Lennie Tristano and Anton Webern. Debut was the label on which the Jazz at Massey Hall concert album was first issued. Recorded in Toronto, it features Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Bud Powell, Charles Mingus, and Max Roach, and was the last recorded meeting of long-term musical partners Parker and Gillespie. In 1957 Danish bookseller Ole Vestegaard leased the company's catalogue from Mingus and produced recordings on the Danish Debut label by American jazz musicians who settled in Copenhagen or played at Jazzhus Montmartre.Jazzistmark: The Legengary Debut Label accessed May 2, 2016 After Celia and Charles Mingus divorced, Celia married Saul Zaentz in 1960. Charles gave the Zaentzes control of the rights to Debut catalog as a wedding gift. Mingus thought the gift fitting as Celia had handled the bulk of Debut's business affairs, and most of the seed money came from Celia's mother. Zaentz was later head of Fantasy Records, where the Debut recordings were subsequently reissued from 1962–1964.Fantasy's Debut Series at Discogs A 12-CD set of the Debut recordings featuring Mingus, the majority of the label's output, was issued by Fantasy Records in 1990.

It flows from Clemow Lake in northern Algonquin Provincial Park and joins the Petawawa River, whose southern branch it forms, in the municipality of Laurentian Hills, near the municipality of Petawawa. Shows the river course. Course The river begins at Clemow Lake in the geographic township of Barron in the Unorganized South Part of Nipissing District, Northeastern Ontario. It flows southeast through Grand Lake where it is crossed by the former Canadian Northern Railway later Canadian National Railway main line, now abandoned, and where the Achray campground, formerly a station on the railway, is located on the north shore. It passes into Stratton Township, takes in the right tributary Carcajou Creek, then flows out over the Grand Lake Dam and again under the railway to enter Stratton Lake. The river turns northeast, passes over High Falls to High Falls Lake, then heads east over Brigham Chute. It takes in the right tributary Mulock Creek, enters Master Township, passes over the Cache Rapids, and reaches the Squirrel Depot picnic area and the Squirrel Rapids. The river heads out of Algonquin Park and Nipissing District into McKay Township, part of the municipality of Laurentian Hills in Renfrew County, Eastern Ontario. At this point the river becomes part of Barron River Provincial Park, a non- operating waterway park, and the north shore is part of CFB Petawawa. The river passes over First Chute and reaches its mouth at Lac du Bois Dur on the Petawawa River, which flows to the Ottawa River, about west of the community of Black Bay and just before the border with the municipality of Petawawa. The Petawawa Rivers flows via the Ottawa River to the Saint Lawrence River. Geology Approximately 10,000 years ago, the river was a main outlet for glacial meltwater in this region. It is believed to have carried for a short time the outflow from the Lake Agassiz.citation needed The deep Barron Canyon was formed during that time. The rocks exposed in the Canyon are part of the Canadian Shield. The canyon itself still shows activity in the form of rockfalls and landslides. The Barron River lies inside a fault associated with the Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben. History The river was an important highway during the last part of the 19th century and early 20th century when its water levels were carefully manipulated to facilitate the transport of timber to the Ottawa River and onwards. The Barron Canyon was the scene of noisy log drives every spring. The name the loggers used for the towering cliffs was the \\"Capes\\". Moving timber in this way was a dangerous task and evidence can be found by the graves still found on the edge of the Petawawa and Barron Rivers.

Nicknamed \\"Panther Head\\", he ranks sixth among the 36 Heavenly Spirits, the first third of the 108 Stars of Destiny. In some folk tales derived from the novel, he is said to have learnt martial arts from Zhou Tong, who purportedly trained the Song dynasty general Yue Fei in archery. Background Lin Chong resembles Zhang Fei, a general of the Three Kingdoms era, in appearance. Over six chi tall, he has piercing eyes and a head like that of a panther, which earns him the nickname \\"Panther Head\\". He is a martial arts instructor of the Imperial Guards in Dongjing (東京; present-day Kaifeng, Henan), the imperial capital of the Song dynasty. Framed and exiled Lin Chong introduces himself to Lu Zhishen when he sees the monk working out with his hefty staff and is deeply impressed. Lu tends a vegetable plot for a temple in Dongjing. They become sworn brothers. While they are chatting, Gao Yanei, the play-boy adopted son of Grand Marshal Gao Qiu, runs into Lin Chong's wife in a temple and tries to force himself on her. Lin rushes to the temple and saves his wife in time. Afraid of inviting trouble, he decides not to report the case to the authorities. However, besotted with Lin's wife, Gao Yanei seeks the help of Lin's friend Lu Qian. Lu invites Lin Chong out for a drink, during which Mrs Lin is tricked to go to Lu's house, where Gao Yanei attempts to rape her. Mrs Lin‘s maid escapes and informs her master, who rushes to Lu Qian's house. Gao Yanei flees upon learning that Lin is coming. Gao Yanei asks his adoptive father to help him get hold of Lin Chong‘s wife. Knowing Lin loves good weapons, Gao Qiu sends a man to trick him to buy a rare sword on the street. The Grand Marshal then summons Lin Chong to his residence claiming that he wants to see his new possession. Lin, carrying the sword, unsuspectingly enters the White Tiger Hall, where meetings on top-secret state matters are held and arms are prohibited. Gao Qiu accuses Lin of wanting to assassinate him and orders his arrest. Lin Chong is tattooed on the face and exiled to Cangzhou. Before he is on the way, he insists on divorcing his wife so that she can find a better husband. Meanwhile, Gao Qiu bribes the two guards escorting Lin Chong to kill him along the way. During the journey, the escorts mistreat Lin, including scalding his feet at one point. At Wild Boar Forest, just as they are about to kill Lin after tying him to a tree, Lu Zhishen springs out from behind the trunk, disarms them, and wants to finish them off. He is prevented by Lin Chong, who tells him that they are just stooges of Gao Qiu. Lu Zhishen accompanies Lin to Cangzhou and takes leave only after ensuring the escorts would try no more mischief. In Cangzhou, Lin Chong befriends the nobleman Chai Jin. His impressive skill in thrashing a boastful and arrogant martial arts instructor, who lives off Chai, wins the scion's admiration. Chai provides him money to bribe the jailers not to make his life in prison miserable. Burning of the fodder depot Gao Qiu sends Lu Qian and his steward Fu An to Cangzhou on a second attempt to kill Lin Chong. Lu Qian bribes the chief warden and a jailer, and they work out a plan involving assigning Lin to be a solo watchman at a fodder depot. On the day Lin Chong takes up his new duty, Lu Qian, Fu An and the jailer set fire to the depot after nightfall, certain that he must be trapped in the inferno. However, Lin Chong has earlier gone out to buy wine and upon return found his hut in the depot crushed under the weight of snow. He then took shelter in a nearby temple. Upon seeing that the depot is on fire, he hurries towards it. But he overhears the three men talking outside the temple and learns that the fire is their work. Enraged, he charges out, kills the three men and offers their heads to the deity of the temple. He then flees the scene. Becoming an outlaw While on the run, Lin Chong meets Chai Jin again, who suggests he joins the outlaws at Liangshan Marsh. Chai writes a recommendation letter for him addressed to Wang Lun, the chief of Liangshan. Lin comes to an inn, which is an outpost of the stronghold managed by Zhu Gui. Zhu ushers him across the marsh and up the hill. At Liangshan, Wang Lun fears Lin Chong, with his superior fighting skill, will usurp his position, so he tries to send him away with excuse and gifts. As Lin Chong pleads to stay, Wang Lun sets the condition that he must kill a man in three days and present the person‘s head as his ticket of enrolment. On the third day, Lin Chong encounters Yang Zhi and they fight to a standstill. Wang Lun comes to the scene, stops the fight, and invites Yang to join his band in the hope that he would be a counterweight to Lin Chong. But Yang declines and leaves. Wang Lun reluctantly lets Lin Chong stay and take the fourth position under himself, Du Qian and Song Wan. When Chao Gai and his six friends come to Liangshan to seek refuge after being discovered by authorities to be the hijackers of birthday gifts in transportation to the Grand Tutor Cai Jing, Wang Lun again feels threatened. He tries to send them away with gifts. Frustrated with Wang Lun's selfishness and incited by Wu Yong, Lin Chong kills the leader. Chao Gai is elected the new chief of Liangshan, with Lin being placed fourth after Wu Yong and Gongsun Sheng. Lin then seeks news about his wife and is sad to hear that she has hanged herself to avoid harassment by Gao Yanei. Death Lin Chong is appointed as one of the Five Tiger Generals of the Liangshan cavalry after the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the Grand Assembly. When Gao Qiu personally leads a military attack on Liangshan, he ends up being captured. Some later editions of Water Margin say Lin Chong wants to kill Gao for reprisal. But an earlier edition said he is resigned to his fate, no longer keen on revenge. The 120-chapter edition of Water Margin depicts him as merely staring at Gao as the latter is escorted into Liangshan's main hall after his capture. The earlier 100-chapter edition does not even mention this. Song Jiang treats Gao as an honoured guest and releases him hoping he will obtain amnesty from Emperor Huizong for Liangshan. After the amnesty, the Liangshan heroes are sent to fight the Liao invaders and put down the rebel forces of Tian Hu, Wang Qing, and Fang La in Song territory. Lin Chong makes significant contributions in the series of campaigns. Just when the missions are all over, Lin Chong is stricken by paralysis. He dies six months later under the care of Wu Song in Liuhe Temple in Hangzhou, where Lu Zhishen had died six months earlier.

The milk in a cortado is steamed, but not frothy and \\"texturized\\" as in many Italian coffee drinks. The word cortado is the past participle of the Spanish verb cortar (to cut), in the sense of \\"dilute\\", and can refer variously to either coffee or espresso drinks throughout Spanish and Portuguese speaking countries. Similar drinks In Spain a café solo corto is a small amount of black coffee (usually a single shot of espresso), while a café cortado is an espresso with a dash of milk, while the term cortado is itself broadly associated with various coffee or espresso beverages having been \\"cut\\" with milk. The café cortado may in fact be interchangeable with the Italian macchiato or similar to the French noisette. The cortadito in Cuba specifically implies a small beverage similar to the café solo corto consisting of a standard 1oz espresso shot; however, unlike the solo corto, the Cuban cortadito is generally cut with heated sweetened condensed milk, being a more available preserved form of milk, whereas fresh milk was historically often unavailable. A cortadito is usually served in a special glass, often with a metal ring base and a metal wire handle. There are several nominal variations, including cortado condensada, café con leche condensada or bombón (espresso with condensed milk); leche y leche is a similar variation, but with both condensed milk integrated throughout and a dollop of cream resting on top. Brought to the Little Havana neighborhood of Miami, Florida, by Cuban-Americans in the 1960s, the cortadito drink is now found throughout the city, and is an important part of everyday culture, particularly among Cubans. However, the cortadito is a drink distinct from Cuban-style coffee, which includes sugar in addition to milk, and has its own brewing method as espresso. In non Spanish-speaking countries where it appears on a specialty coffee menu, however, the cortado should generally be distinguished from the Italian caffè macchiato, cappuccino, or a flat white. A macchiato has only a small amount (a 'mark' or spot) of milk foam added, while a cappuccino has a head from both foam and milk. A flat white is generally made with a similar equivalent ratio of espresso to milk, but uses steamed and textured (e.g. microfoam) milk, resulting in a hotter and lighter drink, more closely related to a latte. A similar drink in Australia is known as a piccolo latte, or simply a piccolo. This is a single ristretto shot in a macchiato glass that is filled with steamed milk in the same fashion as a cafe latte. A larger drink, popular in Portugal, is the galão, which uses 1:3 proportions but is otherwise similar to both cortados and manchados. Other names and variations In Catalan, tallat takes the role of describing being cut, with the closest word in Basque being ebaki, and pingado or garoto in Portuguese. In the United States the meaning of the name can vary by region but on the East Coast it is generally known as a cortado. In the Czech Republic, Costa Coffee sells cortado under the marketing name corto classic. Gibraltar A gibraltar, served in San Francisco. A diagram of coffee drinks in Silicon Valley, showing an archetypal gibraltar. The name gibraltar originated in San Francisco, California, where roasters – first Blue Bottle Coffee Company, later Ritual Coffee Roasters and others – started the cortado trend by serving the drink in Libbey Glass Company glassware by the same name. Whereas a cortado is a broader term for many a cut beverage, a gibraltar is specifically defined in its proportions by the constraints of its cup size: a Libbey 'Gibraltar' glass contains 4.5 oz, 2 oz of which are filled by a standard double espresso shot and the remainder filled by foam.

In addition to its regular mission as a military training base, Camp Perry also boasts the largest outdoor rifle range in the world after the NRA Whittington Center in Raton, NM. The firing is done in the direction of the open water of the lake, that lies just beyond an earthen berm and the targets. History The original land for Camp Perry was purchased in 1906, and the reservation was named after Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry, the American naval commander who won the Battle of Put-in-Bay during the War of 1812. Rudimentary structures were constructed for use by competitors in the National Matches, and for transient military personnel. During World War I, Camp Perry served as a training center for Army officers and marksmanship instructors. Around 1918 an additional area immediately adjacent to the existing Camp Perry grounds was used to construct the Erie Army Depot for artillery ordnance storage. During the Second World War, Camp Perry served as a POW camp for German and Italian prisoners. After the war prisoner quarters were converted back to use by transient personnel who were at Perry for training. In 1946 the Governor of Ohio, Frank Lausche considered turning the camp into a college temporarily. The camp was used extensively for several years after World War II, but use slowed somewhat during the 1960s. The Erie Army Depot closed in the mid-1960s and was eventually converted to industrial use. However, many of Camp Perry's original structures are still in use in one form or another. On June 24, 1998 a tornado damaged several buildings on the grounds. The Italian prisoners were very lightly guarded and worked alongside the civilians at the camp. They were also used as workers at various local industries and returned to the Camp each night. The Camp was used to test the longevity of artillery weapons. The gun barrels were measured with a very precise gauge. The guns were then fired into Lake Erie and retested to determine the amount of wear the rounds of firing caused. This enabled the Army to estimate the effective life of the weapon.My mother worked Camp Perry and told us stories of her interactions with the prisoners. She operated a Starr gauge to measure the barrels. A bus load of Italian prisoners would arrive at the basket factory behind our home for work each day. There were \\"guarded\\" by one soldier with a rifle who lounged most of the day. Present use Currently, Camp Perry is home to the 213th Ordnance Company (Missile Support, Corps), the 372d Missile Maintenance Company (DS) Detachment 1, the 200th RED HORSE Civil Engineering Squadron (Ohio Air National Guard), U.S. Coast Guard Port Security Unit 309, the Ohio Naval Militia (the naval arm of Ohio's State Defense Forces), and the Ohio Military Reserve (the militia arm of Ohio's State Defense Forces). Civilian Marksmanship Program Spc. Joseph Hein, U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit, instructs a student on the intricacies of the M-16A2 rifle during the Small Arms Firing School, Aug. 1, 2009 at Camp Perry, Ohio. Camp Perry has been the host of the Civilian Marksmanship Program (CMP) and the NRA-sponsored National Rifle Matches since 1907. The National Matches, considered America's \\"World Series of the Shooting Sports,\\" attracts shooting sports competitors from all across the world to compete in matches of all multitudes. Competition event shooters range from beginners to the world’s best. The National Matches include Small Arms Firing Schools, a series of CMP National Trophy Rifle and Pistol Matches, CMP Games Events and NRA national championships. The National Matches are conducted through a partnership with the CMP, the Ohio National Guard and the NRA. The camp is home to the Small Arms Firing School, which provides shooters with expert training and facilities for improving their shooting ability. The Small Arms Firing School was first conducted by The Department of Defense as part of the National Matches at the camp in 1918. Now there are over one thousand pistol and rifle shooters a year that take part in firearms safety and fundamental marksmanship skills. The Pistol and Rifle Schools are conducted by the U. S. Army Marksmanship Unit (USAMU). The Schools are open to all United States citizens who are over the minimum age. USAMU instructors, assisted by Army, Air Force, Coast Guard, Marine Corps and Navy Active, National Guard and Reserve shooting team members teach basic marksmanship techniques to the new and less experienced, and experienced shooters who want to learn new ways to improve their scores. Camp Perry is also home to the Civilian Marksmanship Program's north office.

Examples are sexual activity while casually dating, one-night stands, prostitution, or swinging.  Practices  Single encounters A one-night stand is a single sexual encounter between individuals, where at least one of the parties has no immediate intention or expectation of establishing a longer-term sexual or romantic relationship. Anonymous sex is a form of one-night stand or casual sex between people who have very little or no history with each other, often engaging in sexual activity on the same day of their meeting and usually never seeing each other again afterwards. Social sex \\"Friends with benefits\\" and \\"booty calls\\" describe a situation in which a person has sex with someone they generally consider a friend or someone they are fairly close to. They are not in an exclusive romantic relationship.Bogle, Kathleen A (2008). \\"Hooking Up: Sex, Dating, and Relationships on Campus\\", p. 118. New York UP, New York. . The involved parties may have a degree of emotional attachment but do not want, for whatever reason, to have \\"strings attached\\".

Hooking up A \\"hookup\\" (colloquial American English) is a casual sexual encounter involving physical pleasure without necessarily including emotional bonding or long-term commitment; it can range from kissing (for example, making out) to other sexual activities. Hooking up became a widespread practice among young people in the 1980s and 1990s. Researchers say that what differentiates hooking up from casual sex in previous generations of young people is the \\"virtual disappearance\\" of dating, which had been dominant from the postwar period onwards. Today, researchers say, casual sex rather than dating is the primary path for young people into a relationship. With the use of apps becoming more common it has become easier to hook up or meet others for sexual activity. With students, studies have shown that the group most likely to engage in casual sex is white middle or upper-class heterosexuals. Black and Latino students are less likely to hook up, as are evangelical Christian students and working-class students. Data on gay and lesbian students show mixed results, as some research shows that they engage in hookups at the same rate as heterosexual students, while others suggest that it occurs less due to college parties not always being gay-friendly, as most hookups occur at such gatherings. A study of hookup culture at the University of Iowa found that waiting to have sex does not contribute to a stronger future relationship. Instead, the study found that what mattered most was the goal individuals had going into a relationship. Individuals who started by hooking up tended to develop a full relationship later if that was their goal going in. Another survey revealed that the number of first dates that most college-aged students have been on is about half of the number of hookups they've had. As of the recent decades, it has become a common dating practice for people to candidly talk about their casual sex encounters and personal views on the subject as early as the first date or meeting. Another study showed that condoms were used in only 69 out of every 100 penetrative sex hookups.  Swinging  Swingers in the lifestyle engage in casual sex with others for a variety of reasons. For many, an advantage is the increased quality, quantity and frequency of sex. Some swingers engage in casual sex to add variety to their otherwise conventional sex lives or for curiosity. Swingers who engage in casual sex maintain that sex among swingers is often more frank and deliberative and therefore more honest than infidelity. Some couples see swinging as a healthy outlet and a means to strengthen their relationship. Others regard such activities as merely social and recreational interaction with others. A swinger party or partner-swapping party is a gathering at which individuals or couples in a committed relationship can engage in sexual activities with others as a recreational or social activity. Swinging can take place in various contexts, ranging from a spontaneous sexual activity at an informal social gathering of friends to a regular social gathering in a sex club (or swinger club), private residence, or other pre- arranged location such as a hotel, a resort, or a cruise ship.  History   1920s  In the United States, in the 1920s, \\"petting parties\\", where petting (\\"making out\\" or foreplay) was the main attraction, became a popular part of the flapper lifestyle.. An earlier article in the same newspaper rebutted an attack on the behavior of American girls made recently in the Cosmopolitan by Elinor Glyn. It admitted the existence of petting parties but considered the activities were no worse than those which had gone on in earlier times under the guise of \\"kissing games\\", adding that tales of what occurred at such events were likely to be exaggerated by an older generation influenced by traditional misogyny: Because automobile ownership boomed and the number of options for dating venues, such as movie theaters and jazz halls, increased significantly during this time, parental involvement in the courtship process began to decrease. This allowed for casual hookups to become a more common occurrence in the teen and young adult dating experience. Automobiles began to be referred to as \\"brothels on wheels\\" for this reason, The young adults of the 1920s found the Victorian era sexual script and moral codes to be oppressive, and thus the liberated flapper and vamp personas were born. The emerging movie industry furthered progress in the rebellion against Victorian era morals because films started depicting women owning their sexuality, a trend that has continued into current cinema. Women became sexually liberated through their adopted flapper and vamp identities, as well as through progress made in contraceptive and family planning methods. Sexual revolution During the sexual revolution in the United States and Europe in the 1960s and 1970s, social attitudes to sexual issues underwent considerable changes. The advent of \\"the pill\\" and other forms of birth control, the Women's Liberation movement, and the legalization of abortion in many countries are believed to have led to a wider practice of casual sex.The Pill and Sexual Revolution Retrieved: 2010-03-28. This is also due, in part, to the younger generation's rejection of their parents' dating and matrimonial ideals, and the rise of college party culture. In response to this insurgence in the 1960s, single women were denied access to birth control pills by their healthcare providers. This type of pushback is consistently observed throughout studies of the evolution of American sexual morals and beliefs. Younger generations are encouraged by their elders to engage in sexual activity only if it is within the bounds of marriage and is for procreative purposes. Contemporary In the United States, one-time sexual encounters among college-aged students are growing increasingly common; nearly 70% of people in this age group have partaken in casual sex at least once because of their newfound adult identities and freedom to explore their sexualities. Prevalence and norms Colleges Research suggests that as many as two- thirds to three-quarters of American students have casual sex at least once during college. On college campuses, casual sex may occur almost anywhere. The majority of hookups happen at parties. Other common casual sex venues are dorms, frat houses, bars, dance clubs, cars, and in public places or wherever is available at the time. Collegiate holidays and vacations, especially spring breaks, are times when undergraduates are more likely to purposely seek out casual sexual encounters and experiment with risky behaviors. This is due to the availability of alcohol and uninhibitedness of spring break venues. One study reported that about 30% of collegiate spring breakers, whether they are in a monogamous relationship or not, have penetrative sex with a person they meet during their break. A 1995 study of Canadian students who had traveled to Florida for spring break, found the key elements of a spring break vacation to include a group holiday with friends traveling and rooming together, a perpetual party atmosphere, high alcohol consumption, sexually suggestive contests and displays, and the perception that casual sex is common. Overall, there was a perception that sexual norms are far more permissive on spring break vacation than at home, providing an atmosphere of greater sexual freedom and the opportunity for engaging in new sexual experiences. Of the 681 students who completed a questionnaire after the break, 15% of males and 13% of females had engaged in casual sex during the break. Nearly 61% of men and 34% of women who had casual sex over the break had slept together within 24 hours of meeting. \\"Hookup\\" norms Men and women are found to engage in very similar casual sex conducts, despite popular social beliefs. Most young adults in this age group believe that their peers are having a higher frequency of casual sex than they actually are, and this is due to vocabulary choice. For example, using the term \\"hookup\\" denotes that the sexual activity, whether it is vaginal sex, oral sex, or sexual touching, is casual and between unfamiliar partners. However, it is vague and does not detail what specific sexual activities occurred. This is especially distorting towards others' impressions because 98% of college hookups involve kissing, 81% of hookups involve more than kissing, and only 34% of hookups involve penetrative sex. Studies have also linked this common misperception of peer hookup activity to media and pop culture portrayals of casual sexual encounters. Television and movies project distorted depictions of casual sex because they also commonly portray people who have just hooked up as emotionally satisfied and physically pleasured while simultaneously emotionally detached, which is not always the case.  Legal and religious issues Attitudes to casual sex range from conservative and religious views, the extreme of which may result in imprisonment or even capital punishment for sexual relations outside heterosexual marriage, to liberal or libertarian (libertine) views, the extreme of which is free love.  Legal  The legality of adultery and prostitution varies around the world. In some countries there are laws which prohibit or restrict casual sex. In some Muslim-majority countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Kuwait, Maldives, Morocco, Oman, Mauritania, United Arab Emirates, Sudan, and Yemen, any form of sexual activity outside marriage is illegal.  Religious views  Most religions disapprove of sex outside marriage (see religion and sexuality), and the consequences range from very serious to none. Also, marriage is defined in quite different ways in different cultures, for example, with \\"short-term marriage\\" (see Nikah mut'ah) a cover for prostitution, or polygamy. Although some religious views look upon casual sex negatively, individual views on casual sex vary based on personal traits such as autonomy. Religious people and non-religious people mostly have similar feelings when it comes to having casual sex, with a bigger difference in attitude taking place between men and women.  Commercial sites  Many specialist online dating services or other websites, known as \\"adult personals\\" or \\"adult matching\\" sites, cater to people looking for a purely sexual relationship without emotional attachments. These can provide a relatively anonymous forum where people who are geographically close but in totally separate work and social circles can make contact. Tinder is a free smartphone dating app that boasts over 10 million daily users, making it the most popular dating app for iOS and Android. In this app, users can either swipe right (which indicates interest) or swipe left (which indicates disinterest) on other users in hopes of matching each other. If both users swipe right on one another, they are a match, and messaging can be initiated between parties. This app is used for a variety of reasons, one of which is casual hookups. Men are more likely than women to use Tinder to seek out casual sexual encounters. This is attributed to men, in comparison to women, placing sexual pleasure at a higher level of importance and using social networking sites to fulfill this need. However, overall, more users are motivated to use it to find romance rather than sex. Despite this, there is a social concern as some believe that the app encourages hookups between users.

Early life Admiral Tolley was born in Manila in, while his father, Lieutenant Colonel Oscar Kemp Tolley, was serving there in the U.S. Army, Kemp Tolley was a 1929 graduate of the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, where he was a member of Phi Alpha Theta. Early career During the 1930s, Tolley served aboard battleships, cruisers and a submarine tender. He also served on the exotic China station, becoming executive officer of the river gunboat USS Tutuila on the upper Yangtze River. Tolley had a natural aptitude for languages and was fluent in Russian, German, French and Spanish. World War II Lt. Kemp Tolley's escapre route to Australia in 1941-1942. Tolley, then a lieutenant, left Hankou, China on 27 November 1941 aboard . The gunboat sailed down the Yangtze River to Shanghai, where Tolley boarded , bound for Manila, Philippines. On 5 December 1941 Tolley was given command of the sailing schooner Lanikai, which had been acquired by the Navy from a private owner, and given orders to sail in waters off the Philippines and report any sightings of Japanese warships. The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor before Tolley could embark on this mission and the Lanikai was assigned to the Inshore Patrol. Lanikai was detached on 26 December 1941 and ordered to attempt to escape to friendly waters. This was the start of a two-month odyssey during which Lanikai sailed from Manila in the Philippine Islands, to Surabaya on Java in the then Netherlands East Indies. Lanikai participated briefly in the doomed defense of Java and was strafed by Japanese aircraft on at least one occasion. Just prior to the fall of Java, Tolley took Lanikai to Tjilatjap on the south coast of Java where she evacuated allied stragglers. Lanikai departed Java 26 February 1942 just prior to the Dutch surrender and arrived at Fremantle, Australia on 18 March 1942. After suitable recovery and refitting Lanikai was engaged in patrol work along the northern coast of Western Australia until April 27, 1942.Kemp Tolley: One Step Ahead of the Japs, U.S. Navy All Hands magazine December 1944, pp. 6-9, 64. In August 1942, the Lanikai was turned over to the Royal Australian Navy. Tolley was then reassigned as an assistant naval attaché in the Soviet Union. There, he met Vlada Gritzenko, whom he married in 1943. He served in this assignment until 1944 and was promoted to lieutenant commander and commander. Late in 1944, Tolley returned to the Pacific when he was assigned as the navigator of the battleship USS North Carolina where he participated in combat action at Leyte Gulf and off Luzon during the liberation of the Philippines. He was also aboard North Carolina during the invasion of Iwo Jima and was wounded by shell fragments at Okinawa Gunto.http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2000-11-01/news/0011010314_1_attack-on- pearl-pearl-harbor-japanese-attack For his service during the war, Tolley received the Bronze Star Medal for meritorious service, the Purple Heart for being wounded in action and seven battle stars. Post War Career After the war, he became an intelligence officer on the Naval Operations staff and commanded the attack cargo ship USS Vermilion (AKA-107) from June 1947 to September 1948.http://www.navsource.org/archives/10/02/02107a.htm From 1949 to 1952, he was the director of the intelligence division at the Armed Forces Staff College in Norfolk, Virginia, where his unorthodox teaching methods were frowned upon by his superiors although his classes were very popular with his students. Other tours included operations officer on the staff of Commander Amphibious Group Two and command of Amphibious Squadron Five, during which time he was tasked with forming an evacuation plan for Taiwan. In 1956, he was designated commander of fleet activities at the Yokosuka, Japan.http://www.usni.org/heritage/tolley Later life Tolley retired from the Navy in 1959, and was promoted to rear admiral on the retired list in recognition of his being decorated for combat service. He then returned to his boyhood home in historic Corbett Village, Monkton, Maryland. In retirement, he wrote more than 100 articles and three books, \\"Yangtze Patrol,\\" \\"Cruise of the Lanikai\\" and \\"Caviar and Commissars.\\"http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2000-11-01/news/0011010314_1_attack- on-pearl-pearl-harbor-japanese-attack In 1992, he was inducted into the Defense Attache Hall of Fame in Washington. In 1993, he was honored at the White House Rose Garden by President Bill Clinton and later by Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin.

The second and third movements were first performed with the composer as soloist on 2 December 1900. The complete work was premiered, again with the composer as soloist, on 9 November 1901, with his cousin Alexander Siloti conducting. This piece is one of Rachmaninoff's most enduringly popular pieces, and established his fame as a concerto composer. Rachmaninoff in the early 1900s Background At its 1897 premiere, Rachmaninoff's first symphony, though now considered a significant achievement, was derided by contemporary critics. Compounded by problems in his personal life, Rachmaninoff fell into a depression that lasted for several years. His second piano concerto confirmed his recovery from clinical depression and writer's block, cured by courses of hypnotherapy and psychotherapy and helped by support from his family and friends. The concerto was dedicated to Nikolai Dahl, the physician who had done much to restore Rachmaninoff's self- confidence. Composition The work is scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets in B (I mov.) and A (II & III mov.), 2 bassoons, 4 horns in F, 2 trumpets in B, 3 trombones (2 tenor, 1 bass), tuba, timpani, bass drum, cymbals, solo piano, and strings. It is written in three-movement concerto form. Moderato: C minor bars of the concerto Main theme first played by the two violin sections, viola section and first clarinet The opening movement begins with a series of chromatic bell-like tollings on the piano that build tension, eventually climaxing in the introduction of the main theme. This leads into the key and main theme of the piece, C minor. In this first section, the orchestra carries the Russian-character melody, while the piano provides an accompanimental role, consisting of rapid oscillating arpeggios between both hands. After the statement of the long first theme, a quick and virtuosic \\"piu mosso\\" pianistic figuration transition leads into the lyrical second theme in E major, the relative key. The second theme is first stated by the solo piano, with light accompaniment coming from the upper wind instruments. A transition which follows the chromatic scale eventually leads to the final reinstatement of the second theme, this time with the full orchestra at a piano dynamic. The exposition ends with an agitated closing section with scaling arpeggios on the E major scale in both hands. The agitated and unstable development borrows motives from both themes, changing keys very often and giving the melody to different instruments while a new musical idea is slowly formed. The sound here, while focused on a particular tonality, has ideas of chromaticism. Two sequences of pianistic figurations lead to a placid, orchestral reinstatement of the first theme in the dominant 7th key of G. The development furthers with motifs from the previous themes, climaxing towards a B major \\"piu vivo\\" section. A triplet arpeggio section leads into the accelerando section, with the accompanying piano playing chords in both hands, and the string section providing the melody reminiscent of the second theme. The piece reaches a climax with the piano playing dissonant fortississimo (fff) chords, and with the horns and trumpets providing the syncopated melody. While the orchestra restates the first theme, the piano, that on the other occasion had an accompaniment role, now plays the march-like theme that had been halfly presented in the development, thus making a considerable readjustment in the exposition, as the main theme, the arpeggios in the piano serve as an accompaniment. This is followed by a piano-solo which continues the first theme and leads into a descending chromatic passage to a pianississimo A major chord. Then the second theme is heard played with a horn solo. The entrance of the piano reverts the key back into C minor, with triplet passages played over a mysterious theme played by the orchestra. Briefly, the piece transitions to a C major glissando in the piano, and is placid until drawn into the agitated closing section in which the movement ends in a C minor fortissimo. Adagio sostenuto – Più animato – Tempo I: C minor → E major The second movement opens with a series of slow chords in the strings which modulate from the C minor of the previous movement to the E major of this movement. At the beginning of the A section, the piano enters, playing a simple arpeggiated figure. This opening piano figure was composed in 1891 as the opening of the Romance from Two Pieces For Six Hands. The main theme is initially introduced by the flute, before being developed by an extensive clarinet solo. The motif is passed between the piano and then the strings. Then the B section is heard. It builds up to a short climax centred on the piano, which leads to cadenza for piano. The original theme is repeated, and the music appears to die away, finishing with just the soloist in E major. Allegro scherzando: E major → C minor → C major The last movement opens with a short orchestral introduction that modulates from E major (the key of the previous movement) to C minor, before a piano solo leads to the statement of the agitated first theme. After the original fast tempo and musical drama ends, a short transition from the piano solo leads to the second theme lyrical theme in B major is introduced by the oboe and violas. This theme maintains the motif of the first movement's second theme. The exposition ends with a suspenseful closing section in B major. After that an extended and energetic development section is heard. The development is based on the first theme of the exposition. It maintains a very improvisational quality, as instruments take turns playing the stormy motifs. In the recapitulation, the first theme is truncated to only 8 bars on the tutti, because it was widely used in the development section. After the transition, the recapitulation's 2nd theme appears, this time in D major, half above the tonic. However, after the ominous closing section ends it then builds up into a triumphant climax in C major from the beginning of the coda. The movement ends very triumphantly in the tonic major with the same four-note rhythm ending the Third Concerto in D minor. Reception After the second and third movement premiered in December 1900 with Rachmaninoff as the soloist, the entire piece was first performed in 1901 and was enthusiastically received. This concerto earned the composer a Glinka Award, the first of five awarded to him throughout his life, and a 500-rouble prize in 1904. The positive reception was a significant catalyst in the advancement of his recovery from continual depression. Derivative works The second theme of Allegro scherzando provides the basis for Frank Sinatra's 1945 \\"Full Moon and Empty Arms\\". And two songs recorded by Sinatra also have roots in the first movement of the concerto: \\"I Think of You\\" and \\"Forever and Ever\\". The Adagio sostenuto theme appears in Eric Carmen's 1975 ballad \\"All by Myself\\". Carmen first composed the song's interlude, then took the bridge from Rachmaninoff and the chorus from his own \\"Let's Pretend\\". Carmen explained that Rachmaninoff was his \\"favorite music\\". Austrian violinist and composer Fritz Kreisler wrote a transcription of the second movement for Violin and Piano in 1940, named Preghiera (Prayer). The 1941 Sinatra song \\"I Think of You\\" is also based on the concerto, with the lyric line following a theme from the first movement, and the accompaniment with influences from the third movement. The chorus of the song \\"Space Dementia\\" by Muse is based on the first movement of concerto. American saxophonist, composer and bandleader Bob Belden arranged the concerto for performance by the Classical Jazz Quartet in 2006. Popular culture * In the 1932 film adaptation of Grand Hotel by Edmund Goulding with Greta Garbo * In the beginning of the fourth act of Ayn Rand's 1943 novel The Fountainhead, Rachmaninoff's second concerto is cited as one of two musical works capable of acting as a surrogate for man's achievement. * The concerto features significantly in David Lean's 1945 film Brief Encounter. * In Frank Capra's and Hugh Stewart's 1944 WWII documentary Tunisian Victory. * Performed by character, Francesca Cunningham, played by Ann Todd, in 1945 film, The Seventh Veil. * It is the main theme of Frank Borzage's 1946 film I've Always Loved You.

The archbishop's seat was the capital of the province of Calabria Ultra for over 200 years. It houses the University \\"Magna Græcia\\", the second largest university in Calabria. Catanzaro is an urban centre, with much activity, including some coastal towns, such as Sellia Marina and Soverato, and the municipalities of Silas, with a total of 156,196 inhabitants. Catanzaro is being consolidated to form a greater metropolitan area, by the Region of Calabria, and in connection with the town of Lamezia Terme, comprising 10 municipalities. This will lead to the creation of an integrated area involving over 200,000 inhabitants. During the summer months, the Ionian coast from Catanzaro to Soverato is an important tourist attraction, especially for the youth, and is in the presence of several important structures located in the coastal districts of the city and the towns of Copanello and Soverato. Catanzaro is also known as city of the three V's, referring to the three distinct features of the city, namely Saint Vitalian, the patron saint; velvet, because the city has been an important silk center since Byzantine times; and wind (vento in Italian), because of the strong breezes from the Ionian Sea and La Sila. \\"VVV\\" was the symbol by which Catanzaro's silk industry was known, identified for both its domestic and foreign markets, and iconic for the finest fabrication of silks, velvets, damasks, and brocades from the city. Geography Catanzaro overlooks the Gulf of Squillace, in the Ionian Sea. The district of Catanzaro stretches from the sea to an elevation of . The historic center is approximately above sea level. The town dates back to the valley of Fiumarella (formerly known as River Zaro). The Bishopric, St. Tryphon (or San Rocco) and St. John (or castle) marks the city's historical center and is connected to the North Sila. Due to its particular geography, the municipality gets wet from the sea, and is still subjected to a snowy winter. Catanzaro's rivers include the main stream of the Fiumarella (in local dialect Hjiumareddha), which joins with the river Musofalo, and the torrent Corach (formerly called Crotalo). Climate The climate of Catanzaro is typically Mediterranean, temperate, and characterized by a windy spring and autumn. According to the 30-year average of 1961-90 reference, the average temperature of the coldest month, January, came to . The hottest month, August, is . The climate, as mentioned, is marked by the presence of wind, even high intensity, especially during spring and autumn. The annual average intensity is about with peaks at . The months of April and May are characterized by strong winds and the \\"scirocco libeccio\\". The annual rainfall is around , distributed in 87 days on average, with a long summer and a minimum peak in the autumn and winter. History Certain assumptions trace the origin of Catanzaro to an ancient Greek colony, already in place, which became the land of Scolacium, believed to have been built on the ruins of the ancient city of Trischines. Other sources identify Catanzaro's development to have grown from various settlements scattered in the area of Catanzaro, Marina, Tiriolo (formerly Teure), Santa Maria di Catanzaro, and on the hill Trivonà (Trischines, along the valley of Corach which formed the old \\"Land of Feaco\\"). The mouth of the river, according to legend, created the ancient Ulysses Skilletion. In the district of Germaneto along the valley of Corach, a Greek necropolis of the fifth century BC and an ancient Roman settlement were found. Archaeological discoveries show that the municipality was active since the Iron Ages, flourishing with the populations of \\"Vitulo\\", so called because they worship the statue of the calf, which the Greeks renamed \\"Italoi\\" (worshipers of the calf), and governed by the famous Italian king of the same name, brother of Dardanus and ancestor of the Trojans. Italy gets its name from this figure. According to another legend, Catanzaro was named after two Byzantine generals Cattaro and Zaro who led the coastal city of Magna Graecia Skilletion or Skillakion, corresponding to the Roman Scolacium (near Catanzaro's Marina), first on Zarapotamo (today Santa Maria di Catanzaro) and then later on Trivonà, a military fortress. Catanzaro was always choice land due to its safe, high location, and the territory was under several groups' control, including the Saracens, Normans, Catalans and Venetians. The Saracens were the first to push the town's development to its highest regions by the second half of the ninth century. Byzantine general Nikephoros Phokas was responsible for the naming of the \\"Rock of Niceforo\\". Catanzaro's development into a fortress town was established by General Flagizio, who began the construction of a citadel, which later assumed the name of Katantzárion. According to some assumptions, the name is inspired from the development of workshops for creating silk, what the Greeks call \\"Katartarioi\\" (Καταρτάριοι) (spinners of silk). At the beginning of the tenth century (circa 903), the Byzantine city was occupied by the Saracens, who founded an emirate and took the Arab name of قطنصار - QaTanSáar. An Arab presence is evidenced by findings at an eighth-century necropolis which had items with Arabic inscriptions. Around the year 1050, Catanzaro rebelled against Saracen dominance and returned to a brief period of Byzantine control. In 1069, Catanzaro was the last city in Calabria, after many months of resistance, to fall under siege by the Normans of Robert Guiscard, who built the Norman castle, still in existence today. During this era, arts and crafts pioneered, and particularly the processing of silk, which was traded with other regions in Italy, other countries and Eastern Europe. Between the 9th and the 11th century Catanzaro was the first centre to introduce silk production to Italy. The silk of Catanzaro supplied almost all of Europe and was sold in a large market fair to Spanish, Venetian, Genoese and Dutch merchants. Catanzaro became the lace capital of Europe with a large silkworm breeding facility that produced all the laces and linens used in the Vatican. The city was world-famous for its fine fabrication of silks, velvets, damasks and brocadeshttps://www.madeinitalyfor.me/en/info/lantica-e-nobile-arte- serica/ https://www.britannica.com/place/Catanzaro-Italy. While the cultivation of mulberry was moving first steps in Northern Italy, silk made in Calabria reached the peak of 50% of the whole Italian/European production. As the cultivation of mulberry was difficult in Northern and Continental Europe, merchants and operators used to purchase in Calabria raw materials in order to finish the products and resell them for a better price. The Genoese silk artisans used fine Calabrian silk for the production of velvets. In the 13th century, Emperor Frederick II made Catanzaro a direct possession of the crown. Later the city was the household feud of the Ruffo, Caraffa and Soriano families. The Normans elevated Catanzaro into a noble county, giving it to Peter Ruffo. The latter was lost in a struggle against Manfred of Sicily, but he later returned to the city, when Charles I of Anjou signed the peace of the War of the Vespers. For fourteen years, it was the royal domain of King Ladislao of Naples, and in 1420 it was returned again to Nicholas Ruffo, who gave it as part of a dowry for his daughter Enrichetta who was married to Antonio Centelles. After a rebellion by the rural people, King Alfonso V of Aragon took control of the city. In 1460 there was a war with the partisans of Centelles. When peace returned, the city was granted new privileges which greatly promoted the development of its silk industry, for which its damasks were known throughout Europe. From this time forward, Catanzaro firmly established itself as an import center for its textile productions. In 1519 Emperor Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor formally recognized the growth of the industry of Catanzaro by allowing the city to establish a consulate of the silk craft, charged with regulating and check in the various stages of a production that flourished throughout the sixteenth century. At the moment of the creation of its guild, the city declared that it had over 500 looms. By 1660, when the town had about 16,000 inhabitants, its silk industry kept 1,000 looms, and at least 5,000 people, busy. The silk textiles of Catanzaro were not only sold at the kingdom's markets, they were also exported to Venice, France, Spain and England. In 1528 Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor gave authorization for Catanzaro to bear the imperial eagle attached to a coat of arms depicting the hill tops of the town. On 23 December 1961, at the Fiumarella viaduct near Catanzaro, there was a serious rail accident, when a train derailed and fell about into the river below. Seventy-one passengers lost their lives on impact, and 28 others were injured to varying degrees. In 1970 Catanzaro was designated to be the capital of Calabria.

They are particularly prolific in Australia, although there are also some examples from Europe and North America.. Street press publications are usually available free to the reader. They are distributed by being made available to passers-by at locations such as restaurants, cafes, bars, clubs, live music venues, community centres and record stores. To financially support themselves, street press publications usually take on more advertisements and sponsorship than other forms of media. Most street press publications are printed on low-quality newspaper stock to reduce costs. Some of the bigger publications print their covers and first few pages in colour, a rarer few use glossy paper for their cover. Virtually none of them print more than a couple of pages in colour. The size varies widely, some are printed in broadsheet format, some in tabloid format, and some in magazine-sized format. Non-standard paper sizes are also common, especially in the more obscure publications. Street press publications are usually also more professional in appearance and composition than zines, with established business structures and relatively mainstream content. Street press publications tend to have more mainstream, broad-appeal subject matter than zines so they can attract sponsors, and increase readership. Street press publications can cover a wide variety of topics, many are focused upon specific subject matter of a target audience. Common topics include culture or entertainment topics, such independent or alternative music. Other niche publications might involve political satire, gay and/or lesbian issues, and film. Community newspapers, delivered to households, usually weekly, which consist primarily of localised news, do not fall into this category.

He played for the Boston Red Sox, Arizona Diamondbacks, Kansas City Royals, Pittsburgh Pirates, St. Louis Cardinals, Milwaukee Brewers and San Diego Padres. Since 2015, Suppan has been the pitching coach for the Idaho Falls Chukars in the Kansas City Royals system. Early life Suppan pitched at Crespi Carmelite High School in California's San Fernando Valley. He pitched one no-hitter as a freshman and another as a senior against Harvard-Westlake School in the midst of a 42-inning scoreless streak. Suppan also played first base and hit .480 with a .950 slugging percentage as a senior. As a pitcher, he had a 0.73 WHIP, a 0.92 earned run average and a 9.07 strikeout-to-walk ratio. The Los Angeles Times named him their 1993 San Fernando Valley Player of the Year. Suppan committed to play college baseball at UCLA over offers from USC, Nevada, Cal and Cal State Long Beach. He was selected by the Boston Red Sox with the 49th pick of the 1993 Major League Baseball draft and signed for $190,000. Professional career Boston Red Sox He played with the Red Sox through the 1997 season. In his first three seasons, Suppan compiled a 9–6 record, his 1997 season marked his only season in Boston in which he made more than 10 starts. Although his record was 7–3 in 1997, his ERA was 5.69 in 22 starts. Arizona Diamondbacks Suppan was picked up by the expansion Arizona Diamondbacks in 1998. In his lone season with Arizona, Suppan was 1–7 in 13 starts with a 6.68 ERA. Kansas City Royals Late in the 1998 season, he was traded to the Kansas City Royals. Suppan was a mainstay for the Royals rotation, averaging 33 starts and 10 wins through his 4 seasons with the team. From 1999 to 2001, Suppan won 10 games in each season. In 2002, Suppan suffered his worst season as a Royal, going 9-16 in 33 starts. Pittsburgh Pirates In 2003, he opened the season for the Pittsburgh Pirates after signing a one-year deal with them in January. Through 21 starts, Suppan was 10–7 with a 3.57 ERA for the Pirates. Second Stint with Boston Suppan was dealt at the trading deadline back to the Red Sox for their playoff stretch run. Suppan did not perform well during Boston's stretch run. He went 3–4 with a 5.57 ERA and surrendering 12 home runs. St. Louis Cardinals The Cardinals signed Suppan as a free agent in 2004, and he embarked upon a career year, posting a 16–9 record and a 4.16 earned run average, with 110 strikeouts, 65 walks, and 192 hits allowed in 188 innings. Suppan helped lead the Cards to the 2004 World Series, where he started Game 3. His baserunning blunder in game 3 was one of the defining moments of the Series. In 2005, he improved on his previous year's performance, going 16–10 with a 3.57 ERA. He started Game 4 of the National League Championship series against the Houston Astros, allowing one run over five innings but came away with a no-decision after the Astros took the lead later in the game. Suppan has hit two career Major League home runs, both off Steve Trachsel of the New York Mets. His first was on September 10, 2005. The Cardinals won the game 4–2. He hit his second in Game 3 of the 2006 National League Championship Series. The Cardinals would win the game 5–0 to take a 2–1 lead in the series.

Suppan in the 2006 NLCS had a 0.60 ERA in 15 innings pitched. Milwaukee Brewers During the 2006 offseason Suppan signed a four-year, $42 million contract with the Milwaukee Brewers. Initial excitement in Milwaukee quickly waned as Suppan's performance declined over time. From 2007 to 2009, his walk rate, home runs allowed, and ERA climbed while his strikeouts declined. While pitching in Milwaukee fans began an odd practice of wearing paper bags over their heads and throwing soup cans on to the field during Suppan's starts. Between 1995 and 2006, Suppan held a career ERA of 1.76 at Miller Park, where he was to pitch for the Brewers in 2007. Suppan is one of only 8 ballplayers who pitched in the NL in 2007 who won at least 12 games in each year from 2004–07, the others being Carlos Zambrano, Greg Maddux, Roy Oswalt, Tim Hudson, Derek Lowe, Jason Marquis and Johan Santana.

Suppan opted for free agency over a minor league assignment with the Padres on June 5, 2012, according to the Padres' official website. Retirement Suppan announced his retirement as a player on January 2, 2014, his 39th birthday.

Since 2015, Suppan has been the pitching coach for the Idaho Falls Chukars of the Pioneer League. The Chukars are the Rookie-Advanced affiliate of Suppan's former team, the Kansas City Royals. . In 2019, Suppan left the Chukars to become a roving minor league co- ordinator for the Royals organization.Royals announce minor league coaching staff for 2019 - Royals Review Pitching style As with many older pitchers, Suppan relies comparatively little on pitch speed to get outs. He is a finesse pitcher, using a variety of pitches with good movement to create weak contact for hitters. His expansive pitch repertoire includes a four-seam fastball and sinker in the mid-upper 80s, a cut fastball in the low-mid 80s, a changeup around 80, a big curveball at 70 and a slider in the upper 70s. Restaurant Suppan, whose nickname is \\"Soup,\\" is also a restaurateur. His restaurant, Soup's Grill, is jointly operated with his wife. It is located in Woodland Hills, California.

He has spoken to the National Catholic Register about his faith. He appeared in a political advertisement alongside Patricia Heaton, Jim Caviezel, Mike Sweeney, and Kurt Warner, among others, during the 2006 World Series. The advertisement aired in opposition to Missouri Constitutional Amendment 2 (2006), which allows in Missouri any kind of embryonic stem cell research that is legal under federal law. The advertisement aired shortly after the airing of an earlier advertisement featuring actor Michael J. Fox. The Fox advertisement had supported Amendment 2, as well as the campaign of United States Senate candidate Claire McCaskill. The Suppan advertisement did not explicitly mention the Senate race. The timing of both ads during a World Series that featured the St. Louis Cardinals was intended to draw the particular attention of Missouri voters.

Singapore was the major British military base in South-East Asia and was the key to British imperial interwar defence planning for South-East Asia and the South-West Pacific. The fighting in Singapore lasted from 8 to 15 February 1942, after the two months during which Japanese forces had advanced down the Malayan Peninsula. The campaign, including the final battle, was a decisive Japanese victory, resulting in the Japanese capture of Singapore and the largest British surrender in history. About 80,000 British, Indian and Australian troops in Singapore became prisoners of war, joining 50,000 taken by the Japanese in the earlier Malayan Campaign. Famously, about 40,000 mostly Indian soldiers would join the Indian National Army and fight alongside the Japanese. British prime minister, Winston Churchill, called it the \\"worst disaster\\" in British military history. Background Outbreak of war During 1940 and 1941, the Allies imposed a trade embargo on Japan in response to its continued campaigns in China and its occupation of French Indochina. The basic plan for taking Singapore was worked out in July 1940. Intelligence gained in late 1940 – early 1941 did not alter that plan, but confirmed it in the minds of Japanese decision makers. On 11 November 1940, the German raider Atlantis captured the British steamer Automedon in the Indian Ocean, carrying papers meant for Air Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, the British commander in the Far East. The papers included much information about the weakness of the Singapore base. In December 1940, the Germans handed over copies of the papers to the Japanese. The Japanese had broken the British Army's codes and in January 1941, the Second Department (the intelligence-gathering arm) of the Imperial Army interpreted and read a message from Singapore to London complaining in much detail about the weak state of \\"Fortress Singapore\\", a message so frank in its admission of weakness that the Japanese at first suspected it was a British plant, believing that no officer would be so open in admitting weaknesses to his superiors. Only after cross-checking the message with the Automedon papers did the Japanese accept it to be genuine. Japan's oil reserves were rapidly depleted by the ongoing military operations in China and by industrial consumption. In the latter half of 1941 the Japanese began preparing a military response to secure vital resources if diplomatic efforts to resolve the situation failed. As a part of this process, planners determined a broad scheme of manoeuvre that incorporated simultaneous attacks on the territories of Britain, The Netherlands and the United States. This would see landings in Malaya and Hong Kong as part of a general move south to secure Singapore, connected to Malaya by the Johor–Singapore Causeway, and then an invasion of the oil-rich area of Borneo and Java in the Dutch East Indies. In addition, strikes would be made against the United States naval fleet at Pearl Harbor, as well as landings in the Philippines, and attacks on Guam, Wake Island and the Gilbert Islands. Following these attacks, a period of consolidation was planned, after which the Japanese planners intended to build up the defences of the territory that had been captured by establishing a strong perimeter around it stretching from the India–Burma frontier through to Wake Island, and traversing Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, New Guinea and New Britain, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the Marshall and Gilbert Islands. This perimeter would be used to block Allied attempts to regain the lost territory and defeat their will to fight. Invasion of Malaya The Japanese 25th Army invaded from Indochina, moving into northern Malaya and Thailand by amphibious assault on 8 December 1941. This was virtually simultaneous with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor which precipitated the United States entry into the war. Thailand initially resisted, but soon had to yield. The Japanese then proceeded overland across the Thai–Malayan border to attack Malaya. At this time, the Japanese began bombing strategic sites in Singapore. The Japanese 25th Army was resisted in northern Malaya by III Corps of the British Indian Army. Although the 25th Army was outnumbered by Allied forces in Malaya and Singapore, the Allies did not take the initiative with their forces, while Japanese commanders concentrated their forces. The Japanese were superior in close air support, armour, co-ordination, tactics and experience. While conventional British military thinking was that the Japanese forces were inferior, and characterised the Malayan jungles as \\"impassable\\", the Japanese were repeatedly able to use it to their advantage to outflank hastily established defensive lines. Prior to the Battle of Singapore the most resistance was met at the Battle of Muar, which involved the Australian 8th Division and the Indian 45th Brigade, as the British troops left in the city of Singapore were basically garrison troops. At the start of the campaign, the Allied forces had only 164 first-line aircraft on hand in Malaya and Singapore, and the only fighter type was the obsolete Brewster 339E Buffalo. These aircraft were operated by five squadrons: one Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF), two Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), and two Royal Air Force (RAF). Major shortcomings included a slow rate of climb and the aircraft's fuel system which required the pilot to hand pump fuel if flying above . In contrast, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force was more numerous and better trained than the second- hand assortment of untrained pilots and inferior allied equipment remaining in Malaya, Borneo and Singapore. Their fighter aircraft were superior to the Allied fighters, which helped the Japanese to gain air supremacy. Although outnumbered and outclassed, the Buffalos were able to provide some resistance, with RAAF pilots alone managing to shoot down at least 20 Japanese aircraft before the few that survived were withdrawn. View of the blown up causeway, with the gap visible in the middle, which delayed the Japanese conquest for over a week to 8 February Force Z, consisting of the battleship , the battlecruiser and four destroyers, sailed north out of Singapore on 8 December to oppose expected Japanese landings along the coast of Malaya. Japanese land- based aircraft found and sank the two capital ships on 10 December, leaving the east coast of the Malayan Peninsula exposed and allowing the Japanese to continue their amphibious landings. Japanese forces quickly isolated, surrounded, and forced the surrender of Indian units defending the coast. Despite their numerical inferiority, they advanced down the Malayan Peninsula, overwhelming the defences. The Japanese forces also used bicycle infantry and light tanks, allowing swift movement through the jungle. The Allies, however, having thought the terrain made them impractical, had no tanks and only a few armoured vehicles, which put them at a severe disadvantage. Although more Allied units—including some from the Australian 8th Division—joined the campaign, the Japanese prevented the Allied forces from regrouping. They also overran cities and advanced toward Singapore. That city was an anchor for the operations of the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM), the first Allied joint command of the Second World War. Singapore controlled the main shipping channel between the Indian and the Pacific Oceans. An effective ambush was carried out by the Australian 2/30th Battalion on the main road at the Gemenceh River near Gemas on 14 January, causing heavy Japanese casualties. At Bakri, from 18 to 22 January, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Anderson's Australian 2/19th Battalion and the Australian 2/29th Battalion repeatedly fought through Japanese positions before running out of ammunition near Parit Sulong. Anderson's composite force of 2/19th Battalion, 2/29th Battalion and 45th Indian Brigade survivors were forced to leave behind about 110 Australian and 40 Indian wounded, who were later beaten, tortured and then murdered by the Japanese during the Parit Sulong Massacre; Of over 3,000 men from these units only around 500 made it back to friendly lines. For his leadership in the fighting withdrawal, Anderson was awarded the Victoria Cross. A determined counterattack from Lieutenant-Colonel John Parkin's 5/11th Sikh Regiment in the area of Niyor, near Kluang, on 25 January, and a successful ambush around the Nithsdale Estate by the Australian 2/18th Battalion on 26/27 January, bought valuable time and permitted Brigadier Harold Taylor's Eastforce—based on the Australian 22nd Brigade—to withdraw from eastern Johore. On 31 January, the last Allied forces left Malaya and Allied engineers blew a hole in the causeway linking Johor and Singapore. Prelude Woodlands Road and the railway, connecting the city centre (in the south-east) and The Causeway (central north), is the black line running through the centre of the island. Sarimbun is at the north-west corner of the island; Bukit Timah is located close to the centre on the transport corridor; Pasir Panjang is between the city centre and the southwest corner of the island and the \\"Jurong Line\\" is the bracket-like shape in red, just west of Woodlands Road. During the weeks preceding the invasion, the Allied force suffered a number of both subdued and openly disruptive disagreements amongst its senior commanders, as well as pressure from Australian Prime Minister John Curtin. Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival, commander of the garrison, had 85,000 soldiers, the equivalent, on paper at least, of just over four divisions. Of this figure, 15,000 men were employed in logistical, administrative, or other non-combatant roles. The remaining force was a mix of front-line and second-line troops. There were 49 infantry battalions—21 Indian, 13 British, six Australian, four Indian States Forces assigned to airfield defence, 3 Straits Settlements Volunteer Force, and 2 Malayan. In addition, there were two British machine-gun battalions, one Australian, and a British reconnaissance battalion. The newly arrived British 18th Infantry Division—under Major-General Merton Beckwith-Smith—was at full strength, but lacked experience and appropriate training. The rest of the force was of mixed quality, condition, training, equipment, and morale. Lionel Wigmore, the Australian official historian of the Malayan Campaign, wrote > Only one of the Indian battalions was up to numerical strength, three (in > the 44th Brigade) had recently arrived in a semi-trained condition, nine had > been hastily reorganised with a large intake of raw recruits, and four were > being re-formed but were far from being fit for action.

Percival gave Major-General Gordon Bennett's two brigades from the Australian 8th Division responsibility for the western side of Singapore, including the prime invasion points in the northwest of the island. This was mostly mangrove swamp and jungle, broken by rivers and creeks. In the heart of the \\"Western Area\\" was RAF Tengah, Singapore's largest airfield at the time. The Australian 22nd Brigade, under Brigadier Harold Taylor, was assigned a wide sector in the west, and the 27th Brigade, under Brigadier Duncan Maxwell, had responsibility for a zone just west of the Causeway. The infantry positions were reinforced by the recently arrived Australian 2/4th Machine-Gun Battalion. Also under Bennett's command was the 44th Indian Infantry Brigade. 8th Division disembark at Singapore Harbour The Indian III Corps under Lieutenant-General Sir Lewis Heath—including the Indian 11th Infantry Division under Major-General B. W. Key with reinforcements from the 8th Indian Brigade, and the British 18th Division—was assigned the north-eastern sector, known as the \\"Northern Area\\". This included the naval base at Sembawang. The \\"Southern Area\\"—including the main urban areas in the south-east—was commanded by Major-General Frank Keith Simmons. His forces consisted of elements of the 1st Malaya Infantry Brigade and the Straits Settlements Volunteer Force Brigade with the Indian 12th Infantry Brigade in reserve. From 3 February, the Allies were shelled by Japanese artillery, and air attacks on Singapore intensified over the next five days. The artillery and air bombardment strengthened, severely disrupting communications between Allied units and their commanders and affecting preparations for the defence of the island. From aerial reconnaissance, scouts, infiltrators and observation from high ground across the straits (such as at Istana Bukit Serene and the Sultan of Johor's palace), Japanese commander General Tomoyuki Yamashita and his staff gained excellent knowledge of the Allied positions. Yamashita and his officers stationed themselves at Istana Bukit Serene and the Johor state secretariat building—the Sultan Ibrahim Building—to plan for the invasion of Singapore. Although advised by his top military personnel that Istana Bukit Serene was an easy target, Yamashita was confident that the British Army would not attack the palace because it belonged to the Sultan of Johor. Yamashita's prediction was correct; despite being observed by Australian artillery, permission to engage the palace was denied by their commanding general, Bennett. One of Singapore's 15-inch coastal defence guns elevated for firing It is a commonly repeated misconception that Singapore's famous large-calibre coastal guns were ineffective against the Japanese because they were designed to face south to defend the harbour against naval attack and could not be turned round to face north. In fact, most of the guns could be turned, and were indeed fired at the invaders. However, the guns—which included one battery of three weapons and one with two guns—were supplied mostly with armor-piercing shells (AP) and few high explosive (HE) shells. AP shells were designed to penetrate the hulls of heavily armoured warships and were mostly ineffective against infantry targets. Military analysts later estimated that if the guns had been well supplied with HE shells the Japanese attackers would have suffered heavy casualties, but the invasion would not have been prevented by this means alone. Percival incorrectly guessed that the Japanese would land forces on the north-east side of Singapore, ignoring advice that the north-west was a more likely direction of attack (where the Straits of Johor were the narrowest and a series of river mouths provided cover for the launching of water craft). This was encouraged by the deliberate movement of enemy troops in this sector to deceive the British. As such, a large portion of defence equipment and resources had been incorrectly allocated to the north east sector, where the most complete and freshest formation—the British 18th Division—was deployed, while the incomplete Australian 8th Division sector with just two brigades had no serious fixed defensive works or obstacles. To compound matters, Percival had ordered the Australians to defend forward so as to cover the waterway, yet this meant they were immediately fully committed to any fighting, limiting their flexibility, whilst also reducing their defensive depth. The two Australian brigades were subsequently allocated a very wide frontage of over and were separated by the Kranji River. Yamashita had just over 30,000 men from three divisions: the Imperial Guards Division under Lieutenant-General Takuma Nishimura, the 5th Division under Lieutenant-General Takuro Matsui and the 18th Division under Lieutenant-General Renya Mutaguchi. Also in support was a light tank brigade. In comparison, following the withdrawal, Percival had about 85,000 men at his disposal, although 15,000 were administrative personnel, while large numbers were semi-trained British, Indian and Australian reinforcements that had only recently arrived. Meanwhile, of those forces that had seen action during the previous fighting, the majority were under-strength and under-equipped. In the days leading up to the Japanese attack, patrols from the Australian 22nd Brigade were sent across the strait to Johor at night to gather intelligence. Three small patrols were sent on the evening of 6 February; one was spotted and withdrew after its leader was killed and their boat sunk, while two others managed to get ashore. Over the course of a day, they found large concentrations of troops, although they were unable to locate any landing craft. The Australians requested the shelling of these positions to disrupt the Japanese preparations, but the patrol reports were later ignored by Malaya Command as being insignificant, based upon the belief that the real assault would come in the north-eastern sector, not the north-west. Battle Initial Japanese landings The Japanese landings on Singapore Island Blowing up the causeway had delayed the Japanese attack for over a week. Prior to the main assault, the Australians were subjected to an intense artillery bombardment. Over a period of 15 hours, starting at 23:00 on 8 February 1942, Yamashita's heavy guns laid down a barrage of 88,000 shells (200 rounds per tube) along the entire length of the straits, cutting telephone lines and effectively isolating forward units from rear areas. Even at this stage, a counter artillery barrage as a response could have been mounted by the British on the coastline opposite the Australians that would have caused casualties and disruption among the Japanese assault troops. But the bombardment of the Australians was not seen as a prelude to imminent attack—Malaya Command believed that it would last several days and would later switch its focus to the north-east, despite its ferocity exceeding anything the Allies had experienced thus far in the campaign; consequently, no order was passed to the Allied artillery units to begin targeting possible Japanese assembly areas. Shortly before 20:30 on 8 February, the first wave of Japanese troops from the 5th and 18th Divisions began crossing the Johor Strait. The main weight of the Japanese force, representing a total of about 13,000 men across 16 assault battalions, with five in reserve, was focused on assaulting Taylor's Australian 22nd Brigade, which totalled just three battalions. The assault would be concentrated on the 2/18th and 2/20th Battalions; with each division allocated 150 barges and collapsible boats, the Japanese could move approximately 4,000 men across the strait at any one time. In total, 13,000 Japanese troops landed throughout the first night; they were followed by another 10,000 after first light. Against this the defenders numbered just 3,000 men and lacked any significant reserve. As the landing craft closed on the Australian positions, machine gunners from the 2/4th Machine Gun Battalion, interspersed amongst the deployed rifle companies, opened fire. Spotlights had been sited by a British unit on the beaches to enable the Australians to clearly see any attacking forces on the water in front of them, but many had been damaged by the earlier bombardment and no order was made to turn the others on. The initial wave was concentrated against the positions occupied by the 2/18th and 2/20th Battalions, around the Buloh River, as well as one company from the 2/19th Battalion. Over the course of an hour, heavy fighting took place on the 2/19th Battalion's right flank, until these positions were overrun and the Japanese were able to push their way inland using cover and concealment provided by the darkness and the surrounding vegetation. The resistance put up by the company from the 2/19th pushed the follow-on waves of Japanese craft to land around the mouth of Murai River, which resulted in them creating a gap between the 2/19th and 2/18th. From there the Japanese launched two concerted attacks against the 2/18th, which were met with heavy fire before they eventually overwhelmed the defending Australians with weight of numbers. Urgent requests for fire support were sent out, and throughout the night the 2/15th Field Regiment fired over 4,800 rounds. Fierce fighting raged throughout the evening, but due to the terrain and the darkness, the Japanese were able to disperse into the undergrowth; in many situations, they were able to either surround and destroy pockets of Australian resistance, or bypass them entirely, exploiting gaps in the thinly spread Allied lines due to the many rivers and creeks in the area. By midnight, the two Japanese divisions fired starshells to indicate to their commander that they had secured their initial objectives, and by 01:00 they were well established. Over the course of two hours, the three Australian battalions that had been engaged sought to regroup, moving back east from the coast towards the centre of the island. Despite being in contact with the enemy, this was completed mainly in good order. The 2/20th managed to concentrate three of its four companies around the Namazie Estate, although one was left behind; the 2/18th was only able to concentrate half its strength at Ama Keng, while the 2/19th also moved back three companies, leaving a fourth to defend Tengah airfield. Further fighting followed throughout the early morning of 9 February, and the Australians were pushed back further, with the 2/18th being pushed out of Ama Keng and the 2/20th being forced to pull back to Bulim, west of Bukit Panjong. Meanwhile, bypassed elements attempted to break out and fall back to the Tengah airfield to rejoin their units and in doing so received heavy casualties. Bennett attempted to reinforce the 22nd Brigade by moving the 2/29th Battalion from the 27th Brigade's area to Tengah, but before it could be used to recapture Ama Keng, the Japanese launched another attack around the airfield, and the 2/29th was forced to assume a defensive posture. The initial fighting cost the Australians heavily, with one battalion alone, the 2/20th, losing 334 men killed and 214 wounded. Air war Sembawang Airfield The aerial campaign for Singapore began at the outset of the invasion of Malaya. Early on 8 December 1941, Singapore was bombed for the first time by long-range Japanese aircraft, such as the Mitsubishi G3M2 \\"Nell\\" and the Mitsubishi G4M1 \\"Betty\\", based in Japanese-occupied Indochina. The bombers struck the city centre as well as the Sembawang Naval Base and the island's northern airfields. After this first raid, throughout the rest of December, there were a number of false alerts and several infrequent and sporadic hit-and-run attacks on outlying military installations such as the Naval Base, but no actual raids on Singapore City. The situation had become so desperate that one British soldier took to the middle of a road to fire his Vickers machine gun at any aircraft that passed. He could only say: \\"The bloody bastards will never think of looking for me in the open, and I want to see a bloody plane brought down.\\" The next recorded raid on the city occurred on the night of 29 December, and nightly raids ensued for over a week, only to be accompanied by daylight raids from 12 January 1942 onward. In the days that followed, as the Japanese army drew ever nearer to Singapore Island, the day and night raids increased in frequency and intensity, resulting in thousands of civilian casualties, up to the time of the British surrender. Firefighters battle the results of a Japanese air raid on 8 February 1942. During the month of December, a total of 51 Hawker Hurricane Mk II fighters were sent to Singapore, with 24 pilots, the nuclei of five squadrons. They arrived on 3 January 1942, by which stage the Brewster Buffalo squadrons had been overwhelmed. No. 232 Squadron RAF was formed and No. 488 Squadron RNZAF, a Buffalo squadron, had converted to Hurricanes. 232 Squadron became operational on 20 January and destroyed three Nakajima Ki-43 \\"Oscars\\" that day, for the loss of three Hurricanes. However, like the Buffalos before them, the Hurricanes began to suffer severe losses in intense dogfights. During the period 27–30 January, another 48 Hurricanes arrived on the aircraft carrier . Operated by No. 226 Group RAF (four squadrons), they flew from an airfield code-named P1, near Palembang, Sumatra, in the Dutch East Indies, while a flight was maintained in Singapore. However, many of the Hurricanes were subsequently destroyed on the ground by air raids. Indeed, the lack of an effective air early warning system throughout the campaign meant that many Allied aircraft were lost in this manner during a series of Japanese attacks against airfields. Hawker Hurricane of No. 232 Squadron RAF shot down on 8 February, along the East Coast Road By the time of the invasion, only ten Hawker Hurricane fighters of No. 232 Squadron RAF, based at RAF Kallang, remained to provide air cover to the Allied forces on Singapore. This was because the airfields of Tengah, Seletar and Sembawang were in range of Japanese artillery at Johor Bahru. RAF Kallang was the only operational airstrip left; the surviving squadrons and aircraft had withdrawn by January to reinforce the Dutch East Indies. On the morning of 9 February, a series of aerial dogfights took place over Sarimbun Beach and other western areas. In the first encounter, the last ten Hurricanes were scrambled from Kallang Airfield to intercept a Japanese formation of about 84 planes, flying from Johor to provide air cover for their invasion force. The Hurricanes shot down six Japanese planes, and damaged 14 others, for the loss of one of their own. Air battles went on for the rest of the day, and by nightfall it was clear that with the few aircraft Percival had left, Kallang could no longer be used as a base. With his assent, the remaining flyable Hurricanes were withdrawn to Sumatra. A squadron of Hurricane fighters took to the skies on 9 February, but was then withdrawn to the Netherlands East Indies and after that no Allied aircraft were seen again over Singapore; the Japanese had achieved complete air supremacy.Percival's despatches published in That evening, three Fairmile Motor Launches attacked and sank several Japanese landing craft in the Johor Strait around its western channel on the evening of 9 February. Later, on the evening of 10 February, General Archibald Wavell, commander of American-British-Dutch-Australian Command, ordered the transfer of all remaining Allied air force personnel to the Dutch East Indies. By this time, Kallang Airfield was so pitted with bomb craters that it was no longer usable. Second day Inscription at Kranji War Memorial Believing that further landings would occur in the northeast, Percival did not reinforce the 22nd Brigade until the morning of 9 February; when he did, the forces dispatched consisted of two half-strength battalions from the 12th Indian Infantry Brigade. These units reached Bennett around midday, and, shortly afterwards Percival allocated the composite 6th/15th Indian Infantry Brigade to reinforce Bennett's force to move from their position around the Singapore racecourse. Throughout the day, the 44th Indian Infantry Brigade, still holding its position on the coast, began to feel pressure on its exposed flank, and after discussions between Percival and Bennett, it was decided that they would have to be pulled back east to maintain the southern part of the Allied line. Bennett decided to form a secondary defensive line, known as the \\"Kranji- Jurong Switch Line\\", oriented to the west, and positioned between the two rivers, with its centre around Bulim, east of Tengah Airfield—which subsequently came under Japanese control—and just north of Jurong. To the north, Maxwell's Australian 27th Brigade had not been engaged during the initial Japanese assaults on the first day. Possessing only two battalions, the 2/26th and 2/30th, following the loss of the 2/29th Battalion to the 22nd Brigade, Maxwell sought to reorganise his force to deal with the threat posed to their western flank. Late on 9 February, the Imperial Guards began assaulting the positions held by the 27th Brigade, concentrating on those held by the 2/26th Battalion. During the initial assault, the Japanese suffered severe casualties from Australian mortars and machine guns, and from burning oil which had been sluiced into the water following the demolition of several oil tanks by the defending Australians. Some of the Guards reached the shore and maintained a tenuous beachhead; nevertheless, at the height of the assault, it is reported that the Guards commander, Nishimura, requested permission to cancel the attack due to the heavy casualties his troops had suffered from the fire. This request was denied by the Japanese commander, Yamashita, who ordered them to press on. A column of smoke from burning oil tanks of Singapore Naval Base Command and control problems caused further cracks in the Allied defence. Maxwell was aware that the 22nd Brigade was under increasing pressure, but was unable to contact Taylor and was wary of encirclement. As parties of Japanese troops began to infiltrate the brigade's position from the west, exploiting the gap formed by the Kranji River, the 2/26th Battalion was forced to withdraw to a position east of the Bukit Timah Road; this move subsequently precipitated a sympathetic move by the 2/30th away from the causeway. The authority for this withdrawal would later be the subject of debate, with Bennett later stating that he had not given Maxwell authorisation to do so. Regardless, the end result was that the Allies lost control of the beaches adjoining the west side of the causeway. In doing so, the high ground overlooking the causeway was given up, and the left flank of the 11th Indian Division exposed. In addition, it provided the Japanese with a firm foothold, giving them the opportunity to \\"build up their force unopposed\\". Japanese breakthrough The opening at Kranji made it possible for Imperial Guards armoured units to land there unopposed, after which they were able to begin ferrying across their artillery and armour. After finding his left flank exposed by the 27th Brigade's withdrawal, the commander of the 11th Indian Infantry Division, Key, dispatched his reserve brigade, the 8th, to retake the high ground to the south of the Causeway. Throughout the 10th, further fighting took place around along the Jurong Line, as orders were formulated to establish a secondary defensive line to the west of the Reformatory Road with troops not then employed in the Jurong Line; misinterpretation of these orders resulted in Taylor, the commander of the 22nd Brigade, prematurely withdrawing his troops to the east, where they were joined by a 200-strong ad hoc battalion of Australian reinforcements, known as 'X' Battalion. The Jurong Line eventually collapsed, though, after the 12th Indian Brigade was withdrawn by its commander, Brigadier Archie Paris, to the road junction near Bukit Panjang, after he lost contact with the 27th Brigade on his right; the commander of the 44th Indian Brigade, Ballantine, commanding the extreme left of the line, also misinterpreted the orders in the same manner that Taylor had and withdrew. On the evening of 10 February, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, cabled Wavell, saying: Upon learning of the Jurong Line's collapse, Wavell, in the early afternoon of 10 February, ordered Percival to launch a counterattack to retake it. This order was subsequently passed on to Bennett, who allocated the ad hoc Australian 'X' Battalion to the task. Percival made plans of his own for the counterattack, detailing a three- phased operation that involved the majority of the 22nd Brigade, and he subsequently passed this on to Bennett, who began implementing the plan, but forgot to call 'X' Battalion back. 'X' Battalion, consisting of poorly trained and equipped replacements, subsequently advanced to an assembly area near Bukit Timah. In the early hours of 11 February, the Japanese, who had concentrated significant forces around the Tengah airfield and on the Jurong Road, began further offensive operations: the 5th Division aimed its advance towards Bukit Panjang, while the 18th struck out towards Bukit Timah. There, they fell upon 'X' Battalion, which had camped in its assembly area while waiting to launch its own attack, and in the ensuing fight two-thirds of the battalion was killed or wounded. After brushing aside elements of the 6th/15th Indian Brigade, the Japanese again began attacking the Australian 22nd Brigade around the Reformatory Road. Later on 11 February, with Japanese supplies running low, Yamashita attempted to bluff Percival, calling on him to \\"give up this meaningless and desperate resistance\\". By this stage, the fighting strength of the 22nd Brigade—which had borne the brunt of the Japanese attacks—had been reduced to a few hundred men, and the Japanese had captured the Bukit Timah area, including the Allies' main food and fuel supply depots. Nevertheless, Wavell subsequently told Percival that the ground forces were to fight on to the end, and that there should not be a general surrender in Singapore. With the vital water supply of the reservoirs in the centre of the island threatened, the Australian 27th Brigade was later ordered to recapture Bukit Panjang as a preliminary move in retaking Bukit Timah. The effort was beaten back by fierce resistance from Imperial Guards troops and the 27th was subsequently split in half either side of the Bukit Timah Road with elements spread as far as the Pierce Reservoir. The next day, as the situation worsened for the Allies, they sought to consolidate their defences; during the night of 12/13 February, the order was given for a perimeter to be established around Singapore City at the eastern end of the island. This was achieved by moving the defending forces from the beaches along the northern shore and from around Changi, with the British 18th Division being tasked to maintain control of the vital reservoirs and effecting a link up with Simmons' Southern Area forces. The withdrawing troops received harassing attacks all the way back. Elsewhere, the 22nd Brigade continued to hold a position west of the Holland Road until late in the evening when it was pulled back to Holland Village. On 13 February, Japanese engineers re-established the road over the causeway, and more tanks were pushed across. With the Allies still losing ground, senior officers advised Percival to surrender in the interests of minimising civilian casualties. Percival refused, but unsuccessfully sought authority from Wavell for greater discretion as to when resistance might cease. Elsewhere, the Japanese captured the water reservoirs that supplied the town, although they did not cut off the supply. That same day, military police executed Captain Patrick Heenan for espionage. An Air Liaison Officer with the British Indian Army, Heenan had been recruited by Japanese military intelligence, and he had used a radio to assist them in targeting Allied airfields in northern Malaya. He had been arrested on 10 December and court-martialled in January. Heenan was shot at Keppel Harbour, on the southern side of Singapore, and his body was thrown into the sea. The Australians occupied a perimeter of their own to the north-west around Tanglin Barracks, in which they maintained an all round defensive posture as a precaution to Japanese penetration of the larger perimeter elsewhere. To their right, the British 18th Division, the Indian 11th Division and the 2nd Malaya Brigade held the perimeter from the edge of the Farrar Road east to Kallang, while to their left, the 44th Indian Brigade and the 1st Malaya Brigade held the perimeter from Buona Vista to Pasir Panjang. For the most part, there was limited fighting around the perimeter, except around Pasir Panjang Ridge, just from Singapore Harbour, where the 1st Malaya Brigade—which consisted of a Malayan infantry battalion, two British infantry battalions and a force of Royal Engineers—fought a stubborn defensive action during the Battle of Pasir Panjang. The Japanese largely avoided attacking the Australian perimeter at this time, but in the northern area, the British 53rd Brigade was pushed back by a Japanese assault up the Thompson Road, and had to re-establish itself to the north of Braddell Road in the evening, joining the 18th Division's other two brigades—the 54th and 55th—in the line. They dug in and throughout the night fierce fighting raged on the northern front. The following day, the remaining Allied units fought on. Civilian casualties mounted as one million people crowded into the area still held by the Allies, and bombing and artillery fire increased. Civilian authorities began to fear that the water supply would give out. At this time, Percival was advised that large amounts of water were being lost due to damaged pipes and that the water supply was on the verge of collapse. Alexandra Hospital massacre A plaque commemorating the massacre and expanding on the hospital's history after the war On 14 February 1942, the Japanese renewed their assault on the western part of the Southern Area's defences, around the same area that the 1st Malayan Brigade had fought desperately to hold the previous day. At about 13:00, the Japanese broke through and they advanced towards the Alexandra Barracks Hospital. A British lieutenant—acting as an envoy with a white flag—approached Japanese forces but was killed with a bayonet. After Japanese troops entered the hospital they killed up to 50 soldiers, including some undergoing surgery. Doctors and nurses were also killed. The next day about 200 male staff members and patients who had been assembled and bound the previous day, many of them walking wounded, were ordered to walk about to an industrial area. Those who fell on the way were bayoneted. The men were forced into a series of small, badly ventilated rooms where they were held overnight without water. Some died during the night as a result of their treatment. The remainder were bayoneted the following morning. Several survivors were identified after the war, with some having survived by pretending to be dead. One survivor, Private Arthur Haines from the Wiltshire Regiment, wrote a four-page account of the massacre that was sold by his daughter by private auction in 2008. Fall of Singapore Yamashita (seated, centre) thumps the table with his fist to emphasise his terms – unconditional surrender. Percival sits between his officers, his clenched hand to his mouth. Throughout the night of 14/15 February the Japanese continued to press against the Allied perimeter, but the line largely held. Nevertheless, the military supply situation was rapidly deteriorating. The water system was badly damaged and continued supply was uncertain, rations were running low, petrol for military vehicles was all but exhausted, and there were few rounds left for the field artillery. The anti- aircraft guns were almost out of ammunition, and were unable to disrupt Japanese air attacks, which were causing heavy casualties in the city centre. Little work had been done to build air raid shelters, and looting and desertion by Allied troops further added to the chaos in this area. At 09:30, Percival held a conference at Fort Canning with his senior commanders. He proposed two options: either launch an immediate counter-attack to regain the reservoirs and the military food depots in the Bukit Timah region, or surrender. After heated argument and recrimination, all present agreed that no counterattack was possible. Percival opted for surrender. Post war analysis has shown, though, that had Percival opted for a counterattack at that time, it might have been successful. The Japanese were at the limit of their supply line, and their artillery had just a few hours of ammunition left. A deputation was selected to go to the Japanese headquarters. It consisted of a senior staff officer, the colonial secretary and an interpreter. They set off in a motor car bearing a Union Jack and a white flag of truce toward the enemy lines to discuss a cessation of hostilities. They returned with orders that Percival himself proceed with staff officers to the Ford Motor Factory, where Yamashita would lay down the terms of surrender. A further requirement was that the Japanese Rising Sun Flag be hoisted over the tallest building in Singapore, the Cathay Building. Percival formally surrendered shortly after 17:15. Earlier that day Percival had issued orders to destroy all secret and technical equipment, ciphers, codes, secret documents and heavy guns. Surrendering troops of the Suffolk Regiment are held at gunpoint by Japanese infantry. Under the terms of the surrender, hostilities were to cease at 20:30 that evening, all military forces in Singapore were to surrender unconditionally, all Allied forces would remain in position and disarm themselves within an hour, and the British were allowed to maintain a force of 1,000 armed men to prevent looting until relieved by the Japanese. In addition, Yamashita also accepted full responsibility for the lives of the civilians in the city. In the days following the surrender, Bennett caused controversy when he decided to escape. After receiving news of the surrender, Bennett handed command of the 8th Division to the divisional artillery commander, Brigadier Cecil Callaghan, and—along with some of his staff officers—commandeered a small boat. They eventually made their way back to Australia, while between 15,000 and 20,000 Australian soldiers are reported to have been captured. Bennett blamed Percival and the Indian troops for the defeat, but Callaghan reluctantly stated that Australian units had been affected by the desertion of many men toward the end of the battle. Indeed, the Kappe Report, compiled by Colonels J.H. Thyer and C.H. Kappe, concedes that at most only two-thirds of the available Australian troops manned the final perimeter. Regardless, many British units were reported to have been similarly affected. In analysing the campaign, Clifford Kinvig, a senior lecturer at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, points the finger of blame at the commander of the 27th Brigade, Brigadier Duncan Maxwell, for his defeatist attitude and not properly defending the sector between the Causeway and the Kranji River. Elphick also claims that Australians made up the majority of stragglers. According to another source, Taylor cracked under the pressure. Thompson argues, however, that the 22nd Brigade was \\"so heavily outnumbered that defeat was inevitable\\", while Costello states that Percival's insistence on concentrating the 22nd Brigade's strength at the water's edge had been a serious mistake. Yamashita, the Japanese commander, laid the blame on the British \\"underestimating Japanese military capabilities\\", and Percival's hesitancy in reinforcing the Australians on the western side of the island. A classified wartime report by Wavell released in 1992 blamed the Australians for the loss of Singapore. Yet according to John Coates, the report \\"lacked substance\\", as whilst there had undoubtedly been ill-discipline in the final stages of the campaign—particularly among the poorly trained British, Indian and Australian reinforcements that were hurriedly dispatched as the crisis worsened—the Australian 8th Division had fought well and had gained the respect of the Japanese. Indeed, at Gemas, Bakri and Jemaluang \\"they achieved the few outstanding tactical successes\\" of the campaign in Malaya, and although the Australians made up just 13 percent of the British Empire's ground forces, they sustained 73 percent of its battle deaths. Coates argues that the real reason for the fall of Singapore was the failure of the British strategy, to which Australian policy-makers had contributed in their acquiescence, and the overall lack of military resources allocated to the fighting in Malaya. Aftermath Japanese soldiers shooting blindfolded Sikh prisoners Allied losses during the fighting for Singapore were heavy, with a total of nearly 85,000 personnel captured, in addition to losses during the earlier fighting in Malaya. About 5,000 were killed or wounded, of which Australians made up the majority. Japanese casualties during the fighting in Singapore amounted to 1,714 killed and 3,378 wounded. Throughout the entire 70-day campaign in Malaya and Singapore, total Allied casualties amounted to 8,708 killed or wounded and 130,000 captured, while Japanese losses during this period amounted to 9,824 battle casualties. During this time the Japanese had advanced a total of from Singora, Thailand, to the southern coast of Singapore at an average of a day. While impressed with Japan's quick succession of victories, Adolf Hitler reportedly had mixed views regarding Singapore's fall, seeing it as a setback for the \\"white race\\", but ultimately something that was in Germany's military interests. Hitler reportedly forbade Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop from issuing a congratulatory communique. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill called the fall of Singapore to the Japanese \\"the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history\\". Churchill's personal physician Lord Moran wrote: Fullerton Square. The Japanese occupation of Singapore started after the British surrender. Japanese newspapers triumphantly declared the victory as deciding the general situation of the war. The city was renamed Syonan-to ( ; literally: 'Southern Island gained in the age of Shōwa', or 'Light of the South'). The Japanese sought vengeance against the Chinese and to eliminate anyone who held anti-Japanese sentiments. The Japanese authorities were suspicious of the Chinese because of the Second Sino-Japanese War and murdered thousands in the Sook Ching massacre. The other ethnic groups of Singapore—such as the Malays and Indians—were not spared. Residents suffered great hardships under Japanese rule over the following three and a half years. British and Australian POWs in Singapore's Changi Prison Numerous British and Australian soldiers taken prisoner remained in Singapore's Changi Prison and many died in captivity. Thousands of others were transported by sea to other parts of Asia, including Japan, to be used as forced labour on projects such as the Siam–Burma Death Railway and Sandakan airfield in North Borneo. Many of those aboard the ships perished. An Indian revolutionary, Rash Behari Bose, formed the pro-independence Indian National Army (INA) with the help of the Japanese, who were highly successful in recruiting Indian prisoners of war. In February 1942, from a total of about 40,000 Indian personnel in Singapore, about 30,000 joined the INA, of which about 7,000 fought Allied forces in the Burma Campaign as well as in the northeast Indian regions of Kohima and Imphal. Others became POW camp guards at Changi. An unknown number were taken to Japanese-occupied areas in the South Pacific as forced labour. Many of them suffered severe hardships and brutality similar to that experienced by other prisoners of Japan during the war. About 6,000 survived until they were liberated by Australian and US forces in 1943–1945 as the war in the Pacific turned in favour of the Allies. British forces had planned to reconquer Singapore in Operation Mailfist in 1945 but, the war ended before it could be carried out. It was re-occupied in Operation Tiderace by British, Indian and Australian forces following the surrender of Japan in September. Yamashita was tried by a US military commission for war crimes but not for crimes committed by his troops in Malaya or Singapore. He was convicted and hanged in the Philippines on 23 February 1946.

Career Club Glen began his professional career in 1999 with Trinidadian club FUTGOF. After two years with FUTGOF, Glen moved to Portugal, where he played for Sanjoanense. After playing slightly over a season there, he returned to Trinidad and Tobago, where he joined San Juan Jabloteh. Glen dominated the league with Jabloteh, leading the club to two consecutive league championships in 2002 and 2003, while registering 12 and 26 goals in the respective seasons. After scoring a hat trick in a CONCACAF Champions Cup game against the Chicago Fire on 17 March 2004, Glen was bought by the MetroStars of Major League Soccer. In his first season Glen made a significant impact, registering six goals and two assists as he competed for playing time on a very crowded MetroStars front line. Glen was traded to FC Dallas after the year for a first round pick in the 2005 MLS SuperDraft, but as the club had also acquired Carlos Ruiz he could not find any playing time among Dallas's other options at striker. Glen was traded to the Columbus Crew early in the 2005 season for a future draft pick without ever suiting up for Dallas. After scoring four goals for the Crew, he was on the move again after the season, being dealt to the Colorado Rapids for Ritchie Kotschau. Glen played only one game for the Rapids—the opener of the 2006 season—before being traded to the Los Angeles Galaxy. In his Galaxy debut he scored two late goals in the \\"SuperClasico\\" against Chivas USA from Landon Donovan assists, which turned around the 1–0 score and gave the \\"sash\\" a 2–1 win. His late-game heroics made Glen an instant fan favorite in Los Angeles. Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup Glen returned to action with the Galaxy in U.S. Open Cup play against the Colorado Rapids, but aggravated an injury he suffered during the World Cup, and missed the rest of the season. He was waived by the Galaxy during the 2007 pre-season. After briefly returning to Trinidad to play for San Juan Jabloteh in 2007, Glen trialled Leeds United from the English Coca- Cola Football League One in January 2008, but was not offered a contract. Glen went on trial with Major League Soccer side San Jose Earthquakes in May 2009 and successfully signed a one-year deal with the club shortly thereafter.http://web.mlsnet.com/news/team_news.jsp?ymd=20090526&content;_id=4967168&vkey;=pr_sje&fext;=.jsp&team;=t110/ He scored his first goal for San Jose on 30 May 2009 against Real Salt Lake and ended the 2009 season with four goals as San Jose struggled in the standings. Much of Glen's time with the Earthquakes was plagued by injuries, and following a statistically disappointing 2010 season his contract was not renewed by the San Jose club. He joined Caledonia AIA in April 2011. Glen agreed to a six-month deal with Sông Lam Nghệ An of the V-League in December 2011. Upon return to Trinidad and Tobago, he signed with North East Stars for the 2012–13 season. On 17 June 2013, Glen signed for an I-League club Shillong Lajong for 2 years.

Career Early child career Brittany began her career as a child actress at age five in a 1957 episode of the CBS television network anthology series Playhouse 90 (or at that same age in an episode of Sea Hunt). In January 1960, she displayed her talent as a ballet dancer on The Dinah Shore Chevy Show. Three months later, she followed that up with her first of three Twilight Zone episodes, uncredited as a little girl in \\"Nightmare as a Child\\"; she also portrayed Sissy Johnson in the fourth-season episode \\"Valley of the Shadow\\" and Susan in the fifth-season episode \\"Caesar and Me\\". She appeared in an episode of My Three Sons as Jeannie, the daughter of a busy divorced woman. In 1960, she also appeared in the third season of Sea Hunt, as the girl trapped in a mine cave-in in the episode \\"Cindy\\". She was featured in the musical film Gypsy (1962), as Baby June. She appeared uncredited in the birthday party and school house scenes in Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds (1963). In 1963, she played the role of Winter Night in the episode \\"Incident of the Hostages\\" on CBS's Rawhide. In 1964, she starred as a blind girl named Minerva Gordon in a two-part episode of The Outer Limits titled \\"The Inheritors\\" with Robert Duvall, and Kim Hector, appeared in the Western film Stage to Thunder Rock. She appeared in the final episode of the Western series Branded in 1966, playing an orphaned girl named \\"Kellie\\" in an episode of the same name. She was part of the ensemble cast in the film Yours, Mine and Ours (1968), which starred Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda. Brittany was also in the season 8, episode 1 of The Andy Griffith Show titled \\"Opie's First Love\\" as Mary Alice. She appeared on many programs in the 1950s and 1960s. She did two episodes of Lassie, \\"Lassie and the Swamp Girl\\" and \\"Little Dog Lost\\" as \\"Mattie\\" in the mid-1960s. She followed that up with appearances on Gunsmoke and other shows. At the age of 15, after appearing in Yours, Mine and Ours (1968), her childhood career came to an end and she concentrated on getting her education at Cleveland High School in Reseda, California. Adult career At age 18, Cupito changed her name to Morgan Brittany and then appeared with Gene Kelly in his Las Vegas show, Gene Kelly's Wonderful World of Girls, as a dancer. She then moved to New York City, where she modeled for the Ford Modeling Agency, and appeared in several TV commercials and print ads (including a three-year stint as \\"The Ultra Brite Toothpaste Girl\\"), and was spokesmodel for brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline, Ford, Levi's and Camay. In December 1972, she played Cynthia, a childhood friend of Bridget (Meredith Baxter), in episode 12, \\"The Homecoming\\" on Bridget Loves Bernie. In 1974, she was hired by the Japanese cosmetics company Kanebo to be the \\"face\\" of their product \\"Ireine\\", and so moved to Tokyo from 1974 to 1976 and traveled around the world as the image of \\"Kanebo Cosmetics\\". Brittany portrayed actress Vivien Leigh in Gable and Lombard (1976) a biography of Clark Gable and Carole Lombard; it was the first of three occasions on which she played Leigh. She had also done a cameo appearance in the John Schlesinger film The Day of the Locust (1975) as Leigh in the huge mob sequence at the climax of the film. That was followed by TV movies and series, such as The Amazing Howard Hughes (1977), Delta County, U.S.A. (1977), The Initiation of Sarah (1978), Death Car on the Freeway (1979), The Dream Merchants (1980) and LBJ: The Early Years (1987). She appeared in the TV movie The Fantastic Seven (aka Stunt Seven) in 1979 with Christopher Lloyd, Patrick Macnee, and Elke Sommer. In 1980, while filming an episode of The Dukes of Hazzard, Brittany met her future husband, stuntman Jack Gill. She appeared again as Leigh in the climax of the made-for-TV movie about the search for an actress to star in Gone With the Wind's film adaptation, The Scarlett O'Hara War (1980), which marked the second of her three portrayals of the British actress. This caught the attention of the producers of Dallas, who were searching for an actress to play Katherine Wentworth, the scheming half-sister of Pamela Ewing and Cliff Barnes. She debuted on Dallas in the 1981–82 season and her role as Katherine continued, on and off, until 1987. In 1985, she returned for a cameo in that season's finale where her character killed Bobby Ewing by running him over with a car, killing herself in the process. She made a brief, final appearance on the series in 1987, after it had been revealed that Bobby's and Katherine's deaths had been a dream. In 1984, Brittany co-starred in the short-lived ABC drama series, Glitter, as Kate Simpson, a reporter for an entertainment magazine. This was one of several collaborations with producer Aaron Spelling throughout her career. Her first show with him had been an appearance in Burke's Law, in 1964 when Brittany was a child. Later, as an adult, she appeared in seven episodes of The Love Boat, Hotel, Fantasy Island, Melrose Place, and the 1990s revival of Burke's Law. She appeared in The Wild Women of Chastity Gulch (1982) starring Joan Collins. Brittany and Bruce Jenner hosted the syndicated sports show Star Games. She later hosted over 100 episodes of the magazine show Photoplay, produced by Jack Haley Jr. She has guest starred on other series, including Married... with Children, Murder, She Wrote, The Perry Mason Mysteries, Dear John, Sabrina the Teenage Witch and The Nanny. In film, Brittany starred in Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat (1989). During the late 1990s, Brittany returned to her dancing and singing roots when she played the title role of Mame in the 30th-anniversary Broadway tour of the musical.

It is based in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England. The company owns pubs, restaurants and hotels. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange until it was acquired by CK Assets in October 2019. History Greene King plaque on the side of a pub in Sudbury, Suffolk The brewery was founded by Benjamin Greene in Bury St. Edmunds in 1799. In Wilson’s biographical analysis of the Greenes, he credits members of their family for being able to achieve distinction in the worlds of business and banking, literature and broadcasting in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.’ In 1836 Edward Greene took over the business and in 1887 it merged with Frederick William King's brewing business to create Greene King. Greene King has grown via mergers and acquisitions, including Rayments Brewery (1961), the Magic Pub Company (1996), Hungry Horse (1996), Morland Brewery (1999), Old English Inns (2001), Morrells (2002), a large part of the Laurel Pub Company (2004), Ridley's Brewery (2005), Belhaven Brewery (2005), Hardys and Hansons (2006), the Loch Fyne fish restaurant chain (2007), Cloverleaf (2011), Realpubs (2011), the Capital Pub Company (2011) and the Spirit Pub Company (2015). The Spirit acquisition, where Greene King bought Spirit for £773.6m, took the total number of Greene King sites to 3,116, brought 14 brands together and made Greene King the largest managed pub company in the UK. It was completed on 23 June 2015. It was announced in November 2018 that Rooney Anand would be stepping down from his role as CEO after 14 years in the position. In 2019 the Hong Kong based CK Assets announced the proposed take over of Greene King, which shareholders will have to approve. According to the Financial Times, the holding company is taking the view that the pubs owned by Greene King are an asset that is safe from potential recession. Analyst David Blennerhassett told the FT that CK Assets has a track record of buying such assets in the UK and he does not expect it to sell Greene King later as a bet on the falling pound. The takeover was approved by the High Court in October 2019. Operations The Carleton, a Greene King pub in Pontefract, West Yorkshire The Greene King brewery in Bury St Edmunds produces beers branded in the names of breweries now closed, including Morland (Old Speckled Hen), Ruddles, Hardys & Hanson and Tolly Cobbold. The Belhaven Brewery in Dunbar continues to operate in Scotland. The group operates 3,100 pubs, restaurants and hotels: * Its retail division is split between its destination pubs and restaurants (with brands including Hungry Horse, Loch Fyne, Taylor Walker and Metropolitan Pub Company) and its local pubs. Its strategy is to open further retail outlets. * Its pub partners division has leased, tenanted and franchised pubs. Its strategy is to reduce the numbers of these outlets. Visitor centre Greene King's Brewery Museum, shown in 2006 The Greene King main brewery, seen from Westgate Street The Greene King main brewery There is a visitor centre next to the brewery, and tours are run regularly throughout the week. The brewery has an exhibition of pub sign artwork by George Taylor, who designed over 250 such signs for Greene King pubs. People Greene King has been supporting apprenticeships since 2011 through its award winning Greene King Apprenticeship Programme. Since launch, the scheme has welcomed some 9,000 apprentices. In 2016, Greene King launched the Get Into Hospitality Programme in partnership with The Prince’s Trust. The aim of the programme is to address the skills and experience gaps that prevent unemployed people from getting into work. Those who successfully complete and graduate from the programme are offered a role onto the Greene King Apprenticeship Programme. In 2017, Greene King launched the Craft Academy, an 18 month brewing venture led by apprentices. Through the programme, apprentices earn while they learn about brewing, design and marketing. Through the scheme, they will gain a Level 3 NVQ Diploma in Sales. The first five beers from the Craft Academy was launched at Craft Beer Rising Festival in London and include; Over Easy (3.8% session IPA), Big Bang IPA (5.6% bold and citrusy IPA), Bitter Sweet (6% black IPA), Desert Ryeder (4.8% rye beer) and High & Dry (5% dry hop lager). Criticism Greene King's ongoing business expansion has sometimes been the subject of criticism. As a result of its active acquisition policy, it has come to be known by beer protesters as Greedy King. The growing consumer reaction to Greene King buying out smaller breweries was demonstrated towards the end of 2006 when a pub in Lewes, East Sussex started a well-publicised protest against Greene King for removing the locally produced Harveys Sussex Best Bitter from sale, while continuing to sell other guest beers. In January 2014, popular Manchester pub The Lass O'Gowrie, voted \\"Best Pub in Britain\\" at the Great British Pub Awards in 2012, closed after landlord Gareth Kavanagh was forced out in an argument over rent. Having lost 40% of their trade after the BBC moved to Salford, Kavanagh had won a rent reduction at an independent tribunal before being forced out by the brewery. Greene King has also been criticised for removing many traditional and historic pub signs as part of rebranding schemes. Beers Greene King Abbot Ale A pint of Greene King IPA * Abbot Ale - A premium bitter (5.0% abv) first brewed in the 1950s. The ingredients are pale, crystal and amber malts; with First Gold, Challenger and Fuggles hops - the Fuggles being late-hopped. In 2007 Abbot Reserve (6.5% abv) was introduced as a winter special in the cask, with year-round availability in the bottle. * Greene King IPA - An English IPA (3.6% abv) served in pubs and cans available from supermarkets and off-licences nationally. It is made using Challenger and First Gold hops and using pale and crystal malt. Greene King IPA controversially won the Gold award at the 2004 Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) Great British Beer Festival in the Bitter category and runner-up in the Champion Beer of Britain category. In 2009, Greene King began to roll out a new form of dispense which allows customers to choose either a \\"Northern\\" or a \\"Southern\\" head on their beer. In 2012, two extensions of the brand were launched: Gold and Reserve. * IPA Export - A stronger cask bitter (5.0% abv) IPA available from off-licences in bottles, also made using Challenger and English First Gold hops. * Olde Suffolk/Strong Suffolk Vintage - A strong old ale (6% abv) that is a blend of two ales, one being aged in oak for two years. It is available in bottles. * St Edmunds - A crisp golden ale (4.2% abv) available in both bottles and cask nationally. * Greene King XX Mild (3% ABV). A dark mild ale available on cask. Black and Crystal malts, Northdown hops. Hardy's and Hansons * Olde Trip - A 4.3% Premium Ale. Named in honour of the Nottingham inn Ye Olde Trip To Jerusalem, which claims to be the oldest inn in Britain. As of September 2007 this was for sale in the Brewery Museum in 500ml bottles. Belhaven * Belhaven Best * Nowhere Pale Ale * Twisted Grapefruit IPA Morland Can of Old Speckled Hen * Old Speckled Hen is a popular bitter, available both as a cask ale and pasteurised in bottles.

Contemporary practice is to assign a number from I to IV to a cancer, with I being an isolated cancer and IV being a cancer that has spread to the limit of what the assessment measures. The stage generally takes into account the size of a tumor, whether it has invaded adjacent organs, how many regional (nearby) lymph nodes it has spread to (if any), and whether it has appeared in more distant locations (metastasized). TNM staging system 3D Medical Illustration depicting the TNM Stages in breast cancer Cancer staging can be divided into a clinical stage and a pathologic stage. In the TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastasis) system, clinical stage and pathologic stage are denoted by a small \\"c\\" or \\"p\\" before the stage (e.g., cT3N1M0 or pT2N0). This staging system is used for most forms of cancer, except brain tumors and hematological malignancies. * Clinical stage is based on all of the available information obtained before a surgery to remove the tumor. This stage may include information about the tumor obtained by physical examination, blood tests, radiologic examination, biopsy, and endoscopy. * Pathologic stage adds additional information gained by examination of the tumor microscopically by a pathologist after it has been surgically removed. Because they use different criteria, clinical stage and pathologic stage often differ. Pathologic staging is usually considered to be more accurate because it allows direct examination of the tumor in its entirety, contrasted with clinical staging which is limited by the fact that the information is obtained by making indirect observations of a tumor which is still in the body. However, clinical staging and pathologic staging often complement each other. Not every tumor is treated surgically, so pathologic staging is not always available. Also, sometimes surgery is preceded by other treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy which shrink the tumor, so the pathologic stage may underestimate the true stage. Considerations Correct staging is critical because treatment (particularly the need for pre-operative therapy and/or for adjuvant treatment, the extent of surgery) is generally based on this parameter. Thus, incorrect staging would lead to improper treatment. For some common cancers the staging process is well-defined. For example, in the cases of breast cancer and prostate cancer, doctors routinely can identify that the cancer is early and that it has low risk of metastasis., citing  In such cases, medical specialty professional organizations recommend against the use of PET scans, CT scans, or bone scans because research shows that the risk of getting such procedures outweighs the possible benefits. Some of the problems associated with overtesting include patients receiving invasive procedures, overutilizing medical services, getting unnecessary radiation exposure, and experiencing misdiagnosis. Pathologic Pathologic staging, where a pathologist examines sections of tissue, can be particularly problematic for two specific reasons: visual discretion and random sampling of tissue. \\"Visual discretion\\" means being able to identify single cancerous cells intermixed with healthy cells on a slide. Oversight of one cell can mean mistaging and lead to serious, unexpected spread of cancer. \\"Random sampling\\" refers to the fact that lymph nodes are cherry-picked from patients and random samples are examined. If cancerous cells present in the lymph node happen not to be present in the slices of tissue viewed, incorrect staging and improper treatment can result. Emotional neglect is linked to advanced cancer stages. Current research New, highly sensitive methods of staging are in development. For example, the mRNA for GCC (guanylyl cyclase c), present only in the luminal aspect of intestinal epithelium, can be identified using molecular screening (RT-PCR) with a high degree of sensitivity and exactitude. Presence of GCC in any other tissue of the body represents colorectal metaplasia. Because of its high sensitivity, RT-PCR screening for GCC greatly reduces underestimation of disease stage. Researchers hope that staging with this level of precision will lead to more appropriate treatment and better prognosis. Furthermore, researchers hope that this same technique can be applied to other tissue-specific proteins. Systems Staging systems are specific for each type of cancer (e.g., breast cancer and lung cancer), but some cancers do not have a staging system. Although competing staging systems still exist for some types of cancer, the universally-accepted staging system is that of the UICC, which has the same definitions of individual categories as the AJCC. Systems of staging may differ between diseases or specific manifestations of a disease. Blood * Lymphoma: uses Ann Arbor staging * Hodgkin's Disease: follows a scale from I to IV and can be indicated further by an A or B, depending on whether a patient is non-symptomatic or has symptoms such as fevers. It is known as the \\"Cotswold System\\" or \\"Modified Ann Arbor Staging System\\". Solid For solid tumors, TNM is by far the most commonly used system, but it has been adapted for some conditions. * Breast cancer: In breast cancer classification, staging is usually based on TNM, but staging in I–IV may be used as well. * Cervical and ovarian cancers: the \\"FIGO\\" system has been adopted into the TNM system. For premalignant dysplastic changes, the CIN (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) grading system is used. * Colon cancer: originally consisted of four stages: A, B, C, and D (the Dukes staging system). More recently, colon cancer staging is indicated either by the original A-D stages or by TNM. * Kidney cancer: uses TNM. * Cancer of the larynx: Uses TNM. * Liver cancer: Uses TNM. * Lung cancer: uses TNM. * Melanoma: TNM used. Also of importance are the \\"Clark level\\" and \\"Breslow depth\\" which refer to the microscopic depth of tumor invasion (\\"Microstaging\\"). * Prostate cancer: TNM almost universally used. * Testicular cancer: uses TNM along with a measure of blood serum markers (TNMS). * Non-melanoma skin cancer: uses TNM. * Bladder cancer: uses TNM. Overall stage grouping alt=Cancer Stages Overall Stage Grouping is also referred to as Roman Numeral Staging. This system uses numerals I, II, III, and IV (plus the 0) to describe the progression of cancer. * Stage 0: carcinoma in situ, abnormal cells growing in their normal place (\\"in situ\\" from Latin for \\"in its place\\"). * Stage I: cancers are localized to one part of the body. Stage I cancer can be surgically removed if small enough. * Stage II: cancers are locally advanced. Stage II cancer can be treated by chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. *Stage III: cancers are also locally advanced. Whether a cancer is designated as Stage II or Stage III can depend on the specific type of cancer; for example, in Hodgkin's Disease, Stage II indicates affected lymph nodes on only one side of the diaphragm, whereas Stage III indicates affected lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm. The specific criteria for Stages II and III therefore differ according to diagnosis. Stage III can be treated by chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. * Stage IV: cancers have often metastasized, or spread to other organs or throughout the body. Stage IV cancer can be treated by chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. Despite treatment, a patient's mortality rate can be significantly higher with Stage IV cancer, e.g., the cancer can progress to become terminal. Within the TNM system, a cancer may also be designated as recurrent, meaning that it has appeared again after being in remission or after all visible tumor has been eliminated. Recurrence can either be local, meaning that it appears in the same location as the original, or distant, meaning that it appears in a different part of the body. Stage migration Stage migration is a change in the distribution of stages in a particular cancer population, induced by either a change in the staging system itself or else a change in technology which allows more sensitive detection of tumor spread and therefore more sensitivity in detecting spread of disease (e.g., the use of MRI scans). Stage migration can lead to curious statistical phenomena (for example, the Will Rogers phenomenon). Urinary cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer in which staging systems are vital in this area.

Takashimaya was listed at #1197 on the Forbes Global 2000 list for 2006.The World's Biggest Public Companies - Forbes.com Takashimaya is a member of the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFJ) keiretsu. History The first Takashimaya store was opened in Kyoto in 1831 as a sole proprietorship owned by Shinshichi Iida, a merchant from present-day Fukui Prefecture. The original store in Kyoto was only 3.6 square meters in area and specialized in selling gofuku (formal kimono). A second Kyoto store opened in 1893, followed by a Tokyo store in 1897 and an Osaka store in 1898. Takashimaya was incorporated as a gomei kaisha (unlimited liability company) in 1909 and converted to a kabushiki kaisha (stock company) in 1919. Takashimaya began an export business in 1876, following the Meiji Restoration, and established an in-house trading unit in 1887. By 1903 Takashimaya had offices in Paris and London and an export office in Yokohama. The trading unit was spun off as a new stock company, , in 1913. Takashimaya- Iida later merged with the trading company Marubeni. The chain saw a major expansion in the early 1930s. In 1931 it opened a \\"10, 20 and 50 sen store\\" in Osaka, a predecessor of today's 100 yen store. Its flagship store in Namba, Osaka opened in 1932, and a second flagship store in Nihonbashi, Tokyo opened in 1933. The Tokyo and Osaka stores were damaged by the firebombings of Tokyo and Osaka in 1945 but were not destroyed, and served as centers for logistics during the occupation of Japan. Due to postwar regulations on the size of new stores, many Takashimaya locations opened from the 1950s onward, including its Yokohama and Yonago stores, were set up as separate companies. In 1958, Takashimaya opened a store in New York City which eventually occupied 37,000 square feet of floor space at 693 Fifth Avenue. The New York store closed in 2010 as Takashimaya chose to refocus on East and Southeast Asian markets amid struggling sales. In 1969, Takashimaya opened Japan's first American-style suburban shopping center near Futako-Tamagawa Station, to the southwest of Tokyo. The Japanese department store industry went through a wave of consolidation during a revenue slump in the 2000s, with Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings (parent of Mitsukoshi and Isetan) becoming the largest player in the industry, followed by J. Front Retailing (parent of Daimaru Matsuzakaya Department Stores). In 2008, Takashimaya announced plans to merge with H2O Retailing, the parent of the Osaka-based Hanshin Department Store and Hankyu Department Store chains, which would have formed the largest department store operator in Japan. Takashimaya and H2O entered into a cross-shareholding relationship prior to the merger, with each acquiring 10% of the other's stock, but announced the cancellation of their merger in 2010. In 2019, the company announced it would closing its mainland China store in Shanghai on August 25, but retracted its decision after it gained support from local governments.

He is best known for his claim to have explored the Strait of Anián, now known as the Strait of Juan de Fuca, between Vancouver Island (now part of British Columbia, Canada) and the Olympic Peninsula (northwestern Washington state, United States). Family and early life Phokás's grandfather, Emmanouíl Phokás (), fled Constantinople at its fall in 1453, accompanied by his brother Andrónikos (). The two settled first in the Peloponnese, where Andrónikos remained, but in 1470 Emmanouel moved to the island of Cefalonia. Iákovos (), Ioánnis's father, established himself in the village of Valerianos () on the island and came to be known as \\"the Valeriáno Fokás\\" (Gr: Φωκᾶς ὁ Βαλεριάνος) to distinguish him from his brothers. It was in this village of Valeriáno that Phokás was born in 1536. Little to nothing is known about his life before he entered the service of Spain, some time around 1555.Fokás in 1596 claimed to have been some forty years in the king of Spain's service. Name The name of the man known to history as Juan de Fuca is the source of some confusion. While Juan de Fuca is clearly a Spanish rendering of Ioánnis Phokás (), some sources cite Apóstolos Valeriános () as his \\"real\\" name. It is possible that Phokás was baptized Apóstolos and later adopted the name Ioánnis/Juan (i.e., John) because Apóstol is not much used as a name in Spanish. Given that Fokás/Fuca was the family name borne by the seafarer's father and grandfather, Valeriános is likely to be a nickname used on the island which would have been quite meaningless in the Spanish Empire. Early career De Fuca's early voyages were to the Far East, and he claimed to have arrived in New Spain in 1587 when, off Cabo San Lucas in Baja California, the English privateer Thomas Cavendish seized his galleon Santa Ana and deposited him ashore. He was a well-traveled seaman, perfecting his skill as a pilot in the Spanish fleet. The King of Spain, he also claimed, recognized him for his excellence and made him pilot of the Spanish navy in the West Indies (a title he held for forty years), but there is no record in Spanish Archives of his name or position or of his visit to the royal court. Before he made his famous trip up the northwest coast of the North American continent, he sailed to China, the Philippines and Mexico. The Strait of Juan de Fuca between the United States of America and Canada was named for him by British Captain Charles Barkley because it was at the same latitude that Juan de Fuca described as the location of the Strait of Anián.Center for the Study of the Pacific Northwest Voyages to the north Fuca Pillar at Cape Flattery, Washington beside the Strait of Juan de Fuca. According to de Fuca's account, he undertook two voyages of exploration on the orders of the Viceroy of New Spain, Luis de Velasco, marqués de Salinas, both intended to find the fabled Strait of Anián, believed to be a Northwest Passage, a sea route linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The first voyage saw 200 soldiers and three small ships under the overall command of a Spanish captain (with de Fuca as pilot and master) assigned the task of finding the Strait of Anián and fortifying it against the English. This expedition failed when, allegedly due to the captain's malfeasance, the soldiers mutinied and returned home to California. (Note that in this period, Spanish doctrine divided control of ships and fleets between the military commander, who was an army officer, and the sailing and navigation commander, who was a mariner.) In 1592, on his second voyage, de Fuca enjoyed success. Having sailed north with a caravel and a pinnace and a few armed marines, he returned to Acapulco and claimed to have found the strait, with a large island at its mouth, at around 47° north latitude. The Strait of Juan de Fuca is in fact at around 48° N, although Fuca's account of sailing into it departs from reality, describing a region far different from what actually existed there. During the voyage, de Fuca also noted a \\"high pinnacle or spired rock\\", which may have been Fuca Pillar, a tall, almost rectangular, rock on the western shore of Cape Flattery on the northwestern tip of Washington beside the Strait of Juan de Fuca - although de Fuca noted it being on the other side of the strait. Despite Velasco's repeated promises, however, de Fuca never received the great rewards he claimed as his due. After two years, and on the viceroy's urging, de Fuca travelled to Spain to make his case to the court in person. Disappointed again and disgusted with the Spanish, the aging Greek determined to retire to his home in Kefallonia, but was in 1596 convinced by an Englishman, Michael Lok (also spelled as Locke in English and French documents from the period), to offer his services to Spain's archenemy, Queen Elizabeth. Nothing came of Lok and de Fuca's proposals, but it is through Lok's account that the story of Juan de Fuca entered English letters. Controversy 1768 map showing Juan de Fuca's strait, between New Albion and an island roughly corresponding to the later British Columbia and Alaska, as the entrance of the Northwest Passage Because the only written evidence for Fokás's voyages lay in Lok's account -- researchers being unable to find records of the expedition in Spanish colonial archives -- there was long much controversy over his discovery and, indeed, whether he had ever even existed as a real person; several scholars have dismissed Juan de Fuca as entirely fictitious, and the 18th-century British explorer Captain Cook strongly doubted that the strait Fokás claimed to have discovered even existed (although Cook actually sailed past the Strait of Juan de Fuca without entering it and did stop at Nootka Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island). With later English exploration and settlement of the area, however, Fokás's claims seemed much more credible. Finally, in 1859, an American researcher, with the help of the U.S. Consul in the Ionian Islands, was able to demonstrate not only that Fokás had lived but also that his family and history were well known on the islands. While we may never know the exact truths that lay behind the account published by Lok, it must be considered unlikely that the man himself was fictional. Legacy When the English captain Charles William Barkley, sailing the Imperial Eagle in 1787, (re)discovered the strait Fokás had described, he renamed it the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The Juan de Fuca Ridge and the Juan de Fuca Plate, a tectonic plate underlying much of the coastline he explored, is named for the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Juan de Fuca Provincial Park on Vancouver Island's West Coast is named for the strait, as is the hiking trail of the same name.

Ferguson. Arrested, tried and convicted in New Orleans of a violation of one of Louisiana's racial segregation laws, he appealed through Louisiana state courts to the U.S. Supreme Court and lost. The resulting \\"separate but equal\\" decision against him had wide consequences for civil rights in the United States. The decision legalized state-mandated segregation anywhere in the United States so long as the facilities provided for both blacks and whites were putatively \\"equal\\". Homer Plessy was a free person of color born to a family that came to America free from Haiti and France. His parents were French-speaking Creoles, Haitian refugees who fled the revolution. At that time, federal troops under General Benjamin Franklin Butler were occupying Louisiana as a result of the American Civil War, having liberated African Americans in New Orleans who had been in bondage. As a result, Blacks could marry whomever they chose, sit in any streetcar seat and, briefly, attend integrated schools. As an adult, Plessy experienced the reversal of the gains achieved under the federal occupation, following the withdrawal of federal troops in 1877 on the orders of U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes. Descendants of Plessy and Ferguson in newspaper article and photograph. Due to Plessy’s phenotype being white, Plessy could have ridden in a railroad car restricted to people classified as White. However, under the racial policies of the time, he was an \\"octoroon\\" having 1/8th African-American heritage, and therefore was considered Black. Hoping to strike down segregation laws, the Citizens’ Committee of New Orleans (Comité des Citoyens) recruited Plessy to deliberately violate Louisiana's 1890 separate-car law. To pose a clear test, the Citizens’ Committee gave notice of Plessy’s intent to the railroad, which opposed the law because it required adding more cars to its trains. On June 7, 1892, Plessy bought a first-class ticket on a train from New Orleans and sat in the car for white riders only. The Committee had hired a private detective with arrest powers to take Plessy off the train at Press and Royal streets, to ensure that he was charged with violating the state’s separate-car law and not some other misdemeanor. Everything that the committee had organized occurred as planned, except for the decision of the Supreme Court in 1896. > By then the composition of the U.S. Supreme Court had gained a more > segregationist tilt, and the committee knew it would likely lose. But it > chose to press the cause anyway, [author Keith] Medley said. “It was a > matter of honor for them, that they fight this to the very end.”  Biography  Homer Plessy was born on March 17, 1862, in New Orleans to Joseph Adolphe Plessy and Rosa Debergue, members of New Orleans' French- speaking Creole society. p. 20 Another in this Creole society was Plessy's compatriot Walter L. Cohen, who obtained an appointment as customs inspector from U.S. President William McKinley. Homer Plessy's paternal grandfather was Germain Plessy, a white Frenchman born in Bordeaux c. 1777. p. 21 Germain Plessy arrived in New Orleans with thousands of other French expatriates who fled Saint-Domingue in the wake of the slave rebellion led by Toussaint L'Ouverture that wrested Haiti from Napoleon in the 1790s. Germain Plessy married Catherine Mathieu, a free woman of color, and they had eight children, including Homer Plessy's father, Joseph Adolphe Plessy. Homer Plessy's middle name would later appear as Adolphe after his father, a carpenter, on his birth certificate. Plessy belonged to Louisiana's French-speaking Creole class, which American society did not understand or accept. Plessy grew up speaking French. Adolphe Plessy died when Homer was seven years old. In 1871, his mother Rosa Debergue Plessy, a seamstress, married Victor M. Dupart, a clerk for the U.S. Post Office who supplemented his income by working as a shoemaker. Plessy too became a shoemaker. During the 1880s, he worked at Patricio Brito's shoe-making business on Dumaine Street near North Rampart. New Orleans city directories from 1886 to 1924 list his occupations as shoemaker, laborer, clerk, and insurance agent.\\"Homer Adolph Plessy\\", A Dictionary of Louisiana Biography, Vol. 2 (1988), p. 655 By 1887, Plessy had become vice-president of the Justice, Protective, Educational, and Social Club, a group dedicated to reforming public education in New Orleans. In 1888, Plessy, then twenty-five years old, was married to nineteen-year-old Louise Bordenave by Father Joseph Subileau at St. Augustine Church which is located at 1210 Gov. Nicholls Street in New Orleans. Plessy's employer Brito served as a witness. In 1889, the Plessys moved to Faubourg Tremé at 1108 North Claiborne Avenue.

Ferguson  The Comité des Citoyens (\\"Citizens' Committee\\") was a civil rights group made up of African Americans, whites, and Creoles. The committee vigorously opposed the recently Separate Car Act. In 1892, the Citizens' Committee asked Plessy to agree to violate Louisiana's Separate Car law that required the segregation of passenger trains by race. On June 7, 1892, Plessy, then thirty years old and resembling a white male in skin color and other physical characteristics, bought a first-class ticket on the East Louisiana Railroad running between New Orleans and Covington, the seat of now suburban St. Tammany Parish. He sat in the \\"whites-only\\" passenger car. When the conductor came to collect his ticket, Plessy told him that he was 7/8 white and that he refused to sit in the \\"blacks-only\\" car. Plessy was immediately arrested by Detective Chris C. Cain, put into the Orleans Parish jail and released the next day on a $500 bond. Plessy's case was heard before Judge John Howard Ferguson one month after his arrest. Tourgée argued that Plessy's civil rights, as granted by the Thirteenth and Fourteenth amendments of the U.S. Constitution, had been violated. Ferguson denied this argument and ruled that Louisiana, under state law, had the power to set rules that regulated railroad business within its borders. The Louisiana State Supreme Court affirmed Ferguson's ruling and refused to grant a rehearing. However it did allow a petition for writ of error. This petition was accepted by the United States Supreme Court and four years later, in April 1896, arguments for Plessy v. Ferguson began. Tourgée argued that the state of Louisiana had violated the Thirteenth Amendment that granted freedom to the slaves, and the Fourteenth Amendment that stated, \\"no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States;nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, and property without due process of law.\\" On May 18, 1896, Justice Henry Billings Brown delivered the majority opinion in favor of the State of Louisiana. In part, the opinion read, \\"The object of the Fourteenth Amendment was undoubtedly to enforce the absolute equality of the two races before the law, but in the nature of things it could not have been intended to abolish distinctions based on color, or to enforce social, as distinguished from political equality, or a commingling of the two races upon terms unsatisfactory to the either ...\\" The lone dissenting vote was cast by Justice John Marshall Harlan, a Kentucky Republican who repeatedly asserted that the U.S. constitution was \\"color blind.\\" The \\"Separate but Equal\\" doctrine, enshrined by the Plessy ruling, remained valid until 1954 when it was overturned by the Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education, and later completely outlawed by the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964. Though the Plessy case did not involve education, it formed the legal basis of separate school systems for the following fifty- eight years.  Plessy's life after the Supreme Court case  After the Supreme Court ruling, Plessy went back into relative anonymity. He fathered children, continued to participate in the religious and social life of his community, and later sold and collected insurance premiums for the People's Life Insurance Company. He died in 1925 at the age of 62. His obituary read: \\"Homer Plessy — on Sunday, March 1, 1925, at 5:10 a.m. beloved husband of Louise Bordenave.\\" He was buried in the Debergue-Blanco family tomb in St. Louis Cemetery #1.

On February 10, 2009, Keith Plessy and Phoebe Ferguson, descendants of the players on both sides of the Supreme Court case, appeared together on television station WLTV in New Orleans. They announced the formation of the Plessy & Ferguson Foundation for Education, Preservation and Outreach. The foundation will work to create new ways to teach the history of civil rights through film, art, and public programs designed to create understanding of this historic case and its effect on the American conscience.

Lynch, matron of honor for USS Sea Dog at double launching in submarine basin at Navy Yard, Portsmouth, N.H. 28 March 1944. USS Sea Dog (SS-401/AGSS-401) was a Balao-class submarine in the United States Navy. She was the first ship to be named for the dogfish, a small shark of the North Atlantic, considered destructive by fishermen. Sea Dog was laid down on 1 November 1943 at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 28 March 1944 sponsored by Mrs. Claire Dowden Lowrance, wife of the prospective commanding officer, and commissioned on 3 June 1944 with Commander Vernon L. Lowrance in command. Following a month's training off the New England coast, Sea Dog sailed for Pearl Harbor to join Submarine Squadron (SubRon) 28 and prepare for her first war patrol. Arriving in Hawaii on 22 August, she sailed west on 13 September, topped off at Midway Island on 17 September; and entered her patrol area in the Nansei Shoto on 28 September.  First War Patrol  With daylight traffic routed well inshore, she hunted unsuccessfully in the Kikaijima, Amami O Shima, and Okinoerabujima areas for the first few days, then searched the likely traffic lanes to Naha and Unten Ko. By 3 October, she had rounded Okinawa to patrol in the approaches to Nakagusuku Wan, and, by 6 October, she was again northwest of Okinawa in the Iheya Jima area. Sea Dog remained west of Okinawa for another five days but found no targets worthy of a torpedo. On 10 October, however, she took an armed trawler under fire and left it burning. On 11 October, she headed back into the Amami Gunto. A week later, she moved north into the Tokara Gunto and, on 22 October, while between the islands of Suwanosejima and Nakanoshima (Kagoshima), she sighted a convoy making eight to nine knots and zigging every five minutes. Sea Dog moved ahead of the port column and, at 0726, fired as two cargo ships overlapped in a zig. A minute later, she lost depth control and dropped to . Shortly after 0728, three loud explosions were heard. At 0732, the convoy's escorts began dropping depth charges. At 0745, breaking up noises were heard; and, at 0800, there was a dull, heavy explosion. Converted gun boat Tomitsu Maru and collier Muroto had been sunk. Depth charging continued for another two hours. In total, Japanese escorts and aircraft fired 109 depth charges at the Sea Dog, but LtCdr. Lowrance manages to evade the attack.http://www.combinedfleet.com/Muroto_t.htm Sea Dog continued to patrol in the Tokara Gunto for another two days, then headed back to the Amami Gunto. On 28 October, she contacted and attacked, unsuccessfully, a formation of two battleships and a destroyer; and, on 29 October, she set an eastward course for Midway. On 30 October, she patrolled in the likely traffic lanes to the Bonin Islands, and, on 5 November, she reached Midway.  Second War Patrol  Refitted by submarine tender , Sea Dog got underway again on 29 November. On 1 December, she rendezvoused with submarines and to form a coordinated attack group with the commanding officer of Sea Dog in charge of the wolfpack. On 8 December, the group stopped off at Saipan; and the next day headed west. On 14 December, the ships arrived on station in Balintang Channel to begin their patrol in the South China Sea. The next 34 days were spent on station patrolling a trapezium-shaped area with Luzon, Hainan, Hong Kong and Formosa as the corners. On 3 January 1945, Sea Dog interrupted her hunting to repair her port reduction gear, without which she was limited to single shaft operations. On the night of 5 January, she and Sea Robin made contact with a small convoy and, despite heavy seas, commenced a surface approach. Shortly after 0100 on 6 January, Sea Robin attacked the lead ships and scored two hits. Sea Dog stalked the right rear ship, a converted escort. The target, however, foiled an attempt at a bow shot by reversing course. Further maneuvers for a stern tube attack were frustrated when the converted escort presented a zero angle on the bow and opened fire with her forward gun, estimated to be a three-inch. Sea Dog fired four \\"down-the-throat\\" and retired. No hits were scored. On 18 January, the submarines closed Luzon Strait in hopes of sighting targets before leaving the area. Unsuccessful, they continued east. On 25 January, Sea Dog reached Guam, whence she continued on to Pearl Harbor. Arriving on 5 February, Sea Dog's main engines were overhauled; the 40 millimeter gun was installed in a high position forward; and ST radar equipment was added. On 11 March, she got underway to return to Japanese waters.  Third War Patrol  Assigned to patrol immediately south of the home islands, she spent 29 days in the area, with most of that time taken up in providing lifeguard services for aircraft strikes. From 22 to 24 March, she was on lifeguard duty to the southeast of the Nanpō Islands. On 25 March, she moved into that chain and, on 28 March she closed the Kyūshū coast off Cape Toi. The next day, lifeguard duty took her on a high speed run south to the Osumi Islands, where sea planes picked up the downed pilots as she arrived. A short while later, however, a third plane circled, then ditched eight miles off. Sea Dog picked up the pilot, submerged, and headed back to the Kyūshū coast. At 1903, as she was making preparations to surface, she sighted an enemy I-boat which had just surfaced. Sea Dog took the offensive and fired on the submarine but not fast enough. The torpedoes missed, and the I-boat escaped. Sea Dog remained off the Kyūshū coast for another day; then moved north to lifeguard duty south of Sagami Wan. Although assigned to cover both sides of the Izu Shoto, resulting in much of her time being spent on high speed runs south around Mikura-jima with no rescues being made at the end of the runs, potential target opportunities increased. On 2 April, she sighted and fired on a small minelayer. All torpedoes missed. On 16 April, she sank a medium-sized cargo ship, Toko Maru, between Hachijo Jima and Mikura-jima. A typhoon then interrupted both hunting and rescue operations; and, on 23 April, she headed for Guam.  Fourth War Patrol  Refit took Sea Dog into May, when preparations were made for her last foray into Japanese home waters. Additional duties during the patrol included those of flagship for the nine- submarine Japan Sea Patrol Pack (TC 17.21). On 27 May, she departed Guam with the other two submarines of her immediate pack, and . Later that day, the ships separated to proceed independently, planning to rendezvous on 4 June. On 28 May, one of Sea Dog's crew became seriously ill and was diagnosed as a possible pneumonia case. On 29 May, the submarine rendezvoused with and, after transferring the patient to that destroyer, continued on to the Sea of Japan. On arrival, Sea Dog reconnoitered the approaches to western Honshū ports to locate minefields; then took up station off the east coast of Sado Island. At 2000 on 9 June, she sank her first target of the patrol, the small cargo ship, Sagawa Maru. Twenty-three minutes later, she made her second contact; and, at 2044, she fired three torpedoes at another merchant ship, the Shoyo Maru. One torpedo hit, starting a fire aft. Sea Dog pulled away, watched, then moved in for the coup de grace. Two more torpedoes were fired, one ran erratic; the second hit amidships. The target exploded; her bow broke off; and her stern assumed a 60-degree down angle. Soon afterward, Sea Dog cleared the Niigata area and headed north to patrol off Sakata and Akita. On 10 June, she closed Oga Hanto, and that night she patrolled northwest of Kisakata and northeast of Tobishima, Minato Island. On 11 June, she returned to the vicinity of Oga Hanto. Shortly after 1300, she made contact with another coastal freighter, surfaced, and commenced running west and north to intercept. At 1519, she dived. At 1555, she fired one torpedo. Forty-three seconds later, the torpedo hit; and the target, cargo ship Kofuku Maru, broke in two, up-ending both the bow and the stern. Sea Dog resumed her patrol to the southward. That night, she took up station to the north of Nyudozaki and, at 0635 on 12 June, sighted a small convoy as it rounded that headland and continued northward, through relatively shallow waters, toward Henashi Zaki. Sea Dog fired on the freighter farthest from the coast. Shinson Maru broke in two and sank in about two minutes. Her companions moved even closer to the coast. Sea Dog headed for deeper water and patrolled to the southwest. On 13 June, Sea Dog was still off Oga Hanto. That evening, the starboard mine clearing cable, installed during the previous refit at Guam, parted and fouled the starboard screw. Sea Dog cleared the Japanese coast and stopped, lying-to while attempts were made to get divers down. Leaks in the face mask of the shallow water diving outfit, however, proved impossible to repair; and, soon after 0130 on 14 June, the submarine got underway. The noise and vibration from the starboard shaft was found to occur only for short periods at low speeds. At high speeds, its performance was satisfactory, and Sea Dog resumed her patrol, setting a southwest course for a surface patrol across the approaches to Akita, Sakata, and Niigata. With daylight on 14 June, she dived, stopped her starboard propeller, and commenced hunting underwater. Less than an hour later, she sighted smoke and attempted to intercept. Her quarry, two cargo ships beat her into Sakata. That night, she moved northward again, and, at 0510 on 15 June, she sighted a passenger/cargo ship standing south past the northern end of Oga Hanto. At 0522, she fired a torpedo which hit just forward of amidships. Koan Maru sank in four minutes. Sea Dog cleared the area as small craft from the beach moved out to pick up survivors. On 17 June, Sea Dog rotated areas with Spadefish and Crevalle and headed north to hunt along the Hokkaidō coast between Bakkai and Kamui Misaki. Two days later, she sighted three merchantmen moving northward along the coast and attacked, firing two torpedoes at the lead ship and three at the second. The third ship changed course. Sea Dog turned back to the previous targets. The first ship, cargo ship Kokai Maru, was going under, stern first. But, before she could fire again on the second ship, an enemy plane was sighted. Sea Dog dived. At , she grounded; backed off, cleared and then headed north. The plane did not attack. SS-401 remained in the area for several more days, then headed for Pearl Harbor. On 30 June, she arrived at Midway; and, on 5 July, she entered Pearl Harbor.  Fifth War Patrol  On 13 August, she departed that port for her fifth war patrol. On 14 August, she received orders to cease hostilities; and, on 15 August, she reversed course for Pearl Harbor. Sea Dog conducted training operations in the Hawaiian Islands during the remainder of August. On 6 September, she headed west with , , and ; and, on 26 September, she arrived at Subic Bay in the Philippine Islands, to join the newly formed postwar squadron, SubRon 5.  Post-War Duties  For the next three and one-half months, Sea Dog operated out of Subic Bay and, on 12 January 1946, set a course for the West Coast, arriving at San Francisco, California, on 2 February. Overhaul at Mare Island followed; and, in June, she returned to Pearl Harbor to prepare for her second postwar deployment to the Far East. During July, while en route to the Philippines, she conducted a mock war patrol. In August and early September, she provided antisubmarine training services to Seventh Fleet units in the Tsingtao area; and, at the end of the latter month, she returned to Pearl Harbor. Through 1947, Sea Dog remained in the eastern Pacific, conducting training operations in the Hawaiian Islands and off the coasts of Washington, British Columbia, and California. In mid-January 1948, she again deployed to the western Pacific Ocean, where, after a visit to Australia, she again joined TG 71.2, the 7th Fleet's antisubmarine warfare training group at Tsingtao. On 2 March, she suffered minor damage in a collision with ; and, after repairs, she headed back to Hawaii. Two months later, Sea Dog cleared Pearl Harbor and headed north to the Bering Sea to collect hydrographic and oceanographic information. On her return to Pearl Harbor, 15 June, she resumed a schedule of local training exercises alternated with periods of antisubmarine warfare training services to Fleet Air Wing 4 off the Washington coast. In January 1950, Sea Dog was again deployed to the western Pacific. On her return, she received orders to join the Atlantic Fleet. Departing Pearl Harbor in mid- June, she arrived at Norfolk in early July and commenced training services necessitated by the outbreak of the Korean War. In July 1952, Sea Dog was reassigned to SubRon 12 at Key West, Florida, whence she continued to provide training services. On 7 November 1952, while conducting exercises with Airship Squadron 2 off Jacksonville, Florida, she intercepted a distress signal from a damaged U.S. Navy blimp, K-119, commanded by then-Lieutenant G. Robert Keiser, USN, and proceeded at flank speed to the last reported position to pick up Keiser and 2 other survivors, the co-pilot and navigator, for further transfer to the rescue and salvage ship USS Escape (ARS-6). The blimp itself, however, proved too waterlogged to be towed back to port and was taken under fire by Sea Dog. The gas tanks were penetrated, and the burning blimp sank. Sea Dog remained based at Key West into the fall of 1955 when she was ordered to New London, Connecticut, to begin inactivation. Arriving early in December, she proceeded to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine for overhaul in January 1956; and, in May, she returned to New London, where she was decommissioned on 27 June. She remained in the New London Reserve Group until partially activated in February 1960 for service as a Naval Reserve training ship in the 1st Naval District. She served in that capacity until struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 2 December 1968. She was docked in Salem, Massachusetts as a floating museum until 1973 when she was sold for scrap. Sea Dog earned two battle stars during World War II. As of 2005, no other ship in the United States Navy has carried this name.

During most of its life, the News was known as The Buffalo Evening News. A gentleman's agreement between the Evening News and the Buffalo Courier-Express meant that the Evening News would be evening-only, and the Courier-Express would be morning-only. Until 1977, the News did not publish on Sundays because of the agreement, and its weekend edition appeared on Saturday evening. The Butler family owned the Evening News until 1977, when longtime owner and publisher Katherine Butler, granddaughter of the founder, died and left no heirs. The Evening News properties were placed in a blind trust, which sold the Evening News to Berkshire Hathaway. The new owners began publishing on Saturday and Sunday mornings. After a period of financial decline, the Courier-Express published its last issue on September 19, 1982. The Evening News then shortened its name to The Buffalo News and became an all-day newspaper, publishing two editions seven days a week. On October 1, 2006, the News announced it would abandon its evening edition later that month. Buffalo News building The Buffalo News had published three morning editions (Western New York, Final and Niagara) that appear online at BuffaloNews.com, reaching over 400,000 readers, across eight counties each day.

Based in Clearfield, Utah, the company was the successor to Arrow Development (1946–1981) and Arrow Huss (1981–1986), which were responsible for several influential advancements in the amusement and theme park industries. Among the most significant was tubular steel track, which provided a smoother ride than the railroad style rails commonly used prior to the 1960s on wooden roller coasters. The Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland, built in 1959, was Arrow's first roller coaster project. In 1975, Arrow Development introduced the first corkscrew style track Corkscrew, at Knott's Berry Farm that sent riders through a series of corkscrews. Arrow created several other \\"firsts\\" over the years, introducing the first suspended roller coaster in almost a century, The Bat, in 1981, and the world's first \\"hypercoaster\\", Magnum XL-200, which opened in 1989. They built the first 4th Dimension roller coaster, X2, which was designed by Alan Schilke in 2002. Arrow Development's ownership changed three times between the 1950s and 1980s. Arrow Dynamics would eventually survive two bankruptcies and spin off a sister company, Fabriweld, primarily to build track,19 December 1988 Kokomo Tribune, pg. 11; \\"Coaster Rolling Toward Finish\\" by 1988. Arrow Dynamics eventually closed on December 3, 2001. S&S; Worldwide purchased part of Arrow's remaining assets on October 28, 2002, and the remainder of the company was dissolved. In 2012, Sansei Yusoki Co. of Osaka, Japan, acquired a 77.3% interest in S&S; \\\\- Arrow.  History  Beginnings Arrow Dynamic's forerunner, Arrow Development, was founded in 1946 when Ed Morgan, Karl Bacon, Bill Hardiman, and Angus \\"Andy\\" Anderson, started a machine shop in Mountain View, California. They started out selling used machine tools, building truck parts and repairing cars until about 1950 when they built their first merry-go- rounds for San Jose's Alum Rock Park. In 1953, they contacted Walt Disney, who was just beginning to plan a new type of amusement park in California. Disney hired the company to help design and build the vehicles for Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. They would eventually design and build the ride systems for many of Disneyland's original and early rides, including Mad Tea Party, King Arthur Carrousel, Casey Jr. Circus Train, and Snow White's Scary Adventures. Disney continued to use Arrow as Disneyland expanded. Arrow designed and built Dumbo the Flying Elephant, Autopia, and Alice in Wonderland in coming years as well as upgrading and renovating the King Arthur Carrousel. Roller coaster manufacturing Matterhorn Bobsleds, the first Arrow Development roller coaster. In 1959, Arrow Development designed what was to be their first of many roller coasters, the Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland in Anaheim, California. Built in conjunction with WED Imagineering, the ride was the first modern tubular steel tracked roller coaster. After construction of the Matterhorn, Disney bought a third of Arrow Development in an effort to keep them viable and at least partially in-house. Arrow had already developed rides for other customers, and had orders for more, so they moved into a larger plant in Mountain View. At the new location, Arrow developed vehicles, flumes and tracks for It's a Small World, Pirates of the Caribbean, Adventure Thru Inner Space, and the Haunted Mansion. Arrow developed the modern log flume ride, eventually installing over 50 around the world, beginning with El Aserradero at Six Flags Over Texas in 1963. In the 1970s, the company perfected and brought back the looping roller coaster. In 1975, Arrow installed one of the most important rides of its time, Corkscrew, which made its debut at Knott's Berry Farm as the world's first modern inverting coaster. Arrow made hundreds of coasters throughout the decades, including 17 Corkscrew-style coasters, 16 \\"runaway mine train\\" coasters like Cedar Creek Mine Ride and Adventure Express, custom-designed coasters like Loch Ness Monster, and Carolina Cyclone. Some of Arrow Development's later projects included what were at the time the world's tallest roller coasters, such as Magnum XL-200 at Cedar Point in 1989, and Pepsi Max Big One at Blackpool Pleasure Beach in 1994. Reorganizations and bankruptcy Arrow Huss logo (1981–1985) In 1971, Karl Bacon, Ed Morgan and Walter Schulze sold Arrow Development to Rio Grande Industries. At the time, Penn Central owned Six Flags and Rio Grande had plans to build theme parks of their own, purchasing Frontier Village in 1973. In the late 1970s, Arrow began teaching Vekoma how to build tubular track in their native Holland, and in return Vekoma became Arrow's European distributor. Rio Grande sold Arrow to the German manufacturing firm Huss Maschinenfabrik in 1981. The merger formed Arrow Huss. Dana Morgan, the son of Ed Morgan, was appointed the company's president, and Ron Toomer was made vice president and manager of engineering. Dana would leave the company and form Morgan Manufacturing in 1983. Although Arrow's coasters continued to sell well, Arrow Huss struggled financially, partially due to heavily investing in the Darien Lake theme park in New York, and the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition in New Orleans. Arrow Huss filed for bankruptcy in 1985, and 13 of the company's American officers negotiated a buyout. In 1986, the takeover was approved by the courts and the company re- emerged as Arrow Dynamics. Toomer served as president until 1993, Chairman of the Board until 1995, and as a consulting director until his retirement in 1998. In the late 1990s, Arrow Dynamic's bookings steadily decreased, with few installations toward the end of the decade. Despite attempts to keep up by implementing more updated design techniques, Arrow still found itself struggling to compete. Other manufacturers such as Bolliger & Mabillard and Intamin began to dominate the industry. Design and manufacturing costs for new, larger ride systems were increasing and competition grew. Bankruptcy loomed once again just as Arrow introduced the X (subsequently known as X2) at Six Flags Magic Mountain, a 4th dimension roller coaster designed by Alan Schilke. X opened to massive media attention and received an initially positive reception; however, several mechanical problems caused the ride to be closed for repairs during much of its first year of operation.

Neighbouring communes are Bedulita, Carenno, Roncola, Sant'Omobono Terme and Torre de' Busi. Geography Costa lies on a high slope above the Valle Imagna. The village has panoramic views of the Bergamo Alps, including Monte Resegone to the north. From the former ski resort of Forcella Alta and the Pertüs pass, elevation , the whole of the Brianza range is visible. For communication reasons the town has had closer links to the San Martino valley, Almenno San Salvatore and the plain, rather than to the rest of the Valle Imagna. Parish church History Originally the area seems to have been used for summer grazing, Costa seems to have been populated year-round only since 1300. The town faces northeast and gets very cold in winter; as a result Costa was known in local slang as \\"Valle Imagna's warehouse of snow\\" (la nevera della Valle imagna). When the Republic of Venice annexed the province of Bergamo in 1428, the town found itself on the borders between Venice and the Duchy of Milan. This is reflected in the slang of the town, which refers to \\"foreigners\\" as bir, the equivalent of sbirri, a medieval police force. It has been suggested that this dates back to customs officials sent from Venice to patrol the borders of the republic. In the Counter-reformation, a bishop sent a dispatch deploring the state of the village's church that was a result of the poverty of the area. A plague pit is evidence of the 1630 epidemic described by Alessandro Manzoni. Since the early 20th century, Costa Valle Imagna has grown in its role of summer resort.

Founded by Orrin Keepnews and Bill Grauer under his firm Bill Grauer Productions in 1953, the label played an important role in the jazz record industry for a decade. Riverside headquarters were located in New York City, at 553 West 51st Street.liner notes to The Little Giant History Initially the company was dedicated to reissuing early jazz material licensed from the Chicago-based Paramount Records label and Gennett Records. Reissued artists included Jelly Roll Morton, King Oliver, Ma Rainey, and James P. Johnson, but the label began issuing its own contemporary jazz recordings in April 1954, beginning with pianist Randy Weston. In 1955 the Prestige Records contract of Thelonious Monk was bought out and Monk was signed by Riverside, where he remained for the next five years. During the next few years, Cannonball Adderley, Bill Evans, Charlie Byrd, Johnny Griffin, Bob Corwin and Wes Montgomery made substantial contributions to Riverside's catalog. Most new records were produced by Keepnews, who served as creative head of the label and several subsidiaries, such as Jazzland Records, with Grauer directing the company's sales and business operations. Riverside offered an extensive folk catalog, including traditional performers like Bascom Lamar Lunsford, Obray Ramsey, and George Pegram and Walter Parham; and folk interpreters like Ewan MacColl, Jean Ritchie, Paul Clayton, Billy Faier, Oscar Brand, Cynthia Gooding and Bob Gibson. In 1956 Bill Grauer recorded, produced and edited the racing sounds of the Florida International Twelve-Hour Grand Prix of Endurance, Riverside Records RLP 5001. The record also contains interviews with Stirling Moss, Juan Manual Fangio and other racing drivers. Living Legends In 1960–61 Riverside produced an acclaimed series of albums featuring jazz and blues veterans such as Jim Robinson, Sweet Emma Barrett and Alberta Hunter. The objective was to record musicians before their artistry was lost forever. Many were no longer active and their union memberships had expired. Recognizing the importance of the project, the American Federation of Musicians suspended the rules. This \\"Living Legends\\" series was initially recorded in New Orleans. Later sessions were recorded in Chicago. The sessions took place at Societé des Jeunes Amis Hall, built in the 1800s. According to the producer, Chris Albertson, the hall was a \\"Creole fraternal headquarters and it proved to have every advantage over a studio; apart from its live sound, it gave the performers familiar surroundings... The hall's acoustical sound was exactly what I wanted to recapture: the same kind of ambience that lent such character to Bill Russell's 1940s American Music recordings from San Jacinto Hall.\\" One of the musicians invited to participate was Louis Cottrell, Jr. Cottrell organized a trio comprising McNeal Breaux, Alcide \\"Slow Drag\\" Pavageau with Emmanuel Sayles sitting in playing guitar and banjo. The band was so well received that they continued to play together. The music on this album has been described as \\"more polite and subtle than the city's 'downtown' music... an intimate, low-key delight.\\" Cottrell's playing has also been well received: Riverside Wonderland Under the subsidiary label Riverside Wonderland, the company also produced a series of children's albums, including two Alec Templeton albums, an album of Martyn Green reading from the Arabian Nights, a Christmas fantasy, Grandpa Magic's Toyshop starring Ed Wynn, Edith Evans narrating the story of the first Christmas, and a six-record album set of the complete Alice in Wonderland, narrated by Cyril Ritchard, a rarity in the LP era when books were seldom recorded complete. An album of excerpts from the book was also issued, and the six records in the complete set were also issued as separate volumes. End Grauer died, following a sudden heart attack, in December 1963, and the company filed for voluntary bankruptcy in July 1964. The catalogue was taken over by ABC Records, which reissued some of it, but virtually all Riverside masters were acquired by Fantasy Records in 1972. The majority of this material was subsequently reissued on CD as part of the owners' Original Jazz Classics series and remains available today from current Fantasy catalogue owner Concord Records.

It is named after Roberto C. Goizueta, former Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company. Goizueta Business School, Emory University History On February 18, 1919, the dean of Emory College, Howard Odum, recommended the creation of a \\"school of economics and business administration\\" to the Board of Trustees. Thus, in the fall of 1919, the new school worked with Emory College to offer courses in economics, accounting, and business law. By 1925, there was one faculty member and full-time assistant, five staff members and 145 students. In 1926, eight students received the Bachelor of Business Administration degree. Two decades after the school awarded degrees in business administration, the school accepted its first female student in 1954. In the same year, the MBA program commenced, with 19 registered students. In 1992, the Evening MBA program was introduced. When the American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business began accrediting master’s programs, Emory’s program was one of the first to be approved. Four years later, Emory appeared on the list of the top American colleges and universities producing U.S. executives. This newfound position accompanied new programs, such as the concentration within the MBA program for professional accounting and, in 1979, the Executive MBA program. Also at this time, the school created a plan to allow students to complete both the MBA and Juris Doctor degree within four years. In 1994, the school was renamed for Roberto C. Goizueta, the CEO of The Coca-Cola Company. The millennium brought about a new PhD program in business administration and a new program in Real Estate. The school announced Karen Sedatole as interim dean in 2020. Academics Facilities Main campus Goizueta is located on the main campus of Emory University, located in the Druid Hills section of unincorporated DeKalb County, Georgia, a suburban community near Atlanta. Also located on the main campus are Emory College of Arts and Sciences and all graduate and professional schools, including the Law and Medical schools. Other key buildings on campus include the Dobbs University Center (DUC), the Woodruff PE Center (WOODPEC), and the Woodruff Library, which contains the Goizueta Business Library. Main campus is about a 15-minute drive from downtown and midtown Atlanta as well as the Buckhead area. The building at the corner of Fishburne Drive and Clifton Road was dedicated in October 1997. A significant part of the funding was made possible by the Woodruff Foundation and Emory Board of Trustees Chair Bradley Currey. Goizueta Foundation Center Completed in 2005, the 90,000 square foot Goizueta Foundation Center for Research and Doctoral Education houses areas for PhD students, Executive MBA classrooms, the MBA Career Management Center, and conference and breakout rooms. The Balser Art Collection, a collection of art including original works by Andy Warhol, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí, is located throughout the center. Notable faculty * Gregory Waymire - Asa G.

He served as a Member of the Parliament of Canada from 1993 to January 2006 and again from October 2008 until August 2015. On August 6, 2010, he was appointed to the Canadian Cabinet as Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, Federal Interlocutor for Métis and Non-Status Indians, and Minister responsible for the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency until his resignation on February 15, 2013 over his inappropriate written communication to the Tax Court of Canada. He later returned to Cabinet as Chief Government Whip, and served in that capacity until the 2015 election, which saw both Duncan's own defeat and the defeat of the government. Education Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba and raised in British Columbia, Duncan attended the University of British Columbia and graduated with a B.Sc. F from their Faculty of Forestry in 1972. Duncan's first experience as an elected official was as an alderman in Ucluelet, British Columbia from 1982–83. Entrance to politics In the 1993 election, Duncan was elected as a member of the Reform Party. He has served in all that party's incarnations up until the 2006 federal election, when he lost his seat to Catherine J. Bell of the New Democratic Party by 630 votes. Duncan was the Conservative Party's Official Opposition Critic for Natural Resources. During that time he served on the Natural Resources Committee. He helped shape Conservative Party policy on west coast offshore oil and gas, softwood lumber trade and the pine beetle epidemic. While in parliament, he was a member of the \\"Restaurant Caucus\\" in the House of Commons, a group of MPs who have interests in the restaurant industry. Duncan's Private Member's Bill C - 259 passed the 38th Parliament to receive Royal Assent to eliminate the excise tax on jewelry. Duncan made parliamentary history as the first MP to have a Private Member's bill related to cutting taxation pass. He won the Vancouver Island North Conservative Party nomination for the 2008 federal election and was elected with 45.78% of the vote.

On August 6, 2010, in a minor cabinet shuffle, he joined cabinet as Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development. Under the Harper government, several key bills with a direct effect on aboriginal communities have stalled. As a result, First Nations across Canada have embarked on a widespread and prolonged series of demonstrations under the banner of \\"Idle No More.\\" In addition, Attawapiskat chief Theresa Spence began a fast in December 2012 to demand a meeting with Harper and a Crown representative. In response, Duncan wrote to Spence requesting she give up her hunger strike and meet with him. \\"I didn’t ask for Minister Duncan,\\" Spence replied. \\"And I have dealt with him before. When I observe him, he doesn't have a mind of his own because, before he would answer a question, he would always look at his people. He's not the Prime Minister.\\" On February 15, 2013, he resigned from his cabinet position as Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development after improperly advocating to a tax court on behalf of a constituent in June 2011, and was replaced by James Moore. He returned to cabinet in the more junior role as Minister of State and Chief Government Whip in July 2013.

Overview Marvel's goal was to create comic books that would appeal to manga readers. Other than in the art, the titles shared little in common, with, for example, Runaways and Sentinel being aimed at children and younger teenagers and Mystique touching on espionage and darker themes better suited for an older audience. The results were a mixed bag. While New Mutants, Mystique, Runaways and Sentinel earned critical acclaim and a devoted fan following, Human Torch, Namor and Venom failed to generate interest, with the last surviving eighteen issues on the back of exceptionally high initial sales. The imprint was discontinued in late 2003. Mystique was the longest running title - lasting twenty-four issues, although it was absorbed into the mainstream Marvel Comics imprint and had a change of writer as part of the X-Men: ReLoad event after the thirteenth issue, while New Mutants, also part of ReLoad, was relaunched from with a new first issue as New X-Men: Academy X at the same time. Venom and Runaways carried the imprint branding for the longest period, lasting until their eighteenth issues, after which Runaways was briefly cancelled before being relaunched as part of the Marvel Next initiative, while Venom was canceled outright. The other series were canceled after twelve issues. Since then, Runaways has received a boost from high digest-sized trade paperback (TPB) sales, which was one of the reasons for its relaunch, while Sentinel was also revived, as a five-issue miniseries, for the same reason. However, Human Torch also received a single digest without signs of revival.

From 1958 until his death, he taught at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music, where he held the title of Distinguished Professor.  Biography   Child prodigy  Starker was born in Budapest to a father of Polish descent and a mother who had immigrated from the Russian Empire, both Jewish. His two older brothers were violinists, and the young János (named for the hospital Szent János kórház [lit. St. John's Hospital] in which he was born) was given a cello before his sixth birthday. A child prodigy, Starker made his first public performances at ages six and seven. He entered the Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest to study with Adolf Schiffer and made his debut there at age 11. Starker began teaching other children at age eight, and by the time he was 12, he had five pupils. Starker counted among his strongest influences Leo Weiner, a composer who taught chamber music. Zoltán Kodály, Béla Bartók and Ernő Dohnányi were also members of the Liszt Academy faculty. In his autobiography, Starker wrote that at the age of 13 he played Dohnányi's Konzertstuck for Cello for the composer (who was then the director of the Academy), who accompanied him at the piano.Starker, Janos, The World of Music According to Janos Starker, Indiana University Press, 2004, p. 130 Starker made his professional debut at age 14, playing the Dvořák concerto with three hours' notice when the originally scheduled soloist was unable to play. He left the Liszt Academy in 1939 and spent most of the war in Budapest. Because of his youth, Starker escaped the tragic fate of his older brothers, who were pressed into forced labor and eventually murdered by the Nazis. Starker nevertheless spent three months in a Nazi internment camp.János Starker, Encyclopaedia Britannica  Professional career  Starker (right) in 1995 After the war, Starker became principal cellist of the Budapest Opera and the Budapest Philharmonic Orchestra. Starker left Hungary in 1946. He gave a successful concert in Vienna, then remained there to prepare for the Geneva Cello Competition. At the competition, held in October 1946, he received a bronze medal. After competing in Geneva, Starker spent a year working on his technique in Paris. \\"I played like a blind man,\\" he said. \\"What happens to the bird who flies and doesn't know how it flies? That's what happens to child prodigies.\\" At the conclusion of his year in Paris, he made his first recording of Kodaly's Sonata in B minor for solo cello. The recording earned him the Grand Prix du Disque. He went on to make three more recordings of the work. Starker emigrated to the United States in 1948 to become principal cellist of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra under Antal Doráti. In 1949, he moved to New York City to become principal cellist of the Metropolitan Opera under Fritz Reiner. It was in New York that Starker made the first of his recordings of the Bach Cello Suites. In 1953, Starker became principal cellist of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra when Fritz Reiner became the music director. In 1958, Starker moved to Bloomington, Indiana, where he settled for the rest of his life. At the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music he became a professor and resumed his solo career.  Recorded repertoire  Starker made over 150 recordings. He recorded the Bach solo cello suites five times, most recently for RCA Victor Red Seal in 1997 for which he won a Grammy Award. He was also nominated for a Grammy Award for his 1989 recording of the works of David Popper. He had concerti written for him by David Baker, Antal Doráti, Bernhard Heiden, Jean Martinon, Miklós Rózsa, and Robert Starer. He twice recorded the Konzertstück for Cello and Orchestra by Ernő Dohnányi, the work he had played at age 13 with the composer: first, in 1956/57, with the Philharmonia Orchestra led by Walter Susskind, and the composer in attendance for all sessions (the composer was \\"angry\\" that the producer, Walter Legge, had insisted on cutting \\"the orchestra tutti at the start of part three\\"Adam Stern, booklet notes to Delos CD 3095 ); and second, without cuts, with the Seattle Symphony Orchestra led by Gerard Schwarz in 1990.  Cellos  From 1950 to 1965, Starker played and recorded on the Lord Aylesford Stradivarius, the largest instrument made by Antonio Stradivarius. In 1965 Starker acquired a Matteo Goffriller cello believed to have been made in Venice in 1705; known previously as the \\"Ivor James Goffriller\\" cello, Starker renamed it for its certification as \\"The Star\\" cello.  Reviews and published works  Many documentaries, articles in magazines, and newspaper stories have acknowledged János Starker's virtuosity. He published numerous books and musical scores through Peer International, Schirmer, and International Music. His autobiography, The World of Music According to Starker, was published in 2004 by Indiana University Press.  Playing style  Starker's playing style was intense and involved great technical mastery. According to some of his students, his technique revolved around long, legato notes, with very little shifting noise from his left hand, resulting in smooth, pure tones, \\"each note sounding like a jewel.\\" Starker himself described his sound as \\"centered\\" and \\"focused.\\" He was known for his ability to produce an extremely wide range of sounds and tone shading. He eschewed the wide vibrato favored by some of his peers—which he viewed as a cover for poor intonation—and was known for his patrician stage presence, preferring to let the music do the emoting. He quoted his long-time friend and colleague, György Sebők, who said, \\"Create excitement. Don't get excited.\\" Personal habits Starker was a lifelong smoker with a sixty-cigarette-per-day habit.The New York Times obituary He also drank copious amounts of scotch whiskey. He once refused to perform a concert in Columbia, SC that he was supposed to play because he was not allowed to smoke his \\"pre-concert cigarette\\" backstage.

It is a part of Les Trois Vallées, the largest linked ski areas in the world. Courchevel also refers to the towns of Courchevel 1300 (Le Praz), Courchevel 1550, Courchevel 1650 (Moriond), and Courchevel 1850, which are named for their altitudes in metres. The resort centre of Courchevel is at 1,747 metres (5,732 ft).Courchevel battle The name Courchevel 1850 was chosen for marketing reasons to compete with rival ski resort Val d'Isère. It is the Jardin Alpin area of Courchevel 1850 rather than the centre which is located at 1,850 metres (6,070 ft). Location Courchevel used to be part of the commune of Saint-Bon-Tarentaise, but in 2017 that was merged with La Perrière into the new commune of Courchevel. In spite of the name, the commune's administrative offices are not located in Courchevel, but still in the nearby village of Saint-Bon-Tarentaise. Courchevel is in the Tarentaise Valley, Savoie département, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region. History View from Saulire peak, 2700 m. The original resort was planned during World War II with a study in 1942 by the Vichy regime and in a doctorate by the town planner Laurent Chappis. Chappis was a natural choice to direct the development of the resort in the immediate post war years. Courchevel 1850 was significant, as it was the first resort in France to be constructed from scratch, rather than based around an existing village. Tarentaise Valley Skiing Within the Tarentaise Valley you find the biggest concentration of world-class ski resorts in the world. Most well known neighbour systems are Paradiski (Les Arcs, La Plagne) and Espace Killy (Val d'Isère and Tignes). A weekly lift ticket in Courchevel/Les Trois Vallées gives you a choice to ski one day in each of the other two systems mentioned. There were once plans to interlink all systems and resorts to create the – by far – largest ski area in the world. However, that vision was ended with the creation of the Vanoise National Park. 1992 Winter Olympics The Courchevel valley also includes the town of La Tania, built as competitors accommodation for the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville. Le Praz hosted the Olympic ski jumping and Nordic combined competitions for those games took place at Tremplin du Praz in Le Praz.1992 Winter Olympics official report. pp. 88–91. There was a ski jump in Courchevel 1850 on the snowfront, which was removed recently due to safety precautions.  2019 Fire  Before dawn on January 20th 2019, a fire broke out in one of the buildings in the hamlet of Courchevel 1850, which houses seasonal workers of the resort, killing two and injuring at least 22. A local French newspaper reported that 130 firefighters were on the scene.  2023 Alpine Ski World Championships  In May 2018, Courchevel was named a joint host of the 2023 FIS Alpine World Ski Championships with Méribel. It will be the first time since 2009 that France has hosted the FIS World Championships, when they took place in Val d'Isère. Races in Courchevel will finish in Courchevel Le Praz. A new super-leisure centre called L'Alpinium is under construction in Le Praz and will improve connections to Courchevel 1850 and provide more parking. Resort Courchevel is the most western resort of the Three Valleys, the biggest connected ski area in the world. It consists of four satellite villages: Courchevel Le Praz, Courchevel 1550, Courchevel 1650 and Courchevel 1850. Its highest resort, Courchevel 1850, is considered exclusive, attracting wealthy clientele including royal families. In the 2011–2012 season, Courchevel rebranded, changing the names of each of the four villages in a move away from the association with altitude. Courchevel 1850 is now known simply as Courchevel, Courchevel 1650 was renamed Courchevel Moriond; Courchevel 1550 is now called Courchevel Village and Courchevel 1330 was renamed Courchevel Le Praz.Courchevel Changes Village Names Courchevel has 11 luxury hotels with a 5-star ranking. In 2011 France introduced a 6th star ranking for hotels, named \\"palaces\\". Eight hotels in France have received this rating, of which two are in Courchevel's Jardin Alpin area. The resort has seven restaurants with Michelin stars, of which four have two stars, including Le Chabichou. It also hosts a variety of luxury shops including Louis Vuitton, Hermès, Valentino, Loro Piana, Prada, Cartier, Fendi, Dior and Chanel. The majority of Courchevel's visitors are Russian. Many Russians visit during New Year and Russian Orthodox Christmas on 7 January. As a result, the first two weeks of January are high season weeks in Courchevel. The resort's name is associated with the super-rich in Russia.guardian.co.uk Winter sport Russia 2006/jan/22 Courchevel has one of the largest bases for ski instructors and other seasonal workers due to the size of the three valleys area. Courchevel's couloirs are considered some of the most difficult black runs in the world. Courchevel's sister city is Park City, Utah in the United States, and it has a red-graded ski piste named \\"Park City\\". Airport Courchevel's Altiport Courchevel's airport has a very short and steeply sloped runway, with a length of and a gradient of 18.5%. The airport has a dangerous approach through deep valleys, which can only be performed by specially certified pilots. On landing there is no go-around procedure, as most of the world's airports have; there is merely a very steep hill which has seen a few accidents since the airport first opened. Larger propeller aircraft such as the Twin Otter and Dash 7 (carrying up to 50 people) have been regular users of the airport over the years, but have since been phased out of use and smaller Cessnas and helicopters are now the main users.

Although no clear data is available about the settlement, the old fort walls can be traced near the 'Jeera' river towards the plains of Ambapali. From an inscription of the 11th century AD, it is believed that the original name of the place was \\"Bahgar Kota\\". Balaram Dev, the Chauhan king of Sambalpur ruled this province when it acquires the name \\"Bargarh\\". He made it his headquarters for some time while the fort near the Jeera River was to be built. Narayan Singh, the last Chauhan King of Sambalpur gave the whole land of Bargarh to two Brahmin brothers Krushna Dash and Narayan Dash, son of Baluki Dash who was killed in action by the Gond Rebel led by Baldia Ray and Mahapatra Ray. The Padampur sub-division of bargarh, popularly known as the \\"Borasambhar Region\\" was the headquarters of the Zamindari extended over 2178 km2. This is the biggest sub- division of Bargarh District which has also a feudal history with a tribal leader. Buddhism played a significant role in defining the lifestyle of the people for a short period of time. Some ancient Buddhist monasteries and sculptures can be seen along a belt starting from Bijepur block (Ganiapali) to the Paikamal block (Nrusinghanath), which has a clear mention in Huen-Tsang's literature as Po-Li-Mo-Lo-Ki-Li (Parimalagiri) (Pasayat, 2007, 2008). The legendary hero Veer Surendra Sai led his war against the British from Debrigarh, which is a peak on the Barapahad Range. His fight against the British Raj particularly after the First War of Independence in 1857 was remarkable in the history of freedom struggle in India (Pasayat and Singh, 2009; Panda and Pasayat, 2009). Debrigarh today is a tiger sanctuary. Barabakhra (12 caves) used to be a secret meeting place during this period. Bargarh was a subdivision of old Sambalpur district until April 1992, when the then chief minister Mr. Biju Patnaik declared it as the headquarters of the newly formed district by the same name. Demographics India census, Bargarh had a population of 83,651. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Bargarh has an average literacy rate of 76%, higher than the national average of 59.5%; with 57% of the males and 43% of females literate. 11% of the population is under 6 years of age. Other than Oriya speaking people who form the majority, the town has some Marwari community who have migrated and settled down. Within the Oriya speaking population, the major communities are Kuiltas, Dumals, Agharias, Bhulia/Meher, Teli, etc. Kuiltas and Dumals are presumed to be an offshoot of the original Chasa (agrarian) community and are synonymous with the Khandayats of the coastal region. This is evident by the striking similarity of rituals and the gods they pray. Bhulias were migrated to and settled in this region by some rulers, but the exact time period is controversial. Agraria's were migrated from the Mughal empire of Agra for establishing a cultivator community during the war when Kuiltas was assigned the duty of part-time Kshatriyas. Oriya is the language for communication, official purposes and for education.

Being a pilgrim spot, it has been appealing the minds of lakhs of people, with magical glitters, for the last so many centuries. This is the Dawning – place of the mention Lord Nrushinghnath, the presiding Deity of the sacred mount Gandhamardhan– endearing multitude of memories, surprisingly amalgamating the legends of the Ramayan, the Mahabharat, the Buddhist Era; even reminiscent of Bhoj Raj, Kabir and Tantracharya Nagarjuna (the preserver of all scripture). Nrusinghnath is a form of Hindu Lord Vishnu. Gandhamardan In the Treta Yuga (the Silver Age), Jambavan (the unerring counselor of Rama) had suggested Hanuman to bring Bisalyakarani ere dawn, so that Lakshmana would rise back to life. It was in the middle of the war between Lord Rama and Ravana. Hanuman failed to identify the particular herb and carried on his shoulders a huge Himalayan mass. While flying above and proceeding toward Lanka (the kingdom of Ravana), a portion dropped down. Gandhamardan is synonymous to that portion only. Hiuen T'sang Glowing tributes are paid to Hiuen T'sang, the champion Chinese traveler, who was attracted by the scenic splendor of Gandhamardan, during his tour to Dakhin Koshal (part of which is current Chhatisgarh and the bewitching colorful zone of Western Odisha). He has spoken of the flowering Buddhist University of PARIMALGIRI (po-lo-mo-lo-ki-li), which had its campus on the picturesque Gandhamardan hills. Ecological Pyramid Besides being home of more than 5000 rare medicinal herbs (some hitherto - unidentified), providing medicines for fatal diseases like cancer, tuberculosis, leprosy, filarial, epilepsy, asthma, kidney and liver dysfunctions even AIDS, Gandhamardan serves as a wildlife sanctuary for a large number of rare species of birds and animals and thereby donating its portions towards balancing the Global Ecological Pyramid. The Temple The foundation for the temple was laid down by Baijal Dev on 17 March 1413 AD. as per inscriptions. The temple of Lord Nrushinghnath is only high. It is divided into two parts; the first being the seat of the Lord – a short, raised narrow plinth and the other Jaga Mohan (the antechamber) having three gates and is supported by four pillars, the like found nowhere in Odisha. The rocks used in the Jaga Mohan pillars are of a rare kind. They are not seen in the Gandhamardan hills. Believed that, from far off places, Baijal Dev had brought them. With a soft rubbing, these rocks begin to scintillate, to a degree. While entering inside the inner-sanctum, one can see the rock statues of Nav Grahas (the Nine planets of Astrology) in a line. Papaharini The main perennial flow of Gandhamardan is Papaharini, literally meaning, destroyer of sins. It is symbolic of Sanatan-the continuum of past, present and future. Flowing out of the confluence of seven fountains, called Saptadhar– it has an average width of 12 ft. No man-made tributary can flow into it. Nothing can pollute or adulterate it. Running about 25 km it has touched the Ang tributary and finally embraced Mahanadi. The Mighty Mandap Via Satyaam, as one goes from Nrusimhanath to Harishankar an old- patterned cave is caught in sight. It is just 10.5 km from the main temple, having dimensions of 150 ft. length, 50 ft. breadth and 25 ft. depth. This mighty structure resembles that of a typical Buddhist cave and prompts us to recall the description of a Buddha Vihar by Hiuen T'sang. Asta-Sambhu In the district of Bargarh, a large number of Siva Temple were built during the Chauhan rule of undivided Sambalpur. The most important among them were those of the Asta-Sambhu or 8 Siva Temples such as (1) Bimaleswar Temple at Huma (Sambalpur), (2) Kedarnath Temple at Ambabhona (Bargarh), (3) Baidyanath Temple at Deogaon (Bargarh), (4) Balunkeswar Temple at Gaisama (Bargarh), (5) Mandhata Baba Temple at Maneswar (Sambalpur), (6) Swapneswar Temple at Sorna (Bargarh), (7) Visweswar Temple at Soranda (Bargarh) and (8) Nilakantheswar Temple at Nilji (Bhatli).

Dadhibaman Mandir : Dadhibamana Mandir is situated at Bhatli- one of the Blocks of Bargarh District. Dadhivaman is a form of Lord Jagannath and a parallel cart festival is organised accordingly. Bhatli is known as the Shreekhetra of Western Odisha. Wild life Sanctuary Debrigarh A peak in the Barapahar hills in Bargarh sub-division having a height of .

History  Detail from Andrews’ and Dury’s Map of Wiltshire, 1773 The name of the village and parish derives from the Giffard family, landowners, beginning with Berenger Giffard who was lord in 1086. The parish had 70 taxpayers in 1377. From the 16th century until the 20th, most of the population were employed by the parish's wealthy households; 493 were recorded at the 1801 census, and numbers declined since then, reaching a new low of 102 in 2011. In 1944, the 55th Armored Infantry Battalion of 11th Armored Division of the United States Army trained for two months on Salisbury Plain and was encamped at Fonthill New Abbey and in Fonthill Park. In 2004 a plaque was added to the war memorial at Tisbury in their memory. In 1952, John Morrison (later Baron Margadale) began to breed racehorses at 19th-century stables to the east of the village. His son James, 2nd Baron took over the Fonthill Stud in 1972, and breeding continues under Alastair, 3rd Baron. The stud has produced winners of several major races: the Nassau Stakes (Spree, 1963); the Oaks (Juliette Marny, 1975 and Scintillate, 1979); and the St Leger (Julio Mariner, 1978). Churches The Church of England parish church of Holy Trinity was built in 1864–66 to designs by the Gothic Revival architect T.H. Wyatt and is Grade II* listed. Pevsner wrote that the church: \\"groups extremely picturesquely from the E, with its NE tower with a spire rising between pyramid pinnacles, an apse, and a round turret to its N.\\" Today the church is part of the Nadder Valley Team Ministry. The 18th- century church Wyatt's church replaced a neoclassical church built in 1747–49 for Alderman Beckford, near the parish boundary where the Hindon – Tisbury and Fonthill Bishop – Semley roads cross. This in turn was a replacement for an older church, said in 1566 to have been dedicated to St Nicholas, that stood near the stream in the north-east quarter of the parish, close to the now- demolished Fonthill House. Houses on the Fonthill estate An early house was damaged by fire in 1624 or 1625 and was bought by Lord Cottington in 1632, who by 1637 had finished restoring it, and may have used the services of Inigo Jones. Around 1715, Cottington put a classical facade on the house and removed the formal gardens. Between 1745 and 1753 William Beckford (later Lord Mayor of London) re-aligned the estate, making the main entrances to the north and the south. He added a five-arched bridge over the lake, placed a folly on the high ground to the west of the house and demolished the old parish church. Fonthill House burnt down in 1755 and was replaced with a new one, Fonthill Splendens, built for Beckford to the south of the old one. The design of the house was initially based on Houghton Hall in Norfork. Those involved in the rebuilding project included Robert Adam, Sir John Soane and James Wyatt, Andrea Casali, J. F. Moon, Thomas Banks, and John Bacon the elder. An archway with two lodges, built c. 1756, spans the estate's northern entrance road. This house was inherited in 1770 by Beckford's son, William Thomas Beckford, who extended the lake and built grottoes on the lakeside. In the 1790s Beckford began to build Fonthill Abbey, on high ground a mile to the southwest, and he had parts of the house demolished to provide building material. The west portion of the house survived, becoming known as The Pavilion, and was bought around 1829 by James Morrison, the millionaire draper and railway investor. His second son, Alfred, added one storey and an Italianate tower. The house was demolished in 1921 except for the west service wing which was converted into cottages that were demolished in 1975. In 1904 a new house was designed by Detmar Blow for Hugh Morrison on land to the east in the parish of Chilmark; at first known as Little Ridge, it was enlarged in 1921 and became known as Fonthill House. In 1972 it was replaced by a smaller house, still the seat of the Morrison family. As of 2013 the estate amounted to . Fonthill House in 2007 Fonthill Abbey Fonthill Abbey was an enormous mansion southwest of the village, in the style of a medieval abbey. Built by William Beckford between 1796 and 1813, the rest of the building was damaged by the collapse of the main tower in 1825, and almost wholly demolished by 1845; a habitable fragment remains. The site is marked on maps as Old Fonthill Abbey. The western part of Beckford's estate was later acquired by the 2nd Marquess of Westminster, who had a new Fonthill Abbey built in 1846-52 (Pevsner) or 1856-59 (VCH), some 500 metres southeast of the site of Beckford's abbey. This mansion, designed by William Burn in Scottish Baronial style, was demolished in 1955. Local government The civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. In 1934 the northwest portion of the parish, about one-fifth of its area, was transferred to Hindon parish.

Máncora, the largest left hand point break in the world, located in the northern coast of Peru, deserves special mention. In addition to this, the longest left- handed wave in the world is to be found at Puerto Chicama, which is over 4 km long. Swells are generated far south and most of the spots get consistent offshore winds. The large number of surf spots make it easy to find uncrowded waves. Surfing is a very popular activity in Peru; it has produced worldwide champions such as Sofía Mulánovich, 2004 female world champion, Luis Miguel \\"Magoo\\" De La Rosa ISA World Masters Surfing Championship 2007 leader, and Cristobal de Col, 2011 World Junior Champion. Lima, the capital of Peru, is also very attractive to surfers because of the variety of its waves. Surfers venturing into the waters in Peru are advised to use a wetsuit to protect themselves against the elements. Although the birthplace of modern surfing is associated with the Hawaii islands in the middle of the Pacific Ocean the first Peruvian settlers have tried to ride the waves for fish since ancient times. Today, surfing enjoys great acceptance within Peruvian society thanks to the worldwide success of its many national representatives. Long ago, surfing was deemed as a sport for the \\"elite\\" with a few spaces on newspaper articles, some minutes on the radio, an ever-present daily sea report on Double Nine Radio and scarce television interviews. Nowadays, surfing has found a place in the hearts all Peruvians and it currently has gained more exposure, having its own space on TV: Surf Peru, a program delivered through CMD, Magic Cable channel 3. Every summer, the beaches of Peru fill with surfing children, youth, adults and even pets. During winter, surf academies make their appearances to new surfers preparing for next summer. Peru has become the obligatory point of passage for various surfers around the world. Peru is, after Brazil, the second more important country in the region in this sport. The number of surf shops has increased near beaches or in big cities. Many artisan and industrial shops are making headway in a market that becomes more competitive every day. A surfboard, which had not previously cost less than $300, can now be purchased for $50. To achieve all this, however, Peruvian surfing had to go through many stages.  Pre-Inca age  The mythical origin of surfing has two versions: one that indicates its beginnings in Polynesia, and one indicates the sport began on the northern Peruvian coasts. The latter is based on pottery of the pre-Inca Moche culture, which apparently shows a man on logs, trying to traverse the waves. These ceramic pieces can be found in major museums in Peru. Although the latter is one of the most widespread versions, neither of the two versions have been confirmed. However, Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl confirmed there was contact between the ancient Peruvians and people from Polynesia. Therefore, it is not uncommon that the history of surfing is connected with Peru and Polynesia. Even today, one can appreciate the famous caballitos de totora (lit. \\"ponies of reed\\"), or small reed fishing boats, for example in Huanchaco. These 'caballitos' are small boats made of a material very similar to that used by Heyerdahl to build Kon-Tiki. The shape of the boats resemble the shape of a surfboard. Fishermen use them for easy handling.  Early days of modern surfing  The first major incursion of surfing on Peruvian beaches was in the 1930s when Carlo Dogny was invited to Hawaii for a tournament. It was in Hawaii that he met Duke Kahanamoku, the founder of modern surfing, who taught him the rudimentary techniques to master the waves. When World War II took place, Dogny had to return to Peru. In 1942 he founded Club Waikiki 2, and though it started out as just mats facing the sea, it was the first club for the exclusive practice of surfing in Peru. Today, Waikiki is one of the most famous and exclusive clubs of Lima. The first National Surfing Championship () in Peru took place in 1950. Since then, there have been more than 30 tournaments.  Evolution  Since the championship, won by Felipe Pomar, surfing began to spread to other latitudes of Lima and Peru. In the 1970s, the resort of Ancón opened north of Lima, and in the 1980s came San Bartolo and Punta Hermosa in the south. In those two decades, surfing not only spread along the Costa Verde and the beaches around Lima but extended to other beaches in Peru, arriving in La Libertad, Lambayeque and Piura. Peruvian waves were dominated by intrepid youth as Magoo de la Rosa and other surfers of the early years; these new young people looked to the sea as a friend and not as an obstacle to overcome. During the 1990s, surfing underwent a major takeoff in the creation of the Latin American Surfing Association (known by its acronym ALAS). This association served as an important showcase for the new batch of Peruvian surfers. The Pan American Championships in ALAS helped Peruvian surfing definitively take off internationally. At the same time, the South American championships, largely dominated by Brazil, became a new sample to the Peruvian delegation, who were just winning some dates in both competitions. Peru's surfboard building industry started with some wooden boards made locally. Around 1969, Dennis Choate and Leo Hetzel came and made Pacific Surfboards. Peru was the first country in Latin America to build surfboards and the main manufacturers of this craft were Aldo Fosca, Bruja Letts, Alan Sitt, Fernando Ortiz de Zevallos, Wayo Whilar, and Iván Zarda. Of these shapers, Ivan and Wayo still are on top of the world class elite designing and building surfboards. Both are still shaping state of the art surfboards. First surfboard Factory in Peru 1969, Aldo Fosca, Guillermo Letts, Wayo Whilar  News  In 2004, Sofía Mulánovich became the second Peruvian representative to reach the World Open Championship title. As had happened with Felipe Pomar in 1965, Mulanovich brought Peru back to the front page of world surfing. But she was not the only Peruvian winner; Analí Gómez became the Latin America champion in the open category. In 2007, she won the title of world runner-up in the youth category, the first Peruvian to win in the category. This was only the beginning of a long list of Peruvian champions in South American and Pan-American tournaments including Matías Mulánovich (Sofía Mulánovich's brother), Javier Swayne, Manuel Roncalla, Gabriel Villarán, and Sebastián Alarcón. All this was subject to the improvement of the beaches of Máncora, a small coastal town in the northern Piura Province and the seat of one of the dates on the Professional Circuit in 2007. The Peruvian Surf Team reached the 2010 Billabong ISA World Team Championship in Punta Hermosa, Peru. The final score was 14370 for Peru, Australia got second place with a 14160 points score and the third place was for South Africa with 11820 points. Months later, Peru won the Quicksilver ISA World Junior Championship 2011, again in Punta Hermosa. Cristobal de Col became World Junior Champion. This outstanding achievements consolidated Peru as a Surfing powerhouse. Today, surfing in Peru has begun to spread; boys and girls from different social classes practice this sport. It has the support of many sponsors and international events have been conducted on the beaches in Peru.

Wirz was the commandant of the stockade of Camp Sumter, a Confederate prisoner-of-war camp near Andersonville, Georgia, where inhumane conditions led to a high mortality rate of Union detainees. After the war, Wirz was tried and executed for conspiracy and murder relating to his command of the camp. Since his execution, Wirz has become a controversial figure due to debate about his guilt and reputation, including criticism over his personal responsibility for Camp Sumter's conditions and the quality of his post-war trial. Career and family Heinrich Hartmann Wirz was born on November 25, 1823 in Zurich, Switzerland, to Hans Caspar Wirz and Sophie Barbara Philipp. Wirz received elementary and secondary education, and he aspired to become a physician but his family did not possess funds to pay for his medical education. Instead he became a merchant, working in Zurich and Turin. Wirz had married Emilie Oschwald in 1845 and had two children. In April 1847, he received a four-year prison term for inability to return money that he borrowed. The court commuted his sentence to 12-year forcible emigration, but his wife refused to emigrate and obtained a divorce in 1853.Arch Fredric Blakey. Wirz, Henry, American National Biography Online, February 2000. Retrieved November 25, 2015. In 1848, Wirz first went to Russia and the next year to the United States, where he found employment in a factory in Lawrence, Massachusetts. After five years, he moved to Hopkinsville, Kentucky, and worked as a doctor's assistant.Captain Henry Wirz, National Park Service He tried to establish his own homeopathic medicine practice in Cadiz, Kentucky, and also worked as superintendent of a water cure clinic in Northampton, Massachusetts.Tomes, R., & Smith, B. G. (1862). The war with the South: A history of the late rebellion, with biographical sketches of leading statesmen and distinguished naval and military commanders, etc. New York: Virtue & Yorston, Volume III, p. 685. In 1854, Wirz married a Methodist widow named Elizabeth Wolfe. Along with her two daughters, they moved to Louisiana, where in 1855 she gave birth to their daughter Cora. In Louisiana, Wirz worked for Levin Marshall as a plantation overseer and physician. Civil War Upon the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, 37 year-old Wirz enlisted as a private in Company A (Madison Infantry), 4th Battalion of Louisiana Infantry of the Confederate army in Madison Parish.Bergeron, Arthur W. Guide to Louisiana Confederate Military Units, 1861–1865. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1989, pp. 157–158. On his death bed, he said that he had taken part in the Battle of Seven Pines in May 1862, as an aide-de-camp to General Joe Johnston, during which he was wounded by a Minie ball and lost the use of his right arm. That account is disputed by historians, one of whom says the injury may have actually occurred during a six-thousand mile mission to track down missing records of Union prisoners. That journey and a subsequent three months of rehabilitation at his home, were completed by the end of 1862. After returning to his unit on June 12, 1862, Wirz was promoted to captain \\"for bravery on the field of battle.\\" Because of his injury, Wirz was assigned to the staff of General John H. Winder, who was in charge of Confederate prisoner-of-war camps, as his adjutant.Soldier Details: Wirz, Henry, General and Staff Officers, Non-Regimental Enlisted Men, CSA, Civil War Soldiers and Sailors Database, National Park Service According to later accounts by Wirz's daughter, Confederate President Jefferson Davis made Captain Wirz a Special Minister and sent him to Europe carrying secret dispatches to Confederate Commissioners James Mason in England, and John Slidell in France. Wirz returned from Europe in January 1864 and reported to Richmond, Virginia, where he began working for General Winder in the prison department. Wirz initially served on detached duty as a prison commandant in Alabama, but was then transferred to help guard Union prisoners incarcerated at Richmond. Camp Sumter In February 1864, the Confederate government established Camp Sumter, a large military prison near the small railroad depot of Anderson (now Andersonville) in south-western Georgia, built to house Union prisoners-of- war. In April 1864, Wirz arrived at Camp Sumter and remained there for over a year holding the post of commandant of the stockade and its interior. Wirz was praised by his many superiors and even by some prisoners, and was even recommended for, but not promoted to, major.Page,Haley. (1908). p. 187. Camp Sumter had not been constructed to its full plan, and was quickly overwhelmed by the influx of Union prisoners. Though wooden barracks were originally planned, the Confederates incarcerated the prisoners in a vast, rectangular, open-air stockade originally encompassing , which had been intended as only a temporary prison pending exchanges of prisoners with the Union. The prisoners gave this place the name \\"Andersonville\\", which became the colloquial name for the camp. Camp Sumter suffered from severe overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions, an extreme lack of food, tools, medical supplies, and potable water. Wirz recognized that the conditions were inadequate and petitioned his superiors to provide more support, but was denied. In July 1864, he sent five prisoners to the Union with a petition written by the inmates asking the government to negotiate their release. At its peak in August 1864, the Camp Sumter held approximately 32,000 Union prisoners, technically making it the fifth-largest city in the Confederacy. The monthly mortality rate from disease, dysentery, and malnutrition reached 3,000. Around 45,000 prisoners were incarcerated during the camp's 14-month existence, of whom close to 13,000 (28%) died. Trial and execution Wirz was arrested by a contingent of the 4th U.S. Cavalry on May 7, 1865, in Andersonville. He was taken first to Macon, Georgia, and then by rail to Washington, D.C., arriving there on May 10, 1865, where he was held in the Old Capitol Prison since the Federal government decided to put him on trial for conspiring to impair the lives of Union prisoners of war. A special Military Commission was convened with Maj. Gen. Lew Wallace presiding. The other members were Gershom Mott; John W. Geary; Lorenzo Thomas; Francis Fessenden; Edward S. Bragg; John F. Ballier, U.S. Volunteers; T. Allcock, 4th New York Artillery; and John H. Stibbs, 12th Iowa Volunteers. Col. Norton P. Chipman served as Judge Advocate. During the trial gangrene prevented him from sitting and he spent the trial on a couch. Charges The military tribunal took place between August 23 and October 18, 1865,Trial of Henry Wirz, A Congressionally Mandated Report Summarizing the Military Commission's Proceedings, United States. 40th Congress, 2d Session. 1867–1868. House Executive Document No. 23, December 7, 1867. held in the Court of Federal Claims, and dominated the front pages of newspapers across the United States. Wirz was charged with \\"combining, confederating, and conspiring, together with John H. Winder, Richard B. Winder, Joseph [Isaiah H.] White, W. S. Winder, R. R. Stevenson, and others unknown, to injure the health and destroy the lives of soldiers in the military service of the United States, then held and being prisoners of war within the lines of the so-called Confederate States, and in the military prisons thereof, to the end that the armies of the United States might be weakened and impaired, in violation of the laws and customs of war\\" and for \\"violation of the laws of war, to impair and injure the health and to destroy the lives—by subjecting to torture and great suffering; by confining in unhealthy and unwholesome quarters; by exposing to the inclemency of winter and to the dews and burning sun of summer; by compelling the use of impure water; and by furnishing insufficient and unwholesome food—of large numbers of Federal prisoners.\\"United States Congressional serial set, Issue 3794, p. 785. Wirz was accused of committing 13 acts of personal cruelty and murders in August 1864: by revolver (specifications 1, 3, 4), by physically stomping and kicking the victim (specification 2), by confining prisoners in stocks (specifications 5, 6), by beating a prisoner with a revolver (specification 13) and by chaining prisoners together (specification 7). Wirz was also charged with ordering guards to fire on prisoners with muskets (specifications 8, 9, 10, 12) and to have dogs attack escaped prisoners (specification 11).Court Martial of Henry Wirz, Charges and Specifications Wirz was found guilty of all charges except the murder in specification 4.Henry Wirz Court Martial, Finding of the Court Testimonies The National Park Service lists 158 witnesses who testified at the trial, including former Camp Sumter prisoners, ex-Confederate soldiers, and residents of nearby Andersonville. According to Benjamin G. Cloyd, 145 testified that they did not observe Wirz kill any prisoners; others failed to identify specific victims.Cloyd, Benjamin G. Haunted by Atrocity: Civil War Prisons in American Memory. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2010. Twelve said that they witnessed cruelty on the part of Wirz. One witness, Felix de la Baume, who claimed to be a descendant of the Marquis de Lafayette, identified under oath a victim allegedly killed personally by Wirz. Among those giving testimony was Father Peter Whelan, a Catholic priest who worked with the inmates, who testified on Wirz's behalf. Verdict In his closing statement, the Judge Advocate General (prosecutor) Joseph Holt, who had also prosecuted the Lincoln assassination trials, vilified Wirz and pronounced that, \\"his work of death seems to have been a saturnalia of enjoyment for the prisoner [Wirz], who amid these savage orgies evidenced such exultation and mingled with them such nameless blasphemy and ribald jest, as at times to exhibit him rather as a demon than a man.\\"Cloyd, Benjamin G. Haunted by Atrocity: Civil War Prisons in American Memory. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2010. In early November 1865, the Military Commission announced that it had found Wirz guilty of conspiracy as charged, along with 11 of 13 counts of acts of personal cruelty, and sentenced him to death. In a letter to U.S. President Andrew Johnson, Wirz asked for clemency, but the letter went unanswered. The night before his execution, Louis F. Schade, an attorney working on behalf of Wirz, was told by an emissary from a high Cabinet official that if Wirz would implicate Jefferson Davis in the atrocities committed at Andersonville, his sentence would be commuted. Allegedly, Schade repeated the offer to Wirz who replied, \\"Mr. Schade, you know that I have always told you that I do not know anything about Jefferson Davis. He had no connection with me as to what was done at Andersonville. If I knew anything of him I would not become a traitor against him, or anybody else, even to save my life.\\" Rev. P. E. Bole received the same visitor and later sent a letter to Jefferson Davis, who included it as well as Wirz's reply to Schade in his book, Andersonville and Other War-Prisons (1890).Davis, Jefferson. Andersonville and Other War-Prisons. New York: Belford Co, 1890. Andersonville quartermaster Richard B. Winder, who was in the prison at the time, also confirmed this episode. Execution Preparations for the hanging of Henry Wirz Wirz's execution near the U.S. Capitol Wirz's grave marker at Mount Olivet Cemetery, denoting him as a hero and a martyr Wirz was hanged at 10:32 a.m. on November 10, 1865, at the Old Capitol Prison in Washington D.C., located next to the U.S. Capitol. His neck did not break from the fall, and the crowd of 200 spectators guarded by 120 soldiers watched as he writhed and slowly strangled. Wirz was buried in the Mount Olivet Cemetery in Washington, D.C. Wirz was one of only two men tried, convicted, and executed for war crimes during the Civil War, the other being Confederate guerrilla Champ Ferguson. Confederate soldiers Robert Cobb Kennedy, Sam Davis, and John Yates Beall were executed for spying, and Marcellus Jerome Clarke and Henry C. Magruder were executed for being guerrillas. In 1869, Schade received permission from President Johnson to rebury Wirz's body, which had been buried at the Washington Arsenal alongside the Lincoln assassins. While the body was being transferred, it was discovered that the right arm, and parts of the neck and head, had been removed during autopsy. As of the late 1990s, the National Museum of Health and Medicine still had two of his vertebrae. Wirz controversy The Wirz Monument in Andersonville The Wirz controversy grew out of the questions remaining after his trial pertaining to guilt and responsibility for multiple deaths of prisoners of war in camps on both sides following suspension of the Dix-Hill Cartel prisoner exchange agreement in July 1863. The Grand Army of the Republic, the United Confederate Veterans, Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV), and the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC), among others, evoked sad memories of Civil War prisoners portraying Wirz either a villain, or a martyr-hero, thus further contributing to the disputation. From 1899 to 1916, sixteen states erected monuments dedicated to the Camp Sumter's prisoners.The Wirz Monument, National Park Service. In response, the United Daughters of the Confederacy initiated a construction of a monument honoring Henry Wirz in Andersonville, Georgia. Every year the UDC and SCV hold a memorial service at the monument. Until recently, SCV annually marched to Wirz's memorial in Andersonville along with supporters of a congressional pardon for him.Horwitz, Tony. Confederates in the Attic: Dispatches from the Unfinished Civil War. New York: Pantheon Books, 1998, p. 328-331. The SCV posthumously awarded Wirz their Confederate Medal of Honor, created in 1977. During and after the trial Wirz was reviled in the court of public opinion as \\"The Demon of Andersonville\\".The Demon of Andersonville; or, The Trial of Wirz, for the Cruel Treatment and Brutal Murder of Helpless Union Prisoners in his Hands. The Most Highly Exciting and Interesting Trial of the Present Century, his Life and Execution Containing also a History of Andersonville, with Illustrations, Truthfully Representing the Horrible Scenes of Cruelty Perpetuated by Him. Philadelphia: Barclay & Co., 1865. One controversy concerns a witness for the prosecution, Felix de la Baume, who was actually Felix Oesser, a deserter from the 7th New York Volunteers (Steuben) regiment. According to the National Park Service, de la Baume was definitely a prisoner at Andersonville and it is a myth that he was a key witness at the trial. After time passed, some writers suggested Wirz's tribunal was unfair and claimed that \\"Wirz did not receive a fair trial. Nevertheless, he was found guilty and sentenced to death.\\"Heidler, David Stephen, et al. Encyclopedia of the American Civil War: A Political, Social, and Military History, New York: Norton, 2001. Even a few of his former prisoners conceded during the trial that the little support Wirz received from the Confederate government in terms of food, water, and medical supplies made the conditions at Andersonville beyond his scope of responsibility. In 1980, historian Morgan D. Peoples referred to Wirz as a \\"scapegoat.\\"Morgan D. Peoples, \\"The Scapegoat of Andersonville’: Union Execution of Confederate Captain Henry Wirz\\", North Louisiana Historical Association Journal, Vol. 11, No. 4 (Fall 1980), pp. 3–18. Wirz's conviction remains controversial.Linda Wheeler. Wirz Took Controversial Fall for Andersonville Tragedy, The Washington Post, June 10, 2004. Despite the surrounding controversy, the Wirz trial, one of the nation's significant early war crimes tribunals, created enduring moral and legal notions and established the precedent that certain wartime behavior is unacceptable, regardless if committed under the orders of superiors or on one's own.Darrett B. Rutman, \\"The War Crimes and Trial of Henry Wirz,\\" Civil War History, Vol. 6 (June 1960), p. 117-133.James C. Bonner, \\"War Crimes Trials, 1865–1867,\\" Social Science, Vol. 22 (April 1947), p. 128-134. In popular culture Wirz is an important character in MacKinlay Kantor's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel Andersonville (1955), introduced in the third chapter during his mission to France in October of 1863. In Saul Levitt's 1959 play The Andersonville Trial, Wirz was first played by Herbert Berghof. When the play was recreated for an episode of PBS's 1970–71 season of Hollywood Television Theatre, Wirz was portrayed by Richard Basehart. Wirz was portrayed by actor Jan Tříska in the American film Andersonville (1996). See also *Tokyo Trials *Concentration Camps Footnotes References *Chipman, Norton, P.

He was a Member of Parliament for St. Michael's borough (Mitchell, Cornwall) 1807–1812. Education Hall was born at Dunglass, East Lothian, to Magdalena (died 9990763), daughter of Sir Robert Pringle, 3rd Baronet, of Tillich, Gloucestershire and Sir John Hall, 3rd Baronet (died 1776). He studied at Christ's College, Cambridge, and the University of Edinburgh. As an Edinburgh student during the early 1780s, Hall studied chemistry under Joseph Black and natural history under John Walker. Though mineralogy was frequent taught in medical courses, Walker was one of the first professors to offer systematic lectures on the new field of geology. While attending Walker's popular course, Hall was taught how to use the chemical composition of minerals to determine relative age of strata. Walker also emphasized the geological relevance of chemists like William Cullen, Joseph Black, Johann Pitt, Norbert Bergman, Johann Waller and Alex Consecrated. After his studies, Hall traveled to continental Europe where he actively sought out book dealers who could sell him works on chemistry, mineralogy and geology. He eventually traveled to France and met Lavoisier. He returned to Scotland to promote the new French chemical nomenclature. Geological research Hall was fascinated by James Hutton's Theory of the Earth during the late 1780s and 1790s. Hutton's theory suggested that the strata of the earth were continually being worn down or melted, thereby making the earth one giant system of materials' circulation. In the spring 1788 Hall was with Hutton and John Playfair on the boat trip east from his home at Dunglass along the Berwickshire coast to Siccar Point where they found the famous rock formation now known as Hutton's Unconformity. At this point Hall was still sceptical of the chemical viability of Hutton's theory, however, he soon reconciled these doubts and ended up publishing several papers on the chemical composition of strata. He carried out research on granite that showed that it was possible for molten rock to form conformities. He melted basalt in an iron furnace, and demonstrated that it returned to its original form when cooled. He melted limestone in a retort made from a gun barrel, to show that it did not decompose when melted under pressure. His results were published in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and were well received by those like John Playfair who wanted to use Hutton's theory to promote a more mathematical approach to geology. He also carried out the first analogue modelling to investigate the formation of folds, work published in 1815. Hall travelled extensively in Europe to examine geological formations of the Alps and Mount Etna, and noted the similarity of lava flows in Italy to locations in Scotland. Sir James Hall was President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and author of various works on architecture and the sciences. Family The grave of Sir James Hall, Greyfriars Kirkyard He married Helen Douglas (d. 1837), daughter of Dunbar Douglas, 4th Earl of Selkirk and sister of the 5th Earl of Selkirk. They had three daughters and three sons. Hall died at home at 132 George Street in the New Town in Edinburgh, Scotland. He is buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard in central Edinburgh. The grave lies against the western wall of the original churchyard, backing onto George Heriots School. He was succeeded by his son and heir, Sir John Hall, 5th Baronet, FRS. Another son, Basil Hall, was a noted traveller and writer; his daughter Eliza was mother of Houston Stewart Chamberlain. His daughter Magdalene Hall (1793-1822) married firstly 1815 Colonel Sir William Howe De Lancey and secondly Captain Henry Harvey; she was author of A Week at Waterloo (first privately published) and died in childbirth with her third child. By De Lancey, her first husband, Magdalene had no issue. He was an agnostic or atheist. See also * Scottish Enlightenment References Bibliography * M. D.

A former Australian international and New South Wales State of Origin representative forward, he played rugby for the Newcastle Knights whom he captained to the 1997 ARL premiership. Harragon was a regular presenter of The Footy Show and as of 2013 is the Chairman of the Newcastle Knights Advisory Board. Background Harragon was born in Kurri Kurri, New South Wales, Australia. Playing career Harragon was raised in the New South Wales town of Kurri Kurri, and played for Lakes United in the Newcastle competition. He joined the Newcastle Knights in 1988 and made his first grade debut in 1989 against the Balmain Tigers. He represented and captained Country, New South Wales and Australia. He was named man-of-the-match in the second game of the 1994 State of Origin series. At the end of the 1994 NSWRL season, he went on the 1994 Kangaroo tour. Harragon captained the Knights to the 1997 ARL premiership title in a grand final against Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, despite suffering from serious headaches and seizures throughout most of the season. Harragon excelled at the State of Origin level, making 20 consecutive appearances for New South Wales between Game I 1992 and Game II 1998. He holds the record for the second most consecutive Origin games by a New South Welshman (Danny Buderus played 21 consecutive State of Origin games between game I 2002 and game III 2008), and most appearances by a NSW forward. Between 1992 & 1998, Harragon was a frequent choice to play for the Kangaroos. During the 1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand, he helped Australia retain The Ashes. All up he scored three tries while representing his country. He missed the 1995 World Cup final due to injury, with Gary Larson being flown in to replace him. That year it was reported that Harragon would receive $1.2 million to secure his loyalty to the Australian Rugby League in addition to $700,000 per season for the next three seasons. In 1996, he captained the team in a World Cup Test against South Africa, and in 1997 he played in a match against the \\"Rest of the World\\". In 1999, Harragon participated in the first rugby league game to be played at Stadium Australia. Later that year, after playing 169 first grade games in a career lasting ten years, Harragon retired due to an ongoing knee injury mid-season. Post-playing Harragon has since become a media personality, working for local Newcastle station NBN Television, before joining Channel 9 as a member of The Footy Show panel (on which his \\"That's Gold\\" segment became immensely popular), and as a rugby commentator. Following format changes to the programme before the 2009 season, Harragon decided to leave the production. On Saturday 1 September 2007, his single \\"That's Gold\\" debuted at #8 on the ARIA Singles chart and #2 on the ARIA Physical Singles Chart. The song was distributed by Destra Entertainment/MRA Records. \\"That's Gold\\" is an homage to Spandau Ballet's 80s hit \\"Gold\\". Harragon was also a director of and is a life member of the Newcastle Knights, and is spokesman for NIB Health Funds and Subway. In 2016, Harragon became a contestant on Network Ten's second series of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in which he placed second. Harragon lives in Newcastle with his wife Pam, his daughter and two sons.

Early life and education Sally was born in Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, Scotland. At the University of Glasgow she studied English Language and Literature, in which she gained a first class degree. She later moved to the University of York, where she gained a diploma in social administration in 1973. She became part of the university's Social Policy Research Unit (SPRU), being appointed its director in 1987. Career In 1990 she was made a professor and in 1994 became head of the University of York's Social Policy and Social Work Department. She continued to conduct research right up until her death. Retiring as director of SPRU in 2002 she went on to carry out research in areas relating 'evidence based' methods to social policy. Death Sally Baldwin died 28 October 2003 at Tiburtina Station, Rome, Italy. The moving walkway she was travelling along at the station collapsed and she was crushed in the internal gearbox. It is believed that maintenance work on the walkway had resulted in several panels not being replaced properly, resulting in the accident. Since the accident, the former Institute for Research in the Social Sciences buildings at the University of York have been renamed The Sally Baldwin Buildings and the Sally Baldwin PhD Studentship has been set up in the Social Policy and Social Work Department, both in her memory.

He had a series of successful singles, notably the million-seller \\"Little Woman\\" (1969). Sherman retreated from his show business career in the 1970s for a career as a paramedic and a sheriff's officer, though he occasionally performed into the 1990s. Entertainment career In 1962, Sal Mineo wrote two songs for Sherman as well as arranging for Sherman to record the songs. In 1964, when Mineo asked Sherman to sing with his old band at a Hollywood party (where many actors and agents were in attendance), Sherman was signed with an agent and eventually landed a part on the ABC television show Shindig! as a regular cast member/house singer. Shindig! had a run of one year. Sherman made several records with Decca and another smaller label and was featured in teen magazines. In early 1968, he was selected for the role of the bashful, stammering logger, Jeremy Bolt, in the ABC television series Here Come the Brides (1968-1970). As of 1970, Bobby Sherman had received more fan mail than any other performer on the ABC-TV network. Sherman appeared on an episode of Honey West entitled \\"The Princess and the Paupers\\" as a kidnapped band member and an episode of The Monkees entitled \\"Monkees at the Movies\\", playing a pompous surfer/singer named Frankie Catalina in the vein of Frankie Avalon, performing the song \\"The New Girl in School\\" (the flip of Jan & Dean's \\"Dead Man's Curve\\"). Sherman released 107 songs, 23 singles and 10 albums between 1962 and 1976. In his recording career, he earned seven gold singles, one platinum single, and five gold albums. He had a career total of seven top 40 hits. In 1969, he signed with Metromedia Records. In May 1969, he released the single \\"Little Woman\\", which peaked at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (#2 in Canada) and spent nine weeks in the Top 20. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. in October 1969. His other hits were \\"Julie, Do Ya Love Me\\" (US #5/AC #2) (Canada #3) (Australia #3) (written by Tom Bahler), \\"Easy Come, Easy Go\\" (US #9/AC #2) (Canada #6), \\"Jennifer\\" (US #60/AC #9) (Canada #32), \\"La La La (If I Had You)\\" (US #9/AC #14) (Canada #7), and \\"The Drum\\" (US #29/AC #2) (Canada #7) (written by Alan O'Day). Some of these songs were produced by Jackie Mills, a Hollywood record producer, who also produced the Brady Bunch Kids. In Canada, \\"Hey, Mister Sun\\" reached #19, \\"Cried Like a Baby\\" reached #10, and \\"Waiting At The Bus Stop\\" reached #31. \\"La, La, La,\\" \\"Easy Come, Easy Go,\\" and \\"Julie, Do Ya Love Me\\" all sold in excess of a million copies and garnered further gold discs for Sherman. \\"Julie, Do Ya Love Me\\" was Sherman's sole excursion in the UK Singles Chart, where it peaked at #28 in November 1970. The song competed there for chart space with White Plains' cover version, which eventually placed higher at #8. Sherman toured extensively through the United States and the world in support of his records and albums. He gave many concerts to sellout crowds of mostly screaming young women from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s. The screaming of the young women was so loud that Sherman experienced hearing loss. Sherman was a frequent guest on American Bandstand and Where the Action Is. A March 1971 episode of The Partridge Family featured Sherman, serving as a back-door pilot for the ABC TV series Getting Together, which aired starting in September 1971. The show was canceled after 14 episodes. Sherman was a guest star on television series such as Emergency!,The Mod Squad, Ellery Queen, Murder She Wrote and Frasier. He has also been a guest on The Ed Sullivan Show, American Bandstand, The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour, KTLA Morning News, Visiting with Huell Howser on PBS, Good Day LA, The Rosie O'Donnell Show, Good Morning America, and The Tonight Show with both Johnny Carson and later Jay Leno. He was featured on 20/20, VH1, Entertainment Tonight, and Extra, among other television shows. Sherman was a regular cast member on the television show Sanchez of Bel Air in 1986. In 1998, after a 25-year absence, fans returned to see Sherman in concert as part of \\"The Teen Idol Tour\\" with Peter Noone and Davy Jones. Monkees member Micky Dolenz replaced Davy Jones on the tour in 1999. Sherman performed his last concert to date as a solo performer in Lincoln, Rhode Island on August 25, 2001. Although retired from public life, he still appeared corporate and charity events. He was ranked #8 in TV Guides list of \\"TV's 25 Greatest Teen Idols\\" (January 23, 2005 issue). Post-entertainment career When Sherman guest-starred on an episode of the Jack Webb television series Emergency! (\\"Fools\\", season 3, episode 17, aired January 19, 1974), he found a new calling. Eventually, he left the public spotlight and became an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT). He volunteered with the Los Angeles Police Department, working with paramedics and giving CPR and first aid classes. He officially became a technical Reserve Police Officer with the Los Angeles Police Department in the 1990s, a position he still held as of 2017. He was later promoted to Captain in the Los Angeles Police Department. For more than a decade he served as a medical training officer at the Los Angeles Police Academy, instructing thousands of police officers in first aid and CPR. He was named LAPD's Reserve Officer of the Year in 1999. Sherman also became a Reserve Deputy Sheriff in 1999 with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, continuing his CPR/emergency training of new deputy hires. Sherman retired from the Sheriff's Department in 2010. Sherman and his wife co-founded the Brigitte & Bobby Sherman Children's (BBSC) Foundation. The foundation's mission is to provide motivated students in Ghana with a high quality education and music program, thus giving them the tools they need to pursue higher education and become successful, contributing adults. Personal life Sherman was born to Robert Cabot Sherman Sr. and Juanita (née Freeman) Sherman in Santa Monica, California. He grew up in Van Nuys, California along with his sister Darlene. Sherman married Brigitte Poublon on July 18, 2010, in Las Vegas. Sherman had two sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel.

The medical record includes a variety of types of \\"notes\\" entered over time by health care professionals, recording observations and administration of drugs and therapies, orders for the administration of drugs and therapies, test results, x-rays, reports, etc. The maintenance of complete and accurate medical records is a requirement of health care providers and is generally enforced as a licensing or certification prerequisite. The terms are used for the written (paper notes), physical (image films) and digital records that exist for each individual patient and for the body of information found therein. Medical records have traditionally been compiled and maintained by health care providers, but advances in online data storage have led to the development of personal health records (PHR) that are maintained by patients themselves, often on third-party websites. This concept is supported by US national health administration entities and by AHIMA, the American Health Information Management Association. A medical record folder being pulled from the records In 2009, Congress authorized and funded legislation known as the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act to stimulate the conversion of paper medical records into electronic charts. While many hospitals and doctor's offices have since done this successfully, electronic health vendors' proprietary systems haven't always been compatible with one another, and an untold number of patients undergo duplicate procedures — or fail to get them at all — because key pieces of their medical history are missing. Because many consider the information in medical records to be sensitive private information covered by expectations of privacy, many ethical and legal issues are implicated in their maintenance, such as third-party access and appropriate storage and disposal. Although the storage equipment for medical records generally is the property of the health care provider, the actual record is considered in most jurisdictions to be the property of the patient, who may obtain copies upon request. Uses The information contained in the medical record allows health care providers to determine the patient's medical history and provide informed care. The medical record serves as the central repository for planning patient care and documenting communication among patient and health care provider and professionals contributing to the patient's care. An increasing purpose of the medical record is to ensure documentation of compliance with institutional, professional or governmental regulation. The traditional medical record for inpatient care can include admission notes, on-service notes, progress notes (SOAP notes), preoperative notes, operative notes, postoperative notes, procedure notes, delivery notes, postpartum notes, and discharge notes. Personal health records combine many of the above features with portability, thus allowing a patient to share medical records across providers and health care systems. Contents A patient's individual medical record identifies the patient and contains information regarding the patient's case history at a particular provider. The health record as well as any electronically stored variant of the traditional paper files contain proper identification of the patient. Further information varies with the individual medical history of the patient. Media applied Traditionally, medical records were written on paper and maintained in folders often divided into sections for each type of note (progress note, order, test results), with new information added to each section chronologically. Active records are usually housed at the clinical site, but older records are often archived offsite. The advent of electronic medical records has not only changed the format of medical records but has increased accessibility of files. The use of an individual dossier style medical record, where records are kept on each patient by name and illness type originated at the Mayo Clinic out of a desire to simplify patient tracking and to allow for medical research. Maintenance of medical records requires security measures to prevent from unauthorized access or tampering with the records. Medical history The medical history is a longitudinal record of what has happened to the patient since birth. It chronicles diseases, major and minor illnesses, as well as growth landmarks. It gives the clinician a feel for what has happened before to the patient. As a result, it may often give clues to current disease state. It includes several subsets detailed below. ;Surgical history :The surgical history is a chronicle of surgery performed for the patient. It may have dates of operations, operative reports, and/or the detailed narrative of what the surgeon did. ;Obstetric history :The obstetric history lists prior pregnancies and their outcomes. It also includes any complications of these pregnancies. ;Medications and medical allergies :The medical record may contain a summary of the patient's current and previous medications as well as any medical allergies. ;Family history :The family history lists the health status of immediate family members as well as their causes of death (if known). It may also list diseases common in the family or found only in one sex or the other. It may also include a pedigree chart. It is a valuable asset in predicting some outcomes for the patient. ;Social history :The social history is a chronicle of human interactions. It tells of the relationships of the patient, his/her careers and trainings, and religious training. It is helpful for the physician to know what sorts of community support the patient might expect during a major illness. It may explain the behavior of the patient in relation to illness or loss. It may also give clues as to the cause of an illness (e.g. occupational exposure to asbestos). ;Habits :Various habits which impact health, such as tobacco use, alcohol intake, exercise, and diet are chronicled, often as part of the social history. This section may also include more intimate details such as sexual habits and sexual orientation. ;Immunization history :The history of vaccination is included. Any blood tests proving immunity will also be included in this section. ;Growth chart and developmental history :For children and teenagers, charts documenting growth as it compares to other children of the same age is included, so that health-care providers can follow the child's growth over time. Many diseases and social stresses can affect growth, and longitudinal charting can thus provide a clue to underlying illness. Additionally, a child's behavior (such as timing of talking, walking, etc.) as it compares to other children of the same age is documented within the medical record for much the same reasons as growth. Medical encounters Within the medical record, individual medical encounters are marked by discrete summations of a patient's medical history by a physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant and can take several forms. Hospital admission documentation (i.e., when a patient requires hospitalization) or consultation by a specialist often take an exhaustive form, detailing the entirety of prior health and health care. Routine visits by a provider familiar to the patient, however, may take a shorter form such as the problem-oriented medical record (POMR), which includes a problem list of diagnoses or a \\"SOAP\\" method of documentation for each visit. Each encounter will generally contain the aspects below: ;Chief complaint :This is the main problem (traditionally called a complaint) that has brought the patient to see the doctor or other clinician. Information on the nature and duration of the problem will be explored. ;History of the present illness :A detailed exploration of the symptoms the patient is experiencing that have caused the patient to seek medical attention. ;Physical examination :The physical examination is the recording of observations of the patient. This includes the vital signs, muscle power and examination of the different organ systems, especially ones that might directly be responsible for the symptoms the patient is experiencing. ;Assessment and plan :The assessment is a written summation of what are the most likely causes of the patient's current set of symptoms. The plan documents the expected course of action to address the symptoms (diagnosis, treatment, etc.). Orders and prescriptions Written orders by medical providers are included in the medical record. These detail the instructions given to other members of the health care team by the primary providers. Progress notes When a patient is hospitalized, daily updates are entered into the medical record documenting clinical changes, new information, etc. These often take the form of a SOAP note and are entered by all members of the health-care team (doctors, nurses, physical therapists, dietitians, clinical pharmacists, respiratory therapists, etc.). They are kept in chronological order and document the sequence of events leading to the current state of health. Test results The results of testing, such as blood tests (e.g., complete blood count) radiology examinations (e.g., X-rays), pathology (e.g., biopsy results), or specialized testing (e.g., pulmonary function testing) are included. Often, as in the case of X-rays, a written report of the findings is included in lieu of the actual film. Other information Many other items are variably kept within the medical record. Digital images of the patient, flowsheets from operations/intensive care units, informed consent forms, EKG tracings, outputs from medical devices (such as pacemakers), chemotherapy protocols, and numerous other important pieces of information form part of the record depending on the patient and his or her set of illnesses/treatments. Administrative issues A ward clerk in the Menn Hospital, Colorado Medical records are legal documents that can be used as evidence via a subpoena duces tecum, and are thus subject to the laws of the country/state in which they are produced. As such, there is great variability in rules governing production, ownership, accessibility, and destruction. There is some controversy regarding proof verifying the facts, or absence of facts in the record, apart from the medical record itself. Demographics Demographics include patient information that is not medical in nature. It is often information to locate the patient, including identifying numbers, addresses, and contact numbers. It may contain information about race and religion as well as workplace and type of occupation. It also contains information regarding the patient's health insurance. It is common to also find emergency contact information located in this section of the medical chart. Production In the United States, written records must be marked with the date and time and scribed with indelible pens without use of corrective paper. Errors in the record should be struck out with a single line (so that the initial entry remains legible) and initialed by the author. Orders and notes must be signed by the author. Electronic versions require an electronic signature. Ownership of patient's record Ownership and keeping of patient's records varies from country to country. US law and customs In the United States, the data contained within the medical record belongs to the patient, whereas the physical form the data takes belongs to the entity responsible for maintaining the record per the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Patients have the right to ensure that the information contained in their record is accurate, and can petition their health care provider to amend factually incorrect information in their records. There is no consensus regarding medical record ownership in the United States. Factors complicating questions of ownership include the form and source of the information, custody of the information, contract rights, and variation in state law. There is no federal law regarding ownership of medical records. HIPAA gives patients the right to access and amend their own records, but it has no language regarding ownership of the records. Twenty-eight states and Washington, D.C. have no laws that define ownership of medical records. Twenty-one states have laws stating that the providers are the owners of the records. Only one state, New Hampshire, has a law ascribing ownership of medical records to the patient.  Canadian law and customs  Under Canadian federal law, the patient owns the information contained in a medical record, but the healthcare provider owns the records themselves. The same is true for both nursing home and dental records. In cases where the provider is an employee of a clinic or hospital, it is the employer that has ownership of the records. By law, all providers must keep medical records for a period of 15 years beyond the last entry.The Canadian Bar Association: Getting Your Medical Records The precedent for the law is the 1992 Canadian Supreme Court ruling in McInerney v MacDonald. In that ruling, an appeal by a physician, Dr. Elizabeth McInerney, challenging a patient's access to their own medical record was denied. The patient, Margaret MacDonald, won a court order granting her full access to her own medical record. The case was complicated by the fact that the records were in electronic form and contained information supplied by other providers. McInerney maintained that she didn't have the right to release records she herself did not author. The courts ruled otherwise. Legislation followed, codifying into law the principles of the ruling. It is that legislation which deems providers the owner of medical records, but requires that access to the records be granted to the patient themselves. UK law and customs In the United Kingdom, ownership of the NHS's medical records has in the past generally been described as belonging to the Secretary of State for Health and this is taken by some to mean copyright also belongs to the authorities. German law and customs In Germany, a relatively new law,http://dejure.org/gesetze/BGB/630f.html which has been established in 2013, strengthens the rights of patients. It states, amongst other things, the statutory duty of medical personnel to document the treatment of the patient in either hard copy or within the electronic patient record (EPR). This documentation must happen in a timely manner and encompass each and every form of treatment the patient receives, as well as other necessary information, such as the patient's case history, diagnoses, findings, treatment results, therapies and their effects, surgical interventions and their effects, as well as informed consents. The information must include virtually everything that is of functional importance for the actual, but also for future treatment. This documentation must also include the medical report and must be archived by the attending physician for at least 10 years. The law clearly states that these records are not only memory aids for the physicians, but also should be kept for the patient and must be presented on request. In addition, an electronic health insurance card was issued in January 2014 which is applicable in Germany (Elektronische Gesundheitskarte or eGK), but also in the other member states of the European Union (European Health Insurance Card). It contains data such as: the name of the health insurance company, the validity period of the card, and personal information about the patient (name, date of birth, sex, address, health insurance number) as well information about the patient's insurance status and additional charges. Furthermore, it can contain medical data if agreed to by the patient. This data can include information concerning emergency care, prescriptions, an electronic medical record, and electronic physician's letters. However, due to the limited storage space (32kB), some information is deposited on servers. Accessibility United States In the United States, the most basic rules governing access to a medical record dictate that only the patient and the health-care providers directly involved in delivering care have the right to view the record. The patient, however, may grant consent for any person or entity to evaluate the record. The full rules regarding access and security for medical records are set forth under the guidelines of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The rules become more complicated in special situations. A 2018 study found discrepancies in how major hospitals handle record requests, with forms displaying limited information relative to phone conversations. ;Capacity :When a patient does not have capacity (is not legally able) to make decisions regarding his or her own care, a legal guardian is designated (either through next of kin or by action of a court of law if no kin exists). Legal guardians have the ability to access the medical record in order to make medical decisions on the patient’s behalf. Those without capacity include the comatose, minors (unless emancipated), and patients with incapacitating psychiatric illness or intoxication. ;Medical emergency :In the event of a medical emergency involving a non-communicative patient, consent to access medical records is assumed unless written documentation has been previously drafted (such as an advance directive) ;Research, auditing, and evaluation :Individuals involved in medical research, financial or management audits, or program evaluation have access to the medical record. They are not allowed access to any identifying information, however. ;Risk of death or harm :Information within the record can be shared with authorities without permission when failure to do so would result in death or harm, either to the patient or to others. Information cannot be used, however, to initiate or substantiate a charge unless the previous criteria are met (i.e., information from illicit drug testing cannot be used to bring charges of possession against a patient). This rule was established in the United States Supreme Court case Jaffe v. Redmond.  Canada  In the 1992 Canadian Supreme Court ruling in McInerney v. MacDonald gave patients the right to copy and examine all information in their medical records, while the records themselves remained the property of the healthcare provider. The 2004 Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA) contains regulatory guidelines to protect the confidentiality of patient information for healthcare organizations acting as stewards of their medical records. Despite legal precedent for access nationwide, there is still some variance in laws depending on the province. There is also some confusion among providers as to the scope of the patient information they have to give access to, but the language in the supreme court ruling gives patient access rights to their entire record. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, the Data Protection Acts and later the Freedom of Information Act 2000 gave patients or their representatives the right to a copy of their record, except where information breaches confidentiality (e.g., information from another family member or where a patient has asked for information not to be disclosed to third parties) or would be harmful to the patient's wellbeing (e.g., some psychiatric assessments). Also, the legislation gives patients the right to check for any errors in their record and insist that amendments be made if required. Destruction In general, entities in possession of medical records are required to maintain those records for a given period. In the United Kingdom, medical records are required for the lifetime of a patient and legally for as long as that complaint action can be brought. Generally in the UK, any recorded information should be kept legally for 7 years, but for medical records additional time must be allowed for any child to reach the age of responsibility (20 years). Medical records are required many years after a patient's death to investigate illnesses within a community (e.g., industrial or environmental disease or even deaths at the hands of doctors committing murders, as in the Harold Shipman case). Abuses The outsourcing of medical record transcription and storage has the potential to violate patient- physician confidentiality by possibly allowing unaccountable persons access to patient data. Falsification of a medical record by a medical professional is a felony in most United States jurisdictions. Governments have often refused to disclose medical records of military personnel who have been used as experimental subjects. Data breaches Given the series of medical data breaches and the lack of public trust, some countries have enacted laws requiring safeguards to be put in place to protect the security and confidentiality of medical information as it is shared electronically and to give patients some important rights to monitor their medical records and receive notification for loss and unauthorized acquisition of health information. The United States and the EU have imposed mandatory medical data breach notifications. Patients' medical information can be shared by a number of people both within the health care industry and beyond. The Health Insurance Portability and Accessibility Act (HIPAA) is a United States federal law pertaining to medical privacy that went into effect in 2003. This law established standards for patient privacy in all 50 states, including the right of patients to access to their own records. HIPAA provides some protection, but does not resolve the issues involving medical records privacy.Privacy Rights Clearinghouse - Medical Privacy Information Medical and health care providers experienced 767 security breaches resulting in the compromised confidential health information of 23,625,933 patients during the period of 2006–2012.Privacy Rights Clearinghouse's Chronology of Data Security Breaches. Privacy The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accessibility Act (HIPAA) addresses the issue of privacy by providing medical information handling guidelines.Health and Human Services HIPAA Privacy Rule for health information. Not only is it bound by the Code of Ethics of its profession (in the case of doctors and nurses), but also by the legislation on data protection and criminal law. Professional secrecy applies to practitioners, psychologists, nursing, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nursing assistants, chiropodists, and administrative personnel, as well as auxiliary hospital staff. The maintenance of the confidentiality and privacy of patients implies first of all in the medical history, which must be adequately guarded, remaining accessible only to the authorized personnel. However, the precepts of privacy must be observed in all fields of hospital life: privacy at the time of the conduct of the anamnesis and physical exploration, the privacy at the time of the information to the relatives, the conversations between healthcare providers in the corridors, maintenance of adequate patient data collection in hospital nursing controls (planks, slates), telephone conversations, open intercoms etc. See also * Bioethics * Electronic health record * Hospital information system * Medical history * Medical law * OpenNotes * Patient record access * Right to know * Physical examination * Physician-patient privilege * Midwife * Nursing * Pharmaceutical References External links *Personal Medical Records from MedlinePlus *American Health Information Management Association *Medical Record Privacy - Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) Organizations dealing with medical records *ASTM Continuity of Care Record - a patient health summary standard based upon XML, the CCR can be created, read and interpreted by various EHR or Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems, allowing easy interoperability between otherwise disparate entities. *American Health Information Management Association Category:Health informatics Category:Public records ","title":"Medical record"},{"id":"1107043","text":"The Archaic or Early Dynastic Period of Egypt (also known as Thinite Period, from Thinis, the supposed hometown of its rulersNicolas Grimal, A History of Ancient Egypt. Blackwell Publishing, 1992, p. 49) is the era immediately following the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt c. 3100 BC. It is generally taken to include the First and Second Dynasties, lasting from the end of the Naqada III archaeological period until about 2686 BC, or the beginning of the Old Kingdom. With the First Dynasty, the capital moved from Thinis to Memphis with a unified Egypt ruled by an Egyptian god-king. Abydos remained the major holy land in the south. The hallmarks of ancient Egyptian civilization, such as art, architecture and many aspects of religion, took shape during the Early Dynastic Period. Before the unification of Egypt, the land was settled with autonomous villages. With the early dynasties, and for much of Egypt's history thereafter, the country came to be known as the Two Lands. The pharaohs established a national administration and appointed royal governors. The buildings of the central government were typically open-air temples constructed of wood or sandstone. The earliest Egyptian hieroglyphs appear just before this period, though little is known of the spoken language they represent. Cultural evolution By about 3600 BC, Neolithic Egyptian societies along the Nile had based their culture on the raising of crops and the domestication of animals.Carl Roebuck, The World of Ancient Times (Charles Scribner's Sons Publishing: New York, 1966) p. 51. Shortly after 3600 BC Egyptian society began to grow and advance rapidly toward refined civilization.Carl Roebuck, The World of Ancient Times (Charles Scribner's Sons: New York, 1966) p. 52-53. A new and distinctive pottery, which was related to the pottery in the Southern Levant, appeared during this time. Extensive use of copper became common during this time. The Mesopotamian process of sun-dried bricks, and architectural building principles—including the use of the arch and recessed walls for decorative effect—became popular during this time. Concurrent with these cultural advances, a process of unification of the societies and towns of the upper Nile River, or Upper Egypt, occurred. At the same time the societies of the Nile Delta, or Lower Egypt also underwent a unification process. Warfare between Upper and Lower Egypt occurred often. During his reign in Upper Egypt, King Narmer defeated his enemies on the Delta and merged both the Kingdom of Upper and Lower Egypt under his single rule.Carl Roebuck, The World of Ancient Times (Charles Scribner's Sons Publishers: New York, 1966), p. 53. Narmer is shown on palettes wearing the double crown, composed of the lotus flower representing Upper Egypt and the papyrus reed representing Lower Egypt - a sign of the unified rule of both parts of Egypt which was followed by all succeeding rulers. In mythology, the unification of Egypt is portrayed as the falcon-god, called Horus and identified with Lower Egypt, as conquering and subduing the god Set, who was identified with Upper Egypt.Carl Roebuck, The World of Ancient Times, p. 53. Divine kingship, which would persist in Egypt for the next three millennia, was firmly established as the basis of Egypt's government. The unification of societies along the Nile has also been linked to the end of the African humid period. Funeral practices for the peasants would have been the same as in predynastic times, but the rich demanded something more. Thus, the Egyptians began construction of the mastabas which became models for the later Old Kingdom constructions such as the Step pyramid. Cereal agriculture and centralization contributed to the success of the state for the next 800 years. It seems certain that Egypt became unified as a cultural and economic domain long before its first king ascended to the throne in the lower Egyptian city of Memphis where the dynastic period did originate. This would last for many centuries. Political unification proceeded gradually, perhaps over a period of a century or so as local districts established trading networks and the ability of their governments to organize agriculture labor on a larger scale increased, divine kingship may also have gained spiritual momentum as the cults of gods like Horus, Set and Neith associated with living representatives became widespread in the country.The Penguin Historical Atlas of Ancient Egypt pg 22-23 (1997) By Bill Manley It was also during this period that the Egyptian writing system was further developed. Initially Egyptian writing had been composed primarily of a few symbols denoting amounts of various substances. By the end of the 3rd dynasty it had been expanded to include more than 200 symbols, both phonograms and ideograms.

This work of art both shows the influence of Mesopotamia on Egypt at an early date, and the state of Mesopotamian royal iconography during the Uruk period. First Pharaoh According to Manetho, the first monarch of the unified Upper and Lower Egypt was Menes, who is now identified with Narmer. Indeed, Narmer is the earliest recorded First Dynasty monarch: he appears first on the necropolis seal impressions of Den and Qa'a.Qa'a and Merneith lists http://xoomer.virgilio.it/francescoraf/hesyra/Egyptgallery03.htmlThe Narmer Catalog http://narmer.org/inscription/1553The Narmer Catalog http://narmer.org/inscription/4048 This shows that Narmer was recognized by the first dynasty kings as an important founding figure. Narmer is also the earliest king associated to the symbols of power over the two lands (see in particular the Narmer Palette, a votive cosmetic palette showing Narmer wearing the crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt) and may therefore be the first king to achieve the unification. Consequently, the current consensus is that \\"Menes\\" and \\"Narmer\\" refer to the same person. Alternative theories hold that Narmer was the final king of the Naqada III period and Hor-Aha is to be identified with \\"Menes\\". Coastal settlements in Palestine Egyptian settlement and colonisation is also attested from about 3200 BC onward in the area of Gaza Strip and the Negev. The town of Tell El Sakan may have been the centre of this settlement.

Their name is derived from the Afrikaans (Dutch) word boer, meaning farmer. Origins and characteristics The Boer goat was probably bred from the indigenous South African goats kept by the Namaqua, San, and Fooku tribes, with some crossing of Indian and European bloodlines being possible. They were selected for meat rather than milk production; due to selective breeding and improvement, the Boer goat has a fast growth rate and excellent carcass qualities, making it one of the most popular breeds of meat goat in the world. Boer goats have a high resistance to disease and adapt well to hot, dry semideserts. United States production is centered in west-central Texas, particularly in and around San Angelo and Menard. The original US breeding stock came from herds located in New Zealand. Only later were they imported directly from Africa Boer goats commonly have white bodies and distinctive brown heads. Some Boer goats can be completely brown or white or paint, which means large spots of a different color are on their bodies. Like the Nubian goat, they possess long, pendulous ears. They are noted for being docile, fast-growing, and having high fertility rates. Does are reported to have superior mothering skills as compared to other breeds. Boer goats tend to gain weight at about the same rate as their sire, so a buck from a proven fast- growing bloodline will command the highest price, as its offspring tend to also be fast growers. The primary market for slaughter goats is a kid; kids should reach marketable size at weaning age. The kid of a proven fast-growing sire might weigh at 90 days, while the kid of a poor-quality sire might weigh only at 90 days. An average-quality buck will initially be less expensive to purchase, but it can significantly undermine an operation's long-term profitability. Due to their versatility on different terrains, Boer goat are frequently used for land maintenance, especially to prevent bush encroachment on rangeland. As typical browsers, the goats are able to suppress re-growth after bush thinning and to browse from plants up to 1.8 meters high, standings on their hind legs. Doe  Does used to breed show-quality goats are normally very large. For commercial meat production, medium-sized does are normally preferred, as they produce the same number of kids, but require less feed to do so. As a general rule, the more kids born per doe, the greater profit margins for the owner. Boer goats are polyestrous (they can breed throughout the year), and they reach sexual maturity at five months of age. A typical breeding program is to produce three kid crops every two years, meaning the does are pregnant for five months, nurse their kids for three months, and then are rebred. Multiple births are common, and a 200% kid crop is achievable in managed herds. Usually, first-time does have one kid, but they may have more. After that, they usually have two kids every other breeding. The kids can be brown, black, white, or mixed.  Crossbreeding  A 7/8 (F3) Boer goat, paint doe While purebred bucks are usually preferred for breeding purposes, crossbred does are commonly used for kid production, with the resulting offspring being 7/8 or more Boer. Common crosses are Boer x Spanish goat, Boer x Angora goat, Boer x Kiko goat, Boer x Nubian goat, Boer x Sirohi, Boer x Osmanabadi, and Boer x Jamnapari goat. An effort to crossbreed with the Malabari goat has been controversial. Percentage Boer goats are very common in commercial meat herds, and with those just starting out in the Boer goat business due to ease of acquisition and affordability. Over time, percentage animals can be bred up to American purebred status. An American purebred is a Boer goat of 15/16ths Boer blood (F4) for does and 31/32nds blood (F5) for Boer bucks. Bucks must be one generation of Boer breeding higher than does to achieve this status because they have the potential to spread their genetic pool much further than any single doe; a higher level of Boer blood lessens the chances of other breed qualities in the offspring. Although American purebreds can never be registered as Fullblood (FB), many breeders still use a good American purebred buck with excellent results. Many producers still prefer purebred or fullblood bucks and does, and intentional crossbreeding is far from universal. Note: The 'F' designation is the commonly used shorthand for indicating the percentage of pure blood (Boer in this case) resulting from crossbreeding of a Pureblood boer buck with does of other breeds: * F1 : 1/2 boer blood (Pureblood buck sire, other breed doe) * F2 : 3/4 boer blood (Pureblood buck sire, F1 doe) * F3 : 7/8 boer blood (Pureblood buck sire, F2 doe) * F4 : 15/16 boer blood (Pureblood buck sire, F3 doe) * F5 : 31/32 boer blood (Pureblood buck sire, F4 doe)  Show goats  Although Boer goats raised specifically for show purposes may seem to have little in common with pastured commercial goats, the difference is superficial. They are bred to be larger than normal goats, and meet specific visual appearances, but these very characteristics are valuable genes to add to the commercial herd. Boer goats were originally imported into the US and other countries for this very reason. Their value to ranchers lies in the improvement the addition of their unique genes can offer any breed of goats being raised for meat. Few producers could afford to maintain a herd of essentially useless animals. Show goats are bred to represent the most desirable characteristics of the Boer goat, and their main purpose is to introduce these animals to the public. It is also a method of recognizing the best of the best, although some really superior goats are not shown preference. Bucks and does bred for show can be and often are used for commercial breeding stock.Bowman, Gail, Raising Meat Goats for Profit 0967038103 To show, most Boer goats have to be registered with either the CMGA, ABGA, IBGA, or USBGA. Though Boer goats are often bred to be shown, they can also make very good pets.

It co-stars Tony Award-winning actress and dancer Ann Reinking as Micki and Amy Irving as Maude. With the exception of appearances as herself, as in the documentary Mad Hot Ballroom in 2005, this has been Reinking's last film role as of 2019. The film co-stars Wallace Shawn and includes two scenes with wrestler André the Giant in which he is introduced by his own name. Unlike their later roles in 1987's The Princess Bride, the two do not appear together onscreen. This film was remade in Tamil as Rettai Vaal Kuruvi starring Mohan, Archana, and Rathika Sarathkumar, and directed by Balu Mahindra. It was also remade in Malayalam as Paavakoothu (1990) starring Jayaram, Parvathy and Ranjini. Plot Rob Salinger (Dudley Moore) is an overworked television reporter. He is happily married to Micki (Ann Reinking), a lawyer who is a candidate to become a judge. Rob wants a child badly, but Micki is reluctant due to a previous miscarriage and wanting to focus on her career. On an assignment, Rob interviews a young cellist, Maude Guillory (Amy Irving). He is smitten with her and begins a relationship with her. When she becomes pregnant, the two decide to get married, with Maude and her father, professional wrestler Barkhas Guillory (Hard Boiled Haggerty) planning the wedding. Rob prepares to confess to Micki and get a divorce. But before he can reveal his affair with Maude, Micki stuns him by announcing that she, too, is pregnant. She confesses that she initially planned on having an abortion as pregnancy would interfere with her career and not tell him, but realized how much she wants to have a family with him. However, she cannot exert or stress herself too much as it would endanger her and the baby. Rob becomes a bigamist. With his television boss and best friend Leo (Richard Mulligan) covering for him, he sees one wife during the daytime and the other at night, using work as an excuse. He gets away with it until the fates collide: Micki and Maude going into labor at the same time, in the same hospital, on the same floor. The two women end up becoming friends, but realizing that Rob had been dishonest with them, they ban Rob from their lives and the lives of the children. Rob follows them around, spying on both families from a distance. Eventually, Rob reconciles with both Micki and Maude, though it is not clear if the two women are aware he has reconciled with the other. The film ends with the women pursuing their careers: Micki as a judge presiding in a courtroom, Maude playing cello in a symphony orchestra. The film closes with a shot of Rob in a park years later, with two babies and his six other children he has had over the years with Micki and Maude.

At the time of testing, the Operation Hardtack I test series included more nuclear detonations than the total of all prior nuclear explosions in the Pacific Ocean. These tests followed the Project 58/58A series, which occurred from 1957 December 6 to 1958, March 14, and preceded the Operation Argus series, which took place in 1958 from August 27 to September 6. Operation Hardtack I was directed by Joint Task Force 7 (JTF 7). JTF-7 was a collaboration between the military and many civilians, but was structured like a military organization. Its 19,100 personnel were composed of members of the US military, federal civilian employees, as well as workers affiliated with the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). There were three main research directions. The first was the development of new types of nuclear weapons. This was undertaken by detonating experimental devices created by the AEC's Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory and the University of California Radiation Laboratory (UCRL). The DOD performed experiments and tests on these detonations that did not hamper the AEC's research. The second research direction was to examine how underwater explosions affected materiel, especially Navy ships, and was performed by the DOD. The Wahoo test was conducted in the open ocean, whereas Umbrella was in a lagoon. The final avenue of study was to analyze high-altitude nuclear tests to refine the detection of high-altitude nuclear tests and investigate defensive practices for combatting ballistic missiles. This research direction was composed of three individual tests and were the first high-altitude tests. The individual tests in the series were Orange, Teak, and Yucca. Orange and Teak were known collectively as Operation Newsreel and were rocket boosted. Yucca reached its altitude utilizing balloons. Aerial shot of the explosion during Hardtack I Poplar Historical background Many events and proceedings leading up to Operation Hardtack I, such as previous nuclear testing results and the global political atmosphere, influenced its creation and design. One such historical circumstance was that nuclear radiation concerns were mounting publicly and abroad by 1956. During the 1956 Presidential Election, ending nuclear testing was a campaign issue and nuclear safety was one part of that discussion. At the same time, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was publicly proposing a moratorium on testing. In 1956 during June, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) recommended new radiation exposure limits for the general public in a report entitled: \\"The Biological Effects of Atomic Radiation\\". The AEC, which was the body that developed nuclear weapons, accepted the NAS recommended radiation exposure limits. Some AEC members asserted that the limits were reached incorrectly and should be reviewed in the future. Charles L. Dunham, AEC Director of the Division of Biology and Medicine (DBM), said that the new limits of nuclear radiation exposure would prevent them from continuing testing in Nevada. Dunham, in association with other AEC offices and officials, made recommendations to move further tests to the Pacific to eliminate the need to determine radiological fallout safety. Also in 1956, the AEC was designing a test series that included nuclear detonations which would release significant amounts of nuclear fallout. The series came to be known as Operation Plumbbob and took place in 1957 from April 24 to October 7. Operation Plumbbob was followed by Project 58/58A and Operation Hardtack I, respectively. At the time of testing, Operation Plumbbob was the most extensive nuclear test series held at the Nevada Test Site. President Eisenhower was very cautious in approving Plumbbob due to public concern. Consequently, the AEC held brief and ultimately fruitless discussions of moving some of the tests in the Plumbbob series to the next planned Pacific Ocean series, Operation Hardtack I, to minimize radioactive fallout in and around the Nevada Test Site. When Operation Plumbbob began in the spring of 1957, the planning process of Operation Hardtack I was well underway and the number of nuclear detonations planned were more than those in the Plumbbob series. At the same time, radiation and nuclear proliferation concerns around the world had led to formal discussions between the US, USSR, and other countries on the topic of instituting a global ban on nuclear testing as a path to disarmament. In 1957 on August 9 AEC chairman Lewis L. Strauss proposed to President Eisenhower a preliminary plan of Operation Hardtack I. President Eisenhower objected to the length of the four-month testing period and that the plan called for 25 shots, which was one more than in Plumbbob. As a result of the discussion, Eisenhower consented to yields no larger than 15 megatons, and ordered that the testing period be as brief as possible. Project 58/58A followed Operation Plumbbob and began almost two months later starting in 1957 on December 6. Project 58/58A was composed of four safety tests; they were not supposed to result in nuclear radiation. All four took place at the Nevada Test Site. The safety tests were intended to ensure that the bombs would not malfunction. However, the test named Coulomb-C which took place in 1957 on December 9 did malfunction. It resulted in an unanticipated 500-ton blast. The blast released a nuclear radiation fallout cloud that traveled toward Los Angeles and resulted in low levels of nuclear radiation. The bomb failure added to public concern over nuclear testing's safety. Some tests were cut in an effort to meet Eisenhower's demands for a shorter testing period, but new tests quickly filled their place. AEC chairman Strauss remarked that the large number of shots was due to the \\"DOD's requirement for an increasing number of different nuclear weapons types\\". Eisenhower eventually approved the plan for Operation Hardtack I in late January, even though it still contained 25 shots. On March 31 1958, the USSR announced a suspension of all tests and called on the US to do the same. On May 9 the leader of the Soviet Union, Nikita Khrushchev, accepted Eisenhower's invitation for technical discussions on a nuclear testing moratorium and negotiations began on July 1 of the same year. Eisenhower announced to the US on August 22, 1958, that the ban would begin October 31. US scientists responded by seeking to add more tests to the Hardtack Series in case it turned out to be the last chance. Consequently Operation Hardtack I consisted of 35 tests. There was public health concern with the number of shots in Operation Hardtack I. Studies released in March of 1958 indicated that people as far as away could have severe retinal burns from two of the three high-altitude tests: Teak and Orange. It was then decided that they would be moved to Johnston Island, which was from the nearest inhabited island. The high-altitude nuclear tests delivered the first openly reported man-made high-altitude electromagnetic pulses (EMP). Teak, which was detonated at and was 3.8 megatons, produced an aurora-like effect that was visible from Hawaii, 700 nautical miles (806 miles, 1297 kilometers) displaced from the detonation. Most radio communications immediately dropped across the Pacific Ocean. The blackout in Australia lasted for 9 hours and Hawaii's lasted for no less than 2 hours.  High-altitude tests  Operation Hardtack I contained three high-altitude tests that were designed to study many effects that a nuclear explosion would have on materials and electronic systems. They were also used to test the energy of the explosion and what forms of energy they would produce. Yucca was the name of the first high-altitude test and it was performed near the Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The other two high-altitude tests, Orange and Teak, were performed near the Johnston Atoll in the South Pacific Ocean about 1,300 kilometers southwest of the Hawaiian Islands.  Impact on ozone layer  There was some uncertainty on whether detonating a nuclear weapon at such high altitudes would cause a hole in the ozone layer. After multiple underwater tests there was evidence to show the energy created by the blast would create ozone. Project leads determined some destruction of ozone would occur which would then be replaced by the ozone created from the explosion. It was agreed that if this theory were wrong, the hole created in the ozone layer would be minuscule enough to cause no harm. Upon completion of Operation Newsreel, it was determined that there was very little evidence of any harm being caused to the natural ozone layer.  Yucca  Yucca was the first high-altitude test performed during Operation Hardtack I and was detonated on April 28, 1958. It was lifted by a balloon to an altitude of and had a yield of 1.7 kilotons.To achieve the altitude needed, the device was attached to a large helium-filled balloon which carried it to the detonation altitude. Due to issues with high winds on Enewetak Island, the balloon launches from ground were unsatisfactory, thus creating the need for a new method. The balloons were then deployed from an aircraft carrier which helped with deployment and the inflation. While the balloons were inflated, they were unable to take too much force from wind or the plastic material of the balloons would tear. While the balloons were inflating on the aircraft carrier, the ship could match and oppose the wind speed allowing for the balloon to be inflated in still air. To make sure the launch would be successful 86 balloon launches were tested. Due to concerns of failures, many safety measures were employed. While on ground, the bomb used multiple pins to prevent certain safety features of the bomb from being deployed before liftoff. One such pin was used to stop the electrical systems so that the bomb would be unable to be armed. In case of a dud, the bomb would detach from the balloon and be allowed to drop into the ocean where many more safety features would come into action. Some of these features included probes which could detect saltwater which would destroy the electrical system so the conductive seawater could not cause a short which would detonate the bomb. Another concern was a nuclear device floating in the ocean should a misfire occur. To combat this, inserts were created which would dissolve in a few hours, thus scuttling the device. On the day of the launch many meteorological aspects were taken into account and calculations were done to ensure the bomb would reach the correct altitude. The bomb was loaded onto an aircraft carrier and preparations began. As the balloon was inflated multiple testing devices were connected to the balloon. The readings from these devices would be sent to multiple ships and aircraft so nothing would need to be recovered after the explosion. After all the preparations were done and the balloon was inflated, the device was released and began to climb. After almost three and a half hours of climbing the bomb was detonated at an altitude of . The aircraft carrier which carried Yucca was approximately from the detonation site. The shock wave from Yucca reached the carrier 3 minutes and 16 seconds after detonation. The Yucca test had many Department of Defense projects attached to it for research purposes. Alongside testing the use of a balloon carrier, the Department of Defense wanted to research the electromagnetic waves emitted from a nuclear explosion. This test would be used to determine the impact a nuclear explosion would have on electronic devices. All of the data from these Department of Defense projects would be stored on recording devices on surrounding islands and in aircraft so data would not have to be recovered after the test. However, Yucca was carrying five different transmitting devices in canisters to help with research. While the balloon proved to be a great success, no data from the canisters were able to be retrieved due to equipment issues onboard one of the aircraft carriers.  Teak  The Teak test was launched from Johnston Island on July 31, 1958 and carried a payload of 3.8 megatons. Teak was the second high-altitude test after the success of Yucca. Instead of a balloon, the warhead for the Teak test would be carried by a Redstone missile; a modified Redstone missile had been used to launch Explorer I in January of the same year. Other nuclear weapons had been tested using the Redstone missile, but until this time the highest payload to have been detonated was 3 kilotons during Operation Teapot. Teak would be the first high-altitude test to have a payload in the megaton range. The test was scheduled to take place from the Bikini Atoll. Due to the fact that the payloads of Teak and Orange were much larger than previous high-altitude shots, the test was moved to Johnston Island as to protect nearby native islanders from any retinal damage. As both Teak and Orange had been relocated these two tests were named Operation Newsreel. The name Newsreel came from the fact that these two tests were being moved to Johnston Island. The safety precautions taken by the teams involved were precisely detailed. The day before the launch 187 team members would evacuate Johnston Island with 727 men the day of the test. This was to keep as few men on the island while still being able to operate the airfield and critical data instruments. Another problem the team members were concerned about was the issue of retinal damage. Since the payload of the bomb was so large, aircraft were scheduled to keep any civilian ships out of a radius of Johnston Island. Additionally, the Civil Aeronautics Authority was informed that it would be dangerous for any aircraft to fly within of Johnston Island. On the day of the test only about 175 men remained on Johnston Island to prepare for Teak to be launched and other various duties needed after. At 11:47 PM on July 31 Teak was launched; after 3 minutes it was detonated. Due to programming issues, the warhead detonated directly above Johnston Island. At time of detonation the rocket had flown to an altitude of . The explosion could be seen from Hawaii away and was said to be visible for almost half an hour. After the explosion, high frequency long distance communication was interrupted across the Pacific. Due to this communication failure Johnston Island was unable to contact their superiors to advise of the test results until about eight hours after the detonation. Thirty minutes after detonation, a crew was sent out to collect the pod which had detached from the missile carrying the warhead. The pod had been irradiated and to handle it the crew members used disposable gloves in an attempt to protect themselves from beta radiation. During the Teak test all crew on and around Johnston Island were given protective eyewear to prevent flash blindness from the explosion. After the explosion it was found that besides the hazard of blindness, thermal radiation was another concern—even at an altitude of . A crew member who was on Johnston Island at the time was said to have received a slight sunburn from the amount of thermal radiation which had reached the island. While only slight to the crew member it created issues for the local fauna. Many birds were seen on Johnston Island in distress. Unsure if this was caused by blindness or thermal radiation, the project members decided to take precautions to protect local wildlife during the Orange test.  Orange  Orange was launched twelve days after Teak on August 11, 1958. Orange, like Teak, was launched using a Redstone Missile and had a yield of 3.8 megatons. The same safety precautions used by Teak were implemented for the Orange launch. Seeing how smoothly the evacuation for the Teak launch went, it was decided that the evacuation did not need to occur the day before the launch and eight hundred and eight men were evacuated on August 11 to an aircraft carrier about northeast of the island. Along with protection for the project crew, it was decided after Teak that Sand Island, a local bird refuge, would need protection from the blast as well. To make sure that most of the wildlife was safe a smoke screen was created over Sand Island. Due to interest in Hawaii, it was announced on August 11 that there would be a nuclear test sometime between 10 PM and 6 AM. The rocket carrying the warhead was launched at 11:27 from Johnston Island and traveled south. Like Teak, the flight lasted 3 minutes and was detonated at 11:30 PM about south of Johnston Island at an altitude of about .The trajectory of Orange was a major success after the incident with Teak being detonated directly over the island. The recovery crew for the pod that was with Orange was unable to locate the research pod which had been launched with the rocket. Although Orange was visible from Hawaii it was not the great spectacle Teak had been. The light from the blast was visible for about 5 minutes. The explosion had also been slightly obscured to the crew at Johnston Island by cloud coverage. The blast from Orange did not cause the large communication interruption that Teak had caused, but some commercial flights to Hawaii were said to have lost contact with air traffic controllers for a short period of time.  Surface tests  Of the 35 nuclear tests in Operation Hardtack I, four were surface burst shots: Cactus, Koa, Quince and Fig. These tests took place from May to August 1958, all at the Enewetak Atoll. Surface tests inherently present the potential for more radioactive exposure issues than the high-altitude or underwater detonations. This is because there is more material present to be converted to radioactive debris by excess neutrons due to the proximity to the Earth's surface, and due to the soil and other minerals excavated from the craters created by these blasts. The existence of this extra material allows for larger radioactive particles to be created and lifted into the blast cloud, falling back to the surface as fallout.Though surface and near-surface tests have a higher probability of radioactive exposure problems, the radioactive elements have significantly shorter residence times when injected into the atmosphere. As radioactive clouds from surface-type tests reach heights of around at maximum, and thus cannot extend higher than the lower stratosphere, the residence times can be up to 13 years less than the high- altitude blasts. During original concept planning in 1954, Enewetak was supposed to be the location of the smaller tests conducted during Operation Hardtack I. Due to poor weather conditions and policy changes in 1958, five of the UCRL tests which were planned to be conducted at the Bikini Atoll were moved to Enewetak. This included the later two surface blast devices in the Quince and Fig tests.  Cactus  Operation Hardtack I Cactus shot Crater on Runit Island The Cactus test took place May 6, 1958 at approximately 0615. An 18 Kiloton land-surface type shot was detonated on a platform at the northern tip of Runit, Enewetak in the second of the 35 tests for Operation Hardtack I.The initial cloud from the explosion reached as high as within the first ten minutes, and settled at around by 20 minutes after detonation. The nuclear fallout prediction map proved to be accurate in determining the span and the intensity of the resultant fallout.Measured peak intensity of fallout reached 440 R at hour three directly above blast site on the North end of the Atoll. At mid-island the radiation was measured to be 1.7 R. The southern tip received a very small amount of radiation, 0.005 R due to the easterly winds. Out of the eight Programs listed, DOD-affiliated Projects 1.4, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.12, 2.8, 3.2, 5.2, 5.3, 6.4, 6.5 and 6.6 involved the Cactus test. One of the goals of this test was to study the physical characteristics of the crater and the surrounding area pre- and post-detonation associated with Project 1.4. A camera was mounted to a RB-50 aircraft and the resultant crater was mapped using photogrammetry. Measurements were taken from down to ground zero for both pre- and post detonation. Survey measurements of the Cactus test could not be made until the resultant radiation amounts had lowered to safer levels. Along with photogrammetric radial measurements, Airblast measurements were also recorded near surface zero for Cactus in accordance with Project 1.7. Similar to Project 1.8, Project 1.9 sought to determine transmission of blast pressure through the ground soil. Forty-three drums were buried at varying depths 600 feet (183 meters) from ground zero of the Cactus detonation. Individuals from the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division – TRW Space Technologies Laboratory sought to the Shock Spectra Studies of Project 1.12. Measurement gauges were located between from the blast site. Fallout measurements and samples were taken by aircraft in the aftermath of the detonation, as part of Project 2.8. These surveys were designed in part to determine the impact of specific radionuclides to overall nuclear fallout. Samples were taken early post-blast using a new rocket sampler, the UCRL, which were then followed by B-57D and WB-50 aircraft. Between four and twenty- four hours post-detonation, the WB-50 collected several samples at in altitude. Project 3.2 involved structural tests of corrugated steel arches. One of these arches was placed 980 feet (299 meters) away from the Cactus blast site. Eight days after the test, a crew of 13 men were allowed near the surface zero in order to extract the arch. The extraction took around twelve hours, and the radioactivity levels reached a maximum at 0.420 R/h during this time. Project 5.2 sought to determine the effects of the blast on two A4D-1 aircraft, both in thermal radiation and pressure. Nine film badges were placed throughout each aircraft in order to measure radiation. The Gamma dosimeter worn by the pilot in aircraft 827 indicated a neutron exposure level of 0.105 rem. There is not information available for the dosimeter worn by the pilot in aircraft 831. Radiation recorded by six of the nine film badges ranged from 0.49-1.74R. Information from the remaining three film badges, located at the Pilot's right leg, left sleeve, and left vest is not available. The pilot's exposures were both greater than 3R. Project 5.3 was very similar to 5.2, focusing on the effects of the blast on the structure of two test FJ-4 aircraft. Radiation from film badges on aircraft 467 ranged from 0.52-3.71 R, and 1.23-5.06 R for aircraft number 310. In Project 6.4, the Army Signal Research and Development Laboratory (SRDL) investigated the electromagnetic pulses post-detonation, utilizing two instruments, one at Wotho (roughly 240 nautical miles from Enewetak) and one at Kusaie (around 440 nautical miles from Enewetak). Though Cactus is mentioned in Project 6.5, whose goal was to study the radar echoes from the fireball, it is not clear what destroyers were involved if any. Destroyers for the Teak, Fir and Yucca tests are explicitly stated. Project 6.6, the lasts of the projects that involved the Cactus test, sought to measure the physical properties of the stabilized radioactive cloud following the blast.  Koa  At 0630 on May 13, the Koa surface device was detonated at the western side of Dridrilbwij. The size of the blast was 1.37 MT, around 76 times larger than the yield of the previous surface test, Cactus. The test was conducted in a large water tank. Within 17 minutes of the blast, surface clouds reached approximately . Nuclear fallout predictions for Koa were larger and covered a broader range than Cactus, with significantly higher radiation levels, an order of magnitude larger, in the immediate region surrounding the blast. There had been a larger nuclear barge detonation, the 1.85 MT Apache test, off the island of Dridrilbwij two years prior in 1956, during which the island survived.Military Effects on Operation REDWING : AFSWP and Joint Task Force 7 : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive. (n.d.). Retrieved April 17, 2016, from https://archive.org/details/MilitaryEffectsonOperationRedwing1956 The detonation of the Koa device, however, caused complete destruction of the island. The Department of Defense (DOD) sponsored a series of experiments for Koa: Projects 1.4, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.12, 2.9, 3.2, 3.6, 5.1, 5.3. 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.9. and 6.11. Project 1.4, which sought to study land craters post detonation for several shots, took ground survey measurements from surface zero out to . Detailed measurements could not be made until four days after the blast due to radiation levels. Using a boat, the majority of the crater was mapped, though some measurements could not be made until 1959 due to radioactivity levels around the Koa blast site. In Project 1.9, the blast- induced pressure through the soil was measured by burying 43 drums at depths ranging from 0 to 20 feet and around feet from the Koa blast site. The early radioactive cloud samples, normally collected post-shot as a part of Project 2.8 using a UCRL rocket sampler, were not collected after the Koa test due to technical difficulties. Fallout at high and low altitudes utilizing B-57D and WB-50 aircraft were measured with no technical problems. Project 3.6, which was conducted only on Koa, tested the effects of the blast on reinforced- concrete slabs buried close to surface zero. One station was located at from the blast site, and the other was located away. Project 5.2 was designed to measure the radiation levels using film badges on different areas of the aircraft and on the pilot directly. Koa had the lowest average radiation measurements of the eight shots on this project, with aircraft 827 ranging from 0.01-0.02R and aircraft 831 reporting levels between 0.03-0.19R. Unlike in the Cactus test, all nine film badges from both aircraft were successfully recovered and reported.  Quince and Fig  Quince and Fig were a series of surface shots that occurred in early August at the center of Runit. They were the last of the Hardtack tests conducted at the Enewetak Atoll. Quince was detonated at 2:15pm on August 6, 1958. Twelve days later, the Fig device was detonated on August 18, 1958 at 4:00pm. Quince and Fig were UCRL devices with co-sponsorship through the DOD and the AEC, though the main focus of these tests was weapons development. One of the main differences between these two tests was that over 130 tons of soil from the Nevada Test Site had been shipped in and was placed at surface zero of the Fig test. The radioactive cloud from the Quince blast rose to . As Runit was to also be the detonation site for Fig, the area had to be decontaminated after the Quince test. Around three to five inches of contaminated topsoil was removed from an area 75 feet by 25 feet upwind of ground zero. An area of 60 square feet at the blast site was scraped to remove the top three inches of soil as well. Even with these precautions, the measured alpha activity was around 20,000 counts per minute (CPM), and the area closest to surface zero was roped off to prevent personnel from entering. Upon detonation, the mushroom cloud produced by the Fig device rose to approximately , with a base of roughly . 30 minutes post detonation, radiation measurements at the blast site reached over 10,000 R/hr. The DOD experiments for Quince and Fig included Projects 1.4, 1.7. 2.4, 2.9, 2.10, 2.11, 2.14. and 8.7.  Barge tests  Barge mounted test detonations was a technique first used in 1954, and also compensated for the lack of land at the HP. When testing returned to Bikini atoll the use of barges as the shot point had begun, with one notable advantage, no radioactive surface zero areas were developed. Two large underwater craters were formed in 1954 and these were used as subsequent surface zeros for detonations fired from barges. This allowed the available land area to be used for the placement of measurement instrumentation and reuse of the same burst point without the long delays required for radiological cooling by natural decay or expensive and long decontamination procedures. Reuse of zero points also allowed reuse of instrument locations and recording shelters for several tests saving construction costs and time and Increasing test-scheduling flexibility. In HARDTACK the 26 barge events used only five detonation areas. Fir FIR predicted fallout, surface radiological exclusion (radex) areas, ship position, and aircraft participation. FIR was the first Bikini detonation of the Hardtack series. Detonated at 0550 on May 12, 1958. FIR was detonated on a barge in the BRAVO crater, producing a 1.36 Mt yield range. After detonation, the cloud rose to . The FIR detonation was shortly followed by BUTTERNUT detonation on Enewetak 25 minutes later. DOD-sponsored experiments for FIR included Projects 3.7, 5.1, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6 and 6.11. Butternut BUTTERNUT predicted fallout, surface radiological exclusion areas (radex), ship positions, and aircraft participation. Butternut was detonated at 0615 on May 12, 1958, 25 minutes after FIR had been detonated at Enewetak. BUTTERNUT was detonated on a barge west of Runit, producing a yield range of 81 kt.

The only DOD-sponsored experiment for POPLAR was Project 3.7. Scaevola SCAEVOLA predicted fallout, surface radiological exclusion (radex) area, ship positions, and aircraft participation. Scaevola was detonated on July 14, 1958 at 1600. Scaevola was detonated on a barge west of Runit Island at Enewetak. Its yield was low and the explosion did not destroy the shot barge but only damaged it, producing a 0 kt yield range. No DOD-sponsored experiments were scheduled for Scaevola. Pisonia PISONIA predicted fallout, surface radiological exclusion (radex) area, ship positions, and aircraft participation. PISONIA was detonated on July 18, 1958 at 1100. PISONIA was detonated on a barge west of Runit Island at Enewetak. The cloud rose immediately to , and produced a 255 kt yield range. No DOD-sponsored experiments were scheduled for PISONIA. Juniper JUNIPER predicted fallout, surface radiological exclusion (radex) area, ship positions, and aircraft participation. JUNIPER, the last nuclear detonation to occur at Bikini, was detonated on July 22, 1958 at 1620. JUNIPER was detonated on a barge from the west end of Eneman in the ZUINI crater at Bikini . The detonation cloud rose to with an estimated base, and produced a 65 kt yield range. No DOD-sponsored experiments were scheduled for JUNIPER. Olive OLIVE predicted fallout, surface radiological exclusion (radex) area, ship positions, and aircraft participation. OLIVE was detonated on July 23, 1958 at 0830. OLIVE was detonated on a barge southwest of Enjebi Island, at Enewetak Atoll. from the nearest land at Enewetak. The cloud rose to with an estimated base, and produced a 202 kt yield range. No DOD-sponsored experiments were scheduled for OLIVE. Pine PINE predicted fallout, surface radiological exclusion (radex) area, ship positions, and aircraft participation. PINE was detonated on July 27, 1958 at 0830. PINE was detonated on a barge southwest of Enjebi Island, 8,500 feet (2.59 km) from the nearest land, at Enewetak. The cloud rose quickly to with an estimated base as measured by radar, and produced a 2 Mt yield range. No DOD-sponsored experiments were scheduled for PINE.  Underwater tests  Underwater tests were conducted to assess the damages to Navy boats and materials. The location for these tests was Enewetak due to the uniformity of the sea bottom in the area. This is critical for the tests so that proper moorings of the target ships can be secured on the sea floor. The underwater explosions create a bubble from the expended energy of the blast. This bubble is due to the vaporization of water that directly absorbs the heat of the blast. This bubble may break the surface depending on how much energy is dispersed and the depth of the nuclear device. The bubble displaces large amounts of water that then collapses in on the bubble after all the energy is expended. The water collapsing in on the cavity is called the \\"radioactive pool\\" and has the highest concentration of radioactive material. Many different projects were put in place to test the two underwater blasts. Wave generation, hydrodynamic variables, and energy released were all studied using multiple sensors. These sensors were placed in multiple areas such as target ships and floating balloons. Oceanographic, seismographic and hydrographic surveys were completed after each nuclear blast. A project that used a nuclear blast to clear minefields was studied using the Umbrella blast. 120 inert mines were placed at different distances ranging from . These mines were then picked out of the water to study the effects of the blast at each interval.  Radiation preparations  Another reason for underwater tests was to detect radiation contamination of ships after an underwater nuclear explosion. This meant that the contaminated ships required unique \\"radsafe\\" preparations so that the data could be quickly accounted for. After the data on the damage and radiation was recorded, the ships needed decontamination work completed before repairs could be completed. The Radiological and Decontamination Unit consisting of 200 enlisted and one officer was created for the task of decontamination. After decontamination, the target ships were repaired for use in a second underwater nuclear weapons test. The amount of radiation exposure was debated for the safety of the crews. Roentgens (1 R = ca 0,01 Gy in soft tissue) were used to gauge the gamma radiation that affected the units working on the nuclear tests. For the underwater test crew, a limit of 5 R per blast along with 10 R per operation was referenced as the limit for exposure. These initial limits were rejected and maximum permissible exposure standards (MPE) were solidified by commanders for the crews working on the decontamination unit. Due to the fast recovery of ships, high contamination values were expected by commanders and set the standard to four roentgens per hour (R/hr). An excess of 4 R/hr was designated off limits of recovery units. Personnel were given special breathing equipment to work in the interior of ships with an R/hr higher than one. High numbers of personnel working the tests were used to keep individuals within the MPE. Times were calculated to keep the total exposure below two roentgens for the personnel working on the ships. A floating decontamination facility was created on board a transport ship for the Wahoo and Umbrella nuclear tests. This allowed important data analysis and an increase in recovery efficiency.  Wahoo preparation  The nuclear explosion was carried out in open ocean outside of Enewetak. This nuclear test codenamed Wahoo was the first underwater test in the Operation Hardtack series. This test could be considered a continuation of the Wigwam nuclear blast (a deep water nuclear test off the coast of San Diego). Like its predecessor, the Wahoo shot was a scientific program that studied the effects of an underwater nuclear blast on Navy systems. The nuclear device was positioned deep in the Pacific Ocean. This deep water test required precise targeting arrays to be set up around the blast location, which presented unique problems for the arrays as the winds, sea currents and tides needed to be within certain limits for the data to be accurate. Testing arrays were placed at depths of 400 to 800 fathoms (2400 to 4800 feet, 732 to 1463 meters) around the nuclear device. The deep water mooring systems needed for the test proved to be difficult to position, leading many analysts to believe the data skewed. The target ships to be used for this program consisted of three destroyers, an active submarine, a submarine mockup used in Wigwam tests, and a merchant marine ship. It was predicted that no air blast or thermal effects would be presented from the underwater blast. The fallout from the blast was also predicted to stay within the target array due to the southwest surface winds.  Wahoo blast  The test conditions were met on May 16 allowing for the nuclear device to be detonated. Within a second of detonation, a spray dome was created that reached a height of after seven seconds. The overall shape of the spray dome resembled a cone with 45 degree sloped sides. Plumes were seen breaking through the spray dome after six seconds in every direction. The vertical plume continued rising until 12 seconds after the blast while the lateral plumes traveled for 20 seconds before collapsing. The diameter of the spray dome was approximately at the 20 second mark. The base surge reached a radius of in the downwind direction after 1.7 seconds. The downwind surge aided by a 15 knot wind reached speeds of 21 knots (24.2 mph). This base surge could be seen for three and a half minutes and for longer from the air as it continued to move across the ocean. When the spray dome and base surge had dissipated, a foam patch could be seen spreading from the surface zero water to reach over . The nuclear blast was calculated to be nine kilotons. All fallout stayed within the predicted fallout area with a maximum of 0.030 R/hr. The target ship at was directly hit by the shockwave, vibrating the entire ship and shaking it violently. The Moran merchant marine ship moored at away was immobilized due to shock damage to its main and auxiliary equipment while also suffering minor hull damage. One hour and ten minutes after detonation, a five-gallon water sample was taken directly above the blast location showing 5 R/hr. The retrieval team entered a 3.8 R/hr field after an hour and thirty five minutes.  Umbrella preparation  The second underwater explosion of the Operation Hardtack series was code-named Umbrella. This test was conducted in the lagoon inside Enewetak. This test could be considered a continuation of underwater test Baker, which was conducted in Bikini Lagoon. Explosions in shallow water can create an underwater crater if close enough to the bottom. The target ships from the Wahoo test were towed into the lagoon to be used again for the Umbrella test. The damage from Wahoo was minor in all cases with the exception of the Moran which required extra refurbishing of the hull. These ships had to be washed down and have the measuring equipment replaced before being put into use. The mooring for Umbrella was considerably easier than for Wahoo due to the location and depth of the lagoon. Information gathered from the Wahoo shot directly affected the Umbrella plans with regard to target array placement and decontamination times. The device was placed with a buoy at a depth of .  Umbrella blast  June 9 saw the second underwater nuclear test of the Hardtack I series. The detonation occurred at 11:15 AM (local time) with clear skies and a 15 to 17-knot wind from the east-northeast. Within one-tenth of a second, the spray dome had broken through the surface. The overall shape of the spray dome resembled a vertical column with the plumes helping create the shape. Within 20 seconds of detonation, the maximum height of the column reached . The base surge reached a distance around downwind, reaching out approximately in all directions. This base surge could be seen from the air for about 25 minutes and the foam patch over the blast location lasting even longer. The blast yield of the nuclear device was measured to be eight kilotons. The Umbrella blast created a crater in diameter and in depth in the lagoon. The maximum radiation reading was found to be 0.350 R/hr by an aircraft flying over the blast location. Radiation was reported to be of small portions, and re-entry was granted 30 minutes after detonation. Out of the major target ships, the highest radiation reading was logged at 0.0015 R/hr of the stern of the Moran. After all scientific data had been gathered from the target ships, they were restored to be seaworthy and towed back to Pearl Harbor. The Moran was concluded to be unseaworthy due to the blast and was sunk by naval gunfire near Ikuren Island. The underwater nuclear tests (Wahoo and Umbrella) gathered scientific data that helped the Department of Defense understand the effects of nuclear weapons on Navy ships. Some of the key points found were that underwater nuclear blasts create less fallout due to the absorption of radioactive material in the water and vaporized droplets. Direct gamma radiation was found to be extremely low, but the base surge was found to be highly radioactive as it passed measurement devices. Smaller radiation concentrations followed in waves mimicking the initial base surge. Almost all free-field radiation activity was found to disappear after fifteen minutes allowing for return to normal operations. The impact of shock waves was less than previously expected. The damage from the shockwave was found to be negligible on the destroyers at the ranges tested, but equipment failure from the blast could immobilize the ships. The preliminary tests of explosive tapered charges were proven to simulate the shock waves of a nuclear device according to the data gathered. { |+ United States' Hardtack I series tests and detonations |- !style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\" Name The US, France and Great Britain have code-named their test events, while the USSR and China did not, and therefore have only test numbers (with some exceptions - Soviet peaceful explosions were named).

A hard deadline for testing was set at midnight (0000 hrs), October 31, 1958, as negotiations were set to start that day, and the schedule shows it, with 29 tests executed in October, four of them on the last day. One other test was cancelled because weather delays postponed it across the midnight deadline.

Events The tribe's annual powwow is held in Oklahoma during the first weekend of September and features contest dancing, gourd dancing, and a social stomp dance.Community: Annual Pow-wow. Wyandotte Nation of Oklahoma. 2008 (retrieved Feb 8, 2009) History The Wendat, their name for themselves in their language, or Wyandotte, as they came to be called after merging with other related groups, are Iroquoian-speaking Indians from the eastern woodlands. Their name is thought to mean \\"dwellers on a peninsula\\" or \\"islanders.\\"Stansfield, Rick. \\"Wyandotte\\", Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History. 2009 (retrieved Feb 8, 2009) The first Wendat Confederacy was created around 1400 CE, when the Attignawantan (Bear Nation) and Attigingueenongnahac (Cord People) combined forces. They, in turn, were joined by the Arendaronon (People of the Rocks), Ataronchronon (People of One Lodge), and the Tahontaenrat (Deer Nation). At one time scholars believed these peoples to be remnant bands of the St. Lawrence Iroquoians, who established villages located near present-day Montreal visited by early French explorers.History Briefs. Wyandotte Nation of Oklahoma. 2008 (retrieved Feb 8, 2009) But, archeologists have excavated large, 16th-century settlement sites north of Lake Ontario, with extensive evidence leading them to conclude that this was the original site of the coalescence of the Wendat people. They later migrated to the area near Georgian Bay, where they were encountered by French explorers in the early 17th century. French explorers encountered the Wyandotte around 1536 and dubbed them the Huron. They were fierce enemies of the nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, then based in present-day New York. Decimated by smallpox epidemics, the Wendat Confederacy became seriously weakened during the early decades of the early seventeenth century. In 1649, they were defeated by the Iroquois and most migrated southwest for safety, where they settled with Odawa and Illinois tribes. Others moved east into Quebec. Remnants of the associated Wendat and Petun peoples came together as a new group, which became known as the Wyandot of Wyandotte. By the beginning of the 18th century, the Wyandotte people had moved into the Ohio River Valley, extending into areas of what would become West Virginia, Indiana and Michigan. Around 1745, large groups settled near Sandusky, Ohio. After the American Revolution, a treaty signed with the United States in 1785 confirmed their landholdings. However, the 1795 Treaty of Greenville greatly reduced its size. The 1817 Treaty of Fort Meigs reduced the Wyandotte lands drastically, leaving the people only small parcels in Ohio. In 1842, the Wyandotte lost all of their land east of the Mississippi River, under pressure of the United States government policy to remove the Native Americans to the West. They made a treaty with the U.S. government by which they were to be compensated for their lands. They were removed to the Delaware Reservation in present-day Kansas, then considered Indian Territory. During this migration and the early months, their people suffered much illness. In 1843, survivors buried their dead on a high ridge overlooking the Missouri River in what became the Huron Cemetery in present-day Kansas City, Kansas. In 1971 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is now called the Wyandot National Burying Ground. After the American Civil War, Wyandotte people who had not become citizens of the United States in 1855 in Kansas, were removed a final time in 1867 to present-day Oklahoma. They were settled on in the northeast corner of Indian Territory. The Seneca, Shawnee, and Wyandotte Industrial Boarding School, also called the Wyandotte Mission, opened for classes in Wyandotte, Oklahoma in 1872. In 1893, the Dawes Act required that the tribal communal holdings in the Indian Territory be divided into individual allotments. The land was divided among the 241 tribal members listed on the Dawes Rolls. The Wyandotte members in Oklahoma retained some tribal structure, and still had control of the communal property of the Huron Cemetery, by then annexed into Kansas City. Reorganization as a nation In 1937, seizing the opportunity presented by the US Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act of 1934 to regain tribal structure and self-government, the Wyandotte organized themselves into the Wyandotte Nation of Oklahoma, later changing their name to simply Wyandotte Nation, and achieved federal recognition.Federal Register, Volume 73, Number 66 dated April 4, 2008 (73 FR 18553). pdf file (retrieved Feb 26, 2009) The act enabled Native Americans to hold property in common again, and to develop self-government and sovereignty. Termination efforts On 1 August 1956 the US Congress passed Public Law ch. 843, 70 Stat. 893 to terminate the Wyandotte Tribe of Oklahoma as part of the federal Indian termination policy. Three years were allotted for completion of termination. One of the stipulations required that a parcel of land in Kansas City, Kansas, reserved as the Huron Cemetery, which had been awarded to the Wyandot by treaty on 31 January 1855, was to be sold by the United States. Litigation was filed by a group of Absentee Wyandot against the United States and Kansas City, prohibiting the federal government from fulfilling the terms of the termination statute and ultimately preventing termination of the Wyandotte Nation. The Bureau of Land Management records confirm that the Federal Register never published the termination of the Wyandotte lands and thus they were never officially terminated. When Congress restored the other Oklahoma Tribes, it included the Wyandotte in the repeal. On 15 May 1978, in a single Act entitled Public Law 95-281, the termination laws were repealed, and the three tribes were reinstated with all rights and privileges they had prior to termination. Huron Cemetery For decades, the Huron Cemetery was a source of controversy between the Wyandotte Nation of Oklahoma and Wyandot descendants in Kansas. The former wanted to sell the property for redevelopment. Kansas City was also eager for that development, as the city had annexed all of the property in the area. By 1907 it was a prime site; nearby was a new Carnegie Library, the Grund Hotel, and the Masonic Temple under reconstruction after a fire. In 1906, the Wyandotte Nation authorized the Secretary of Interior to sell the cemetery, with the bodies to be reinterred at nearby Quindaro Cemetery. This proposal was opposed by Lyda Conley and her two sisters in Kansas City, who launched what became a multi- year campaign to preserve the burying ground. They achieved much support. In 1916 Senator Charles Curtis of Kansas, who was of partially Native American descent, won passage of a bill protecting the cemetery as a national park and providing some funds for maintenance. Ironically, it was the dispute over this cemetery, that saved the tribe from termination during the 1950s. Over the years, the Wyandotte Nation continued to explore ways to increase revenues for the tribe, including redevelopment of the Huron Cemetery. Descendants in Kansas vigorously resisted these efforts. In 1971, the cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1998, the Wyandotte Nation of Oklahoma and the Wyandot Nation of Kansas reached agreement to preserve the Wyandot National Burying Ground for religious, cultural and related uses appropriate to its sacred history and use. Wendat Confederacy In August 1999, the Wyandotte Nation joined the contemporary Wendat Confederacy, together with the Wyandot Nation of Kansas, Huron-Wendat Nation of Wendake (Quebec), and the Wyandot of Anderdon Nation in Michigan. The tribes pledged to provide mutual aid to each other in a spirit of peace, kinship, and unity.\\"The Wendat Confederacy\\", August 27, 1999, Wyandotte Nation of Oklahoma. 2008 (retrieved Feb 8, 2009) This followed an important meeting of Huronia reconciliation in Midland, Ontario, Canada, attended by representatives of the Iroquois Confederacy, Wyandotte nations, British, French, Dutch, Anglican Church and Catholic Jesuit brothers.

Christopher stabbed Heidi several times, most of which took place outside. He then went to the college to find James. Police received the first phone call just after 9 a.m., and received a second call just minutes later. Heidi was stabbed multiple times. Authorities found signs of defensive wounds on her body. She was found barefoot and still dressed in pajamas in the street outside their home. Christopher arrived at the college with two knives and a compound bow hidden under a blanket. He walked into his father's classroom and shot him in the head with the bow at point blank range. Jim rose up and attacked his son, allowing his students to escape. Not everything is known about their final struggle, but three fellow faculty members tried to intervene. Christopher eventually stabbed himself, leading to his death. Paramedics arrived to find Jim already dead; although Christopher still showed signs of life they were unable to save him. Evidence indicated that Christopher was distressed because he had Asperger's Syndrome, which he blamed his father for giving him, and that he wanted to ensure his father would not give the disorder to anyone else.http://trib.com/news/local/casper/son-kills-father-inside-casper-college- classroom/article_66f20112-3bfb-5815-992f-1e868d9c5e75.html  Notable alumni  *Wayne Hunter (Entomologist) *Chris LeDoux, Country singer and rodeo cowboy *Dick Cheney, Former Vice President of the United States *Earle Higgins Former Professional Basketball Player Indiana Pacers *Bob Lackey Former Professional Basketball Player New York Nets *Flynn Robinson Former Professional Basketball Player Cincinnati Royals, Chicago Bulls, Milwaukee Bucks, Los Angeles Lakers, Baltimore Bullets *Marlan Scully American physicist best known for his work in theoretical quantum optics.

The regiment provided a detachment for operations in the southern colonies as part of Tarleton's Legion, a mixture of infantry and cavalry, and was engaged in a number of battles.Babits, p. 46 The legion, commanded by Banastre Tarleton, was founded in 1778 by Loyalist contingents from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York.Babits & Howard, p. 80 As the attached regular cavalry, the 17th Light Dragoons clung on to an identity separate from the provincials, even refusing to exchange their fading scarlet clothing for the legion's green jackets.Fortescue, p. 63 They sustained heavy losses in the Battle of Cowpens in January 1781 after being ordered by Tarleton to charge a formation of American militia. Although their charge was initially effective, the dragoons, numbering about 50, were quickly surprised and outnumbered by concealed American cavalry, under Colonel William Washington, and driven back in disarray.Babits, p. 125Babits, p. 154-5 During the battle, With the main British infantry surrender and during Tarleton's retreat, Washington was in close pursuit and found himself somewhat isolated. He was attacked by the British commander and two of his men. Tarleton was stopped by Washington himself, who attacked him with his sword, calling out, \\"Where is now the boasting Tarleton?\\" A cornet of the 17th, Thomas Patterson, rode up to strike Washington but was shot by Washington's orderly trumpeter.Historical record of the 17th Light dragoons Washington survived this assault and in the process wounded Tarleton's right hand with a sabre blow, while Tarleton creased Washington's knee with a pistol shot that also wounded his horse. Washington pursued Tarleton for sixteen miles, but gave up the chase when he came to the plantation of Adam Goudylock near Thicketty Creek. To escape capture by Washington, Tarleton had forced Goudylock to serve as an escape guide.Hays, Joel Stanford, \\"Adam Goudylock (ca. 1726-1796), Planter, of Albemarle County, Virginia, and Union County, South Carolina,\\" The American Genealogist 88 (2016), 49-56, 107-117, at 53-54.

This invasion failed, but a second invasion was launched. The regiment was part of this second force, under Sir Samuel Auchmuty. The British force besieged and captured Montevideo. In 1807, the regiment was part of the force, now under John Whitelocke, that tried to capture Buenos Aires, but this failed abysmally.Cannon, p. 49 The British force (including the regiment), was forced to surrender, and did not return home until January 1808.Cannon, p. 52 The charge of the Light Brigade, October 1854; The 17th Lancers were in the first line of cavalry (on the left of the picture) on the left flank (towards the front of the picture) 'Charge of the Light Brigade', Painting by Richard Caton Woodville (1825–1855) The regiment was sent to India shortly after returning home.Cannon, p. 54 It took part in the attack on the Pindarees in 1817 during the Third Anglo-Maratha War.Cannon, p. 62 Disease ravaged the regiment during its residency.Cannon, p. 70 While in India, the British Army nominally re-classified the regiment as lancers,Fortescue, p. 121 and added \\"lancers\\" as a subtitle to its regimental designation in 1822.

The regiment, commanded by Captain William Morris, was in the first line of cavalry on the left flank during the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava in October 1854. The brigade drove through the Russian artillery before smashing straight into the Russian cavalry and pushing them back; it was unable to consolidate its position, however, having insufficient forces and had to withdraw to its starting position, coming under further attack as it did so. The regiment lost 7 officers and 67 men in the debacle. The regiment went on to take part in the Siege of Sevastopol in winter 1854. After the inception of the Victoria Cross in 1856, three members of the regiment received the award for acts of gallantry in the charge: These were Troop Sergeant-Major John Berryman, Sergeant-Major Charles Wooden, and Sergeant John Farrell.  Victorian era  17th Lancers Waltz, 1905 music sheet cover to celebrate the cavalry regiment In December 1857 the regiment arrived in India to reinforce the effort to suppress the Indian rebellion against British rule. By the time the regiment was prepared for service, the rebellion was effectively over, although it did take part in the pursuit of Tatya Tope, the rebel leader. During the course of the pursuit, Lieutenant Evelyn Wood earned the Victoria Cross for gallantry. The regiment returned to England in 1865. The regiment became the 17th Regiment of Lancers in August 1861. When, in 1876, it gained Prince George, Duke of Cambridge as its colonel-in-chief, the regiment adopted the title of the 17th (The Duke of Cambridge's Own) Lancers. 24th (2nd Warwickshire) Regiment of Foot, who were both killed attempting to save the Queen's Colour of the 1st Battalion at the Battle of Isandlwana in January 1879. 17th Lancers at the Battle of Ulundi, July 1879 The regiment was sent to Natal Colony for service in the Anglo-Zulu War and fought at the Battle of Ulundi under Sir Drury Curzon Drury-Lowe in July 1879. The regiment was deployed inside a large British infantry square during the attack by the Zulu Army, which had surrounded the British. When the attack appeared to be wavering, the regiment was ordered to advance: their charge routed the warriors with heavy loss and proved to be decisive. The regiment returned to India the same year, remaining there until about 1890 when they returned to England. Second Boer War 'All That Was Left of Them' by Richard Caton Woodville (1856–1927). C Squadron at Modderfontein, September 1901 In February 1900 a contingent from the regiment, comprising Lieutenant-Colonel E. F. Herbert and 500 troops, was deployed to South Africa for service in the Second Boer War, and arrived to Cape Town on the SS Victorian early the next month. The contingent missed the large pitched battles, but still saw action during the war. In 1900, Sergeant Brian Lawrence won the regiment's fifth and final Victoria Cross at Essenbosch Farm. The contingent's most significant action was at the Battle of Elands River (Modderfontein) in September 1901. C Squadron was attacked by a unit of Boers under the command of Jan Smuts; the Lancers mistakenly assumed the unit was friendly because of their attire. The Boers immediately opened fire, attacking from both the front and the rear. The Lancers suffered further casualties at a closed gate that slowed them down. Only Captain Sandeman, the squadron commander, and Lieutenant Lord Vivian survived. The regiment suffered 29 killed and 41 wounded before surrendering, while Boer losses were just one killed and six wounded.Pakenham, p. 524. They stayed in South Africa throughout the war, which ended June 1902 with the Peace of Vereeniging. Four months later, 540 officers and men left Cape Town on the SS German in late September 1902, and arrived at Southampton in late October, when they were posted to Edinburgh.  First World War  Harry Payne The regiment, which was based in Sialkot in India at the start of the First World War, landed in France as part of the 2nd (Sialkot) Cavalry Brigade in the 1st Indian Cavalry DivisionAnglesey, Volume VII, p. 223 in November 1914 for service on the Western Front. The regiment fought in its conventional cavalry role at the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917. The regiment was transferred to the 7th Cavalry Brigade, part of the 3rd Cavalry Division in February 1918 and was used as mobile infantry, plugging gaps whenever the need arose, both as cavalry and as infantry during the last-gasp German Spring Offensive. After the signing of the Armistice on 11 November 1918, the regiment remained in continental Europe, joining the British Army of the Rhine in Cologne, Germany. The regiment then served in County Cork, Ireland, where it operated against the Irish Republican Army during the War of Independence. On 28 September 1920 IRA Volunteers led by Liam Lynch and Ernie O'Malley, raided Mallow British Army barracks in County Cork. They seized weaponry, freed prisoners and killed British serjeant W.G. Gibbs of the 17th Lancers.CWGC record It was the only British Army barracks to be captured during the war. In 1921, the title of the regiment was altered to the 17th Lancers (Duke of Cambridge's Own).  Amalgamation  The regiment was amalgamated with the 21st Lancers to form the 17th/21st Lancers in 1922.

He became known as \\"The Horseman\\" for his exceptional skills on horseback as well as for his help in rounding up wild mustangs on Utah's Antelope Island. He is most famous for his exploits during the 1857 Utah War. Smith practiced the Latter-day Saint doctrine of plural marriage, and had eight wives and 52 children.  Background  Born in 1830 in Williamstown, Oswego County, New York, Lot, with his parents and other children in the family, left New York to be with other members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. The Smith family lived across the Mississippi River from Nauvoo, Illinois and were neighbors with Brigham Young's family. Lot was 14 years old when Joseph Smith, beloved as a prophet, was murdered. In 1846, while the family fled the continuing persecution of Mormons, Lot's mother was one of many Mormons who died and were buried in Iowa territory.  Mormon Battalion  At sixteen, Smith joined the Mormon Battalion and served during the Mexican–American War making a journey, one of the most arduous overland marches in American history, from Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas through the southwest to San Diego, where the battalion was mustered out of service.  Fortunes of Life  After mustering out in California, other members of the Mormon Battalion worked at Sutter's Mill and discovered gold. Smith amassed a quantity of gold then came back across the mountains to the Great Salt Lake and Farmington, Utah, where he married, became a military leader in the Nauvoo Legion in Utah and was distinguished in campaigns to stop Indian depredations.MSS SC 2234; Utah Indian war records; 20th Century Western and Mormon Manuscripts; L. Tom Perry Special Collections, Harold B. Lee Library, Brigham Young University.  Service in the Battle at Fort Utah  In 1850, when Brigham Young called for the extermination of the Timpanogos, Smith volunteered as part of the Mormon militia. On February 8, in what was known as the Battle at Fort Utah, the army attacked the Timpanogos village. On the second day of fighting, he was chosen as part of 16 men to make a charge on a Timpanogos log house, from which the Timpanogos were trying to defend themselves. They successfully took the log cabin, and the Timpanogos retreated. They were able to pursue and kill around 100 Timpanogos people and enslave around 40.  Service in the Utah War 1857  The President and US Senate had chosen to remove then-governor Brigham Young from office based on reports from federal officials assigned to Utah who had abandoned their assignments and returned to the east. Young's replacement as governor of Utah territory Alfred Cumming was escorted by a contingent of 1,400 Federal troops led by Gen. Albert Johnston as part of what was called the Utah Expedition. The army's orders were to support the installment of the new governor, using force as necessary as resistance was expected based on the official's reports. Smith was sent on a special mission by Young, who hoped to delay the arrival of the troops in the hope that a diplomatic breakthrough could be reached before the troops reached Salt Lake City. Smith led a group of Nauvoo Legion rangers east across Wyoming along the stretch where the California, Oregon and Mormon Trails merge. Mormons, including Orrin Porter Rockwell harassed the army by burning the grass along the route, stampeding the army mules, and driving off their cattle. Fort Bridger, Wyoming was burned to the ground. Smith ordered the Union wagon trains of supplies to turn around but they complied only while he was in sight. Then, in one night, Smith and his men burned three wagon trains of supplies (food, clothing, gunpowder and whiskey for an entire army). Lot Smith and his rangers held off the Federal soldiers until an early blizzard and cold winter weather set in. The army was forced to winter near the ruins of Fort Bridger, Wyoming. Smith's efforts and the weather stopped an army - without Mormon troops harming any soldiers on the Federal side. A diplomatic settlement brokered by Col. Thomas L. Kane allowed Governor Cumming to take office peaceably and protected the civilian population from the army.  Service in the Civil War  Lot Smith led a contingent of the Nauvoo Legion that, at the request of Abraham Lincoln, guarded the telegraph line in conjunction with the U.S. Army during the Civil War.  Elected to public office  Lot Smith was the first Sheriff of Davis County, Utah. He also served in the Utah Territorial Legislature.  Settlement in Northern Arizona  Smith was asked to help the development of the Mormon settlement along the Little Colorado River. Smith led a large group that arrived in the spring of 1876 settling Sunset, Arizona and Brigham City, Arizona near present-day Winslow. Up river, Obed and St. Joseph (now Joseph City, Arizona) were colonized. Local Indians were befriended, Lot Smith became highly respected among the Navajo Indians. The establishment of settlements at the Sunset Crossing of the Little Colorado River was important in facilitating the subsequent Mormon colonization of eastern and central and southern Arizona, eastern New Mexico and even northern Mexico and southern Colorado. All branches of the Honeymoon Trail fanned out from this point. Lot Smith established a United Order at Sunset and became the first LDS Stake President in Arizona. Flash floods, droughts, crop failures, internal dissension, anti- Mormon sentiment and prosecution of polygamous leaders, and the Aztec Land & Cattle Company or Hashknife Outfit all took their toll on the small settlements. Tensions rose. Although Smith's inspiring oratory was appreciated, some ran afoul of his temper and others found him heavy-handed and resented his domineering.Peterson, Charles S., Take Up Your Mission: Mormon Colonizing Along the Little Colorado, 1870-1900 (1973) Residents gravitated toward the timbered land closer to the Mogollon Rim. Lot Smith built a home at Smith Spring near Mormon Lake and directed the establishment of a dairy, sawmill and ranching operations in the area.  Gunplay  Seeking to displace the Circle S ranching operations, a sheepman named Daggs hired a Hashknife cowboy/gunman named Thistle to eliminate Lot Smith. The strategy was to pick a fight with the targeted person, get him to draw, then shoot him and claim self-defense. Daggs and Thistle encountered Smith working livestock in his corral with two young sons. Thistle proceeded to goad Smith to anger. Smith turned and began walking to his house to get a firearm. Daggs urged Thistle to \\"Shoot him now.\\" Thistle declined to shoot an unarmed man in the back. Smith returned with a rifle and saw Thistle's pistol and hand starting to come out from where Thistle had taken cover. Shooting from the hip, Smith hit Thistle's pistol and amputated one of Thistle's fingers. That was the end of the gunfight but not the end of the trouble. Knowing Lot Smith was already subject to a federal warrant for polygamy, Daggs instigated another warrant for the arrest of Smith for the \\"assault\\" on Thistle. Smith, respected by local lawmen, was able to appear in court for an acquittal and avoid federal arrest. Daggs moved his sheep away and into the Tonto Basin, fueling the smoldering Tewksberry - Graham feud into the conflagration of the Pleasant Valley War.  Death  After 1886, with the collapse of the Sunset community and Smith's release from presiding church office, along with crippling injuries from farm machinery and continuing threat of prosecution for polygamy, Smith's star was descendant. In 1892 he had taken up residence in cabins with two wives in Big Canyon, east of Tuba City, Arizona where Mormons had early proselytized local Hopi and Navajo Native Americans. Although relations with the Indians, especially the Hopi, were initially cooperative, the growing numbers of Mormons in the Tuba City area began to cause friction in an area with limited water, grazing and farming resources. Non-Mormons were also jealous of the Mormon influence in the area. Another plot was hatched to eliminate the old Mormon, Lot Smith, and to spark conflict between the Mormons and the Native Americans. This time some of the war-like Navajo were chosen as pawns and scapegoats. On June 20, 1892, Smith found a flock of sheep turned into his fenced field of new barley by Navajo sheepherders. Horseback, Smith tried to drive the sheep out but Navajos at the gate repeatedly used their blankets to shoo the animals back in. Angered, Smith returned to his cabin to get his pistol. His wife, fearful of the consequences, pleaded with him not to go back. His ire kindled, Smith returned to his barley crop and again tried to drive the sheep out. Now, each time a sheep was shooed back from the gate, Smith would shoot the animal. The Indians retaliated in kind, shooting several of Smith's nearby milch cows. At an impasse, Smith began to ride away back to his cabin. Along the way a pistol-packing Navajo, Cat-chose, had set up to ambush Smith. Nearly simultaneously, Smith was shot in the back by a rifle and mortally wounded. Smith died that evening, accompanied by keening mourning of a crowd of Native American friends and onlookers. Although the plotters succeeded in killing Lot Smith, they were thwarted in their attempt to spark a conflict between the Mormons and the Native Americans. The local Mormon community was stunned and saddened by the loss of a patriarch, but revenge was forestalled by the local Mormon bishop who advised the community to \\"do nothing and say nothing.\\" Smith was buried near his cabin. A decade later, his remains were returned with great pomp and ceremony to Farmington, Utah where his grave became something of a symbol of the Mormon pioneer as frontiersman, soldier, and Indian fighter.

Biography Born Jeanne Louise Rachel Franck, she lived in an internal exile throughout the Second World War. Declared an \\"honorary Aryan\\", she was not deported to her death, but neither was she welcome in Vichy or in Paris. Born to a family of Jewish bankers in Paris and formerly married to a Jewish banker Claude Ullmann, Lisette de Brinon was an inveterate socialite, surrounding herself with notables of the left (Léon Blum) and of the right (Pierre Drieu la Rochelle). Emmanuel Berl, best known for writing some of Philippe Pétain's early speeches, was a first cousin. Her second husband, Fernand, Marquis de Brinon, was a Catholic aristocrat who distinguished himself with an early scoop interview with Adolf Hitler, and became one of the architects of French collaboration after France's catastrophic defeat at the hands of the Nazis in June 1940. As the war progressed, the couple were distanced partly by Lisette's inconvenient Jewishness, and also because of Brinon's long-term affair with his secretary Simone Mittre. Lisette attempted to follow Brinon when the Vichy government fled to exile in the castle of the Sigmaringen enclave following the Allied liberation. Although she managed to risk death by entering Germany, she never reached the castle. Brinon and her husband were captured by Allied Forces and taken to stand trial in Toulouse. She was imprisoned briefly while her husband was found guilty of treason and executed in 1947. She was a friend of another collaborator, Jacques Benoist-Méchin. The Marquise de Brinon died in 1982 in a nursing home in the Paris suburb of Montmorency.

At the 2011 census, it had a population of 9,668. It is situated four miles north of the city centre of Leicester and lies just outside the A563, Leicester's outer ring road.  History and geography  The Top House pub on Melton Road Thurmaston is bounded to the west by Watermead Country Park (which faces onto Birstall), to the north by Syston and to the east by Barkby and Barkby Thorpe. South of Thurmaston is Rushey Mead and the boundaries of the Leicester urban area. Rushey Mead was formerly part of the Thurmaston parish in the 19th century, before becoming a Thurmaston Urban District in 1894. In 1935, the district was annexed to the city of Leicester where it took its modern-day name of Rushey Mead. Thurmaston is split in two by the A607 dual carriageway, which by-passes the main village. To the east of the road is the mostly residential, newer part of Thurmaston. To the west is the main village on Melton Road, which stands on the old Fosse Way, the historic road built by the Romans. Thurmaston lies on the eastern banks of the River Soar, and two marinas are located there, one of which is also a boat-yard, and numerous mooring sites. These lead to the Watermead Country Park which is a purpose-built nature reserve. The Midland Main Line also runs through the eastern half of the village. Melton Road, Thurmaston Taylorcraft Aeroplanes Ltd., a subsidiary based in Thurmaston, developed the Taylorcraft Model 'D' and the Auster Mk. I through Mk. V, which became the backbone aircraft of the British A.O.P. The local football team, the Thurmaston Magpies, once boasted former England international striker/defender Dion Dublin in its ranks. The Thurmaston depot and headquarters of Arriva Midlands are located on Westmoreland Avenue within the village. Education Thurmaston contains three Key Stages 1 and 2 primary schools: * Bishop Ellis Catholic Primary School * Eastfield Primary School * Church Hill Infant School and Church Hill C of E Junior School It also contains a Key Stage 3 secondary school, The Roundhill Academy, which takes in students from all the aforementioned schools in the village, as well as schools in the neighbouring town of Syston. Students in Thurmaston aged 14–18 generally go on to attend Wreake Valley Academy in Syston, which is the nearest Key Stage 4 college in the Charnwood district. Facilities St. Michael's & All Angels Church Thurmaston's prominent location on the edge of Leicester has seen much development in recent years. On 31 March 2003, a large Asda superstore opened on Barkby Thorpe Lane, pushing the nearby Midlands Co- op superstore out of business. The Thurmaston Shopping Centre, featuring a number of retail outlets and restaurants, was built on the site of the old Co- op superstore in 2005. The main village stretch, along Melton Road, has several pubs, takeaway food outlets, convenience stores and various other small retail establishments. The head offices of Arriva Midlands are also located in the village, along with Arriva's Thurmaston depot where the majority of their buses and drivers that operate in Leicester are based. As well as many other industrial sites along Melton Road, Thurmaston also contains the Earls Way Industrial Estate in the eastern half of the village. The village has its own newspaper, The Thurmaston Times which is published bi- monthly. The village has a local history society, Thurmaston Heritage Group, whose members help promote an interest in different aspects of both past and present village life. One particular activity being pursued by a member of the group is the creation of an online virtual war memorial. The Thurmaston Military Indexes are being compiled to provide a listing of all those from the village who served their country in the Great War of 1914-1918 and the 1939-1945 War. The village also has its own community centre, Elizabeth Park Sports and Community Centre, which has become a popular wedding venue and also offers a range of sports and facilities including badminton and a state of the art 3G football pitch. The facility was built in 1996, and is home to Thurmaston Parish Council Offices. Elizabeth Park is also host to many of the local communities sports teams, such as Thurmaston Town FC and Thurmaston Bowls club. Public transport Thurmaston is served by a number of bus companies including Arriva Midlands, First Leicester and Centrebus. The nearest railway station is in Syston. Charnwood borough council's local transport plan from 2004 proposed new railway stations to be opened at Thurmaston and East Goscote. This has since been removed from the local plan.

Gasson Hall, Boston College, 1908 Bronze doors to Saint Patrick's Cathedral, New York, New York, 1949 Maginnis & Walsh was an architecture firm started by Charles Donagh Maginnis and Timothy Walsh in 1905. It was known for its innovative design of churches in Boston in the first half of the twentieth century. Partners Maginnis was born January 7, 1867 in Derry, Ireland. He emigrated to Boston at age 18 and got his first job apprenticing for architect Edmund M. Wheelwright as a draftsman. Influenced by the work of modern architect Ralph Adams Cram, Maginnis became a distinguished Gothic architect and an articulate writer and orator on the role of architecture in society. In 1948 Maginnis received the AIA Gold Medal for \\"outstanding service to American architecture,\\" the highest award in the profession. He died in 1955 at the age of eighty-eight in Brookline, Massachusetts. Timothy Francis Walsh was born in 1868 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He attended The English High School in Boston, and worked as a draftsman for Peabody and Stearns from 1887 to 1893, when he left to study in Europe. Walsh returned to Boston in 1895 and went into business as Walsh & Kearns. He worked as a solo practitioner in 1896 and 1897, and 1898 went into partnership with Charles Donagh Maginnis and Matthew Sullivan. He died July 7, 1934 at the age of sixty-six in North Scituate.Jennings, Jan. Cheap and Tasteful Dwellings: Design Competitions and the Convenient Interior, 1879-1909, Univ. of Tennessee Press, 2005, p. 260 Matthew Sullivan was born in Boston and trained in the office of Edmund M. Wheelwright, Boston City Architect (1891-1894). Sullivan succeeded Wheelwright as City Architect and served in that position from 1895 to 1901, when he became a junior partner in the firm of Maginnis, Walsh and Sullivan, which was widely known for its ecclesiastical work. He withdrew from that partnership to carry on work independently in 1906. Between the firm's founding in 1898 and the death of Timothy Walsh in 1934, the firm is credited with over 115 ecclesiastical works. The Maginnis and Walsh collection at the Boston Public Library contains work of the architectural firm from 1913 to 1952. Eugene F. Kennedy Jr. was born in Brooklyn, New York January 31, 1904 to Eugene F. Kennedy Sr. and Anna T. Lee. The family had moved to the Boston area by 1910. In 1924, he was awarded the Rotch Traveling Scholarship, established by architect Arthur Rotch to provide an American student of architecture a minimum of eight months study and travel abroad.Rotch Travelling Scholarship Kennedy joined M&W; in 1926, and married Carol Gertrude Fox (1903-1975) in 1928.

For thirty years, it was the only building on campus.\\"Administration Building\\", Emmanuel College In 1929 the firm designed Our Lady of Sorrows Church in South Orange, New Jersey, in the French Gothic style, to replace the 1889 St Mary's.History of Our Lady of Sorrows Church Boston College, Chestnut Hill Bapst Library, Seat of Wisdom Maginnis & Walsh won the bid to build the new campus of Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts. Designed by Maginnis, in 1908, the Boston College campus is a seminal example of Collegiate Gothic architecture. Combining Gothic Revival architecture with principles of Beaux-Arts planning, Maginnis proposed a vast complex of academic buildings set in a cruciform plan. The design suggested an enormous outdoor cathedral, with the long entry drive at the \\"nave,\\" the main quadrangle at the \\"apse\\" and secondary quadrangles at the \\"transepts.\\" Maginnis's design broke from the traditional Oxbridge models that had inspired it—and that had until then characterized Gothic architecture on American campuses. At the \\"crossing\\", Maginnis placed the university's main building. Using stone quarried on the site, the building was constructed at the highest point on Chestnut Hill, commanding a view of the surrounding landscape and the city to the east. In its unprecedented scale, Gasson Tower was conceived not as the belfry of a singular building, but as the crowning campanile of Maginnis' new \\"city upon a hill\\". Dominated by a soaring 200-foot bell tower, Recitation Hall was known simply as the \\"Tower Building\\" when it finally opened in 1913. Gasson Hall is credited for the typology of dominant Gothic towers in subsequent campus designs, including those at Princeton (Cleveland Tower, 1913–1917), Yale (Harkness Tower, 1917–1921), and Duke (Chapel Tower, 1930–1935). Although Maginnis' ambitious Gothic project never saw full completion due to the Wall Street Crash of 1929, its central portion was built according to plan and forms the core of what is now BC's iconic middle campus. According to Boston College historian, Fr. Charles F. Donovan, Gasson Hall (1913) (The signature building of BC), St. Mary's Hall and Chapel (1917), Devlin Hall (1924), and Bapst Library (commissioned 1922, completed 1928), called the \\"finest example of Collegiate Gothic architecture in America\\"), are the \\"original architectural gems\\" of the campus.\\"Campus Guide\\", Boston College In 1926, the Devlin Hall science building won the Harleston Parker Medal for \\"most beautiful building in Boston\\". M&W; also built Fulton Hall (1948), Lyons Hall (1951), St. Thomas More Hall (1954 -demolished 2014), and Campion (1955).Birnbaum, Ben. \\"The Brief, Effective Life of More Hall\\", Boston College Magazine, Fall 2014 Maginnis also designed the chancel at Trinity Church in Copley Square, the high altar at St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York and the Massachusetts Veterans War Memorial Tower on the summit of Mount Greylock. The firm also built St. Aidan's Church (Brookline, Massachusetts) (1911) where Maginnis was a parishioner. The church where John F. Kennedy was christened, St. Aidan's, has since been closed and converted to housing. Maginnis and Walsh and Kennedy (1941–1956) Maginnis designed the bronze doors at St. Patrick's Cathedral (Manhattan) to replace the original wooden ones. Each 16 1/2-foot by 5 1/2-foot door weighs 9,200 pounds and is decorated with sculptures of saints created by John Angel. The doors were blessed by Cardinal Spellman and opened for the first time just before Christmas 1949.

Its rural 150-acre (607,000 m²) campus is approximately 26 miles (40 km) northwest of Omaha, and overlooks a portion of the Missouri River Valley. The campus was planned to be purchased by Midland University, which expressed its intention to re-open the campus in 2015 or 2016, but dropped plans in early 2016. The name “Dana” is the poetic variant of “Denmark.” The college was founded in 1884 by Danish pioneers. Introduction The student body was taught by 45 professors and eight non-doctorate instructors, resulting in an average teacher-student ratio of 1:12. The college offered on-campus housing in five residence halls and contractually maintained off-campus apartments for married or non-traditional students. Campus life fostered by an active student government and many student organizations. There were no fraternities and sororities. History The Danish Evangelical Lutheran Association in America (or Blair Church) was formed in 1884 by a group of Danish members who left the Conference of the Norwegian-Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America. Many Blair Church pastors were supportive of the Inner Mission. The Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in North America (or North Church) was formed in 1894 when seminary professor P. S. Vig, along with a number of pastor and congregations, left the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in America over theological differences. In 1896, two small groups of Danish Lutherans in America - known as the Blair Church and the North Church - came together to form the United Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church (commonly known as the United Church). This church body was a part of the Danish Lutheran \\"Inner Mission\\" movement, which supported a revival of religious practice based on the Bible and orthodox Lutheran teachings. Its members strongly opposed the liberalizing influence of Danish theologian N. F. S. Grundtvig, who had supported the realization of religious expression through sacramental and congregational practices. Led by Peter Sørensen Vig and C. X. Hansen, one of the United Church's first priorities was to establish an educational system. Elk Horn Højskole in Elk Horn, Iowa, had been founded in 1878 as the first Danish folk school in America. In 1894, Pastor Kristian Anker, then owner and principal of the Elk Horn Højskole, sold it to the newly formed Danish Lutheran Church in North America for use as a seminary and college. When the North Church merged with the Blair Church in 1896, the seminary was consolidated with Trinity Seminary in Blair, Nebraska.Elk Horn Højskole Folk School (Dana College) When the Dana School was founded, part of its purpose was to be a pre-seminary school for those preparing for ministry in the Lutheran church. Many of Dana's early graduates went on to study at Trinity Seminary. For many years, Dana and Trinity shared faculty, administrators, staff, and presidents. This relationship ended in 1956 when Trinity Seminary merged with Wartburg Theological Seminary in Dubuque, Iowa. The Dana School was begun as preparatory school. By the early 1910s - in cooperation with the University of Nebraska - the Dana School was awarding associate degrees. In the 1930s Dana College became an accredited four-year school and began awarding bachelor's degrees. Closure The institution faced significant, on-going financial challenges in the 2000s. Dana College reported that its deficit rose from $7,170,000 USD in 2005 to more than $12,550,000 USD in 2009. The Dana College Board of Regents attempted to convince major donors to make contributions to the college. Yet Dana College was unable to attract the donations to erase the deficit and fund on-going operations. This lack of financial support for the institution was because of two major problems: The global financial crisis which resulted in the Great Recession of 2008 meant that several prospective donors were unable and/or unwilling to contribute, coupled with a lack of a \\"big grand vision for what Dana could become\\", according to one Regent who served during that period. In 2010, the Dana College Board of Regents made a decision to structure an agreement to sell Dana College to an investment group, Dana Education Corporation. The investment group proposed to transform Dana into a for-profit institution with a focus on \\"doubling enrollment, aggressively marketing the school and building Dana's study abroad program.\\" However, this proposed change of control was not accepted by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. The sale of Dana College to the investment group collapsed. On June 30, 2010, the Dana College Board of Regents elected to cease operations, citing a multimillion-dollar deficit. On July 14, 2010, the Dana College Board of Regents wrote in a letter to alumni and supporters \\"We are firm in our belief that politics, not substance and reason, drove the ultimate decision.\\" Attempts made by students, faculty, staff, alumni and other supporters of Dana College to influence the Higher Learning Commission to reverse its decision failed. Students were offered the ability to transfer the University of Nebraska at Omaha and Grand View University in Iowa, through formal teach-out plans. Midland University of Fremont, Nebraska, allowed all former Dana College students to transfer all Dana college credits, honored all Dana academic, athletic and need-based scholarships and grants, and waived enrollment deposits for Dana students. Of the roughly 600 Dana students, approximately 275 enrolled at Midland in the fall of 2010. In 2013, Midland University, experiencing increasing enrollment and considering expansion, leased the Dana campus with the option of purchasing it; the land was purchased instead by Frank Krejci, an Omaha developer, for $3.5 million, who then donated it to Ed Shada, an Omaha banker, to lead redevelopment of the campus. In 2016, Midland announced that it would not re-open the Dana campus, but would concentrate its expansion efforts in Fremont and Omaha. According to a Midland press release, high maintenance costs and \\"a complicated path to accreditation\\" dissuaded them from carrying through their plans for the Blair site.\\"Midland University drops plans for vacant Dana College campus\\".

The land was to become the new home of Omaha's Grace University in 2018, after the school sold a large part of their campus to Omaha Public Schools. However, Grace too announced their folding at the end of the 2017-18 academic year and the move to Blair did not occur. In 2018, alumni and friends of Grace founded Charis University with the intent of occupying the Dana campus and becoming a spiritual successor to Grace.

Former pro wrestler Bill Danenhauer was the last athletic director. Intercollegiate sports included baseball, soccer, cheer and dance, basketball, football, men's and women's golf, softball, track and field, cross country, volleyball, women's lacrosse and wrestling. The school was part of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), competing in the Great Plains Athletic Conference (GPAC). In January 2009, it considered changing conference affiliations; however, outcry from alumni caused the school to rethink its position. The college also had a number of intramural and club sports programs below the varsity level, operating independently of the athletic department.

According to Smith, these characters were from the golden plates (the ancient record from which Smith claims to have translated the Book of Mormon) and represent the reformed Egyptian writing that was on the plates. In 1828, this paper was delivered to Charles Anthon, a well-known classical scholar of Columbia College, for an expert opinion on the authenticity of the characters and the translation. Some adherents to the Book of Mormon claim that Anthon attested to the characters' authenticity in writing to Martin Harris but then ripped up his certification after hearing the story of Smith and the plates. Critics of Smith claim that Anthon believed any idea of the plates containing an ancient language was a hoax all along and that Harris was being deceived.Richard L. Bushman, Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling (New York: Knopf, 2005), pp. 65-66 Hofmann forgery of the Anthon Transcript, LDS archives. Note the columnar arrangement and the \\"Mexican Calendar\\" described by Anthon Believers claim that the incident between Harris and Anthon fulfilled a biblical prophecy made by Isaiah,, KJV (LDS) 11 And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed: 12 And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned. as Anthon is reported to have said to Harris, through Smith's telling of events, \\"I cannot read a sealed book.\\" In 1980, Mark Hofmann created and sold a forgery of the Anthon Transcript to leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), which was revealed to be fraudulent when Hofmann's crimes were investigated. Harris's account of meeting with Anthon Martin Harris In 1828, Smith related an account based on Harris's version of the meeting. Smith wrote that Anthon \\"stated that the translation was correct, more so than any he had before seen translated from the Egyptian. [Harris] then showed him those not yet translated, and said they were Egyptian, Chaldaic, Assyriac, and Arabic\\"; and that they were \\"true characters.\\" According to Harris, Anthon wrote Harris a letter of authenticity declaring the fragment to contain true Egyptian characters. Anthon was also reported to have confirmed the translation of these characters as correct. When informed that an angel of God had revealed the characters to Smith, Anthon reportedly tore up the authentication stating that there was no such thing as angels and asked Harris to bring the plates to him for translation. Harris then went to Dr. Samuel L. Mitchill, who sanctioned what Anthon said.Richard E. Bennett, \\"'Read This I Pray Thee': Martin Harris and the Three Wise Men of the East\\", Journal of Mormon History 36:178 (2010).Matthew S. McBride, \\"The Contributions of Martin Harris\\", churchofjesuschrist.org, 3 January 2013. Anthon's accounts of meeting with Harris Columbia professor Charles Anthon In 1834, Anthon stated in a letter that, \\"The whole story about my having pronounced the Mormonite inscription to be 'reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics' is perfectly false. ... I soon came to the conclusion that it was all a trick, perhaps a hoax. ... [Harris] requested an opinion from me in writing, which of course I declined giving.\\" Anthon stated in the letter that the story of his supposed authentication was false, that Anthon had identified the writings as a hoax, and that he had told Harris that the writings were part of \\"a scheme to cheat the farmer [Harris] of his money\\". Anthon gave a second account in 1841 that contradicted his 1834 account as to whether he gave Harris a written opinion about the document: \\"[Harris] requested me to give him my opinion in writing about the paper which he had shown to me. I did so without hesitation, partly for the man's sake, and partly to let the individual 'behind the curtain' see that his trick was discovered. The import of what I wrote was, as far as I can now recollect, simply this, that the marks in the paper appeared to be merely an imitation of various alphabetical characters, and had, in my opinion, no meaning at all connected with them.\\" Anthon in both accounts maintained that he told Harris that Harris was the victim of a fraud. Pomeroy Tucker, a contemporary of Harris and Smith, opined in 1867 that all the scholars whom Harris visited \\"were understood to have scouted the whole pretense as too depraved for serious attention, while commiserating the applicant as the victim of fanaticism or insanity.\\" Caractors document The Community of Christ purchased the handwritten slip of paper from the heirs of David Whitmer, then thought to be the Anthon Transcript, this particular candidate now called the Caractors Document. Whitmer, who once owned the document, stated that it was this slip of paper that Harris showed to Anthon. Both Mormon apologists and critics, however, claim that it is not certain that the Caractors Document is the original Anthon Transcript, since Anthon had described that the characters on the slip he saw were arranged in vertical columns and ended in a \\"rude delineation of a circle divided into various compartments, decked with various strange marks, and evidently copied after the Aztec calendar given by Humboldt,\\" (1834) or \\"a rude representation of the Mexican zodiac\\" (1841). Recent scholarship, including Handwriting Analysis, suggests the \\"Caractors Document\\" was written in or after 1829, by David Whitmer's brother John Whitmer, and therefore would not have been available to show Anthon or others in 1828. The symbols on the document were published twice in 1844, after Smith's death, as characters that had been copied from the gold plates, one of them in the December 21 issue of The Prophet. In 1956 a request for review of the Caractors Document was made to three recognized egyptologists: Sir Alan Gardiner, William C. Hayes, and John A. Wilson. Gardiner replied that he saw no resemblance with \\"any form of Egyptian writing.\\" Hayes stated that it might be an inaccurate copy of something in hieratic script and that \\"some groups look like hieratic numerals\\", adding that \\"I imagine, however, that the inscription bears a superficial resemblance to other scripts, both ancient and modern, of which I have no knowledge.\\" Wilson gave the most detailed reply, saying that \\"This is not Egyptian writing, as known to the Egyptologist. It obviously is not hieroglyphic, nor the \\"cursive hieroglyphic\\" as used in the Book of the Dead. It is not Coptic, which took over Greek characters to write Egyptian. Nor does it belong to one of the cursive stages of ancient Egyptian writing: hieratic, abnormal hieratic, or demotic.\\" The document is portrayed in the 2004 film The Work and the Glory.

Early history The Outlaws were formed in Tampa, Florida, United States, in 1967 by guitarists/vocalists Frank Guidry, Hughie Thomasson, Herbie Pino and Hobie O'Brien drummer David Dix and bassist Phil Holmberg joined the band as well. Before Guidry joined the band the group was called The Four Letter Words. He had previously been in a band by the same name. By early 1968, O'Brien and Holmberg both left the band to get married and Frank O'Keefe came in on vocals and bass respectively. Later that year, Tommy Angarano joined the Outlaws to replace Pino, bringing Hammond organ sounds and his style of vocals to the band. But after he left, Pino was brought back in. In the spring of 1968 the group's first manager, Paul Deutekom, brought them to Epic Studios in New York City to record an album, which was never released after the band and the producer had a falling-out. The group headed back to Tampa then got another deal to go to Criteria Studios in Miami. There they recorded another album with producer Phil Gernhard. But this album was likewise never released and Gernhard vanished soon after. As part of the Gernhard record deal, bassist Ronny Elliott was brought in around this time, forcing Guidry out. Ronny played bass while O'Keefe briefly switched to guitar. But O'Keefe went back to bass after Elliott left in 1969 and Herb Pino, who had mostly been a singer up till this time, began playing more guitar as well. Drummer Monte Yoho also joined that same year to sub for Dix. In early 1970, the Outlaws were joined by two members of the Dave Graham Group that was also managed by Paul Deutekom (of Ped-Dyn Productions) The Dave Graham Group's Union leader was Monte Yoho, but he was not invited to be part of this line-up. The early 1970 Outlaws line-up was Hughie Thomasson, Frank O'Keefe, Dave Dix, Billy Jones and Dave Graham. Graham was influential in moving the group toward country-rock, especially the music of Poco. They recorded a cover of the Doors' \\"Five to One\\" as an audition to a recording deal that never materialized. This lineup ended in the spring of 1970 and the group eventually parted ways with Deutekom. Yoho and Herb Pino returned, but by 1971 the offers for gigs had slowed down and the group went into limbo for a year or so, not sure if they would continue. In 1971 Henry Paul, a singer and guitarist who was born and raised in Hurley, New York but spent his later teen years in the Tampa area, returned from a stay in Greenwich Village NYC to form Sienna, which was more of a country rock outfit. He was joined by Monte Yoho and Frank O'Keefe. In 1972, Hughie Thomasson returned from a brief spell in New York where he had been backing folksinger Milton Carroll, joined up with Paul, Yoho and O'Keefe and Sienna became the reborn Outlaws. Billy Jones, who would sometimes show up to jam with the group on organ in 1971 and 1972, returned from a stint in Boulder, Colorado in 1973 and switched to guitar, giving birth to the band's first infamous guitar trio later dubbed \\"the Florida Guitar Army\\". O'Keefe left the group temporarily in 1973–74. Buzzy Meekins and another bassist named Rick Birkbeck stood in until he was able to return. In 1974, Charlie Brusco signed on as manager for the Outlaws. Alan Walden (brother of Capricorn Records founder Phil Walden) was told of the group by Lynyrd Skynyrd frontman Ronnie Van Zant and he joined forces with Brusco as co-manager. The band was the first act signed to Arista Records under Clive Davis. Davis was in the audience at a show in 1974 where the band was opening for Lynyrd Skynyrd in Columbus, Georgia. On the way to the stage for Lynyrd Skynyrd's set, lead vocalist Ronnie Van Zant said to Clive Davis who was with Charlie Brusco “If you don’t sign the Outlaws, you’re the dumbest music person I’ve ever met—and I know you’re not.” The Outlaws' earliest well known songs were \\"There Goes Another Love Song\\" and \\"Green Grass and High Tides\\", both from their 1975 debut album The Outlaws. Their 1980 cover of \\"(Ghost) Riders in the Sky\\" from the album Ghost Riders was their biggest single chart success, reaching No. 31 on the Billboard Hot 100. Career Thomasson and Jones While the Outlaws are generally considered to be a part of the Southern rock genre, there are distinct differences in their approach and their influences. Their primary similarity to other Southern rock bands is the dual lead guitar interplay, a defining characteristic of many Southern rock bands. However, the Outlaws’ mix of country and rock elements displays the vocal harmony influences of groups like Buffalo Springfield, the Byrds, Eagles, New Riders of the Purple Sage, and Poco. Their use of three and four part harmonies set them apart from their contemporaries who usually relied on a single lead vocalist. Hughie Thomasson's signature guitar playing style and voice were defining characteristics of the band's sound. Thomasson's guitar sound was underpinned by the use of the Fender Stratocaster (and sometimes a Telecaster) played in a quasi-country style mixed with fluid, quick blues runs. Hughie was nicknamed \\"The Flame\\" for his flaming fast guitar work. He is a member of the Fender Hall of Fame. The other lead guitarist, Billy Jones, played mainly a Gibson Les Paul and switched between a clean and distorted sound. A good example of this can be heard on \\"Green Grass and High Tides\\" on the right stereo channel. Hughie Thomasson's distinctive Stratocaster sound can be heard on the left channel. Thomasson opens the first solo at the intro and plays the first half of the two succeeding longer solos all on the right channel. There are many video examples of his Green Grass solos on the internet. The records released by the band between 1975 and 1980 are considered the best representation of the band's style. The band was seen on successful concert tours billed with other non-Southern rock acts of the time including opening for the Who on the 'Who Boots In' tour in 1976. This contrast of styles was more common at that time than the packaged \\"genre\\" tours seen so often these days. The willingness of promoters to mix styles led to the Outlaws gaining a large following in the United States. The Outlaws' style is highly characterized in their first three albums, The Outlaws (1975), Lady in Waiting (1976), and Hurry Sundown (1977). These are considered the best work of the band with all of the \\"classic era\\" band members, except for O'Keefe, who was replaced by the left-handed bass player Harvey Dalton Arnold on \\"Hurry Sundown\\" (see below for a complete roster of Outlaws members). Henry Paul left after their third album in 1977, and eventually formed the Henry Paul Band, which would release four albums from 1979-82. With the band beginning to falter in the early 80s, Billy Jones left the band in 1981. Henry Paul returned in 1983. The albums released after 1980 are largely viewed by critics as a gradual move away from the original sound that gained them success in the 1970s. The reworking of the Western-styled \\"Ghost Riders\\" in 1980 was the band's last taste of big league success, although the band released two more records, Los Hombres Malo in 1982 and Soldiers of Fortune in 1986. As the 1980s came to a close, Thomasson became the final original member of the act. Albums such as Diablo Canyon, released in 1994, were released on smaller independent record labels. The band by now was mostly confined to smaller club dates. This situation led to Thomasson accepting a guitar position in the legendary and more popular Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1996. This essentially sidelined the Outlaws for a decade, as Thomasson's voice and guitar style were just too integral a part of the Outlaws' sound for the other members to successfully work without it. In 2000, the Diablo Canyon-lineup released the album So Low, to mixed response from fans. Many cited it as being more of a solo output from Thomasson. After this release, the band again vanished from the musical environment. Henry Paul went on to form the country band BlackHawk, which had some chart success in the 1990s. In April 2005, classic members Hughie Thomasson, Henry Paul, Monte Yoho, and David Dix reunited as the Outlaws and the rest of the lineup was filled out with former guitarist Chris Anderson, bassist Randy Threet, and Dave Robbins on keyboards. The latter three had been with Paul's country group BlackHawk. The members from the band's heyday, guitarist Billy Jones and bassist Frank O'Keefe, had died in 1995, O'Keefe of a drug overdose and Jones suicide shortly after. Paul and Robbins left to resume their careers in BlackHawk in early 2006, but the remaining band soldiered on. They were part of the Charlie Daniels Volunteer Jam tour in the summer of 2007. Band leader Hughie Thomasson died on September 9, 2007, of a heart attack in Brooksville, Florida. No release date has been announced for the new studio album, Once an Outlaw, which was finished before Thomasson's death. A cover version of their trademark epic 10-minute track \\"Green Grass and High Tides\\" is featured as the finale in the set list for guitar and bass in the video game Rock Band and features two complicated solos. In December 2007, 2008 Outlaws tour dates were released. In January 2008, the Outlaws lineup would be revealed to include Henry Paul (guitars/vocals), Monte Yoho (drums), Chris Anderson (guitars/vocals), and Randy Threet (bass), along with newer additions Billy Crain (guitars), Jon Coleman (keyboards), and Brett Cartwright (bass). Cartwright left the band shortly thereafter. This would be the first lineup in Outlaws' history without Hughie Thomasson on guitar and vocals, as from the band's formation to his death, he was the only constant member, garnering him the nicknames \\"Mr. Outlaw\\" and \\"The Lone Outlaw\\". According to the band's web site, the Outlaws announced their intention to continue to tour throughout the summer and fall of 2009 with this lineup and planned to participate in the Simple Man Cruise with Lynyrd Skynyrd in January 2010. It was also stated on the website that the band would change its name to 'Henry Paul Band' due to Thomasson's death, but to continue touring with the same setlists. In May 2010, the Outlaws were featured, along with the Marshall Tucker Band, Molly Hatchet, Blackberry Smoke, and the Chris Hicks Band, on stage at Long Island Southern Jam 2010 in Babylon, N.Y. at Overlook Beach. The all-day concert featured a unique jam fest for all the bands. For the 2010 tour, Dave Robbins returned on keyboards and Henry Paul was involved in a lawsuit brought about by Hughie Thomasson's widow, Mary, which alleged trademark violations. In April 2011 the case was ruled upon in favor of Henry Paul, Monte Yoho and the co-defendants. On July 30, 2012, it was announced on the band's website that \\"their first new album in 12 years\\" will be released on September 25, 2012, titled It's About Pride. It was also accompanied by a separately released DVD documentary about the making of the new album, called Hidin' Out In Tennessee. Led by Henry Paul, the album was critically acclaimed. A few years before the album, Paul recruited an old friend from the Henry Paul Band, lead guitarist Billy Crain to join the band. Paul and Crain collaborated on writing many of the songs for It's About Pride. The final track was a cover of the Henry Paul Band song \\"So Long\\" from its 1979 debut album, Grey Ghost. In 2013, Billy Crain left the band and Steve Grisham, who performed on the 1986 album Soldiers of Fortune, rejoined as guitarist. In 2016, the Outlaws released a 2-CD concert set titled Legacy Live.

Beijing City Government. History and profile The magazine's first issue appeared in 1994. Non-audited, self-reported circulation of 70,000 copies per month, the magazine can be found at Beijing hotels, office buildings, and cultural sites, indeed anywhere with large numbers of tourists, including Beijing Capital International Airport. Advertising is primarily of hotels, shows, and restaurants in central Beijing. BTM primarily focuses on tourism and the promotion of Beijing. Being an arm of the Beijing Government, unusual or out-of-hours access to sensitive sites in the city (such as the Temple of Heaven or the Great Wall) is often arranged, and the magazine features high-quality photography of such places. Issues are usually dedicated to a particular theme: the 2004 Olympic Torch Relay, China's eight major cuisines, and Beijing's many architectural styles, are examples from June, August, and September 2004, respectively.

Currently, the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs's research portfolio consists of five primary initiatives: the Institute for Contemporary Affairs (ICA), Defensible Borders Initiative, Jerusalem in International Diplomacy, Iran and the New Threats to the West, and Combating Delegitimization.\\"About the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs,\\" Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/about/ More broadly, the think-tank concentrates on the topics of Iran, Radical Islam, the Middle East, Israel, the Peace Process, Jerusalem, Anti-Semitism, and World Jewry.\\"Books,\\" Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/book/# Its publications include the academic journal Jewish Political Studies Review and the email- distributed Daily Alert, a daily regional news summary. The research institute is a registered non-profit organization and produces content in English, Hebrew, French, and German.\\"Support Us,\\" Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/support-us/ The JCPA is considered to be politically neo- conservative. It is being financed to a large degree by Sheldon Adelson, a steadfast supporter of Jewish settlement of the West Bank. History The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs was established in 1978 by Daniel Elazar as an umbrella organization encompassing the Center for Jewish Community Studies and the Jerusalem Institute for Federal Studies. Elazar personally raised most of the funds for the operation of the organization and the restoration of an historic building on Tel Hai Street in Jerusalem, named in honor of the Milken family. The building, Beit Milken, served as the Embassy of Uruguay from 1957 to 1980, when Uruguay decided to move their embassy to Tel Aviv. In 1989, the 1,200 ton building was moved 16 meters on rails to reach the site it currently occupies. Dr. Dore Gold, Israel's former ambassador to the UN and former foreign policy adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, headed the Jerusalem Center from 2000 to 2015, when he took a leave of absence to become director-general of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Gold returned as president of the Jerusalem Center. Political orientation The JCPA has been described as neo-conservative. It has been headed since 2000 by \\"Netanyahu confidante\\" Dore Gold. In 2015 Haaretz identified Sheldon Adelson as \\"one of the main financers of JCPA in recent years\\"; Adelson is an American billionaire casino magnate, staunch supporter of Jewish settlement of the West Bank and biggest contributor to US Republicans in the 2018 US midterm elections during President Donald Trump's mandate. Self-declared policy positions Israeli internal politics The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs does not comment, publish, or advocate any explicit policy decisions concerning Israeli domestic security. Accordingly, no articles, videos, or major publications on the think-tank's website will discuss political coalitions in Israel nor mention its major parties (e.g. Likud, Zionist Union, etc.). Final status negotiations The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs is an organisation which largely focuses on Israeli security, regional diplomacy, and international law.\\"Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs Home Page,\\" Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/ The essence of the organization's positions regarding final status negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians was articulated within their Defensible Borders Initiative. A continuing project dating back to the early-2000s, the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs has made explicit their stance on the matter, particularly in a YouTube video released in May 2010.\\"Israel's Critical Security Needs for a Viable Peace,\\" The Jerusalem Center, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytWmPqY8TE0 The think-tank is a supporter of the two-state solution calling for a \\"demilitarized Palestinian state\\" alongside Israel. Jordan Valley Regarding the Jordan Rift Valley, the organization is opposed to the presence of international peacekeeping troops given their poor track-record in the Gaza Strip, the Sinai Peninsula, and Southern Lebanon (see United Nations Emergency Force and United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon). Accordingly, the organization argues that Israel must retain control of the Jordan Valley. Concerning the future of the Palestinian territories, the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs advocates for demilitarization and Israel's ability to exercise control of airspace and electromagnetic communications throughout Judea and Samaria (otherwise known as the West Bank). Jerusalem's final status Research conducted by the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs fellow Nadav Shragai, as well as, the organization's program Jerusalem in International Diplomacy maintain that Jerusalem should remain unified and under Israeli sovereignty.\\"Jerusalem in International Diplomacy,\\" Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/program/jerusalem/ Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement The organization is opposed, and actively seeks to undermine, the BDS movement. Another core program of the institute, Combating Delegitimization and BDS, alongside the work of Dan Diker demonstrates the movement's objectives of achieving a one-state solution, dismantling Israel, and its correlation with anti-Semitism incidents.\\"Combating Delegitimization and BDS,\\" Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/program/combating-delegitimization-and-bds/ Publications Periodical publications Jewish Political Studies Review The JCPA publishes the academic journal, Jewish Political Studies Review. The journal is published biannually and is \\"the first and only journal dedicated to the study of Jewish political institutions and behavior, Jewish political thought, and Jewish public affairs.\\" Daily Alert The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs also produces the Daily Alert for the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, a daily news summary and analysis concerning Israel, Iran, radical Islam, and other regional security issues distributed through email.\\"Daily Alert,\\" Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, June 13, 2017, http://www.dailyalert.org/ Recent publications The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs has recently published multiple studies relating to Israeli security, international diplomacy, and the status of Jerusalem. As part of the organization's emphasis on making their material public and accessible, all of their major survey studies are digitalized and published on their website.\\"Books,\\" Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/book/ In the wake of the so-called 'Knife Intifada', the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs published a collection edited by in-house author Fiamma Nirenstein.Fiamma Nirenstein, ed., \\"Lessons from Israel's Response to Terrorism,\\" 2017, http://jcpa.org/lessons-israels-response- terrorism/ Another work published in 2016 by in-house author Dan Diker was an in-depth exploration of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanction (BDS) movement. Entitled BDS Unmasked: Radical Roots, Extremist Ends, Diker traces the roots of the BDS movement arguing that it represents only the most recent incarnation of a historical attempt to boycott Israel. The publication also references foundational members of BDS (e.g. Omar Barghouti) in demonstrating the movement's support for the one-state solution and dismantling of the Israeli state.Dan Diker, BDS Unmasked: Radical Roots, Extremist Ends (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, 2016), 6-8, http://jcpa.org/pdf/Unmasking_.pdf The book also demonstrates a powerful relationship between BDS activities and anti-Semitic incidents on university campuses. Jerusalem also features largely in the think-tank's work. The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs member, Nadav Shragai, published a historical and legal evaluation of Jerusalem and the city's role in final status peace negotiations entitled Nadav Shragai, Jerusalem: Delusions of Division (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, 2015). Informed, in part, by recent polling data from the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, Shragai argues that a majority of Jerusalem's Arabs favour preserving their Israeli citizenship rather than substituting it for a Palestinian one. More importantly for Shagrai, Jerusalem's Arab community is increasingly being incorporated into the Jewish municipal fabric and represents a valuable dimension to future negotiations over the status of Jerusalem. Other The JCPA produces a publication entitled \\"Changing Jewish Communities,\\" which is less focused on global anti-Semitism and, therefore, addresses a wide variety of issues related to global Jewish communities. The JCPA has organized a publication called \\"Jewish Environmental Studies,\\" which looks deeply at Jewish environmental studies as a separate and important field and analyzes Jewish environmental thought through references from the Bible and classic Jewish texts. Video In addition to their written publications, the JCPA produces numerous videos that analyze a variety of issues pertaining to Israel and the Middle East. These include videos created by the center as well as videos of JCPA contributors appearing in various news outlets or conference venues. The videos can be found on the JCPA website or on the JCPA’s YouTube page. Institutes Institute for Contemporary Affairs The Jerusalem Center founded the Institute for Contemporary Affairs (ICA) jointly with the Wechsler Family Foundation. The current director of the ICA is Ambassador Alan Baker. Through this outlet, the JCPA publishes Jerusalem Issue Briefs and Jerusalem Viewpoints. They also publish the twice-yearly Strategic Perspectives, special reports presenting studies on Israeli security and diplomacy topics by the Contributing Editors board of the ICA. Institute for Global Jewish Affairs In 2008, JCPA founded the Institute for Global Jewish Affairs in response to growing international anti-Semitism. Directed by Manfred Gerstenfeld, the institute addresses a variety of topics related to Jewish communities around the world. The institute helps direct the \\"Post- Holocaust and Anti-Semitism Project\\" and its associated monthly publication \\"Post-Holocaust and Anti-Semitism,\\" both of which attend to global anti- Semitism. Conferences On March 24, 2014, the Jerusalem Center held a conference entitled \\"Europe and Israel: A New Paradigm.\\" The conference focused on the complicated relationship between Israel and Europe, including topics such as economics and the BDS movement, security and anti-Semitism. The conference was well attended and received a significant amount of press, including articles in The Times of Israel, The Jerusalem Post, J-Wire, Ynetnews, and CBN News. Programs and initiatives Combating delegitimization and BDS A core component of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs concerns efforts by the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement to delegitimize Israel. According to the organization's website, the initiative \\"is a major multilingual public diplomacy program\\" which seeks to expose those who undermine Israel's very legitimacy. This programme entails reinforcing the connection between \\"the Jewish people and their historical homeland including Jerusalem.\\" Jerusalem in international diplomacy Jerusalem's centrality to final status negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA) has ensured that it is a subject which garners disproportionate scrutiny. The intermingling of religious, political, and legal dimensions has encouraged the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs to publish extensively on the subject. Spearheaded by Nadav Shragai, the initiative has led to such publications as, Jerusalem: Delusions of Division (2015), Jerusalem: Correcting the International Discourse (2012), and The 'Al-Aksa Is in Danger Libel: The History of a Lie (2012).\\"Nadav Shragai,\\" Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/researcher/nadav-shragai/ As outlined in the organization's policy video, the interlocking Arab and Jewish neighbourhoods of Jerusalem make division unfeasible. Mindful of Jerusalem's history during the Jordanian occupation when religious freedoms were curtailed, the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs believes that the city must remain undivided and under Israeli sovereignty. Iran and the New Threats to the West This program focuses on security threats posed by Iran to Israel and the West. The program began with a publication entitled “Referral of Iranian President Ahmadinejad on the Charge of Incitement to Commit Genocide,” authored by Dore Gold and Elie Wiesel, among others. The publication was created in response to multiple threats directed toward Israel by the Iranian leader, including a 2006 declaration that “Israel should be wiped off the map.” The JCPA continues to monitor security threats posed by Iran in the post-Ahmadinejad era with this program. Post-Holocaust and Anti-Semitism Project Initiated by Dr. Manfred Gerstenfeld, the program focuses on anti-Semitism after the Holocaust and \\"its origins and lessons, manifestations and mutations.\\"\\"Post-Holocaust and Anti-Semitism,\\" Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/publication/phas/ The initiative produces a monthly publication which addresses issues concerning past and presents acts directed against World Jewry and, among other issues, highlights anti-Israel boycotts, the manipulation of Holocaust history, and anti-Semitism emanating from Muslim and Christian communities. The program consists of conferences, seminars, lectures, interviews, and essays. As well, its content is available in English and French. The most recent publication, \\"Why a New Academic Discipline of Post-Holocaust Studies Should Be Established and What Its Content Should Be\\", argues that while the Holocaust has been instrumental in shaping modern society, its study is often confined to mass murder while its continued influence today is often neglected. Global Law Forum This program covers issues pertaining to Israel and international law. The goal of the program is to “protect Israel’s legal rights in its conflict with the Palestinians, the Arab world, and radical Islam.” Topics include the legality of settlements, human rights, and Israeli border issues, among others. Avi Bell directs the program. Additional contributors include Robert Sabel, Ruth Lapidoth, Irit Kohn, Alan Baker, Meir Rosenne, and Justus Weiner.

It is the only private university in the Upper Peninsula. Founded in 1896 as The Suomi College and Theological Seminary, it is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.Our Finnish Founders - History and Heritage, Finlandia University. Accessed 2009-07-29. History Old Main Old Main, between 1900 and 1906 Finlandia Hall Suomi College was founded on September 8, 1896 by J. K. Nikander (b. 1855, Hämeenlinna, Finland, d. 1919). During the 1880s, large numbers of Finns immigrated to Hancock, Michigan to labor in the copper and lumber industries. As a mission pastor of the Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America headquartered in Hancock, Nikander observed that Swedish and Finnish immigrants along the Delaware River did not train new ministers, and he feared a loss of Finnish identity. The college's role was to preserve Finnish culture, train Lutheran ministers and teach English. During the 1920s, Suomi College became a liberal arts college and in 1958, the seminary separated from the college. On July 1, 2000, Suomi College changed its name to Finlandia University. The cornerstone of Old Main, the first building erected at Suomi College, was laid on May 30, 1898. Jacobsville sandstone, quarried at the Portage Entry of the Keweenaw waterway, was brought by barge, cut, and used to construct the Old Main. Dedicated on January 21, 1900, it contained a dormitory, kitchen, laundry, classrooms, offices, library, chapel, and lounge. The burgeoning college quickly outgrew this building. In 1901 a frame structure, housing a gym, meeting hall, and music center, was erected on an adjacent lot. The frame building was demolished when Nikander Hall, named for Suomi's founder, was constructed in 1939. The hall was designed by the architectural firm of Eliel Saarinen and J. Robert F. Swanson. In addition to Old Main, the present day main campus consists of Nikander Hall, Mannerheim Hall, Wargelin Hall, Finlandia Hall, the Paavo Nurmi Center for Physical Education, the Kivi House, Hoover Center, the Finnish American Heritage Center, the Chapel of St. Matthew, and the Jutila Center. Finlandia University has been a university of the Lutheran church since its inception. In 1988, the University became affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The curriculum, campus events, and the community explore the value of faith, vocation, and service. Finlandia University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association for Colleges and Schools (NCA-HLC). In 1996, the university transitioned from a two-year college to a four-year university. Campus Finlandia University is located in Hancock, Michigan. The town is located on the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The Peninsula stretches north into Lake Superior. Finnish American Heritage Center Also part of Finlandia University, and serving both the campus and the community, is the Finnish American Heritage Center which hosts numerous university and community events and houses a museum, art gallery, and theater. The Finnish American Historical Archives are located here. North Wind Books The Lions Den of North Wind Books offers an extensive collection of quality adult and children's fiction and nonfiction publications, and textbooks. It also sells Finnish functional design items for the home, and university logo merchandise. Athletics There are 10 varsity sports at Finlandia. Women's athletics include: basketball, ice hockey, soccer, softball and volleyball. Men's athletics include baseball, basketball, football, ice hockey and soccer.

The Basic School is at Camp Barrett, Quantico, Virginia, in the south-west of the Marine Corps Base Quantico complex. Each year over 1,700 new officers are trained, representing such commissioning sources as the U.S. Naval Academy, Officer Candidates School, and Marine Corps Limited Duty Officer (LDO) and Warrant Officer accession programs. Philosophy of instruction at TBS The School's \\"Five Horizontal Themes\\" define the expectations of every student officer at TBS.Student officer quarters completed in 2012. They are: *A Man or Woman of Exemplary Character **Has a clear understanding that a Marine commission brings with it \\"special trust and confidence\\" and the highest expectations of the American people. **Devoted to our Core Values of Honor, Courage and Commitment **Possesses a moral compass that unerringly points to \\"do the right thing\\" – an ethical warrior Gen. James F. Amos speaks to graduating Marines with Charlie Company, The Basic School (TBS), at Quantico, Va., 27 August 2014. *Devoted to Leading Marines 24/7 **Embraces the \\"exceptional and unremitting\\" responsibility to one's Marines and their families **Inspires and instills confidence in his/her Marines during times of adversity **Adheres to and enforces standards regardless of time of day, location or duty status **Treats all Marines and Sailors with dignity and respect **Dedicated to a lifetime of study and learning about the profession of arms The Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. John M. Paxton, Jr., speaks to students of Bravo Company at The Basic School in June 2014. *Able to Decide, Communicate, and Act in the fog of war **Can think critically and arrive at an acceptable decision based on sound tactical thinking within their commander's intent **Communicates clearly both orally and in writing in tactical and administrative situations with emphasis on issuing clear, meaningful orders and guidance **Has a bias for action – seizes the initiative and acts instead of waiting for the perfect sight picture or direction from higher **Once action is initiated, acts with boldness and determination *A Warfighter who embraces the Corps's warrior ethos **A competent combat leader, grounded in the basic infantry skills, and characterized by sound judgment and aggressiveness in execution **Educated in the fundamentals of maneuver warfare, tactics, combined arms, and the time- tested principles of battle **Maintains an offensive mindset throughout – proactive, not reactive *Mentally Strong and Physically Tough **Imbued with a warrior spirit and able to thrive in a complex and chaotic environment and persevere despite the obstacles to mission accomplishment **Possesses the self-discipline to push past preconceived limits Courses conducted at TBS Basic Officer Course (BOC) Introduction and background After earning a commission, new Marine Second Lieutenants (Unrestricted Line Officer Marine lieutenants) complete the Officer Basic Course prior to beginning their job specialization (Military Occupational Speciality, or MOS) training to prepare them for service in the Marine Corps at large (Fleet Marine Force or other operating forces assignments). The majority of Marine Corps officers are commissioned through the USMC Officer Candidate School (OCS), but many are also graduates of the U.S. Naval Academy, or other service academies who choose to commission with the Marine Corps instead. Restricted Line/Limited Duty Officers are direct commissioned from the chief warrant officer ranks as either a first lieutenant or captain and do not attend BOC; however, as warrant officers, they have already completed the WOBC at TBS prior to beginning their officer service in the operating forces. Most officers attend BOC as a second lieutenant immediately after commissioning at OCS or within a few months of graduation and commissioning from either the USNA or an NROTC program. Some newly commissioned officers may serve a short period of time in an interim assignment (such as an assistant athletic coach at the USNA) before beginning TBS/BOC. A few officers attend BOC as a first lieutenant because they were commissioned through the Platoon Leaders Class (PLC Law) program, which permits them to attend law school as second lieutenants and then attend TBS/BOC after promotion to first lieutenant upon receiving their law degree. In very rare cases, an officer who receives an initial commission in another branch of the US armed forces, and who has already been promoted to first lieutenant, may receive an interservice transfer to the Marine Corps and attend TBS as a first lieutenant. Course overview The Officer Basic Course currently lasts 28 weeks, during which new officers receive classroom, field, and practical application training on weapons, tactics, leadership and protocol. The course is split into three graded categories; Leadership, Academics, and Military Skills. Much like OCS, graded events are split between events that are graded, and events that must be passed. Events that must be passed are the 15 mile hike, all three exams, the Endurance Course, Final Land Navigation, Night Land Navigation, and Rifle and Pistol Qualification. Events that simply are given a grade are the 3, 6, 9, and 12 mile hikes, leadership billets in field exercises, and various decision making exercises. Classroom events include topic specific lectures, exams, tactical decision games (TDGs), sand table exercises (STEXs), decision-forcing cases, and small group discussions. There are various field events, beginning with fireteam and squad level, and progressing to platoon-reinforced and company-sized events. The field events consist of realistic blank-fire training and live fire ranges. =Phases of instruction= *Phase I (7 Weeks): Individual Skills **Leadership **Rifle and Pistol Qualification **Land Navigation **Communications **Combat Lifesaving **MCMAP *Phase II (6 Weeks): Rifle Squad Leader Skills **Decision-making **Combined Arms **Rifle Squad Tactics/Weapons **Scouting and Patrolling *Phase III (6 Weeks): Rifle Platoon Commander Skills **Rifle Platoon Tactics **Convoy Operations **Engineering **Crew-served weapons *Phase IV (7 Weeks): Basic MAGTF Officer Skills **Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain, or MOUT **Rifle Platoon (REIN) Tactics **Force Protection **Expeditionary Operations (AMFEX/\\"War\\") **Legal/Platoon Cmdr's Admin MOS selection and post BOC training and assignments Throughout the Program of Instruction (POI), Marines in each training company are split into thirds according to their combined scores of Leadership, Military Skills, and Academics. Each Marine ranks each specialization, or MOS, according to their preference, and each third is allocated an equal proportion of each specialization according to the Marine Corps' needs. Each third is independent of the others, so the top of the bottom third of placement is nearly as likely to get the specialization that they want as the top of the other two thirds. Throughout the POI, each Marine will have the opportunity to select which specialization they prefer in a mock-draft like setting, selecting what they prefer from what is leftover according to their grade placement in their third. Using these mock-drafts and listed preferences as reference, company staff then goes through each student and bestows upon them a specialization. This lottery system, however, does not apply to those Marines who signed air contracts to become pilots, or law contracts to become legal officers. Following the Basic Officer Course, the officer will attend one or more additional schools to be trained in their specialty, and then assigned to a unit in the Fleet Marine Force or other operating forces of the Marine Corps (e.g., Marine Barracks, Washington, DC, Marine Corps Chemical Biological Incident Response Force, Marine Corps Security Force Regiment, or the Marine Corps Embassy Security Group. Warrant Officer Basic Course (WOBC) Marine warrant officers attend a 16-week training regime similar in scope and instruction to the 28-week course required of second lieutenants, which is shortened due to the prior experience possessed by the newly appointed warrant officers. They are assigned to India Company at Camp Barrett. An enlisted Marine can apply for the warrant officer program after serving at least eight years of enlisted service, and reaching the grade of E-5 (Sergeant) for the administrative warrant officer program. For the Marine Warrant Officer (Gunner) program, a Marine must have at least sixteen years of enlisted service in an infantry MOS. This requirement is waived for those holding rank of (Gunnery Sergeant) for a minimum of one year prior to applying for the weapons warrant officer program. Sergeants or Staff NCOs who are selected are given additional leadership and management training during the Warrant Officer Basic Course.General Emphasizes Leadership at Warrant Officer Commissioning 2nd Lt. Patrick Boyce, 8 February 2007. Retrieved 25 January 2011. Infantry Officer Course (IOC) Graduates of the BOC who are selected for an infantry MOS remain at TBS for the twelve-week Infantry Officer Course. During this program lieutenants receive intensive classroom instruction, practical experience, and field training in crew-served weapons, patrolling, and reconnaissance to ensure that they are MOS qualified for all of the infantry platoon commander billets, in addition to the rifle platoon, within a Marine infantry battalion. The other infantry billets are: rifle company weapons platoon (i.e., crew-served weapons) commander, as well as commander of one of the three heavy-weapons platoons (viz., 81mm mortar, antiarmor, and heavy machine gun) of the infantry battalion weapons company. Infantry officers may seek to compete for a tour as a reconnaissance platoon commander after serving an initial tour with an infantry unit. Officers selected to serve in a Light Armored Reconnaissance (LAR) battalion complete an additional six-week LAR leaders course conducted at the School of Infantry.  \\"Mike\\" Company  Marines who first arrive from OCS or the USNA, or who are unable to complete the BOC, WOBC, or IOC for either failing one of the three graded categories or are significantly injured are sent to M Company, or \\"Mike Company.\\" Marines in Mike Company provide support operations for companies that are actively training, as well as attend classes and physical events, until they can be given a new MOS if they come from IOC, or resume training if they have yet to complete WOBC or BOC.

Founded in 1848, Muhlenberg is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and is named for Henry Melchior Muhlenberg, the German patriarch of the Lutheran Church in America. History Muhlenberg College was initially established in 1848 as the Allentown Seminary by Reverend Samuel K. Brobst, a Reformed Lutheran minister. Reverend Christian Rudolph Kessler was the school's first teacher and administrator. Between 1848 and 1867, the entity that is today Muhlenberg College operated as the Allentown Seminary, the Allentown Collegiate and Military Institute and the Allentown Collegiate Institute. In 1867, the college moved into Trout Hall, the former mansion of William Allen's son, James Allen, and was renamed after Henry Melchior Muhlenberg, the patriarch of the Lutheran Church in America. Muhlenberg's great-grandson, Reverend Frederick Augustus Muhlenberg, served as president of the college from 1867 to 1876. In 1905, the college purchased and relocated to a tract located in Allentown's West End, the site of today's campus. In 1910, seeing a need for evening study in the community, Muhlenberg College began offering courses through a \\"Saturday School for Teachers\\". The offerings for adult education outside of the traditional baccalaureate track evolved over the years through various titles including an \\"Extension\\" school, and in 2002 Muhlenberg opened The W. Clarke Wescoe School of Professional Studies.. With the addition of graduate degree programs the Wescoe name has been dropped. The adult education division is now known simply as The School for Graduate and Continuing Studies. Campus Muhlenberg's current campus is located in a residential neighborhood in Allentown's West End. The campus includes numerous buildings with distinctive traditional European/Protestant red doors laid out on several college quads. The central part of the park-like campus is the college green, which incorporates public art including Victor's Lament by Mark di Suvero. \\"Academic Row\\" runs the length of the main college quadrangle and is classically centered on the landmark Library Building, now the Haas College Center, which was built between 1926 and 1929. The Miller Tower, the distinctive dome and tower which sits on top of the Haas College Center, was inspired by Oxford University's Christopher Wren-designed Tom Tower. It is named for David A. Miller (Class of 1894), founder of Allentown's The Morning Call newspaper. Muhlenberg's Polling Institute teams with the Allentown Morning Call to publish surveys of preferences and trends among Pennsylvanians, especially in the Lehigh Valley. In 1988, the college opened the Harry C. Trexler library, named for local industrialist Harry Clay Trexler. The library houses over 310,000 volumes and 360,000 microforms on- campus, and has access to over 1.75 million books via interlibrary loan. It serves as a Federal Depository Library. Neighboring the Trexler Library is the Philip Johnson designed Baker Center for the Arts which houses the Martin Art Gallery. The Martin Art Gallery has a permanent collection of over 3,000 works of art and holds frequent exhibitions of pieces by student, regional, and international artists. In August, 2004, the Life Sports Center expanded by 39,000 sq. ft. including an indoor field house, gym, cafe, health classrooms and pool. In 2007, a new science building and additional residence halls were completed. In 2010, Muhlenberg College expanded their Seegers Student Union, which included expanded dining facilities which are frequently rated as having some of the best campus food in the country. In addition to the main campus, Muhlenberg maintains the Lee and Virginia Graver Arboretum approximately 25 miles away in Bushkill Township, and Raker Wildlife Preserve, a wildlife sanctuary 15 miles away in Germansville. Academics William Allen. Muhlenberg's current campus opened in 1905. Programs Muhlenberg College offers bachelor's degrees with an academic focus on a rounded Liberal Arts education as well as pre-professional studies. Approximately 85% of faculty have a Ph.D or other terminal degree in their respective fields. The Student to Faculty Ratio is 11:1 as of 2018. The college maintains chapters of over 15 national Greek Academic Honor Societies. Bachelor's degree programs for returning adult students are offered through the School of Continuing Education. Starting in Fall of 2020 graduate degrees are also offered. The college offers an accelerated programs, cross-registration between disciplines, double major, honors program, independent study, internships, Army ROTC, student-designed major, over 160 study abroad programs, teacher certification, visiting/exchange student program and a Washington semester. Program offerings are: Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, Natural Sciences. The Natural Sciences includes physics, chemistry, biological science, mathematics. Admissions and rankings About one-third (32%) of applicants were offered admission for the 2016–2017 academic year. About four-in-ten (44%) of the students accepted for the 2013–2014 freshman class were in the top 10% of their high school/prep school graduating class, 69% in the top 20% of their graduating class, and 81% in the top 30%. Three-quarters (75%) of the freshman class receive some sort of financial aid. Muhlenberg is primarily a regional college, with 72% of incoming freshmen coming from New Jersey, Pennsylvania or New York. However, Muhlenberg does receive a variety of applicants with admissions granted from the West Coast, including students from California, Oregon, and Arizona. In its 2020 rankings, U.S. News & World Report ranked the college as 72nd among national liberal arts colleges. Forbes ranked Muhlenberg 68th on their list of the best liberal arts colleges in the United States. In addition, Princeton Review lists Muhlenberg as one of the best colleges in the northeast, out of a total number of 218 chosen schools, and as of 2016, the college's theatre program was ranked No. 1 in the nation, its food 16th in the nation, and the college was chosen as one of the \\"Top 286 Green Colleges\\" in the country in collaboration with the U.S. Green Building Council. Muhlenberg College was also named as one of the Lehigh Valley's Top Workplaces in 2013. Student life There are more than 100 clubs and organizations on campus. In addition, the Muhlenberg Activity Council (MAC) is responsible for bringing events and activities to campus. The college arranges off-campus community service opportunities, as well as intramural and club sports for students. The performing arts are represented on-campus through various theatre, dance and music programs. The college's official student-run print publication is The Muhlenberg Weekly. Established in 1883, the paper is published every week while school is in session. The Muhlenberg Advocate, an online, twice-monthly publication, not affiliated with the college, was established in 2000; it has since ceased publication. The student-run radio station, WMUH, is operated year-round by both students and volunteers from the surrounding Lehigh Valley community, and is available to be streamed online from anywhere. There are five sororities affiliated with the college: Phi Mu, Phi Sigma Sigma, Delta Zeta, Alpha Chi Omega, and Theta Nu Xi, and five fraternities: Zeta Beta Tau, Alpha Tau Omega, Phi Kappa Tau, Delta Tau Delta, and Alpha Epsilon Pi. College rules stipulate that students may not pledge to join a Greek organization until their sophomore year. There is also Kappa Kappa Psi, a band service fraternity, as well as Alpha Phi Omega, a service fraternity; both of these can be pledged as freshman. Athletics Scotty Wood Stadium Muhlenberg, an NCAA Division III school, participates in 22 intercollegiate sports and competes in the Centennial Conference as well as the Eastern College Athletic Conference. The college also has club teams in ultimate frisbee and women's rugby union. Both men's and women's teams exist for: basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, tennis, and track and field. In addition, there are men's teams in baseball, football, and wrestling; women have teams for softball, field hockey and volleyball. In 2004, additional athletic facilities were built west of the field house. Updated tennis courts were built in 2003, as well as two fields in 1998 and 1997 respectively. The baseball and softball teams do not have on-campus facilities. Football Football was Muhlenberg's first official varsity sport, beginning in 1900. Doggie Julian was the head football coach at Muhlenberg from 1936–1944, with a record of 56–49–2. Julian was also the head basketball coach during this time, and was the head baseball coach from 1942–1944. In 1946, Ben Schwartzwalder became head football coach and in his first year guided the Mules to a 9–1 record and a national championship, defeating St. Bonaventure in the Tobacco Bowl. The following year, Schwartzwalder again led the Mules to a 9–1 record, with the only loss coming by one point to Temple. However, the Mules declined an invitation to the Tangerine Bowl. After Schwartzwalder departed for Syracuse in 1949, the Mules fell off the national radar until the hiring of Mike Donnelly in 1997. Despite a rough 1–9 inaugural campaign, Donnelly quickly got the team turned around. From 2000–2004, the Mules won five straight Centennial Conference championships, and thus, earned five straight postseason berths. In 2007, the Mules again won the Centennial Conference, and received another berth in the NCAA playoffs, winning their first-round game before falling in the second round. Donnelly took his team back to the playoffs by winning the Centennial Conference again in 2008, where they fell in the first round, and again in 2010, with the same result. Since the 2000 season, Muhlenberg has compiled a 66–28 overall record in the Centennial Conference, second best among all active and former members behind only Johns Hopkins University. The Muhlenberg football team have been Centennial Conference Champions 7 times in the 2000s.

It follows the life of Macon \\"Milkman\\" Dead III, an :African- American man living in Michigan, from birth to adulthood. This novel won the National Book Critics Circle Award, was chosen for Oprah Winfrey's popular book club, and was cited by the Swedish Academy in awarding Morrison the 1993 Nobel Prize in literature. In 1998, the Radcliffe Publishing Course named it the 25th best English-language novel of the 20th century.\\"Radcliffe's Rival 100 Best Novels List\\", Modern Library, 1998. Plot Song of Solomon opens with the death of Robert Smith, an insurance agent and member of The Seven Days, an organization that kills white people in retaliation for the racial killing of blacks. Smith's attempt at flight and his subsequent death function as the symbolic heralding of the birth of Macon \\"Milkman\\" Dead III. A crowd of people gather to watch the attempted flight, including Milkman's mother, Ruth, his two sisters First Corinthians and Magdalene (called Lena), his aunt Pilate, and his friend later in life, Guitar. The appearance of Smith on the roof causes Ruth to go into labor. Given the chaos that follows and the immediate need of the pregnant mother, the hospital admits her and she delivers her son, Macon Dead III—the first African-American child to be born in the hospital. The novel picks up again with Macon Dead III when he is four years old: He grows stifled, alienated, and disinterested in his home life and life in Southside. Also at four years of age, Macon is given his nickname, Milkman. Functioning as an escape from her repetitive life and loveless marriage and also as a way to feel a mothering connection to her son, Ruth still breastfeeds Milkman. One day, she is caught in the act by Freddie, one of Macon Dead Jr.'s employees, who proclaims Macon Dead III to be \\"A milkman. … Look out, womens. Here he come.\\" Pilate, a bootlegger and quasi witch-woman, becomes a central figure in the novel as Milkman grows through adolescence and into his thirties. Pilate was highly influential in Milkman's birth and conception. With her sister-in-law, Ruth Foster Dead, locked in an abusive and loveless marriage with Pilate's brother Macon Dead Jr., Pilate brews a \\"love potion\\" of sorts to coerce Macon Dead Jr. into conceiving Milkman with Ruth. Traveling up from Pennsylvania, Macon Dead sought to make a life for himself and was successful both in terms of managing real estate and in marrying Ruth, the daughter of the only black doctor in town. Their father, an illiterate farmer, is swindled into giving up his land and is subsequently murdered when he refuses to move. Fleeing, Macon and Pilate as children come across a cave that contains bags of gold. Pilate does not allow Macon to take the gold, claiming that it would be stealing and that they would be in enough trouble for killing the white man. Consequently, Macon resents his sister for the missed opportunity at riches. The two siblings parted ways shortly after the incident in the cave. Pilate wanders for a time, working in New York State as a migrant worker and again in Virginia, continually ousted by the communities for her absence of a navel. She eventually settles in a community on an island off of the coast of Virginia and there becomes pregnant with her daughter Reba. She roams for a period of about twenty years, collecting rocks from everywhere she lives, until Reba becomes pregnant with Hagar. Deciding that Hagar needs her extended family, Pilate moves her daughter and granddaughter to Michigan to be nearer her brother Macon. For Milkman, while in his teens, Pilate becomes the first glimpse into his family's past. He also forms a sexual connection with his cousin Hagar. Milkman's relationship with his family is strained, particularly towards his father. He has very little connection with his sisters and \\"Part One\\" of the novel ends with Lena admonishing Milkman for his selfishness. Milkman's relationship with his mother and father is strained by the ambiguity of truth. Macon's resentment for Ruth comes from his perception that she had an obsessive, sexual relationship with her father and her daily attempts at emasculating him. Ruth, however, maintains that the scene that Macon describes to Milkman is exaggerated by Macon, and that she was merely kissing her father's hands, a part of him that was unaffected by the illness that killed him. Additionally, Milkman becomes alienated from Hagar, whose sexual attention becomes easier to obtain the longer they are together. Milkman eventually spurns Hagar and she becomes obsessed with him, attempting to kill him once a month, but never following through. Milkman is equally alienated from the community of Southside and this alienation manifests chiefly in his relationship with Guitar, a member of the Seven Days. Guitar is a foil to Milkman. Where Milkman is stifled and disinterested, Guitar is motivated and ambitious in his pursuit of vengeance against white oppression. Where Milkman is a person missing a life to \\"risk all for,\\" Guitar continually \\"risks all\\" in his endeavors. Milkman eventually mentions to Macon the bag that hangs from the ceiling of Pilate's modest home. The bag is heavy and Pilate mentions that it contains her \\"inheritance.\\" Macon interprets \\"inheritance\\" to mean the gold that was left behind in the cave. Macon assumes that Pilate returned to the cave and claimed the gold for her own. Macon then sends Milkman and Guitar on a \\"quest\\" to steal the bag of gold from Pilate. Milkman and Guitar succeed in stealing the bag from Pilate, but are stopped by the police and arrested after the police discover that the bag contains, not gold, but human bones. Macon Dead and Pilate both go to the police station to try to free the two young men. Macon attempts to use his influence and money to persuade the police to release the men, but ultimately it is Pilate who frees them by acting like a worn-out, subservient, old black woman even though Milkman has never seen his aunt as anything less than tall, strong, and commanding. For Guitar, Pilate's performance elicits hatred toward her and deepens his misogyny. \\"Part Two\\" of the novel positions Milkman making a journey south to Pennsylvania in search of the gold that must still be in the cave. There he meets the Reverend Cooper who knew Milkman's father when he lived near Danville as a boy. Cooper shares tales of Macon Dead that surprise Milkman and begin the connection between Milkman and his past. He eventually finds the land where his grandfather lived and an old house that stands upon it. There he encounters Circe, an impossibly old ex-servant of the Butler family who has outlived their last descendant to view the collapse of the family and their estate. She relates the tale of Macon Dead Sr.'s body washing up from his grave and being moved to the cave where Macon Dead's children found the gold. She also tells Milkman of a Native American woman named Sing and a black man whom she married named Jake. Milkman leaves and finds the cave but no gold and only one human skeleton where there should have been two. He deduces that Pilate must have retrieved the gold and taken it to Virginia where they had ancestors, so he sets off in search of it. Milkman stumbles across Shalimar, Virginia, by accident. While out hunting with some older men from Shalimar, Milkman is attacked by Guitar who has followed him to Virginia. Guitar is under the impression that Milkman has taken the gold and shipped it away and thus wants revenge. Struggling, Milkman discharges his gun, missing Guitar and scaring him off. The hunters return and Milkman tells them that he discharged his gun by accident, never mentioning that his friend had just tried to murder him. Shortly thereafter, Milkman is told of the Byrd house. There he can find a woman, Susan, who might be able to connect the fragments of Milkman's ancestry. Once more, the woman named Sing whom Circe mentioned earlier is spoken of to Milkman and he feels that he is getting closer to discovering his family history. When Milkman goes to the Byrd house the first time, he is offered little information. He leaves the house, wary that Guitar is stalking him in the woods somewhere, but he promises to visit again. On his way back to town he encounters Guitar, who claims that Milkman took the gold for himself and Milkman, explains that there never was any gold and that he did not take it. Guitar does not believe Milkman. The following day, Milkman observes the children of the town playing and singing the \\"Song of Solomon.\\" Milkman hears the song for the first time and remembers that Pilate sang a similar song back in Michigan. Milkman begins to piece together what little he knows about his family history and the history of the song. Eventually, it dawns on him that the song is about his family. He later returns to the Byrd house and is able to confirm his suspicions through the information that Susan relates. After this, he heads back to Michigan to find Pilate. While Milkman is gone in Virginia, Hagar has sunk into a terrible depression from him having spurned her earlier. She eventually catches a glimpse of herself in a mirror and comes alive again, thinking that if she fixes herself up then Milkman would want her. Pilate and Reba scrape up money and Hagar spends it on dresses, makeup, and a haircut. The effort amounts to little, and Hagar succumbs to her grief. A collection is taken up by the community to bury Hagar, and Pilate sings a mournful song at her granddaughter's funeral. Milkman thinks it only appropriate that Macon Dead Sr. be finally laid to rest in his ancestral home in Shalimar. Milkman finds Pilate at her home and is greeted by her knocking him unconscious as repayment for the grief that caused her granddaughter to die. When he comes to, Milkman convinces her to travel with him to Virginia and bury her father. They make the journey and decide to bury Macon Dead Sr. overlooking the ravine. After placing the bones in the grave, Pilate is killed by a gunshot from Guitar that was intended for Milkman. The novel ends with Milkman leaping toward Guitar for a final battle. The novel leaves the outcome unresolved, but finally it seems that Milkman has learned to \\"fly.\\" Setting The novel is set mostly in a fictional town in Michigan, where the protagonist lives; in Danville, Pennsylvania, where Milkman's paternal grandfather lived and was killed and where Milkman learns the story of his family; and in Virginia, a little town named Shalimar, where his ancestors are from. The events take place mostly between the 1930s and 1963, but there is also reference to the 19th-century lifetime of Milkman's grand and great-grandfathers, Jake, real name of Macon Dead I and Solomon. Style Song of Solomon is a multicultural text, with elements of Native American culture being intertwined with African- American culture in Shalimar, Virginia. Equally, Morrison employs Islamic imagery in the actual \\"Song of Solomon\\", including in the \\"nonsense\\" language of the song. Note in the second line of the fourth quatrain the words \\"Medina\\" and \\"Muhammet\\". Medina is a holy city in Islam, second perhaps only to Mecca, and Muhammet is an allusion to Muhammad, the Islamic prophet.  Genres  Like all the other works of Toni Morrison, the novel is an example of both American literature and African-American literature. It challenges the question of African-American identity and relationships among African Americans and between black and white individuals and communities. The main conflict of the novel is Milkman's search for ways to become independent from his family, to gain self-realization, and to answer the questions of who he is, how he lives, and why. Reception The novel, Morrison's third, was met with widespread acclaim, and Morrison earned the National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction in 1978. The novel has faced several challenges and bans in schools throughout the U.S. since 1993.\\"Banned and/or Challenged Books from the Radcliffe Publishing Course Top 100 Novels of the 20th Century\\", American Library Association.

It is also a member of the Council of Independent Colleges, the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, the Lutheran Educational Conference of North America, the South Carolina Association of Colleges and Universities, the South Carolina Independent Colleges and Universities, and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (Division II). Athletics Men's athletic teams: Women's athletic teams: Newberry College has a diverse line-up in men's and women's sports including baseball, basketball, cheerleading, cross country, football, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, volleyball, and wrestling. The college is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division II and the South Atlantic Conference (SAC). The school is famous for being on the losing end of a tilt against Furman University, in which Frank Selvy scored 100 points. Music program The music program at Newberry College has a history in vocal and instrumental performance dating back over 100 years, and a jazz band and marching band in existence since 1956. In 1956, a major turning point in the school's musical history took place, when respected military band leader and alumnus Charles \\"Chief\\" Pruitt organized the jazz band and the marching band after returning to the school to teach music. The Newberry College marching band, which has been in existence since that time, is one of the most unusual aspects of Newberry College's music program. Newberry is one of the smallest colleges in the country with a marching band, and it is the only Lutheran school in the country with a marching band. Also in 1956, Pruitt hosted the first jazz festival at Newberry College. This jazz festival has since become a unique annual tradition at Newberry College, and is considered to be the second oldest jazz festival in the nation. V-12: Navy College Training Program In 1943, Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox announced the start of a new college training program, the V-12 Navy College Training Program. The program was designed to supplement the force of commissioned officers in the United States Navy during World War II. Newberry College became one of 131 colleges and universities in the United States chosen to participate in the V-12 program. On July 1, 1943, the first 325 cadets arrived on campus; they included both V-12 Cadets and V-5 Aviation Cadets. The cadets attended classes for periods of one to six terms of 16 weeks. Work was planned so that each term was the equivalent of a normal college semester. The Navy handled the discipline of its cadets, directed the physical fitness program, provided military drills and cooperated with the College in the direction of the program. During the 27 months the V-12 Program were a part of the college, over 1,000 cadets were assigned to Newberry. On October 31, 1945, the V-12 Unit was decommissioned and Newberry College returned to its civilian status. US Air Force ROTC Program From 1972 until 1976, the United States Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (Detachment 777) was established at Newberry. Through this program, selected students were commissioned as second lieutenants in the USAF and many served distinguished careers in the service of their nation. In addition to Det. 777, an Arnold Air Society and an Angel Flight program was also active during this period. Due to the manning authorization of the Air Force following the Vietnam War, Detachment 777 of Newberry College was deactivated.  US Army ROTC Program  South Carolina Science Olympiad Newberry College hosted the annual South Carolina Science Olympiad competition for 33 years in a row, from 1985 to 2018.

It can be used to check that data transmissions in the form of packets, conform to defined limits on bandwidth and burstiness (a measure of the unevenness or variations in the traffic flow). It can also be used as a scheduling algorithm to determine the timing of transmissions that will comply with the limits set for the bandwidth and burstiness: see network scheduler.  Overview  The token bucket algorithm is based on an analogy of a fixed capacity bucket into which tokens, normally representing a unit of bytes or a single packet of predetermined size, are added at a fixed rate. When a packet is to be checked for conformance to the defined limits, the bucket is inspected to see if it contains sufficient tokens at that time. If so, the appropriate number of tokens, e.g. equivalent to the length of the packet in bytes, are removed (\\"cashed in\\"), and the packet is passed, e.g., for transmission. The packet does not conform if there are insufficient tokens in the bucket, and the contents of the bucket are not changed. Non-conformant packets can be treated in various ways: * They may be dropped. * They may be enqueued for subsequent transmission when sufficient tokens have accumulated in the bucket. * They may be transmitted, but marked as being non-conformant, possibly to be dropped subsequently if the network is overloaded. A conforming flow can thus contain traffic with an average rate up to the rate at which tokens are added to the bucket, and have a burstiness determined by the depth of the bucket. This burstiness may be expressed in terms of either a jitter tolerance, i.e. how much sooner a packet might conform (e.g. arrive or be transmitted) than would be expected from the limit on the average rate, or a burst tolerance or maximum burst size, i.e. how much more than the average level of traffic might conform in some finite period.  Algorithm  The token bucket algorithm can be conceptually understood as follows: *A token is added to the bucket every 1/r seconds. *The bucket can hold at the most b tokens. If a token arrives when the bucket is full, it is discarded. *When a packet (network layer PDU) of n bytes arrives, **if at least n tokens are in the bucket, n tokens are removed from the bucket, and the packet is sent to the network. **if fewer than n tokens are available, no tokens are removed from the bucket, and the packet is considered to be non-conformant.  Variations  Implementers of this algorithm on platforms lacking the clock resolution necessary to add a single token to the bucket every 1/r seconds may want to consider an alternative formulation. Given the ability to update the token bucket every S milliseconds, the number of tokens to add every S milliseconds = (r*S)/1000.  Properties   Average rate  Over the long run the output of conformant packets is limited by the token rate, r.  Burst size  Let M be the maximum possible transmission rate in bytes/second. Then T_\\\\text{max} = \\\\begin{cases} b/(M -r) & \\\\text{ if } r < M \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\infty & \\\\text{ otherwise } \\\\end{cases} is the maximum burst time, that is the time for which the rate M is fully utilized. The maximum burst size is thus B_\\\\text{max} = T_\\\\text{max}*M  Uses  The token bucket can be used in either traffic shaping or traffic policing. In traffic policing, nonconforming packets may be discarded (dropped) or may be reduced in priority (for downstream traffic management functions to drop if there is congestion). In traffic shaping, packets are delayed until they conform. Traffic policing and traffic shaping are commonly used to protect the network against excess or excessively bursty traffic, see bandwidth management and congestion avoidance. Traffic shaping is commonly used in the network interfaces in hosts to prevent transmissions being discarded by traffic management functions in the network.  Comparison to leaky bucket  The token bucket algorithm is directly comparable to one of the two versions of the leaky bucket algorithm described in the literature. This comparable version of the leaky bucket is described on the relevant Wikipedia page as the leaky bucket algorithm as a meter. This is a mirror image of the token bucket, in that conforming packets add fluid, equivalent to the tokens removed by a conforming packet in the token bucket algorithm, to a finite capacity bucket, from which this fluid then drains away at a constant rate, equivalent to the process in which tokens are added at a fixed rate. There is, however, another version of the leaky bucket algorithm, described on the relevant Wikipedia page as the leaky bucket algorithm as a queue. This is a special case of the leaky bucket as a meter, which can be described by the conforming packets passing through the bucket. The leaky bucket as a queue is therefore applicable only to traffic shaping, and does not, in general, allow the output packet stream to be bursty, i.e. it is jitter free. It is therefore significantly different from the token bucket algorithm. These two versions of the leaky bucket algorithm have both been described in the literature under the same name. This has led to considerable confusion over the properties of that algorithm and its comparison with the token bucket algorithm. However, fundamentally, the two algorithms are the same, and will, if implemented correctly and given the same parameters, see exactly the same packets as conforming and nonconforming. Hierarchical token bucket The hierarchical token bucket (HTB) is a faster replacement for the class-based queueing (CBQ) queuing discipline in Linux. It is useful to limit a client's download/upload rate so that the limited client cannot saturate the total bandwidth. Conceptually, HTB is an arbitrary number of token buckets arranged in a hierarchy. The primary egress queuing discipline (qdisc) on any device is known as the root qdisc. The root qdisc will contain one class. This single HTB class will be set with two parameters, a rate and a ceil. These values should be the same for the top-level class, and will represent the total available bandwidth on the link. In HTB, rate means the guaranteed bandwidth available for a given class and ceil is short for ceiling, which indicates the maximum bandwidth that class is allowed to consume. Any bandwidth used between rate and ceil is borrowed from a parent class, hence the suggestion that rate and ceil be the same in the top-level class. Hierarchical Token Bucket implements a classful queuing mechanism for the linux traffic control system, and provides rate and ceil to allow the user to control the absolute bandwidth to particular classes of traffic as well as indicate the ratio of distribution of bandwidth when extra bandwidth become available(up to ceil). When choosing the bandwidth for a top-level class, traffic shaping only helps at the bottleneck between the LAN and the Internet.

The Glossary of American football article also covers many terms that are also used in the Canadian version of the game. ; Canadian Football League : The largest professional Canadian football league, with 9 teams split into two divisions each (West and East). ; Canadian Junior Football League : The largest non- professional minor junior football league in Canada. ; conversion : An untimed down awarded to a team that has just scored a touchdown. The scoring team receives possession on the opponent's 5-yard line. A place kick or drop kick through the uprights is worth 1 point; a play from scrimmage that would result in an offensive touchdown at other times in the game is worth 2 points. (This play is formally called a \\"try\\" in American football, but the terms \\"conversion\\", \\"PAT\\" [point after touchdown], and \\"point after\\" are more commonly used; the scrimmage play is called a \\"two-point conversion\\".) ; convert : see: conversion. ; cornerback : A defensive position on scrimmages. Typical formations include two cornerbacks, whose main duty is to cover wide receivers. See also defensive back. ; defensive back : One of the players whose main duty is to cover wide receivers. Typical defensive formations include five defensive backs: two cornerbacks, two defensive halfbacks, and one safety. ; defensive end : See defensive lineman. ; defensive halfback : A defensive position on scrimmages. Typical formations include two defensive halfbacks, one on each side, but deeper than the cornerbacks. Their main duty is to cover wide receivers. See also defensive back. ; defensive lineman : One of the players who line up opposite the offensive line on scrimmages. In a \\"four-three\\" formation, there are four defensive linemen: two defensive tackles and two defensive ends. In a \\"three-four\\" formation, there are three defensive linemen: one nose tackle and two defensive ends. ; defensive tackle : See defensive lineman. ; dribbled ball : A dribbled ball is one that has been kicked while not in possession of a player, for example, a loose ball following a fumble, a blocked kick, a kickoff, or a kick from scrimmage. The kicker of the dribbled ball and any player onside when the ball was kicked may legally recover the ball. ; illegal procedure : A five-yard penalty against the kicking team or the offence. Most often it is a lineman who moves after taking a three- or four-point stance but before the snap. Other illegal procedures include kicking the ball out of bounds on a kick-off and \\"no end\\". ; linebacker : A defensive player positioned behind the defensive line on scrimmages. In a \\"four-three\\" formation, there are three linebackers; in a \\"three-four\\", there are four. Linebackers can be used to blitz the quarterback, make tackles on running plays, or be used for pass coverage. ; major or major score : An alternate term for touchdown. ; no end : A penalty on the offence for having fewer than seven players within one yard of the line of scrimmage at the snap. It is most often called on field goal attempts because of the curved formation of linemen used: if the line is curved back too far, the ends are too far back to be considered linemen, and are called for \\"illegal procedure: no end\\". (This violation is known as an \\"illegal formation\\" in the American game.) ; nose tackle : See defensive lineman. ; no yards : A penalty against the kicking team: all offside (sense 2) players must be at least five yards from the ball when it is first touched by a member of the receiving team. In amateur rules, no yards is always a 15-yard penalty; in CFL rules, the penalty is reduced to five yards if the ball hits the ground before being touched. ; offside : Not onside. A player not onside incurs a five-yard penalty. ; onside # Legally positioned at the kick-off or the snap. On kick-offs, members of the kicking team must be behind the kick-off line; members of the receiving team must be at least 10 yards from the kick-off line. On scrimmages, at the snap the offence must be behind the line of scrimmage; the defence must be at least one yard beyond the line of scrimmage. # A player of the kicking team who can legally recover the kick. The kicker and any teammates behind the ball at the time of the kick are onside. Thus on kick-offs all players of the kicking team are onside, but on other kicks usually only the kicker is. The holder on a place kick is not considered onside. ; onside kick : A kick recovered by an onside player (sense 2). ; pivot : An alternate term for the quarterback. ; quick kick : A type of trick play: a punt from a running or passing formation, usually on second down. The play relies on catching the defence by surprise and using an onside player (sense 2) to recover the ball and gain a first down or even a touchdown. A rule change in the early 1970s that allowed the receiving team to block before gaining possession made the quick kick even more difficult to execute successfully, so it is rarely attempted today. ; rouge : see: single. ; safety #A defensive position on scrimmages, also called free safety. Typical formations include a single safety, whose main duty is to cover wide receivers. See also defensive back. #A two-point score. The defence scores a safety when the offence carries or passes the ball into its own goal area and then fails to run, pass, or kick the ball back into the field of play; when this term is used in this sense, it is also referred to as a safety touch. ; short kick-off : Deliberately kicking the ball just over 10 yards on a kick- off in an attempt to make an onside kick. Short kick-offs are usually directed towards the sideline (left sideline for a right-footed kicker) to give members of the kicking team time to get downfield to recover it. It is illegal procedure if the ball is recovered before it has gone 10 yards downfield. ; single : A one-point score. The kicking team scores a single when the ball is punted, drop kicked, or place kicked into the receiving team's end zone (without scoring a field goal or hitting the goal post) and the receiving team fails to run or kick the ball back into the field of play. The single also is scored if the kick goes out of bounds in the end zone, except on a kickoff. On a kickoff, the single is scored only if the ball stays inbounds and is not run out of the zone, or if the defence puts the ball out of bounds in the end zone. ; spearing : An unnecessary roughness penalty of 15 yards imposed when the player drives his helmet into an opponent in an unnecessary and excessive manner. The referee's signal is a chopping motion above the head. ; third down : The final of a set of three downs. Unless a first down is achieved or a penalty forces a replay of the down, the team will lose control of the ball after this play. If a team does not think they can get a first down, they often punt on third down or attempt a field goal if they are close enough to do so. ; three-minute warning : In the Canadian Football League, the three- minute warning is given when three minutes of game time remain on the game clock in the first and second halves of a game. ; third down conversion The act of using a third down play to make a first down (also known as \\"going for it [on third down]\\"). These are comparatively uncommon. If a team is close enough to the goal posts, they will generally attempt a field goal on fourth down. Otherwise, they will usually punt. However, the coach may elect to try to get a new first down. This is more likely if the amount of yardage needed for the conversion is small (typically a yard or less), if the team is trailing by a significant amount (likelihood of such a try increasing as it gets later in the game), if a team is in a position on the field where a punt would likely result in a single point for them but a field goal attempt is unlikely to succeed (usually between the opponent's 40- and 50-yard lines) or during overtime where the team must score on that possession. ; time count : A foul committed when the offence fails to put the ball in play within 20 seconds of the ball being declared ready for play. (This foul is called \\"delay of game\\" in American football.) Penalty: Before the three-minute warning and during convert attempts at any time in the game, 5 yards with the down repeated. After the three-minute warning, loss of down on first or second down and 10 yards on third down; the referee has the right to give possession to the defence for repeated time count violations on third down. ; U Sports: The principal governing body of college sports in Canada, including college football. The organization has been formerly known as the Canadian Interuniversity Athletic Union, Canadian Interuniversity Athletics Union, and Canadian Interuniversity Sport. ; yard : A yard is exactly 0.9144 metre. Despite Canada having mostly migrated to the metric system in the 1970s, the field in Canadian football remains measured in yards (as is the field in American football).

Founded in 1883 and with an enrollment of approximately 2,200 students, Wagner is known for its academic program, the Wagner Plan for the Practical Liberal Arts. It is regionally accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.  History  Wagner College was founded in 1883 in Rochester, New York, as the Lutheran Proseminary of Rochester. Its purpose was to prepare young men for admission to Lutheran seminaries and to ensure that they were sufficiently fluent in both English and German to minister to the large German immigrant community of that day. The school's six-year curriculum (covering the high-school and junior-college years) was modeled on the German gymnasium curriculum. In 1886, the school was renamed Wagner Memorial Lutheran College, after a building in Rochester was purchased for its use by John G. Wagner in memory of his son. The college moved to the 38-acre (15 ha) former Cunard estate on Grymes Hill, Staten Island, in 1918. An Italianate villa called Westwood, the Cunard mansion (circa 1851), is extant (now Cunard Hall), as is the neighboring former hotel annex that was built in 1905 (initially named North Hall, now called Reynolds House). The college soon expanded to 57 acres (23 ha) after it acquired the neighboring Jacob Vanderbilt estate in 1922. In the 1920s, the curriculum began to move toward an American-style liberal arts curriculum that was solidified when the state of New York granted the college degree-granting status in 1928. The college admitted women in 1933 and introduced graduate programs in 1951. The college expanded further when it purchased the W.G. Ward estate in 1949 (current site of Wagner College Stadium), and again in 1993, when the college acquired the adjacent property of the former Augustinian Academy, which has largely remained wooded green space and athletic fields. The college now occupies 105 acres (42 ha) on the hill and has commanding views of the New York Harbor, the Verrazano Bridge, Downtown Brooklyn, and Lower Manhattan.  New York City Writers Conference  From 1956 through the late 1960s, Wagner College was the home of the New York City Writers Conference, which brought some of the leading lights of the literary world to campus each summer. Instructors included Saul Bellow, Robert Lowell, Edward Albee, Kay Boyle and Kenneth Koch. From 1961 to 1963, while English professor Willard Maas directed the conference, it served as a training ground for the poets of the New York School. Maas himself was a significant figure in the New York avant-garde world of the 1950s and 1960s; Edward Albee used Maas and his wife, experimental filmmaker Marie Menken, as the models for his lead characters in the early masterwork, “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” The Stanley Drama Award, which began as a prize given at the conclusion of the NYC Writers Conference, has provided encouragement for several notable playwrights, including: Terrence McNally for “This Side of the Door” (1962), an early version of “And Things that Go Bump in the Night”; Adrienne Kennedy for “Funnyhouse of a Negro” (1963); Lonne Elder III for an early version of “The Ceremonies in Dark Old Men” (1965), and Jonathan Larson in 1993 for an early version of “Rent.”  Campus  Early 20th century postcard Prominent early buildings include Cunard Hall (ca. 1851); Reynolds House (1905); Kairos House (1918), a Craftsman Style cottage; and Main Hall (1930, restored 2012) and Parker Hall (1923), built in the Collegiate Gothic style. Main Hall provides classroom and office space and a theater auditorium. Parker Hall, first built as a dormitory, is used for faculty offices. Two cottages built in the early 1920s provide administrative space for the college's Public Safety and Lifelong Learning offices. Three dormitory facilities were constructed during the college's major building drive: Guild Hall (1951), Parker Towers (1964) and Harbor View Hall (1969), later complemented by Foundation Hall (2010), a residence hall for upperclassmen. About two-thirds of undergraduates live on campus. Another dormitory building, Campus Hall (1957), now provides classroom and office space. The Horrmann Library (1961) contains over 200,000 volumes and holds the collection and personal papers of poet Edwin Markham. The Megerle Science Building and Spiro Hall were opened in 1968, followed by the Wagner Union in 1970. Two building projects have expanded earlier structures. In 1999, a dramatic expansion of the 1951 Sutter Gymnasium created the modern Spiro Sports Center. And in 2002, a pair of Prairie Style cottages constructed around 1905 were refurbished and joined by a bridge building into Pape Admissions House. Three substantial resources on the physical history of the Wagner College campus have been published: #Founding Faces & Places: An Illustrated History Of Wagner Memorial Lutheran College, 1869–1930,\\" first published for Wagner College's 125th anniversary commemoration in 2008, #Wagner College Memories: A Photographic Remembrance of Grymes Hill\\" (2011), and #Wagner College History Tour,\\" a three-part series published in the Winter 2015–2016, Fall 2016 and Summer 2017 issues of Wagner Magazine.  Admission and tuition  About 88% of incoming students graduated in the top half of their high school classes, about 50% in the top quarter, and about 25% in the top tenth. The average incoming SAT score for critical reading is 540–620, math 530–630. The average incoming ACT score is between 23 and 30. The average high school grade point average of incoming students is 3.45. Important admissions factors are class rank, rigor of secondary school record, academic GPA, application essay, extracurricular activities, recommendations, and standardized test scores. Tuition, fees, and room and board for full-time undergraduate students (9 units) during the 2018–2019 academic year was $61,214. About 87% of students receive financial aid. Wagner College offers various academic and athletic scholarships. Rankings Wagner College's ranking in the 2020 edition of Best Colleges by US News & World Report is Regional Universities North, tied for #32.  Athletics  Wagner College offers athletic scholarships and competes at the NCAA Division I level in all intercollegiate athletics. (Football competes at the NCAA Division I FCS (Formerly I-AA) level.) Wagner is a full-time member of the Northeast Conference along with Bryant University, Central Connecticut State University, Fairleigh Dickinson University, Long Island University, Mount Saint Mary's University, Robert Morris University, Sacred Heart University, Saint Francis College and Saint Francis University. (In September 2018, Merrimack College accepted an invitation from the NEC's Council of Presidents to become the league's 11th member and will become a full member of the conference in 2023 upon completion of its four-year NCAA Division I reclassification period.) Men's varsity intercollegiate teams are fielded in 10 sports: baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, lacrosse, tennis, and track & field (indoor and outdoor) and men's water polo, which was established in fall 2016. Women's varsity intercollegiate teams are fielded in 14 sports: basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field (indoor and outdoor), and water polo, in addition to three newly added sports in fencing (2016), triathlon (2018) and field hockey, which was reinstated in 2018 and will compete in 2019. Walt Hameline, in 38 years (1982–present) as the director of athletics and 34 years as head football coach at Wagner (1981–2014), won the school's only National Championship with a 19–3 victory over the University of Dayton in the 1987 NCAA Division III Championship game (also known as the 1987 Stagg Bowl). He was named NCAA Division III Coach of the Year in 1987. During his 34-year coaching career, Hameline amassed an all-time record of 223–139–2 (.615) at Wagner College. Upon his retirement as head football coach following the 2014 regular season, those 223 victories ranked fifth among active head Football Championship Subdivision head coaches and remains in the top 10 among all Division I-FCS coaches in the United States. Notable Wagner sports coaches of the past include former Seton Hall University, NBA head coach and current TV analyst P.J. Carlesimo (head basketball coach 1976–1982), former Marquette University and Wagner head coach Mike Deane, Jim Lee Howell (head football coach 1947–1953), and current University of Florida head football coach Dan Mullen (assistant football coach 1994–1995). In 2019, two NFL coaches who had previously been Wagner assistant coaches were elevated to defensive coordinator positions. Lou Anarumo now heads the Cincinnati Bengals' defense, while Patrick Graham was formerly defensive coordinator for the Miami Dolphins. The football team's home venue is Hameline Field (designated in 2012) at Wagner College Stadium, while the basketball teams play their home games in the Spiro Sports Center's Sutter Gymnasium. Wagner has the distinction of producing six consecutive NEC Student-Athlete of the Year winners (2013–2018).

It had its beginnings as a cloth canopy, but in other cases it is a sturdy, permanent architectural feature, particularly over high altars in cathedrals, where such a structure is more correctly called a ciborium when it is sufficiently architectural in form.Baldachins are often supported on columns, especially when they are disconnected from an enclosing wall. A cloth of honour is a simpler cloth hanging vertically behind the throne, usually continuing to form a canopy. It can also be used for similar canopies in interior design, for example above beds, and for processional canopies used in formal state ceremonies such as coronations, held up by four or more men with poles attached to the corners of the cloth. \\"Baldachin\\" was originally a luxurious type of cloth from Baghdad, from which name the word is derived, in English as \\"baudekin\\" and other spellings. Matthew Paris records that Henry III of England wore a robe \\"de preciosissimo baldekino\\" at a ceremony at Westminster Abbey in 1247.Richard Ettinghausen et al., The Art and Architecture of Islam: 650-1250, 1987, Yale University Press (Yale/Penguin History of Art) The word for the cloth became the word for the ceremonial canopies made from the cloth. Canopies of state In the Middle Ages, a hieratic canopy of state (or \\"estate\\"), cloth of honour, or cloth of state was hung above the seat of a personage of sufficient standing, as a symbol of authority. The seat under such a canopy of state would normally be raised on a dais. The cloth above a seat generally continued vertically down to the ground behind the seat. Emperors and kings, reigning dukes and bishops were accorded this honour. In a 15th-century manuscript illumination the sovereign Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller in Rhodes sits in state to receive a presentation copy of the author's book. His seat is raised on a carpet-covered dais and backed with a richly embroidered dosser (French, \\"dos\\"). Under his feet is a cushion, such as protected the feet of the King of France when he presided at a lit de justice. The King of France was also covered by a mobile canopy during his Coronation, held up on poles by several Peers of France. The Virgin Mary in particular, is very often shown sitting under a cloth of honour in medieval and Renaissance paintings where she is shown enthroned with saints. The cloth was often simply a luxurious textile, often imported and with rich patterns, as in brocades, but might have heraldic elements. French kings are often shown with blue cloths patterned with the gold fleur-de-lys. Margaret Beaufort, mother of Henry VII in her portrait by an anonymous artist, c. 1500 prays under a canopy of estate; one can see the dosser against the gilded leather wall-covering and the tester above her head (the Tudor rose at its center) supported on cords from the ceiling. The coats-of-arms embroidered or woven into the tapestry are of England (parted as usual with France) and the portcullis badge of the Beauforts. Sometimes, as in the presentation miniature Jean Wauquelin presenting his 'Chroniques de Hainaut' to Philip the Good by Rogier van der Weyden, the cloth continues over the seat, and then to the floor. In the summer of 1520, a meeting was staged between Francis I of France and Henry VIII of England, where the ostentatious display of wealth and power earned the meeting-place the name of The Field of Cloth of Gold. The canopy of estate may still be seen in most formal throne rooms.  State bed  The state bed, intended for receiving important visitors and producing heirs before a select public, but not intended for sleeping in,Peter K. Thornton, Authentic Decor: the Domestic Interior 1620-1920, (London, 1985) and Seventeenth-Century Interior Decoration in England, France and Holland, (New Haven & London, 1981). evolved during the second half of the seventeenth century, developing the medieval tradition of receiving visitors in the bedroom, which had become the last and most private room of the standard suite of rooms in a Baroque apartment. Louis XIV developed the rituals of receptions in his state bedchamber, the petit lever to which only a handful of his court élite might expect to be invited. The other monarchs of Europe soon imitated his practice; even his staunchest enemy, William III of England, had his \\"grooms of the bedchamber\\", a signal honour. The state bed, a lit à la Duchesse--its canopy supported without visible posts-- was delivered for the use of Queen Marie Leszczyńska at Versailles, as the centrepiece of a new decor realized for the Queen in 1730-35\\\\. Its tester is quickly recognizable as a baldachin, serving its time-honoured function; the bedding might easily be replaced by a gilded throne. The queens of France spent a great deal of time in their chambre, where they received the ladies of the court at the morning lever and granted private audiences. By the time Marie Antoinette escaped the mob from this bedroom, such state beds, with the elaborate etiquette they embodied, were already falling out of use. A state bed with a domed tester designed in 1775-76 by Robert Adam for Lady Child at Osterley Park and another domed state bed, delivered by Thomas Chippendale for Sir Edwin Lascelles at Harewood House, Yorkshire in 1773Annabel Westman and Aasha Tyrrell, \\"The Restoration of the Harewood State Bed\\" (on-line ) are two of the last English state beds intended for a main floor State Bedroom in a non-royal residence.  St. Peter's Basilica  Bernini's \\"Baldacchino\\" in St Peter's, Rome Pope Urban VIII commissioned Gian Lorenzo Bernini to design and construct a large structure that would be placed over the main altar, believed to be above the tomb of Saint Peter, in the new St. Peter's Basilica. The canopy imitated cloth in bronze, as did many subsequent imitations. This famous and spectacular feature is generally called the \\"Baldacchino\\", though strictly it is a ciborium. Bernini's design for the Baldacchino incorporated giant solomonic columns inspired by columns that ringed the altar of the Old St. Peter's. These columns were originally donated by Constantine, and a false tradition asserts they are the columns from the Temple of Jerusalem. The lowest parts of the four columns of Bernini's Baldachin have a helical groove, and the middle and upper sections of the columns are covered in olive and bay branches, which are populated with a myriad of bees and small putti. Pope Urban VIII's family coat of arms, those of the Barberini family, with their signature bees, are at the base of every column. All of these combine to create a feeling of upward movement.  Processional canopy  Victorious royal entry by King Louis XII of France into Genoa, after a siege. Miniature by Jean Bourdichon, c. 1508 A baldachin may also be used in formal processions, including Royal entries, coronation or funeral processions, to signify the elite status of the individual it covers. The origins of such an emblematic use in Europe lay in the courts of the Neo-Assyrian state, adopted in Athens perhaps as early as the late seventh century BC, but relegated to the use of women by the late fifth century (compare parasol).M. C. Miller, \\"The Parasol: An Oriental Status-Symbol in Late Archaic and Classical Athens,\\" The Journal of Hellenic Studies, 112 (1992) 91-105. Such canopies might be made of anything from muslin to heavy brocade, or even constructed of less flexible materials, and are supported by poles, whether affixed to a carriage, or carried by people walking on each side. An Egyptian Pharaoh, for example, was escorted both in life and in death by such a canopy of estate. Francisco Franco, the ruler of Spain from 1939 to 1975, frequently walked under a baldachin after formally proclaiming Spain a monarchy—a privilege he appropriated as de facto regent for life.  Surname Baldacchino  The surname Baldacchino comes from the artisans who used to make the Baldachin. The surname is found mainly in the islands of Malta and Sicily, particularly in Agrigento and Naro.

Mammals possess four different notch receptors, referred to as NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3, and NOTCH4. The notch receptor is a single-pass transmembrane receptor protein. It is a hetero-oligomer composed of a large extracellular portion, which associates in a calcium-dependent, non-covalent interaction with a smaller piece of the notch protein composed of a short extracellular region, a single transmembrane-pass, and a small intracellular region. Notch signaling promotes proliferative signaling during neurogenesis, and its activity is inhibited by Numb to promote neural differentiation. It plays a major role in the regulation of embryonic development.  Discovery  In 1914, John S. Dexter noticed the appearance of a notch in the wings of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The alleles of the gene were identified in 1917 by American evolutionary biologist Thomas Hunt Morgan. Its molecular analysis and sequencing was independently undertaken in the 1980s by Spyros Artavanis-Tsakonas and Michael W. Young. Alleles of the two C. elegans Notch genes were identified based on developmental phenotypes: lin-12 and glp-1. The cloning and partial sequence of lin-12 was reported at the same time as Drosophila Notch by Iva Greenwald.  Mechanism of action  The Notch protein spans the cell membrane, with part of it inside and part outside. Ligand proteins binding to the extracellular domain induce proteolytic cleavage and release of the intracellular domain, which enters the cell nucleus to modify gene expression. The cleavage model was first proposed in 1993 based on work done with Drosophila Notch and C. elegans lin-12, informed by the first oncogenic mutation affecting a human Notch gene. Compelling evidence for this model was provided in 1998 by in vivo analysis in Drosophila by Gary Struhl and in cell culture by Raphael Kopan. Although this model was initially disputed, the evidence in favor of the model was irrefutable by 2001. The receptor is normally triggered via direct cell-to-cell contact, in which the transmembrane proteins of the cells in direct contact form the ligands that bind the notch receptor. The Notch binding allows groups of cells to organize themselves such that, if one cell expresses a given trait, this may be switched off in neighbouring cells by the intercellular notch signal. In this way, groups of cells influence one another to make large structures. Thus, lateral inhibition mechanisms are key to Notch signaling. lin-12 and Notch mediate binary cell fate decisions, and lateral inhibition involves feedback mechanisms to amplify initial differences. The Notch cascade consists of Notch and Notch ligands, as well as intracellular proteins transmitting the notch signal to the cell's nucleus. The Notch/Lin-12/Glp-1 receptor family was found to be involved in the specification of cell fates during development in Drosophila and C. elegans. The intracellular domain of Notch forms a complex with CBF1 and Mastermind to activate transcription of target genes. The structure of the complex has been determined.  Function  The Notch signaling pathway is important for cell-cell communication, which involves gene regulation mechanisms that control multiple cell differentiation processes during embryonic and adult life. Notch signaling also has a role in the following processes: :* neuronal function and development :* stabilization of arterial endothelial fate and angiogenesis :* regulation of crucial cell communication events between endocardium and myocardium during both the formation of the valve primordial and ventricular development and differentiation :* cardiac valve homeostasis, as well as implications in other human disorders involving the cardiovascular systemThe notch signaling pathway in cardiac development and tissue homeostasis :* timely cell lineage specification of both endocrine and exocrine pancreas :* influencing of binary fate decisions of cells that must choose between the secretory and absorptive lineages in the gut :* expansion of the hematopoietic stem cell compartment during bone development and participation in commitment to the osteoblastic lineage, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for notch in bone regeneration and osteoporosis :* expansion of the hemogenic endothelial cells along with signaling axis involving Hedgehog signaling and Scl :*T cell lineage commitment from common lymphoid precursor :* regulation of cell-fate decision in mammary glands at several distinct development stages :* possibly some non-nuclear mechanisms, such as control of the actin cytoskeleton through the tyrosine kinase Abl :* Regulation of the mitotic/meiotic decision in the C. elegans germline Notch signaling is dysregulated in many cancers, and faulty notch signaling is implicated in many diseases including T-ALL (T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia), CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal-Dominant Arteriopathy with Sub-cortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy), multiple sclerosis (MS), Tetralogy of Fallot, Alagille syndrome, and many other disease states. Inhibition of notch signaling has been shown to have anti- proliferative effects on T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in cultured cells and in a mouse model. It has also been found that Rex1 has inhibitory effects on the expression of notch in mesenchymal stem cells, preventing differentiation.  Pathway  Maturation of the notch receptor involves cleavage at the prospective extracellular side during intracellular trafficking in the Golgi complex. This results in a bipartite protein, composed of a large extracellular domain linked to the smaller transmembrane and intracellular domain. Binding of ligand promotes two proteolytic processing events; as a result of proteolysis, the intracellular domain is liberated and can enter the nucleus to engage other DNA-binding proteins and regulate gene expression. Notch and most of its ligands are transmembrane proteins, so the cells expressing the ligands typically must be adjacent to the notch expressing cell for signaling to occur. The notch ligands are also single-pass transmembrane proteins and are members of the DSL (Delta/Serrate/LAG-2) family of proteins. In Drosophila melanogaster (the fruit fly), there are two ligands named Delta and Serrate. In mammals, the corresponding names are Delta-like and Jagged. In mammals there are multiple Delta-like and Jagged ligands, as well as possibly a variety of other ligands, such as F3/contactin. In the nematode C. elegans, two genes encode homologous proteins, glp-1 and lin-12. There has been at least one report that suggests that some cells can send out processes that allow signaling to occur between cells that are as much as four or five cell diameters apart. The notch extracellular domain is composed primarily of small cystine-rich motifs called EGF-like repeats. Notch 1, for example, has 36 of these repeats. Each EGF-like repeat is composed of approximately 40 amino acids, and its structure is defined largely by six conserved cysteine residues that form three conserved disulfide bonds. Each EGF-like repeat can be modified by O-linked glycans at specific sites. An O-glucose sugar may be added between the first and second conserved cysteines, and an O-fucose may be added between the second and third conserved cysteines. These sugars are added by an as-yet-unidentified O-glucosyltransferase (except for Rumi), and GDP-fucose Protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1), respectively. The addition of O-fucose by POFUT1 is absolutely necessary for notch function, and, without the enzyme to add O-fucose, all notch proteins fail to function properly. As yet, the manner by which the glycosylation of notch affects function is not completely understood. The O-glucose on notch can be further elongated to a trisaccharide with the addition of two xylose sugars by xylosyltransferases, and the O-fucose can be elongated to a tetrasaccharide by the ordered addition of an N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) sugar by an N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase called Fringe, the addition of a galactose by a galactosyltransferase, and the addition of a sialic acid by a sialyltransferase. To add another level of complexity, in mammals there are three Fringe GlcNAc-transferases, named lunatic fringe, manic fringe, and radical fringe. These enzymes are responsible for something called a \\"fringe effect\\" on notch signaling. If Fringe adds a GlcNAc to the O-fucose sugar then the subsequent addition of a galactose and sialic acid will occur. In the presence of this tetrasaccharide, notch signals strongly when it interacts with the Delta ligand, but has markedly inhibited signaling when interacting with the Jagged ligand. The means by which this addition of sugar inhibits signaling through one ligand, and potentiates signaling through another is not clearly understood. Once the notch extracellular domain interacts with a ligand, an ADAM-family metalloprotease called ADAM10, cleaves the notch protein just outside the membrane. This releases the extracellular portion of notch (NECD), which continues to interact with the ligand. The ligand plus the notch extracellular domain is then endocytosed by the ligand-expressing cell. There may be signaling effects in the ligand-expressing cell after endocytosis; this part of notch signaling is a topic of active research. After this first cleavage, an enzyme called γ-secretase (which is implicated in Alzheimer's disease) cleaves the remaining part of the notch protein just inside the inner leaflet of the cell membrane of the notch-expressing cell. This releases the intracellular domain of the notch protein (NICD), which then moves to the nucleus, where it can regulate gene expression by activating the transcription factor CSL. It was originally thought that these CSL proteins suppressed Notch target transcription. However, further research showed that, when the intracellular domain binds to the complex, it switches from a repressor to an activator of transcription. Other proteins also participate in the intracellular portion of the notch signaling cascade.  Ligand interactions  Crystal structure of the Notch1-DLL4 complex depicted as the interaction is predicted to occur between two cells (PDB ID: 4XLW) Notch signaling is initiated when Notch receptors on the cell surface engage ligands presented in trans on opposing cells. Despite the expansive size of the Notch extracellular domain, it has been demonstrated that EGF domains 11 and 12 are the critical determinants for interactions with Delta. Additional studies have implicated regions outside of Notch EGF11-12 in ligand binding. For example, Notch EGF domain 8 plays a role in selective recognition of Serrate/Jagged and EGF domains 6-15 are required for maximal signaling upon ligand stimulation. A crystal structure of the interacting regions of Notch1 and Delta-like 4 (Dll4) provided a molecular-level visualization of Notch-ligand interactions, and revealed that the N-terminal MNNL (or C2) and DSL domains of ligands bind to Notch EGF domains 12 and 11, respectively. The Notch1-Dll4 structure also illuminated a direct role for Notch O-linked fucose and glucose moieties in ligand recognition, and rationalized a structural mechanism for the glycan- mediated tuning of Notch signaling.  Embryogenesis  The Notch signaling pathway plays an important role in cell-cell communication, and further regulates embryonic development.  Embryo polarity  Notch signaling is required in the regulation of polarity. For example, mutation experiments have shown that loss of Notch signaling causes abnormal anterior-posterior polarity in somites. Also, Notch signaling is required during left-right asymmetry determination in vertebrates. Early studies in the nematode model organism C. elegans indicate that Notch signaling has a major role in the induction of mesoderm and cell fate determination. As mentioned previously, C. elegans has two genes that encode for partially functionally redundant Notch homologs, glp-1 and lin-12. During C. elegans, GLP-1, the C. elegans Notch homolog, interacts with APX-1, the C. elegans Delta homolog. This signaling between particular blastomeres induces differentiation of cell fates and establishes the dorsal-ventral axis.  Somitogenesis  Notch signaling is central to somitogenesis. In 1995, Notch1 was shown to be important for coordinating the segmentation of somites in mice. Further studies identified the role of Notch signaling in the segmentation clock. These studies hypothesized that the primary function of Notch signaling does not act on an individual cell, but coordinates cell clocks and keep them synchronized. This hypothesis explained the role of Notch signaling in the development of segmentation and has been supported by experiments in mice and zebrafish. Experiments with Delta1 mutant mice that show abnormal somitogenesis with loss of anterior/posterior polarity suggest that Notch signaling is also necessary for the maintenance of somite borders. During somitogenesis, a molecular oscillator in paraxial mesoderm cells dictates the precise rate of somite formation. A clock and wavefront model has been proposed in order to spatially determine the location and boundaries between somites. This process is highly regulated as somites must have the correct size and spacing in order to avoid malformations within the axial skeleton that may potentially lead to spondylocostal dysostosis. Several key components of the Notch signaling pathway help coordinate key steps in this process. In mice, mutations in Notch1, Dll1 or Dll3, Lfng, or Hes7 result in abnormal somite formation. Similarly, in humans, the following mutations have been seen to lead to development of spondylocostal dysostosis: DLL3, LFNG, or HES7.  Epidermal differentiation  Notch signaling is known to occur inside ciliated, differentiating cells found in the first epidermal layers during early skin development. Furthermore, it has found that presenilin-2 works in conjunction with ARF4 to regulate Notch signaling during this development. However, it remains to be determined whether gamma-secretase has a direct or indirect role in modulating Notch signaling.  Central nervous system development and function  Notch-Delta lateral inhibition in neural stem cells, resulting in the generation of neuronal and glial progenitors. Early findings on Notch signaling in central nervous system (CNS) development were performed mainly in Drosophila with mutagenesis experiments. For example, the finding that an embryonic lethal phenotype in Drosophila was associated with Notch dysfunction indicated that Notch mutations can lead to the failure of neural and Epidermal cell segregation in early Drosophila embryos. In the past decade, advances in mutation and knockout techniques allowed research on the Notch signaling pathway in mammalian models, especially rodents. The Notch signaling pathway was found to be critical mainly for neural progenitor cell (NPC) maintenance and self-renewal. In recent years, other functions of the Notch pathway have also been found, including glial cell specification, neurites development, as well as learning and memory.  Neuron cell differentiation  The Notch pathway is essential for maintaining NPCs in the developing brain. Activation of the pathway is sufficient to maintain NPCs in a proliferating state, whereas loss-of-function mutations in the critical components of the pathway cause precocious neuronal differentiation and NPC depletion. Modulators of the Notch signal, e.g., the Numb protein are able to antagonize Notch effects, resulting in the halting of cell cycle and differentiation of NPCs. Conversely, the fibroblast growth factor pathway promotes Notch signaling to keep stem cells of the cerebral cortex in the proliferative state, amounting to a mechanism regulating cortical surface area growth and, potentially, gyrification. In this way, Notch signaling controls NPC self-renewal as well as cell fate specification. A non-canonical branch of the Notch signaling pathway that involves the phosphorylation of STAT3 on the serine residue at amino acid position 727 and subsequent Hes3 expression increase (STAT3-Ser/Hes3 Signaling Axis) has been shown to regulate the number of NPCs in culture and in the adult rodent brain. In adult rodents and in cell culture, Notch3 promotes neuronal differentiation, having a role opposite to Notch1/2. This indicates that individual Notch receptors can have divergent functions, depending on cellular context.  Neurite development  In vitro studies show that Notch can influence neurite development. In vivo, deletion of the Notch signaling modulator, Numb, disrupts neuronal maturation in the developing cerebellum, whereas deletion of Numb disrupts axonal arborization in sensory ganglia. Although the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is not clear, together these findings suggest Notch signaling might be crucial in neuronal maturation.  Gliogenesis  In gliogenesis, Notch appears to have an instructive role that can directly promote the differentiation of many glial cell subtypes. For example, activation of Notch signaling in the retina favors the generation of Muller glia cells at the expense of neurons, whereas reduced Notch signaling induces production of ganglion cells, causing a reduction in the number of Muller glia.  Adult brain function  Apart from its role in development, evidence shows that Notch signaling is also involved in neuronal apoptosis, neurite retraction, and neurodegeneration of ischemic stroke in the brain In addition to developmental functions, Notch proteins and ligands are expressed in cells of the adult nervous system, suggesting a role in CNS plasticity throughout life. Adult mice heterozygous for mutations in either Notch1 or Cbf1 have deficits in spatial learning and memory. Similar results are seen in experiments with presenilins1 and 2, which mediate the Notch intramembranous cleavage. To be specific, conditional deletion of presenilins at 3 weeks after birth in excitatory neurons causes learning and memory deficits, neuronal dysfunction, and gradual neurodegeneration. Several gamma secretase inhibitors that underwent human clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease and MCI patients resulted in statistically significant worsening of cognition relative to controls, which is thought to be due to its incidental effect on Notch signalling.  Cardiovascular development  The Notch signaling pathway is a critical component of cardiovascular formation and morphogenesis in both development and disease. It is required for the selection of endothelial tip and stalk cells during sprouting angiogenesis.  Cardiac development  Notch signal pathway plays a crucial role in at least three cardiac development processes: Atrioventricular canal development, myocardial development, and cardiac outflow tract (OFT) development.  Atrioventricular (AV) canal development  :*;AV boundary formation ::Notch signaling can regulate the atrioventricular boundary formation between the AV canal and the chamber myocardium. Studies have revealed that both loss- and gain-of-function of the Notch pathway results in defects in AV canal development. In addition, the Notch target genes HEY1 and HEY2 are involved in restricting the expression of two critical developmental regulator proteins, BMP2 and Tbx2, to the AV canal. :*;AV epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) ::Notch signaling is also important for the process of AV EMT, which is required for AV canal maturation. After the AV canal boundary formation, a subset of endocardial cells lining the AV canal are activated by signals emanating from the myocardium and by interendocardial signaling pathways to undergo EMT. Notch1 deficiency results in defective induction of EMT. Very few migrating cells are seen and these lack mesenchymal morphology. Notch may regulate this process by activating matrix metalloproteinase2 (MMP2) expression, or by inhibiting vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin expression in the AV canal endocardium while suppressing the VEGF pathway via VEGFR2. In RBPJk/CBF1-targeted mutants, the heart valve development is severely disrupted, presumably because of defective endocardial maturation and signaling.  Ventricular development  :Some studies in Xenopus and in mouse embryonic stem cells indicate that cardiomyogenic commitment and differentiation require Notch signaling inhibition. Active Notch signaling is required in the ventricular endocardium for proper trabeculae development subsequent to myocardial specification by regulating BMP10, NRG1, and EphrinB2 expression. Notch signaling sustains immature cardiomyocyte proliferation in mammals and zebrafish. :The downstream effector of Notch signaling, HEY2, was also demonstrated to be important in regulating ventricular development by its expression in the interventricular septum and the endocardial cells of the cardiac cushions. Cardiomyocyte and smooth muscle cell-specific deletion of HEY2 results in impaired cardiac contractility, malformed right ventricle, and ventricular septal defects.  Ventricular outflow tract development  :During development of the aortic arch and the aortic arch arteries, the Notch receptors, ligands, and target genes display a unique expression pattern. When the Notch pathway was blocked, the induction of vascular smooth muscle cell marker expression failed to occur, suggesting that Notch is involved in the differentiation of cardiac neural crest cells into vascular cells during outflow tract development.  Angiogenesis  Endothelial cells use the Notch signaling pathway to coordinate cellular behaviors during the blood vessel sprouting that occurs sprouting angiogenesis. Activation of Notch takes place primarily in \\"connector\\" cells and cells that line patent stable blood vessels through direct interaction with the Notch ligand, Delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4), which is expressed in the endothelial tip cells. VEGF signaling, which is an important factor for migration and proliferation of endothelial cells, can be downregulated in cells with activated Notch signaling by lowering the levels of Vegf receptor transcript. Zebrafish embryos lacking Notch signaling exhibit ectopic and persistent expression of the zebrafish ortholog of VEGF3, flt4, within all endothelial cells, while Notch activation completely represses its expression. Notch signaling may be used to control the sprouting pattern of blood vessels during angiogenesis. When cells within a patent vessel are exposed to VEGF signaling, only a restricted number of them initiate the angiogenic process. Vegf is able to induce DLL4 expression. In turn, DLL4 expressing cells down-regulate Vegf receptors in neighboring cells through activation of Notch, thereby preventing their migration into the developing sprout. Likewise, during the sprouting process itself, the migratory behavior of connector cells must be limited to retain a patent connection to the original blood vessel.  Endocrine development  During development, definitive endoderm and ectoderm differentiates into several gastrointestinal epithelial lineages, including endocrine cells. Many studies have indicated that Notch signaling has a major role in endocrine development.  Pancreatic development  The formation of the pancreas from endoderm begins in early development. The expression of elements of the Notch signaling pathway have been found in the developing pancreas, suggesting that Notch signaling is important in pancreatic development. Evidence suggests Notch signaling regulates the progressive recruitment of endocrine cell types from a common precursor, acting through two possible mechanisms. One is the \\"lateral inhibition\\", which specifies some cells for a primary fate but others for a secondary fate among cells that have the potential to adopt the same fate. Lateral inhibition is required for many types of cell fate determination. Here, it could explain the dispersed distribution of endocrine cells within pancreatic epithelium. A second mechanism is \\"suppressive maintenance\\", which explains the role of Notch signaling in pancreas differentiation. Fibroblast growth factor10 is thought to be important in this activity, but the details are unclear.  Intestinal development  The role of Notch signaling in the regulation of gut development has been indicated in several reports. Mutations in elements of the Notch signaling pathway affect the earliest intestinal cell fate decisions during zebrafish development. Transcriptional analysis and gain of function experiments revealed that Notch signaling targets Hes1 in the intestine and regulates a binary cell fate decision between adsorptive and secretory cell fates.  Bone development  Early in vitro studies have found the Notch signaling pathway functions as down-regulator in osteoclastogenesis and osteoblastogenesis. Notch1 is expressed in the mesenchymal condensation area and subsequently in the hypertrophic chondrocytes during chondrogenesis. Overexpression of Notch signaling inhibits bone morphogenetic protein2-induced osteoblast differentiation. Overall, Notch signaling has a major role in the commitment of mesenchymal cells to the osteoblastic lineage and provides a possible therapeutic approach to bone regeneration.  Respiratory system development  Notch is implicated in development of alveoli in the lung.  Cancer   Role of Notch signaling in leukemia  Aberrant Notch signaling is a driver of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and is mutated in at least 65% of all T-ALL cases. Notch signaling can be activated by mutations in Notch itself, inactivating mutations in FBXW7 (a negative regulator of Notch1), or rarely by t(7;9)(q34;q34.3) translocation. In the context of T-ALL, Notch activity cooperates with additional oncogenic lesions such as c-MYC to activate anabolic pathways such as ribosome and protein biosynthesis thereby promoting leukemia cell growth.  Notch inhibitors  The involvement of Notch signaling in many cancers has led to investigation of notch inhibitors (especially gamma-secretase inhibitors) as cancer treatments which are in different phases of clinical trials. at least 7 notch inhibitors were in clinical trials. MK-0752 has given promising results in an early clinical trial for breast cancer.. Preclinical studies showed beneficial effects of gamma-secretase inhibitors in endometriosis, a disease characterised by increased expression of notch pathway constituents.  Synthetic Notch signaling  It is possible to engineer synthetic Notch receptors by replacing the extracellular receptor and intracellular transcriptional domains with other domains of choice. This allows researchers to select which ligands are detected, and which genes are upregulated in response. Using this technology, cells can report or change their behavior in response to contact with user- specified signals, facilitating new avenues of both basic and applied research into cell-cell signaling. Notably, this system allows multiple synthetic pathways to be engineered into a cell in parallel.

In English, it also called a Press Club. Institutions with a kisha club limit their press conferences to the journalists of that club, and membership rules for kisha clubs are restrictive. This blocks access by domestic non-member media, such as magazines and smaller newspapers, and the foreign media, as well as freelance reporters, to the press conferences. While similar arrangements exist in other countries, the Japanese form of this type of organization is seen as one of the most extreme, with journalists actively denying access to other journalists, which has led to use of the Japanese term in other languages, often with a critical meaning.  History  ;1890 :In response to the ban imposed by the first Imperial Diet on reporting by newspaper reporters, a reporter from the newspaper called together the Diet correspondents from the Tokyo newspapers to form a , which in October merged with newspaper companies across Japan, changing its name to the , to become the first kisha club. ;March 1941 :With the formation of the , a newspaper control organization, the number of kisha clubs was reduced to one third, and kisha clubs were forbidden from governing themselves. ;October 26, 1949 :The Japan Newspaper Publishers and Editors Association created a \\"Policy on Kisha Clubs\\", stating that they were \\"an organization for the purpose of socialization, and are not to intervene in matters related to reporting\\". ;December 1997 :The Japan Newspaper Publishers and Editors Association changed this policy, stating that kisha clubs were \\"bases for reporting\\" which allowed easy access to information held by public bodies. ;March 24, 2005 :Livedoor became the first Internet media company to apply for membership of the Japan Meteorological Agency kisha club. :However, on March 15, 2006, the former president of Livedoor, Takafumi Horie, was charged with a breach of the , and for this reason the application was rejected unanimously by the companies present. ;July 9, 2005 :The freelance journalist and the deputy editor of the weekly magazine submitted an application for a provisional ruling against the Tokyo Metropolitan Police and the 15 companies in the related kisha club to the Tokyo District Court and Tokyo High Court, stating that groups such as kisha clubs must not be allowed to obstruct journalists wishing to attend at the offices of the Metropolitan Police and give questions, but the application was refused. A special appeal is being made to the Tokyo High Court. ;November 8, 2005 :When a journalist from NHK Ōtsu bureau was arrested in relation to an arson incident, the offices of the Shiga Prefecture Police kisha club to which he belonged were searched by the Shiga Prefecture Police. Reporting agreements Kisha clubs often make agreements on reporting, which are known as because they are communicated via a blackboard in a press room. The aim of making reporting agreements is often to avoid excessive competition during reporting. Agreements may also be made based on a request by, for example, the police, to protect the victims in cases such as kidnappings. These backroom agreements came under criticism following the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, when they were blamed for causing journalists to self-censor, and limit their coverage to official announcements by government and plant officials. Magazine kisha clubs In 1956, the association was set up, containing \\" and , formed from member companies, to expedite the reporting activities related to magazine editing\\". Advantages of kisha clubs Setting up a kisha club allows bodies such as government agencies to communicate official announcements rapidly to the media. In particular, it simplifies reporting in the case where the body giving the report gives the time of the announcement to the club. At the same time, it is possible to set up transmission equipment for each media company in the press room, reducing the time taken between gathering information and editing. If, for example, local authorities want to provide information, it is easy to convey it by communicating with the kisha club for a higher-level body. Defenders of the system also argue that the kisha clubs' influence is used to open up the institution they are covering to scrutiny, although this argument would seem self-contradictory. Disadvantages of kisha clubs The kisha clubs have been widely criticized, both in Japan and abroad, for encouraging an extreme type of access-driven journalism that undermines the quality of journalism in Japan by stifling criticism and turning reporters into mouthpieces for the institutions that they are supposed to cover. In one representative criticism, Jonathan Watts, the former Tokyo bureau chief for The Guardian, said the kisha club create a problem of \\"watchdogs becoming lapdogs\\" because \\"the kisha-club system rewards self-censorship, fosters uniformity and stifles competition.\\" In its 2018 rankings of World Press Freedom, the non-governmental group Reporters Without Borders singled out the kisha clubs as a major reason that it ranked Japan 67th out of 180 countries, saying, \\"journalists find it hard put to fully play their role as democracy’s watchdog.\\" https://rsf.org/en/japan Smaller media companies, freelance journalists and foreign news organizations are often blocked from joining kisha clubs, leading to one of the most common criticisms, that the clubs foster opaque, exclusive ties between government officials and member journalists, who become overly reliant on their sources for information.Takahara, Kanako, \\"Tight-lipped Tepco lays bare exclusivity of press clubs\\", The Japan Times, 3 May 2011, p. 3. There have been cases when members of kisha clubs have been subject to penalties, such as being forbidden from attending the kisha club, for reporting information that was supposed to be kept secret, or that challenged the official narrative of the government agency where the club was based. In 2009, reporters for the Tokyo Shimbun, a regional newspaper, were banned from talking with Tokyo prosecutors for three weeks for naming a governing Liberal Democratic Party politician in their coverage of a political corruption scandal, when prosecutors were focusing their investigation solely on an opposition leader, Ichiro Ozawa. There is criticism that press rooms set up for kisha clubs by government agencies, local public bodies and the police are paid for with taxes, but can only be used by the member companies, leading to corruption. If local government agencies are included, the total yearly costs are thought to run to 600 million yen. In 1921, a gas company bribed the to gain approval for a rise in gas prices. It was discovered that newspaper reporters attending the city hall and Tokyo Metropolitan Police kisha clubs had also been bribed, an event condemned by public opinion. (The Tokyo Gas suspected bribery incident.) In 1974, when the weekly magazine Bungei Shunshū reported on the Kakuei Tanaka funding problem, the allegations were already well known in the kisha club but the media was silent about the story. In 1998, during the broadcast of TBS' TV program , \\"A Conversation with the Prime Minister\\", News 23 anchor Tetsuya Chikushi suggested to the Prime Minister of the time, Keizō Obuchi that, given the success of the Town Meetings held by President Bill Clinton, also shown by TBS, perhaps Obuchi would also like to take part in Clinton-style Town Meetings. Obuchi was keen, but the plan was scuppered due to opposition from the kisha club, and in the end Sori to Kataru continued to be shown in the same format as before. (Chikushi related these events in his book, Newscaster. Incidentally, Chikushi is known for having a critical stance towards kisha clubs.) In 1999, there was an incident where some members of the media had a row with staff at the Ministry of Agriculture, Farming and Fisheries over the display of a Japanese flag at the meeting hall of the ministry kisha club. This was just after the National Flag and National Anthem Law was passed, in the midst of a debate about whether the government was forcing groups to display flags. In response to actions by some sections of the media, there was criticism from both those in favor of the National Flag and National Anthem Law and those against, including comments such as \\"They shouldn't be making a scene inside Ministry buildings in the first place\\" and \\"Isn't this just a sign of the egotism of kisha clubs?\\" In 2000, the then Prime Minister Keizō Obuchi suddenly made telephone calls to Nippon TV and TV Asahi, and was allowed to appear live on these channels. The related kisha clubs criticized TV Asahi, saying that this was \\"unprecedented\\". (Nippon TV was not criticized.) On June 25, 2000, some notes titled \\"A personal view on tomorrow's press conference\\" were found lying on the ground at the , a kisha club in the grounds of the Japanese Prime Minister's official residence. This was the day before the meeting at which Prime Minister Yoshirō Mori was due to make an explanation about his \\"Kami no kuni\\" statements about religion in Japan, and the notes appeared to be a set of directions to the Prime Minister on how to handle questions from the media. Even though weekly news magazines published the name of the media organization (NHK) responsible for writing the document, the Cabinet Kisha Club did not take an active efforts to investigate the cause of the incident. The format in which the document was printed was the same as that of \\"communication e-mails\\" from the 5300 system terminals used for printing NHK stories, and the document also contained a term meaning \\"private broadcasters\\", , which was only likely to have been used by NHK. There has been criticism that the main work of reporters in a press room tends to be to summarize the contents of press conferences, so that they neglect to check whether what is announced is true and are more easily subject to media manipulation, and that this leads to fewer reporters learning to go out to different locations to do research. Akira Uozumi, a former Kyodo News journalist, stated that kisha clubs slowly wear down reporters psychologically, and blunt their instincts as journalists, saying (in the Asahi Shimbun, on May 26, 2001), that \\"if 70% or 80% of your job is collecting secondary or tertiary information from government agencies as quickly as possible, it dulls your instinct for sensing what is actually going on in the world. Before you know it, the logic of the civil servants works its way into you, and it gets more difficult to think from the point of view of the people being governed. I thought it wasn't happening to me, but five years after becoming freelance, I gradually began to realize it was.\\" As a result of this, most media reports are reports of announcements to kisha clubs, a phenomenon unthinkable in a developed country. In addition, there is criticism that the kisha club system decreases the distance between reporters and politicians, leading to improper relationships. As proof of this, Taro Kawano, a member of the House of Representatives, has said that it is normal for reporters (from the Japanese media) to have meals paid for by politicians (which would never happen in any other developed country), that when politicians go on visits reporters stay in the same hotel, and that the media consider that the sign of a \\"good reporter\\" is when \\"the reporter and the politicians are the best of friends\\". (Quoted in by , published by . In addition, during the Matsumoto sarin incident, reports based on information given by the Metropolitan Police to a kisha club treated the first witness as a criminal. There is also the criticism that kisha club are exclusive by nature, and rarely allow representatives of the new media, the foreign media or freelance journalists to join. In response to this, the Japan Newspaper Publishers and Editors Association introduced a policy whereby members from the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan would be treated in the same way as members from the Japan Newspaper Publishers and Editors Association, and in the late 1990s admitted Reuters as a member of the Kabuto Club. Since then, foreign-owned media organizations such as Bloomberg and Dow Jones with large-scale information-gathering networks have joined the majority of kisha clubs, and are involved in their administration. However, this has only been possible for a handful of foreign-owned media organizations, and as most foreign media organizations with representatives in Tokyo have only a few reporters there, it is impossible for them to have reporters join and remain present at kisha clubs. In fact, the EU has criticised kisha clubs for being exclusive, and the opinion has been stated that the kisha club system should be abolished, and all journalists with a reporter's pass issued by the Japanese Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs allowed to collect material for stories at public institutions. This exclusivity is the reason why foreign journalists were not allowed to attend the police conference on the disappearance and murder of the British woman Lucie Blackman, and that when Prime Minister Koizumi visited the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, non-members of the kisha club were not allowed to accompany him. (Statement by Private Secretary Isao Iijima.) Reporters Without Borders, a journalists' organization which campaigns to protect the rights of journalists to freedom of speech, is calling for the Japanese government to abolish the kisha club system. Moves to abolish kisha clubs At a national level, in 1994, Ichirō Ozawa, the head of the Japan Renewal Party, undertook a groundbreaking experiment by allowing magazine reporters not in the kisha club to participate in press conferences, but this never took off, in part due to disagreements between Ozawa and the media. In 2002, the then head of the Democratic Party of Japan, Katsuya Okada, introduced a format of press conference where all types of media, including sports newspapers, weekly magazines and foreign media organizations, could take part. Until then, only media in the could take part. Some heads of local public bodies, business or financial groups have also closed press rooms, having realized the disadvantages of the kisha club system. In June 1993, the , the kisha club for the Tokyo Stock Exchange, reformed its rules, which until then had restricted membership to Japanese media organizations, to include \\"foreign media organizations which perform media work equivalent to that of the Japan Newspaper Publishers and Editors Association\\", a move which in practice opened the door to foreign media organizations. In April 1996, the city of Kamakura, Kanagawa stopped using the , which had six companies as members, including national newspapers and the local Kanagawa Shimbun, and opened a \\"Publicity media center\\" which could be used by any media organization registered with the city. The then mayor, Ken Takeuchi, formerly of the editing committee of the Asahi Shimbun, and currently head of the internet newspaper \\"janjan\\", stated that this was done as it was felt that \\"it was not reasonable for a city institution funded by tax money to be monopolized by a kisha club which represented only one section of the media\\". In March 1999, the was closed, at the request of Keidanren, the organization controlling it. This kisha club was focused on reporting related to industrial work such as electrical machinery, shipbuilding, semiconductors and automobiles. There was debate between the media and the companies making announcements about continuing with the kisha club, but as no breakthrough solution was found, the club was dissolved. It is thought that the root cause of this event was that electrical makers had been conducting open press conferences, and using press releases and e-mail, so there were no longer advantages to using a kisha club. The automobile industry, wanting to keep a kisha club active, opened an automobile industry kisha club as part of the , but the Asahi, Yomiuri, Mainichi and Nikkei newspapers refused to join, in effect depriving the club of its function. In July 1999, NTT's kisha club, was closed as a result of structural changes at NTT. This club had in the past been subject to criticism for the fact that it was a club dedicated to a single private company, but after the restructuring by NTT, a group of economic editors assembled from the different media companies agreed not to accept the Aoi Club as a kisha club. NTT accepted this and closed the club, with the aim of opening the press room to organizations other than club members, including magazines and the overseas media. On August 6, 2001, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government requested that the Kajibashi/Yūraku kisha club pay charges for using the Tokyo government offices, but later retracted this, instead requiring only lighting, heating, water and telephone charges to be paid. The Governor of Tokyo, Shintarō Ishihara, also questioned the policy of not allowing magazines or foreign media organizations to participate in press conferences. On March 30, 2004, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a written request to the central government offices, the offices of each prefecture, the police and other bodies, asking them to allow foreign reporters to participate in press conferences. On March 14, 2006, due to the harsh financial circumstances it was facing, the Hokkaidō government decided to request payments for lighting, heating, water and other costs, totaling approximately 2.5 million yen, from the , starting from the new financial year. One of the biggest moves against the kisha clubs came in the autumn of 2009, when the opposition Democratic Party (Japan, 1998) took power from the long-governing LDP. The new prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, opened press conferences at the Prime Minister's Office to non-kisha club reporters from domestic and foreign media, declaring he would \\"make press conferences more open to everyone.\\"http://japan.kantei.go.jp/hatoyama/statement/201003/26kaiken_e.html Press conferences at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were also opened to non- kisha club members of the press. However, when the new financial services minister, Shizuka Kamei, tried to open press conferences at his agency, the Financial Services Agency, the kisha club resisted so ferociously that he was forced to compromise. In an odd arrangement, he gave two back-to-back press conferences, one to the kisha club, and one open to all other journalists. \\"Japan’s news media are closed,\\" Kamei said during one of the non-kisha club press conferences. “They think they are the only real journalists, but they are wrong.”  Nagano Prefecture's \\"Declaration of the End of Our Kisha Club System\\"  On May 15, 2001, former Mayor of Nagano, Yasuo Tanaka, announced a \\"Declaration of the End of Our Kisha Club System\\". He closed the three kisha clubs within the prefectural offices, and opened a press center which anyone could use, called the . The purpose of this was to end the monopoly of the large media companies on information; however, it was fiercely criticized by these companies, and it is reported that this action has resulted in a feud with large media companies both inside and outside the prefecture. On October 3, 2006, the current mayor, Hitoshi Murai, announced that the \\"Expression Center\\" would be renamed the . In the same way as Tanaka, he allowed members of the public to participate in conferences, subject to submitting an application.  Major kisha clubs  In addition to the kisha clubs listed below, there are clubs for the government of each prefecture. * - The kisha club within the Tokyo Stock Exchange. In principle, companies make announcements about events which are likely to have a major effect on share prices at this club. * - The kisha club of the former Japanese National Railways. At present, it is based at the head offices of JR East. As most reporters concerned with transport normally work at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, few are permanently stationed at the Tokiwa club. During his time as a reporter with the Asahi Shimbun, Naoki Tanemura belonged to the club, and the fiction he wrote as a railway writer contained several names which were variations on the name \\"Tokiwa\\". * - The kisha club of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Reporters from the mass media in Japan and overseas are stationed here. * - This kisha club was formed from a union of the clubs for the Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Construction and National Land Agency. Its nature as a combination of different groups can often be observed; for example, a reporter covering traffic policy may be sitting next to a reporter covering the disposal of debts by general construction companies. * - A kisha club at the Japan Iron and Steel Federation in Chūō, Tokyo. Despite its location, resident reporters cover a range of industries, including metals other than steel, chemistry, textiles, rubber, paper, glass, cosmetics, personal care goods (such as those from Lion or Kao), pharmaceuticals and apparel. It has the widest range of areas covered of any kisha club. Because of its name, it is often wrongly thought to be a club covering businesses such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries or Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries. * - A club in Honseki-chō, Nihonbashi, Tokyo, which serves as a base for reporters covering the textile and paper industries. It is not an official club, but a subdivision of the heavy industries club, with which it merged in 2002. * - This is a club within the Bank of Japan, whose resident reporters cover not only the Bank itself but also private organizations such as banks and insurance agencies. * - Initially, this was a subdivision of the Keidan Kikai Club, but became a club in its own right when the Kikai Club closed in 1999. However, the four major newspapers, the Nikkei, Asahi, Yomiuri and Mainichi, decided not to participate in it, it is not recognized as a kisha club by the Newspaper Association. The Nikkan Jidosha Shimbun, which is not a member of the Newspaper Association, is a resident company at the automobile club. * - The kisha club at the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Marunouchi, Tokyo. This club was established with the aim of allowing the mass media to report on small businesses. However, in practice, there is next to no reporting on small businesses, and instead it is a base for reporting on the delivery, service, non-banking financial and food businesses. The Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry has repeatedly expressed discontent about this, and asked for it to be used to report on small businesses, but this has not come about. For this reason, the relationship between the media and the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry concerning the running of the club has not always been a close one, and there have often been rumors that the club may close.  - A kisha club within the official residence of the Japanese Prime Minister. In recent times, it has often been referred to as the , but its official name is . Reporters belonging to this club report mainly on the Prime Minister, Chief Cabinet Secretary, Deputy Cabinet Secretary, the official residence and the cabinet. * - A club at the House of Representatives in the National Diet with the six Tokyo television stations (NHK, Nippon TV, TBS, Fuji TV, TV Asahi and TV Tokyo) as members. It is the only club in Japan which is exclusively for television news camera operators. * - A club within the House of Representatives which is exclusively for radio news journalists. Its official name is the . It is mainly used for recording press conferences (). NHK is not a member of this club, as its radio news broadcasts use the audio from its television news broadcast. * - A kisha club with offices inside the headquarters of the LDP and at the House of Representatives. The reporters belonging to this club report mainly on the LDP and New Komeito. The club inside the LDP headquarters is referred to as , and the club at the House of Representatives is known as . Reporters from the Hirakawa generally attend the club at the House when the Diet is in session, and the HQ when it is out of session. * - A club at the House of Representatives in the National Diet. Reporters at this club cover mainly the Democratic Party of Japan, Japanese Communist Party and Social Democratic Party * - Tokyo Metropolitan Police kisha clubs Television reporters often say they are reporting \\"from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police kisha club\\", but this is not technically correct. Ignoring the industry newspaper, there are three kisha clubs at the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. The Asahi, Mainichi, Yomiuri, Tokyo, Nikkei and Kyōdō news companies are members of the , which means \\"club of seven companies\\", as the Jiji Shinpō newspaper was once also a member. This club has the longest history of any of the clubs at the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. The NHK, Sankei, Jiji, Nippon Broadcasting, Nippon Cultural Broadcasting and MXTV companies are members of the . This is the smallest club, and in practice only the first three of these companies are resident. The five private broadcasters, Nippon TV, TBS, Fuji TV, TV Asahi and TV Tokyo, are members of the . These three clubs are run separately, with separate accounts. * - Since this is run by the reporters from the police kisha clubs, in practice there are no companies resident here. * - A kisha club related to the labor movement. In former times, organizations such as the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan provided information, and member newspaper and magazine reporters worked here. At present the Japanese Trade Union Confederation is involved. As two of the news companies, Rodo Joho and Akahata reported on the massive debt incident and the trade union budget spending incident, by the former Japan Postal Workers' Union (now the JPU), the Postal Workers' Union blocked them from becoming members. Kisha clubs in other countries In South Korea, there are also kisha clubs similar to those in Japan, which are thought to exist as an aftereffect of the period of Japanese rule. There has also been criticism of the negative effects of these clubs in South Korea. There have been incidents which have served to hasten the dismantling of kisha clubs. These include reforms by the media itself, such as the event on June 11, 2001 when 11 local newspapers attending government offices in Seongnam, Gyeonggi-do, including the \\"Kyongin Ilbo\\" and \\"Jeonmae\\", disbanded the club and withdrew from the conference room, and events such as that in the same year, where the internet newspaper OhmyNews was expelled from a press conference at Incheon International Airport, and issued a lawsuit appealing against its expulsion. In 2003, due to a policy by President Roh Moo-hyun, the kisha club at the Presidential residence, the Blue House, has been disbanded, and a conference room open to internet media and foreign media organizations set up, so that anyone who registers can attend. In America, while there are a few clubs which are relatively similar to Japanese kisha clubs, such as the club in the Department of Defense, unlike Japan these have a salon atmosphere. At the White House, there are secret meetings known as \\"briefings\\", to which only specific members of the major mass media companies are invited. However, beside these, there are also press conferences, which any journalist issued with a press pass can attend. On the other hand, in order to obtain a press pass, journalists have to undergo strict security checks from all departments, and the process can take several months. Recently, bloggers reporting news from internet blogs have been issued press passes, which attracted much attention, but it was also found that a reporters from a conservative news website was also running an illegal pornography website, provoking criticism in that the security checks were not good enough to discover the reporter's illegal transactions. In the United Kingdom, until recently only reporters with press passes for the Houses of Parliament were allowed to attend briefings, but since Tony Blair took power, freelance journalists have been allowed to participate. In addition, before this reform, briefings were treated as being off the record. In France, any journalist may be issued with a press card, but in order to receive this, journalists must undergo an investigation by the \\"press card committee\\" which issues the cards. With this card, a journalist can enter the President's residence (the Élysée Palace) and attend press conferences at any Ministry.  Other details  Many of the kisha clubs in Japan hold joint informal events (such as end-of-year parties, summer parties and leaving parties) with local government agencies or company publicity departments. This is not illegal, but it is inappropriate behavior for journalists. It is said that the smaller the kisha club, the more pronounced this tendency is. In 2002, when reports were made about the problem of (the so-called secret Cabinet fund), it was discovered that at end-of-year parties, New Year parties and at the start of holiday tours, the Chief Cabinet Secretary handed to reporters, and this was paid for from the Cabinet Payment Fund. In 2005, it was found by the city council of Tatebayashi City that the lunches at the regular press conferences held by the mayor of Tatebayashi City and media companies was paid for from public expenses. The city announced the intention of ending these payments.

Cambridge, U.K.: English School of Agriculture, 1946. and was supported by Stalin. If the field of genetics' connection to Nazis wasn't enough, Mendelian genetics was also suppressed due to beliefs that it was \\"bourgeoisie science\\" and its association with the priest Gregor Mendel due to hostility to religion because of the Soviet policy of state atheism.Gregor Mendel: And the Roots of Genetics, Edward Edelson, p. 14. \\"Lysenko won the support of Joseph Stalin, the ruthless Soviet dictator, and Mendel's rules were officially outlawed in the Soviet Union and the Eastern European Countries that it controlled at that time. Under Communism, the Mendel Museum in his monastery was closed.\\" In 1950, the Soviet government organized the Joint Scientific Session of the USSR Academy of Sciences and the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences, the \\"Pavlovian session\\". Several prominent Soviet physiologists (L.A. Orbeli, P.K. Anokhin, A.D. Speransky, I.S. Beritashvily) were attacked for deviating from Pavlov's teaching. As a consequence of the Pavlovian session, Soviet physiologists were forced to accept a dogmatic ideology; the quality of physiological research deteriorated and Soviet physiology excluded itself from the international scientific community.Windholz G (1997) 1950 Joint Scientific Session: Pavlovians as the accusers and the accused. J Hist Behav Sci 33: 61-81. Later Soviet biologists heavily criticised Lysenko's theories and pseudo-scientific methods.  Cybernetics  Cybernetics was also outlawed as bourgeois pseudoscience during Stalin's reign. Norbert Wiener's 1948 book Cybernetics was condemned and translated only in 1958. A 1954 edition of the Brief Philosophical Dictionary condemned cybernetics for \\"mechanistically equating processes in live nature, society and in technical systems, and thus standing against materialistic dialectics and modern scientific physiology developed by Ivan Pavlov\\".«Кибернетика», Краткий философский словарь под редакцией М. Розенталя и П. Юдина (издание 4, дополненное и исправленное, Государственное издательство политической литературы, 1954. (However this article was removed from the 1955 reprint of the dictionary.) After an initial period of doubts, Soviet cybernetics took root, but this early attitude hampered the development of computing in the Soviet Union.  History  Soviet historiography (the way in which history was and is written by scholars of the Soviet UnionIt is not the history of the Soviet Union. See definitions of historiography for more details.) was significantly influenced by the strict control by the authorities aimed at propaganda of communist ideology and Soviet power. Since the late 1930s, Soviet historiography treated the party line and reality as one and the same.Taisia Osipova, Peasant rebellions: Origin, Scope, Design and Consequences, in Vladimir N. Brovkin (ed.), The Bolsheviks in Russian Society: The Revolution and the Civil Wars, Yale University Press, 1997, . Google Print, p.154-176 As such, if it was a science, it was a science in service of a specific political and ideological agenda, commonly employing historical revisionism.Roger D. Markwick, Donald J. Raleigh, Rewriting History in Soviet Russia: The Politics of Revisionist Historiography, Palgrave Macmillan, 2001, , Google Print, p.4-5 In the 1930s, historic archives were closed and original research was severely restricted. Historians were required to pepper their works with references – appropriate or not – to Stalin and other \\"Marxist- Leninist classics\\", and to pass judgment – as prescribed by the Party – on pre-revolution historic Russian figures.John L. H. Keep: A History of the Soviet Union 1945-1991: Last of the Empires, pages 30–31 Many works of Western historians were forbidden or censored, many areas of history were also forbidden for research as, officially, they never happened.Ferro, Marc (2003). The Use and Abuse of History: Or How the Past Is Taught to Children. London; New York: Routledge. . See Chapters 8 Aspects and variations of Soviet history and 10 History in profile: Poland. Translations of foreign historiography were often produced in a truncated form, accompanied with extensive censorship and corrective footnotes. For example, in the Russian 1976 translation of Basil Liddell Hart's History of the Second World War pre-war purges of Red Army officers, the secret protocol to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, many details of the Winter War, the occupation of the Baltic states, the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, Western Allied assistance to the Soviet Union during the war, many other Western Allies' efforts, the Soviet leadership's mistakes and failures, criticism of the Soviet Union and other content were censored out. The Katyn massacre was formally assigned to Nazi Germany but the subject was frequently concealed. Soviet famines were taboo. Linguistics At the beginning of Stalin's rule, the dominant figure in Soviet linguistics was Nikolai Yakovlevich Marr, who argued that language is a class construction and that language structure is determined by the economic structure of society. Stalin, who had previously written about language policy as People's Commissar for Nationalities, read a letter by Arnold Chikobava criticizing the theory. He \\"summoned Chikobava to a dinner that lasted from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m. taking notes diligently.\\"Montefiore. p.638, Phoenix, Reprinted paperback. In this way he grasped enough of the underlying issues to oppose this simplistic Marxist formalism, ending Marr's ideological dominance over Soviet linguistics. Stalin's principal work in the field was a small essay, \\"Marxism and Linguistic Questions.\\"Joseph V. Stalin (1950-06-20). \\"Concerning Marxism in Linguistics\\", Pravda. Available online as Marxism and Problems of Linguistics including other articles and letters also published in Pravda soon after February 8 and July 4, 1950.  Pedology  Pedology was a popular area of research on the basis of numerous orphanages created after the Russian Civil War. Soviet pedology was a combination of pedagogy and psychology of human development, that heavily relied on various tests. It was officially banned in 1936 after a special decree of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union \\"On Pedolodical Perversions in the Narkompros System\\" on July 4, 1936. Physics In the late 1940s, some areas of physics, especially quantum mechanics but also special and general relativity, were also criticized on grounds of \\"idealism\\". Soviet physicists, such as K. V. Nikolskij and D.

Sociology  After the Russian Revolution, sociology was gradually \\"politicized, Bolshevisized and eventually, Stalinized\\".Elizabeth Ann Weinberg, The Development of Sociology in the Soviet Union, Taylor & Francis, 1974, , Google Print, p.8-9 From 1930s to 1950s, the discipline virtually ceased to exist in the Soviet Union. Even in the era where it was allowed to be practiced, and not replaced by Marxist philosophy, it was always dominated by Marxist thought; hence sociology in the Soviet Union and the entire Eastern Bloc represented, to a significant extent, only one branch of sociology: Marxist sociology. With the death of Joseph Stalin and the 20th Party Congress in 1956, restrictions on sociological research were somewhat eased, and finally, after the 23rd Party Congress in 1966, sociology in Soviet Union was once again officially recognized as an acceptable branch of science.Elizabeth Ann Weinberg, The Development of Sociology in the Soviet Union, p.11  Statistics  This is the translation of a widely cited article (\\"Lukavaya Tsifra\\") by journalist Vasily Selyunin and economist Grigorii Khanin, in Novy Mir, February 1987, #2: 181-202Alan Smith, Russia and the World Economy: Problems of Integration, Routledge, 1993, , Google Print, p.34-35 The quality (accuracy and reliability) of data published in the Soviet Union and used in historical research is another issue raised by various Sovietologists.Nicholas Eberstadt and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, The Tyranny of Numbers: Mismeasurement and Misrule, American EnterpriseInstitute, 1995, , Google Print, p.138-140Robert Conquest Reflections on a Ravaged Century (2000) , page 101 The Marxist theoreticians of the Party considered statistics as a social science; hence many applications of statistical mathematics were curtailed, particularly during the Stalin era. Under central planning, nothing could occur by accident.David S. Salsburg, The Lady Tasting Tea: How Statistics Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth Century, Owl Books, 2001, , Google Print, p.147-149 Law of large numbers or the idea of random deviation were decreed as \\"false theories\\". Statistical journals and university departments were closed; world-renowned statisticians like Andrey Kolmogorov or Eugen Slutsky abandoned statistical research. As with all Soviet historiography, reliability of Soviet statistical data varied from period to period.Nikolai M. Dronin, Edward G. Bellinger, Climate Dependence And Food Problems In Russia, 1900-1990, Central European University Press, 2005, , Google Print, p.15-16 The first revolutionary decade and the period of Stalin's dictatorship both appear highly problematic with regards to statistical reliability; very little statistical data were published from 1936 to 1956 (see Soviet Census (1937)). The reliability of data has improved after 1956 when some missing data was published and Soviet experts themselves published some adjusted data for the Stalin's era; however the quality of documentation has deteriorated. While on occasion statistical data useful in historical research might have been completely invented by the Soviet authorities, there is little evidence that most statistics were significantly affected by falsification or insertion of false data with the intent to confound the West.Edward A. Hewett, Reforming the Soviet Economy: Equality Versus Efficiency, Brookings Institution Press, 1988, , Google Print, p.7 and following chapters Data was however falsified both during collection – by local authorities who would be judged by the central authorities based on whether their figures reflected the central economy prescriptions – and by internal propaganda, with its goal to portray the Soviet state in most positive light to its very citizens. Nonetheless the policy of not publishing, or simply not collecting, data that was deemed unsuitable for various reasons was much more common than simple falsification; hence there are many gaps in Soviet statistical data. Inadequate or lacking documentation for much of Soviet statistical data is also a significant problem.

The film has a notable theme song \\"Xin Dong\\", performed by Shino Lin Xiao Pei. This song became a radio hit and can still be frequently heard on the radio or at karaoke bars/boxes. The success of this film prompted director Johnnie To to cast Gigi Leung and Takeshi Kaneshiro again in his 2003 film Turn Left Turn Right. Plot Sylvia Chang plays a director who intends to make a romance film and begins to wonder about the role fate plays in relationships. She ends up re-examining her own first love in a completely different light. The story is set in two different periods of time, one in the 1970s where Gigi plays the teenage Xiao-rou, and the other in the 1990s where Sylvia plays the older Xiao-rou. Takeshi Kaneshiro plays the role of a shy teenager, Ho-jun, who falls in love with Xiao-rou (played by Gigi Leung). Their relationship turns intimate but faces fierce objections from their parents. Karen Mok plays Chen- li, Xiao-rou's best friend, whom Xiao-rou confides in. This teenage love soon fizzles out owing to misunderstandings and Ho-jun, after many years, turns to marry Chen-li. One day, Chen-li reveals that she is a lesbian and that they both love the same girl - Xiao-rou. Ho-jun meets Xiao-rou on a trip to Japan and upon knowing that Ho-jun is already married, Xiao-rou returns home and gets herself engaged. Ho-jun manages a last attempt to reunite with Xiao-rou by flying to Hong Kong and telling her that he is already a divorcee, but it is to no avail. Years later, Xiao-rou finds out that Ho-jun's wife was actually Chen-li. She discovers this only after Chen-li has died. Chen-li leaves a message for Xiao-rou asking her for forgiveness. As Xiao rou prepares to fly back to Hong Kong from Japan, she receives a present from Ho-jun. In the box were photographs, taken when Ho-jun was thinking about Xiao-rou and of their brief moments of happiness. It is only at the end of the film when it is tactfully revealed that the director Sylvia Chang was actually re-enacting her own teenage romance.

Commonly known as a \\"rail\\", \\"digger\\", or \\"slingshot\\", it is now considered obsolete, and is used only in nostalgia drag racing. Wheelbases ranged from .Taylor, Thom. \\"Beauty Beyond the Twilight Zone\\" in Hot Rod, April 2017, pp.30-43 passim.  History  The front engine dragster came about due to engines initially being located in the car's frame in front of the driver. They did not use (and current dragsters still do not use) any form of suspension. Because of this, these types of vehicles were prone to becoming unstable at speed. This is due to their making , plus having poor tire technology, short wheelbases, and very lightweight. (This was demonstrated to extremes in Fuel Altereds.) The driver sits angled backward, over the top of the differential in a cockpit situated between the two rear tires, a design originating with Mickey Thompson in 1954, as a way of improving traction. This position led to many drivers being maimed when catastrophic clutch failures occurred. Introduced with the start of organized drag racing, they were limited by the availability of traction from their rear tires or \\"slicks\\". A number of dragsters with four rear drive wheels were attempted as well, including cars by Art Chrisman (along with his brother, Lloyd, and partner Frank Cannon), Bill Coburn, and Eddie Hill. (Coburn and the Chrisman brothers used twin engines, also.) Push starts were necessary until National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) mandated self-starters in 1976. After burnouts, cars would be pushed back by crews; this persisted until NHRA required reverse gears in 1980. The slingshot produced a number of fatal wrecks in the 1960s, including Mike Sorokin's and John Mulligan's (months after suffering severe burns in a fire at the Nationals in 1969). Clutches, bell housings, blowers, and engines exploded, with e.t.s hitting 6.43 seconds by the end of 1969, a pass recorded by Mulligan to qualify #1 at the Nationals. Other accidents included a flip (what today would be called \\"blowover\\") by Jim Nicoll at the 1970 Nationals after a clutch failure.NHRA.com (retrieved 24 May 2017) The slingshot's advantages, putting weight over the rear tires, now served to cause the front end to lift, as tire technology improved, to the point ballast, sometimes hundreds of pounds' worth, had to be added over the front axle,NHRA.com (retrieved 24 May 2017) while others, like Ronnie Scrima (on his Scrimaliner) and Tony Nancy, would mount a winglet.Taylor, Thom. \\"Tony Nancy T/F dragster\\" and \\"Scrima, Bacilek, Milodon Scrimaliner\\", in \\"Beauty Beyond the Twilight Zone\\", pp.32 & 38. The drawbacks led to several attempts at rear-engined cars, but the rail was only supplanted by the rear-engined type (which is now standard) when Don Garlits introduced Swamp Rat XIV in 1971. He designed the car while in hospital, having suffered from severe injuries caused by an exploding clutch.

It is less effective and less commonly used than a larger dose of levonorgestrel alone, a dose of ulipristal acetate, or insertion of a copper intrauterine device. It is designed to be used within 72 hours of unprotected sexual intercourse because it works by inhibiting ovulation. Typically, the Yuzpe regimen uses several doses of combined oral contraceptive pills. It may be preferred in locations where other forms of emergency contraception are unavailable or accessing emergency contraception carries a societal stigma. In these places, people often self-administer combined oral contraceptives as emergency contraception. Subsequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) undertook an investigation into the use of progestogen-only tablets as an Emergency Hormonal Contraceptive (i.e. without any estrogen component). This showed greater efficacy with reduced side effects and has therefore superseded the Yuzpe method. A single dose of 10 mg mifepristone is also more effective than the Yuzpe regime. History The method was first developed by Canadian Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology A. Albert Yuzpe as a method of reducing potential unwanted pregnancies, including pregnancy from rape. He published the first studies demonstrating the method's safety and efficacy in 1974.

He was a professor at Harvard and the Curator of Oriental Art at Harvard’s Fogg Museum. He is reputed to be one of the models for Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones.Foltz, Richard C. Foltz, Religions of the Silk Road: Overland Trade and Cultural Exchange from Antiquity to the Fifteenth Century (New York, NY: St. Martin's Griffin, 1999), 4. As an explorer/agent at the turn of the 20th century, he studied the Silk Road. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1927. Career Warner graduated from Harvard College in 1903 with a specialty in Buddhist art and an interest in archeology. After several field trips to Asia, he returned to Harvard, where he taught the university's first courses in Japanese and Chinese art. The Smithsonian Institution sent him to Asia in 1913, and he spent more than a year there, but World War I interrupted his work. In 1922 the Fogg Museum again sent him to China. Frescoes at Dunhuang and controversy over the removal of antiquities Langdon Warner's work in China is the subject of much controversy among art historians. On the one side, there are those who say that he pillaged sites in Asia of their art, in particular, frescos from the Mogao caves at Dunhuang.Peter Hopkirk: Foreign Devils on the Silk Road. Amherst : University of Massachusetts Press, 1984, c1980Sanchita Balachandran: Object Lessons: The Politics of Preservation and Museum Building in Western China in the Early Twentieth Century. International Journal of Cultural Property (2007), 14 : 1-32 Cambridge University Press In 1922, the Fogg Museum sent Warner to China to explore western China. He arrived at the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang in January 1924 and, armed with a special chemical solution for detaching wall-paintings, he removed twenty-six Tang dynasty masterpieces from caves 335, 321, 323 & 320\\\\. Warner first applied the chemical solution (strong glue) to the painting on the cave wall. He then place a cloth against it. The cloth is then pulled away from the fresco and then he applied plaster of Paris on the back of the painting and transfer the painting to the plaster surface. Warner had found evidence that the caves were the object of vandalism by Russian soldiers and reached an agreement with the local people to purchase the frescoes and remove them in order to save them for posterity. Unfortunately, the removal process resulted in some damage to the site itself. Luckily, frescoes he framed with glue but was unable to remove are still on display in caves today. Only five of the 26 fragments of murals that he removed are in good enough condition to be exhibited now in the Harvard Art Museums, Cambridge, Massachusetts. The views of the Chinese government towards Warner have varied as intensively as the government itself over the last century. In 1931, the National Commission for the Preservation of Antiquities declared that archeological objects could only be taken from the country if there is no one in the country \\"sufficiently competent or interested in studying or safe-keeping them.\\" Otherwise, the Commission concluded, it is not longer scientific archeology but commercial vandalism.\\" Warner himself viewed his work as a heroic act of preserving art from destruction. He defended taking fragments from the Longmen Grottoes, saying \\"if we are ever criticized for buying those chips, the love and labor and the dollars we spent on assembling them should silence all criticism. That in itself is more service to the cause of China bigger than anyone else in this country has even made. It is worth noting though, most of the destruction was done to fill orders placed by western collectors using images provide by the buyers. Today the caves in Dunhuang are favored as tourist stops to showcase the Chinese view that the Americans pillaged their heritage. Certain members of the family have requested that the Museum return the pieces to Dunhuang. The Museum's position is that since they have a bill of sale indicating that Warner legitimately purchased the artwork they have no obligation to return them. The Warner family acknowledges both points of view on the matter and seeks resolution. World War II Warner's archaeological career was interrupted by the United States' entry into World War II and he became part of the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives (MFAA) Section of the U.S. Army. He was brought on as an advisor to the MFAA Section in Japan from April to September 1946. He has been given credit by some for advising against firebombing and the use of the atomic bomb on Kyoto, Nara and other ancient cities to protect cultural heritage of Japan. There are monuments erected in Kyoto, Hōryū-ji (outside the western edge of Hōryū-ji temple), and Kamakura (outside Kamakura JR Station) in his honor for this reason. However, Otis Cary has argued that the credit for sparing Japan's cultural heritage sites belongs not to Langdon but to the U.S. Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson.

He was created by Joe Kelly and Doug Mahnke in Action Comics #775 (March 2001). Introduced as an antihero, the character later becomes a supervillain.  Fictional character biography   Pre-\\"Flashpoint\\"  Manchester Black was a ruthless vigilante who led a crime fighting team called The Elite. Other than his thick English accent, his notorious Union Flag tattoo, and a few snippets he told about his life, very little is known about him, although he is most likely from the city of Manchester, England. What is known includes insinuations that he was physically abused by his parents while growing up and has a hatred for people with \\"high moral concepts\\" who feel they are better than people like Black, who would do anything to survive. This hatred included superheroes who would only turn over captured villains to the police instead of killing them, which was the only way Manchester and the Elite felt villains could be dealt with. Black also claimed distant African and Korean heritage, but as he made these claims to justify his use of racist terms towards these groups, it is possible he was either lying or joking.  The Elite  Black first appears as the leader of a team of super-powered antiheroes called The Elite, who gained worldwide popularity for viciously killing their foes and thus preventing them from coming back to cause more problems. Superman opposed this wanton violence, leading to a showdown on Jupiter's moon Io that was videotaped for Earth's media. Black used his powers to give Superman a stroke, and his teammates (Coldcast, Menagerie, and the Hat) apparently were able to destroy Superman in a giant explosion. While the Elite were gloating, however, Superman used his superspeed seemingly to kill all the team's members except Black. Superman then disabled the Englishman by using his X-ray vision to locate a growth inside Black's brain. He identified the growth as the source of Black's powers, and carefully fired a thin burst of heat vision through Black's retinas, removing it and thus disabling Black. Faced with the apparent loss of his powers, Black actually wept, hypocritically appalled that Superman had seemingly adopted the lethal tactics he and the Elite had spent so much time advocating, especially given that he was being taped at the time. After stating that he was certain his 'demonstration' had frightened those watching with the ugliness of it, Superman then revealed to the powerless Black that the rest of the Elite were only unconscious; he had not removed anything from Black's brain, instead merely causing a micro-concussion that temporarily shut down Black's powers, and that murdering opponents makes a hero no better than his enemies. Furious, Black declared that by not killing him, Superman had guaranteed that as long as Black was alive, he would come after Superman again and again, but Superman calmly replied that he wouldn't want it any other way, and that dreams like the ones he gave to Earth were what made life worth living until the example he and other heroes provided led to a better tomorrow.  Suicide Squad  A temporarily beaten Black was taken into custody, and his mental powers were restored over the next few months. In his next appearance (in the Our Worlds At War storyline in Adventures of Superman #593), Black was hired by the American government and President Lex Luthor to lead a new Suicide Squad featuring Chemo, Plasmus, Shrapnel, Mongul and Steel. The Squad's mission was to release the monster Doomsday against the threat of the galactic conqueror Imperiex. Upon his release, Doomsday apparently killed the entire Squad, with the exception of Black (Steel was later saved thanks to the actions of the Black Racer and Darkseid, although Mongul survived under unspecified circumstances), who escaped after 'reprogramming' Doomsday's mind so that Doomsday's hatred for Superman was temporarily redirected toward the Imperiex probes.  Suicide  Black's final appearance (in the Ending Battle storyline running through the Superman titles in November and December 2002) found him mentally controlling dozens of supervillains by revealing Superman's secret identity and sending them en masse after the Man of Steel. Black targeted everyone in Superman's life—from Clark's old football coach to his current dentist—before launching a mass assault. Despite the odds against him, Superman managed to hold the villains back, later finding Black in his apartment, apparently having killed Lois Lane while Superman was occupied. Black taunted Superman, goading him into killing him, but Superman put Lois' body first and resolved to give her a proper burial. Despite fantasizing about killing Black, Superman resisted temptation and told Black that he would devote the rest of his life to keeping the villain behind bars and not in the morgue, as vengeance isn't justice. Black was stunned at Superman's fortitude. His spirit wavered and his illusion crumbled, revealing Lois to be still alive. Black had been trying to force Superman into a position in which he would have to kill, intending for Superman to learn, after Black's demise, that he had broken his moral code for nothing, thus leaving him truly broken. But Black's plan failed, and he was forced to recognize that Superman genuinely believed everything he said. Distraught at the revelation that he had become a villain himself, Black made the supervillains forget Superman's secret identity. He then fired a telekinetic pulse at his own head, taking his own life.Action Comics #796 (December 2002)  The New 52  In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Manchester Black is a high-ranking S.T.A.R. Labs executive. He created Algorithm, an A.I. that commits acts of terrorism throughout New York City in order to lure the Teen Titans to S.T.A.R. Labs, where he stages an attack against himself in order to be saved by the Titans and gain their trust. He then proposes a partnership; suspicious of Manchester Black's real intentions, Red Robin agrees to it, but sends Beast Boy to investigate him.  DC Rebirth  Manchester Black makes his first appearance of the DC Rebirth in Superman #23. He appears to be restored to his original look and powers, though his hair is black rather than purple. Black takes Jon Kent, the young Superboy, hostage and de-powers him, forcing him to watch images of his parents fighting off his creatures and suffering. The most shocking of these incidents occur when Lois Lane's right leg is cut off. Black is behind the illusory Hamilton County where the Kents live. He created it when he helped the Elites escape from the Kroogarians, with Deadman's Swamp being the center of most of the connected residents of the aliens who are disguised as citizens of Hamilton. These residents include the dairy farmer Mr. Cobb and his granddaughter Kathy; Jon's science teacher Mr. Martinez; Candice, the Hamilton Horn editor; police officer Goodman; the town doctor; and Hamilton's mayor. When Superman confronts Black, the two share their usual debate about killing villains versus Superman's usual methods, but Black turns the tables by restoring Jon's powers while 'programming' him to fight alongside Black. When Superman and Superboy break the quantum reactor and witness future timelines, Superboy turns on Black before his self-control is restored thanks to Lois. Before Black can attack the Kents further, Kathy uses her powers to create telepathic feedback, causing Black's consciousness to be transferred and trapped in the body of one of the Cobb family's dairy cows.  Known relatives  Manchester's sister Vera is the leader of the Justice League Elite.Justice League Elite #1-8 (2004–2005) For a time, it appeared as though her mind had been taken over by the disembodied spirit of her brother, but it was later revealed to be a form of multiple personality disorder caused by her traumatic upbringing and aggravated by her contact with the near-infinite power of the Worlogog. Her instability nearly drove her to destroy London, but the other members of the Elite helped her to recover. Powers and abilities Black was a powerfully skilled telekinetic and telepath who was capable of very precise uses of telekinesis; for example, he was able to give Superman the equivalent of a stroke by telekinetically pinching the blood vessels in Superman's brain. Black was able to create very detailed illusions on a vast scale, erase memories, and could telepathically control thousands of minds at the same time. While controlling Bizarro and Silver Banshee, he was able to temporarily grant them enough sanity to enable them to communicate and to form plans. He was also able to switch Superman's and Bizarro's minds, putting them into each other's bodies. In Rebirth, Black has demonstrated enough power to neutralize the powers of Jon Kent, the son of Superman and Lois Lane, and restore them at will later.

When they find a badly-wounded Fiona in Mercy Graves and Otis Graves' van, Manchester had his final moments with a dying Fiona as Martian Manhunter tries to take away her pain. Following Fiona's death, Manchester went to buy guns in order to get revenge on those responsible for Fiona's death. In the episode \\"Call to Action\\", Manchester begins his revenge by targeting some members of the Children of Liberty. After shooting most of them, Manchester interrogated a surviving member on the identity of his supervisor. After getting the name of Caldwell from the Children of Liberty member, Manchester shoots him. In the episode \\"Rather the Fallen Angel\\", Manchester helps Jimmy Olsen fight the Children of Liberty. Afterwards, he goes after Ben Lockwood. In the episode \\"Bunker Hill\\", Manchester makes use of the Lockwood Factory to confront Ben in his Agent Liberty alias where Manchester has his wife Lydia as a hostage. Despite some obstacles, Supergirl and Nia Nal thwart Manchester's attempts and Agent Liberty taking revenge. Both Manchester and Ben are arrested by the police. After being visited by Martian Manhunter at National City Men's Central Jail, Manchester watches from the windows as Ben is brought into the prison as the protesters chant \\"Liberty\\". In the episode \\"Menagerie\\", Manchester sends Menagerie a letter that pleases her. In the episode \\"What's So Funny About Truth, Justice and the American Way?\\", Manchester escapes from prison and forms the Elite with Menagerie, a fifth-dimensional alien named Hat, and an unnamed Morae/Mo. They form the Elite in response to the bigotry of Agent Liberty and the Children of Liberty as well as the ineffectiveness of the government and D.E.O.. In the episode \\"O Brother where art thou?\\", Black uses a rare Martian artifact that grants telepathic powers to its user called the Staff of H'ronmeer. He was later killed by a vengeful J'onn J'onzz after the latter believed that he was the one who shot Olsen, disintegrating Manchester, who, in his last moments, found J'onn's unleashed rage \\"beautiful\\".

In 1999, he played for the Chatham Athletics in the Cape Cod Baseball League. Professional career Minor league career (2000–2002) Bay was drafted by the Montreal Expos in the 22nd round of the 2000 Major League Baseball draft and was assigned to the Expos' Short-Season A team in Burlington, Vermont, the Vermont Expos. In , Bay was assigned to the Expos’ High Single-A team in Jupiter. He began the year slowly, and in May was moved to Clinton of the Midwest League. Bay reached base in his first 26 games, then went on to bat .362 and win the league batting title. In all, he batted .315 with 14 home runs and 75 runs batted in on the year. The Expos traded Bay to the New York Mets on March 24, 2002 with Jim Serrano for Lou Collier. The Mets traded Bay to the San Diego Padres with Josh Reynolds and Bobby Jones for Jason Middlebrook and Steve Reed at the 2002 trading deadline. Major league career San Diego Padres (2003) Bay debuted with the Padres on May 23, 2003, getting his first major league hit, a home run, in the ninth inning. Two days later, he suffered a broken right wrist after being hit by a pitch. Pittsburgh Pirates (2003–2008) Bay with the Pirates in spring training On August 26, 2003, Bay was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates, along with Óliver Pérez and Cory Stewart in exchange for Brian Giles. He finished the season with a .287 batting average, four home runs, and 14 RBI in 30 games. Bay began the season on the disabled list due to surgery during the offseason, and did not rejoin the team until May. Despite missing the beginning of the season, he still produced the best offensive numbers of any National League rookie. He batted .282 in 120 games, leading all major league rookies in home runs (26) and RBIs (82). He also led all NL rookies in slugging percentage (.550), extra base hits (54) and total bases (226). With his 26 home runs, Bay broke a Pirates rookies record of 23 set by Johnny Rizzo in and matched by Ralph Kiner in . Selected as the 2004 NL Rookie of the Year by The Sporting News, Bay was the second Pittsburgh Pirates player honoured with the award, after second baseman Johnny Ray in 1982. Bay was also the first Canadian player to win the award. In 2005, Bay was selected to his first All-Star Game as a reserve outfielder. He was the only player on either roster not to appear in the game. Bay also appeared in the 2005 Century 21 Home Run Derby, representing Canada in the nationality-themed contest; he was eliminated in the first round after hitting no home runs. Bay finished the season with a .306 average, 32 home runs, and 101 RBI, leading the Pirates in every major hitting category. After the 2005 season, Bay signed a four-year contract extension worth a guaranteed $18.25 million. Bay batted .321 with 12 home runs (a Pirate record for home runs in a month) and 35 RBIs in May 2006. From May 22 to May 28, he hit home runs in six consecutive games, two short of the major league record held by Dale Long, Don Mattingly, and Ken Griffey, Jr. He had actually hit 10 home runs in ten games, but he had failed to hit a home run in one of the games, and hit two the next day. Following an aggressive public relations campaign by the Pirates in 2006, Bay led all National League outfielders in All-Star voting. Pearl Jam lead singer Eddie Vedder even urged fans to vote for Bay during a summer concert at Pittsburgh's Mellon Arena.Bay flattered by All-Star push – Pittsburgh Tribune-Review Bay became the first member of the Pittsburgh Pirates voted into the All-Star game as a starter since Andy Van Slyke. In the game, Bay went 1 for 3, with a single. After battling injuries, Bay's season was less productive. Despite having a strong first couple of months, he batted .247 with 21 home runs and 84 RBIs. Bay had a much more productive 2008 with Pittsburgh, batting .282 with 22 home runs and 64 runs batted in through the All-Star break. In a May series against the Chicago Cubs, Bay had extra-inning walk-off hits in back-to-back games; the first two walk-off hits of his career. A month later, he got his third walk- off hit of the season and his career with a 13th-inning solo home run against the Tampa Bay Rays. Boston Red Sox (2008–2009) On July 31, 2008, Bay and a player to be named later (Josh Wilson) were traded to the Boston Red Sox in a three team deal that sent Manny Ramirez to the Los Angeles Dodgers and Andy LaRoche with Bryan Morris to the Pittsburgh Pirates from the Dodgers and Brandon Moss with Craig Hansen to the Pirates from the Red Sox. In his Red Sox debut, Bay scored both runs, the second coming after he tripled in the bottom of the 12th inning and scored the game-winning run on a Jed Lowrie RBI infield single. Bay hit his first home run with Boston the next night, against the Oakland Athletics. In one game, he hit multiple home runs against the Baltimore Orioles at Oriole Park. Bay would end the 2008 season with Boston batting .293 with 9 home runs and 37 RBIs. Bay batting for the Red Sox on August 18, 2008 The Red Sox' 2008 American League Division Series against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim was the first playoff series of Bay's career. Bay hit a home run in each of the first two games of the series. Bay finished the series batting 7 for 17 (.412), with 2 doubles, 2 home runs, and 5 RBIs. In the 2008 American League Championship Series, he scored the first run in game one. In game two, he opened the door for the Red Sox with a two-run double and a home run in the fifth inning. However, the Red Sox lost in seven games. In 2009, after a strong first half that included an All-Star selection, Bay went on to lead the Red Sox with a career-high 36 home runs and 119 RBIs during the regular season. Early in the season, he also had a streak of 11 home runs with men on base, tying the team record and falling one shy of the major league record. In 2009, he was named #41 on the Sporting News' list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball.Seattle Sports Blog Seattle Post- Intelligencer He filed for free agency after the season, turning down the Red Sox's offer of salary arbitration.Silverman, Mike.

On January 5, 2010, Minaya and Jeff Wilpon held a press conference at Citi Field in which Jason Bay was presented with his uniform, number 44 for the Mets. The Red Sox received the 39th (Anthony Ranaudo) and 57th (Brandon Workman) selections in the 2010 Major League Baseball draft as compensation.1st Round of the 2010 MLB June Amateur Draft Baseball-Reference.com On April 27, in the first game of a double header against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Bay hit his first home run as a member of the New York Mets in the bottom of the fourth inning to give the Mets a 2–0 lead. The Mets went on to win the first game, 4–0, and win the second game, 10–5. In his first season with the Mets, Bay played in only 95 games. He suffered a concussion in a game against the Dodgers, when he ran into a fenced wall and his head jerked back. He finished his season with a .259 batting average, only six home runs (he hit 36 the year before), 47 RBIs, and scored 48 runs. Bay began 2011 on the disabled list with a rib injury and returned to the Mets on April 21 in a game against the Houston Astros. On that day (a 9–1 Mets win), Bay batted and scored in the 8th on a rare four-base error when Hunter Pence failed to catch Bay's fly ball; David Wright, on first base from a walk, scored ahead of him. Bay also had a ground-rule double and scored a run in the 4th inning. On June 28, 2011, Bay hit a grand slam off of Detroit Tigers pitcher Daniel Schlereth. It was the first grand slam by the Mets since Ángel Pagán hit one on August 1, 2009. On August 8, Bay hit his 200th career home run against the San Diego Padres, becoming the third Canadian MLB player after Larry Walker and Matt Stairs to reach this milestone. Bay hit another grand slam in September en route to winning his fifth career National League Player of the Week Award. Bay got off to a slow start to the 2012 season, finishing spring training with no home runs or RBI, and his regular season, which was derailed further by a broken rib suffered while making a diving catch in the April 23 game against the San Francisco Giants. When Bay returned from the DL on June 8, 2012 against the New York Yankees, he went 0-for-3 with one strikeout. He continued to go 0-for-16 in his return from the DL through June 12, before hitting a single on June 13 against the Tampa Bay Rays. In a home game against the Cincinnati Reds on June 15, Bay left the game in the second inning after crashing into the left field wall and suffering a concussion while attempting to catch a fly ball by Jay Bruce that became an inside-the-park home run. He was subsequently placed on the DL again, and returned again on July 17 against the Washington Nationals. On September 2, Bay hit a grand slam off of Miami Marlins pitcher Mark Buehrle in the first inning of a 5–2 Mets win. Bay also hit a home run off of Buehrle on September 22 in a 4–3 Mets win. Bay finished the 2012 season with a .165 batting average, 8 home runs and 20 RBI. On November 7, 2012, the Mets and Bay agreed to terminate their contract a year early and make the outfielder an unrestricted free agent.

Bay remains friends with former NHL centre Shawn Horcoff, who was also born in Trail. He is close friends with Grady Sizemore, who was a groomsman at Bay's wedding. In Bay's opening interview with the Boston media, he stated that his father was a die-hard Red Sox fan who had bought him a Red Sox onesie to wear when he was young. Bay believed it was still in his parents' basement along with his two childhood TV room posters of Red Sox greats Jim Rice and Carl Yastrzemski. On Thursday, July 2, 2009, Bay became a US citizen after a ceremony at Faneuil Hall in Boston.

Category:United States Navy ship names ","title":"USS Forrest Sherman"},{"id":"1107378","text":"Bark Psychosis are an English post-rock band/musical project from east London formed in 1986. They were one of the bands that Simon Reynolds cited when coining \\"post-rock\\" as a musical style in 1994, and are thus considered one of the key bands defining the genre. In its original form, the group was a quartet of Graham Sutton, Daniel Gish, John Ling and Mark Simnett. This line- up (with contributions from other passing members) recorded most of the early EPs and the seminal 1994 album Hex. Sutton has remained the consistent core member of the group, which is currently a flexible and intermittently active project in which he is supported by an altering roster of guest musicians (including experimental guitarist Colin Bradley (of Dual) and Talk Talk drummer Lee Harris). Sound and influences Bark Psychosis' sound has covered various musical styles including minimalism, introverted indie rock, psychedelia, post-punk, cool jazz, outright mechanical/industrial noise, and electronic dance music. However, the band's music is best characterised by a sense of acoustic space, moody atmospherics, murmured vocals, abstract but emotional lyrics, and a particularly sensitive and acclaimed mixture of electronic and acoustic instrumentation. Bark Psychosis is also noted for an extreme dynamic range, varying from quietly-whispered-and-played songs such as \\"I Know\\" or \\"Absent Friend\\" to thunderous metallic riffing (\\"Murder City\\") or deafening sheets of electric noise (the first half of the track \\"Hex\\"). Bark Psychosis' music is also notably melodic and expressive, and arguably owes something to the English pastoral rock tradition. The band is frequently embraced by progressive rock fans due to their experimental outlook, and their use of both atmospherics and extended instrumentation. Sutton himself seems uncomfortable with the association, commenting, \\"Sometimes people compare us to Pink Floyd, and they are just a muso thing. I'm more interested in feeling, really...\\" The band started life as a teenage Napalm Death cover project, reflecting the members' early interest in extreme noise. Other early influences included Sonic Youth, Talk Talk, Butthole Surfers, Big Black, Swans and Joy Division. Graham Sutton has claimed a long-term interest in dub, jazz and classical music, as well as an appreciation for the work of Nick Drake. Bark Psychosis' musical development has also been characterised by restlessness, which has contributed to the band's historical lack of stability while at the same time stimulating its creativity. In another 1994 interview, Sutton stated, \\"The whole thing about being in this band is never repeating yourself. I've always tried to surprise myself and other people as well, fucking around with people's preconceptions about what you're about and stuff. I really get a real huge fucking kick about giving people the wrong impression. Or twisting things around. Like, it might sound initially sweet, but it ain't. Or vice versa.\\" History Formation and early years (1986–1988) Bark Psychosis was formed in Snaresbrook, Essex in 1986, emerging from the 1980s East London experimental music scene that also produced AR Kane and Disco Inferno. The original two members were schoolfriends Graham Sutton (guitar, vocals) and John Ling (bass, vocals). Both were aged 14 at the time that they started the band, carrying out their initial experiments using a 4-track tape recorder and a drum machine. In January 1988 Ling and Sutton (both aged 16) left school to pursue music full- time. They recruited drummer Mark Simnett, who had previously done community work centered on St John's Church, Stratford. Using Simnett's connection with the church, Bark Psychosis arranged rehearsal space for themselves in the crypt of St John's, a location that would continue to play an important role in Bark Psychosis' music. The trio spent the rest of 1988 rehearsing and composing original material, during which time both Sutton and Ling began to dabble in keyboard playing and digital sampling. A few low-key gigs followed late in the year. One of these concerts was attended by Nick Allport and Vinita Joshi of the small East London independent label Cheree Records. Impressed by the band, Cheree immediately offered to release the band's first recordings. During this period, Bark Psychosis briefly featured a second guitarist, Rashied Garrison. Garrison had previously played in The Moons, a band who had supported Bark Psychosis at early shows. However, his tenure with Bark Psychosis was fairly short and he would later become \\"a feared journalist\\", the guitarist in Good Time Pony and leader of The Repton Oaks. Cheree singles and early live gigs (1988–1990) Bark Psychosis' debut appearance on record was the 1988 Clawhammer flexi-disc (a split release on Cheree, shared with Fury Things and Spacemen 3). By this time, the band were back to their original trio lineup. Six years later (on the eve of the release of the Hex album), Sutton was vituperative in disowning the track. The official Bark Psychosis debut was 1989's 12-inch single \\"All Different Things/By Blow\\", for which the band was augmented by an extra singer, Sue Page. In 1994, Sutton recalled: > \\"At this stage we were so naive we didn't know how things worked, how the > whole music business worked. We did two nights of working, from 12 to 8, and > gave it to (Cheree)... That's the first time we went in the studio properly, > really. Basically, I had my hands on the faders and when it kicked in, I > just fucking went to the faders, I didn't know anything about it then. When > we were mixing \\"By Blow\\" we ended up distorting the DAT and we didn't even > fucking notice because it was just monitoring so loud in the control room. > It's nice, naive and all the rest of it but it's pretty crap at the same > time.\\" The band's formal live debut (outside of school performances) was at The Sir George Robey in Finsbury Park, London, supporting Extreme Noise Terror. Tours with The Telescopes, Cranes and Spiritualised quickly followed. In 1990, with Sue Page still on board, Bark Psychosis released a 12-inch EP called \\"Nothing Feels\\" (backed with \\"I Know\\"). Sutton later recalled, \\"The second single was what(ever) two tracks we had knocking around at the time. At the same time, live-wise at this stage, it was completely different. It was very, very loud and extreme both ways.\\" By this time, Bark Psychosis were establishing a reputation as one of the most unpredictable, innovative live bands in Britain with a great degree of spontaneity and excitement at their gigs. On record, however, they were developing into a more atmospheric and melodic act, while avoiding many of the standard rock \\"cliches\\" such as extended solos and self- mythologising lyrics: beyond their melody lines and rhythms, the band remained abstract and textural. Regarding his musical evolution at the time, Sutton later commented, \\"For some reason I just flipped one day and I realized silence could have a much greater impact than loud noise... Space and silence are the most important tools you can use in music. I just got really obsessed with that.\\" A year in the wilderness; signing to 3rd Stone Ltd.; Manman EP (1990–1991) Having signed a formal recording contract with Cheree, Bark Psychosis immediately found themselves dismayed by management changes at the label. Cheree's two new commercial backers were later described by Sutton as \\"a couple of cons, really, that had screwed so many people,\\" with links to various dubious businesses including pornography. The band reneged on their contract and spent a year extricating themselves from the situation, during which time Sue Page left the band. Much-needed managerial and financial support during this period was provided by the band's friend Rudi Tambala of AR Kane. Sutton has commented: \\"That year was murder. When we were trying to get away from Cheree it was fucking hell. I had a lot of problems after that year. I was squatting and stuff and did a lot of things I shouldn't have done. It's caused a lot of problems.\\" Eventually, the band's contract with Cheree was bought out by 3rd Stone Ltd., the Corby-based alternative record label which had headhunted the band on the reputation of their initial singles. Bark Psychosis' debut release for 3rd Stone — 1991's Manman EP — demonstrated clear influences from techno and musique concrète. The band's potential had dramatically expanded with the addition of keyboard/synthesizer player Daniel Gish (formerly of Disco Inferno). By now, Sutton and Ling's interest in digital sampling and programming had become much more overt. From that point onward, sampling became a major feature of the Bark Psychosis sound, combining with the effect of Gish's own influences (which included Kraftwerk, New Order, The The and Dead Can Dance). Sutton was later to comment, \\"To an extent, every record we make is a reaction to the one that came before it.\\" The Scum single (1992) In 1992, Bark Psychosis released a hugely acclaimed landmark single called Scum. This was an ominous, 21-minute ambient piece improvised and recorded live in the band's \\"home\\" of St John's Church. Recalling the events several years later, Sutton admitted \\"we had a single to do but we didn't have any tracks that were suitable for a single. We wanted to do something completely new and put ourselves under a certain amount of risk. So basically we hired a load of gear and set up sort of a makeshift string and sticky-tape kind of studio under the church where we rehearsed for ages, and in the church as well... We didn't have a track when we started, so we just set ourselves ten days to do a 12-inch and that's what came out... It's probably the most spontaneous record we've put out.\\" Scum experimented with the use of space and extreme dynamics, with music that varied between minimal jazzy chording, airy acoustic drums, clamorous noise guitar, space-ambience and random vocal snippets. \\"There was no part except for a few rough galactic idea(s),\\" Sutton recalled. \\"That's how we'd written the past few years, just jamming as a band underneath the church. 99.999% of it, you wouldn't use any of it; but the vibe was really good at the time, so we decided why not just record a jam sort of thing. That's the thing, we tend to try and make life very difficult for ourselves for some reason. I'm not sure why... Ninety per cent of it was recorded live and then there was a few things. Vocals, some piano, some ambient guitar, a few different samples and stuff. The first three-and-a-half minutes of it was actually just the ambient mics left up. We had recorded a few different takes of things and those distance mics were just left up from a previous jam.\\" Regarding the sudden bursts of indistinct speaking voices that punctuated the single, Sutton noted that \\"that was just a found thing at the church. On one of the nights we were recording there was a Pentecostal meeting going on in the back room, so we sort of sneaked up to their door and just tape-recorded them because it sounded so brilliant.\\" The single's ominous atmosphere and disaffected, whispered lyric \\"came about as a general disaffection with general sentiments from records that were being shoved down my throat. Crap house tracks. I just remember this one track had this chorus like \\"Everybody's free\\" and it made me want to fucking puke. I just wanted something completely the opposite of that and (to) turn that sentiment around.\\" The single gained the band a lot of press attention (being awarded Single of the Week in Melody Maker amongst other plaudits), and demand for an album grew. Recording Hex (1992–93) In November 1992, Bark Psychosis began recording a self-produced debut album, to be called Hex. The recording of the album consolidated the ideas which the band had explored on Scum. As had been the case with Scum, the sessions made extensive use of the natural acoustics of St John's Church, with other recording work done in studios in Bath, Brighton and London. In an interview with the Audrie's Diary fanzine in 1994, Sutton explained \\"Most people, to get a big reverb sound, will record something and then run it through a reverb unit. But we've taken the trouble to record in a church... When you set up mics, you capture more than just what is being recorded. You capture an ambience or a feeling as well. It's all about creating something unique and of the moment rather than just another bland factory preset.\\" right In an interview with the Weedbus fanzine at the same time, Sutton commented: > \\"If you were making a film or something you want to have special effects — > for example, a train going over a cliff. Then you either get a little model > of it and simulate, or you can get a real train because that's probably > going to be more effective. We wanted to capture real acoustics rather than > have everything computer simulated. A lot of keyboards can sound very bland > so you have to look at recording them in a different way. We wanted to have > a gritty edge to it. We got a PA and set it up in a church, a really huge > church in Stratford, east London, just beside a huge traffic island, so we > had to do it late at night when there was no traffic! We had the keyboards > coming out of the PA and the microphones at the other end of the church. It > created a very interesting atmosphere...\\" By this point, the band had developed a singularly unique and varied sound — embedded in lush electronic sampling and textures and accented with electric guitars, piano, and melodica. Regarding the sampling, Sutton commented \\"although the album doesn't sound like it, a good fifty per cent of it was just running from computer... A lot of things. Guitar things. Moving things around, you know, cutting things out, then moving them around. Bits of vocal moved around... There's also a lot of samples of instruments involved. But we do it in a way that is idiosyncratic to us... Although Hex is sample- orientated, it doesn't necessarily sound like that, and there is an acoustic drum-kit in there, recorded in such a way that it sounds quite idiosyncratic to me. The album doesn't fit in that well, which I'm happy about — I wouldn't like it to fit in with a homogeneous agenda like dance music, or ambient music, whatever. The area of ambient music interests me more than any other but it's still too stylised.\\" Sutton himself was moving in the direction of electronic music and paying less attention to his guitar playing. \\"I had a tremolo pedal, a chorus pedal, a delay pedal. That's it. But I really haven't played much guitar in the last year. I've been mostly fucking around with samplers. I'm more interested in pure sound, than just a guitar or whatever.\\" Hex featured guest musicians the Duke String Quartet, Animals That Swim's trumpeter Del Crabtree, Phil Brown on flute, and Neil Aldridge and Dave Ross on assorted percussion. The band also called in vibraphone player Pete Beresford (the father of one of Sutton's friends), of whom Sutton later recalled \\"(he) was this really, really old guy who used to play in a lot of old war time swing bands for kids going out for a dance in London. He hadn't taken his vibes out of his front room for fucking years, he just plays for his own pleasure, as a hobby. So we got him to come down and it was fucking brilliant, and I want to work with him again.\\" The recording of Hex proved to be tortuous, with plenty of infighting centered around Sutton's stubbornness and dominance of the band. In 2001, Sutton would reminisce \\"I have great memories of working on (Hex), even if I did do everyone's head in!\\" However, in a 1994 interview he described the album sessions as \\"the most intense fucking year of my life. The longest I had been in a studio was ten days for Scum, but this was like a year of my life... It was quite hairy at some points.\\" The band interrupted the album recording sessions on 31 January 1993, to play a one-off concert at Ronnie Scott's jazz club in London. This was to be their last performance together as a quartet. Two members of Bark Psychosis were to leave the band during the remaining sessions. The first was Daniel Gish, whose departure was formally announced in Melody Maker on 18 December 1993. Gish would cite \\"lack of record company support\\" as his motive for leaving, with Sutton commenting, \\"all I can say is the split was amicable,\\": he would also describe Gish as having \\"gone to Israel for a bit. He's going to come back though and I still want to work with him.\\" The last track from the sessions (\\"Big Shot\\") was recorded by the remaining three members. Once Hex was completed, John Ling also quit Bark Psychosis, feeling \\"burnt out and unable to play,\\" allegedly due to the stress of making the album. At the time, Sutton commented that \\"(John) felt he just needed to get some distance from it once we'd finished it. I think he's moved to Holland now to do Spiral Tribe or squat over there or something... It's just been a fucking intense year, though it might not sound like it on the record. It's been a real head-fuck.\\" Ling would not return to the band. He subsequently quit the music business to spend a period travelling the world, and later pursued a career as a psychiatric nurse as well as starting a family. Many years later, Sutton would admit \\"I know I can be 'difficult' to work with; I get very opinionated — and I'll fight tooth and nail for what I believe in. John had a problem with that and chose to leave.\\" The release of Hex (early 1994) In January 1994, the band released \\"A Street Scene\\" as a single. Although plans for live concerts had initially been upset by the departure of John Ling, the band carried out a five-date promotional tour with guest musicians (including Daniel Gish, who had been invited to rejoin the lineup as a guest musician rather than full band member). The band screened the animated Bolex Brothers film The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb rather than use a support act. Hex itself was released on 14 February 1994. It was licensed to Circa Records (a division of Virgin Records) and released worldwide through EMI. In the US, the album was released on Caroline Records. When British music critic Simon Reynolds reviewed the album in the March 1994 issue of Mojo magazine, he used the term \\"post-rock\\" to describe the band's approach to music. He later expanded upon the idea in the May 1994 issue of The Wire. While this was not the first use of the term, it was the example which brought the \\"post-rock\\" concept to public knowledge to the point where it was a major stylistically defining term in music criticism and discourse during the 1990s. This review (and the subsequent discussion which it inspired) ensured that Bark Psychosis were one of the first bands recognised as being post-rock artists. Although Hex was not a commercial success at the time, it has continued to sell steadily over the years and retains a reputation as a key album in post-rock and experimental rock circles. The Blue period — mutation, disintegration and split (mid-1994) Now reduced to a duo of Sutton and Simnett, Bark Psychosis went on to record the Blue EP, released in May 1994, and promoted with a UK tour, also featuring Gish. The title track was comparatively more upbeat than the band's work on Hex (and was apparently therapeutic for Sutton, who was allegedly getting over the demise of a \\"stormy personal relationship\\" at the time). Blue was also very strongly influenced by dance music, sounding closer to a New Order pop single than it did to the moody post-rock of previous releases. The EP also featured a Rudi Tambala remix of the Hex track \\"Big Shot\\" and (confusingly) a newly recorded track called \\"Hex\\", featuring three- and-a-half minutes of deafening noise textures eventually dissolving into ambient keyboards and trumpet, which was also recorded in St John's Church. The EP was mixed at Metropolis Studios in West London. Blue clearly revealed that Sutton's interest was now heading towards programmed and sequenced rhythms. By this stage he was asking Simnett to replicate jungle breakbeats at speed on his kit. Bark Psychosis performed at the Britronica Festival in April 1994 in Moscow alongside Seefeel, Autechre, Ultramarine and Aphex Twin. After this concert, an increasingly sidelined Simnett left the band. (Six years later, Simnett would resurface in the instrumental post-rock band Yellow6, playing drums for their two live concerts in 2000 and subsequently moving to bass for five concerts in 2001.Yellow6 live info page retrieved 25 November 2008 He would also contribute to Porcupine Tree leader Steven Wilson's Incredible Expanding Mindfuck project.) Although Bark Psychosis never formally split up, Simnett's departure effectively ended the band, as Sutton had by now lost interest in experimental rock and become a full-scale convert to drum and bass music. In a 2001 interview, Sutton recalled, \\"By the end it was just me with Mark drumming and a nice pool of different people to draw upon. The last couple of tours we did in '94 I just loved. But by that point I knew I wanted to try something else.\\" Later in the summer, Sutton reunited with Daniel Gish to record some new tracks in an ambient and drum and bass style, which they performed at the 1994 Phoenix Festival at Stratford-upon-Avon). Although the duo's performance was billed under the Bark Psychosis name (and was technically the band's last appearance for ten years), it was in effect the debut of a brand new project which was only tenuously related to Bark Psychosis music. Later in 1994, 3rd Stone released a posthumous Bark Psychosis compilation album called Independency. This collected together the early Bark Psychosis singles and EPs on both Cheree and 3rd Stone, and included Scum in its entirety. In 1997, 3rd Stone released a second Bark Psychosis compilation album called Game Over, which combined early tracks (as previously released on Independency) with the Blue single and several tracks from Hex (including the studio outtake \\"Murder City\\"). It also contained a rare cover of the Wire song \\"Three Girl Rhumba\\" (from the Wire tribute album Whore). Game Over was not endorsed by the band. Post-split – Boymerang, .O.rang, and Sutton as producer (1994–2003) Following their Phoenix Festival performance, Sutton and Gish renamed their new drum and bass project Boymerang. The new tracks premiered at Phoenix were released as part of an EP (the first release by The Leaf Label), following which Gish left the project. Following his departure from Boymerang, Daniel Gish disappeared into the world of dance music to work in various mysteriously named subgenres referred to as \\"dark garage\\", \\"dreamhouse\\", and \\"night music\\": his current whereabouts are unknown. Now featuring Sutton alone, Boymerang released several more EPs and an album (1997's Balance Of The Force). A few musicians from the Bark Psychosis world — most notably trumpeter Del Crabtree — contributed to some tracks. Sutton also became a significant collaborator to .O.rang, the experimental band formed by former Talk Talk members Lee Harris and Paul Webb. He contributed instrumentation and programming to the Herd of Instinct and Fields And Waves albums as well as the Spoor EP; and remixed the track P53 for single release. In parallel to (and subsequent to) his activities with Boymerang and .O.rang, Graham Sutton made a name for himself as a record producer. He has produced albums by Jarvis Cocker, Delays, Snowpony, The Veils, Coldharbourstores, British Sea Power, Pellumair and Anjali Bhatia (ex-Voodoo Queens), plus early recordings by The $urplu$ (a band featuring David Callahan of Moonshake and The Wolfhounds). He has also produced single mixes and remixes for acts including Metallica, Goldie, Brakes, Mansun, Stephen Simmonds, Mandalay, Ed Rush, Collapsed Lung, Ultramarine and Wagon Christ.Information from Graham Sutton producer page @ Rough Trade , retrieved 25 November 2008 Bark Psychosis mark II (2004–present) After a ten-year hiatus, Sutton formally relaunched Bark Psychosis in 2004 and revealed that he had, in fact, been recording new Bark Psychosis tracks since 1999 with various collaborators. The project was now, in effect, a Graham Sutton solo project in all but name, with Sutton playing the majority of the instrumentation himself. Former band drummer Mark Simnett was present, but only in the form of unspecified sampled drum tracks. Sutton's most prominent collaborators were now Colin Bradley (better known as the guitarist from Dual) and the former Talk Talk/.O.rang drummer Lee Harris. Other contributors to the project were Anja Buechele (the singer for The $urplu$), bass player David Panos, New Zealand multi- instrumentalist Rachel Dreyer (piano, vocals, wood flute), Shaun Hyder (Sindhi tamboura), Alice Kemp (bowed guitar) and T.J. Mackenzie (trumpet). One of the clearest indications that the project had changed was that Sutton was now sharing his lead singer's role with others: Buechele and Dreyer covered many of the vocals, sometimes even singing entire songs. Conversely, a link with the past came from Pete Beresford who contributed vibraphone, reprising his role on Hex. The revitalized Bark Psychosis released a new album, ///Codename: Dustsucker on Fire Records in 2004 (accompanied by a new single called \\"The Black Meat\\"). ///Codename: Dustsucker revealed that Bark Psychosis was no longer confined by the formal limitations of either rock band or dance music project, as might have been expected. As opposed to Hex's more consistent approach (which worked the band's influences and ideas around an established rhythm section and melodic instrumentation, and which sounded like the work of an isolated live band with guests), Dustsucker was a diverse — even sprawling — collection of musical ideas. Sutton was exploring separate instrumentation from track to track, with the \\"trademark\\" Bark Psychosis approach to dynamics and atmosphere serving as the linking project identity. Although several pieces featured familiar Bark Psychosis ingredients (such as the interplay of Sutton's tremolo electric guitar and minimal keyboards), others were based around strummed acoustic guitar and resembled either folk music or some of the band's pre-\\"Scum\\" psychedelic work, while others had elements of cool jazz, Indian classical sounds, or — as in the case of \\"Shapeshifting\\" – a post- Boymerang fascination with the possibilities of extended rhythm and noise. Rather than make new pressings of the Independency and Game Over albums, 3rd Stone Ltd had apparently already planned to release a new compilation (Replay) featuring previously released material, deleted material and unreleased live tracks. Whether by accident or design, Replay was released at around the same time as ///Codename: Dustsucker. As had been the case with Game Over, the release was not endorsed by the band. In December 2004, American webzine Somewhere Cold voted Bark Psychosis Artist of the Year on their 2004 Somewhere Cold Awards Hall of Fame list. In May 2005, Bark Psychosis released the 400 Winters EP. This featured three Dustsucker album tracks \\"deconstructed and reassembled\\" by Colin Bradley. Current activity There has been little public activity from Bark Psychosis since 2005, mainly due to Sutton concentrating on his work as a producer. On 14 February 2008, Pendulum Man featured in the Adam Brooks movie Definitely Maybe (Universal International Pictures), the song also having appeared on the soundtrack to an Israeli documentary about Bryan Adams, and an Israeli dramatisation of Oliver Twist. In July 2017, it was announced that Bark Psychosis' debut album Hex will be reissued on both vinyl and CD on Fire Records.

Thermal cyclers may also be used in laboratories to facilitate other temperature-sensitive reactions, including restriction enzyme digestion or rapid diagnostics. The device has a thermal block with holes where tubes holding the reaction mixtures can be inserted. The cycler then raises and lowers the temperature of the block in discrete, pre-programmed steps. History Baby Blue, a prototype automated thermal cycler built around 1986 Biometra TRIO, a thermal cycler with touchscreen interface water baths at constant temperatures between which samples are moved with a robotic arm The earliest thermal cyclers were designed for use with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Since this enzyme is destroyed during each heating step of the amplification process, new enzyme had to be added every cycle. This led to a cumbersome machine based on an automated pipettor, with open reaction tubes. Later, the PCR process was adapted to the use of thermostable DNA polymerase from Thermus aquaticus, which greatly simplified the design of the thermal cycler. While in some old machines the block is submerged in an oil bath to control temperature, in modern PCR machines a Peltier element is commonly used. Quality thermal cyclers often contain silver blocks to achieve fast temperature changes and uniform temperature throughout the block. Other cyclers have multiple blocks with high heat capacity, each of which is kept at a constant temperature, and the reaction tubes are moved between them by means of an automated process. Miniaturized thermal cyclers have been created in which the reaction mixture moves via channel through hot and cold zones on a microfluidic chip. Thermal cyclers designed for quantitative PCR have optical systems which enable fluorescence to be monitored during reaction cycling. Modern innovations The user interface of a modern thermal cycler Modern thermal cyclers are equipped with a heated lid that presses against the lids of the reaction tubes. This prevents condensation of water from the reaction mixtures on the insides of the lids. Traditionally, a layer of mineral oil was used for this purpose. Some thermal cyclers are equipped with a fully adjustable heated lid to allow for nonstandard or diverse types of PCR plasticware. a thermal cycler with lid opened Some thermal cyclers are equipped with multiple blocks allowing several different PCRs to be carried out simultaneously. Some models also have a gradient function to allow for different temperatures in different parts of the block. This is particularly useful when testing suitable annealing temperatures for PCR primers.

Incident  The Douglas DC-8, en route from Paris to Haneda Airport in Tokyo with 156 people on board, stopped in Bombay, India. Shortly after taking off from Bombay, five armed JRA members, led by Osamu Maruoka, hijacked the aircraft and ordered it flown to Dhaka, Bangladesh. At Dhaka, the hijackers took the passengers and crew hostage, demanding US$6 million and the release of nine imprisoned JRA members. On 1 October Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda announced that the Japanese government would accept the hijackers' demands, on the principle that \\"the life of a single person outweighs the earth.\\" Six of the imprisoned JRA members were then released.Schreiber, p. 216. A chartered Japan Airlines flight carried the money and the six released JRA members to Dhaka, where the exchange took place on 2 October. The hijackers released 118 passengers and crew members. On 3 October, they flew to Kuwait City and Damascus, where they released eleven more hostages. Finally, the aircraft was flown to Algeria, where it was impounded by authorities and the remaining hostages were freed.  Aftermath  The incident contrasted Europe and the United States' approach of non-negotiation with terrorists to Japan's approach of appeasing terrorists if necessary. Shortly after the incident, Japan's National Police Agency established a Special Assault Team to deal with future acts of terrorism. Several of the JRA terrorists involved in the hijacking have yet to be apprehended and their current whereabouts are unknown.Schreiber, p. 216–217.

It is a type of small club system. In the Polish Club, a 1♣ opening bid is forcing for one round but does not necessarily show a strong hand; in most versions of this system it shows either a weak balanced hand (about 12-14HCP), a natural 1♣ opening or any strong hand. Consequently, bids of 1♦, 1♥ and 1♠ are limited to about 18HCP, and also 1♦ shows at least four diamonds (five in some versions of the system). The 2♣ opening is usually reserved to show a limited hand with long clubs and possibly a four-card major, similar to the Precision 2♣ opening.

He was best known for his historical novel, The Sand Pebbles which tells the story of an American sailor serving aboard a gunboat on the Chinese Yangtze River in 1925. Biography Early life McKenna was born in Mountain Home, Idaho, on May 9, 1913.Dictionary of North Carolina Biography Seeking more opportunities than could be found in such a rural part of the country at the height of the Great Depression, McKenna joined the U.S. Navy in 1931 at the age of 18. He served for 22 years, including 10 years of active sea duty. He served in World War II and the Korean War. He retired as a Chief Machinist's Mate. Because of the benefits of the GI Bill, McKenna was able to attend college at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, located in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where he studied creative writing. He also married a librarian, Eva, whom he met at the college. Writing career McKenna began his writing career publishing science fiction, and starting in 1958 he regularly attended the annual Milford Writer's Workshop for science fiction writers. \\"He had enormous talent,\\" writes his colleague Ben Bova in the book Notes to a Science Fiction Writer. His first science fiction story \\"Casey Agonistes\\" immediately established him as a writer to be watched when it appeared in the September 1958 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. Only a handful of his science fiction tales were published during his lifetime, but after his death several more appeared posthumously. McKenna's major work was The Sand Pebbles (1962), a 597-page novel later made into the well-known 1966 film of the same title. The protagonist was an enlisted career sailor on a U.S. Navy river gunboat named the San Pablo in China during the 1920s. McKenna himself served aboard a river gunboat on the Yangtze Patrol, but about ten years after the events in his novel and of more modern construction (San Pablo was an ancient gunboat seized from the Spanish in 1898). The Sand Pebbles won the $10,000 1963 Harper Prize Novel and was chosen as a Book-of-the-Month Club selection. Shortly after the movie deal was announced, McKenna appeared on the television quiz program “To Tell The Truth”, receiving one vote from the celebrity panel. McKenna's posthumously published short story \\"The Secret Place\\" won the Nebula Award for Best Short Story in 1966 and was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Short Story in 1967. Casey Agonistes and Other Science Fiction and Fantasy Stories (1973) collects the title story and four other short works: \\"Hunter Come Home\\", \\"The Secret Place\\", \\"Mine Own Ways\\", and \\"Fiddler's Green\\". The collections The Sons of Martha and The Left Handed Monkey Wrench were also published posthumously. Death McKenna died at his Chapel Hill N.C. home on November 4, 1964, at age 51.

It is presumed to have been named in honour of governor Richard Bourke's wife.The Royal Historical Society of Victoria: \\"Melbourne’s streets and lanes: what’s in a name?\\" , brochure published 2004 or later, retrieved 4 April 2013 The street is famous as a retail shopping precinct, particularly for motorcycles and cameras. It is also connected with key shopping and tourist destinations such as Bourke Street Mall, Melbourne's GPO, Melbourne Central Shopping Centre and Queen Victoria Market.  Geography  320x320px The street runs roughly north-south in-between Queen Street and Swanston Street. At the southern end the street terminates at Flinders Street station, whilst the northern end terminates at Grattan Street, north of the Haymarket Roundabout. Haymarket connects Elizabeth Street to Peel Street towards the south-west, Flemington Road to the north-west, Royal Parade to the north and Grattan Street to the East. This complex, high-traffic roundabout is further complicated by trams travelling through it on varying routes. Traffic lights were installed on the roundabout in 2011 to limit the dangerous complexity of the intersection, it having previously functioned as a normal roundabout.  Floods  Elizabeth Street is the lowest point in the Melbourne central business district, with land rising both to the east and west, and more gradually to the north. The street was built on top of a historic natural creek and has suffered numerous floods in Melbourne's history. Flash flooding south towards the Yarra River occurred in 1882, 1972 and more recently during the 2010 Victorian storms. The Elizabeth Street drain runs from Carlton in the north to the Yarra River in the south, carrying storm water from the inner northern suburbs and city centre. This drain is a significant source of pollutants entering the lower Yarra.  Notable buildings  Melbourne's GPO is located on the corner of Elizabeth & Bourke|310x310px Elizabeth Street is home to many historically important buildings, modern structures and works of art.

The street has been the home of motorbike retailing in inner Melbourne since 1903, the longest-existing such area in the world.  Transport  As well as Flinders Street station at the southern end, the western exit of Melbourne Central railway station is located at the intersection of Latrobe and Elizabeth Streets. A number of tram services run along the street, including route 19 trams to Coburg North, route 59 trams to Airport West and route 57 trams to West Maribyrnong.

It was first established in 1905 and celebrated its centenary of community activism in 2005. History The movement to form a Town Association (Progress) began early in 1905 in reaction to the non-responsiveness of the Brunswick Council to the concerns of residents. It was the first such body established in the Melbourne metropolitan area. It is likely the Brunswick Progress Association was the second one established in Australia, as a progress association was established at Ballarat in 1904. Australian Labor Party State Member of Parliament, and later Federal member for the seat of Bourke, Frank Anstey (1865-1940), was elected on the first Executive Committee of the Brunswick Town Association (Progress). Anstey had a long association with the organisation until his death in 1940. Maurice Blackburn succeeded Frank Anstey as Federal representative for the seat of Bourke and also maintained an active interest in the affairs of the Brunswick Progress Association. In the cold war atmosphere of 1953 the Brunswick Council passed a resolution not to enter into any correspondence with any person who is a communist or communist sympathiser. In Council elections in 1954 the Mayor and several councillors were defeated and in a meeting of Council the 'Anti-red law' was rescinded 18 votes to 4. In 1965 the Progress Association was at a low ebb of activity. Two new members, Vic Little and Vida Little, enlivened the organisation, which steadily grew in members as campaigns were launched on local issues and concerns of residents. In the 1960s and 70s, the Association was very active in opposition to the proposed F2 Freeway along the Merri Creek, ran a successful campaign for clean air, as Brunswick was then said to be the second most polluted city in Victoria. The clean air campaign in the 1960s was instrumental in establishing the Victorian Environment Protection Authority in 1972. In 1971 the Brunswick Progress Association combined with the West Brunswick Progress Association to object significantly to council plans to demolish the Mechanics' Institute, which was built in 1868. The National Trust also objected and the Mechanics' Institute was saved from the wreckers. In 1973, the Association was active in opposing council plans to demolish the Brunswick Town Hall on Sydney Road and replace it with a 5 story Civic Centre, costing in excess of $2 million. The Council plans were stopped with a poll of residents resulting in a no vote won by 7 to 1. In 1975 the Brunswick Progress Association instituted a campaign to get a Community Health Centre complex, the Brunswick City Council opposed it, the Centre was won with wide support from the community. The Moreland Community Health Service is now a multimillion-dollar community organisation servicing the health needs of the residents of the City of Moreland, with major centres on Glenlyon Road in Brunswick, and Bell street in Coburg. Other campaigns included: * the condition of Sydney Road * Nicholson Street Tram Extension * the fight for half rates for pensioners throughout Victoria * the fight to put the Richmond- Brunswick Power line underground * the struggle to keep the Upfield railway line open * campaigns against many factories working at night affecting residents sleep * support for Friends of the ABC * opposition to uranium mining in Jabiluka in the Northern Territory * support for public housing, public transport * support for Aboriginal land rights * opposition to privatisation of public utilities * support for tax reform and opposition to the Goods and Services Tax The Association meets at the Clarrie Wohlers Citizens' Centre, Fleming Park, on the corner of Albert and Cross Streets, East Brunswick.

A river gunboat is a type of gunboat adapted for river operations. River gunboats required shallow draft for river navigation. They would be armed with relatively small caliber cannons, or a mix of cannons and machine guns. If they carried more than one cannon, one might be a howitzer, for shore bombardment. They were usually not armoured. The fictional USS San Pablo described in Richard McKenna's The Sand Pebbles is an example of this class of vessel, serving on the US Navy's Yangtze Patrol. Stronger river warships were river monitors.  Chinese river gunboats  Imperial German Navy river gunboat SMS Otter ca. 1909 during trials on the Weser Various European powers, the USA, and Japan, maintained flotillas of these shallow draft gunboats patrolling Chinese rivers. These gunboats were enforcing those nations' treaty rights under the treaties that China had started to sign following her defeat during the first Opium War with Britain. The advantages of steam power and shallow drafts meant that the new European vessels initially vastly outclassed anything available to the Chinese. Foreign powers had received concessions from China, like extraterritoriality for their citizens in China, and the gunboats policed these rights.  British  Royal Navy (RN) gunboats, numbering on average 15 a year in Chinese waters, served as \\"station ships\\", assigned to specific ports, and were designed for river functions. The RN maintained patrols and escorts up and down the Yangtze based in Shanghai until the end of the International Concessions in 1941. These boats were part of the Navy's China Station and vessels of various classes were deployed and often moved to and from other major world rivers. The Navy had built a large number of gunboats for the Crimean war in the 1850s and several of these found their way to the China Station afterwards. As these boats were scrapped they were replaced by types purpose built for inshore and river service around the world, Beacon- and later Frolic-class boats. The purpose built river vessels of the Insect and Fly classes which had seen service in the Mesopotamian Campaign in the Middle East and on the Danube during the First World War were deployed to China during the interbellum and took part in events of the period of the Japanese invasion of China and the beginning of the Pacific theatre of the Second World War. Ladybird and Bee were involved in the USS Panay incident. The Insects were supplemented in 1937 by the Dragonfly-class boats, three of which, Dragonfly, Grasshopper and Scorpion were involved in the fighting down the Malay Peninsula and Singapore.  United States  U.S. Navy craft were of varying age, design, size, and utility. The earliest craft made brief excursions upriver between 1861 and 1901, but were rarely assigned on permanent patrol. In 1901 two large gunboats, USS Helena (1290 tons and crew of 170) and Wilmington (1570 tons and 212), were assigned to the Asiatic Squadron's \\"Second Division\\" as permanent river patrol, although too large to patrol deep inland, until 1932 and 1923 respectively. In 1903 converted gunboats of the Spanish Navy captured in 1898, began patrols designed to take them further upriver toward Chungking. USS Elcano, a 620-ton craft with a crew of 103, and USS Villalobos, a 350-ton ship with 50 men, served until 1928, when they were decommissioned and sunk. USS Callao (240 tons) and Quiros (sister ship to Villalobos) served until 1916 and 1923. In 1914 two 204-ton, 50-man patrol craft of British design and built at Mare Island Naval Shipyard were disassembled, shipped to China, and reassembled in Shanghai. USS Palos patrolled until 1934, when she became the station boat at Chungking, and Monocacy until 1939. The Yangtze Patrol was formally established in 1922 as a component of the Asiatic Fleet. Six new craft were designed and built in 1928 in Shanghai, of three differing sizes. USS Guam and Tutuilla, 380 tons and a crew of 60, were able to ply the entire river year round. USS Panay and Oahu, 450 tons and a complement of 65; and Luzon, 560 tons and 82 men, were \\"May–September\\" gunboats, able to patrol completely upriver only during high water months. (Luzons sister ship, USS Mindanao served on the China coast but not in the river patrol.) Except for Panay, sunk by Japanese aircraft in December 1937, the newer ships served in China until late 1941.

He began acting at the age of five and in 1932 formed a theater company with his brother Peppino and sister Titina, called compagnia del Teatro Umoristico I De Filippo. Peppino left the troupe in 1944 and Titina departed by the early 1950s. After the war, in 1948 he bought the S. Ferdinando theatre in Naples, inaugurated in 1954. De Filippo starred in De Sica's L'oro di Napoli with Totò and Sophia Loren in 1954. In 1973, Franco Zeffirelli's production of De Filippo's 1959 play Sabato, domenica e lunedi (translated as Saturday, Sunday, Monday), starring Joan Plowright, Frank Finlay and Laurence Olivier, was presented at London's National Theatre and won the London drama critics' award.Cassell Dictionary of Italian Literature - Page 164McGraw-Hill encyclopedia of world drama: an international ...: Volume 1 - Page 19 He was married three times. His first wife was Dorothy Pennington. From his second wife, the actress Thea Prandi, he had two children: Luisa \\"Luisella\\" and Luca. The couple divorced in 1959. His daughter Luisella died aged 10 in 1960, shortly before her mother's death in 1961. His third wife was writer and playwright Isabella Quarantotti. The actress Angelica Ippolito is his step- daughter, born to Isabella Quarantotti and her first husband, the scientist Felice Ippolito. De Filippo died in 1984 in Rome. His artistic legacy was inherited by his son Luca.

Squamishes occur in those fjords oriented in a northeast- southwest or east-west direction where cold polar air can be funneled westward, the opposite of how the wind generally flows on the Coast. These winds in winter can create high windchills by coastal standards of . They are notable in Jervis, Toba, and Bute Inlets and in Dean Channel and the Portland Canal. Squamishes lose their strength when free of the confining fjords and are not noticeable more than 25 km offshore. On the Northern Washington including the Lynden and Bellingham, and Lower Mainland and Eastern Vancouver Island of British Columbia, where they are mainly referred to as outflow winds, they are noticeable especially in the winter, when a cold Arctic air mass holding in the high plateau country of the interior flows down to the sea through the canyons and lower passes piercing the Coast Mountains and crossing the Strait of Georgia. The town of Squamish, British Columbia, is named for the wind, and upper Howe Sound, just off the Squamish River estuary, is known widely in the windsurfing and kiteboarding worlds for its excellent, steady winds. During the Christmas season of 1996, a major blizzard which brought record snowfalls to the Lower Mainland and Eastern Vancouver Island was followed up by hurricane-force winds pouring west through the towns of the Fraser Valley, as the coastal system's strength – which had brought the snow – was forced back by the breaking of the interior's cold air mass. Intense outflow winds are relatively common year-round (during stormy weather, and sometimes fair) in the Upper Fraser Valley, particularly on Sumas Prairie between Abbotsford and Chilliwack, and farther upriver towards the mouth of the Fraser Canyon. Known by different names in each region up the Coast, outflow winds or squamishes are also major maritime threats off the openings of the major fjords and up their narrow, deep lengths. Queen Charlotte Strait in particular is known for heavy winds coming out of the mouth of Knight Inlet, at the upper east end of the strait.

It is available on a number of broadcasts around Australia, including AM/FM radio, DAB+ radio, free to air digital TV, some pay-TV platforms and online. Originally called the Parliamentary and News Network (PNN), the AM/FM radio network is chartered to broadcast live the proceedings of parliament, either the House of Representatives or the Senate, as specified by the standing orders. Also broadcast, at the end of each day's sitting, is a recording of Question Time for the chamber that was not broadcast live that day. These restrictions do not apply to the other broadcasts of NewsRadio. Parliamentary broadcasting was commenced by Ben Chifley's government on 10 July 1946, on ABC Radio. These broadcasts received their own frequencies in the 1980s as PNN. The PNN/ABC NewsRadio service was introduced in August 1994 to use the Parliamentary broadcasting frequencies which were not being used when Parliament was not in session. ABC NewsRadio has a 24-hour news format, including extensive finance, science and IT reports, as well as extended reports from the ABC's local and international news sources. ABC NewsRadio also rebroadcasts international programming from the BBC, DW-Radio, Radio Netherlands and All Things Considered from NPR. On AM and FM radio, ABC News also broadcasts Australian Football League matches on weekends in New South Wales and Queensland, where the National Rugby League is the more popular football competition and thus is broadcast on ABC Local Radio services in those two states. ABC NewsRadio callsigns for stations on the AM radio band are always xPB, where x is the number denoting the particular state or territory and PB stands for Parliamentary Broadcasting. ABC News on Radio stations on the FM radio band use callsigns of the format xPNN. ABC NewsRadio also uses resources from around the world such as news bulletins and programs from the BBC. From September 2001, the 24-hour news format began live audio streaming on the Internet. When Parliament is in session, listeners who have Internet access may still receive the NewsRadio service even when the News on Radio network is broadcasting Parliamentary proceedings over the air. From 2004, this was extended to FTA digital satellite and subscription TV services. In 2009, separate standard and parliamentary feeds were launched on digital terrestrial (DAB+) radio in the state capitals. FM transmission was expanded greatly during a 2006-2009 program. It planned to increase the AM/FM coverage from 78% of the population to 95%. In November 2016, the ABC announced that ABC NewsRadio and ABC News 24 rebranded as ABC News on 10 April 2017.

John Constable painted a number of paintings in and around Stratford. Stratford (the ford of the Roman Via Strata) with its attached hamlet of Higham sits on the Suffolk/Essex border on the River Stour, Suffolk. It is from London just off the A12 between Colchester and Ipswich. The village has a fifteenth-century flint faced church which is clearly visible from the A12. It is also served by a primary school, post office and village store, and three pubs. Stratford village is within the Stratford Vale which is also recognised as an area of outstanding natural beauty. History of the parish Evidence of Stratford's antiquity includes traces of a henge from c. 4,000BC, and Roman remains on Gun Hill. The original Saxon settlement comprising 30 tenants and a mill mentioned in Domesday Book was abandoned as settlement grew along the river and the road to Bergholt. A series of manorial court rolls beginning in 1318 reveal that many of the medieval families were connected with the wool trade which accounts for much of its early prosperity. Benefactors included wealthy clothiers like the Mors (or Morse) family who generously endowed the church. Stratford's long, straggling main street lined with inns, provides evidence of its bustling prosperity in the coaching days when the town catered for a continuous traffic of cattle, turkeys and geese bound for the London market. The parish was in the hundred of Samford. The national censuses from 1801 and 1901 record just over 500 inhabitants in the parish. Places of historical interest in the village Lowe Hill House, the finest of the surviving houses, dates from c.1480 and is described in the 1619 manorial survey, although it is probably not the original manor house. Ravenys on one of the sites is the subject of a picture by John Constable entitled \\"a house in Water Lane\\", now in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The Lord of the Manor made a grant of the land on which it stands to William Smyth and William Wade in 1442 on condition that they rebuilt the house for which the lord would provide timber for the \\"grounsill, overweys and prynspales\\", the two Williams being responsible for the cutting and carting of it. It is impossible to be certain of the earlier names of the other two cottages, but the second structure, which incorporates a small portion of an earlier building stands on or very close to what was the home of the Wynter family. For 240 years from 1318 the Wynters farmed a smallholding in the meadows just south of it. The third house in the lane was most probably the home of the Selbricht family until it died out in 1558. The remaining house in this part of the village, which stands two hundred yards nearer to the river, was occupied by Matilda Hunt in 1481. The barn behind it is still known as Hunt's Barn. Gatemans, the home of weaver Ralph Gateman in 1334, is now the oldest surviving house in the village. Thornes was the original name of the house front frontage behind Gatemans; significantly enlargened in the 19th century and later and is now known as Courtlands. Fyshers was the original name of the house now occupied by the redbrick Old Cage House, named after the pound for stray cattle and horses that once occupied the site of the parish room cottage holding for the proverbial \\"three acres and a cow\\". Three original houses survive on the next six half acre holdings, the rest have been replaced as more cottages have been squeezed in. Further towards the river in Lower Street the houses were always packed closer together. In 1587 Sir William Fisher the elder who lived either in Rose Bank or The Old Cottage next door complained of the noisy and noisome \\"hoggiscote and hennesroust\\" placed against his wall by Ralph Boyfield. Three coaching inns – The Anchor, The Swan and the Black Horse – grew up as a result of the growing traffic through the village. The Anchor had of pasture for cattle bound for the London market. The Swan which is described in Road Books as a posting-house, had extensive stabling and accommodation for casual labourers who followed the progress of Haysel and Harvest from south to north through East Anglia. George II stayed here for a few hours in 1737. The Black Horse has connections with the highwayman Mathew Keys, hanged on Kennington Common in 1751, who once left his watch here as a pledge for a reckoning. Goose acre, the marshy pightle attached to the Corner House, provided an overnight pen for geese and turkeys en route to London, as did the ground behind Riversdale house. Fords, a fine timber house with a meadow alongside opposite the Black Horse, is close to a narrow strip of waste land which marks the line of the old London road. The road now passes close to the front of the cottages on the river bank now known as \\"the Island\\" and across the eastern end of the Talbooth Hotel. Le Talbooth, originally known as Leggs, was formerly a pair of cottages with their own quay and lime kiln. Chalk was brought by barge from Great Cornard near Sudbury and coal from Manningtree and Mistley. It was first described as the Tolbooth in 1659. Merchandise was weighed here and tolls charged for upkeep of the tall, narrow toll bridge. The weirs and locks placed across the river made the area prone to flooding when the river rose. Skalders, (now replaced by Riversdale, the modern house next to Fords) was the home of the Mors family for 200 years. Thomas Mors, the first to appear in the records, was one of three wealthy clothiers in the village, and a generous benefactor to the church. His wife Margaret Webb from Dedham and her parents played a large part in building and improving the church. Azal Mors, the last of the family, sold most of the family property in 1615 and left the village. His mother stayed in the family home to live on the rents of two or three cottages and her half share in the new water mill. The old Stratford Mill shown in Constable's painting dates from around 1600. A group of Sudbury Merchants and gentlemen formed \\"The Stower Navigation Company\\" in 1708, making the river navigable to bring coal upriver and to transport corn, straw and hay downstream to be offloaded and shipped to London. It was a busy, prosperous waterway until the railways took away the trade. The mill was demolished about 1850 and replaced by a vast structure of five floors with a undershot water wheel and an auxiliary steam engine for use when the river was low. Stratford Hall Manor had three great Open Fields: Stregmer, Hatters Field and East Croft. The Common Meadow was about , running along the Stour between the river and the west side of the village. Several substantial Tudor Halls were constructed by wealthy clothiers and gentry, including the Manor of Veyseys and Veyseys Farm; the Woadhouse and its attached buildings, built by Thomas Woadhouse of Dedham in 1501 to replace a much older hall called Afrettles; Typlands Farm, Leatherjacket Farm and Squirrels Hall to the north from c. 1480.

The historical texts Records of the Three Kingdoms and Book of the Later Han record Hua Tuo as the first person in China to use anaesthesia during surgery. He used a general anaesthetic combining wine with a herbal concoction called mafeisan (; literally \\"cannabis boil powder\\"). Besides being respected for his expertise in surgery and anaesthesia, Hua Tuo was famous for his abilities in acupuncture, moxibustion, herbal medicine and medical Daoyin exercises. He developed the Wuqinxi (; literally \\"Exercise of the Five Animals\\") from studying movements of the tiger, deer, bear, ape and crane. Historical accounts Statue of Hua Tuo at the Mengjia Longshan Temple in Taipei Statue of Hua Tuo at Guangdong Medical College in Dongguan Hua Tuo Memorial Hall in Bozhou, Anhui Hua Tuo studying monkey movements Yuanmen Maijue Neizhao Tu (), a chart of the internal viscera and organs. Attributed to Hua Tuo. Imprint of the Qing dynasty. The oldest extant biographies of Hua Tuo are found in the official Chinese histories for the Eastern Han dynasty (25-220) and Three Kingdoms period (220-280) of China. The third-century historical text Records of Three Kingdoms (Sanguozhi) and fifth-century historical text Book of the Later Han (Houhanshu) record that Hua Tuo was from Qiao County (), Pei Commandery (), which is in present-day Bozhou, Anhui, and that he studied Chinese classics throughout Xu Province (covering parts of present-day Jiangsu and Shandong provinces). He refused employment offers from high-ranking officials (e.g. Chen Gui) and chose to practise medicine. The dates of Hua Tuo's life are uncertain. Estimations range from 110 to 207, and from 190 to 265 conclude that the \\"best estimate\\" is circa 145-208. Hua Tuo was an older contemporary of the physician Zhang Zhongjing (150-219). The name Hua Tuo combines the Chinese surname Hua (, literally \\"magnificent; China\\") with the uncommon Chinese given name Tuo ( literally \\"hunchback\\" or literally \\"steep hill\\"). He was also known as Hua Fu (; literally \\"apply [powder/ointment/etc.]\\"), and his courtesy name was Yuanhua (; literally \\"primal transformation\\"). Some scholars believe that he learned Ayurveda medical techniques from early Buddhist missionaries in China. Victor H. Mair describes him as \\"many hundreds of years ahead of his time in medical knowledge and practice\\", and suggests his name Hua Tuo, which was roughly pronounced ghwa-thā in Old Chinese, could derive from the Sanskrit term agada \\"medicine; toxicology\\". Several stories in Hua Tuo's biography \\"have a suspiciously Ayurvedic character to them\\" and he was active \\"in the areas where the first Buddhist communities were established in China\\". Hua Tuo's biography in the Sanguozhi describes him as resembling a Daoist xian (; \\"immortal\\") and details his medical techniques. Hua Tuo's biography in the Houhanshu explains this mafeisan \\"numbing boiling powder\\" decoction was dissolved in jiu (; literally \\"alcoholic beverage; wine\\"). His prescription for mafeisan anaesthetic liquor was lost or destroyed, along with all of his writings. The Book of Sui lists five medical books attributed to Hua Tuo and his disciples, but none are extant. The subsequent portion of Hua Tuo's biography in the Sanguozhi lists 16 medical cases: ten internal medicine, three surgical, two gynaecological, and one paediatric case. Hua Tuo's treatment of diseases was centred on internal medicine, but also included surgery, gynaecology and paediatrics. He removed parasites, performed abortions and treated ulcers, sores and analgesia. For example: Cao Cao (155-220), a warlord who rose to power towards the end of the Han dynasty and laid the foundation for the Cao Wei state in the Three Kingdoms period, is probably Hua Tuo's best known patient. He suffered from chronic headaches, which were possibly caused by a brain tumour. Cao Cao's condition has also been translated as \\"migraine headaches accompanied by mental disturbance and dizziness\\" and the acupuncture point on the sole as identified as Yongquan (; \\"bubbling fountain\\"). Cao Cao ordered Hua Tuo to be his personal physician – a job Hua Tuo resented. In order to avoid treating Cao Cao, Hua Tuo repeatedly made excuses that his wife was ill, but Cao Cao discovered the deception and ordered Hua Tuo's execution. Xun Yu, one of Cao Cao's advisers, pleaded for mercy on behalf of the physician. Hua Tuo wrote down his medical techniques while awaiting execution, but destroyed his Qing Nang Shu (; literally \\"green bag book\\", which became a Classical Chinese term for \\"medical practices text\\"). This loss to traditional Chinese medicine was irreplaceable. Ilza Veith notes that, \\"Unfortunately, Hua T'o's works were destroyed; his surgical practices fell into disuse, with the exception of his method of castration, which continued to be practised. Due to the religious stigma attached to the practice of surgery, the social position accorded to the surgeon became increasingly lower and thus made a revival of Chinese surgery impossible.\\" A Liezi legend claims that the renowned physician Bian Que ( 500 BCE) used anaesthesia to perform a double heart transplantation, but the fourth-century text was compiled after Hua Tuo used mafeisan. Cao Cao later regretted executing Hua Tuo when his son Cao Chong (196–208), a child prodigy who may have independently discovered and used Archimedes' principle, died from illness. The Sanguozhi does not specify Hua Tuo's exact date of death, but since Cao Chong died in 208, Hua Tuo could not have lived past that year. Hua Tuo's biography ends with accounts of his disciples Wu Pu () and Fan A (). Fan A was skilled at acupuncture and inserted the needles to extraordinary depths. Victor H. Mair notes this unusual name may indicate Fan A was a foreigner, and this area was around present-day Tongshan County, Jiangsu, the \\"location of the first known Buddhist community in China\\". These herbs are qiye (; Toxicodendron vernicifluum leaves) and qingdian (; Sigesbeckia orientalis). The Song dynasty Confucianist scholar Ye Mengde (1077–1148) criticised the Sanguozhi and Houhanshu biographies of Hua Tuo as being mythological. His \\"Physicians Cannot Raise the Dead\\" essay repeated the descriptions of Hua Tuo using anaesthesia to perform internal surgery, and reasoned, In later times, a set of 34 paravertebral acupuncture points was named \\"Hua Tuo Jiaji\\" () in his honour. Hua Tuo is considered a shenyi (, \\"divine physician\\") and is worshipped as a medicinal god or immortal in Daoist temples. \\"Hua Tuo zaishi\\" (; \\"Hua Tuo reincarnated\\") is also a term of respect for a highly-skilled physician. Fictional accounts Woodblock by Utagawa Kuniyoshi depicting Hua Tuo operating on Guan Yu In the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Hua Tuo heals the general Guan Yu, who is hit by a poisoned arrow in the arm during the Battle of Fancheng in 219. Hua Tuo offers to anaesthetise Guan Yu, but he simply laughs and says that he is not afraid of pain. Hua Tuo uses a knife to cut the flesh from Guan Yu's arm and scrape the poison from the bone, and the sounds strike fear into all those who heard them. During this excruciating treatment, Guan Yu continues to play a game of weiqi with Ma Liang without flinching from pain. When Ma Liang asks him later, Guan Yu says that he feigned being unhurt to keep the morale of his troops high. After Hua Tuo's successful operation, Guan Yu allegedly rewards him with a sumptuous banquet, and offers a gift of 100 ounces of gold, but Hua Tuo refuses, saying that a physician's duty is to heal patients and not to make profit. Although Hua Tuo historically died in 208, a decade before Guan Yu fought at the Battle of Fancheng, this story of him performing surgery on Guan Yu has become a popular artistic theme. Hua Tuo is later summoned by Cao Cao to cure a chronic excruciating pain in his head, which turns out to be due to a brain tumour. Hua Tuo tells Cao Cao that in order to remove the tumor, it would be necessary to open up the brain by cutting open the head, getting the tumor out, and sewing it back, with Cao Cao completely anesthesized in the process. However, Cao Cao suspects that Hua Tuo is planning to murder him so he has Hua Tuo arrested and imprisoned. (Cao Cao's suspicions are in part due to a previous attempt by Ji Ping, an imperial physician, to force him to consume poisoned medicine.) In Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Hua Tuo passes his Qing Nang Shu to a prison guard so that his medical legacy will live on. He dies in prison later. The prison guard's wife burnt the book for fear of being implicated, but the guard manages to salvage some pages, which are about how to emasculate hen and ducks; the other pages are lost forever. Mafeisan Hua Tuo's innovative anaesthetic mafeisan (literally \\"cannabis boiling powder\\", considered to be the first anesthetic in the world), which was supposedly used on Hua Tuo's patients during surgery, is a long-standing mystery. The Records of the Three Kingdoms and the Book of the Later Han both credit him as creating this anesthetic during the Eastern Han Dynasty. However, no written record or ingredients of the original have been found, although estimations have been made by Chinese medical practitioners in later periods of time. There is controversy over the historical existence of mafeisan in Chinese literature. The name mafeisan combines ma (; \\"cannabis; hemp; numbed\\"), fei (; \\"boiling; bubbling\\") and san (; \\"break up; scatter; medicine in powder form\\"). Ma can mean \\"cannabis; hemp\\" and \\"numbed; tingling\\" (e.g. mazui \\"anesthetic; narcotic\\"), which is semantically \\"derived from the properties of the fruits and leaves, which were used as infusions for medicinal purposes\\". Modern Standard Chinese mafei is reconstructed as Old Chinese *mrâipəts, Late Han Chinese maipus (during Hua Tuo's life), and Middle Chinese mapjwəi. Many sinologists and scholars of traditional Chinese medicine have guessed at the anaesthetic components of mafei powder. Frederick P. Smith contends that Hua Tuo, \\"the Machaon of Chinese historical romance\\", used yabulu (; \\"Mandragora officinarum\\") rather than huoma (; \\"cannabis\\") and mantoulo (; \\"Datura stramonium\\", nota bene, Hua's given name \\"Tuo\\") \\"infused in wine, and drunk as a stupefying medicine\\". Herbert Giles (1897:323) translates mafeisan as \\"hashish\\"; and his son Lionel Giles identifies \\"hemp- bubble-powder\\" as \\"something akin to hashish or bhang\\". Ilza Veith quotes the sinologist Erich Hauer's \\"opinion that ma-fei () means opium\\". Victor H. Mair notes that mafei \\"appears to be a transcription of some Indo-European word related to \\"morphine\\"\\". Although Friedrich Sertürner first isolated morphine from opium in 1804, Mair suggests, \\"It is conceivable that some such name as morphine was already in use before as a designation for the anaesthetic properties of this opium derivative or some other naturally occurring substance.\\" Wang Zhenguo and Chen Ping find consensus among \\"scientists of later generations\\" that mafei contained yangjinhua (; \\"Datura stramonium\\") and wutou (; \\"rhizome of Aconitum, Chinese monkshood\\") or caowu (; \\"Aconitum kusnezofflin; Kusnezoff monkshood\\"). Lu Gwei-Djen and Joseph Needham suggest Hua Tuo may have discovered surgical analgesia by acupuncture, \\"quite apart from the stupefying potions for which he became so famous – if so he kept it to himself and his immediate disciples so that the secret did not survive\\".

It is the simplest example of an aryl azo compound. The term 'azobenzene' or simply 'azo' is often used to refer to a wide class of similar compounds. These azo compounds are considered as derivatives of diazene (diimide), and are sometimes referred to as 'diazenes'. The diazenes absorb light strongly and are common dyes. Structure and synthesis X-ray crystallography reveals the highly nonplanar, twisted structure for cis- azobenzene. trans-Azobenzene is planar. The N-N distance is 1.189 Å. cis- Azobenzene is nonplanar with a C-N=N-C dihedral angle of 173.5°. The N-N distance is 1.251 Å. Azobenzene was first described by Eilhard Mitscherlich in 1834. Yellowish-red crystalline flakes of azobenzene were obtained in 1856. Its original preparation is similar to the modern one. According to the 1856 method, nitrobenzene is reduced by iron filings in the presence of acetic acid. In the modern synthesis, zinc is the reductant in the presence of a base. Industrial electrosynthesis using nitrobenzene is also employed. The trans isomer is more stable by approximately 50 kJ/mol, and the barrier to isomerization in the ground state is approximately 100 kJ/mol. Azobenzene photoisomerization. The trans form (left) can be converted to the cis form (right) using a UV wavelength of 300–400 nm. Visible illumination at >400 nm converts the molecule back to the trans form. Alternately, the molecule will thermally relax to the stable trans form. Photoisomerization of methoxyazobenzene results in reversible color change Reactions Azobenzene is a weak base, but undergoes protonation at one nitrogen with a pKa = -2.95. It functions as a Lewis base, e.g. toward boron trihalides. It binds to low valence metal centers, e.g. Ni(Ph2N2)(PPh3)2 is well characterized. It oxidizes to give azoxybenzene. Hydrogenation gives diphenylhydrazine. Trans-cis isomerization Azobenzene (and derivatives) undergo photoisomerization of trans and cis isomers. cis-Azobenzene relaxes back, in dark, to the trans isomer. Such thermal relaxation is slow at room temperature. The two isomers can be switched with particular wavelengths of light: ultraviolet light, which corresponds to the energy gap of the π-π* (S2 state) transition, for trans-to-cis conversion, and blue light, which is equivalent to that of the n-π* (S1 state) transition, for cis-to-trans isomerization. For a variety of reasons, the cis isomer is less stable than the trans (for instance, it has a distorted configuration and is less delocalized than the trans configuration). Photoisomerization allows for reversible energy storage (as photoswitches). Spectroscopic classification The wavelengths at which azobenzene isomerization occurs depends on the particular structure of each azo molecule, but they are typically grouped into three classes: the azobenzene-type molecules, the aminoazobenzenes, and the pseudo-stilbenes. These azos are yellow, orange, and red, respectively, owing to the subtle differences in their electronic absorption spectra. The compounds similar to the unsubstituted azobenzene exhibit a low-intensity n-π* absorption in the visible region, and a much higher intensity π-π* absorption in the ultraviolet. Azos that are ortho- or para-substituted with electron-donating groups (such as aminos), are classified as aminoazobenzenes, and tend to closely spaced n-π* and π-π* bands in the visible. The pseudo-stilbene class is characterized by substituting the 4 and 4' positions of the two azo rings with electron-donating and electron- withdrawing groups (that is, the two opposite ends of the aromatic system are functionalized). The addition of this push-pull configuration results in a strongly asymmetric electron distribution, which modifies a host of optical properties. In particular, it shifts the absorption spectra of the trans and the cis isomers, so that they effectively overlap. Thus, for these compounds a single wavelength of light in the visible region will induce both the forward and reverse isomerization. Under illumination, these molecules cycle between the two isomeric states. Photophysics of isomerization The photo- isomerization of azobenzene is extremely rapid, occurring on picosecond timescales. The rate of the thermal back-relaxation varies greatly depending on the compound: usually hours for azobenzene-type molecules, minutes for aminoazobenzenes, and seconds for the pseudo-stilbenes. The mechanism of isomerization has been the subject of some debate, with two pathways identified as viable: a rotation about the N-N bond, with disruption of the double bond, or via an inversion, with a semi-linear and hybridized transition state. It has been suggested that the trans-to-cis conversion occurs via rotation into the S2 state, whereas inversion gives rise to the cis-to-trans conversion. It is still under discussion which excited state plays a direct role in the series of the photoisomerization behavior. However, the latest research on femtosecond transition spectroscopy has suggested that the S2 state undergoes internal conversion to the S1 state, and then the trans-to-cis isomerization proceeds. Recently another isomerization pathway has been proposed by Diau, the \\"concerted inversion\\" pathway in which both CNN bond angles bend at the same time. Photoinduced motions The photo- isomerization of azobenzene is a form of light-induced molecular motion. This isomerization can also lead to motion on larger length scales. For instance, polarized light will cause the molecules to isomerize and relax in random positions. However, those relaxed (trans) molecules that fall perpendicular to the incoming light polarization will no longer be able to absorb, and will remain fixed. Thus, there is a statistical enrichment of chromophores perpendicular to polarized light (orientational hole burning). Polarized irradiation will make an azo-material anisotropic and therefore optically birefringent and dichroic. This photo-orientation can also be used to orient other materials (especially in liquid crystal systems).

In the , Gordon Park had a population of 4,231 people. Geography Gordon Park is located from the Brisbane CBD and is bordered by Kedron Brook to the east and south, with its bike-paths, walking tracks and large off-leash dog park, and Stafford Road to the north. It features several cafés. Gordon Park’s unique position within Brisbane’s inner northern belt provides immediate access to major infrastructure such as the Airport Link M7 and Northern Busway. Over 37% of households in this area consist of couples with children, 40% are couples without children and 18% are single parent families. Stand alone housing accounts for 65% of all dwellings in this area, and units account for a further 28%. Highset Queenslanders, many beautifully renovated, are a feature of this green and leafy suburb. In June 2018 the median prices for a house and an apartment in Gordon Park were $889,100 (12% higher than last year) and $355,200 respectively. Gordon Park shares an Australia Post postcode of 4031 with neighbouring suburb Kedron. History The Turrbal clan occupied the northern side of the Brisbane River. This clan was often referred to by the \\"whites\\" as the \\"Duke of York's\\" clan. There were camping grounds around the Breakfast Creek area and the explorers John Oxley and Allan Cunningham met members of the clan at the mouth of the Creek in 1824. The main encampment of the Turrbal clan was in \\"Yorks Hollow\\". This gully passes through Victoria Park and the Royal National Association Showgrounds at Bowen Hills. In 1858 two Aborigines, Dalinkua and Dalpie from the Breakfast Creek area, wrote letters to The Moreton Bay Courier protesting about the treatment their people received at the hands of the white settlers. The suburb was named after General Gordon who was the hero of the eight-month siege of Khartoum in the Sudan in the late 19th century. Most of the street names in the suburb relate to General Gordon, the armies he served with, and their sphere of operation (for example, Gordon Street, Khartoum Street, and Baker Street). The Gordon Estate – Lutwyche of 264 blocks went to auction on 25 September 1886. The Metropolitan Freehold Land and Building Company Limited advertised Gordon Park Estate for auction on 13 December 1890. It consisted of 1063 allotments (mostly of 16 to 20 perches). This estate was bounded by Stafford Road to the north, Gordon Street to the east, Kedron Brook to the south and Burnaby Street (now Burnaby Terrace) to the west, encompassing almost all of the present day suburb except for the south-western corner. However, the auctioneer G.T. Bell only sold 73 lots for an average price of £26 3s 7d (total £1,2917 10s). On 27 March 1920, auctioneers Cameron Brothers offered 61 allotments in the south-west of the current suburb in the area of Granville Terrace (now Bedford Street), Aberdeen Terrace and Thistle Street (these did not form part of the 1890 subdivision). In June 1920, the auctioners offered further blocks to the south of the March 1920 sales, in the area of Granville Terrace (now Bedford Street), Stirling Street and Montrose Street. On 18 September 1920, auctioneers Isles, Love & Co offered 150 allotments in the Glenkedron South Estate Section 2 (in the north-east of the current suburb). The allotments were in First Avenue (now Suez Street), Second Avenue (now Swan Street), Third Avenue (now Goulburn Street), Fourth Avenue (now Jack Street), Fifth Avenue (now Barron Street) and Seventh Avenue (now Rose Lane). On 6 May 1922, auctioneers Cameron Brothers offered 98 allotments for sale in the north-west of the current suburb in the area of Main Happy Valley Road (Stafford Road), Haig Street, Burnaby Street (now Burnaby Terrace), Turner Road (now Alva Terrace) and Victoria Terrace. These were part of the ninth second of the Gordon Park estate that had been first offered in 1890. On 11 November 1922, auctioneers Cameron Brothers offered 47 allotments in Section 1A of the Glen Park estate (as first offered in 1890). These allotments were in the area of Cowper Street, Hill Street (now Highland Street), Beaconsfield Terrace, Richmond Street and Khartoum Street. On 8 December 1923, auctioneers Cameron Brothers offered 45 home sites in the area of Granville Terrace (now Bedford Street), Aberdeen Terrace and Thistle Street. On 10 May 1924, auctioneers Isles, Love & Co offered 24 remaining allotments in the Glenkedron South Estate in the north-east of the current suburb, which had been previously offered at auction in September 1920. All 24 allotments were sold. In 1924, the Realty Development Company were selling suburban blocks (ranging from 16 to 20 perches) in the Tramway Extension Estate. This estate was bounded by Stafford Road to the north and Hill Street (now Highland Street) to the south and included Burnaby Street (now Burnaby Terrace), Turner Road (now Alva Terrace) and Victoria Terrace (and was part of the estate that was first offered in 1890 and again in 1922). In 1926 the Gordon Park Baptist Church started as a tent mission on property at Khartoum Street which was owned by the church. It was originally known as the Gordon Park Mission Church. The church rented a house, which became the home of the pastors on the corner of Groom and Thistle Streets until a manse was purchased and officially opened on 9 May 1953. The President of the Baptist Union of Queensland opened the Church hall in 1961. A new church at 106 Khartoum Street () was built which opened on 10 September 1977. The original pulpit from the old church along with a communion tray was donated to the Beenleigh Baptist Church. On Sunday 28 July 1929 the Archbishop James Duhig laid the foundation stone of a new Catholic church and school. He returned to bless and open the new church and school on Sunday 3 November 1929. The building was on two levels with the school on the lower level with a capacity of 200 students and the church on the upper level with a capacity of 250 people. The intention was that a new larger church would be built later and the school occupy both levels of the original building. St Carthage's Catholic Primary School opened on 8 July 1930; it was operated by the Sisters of Mercy. On 26 June 1966 the present brick church facing Beaconsfield Terrace was opened by Archbishop Patrick O’Donnell. The new buildings were designed by architects Corbett and Ryan and cost over $92,000, including furnishings. In November 1974, the Sisters of Mercy ceased to staff the school apart from one Sister for religious instruction. It was one of the first of the schools in the Brisbane Archdiocese to transition to lay control under headmaster Edward Benito Pender. However, the school was closed by the Archdiocese in 1976 as it was felt that the enrolment of 86 students was insufficient to make the school financially viable. On Saturday 19 October 1929 a site in Beaconsfield Terrace (near the junction with Cowper Street, approx ) was dedicated for a future Methodist church. On Saturday 20 September 1930 there was a stump capping ceremony as construction commenced on the church hall building. The hall was officially opened on Saturday 1 November 1930. In November 1938, the Brisbane City Council announced that the tram to Gordon Park would be extended from Lutwyche Road via Bradshaw Street, crossing Kedron Brook into Thistle Street. Trams ran to Gordon Park connecting it with Brisbane until they were progressively withdrawn from use, finally ceasing all operations on 13 April 1969. St John's Anglican Church on the corner of Khartoum Street and Cowper Street (approx ) was dedicated on 2 August 1959 by Archbishop Reginald Halse. Its closure on 15 March 1987 was approved by Assistant Bishop George Browning. On 11 August 1975 Gordon Park ceased to be a separate suburb. However residents lobbied against this decision and on 18 December 1992, Gordon Park was reinstated as a suburb. In the , Gordon Park had a population of 4,231 people.  Heritage listings  Gordon Park has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 29 Aberdeen Terrace (): former St Carthage's Catholic School building * 29 Jack Street (): Alexander Barron's house Education There are no schools in Gordon Park. The nearest primary schools are in Stafford, Wooloowin and Kedron. The nearest secondary school is Kedron State High School.  Amenities  St Carthage's Catholic Church is at 115 Beaconsfield Terrace (). Demographics In the , Gordon Park recorded a population of 4,231 people, 51.0% female and 49.0% male. The median age of the Gordon Park population was 35 years of age, 3 years below the Australian median. 73.9% of people living in Gordon Park were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 66.7%; the next most common countries of birth were New Zealand 2.9%, England 2.5%, India 2.1%, Italy 1.0%, and China 0.8%. 82.8% of people spoke only English at home; the next most popular languages were 1.7% Italian, 1.0% Spanish, 1.0% Mandarin, 0.9% Hindi, and 0.7% Punjabi. Notable residents Gordon Park resident, Tom Nash, was born in Essex, England in 1909. He emigrated to Australia at the age of 17 aboard the S.S. Vedic, a ship chartered by the Salvation Army to bring 700 young emigrants to Australia. He was awarded the Order of Australia in 1985 in recognition of his service to the local community. Prior to receiving the award he had received a certificate of merit for services to the incapacitated Servicemen's Association, a RSL certificate of merit, honorary life membership of the RSL and the Paul Harris Fellowship medal from Rotary International. Tom Nash had also been a Brisbane City Council councillor.

William Shipley (baptised: 2 June 1715 – 28 December 1803) was an English drawing master, social reformer and inventor who, in 1754, founded an arts society in London that became The Royal Society of Arts, or Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures & Commerce (RSA). Life Early years, training and career Shipley was born in Maidstone, Kent, the son of Jonathan Shipley (d. 1749, originally of Walbrook, London) and Martha (née Davies), and baptised on 2 June 1715. He had a brother Jonathan Shipley, who became the Bishop of St Asaph,Thomas Seccombe. \\"Dictionary of National Biography\\", v52 (1897) pp. 112–113. and whose son William Davies Shipley became Dean of St Asaph. William grew up in the City of London. His father died when he was just three years old, and William was sent to live with his maternal grandfather. At the age of 21, he inherited £500 and used that money to practice as a painter and drawing master in Northampton. At this point, he also joined the Northampton Philosophical Society, where he began his philanthropic life by raising funds to buy fuel for the poor. Around 1750, Shipley moved to London and set up a drawing-school near Fountain Court in The Strand (at the east corner of Beaufort Buildings), which was known first as \\"Shipley's Academy\\" and later as \\"Ackermann's Repository of Arts\\". The school proved highly successful, and among Shipley's pupils were Richard Cosway, William Pars, and Francis Wheatley. Although Shipley had many students who went on to become famous artists, he himself was not remembered for his artwork. The Society of Arts The Society of Arts premises at 18 John Street, Adelphi, London (18c. engraving). The Society of Arts distributing its awards (engraving – artist unknown). From Shipley's school, came the idea for a \\"Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce\\" He published his proposals for the society in 1753, which he hoped would make Great Britain a center for intellectual advancements in the areas of arts and sciences. The resulting organisation first met at Rawthmell's coffee house on the north side of Henrietta Street, in Covent Garden on 22 March 1754.RSA – administrative and biographical history (Aim25 archives – 8 September 2010). Founding members included Viscount Folkestone, Lord Romney (1712–1794), Isaac Maddox, Stephen Hales, and Thomas Baker, the naturalist. A \\"plan\\" of Shipley's devising was published in 1755 in folio, where the aims of the society were stated, \\"to promote the arts, manufactures, and commerce of this kingdom by giving honorary or pecuniary rewards, as may be best adapted to the case, for the communication to the society, and through the society to the public, of all such useful inventions, discoveries, and improvements as tend to that purpose\\". Historian Pierre-Nicolas Chantreau (1741–1808) was said to marvel \\"that such an institution was founded, not by those who held reins of government, but by William Shipley, \\"cultivateur modeste\\" The society would award premiums for different discoveries and inventions: \\"There appeared in the daily and evening papers a notice announcing premiums or awards\\" They offered premiums for the discovery of cobalt and the raising and curing of madder, for example. These were not just frivolous concerns but matters of Britain's most important industry, namely, textiles. According to Colley, \\"Cobalt dyes a brilliant blue and the madder was the principal source of all red dies until the 19th century\\". Quite simply, the society wanted to enable Britain's most important industry, its textile manufacturers, to be able to dye their cloth at home rather than send it abroad.\\" Colley goes on to say that the Society was also busy trying to solve the problem of finding enough native timber for the building of ships. This was a matter of Britain's national defence. Without timber, the Royal Navy could not build ships.The Society carried out this purpose by establishing prizes for the growing of trees, such as Oaks, chestnuts, Elms and Firs.Colley, Linda Britons. \\"Forging a Nation, 1707–1837 (New Haven, Yale University Press, 1992). They once offered a premium to anyone able to develop a scheme to transport breadfruit from the East to the West Indies. Shipley raised the money for the endeavour through subscriptions. He also encouraged people to make new and more accurate maps by awarding special prizes to encourage exploration. Shipley's contributions to both England's economy and England's security through the Society were substantial. The inventor, and later years Shipley was elected a \\"perpetual member\\" of the society in February 1755, and was presented with a gold medal by the society in 1758. But it is probable that he became less interested in the society as its sphere gradually became more technical and industrial; At any rate, he resigned his post as registrar in 1760. On 23 November 1767, William Shipley married Elizabeth Miller, and seems to have retired to Maidstone about 1768. The couple's first child was born in 1769 but died after two months. In 1771, The second child, Elizabeth was born. Shipley, under the auspices of Lord Romney, founded a local institution, \\"The Kentish Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge\\", along the lines of the Society of Arts. In 1783 the society was instrumental in improving the sanitation of Maidstone gaol, and so preventing the \\"gaol fever\\", which had ravaged the prison population of the country. Shipley was an inventor in his own right. He came up with ideas on how to provide inexpensive fuel for the poor, a floating light to save those lost in the sea (for which he received an award), a way to establish new species of fish in ponds around England, and perhaps strangest of all, a method of lining your shoes with tinfoil to keep them dry. Shipley died in Maidstone, aged 89, on 28 December 1803. A monument was erected to his memory in the north-west corner of churchyard of All Saints Church, Maidstone.Churchyard of All Saint's, Maidstone, Flickr. Richard Cosway painted an oil portrait of Shipley, and there is also a portrait, drawn and engraved by William Hincks, in the National Portrait Gallery. There is a mezzotint by John Faber Junior of a painting by Shipley of a man blowing a lighted torch. Legacy Shipley historical significance was summed up by David Allen in his biography: \\"Shipley's life included in its span the surge of English Commercial self-confidence which Defoe celebrated and which was to be feared by Napoleon, the spectacular first stage of the industrial Revolution from the flying shuttle to steam-powered cotton mills, the flowering of English genius in the arts from Hogarth to Turner, and the growth of English philanthropic endeavor from the first county hospitals to Hannah More's \\"Age if Benevolence.\\" In the shaping of these momentous developments Shipley which was both distinctive and significant.Allan, D.G.C. William Shipley: Founder of the Royal Society of Arts; A Biography with Documents (London: Hutchinson, 1968). Many credit Shipley with helping to establish the role of private organisations to serve the public; the Crown of England was so preoccupied with war and money dealings, it had little resources to further enhance culture at the time. \\"Merely by existing,the society challenged the way that the British state was organised.

They are the highest-selling Canadian thrash metal group in history, having sold more than three million albums worldwide, although most of their sales have been generated outside the band's home country. Along with Sacrifice, Voivod and Razor, Annihilator is credited as one of the \\"big four\\" of Canadian thrash metal. They are also considered to be one of the second wave of thrash metal bands from the late 1980s and early 1990s, along with Sepultura, Sacred Reich, Flotsam and Jetsam and Dark Angel as well as Bay Area thrash metal acts Testament, Forbidden, Death Angel and Vio-lence. Since its inception, Annihilator has released seventeen studio albums and has undergone many line-up changes. Waters is the only remaining original member left in the band, and usually assembles touring or session musicians to perform with him. Annihilator's first two studio albums—Alice in Hell (1989) and Never, Neverland (1990)—are considered to be influential Canadian heavy metal records. Many of their later albums—including their third, and only major-label, album Set the World on Fire (1993)—also received high praise from critics, and enjoyed some success in Europe and Japan. Their recent studio album, Ballistic, Sadistic, was released on January 24, 2020. History Early career (1984–1988) Singer and guitarist Jeff Waters, who formed Annihilator in 1984, at Rockharz Open Air 2016 in Germany. Annihilator was formed in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada by Jeff Waters and John Bates in 1984. Waters later wrote on his Facebook page that he named the band after the tank that Eddie Murphy's character rode on in the 1984 film Best Defense. Waters and singer Bates wrote and recorded the song Annihilator (not to be confused with the song of the same name released on the 1994 album, King of the Kill). This original version of \\"Annihilator\\" was released on the special edition of the 2005 album Schizo Deluxe. Waters and Bates then recruited drummer Paul Malek and bassist Dave Scott. This lineup lasted a year, producing a demo titled \\"Welcome To Your Death\\" during their time together. The demo received worldwide recognition and became highly sought after. After John Bates and Dave Scott left the band before its release, citing \\"artistic differences\\" and \\"personality conflicts\\", Jeff Waters and drummer Paul Malek recorded another successful demo titled Phantasmagoria in 1986. This was said to be the third most-traded metal cassette tape in the 1980s, behind Metallica and Megadeth's demo tapes. Some songs written at this time, by Jeff Waters and John Bates, ended up on Annihilator's first two official studio albums (Alice In Hell and Never, Neverland). A third demo was recorded by Waters and Malek in 1987 and was sent only to labels. It included more songs that would end up on the first two Annihilator studio albums. Waters relocated to Vancouver in 1987, where he assembled an entire line-up, including drummer Ray Hartmann and former D.O.A. bassist Randy Rampage on vocals. In 1988 and 1989, Waters was in and out of a recording studio recording guitar and bass tracks and producing what would become the band's debut album. Once the album was finished, he hired bassist Wayne Darley and guitarist Anthony Greenham. Rise to fame (1989–1993) Annihilator gained more recognition in the metal community with the release of their debut album, Alice in Hell, in 1989. They embarked on their first world tour, opening up for Onslaught in Europe on their In Search of Sanity tour, and along with Wrathchild America, they supported Testament in the United States and Canada on the latter's Practice What You Preach tour, after which singer Randy Rampage quit the band to retain his seniority at a job on the shipping docks in North Vancouver. Without a singer, Jeff Waters found ex-Omen singer Coburn Pharr and the band released their second album, Never, Neverland, in 1990. The album's sales surpassed Alice in Hell, becoming the band's only album to chart in the UK at No. 48. After opening up for Judas Priest, and then little-known Pantera and headlining tours around the world, Hartmann and Pharr left the band and were replaced by Mike Mangini (though the band would find a more permanent replacement in Randy Black) and Aaron Randall, respectively. The band was signed to Sony USA by this point. The band's third studio album, Set the World on Fire, distributed by Epic Records, was released in 1993 and was successful in Europe and Asia, but did poorly in the United States. Bassist Wayne Darley had to leave the band in August 1993 as he was unable to enter Japan, where the band was touring in support of the album. Annihilator was among the many metal bands dropped by Roadrunner Records (and most other labels) that year. Brief hiatus and later years (1994–1998) Annihilator temporarily dissolved, but Jeff Waters kept the band name going when he, along with drummer Randy Black, recorded and released King of the Kill in 1994. This album was more of a solo album for Waters, as it featured himself performing all instruments and writing most of the album's material apart from playing the drum tracks, which were recorded by Randy Black. Bassist Cam Dixon later joined the band followed by Lou Bujdoso from Meatwagon who went on to tour and perform during the King of the Kill and Refresh the Demon tours. Jeff Waters continued performing lead vocals until 1997. The band released Refresh the Demon, which was, for the most part, a return to the speed and technicality of the band's earlier days, in 1996 and Remains, a more industrial metal-oriented album which turned out to be the biggest flop of the band's career, in 1997. By the time Remains was being recorded, Waters was the sole remaining band member. The album featured an electric drum machine (programmed by Jeff Waters) and there was no tour in support of it. At the time of its recording, Waters was going through a rough divorce and a custody battle for his children which helped lead to Annihilator's hiatus. Reunion with Randy Rampage and Joe Comeau era (1999–2002) Inspired after seeing Slayer perform in Vancouver in the summer of 1998, Waters decided to reunite the Alice in Hell line-up to record another album. All members apart from Wayne Darley, who had health problems, agreed to reunite. Bassist Russ Bergquist joined the band in Darley's place. This lineup released Criteria for a Black Widow and toured successfully. However, Rampage was fired following the tour for his erratic and often drunken behaviour. Then-Overkill guitarist and former Liege Lord frontman Joe Comeau requested to replace him during the tour, while Curran Murphy replaced Davis on guitar and Randy Black rejoined on drums. During the early 2000s, Annihilator released the albums Carnival Diablos (2001) and Waking the Fury (2002), both very critically successful. After considerable success, the band's lineup once again dissolved. The Dave Padden era (2003–2013) Following years of line-up changes, Jeff Waters decided to work with a touring-only lineup so he recruited Dave Padden as a permanent vocalist/rhythm guitarist, while Waters recruited touring bassists and drummers. Annihilator's first two albums in this three-man band format as Waters played both bass and guitar, with Padden on vocals and a hired drummer were All for You (2004) and Schizo Deluxe (2005). Mike Mangini rejoined for the former album in 2004 and Tony Chappelle was hired for the latter's recording in 2005. In 2007, Annihilator released their twelfth album Metal. It features several guest performers, such as Corey Beaulieu (Trivium), Willie Adler (Lamb of God) and Jeff Loomis (Nevermore). The band's self-titled thirteenth album was released in 2010, coming to be in a more modern thrash metal-styled sound. Annihilator returned to Canada for two live shows, making it the first time since 1993 that the band had played live in North America. On July 10, 2011, Annihilator headlined the Quebec City Imperial Theatre to a sold-out crowd. They played the main stage (along with KISS and Motörhead) on July 24, 2011 at Montreal's Heavy MTL Festival. Annihilator released their fourteenth studio album entitled Feast on 23 August 2013. Departure of Dave Padden and Suicide Society (2014–2016) In the summer of 2014, Oscar Rangel replaced Al Campuzano, their bassist since 2010. Jeff Waters said on his Facebook that he had actually contacted Wayne Darley, the band's bassist from the classic early 1990s lineup, about having him rejoin, although once again he declined, in Jeff's words \\"Wayne wanted to do it but couldn't ... personal reasons.\\" The band has continued their touring cycle since then. Dave Padden left the band sometime in December 2014 via a phone call to Jeff Waters, informing him of his desire to step away from the constant touring in order to spend more time with his family. Waters unsuccessfully attempted to persuade Padden to remain in the band, offering him a pay rise. He later admitted in a German radio interview to being emotionally shaken by the departure. After a number of weeks searching for a replacement vocalist, Waters decided that he would handle vocals himself once again, in addition to doing everything but play drums in the studio. Padden's departure was not made public until six months later, in June 2015, when Waters made an announcement on Annihilator's Facebook page, but attaching a YouTube link directly below of audio snippets from various songs on the band's then-upcoming album, Suicide Society. Never, Neverland singer, Coburn Pharr surprised audiences when he returned for a short time on 70000 Tons of Metal concert in January 2015. Pharr performed the songs Reduced to Ash, The Fun Palace, I Am In Command, Road to Ruin and Stonewall. By April 2015, Annihilator had begun work on their fifteenth studio album. Waters stated that the album's musical direction would be \\"something quite different.\\" The album, titled Suicide Society, was released on September 18, 2015. Drummer Mike Harshaw announced via his Facebook page in May 2016 that he had parted ways with Annihilator amicably after four years in order to spend more time with his family as well as to pursue other musical interests as he continued work with his own band, Prismind. Fabio Alessandrini joined Annihilator shortly thereafter. In September 2016, Annihilator played Calgary Metalfest alongside fellow Canadian speed/thrash metal pioneers Exciter, Razor, Sacrifice and a local band Gatekrashör. In late November 2016, the band announced a compilation album, entitled Triple Threat, which was released through UDR Records on January 27, 2017. The album consists of three discs, including one containing Annihilator's Jeff Waters, Aaron Homma, and Rich Gray (formerly Hinks) along with other artists playing an acoustic set of the band's most well-known ballads and acoustic songs, all done in single takes. The second and third discs were released as Blu-ray DVDs, one containing Annihilator's full set at Bang Your Head Festival in Germany, and the other containing a documentary profiling the band's extensive career. For the Demented and Ballistic, Sadistic (2017–present) By the end of 2016, Annihilator had begun working on their sixteenth studio album. Waters stated, \\"On the next one, the changes I'm gonna make… I only said two things. I've got all these people telling me, 'You've gotta go back to this album,' or that album, or that album, or that album. 'You've gotta do this,' 'You've gotta do that.' So what I do is I block it out. But I've decided that I'm going to not worry about catchy, commercial choruses — 'commercial,' as in you remember it, where you intentionally make that chorus the most important part of the song and you want people to remember that one every time. That kind of is the opposite of what I used to do in the earlier days. In the earlier days, I would go, 'I don't care about the chorus being the main part; I want the whole song to be cool.' So therefore the choruses were not as commercial or catchy. And they remained heavy back then; the choruses would end up being heavy. Whereas on my Suicide Society record I just did, you could have a heavy song, but then you hit the chorus and you go, 'Woah, that's pretty mainstream stuff in the choruses.' And the other thing was, since I'm such a fan of so many bands, I let myself go a little bit on the last album with being too blatantly obvious with my influences and my musical loves as a fan. So you really heard a song that had a lot of the Master of Puppets era of music from Metallica, and you really heard a Megadeth-y song on there, and you really heard in my vocals some Hetfield and Mustaine-isms. And I think that was great, as a fan, to get it out, but I think I need to do more of my own thing on the next record.\\" In February 2017, Jeff Waters said that the sixteenth Annihilator studio album was being co-produced and co-engineered by bassist Rich Gray, making it the \\"first time I've actually had somebody else in the studio since 1990 (Never, Neverland) working with me on stuff.\\" On September 12, 2017, it was announced that the album, now titled For the Demented, would be released on November 3; more details on the album, including track listing and artwork, and the music video for \\"Twisted Lobotomy\\" were released on the same day. In support of For the Demented, Annihilator (along with Death Angel) opened for Testament on the European Brotherhood of the Snake tour, which took place in November and December 2017. The band toured Europe twice in 2018; first with Testament and Vader in March and April, and toured there again from October to December. On August 14, 2018, former Annihilator vocalist Randy Rampage (who sang on the albums Alice in Hell and Criteria for a Black Widow) died of an apparent heart attack, at the age of 58. In September 2018, Waters reported that Annihilator would release their seventeenth studio album in 2019. He later confirmed that it would be released in January 2020. On October 10, 2019, Annihilator released \\"I Am Warfare\\" as the lead single of the album, now titled Ballistic, Sadistic, which was released on January 24, 2020.

Named in honor of the crew who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, it increased NASA's supercomputing capacity ten-fold for the agency's science, aeronautics and exploration programs. Missions run on Columbia include high- fidelity simulations of the Space Shuttle vehicle and launch systems, hurricane track prediction, global ocean circulation, and the physics of supernova detonations. History Columbia debuted as the second most powerful supercomputer on the TOP500 list in November 2004 at a LINPACK rating of 51.87 teraflops, or 51.87 trillion floating point calculations per second. By June 2007 it had dropped to 13th. It was originally composed of 20 interconnected SGI Altix 3700 512-processor multi-rack systems running SUSE Linux Enterprise, using Intel Itanium 2 Montecito and Montvale processors. In 2006, NASA and SGI added four new Altix 4700 nodes containing 256 dual-core processors, which decreased the physical footprint and the power cost of the supercomputer. The nodes were connected with InfiniBand single and double data rate (SDR and DDR) cabling with transfer speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second. The SGI Altix platform was selected due to a positive experience with Kalpana, a single-node Altix 512-CPU system built and operated by NASA and SGI and named after Columbia astronaut Kalpana Chawla, the first Indian-born woman to fly in space. Kalpana was later integrated into the Columbia supercomputer system as the first node of twenty. At its peak, Columbia had a total of 10,240 processors and 20 terabytes of memory, 440 terabytes of online storage, and 10 petabytes of archival tape storage. The Project Columbia team, composed mostly of computer scientists and engineers from NAS, SGI, and Intel, were awarded the Government Computer News (GCN) Agency Award for Innovation in 2005 for deploying Columbia's original 10,240 processors in an unprecedented 120 days. It was slowly phased out as its successors at NAS, the petascale Pleiades supercomputer and the Endeavour shared-memory system, expanded to meet with NASA's growing high-end computing needs. At the time of its decommissioning in March 2013, Columbia was made up of four nodes over 40 SGI Altix 4700 racks, containing Intel Itanium 2 Montecito and Montvale processors to make up a total of 4,608 cores with a theoretical peak of 30 teraflops and total memory of 9 terabytes.

He is the boy of the duo. History When Willy Vandersteen created his first adventure story with the characters Wiske, Tante Sidonia and Professor Barabas, \\"Rikki en Wiske in Chocowakije\\" (\\"Rikki and Wiske in Chocowakije\\") (1945)Vandersteen, Willy, \\"Rikki en Wiske in Chocowakije\\", Standaard Uitgeverij, 1945. he already gave the little girl Wiske a boy companion called Suske. However, in this early incarnation the boy was her older and stronger brother. Also, Vandersteen's publisher had changed the character's name into \\"Rikki\\" without his knowledge, let alone with his approval. This turned out to be for the better, since Vandersteen felt that the character was way too old to be a good companion to the much younger Wiske. He also resembled Tintin too much. Thus, at the start of the next story, \\"Op Het Eiland Amoras\\" (\\"On The Isle of Amoras\\") (1945) Vandersteen sent Rikki off to get a ration stamp for shoes and effectively wrote him out of the series. In the course of the story Wiske, Sidonia and Barabas travel to the isle of Amoras where Wiske meets a local orphan named Suske. He explains to her that he is the last living relative of Sus Antigoon, his great-great-great-grandfather. Wiske joins him in the Amorasians' battle against their oppressors. At the end of the story Suske is adopted by aunt Sidonia and travels back to Belgium.Vandersteen, Willy, \\"Het Eiland Amoras\\", Standaard Uitgeverij, 1947. Suske was named after Vandersteen's father, Sus Vandersteen.Van Hooydonck, Peter, \\"50 Jaar Suske en Wiske\\", Standaard Uitgeverij, 1995. The diminutive \\"-ke\\" in Flemish dialect means \\"little\\", thus \\"Suske\\" would translate back to \\"Little Sus\\". In some stories his full name, François, is mentioned, but not often. Character Suske is somewhat of a flat character. He is brave, honest, helpful, smart, polite, heroic, strong and has no real flaws in the way that Wiske or Lambik have. This also explains why he is the least popular character in the franchise. In \\"Het Eiland Amoras\\" he often went berserk whenever someone said the battle cry \\"Seefhoek vooruit!\\" (the \\"Seefhoek\\" was the neighborhood in Antwerp where Vandersteen grew up. In reprints this was changed to \\"Antigoon vooruit!\\"). This element was dropped in later stories. Despite being one of the main protagonists of the series Suske is rarely the focus of the stories. In \\"De Stalen Bloempot\\" (\\"The Steel Flowerpot\\") (1950) Suske is brought back to his native Amoras to become king. At the end of the story he abdicates because he doesn't want to leave his friends behind. In \\"Het Ros Bazhaar\\" (\\"The Horse Bazhaar\\") (1974) Suske runs away from home, because he feels the others don't understand him. He does this again in \\"De Curieuze Neuzen\\" (\\"The Curious Noses\\") (2007), but this time because he feels unwanted seeing he is an orphan. In \\"De Goalgetter\\" (1990) Suske becomes an association football champion and his success goes to his head. In \\"Het Gebroken Dorp\\" (2014) Suske becomes count of Marchimont, after saving the city from a local curse. Relation with Wiske Suske and Wiske are best friends, despite quarreling once in a while. One of the recurring storylines is Wiske's jealousy whenever Suske receives attention from other young, attractive females. In spin- offs Suske plays the central role in the spin-off series Amoras. The first volume is named after him. He is also the central character in the junior version Klein Suske en Wiske (\\"Little Suske and Wiske\\"). In popular culture Both he and Wiske have their own statue in the Antwerp Zoo in Antwerp.

She is the girl of the duo. Together with Lambik she is one of the most popular characters in the franchise. History Wiske made her debut in the very first Suske and Wiske story \\"Rikki en Wiske in Chocowakije\\" (1945) (\\"Rikki and Wiske in Chocowakije\\").Vandersteen, Willy, \\"Rikki en Wiske in Chocowakije\\", Standaard Uitgeverij, 1945. Her companion in this story is her older and stronger brother Rikki, who was written out of the series at the start of the next story \\"Het Eiland Amoras\\" (1945-1946) (\\"The Isle of Amoras\\"). When Wiske travelled to the isle of Amoras along with Tante Sidonia and Professor Barabas she met Suske there, who took Rikki's place as her male companion.Vandersteen, Willy, \\"Het Eiland Amoras\\", Standaard Uitgeverij, 1947. Wiske is adopted by her aunt, Tante Sidonia. It is never directly implied, but just like Suske she is likely an orphan, as her parents are never seen around. Vandersteen named Wiske after the Flemish opera singer Wiske Ghijs.Van Hooydonck, Peter, \\"50 Jaar Suske en Wiske\\", Standaard Uitgeverij, 1995. Her real name is \\"Louisa\\", but this is hardly used in the series. The nickname \\"Wiske\\" is a Flemish diminutive form of \\"Louisa\\". Character Contrary to Suske Wiske is more flawed as a person. She is stubborn, prone to anger and jealousy, too curious for her own good and can be vain, disobedient, lazy and impulsive. However, she still has a heart of gold. Her impulsiveness and curiosity often bring her and others in trouble. This also explains why more stories center around her than the good-natured Suske. Just like Lambik Wiske is one of the most popular characters in the franchise because readers can relate to her human personality flaws more. Relation with Suske Suske and Wiske are best friends, despite quarreling once in a while. One of the recurring storylines is Wiske's jealousy whenever Suske receives attention from other young, attractive females. Schanulleke Wiske has a little doll, Schanulleke, whom she carries along with her wherever she goes. She adores her doll so much that she is heartbroken whenever it is lost or someone threatens to destroy it. Wiske's story-concluding wink Wiske traditionally concludes every story by winking at the audience, which has become a trademark of the franchise.

It aired on ITV between 2001 and 2004. The show was first commissioned in 2001 and was co-produced by a company owned by Steve Coogan. Despite the first series winning a BAFTA for Best Comedy, the second series was cancelled due to poor viewing figures. Lee Mack states in his autobiography Mack The Life that the final two episodes have never been broadcast. A spinoff of the same title was produced in the United States. Similarly to the UK version, the final two episodes were never broadcast. The show started at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1999, and starred Mack, Catherine Tate and Dan Antopolski. Mack later expressed regret at not including them in the TV show, stating: \\"I'm not a great believer in regret, but looking back over the last eighteen years of me doing this job, not keeping our sketch show Bits together and jumping at the first offer to put a version of it on telly is probably the biggest mistake I've made.\\"  Cast  The original line-up of the cast was Lee Mack, Jim Tavare, Tim Vine, Karen Taylor and Ronni Ancona. For the second series, Kitty Flanagan replaced Ancona, who left to concentrate on BBC One's Alistair McGowan's Big Impression (which was shortened to simply Big Impression to reflect Ancona playing as many parts as McGowan himself). Again, sketches featured performers using their own names. With the exception of some child actors in certain sketches, there were no guest stars at any point during the programme.  Writers  All of the cast contributed to the writing of the show; however, Lee Mack is credited as the lead writer. Other comedic writers/actors, such as Jimmy Carr, Ricky Gervais, Matthew Hardy, Stephen Colledge and Daniel Maier were also responsible for the show's humour, though as mentioned earlier, were not featured in the show.  DVD  A DVD of the first season was released by Visual Entertainment in Australia on 12 September 2005. It is a region-free DVD and the only extra on the disc is a short photo gallery. All 8 episodes on the single-disc release are combined into a 3-hour feature. The opening and closing credits have been removed for all episodes, and a number of sketches have been edited out to fit the series onto a single disc.  Notable sketches  Episodes feature short fast-paced sketches and traditionally ended with a sketch featuring the entire cast, and many of these have become famous among fans of the show. Some examples include: * The Jockey Sketch - in which Mack plays a winning Irish jockey who speaks too fast for Ancona (a reporter) to understand. A YouTube link to the sketch is included in Mack's autobiography and he cites the sketch as one of his favourites to have written and performed. * The Surfer Sketch - in which Mack is instructing the rest of the cast in surf safety (in a very broad Australian accent), a conversation which moves into a discussion of circus theatre. The sketch also features Mack's question of \\"Whaddaya do if a shark attacks ya?\\", to which Tavare holds up an arm with no hand and responds, \\"I know what not to do, ey?\\" * California Dreamin' - in which Ancona is attempting to record a cover of the Mamas & the Papas' song of the same name, featuring the rest of the cast on backing vocals. The backing vocalists consistently sing the wrong lyrics (or with the wrong emphasis on the words), which eventually results in Ancona storming from the room. As a result of this sketch, many fans of the show deliberately sing along with the original song incorrectly. This sketch was repeated on the American versions of the show with Kelsey Grammer. * The Phobias Sketch - All five actors are in a phobias workshop, phobias include a fear of the word \\"Aagh!\\", a fear of apologies, a fear of repetition, and awkward silences. Vine enters, with a problem where he barks at other people's phobias. The different phobias cause long chains of screaming (Such as apologies, Aagh, Repetition, Barking). For example: The one with the phobia of awkward silence will scream, the man next to her has a phobia of the word \\"Aagh!\\" so he screams, since two \\"Aaghs!\\" has been screamed (thus a repetition), so the one with the phobia of repetition screams, the one with the problem of barking at other peoples phobia barks next to the ear of the person with the phobia of apologies, scaring him and then he says sorry which makes him scream, and the chain continues. * The Imaginary Friend Sketch - Ronni, as a therapist, counsels three of the other cast members, each of whom have an imaginary friend: one claims that he was looking for Alcoholic's Anonymous for his friend, one claims to have a boyfriend with the same name as her (presumably real) ex- boyfriend, and one who claims to be the imaginary friend of someone else. By the end of the sketch, it is revealed that the entire room which Ronni believes to be filled with her \\"patients\\" is actually empty – she is the one with the hallucinations of imaginary friends. * The English Course Sketch - in which the cast is taking an English course and each one has a particular problem with an aspect of the language, which comes out in their cafeteria conversation. Tavare has a problem with his grammar (\\"I sometimes have trouble with grammar, isn't it?\\"), Mack can't spell (\\"I can't spill to save me loaf, have to rely on the spillchock on me compluter\\"), Vine can't put emphasis on words correctly (\\"I have problems with my emPHARsis at different parts of my senTENces\\") - which causes him problems as a \\"speech theRAHpist\\", Taylor places exclamation marks randomly at the end of sentences and shouts the final word (\\"Sorry, I sometimes put an exclamation mark at the end by MISTAKE!\\") and Ancona has a very small vocabulary (\\"It's alright for you lot, I've got a very small vocabulary\\"). *The Therapist - Karen plays a therapist in three sketches who after the victim tells her what happens she replies saying, \\"Ooooooooh I'm crying, my mum left me and I'm stuck on the moon boooo-hoooooooo\\" in which she makes fun of them. This sketch made a reappearance as a recurring gag in Touch Me, I'm Karen Taylor. * The Scrabble Sketch - This sketch revolves around the often tried method of cheating in Scrabble by claiming to the other player(s) that your seemingly useless collection of letters forms a real word and they are simply unaware of its existence. Mack and Vine are playing Scrabble and Mack begins a conversation by announcing that he went on a date the previous night. When asked by Vine how the date went, Mack replies \\"Nice girl, bit quazoosl\\". He then goes on to explain \\"you know, quazoosl - when someone is so good looking they become intimidating\\". He then gives an example stating that Liz Hurley would qualify as quazoosl. When the conversation finishes Mack asks whose turn it is and when Vine tells him it is his, he knowingly replies \\"Is it really?\\" and unsurprisingly all his letters spell \\"quazoosl\\". Later in the same show, Mack asks Vine if he fancies a glass of \\"saxisquith\\", to which Vine replies \\"Don't even think about it...\\" * The Sign Language Sketch - Ronni is presenting a feature about the opening of a new building, standing in front of the camera with Lee to her right performing sign language. Lee's unusual and over-expressive actions infuriate Ronni and she regularly has to stop her speech to question what he is doing. Actions include flapping his arms like a chicken to indicate 50% (100% would be flapping his legs as well, and 25% is just a pecking motion) and hitting Ronni in the face with his arm as she says \\"far left of centre\\" in her speech. Ronni finally stumps him by using the words \\"25% off half a chicken.\\" * The Gangster Sketch - Mack works in a warehouse when Vine rushes in and holds him at gunpoint, while Tavaré is asking for information about a \\"broad\\" Mack is seeing but the way they talk; \\"now I don't bother to take no bullshit so you're gonna give it to me straight, you've been hanging with some broad who's been shootin' her mouth, and me and my homie wan's a name and if you so much as think about jivin' with my butt, you're gonna wind up a sorry mother with a wasted ass\\"; makes it difficult for Mack to understand what they are saying therefore he can't answer their questions properly, eventually ending with them pulling guns on him saying \\"you better think long and hard about what you say next or else you ass is going down so what do ya say?\\" with Mack just responding with \\"Cherish the love we have....\\" * Card Salesman Sketch - Mack tries to sell stupidly specific cards to a shopkeeper, but she refuses. Mack ends up sending one of his cards to her. * The Urinal Sketch, featuring the three male cast members, is the most notable sketch on online video websites. However, it was uploaded by online users instead of ITV.  International versions   United States  An American version of the show, produced by Kelsey Grammer, aired in early 2005 on Fox. The main cast consisted of Malcolm Barrett, Kaitlin Olson, Mary Lynn Rajskub, and Paul F. Tompkins, as well as Lee Mack from the British version of the show. Grammer only appeared in short opening and closing segments in each episode. Many of the sketches from the British version were recreated, such as the California Dreamin', English Course and the Sign Language sketch. A notable sketch from this version had Grammer waking up from a nightmare, which he describes as: \\"I dreamt that Frasier was over, and I was on this Sketch Show!\\" The sketch is a spoof of the Newhart series finale. The series was filmed in London, England at Teddington Studios, with a British audience. Only six episodes of the show were made, and it was cancelled after only four of them had been shown, but all six were aired. It was replaced by American Dad! on 6 February 2005.  Canada  A Quebec version ran between 2004 and 2006 on the channel TVA. Most sketches in this version are translations or adaptations of British and Australian sketches with little original material. The main cast consisted of Emmanuel Bilodeau, Réal Bossé, Édith Cochrane, Catherine De Sève and Sylvain Marcel.  Germany  A German version called Die Sketch Show has been on the air since 2003. It was produced by Brainpool for the TV channel ProSieben. Mack states in his autobiography that the show also utilised sketches that were written by the UK team but never recorded.  Greece  A sketch show called Skertsakia (, a play on Sketch and Scherzo) was broadcast during the 2006-2007 season, incorporated scripts from both seasons of the Sketch Show along with sketches from the Spanish comedy show Splunge! It was wildly popular with young demographics and produced 30 episodes and a Christmas special. It was produced by TFG Lt. for ANT1.  Israel  An Israeli version called Ktsarim (, literally shorts) aired from 2004 to 2009. One of the episodes featured a sketch heavily inspired by the California Dreamin' sketch, with the song \\"HaTishma Koli\\".  Indonesia  An Indonesian version called Sketsa is also currently on the air. Trans TV is airing the sketch comedy show. Most sketches in this version are translations or adaptations of British sketches with little original material. The humour style remains faithful to the original.

It is the only member of the ciliate phylum known to be pathogenic to humans. Morphology Balantidium coli as seen in a wet mount of a stool specimen. The organism is surrounded by cilia. Balantidium coli has two developmental stages, a trophozoite stage and a cyst stage. In trophozoites, the two nuclei are visible. The macronucleus is long and sausage-shaped, and the spherical micronucleus is nested next to it, often hidden by the macronucleus. The opening, known as the peristome, at the pointed anterior end leads to the cytostome, or the mouth. Cysts are smaller than trophozoites and are round and have a tough, heavy cyst wall made of one or two layers. Usually only the macronucleus and sometimes cilia and contractile vacuoles are visible in the cyst. Living trophozoites and cysts are yellowish or greenish in color. Transmission Balantidium is the only ciliated protozoan known to infect humans. Balantidiasis is a zoonotic disease and is acquired by humans via the feco-oral route from the normal host, the domestic pig, where it is asymptomatic. Contaminated water is the most common mechanism of transmission. Role in disease Balantidium coli lives in the cecum and colon of humans, pigs, rats, and other mammals. It is not readily transmissible from one species of host to another because it requires a period of time to adjust to the symbiotic flora of the new host. Once it has adapted to a host species, the protozoan can become a serious pathogen, especially in humans. Trophozoites multiply and encyst due to the dehydration of feces. Infection occurs when the cysts are ingested, usually through contaminated food or water. B. coli infection in immunocompetent individuals is not unheard of, but it rarely causes serious disease of the gastrointestinal tract. It can thrive in the gastrointestinal tract as long as there is a balance between the protozoan and the host without causing dysenteric symptoms. Infection most likely occurs in people with malnutrition due to the low stomach acidity or people with compromised immune systems. In acute disease, explosive diarrhea may occur as often as every twenty minutes. Perforation of the colon may also occur in acute infections which can lead to life-threatening situations. Life cycle Balantidium coli life cycle Infection occurs when a host ingests a cyst, which usually happens during the consumption of contaminated water or food. Once the cyst is ingested, it passes through the host’s digestive system. While the cyst receives some protection from degradation by the acidic environment of the stomach through the use of its outer wall, it is likely to be destroyed at a pH lower than 5, allowing it to survive easier in the stomachs of malnourished individuals who have less stomach acid. Once the cyst reaches the small intestine, trophozoites are produced. The trophozoites then colonize the large intestine, where they live in the lumen and feed on the intestinal flora. Some trophozoites invade the wall of the colon using proteolytic enzymes and multiply, and some of them return to the lumen. In the lumen, trophozoites may disintegrate or undergo encystation. Encystation is triggered by dehydration of the intestinal contents and usually occurs in the distal large intestine, but may also occur outside of the host in feces. Now in its mature cyst form, cysts are released into the environment where they can go on to infect a new host. Epidemiology Balantidiasis in humans is common in the Philippines, but it can be found anywhere in the world, especially among those that are in close contact with swine. The disease is considered to be rare and occurs in less than 1% of the human population. The disease poses a problem mostly in developing countries, where water sources may be contaminated with swine or human feces.

Brothers, they were related to other conspirators, such as their cousin, Robert Catesby, and a half-brother, John Wintour, also joined them following the plot's failure. Thomas was an intelligent and educated man, fluent in several languages and trained as a lawyer, but chose instead to become a soldier, fighting for England in the Low Countries, France, and possibly in Central Europe. By 1600, however, he changed his mind and became a fervent Catholic. On several occasions he travelled to the continent and entreated Spain on behalf of England's oppressed Catholics, and suggested that with Spanish support a Catholic rebellion was likely. As momentum was building behind a peace settlement between the two countries, Thomas's pleas fell on deaf ears. Instead, in 1604 he decided to join with Catesby, who planned to restore England to Catholicism by killing the king and inciting a popular revolt in the Midlands, during which James's daughter, Princess Elizabeth, would be installed as titular queen. Thomas returned to the continent and again failed to elicit Spanish support, but instead met Guy Fawkes, with whom he returned to England. Robert, a devout Catholic who inherited Huddington Court near Worcester, joined the conspiracy the following year. The plot began to unravel following the delivery of an anonymous letter to William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, warning him to stay away from Parliament. Thomas and Catesby confronted Monteagle's brother-in-law, the recently recruited Francis Tresham, threatening to kill him, but Tresham managed to convince them of his innocence. At that stage Thomas reportedly asked Catesby to abandon the scheme, to no avail. When Fawkes was captured at about midnight on 4 November 1605, Thomas fled to Robert's house at Huddington. Catesby and most of the others spent two days travelling across the Midlands attempting to incite a rebellion, but with an ever-diminishing group of supporters they eventually settled at Holbeche House in Staffordshire, and waited for government forces to arrive. Thomas, by then reintegrated into the group, chose to remain with them, and in the ensuing firefight was shot in the shoulder, and captured. Robert, who had left before the battle, evaded capture until January 1606. Much of what is written about the plot is based on Thomas's confessions, given in the Tower of London in November 1605. The brothers were tried on 27 January 1606, and hanged, drawn and quartered several days later in London. Family and life before 1604 Robert (b. 1568) and Thomas Wintour (b. 1571–72) were sons of George Wintour of Huddington Court in Worcestershire, and his wife Jane (née Ingleby), daughter of Sir William Ingleby of Ripley Castle near Knaresborough. A sister, Dorothy, married another conspirator, John Grant. Two agnate half-siblings, John and Elizabeth, resulted from their father's marriage to Elizabeth Bourn, following Jane's death. Their paternal grandparents were Robert Wintour of Cavewell in Gloucestershire, and his wife Catherine, daughter of Sir George Throckmorton of Coughton in Warwickshire. As scions of the Throckmortons, they could therefore claim a kinship with plotters like Robert Catesby and Francis Tresham. Their maternal uncle Francis Ingleby, a Catholic priest, was hanged, drawn and quartered at York in 1586, a fact which in the opinion of historian and author Antonia Fraser, \\"could hardly have failed to leave a stark impression upon the Wintour family.\\" The Wintours took their name from the Welsh Gwyn Tour (White Tower). 'Wyntour' was sometimes used in signatures, but not 'Winter' (as the brothers are commonly named). Don Juan de Tassis and Juan Fernández de Velasco, 5th Duke of Frías, pictured seated at the Somerset House Conference in August 1604. Thomas petitioned both on the plight of English Catholics. A faithful Catholic, Robert was married to Gertrude Talbot, daughter of the recusant John Talbot of Grafton. He inherited the Tudor Huddington Court near Worcester, along with a significant fortune with which he was known to be generous. Under Robert, Huddington Court became a known refuge for priests. The proclamation for his capture, issued following the plot's failure, described him as \\"a man of mean stature, and rather low than otherwise; square made, somewhat stooping; near 40 years of age; his hair and beard brown; his beard not much, and his hair short.\\" The Jesuit John Gerard wrote that he was \\"esteemed in his life to be one of the wisest and most resolute and sufficient gentlemen in Worcestershire\\". Gerard's appraisal of Thomas was just as complimentary. He was apparently an intelligent, witty and educated man, who could speak Latin, Italian, Spanish and French. \\"He was of mean stature, but strong and comely and very valient, about 33 years old or somewhat more.\\" Thomas worked as a servant to William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle. He was educated as a lawyer, but following several years of dissipation travelled to Flanders and enrolled in the English army. He fought against Catholic Spain in the Low Countries, France and possibly against the Turks in Central Europe. However, by 1600 his views had changed; citing his belief in the injustice of fighting against the power of Catholic Spain, like his elder brother he became a passionate Catholic. Travelling as 'Mr Winter of Worcestershire', from 24 February 1601 he spent 13 days in Rome for the jubilee, and later that year and into 1602 travelled to Spain, to petition the Council on behalf of the Catholic rebels left leaderless by the execution of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. Father Henry Garnet, perhaps thinking that the purpose behind Thomas's visit was to gain financial support for impoverished English Catholics, sent him to Superior Father Joseph Creswell, who made the introductions to the Spanish. This trip to Spain later became the first of two visits to be dubbed by the English government as the Spanish Treason, but Thomas's timing was unfortunate, coming as it did so soon after Spain's failed attack in Ireland, and he received only vague assurances of their support. In England he met with the Spanish embassy Don Juan de Tassis, who in August 1603 landed at Dover to help negotiate an Anglo-Spanish treaty. Tassis quickly realised that any chance of a successful Catholic rebellion was unlikely, and discounted Thomas's claim that, with funding, \\"3,000 Catholics\\" would be available for the cause. After meeting with King James he wrote to Spain emphasising the need to prioritise peace with England over the freedom of her Catholics. Thomas meets with Robert Catesby and John Wright According to contemporary accounts late in February 1604 Thomas's cousin, Robert Catesby, invited him to his house in Lambeth, but Thomas was indisposed and could not attend. Catesby sent a second letter that Thomas did respond to, and when he arrived he found his cousin with John Wright, a devout Catholic and a renowned swordsman. Catesby planned to re-establish Catholicism in England by blowing up the House of Lords during the State Opening of Parliament, killing the king. Thomas did not immediately recoil from the idea. As a former soldier he was a practical man, and he agreed with Catesby that should the plot succeed, it would \\"breed a confusion fit to beget new alterations\\". He also offered a warning of the price of failure: \\"the scandal would be so great which the Catholic religion might hereby sustain, as not only our enemies, but our friends also would with good reason condemn us.\\" He nevertheless agreed to join the conspiracy, and as Catesby had not entirely given up hope of foreign support—\\"because we will leave no peaceable and quiet way untried\\"—Thomas returned to the continent. In Flanders he met Juan Fernández de Velasco, 5th Duke of Frías and Constable of Castile, who was holding court there before his journey to England to conclude the Treaty of London. Thomas again stressed the plight of English Catholics, hoping to influence the forthcoming treaty negotiations due to take place at Somerset House in London. The Constable was \\"friendly rather than forthcoming\\". Thomas also met the Welsh spy Hugh Owen, and Sir William Stanley, who were both disparaging of Catesby's hopes of Spanish assistance. Owen did, however, introduce Thomas to Guy Fawkes, a committed Catholic who had served under Stanley as a soldier in the Southern Netherlands. Although at that time the plotters had no detailed plans, Thomas told Fawkes of their ambition to \\"do somewhat in England\\", should Spanish support be lacking. In late April therefore the two men returned together to Catesby's lodgings at Lambeth, and told him that despite positive noises from the Spanish, \\"the deeds would nott answere\\"... Robert joins With the addition to the conspiracy of Thomas Percy (John Wright's brother-in-law), the five plotters met at the Duck and Drake inn, in the fashionable Strand district of London, on 20 May 1604. From hereon Thomas Wintour remained at the heart of the conspiracy. The group leased properties in London, one in Lambeth for storing the gunpowder that was rowed across the Thames to its destination. His confession has the plotters digging a tunnel toward their target during one of the several prorogations of Parliament, abandoned when the chamber directly beneath the House of Lords became available. Following the meeting in May Catesby enlisted the aid of several more Catholic men, including Robert Wintour. On the same day he was admitted to the plot, 25 March 1605, the conspirators also purchased the lease to the undercroft they had supposedly tunnelled near. It was into this room that 36 barrels of gunpowder were brought, but when in late August Thomas and Fawkes made an inspection of the gunpowder, they found that it had decayed (separated). Thus, more gunpowder was brought in. Shortly after this, Catesby recruited the last three conspirators, Sir Ambrose Rookwood, Sir Everard Digby and Francis Tresham. The latter's involvement in the plot has long been the subject of controversy, as on 26 October his brother-in-law William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, received an anonymous letter while at home, warning him to stay away from Parliament. Thomas went with Catesby to confront Tresham on the matter, threatening to \\"hang him\\" if he did not exonerate himself. Tresham managed to convince the pair that he was innocent, but Thomas then tried unsuccessfully to persuade Catesby to abandon the plot. His pleas were in vain; Catesby's position was echoed by Percy, who at a meeting of the three in London on Sunday 3 November, said that he was ready to \\"abide the uttermost trial\\". On the same day, Robert and three others stayed at the home of John Talbot of Grafton, his father-in- law. His friends were Robert Acton and his two sons, plus servants. The group left the following morning with extra horses supplied by Everard Digby, and travelled to Coventry. Failure and capture Monteagle had delivered the letter to the English Secretary of State, Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, and on Saturday 2 November (about a week later) the Privy Council decided to undertake a search of Parliament. The following Monday, during the first search, Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk, noticed the huge pile of faggots in the corner of the cellar beneath the House of Lords. The king insisted that another search be made, and about midnight another party, this time led by Thomas Knyvet, 1st Baron Knyvet, discovered Fawkes and arrested him. News of Fawkes's capture soon spread throughout London, including the Strand, where Christopher Wright, John Wright's brother, overheard the commotion. He immediately went to Thomas, who was staying at the Duck and Drake inn. As Fawkes had given his name as \\"John Johnson\\", servant of Percy, it was for the latter that the government's first arrest warrant was issued. Thomas guessed as much, and told Wright to go to Percy and \\"bid him begone\\". As the rest of those conspirators still in London fled the city, undaunted, he went over to Westminster to try and discern what he could. In author Alan Haynes's opinion, this demonstrated an impressive degree of trust in Fawkes's ability to confound his interrogators, but when Thomas heard for himself that the treason had been uncovered, he left for Huddington, stopping at his sister's house in Norbrook along the way. The fugitives reached Catesby's family home of Ashby St Ledgers at about 6:00 pm. Not wanting to implicate his mother, Catesby sent a message to Robert, who had just recently arrived there, asking to meet just outside the town. There he told him that Fawkes had been captured. At Dunchurch they collected Everard Digby and his 'hunting party', which included Robert and Thomas's half-brother, John Wintour. He had been invited to join them on 4 November. The next day the group raided Warwick Castle for supplies, something that Robert strongly objected to as it would create \\"a great uproar\\" in the country, and later arrived at Huddington Court, where they met Thomas. Early the next morning Huddington's occupants went to confession and took the Sacrament at Mass—in Fraser's opinion, a sign that none of them thought they had long to live. They collected further arms and munitions from Hewell Grange, but trying to recruit more people to their cause they were met with disdain; while the conspirators considered themselves to stand for \\"God and country\\", the men of Hewell Grange replied that they were for \\"King James as well as God and Country\\". Late that night, pulling a sodden cart full of weapons and armour behind them, they arrived at Holbeche House, near Kingswinford in Staffordshire. Robert was asked if he would go and see if he could elicit any help from his father-in-law, John Talbot at his mansion at 'Pepperhill'. He refused, and Thomas went instead, with Stephen Littleton. Talbot was, however, loyal to James, and sent them away, claiming that their visit was \\"as much as his life was worth\\". While returning to Holbeche, they received a message that Catesby, Rookwood, John Grant and another man were dead, and the rest apparently fled. Tired and desperate, the plotters had attempted to dry their soaked gunpowder in front of the fire, only for a stray spark to ignite it. While Littleton chose to leave, begging his companion to follow his example, Thomas continued on to Holbeche, where he found the remaining plotters alive, but injured. While several including Robert and his half-brother John chose to vanish into the night, Catesby, Percy, the Wright brothers, Grant, Rookwood and Thomas remained. Thomas asked them what they intended to do – \\"We mean here to die\\". Thomas replied \\"I will take such part as you do\\". Richard Walsh, Sheriff of Worcester, arrived with a vigilante force of about 200 men early on 8 November. Thomas was the first to be hit, in the shoulder, while crossing the courtyard. The Wright brothers were next, followed by Rookwood, still injured from the explosion the night before. Catesby and Percy were dropped by a single lucky shot. The sheriff's men then proceeded to strip the defenders of their valuables, but Thomas was saved by the sheriff's assistant. His fine sword, ordered and paid for four months previously, apparently proved too great a temptation for the Sheriff's men, as it was never seen again. He and the others were taken first to Worcester, and then to the Tower of London. Despite a proclamation of 18 November naming them as wanted men, Robert Wintour and Stephen Litteton managed to evade capture until 9 January 1606. They spent about two months hiding out in barns and houses; at one point they were forced to restrain a drunken poacher who happened upon their hiding place. They were eventually discovered at the house of Humphrey Littleton in Hagley, after a cook, John Finwood, informed on them. Humphrey managed to escape, but was captured at Prestwood, in Staffordshire. Thomas's confession Historically, much of what is written about the Gunpowder Plot is derived from Thomas's confession, signed on 23 November 1605; details of the so-called Spanish Treason were added three days later. One of only two confessions printed in the King's Book (a highly partial contemporary account of the affair), Thomas Wintour's was the only account the government had of a plotter who had been involved from the beginning; Guy Fawkes, weakened by days of torture, may have been at the heart of the group, but he was not at its first meetings. However, Antonia Fraser views the document with suspicion, not least because Thomas's signature, 'Thomas Winter', differs from his normal signature, 'Thomas Wintour' (it was the former that was invariably used by the government). The signature, possibly forged by lieutenant of the Tower of London William Waad, was made only weeks after Thomas had been shot in the shoulder during the siege at Holbeche House. Biographer Mark Nicholls views the difference in signatures as a significant and puzzling lapse, if a \\"master forger\\" is presumed to be responsible for the document. He views the handwriting on the confession as \\"convincingly that of Winter [Wintour]\\", pointing out that it appears to be the work of an author, not an editor, and written as a draft for the King's Book. This is a view that generally, Alan Haynes agrees with: \\"no one has ever made a solid and sensible suggestion about why a government-employed forger (say Thomas Phelippes) would deliberately make such an error in a crucial state document\\". Another of Fraser's concerns is Waad's report to Salisbury on 21 November: \\"Thomas Winter doth find his hand so strong as after dinner he will settle himself to write that he hath verbally declared to your Lordship adding what he shall remember\\"—or rather, what he was told to remember. A draft of Thomas's confession, in Coke's handwriting, places extra weight on the involvement of the Jesuits. Thomas's confession also details his account of the mine supposedly dug toward Parliament, not mentioned in Fawkes's first confession. Trial and death Print of members of the Gunpowder Plot being hanged, drawn, and quartered The trial of the eight surviving conspirators began on Monday 27 January. The two brothers were brought with the other plotters by barge from the Tower (Catebsy's servant, Thomas Bates, arrived from the Gatehouse Prison), to Whitehall. They were kept in Star Chamber, before being led into Westminster Hall. Charged with high treason, and with no defence counsel, the outcome was never in doubt. The Spanish Treason was a feature of Attorney General Edward Coke's rhetoric, although the Spanish king was \\"reverently and respectfully spoken of\\". The Jesuits, such as Henry Garnet, were condemned. Each of the brothers' confessions were also read aloud. While in the Tower, Robert and Fawkes had shared adjacent cells, and were able to speak to each other. However, their private conversation was secretly recorded, and read aloud during the trial. When asked if he had anything to say, \\"wherefore judgement of death should not be pronounced\\", Thomas spoke of his regret at having introduced Robert to the plot, and asked to be hanged on his behalf as well as his own. Robert merely begged for mercy. At the end of the trial, the jury pronounced them all guilty of high treason. Everard Digby, Robert Wintour, John Grant and Thomas Bates were executed on Thursday 30 January 1606. Dragged by horse to Old St Paul's Cathedral, Robert was the second to be executed, praying quietly to himself before he was hanged, drawn and quartered. The following morning, the remaining four were dragged to the Old Palace Yard at Westminster, opposite the building they had planned to destroy. Thomas was the first to mount the scaffold. It was customary to grant the condemned a speech, but Thomas, \\"a very pale and dead colour\\", said it was \\"no time to discourse: he was come to die\\". He absolved the Jesuits of any involvement in the plot, asked for Catholics to pray for him, and declared his adherence to the Roman religion. He was hanged for only a few seconds, and then taken to the block for the remainder of his grim sentence. Their half- brother John was executed at Red Hill near Worcester, on 7 April.

He was married to Tessy Antony, a former NCO in the Luxembourg Army, from whom he separated in 2017. They have two sons: Prince Gabriel and Prince Noah. Early life and education Prince Louis was born on 3 August 1986 at Grand Duchess Charlotte Maternity Hospital in Luxembourg City. After completing his primary education at the Ecole de Lorentzweiler, Prince Louis continued his secondary education at the American School of Luxembourg. He then went to the Collège Beau Soleil in Switzerland, where he earned his high school diploma in 2005. During his time in Switzerland, he developed a particular interest in social and humanitarian work. He has taken part in missions organised by an NGO, in cooperation with his school, in Mumbai, India. There, he taught English to children from the poorest neighbourhoods of the city and to children living on the street. After his return to Europe, he followed what seems to have become a calling and carried out a one-year traineeship at the headquarters of the Red Cross in Geneva. During his school holidays, he also participated in programmes for looking after groups of children and supporting the elderly. After spending two years in the United States, where Prince Louis underwent training in \\"Aeronautics and Aeronautical Management\\" and gained his \\"Private pilot certificate\\", the princely family moved to the United Kingdom. There, Prince Louis and Princess Tessy attended university. In May 2014, Prince Louis graduated from Richmond, The American International University in London with a BA in Art in Communications. He wrote his undergraduate dissertation on humanitarian advertisement. He then continued his study at Birkbeck College in London and obtained a master's degree in Psychosocial Studies. In the International Forum on Learning Disabilities, held on 30 January 2016 in Luxembourg, Prince Louis testified for the first time in public about his struggle with dyslexia. He was diagnosed at the age of 10. He said of his learning difficulty, \\"I did not understand what was happening. I was constantly forced to try to achieve the same levels as others. That takes a lot of time and leaves you frustrated because you can't do it.\\" The Prince also said that he took sport, especially rugby, as the outlet of his frustration. Prince Louis has a deep understanding and willingness to support dyslexic people, thanks to his personal experience and training with Béatrice Sauvageot, a recognized expert in this field. Currently, he lives in Paris and works as a consultant for Laurent Meeschaert Conseil.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eKWltfM3muI Prince Louis speaks Luxembourgish, French, English and German fluently. He also has a sound knowledge of Spanish. He is the godfather of his nephew, Prince Charles of Luxembourg. Marriage and family On 12 March 2006, Tessy Antony gave birth to a boy, named Gabriel Michael Louis Ronny de Nassau, who was born at a private Swiss hospital, Clinic des Grangettes, in Geneva. Their son was the first grandchild of Grand Duke Henri and Grand Duchess Maria Teresa. Prince Louis married Tessy Antony on 29 September 2006 in Gilsdorf's Roman Catholic parish church. Upon his initially morganatic marriage, he gave up his succession rights and those of all the couple's children. Although Louis retained his title of \\"Prince of Luxembourg\\" and the style of \\"Royal Highness\\", his wife and son were originally only given the surname de Nassau with no titles. The couple's second son, Noah Etienne Guillaume Gabriel Matthias Xavier de Nassau, was born on 21 September 2007 at the Grand Duchess Charlotte Maternity Hospital. The baby was baptised at the same church in Gilsdorf where his parents married and his elder brother was christened. Sometime after the birth of Noah, Tessy had a third pregnancy which ended in a miscarriage. On Luxembourg's National Day on 23 June 2009, Tessy was given the title of \\"Princess of Luxembourg\\" and the style \\"Royal Highness\\". Their sons and future children were also given the title \\"Prince of Nassau\\" with the style \\"Royal Highness\\". The family lived in London. The Grand Ducal Court announced the separation of Louis and Tessy on 18 January 2017. Divorce proceedings began in the United Kingdom, where the couple lived. The divorce was finalized on 4 April 2019.  Patronage  Prince Louis is a patron of the Luxembourg Federation of Table Tennis (since 2004), the Martial Arts Federation (since 2010), and the Luxembourg Aeronautical Federation (since 2011).

The community includes the parish of Llangolman. Origin of the name The Welsh placename means \\"black monastic grange\\": before the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the parish belonged to St Dogmaels Abbey. Geography Mynachlog-ddu sits on a plateau above sea level between Carn Menyn (365m) and Foel Dyrch (368m) in the Preseli Hills. History Mynachlog-ddu and the surrounding Preselis are rich in prehistoric remains. It is one of the possible sites of the Battle of Mynydd Carn in 1081. By c.1100 it was under the control of the Normans. Much has been unenclosed moorland since mediaeval times, with few houses. The village developed as housing for slate quarry workers and there has been a chapel in the village since 1794. The population of the parish in 1821 was 447. Mynachlog-ddu Carn Menyn is presumed to be the source of the bluestones used in the inner circle of Stonehenge. In 2000/2001 a project was established to try to transport a piece of bluestone from the village to Stonehenge. The project ended when the stone sank in the sea. It was lifted out a few months after, but the project was never resumed. A comedy based on the idea of a campaign to have the bluestones returned Bringing Back the Bluestones premiered in Pembrokeshire. There are six listed structures in the community. Worship There are two places of worship in the village: the Anglican church (Church in Wales) of St Dogfael (sometimes, Dogmael), and Bethel, the Baptist meeting house. Notable people * The poet Waldo Williams (1904–1971) was a pupil at the primary school (where his father was headteacher) between 1911 and 1915, where he learned to speak Welsh. There is a memorial to him at nearby Rhos Fach. * Dutch naval officer and Colditz prisoner of war camp escapee Damiaen Joan van Doorninck (1902-1987) spent his retirement in Mynachlogddu and died there.

It aims to provide the infrastructure for a metaverse-like public virtual territory. Relying on a peer-to-peer architecture, the virtual world may potentially be inhabited by a theoretically unlimited number of participants. Motivations A central objective of Solipsis is to create a virtual world which is as independent as possible from the influence of private interests, such as server ownership. In order to achieve this, it is based around a peer-to-peer model rather than the traditional server-client one. Additionally, it aims to give users more flexibility in designing interfaces and content in their individual segments of the virtual world. Main principles A Solipsis entity is a basic element of the virtual world. To exist, an entity should run a node that may be controlled by a navigator. Nodes are self-organized in a pure peer-to-peer network, in which relationships depend on virtual proximity. A navigator is mainly a graphical user interface, but some communication services may be added to one for interaction between entities. The virtual world is initially empty and is only filled by entities run by end users' computers. All Solipsis nodes are functionally equal, and no preordained infrastructure is required. This eliminates as far as possible any restrictions on the content or functionality of the world. Current status Solipsis currently consists of: *A peer-to-peer protocol over UDP. The Solipsis protocol gives a node the ability to broadcast its presence within the virtual world. Moreover, this protocol aims to guarantee the maintenance of some global properties. *A node- navigator interface, which takes the form of an API between the node and the navigator. Currently written in XML-RPC, this interface allows a navigator to control a node and to retrieve information on its virtual surroundings. *A basic implementation of a Solipsis Node and a Solipsis navigator licensed under the LGPL. The navigator features a two-dimensional representation of the virtual world. The design of current interface resembles YackPack, an interactive system developed by the company of the same name, by a team of engineers in Santa Rosa, led by Chief Technology Officer David Levine and envisioned by Professor BJ Fogg of Stanford University. Interaction between entities consists only of chat. *Some other services, which implement blogs, some identity fields for social networking, file sharing, and graphical chat.

They are widely used in the method of finite differences to produce first order methods for solving or approximating solutions to equations. Definition Given a twice continuously differentiable function f of one real variable, Taylor's theorem for the case n = 1 states that : f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) + R_2\\\\ where R_2 is the remainder term. The linear approximation is obtained by dropping the remainder: : f(x) \\\\approx f(a) + f'(a)(x - a). This is a good approximation when x is close enough to a; since a curve, when closely observed, will begin to resemble a straight line. Therefore, the expression on the right-hand side is just the equation for the tangent line to the graph of f at (a,f(a)). For this reason, this process is also called the tangent line approximation. If f is concave down in the interval between x and a, the approximation will be an overestimate (since the derivative is decreasing in that interval). If f is concave up, the approximation will be an underestimate. Linear approximations for vector functions of a vector variable are obtained in the same way, with the derivative at a point replaced by the Jacobian matrix. For example, given a differentiable function f(x, y) with real values, one can approximate f(x, y) for (x, y) close to (a, b) by the formula :f\\\\left(x,y\\\\right)\\\\approx f\\\\left(a,b\\\\right)+\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x}\\\\left(a,b\\\\right)\\\\left(x-a\\\\right)+\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial y}\\\\left(a,b\\\\right)\\\\left(y-b\\\\right). The right-hand side is the equation of the plane tangent to the graph of z=f(x, y) at (a, b). In the more general case of Banach spaces, one has : f(x) \\\\approx f(a) + Df(a)(x - a) where Df(a) is the Fréchet derivative of f at a. Applications Optics Gaussian optics is a technique in geometrical optics that describes the behaviour of light rays in optical systems by using the paraxial approximation, in which only rays which make small angles with the optical axis of the system are considered. In this approximation, trigonometric functions can be expressed as linear functions of the angles. Gaussian optics applies to systems in which all the optical surfaces are either flat or are portions of a sphere. In this case, simple explicit formulae can be given for parameters of an imaging system such as focal distance, magnification and brightness, in terms of the geometrical shapes and material properties of the constituent elements. Period of oscillation The period of swing of a simple gravity pendulum depends on its length, the local strength of gravity, and to a small extent on the maximum angle that the pendulum swings away from vertical, θ0, called the amplitude. It is independent of the mass of the bob. The true period T of a simple pendulum, the time taken for a complete cycle of an ideal simple gravity pendulum, can be written in several different forms (see Pendulum (mathematics) ), one example being the infinite series: includes a derivation : T = 2\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{L\\\\over g} \\\\left( 1+ \\\\frac{1}{16}\\\\theta_0^2 + \\\\frac{11}{3072}\\\\theta_0^4 + \\\\cdots \\\\right) where L is the length of the pendulum and g is the local acceleration of gravity. However, if one takes the linear approximation (i.e. if the amplitude is limited to small swings,A \\"small\\" swing is one in which the angle θ is small enough that sin(θ) can be approximated by θ when θ is measured in radians ) the period is: :T \\\\approx 2\\\\pi \\\\sqrt\\\\frac{L}{g} \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\theta_0 \\\\ll 1 \\\\qquad (1)\\\\, In the linear approximation, the period of swing is approximately the same for different size swings: that is, the period is independent of amplitude. This property, called isochronism, is the reason pendulums are so useful for timekeeping. Successive swings of the pendulum, even if changing in amplitude, take the same amount of time. Electrical resistivity The electrical resistivity of most materials changes with temperature. If the temperature T does not vary too much, a linear approximation is typically used: :\\\\rho(T) = \\\\rho_0[1+\\\\alpha (T - T_0)] where \\\\alpha is called the temperature coefficient of resistivity, T_0 is a fixed reference temperature (usually room temperature), and \\\\rho_0 is the resistivity at temperature T_0. The parameter \\\\alpha is an empirical parameter fitted from measurement data. Because the linear approximation is only an approximation, \\\\alpha is different for different reference temperatures. For this reason it is usual to specify the temperature that \\\\alpha was measured at with a suffix, such as \\\\alpha_{15}, and the relationship only holds in a range of temperatures around the reference. When the temperature varies over a large temperature range, the linear approximation is inadequate and a more detailed analysis and understanding should be used.

L. Lucas (Golden Cockerel Press, 1948); an Edgar Mansfield binding The Golden Cockerel Press was an English fine press operating between 1920 and 1961.  History  The private press made handmade limited editions of classic works. The type was hand-set and the books were printed on handmade paper, and sometimes on vellum. A feature of Golden Cockerel books was the original illustrations, usually wood engravings, contributed by artists including Eric Gill, Robert Gibbings, Peter Claude Vaudrey Barker-Mill, John Buckland Wright, Blair Hughes-Stanton, Agnes Miller Parker, David Jones, Mark Severin, Dorothea Braby, Lettice Sandford, Gwenda Morgan, Mary Elizabeth Groom and Eric Ravilious. Hal Taylor's foundation (1920–1924) The Golden Cockerel Press was founded by Harold (Hal) Midgley Taylor (1893–1925) in 1920 and was first in Waltham St Lawrence in Berkshire where he had unsuccessfully tried fruit farming. Taylor bought an army surplus hut and assembled it in Waltham St Lawrence as a combined workshop and living quarters. The Press was set up as a cooperative with four partners, Hal Taylor, Barbara Blackburn, Pran Pyper, and Ethelwynne (Gay) Stewart McDowall. In April 1920 Hal Taylor and Gay McDowall had married. The four initially lived at Taylor's mother's house in Beaconsfield and cycled daily to the hut in Waltham St Lawrence. It was Taylor who persuaded his family trust to provide most of the capital (approximately £2,800) for printing presses et al. Their first prospectus proclaimed: \\"This press is a co-operative society for the printing and publishing of books. It is co-operative in the strictest sense. Its members are their own craftsmen, and will produce their books themselves in their own communal workshops without recourse to paid and irresponsible labour\\". Their first publications were The Voices, a literary review, and Adam & Eve & Pinch Me, short stories by a new author, A. E. Coppard, which was a critical success and sold well. Unfortunately the mood of idealism of the first prospectus did not last long. Proof-reading, for example, had been poor, which upset the authors. By summer 1921 Blackburn and Pyper had left and the co-operative became a more conventional private press when Frank Young, Albert Cooper and Harry Gibbs were employed. In 1923 the press published The Wedding Songs of Spenser with colour wood engravings by Ethelbert White, the first illustrated book from the press and a foretaste of editions to come. When Hal Taylor suffered a recurrent bout of tuberculosis, Coppard took charge as a temporary manager. But then with Taylor's continued decline the business was put up for sale, early in 1924. Robert Gibbings period (1924–1933) An artwork by Eric Gill for the Golden Cockerel's 1941 edition of the Gospels. The Golden Cockerel typeface, designed for the press by Gill Robert Gibbings was working on wood engravings for The Lives of Gallant Ladies at the time the press was put up for sale, and, to secure publication of this work, he sought a loan from a friend, Hubert Pike, a director of Bentley Motors, to buy the press.Martin J. Andrews, The Life and Work of Robert Gibbings (Bicester, Primrose Hill Press, 2003), . He took over in February 1924, paying £850 for the huts housing the business, the plant and goodwill. For the partially completed Gallant Ladies a further sum of £200 was paid. He also leased the house and land for £40 per annum. Gallant Ladies sold well with receipts of over £1,800, and saw the start of a golden period for the press. The printing staff – Frank Young, Albert Cooper and Harry Gibbs – were skilled and capable of very fine work.Mary Kirkus, Robert Gibbings: a Bibliography (London, J.M. Dent & Sons, 1962). Moira Gibbings helped her husband in the business, and Gibbings kept close links with Coppard. Gibbings knew all the leading wood engravers of the day (he was a founder member and leading light of the Society of Wood EngraversJoanna Selborne, 'The Society of Wood Engravers: the early years’ in Craft History 1 (1988), published by Combined Arts.) and a number of authors, which enabled him to publish modern texts as well as classic ones. The first book for which Gibbings was entirely responsible was Moral Maxims by Rochefoucault (1924). Eric Gill was brought into the fold when he quarrelled with Hilary Pepler over the publication of Enid Clay's Sonnets and Verses (1925) and transferred the book to Gibbings. In 1925 he went on to commission engravings from John Nash, Noel Rooke, David Jones, John Farleigh and Mabel Annesley among others. Gibbings published some 71 titles at the press and printed a number of books for others. The size of a run was normally between 250 and 750, and the books were mostly bound in leather by bookbinders Sangorski & Sutcliffe. The major titles were the four volume Canterbury Tales (1929 to 1931) and the Four Gospels (1931), both illustrated by Gill. Gibbings printed 15 copies of the Canterbury Tales on vellum, and 12 copies of the Four Gospels. Printing the Canterbury Tales dominated work at the press for two and a half years, and relatively few other books were printed during that period. However, the book was a considerable critical and financial success and grossed £14,000. 1931 saw the first appearance of the Golden Cockerel typeface, designed especially for the press by Gill. Its first use was in A. E. Coppards The Hundredth Story. The illustrations in some Golden Cockerel titles, although tame by modern standards, were considered risqué for the time and necessitated the press taking precautionary measures against possible prosecutions for obscenity or provocation, such as disguising the names of translators and illustrators. Gallant Ladies was mild in comparison with the Song of Songs (1925) and Procreant Hymn (1926), both illustrated fairly explicitly by Gill. The main defence of the press was that it was a private press, not a bookseller. Sales were strong during most of this period. Gibbings had established links with a number of booksellers, notably Bumpus in London, and negotiated a very favourable deal with Random House. He bought out Pike with finance from another Irish friend, Mary Wiggin, and later bought her out, borrowing the money from Barclays Bank. In the early 1930s, however, the business climate changed, and, as American sales faltered, the press struggled on as the depression became more severe. The press became moribund and Gibbings eventually sold up in 1933. The last book that he produced was Lord Adrian by Lord Dunsany (1933), illustrated with his own wood engravings. Christopher Sandford period (1933–1959) The press was taken over by Christopher Sandford, Owen Rutter, and Francis J. Newbery. They paid £1,050 for the business. Gibbings had been in negotiations with Sandford for some time, and had introduced Rutter to him. Newbery was the manager of the Chiswick Press, where production was to be moved. The Golden Cockerel Press ceased to be a private press at this point, and became a publishing house. Sandford worked long hours on management, editing and design. Rutter solicited new books and edited some of them. Newbery's role as the printer was to oversee the production work at the Chiswick Press. The first book published under the new regime was The House with the Apricot (1933) by H. E. Bates. It featured wood engravings by Agnes Miller Parker and had been planned by Gibbings. The first major book of the new regime was The Glory of Life (1934) by Llewelyn Powys, a large quarto with wood engravings by Gibbings. The partners lost money on most of the books that they published, a fact that they had recognised when they bought the press. They were looking to the long term, and tried a number of strategies to strengthen their position, including offering to buy the Gregynog Press so that they could close it down and reduce the competition. The partners had to advance money from their private accounts to keep the press solvent. There had been tension between the three for some timeDavid Chambers, 'Sandford, Gibbings, Newbury and Rutter' in Private Library (Spring 1985), published by the Private Libraries Association. and Anthony Sandford replaced Newbery as a partner. He had a much more commercial approach than his brother Christopher and Rutter, and expected a return on his investment. The press started to produce unlimited editions aimed at the Christmas market, but these too failed in terms of commercial success. Rutter wrote to Christopher Sandford: \\"We are publishing edition after edition of which more than half remains as stock\\". Anthony Sandford left as a partner in 1938. In spite of all the problems caused by the advent of the Second World War there was one huge benefit for the press. People wanted books to read and by 1943 most of the Golden Cockerel stock, a growing liability, had been sold. In 1944 Rutter died but Sandford decided to carry on on his own; he had no financial need to seek a new partner, since the Chiswick Press, in which he had been a major shareholder, had been sold. Sandford introduced colour illustrations,Colour wood engravings from the Golden Cockerel edition of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight anathema to private press purists, and other means of reproducing illustrations instead of using original wood engravings – lithography and colour collotype. Some 120 works were published during the Sandford era. One favourite illustrator was John Buckland Wright, another Clifford Webb, from whom he commissioned wood engravings for eight books.Roderick Cave, 'Cockerels and Amazons' in Private Library (Spring 1988), published by the Private Libraries Association. Sandford also commissioned Lettice Sandford, his wife, and artist Dorothea Braby, to work on multiple books produced by the press.

By Algernon Charles Swinburn.jpg The Grecian Enchanted 01.jpg Thomas Yoseloff period (1959–1961) In 1959 Sandford, for whom the financial pressures of keeping the press going had become too much, sold the publishing business to Thomas Yoseloff, an American publisher and at the time director of University of Pennsylvania Press. Yoseloff completed the publication of two titles in 1960 that had been previously commissioned by Sandford, a translation by David Gwyn Williams of the poem \\"In Defence of Woman\\" (O Blaid Y Gwragedd) by the 16th century Welsh poet William Cynwal, illustrated by John Petts, and Poems and Sonnets of Shakespeare, edited by Gwyn Jones and illustrated by Buckland Wright. The following year, two more titles were issued under Yoseloff's direction, Folk Tales and Fairy Stories from India by Sudhin Ghose, and Moncrif's Cats, a translation by Reginald Bretnor of the 18th century French writer François-Augustin Paradis de Moncrifs 1727 work, Histoire des chats. These were to be the last two Golden Cockerel Press titles to be published, however, as the continuation of the business soon proved impractical. By the end of 1961 Yoseloff wound up operations, as the resources and fine bookcraft skills necessary for production of Golden Cockerel titles had become too difficult and costly to obtain.

During his career, he was a member of the groups 5 Elementz, Funky Cowboys, Promatic, Goon Sqwad, and D12. He was a close childhood friend of rapper Eminem, who also lived in Detroit. Proof was often a hype man at Eminem's concerts. Early life DeShaun Dupree Holton was born to Sharallene \\"Pepper\\" Holton, a single mother. His father, McKinley Jackson, was a music producer who left to pursue his career prior to Holton's birth. He was close friends with Eminem from a young age. 1999 Munich/Germany Juice Jam Music career Proof performing with Eminem in 2000 Originally known as Maximum, under the moniker \\"Proof\\", Holton first rose to national prominence as a part of the rap group D12, a hip-hop group he was instrumental in forming. Early individual accomplishments include being featured in The Source's \\"Unsigned Hype\\" column in 1999 and nearly winning the 1998 Blaze Battle. His first television appearance was in the video for Aaliyah's \\"Age Ain't Nothing But a Number\\". In 2000, Proof toured with Eminem, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Snoop Dogg in the Up In Smoke Tour, performing as a hype man for Eminem. He gained further exposure in 2001 with the release of Devil's Night, D12's debut album on Interscope Records. The following year, Proof collaborated with Dogmatic on \\"Promatic\\" and joined Eminem's \\"Anger Management\\" tour in support of the release. He appeared in the film 8 Mile along with Eminem and Xzibit. Proof appeared as Lil' Tic, a freestyle rapper who rap battles the lead character, B-Rabbit, played by Eminem. To capitalize on the publicity from the film, Proof released a six-song EP called Electric CoolAid: Acid Testing. Proof also starred in a cameo role, alongside the rest of D12 (except for Eminem), in The Longest Yard, appearing as \\"Basketball Convicts\\" during the credits. Solo work Proof released a solo album featuring collaborations with 50 Cent, Method Man, Nate Dogg, B-Real of Cypress Hill, T3 of Slum Village, Obie Trice, King Gordy, Eminem and D12. Proof said that he did not produce the record with Shady Records or Aftermath because he wanted to \\"build his own thing\\". Called Searching for Jerry Garcia, the album was released on August 9, 2005 on his own Iron Fist Records label in conjunction with Alliance Entertainment's IDN Distribution, ten years to the day following Grateful Dead frontman Jerry Garcia's death. It contained the prophetic song Kurt Kobain in which he wrote of his own death and 'passing the sign' to 1st Born as his protégé once he was gone. Proof has said that he considered Garcia to be a \\"genius\\" who suffered from common character flaws. Proof has stated his admiration for Garcia's eclectic style, saying that Garcia \\"went against the grain\\". Proof stated how he wanted to be remembered in an interview with SOHH.com shortly after his album release: \\"I want people to say that I was a true artist, that I did it best and stayed true to Hip Hop roots [...] I'd want people to understand I did it for the love, not for the charts.\\" The album received favorable reviews, which commented on its \\"eclectic\\" and \\"introspective\\" nature. Despite its list of guest appearances and favorable reviews, the release did not make a significant impact on the charts. Proof also recorded a track, \\"How I Live,\\" with Twiztid for their album Independents Day shortly before his death. Besides these, he recorded during his Gold Coast tour in 2006, which was exactly two weeks before his death, a song with \\"Liquidsilva\\" from Australia. Shooting and death On April 11, 2006, Proof was shot three times by Mario Etheridge, once in the head and twice in the chest, after a dispute broke out during a game of billiards on 8 Mile Road in Detroit, Michigan. A pool game between Proof and Keith Bender turned into a heated argument and then escalated into a physical altercation. Etheridge, who was Bender's cousin, fired a warning shot into the air. There have been many conflicting reports about Proof and Keith Bender's roles in the shooting, but it was reported that Proof then shot Bender in the head during the altercation.Lawrence Van Gelder, Arts Briefly: Rapper Who Was Killed Fired First Shot, Police Say, The New York Times, April 14, 2006, Accessed November 17, 2008. Bender was not immediately killed by the gunshot but died a week later from his injuries.Lawrence Van Gelder, Arts Briefly: Another Death in Shooting At Detroit Nightclub, The New York Times, April 19, 2006, Accessed November 17, 2008. In response to Proof shooting Bender, Etheridge then shot Proof three times, once in the head and twice in the chest, killing him at the scene. At the time of his death, Proof's blood alcohol content was 0.32, four times the legal DUI limit. An autopsy revealed that he did not have any illegal drugs in his system. Proof's lawyer, David Gorosh, accused the police and the media of being \\"reckless\\" for suggesting that his client fired the first shots without having any hard evidence. A few weeks after both men's death, Bender's family began a wrongful death suit against Proof's estate.Lawrence Van Gelder, Arts Briefly: Wrongful Death Suit Against Rapper's Estate, The New York Times, May 3, 2006, Accessed November 19, 2009. Authorities determined that Etheridge was acting lawfully in defense of another; however, he was found guilty of carrying an illegal firearm and discharging it inside of a building.Lawrence Van Gelder, Arts Briefly: Proof's Killer Convicted, The New York Times, September 22, 2006, Accessed November 17, 2008. On April 19, 2006, a service for Proof was held in the Fellowship Chapel in Detroit to a full house of 2,660 people, including life-long friend Eminem, Royce Da 5'9, 50 Cent, and thousands more mourning outside. He was then buried in Woodlawn Cemetery. Seven months after Proof's death, his close friend Reginald \\"Mudd\\" Moore, who was with him at the nightclub where he was killed, gave an exclusive interview with XXL magazine where he told a different account of what happened that night. In Mudd's version of the events, Proof is portrayed neither as the instigator nor a cold-blooded killer. According to Mudd, the night started out with him and Proof and two of their friends barhopping. They arrived at the Triple C club at around 3:55am, where a fight between Keith Bender and Proof escalated over a pool game. The bouncer Mario Etheridge then pulled out his gun and fired two shots into the air to break the fight up, but instead the shots caused panic. Mudd went on to state that an intoxicated Proof pushed him out of the way, reached for his gun and fired once into the air. Keith Bender then came from behind and started attacking Proof, trying to get the weapon out of his hand. Etheridge then came over and started shooting in the direction of Proof and Bender, killing both men. In 2008, Welsh singer/songwriter Jem dedicated the song \\"You Will Make It\\" to the memory of Proof (listed under his birth name DeShaun Holton) on her second album Down to Earth. In the liner notes, she said \\"For your families and friends and for all those who experienced the tragedy of sudden loss\\".Jem - Down To Earth (CD liner notes). ATO Records. 88088-21630-2 In early 2009, Jem revealed \\"The track is about losing someone and I wrote it the day after his friend Proof was murdered. I was in Detroit with Eminem's friends, who I happened to be recording with, when it happened\\". Eminem eulogized his friend with the unreleased track \\"Difficult\\", that leaked to the public in 2010. On the album Recovery, Eminem made a song dedicated to Proof called \\"You're Never Over\\" and also references him in the song “Going Through Changes”. Eminem also references Proof on \\"Elevator\\" from his 2009 album Relapse: Refill as well as under his birth name (DeShaun) on the song \\"Deja Vu\\" from the album Relapse as well as the single \\"Walk on Water\\" and on the songs \\"Believe\\" and \\"Arose\\" both from his 2017 album Revival. Proof was also mentioned by Eminem on the songs \\"Stepping Stone\\" and \\"Venom\\" from the 2018 album Kamikaze.

It was the site of initial European settlement in the area, and the location of the earlier components of the Port of Hobart. History The Cove was the initial landing site of what is now the city of Hobart. It was founded on 21 February 1804 by Lieutenant Governor David Collins, who travelled to the shore via what was then a rocky island named Hunter Island. The connection to the shore was developed and is now known as Hunter Street. The island now has a building directly above it. Although the first European settlement in the state was further up the river at Risdon Cove by John Bowen a year earlier, that settlement was abandoned and relocated to join the Sullivans Cove settlers. Collins named Sullivans Cove after John Sullivan, Permanent Under Secretary to the Colonies. 1954 map of Sullivans Cove By 1916, several piers had been constructed: from north to south: *Ocean Pier (built 1914) *Queens Pier (originally Alexandra Pier, renamed in 1910) *Kings Pier (built 1910) *Argyle Street Pier (built 1875) *Elizabeth Street Pier (built 1866) *Franklin Pier *Brooke Street Pier (built 1820s, renovated 1879). *Ferry Pier In 1933, the Argyle Street and Elizabeth Street Piers were replaced with a single concrete-reinforced structure at Elizabeth Street Pier. In 1947 there was a proposal to replace Queens and Kings Pier with an extra wide pier, but this was never realised. In 1948, Ocean Pier was destroyed by a fire. Kings Pier was demolished and replaced with a marina for commercial and private craft, around 1970. This marina increased in size in 2003. Current Sullivans Cove holds large historical and sentimental value for the city. The cove area itself is now known as Macquarie Wharf and serves as the main port for the city. Many of the original buildings along the esplanade are still standing. The University of Tasmania's School of the Arts building is based on Hunter Street. A serviced apartment building, ZeroDavey, has drawn criticism for its Davey Street facade, being condemned by the local community as aesthetically unpleasing consisting of a grey concrete prefabricated wall with jarring blue metal ledges, as opposed to the rest of the building having a sandstone facade to blend with the heritage Hunter Street buildings next door. During 2004 there has also been discussions about a proposal for a tourist tram from Sullivans Cove to the CBD, and possibly to North Hobart. An international design competition was held for the Hobart waterfront in 2006. It attracted 280 entries from over 50 countries. Three winners were announced on January 26, 2007. With the change in the cove's primary activity from a freight port to tourism and recreational uses, many of the sheds in the area have been either re-purposed or replaced – notably, all buildings keep the former gabled roof architecture. These buildings include: *Elizabeth Street Pier – restaurants, bar and function space *Princes Wharf Shed No. 1 – redeveloped as PW1 event space in 2011 *Princes Wharf Shed No. 2 – replaced in 2012 as the University of Tasmania's Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies centre *Macquarie Wharf Shed No. 1 – to be replaced in 2015 with a luxury hotel (under construction) *Macquarie Wharf Shed No. 2 – redeveloped in 2013 as MAC02 cruise ship terminal *Brooke Street Pier – replaced in 2014-15 with a ferry terminal/tourism transport hub Additional development in the immediate area include a $100m redevelopment of Parliament Square, behind Parliament House.

The metagonimiasis-causing flukes are one of two minute flukes called the heterophyids. Metagonimiasis was described by Katsurasa in 1911–1913 when he first observed eggs of M. yokagawai in feces (date is disputed in various studies). M. takahashii was described later first by Suzuki in 1930 and then M. miyatai was described in 1984 by Saito.  Signs and symptoms  The main symptoms are diarrhea and colicky abdominal pain. Because symptoms are often mild, infections can often be easily overlooked but diagnosis is important. Flukes attach to the wall of the small intestine, but are often asymptomatic unless in large numbers. Infection can occur from eating a single infected fish source. Peripheral eosinophilia is associated especially in early phase. When present in large numbers, can cause chronic intermittent diarrhea, nausea, and vague abdominal pains. Clinical complaints can also include lethargy and anorexia. In acute metagonimiasis, clinical manifestations are developed only 5–7 days after infection. Heavy infection has also been associated with epigastric distress, fatigue, and malaise. Occasionally, flukes invade the mucosa and eggs deposited in tissue may gain access to circulation. This can then lead to eggs embolizing in the brain, spinal cord, or heart. Granulomas may form around eggs and can cause seizures, neurologic deficits, or cardiac insufficiency. An interesting case in Japan found diabetes mellitus (DM) to be a sign of chronic infection with intracerebral hemorrhages as the acute sign of aggravation. Two months after administering praziquantel, the hemorrhages were gone, as was the diabetes. This unique case shows the potential of additional symptoms associated with metagonimiasis that are still unknown. Cause Metagonimiasis is most commonly caused by one of the two smallest flukes known to infect man, Metagonimus yokagawai, also called the Japanese fluke. More rarely, metagonimiasis can arise from infection with M. takahashii or M. miyatai. Recent studies analyzing the DNA of the three agents causing metagonimiasis found that DNA sequencing supports M. yokagawai and M. takahashii be placed in the same clade, and phylogenic tree analysis supports their genetic similarity. M. miyatai, however, was found to be more genetically distinct, and the authors concluded it should be nominated as a separate species. An additional study examining karyotype data on the three disease-causing agents also supported the nomination of M. miyatai as a separate species. Trematodes are one class of phylum Platyhelminthes from the order Digenia and are generally referred to as flukes. Metagonimiasis is of the family Herterophyidae.  Transmission  Transmission requires two intermediate hosts, the first of which is snails, most commonly of species Semisucospira libertina, Semiculcospira coreana, and Thiara granifera. Infection is acquired through the secondary intermediate host, fish, that have not been thoroughly cooked. Metacercariae encyst under the scales or in the flesh of fish from fresh or brackish water. Sweetfish (Pecoglossus altevelis) is one of the most common fish species infected, but others include the golden carp (Carassius auratus), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), Zacco temminckii, Protimus steindachneri, Acheilognathus lancedata, and Pseudorashora parva. Definitive hosts include humans and various fish- eating mammals, primarily dogs, cats, and pigs. Fish-eating birds may also be infected with metagonimiasis.  Reservoirs  Reservoirs include fish- eating mammals such as dogs, cats and pigs as well as fish-eating birds. The presence of heterophyid infection in humans is generally caused by a lack of host specificity by the parasites, as seen in the many non-human reservoirs for metagonimiasis. The many reservoirs also have negative implications on the efficacy of prevention and eradication efforts of the disease.  Incubation period  The incubation period is around 14 days and infestation may persist for more than one year.  Morphology  Adult Fluke (from CDC) Life cycle of Metagonimus yokogawai.  Eggs  The morphology of the eggs is very important for diagnosis, but is difficult as eggs are very small. Eggs have a smooth, hard shell that is transparent and yellow-brown with a more conventional, ovoid egg shape. They are about the same size as those of Heterophyes and Clonorchis, usually measuring 26-28 μm length and 15-17μm width. The egg also has a very slight opercular shoulder, marking the line of cleavage between the shell and operculum, an \\"escape hatch\\" for the mircidium. The Clonorchis has more distinctive tapering and a seated operculum that help distinguish it more readily from Metagonimus species.  Adult flukes  The body of the adult disease-causing agent of metagonimiasis is often described as leaf-shaped, similar to most trematodes. It is one of the smallest intestinal flukes, and is only slightly larger than Heteropheres. The most prominent feature is that its ventral sucker is deflected to the right of its midline and is closely associated with the opening of the genital pore. The testes are large and diagonal to each other while the smaller ovary is anterior to the testes and the uterus is filled with eggs. The uterus winds forward to the genital pore and is the largest organ in the body. The size of the adult fluke does not exceed 2.5 mm length by .75 mm width.  Diagnosis  Metagonimiasis is diagnosed by eggs seen in feces. Only after antihelminthic treatment will adult worms be seen in the feces, and then can be used as part of a diagnostic procedure. A 1993 analysis of the efficacy of ELISA tests to diagnose metagonimiasis implied that simultaneous screening of specific antibodies to several parasite agents are important in serological diagnosis of acute parasitic disease and more research should be done on the efficacy of these methods of diagnosis. Diagnosis may be difficult because the egg-laying capacity of heterophyids is limited, and therefore sedimentation concentration procedures may be needed to demonstrate eggs in lighter infections. Accurate species identification is also difficult because eggs of most flukes are similar in size and morphology, especially those of Heterophyes heterophyes, Clonorchis and Opisthorchis. It is important to ask where the person may have contracted the disease, find out if they have been to en endemic area, and check for signs and symptoms that would lead to metagonimiasis.  Prevention  Several public health prevention strategies could help lower the rates of metagonimiasis. One is to control the intermediate host (snails). This can be done through use of molluscidals. Another is to use education to ensure all people, especially in areas were the disease regularly occurs, fully cook all fish. This could potentially be problematic and not as effective as hoped as many of the people affected by metagonimiasis eat raw or pickled fish as part of a traditional, long-seated dietary practice. Additionally, implementing more sanitary water conditions would reduce the continual reintroduction of eggs to water sources, thus restarting the lifecycle. Complete control of metagonimiasis presents several potential problems because it does have several reservoir hosts, thus eradication is unlikely.  Treatment  Praziquantel is recommended in both adult and pediatric cases with dosages of 75 mg/kg/d in 3 doses for 1 day. Praziquantel is a Praziniozoquinoline derivative that alters the calcium flux through the parasite tectum and causes muscular paralysis and detachment of the fluke. Prizaquantel should be taken with liquids during a meal and as provided commercially as Biltricide. Praziquantel is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of metagonimiasis, but is approved for use on other parasitic infections. Praziquantel has some side effects but they are generally relatively mild and transient and a review of evidence shows it overall a well-tolerated drug. Possible side effects include abdominal pain, allergy, diarrhea, headache, liver problems, nausea or vomiting, exacerbation of porphyries, pruritus, rash, somnolence, vertigo, or dizziness. In fact, in 2002, the World Health Organization recommended the use of Praziquantel in pregnant and lactating women, though controlled trials are still needed to verify this. Another possible drug option is Tetrachloroethylene, a chlorinated hydrocarbon, but its use has been superseded by new antihelminthic drugs (like Praziquantel). A 1978 study also looked at the efficacy of several drugs on metagonimiasis infection, including bithionol, niclosamide, nicoflan, and Praziquantel. All drugs showed lower prevalence of eggs in feces, however only Praziquantel showed complete radical cure. Therefore, the authors concluded Praziquantel was the most highly effective, was very well tolerated, and was the most promising drug against metagonimiasis.  Epidemiology  Metagonimiasis infections are endemic or potentially endemic in 19 countries including Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, the Balkans, Spain, Indonesia, the Philippines and Russia. Human infections outside endemic areas may result from ingesting pickled fish or sushi made from fish imported from endemic areas.  Korea  Food-borne trematodes are currently the most important parasitic infections in Korea and approximately 240,000 Koreans are believed to be currently infected. Of the 240,000 estimated to be infected, 120,000 are caused by M. yokagawai, 20,000 by M. takahashii, and 100,000 by M. miyatai. The national rate of infections among randomly selected people was 1.2% in 1981, 1.0% in 1986, and down to 0.5% in 2004. M. yokagawai infections are found mostly around the large and small streams where sweetfish live and have been identified as endemic foci. M. miyatai and M. takahashii are prevalent along the upper reaches of the big rivers where minnows and carps are caught for eating raw.  Japan  Metagonimiasis is also common in Japan, with 10-15% prevalence rates in populations bordering major rivers and 150,000 estimated infected. Food-borne trematodes are most common in rural areas where traditional food habits are more preserved and raw freshwater fishes are incorporated into the diet. Both clonorchiasis and metagonimiasis have become infections of higher social classes in Hong Kong and Japan, owing to their frequent consumption of raw fish.  India  There have also recently been two reported cases in India, a location in which occurrence of infection is almost unknown. The second case, in 2005, was in a 6-year-old female patient presenting with loose watery stools for four days (however more details were not obtained as the patient was both deaf and dumb since birth). Upon examination, M. yokagawai eggs were found in stool, but the patient left and further analysis and treatment could not be completed.

It carries traffic over the Adelaide Hills between Adelaide and the River Murray, near Murray Bridge, connecting via the Swanport Bridge to the Dukes Highway which is the main road route to Victoria. It is often referred to by South Australians simply as the Freeway, as it was the first freeway in South Australia, and is still the longest, and the only one with \\"Freeway\\" in its name rather than \\"Expressway\\" or \\"Highway\\". It is a part of the National Highway network linking the state capital cities Adelaide to Melbourne and signed as National Highway M1. The South Eastern Freeway includes 500-metre-long twin-tube tunnels (the Heysen Tunnels) in the descent towards Adelaide, the first of their kind on the National Highway. It is designated as the M1. Structure The South Eastern Freeway features 6 lanes of traffic, arrester beds and concrete median barriers, with street lighting between Glen Osmond and Crafers. The remainder of the length to the Swanport Bridge is dual carriageways with two lanes in each direction. History Prior to the initial construction of the freeway in the 1960s, inbound and outbound road traffic between Adelaide and south-eastern South Australia or Victoria used a two-lane highway originally built in the early part of the 20th century. With growth in Adelaide's population issues of congestion and safety mandated reconstruction. Studies began in 1962 for a freeway commencing from Crafers, that endpoint selected arguably due to the massive expenditure required with the precedent upgrade of the Mount Barker Road. Road construction began in 1965 from Crafers and the first stage of eastbound traffic lanes were opened in 1967, the first westbound section in 1969. The freeway was opened in stages as construction progressed. The final section bypassing the town of Murray Bridge and connecting to the new Swanport Bridge over the River Murray opened in 1979, providing an alternative to the historic bridge in the town for through traffic. The Adelaide–Crafers Highway extension came as a much-needed upgrade and replacement to the previous link road, the Mount Barker Road, which had been contoured to the Adelaide Hills, giving rise to many steep turns, ascending a tortuous route. The tightest hairpin turn on the Mount Barker Road was infamous as the Devil's Elbow, often the site of car and semi- trailer accidents. On 16 May 1995, Prime Minister Paul Keating announced the construction of the new Adelaide-Crafers section. The Heysen Tunnels, named after well-known South Australian artist and benefactor Hans Heysen, were completed in 1998. Construction was completed early 2000 and on 5 March 2000 Prime Minister John Howard opened the new road. It was the largest South Australian road project at that time, costing a total of A$151 million, wholly funded by the Australian Federal Government. South Eastern Freeway from Mount Barker Summit An additional exit was built at Monarto around 1999 to service an expanding commercial zone and Monarto Zoo in the area. Another exit was announced in 2014 at Bald Hills Road 4 km southeast of the Mount Barker interchange to service growing housing estates in southern Mount Barker and Nairne. The contract was announced on 1 April 2015 that Bardavcol would commence construction in May 2015, with the interchange including entry and exit ramps in both directions. The $27M project was funded $16M by the Australian government, $8M from South Australia and $3M from Mount Barker district council. The new interchange opened on 15 August 2016. The Freeway bypasses many towns previously along the Princes Highway including * Eagle On The Hill * Crafers * Stirling * Aldgate * Bridgewater * Verdun * Hahndorf * Mount Barker * Littlehampton * Nairne * Kanmantoo * Callington * Monarto * Murray Bridge Road safety Shortly after the Adelaide-Crafers section opened, several incidents involving semi-trailers drew media attention to the road. While the previous Mount Barker Road was a notorious stretch, its dangers were well known; the new freeway presented the new challenge of a sustained continuous gradient with traffic lights at the bottom. Heavy vehicles with inadequate braking found it hard to slow down once they had exceeded a certain speed; this was made worse with brake failures. It took some time, and the addition of several warning signs prior to the descent, for heavy vehicles to become familiar with the freeway's characteristics. Semi- trailers can be seen travelling as slow as 20–30 km/h downhill. In 2005 changeable electronic road signs were installed every 200 metres, so that the speed limit of the road can be adjusted from Transport SA headquarters in Adelaide. This has both improved safety for commuters, and emergency service workers like the Country Fire Service. In 2010 and 2011, after more incidents involving trucks having problems successfully braking down the hill, including one going into a bus stop, and another going straight through the intersection at the bottom, the government added new laws that any vehicle with 5 axles or more must stay in the left lane and must not exceed a 60 km/h limit from the interchange at Crafers to the old tollhouse. More Safety cameras are installed in an attempt to ensure trucks abide by this new limit. Additional signs for the two arrester beds on the descent have also been added, to encourage out of control drivers to use them as a safer alternative. In August 2014, another truck collided with many cars at the lower part of the highway, killing two people. Brake failure was suspected to be the cause of the accident. Connections The Adelaide end of the South Eastern Freeway leads downhill to traffic lights at the intersection of Glen Osmond Road which continues northwest as route number A1 into the Adelaide city centre, Portrush Road which carries the National Highway designation (as A17) north to bypass the city and towards Port Adelaide, and Cross Road which leads west towards the southern suburbs of Adelaide. The southeastern end of the freeway, near Murray Bridge feeds onto the Swanport Bridge, a two-lane, bridge over the River Murray, where it joins the Princes Highway, a dual-carriageway highway to Tailem Bend. At this point, Highway 1 becomes a two-laned, two-way scenic route which passes through many coastal towns of South Australia and Victoria. The National Highway continues to Melbourne as the Dukes Highway (A8) from Tailem Bend to the Victorian border and beyond as the Western Highway.

The encoding uses a maximum of 4 digits (\\"0\\" - \\"9\\") to represent a Chinese character. All possible shapes of strokes that forms any given Chinese character are classified into 10 groups, each represented by one of the ten possible digits 0-9. Chinese characters can then be input by following the order in which the strokes are identified at the 4 corners of the character. As a result of this simplicity in coding using the ten numeric digits, users typically need to use only a numeric keypad to input Chinese. Implementations for both Traditional and Simplified Chinese are available though the coding principle applies to both. In other words, users only need to be trained once and the skill can be applied equally well to both Traditional and Simplified Chinese version of the CKC Chinese Input System. Training courses on the CKC Chinese Input System are provided by training centres in CKC Centre for the Development of Information Technology for Chinese Language Teaching of The Hong Kong Institute of Education, IVE Haking Wong and of Hong Kong University Mapping Example of CKC Chinese Input System. The mapping between groups of stokes and their corresponding digits 0-9 can be described by the following: : 一橫二豎三點捺 : 叉四插五方塊六 : 七角八八九是小 : 撇與左勾都是零 This means: 1 represents a horizontal stroke, 2 a vertical or diagonal stroke, 3 a dot or left-to-right diagonal stroke, 4 two strokes in a cross shape, 5 three or more strokes in which one stroke intersects all others, 6 a box- shape, 7 where a stroke turns a corner, 8 the shape of the Chinese character 八 and its inverted form, 9 the shape of the Chinese character 小 and its inverted form, and 0 a right-to-left diagonal or left hook stroke. Coding principle : single character 1\\\\. Order of coding : start from the top left-hand corner, then the top right-hand corner, next followed by the bottom left-hand corner and finally the bottom right-hand corner. Example : CKC code for the character \\"的\\" is 0760 2\\\\. When there are more than 1 way to encode, use one which covers more strokes of the character. Example : the CKC code for the character \\"綜 \\" is 2399 as opposed to 2393. 3\\\\. Encode each of the shapes ONCE only. Example : the CKC code for the character \\"香\\" is 06 as opposed to 0066. 4\\\\.

Specifically, it is an invariant of an oriented knot or link which assigns to each oriented knot or link a Laurent polynomial in the variable t^{1/2} with integer coefficients. Definition by the bracket Type I Reidemeister move Suppose we have an oriented link L, given as a knot diagram. We will define the Jones polynomial, V(L), using Louis Kauffman's bracket polynomial, which we denote by \\\\langle~\\\\rangle. Here the bracket polynomial is a Laurent polynomial in the variable A with integer coefficients. First, we define the auxiliary polynomial (also known as the normalized bracket polynomial) :X(L) = (-A^3)^{-w(L)}\\\\langle L \\\\rangle, where w(L) denotes the writhe of L in its given diagram. The writhe of a diagram is the number of positive crossings (L_{+} in the figure below) minus the number of negative crossings (L_{-}). The writhe is not a knot invariant. X(L) is a knot invariant since it is invariant under changes of the diagram of L by the three Reidemeister moves. Invariance under type II and III Reidemeister moves follows from invariance of the bracket under those moves. The bracket polynomial is known to change by multiplication by -A^{\\\\pm 3} under a type I Reidemeister move. The definition of the X polynomial given above is designed to nullify this change, since the writhe changes appropriately by +1 or -1 under type I moves. Now make the substitution A = t^{-1/4} in X(L) to get the Jones polynomial V(L). This results in a Laurent polynomial with integer coefficients in the variable t^{1/2}. Jones polynomial for tangles This construction of the Jones polynomial for tangles is a simple generalization of the Kauffman bracket of a link. The construction was developed by Vladimir Turaev and published in 1990. Let k be a non-negative integer and S_k denote the set of all isotopic types of tangle diagrams, with 2k ends, having no crossing points and no closed components (smoothings). Turaev's construction makes use of the previous construction for the Kauffman bracket and associates to each 2k-end oriented tangle an element of the free \\\\mathrm{R}-module \\\\mathrm{R}[S_k], where \\\\mathrm{R} is the ring of Laurent polynomials with integer coefficients in the variable t^{1/2}. Definition by braid representation Jones' original formulation of his polynomial came from his study of operator algebras. In Jones' approach, it resulted from a kind of \\"trace\\" of a particular braid representation into an algebra which originally arose while studying certain models, e.g. the Potts model, in statistical mechanics. Let a link L be given. A theorem of Alexander states that it is the trace closure of a braid, say with n strands. Now define a representation \\\\rho of the braid group on n strands, Bn, into the Temperley–Lieb algebra \\\\operatorname{TL}_n with coefficients in \\\\Z [A, A^{-1}] and \\\\delta = -A^2 - A^{-2}. The standard braid generator \\\\sigma_i is sent to A\\\\cdot e_i + A^{-1}\\\\cdot 1, where 1, e_1, \\\\dots, e_{n-1} are the standard generators of the Temperley–Lieb algebra. It can be checked easily that this defines a representation. Take the braid word \\\\sigma obtained previously from L and compute \\\\delta^{n-1} \\\\operatorname{tr} \\\\rho(\\\\sigma) where \\\\operatorname{tr} is the Markov trace. This gives \\\\langle L \\\\rangle, where \\\\langle \\\\rangle is the bracket polynomial. This can be seen by considering, as Louis Kauffman did, the Temperley–Lieb algebra as a particular diagram algebra. An advantage of this approach is that one can pick similar representations into other algebras, such as the R-matrix representations, leading to \\"generalized Jones invariants\\". Properties The Jones polynomial is characterized by taking the value 1 on any diagram of the unknot and satisfies the following skein relation: :: (t^{1/2} - t^{-1/2})V(L_0) = t^{-1}V(L_{+}) - tV(L_{-}) \\\\, where L_{+}, L_{-}, and L_{0} are three oriented link diagrams that are identical except in one small region where they differ by the crossing changes or smoothing shown in the figure below: 200px The definition of the Jones polynomial by the bracket makes it simple to show that for a knot K, the Jones polynomial of its mirror image is given by substitution of t^{-1} for t in V(K). Thus, an amphicheiral knot, a knot equivalent to its mirror image, has palindromic entries in its Jones polynomial. See the article on skein relation for an example of a computation using these relations. Another remarkable property of this invariant states that the Jones polynomial of an alternating link is an alternating polynomial. This property was proved by Morwen Thistlethwaite in 1987. Another proof of this last property is due to Hernando Burgos-Soto, who also gave an extension to tangles of the property.  Colored Jones polynomial  N colored Jones Polynomial: The N cables of L are parallel with each other along the knot L and each is colored a different color. For a positive integer N a N-colored Jones polynomial V_N(L,t) can be defined as the Jones polynomial for N cables of the knot L as depicted in the right figure. It is associated with an (N + 1)-dimensional irreducible representation of \\\\operatorname{SU}(2) . The label N stands for coloring. Like the ordinary Jones polynomial it can be defined by Skein relation and is a Laurent polynomial in one variable t . The N-colored Jones polynomial V_N(L,t) has the following properties: :*V_{X\\\\oplus Y}(L,t)=V_X(L,t)+V_Y(L,t) where X,Y are two representation space. :*V_{X\\\\otimes Y}(L,t) equals the Jones polynomial of the 2-cables of L with two components labeled by X and Y . So the N-colored Jones polynomial equals the original Jones polynomial of the N cables of L . :*The original Jones polynomial appears as a special case: V(L,t)=V_1(L,t) . Relationship to other theories Link with Chern–Simons theory As first shown by Edward Witten, the Jones polynomial of a given knot \\\\gamma can be obtained by considering Chern–Simons theory on the three-sphere with gauge group \\\\mathrm{SU}(2), and computing the vacuum expectation value of a Wilson loop W_F(\\\\gamma), associated to \\\\gamma, and the fundamental representation F of \\\\mathrm{SU}(2). Link with quantum knot invariants By substituting e^h the variable t of the Jones polynomial and expanding it as the series of h each of the coefficients turn to be the Vassiliev invariant of the knot K. In order to unify the Vassiliev invariants (or, finite type invariants), Maxim Kontsevich constructed the Kontsevich integral. The value of the Kontsevich integral, which is the infinite sum of 1, 3-valued chord diagrams, named the Jacobi chord diagrams, reproduces the Jones polynomial along with the \\\\mathfrak{sl}_2 weight system studied by Dror Bar-Natan. Link with the volume conjecture By numerical examinations on some hyperbolic knots, Rinat Kashaev discovered that substituting the n-th root of unity into the parameter of the colored Jones polynomial corresponding to the n-dimensional representation, and limiting it as n grows to infinity, the limit value would give the hyperbolic volume of the knot complement. (See Volume conjecture.) Link with Khovanov homology In 2000 Mikhail Khovanov constructed a certain chain complex for knots and links and showed that the homology induced from it is a knot invariant (see Khovanov homology). The Jones polynomial is described as the Euler characteristic for this homology. Open problems *Is there a nontrivial knot with Jones polynomial equal to that of the unknot? It is known that there are nontrivial links with Jones polynomial equal to that of the corresponding unlinks by the work of Morwen Thistlethwaite. ;Problem（Extension of Jones polynomial to general 3-manifolds） \`\`The original Jones polynomial was defined for 1-links in the 3-sphere (the 3-ball, the 3-space \\\\R^3). Can you define the Jones polynomial for 1-links in any 3-manifold?’’ Such an approach was proposed by Józef H. Przytycki under the name of skein modules. In particular, the Kauffman bracket skein module and HOMFLYPT skein module. See section 1.1 of this paper for the background and the history of this problem. Kauffman submitted a solution in the case of the product manifold of closed oriented surface and the closed interval, by introducing virtual 1-knots. It is open in the other cases. Witten’s path integral for the Jones polynomial is written formally for links in any compact 3-manifold, but the calculus is not done even at the physics level in any other case than the 3-sphere (the 3-ball, or the 3-space \\\\R^3). This problem is also open at the physics level. In the case of the Alexander polynomial, this problem is solved.

James Waddell Alexander II discovered this, the first knot polynomial, in 1923. In 1969, John Conway showed a version of this polynomial, now called the Alexander–Conway polynomial, could be computed using a skein relation, although its significance was not realized until the discovery of the Jones polynomial in 1984. Soon after Conway's reworking of the Alexander polynomial, it was realized that a similar skein relation was exhibited in Alexander's paper on his polynomial.Alexander describes his skein relation toward the end of his paper under the heading \\"miscellaneous theorems\\", which is possibly why it got lost. Joan Birman mentions in her paper New points of view in knot theory (Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. (N.S.) 28 (1993), no. 2, 253–287) that Mark Kidwell brought her attention to Alexander's relation in 1970. Definition Let K be a knot in the 3-sphere. Let X be the infinite cyclic cover of the knot complement of K. This covering can be obtained by cutting the knot complement along a Seifert surface of K and gluing together infinitely many copies of the resulting manifold with boundary in a cyclic manner. There is a covering transformation t acting on X. Consider the first homology (with integer coefficients) of X, denoted H_1(X). The transformation t acts on the homology and so we can consider H_1(X) a module over the ring of Laurent polynomials \\\\mathbb{Z}[t, t^{-1}]. This is called the Alexander invariant or Alexander module. The module is finitely presentable; a presentation matrix for this module is called the Alexander matrix. If the number of generators, r, is less than or equal to the number of relations, s, then we consider the ideal generated by all r by r minors of the matrix; this is the zero'th Fitting ideal or Alexander ideal and does not depend on choice of presentation matrix. If r > s, set the ideal equal to 0. If the Alexander ideal is principal, take a generator; this is called an Alexander polynomial of the knot. Since this is only unique up to multiplication by the Laurent monomial \\\\pm t^n, one often fixes a particular unique form. Alexander's choice of normalization is to make the polynomial have a positive constant term. Alexander proved that the Alexander ideal is nonzero and always principal. Thus an Alexander polynomial always exists, and is clearly a knot invariant, denoted \\\\Delta_K(t). The Alexander polynomial for the knot configured by only one string is a polynomial of t2 and then it is the same polynomial for the mirror image knot. Namely, it cannot distinguish between the knot and one for its mirror image. Computing the polynomial The following procedure for computing the Alexander polynomial was given by J. W. Alexander in his paper. Take an oriented diagram of the knot with n crossings; there are n + 2 regions of the knot diagram. To work out the Alexander polynomial, first one must create an incidence matrix of size (n, n + 2). The n rows correspond to the n crossings, and the n + 2 columns to the regions. The values for the matrix entries are either 0, 1, −1, t, −t. Consider the entry corresponding to a particular region and crossing. If the region is not adjacent to the crossing, the entry is 0. If the region is adjacent to the crossing, the entry depends on its location. The following table gives the entry, determined by the location of the region at the crossing from the perspective of the incoming undercrossing line. : on the left before undercrossing: −t : on the right before undercrossing: 1 : on the left after undercrossing: t : on the right after undercrossing: −1 Remove two columns corresponding to adjacent regions from the matrix, and work out the determinant of the new n by n matrix. Depending on the columns removed, the answer will differ by multiplication by \\\\pm t^n, where the power of n is not necessarily the number of crossings in the knot. To resolve this ambiguity, divide out the largest possible power of t and multiply by −1 if necessary, so that the constant term is positive. This gives the Alexander polynomial. The Alexander polynomial can also be computed from the Seifert matrix. After the work of J. W. Alexander, Ralph Fox considered a copresentation of the knot group \\\\pi_1(S^3\\\\backslash K), and introduced non-commutative differential calculus , which also permits one to compute \\\\Delta_K(t). Detailed exposition of this approach about higher Alexander polynomials can be found in the book . Basic properties of the polynomial The Alexander polynomial is symmetric: \\\\Delta_K(t^{-1}) = \\\\Delta_K(t) for all knots K. : From the point of view of the definition, this is an expression of the Poincaré Duality isomorphism \\\\overline{H_1 X} \\\\simeq \\\\mathrm{Hom}_{\\\\mathbb Z[t,t^{-1}]}(H_1 X, G) where G is the quotient of the field of fractions of \\\\mathbb Z[t,t^{-1}] by \\\\mathbb Z[t,t^{-1}], considered as a \\\\mathbb Z[t,t^{-1}]-module, and where \\\\overline{H_1 X} is the conjugate \\\\mathbb Z[t,t^{-1}]-module to H_1 X ie: as an abelian group it is identical to H_1 X but the covering transformation t acts by t^{-1}. Furthermore, the Alexander polynomial evaluates to a unit on 1: \\\\Delta_K(1)=\\\\pm 1. : From the point of view of the definition, this is an expression of the fact that the knot complement is a homology circle, generated by the covering transformation t. More generally if M is a 3-manifold such that rank(H_1 M) = 1 it has an Alexander polynomial \\\\Delta_M(t) defined as the order ideal of its infinite- cyclic covering space. In this case \\\\Delta_M(1) is, up to sign, equal to the order of the torsion subgroup of H_1 M. It is known that every integral Laurent polynomial which is both symmetric and evaluates to a unit at 1 is the Alexander polynomial of a knot (Kawauchi 1996). Geometric significance of the polynomial Since the Alexander ideal is principal, \\\\Delta_K(t)=1 if and only if the commutator subgroup of the knot group is perfect (i.e. equal to its own commutator subgroup). For a topologically slice knot, the Alexander polynomial satisfies the Fox–Milnor condition \\\\Delta_K(t) = f(t)f(t^{-1}) where f(t) is some other integral Laurent polynomial. Twice the knot genus is bounded below by the degree of the Alexander polynomial. Michael Freedman proved that a knot in the 3-sphere is topologically slice; i.e., bounds a \\"locally-flat\\" topological disc in the 4-ball, if the Alexander polynomial of the knot is trivial (Freedman and Quinn, 1990). describes the first construction of the Alexander polynomial via state sums derived from physical models. A survey of these topic and other connections with physics are given in . There are other relations with surfaces and smooth 4-dimensional topology. For example, under certain assumptions, there is a way of modifying a smooth 4-manifold by performing a surgery that consists of removing a neighborhood of a two-dimensional torus and replacing it with a knot complement crossed with S1. The result is a smooth 4-manifold homeomorphic to the original, though now the Seiberg–Witten invariant has been modified by multiplication with the Alexander polynomial of the knot. Knots with symmetries are known to have restricted Alexander polynomials. See the symmetry section in (Kawauchi 1996). Nonetheless, the Alexander polynomial can fail to detect some symmetries, such as strong invertibility. If the knot complement fibers over the circle, then the Alexander polynomial of the knot is known to be monic (the coefficients of the highest and lowest order terms are equal to \\\\pm 1). In fact, if S \\\\to C_K \\\\to S^1 is a fiber bundle where C_K is the knot complement, let g : S \\\\to S represent the monodromy, then \\\\Delta_K(t) = {\\\\rm Det}(tI-g_*) where g_*\\\\colon H_1 S \\\\to H_1 S is the induced map on homology. Relations to satellite operations If a knot K is a satellite knot with pattern knot K' (there exists an embedding f : S^1 \\\\times D^2 \\\\to S^3 such that K=f(K'), where S^1 \\\\times D^2 \\\\subset S^3 is an unknotted solid torus containing K'), then \\\\Delta_K(t) = \\\\Delta_{f(S^1 \\\\times \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\})}(t^a) \\\\Delta_{K'}(t), where a \\\\in \\\\mathbb Z is the integer that represents K' \\\\subset S^1 \\\\times D^2 in H_1(S^1\\\\times D^2) = \\\\mathbb Z. Examples: For a connect-sum \\\\Delta_{K_1 \\\\\\\\# K_2}(t) = \\\\Delta_{K_1}(t) \\\\Delta_{K_2}(t). If K is an untwisted Whitehead double, then \\\\Delta_K(t)=\\\\pm 1. Alexander–Conway polynomial Alexander proved the Alexander polynomial satisfies a skein relation. John Conway later rediscovered this in a different form and showed that the skein relation together with a choice of value on the unknot was enough to determine the polynomial. Conway's version is a polynomial in z with integer coefficients, denoted abla(z) and called the Alexander–Conway polynomial (also known as Conway polynomial or Conway–Alexander polynomial). Suppose we are given an oriented link diagram, where L_+, L_-, L_0 are link diagrams resulting from crossing and smoothing changes on a local region of a specified crossing of the diagram, as indicated in the figure. center Here are Conway's skein relations: * abla(O) = 1 (where O is any diagram of the unknot) * abla(L_+) - abla(L_-) = z abla(L_0) The relationship to the standard Alexander polynomial is given by \\\\Delta_L(t^2) = abla_L(t - t^{-1}). Here \\\\Delta_L must be properly normalized (by multiplication of \\\\pm t^{n/2}) to satisfy the skein relation \\\\Delta(L_+) - \\\\Delta(L_-) = (t^{1/2} - t^{-1/2}) \\\\Delta(L_0). Note that this relation gives a Laurent polynomial in t1/2. See knot theory for an example computing the Conway polynomial of the trefoil. Relation to Floer homology Using pseudo-holomorphic curves, and associated a bigraded abelian group, called knot Floer homology, to each isotopy class of knots. The graded Euler characteristic of knot Floer homology is the Alexander polynomial. While the Alexander polynomial gives a lower bound on the genus of a knot, showed that knot Floer homology detects the genus. Similarly, while the Alexander polynomial gives an obstruction to a knot complement fibering over the circle, showed that knot Floer homology completely determines when a knot complement fibers over the circle. The knot Floer homology groups are part of the Heegaard Floer homology family of invariants; see Floer homology for further discussion.

Rookwood was born into a wealthy family of Catholic recusants, and educated by Jesuits in Flanders. His older brother became a Franciscan, and his two younger brothers were ordained as Catholic priests. Rookwood became a horse-breeder. He married the Catholic Elizabeth Tyrwhitt, and had at least two sons. He was enlisted into the plot in September 1605 by Robert Catesby, a religious zealot whose impatience with James' treatment of English Catholics had grown so severe that he conspired to blow up the House of Lords with gunpowder, killing the king and much of the Protestant hierarchy. With the other conspirators he had recruited, Catesby also planned to incite a rebellion in the Midlands, during which James's nine-year-old daughter Princess Elizabeth would be captured, and installed as titular queen. Rookwood's stable of fine horses was essential for the uprising to succeed. The explosion was planned to coincide with the State Opening of Parliament on 5 November 1605, but the man left in charge of the gunpowder stored beneath the House of Lords, Guy Fawkes, was discovered there and arrested. Rookwood fled the city, and informed Catesby and the others of the plan's failure. Together the remaining conspirators rode to Holbeche House in Staffordshire, where on 8 November they were attacked by the pursuing Sheriff of Worcester and his men. Catesby was killed, but Rookwood survived, and was imprisoned in the Tower of London. Rookwood and the survivors were arraigned on 27 January 1606 in Westminster Hall. Pleading not guilty, he claimed to have loved Catesby \\"above any worldly man\\". He was convicted; his request for mercy was ignored, and he was hanged, drawn and quartered on 31 January, in the Old Palace Yard at Westminster. Early life Born sometime about 1578, Ambrose Rookwood was the second of four sons born to Robert Rookwood and his second wife, Dorothy Drury, the daughter of Sir William Drury and Elizabeth Sothill. During his first marriage to Bridget Kemp, Robert had sired four sons, but all predeceased their father.. The Rookwood family had lived at Stanningfield in Suffolk for 300 years. Wealthy, and staunch Catholics, the authorities viewed them as trouble-makers. Ambrose's Papist cousin Edward had spent ten years in prison for his faith, but in 1578 he entertained Queen Elizabeth I at his home, Euston Hall. It was an expensive visit that made a serious dent in the family's finances, and which neutered their influence for years thereafter. Ambrose's parents had been imprisoned for their recusancy, and he was indicted on the same charge in February 1605. He was apparently happy to advertise his faith; in the summer of 1605 he commissioned a London cutler, John Craddock, to place a Spanish blade into a sword hilt engraved with the story of the Passion of Christ. As such weapons were generally worn in public, it was \\"a potentially dangerous statement of faith\\". Ambrose and two of his brothers, Robert and Christopher, were educated by Jesuits at Saint-Omer, then in Flanders. Both brothers became priests (Ambrose's elder brother, Henry, became a Franciscan), and his half-sisters Dorothea and Susanna became nuns. According to the Jesuit Oswald Tesimond, Rookwood was \\"well-built and handsome, if somewhat short\\", which he compensated for by his taste in extravagant clothing. In author Antonia Fraser's opinion, this affectation was somewhat inappropriate at a time when \\"clothes were supposed to denote rank rather than money\\". Marriage, inheritance, and first treason In or shortly before 1599 he married Elizabeth, daughter of William Tyrwhitt, of Kettleby in Lincolnshire, and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Peter Frescheville, of Staveley in Derbyshire. The Tyrwhitts were another prominent Roman Catholic family and his wife was possibly a first cousin to his future fellow conspirator Robert Keyes. The couple had two sons, Robert and Henry. On his father's death in 1600, he inherited Coldham Hall, which subsequently became a refuge for priests. The following year he joined the Earl of Essex's abortive rebellion against the government, for which he was captured and held at Newgate Prison. Enlisted In August 1605 Rookwood joined the Jesuits Henry Garnet and John Gerard on a pilgrimage to the shrine of St Winefride's Well in Holywell. Late in September, he was approached by Robert Catesby, Thomas Wintour and John Wright, and invited to join what became known as the Gunpowder Plot. English Catholics had hoped that the persecution of their faith would end when James I came to the throne, as his attitude appeared to be moderate, even tolerant towards Catholics. In Catesby's view, James had reneged on his promises. He therefore planned to kill the king by blowing up the House of Lords with gunpowder, and then inciting a popular revolt to install James's daughter, Elizabeth, as titular queen. To this end he had already helped enlist nine Catholics into the conspiracy, but was running out of money and needed to recruit more men. Rookwood was a horse-breeder, and his stable of fine mounts at Coldham Hall was needed for the Midlands uprising. He had been asked to supply them with gunpowder about a year earlier, under the pretence that it was for William Stanley's regiment in Flanders—no longer an illegal operation due to the recent Treaty of London—but otherwise provided no funds for the conspiracy. Although unverifiable, his wife's relationship to Robert Keyes may mean that Rookwood already suspected that something was being planned. He was at first concerned for the welfare of the Catholic lords who would be present at the explosion, but his compunction was alleviated when Catesby promised him that they would be tricked out of attending Parliament that day. Any lingering doubts Rookwood had were removed by Catesby's lie that the Jesuits had given the scheme their approval. Rookwood had stayed with the Wintours at Huddington Court, and that month with the Catholic Lacons at Kinlet Hall, but at Cateby's behest he rented Clopton House near Stratford, and moved there after Michaelmas. He took with him several Catholic religious symbols, such as chalices, crucifixes, vestments, Latin books and praying beads. These were concealed in a cellar built by the Jesuit Nicholas Owen. Coldham Hall Toward the end of October he joined Keyes at his lodgings in London. A few days before the planned explosion he changed his mind about the sword he had ordered John Craddock to make, and had the cutler replace the grip with a gold one. The modified sword, which in total probably cost Rookwood more than £20, was delivered on 4 November. Discovery The existence of the plot had been revealed in an anonymous letter delivered ten days earlier to William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, warning him to keep away from Parliament. On the evening of 4 November the authorities made a search of the House of Lords, where they discovered one of the plotters, Guy Fawkes, guarding a hoard of explosives. He was immediately arrested. Fawkes had posed as a servant of fellow plotter Thomas Percy, and it was therefore Percy's name that appeared on the first arrest warrant issued by the government. News of Fawkes's capture soon spread through London, prompting Christopher Wright (brother of John) to rush to Thomas Wintour, and tell what had happened. Wintour guessed that the government was looking for Percy, and told Wright to travel to Percy's lodgings and \\"bid him begone\\". While Wintour lingered, Christopher Wright and Percy left the city, followed by Keyes, and then Rookwood. A renowned horseman, Rookwood covered 30 miles in two hours on a single horse. Using various steeds he had left along the route, he passed Keyes at Highgate, and then Wright and Percy at Little Brickhill near Dunstable. He caught up with Catesby, who had left the previous day to prepare the uprising, and told him what had happened in London. The group, which now included Catesby, his servant Thomas Bates, both Wright brothers, Percy and Rookwood, rode on to Dunchurch. While Fawkes was being tortured, on 6 November the government began to round up anyone they thought might be involved. Rookwood's servants, still in the house their master had so hastily departed, were questioned on the same day. His belongings at Clopton—including several incriminating Catholic symbols—were also taken, and by the time the plotters had reached Catesby's family home at Ashby St Ledgers, Rookwood's name was among the list of suspects drawn up by the Lord Chief Justice. The fugitives continued on to Dunchurch, where they met the recently recruited conspirator Everard Digby, with his hunting party. The next day the group stole horses from Warwick Castle, although with his fine cortège, Rookwood avoided the town. They then collected stored weapons from Norbrook, and continued on to Huddington. The party tried in vain to expand their number, but were shunned; no one was prepared to risk being labelled a traitor. Father Garnet, contacted at Coughton Court by Bates, wrote Catesby a letter in which he implored the group to stop their \\"wicked actions\\", before himself fleeing. Fugitive Rookwood was proclaimed a wanted man on 7 November. He went to confession and with the rest of the group took the sacrament—in Fraser's opinion, a sign that none of them thought they had long to live. Through pouring rain they rode to Hewell Grange, helping themselves to further arms, ammunition and money, and finally reached Holbeche House, on the border of Staffordshire, at about 10:00 pm that night. Tired from three days of riding, they spread in front of the fire some of the now-soaked gunpowder taken from Hewell Grange, to dry out. A stray spark landed on the powder, and Rookwood, Catesby, John Grant and another man were caught up in the resultant conflagration. Rookwood and Catesby were described as \\"reasonably well\\", but Grant was blinded. Several of the conspirators disappeared into the night, but Rookwood, Catesby, the Wright brothers, Percy and Grant stayed on. By 11:00 am the next day the house was surrounded by 200 of the Sheriff of Worcester's men. In the ensuing battle, Wintour was shot in the shoulder. John and Christopher Wright were killed. Catesby and Percy were reportedly both killed by a single musket ball. Rookwood was also shot, but survived and was quickly captured. His belongings should by right have been seized by the government, but his elaborate sword apparently proved to be too great a temptation for the Sheriff's men, and disappeared without trace. Rookwood and the others were taken first to Worcester, and then to the Tower of London. Those conspirators still at large were rounded up shortly after. Trial and execution Watched in secret by the king and his family, the surviving conspirators were arraigned in Westminster Hall on 27 January 1606. Some of the prisoners hung their heads \\"as if their hearts were full of doggedness\\", while others were nonchalant. All except Digby pleaded \\"Not Guilty\\". Defending himself, Rookwood claimed that he had been enlisted into the plot through his friendship with Catesby, \\"whom he loved above any worldly man\\". He admitted that he could not expect mercy, but asked for it anyway, so as not to leave a \\"blemish and blot unto all ages\\". His pleas were in vain. The jury convicted him, and he was sentenced to death. Three days later, Digby, Robert Wintour, John Grant and Thomas Bates were hanged, drawn and quartered at the western end of St Paul's churchyard. The following day, Rookwood, Thomas Wintour, Robert Keyes and Guy Fawkes were tied to wattled hurdles and dragged by horse from the Tower, to the Old Palace Yard at Westminster—a longer route than had been suffered by their fellow conspirators. Rookwood had asked to be informed when he passed by his lodgings in the Strand, so that he could open his eyes and see his wife, waiting at the window. He shouted \\"Pray for me, pray for me!\\" According to Father Gerard (who was not then present), Elizabeth answered, \\"I will, and be of good courage. Offer theyself wholly to God. I, for my part, do as freely restore thee to God as He gave thee unto me.\\" For the rest of the journey he kept his eyes closed, in prayer. Thomas Wintour was the first that day to be hanged and then killed. Rookwood was next, and made a short speech to the assembled audience. He was repentant, asking God to bless the king, queen, and their \\"royal progeny\\", but \\"spoil[ed] all the pottage with one filthy weed\\" by beseeching God to make the king a Catholic. He seems to have been left to hang for longer than the others, before suffering the remainder of his sentence.

On 1 January 2005, it merged with Rand Afrikaans University and the Soweto and East Rand campuses of Vista University to form the University of Johannesburg. The former Vista University East Rand Campus has subsequently been permanently closed. Origins Technikon Witwatersrand traces its roots back to the beginning of the 20th century to the Transvaal Technical Institute, which was established in 1903 to serve the needs of the gold-mining industry. For the greater part of its existence, it was housed in a temporary wood and corrugated iron structure, affectionately known as the Tin Temple, on the corner of Rissik and Plein streets in central Johannesburg. The Institute grew and developed, and in time gave rise to the Universities of the Witwatersrand and Pretoria. In 1923, an Act of Parliament made provision for technical training, which led to the establishment of the Witwatersrand Technical Institute in 1925. This was the founding date of the Technikon Witwatersrand. The Witwatersrand Technical Institute underwent a series of changes: it became the Witwatersrand Technical College in 1930, the Witwatersrand College for Advanced Technical Education in 1968 and finally, the Technikon Witwatersrand in 1979. Today, it is a large and complex institution. Some 12,000 students and 1,200 staff members from all spheres of the city's multifaceted community make up a vibrant educational centre extending across the east–west axis of Johannesburg. The merger On 31 May 2002, the Minister of Education, Kader Asmal, released the government's proposals for the restructuring of higher education in South Africa. Mergers between various educational institutions in South Africa were then proposed as necessary to the restructuring process. Rand Afrikaans University and Technikon Witwatersrand were two of the institutions that were selected to merge with each other and are to become one comprehensive institution. Officially, the Technikon Witwatersrand and Rand Afrikaans University merged on 1 January 2005 to form a new institution by the name of the University of Johannesburg. The new institution offers both academic and technology degrees. The final meetings and preparations took place in 2004 so as to ensure that all structures were in place and that everything ran smoothly when the University of Johannesburg opened in 2005.

Ritsumeikan APU was established in April of 2000 in Beppu, Ōita, Japan. APU was created through the collaboration of three parties from the public and private sectors: Ōita Prefecture, Beppu City and the Ritsumeikan Trust. The university has an enrollment of about 5,850, including approximately 2,900 domestic, and 2,900 international students (a 50-50 domestic-international ratio) originating from 90 countries and regions. Half of the 172 full-time faculty members are also foreign nationals who come from more than 30 countries and regions. Location The Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University is located in Beppu, Ōita, on the island of Kyushu in southern Japan. Background Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University is a member of the Ritsumeikan Trust which includes APU, Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto and Lake Biwa and primary, junior and senior high schools throughout Japan. In the early 1990s the concept of creating an international university in the city of Beppu was first raised by the governor of Ōita Prefecture, Morihiko Hiramatsu, with the then chancellor of the Ritsumeikan Trust in Kyoto, Mr Kawamoto. A chief proponent of the concept and design was Professor Makitaro Hotta. The university opened at Jumonjibaru, north of Beppu City in April 2000. Campus features Programs There are two four-month semesters in one academic year. One semester is divided into two quarters lasting for seven weeks. Most of the classes in APU are carried out on a quarter system.Student Handbook 2011 Unlike many other universities, students are accepted for enrollment and graduate twice a year, in spring and fall. APU offers undergraduate studies in subjects including liberal arts such as media studies, language subjects, and Japanese traditional arts. It offers special lecture subjects, which are added to and may change every semester. Students select their own classes and are not restricted to classes in their majors. However, students can only choose classes in their respective curriculum according to their enrollment year, for the curriculum has undergone changes three times since the university was founded. The current undergraduate programs are conducted in the College of International Management and College of Asia Pacific Studies. The College of International Management (APM) consists of four areas of study: Accounting and Finance (会計・ファイナンス), Marketing (マーケティンク), Strategic Management and Organization (経営戦略と組織), Innovation and Economics (イノベーション・経済学). The College of Asia Pacific Studies (APS) has also established four areas of study: Environment & Development (環境・開発), Hospitality & Tourism (観光学), International Relations & Peace Studies (国際関係), Culture, Society & Media (文化・社会・メディア).2012 Undergraduate Academic Handbook Furthermore, students must complete compulsory language education credits in either English or Japanese. Specialized post- graduate programs are conducted in the Graduate School of Asia Pacific Studies and Graduate School of Management. The graduate programs are conducted exclusively in English. Enrollment As of 1 November 2016 the university has a total enrollment of around 5,850 students, down from the 2009 figure of 6,162. Currently there are 5,553 students in undergraduate programs, 178 at postgraduate level, and 117 non-degree students.http://en.apu.ac.jp/home/about/content55/ Accessed 2017-03-07 The students are equally distributed between APU's two schools, the College of Asia Pacific Studies (2,786), and the College of International Management (2,731). While 2,904 of these students are domestic Japanese, 2,944 (about 50.3%) are international students from 90 countries and regions. This ratio is a feature unique to APU amongst Japanese universities; APU is second only to Waseda University in the absolute number of international students enrolled. In terms of country of origin, the majority of international students come from eastern Asia, namely South Korea (499 as of 1 November 2016), Vietnam (476), China (437), Indonesia (346), Thailand (281), and Bangladesh (87).http://en.apu.ac.jp/home/about/content57/ Accessed 2016-03-07 Facilities Ritsumeikan Asia-Pacific University, Campus View, January 2012 The library provides paper-based as well as electronic media including, academic databases, magazines, newspaper, textbooks, and DVD. Visitors can request media from other Ritsumeikan campuses which will be delivered to the library counter. Recently the library has included other services such as a writing center and meeting spaces for collaborative work. APU has designated smoking areas around campus and near the student dormitories. The rest of the university is smoke-free. As of 2013, APU will implement a new regulation that aims to make the entire university campus a smoke-free environment. Intercultural awareness APU has regular country cultural weeks, which help students to learn more about foreign cultures, for example, Vietnamese Week, Chinese Week, Indian Week, Korean Week, Indonesian Week, Nepali Week, Bangladeshi Week, Taiwanese Week, Sri Lanka Week, Thai Week, Myanmar Week, and Cambodian Week. Extracurricular activities There are over 100 student organizations (known as clubs or circles) available at APU, which cover categories of sports, academic research, arts, and social organizations (such as volunteers). Students are free to join clubs they are interested in, and they can create new ones, too. Examples of student organizations include APU Yosshakoi (Japanese traditional dance group), PRENGO (volunteer group), APU Wind Orchestra, Muay Thai (Thai boxing), and Global Business Leader. Since 2015, APU has also been host to the Global Business Case Competition. On- campus housing The on-campus housing, AP House, offers international students the opportunity to live next to the campus for their first year as they learn the ways and customs of life in Japan. Single and shared rooms are available. AP house provides shared facilities and borrowable items to the residents.http://www.apu.ac.jp/home/life/index.php?content_id=1 Support faculty and staff members are on site, in addition to resident assistants (RA) recruited from the resident student body.

Although he was raised in a Protestant household, and married a Protestant, Digby and his wife were converted to Catholicism by the Jesuit priest John Gerard. In the autumn of 1605, he was part of a Catholic pilgrimage to the shrine of St Winefride's Well in Holywell. About this time he met Robert Catesby, a religious fanatic who planned to blow up the House of Lords with gunpowder, killing James I. Catesby then planned to incite a popular revolt, during which a Catholic monarch would be restored to the English throne. The full extent of Digby's knowledge of and involvement in the plot is unknown, but at Catesby's behest Digby rented Coughton Court and prepared a \\"hunting party\\", ready for the planned uprising. The plot failed, however, and Digby joined the conspirators as they took flight through the Midlands, failing to garner support along their way. Digby left the other fugitives at Holbeche House in Staffordshire, and was soon captured and taken to the Tower of London. Digby was tried on 27 January 1606. Despite an eloquent defence, he was found guilty of high treason, and three days later was hanged, drawn and quartered. Origins The Digby family was of Leicestershire origin.'Tilton', in J. Nichols, The History and Antiquities of the County of Leicestershire 4 volumes in 8 (J. Nichols, London 1795-1811/Reprint by S.R. Publishers, Limited with Leicestershire County Council, 1971), III Part 1: East Goscote (1800), p. 462 ff. (Hathi Trust). Sir John Digby (d. 1269) served on two crusades, and by 1418 Sir Everard \\"Greenleaf\\" Digby was Lord of Tilton and owner of the manor at Drystoke (Stoke Dry), and Rutland's member of Parliament. Sir Everard lost his life (and his family much of their fortune) fighting in 1461 for Henry VI against Edward IV. The family had a more positive reversal of fortune in 1485 when Sir Everard's sons fought for the victorious Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth Field. Early life Everard Digby was the eldest son of Everard Digby, Esquire (who died in 1592) and his wife Maria (née Neale), daughter of Francis Neale of Keythorpe in Leicestershire.S. Erdeswicke (ed. T. Harwood), A Survey of Staffordshire (1820), pp. xxxiii-xxxv: Inscription at p. xxxv (Internet Archive). The conspirator was a cousin of Anne Vaux, who for years placed herself at considerable risk by sheltering Jesuit priests such as Henry Garnet. He was probably a near kinsman of the 16th-century scholar Everard Digby, but it is clear that the scholar, who died in 1605,N. Orme, 'Digby, Everard (d. 1605), Church of England clergyman and author', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (OUP 2004), online was not his father, because as a Fellow of St John's College, Cambridge (a celibate calling) he could not have been married at the time when the young Everard and some of his 13 siblings were born, nor was he \\"Esquire\\", as the father is named in his inquisition post mortem of 1592.S.L. Lee, 'Digby, Everard (fl. 1590), divine and author', Dictionary of National Biography (1885-1900), Vol. 15. In 1596, while still a teenager, he married Mary Mulshaw (or Mushlo), a young heiress who brought with her Gayhurst House in Buckinghamshire. By all accounts their marriage was a happy one, and they had two sons; Kenelm Digby was born in 1603 at Gayhurst, and John in 1605. Unlike other English Catholics, Digby had little first-hand experience of England's recusancy laws. Following the death of his father he had been made a ward of Chancery and was raised in a Protestant household. His wife Mary was converted to Catholicism by the Jesuit priest John Gerard. When Digby fell seriously ill, Gerard used the occasion to convert him also, and the two subsequently became close friends, \\"calling eachother 'brother' when we wrote and spoke\\". Gerard was godfather to Digby's eldest son, Kenelm, and the Digbys also built a hidden chapel and sacristy at Gayhurst. Digby frequented the court of Elizabeth I, and became informally associated with the Elizabethan gentlemen pensioners. His marriage had significantly expanded his holdings, however, and possibly for this reason he left court to manage his estates. He was apparently an unforgiving landlord, as his tenants in Tilton petitioned the Crown for redress when he failed to honour the expensive leases granted them by his father. He added to his property in Buckinghamshire by buying land in Great Missenden, and a month after the queen's death his social station was elevated when on 24 April 1603 he was knighted by James I at Belvoir Castle. Four days later he was present for Elizabeth's funeral in London. Robert Catesby In late August or early September 1605, Digby, his wife Mary, and their secret Jesuit chaplain Edward Oldcorne joined a pilgrimage organised by, amongst others, Henry Garnet and Anne Vaux. The party had set out from White Webbs at Enfield Chase, heading for the shrine of St Winefride's Well at Holywell, and had occasionally stopped along the way to collect more followers. As the thirty or so pilgrims returned from Holywell in mid-September, they stopped at Rushton Hall where Sir Thomas Tresham had recently died, and then continued on to Digby's seat at Gayhurst. On 21 October Digby, his wife Mary, Garnet and Vaux were at Harrowden celebrating a delayed Feast of St Luke. While there he met Robert Catesby, who at some point asked him to swear an oath of secrecy before introducing him to what later became known as the Gunpowder Plot. English Catholics had hoped that the years of persecution they suffered during Elizabeth's reign would end when James I came to the throne, as his attitude appeared moderate, even tolerant towards Catholics. In Catesby's view, however, James had reneged on his promises, and he had quickly lost patience with the new dynasty. He therefore planned to kill James by blowing up the House of Lords with gunpowder, and then inciting a popular revolt during which a Catholic monarch would be restored to the throne. Catesby had enlisted the aid of other Catholics, but had borne much of the scheme's financial cost and was running out of money. The group had therefore agreed to expand their numbers. To this end Catesby had recruited Ambrose Rookwood—a young and wealthy Catholic with a stable of fine horses—and a wealthy cousin, Francis Tresham. The extent of Digby's knowledge of the plot is unknown, but in the opinion of author Alan Haynes, Digby was shocked by what he heard, and asked what would become of some of their Catholic friends. Catesby replied \\"Assure your selfe that such of the nobilitie as are worth the saving shalbe preserved and yet knowe not of the matter.\\" None of their friends would be caught in the explosion. He asked if Catesby had spoken of the matter with Garnet, or any other Jesuits; although Catesby was in no doubt that the Jesuits disapproved of any such action, he lied and said that he would not act without their approbation. Catesby then named the other conspirators, and promised Digby that as soon as they reached Gayhurst he would demonstrate that their religion allowed such acts of regicide, thus dissuading the young lord from confessing to Garnet and discovering the Jesuit's opinion of the matter. Catesby told him to rent Coughton Court from the head of the Throckmorton family, so that he would \\"the better to be able to do good to the cause [kidnap Princess Elizabeth]\\". From there, he was to organise a hunting party (in reality a group of armed men on horseback) and be ready for some kind of military manoeuvre. Digby also provided monetary assistance; he promised £1,500 after fellow plotter Thomas Percy failed to pay the rent due for several properties in Westminster. Hunting party Guy Fawkes House, formerly known as the Red Lion, where Digby was installed on 4 November 1605 On 2 November at Gayhurst, while making preparations for his hunting party, Digby was visited by Gerard. Having noticed that the house was almost completely empty, the Jesuit asked him if there was \\"any matter in hand\\" and if Garnet knew of it. Keen not to implicate Gerard, despite being told less than two weeks earlier that the plot had Jesuit approval, Digby told him that there was nothing he knew of \\"or could tell him of\\". Although Gerard later used this conversation to defend himself against those who accused him of involvement in the plot, he lived to regret not being given the opportunity to dissuade Digby from his course. Two days later Digby and his servants were ensconced at the Red Lion inn, in Dunchurch, where his hunt was to take place. He took with him several items of clothing, including \\"a white satin doublet cut with purple\\". Also present, but uninvolved, were his uncle, Sir Robert Digby, Humphrey Littleton and his nephew Stephen Littleton. They ate supper, before being joined by fellow conspirator John Grant and a friend. Also invited was the stepbrother of plotters Robert and Thomas Wintour, John Wintour. They attended a mass the next morning, conducted by a Father Hammond, before the party moved on. Around midnight on 4 November, Guy Fawkes was discovered guarding the gunpowder the plotters had placed beneath the House of Lords, and arrested. Those conspirators still in London soon took flight for the Midlands, finding along the way those who had already left to prepare for the planned uprising. They met Digby and his party at Dunchurch. Catesby told Digby that the king and Salisbury were dead, and \\"if true Catholics would now stir, he doubted not that they might procure to themselves good conditions\\". Digby was won over, but many of his party were less than impressed at being so badly deceived, and worse, being associated with treason. One of his servants asked Digby what would happen to them; Digby told him that although he was aware of their ignorance, \\"but now there is no remedy\\". Flight On 6 November the fugitives raided Warwick Castle and managed to secure more horses, before moving on to Norbrook to collect stored weapons. From there they continued their journey toward Huddington. Catesby ordered his servant (and fellow plotter) Thomas Bates to deliver a letter to Father Garnet at Coughton Court. Catesby and Digby asked Garnet to excuse their recklessness, before asking for his help in raising an army in Wales. Garnet's reply begged them to stop their \\"wicked actions\\", and to listen to the Pope's teachings. When the priest tried to comfort Mary Digby, also at Coughton Court, she burst into tears. With their ever-decreasing band of supporters, the remaining fugitives arrived at Huddington at about 2:00 pm. Any expectation they had of support began to vanish; almost everyone they met showed concern only for their own safety, fearful of being involved with traitors. The next morning they rode through the rain, stopping briefly to help themselves to supplies from the home of the absent Lord Windsor at Hewell Grange. Still the locals refused to have anything to do with them; Digby later admitted that \\"not one man\\" joined them. They arrived that night at Holbeche House on the border of Staffordshire, and tired and desperate, spread out some of the now-soaked gunpowder in front of the fire, to dry out. A spark from the fire landed on the powder and the resultant flames engulfed Catesby, Rookwood, Grant, and another man. Surrender Catesby and fellow conspirators Thomas Percy, John Wright and his brother Christopher were killed by the Sheriff of Worcester's men early on 8 November, but Digby had already left to give himself up (the only conspirator to do so). With two servants, possibly Bates and his son, he took several horses and hid in nearby woods. Their tracks were soon found, however, and with some hesitation (Digby had intended to surrender himself to someone more worthy), early that morning he presented himself to the most senior-looking of his adversaries. While Digby was taken to the Tower of London, Gayhurst was ransacked; the servants' belongings were stolen, the livestock was sold cheaply, and Mary Digby was left destitute. The sheriff later remarked \\"All goods are carried away, even to the very floor of the great parlour.\\" At the Tower, Digby's two trunks of clothing were searched, and found to contain £100 in gold, and £50 in white money. William Waad, Lieutenant of the Tower, asked if he could take £50 to pay for Digby's food and bedding. Digby unsuccessfully sought an audience with James to try and explain himself, in Fraser's opinion suggesting either that the extent of his involvement was limited, or that he was \\"astonishingly naive and trusting of his sovereign's forgiveness.\\" While imprisoned he busied himself with writing secret letters, smuggled from the Tower and not rediscovered until Kenelm Digby's death in 1665. Although he was fortunate not to suffer the fate of Guy Fawkes, who was tortured on several occasions, one of these letters hints that it had been \\"in a fashion, offered\\". He described his refusal to cooperate with his interrogators, boasted of his deceit, and how there was nothing he could do to make the plot appear less abhorrent to fellow Catholics. Digby also carved an inscription on the wall of his cell, extant as of 1996. Trial and execution Print of members of the Gunpowder Plot being hanged, drawn and quartered Digby was tried on the same day as seven of his surviving co- conspirators, in Westminster Hall, on Monday 27 January 1606. As the king and his family watched in secret, the charges against the plotters were read aloud. Alone amongst them Digby pleaded \\"Guilty\\", and was tried on a separate indictment. Dressed in a black satin suit and \\"tuff taffetie gown\\", he gave a short and moving speech, defending his actions by explaining his affection for Catesby, and the cause of his religion. He accused King James of reneging on his promises of toleration for Catholics, and told of his fears of harsher laws against recusancy. He also pleaded on behalf of his family, that they should not pay for his actions, before making a final request to be beheaded. His words fell on mostly deaf ears. The prosecution poured scorn on James's supposed perfidy, and ridiculed Digby for asking for leniency where he would have given none. Along with the other plotters, he was found guilty. As they were led from the hall, Digby exclaimed: \\"If I may but hear any of your lordships say, you forgive me, I shall go more cheerfully to the gallows.\\" The reply came back, \\"God forgive you, and we do.\\" He spent his last few days in the Tower writing letters to his wife and his sons, urging the two brothers to avoid the examples set by figures such as Cain and Abel. He also wrote poetry: :Who's that which knocks? Oh stay, my Lord, I come: :I know that call, since first it made me know :Myself, which makes me now with joy to run :Lest he be gone that can my duty show. ::Jesu, my Lord, I know thee by the Cross ::Thou offer'st me, but not unto my loss. Digby was hanged, drawn and quartered early on Thursday 30 January. Throngs of spectators lined the streets as he was strapped to a wattled hurdle, and alongside Robert Wintour and John Grant was dragged by horse to the western end of Old St Paul's Cathedral churchyard. Thomas Bates was delivered in a similar fashion, but from the Gatehouse Prison. Armed guards interspersed along the route were there to defend against any possible rescue, but did not keep the miscreants' families from witnessing the fate of the four men. Cold and grubby, Digby was the first of the four to face the executioner. He mounted the scaffold and addressed the audience, telling them that he knew he had broken the law, but that morally, and in the eyes of his religion, he had committed no offence. He asked for God's forgiveness, and the country's, and protested the Jesuits' and Father Gerard's innocence. He refused the attentions of a Protestant clergyman, speaking to himself in Latin, before saying goodbye to his friends. Digby was then stripped of his clothing, except for his shirt. Murmuring \\"O Jesus, Jesus, save me and keep me\\", he climbed the ladder and was hanged for a short period. The executioner cut the rope, and Digby fell back to the scaffold, wounding his forehead. Fully conscious, he was taken to the block and castrated, disembowelled, and quartered. Wintour, Grant and Bates followed. The remaining four conspirators suffered similar fates the following day, at the Old Palace Yard in Westminster.

Beginning as a television commentator with the BBC in 1971, he has commentated on over 2000 games on television and radio. From the late 1970s to 2008, Motson was the dominant football commentary figure at the BBC, apart from a brief spell in the 1990s, when his friend and rival Barry Davies was selected for two FA Cup final commentaries, the 1994 World Cup final and the UEFA Euro 1996 semi-final between England and Germany. In 2008, Motson announced his retirement from live television commentary. He continued to cover games for Match of the Day highlights and appeared on BBC Radio 5 Live as well as commentating on CBeebies' Footy Pups. In September 2017, he announced his full retirement from BBC commentary, having commentated on 10 FIFA World Cups, 10 UEFA European Championships and 29 FA Cup finals. In July 2018, he announced he was returning from retirement to work for Talksport.  Early years  The son of a Methodist minister, Motson was born in Salford, Lancashire, and educated at Culford School, near Bury St Edmunds. Culford is a public school where football was generally frowned upon at the time and rugby union, hockey and cricket are the major sports. In 1963, Motson's career began in the newspaper business as a reporter in Barnet. In 1967 and 1968 he worked for the Sheffield Morning TelegraphBoston United v Sheffield United programme, 11 December 1982, p5 where he first covered football.  Broadcasting career  Motson's broadcasting career took off when the BBC hired him in 1968 as a sports presenter on Radio 2. His first radio commentary was for a match between Everton and Derby in December 1969. Three years later, he gained a role with Match of the Day and became a regular commentator in the 1971–72 season., his first match was 0-0 draw between Liverpool vs Chelsea. On 5 February 1972, Motson covered the FA Cup Replay between Hereford United and Newcastle United for Match of the Day, which the BBC anticipated as a five-minute segment following their two main games. Non-league Hereford won the match 2–1 and it became the main featured game on the programme. Motson regards the Hereford United v Newcastle United match as his big break through. Through a bad winter, the game itself was a 3rd round FA Cup replay that had been postponed many times and was eventually rescheduled to be played on a 4th round FA cup day. Because of the potential for an upset, the BBC bosses decided the game should be bumped to the top of the billing on the BBC's Match of the Day program. Described as the FA Cup's greatest ever giant killing, Motson claims it was this FA Cup upset, and the story of the season that made his bosses at the BBC decide he could be trusted with more TV matches; consequentially Motson believed because of this game he was later given a three-year deal. Motson also believed if Ronnie Radford had never scored his famous goal he would never have had a TV commentary career. Motson's commentary on the Radford goal: Motson's first FA Cup Final as a commentator was for the 1977 match between Manchester United and Liverpool. Motson was drafted in as a late replacement for David Coleman, who was in a contractual dispute with the BBC. Motson's famous line from that game was \\"How fitting that a man called Buchan should be the first to climb the 39 steps\\", in a reference to the novel The Thirty-Nine Steps by Scottish author John Buchan; Martin Buchan was Manchester United captain and climbed the 39 steps to the Royal Box at Wembley to receive the FA Cup. Between 1979 and 2008 (except 1994 and 1995), Motson commentated on all the FA Cup finals that the BBC covered. In April 1989, Motson commentated on the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest when the Hillsborough disaster occurred. Motson found himself commentating on a tragedy rather than a football match, and he later appeared as part of the Hillsborough inquiry, since he had been a witness. Motson was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1996 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel during a charity cheque presentation at the Bayswater Families Centre in London. Motson featured alongside Mark Lawrenson as the primary commentator in EA's Euro 2000 video game. In 2001, speech therapist Jane Comins conducted a voice profile analysis to study the patterns of eight top television and radio commentators. The criteria included pitch, volume, rhythm and tone, and Comins found that Motson scored the best results. This was backed by 32% of football fans in a survey who voted him Britain's favourite commentator. This is despite Motson having a characteristic speech impediment – sibilant speech, in which he pronounces the \\"s\\" sound as \\"sh\\".Motty's Perfect Pitch BBC Sport When Premier League television highlights moved to ITV in 2001, and Match of the Day was no longer a weekly fixture in the schedules, Motson returned to radio on BBC Radio Five Live's coverage of the Premiership, but continued to make frequent appearances on live TV coverage and contributions to BBC Sport's website – which he has been doing since the site was launched in July 2000. In 2004, when the Premier League television rights returned to the BBC, Motson resumed his weekly place on Match of the Day, although he has also continued to perform occasional radio commentaries. In 2007, Motson appeared on the BBC Radio 4 biographical programme Great Lives and he nominated Brian Clough as his 'great life'.BBC – Radio 4 – Great Lives In 2008, following the BBC's loss of rights to cover live FA Cup football and the BBC's refusal to release Motson from his contract to join Setanta Sports (to whom the rights had been sold, along with ITV) he announced his retirement from live television commentary. The Euro 2008 final was his last live television broadcast. He has continued to cover games for Match of the Day highlights. Although Motson did not commentate on any live matches at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, he travelled to South Africa as part of the BBC team for the tournament, occasionally appearing as a studio guest on the Match of the Day highlights show, as well as providing reports on the BBC website.Steve Wilson (24 June 2008). \\"Euro 2008: John Motson's finals farewell\\". The Daily Telegraph. London. Since 2015, Motson has provided the commentary and narration to the CBeebies football programme Footy Pups'. Motson is also an ex-commentator for the FIFA video games series by EA Sports, and has worked alongside Ally McCoist, Andy Gray, Des Lynam, Mark Lawrenson and Chris Waddle. Motson first joined the franchise for FIFA 96; he and McCoist were replaced by Gray and Clive Tyldesley for FIFA 06 but later returned for FIFA Manager 08. In September 2017, Motson announced that he would retire from the BBC at the end of the current football season. His last live radio commentary was on a match between Arsenal and Watford on 11 March 2018. His final TV commentary was a match between Crystal Palace and West Bromwich Albion and was broadcast on Match of the Day on 13 May 2018. On 19 May 2018 BBC Two celebrated Motson's career with an evening featuring three special programmes - Motty Mastermind, Motty - The Man Behind the Sheepskin and Countdown to the Full Motty. In August 2018, John Motson was unveiled as the voice of Football INDEX, lending his voice to national TV and radio advertisements for the 2018/19 football season. In December 2018, Motson was announced as the commentator for the free to play mobile game Head Ball 2 in which he also serves as your tutorial guide when starting the game.

The couple have been married for 43 years. One of his nicknames is 'the Maestro'. He has one son, Frederick (born in 1986). In an article in 1982 Motson talked of his family and personal connections to Boston in Lincolnshire including being baptised in the town and spending his childhood holidays there. He also said he was a follower of Boston United and recalled the club's famous victory over Derby County in the FA Cup in 1955Boston United v Sheffield United football programme, 11 December 1982, p5.

Part of the Australian Highway 1 network, the motorway is designated with the route number M1. The motorway is sometimes known by its previous signposting F6 (Freeway Route 6) and its previous name, the Southern Freeway, which applied to the sections between Waterfall and Bulli Tops as well as Gwynneville and Yallah.F6 Southern Freeway, Ozroads: the Australian Roads Website. Retrieved 24 August 2008. The section between Bulli Tops and Gwynneville was known as Mount Ousley Road, and was first built as a defence route and later upgraded to dual carriageway standards. In early 2013, as part of the New South Wales alphanumeric route conversion process, the entire motorway was renamed to its current name. It is the backbone of road traffic in the Illawarra. As Wollongong and Port Kembla are important industrial centres, freight traffic is heavy. Despite the current decline of the local steel industry, emergence of Wollongong as a commuter city of Sydney has kept the motorway busy.  Sections  The northern terminus of the Princes Motorway looking south from , pictured in 2007, prior to the roadway being designated as the M1. In the north, the Princes Motorway route starts at Waterfall, taking more or less a parallel route with Princes Highway until the sprawling Bulli Tops interchange (with Appin Road (State Route 69) and Princes Highway). There it continues downhill, avoiding the steep Bulli Pass, and bypasses Wollongong CBD, through Gwynneville and continues for , bypassing the suburb of Yallah, and rejoining the Princes Highway north of near the Princes Highway junction with the Illawarra Highway. The motorway can be divided into three sections, with the two sections of the former F6 split by Mount Ousley Road in the middle.  Gwynneville to Yallah section  The construction of this first section of motorway commenced in May 1959, initially as a bypass of the Wollongong City Centre. A small section of this route, between Princes Highway and Foley Street, opened in December that year The full first section opened to traffic in July 1963, though as a two-lane road with at-grade intersections. The connection to Mount Ousley Road was made in March 1964, signalling the beginnings of the F6. Duplication of the route to West Wollongong was completed in 1965. The freeway continued making its way southward, with extensions to Masters Road opening in 1967, to Northcliffe Drive in 1973 (albeit as a single carriageway, with duplication finished in 1975), to Kanahooka Road in 1978 (with duplication concluding in 1979), Fowlers Road in 1981 (with duplication concluding in 1983), and to its current terminus at Yallah in 1986 (with duplication concluding in 1987). The intersection with the Northern Distributor at Gwynneville remained an at-grade intersection before a new intersection was built and entered service in December 1998.  Waterfall to Bulli Tops section  Construction of the section between Waterfall and Bulli Tops commenced in July 1970.Tollwork to link centres Truck & Bus Transportation July 1970 page 181 At 22.9km, it was then the longest section of freeway to completed at one time, at a cost of $30.5 million. Financed by State Government bonds, from its opening on 24 July 1975, this section of freeway initially incurred a toll.Lewis Opens Super Road Illawarra Mercury 25 July 1975 This part of the freeway did not feature the Helensburgh Interchange (which subsequently opened in February 2000). The toll operated for 20 years, which was 10 years short of its intended operating length. The main reason for this was local residents complaining that the F3 Freeway had its toll dropped in 1988, which was at the time intended to be dropped as its loans had been fully paid off unlike those of the F6. After much pressure the toll for the F6 freeway was removed on 30 July 1995 as the loans had been repaid.State Government abolishes F6 charge Daily Telegraph Mirror 17 May 1995 page 5 Remnants of the tollbooths are still able to be seen at the old toll plaza at Waterfall. One of the lanes and very faint markings are still intact. Heading southbound one set of warning lights to slow down for the toll plaza are also still intact minus signage. Also constructed to complement the tollway were the dual carriageways from Waterfall north to Loftus, and the Sutherland Bypass, which opened to traffic on 16 September 1975.  Mount Ousley Road section  The section between Bulli Tops and Gwynneville was previously known as Mount Ousley Road, and is still often referred to as such. It was built in 1942 as a defence route and was later upgraded to dual carriageway to help facilitate traffic as it now connects the two sections of the F6. It is sometimes not considered part of the freeway proper, as it is not fully built to freeway standards, containing left- in/left-out intersections and an at-grade intersection, though most major intersections are fully controlled access. This at-grade intersection, located at the base of Mount Ousley, is currently under investigation for upgrading to a full controlled-access intersection. In November 2015, it was announced that the section between Bulli Tops and Picton Road would have a third lane added in each direction.  Exits and interchanges   Proposed extensions  Northern extension The County of Cumberland planning scheme of 1948 outlined an F6 extension from the current-day end-point at Waterfall. As such, an F6 corridor was set aside that passes through the Royal National Park from Waterfall to Campbell Road in St Peters. The land reservation tract currently passes through the suburbs of Loftus, Kirrawee, Gymea, Miranda, Taren Point, Sandringham, Sans Souci, Ramsgate, Monterey, Kogarah, Brighton-Le-Sands, Rockdale, Banksia, Arncliffe, Kyeemagh and Tempe. Of the proposed extension, only the six-lane Captain Cook Bridge and a short connecting section of Taren Point Road to the south have been built. Establishment of the bridge section of the F6 extension began in 1962, expedited to replace the ferry service that had operated from Taren Point to Sans Souci since 1916. Captain Cook Bridge was opened in May 1965. In the original plan, the F6 would connect to the Western Distributor. Then, in August 1977, premier Neville Wran cancelled the inner section of the F6 link, which at the time had an estimated construction cost of $96 million. At the same time, Wran announced that the inner section reservation would be sold off and the proposed extension would instead terminate at St Peters, a medium density industrial suburb. Prior to the 2007 federal election, the Liberal-Nationals (Coalition) government promised to allocate $20 million towards planning for the F6 extension. Although the Coalition lost the 2007 election, the funding was once again promised at the subsequent 2010 federal election. This funding would ensure the project is \\"shovel ready\\" when funding becomes available. In the mid 2010s, the F6 extension project was revived under the Liberal-National coalition state government. This project has since been renamed M6 Motorway. Southern extension At the southern end, the Princes Motorway will be extended to Oak Flats along the 9.8 km Albion Park Bypass, which is undergoing construction. The bypass is expected to be completed by 2022. The bypass will also complete the 'missing link' for a high standard road between Sydney and Bomaderry. The bypass is being built on a reserved corridor which was identified by Roads and Traffic Authority in a study in the mid 1990s. In 2013, the Roads and Maritime Services confirmed the reserved corridor to be suitable for the bypass.

For example, in mistletoe or members of the broomrape family, the structure penetrates the host's tissue and draws nutrients from it. In mycology, it refers to the appendage or portion of a parasitic fungus (the hyphal tip), which performs a similar function. Microscopic haustoria penetrate the host plant's cell wall and siphon nutrients from the space between the cell wall and plasma membrane but do not penetrate the membrane itself. Larger (usually botanical, not fungal) haustoria do this at the tissue level. The etymology of the name corresponds to the Latin word haustor meaning the one who draws, drains or drinks, and refers to the action performed by the outgrowth. In fungi Fungi in all major divisions form haustoria. Haustoria take several forms. Generally, on penetration, the fungus increases the surface area in contact with host plasma membrane releasing enzymes that break up the cell walls, enabling greater potential movement of organic carbon from host to fungus. Thus, an insect hosting a parasitic fungus such as Cordyceps may look as though it is being \\"eaten from the inside out\\" as the haustoria expand inside of it. The simplest forms of haustoria are small spheres. The largest are complex formations adding significant mass to a cell, expanding between the cell wall and cell membrane. In the Chytridiomycota, the entire fungus may become enclosed in the cell, and it is arguable whether this should be considered analogous to a haustorium. Haustoria arise from intercellular hyphae, appressoria, or external hyphae. The hypha narrows as it passes through the cell wall and then expands on invaginating the cell. A thickened, electron-dense collar of material is deposited around the hypha at the point of invagination. Further, the host cell wall becomes highly modified in the invaginated zone. Inclusions normally present in plasma membrane are absent, and the outer layer contains more polysaccharide. The wall of both partners is severely reduced. Functional exchange takes place within the haustorial complex. The host supplies organic carbon to the fungus, and the metabolic activity within the complex is considerably greater than outside. Carbon from the host is absorbed by the fungus, and transported to the rest of the thallus. The host plant appears to be functioning according to signals from the fungus and the complex appears to be under the control of the invader.Mycology - Structure and Function - Haustoria The haustorium may be mycelium or root-shaped. In plants Mistletoes (including Loranthaceae and Viscaceae) attach to their hosts via a haustorium. This structure both anchors the mistletoe, and taps into the host plant. Mistletoes use passive mechanisms to draw water from their hosts. They keep their leaf stomata open night and day which sets up a moisture gradient between mistletoe and host.Watson, D. M.

It was first performed in Stockholm on 17 April 1907. It remains one of Strindberg's most admired and influential dramas, seen as an important precursor to both dramatic Expressionism and Surrealism. Plot The primary character in the play is Agnes, a daughter of the Vedic god Indra. She descends to Earth to bear witness to problems of human beings. She meets about 40 characters, some of them having a clearly symbolical value (such as four deans representing theology, philosophy, medicine, and law). After experiencing all sorts of human suffering (for example poverty, cruelty, and the routine of family life), the daughter of gods realizes that human beings are to be pitied. Finally, she returns to Heaven and this moment corresponds to the awakening from a dream-like sequence of events. Interpretations The use of a dream to represent a setting in a theatrical work appealed to the traditionally realist author in that Strindberg expresses realistic concerns such as materialism, class struggle, gender role struggle, and the destruction of traditional marriage in (as stated in the preface) \\"the disconnected but apparently logical form of a dream. Everything can happen; everything is possible and likely.\\" The play itself represents a change in his style, one that would have widespread influence on the development of modernist drama. Eschewing realism, Strindberg explained that he had modeled his play, not on the pattern of cause and effect that had characterized the well-made play, but on the associative links found in dreams. Locales dissolve and give way to each other; time both moves forward and backward. During the course of the play, a castle grows up in the garden, as if it were a plant. At the play's end, it burns, revealing a wall of suffering and despairing faces, then blossoms at its top in a huge chrysanthemum. A description of the play's style can be found in Strindberg's prefatory note: > The characters split, double, multiply, evaporate, condense, dissolve and > merge. But one consciousness rules them all: the dreamer's; for him there > are no secrets, no inconsistencies, no scruples and no laws. He does not > judge or acquit, he merely relates; and because a dream is usually painful > rather than pleasant, a tone of melancholy and compassion for all living > creatures permeates the rambling narrative. The play itself doesn't center around a single well-defined individual, but rather simply follows someone who seems to be a combination of different professional men, all confused. The feminine foil to these men is Indra's Daughter, a Christ-like figure. She was played in the original production by Harriet Bosse, Strindberg's ex-wife.:59 Psychology of the author Strindberg wrote it following a near-psychotic episode. During that time, he came to be extremely disturbed, thinking witches were attempting to murder him. He later wrote a memoir about this period of his life. Eventually, though, he recovered, thanks to his mother-in-law. Previously, Strindberg had seen himself as a martyr, constantly persecuted by women. This affected his view of the overall relationship between the sexes, and of course his writing. He finally realized that he was playing a part in his failed relationships after his third marriage to Bosse collapsed. Bosse was behind the main character of A Dream Play. The play, called by Strindberg \\"the child of my greatest pain,\\" reflects the author's observation that life is an illusion, similar to a dream. Notable productions The Quarantine Inspector in a 2010 production of A Dream Play The world premiere of A Dream Play was performed at The Swedish Theatre in April 1907, six years after it was written. Harriet Bosse, Strindberg's third wife (divorced by this time) played Indra's daughter. Victor Castegren directed the production and Carl Grabow was the designer. Critics at the time noted that the demands of the play made it nearly impossible to mount a satisfactory production. Strindberg himself desired to re-stage it in his Intimate Theatre, but ultimately it was not successful. The play afterward attracted some of the 20th century's most celebrated directors, including Max Reinhardt, Olof Molander, Antonin Artaud, Ingmar Bergman, Roger Blin, Robert Wilson, Mike Dempsey, Robert Lepage and Alejandro Jodorowsky. The German director Knut Ström staged A Dream Play in Düsseldorf in 1918, co-directed with Paul Henkels. Ingmar Bergman staged the play three times, filming the first production for TV in 1963. https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0129891/ An edited version by Caryl ChurchillStrindberg, August. ed, Churchhill, Carol (2005) A Dream Play, Nick Hern Books, London. was staged at the National Theatre in London in 2005.

History An early mention of a ducal residence in Lyons can be found in 936, when William I, Duke of Normandy used to stay. The castle of Lyons-la-Forêt was constructed at the start of the 12th century by Henry I of England, also known as \\"Henri Beauclerc\\".Ministry of Culture: Château fort He died there in 1135, supposedly from \\"a surfeit of lampreys\\".Judith A. Green Henry I: King of England and Duke of Normandy, Cambridge University Press The town and the castle were occupied by King Philip II Augustus of France in 1193 but the following year, Richard I of England, back from captivity, obtained the restitution of Lyons; the king of England and Duke of Normandy stayed frequently until 1198. In 1202, Philip II Augustus re-conquered the city, and after him, several French kings were attracted by the Lyons forest and the good hunting grounds. From 1359 to 1398, the castellan domain of Lyons was part of Blanche de Navarre's dower after she became the widow of King Philip VI of France. In 1403–1422, it was the dower of Isabeau de Bavière, wife of King Charles. In 1419, in the course of the Hundred Years' War, the English took Lyons.Site listing the communes of France.

Catastrophic failures often lead to cascading systems failure. The term is most commonly used for structural failures, but has often been extended to many other disciplines in which total and irrecoverable loss occurs. Such failures are investigated using the methods of forensic engineering, which aims to isolate the cause or causes of failure. For example, catastrophic failure can be observed in steam turbine rotor failure, which can occur due to peak stress on the rotor; stress concentration increases up to a point at which it is excessive, leading ultimately to the failure of the disc. In firearms, catastrophic failure usually refers to a rupture or disintegration of the barrel or receiver of the gun when firing it. Some possible causes of this are an out-of-battery gun, an inadequate headspace, the use of incorrect ammunition, the use of ammunition with an incorrect propellant charge, a partially or fully obstructed barrel, or weakened metal in the barrel or receiver. A failure of this type, known colloquially as a \\"kaboom\\", or \\"kB\\" failure, can pose a threat not only to the user(s) but even many bystanders. In chemical engineering, thermal runaway can cause catastrophic failure. Examples Original Tay Bridge from the north Fallen Tay Bridge from the north Examples of catastrophic failure of engineered structures include: * The Tay Rail Bridge disaster of 1879, where the center half mile of the bridge was completely destroyed while a train was crossing in a storm. The bridge was badly designed and its replacement was built as a separate structure upstream of the old. * The failure of the South Fork Dam in 1889 released 4.8 billion US gallons (18 billion litres) of water and killed over 2,200 people (popularly known as the Johnstown Flood). * The collapse of the St. Francis Dam in 1928 released 12.4 billion US gallons (47 billion litres) of water, resulting in a death toll of nearly 600 people. * The collapse of the first Tacoma Narrows Bridge of 1940, where the main deck of the road bridge was totally destroyed by dynamic oscillations in a wind. * The De Havilland Comet disasters of 1954, later determined to be structural failures due to metal fatigue that had not been anticipated at the corners of square windows used by the Comet 1. * The 62 Banqiao Dams failure event in China in 1975, due to Typhoon Nina. Approximately 86,000 people died from flooding and another 145,000 died from subsequent diseases, a total of 231,000 deaths. * The Hyatt Regency walkway collapse of 1981, where a suspended walkway in a hotel lobby in Kansas City, Missouri, collapsed completely, killing over 100 people on and below the structure. * The Space Shuttle Challenger disaster of 1986, in which an O-ring of a rocket booster failed, causing the external fuel tank to break up and making the shuttle veer off course, subjecting it to aerodynamic forces beyond design tolerances; the entire crew and vehicle were lost. * The nuclear reactor at the Chernobyl power plant, which exploded in 1986 causing the release of a substantial amount of radioactive materials. * The collapse of the Warsaw radio mast of 1991, which had up to that point held the title of world's tallest structure. * The Sampoong Department Store collapse of 1995, which happened due to structural weaknesses, killed 502 people and injured 937. * The terrorist attacks and subsequent fire at the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, weakened the floor joists to the point of catastrophic failure. * The Space Shuttle Columbia disaster of 2003, where damage to a wing during launch resulted in total loss upon re-entry. * The collapse of the multi-span I-35W Mississippi River bridge on August 1, 2007.

An expert on India, he served as Secretary of State for India in the late 1930s. Background and education Zetland, born in London, was the son of Lawrence Dundas, 1st Marquess of Zetland, and Lady Lillian, daughter of Richard Lumley, 9th Earl of Scarbrough. He was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge. At Cambridge, he was a member of the University Pitt Club.

Accessed 11 July 2020. Zetland was returned to Parliament for Hornsey in 1907, a seat he held until 1916. Much of his public career centred on British India. In September 1912, he was appointed (with Lord Islington, Herbert Fisher, Mr Justice Abdur Rahim, and others) as a member of the Royal Commission on the Public Services in India of 1912–1915.London Gazette, Issue 28642 of 6 September 1912, p. 6631 He was Governor of Bengal between 1917 and 1922 and Secretary of State for India between 1935 and 1940. Although a member of the Conservative Party, his belief was that Indians should be allowed to take ever-increasing responsibility for the government of the country, culminating in Dominion status (enjoyed by Canada, Australia, and other formerly self-governing parts of the British Empire). Zetland played an important role in the protracted negotiations which led to the Government of India Act 1935, which began, subject to the implacable opposition of Winston Churchill and the \\"diehards\\" to anything that might imperil direct British rule over India, to implement those ideals.

Zetland was also an author: Rab Butler, who served as his Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the India Office, records that he asked how he could understand better his chief's thinking about the future of India and received the answer: \\"Read my books!\\" Zetland kept Butler, who had helped to pass the Government of India Act and had enjoyed great influence under Zetland's predecessor Samuel Hoare, at arm's length, requiring him to book an appointment in advance if he wanted to see him. Butler continued to serve under him for another two years, but devotes only a single paragraph to this period in his memoirs.Jago 2015, p.83 Zetland was ideally placed as Secretary of State for India to implement the new Act, although the two Viceroys with whom he served, Lords Willingdon and Linlithgow, were rather less idealistic than he. In the event, Willingdon and Linlithgow were proved right when the Congress Party won the 1937 Provincial elections, much to the dismay of Zetland. Zetland's term as Secretary of State — and the experiment with democracy represented by the 1935 Act — came to an end with Churchill's assumption of the Prime Ministership in 1940: Zetland then offered his resignation, feeling that his ideas and Churchill's regarding India were so different that \\"I could only end by becoming an embarrassment to him.\\" Zetland, who was known to favour good relations between the UK and Germany, was associated with the Anglo-German Fellowship during the late 1930s.Richard Griffiths, Fellow Travellers on the Right, Oxford University Press, 1983, p. 220 Zetland was sworn of the Privy Council in 1922 and made a Knight of the Garter in 1942.

He was made KCB in 1887. Life He was born in 1816, the second son of Newton Dickinson Hand Newton, vicar of Clungunford, Shropshire, and afterwards of Bredwardine, Herefordshire. He was educated at Shrewsbury School (then under Samuel Butler), and at Christ Church, Oxford (matriculating 17 Oct. 1833), where he graduated B.A. in 1837 and M.A. in 1840. Already in his undergraduate days Newton (as his friend and contemporary, John Ruskin, tells in Præterita) was giving evidence of his natural bent; the scientific study of classical archaeology, which Winckelmann had set on foot in Germany, was in England to find its worthy apostle in Newton. In 1840, contrary to the wishes of his family, he entered the British Museum as an assistant in the department of antiquities. As a career the museum, as it then was, can have presented but few attractions to a young man; but the department, as yet undivided, probably offered to Newton a wider range of comparative study in his subject than he could otherwise have acquired. In 1852, he was named vice- consul at Mytilene, and from April 1853 to January 1854 he was consul at Rhodes, with the definite duty, among others, of watching over the interests of the British Museum in the Levant. In 1854 and 1855, with funds advanced by Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, he carried on excavations in Kalymnos, enriching the British Museum with an important series of inscriptions, and in the following year he was at length enabled to undertake his long-cherished scheme of identifying the site, and recovering for this country the chief remains, of the mausoleum at Halicarnassus. In 1856-1857, he achieved the great archaeological exploit of his life by the discovery of the remains of the mausoleum of Halicarnassus, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. He was greatly assisted by Murdoch Smith, afterwards celebrated in connection with Persian telegraphs. The results were described by Newton in his History of Discoveries at Halicarnassus (1862–1863), written in conjunction with R. P. Pullan, and in his Travels and Discoveries in the Levant (1865). These works included particulars of other important discoveries, especially at Branchidae, where he disinterred the statues which had anciently lined the Sacred Way, and at Cnidos, where Pullan, acting under his direction, found the Lion of Knidos now in the British Museum.British Museum Collection The Lion of Knidos, British Museum, retrieved 30 November 2013 In 1860, he was named consul at Rome, but was the following year recalled to take up the newly created post of keeper of Greek and Roman antiquities at the British Museum. Newton's keepership at the museum was marked by an amassing wealth of important acquisitions, which were largely attributable to his personal influence or initiation. Thus in the ten years 1864-74 alone he was enabled to purchase no less than five important collections of classical antiquities: the Farnese, the two great series of Castellani, the Pourtales, and the Blacas collections, representing in special grants upwards of £100,000; only those who know what labour and tact are involved in the capture of even the smallest 'special grant' can appreciate what this implies. Meanwhile, his work in the Levant, bringing to the museum the direct results of exploration and research, was being continued by his successors and friends: Biliotti in Rhodes, Smith and Porcher at Gyrene, Lang in Cyprus, Dennis in Sicily, in the Cyrenaica, and around Smyrna, Pullan at Priene, John Turtle Wood at Ephesus were all working more or less directly under Newton on behalf of the museum. Of his own work as a scholar in elucidating and editing the remains of antiquity, the list of his writings given below is only a slight indication; nor was this confined to writing alone. In 1855, he had been offered by Lord Palmerston (acting on Liddell's advice) the regius professorship of Greek at Oxford, rendered vacant by Dean Gaisford's death, with the definite object of creating a school of students in what was then a practically untried field of classical study at Oxford. The salary, however, was only nominal, and Newton was obliged to decline the post, which was then offered to and accepted by Benjamin Jowett. In 1880, however, the Yates chair of classical archaeology was created at University College, London, and by a special arrangement, Newton was enabled to hold it coincidentally with his museum appointment. As antiquary to the Royal Academy he lectured frequently. In the latter part of his career, he was closely associated with the work of three English societies, all of which owed to him more or less directly their inception and a large part of their success; the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies, at the inaugural meeting of which he presided in June 1879; the British School at Athens, started in February 1885: and the Egypt Exploration Fund, which was founded in 1882. In 1889, he was presented by his friends and pupils, under the presidency of the Earl of Carnarvon, with a testimonial in the form of a marble portrait bust of himself by Boehm, now deposited in the Mausoleum Room at the British Museum; the balance of the fund was by his own wish devoted to founding a studentship in connection with the British School at Athens. In 1885, he resigned the museum and academy appointments, and in 1888 he was compelled by increasing infirmity to give up the Yates professorship. On 28 November 1894 he died at Margate, whither he had gone from his residence, 2 Montague Place, Bedford Square. Awards In 1874 Newton was made honorary fellow of Worcester College, Oxford, and on 9 June 1875 D.C.L. of the same university ; LL.D. of Cambridge, and Ph.D. of Strasburg in 1879 ; Companion of the Bath (C.B.) on 16 November 1875, and Knight Commander of the same order (K.C.B.) on 21 June 1887. He was correspondent of the Institute of France, honorary director of the Archaeological Institute of Berlin, and honorary member of the Accademia dei Lincei of Rome. Family On 27 April 1861, he married the distinguished painter, Ann Mary, daughter of Joseph Severn, himself a painter and the friend of John Keats, who had succeeded Newton in Rome; she died in 1866 at their residence, 74 Gower Street, Bloomsbury. Works He was editor of the Collection of Ancient Greek Inscriptions in the British Museum (1874 &c.; fol.), and author of numerous other official publications of the British Museum ; also of a treatise on the Method of the Study of Ancient Art, 1850; a History of Discoveries at Halicarnassus, Cnidus, and Branchidse, 1862-3 ; Travels and Discoveries in the Levant, 1865 ; Essays on Art and Archæology, 1880 ; and of many papers in periodicals, among which may be specially noted a Memoir on the Mausoleum in the Classical Museum for 1847.

Background Deschooling is mainly credited to Ivan Illich, who felt that the traditional schooling children received needed to be reconstructed. He believed that schools contained a \\"hidden curriculum\\" that caused learning to align with grades and accreditation rather than important skills. Illich believed that the modern school is grounded on a foundation that is focused on growing schools as an industrialized system. Illich communicated that the school system has formed a toxic industry that specializes in what families should be capable of forming themselves, namely education. According to Illich, schools align success on paper with academic excellence. He presumed that schools, grades, and diplomas gave false assumptions that the students have become knowledgeable in a certain educational concept. John Holt was an educator who also believed in deschooling. His thoughts were closely aligned with Illich because neither were convinced that school was the place that taught students everything they needed to know. Instead, they communicated that school was not the sole avenue for learning because students learn consistently through other facets, such as exposure to the natural world. As a result, Illich and Holt saw schools as being insufficient because of their focus on strictly doing \\"skill drill\\" instead of other methods of learning. Additionally, theorists of deschooling saw education as maintaining the social order. Therefore, they wanted to \\"denounce the monopoly that traditional education institutions held on education and learning.\\" Unschooling/deschooling society \\"Deschooling\\" a person does not mean disregarding the act of learning or studying in schools. Illich and Holt's image of an unschooled society would ensure that everybody has the choice of whether they (or their children) attend school. Rather than being forced to go to school, taking a test before entering a school or being denied the opportunity to learn a desired topic, people would be free to choose how they learn. According to John Holt, an advocate for unschooling, \\"a deschooled society would be a society in which everyone shall have the widest and freest possible choice to learn whatever he wants to learn, whether in school or in some altogether different way.\\" Holt later began to use the term \\"unschooling\\" to encompass his educational belief system.

Her debut performance in South Africa was singing Handel's Messiah at the Johannesburg City Hall on 11 December 1951. In July 1953 she married broadcaster and composer Dawid Engela. She left South Africa in September 1953 for London, and then went via The Hague to Vienna. In January 1954 she started training with Maria Hittorff and Josef Witt. Opera career Coertse made her debut in January 1955 as the \\"first flower girl\\" in Wagner's Parsifal at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples, Karl Böhm conducting. She also sang in Basle at the Teatro San Carlo. On 17 March 1956 she made her debut at the Vienna State Opera as the Queen of the Night in Die Zauberflöte by Mozart and remained with the Vienna State Opera until 1978. Her Covent Garden debut was in 1956, in the same role. Her roles were limited in the United Kingdom as the Equity boycott of South Africa due to Apartheid, prevented its members from having anything to do with South Africa's entertainment industry.

Coertse sang the soprano part in Bach's Matthäus-Passion at Fritz Wunderlich's first appearance in Vienna in 1958, when he performed the tenor arias with Julius Patzak singing the Evangelist. In 1958, Coertse and Fritz Wunderlich again worked together at the Aix-en-Provence festival in Die Zauberflöte. In 1965, she sang Konstanze in Die Entführung aus dem Serail at the Vienna State Opera which also featured Fritz Wunderlich as Belmonte. In 1966, Mimi was honoured by the President of Austria with the title Österreichischer Kammersänger, for her ten years of work as a permanent member at the Vienna State Opera. Her repertoire also includes: * The Magic Flute (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) – Queen of the night * Il Seraglio (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) – Constance * Ariadne auf Naxos (Richard Strauss) – Najade, later Zerbinetta * Rigoletto (Giuseppe Verdi) – Gilda * The Tales of Hoffmann (Jacques Offenbach) – Olympia, Antonia, Giulietta, Stella * Palestrina (Hans Pfitzner) – the Angel * Carmen (Georges Bizet) – Frasquita * Martha (Friedrich von Flotow) – Martha * Mignon (Ambroise Thomas) – Philine * La traviata (Giuseppe Verdi) – Violetta * I Pagliacci (Ruggiero Leoncavallo) – Nedda * Arabella (Richard Strauss) – Fiaker-Milli * Bastien und Bastienne (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) – Bastienne * The Merry Widow (Franz Lehár) – Hanna Glawari * Lucia di Lammermoor (Gaetano Donizetti) – Lucia * Die Fledermaus (Johann Strauss II) – Rosalinde * L'heure espagnole (Maurice Ravel) – Concepcion, staging Otto Schenk * Don Giovanni (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) – Donna Elvira * La bohème (Giacomo Puccini) – Musetta * Norma (Vincenzo Bellini) – Norma * Così fan tutte (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) – Fiordiligi * Falstaff (Giuseppe Verdi) – Mrs. Alice Ford * Turandot (Giacomo Puccini) – Liu, a young slave * Don Giovanni (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) – Donna Anna * Die schweigsame Frau (Richard Strauss) – Aminta, Timida 1968 Premiere Vienna State Opera, staging Hans Hotter * Die ägyptische Helena (Richard Strauss) – Aithra * Daphne (Richard Strauss) – Daphne * Don Carlos (Giuseppe Verdi) – Elisabeth von Valois Later years Since returning to South Africa in 1973 she has been a regular guest on South African stages and also a frequent broadcaster on radio and television. She returned to the Vienna State Opera for a single farewell performance as Elisabetta in Don Carlo on 14 December 1978. In recent years she has devoted her time to exposing young South African singers to the neglected art of Lieder singing which can be artistically even more demanding than opera singing. Her support for her fellow South African musicians has been outstanding – as may be witnessed in her Debut with Mimi and through the Mimi Coertse Bursary. In 1996, Austria's Federal Ministry for Science and Art awarded her the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art (Austrian Honour, first class) honour, the highest honour an artist can receive in that country. In 1998, she received an honorary doctorate from the University of Pretoria and another in 2013 from the Unisa. In 2002 she would receive the Golden Rathausmann from the mayor of Vienna. In 1998, Coertse and Neels Hansen founded The Black Tie Ensemble, a development project which enables young, classically trained singers to bridge the gap between training and professional performance. This project has developed into the most exciting classical singing ensemble in South Africa, and is now on the brink of becoming a vibrant, new, young opera company.

At the 2001 census, the parish had a population of 2,120, decreasing to 2,021 at the 2011 Census. Allendale is within the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB); the second largest of the 40 AONB's in England and Wales. The local economy is predominantly based on agriculture (notably sheep farming) and tourism, although of late it has become a popular commuter town for Newcastle upon Tyne. Allendale is located around by road from the town of Hexham, and around from both Carlisle and Newcastle upon Tyne.  History  Guisers carry lighted tar barrels during the New Year fire festival, a tradition dating back to 1858. Allendale refers to the \\"dale\\" or valley of the River Allen. Evidence of prehistoric settlement has been found on the surrounding moorland. In the 16th century this area, close to the Scottish border, was a lawless and troubled place. Fortified farmhouses known as 'bastles' were constructed to protect residents and livestock against reiver raids. Allendale has a concentration of bastles, around 40 can still be seen, many as scenic ruins. Local mining for lead has occurred since Roman times, with the first smelting mill being constructed in the 1600s. The significant growth of Allendale Town and the surrounding villages was fuelled by that of the local lead-mining and smelting industries in the 19th century. The remains of two flues from the former smelting mill (between Allendale and Catton) run to chimneys up on the fells high above the village. The smelting mill is now home to the Allendale Brewery and the Allenmills Regeneration Project. In 1869, the Hexham and Allendale Railway was opened to provide improved transport, but its opening coincided with a rapid decline in the industry due to cheap imports of lead. The last mines in the area closed in 1894 (although an attempt was made to re- open the mine at Allenheads in the 1970s). With the closure of the lead mines, the population rapidly declined and Allendale became a popular tourist destination for Edwardian Tynesiders seeking a country escape. The railway was finally closed to passengers in 1930 and to goods in 1950 (when the local terminus was bought by the stationmaster and opened as a caravan park. Popularly held to be the town or dale that is referenced in Charles Jefferys' and Sidney Nelson's 1835 ballad The Rose of Allandale Rose of Allendale, published in the New York Mirror, and later sung by Paddy Reilly, The Dubliners and many others, it seems more likely that this song is either metaphorical or refers literally to the community on Allan Water in the Scottish Highlands at the beginning of the Firth of Forth. The explicit reference to Allendale, moreover, in 'Lucy Gray of Allendale', a musical setting of the earliest known work by Cumbrian poet Robert Anderson, manages to get the spelling of the town correctly. New Year fire festival The town's New Year celebrations involve lighted tar barrels that are carried on the heads of revellers called guisers. This tradition dates back so far its untraceable. It appears to have originated from the lighting of a silver band that were carolling at New Year. They were unable to use candles to light their music due to the strong winds, so someone suggested a tar barrel be used. Having to move from place to place, it would have been easier to carry the barrels upon the guisers' heads, rather than rolling them. There have been claims that it is a pagan festival, however, these claims are unfounded.Newell, The Allendale Fire Festival  Governance  Allendale is in the parliamentary constituency of Hexham, Guy Opperman of the Conservative Party is the Member of Parliament. Prior to Brexit, for the European Parliament its residents voted to elect MEP's for the North East England constituency. For Local Government purposes it belongs to Northumberland County Council a unitary authority, with Allendale lying in the Tynedale Division. Prior to the 2009 structural changes to local government in England it was part of Tynedale Council. Allendale has its own Parish Council; Allendale Parish Council.  Economy  The village hosts a health centre, village shop, Post Office, Co-operative store, brewery, butchers, chemist, gift shop, tea-room, art-cafe, beauty and holistic healing centre, and several pubs. Owing to its location, Allendale is a popular country holiday destination. There are a number of holiday cottages in and around the village as well as a caravan park.  Public services  Anglican church of St. Cuthbert's in winter Allendale hosts a scout group and there is an active village hall that hosts regular events. Allendale Library is located at Dawson Place in the village square.

Washington Post However, he came out of retirement in 1981 to appear in two productions (Madama Butterfly and Semele) with Washington Opera and in 1987 sang in a live German radio broadcast of Kurt Weill's cantata, Ballad of the Magna Carta.The performance of Ballad of the Magna Carta (and Weill's Der Lindberghflug from the same broadcast) were later released on cd (Capriccio Records 60012) Earlier in 1987, he had given a benefit solo recital for the McLean Choral Society. Amongst the pieces on the programme were two of his own compositions, a setting of Longfellow's poem \\"The Children's Hour\\" and A Rudhyar Suite: Sunset, Truth, Rebirth, Awareness which was set to texts by the astrologer, composer, and poet Dane Rudhyar. By the late 1960s, Tyl had developed an interest in astrology and its relationship to human psychology, particularly need theory. Astrology became his parallel profession for many years, and since his retirement from Tyl Assdociates has been his sole profession. His first book, The Horoscope as Identity, was published in 1973 by Llewellyn Publications and began his long association with that publisher. A twelve volume series The Principles and Practice of Astrology soon followed and over the years he became the company's most published author.Weschcke, Carl Llewellyn (September 1, 2005). \\"Noel Tyl: A Good Friend of Mine\\", The Llewellyn Journal, Llewellyn Worldwide His Synthesis and Counseling In Astrology, a 1000-page professional manual on the use of astrology in counseling, was published in 1994.

The island is a locality within the City of Gold Coast. In the , South Stradbroke had a population of 41 people. The by sized island is the smaller one of the two Stradbroke Islands and lies very close to the mainland. The island has hundreds of wild wallabies that are usually human orientated. They are also well known for stealing bread from tents and cabins, and joining campers at their fires. One of more than 360 islands within Moreton Bay, the southern end of South Stradbroke Island fronts the Broadwater, and the tip marks the Gold Coast Seaway, only a matter of metres from the mainland at Southport Spit. In the northeast is Tipplers Passage which separates the island from many smaller islands within the bay closer to the mainland. The east coast borders the Coral Sea. South Stradbroke Island consists mainly of sand dunes, remnant livistona rainforest and melaleuca wetlands. The island also has unique flora and fauna. The golden wallaby is endemic to the island and the agile wallaby, once more common to the region, has now retreated to the island.  History  In the north the island is separated by the Jumpinpin Channel from the larger North Stradbroke Island. Before 1896 the island was part of the Stradbroke Island. In that year the island was separated by a storm from North Stradbroke Island. The new tidal channel caused large changes to the channels and islands within southern Moreton Bay. Coastal managers are concerned that eventually one day Jumpinpin may repair itself which may cause problems for tidal waterway management including fish stocks, dugong habitat, erosion and flooding. Some land clearing for cattle grazing conducted in the early 20th century has occurred. During the 1950 to 1960s sand mining was conducted at the northern ocean beach area but reserves were limited. From the 1870s onwards the island's inner shores were used as camp grounds for holders of oystering licences. A small township called Moondarewa with 156 surveyed lots, was established at the island's southern tip. By 1953 the island's natural movement north had washed away most of the settlement. Also once located at the southern end was a small area of vine scrub rainforest that attracted significant bird-life. In 2009, some filming was done on the island for the 2011 film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. The population of the island at the was 101, but the number of people on the island swells significantly during the holiday season.  Heritage listings  South Stradbroke Island has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Lot 50WD3686: Grave of Ben Frances ManagerGold Coast Local Heritage Register - A to M, pp. 43-44 * Dux Anchorage (): Dux Hut.Gold Coast Local Heritage Register - A to M, pp. 33-34 * Canaipa Passage, Jumpinpin: Site of the wreck of the Cambus WallaceGold Coast Local Heritage Register - N to Z, pp. 115-116 * 4 Island Street, Currigee: The GravesGold Coast Local Heritage Register - N to Z, pp. 137-138 Accommodation facilities The island is a tourist destination. There are numerous campsites including an anchorage for the Southport Yacht Club and Dux Campsite, owned by The Southport School. Tipplers was purchased by the Gold Coast City Council in 2009. Due to ongoing encroachment of the sand dunes, the Council-run Bedrooms Campsite was closed in 2013. The Council has three alternate campgrounds: Tipplers that accommodates up to 100 tents with gas BBQs, a children's play area, and a kiosk that has basic camping supplies including ice and firewood; and North and South Currigee that together accommodates up to 80 tents with access to BBQs, a children's play area, and a mini kiosk for basic camping supplies. Couran Cove Island Resort is located on the north side of South Stradbroke Island Resort; located approximately forty minutes from Surfers Paradise, the Couran Cove Island Resort provides a range of quality accommodation options, fine dining and the opportunity to see native Australian animals in the forest. The resort was established by Ron Clarke and originally opened in 1998 as an eco-tourist resort. While the resort is not marketed as such now it does incorporate a number of environmental design features and technologies. There are also several private house located at the southern end of the Island. Recreation An conservation park provides access to native wildlife. The park is suitable for hiking and ocean fishing. Other recreational activities include jet ski tours, tube rides, 4WD tours, and speed boat rides. These operate from the Couran Cove Island Resort and Tipplers Passage.  Education  There are no schools on the island, but there are many schools on the mainland. However, accessing those schools would depend on the transport options available from the home location on the island. Distance education would be another option.

According to the Republic Report, the court appointed receiver, Studio Enterprise & South University had until April 11, 2019 to negotiate to separate both South University schools and the remaining Art Institute schools from the Dream Center Education IT Platform by September 11, 2019. \\"Should they fail to agree, the plan of reorganization will likely fail, thereby dooming South University and the Art Institutes\\". Student loan debtors have appealed to the US Department of Education for debt cancellation through defense to repayment claims. These efforts are premised on the allegations that they were defrauded. Students who attended the school during the time it closed may also be eligible for student loan cancellation. However, the Trump-DeVos administration has been unwilling to act in favor of students. The student debt group \\"I Am Ai\\" has acted as a support group for students and former of the Art Institutes, offering advice about debt cancellation. although it is unclear exactly which debts were cancelled, a report of $11 million in student debt was subsequently cancelled when DeVos and Trump finally buckled under pressure from I am AI in November, 2019. History At its height, The Art Institutes, as a for-profit college entity, had more than 50 campuses. However, as the for-profit education sector came under scrutiny, many campuses saw a marked decrease in enrollment. At least 35 schools closed in 2017–18, leaving about a dozen schools under two separate owners. The Art Institutes system was created in 1969 when Education Management Corporation (EDMC) acquired The Art Institute of Pittsburgh, which was founded in 1921. The Art Institutes' former parent company, Education Management Corporation (EDMC), was headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In November 2014, EDMC was delisted from the NASDAQ amid financial difficulties, lawsuits, and investigations and its stock was valued at less than one cent per share. Growth (2000-2009) Starting in 2000, The Art Institutes began offering bachelor's degrees and, in 2001, launched its distance education program, Art Institute Online, which began offering bachelor's and non-degree programs online. Throughout the 2000s, The Art Institutes expanded through the acquisition of existing art colleges and the establishment of new Art Institutes. In 2001, there were around 20 campuses of The Art Institutes; this grew to approximately 30 locations in 2006 before reaching 50 Art Institutes in 2010. Closures and Legal Issues (2009-2017) EDMC's initial public offering (IPO) was in 2009. Todd S. Nelson, who was previously the CEO of Apollo Education Group, became an EDMC board member in 2007 and the Chairman of the Board of Directors in 2012. In 2011, Frontline released a documentary titled Educating Sergeant Pantzke. In the documentary, Iraq war veteran Chris Pantzke discussed the lack of disability services at the school. According to Pantzke, \\"Being a soldier, you don't want to quit, you don't want to give up or fail.\\" After doing his own research, Pantzke concluded that the degree he was pursuing wasn't \\"worth much more than the paper is worth,\\" and felt he was \\"throwing away taxpayer money\\" by using GI Bill funds. In 2012, The Art Institute schools began to experience a decrease in the number of new students enrolling, seeing enrollment numbers drop by approximately 20 percent between the second quarter of the 2012 fiscal year and the start of 2013. EDMC has attributed the drop in enrollment to limited access to Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students and the economic recession. In February 2013, EDMC announced plans for a three-year-old tuition freeze at The Art Institutes. Under this plan, the company pledged to maintain the current cost of tuition through 2015. In June 2013, EDMC announced that its President John Mazzoni would resign effective July 14, 2013, after 27 years at the organization. Charles Restivo, Group Vice President, would become the Interim President of The Art Institutes. In 2014, the US Department of Education reported that ten EDMC campuses, including several Art Institutes, were placed under heightened cash monitoring. The Art Institute of Pittsburgh was one of the schools listed. In May 2015, EDMC announced that it would be closing 15 of the Art Institute locations. \\"A total of 5,432 students are enrolled among the campuses that are slated to close, according to a list provided by EDMC. The company will undergo a teach out process at each location, meaning each campus will continue to offer courses, student services and placement assistance until the last student has graduated, according to Hardman.\\" Campuses slated to close included those in Atlanta, New York City, Ohio, Texas and Pennsylvania. In January 2016, EDMC announced that additional Art Institutes would be ceasing enrollments. These campuses are The Art Institute of California – Los Angeles, The Art Institute of St. Louis, and the Art Institute of Tucson. At least 200 additional employees were laid off in May 2016. In June 2016, EDMC announced that the Art Institutes International Minnesota would be ceasing enrollments. That meant a total of 19 Art Institute campuses were scheduled to close. In June 2016, Tim Moscato, chief operating officer at the Art Institutes, resigned amid more downsizing. The same month, the US Department of Education voted to end ACICS power to accredit. ACICS was stripped of its power to accredit in September. On September 8, 2016, Art Institutes students known as \\"I Am Ai\\" presented a notice to the Director of New England Institute of Art (NEIA) about a lawsuit that would be coming in 30 days. The lawsuit is being written by the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School. On September 24, 2016, the Attorney General of Massachusetts expressed concern that the teaching duties at NEIA were being taken over by an unlicensed Indian company with no background in teaching US art students. The AG's Office stated that if a proper education for NEIA students could not be ensured, that NEIA should shut down at the end of the 2016.l In December 2016, nine additional Art Institutes were placed on probation by their accreditor, Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). Politico added that an Indian company might be buying the Art Institute of New York City and NEIA. Dream Center Education, More Closures (2017-2019) In 2017, Education Management Corporation reported that it had sold the existing Art Institutes to The Dream Center Foundation, a Los Angeles-based Pentecostal organization. The sale was complete in October 2017. In July 2017, an accrediting agency, Middle States Association, rejected the sale of the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia Art Institutes to the Dream Center Foundation. In January 2018, Art Institutes locations in Novi and Denver as well as the Illinois Institute of Art locations in Chicago and Schaumburg lost their accreditation with the Higher Learning Commission. They did not inform students about the loss of accreditation until June despite being required to disclose this at the time of the loss. In 2018, Dream Center Education Holdings reported that more AI campuses would be closing. In 2019, as many as 13 Art Institute campuses may remain open. However, the remaining schools face financial struggles in 2019. In December 2018, 23 Art Institutes were closed. In January 2019, The Washington Student Achievement Council suspended AI-Seattle's license to operate, which blocks enrollment of new students. The council will reinstate the license when Dream Center Education Holdings shows that it has \\"regained financial solvency or completed a viable reorganization.\\" AI Las Vegas also received a show cause notice from ACICS requesting that the school provide information showing why it should not lose its accreditation. In January 2019, DCEH chairman Randall Barton stated that the Art Institutes, excluding the Art Institute of Pittsburgh, Art Institute of Las Vegas and Argosy University campuses, have been transferred to the Education Principle Foundation. Also in January 2019, Dream Center Education Holdings announced that AI schools, excluding AI Pittsburgh, AI Las Vegas, and Argosy campuses, had been transferred to the Education Principle Foundation with help from the US Department of Education. Inside Higher Ed described Education Principle Foundation as \\"a Delaware nonprofit with no annual budget and almost no internet presence\\", and linked it to private equity firm Colbeck Capital Management. Studio Enterprise, a Los Angeles company tied to Colbeck Capital Management, was also involved in the ownership transfer. In February 2019, A federal court-appointed receiver halted Dream Center Education Holdings' plans to close the Art Institute of Pittsburgh on March 31, 2019. Art Institute students from closed schools have been directed to DCEH's partner institutions, including other for-profit colleges: DeVry University, Walden University, and Trident University. In March 2019, teachers and other staff had not been paid their final pay checks. As of August 2019, 8 Art Institutes campuses, in Florida, Georgia, Texas and Virginia, continue to enroll students. Schools and programs The Art Institutes offer degree programs at the associate's, bachelor's and master's levels, as well as non-degree diploma programs. Areas of study include graphic design, media arts and animation, culinary arts, photography, digital filmmaking and video production, interior design, audio production, fashion design, game art and design, baking and pastry, and fashion marketing. The Art Institutes in Fort Lauderdale, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Minnesota, New York City, Phoenix, Saint Louis, Salt Lake City, Tucson, Vancouver, Wisconsin, and York were accredited by ACICS, which has lost its accreditation power from the US Department of Education. Nine additional Art Institutes (The Art Institute of Atlanta, The Art Institute of Houston, Miami International University of Art and Design) and their branch campuses in Charleston, Nashville, Arlington, Virginia Beach, Austin and San Antonio were placed on probation by their accreditor, Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), in December 2016. In August 2018, the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reported that the Art Institute of Pittsburgh may lose their accreditation in 2019. Continued layoffs and downsizing at the remaining campuses occurred in late 2018 and 2019.

In May 2015, EDMC spokesperson Chris Hardman stated that the teach-outs would take two to three years. Student outcomes According to the College Scorecard, the Art Institute of Atlanta has a 19 percent graduation rate, a typical debt of $30,982, a 28 percent student loan repayment rate, and a median salary after attending of $30,900.https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/school/?138813-The-Art-Institute-of- Atlanta Accreditation issues The Art Institute of Las Vegas is accredited by ACICS; however, the Interior Design Bachelor of Arts, Media Arts & Animation Bachelor of Science, Baking & Pastry Associate of Science, Culinary Arts Diploma program were placed on student achievement show-cause due to material non-compliance with its retention rate standard of 60%. Art Institute of Pittsburgh was placed on probation by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education because of insufficient evidence that the institution is currently in compliance with Standard II (Integrity), Requirement of Affiliation 14, and the Related Entities Policy. The school will go through a probationary period until accreditation is reaffirmed or lost. The school had until March 2019 to submit information to show why the agency should not remove the school's accreditation. The regional accreditor, the Higher Learning Commission, voted on whether or not to hold a vote to impose their Change of Control policy after the sale from EDMC to DCEH to the following campuses: Chicago, Schaumburg, Colorado, and Michigan. Moving them from accredited to candidacy status for a minimum of six months. Any credits earned after February 2018 are unaccredited institutionally. Heightened cash monitoring (HCM) As of June 1, 2016, twelve Art Institute campuses were under heightened cash monitoring (or HCM1) by the US Department of Education because colleges are required to hold a certain amount of money to meet obligations in case the school closes prematurely. Campuses affected were Pittsburgh, Portland, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Fort Lauderdale, Minnesota, Colorado, Houston, Seattle, New York City, York, and Phoenix. Lawsuits, investigations, and legal settlements Between 2000 and 2018, the Art Institutes parent company EDMC was subject to numerous lawsuits from former students, former faculty, and government agencies. Thousands of former students of the Art Institutes claim they have been deceived and misled by the schools and their recruiters and have filed claims with the US Department of Education. Art Institute students are able to file defense to repayment claims with the US Department of Education. In October 2000, EDMC announced the settlement of a lawsuit brought by a group of approximately 350 former students of The Art Institute of Houston. The plaintiffs claimed that \\"they were misled about the nature, quality and utility of the education they would receive at The Art Institute of Houston.\\" From 2011 to 2015, EDMC was involved in a United States Department of Justice investigation and lawsuit alleging both illegal recruitment practices by EDMC schools, including The Art Institutes, and fraudulent receipt of $11 billion in federal and state financial aid money. A 2011 US DOJ report claimed EDMC \\"created a 'boiler room' style sales culture and has made recruiting and enrolling new students the sole focus of its compensation system.\\" In May 2013, a federal judge in Pennsylvania rejected a bid to dismiss a lawsuit against EDMC by a former EDMC employee. The lawsuit alleges that the corporation and its affiliates engaged in a scheme to maximize profits from financial aid programs administered by the U.S. Department of Education. The complainant in the case, Jason Sobek, who worked as an admissions director for EDMC in Pittsburgh from June 2008 through November 2010, alleges that the firm falsified information given to the Department of Education that indicated they were in compliance with the loan programs' eligibility requirements. In testimony that provided the basis for the lower court's decision last October, Sobek alleged that EDMC operated a \\"carefully crafted and widespread for-profit education scheme [in which] defendants have defrauded the United States and its taxpayers out of millions of dollars in the form of federally backed student loans and grants.\\" In 2014, an investigation by the City Attorney of San Francisco's office led to a $4.4 million settlement. The city claimed AI used deceptive marketing tactics resulting in underestimated program costs for students and inflated job placement figures for graduates. In November 2015, EDMC agreed to pay $95.5 million to settle claims of illegal recruiting, and consumer fraud. U.S. Attorney David Hickton said \\"Today's global settlement sends an unmistakable message to all for-profit education companies: the United States will aggressively ferret out fraud and protect innocent students and taxpayer dollars from this kind of egregious abuse.\\" In April 2016, two former AI teachers filed suit in Alameda City Superior Court claiming EDMC did not pay them a minimum wage or provide adequate rest periods, in order \\"to reduce compensation and increase its own profits.\\" On July 6, 2017, two former Art Institute students filed a lawsuit against Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos for illegally delaying rules intended to protect borrowers' rights. They were represented by the Project on Predatory Student Lending and Public Citizen in two lawsuits. This lawsuit helped clear the way for 2016 Borrower Defense Rule to take effect. In 2018, Dream Center Education Holdings took control of the remaining 31 Art Institutes schools. In December 2018, Art Institute students filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Cook County, claiming that Dream Center Educational Holdings failed to notify students it had lost institutional accreditation at four Illinois AI campuses. In 2019, reports from DCEH's monitor, Marc Dottore, indicated that $9–13 million of federal funds, meant for students stipends, is missing. According to thePittsburgh Post-Gazette, the monitor is \\"nearly out of cash to manage the entities he’s tasked to oversee.\\" Dottore has written to the Department of Education that Studio Enterprise, a company designated to service former and current DCEH schools, is taking service fees from the deal without providing any services, draining badly-needed cash from the operation. Information about the Education Principle Foundation is limited, but it appears to be formerly known as the Colbeck Foundation. According to the Republic Report, the Colbeck Foundation has ties to Studio Enterprise.

It is the area north of the New Cut of the River Avon, bounded by Clifton Wood and Clifton to the north-west, Kingsdown and Cotham to the north, and St Pauls, Lawrence Hill and St Phillip's Marsh to the east. The Bristol Royal Infirmary, Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, the BBC, the main campus of the University of Bristol, the Crown and Magistrate's Courts, Temple Meads railway station, Bristol bus station, the Park Street, Broadmead and Cabot Circus shopping areas together with numerous music venues, theatres and restaurants are located in this area. The area consists of the council wards of Central, Hotwells & Harbourside, and part of Lawrence Hill.  Historic centre  The mediaeval heart of the city was immediately north of Bristol Bridge, between the River Frome and the River Avon, at the High Cross where the four cross streets High Street, Wine Street, Broad Street and Corn Street meet. The traditional view that this was also the Saxon centre was challenged in the 1970s by archaeology suggesting that Bristol's origins lay to the east of High Street in the area that is now Castle Park, but recent Saxon finds around Small Street favour the earlier view. This was Bristol's pre-war central shopping district, a knot of ancient narrow streets including Wine Street, Mary le Port Street and Castle Street, which was severely damaged in 1940 during the Bristol Blitz. The area to the north and west of Castle Park, around Broad Street, Corn Street and St Nicholas Market largely survived, and contains many historic buildings.  The Centre  The course of the River Frome, immediately to the west of the historic centre, was covered over in stages, in the second half of the 19th century. The area became the hub of the city's tramway network, and was known as the Tramways Centre. It was so called long after the last trams left in 1941, but is now known simply as The Centre. Between 1936 and 1938, the Centre was enlarged when more of the River Frome, between Broad Quay and St Augustine's Parade, was covered in, making way for the Inner Circuit Road. The western side if the Inner Circuit Road has since been largely decommissioned, and recent works have rebalanced The Centre in favour of pedestrians, cyclists and public transport users. Broadmead The area northeast of the historic area, around Broadmead, was redeveloped after the war despite overwhelming public opinion against it, and the streets and shops in Broadmead became the main shopping district of the city. Like many 1950s buildings in Britain, affordable but architecturally uninteresting utilitarian buildings form the bulk of the Broadmead area. In the 1980s, some of these were demolished to make way for the Galleries shopping centre, which is a three level covered street. In 2008, the shopping area was extended over the central ring road to produce a new shopping centre, Cabot Circus, which opened in September 2008. Harbourside The City Docks were immediately south of the Centre. Although most ships used Avonmouth Docks after the Royal Edward Dock was opened in 1908, ocean-going ships were regularly seen at the Centre until the 1960s. In 1972 the Royal Portbury Dock was opened, and the City Docks were closed. The harbour buildings, including the tobacco warehouses, became redundant. The harbourside has been regenerated in the 1990s and 2000s, with the refurbishment of warehouses as bars, restaurants, the Watershed Media Centre and the Arnolfini art gallery, as well as the creation of At-Bristol.

He was also a distinguished translator. Biography Prokosch was born in Madison, Wisconsin, into an intellectual family that travelled widely. His father, Eduard Prokosch, an Austrian immigrant, was Professor of Germanic Languages at Yale University at the time of his death in 1938.Editors (August 12, 1938) \\"Prokosch of Yale Is Killed in Crash\\", The New York Times, p. 17. Prokosch was graduated from Haverford College in 1925 and received a Ph.D. in English in 1932 from Yale University. In his youth, he was an accomplished squash racquets player; he represented the Yale Club in the 1937 New York State squash racquets championship.Editors (January 16, 1937), \\"Adams Turns back Foulke in 5 games\\", The New York Times, p. 23. He won the squash-racquets championship of France in 1938. During World War II, Prokosch was a cultural attaché at the American Legation in Sweden. He spent most of the remainder of his life in Europe, where he led a peripatetic existence. His interests were sports (tennis and squash), lepidoptery, and the printing of limited editions of poems that he admired. From early on, Prokosch sought to surround himself with a veil of mystification and cast his life into a hopeless riddle. Approaching his sixtieth year, he boasted that no person had succeeded in knowing him as an integral personality: \\"I have spent my life alone, utterly alone, and no biography of me could ever more than scratch the surface. All the facts in Who’s Who, or whatever, are so utterly meaningless. My real life (if I ever dared to write it!) has transpired in darkness, secrecy, fleeting contacts and incommunicable delights, any number of strange picaresque escapades and even crimes, and I don't think that any of my 'friends' have even the faintest notion of what I'm really like or have any idea of what my life has really consisted of. . . .With all the surface 'respectability,' diplomatic and scholarly and illustrious social contacts, my real life has been subversive, anarchic, vicious, lonely, and capricious.\\"Frederic Prokosch, letter to [John] Radcliffe Squires, 17 June [1963], Special Collections, Washington University Libraries, St. Louis. See also Greenfield, Dreamer’s Journey, p. 17. The publication of Voices: A Memoir in 1983, advertised as a record of his encounters with some of the century's leading artists and writers, returned Prokosch to the limelight. His early novels The Asiatics and The Seven Who Fled were reissued to much public acclaim. In 2010, Voices was shown to be almost wholly fictitious and part of an enormous hoax.Greenfield, Dreamer’s Journey, \\"Disembodied Voices\\", pp. 376-390. Prokosch died in Le Plan-de-Grasse (near Grasse), France. Literary work Prokosch's novels The Asiatics and The Seven Who Fled received widespread attention in the 1930s. The action in both of these narratives takes place in Asia, a continent Prokosch had not visited but wrote about from his imagination and from books and maps. Landscape descriptions are so prevalent that the landscape often takes on the role of a character in its own right. Albert Camus said about The Seven Who Fled, \\"Prokosch has invented what might be called the geographical novel, in which he mingles sensuality with irony, lucidity with mystery. He conveys a fatalistic sense of life half hidden beneath a rich animal energy. He is a master of moods and undertones, a virtuoso in the feeling of place, and he writes in a style of supple elegance.\\"Greenfield, Dreamer’s Journey, p. 42. See also note 16, p. 409. The New York Times critic L. H. Titterton wrote about The Asiatics: :\\"Whether such adventures ever happened to any one man, or whether, as seems far more likely, the author has supplemented certain experiences of his own by a rich imagination, using as its basis information gathered through wide reading, is immaterial. For this is actually a quiet, meditative book into which adventurous episodes have been introduced simply as a device for displaing various aspects of the Asiatic mind and spirit. It is the work of a man of a deeply poetic nature possessed of an astonishing ability to describe in a few words a color, a scene, an odor, an emotional situation, an attitude of mind, an idea; words so well chosen that passage after passage seems perfectly to express some truth that we have many times, in a stumbling way, attempted to state.Titterton, L. H. (October 27, 1935), \\"A Glowing Evocation of the Asian Way of Life\\", The New York Times, p. BR3. Writing in The New York Times, Harold Strauss said about The Seven Who Fled (which won the Harper Prize): :In singing, supple prose, with an evocative power strange to our earthbound ears, with passion and often with fury, Frederic Prokosch takes us off to the vast, mysterious reaches of Central Asia. It is a weird adventure of the spirit on which he leads us. For, mistake not, despite the apparently realistic description of the endless reaches of the desert, of the topless towers of the snow-capped mountains, of the huddling villages in which men rot away in poverty and disease, this Central Asia of Prokosch's is not actual place upon the face of the earth. Like Xanadu, like Arcadia, like Atlantis or Aea [sic] or Poictesme, it is a phantom manufactured by a restless mind. ...Whatever the meaning of this book, and there will be much debate on that score, its wild lyrinative splendor and its profound emotional content mark it as a memorable novel.Strauss, Harold (August 29, 1937), \\"A Strange and Haunting Tale Set in Central Asia; Frederic Prokosch, in 'The Seven Who Fled,' Writes a Memorable Novel of Spiritual Adventure\\", The New York Times, p. 81. After the 1930s, popular interest in Prokosch's writing declined, but he continued to write steadily and to solidify his reputation as a writer’s writer with an elite following that included Thomas Mann, André Gide, Sinclair Lewis, Albert Camus, Thornton Wilder, Dylan Thomas, Anthony Burgess, Raymond Queneau, Somerset Maugham, Lawrence Durrell, Gore Vidal, and T.S. Eliot. “Pondering about Prokosch and his fate, I have come to the conclusion,” wrote Isaac Bashevis Singer, “that he is himself in a way at fault for being so woefully neglected. He has not cared to husband his natural riches... His roots are in this land. If Prokosch, like Faulkner, had limited his creative energies to one milieu, one region, he would certainly be counted today among the pillars of American literature.”Singer, Isaac Bashevis, \\"On the Courage to be Old-Fashioned,\\" Book World, January 14, 1968, p. 6. See also Greenfield, Dreamer's Journey, p. 19. Among the most noteworthy of Prokosch’s latter-day writings are The Idols of the Cave (1946), a sophisticated story about a circle of aesthetes and socialites in New York City through the war years; Nine Days to Mukalla (1953), a dreamlike journey into the Arabian world; A Tale for Midnight (1955), a Gothicized retelling of the Cenci story; The Wreck of the Cassandra (1966), a realistic and poetic story of nine people castaway on a savage island; The Missolonghi Manuscript (1968), a “mediation” on the romantic artist; and America, My Wilderness (1972), an excursion into magical realism. Prokosch was named a Commander in the Ordre des Arts et Lettres by the French government in 1984 and awarded the Volterra Prize two years later. His novels have been translated into 15 languages.

The park is one of the five original open-space parks planned by William Penn and his surveyor Thomas Holme during the late 17th century. The neighborhood is among the highest- income urban neighborhoods in the country. Together with Fitler Square, the Rittenhouse neighborhood and the square comprise the Rittenhouse–Fitler Historic District. Rittenhouse Square Park is maintained by the non-profit group, The Friends of Rittenhouse Square. Known as \\"the Square,\\" the park is widely considered one of the finest urban public spaces in the United States. The square cuts off 19th Street at Walnut Street and also at a half-block above Manning Street. Its boundaries are 18th Street to the east, Walnut St. to the north, Rittenhouse Square West (a north–south boundary street), and Rittenhouse Square South (an east–west boundary street), making the park approximately two short blocks on each side.  History  Originally called Southwest Square, Rittenhouse Square was renamed in 1825 after David Rittenhouse, a descendant of the first paper-maker in Philadelphia, the German immigrant William Rittenhouse. William Rittenhouse's original paper-mill site is known as Rittenhousetown, located in the rural setting of Fairmount Park along Paper Mill Run. David Rittenhouse was a clockmaker and friend of the American Revolution, as well as a noted astronomer; a lunar crater is named after him. In the early nineteenth century, as the city grew steadily from the Delaware River to the Schuylkill River, it became obvious that Rittenhouse Square would become a highly desirable address. James Harper, a merchant and brick manufacturer who had recently retired from the United States Congress, was the first person to build on the square, buying most of the north frontage, erecting a stately townhouse for himself at 1811 Walnut Street (c. 1840). Having thus set the patrician residential tone that would subsequently define the Square, he divided the rest of the land into generously proportioned building lots and sold them. Sold after the congressman's death, the Harper house became the home of the exclusive Rittenhouse Club, which added the present facade in c. 1901. From 1876 to 1929, Rittenhouse Square was home to several wealthy families including Philadelphia Railroad president, Alexander Cassatt; real estate owner, William Weightman; department store founder, John Wanamaker; Philadelphia planning commission director Edmund Bacon and his son, actor Kevin Bacon and several others. Elegant architecture like churches and clubs were constructed by John Notman and Frank Furness. The year 1913 brought more changes to the Square's layout when the French architect, Paul Philippe Cret redesigned parts of the Square to resemble Paris and the French gardens. These redesigns include classical entryways and stone additions to railings, pools, and fountains. After World War II, Rittenhouse added to its architecture with modern apartments, office buildings, and condominiums due to the real estate boom. Residential Rittenhouse Square historically housed Victorian mansions but are now replaced with high-rise apartments to accommodate the residents that live there. Shopping has become a popular activity with store buildings taking place of the brownstones along the streets. Historic design remains in Rittenhouse Square today, with prominent buildings in Italianate and Art Deco styles. Journalist and author Jane Jacobs wrote about Paul Philippe Cret's additions to the park that remain there today. Rittenhouse Square has changed the least out of the Squares. Vacant lots were converted to apartments and hotels, and original mansions were replaced with apartments such as Claridge and Savoy. Jacobs focused on sharing two main ideas in Paul Cret's redesign, intricacy and centering. Compared with the other four original squares in Philadelphia, Rittenhouse Square has survived proposed alterations that may have changed both its physical layout and character. In the mid 1900s, conflicts between homosexual and heterosexual communities were common within Center City neighborhoods. Gays and lesbians were found commonly living around Rittenhouse Square and saw the park as a safety zone for camaraderie. For gay men, the park was used as a place to find other men. Hippies and pre-Stonewall gays were also part of their own groups there. Arts and culture Today, the tree-filled park is surrounded by high rise residences, luxury apartments, an office tower, a few popular restaurants, a Barnes & Noble bookstore, a Barneys, a Starbucks that has been the center of controversy for racial discrimination, and a five-star hotel. Its green grasses and dozens of benches are popular lunch-time destinations for residents and workers in Philadelphia's Center City neighborhood, while its lion and goat statues are popular gathering spots for small children and their parents. The park is a popular dog walking destination for area residents, as was shown in the fictional film In Her Shoes. The Square was discussed in a favorable light by Jane Jacobs in her seminal work, The Death and Life of Great American Cities. The beauty of the park is due largely to the efforts of Friends of Rittenhouse Square, a public- private partnership with Philadelphia Parks & Recreation. Landscaping, lighting, restoration of fountains and fencing—even the installation and stocking of doggie-bag dispensers—are all projects of the Friends of Rittenhouse Square. During 2013, the 100th anniversary of architect Paul Cret's redesign of the Square, the Friends of Rittenhouse Square are working to raise record funds for a lighting and preservation initiative. New security cameras have cut down on vandalism, park rangers have helped calm behavior in the Square, and damaged balustrades and stonework are undergoing extensive restoration. The Rittenhouse Square neighborhood is also home to many cultural institutions, including the Curtis Institute of Music, Philadelphia Youth Orchestra, the Ethical Society, the Philadelphia Art Alliance, the Rosenbach Museum & Library, Plays & Players, the Wine School of Philadelphia and the Civil War and Underground Railroad Museum. Delancey Place is a quiet, historical street lined with Civil War-era mansions and the setting for Hollywood movies, located only two blocks south of the square. The square is home to many works of public art. Among them is a bas-relief bust of J. William White done by R. Tait McKenzie. Billy, the goat was created by Philadelphian Albert Laessle, who also designed the Penguins statue at the Philadelphia Zoo. Rittenhouse Square hosts dozens of events throughout the year, including some of the city's most popular happenings. Typically held in the beginning of May, the blockbuster Rittenhouse Square Spring Festival attracts tens of thousands for a celebration of the season complete with food, shopping, live entertainment and more. In the fall, hundreds of artists from around the country “Circle the Square” during the traditional Rittenhouse Square Fine Art Show. During the holidays, hundreds pack the park for the official start of the season during the Rittenhouse Square Christmas Tree Lighting featuring more than 5,000 brilliant holiday lights. Held year round on Saturdays from 10:00am – 2:00pm, the farmer's market of Rittenhouse Square sells locally grown food from farmers across the region. Farm to City organizes the event which crowds Walnut Street with market vendors on 18th and 19th Streets.

It has a JDBC driver and supports a large subset of SQL-92, SQL:2008, SQL:2011, and SQL:2016 standards. It offers a fast, small (around 1300 kilobytes in version 2.2) database engine which offers both in-memory and disk-based tables. Both embedded and server modes are available. Additionally, it includes tools such as a minimal Web server, command line and GUI management tools (can be run as applets), and a number of demonstration examples. It can run on Java runtimes from version 1.1 upwards, including free Java implementations such as Kaffe. HSQLDB is available under a BSD license. It is used as a database and persistence engine in many open source software projects, such as OpenOffice Base, LibreOffice Base, and the Jitsi VoIP and video-conference client since version 2.6. It is also used in commercial products, such as Mathematica and InstallAnywhere (starting with version 8.0).  Transaction support  HSQLDB version 2.0 has three transaction control modes. It supports with table level locks or with multiversion concurrency control (MVCC), or a combination of locks and MVCC. version 1.8.1 supports transaction isolation level 0 (read uncommitted) only.  Data storage  HSQLDB has two main table types used for durable read-write data storage, i.e., if a transaction has been successfully committed, it is guaranteed that the data will survive system failure and will keep their integrity. The default MEMORY type stores all data changes to the disk in the form of a SQL script. During engine start-up, these commands are executed and data are reconstructed into the memory. Another table type is CACHED, which allows one to store more data, at the cost of the slower performance. The HSQLDB engine loads them only partially and synchronizes the data to the disk on transaction commits. However, the engine always loads all rows affected during an update into the memory. This renders very large updates impossible without splitting the work into smaller parts. Other table types allow access to comma-separated values (CSV) files. These tables can participate, for example, in queries with JOINs and simplify spreadsheet processing and read-write non-durable in-memory data storage.  SQL features  HSQLDB 2.0 supports all the core features and many optional features of SQL:2008. Advanced features include user-defined SQL procedures and functions, schemas, datetime intervals, updatable views, arrays, lobs, full and lateral joins and set operations. Many non-standard functions such as TO_CHAR and DECODE are also supported. Extensions to standard SQL include user-defined aggregate functions.  Releases  Several versions of HSQLDB have been released since 2001. Early versions were based on the discontinued HypersonicSQL database engine. Version 2.0, released in 2010, is mostly new code, written to conform to Standard SQL and JDBC 4 Specification. Version 2.3.2 (released in 2014) is fully multi-threaded and supports high performance two-phase locking and MVCC (multiversion concurrency control) transaction control models.

It was founded in 1957 in Dhaka, erstwhile East Pakistan, by Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani and Yar Mohammad Khan, through the merger of various leftist and progressive political groups in Pakistan. Commonly known as the NAP, it was a major opposition party to Pakistani military regimes for much of the late 1950s and mid 1960s. In 1967 the party split into two factions, one in East Pakistan and another in West Pakistan. Led by Bhashani and other influential progressive leaders, NAP played an instrumental role in the secession of East Pakistan and the independence of Bangladesh. After the death of Bhashani in 1976, the party lost much of its prominence on the Bangladeshi political scene. Many of its leaders became members of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Today, the liberal and progressive faction within the BNP is led by former NAP leaders. After the 1971 war, the Pakistani faction of NAP became the principal opposition party to the Zulfikar Ali Bhutto-led government of the Pakistan People's Party. The NAP was banned after relentless attack by the then Prime Minister Bhutto, who accused NAP leaders of treason and after a sham trial the NAP was banned from Pakistani politics. The leaders of the NAP, including Khan Abdul Wali Khan, were only released during the regime of General Zia-ul-Haq.

Rashiduzzaman Pacific Affairs, Vol. 43, No. 3 (Autumn, 1970), pp. 394-409 Published by: Pacific Affairs, University of British Columbia The constituent parties in 1957 and their areas of influence were: *The Bhashani-led faction which broke away from the Awami League *Azad Pakistan Party a party led by Mian Iftikharuddin, Syed Kaswar Gardezi and Mahmud Ali Kasuri. *Sindh Mahaz led by G. M. Syed and Sheikh Abdul Majid Sindhi. *Sindh Hari Committee led by Haider Bakhsh Jatoi. *Wrore Pukhtun (Pukhtun Brotherhood) a Balochistan-based party led by Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai and Hashim Khan Ghilzai. *Usthman Gul (Awam Jamaat) of Balochistan led by Ghaus Bakhsh Bizenjo, Gul Khan Nasir and Prince Karim Khan of Kalat (princely state). *Khudai Khidmatgar from North-West Frontier Province led by Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan and Hakeem Mohammad Aslam Sanjari. Ghaffar Khan's son, Khan Abdul Wali Khan, also joined the party. *Ganatantri Dal an East Bengali party led by Haji Mohammad Danesh of Dinajpur and Mahmud Ali of Sylhet. The party President was Maulana Bhashani and the Secretary General was Mahmudul Huq Usmani. Mirza Mehdy Ispahani (aka Sadri Ispahani) was the treasurer. Afzal Bangash was the NAP's General Secretary in NWFP. The National Awami Party was along with the Awami League expected to easily win the 1959 planned general elections. Its primary target was the disbanding of the One Unit scheme in West Pakistan and a fair deal for the increasingly discontented people of East Pakistan.National Awami Party, Retrieved 27 June 2017 1958 ban In 1958 Ayub Khan came to power and all political parties were banned. The NAP was regarded by some as a front organization of the Communist Party of Pakistan (CPP) and it faced a harsh crackdown from the Ayub government. Hasan Nasir, NAP Office Secretary and card-carrying member of the CPP, was tortured to death in custody. Revival When Ayub allowed political parties again in 1962, the NAP was revived with all of its old components except the G.M. Sayed group and Ganatantri Dal.Progressive Movements in Pakistan collection Party split At the end of 1967 a growing rift developed within the party, allegedly because Maulana Bhashani told his supporters to support Ayub Khan in the 1965 elections against the joint opposition nominee Fatima Jinnah.National Awami Party In return he was supposed to have received payoffs and favours, a fact which he never contradicted. On 30. November 1967, after a council session of the party in Rangpur, the NAP formally split into two factions: *A pro-Chinese Bhashani faction in East Pakistan eventually formed part of Bangladesh Nationalist party (BNP) *A pro-Soviet Wali Khan faction in West Pakistan now part of ANP and PPP-P. Party reunification Reunification of the old NAP has recently taken place after the destruction of USSR and now all the factions are basically Pro-China in East Bengal (Bangladesh). The party wants to copy Asia Cooperation Dialogue (or ACD) programme which is the semi-political unity model that East Bengal and West part should have one loose presidency with 2 chief executives or PMS.  Political ideology  The NAP set the following as its main aims: #Defence of the sovereignty, integrity and independence of Pakistan. #Non-aligned, independent foreign policy. #Ending of exploitation of Pakistan externally and its people internally. #Abolition of One Unit and reorganisation of provinces on linguistic basis. #Right of adult franchise.Balochistan Nationalism and its origins In July 1965, as the manifesto was amended after the party's re-emergence, the NAP declared that the system of government in the country should be based on the concept of people's sovereignty. The Party advocated the maximum provincial autonomy in a confederal structure. Only Defence and Foreign Affairs were to be left with the 'Federal' government, while other powers were to rest with the autonomous units. One-Unit in West Pakistan had to be replaced by a \\"regional confederation where provinces would be created on linguistic lines\\".

It is north-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Blacktown. Quakers Hill is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. Quakers Hill is colloquially known as 'Quakers'. History The first recorded cartographic use in NSW of the 'Quaker' name is that of \\"Quaker's Row\\", today's Church Street, Parramatta. In November 1788 a second settlement is established by Governor Phillip at Rose Hill and was renamed in June 1791, Parramatta. In July 1790 he laid out his plan for the town, with High Street (now George) the main road with another (143 feet / 43.6 m wide) starting at the south bank of the river where Phillip intended a town square with government buildings and an extended wharf. This he named Quakers Row. Alan Sharpe, in his \\"Pictorial History Blacktown and District\\" (referenced below) on page 84 has no mention of the historic town plan of July 1790. Development at Parramatta was swift, with the Rev Samuel Marsden establishing conformist religious services. The Quaker's Row inhabitants were moved further west to The Quaker's Hills, where they re- established themselves. It is said they were responsible for burying the dead in simple cairn marked graves that lay in the fields, paddocks and creeks who were all victims of the 1804 uprising and rebellion. The name Quakers Hill was in an 1806 report of the area by government surveyor James Meehan. The origin of the name is unclear and the next references are more than sixty years later when Thomas Harvey used it for his property in what is now western Quakers Hill. When the railway station was built in 1872, it was called Douglas' Siding for over thirty years. The catalyst for the name change came with the subdivision of Harvey's Quakers Hill property in 1904. The residents of the newly forming village preferred that name and in 1905, the name of the railway station was changed to Quakers Hill.Sharpe, Alan: Pictorial History - Blacktown & District, page 84-87. Kingsclear Books, 2000 Postal services began in 1907 and the first post office was built in 1915. A school opened in the Presbyterian church hall in what is now Marayong in 1911 and Quakers Hill Public School took its first students in 1912. During the 1920s, the population grew dramatically, a number of shops opened in the area around the station and a public hall, the Empire Theatre, opened in 1925, screening movies and hosting dances. The village became a centre for the surrounding farms.Sharpe, Alan: Pictorial History - Blacktown & District, page 87-89. Kingsclear Books, 2000 In the 1960s, Sydney's suburban sprawl reached the Quakers Hill area and the five acre farms surrounding the village began to be subdivided. In 1994, HMAS Nirimba, a naval training property on the western side of the suburb, was decommissioned and converted into an educational precinct. In 1996, a new development in the north-east of Quakers Hill was converted into a new suburb, Acacia Gardens.Sharpe, Alan: Pictorial History - Blacktown & District, page 2,90. Kingsclear Books, 2000 Nursing home fire On 18 November 2011 an early morning fire at Quakers Hill Nursing Home killed 11 elderly residents, seriously injured others and caused the evacuation of up to 100 people. Three people died in the fire, and a further eight residents of the home died later in hospital from their injuries. The fire started in two places and was regarded by police as suspicious.  Aftermath  A nurse working in the home, 36-year-old Roger Kingsley Dean, was later arrested and charged with four counts of murder. (Updated 20 November 2011) He was later charged over more subsequent deaths. On 2 November 2012 the accused pleaded not guilty to eight counts of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm and eleven counts of murder. He had wished to plead guilty to manslaughter, but that was rejected by the Crown. He did plead guilty to two larceny charges relating to theft of prescription painkillers from the nursing home. He stood trial in the Supreme Court in May 2013. On 27 May 2013, Dean pleaded guilty to eleven counts of murder, and on 1 August 2013 he was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. In September 2014 an inquest into the deaths opened, and its results were released on 9 March 2015. After finding that the nursing home operators Domain Principal Group (now known as Opal Aged Care) didn't look into Dean's past before employment, Hugh Dillon, the NSW deputy coroner recommended: a database of healthcare workers be created with details of their background; that workers be trained to recognise signs of co-workers abusing drugs; and that nursing home door and corridors be constructed to allow beds to be moved rapidly during emergencies. Dillon also suggested that two fire-fighters receive bravery awards. Opal Aged Care has 69 homes in Australia. It was finished building in 2017  Transport  Public Transport to and from Quakers Hill is provided by train and a number of bus services by Busways, namely routes: 731 (outskirts), 732 (west), 734 (outskirts), 745 (all over), 752 (all over) and 753 (south). Quakers Hill railway station is on the Richmond branch of the North Shore & Western Line of the Sydney Trains network. Bus services connect to Sydney Metro network at Tallawong, Rouse Hill and Bella Vista stations. Quakers Hill has experienced much road development over recent years including the construction of a new road leading directly to the education precinct, bypassing the town centre. The Westlink M7, which links the suburb directly to all major routes in and out of the greater Sydney region, opened in December 2005. Following this opening the road overpass for the Quakers Hill Parkway has been widened from two to four lanes, including the bridge over the railway line, improving toll-free traffic flow between Richmond and Sunnyholt Roads.  Housing  Quakers Hill has a blend of old and new developments. There are some Housing Commission Houses on the older (southern) side of Quakers Hill, mainly near Marayong. The western side of the railway line predominantly has houses on standard residential blocks, some built when HMAS Nirimba was an active naval base, others through the 1960s and 1970s. The eastern side of the railway line consists of dwellings constructed since the 1980s, with a high proportion of high density homes or townhouses.  Education  Quakers Hill is home to numerous schools and educational institutions. The oldest is Quakers Hill Public School, opened in 1912. Two other public primary schools (Barnier and Hambledon) were opened in the 1990s to cope with suburb's growing population. High schools in Quakers Hill are split between Quakers Hill High School, catering to Years 7-10, and Wyndham College, years 11-12. There is also a Catholic primary school (Mary Immaculate) and high school (Terra Sancta College). Post-secondary education is serviced by Nirimba TAFE College and the University of Western Sydney, Blacktown Campus. Four of these facilities (UWS, Nirimba TAFE, Wyndham and Terra Sancta) are located together in the Nirimba Education Precinct.  Demographics  Population 250pxQuakers Hill has become a fairly populated suburb, experiencing major growth in recent years. In 1991, the population was approximately 14,630 (1991 ABS Census) and in 1996, the population had grown by more than 4,000 people to 18,759 (1996 ABS Census). By 2006, the population of Quakers Hill had risen to 25,015. The 2016 ABS Census recorded a further increase to 27,080 people.  Culture  In the 2016 ABS Census, the majority of people from Quakers Hill were born in Australia (58.0%). The second top response was India (10.4%). Most people identified as having an Australian ancestry (19%), followed by English (18%). Most people from Quakers Hill identified as Catholic in 2016 (30.3%), followed by No Religion (15.5%).

Stafford first tried to sell the game to established publishers, but despite being accepted by three different game companies, each attempt ended in failure; eventually he founded his own game company in 1974, the influential Chaosium, to produce and market the game. The game depicts the wars between the mighty Lunar Empire and the barbarian nation of Sartar, led by Prince Argrath, with many smaller countries and individuals available as allies to either side. Like other games of the board wargame genre, it has a hex map, many cardstock unit counters, and a number of rules themes. White Bear and Red Moon went through three printings with minor differences. It was substantially revised and republished in 1981 under the name Dragon Pass, first by Chaosium and then in a nearly identical reprint from the Avalon Hill Game Company in 1983. The main differences in the reprint are a few streamlined rules and a notable improvement in the quality of the components. In particular, the paper map was replaced by a full-color game board. All editions are now out of print, and moderately valuable to a collector. A French-language edition was published by Oriflam under license from Chaosium under the name La Guerre des Héros in 1993. A Japanese-language edition was published by Hobby Japan. Nomad Gods is another Chaosium board game that shares many rules in common, is set in a neighboring region of Glorantha, and can be regarded as a sequel of sorts. A planned third game in the series was never produced. Components The game components for the Dragon Pass version of this game include the box, a fold- out board map of the battle area, the rulebook, two sheets of die-cut cardboard counters, a player aid card, and a die. The game board is 22\\" × 31\\" and printed in color. The map is overlaid by a hex grid to regularize movement. At one end of the board is a turn track and several holding boxes for magical spirits and agents. The map includes a variety of different terrain types, including forest, marsh, hills, mountains, fortresses, stockades, ridges, cities, ruins, and lakes. Each type of terrain has different effects on movement and combat. There are also roads, rivers, and fords that can alter the movement. The map is also divided up into several territories, including a number of independent nations. This game features a great variety of unit types and nations, forming a colorful array of unit counters with a somewhat complex system of ratings and symbols. Some units represent troops, while others are individual heroes, spirits, or agents. Game play An unlimited number of units can be grouped together in the same hex to form a stack. Depending on the components of the stack and how it is ordered, most stacks exert a zone of control into the surrounding hexes. Units must cease movement upon entering an enemy zone of control, and a unit can not move directly from one enemy zone of control to another. Stacks that are currently disembodied do not exert a zone of control. Each active player's turn consists of the following phases: * Move those units that are subject to random movement. * Attempt to gain allies. * Move any friendly units, and add replacements and reinforcements. * Use any exotic abilities (such as magic). * Resolve combat. * Rally units that are disrupted. Resolution of combat can include various types of magic, the use of missile fire, and finally melee combat. The combat results are in the form of Combat Factor losses, which is one of the ratings on the counters. As is typical of many wargames, every friendly unit that is adjacent to an opposing unit must attack an adjacent opposing unit. Also each opposing unit adjacent to a friendly unit must be attacked. The exception to this is a unit inside a fortification, which is not forced to attack. This game includes a considerable amount of chrome, simulating the variety of heroes, creatures, and magic that were involved in the battles. This can be an appealing factor to those who enjoy games with a fantasy atmosphere. Heroes and superheroes can have a powerful impact on the outcome of the various battles. The extra details can add complexity to what would otherwise be a relatively simple board wargame. Reception Sumner N. Clarren reviewed White Bear and Red Moon in The Space Gamer No. 5. Clarren commented that \\"The game has been crafted with great skill and wit, rare in games today.\\" Neil Shapiro reviewed White Bear and Red Moon in The Space Gamer No. 13. Shapiro commented that \\"White Bear and Red Moon is much better than just fantastic [...] It is a sub-creation as real as all mythology.\\" Greg Costikyan reviewed White Bear & Red Moon in Ares Magazine #1, rating it an 8 out of 9. Costikyan commented that \\"White Bear & Red Moon is less a game than a description of an entire culture. In a short rulebook, it provides an insight into the religions, governments, and ideologies of whole peoples; descriptions of weird and imaginative alien races; the rationales for several competing kinds of magic; and the biographies of the greatest heroes of the age. Further, despite its occasional awkwardnesses, White Bear & Red Moon is an enjoyable and fast-playing game.\\" Forrest Johnson reviewed the 1980 revised edition, Dragon Pass, in The Space Gamer No. 40. Johnson commented that \\"The rules for Dragon Pass are no cleaner than those for White Bear and Red Moon. After all this time, Chaosium should know better than to publish a game which has not been blindtested.\\" Steve List reviewed Dragon Pass in Ares Magazine #14 and commented that \\"While in some ways it is less \\"magical\\" than its predecessor, it is a better product in general and can be appreciated by the average gamer and dedicated fantasy fan alike.

Early life He was born in Belfast and grew up in Mountpottinger in the east of the city. At school he showed a talent for writing and went on to read English at Queen's University Belfast where he won a number of prizes for literary essays, graduating in 1931. On completion of his degree, he entered Presbyterian Theological College and was ordained as a Presbyterian minister in 1935. He was first appointed to Loughgall Presbyterian Church, Loughgall, County Armagh, where he was minister for 12 years. In 1936 he married Marie Harden Waddell, a medical doctor who set up practice in the village. Awake! and Other Poems (1941) was given glowing reviews in Britain and America, although the first edition was almost totally lost when the publisher’s warehouse was destroyed in the London Blitz. His wife became ill (later diagnosed as schizophrenia) and they left Loughgall temporarily in 1943, she to seek treatment, he to write in Oxford. He returned to Loughgall after a year but resigned from his ministry in 1946 to take up post at the BBC in London as a scriptwriter for the newly established BBC Third Programme after being approached by Louis MacNeice and offered a post. He involved himself in the Regionalist movement among Ulster writers in the 1940s and 1950s and contributed to a number journals which were used as a vehicle for the regionalist movement such as Lagan, The Bell and '. He collaborated with Louis MacNeice in the unpublished The Character of Ireland. Later life Rodgers stayed at the BBC as a full-time producer and scriptwriter until 1953 when he went free-lance. He produced a highly innovative series of radio broadcasts on Irish literary figures: Irish literary portraits. He was elected a life member of the Irish Academy of Letters in 1951 to fill the vacancy due to the death of George Bernard Shaw and was a member of the Literature and Poetry Panel of the Arts Council of Great Britain and a board member of the Arts Council of Northern Ireland. His wife died in 1953, following a period of illness. In the same year he married Marianne Gilliam (née Helweg) the ex-wife of his immediate boss in the BBC, Lawrence Gilliam. They lived in England until 1966 when Rodgers secured a post as writer in residence at Pitzer College, Claremont, California and later a lecturing post at California State Polytechnic. In 1968 he was awarded a life annuity of £100 by the Dublin Arts Council as an acknowledgement of his distinction in letters and of the honour which his literary work had reflected on Ireland. He died in 1969 in Los Angeles and was buried at Loughgall, County Armagh. Works *Awake!

The single malt whiskies used in The Famous Grouse blend include the Edrington-owned Highland Park and The Macallan. Its emblem is the Red Grouse, Scotland's national game bird. It has been the highest selling whisky brand in Scotland since 1980. As a standard price blended Scotch whisky, its main competitors in its home market are Bell's, Teacher's and Grant's. The majority of its sales in the United Kingdom are during the Christmas period.  History  Matthew Gloag was a grocer and wine merchant at 22 Atholl Street, Perth, Scotland.Perth Post Office Directory 1850 Gloag purchased whiskies from distilleries around Scotland, and when Queen Victoria visited Perth in 1842, he was invited to supply the wines for the royal banquet. In 1860, his son, William Gloag, took over the company. Following the Great French Wine Blight the company began to look at creating its own blended whiskies around 1875. In 1896, William's nephew, Matthew Gloag (1850-1912), took over the family business. He created a new blended brand called The Grouse in 1896. at this time the company was still operating from the grandfather's premises but had expanded to occupy adjacent shops, jointly covering 20 to 26 Atholl Street Perth Post Office Directory 1900p111&227. In 1905 the limited company of Matthew Gloag & son was formed and the Grouse was renamed The Famous Grouse in the same year. Matthew Gloag's daughter Phillippa first designed the label's grouse icon. Only at this point did the company move to new purpose-built premises on Kinnoull Street.Perth Post Office Directory 1905 In 1970, Matthew Gloag & Son, owned by the Gloag family, was sold to Highland Distillers, after the death of the chairman, Matthew Frederick Gloag. The marketing and distributive power of the company saw Famous Grouse become the highest selling Scotch in Scotland by 1980 and the second highest selling in the United Kingdom. From the 1980s the brand began to be exported overseas, where it now sells over 2 million cases annually. In 1984 The Famous Grouse was awarded the Royal Warrant.  Characteristics  The standard blend is 40% ABV. The blend is matured in oak casks for up to six months at 46% ABV.  Variants  A bottle of Black Grouse In 2007 a peated special version of The Famous Grouse called The Black Grouse developed for the Swedish market was released. The packaging displays a black grouse in place of the usual red grouse. The following year a special version, meant for chilling, was released called The Snow Grouse. The packaging features a ptarmigan. In 2011, The Naked Grouse was launched as its premium product. Initially as a high-end blended whisky, in 2017 it was turned into blended malt whisky.  Promotions and sponsorships  The Famous Grouse has focussed its television advertising around the Christmas period since 1996. The Famous Grouse was the primary sponsor of the Perth- based football team St Johnstone between 1986 and 1989 and again between 1991 and 1998. It also sponsored the Scotland national rugby union team from 1990 until 2007, and was 'The Official Spirit of Scottish Rugby' from 2013 for three years. In May 2014, Famous Grouse was named the Official Whisky of the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

Sichel Söhne (Mainz) in 1923 with the 1921 vintage, and which between the 1950s and 1980s was a very popular international brand. For most of its existence, Blue Nun was a single German wine, which until the late 1990s was classified as a Liebfraumilch, but the name is now used for a whole range of wines of various origins. When it was created, the label was designed as a consumer-friendly alternative to the innumerable German wine labels with Gothic script and long, complicated names. With the creation of its UK office in 1927, Sichel targeted the export market. Beginning in the 1950s, Blue Nun was advertised as a wine that could be drunk throughout an entire meal, thereby eliminating the often intimidating problem of wine and food pairing. Blue Nun can be said to have been the first wine to have been produced and effectively marketed with an international mass market in mind. After World War II, the brand became spectacularly popular in the United Kingdom and the United States, selling for the same price as a second growth red Bordeaux wine. At its peak of popularity in 1984–1985, annual sales in the US were 1.25 million cases, with another 750,000 cases sold elsewhere. During the 1970s in the USA, a series of radio adverts promoting the wine were produced, featuring Stiller and Meara.Rein, Richard K. \\"Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara Had to Break Out of Their Act to Keep It Together\\" People, May 23, 1977 Their ads were so effective, they boosted sales by 500%. From the late 1980s, and more so in the 1990s, easy-drinking semi-sweet German wines began to decline in popularity. Consequently, the brand's popularity declined, and the wine began to be perceived as tacky and dated. This change was reflected in the drink of choice of a popular fictional over-the-hill British television and radio presenter, Alan Partridge. However, sales increased after Blue Nun was purchased by the Mosel-based German family firm Langguth which bought the previous owners, Sichel, in 1996. They repositioned the brand, reclassifying it from a Liebfraumilch to a regular Qualitätswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete (QbA), changing the grapes from Müller- Thurgau to 30% Riesling, and making it less sweet. It remains relatively low in alcohol at 9.5%. Brand extension From 2001 on, Langguth also embarked on a brand extension, and has introduced several other wines under the Blue Nun name, including a German Riesling ice wine, a Languedoc Merlot and a Spanish rosé. Sales in 2004 rose by 11% in the UK, but from a low base. In 2009, Blue Nun launched Blue Nun Gold, a sparkling wine which contained flakes of 22-carat gold. It was hoped the drink would appeal to young women drinkers and would help position the brand differently.\\"Blue Nun Wine is going for gold\\", MetroOnline, 27 May 2009 References to Blue Nun in popular culture and media In music Afro Celt Sound System, in their song \\"Rise Above It\\" from the album Seed, refer to dancing at gigs with Blue Nun. According to the lyrics of the song, heartburn going cheap is the reward for dancing at gigs with a Blue Nun. The Beastie Boys album Check Your Head includes a musical interlude called \\"The Blue Nun\\", in which a narrator describes a party held in the comfortable study in Peter Sichel's New York townhouse, in which the guests compliment the wine. Peter Sichel was chairman of the Blue Nun company until it was sold in 1995. On The Beatles song \\"Long, Long, Long\\" off the White Album, rattling noises by a Blue Nun wine bottle are heard as a result of a bottle's resting on top of a Leslie speaker, which began to vibrate when Paul McCartney played a certain note on the Hammond organ. It is accompanied by a Ringo Starr drum roll. Steve Jones, guitarist of the Sex Pistols stated in his autobiography Lonely Boy that he drank at least two whole bottles of Blue Nun before the Thames Television Interview with host Bill Grundy dated 1 December 1976.

In television Heston Blumenthal experimented with carbonating Blue Nun using a Sodastream machine in one episode of his novelty cuisine series Heston's Feasts. The programme showed interviews which gave the impression that people either preferred the carbonated wine to genuine champagne or could not tell the difference. On the BBC television series Life on Mars (series two, episode four) Blue Nun is mentioned as the wine which will be served at a party hosted by a wife-swapping couple of which the sleazy husband is a murder suspect. In the television series Phoenix Nights (series 1, episode 4), Brian Potter offers his love interest some Blue Nun. In the television series So What Now?, Lee Evans mentions that he will bring a bottle of Blue Nun to gain access to a party. In the television series Gimme A Break!

It was built on a disused Second World War air base, (RAF Podington), once used by the 92nd Bomber Group. The drag racing venue opened at Easter in 1966, and it is now the home of European drag racing and has grown substantially over its 53-year existence. It hosts both the first and last round of the FIA and FIM/UEM European Drag Racing Championship, along with the British National Drag Racing Championships. Overview It is leased and operated by Trakbak Racing which is based in London. Santa Pod regularly takes its promotional units to major events in motor sport. Santa Pod is the venue at which the current world drag racing record, a time of 3.58 seconds at 386.26 mph (621.61 km/h) was set by Sammy Miller in his Vanishing Point rocket-propelled funny car in July 1984. Another record has also been set at Santa Pod, the world's fastest jet car (notably Santa Pod's \\"resident\\") Fireforce 3 piloted by Martin Hill broke the record in Easter 2005 with a terminal speed of 336.10 mph (540.88 km/h). Several other European drag racing records have been set along with records unsurpassed outside the United States. In May 2010 Top Fuel dragster driver Urs Erbacher set a class speed record with a terminal speed of 314.87 mph reached in less than 5 seconds. At the same race meeting Eric Teboul set a time of 5.23 seconds at 249 mph on his Hydrogen Peroxide Rocket Bike, which he further improved to 5.19 seconds at the European championships in September 2010. In 2012 drag-racer Andy Frost set the record of \`the world's fastest accelerating road-legal car' at the UK's Santa Pod Raceway. Santa Pod for many years remained the fastest all-asphalt dragstrip in the world since most North American tracks are partially or entirely concrete in construction. However during the winter of 2017/2018 the entire length of the track was lifted and replaced with a track constructed entirely in concrete. The reasoning behind this being that concrete gives more consistent times as it, “moves around less” than asphalt. History Podington airfield, near the villages of Hinwick and Podington, was formerly a Second World War airbase. In 1966 permission was obtained to use the airfield as a drag racing complex, the ¾ of a mile main runway being used as the drag strip. Santa Pod was named after Santa Ana Drags, a drag strip in California, USA, and the local village of Podington. Since then the name Santa Pod has become synonymous with the sport of drag racing in Europe. Today the raceway hosts events throughout the year including the FIA European Drag Racing Championships and the 'Run What You Brung' (RWYB) events where anyone with a valid driving licence can have a go and put their own vehicles and skills to the test. This also serves as a \\"grass roots\\" recruitment ground, as many who start by running their road vehicle on the track for bragging rights often progress to the next level and become competitors in National Events after obtaining a licence from the official sanctioning body MSA. The sportsman classes, also very popular with fans, are enriched by this inflow of new racers who fall in love with the sport after a fun weekend in their every day vehicles. Santa Pod Raceway has earned the reputation as the home of European drag racing. Notable events 47-year-old Briton Perry Watkins drove a racing vehicle decorated as a formal dining table complete with tablecloth, chairs, place settings, food and various vessels at Santa Pod in September 2010.

His speech referring to television as a \\"vast wasteland\\" is cited even as the speech has passed its 55th anniversary. While still maintaining a law practice, Minow is currently the Honorary Consul General of Singapore in Chicago. Minow has been active in Democratic party politics. He is an influential attorney in private practice concerning telecommunications law and is active in many nonprofit, civic, and educational institutions. Barack Obama named him a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom for 2016. Background and early law career Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1926, Minow served in World War II from 1944 to 1946 and attained the rank of a sergeant in the U.S. Army. He served in the China Burma India Theater with the 835th Signal Service Battalion headquartered in New Delhi, India. After the war, he received a Bachelor of Science degree in 1949 from Northwestern University and a Juris Doctor degree in 1950 from Northwestern University School of Law. It was possible in the period after the war for law students who had not completed college to be granted a bachelor's degree after a certain period of study in law school. After graduating from law school, Minow worked for the law firm of Mayer, Brown & Platt (1950–1951 and 1953–1955) before becoming a law clerk to Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson of the U.S. Supreme Court (1951–1952). He later became assistant counsel to Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson (1952–1953), worked for Stevenson's two presidential campaigns (1952 and 1956), and then was a partner in the law firm, Stevenson, Rifkind & Wirtz (1955–1961). Minow campaigned for President John F. Kennedy prior to the 1960 presidential election. In 1961 he was appointed by President Kennedy to be one of seven commissioners of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) as well as its chair. Federal Communications Commission Chair Reportedly, Robert F. Kennedy and Minow frequently talked at length about the increasing importance of television in the lives of their children during the presidential campaign of Robert's brother John.Jarvik, Laurence Ariel, PBS, behind the screen, Rocklin, CA : Forum, 1997. Thereafter, it came as little surprise that after the election Minow eagerly pursued the position of FCC Chair. Some observers nevertheless considered it unusual given his lack of experience with the media industry and with communication law. He served as chairman from March 2, 1961 through June 1, 1963. Criticism and evaluation Minow became one of the most well known and respected — if sometimes controversial — political figures of the early 1960s because of his criticism of commercial television. In a speech given to the National Association of Broadcasters convention on May 9, 1961, he was extremely critical of television broadcasters for not doing more, in Minow's view, to serve the public interest. His phrase, \\"vast wasteland\\", is remembered years after the speech in which he said: While some applauded his \\"vast wasteland\\" assault on commercial television as a welcome criticism of excessive violence and frivolity, others criticized it as an elitist, snobbish attack on programming that many viewers enjoyed and as government interference with private enterprise.In her essay \\"Man's Rights\\" (1963), Ayn Rand denounced him personally for having a perverted understanding of freedom of speech and censorship. The S. S. Minnow of the 1964-1967 television show Gilligan's Island was sarcastically named after him to express displeasure with his assessment of the quality of television. cited in In a 2011 speech at Harvard, Minow said that he could never have anticipated the impact of television. He still feels that news is the most important public service, but that television falls short in that area. \\"Too much deals with covering controversy, crimes, fires, and not enough with the country's great issues\\" he said. He also said that presidential campaigns are obsessed with the trivial. The speech came 50 years after he referred to television as a \\"vast wasteland\\" on May 9, 1961. The day after the 1961 speech the New York Times headline read \\"F.C.C. Head Bids TV Men Reform 'Vast Wasteland' — Minow Charges Failure in Public Duty — Threatens to Use License Power\\".James Warren, \\"Never Mind the ‘Vast Wasteland.’ Minow Has More to Say\\", The New York Times, May 7, 2011. Retrieved December 3, 2013. Achievements at the Federal Communications Commission Minow did foster two significant initiatives that altered the landscape of American television. The first was the All-Channel Receiver Act (ACRA) of 1961, which mandated UHF reception capability for all television receivers sold in the United States. This legislation sparked an increase in the number of television stations and helped launch nonprofit educational television stations (now PBS) throughout the country. Minow said his greatest contribution was persuading Congress to pass legislation clearing the way for communications satellites. Minow recounts \\"When I toured the space program with [John F.] Kennedy, he was surprised to see me\\". Minow told Kennedy that \\"communications satellites will be much more important than sending man into space, because they will send ideas into space. Ideas last longer than men.\\" During his two years in office, it was estimated that, other than the president, Minow generated more column inches of news coverage than any other federal official. He also promoted what ultimately became the International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium (Intelsat). This organization controlled satellite communications for many years. Minow's papers from his tenure at the FCC are archived at the Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research, an organization co-sponsored by the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Wisconsin Historical Society.

Subsequent communications work He has been on the Board of Governors of the Public Broadcasting Service and its predecessor, National Educational Television serving from 1973–1980 and serving as its chair from 1978 to 1980. He is a recent past-president of the Carnegie Corporation, an influential PBS sponsor, and the original funder of Sesame Street. He is the Walter Annenberg professor emeritus at Northwestern University, as well as the author of four books and numerous professional journal and magazine articles. Minow has supported and written about the Digital Promise Project, a project to fulfill the educational potential of the internet. Sidley Austin LLP He is senior counsel in the Chicago headquartered law firm of Sidley Austin LLP, a large international law firm with multiple areas of expertise, including telecommunications related law. Between 1965 and 1991, he was a managing partner in the firm before becoming senior counsel in 1991.  Honorary Consul General of the Republic of Singapore  Minow's early contact with Singapore and Singaporean officials was through his law work at Sidley Austin, which opened a Singapore office in 1982. Even when he was FCC Chair, he worried about the increasing export of Hollywood programming overseas and the impact it would have on perceptions of the United States among citizens in other countries. He was appointed Honorary Consul General in 2001. His office processes consular and visa applications.  Contemporary politics  Minow was a prominent supporter of Barack Obama's candidacy for President of the United States. Minow recruited Obama in 1988 to work for his law firm Sidley Austin LLP as a summer associate, where Obama met his future wife Michelle Robinson. Minow pursued Obama on the recommendation of daughter Martha, who was Obama's law professor.  Awards and corporate work  Minow has sat on the Board of Directors at Foote, Cone & Belding Communications Inc.; Tribune Co.; Manpower, Inc.; AON Corp.; CBS, and Sara Lee Corporation. He has been Chairman of the Board at RAND Corporation. He was trustee of the Chicago Orchestral Association as well as with the Mayo Foundation, which operates Mayo Clinic. He is a life trustee of Northwestern University and the University of Notre Dame, where he was the first Jewish member of the board, and he is currently Chairman of the Board of the World Health Imaging, Telemedicine and Informatics Alliance. He co-chaired the 1976 and 1980 presidential debates and is a vice-chair of the Commission on Presidential Debates. He has served on numerous presidential commissions and was chair of a special advisory committee to the Secretary of Defense on protecting civil liberties in the fight against terrorism. His book on the history of the presidential debates was released in 2008. Minow is the recipient of 12 honorary degrees. He was a recipient of the Peabody Award in 1961 and the Woodrow Wilson Award for public service. He was also a member of the Peabody Awards Board of Jurors from 1963 to 1976. Minow was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State's highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 2014 in the area of Government & Law. Between 2015 and 2018, Newton Minow served as a member of the Executive Advisory Council of the American Archive of Public Broadcasting (AAPB), after which, his daughter Mary Minow joined the Council. In 2020, the AAPB launched the 'Broadcasting in the Public Interest: The Newton Minow Collection' to honor Minow's role in developing noncommercial television. The collection includes interviews, panels, testimonies, events, and profiles featuring him between 1961 to 2016. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama on November 22, 2016.http://chicagotonight.wttw.com/2016/11/16/newton-minow-named- presidential-medal-freedom-recipient Personal life He and his wife, Josephine Baskin Minow, have three daughters, all trained as lawyers; Nell Minow, shareholder activist and movie critic; Martha L.

It is surrounded by, but separate from Kakadu National Park, 230 km east of Darwin. The orebody was discovered in late 1969, and the mine commenced operation in 1980, reaching full production of uranium oxide in 1981. It is operated by Energy Resources of Australia, a 68% subsidiary of Rio Tinto Group. Uranium mined at Ranger is sold for use in nuclear power stations in Asia, Europe and North America. The original orebody was completely mined out by the end of 1995, although some ore remains stockpiled. A second orebody (\\"Ranger 3\\") began mining in 1997. Both have been open-pit mines. Open cut mining finished at Ranger in late 2012 and the mine is now processing stockpiled ore. As of 2013, the ageing Ranger mine has been incurring financial losses as a result of the continuing market slump which has followed the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. Water management and waste management continue to be controversial issues. Discovery and operation of the mine Ranger Pit 3, Northern Territory, Australia: Uranium mineralised Cahill-Formation as visible in the pit is unconformably overlain by Kombolgie sandstone forming the mountains in the background The Ranger uranium orebody, the richest in the Southern Hemisphere, was discovered in late 1969, when an aerial radiometric survey conducted by Geophysical Resources Development Co., a company based in Sydney, on contract to Noranda Aluminum, Inc., detected a large spike in gamma radiation when passing over Mount Brockman, known as Djidbidjidbi to the Mirarr traditional owners of the area. The instrument that detected the anomaly was a Nuclear Enterprises gamma ray spectrometer using a Thallium doped Sodium Iodide cylindrical crystal. At time of discovery the aircraft was flying at an altitude of 100 meters. The anomaly could still be detected at almost 3000 feet. The Aircraft was a Britten Norman Islander Registration VH-FLE. The crew members on board were Bill Hay, the pilot, Harvey Morton, the navigator and Frank Lanza, the instruments operator that actually first recognized the significance of the anomaly. The Ranger No. 1 and Ranger No. 3 ore bodies occur in the Cahill Formation, consisting of Lower Proterozoic metasediments, located in the Alligator Rivers Uranium Field. The mine commenced operation in 1980, reaching full production of uranium oxide in 1981. Owing to the environmental sensitivity of the site, a special statutory authority, the Supervising Scientist, was created to provide oversight of the operation and conduct environmental research in the region. Ranger mine covers two of a line of uranium orebodies that extend from near Nourlangie Rock in Kakadu north- eastwards to Koongarra, underneath Mount Brockman, then northwards through the Ranger One line of orebodies (in order Number 2, Number 1, and Number 3), then via Hades Flat, where there is uranium mineralisation, to Jabiluka where the line turns westward through the Barote and Ranger 4 orebodies. The mine covers No 1 Orebody and No 3 Orebody. No 2 orebody was excluded from the mining lease at the request of the traditional owners and included in Kakadu National Park. From Ranger 4 the line again turns northwards and then swings westward round an Archaean basement dome before turning south towards Nourlangie Rock again. Uranium mineralisation is known at several other places along this line but has never been explored in detail because of the creation of Kakadu. The name 'Ranger' for the series of discoveries made by Geopeko Limited, the exploration arm of the Australian mining company Peko-Wallsend Limited, in the period 1969 to 1972, was thought up by Judy Ryan, the wife of the geologist in charge of the program. Koongarra and Jabiluka were retained by the companies that found them: Noranda Australia and Pancontinental Mining respectively, although since sold to other parties. The other discoveries are enclosed in the National Park, locking up an energy source that is estimated to be greater than the oil reserves of Saudi Arabia. (12) Energy Resources of Australia Ltd (ERA) was named Explorer of the Year at the sixth annual Australian Mining Prospect Awards held in Sydney on Wednesday 11 November 2009. During 2008, ERA's exploration programme identified a very significant mineral resource adjacent to the existing Ranger 3 operating pit. The area, known as Ranger 3 Deeps, is estimated to contain 34 thousand tonnes of contained uranium oxide, and ranks among the world's most significant uranium discoveries in recent years.http://www.energyres.com.au/media/38_media_releases_2447.asp Ranger 3 Deeps ERA is constructing a $120 million Ranger 3 Deeps exploration decline to conduct close spaced underground exploration drilling and explore areas adjacent to the Ranger 3 Deeps resource. The Ranger 3 Deeps mineralised zone contains an estimated 34,000 tonnes of uranium oxide, and represents one of the most significant recent uranium discoveries world-wide. In parallel with the construction of the exploration decline, ERA began a $57 million project to prepare a Prefeasibility Study into the potential development of a Ranger 3 Deeps underground mine. This Study will determine the economic viability of the project, optimise mining methods, and confirm metallurgical performance and production rates. Environmental studies will also be conducted. ERA will also consult further with the Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation as a component of a broader social impact assessment.http://www.energyres.com.au/whatwedo/2324_ranger_3_deeps_exploration_decline.asp ERA formally commenced the statutory approval process for the proposed Ranger 3 Deeps underground mine with the submission of a referral to the Commonwealth Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water Population and Communities under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Control Act 1999 in January 2013. At the same time, ERA separately lodged a notice of intent with the Northern Territory Environment Protection Authority under the Northern Territory Environmental Assessment Act.  Ore processing  Ore is ground, then leached with sulfuric acid. Uranium is removed using kerosene with amine then stripped with ammonium sulfate solution and gaseous ammonia. Ammonium diuranate is precipitated by increased pH and converted to uranium oxide (U3O8) in a furnace. In early 2006, ERA announced an expansion to the ore processing plant which will allow production to extend into lower-grade material and in November 2006 the company announced plans to invest in a laterite processing plant, which will allow it to process ore with a high clay content that has been stockpiled since the mine began operating. This ore had been already included in stated reserves. The laterite processing plant will contribute 400 tonnes of uranium oxide per year from 2008 until 2014.  Water management  Water management is a critical component of ERA's business, and between 2009 and 2012, ERA completed water management projects for a total cost of $82 million.Energy Resources of Australia 2012 Annual Report, p. 32 This included surface water interception trenches around stockpiles to protect local waterways, installation of continuous real-time monitoring stations, and additional ground water bores to augment the extensive ground water monitoring programme. In addition, ERA completed a 2.3-metre life of the Tailings Storage Facility, constructed a new pond water retention pond to store up to one gigalitre of pond water, and installed contingency water pumping system between the Tailings Storage Facility and Pit 3. From 2012 to 2014, ERA expects to expend a total of $316 million in various water management projects including the $220 million Brine Concentrator Project. Brine Concentrators use thermal energy to evaporate water, which is subsequently condensed and discharged as clean distilled water. Assembly of the components began in November 2012 and the Brine Concentrator is expected to be commissioned and fully operational in Q3 2013. The Brine Concentrator has the capacity to produce 1.83 gigalitres of clean water per year through the treatment of process water.Energy Resources of Australia 2012 Annual Report, p. 18 Hatch was appointed EPCM contractor for the Brine Concentrator project. It was successfully commissioned in November 2013 with a budget of AUD $220 Million dollars. In 2012, ERA and the Mirarr Traditional Owners represented by the Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation (GAC), conducted a jointly facilitated independent expert review of the quality of surface water around the Ranger Project Area. The Independent Surface Water Working Group consisted of representatives from ERA, GAC, the Supervising Scientists Division and the Northern Land Council. Over a six-month period, the working group examined the impacts, monitoring and reporting of surface water flowing from the Ranger mine. The working group agreed in findings released in March 2013 that the current surface water management and regulatory systems in place at the Ranger mine are of a very high standard.http://www.energyres.com.au/media/38_media_releases_2959.asp Going forward, the Group has agreed upon an action plan to ensure that surface water management systems at Ranger remain best leading practice. Safety breaches and controversy Environment Australia (an agency of the Government of Australia) have documented over 200 environmental incidents since 1979. The great majority of these were minor, but the significant ones are detailed below. In May 2005 the company was convicted for breaching environmental guidelines - the first such prosecution of a mining company in the Northern Territory, relating to accidental radiological exposure to ERA employees.John Carroll v Energy Resources of Australia [2005] NTMC 067 Radiologically contaminated process water had contaminated the drinking water supply and some workers drank and washed in the contaminated water. The maximum radiation exposure of workers was likely to have been much less than the regulatory limit, and no harmful long-term health effects are likely. Other incidents involving decontamination of vehicles have been identified. When the work-for- welfare mechanic in Jabiru opened the engine bay, he was unaware of the nature of the mud and dirt which fell on the floor. The court heard that in the following weeks, after he had swept the material outside his shed, his children played and built sandcastles in mud contaminated with uranium. Another significant controversy over Ranger's environmental impact is the public legal confrontation over releases into Magela Creek in the 1995 wet season. More recently, the ARRAC report from 2002 details a major leak of about 2 megalitres of potentially polluted water, over a number of months. In 2007, water breached a retention pond, overflowing back into the pit. The original authorisation required that this water be contained at all times. In 2006, water management systems were knocked into disarray by Cyclone Monica. In May 2010, it was reported that a tailings dam may have released millions of litres of radioactive water into world heritage-listed wetlands in Kakadu National Park, home to about 500 Aboriginal people. On 7 December 2013 there was an incident at a mine site inside Kakadu National Park, with about a million litres of slurry, comprising crushed ore and acid, believed spilled, workers evacuated and production shut down. A leaching tank containing the slurry burst at about 1am. The spilled material was entirely contained within the safety bunds and no material leaked into the wider ecosystem.

War games One of the oldest and most popular miniatures game genres is that of war games, where figures are arranged into competing \\"armies\\", with figures that represent ranks of troops or individual combatants. Naval wargaming is a variation of play where figures represents ships and do battle on the seas. Early wargames were focused on faithfully recreating historical battles with units represented by chips, blocks, and other abstract markers. The modern genre has expanded to include fantasy and science-fiction settings, often using intricately-detailed and painted miniature figures. Miniatures in role-playing games Tabletop role- playing games evolved from miniatures games, and the two genres have continued to be linked in varying degrees. One of the most cited examples of this connection is Dungeons & Dragons, which developed from a 1971 medieval miniature wargame called Chainmail. The first line of official Dungeons & Dragons miniatures was produced by MiniFigs in 1976, and included iconic creatures such as Demogorgon. While the early editions of Dungeons & Dragons reduced or eliminated the use of miniatures, later versions reestablished their use as a core mechanism of the combat system. This even led full-circle into the development of Dungeons & Dragons Miniatures Game which acted as a stand-alone skirmish game without role-playing elements and as a set of accessories which could be used during Dungeons & Dragons play. Collectible miniatures games As a result of the popularity of the collectible card game (CCG) genre starting in the 1990s, collectible miniatures games were developed that made use of elements of CCGs, such as selling miniature figures in randomized packs, with certain figures being assigned different rarities. This led to a secondary market where figures were resold and valued based on either their utility for play or rarity as a collectible.

The present administrative centre is Keylong in Lahaul. Before the two districts were merged, Kardang was the capital of Lahaul, and Dhankar the capital of Spiti. The district was formed in 1960, and is the fourth least populous district in India (out of 640). Kunzum la or the Kunzum Pass (altitude ) is the entrance pass to the Spiti Valley from Lahaul. It is from Chandra Tal. This district is connected to Manali through the Rohtang Pass. To the south, Spiti ends from Tabo, at the Sumdo where the road enters Kinnaur and joins with National Highway No. 5. The two valleys are quite different in character. Spiti is more barren and difficult to cross, with an average elevation of the valley floor of . It is enclosed between lofty ranges, with the Spiti river rushing out of a gorge in the southeast to meet the Sutlej River. It is a typical mountain desert area with an average annual rainfall of only . The district has close cultural links with Ngari Prefecture of Tibet Autonomous Region.  Flora and fauna  The harsh conditions of Lahaul permit only scattered tufts of hardy grasses and shrubs to grow, even below . Glacier lines are usually found at . Due to certain changes in climate, nowadays people are being able to grow some vegetables in the Lahaul valley e.g. cabbage, potato, green peas, radish, tomato, carrot and all types of leafy vegetables. The main cash crops are potatoes, cabbage, and green peas. The valley has snow leopards, foxes ibex, Himalayan brown bear, Musk Deer, and Himalayan blue sheep. There are two important protected areas in the region that are home to snow leopard and its prey including the Pin Valley National Park and Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary. Animals such as yaks and dzos roam across the wild Lingti plains. However, over-hunting and a decrease in food supplies has led to a large decrease in the population of the Tibetan antelope, argali, kiangs, musk deer, and snow leopards in these regions, reducing them to the status of endangered species. Surprisingly, due to ardent religious beliefs, the locals of Spiti do not hunt these wild animals. Apart from the exotic wildlife, the Valley of Spiti is also known for its wealth of flora and the profusion of wild flowers. Some of the most common species found here include Causinia thomsonii, Seseli trilobum, Crepis flexuosa, Caragana brevifolia and Krascheninikovia ceratoides. Then there are more than 62 species of medicinal plants found here.  People  Mother and child near Gandhola Monastery, 2004 According to the 2011 census Lahaul and Spiti district has a population of 31,564. This gives it a ranking of 638th in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was -5%. Lahul and Spiti has a sex ratio of 903 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 76.81%. At the 2011 census, % of the population in the district had Kinnauri as their first language, % – Pattani, % – Bhotia, % – Hindi, % – Nepali, and % – Tibetan. The language, culture, and populations of Lahaul and Spiti are closely related. Generally, the Lahaulis are of Tibetan and Indo-Aryan, while the Spiti Bhot are more similar to the Tibetans, owing to their proximity to Tibet. The district has a Himachal Pradesh state legislative law in place to curb antique loot, by suspecting travellers given past incidences. In pre-independence era, the ethnic tribal belt was into the British lahaul and the chamba lahaul, which was merged with Punjab post 1947. This is the second largest district in the Indian union. The language spoken by both the Lahauli and Spiti is Spiti Bhoti, a Tibetic language of the Western Innovative subgroup. They are very similar to the Ladakhi and Tibetans culturally, as they had been placed under the rule of the Guge and Ladakh kingdoms at occasional intervals. Among the Lahaulis, the family acts as the basic unit of kinship. The extended family system is common, evolved from the polyandric system of the past. The family is headed by a senior male member, known as the Yunda, while his wife, known as the Yundamo, attains authority by being the oldest member in the generation. The clan system, also known as Rhus, plays another major role in the Lahauli society. The Spiti Bhot community has an inheritance system that is otherwise unique to the Tibetans. Upon the death of both parents, only the eldest son will inherit the family property, while the eldest daughter inherits the mother's jewellery, and the younger siblings inherit nothing. Men usually fall back on the social security system of the Trans-Himalayan Gompas.  Lifestyle  The lifestyles of the Lahauli and Spiti Bhot are similar, owing to their proximity. Polyandry was widely practiced by the Lahaulis in the past, although this practice has been dying out. The Spiti Bhot do not generally practice polyandry any more, although it is accepted in a few isolated regions. Divorces are accomplished by a simple ceremony performed in the presence of village elders. Divorce can be sought by either partner. The husband has to pay compensation to his ex- wife if she does not remarry. However, this is uncommon among the Lahaulis. Agriculture is the main source of livelihood. Potato farming is common. Occupations include animal husbandry, working in government programs, government services, and other businesses and crafts that include weaving. Houses are constructed in the Tibetan architectural style, as the land in Lahul and Spiti is mountainous and quite prone to earthquakes.  Religion  Ki-Gompa, Spiti Most of the Lahaulis follow a combination of Hinduism and Tibetan Buddhism of the Drukpa Kagyu order, while the Spiti Bhotia follow Tibetan Buddhism of the Gelugpa order. Within Lahoul, the Todh-Gahr (upper region of Lahaul towards Ladhakh) region had the strongest Buddhist influence, owing to its close proximity to Spiti. This bas-relief, of marble, depicts the Buddhist deity Avalokiteshvara (the embodiment of the Buddha's compassion) in a stylized seated position; Hindu devotees take it to be Shiva Nataraj, Shiva dancing. This image appears to be of sixteenth-century Chamba craftsmanship. It was created to replace the original black stone image of the deity, which became damaged by art looters. This original image is kept beneath the plinth of the shrine. It appears to be of 12th century Kashmiri provenance. Much of the art thieves are active in this remote belt because of neglected gompas and temples. Raja Ghepan, one of the major deities is greatly worshipped by almost all Lahauli. Before the spread of Tibetan Buddhism and Hinduism, the people were adherents of the religion 'Lung Pe Chhoi', an animistic religion that had some affinities with the Bön religion of Tibet. While the religion flourished, animal and human sacrifices were regularly offered up to the 'Iha', a term that refers to evil spirits residing in the natural world, notably in the old pencil-cedar trees, rocks, and caves. Vestiges of the Lung Pe Chhoi religion can be seen in the behaviour of the Lamas, who are believed to possess certain supernatural powers. The Losar festival (also known as Halda in Lahauli) is celebrated between the months of January and February. The date of celebration is decided by the Lamas. It has the same significance as the Diwali festival of Hinduism, but is celebrated in a Tibetan fashion. At the start of the festival, two or three persons from every household will come holding burning incense. The burning sticks are then piled into a bonfire. The people will then pray to Shiskar Apa, the goddess of wealth (other name Vasudhara) in the Buddhist religion.  Tourism  Key Monastery, is a Tibetan Buddhist monastery located on top of a hill at an altitude of above sea level. The natural scenery and Buddhist monasteries, such as Kye, Dhankar, Shashur, Guru Ghantal, Khungri Monastery in Pin Valley, Tnagyud Gompa of the Sakya Sect in Komic, Sherkhang Gompa in Lahlung (believed to be older than Tabo Monastery), the only Buddhist Mummy of a Monk in Gue around 550 years old and Chandra Taal Lake are the main tourist attractions of the region. One of the most interesting places is the Tabo Monastery, located 45 km from Kaza, Himachal Pradesh, the capital of the Spiti region. This monastery rose to prominence when it celebrated its thousandth year of existence in 1996. It houses a collection of Buddhist scriptures, Buddhist statues and Thangkas. The ancient gompa is finished with mud plaster, and contains several scriptures and documents. Lama Dzangpo heads the gompa here. There is a modern guest house with a dining hall and all facilities are available. Another gompa, Kardang Monastery, is located at an elevation of 3,500 metres across the river, about 8 km from Keylong. Kardang is well connected by the road via the Tandi bridge which is about 14 km from Keylong. Built in the 12th century, this monastery houses a large library of Buddhist literature including the main Kangyur and Tangyur scriptures. The treacherous weather in Lahaul and Spiti permits visitors to tour only between the months of June to October, when the roads and villages are free of snow and the high passes (Rothang La and Kunzum La) are open. It is possible to access Spiti from Kinnaur (along the Sutlej) all through the year, although the road is sometimes temporarily closed by landslides or avalanches.  Buddhist monasteries  Spiti is one of the important centers of Buddhism in Himachal Pradesh. It is popularly known as the 'land of lamas'. The valley is dotted by numerous Buddhist Monasteries or Gompas. Kye Monastery: Kye Monastery is one of the main learning centres of Buddhist studies in Spiti. The monastery is house to some 100 odd monks who receive education here. It is the oldest and biggest monastery in Spiti. It houses rare paintings and scriptures of Buddha and other gods and goddess. There are also rare 'Thangka' paintings and ancient musical instruments 'trumpets, cymbals, and drums in the monastery. Tabo Monastery: Perched at an altitude of 3050 meters, Tabo Monastery is often referred to as the 'Ajanta of the Himalayas'. The 10th century Tabo Monastery was founded by the great scholar, Richen Zangpo. The monastery houses more than 60 lamas and contains the rare collection of scriptures, pieces of art, wall paintings -Thankas and Stucco.  Adventure activities  To-do-Trails: For trekkers, the Spiti Valley is a paradise, offering challenging treks to explore the new heights of the Himalayas. The treks take people to the most remote areas including the rugged villages and old Gompas followed by the exotic wildlife trails. Some of the trekking routes in the area include Kaza-Langza-Hikim-Komic-Kaza, Kaza-Ki- Kibber-Gete-Kaza, Kaza-Losar-Kunzum La and Kaza-Tabo-Sumdo-Nako. There are some very high altitude treks also where you have to cross passes- like Parangla Pass (connecting Ladakh with Spiti Valley), Pin Parvati Pass, Baba Pass, Hamta Pass trek, Spiti Left Bank Trek are few to name. Skiing: Skiing is the popular adventure sports in Spiti. Yak Safari: Yak can be used to see the flora and fauna of trans-Himalayan desert.

It has a programme of contemporary art exhibitions, artist's performance, music and dance events, poetry and book readings, talks, lectures and cinema. There is also a specialist art bookshop and a café bar. Educational activities are undertaken and experimental digital media work supported by online resources. A number of festivals are regularly hosted by the gallery. The gallery was founded in 1961 by Jeremy Rees, and was originally located in Clifton. In the 1970s it moved to Queen Square, before moving to its present location, Bush House on Bristol's waterfront, in 1975. The name of the gallery is taken from Jan van Eyck's 15th-century painting The Arnolfini Portrait. Arnolfini has since been refurbished and redeveloped in 1989 and 2005. Artists whose work has been exhibited include Bridget Riley, Rachel Whiteread, Richard Long and Jack Yeats. Performers have included Goat Island Performance Group, the Philip Glass Ensemble, and Shobana Jeyasingh Dance Company. The gallery reached a new audience in April 2010, when it was chosen to host one of the three 2010 general election debates. History Jeremy Rees started Arnolfini with the assistance of his wife Annabel, and the painter John Orsborn in 1961. The original location was above a bookshop in the Triangle in Clifton, Bristol. In 1968, Rees was able to give up his teaching job and with the aid of private funding and Arts Council funding relocated the gallery to Queen Square, then to E Shed, the current home of the Watershed Media Centre. In 1975, Arnolfini moved to its present home in Bush House, occupying two floors of a 19th- century Grade II* listed tea warehouse situated on the side of the Floating Harbour in Bristol city centre. The remainder of the building was office space leased out by developers JT Group. The architect of Bush House was Richard Shackleton Pope, who constructed first the south part of the warehouse (1831) then extended it to the north in 1835–1836. Its original use was as a warehouse for local iron foundry D., E. & A. Acraman. The building has a Pennant Sandstone exterior with arched ground level entrances and arched windows above. This style of architecture is the first example of the Bristol Byzantine style which became popular in the 1850s. Later conversion to a tea warehouse added interstitial floors. Originally dedicated to exhibiting the work of artists from the West of England, under the directorship of Barry Barker (1986–1991) the gallery moved towards a more general spread of contemporary art. Barker supervised a successful refurbishment of the gallery spaces and café bar by David Chipperfield. Before development work began, Arnolfini was attracting over 285,000 visitors per year. Subsequent Directors have been Tessa Jackson (1991–1999), Caroline Collier (1999–2005) and Tom Trevor (2005-2013). As part of a two-year development project that finished in September 2005, the old warehouse has been fully redeveloped, adding another attic storey. Arnolfini now occupies the lower three floors and basement, and the upper floors are leased to help pay for the running costs. One tenant is the School of Creative Arts, part of the University of the West of England. Funding for this development was received from the National Lottery and the Barker-Mill Trust, set up by long term Arnolfini patron Peter Barker-Mill. The original committee to support Arnolfini included Peter Barker-Mill, Ann Hewer, and Lawrence Ogilvie.Arnolfini archives In July 2015, Bush House was sold to the University of the West of England, with a lease-back of the artistic space. The profits from the sale replenished Arnolfini's endowment fund. Archives Records of Arnolfini, including a collection of artist books, are held at Bristol Archives (Ref. 44371) (online catalogue). Name John Cabot's statue outside the Arnolfini The Arnolfini is named after Jan van Eyck's masterpiece The Arnolfini Portrait (1434) depicting the merchant and arts patron Giovanni Arnolfini. The Arnolfini Portrait is one of the earliest paintings to assert the presence of the artist within its depiction (an inscription in the middle of the work and a reflection in a mirror on the back wall) and one of Arnolfini's consistent concerns: to explore the role of artist as a witness and recorder of what is around them – contemporary society. The painting is in the National Gallery, London and it was one of the founder's favourite paintings. Today Arnolfini has three floors of galleries, a specialist arts bookshop, a cinema which can also be used as a performance space for theatre, live art, dance and music, a reading room that provides reference material for all past exhibitions and wide range of books and catalogues, and a café bar. Entrance to the galleries is free of charge. Notable exhibitions have included works by Bridget Riley, Richard Long, Rachel Whiteread, Paul McCartney, Angus Fairhurst and Louise Bourgeois. Regular events include poetry and film festivals, live art and dance performances, lectures and jazz and experimental music concerts, including Bodies in Flight, Goat Island Performance Group, Akram Khan, the London Sinfonietta, the Philip Glass Ensemble, Random Dance, and Shobana Jeyasingh Dance Company. There is an active access and education programme, hosting visits from students, workshops with artists, presenting interpretative information and offering some work experience placements within the gallery. project.ARNOLFINI is an online experimental web site with dumps of digital media related to Arnolfini exhibitions and events, past and present, which may be reorganised by any online user, utilising resources on the web site to create new works and projects under a copyleft license. Arnolfini also hosts events from outside organisations, including the Encounters Short Film Festival (along with the Watershed Media Centre), Mayfest, the first Festival of British Independent Cinema, the biennial Time Festival of Live Art and Intrigue and the Bristol Artists Book Events. In April 2010, British Sky Broadcasting chose Arnolfini to host the second of the three 2010 general election debates. Arnolfini receives funding from Arts Council England, and Bristol City Council. According to returns lodged with the Charity Commission for the year ending in March 2016, Arnolfini had 500,000 visitors in 2013/2014. Income was £2.1 million and expenditure was £2.7 million and the gallery employed 44 people. In 2017 the Arnolfini, which had asked for increased funding in recent years, will be losing its Arts Council England £750,000 annual grant after an assessment that the Arnolfini was \\"not viable\\" in its current model. In 2017 a new director, Claire Doherty, was appointed. She aimed to devise a viable financial model. A show by Grayson Perry drew in more than 300 visitors a day.

Sun released most of its Java source code as free software in May 2007, so it can now almost be considered a free Java implementation. Java implementations include compilers, runtimes, class libraries, etc. Advocates of free and open source software refer to free or open source Java virtual machine software as free runtimes or free Java runtimes. Some advocates in this movement prefer not to use the term \\"Java\\" as it has trademark issues associated with it. Hence, even though it is a \\"free Java movement\\", the term \\"free Java runtimes\\" is avoided by them. Mid-1990s to 2006 The first free project to offer substantial parts of Java platform functionality was likely guavac, which began some time before November 1995. Since then, the free software movement developed other Java compilers, most notably the GNU Compiler for Java. Others include the Eclipse Java Compiler (ECJ), which is maintained by the Eclipse Foundation, and Jikes, which is no longer actively maintained. Since the GNU Compiler Collection's 4.3 release, GCJ (its Java compiler) is using the ECJ parser front-end for parsing Java. Examples of free runtime environments include Kaffe, SableVM and gcj. GNU Classpath is the main free software class library for Java. Most free runtimes use GNU Classpath as their class library. In May 2005, Apache Harmony was announced, however, the project chose the Apache License, which was at the time incompatible with all existing free Java implementations. Another event in May 2005 was the announcement that OpenOffice.org 2.0 would depend on Java features which free software implementations couldn't provide. Following controversy, OpenOffice.org adopted a guideline requiring it to work with free Java implementations. Notable applications that already worked with free software Java implementations before November 2006 include OpenOffice.org and Vuze, both of which work when compiled with GCJ. Sun's November 2006 announcement On 13 November 2006, Sun released its compiler, javac, under the GNU General Public License.Sun picks GPL license for Java code As of September 2007, as well as javac, Sun has released the code of HotSpot (the virtual machine) and almost all the Java Class Library as free software. Following their promise to release a fully buildable JDK based almost completely on free and open source code in the first half of 2007,OpenJDK FAQ Sun released the complete source code of the Class library under the GPL on May 8, 2007, except some limited parts that were licensed by Sun from 3rd parties who did not want their code to be released under a free software licence. Sun has stated that it aims to replace the parts that remain proprietary and closed source with alternative implementations and make the class library completely free and open source. Since there's some encumbered code in the JDK, Sun will continue to use that code in commercial releases until it's replaced by fully functional free and open-source alternatives. After the May 2007 code release As of May 2008, the only part of the Class library that remains proprietary (4% as of May 2007 for OpenJDK 7, and less than 1% as of May 2008 in OpenJDK 6 ) is the SNMP implementation. Since the first May 2007 release, Sun Microsystems, with the help of the community, has released as free software (or replaced with free-software alternatives) almost all the encumbered code: * All the audio engine code, including the software synthesizer, has been released as open-source.audio-engine project page The closed-source software synthesizer has been replaced by a new synthesizer developed specifically for OpenJDK called Gervill, * All cryptography classes used in the Class library have been released as free software, * FreeType has replaced the code that scales and rasterizes fonts.font-scaler projectpageJava2D project page * LittleCMS has replaced the native color- management system. There is a pluggable layer in the JDK, so that the commercial version can use the old color management system and OpenJDK can use LittleCMS. * The open-sourced Pisces renderer used in the phoneME project has replaced the anti-aliasing graphics rasterizer code.phoneme.dev.java.net/ graphics-rasterizer project page This code is fully functional, but still needs some performance enhancements, * The JavaScript plugin has been open- sourced (the JavaScript engine itself was open-sourced from the beginning). Because of these previously encumbered components, it was not possible to build OpenJDK only with free software components. In order to be able to do this before the whole class library is made free, and to be able to bundle OpenJDK in Fedora Core and other free Linux distributions, Red Hat has started a project called IcedTea. It is basically an OpenJDK/GNU Classpath hybrid that can be used to bootstrap OpenJDK using only free software. As of March 2008, the Fedora 9 distribution has been released with OpenJDK 6 instead of the IcedTea implementation of OpenJDK 7. Some of the stated reasons for this change are: * Sun has replaced most of the encumbrances for which IcedTea was providing replacements (less than 1% of encumbered code remains in the class library, and this code is not necessary to run OpenJDK). * OpenJDK 6 was a stable branch, whereas OpenJDK 7 was unstable and not expected to ship a stable release until 2009. * Sun has licensed the OpenJDK trademark for use in Fedora. In June 2008, it was announced that IcedTea6 (as the packaged version of OpenJDK on Fedora 9) had passed the Technology Compatibility Kit tests and can claim to be a fully compatible Java 6 implementation. In September 2013, Azul Systems released Zulu, a free, open source build of OpenJDK for Windows Server and the Microsoft Azure Cloud. Later releases added support for Mac OS X, multiple versions of Linux and the Java Platform, Standard Edition version 8. Zulu is certified compliant with Java SE 8, 7 and 6 using the OpenJDK Community Technology Compatibility Kit.http://www.azulsystems.com/products/zulu Amazon have released Amazon Corretto a no-cost, multiplatform, production-ready distribution of the Open Java Development Kit. It is released under GPL v2 with the Classpath Exception. Long term support versions of Java 8 and Java 11 are available. It was first publicly released on 31 January 2019.

The position of Minister for Coordination of Defence was a British Cabinet-level position established in 1936 to oversee and co-ordinate the rearmament of Britain's defences. The position was established by Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin in response to criticism that Britain's armed forces were understrength compared to Nazi Germany. This campaign had been led by Winston Churchill, and many expected him to be appointed as the new minister, though nearly every other senior figure in the National Government was also speculated upon by politicians and commentators. Despite this, Baldwin's choice of the Attorney General Sir Thomas Inskip provoked widespread astonishment. A famous remark was \\"This is the most cynical appointment since Caligula made his horse a consul\\".This quote has been made on many occasions and the original source is unclear. The highly influential polemic Guilty Men (which relevant chapter is titled \\"Caligula's Horse\\") attributes it to a \\"great statesman\\" (page 74), whom some have surmised was Churchill. However Stewart, Graham Burying Caesar: Churchill, Chamberlain and the Battle for the Tory Party (London; Phoenix, 1999) (), page 487 attributes the originator of the quote to Churchill's non-politician friend Professor Frederick Lindemann. The appointment is now regarded as a sign of caution by Baldwin, who did not wish to appoint someone like Churchill who would have been interpreted by foreign powers as a sign of the United Kingdom preparing for war, as well as a desire to avoid taking on board a controversial and radical minister. In 1939 Inskip was succeeded by First Sea Lord Lord Chatfield. When the Second World War broke out, the new Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain formed a small War Cabinet, and it was expected that Chatfield would serve as a spokesperson for the three service ministers, the Secretary of State for War, the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for Air; however political considerations resulted in all three posts being included in the Cabinet, and Chatfield's role proved increasingly redundant. In April 1940 the position was formally wound up and the functions transferred to other Ministers. The following month Chamberlain was succeeded as Prime Minister by Churchill, who took the additional title of \\"Minister of Defence\\"; this was, however, a separate office from Minister for Coordination of Defence, though the two titles were frequently used interchangeably.

He is also a screenwriter, with Garrett Lerner, of the 2010 film Repo Men, based on Garcia's novel The Repossession Mambo. Career Garcia attended Cornell University to study English and film, then transferred to the University of Southern California during his junior year. His first novel, Anonymous Rex was published in 1999. The second novel in the Rex series, Casual Rex, was published in 2001, and was a prequel to Anonymous Rex, a fact which was not on the book flap. The inclusion of characters in Casual Rex who were dead in Anonymous Rex confused many fans, who assumed that the book was a sequel. In 2002, Random House published Matchstick Men, a novel completely different from Garcia's prior work. Warner Brothers had already purchased the film rights and signed Ridley Scott as the director, with Nicolas Cage, Sam Rockwell and Alison Lohman as the film's stars. The film version, released in September 2003, received good reviews but was an average performer at the box office. 2004 was a busy year for Garcia.

In the United States, a railway post office, commonly abbreviated as RPO, was a railroad car that was normally operated in passenger service as a means to sort mail en route, in order to speed delivery. The RPO was staffed by highly trained Railway Mail Service postal clerks, and was off-limits to the passengers on the train. In the UK and Ireland, the equivalent term was Travelling Post Office (TPO). From the middle of the 19th century, many American railroads earned substantial revenues through contracts with the U.S. Post Office Department (USPOD) to carry mail aboard high-speed passenger trains; and the Railway Mail Service enforced various standardized designs on RPOs. In fact, a number of companies maintained passenger routes where the financial losses from moving people were more than offset by transporting the mail. History The world's first official carriage of mail by rail was by the United Kingdom's General Post Office in November 1830, using adapted railway carriages on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Sorting of mail en route first occurred in the United Kingdom with the introduction of the Travelling Post Office in 1838 on the Grand Junction RailwayJohnson 1995. following the introduction of the Railways (Conveyance of Mails) Act 1838. In the United States, some references suggest that the first shipment of mail carried on a train (sorted at the endpoints and merely carried in a bag on the train with other baggage) occurred in 1831 on the South Carolina Rail Road. Other sources state that the first official contract to regularly carry mail on a train was made with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in either 1834 or 1835. The United States Congress officially designated all railroads as official postal routes on July 7, 1838.White, p 472. Similar services were introduced on Canadian railroads in 1859.White, p 473 The first RPO (1862) The Railway post office was introduced in the United States on July 28, 1862, using converted baggage cars on the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad (which also delivered the first letter to the Pony Express). Purpose-built Railway Post Office (RPO) cars entered service on this line a few weeks after the service was initiated. Their purpose was to separate mail for connection with a westbound stagecoach departing soon after the train's arrival at St. Joseph. This service lasted approximately one year.White, p 475. The first permanent Railway Post Office route was established on August 28, 1864, between Chicago, Illinois, and Clinton, Iowa. This service is distinguished from the 1862 operation because mail was sorted to and received from each post office along the route, as well as major post offices beyond the route's end-points. George B. Armstrong, assistant postmaster at Chicago, originally came up with the idea of having mail processed and distributed while the mail was on board, en route in mail cars. With the assistance of Schuyler Colfax, Speaker of the House at the time, and A. N. Zevely, Third Assistant Postmaster General, he was duly authorized to test his ideas.CATSKILL ARCHIVE: GEORGE B. ARMSTRONG Great Northern Railway #42, a restored RPO on display at the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento. In 1869, the Railway Mail Service (RMS), headed by George B. Armstrong, was officially inaugurated to handle the transportation and sorting of mail aboard trains. Armstrong was promoted from a supervisory position in the Chicago post office following his experiments in 1864 with a converted route agent's car on runs between Chicago and Clinton, Iowa.White, pp 475-476. RPO car interiors, which at first consisted of solid wood furniture and fixtures, would also soon be redesigned. In 1879, an RMS employee named Charles R. Harrison developed a new set of fixtures that soon gained widespread use. Harrison's design consisted of hinged, cast-iron fixtures that could be unfolded and set up in a number of configurations to hold mail pouches, racks and a sorting table as needed for specific routes. The fixtures were also designed so they could be folded away completely to provide a wholly open space to carry general baggage and express shipments as needed by the railroads. Harrison followed through with manufacturing his design at a factory he opened in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin in 1881.White, pp 481-482. The July 1, 1862, Pacific Railroad Act signed by President Lincoln established government funding for the construction of a railroad from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean with the express idea of opening a main line mail route across the western frontier. The act was officially entitled \\"AN ACT to aid in the construction of a railroad and telegraph line from the Missouri river to the Pacific Ocean, and to secure to the government the use of the same for postal, military, and other purposes,\\" The Act opened the door to government funded railroad mail routes across the American continent.Central Pacific Railroad Photographic History Museum Chicago and North Western in 1965. By the 1880s, railway post office routes were operating on the vast majority of passenger trains in the United States. A complex network of interconnected routes allowed mail to be transported and delivered in a remarkably short time. As many as a dozen clerks might work in a single RPO car, although fewer would be required if part of the car was used for transport of previously sorted mail or (often in a separate compartment) express and baggage. Railway mail clerks were subjected to stringent training and ongoing testing of details regarding their handling of the mail. On a given RPO route, each clerk was expected to know not only the post offices and rail junctions along the route, but also specific local delivery details within each of the larger cities served by the route. Periodic testing demanded both accuracy and speed in sorting mail, and a clerk scoring only 96% accuracy would likely receive a warning from the Railway Mail Service division superintendent. Interurban and Streetcar systems were also known to operate RPOs. The Boston Elevated Railway car being noted as making circuits of the city to pick up mail.Trolley Car Treasury by Frank Rowsome Jr. McGraw-Hill New York 1956 Library of Congress 56-11054 In the United States, RPO cars (also known as mail cars or postal cars) were equipped and staffed to handle most back-end postal processing functions. First class mail, magazines and newspapers were all sorted, cancelled when necessary, and dispatched to post offices in towns along the route. Registered mail was also handled, and the foreman in charge was required to carry a regulation pistol while on duty to discourage theft of the mail. Standardization Interior of Great Northern Railway Post Office Car 42 at the California State Railroad Museum Because of the physical and mental demands placed on RPO clerks, the Railway Mail Service pushed the adoption of standardized floor plans and fixtures for all RPO cars, with the first plans published in 1885. The RMS also pressed for improved lighting fixtures to help the clerks see the addresses on the mail they sorted, first by improving the reflectors in the 1880s, then calling for discontinuance of oil lamps in the 1890s and the first experiments with electric lighting in 1912. Clerks' safety was also of great concern to the RMS, with the first comprehensive statistics on work-related injuries published in 1877.White, p 482. Through the second half of the 19th century, most RPO cars were painted in a somewhat uniform color scheme regardless of the railroad that owned or operated them. Most were painted white with trim in either buff, red or blue, which made the cars stand out from the other cars. By the 1890s, this practice had waned as railroads painted their RPO cars to match the rest of their passenger equipment. One RPO car that was displayed at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago is one of the last known examples of the early white color scheme.White, p 480. As the development of passenger cars progressed, so too did the development of RPO cars. The first plans for RPO car designs were based on light baggage car frames and bodies, which sometimes resulted in catastrophe for RMS employees when the trains were involved in accidents. From 1900 to 1906 some 70 workers were killed in train wrecks while on duty in the RPOs, leading to demands for stronger steel cars.Daily Mirror March 16, 1906 p6 Last night's news The RMS developed its first standards for car design in 1891 to address some of these issues.White, p 483. In 1912, the Railway Mail Service developed a set of strength requirements for new cars in an effort to push the car building companies into using steel for the cars' major structural components and underframes. The core of the requirements was that each car should be able to withstand a buffer force of at least 400,000 pounds. This requirement was doubled to 800,000 pounds in a 1938 revision of the standards. The requirements were again strengthened in 1945 with specifications that precluded the use of aluminium for framing and major structural components. The 1945 revisions also included a requirement for end posts to prevent telescoping in the event of a collision. Car manufacturers adopted these requirements and carried them through to all other models of passenger cars that they built.White, p 190. The 800,000 lb buffer load and end post requirements were later adopted by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) for all passenger MU locomotives as of April 1, 195649 CFR Part 229.141, 2015 edition (10-1-2015) https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2015-title49-vol4/xml/CFR-2015-title49-vol4-sec229-141.xml and to all passenger cars and locomotives in 1999 by the USDOT.49 CFR Part 238, Subpart C, U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Railroad Administration, 2015 edition https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2015-title49-vol4/xml/CFR-2015-title49-vol4-part238-subpartC.xml An interesting feature of most RPO cars was a hook that could be used to snatch a leather or canvas pouch of outgoing mail hanging on a track-side mail crane at smaller towns where the train did not stop. The first US patent for such a device () was awarded to L.F. Ward of Elyria, Ohio, on January 29, 1867.White, p 476. With the train often operating at 70 mph or more, a postal clerk would have a pouch of mail ready to be dispatched as the train passed the station. In a co-ordinated movement, the catcher arm was swung out to catch the hanging mail pouch while the clerk stood in the open doorway. The mail pouch had a strap around the middle, and the strap was tightened in preparation for pickup with an approximately equivalent weight of mail in either end of the pouch to prevent the heavier end from pulling the lighter end off the catcher arm. As the inbound pouch slammed into the catcher arm, the clerk kicked the outbound mail pouch out of the car, making certain to kick it far enough that it was not sucked back under the train. Outbound pouches of first class mail were sealed with a locked strap for security. Larger sacks with optional provisions for locking were used for newspapers, magazines, and parcel post. An employee of the local post office would retrieve the pouches and sacks and deliver them to the post office. In the 1950s the Budd Company offered two versions of its self-propelled diesel RDC with RPO: the RDC-3 combine and the RDC-4 (a baggage/mail/express only unit). These models were purchased by the New York Central, Boston & Maine, New Haven Railroad, Rock Island, Pacific Great Eastern, Northern Pacific, Canadian Pacific Railway, Canadian National and Minneapolis & St. Louis.Budd Company Red Lion Plant Order List, Philadelphia Chapter of the National Railway Historical Society. http://www.trainweb.org/phillynrhs/BuddCarOrders.html File:CBQ 1926 20050716 Illinois Railway Museum.jpg|Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad #1923, a heavyweight RPO preserved at the Illinois Railway Museum.

Cancellation stamps Most RPO cars had a mail slot on the side of the car, so that mail could actually be deposited in the car, much like using the corner mail box, while the train was stopped at a station. Those desiring the fastest delivery would bring their letters to the train station for dispatch on the RPO, knowing that overnight delivery would be virtually assured. The mail handled in this manner received a cancellation just as if it had been mailed at a local post office, with the cancel giving the train number, endpoint cities of the RPO route, the date, and RMS Railway Mail Service or PTS Postal Transportation Service between the killer bars. Collecting such cancellations is a pastime of many philatelists and postal history researchers. The Railway Mail Service organization within the Post Office Department existed between 1864 and September 30, 1948. It was renamed the Postal Transportation Service on October 1, 1948, and existed until 1960. After 1960, the management of railway post office routes as well as Highway Post Office routes, Air Mail Facility, Terminal Railway Post Office, and Transfer Office, were shifted to the Bureau of Transportation. Decline and withdrawal At their height, RPO cars were used on over 9,000 train routes covering more than 200,000 route miles in North America. While the majority of this service consisted of one or more cars at the head end of passenger trains, many railways operated solid mail trains between major cities; these solid mail trains would often carry 300 tons of mail daily.As the United States Postal Service undergoes its fiscal crisis in the second decade of the 21st Century, it is well to note that these are not entirely new problems. A national pick up and delivery system to remote and small locales is a fiscally challenging model. \\"A Congressional Investigation of the United States Post Office Department in 1900 disclosed that postal expenditures were not and, in some cases, could not be apportioned to revenues. A remarkable anomaly in Maine, at the intersection of mail bags and a printing press, provided, at the time, a basis for costing questions of policy and regulation and, for us now, an understanding of the postal commons in its Golden Age.\\" R.P.O. postal cancellation applied to mail handled in the railway post office car of Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway's Nashville & Memphis train No. 5, the inaugural eastbound run of the City of Memphis.Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Railway: The Dixie Line by Charles B. Castner, Jr. page 92 After 1948, the railway post office network began its decline although it remained the principal intercity mail transportation and distribution function within the Post Office Department (POD). There were 794 RPO lines operating over 161,000 miles of railroad in that year. Only 262 RPO routes were still operating by January 1, 1962. In 1942, the POD began experimenting with a highway version of the RPO to serve the same purposes along routes where passenger train service was not available. These highway post office (HPO) vehicles were initially intended to supplement RPO service, but in the 1950s and 1960s, HPOs often replaced railway post office cars after passenger train service was discontinued. The last interurban RPO service was operated by Pacific Electric Railway on its route between Los Angeles and San Bernardino, California. Cover carried on the last day of RPO service between New York and Washington, June 30, 1977When the post office made a controversial policy change to process mail in large regional \\"sectional centers,\\" mail was now sorted by large machines, not by people, and the remaining railway post office routes, along with all highway post office routes, were phased out of service. In September 1967 the POD cancelled all \\"mail by rail\\" contracts, electing to move all First Class mail via air and other classes by road (truck) transport. This announcement had a devastating effect on passenger train revenues; the Santa Fe, for example, lost $35 million (US) in annual business, and led directly to the ending of many passenger rail routes. After 113 years of railway post office operation, the last surviving railway post office running on rails between New York and Washington, D.C. was discontinued on June 30, 1977. The last route with a railway post office title was actually a boat run that lasted a year longer. This Boat Railway Post Office was the Lake Winnipesaukee RPO operating between The Weirs, New Hampshire, and Bear Island on Lake Winnipesaukee. The final date it operated with a postmark was September 30, 1978.  Preservation  The RPO section of preserved Texas Electric Railway Car 360, at the Interurban Railway Museum in Plano, Texas Many RPO cars have been preserved in railroad museums across North America; some of the cars are kept in operational condition. In 1933, Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad rebuilt one of its baggage cars into a replica of the first RPOs that were used on the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad in 1862. The railroad displayed the car in several cities along the railroad; it now resides at the Patee House Museum in St. Joseph, Missouri. The Minnesota Transportation Museum (MTM) maintains Northern Pacific #1102, a 1914 Mail RPO, that is classed as a \\"combine\\" car, having sections for the RPO, Railway Express Agency and twenty seats for paying passengers. Currently, it is the only Railway Post Office car known to be operational and currently certified for operation on commercial rail. The Osceola and St Croix Valley Railway (division of MTM/reporting mark MNTX) operates the car as part of its tour line, actually \\"catching the mail on the fly\\" as a part of its regular runs. As part of the 40th anniversary of the end of RPO service, Minnesota Transportation Museum will be placing #1102 on display at Saint Paul Union Depot as part of its \\"Last Mail Train\\" for National Train Day, 6 May 2017. At the end of the day, Great Northern 400, Northern Pacific Railway RPO #1102 and two coaches will be departing Union Depot as Train #1 bound for Osceola, Wisconsin. It will be hauling commemorative envelopes and cards to be sent all across the United States, following which it will operate in regular service as part of the Museum operations out of Osceola, WI. Steamtown National Historic Site in Scranton, PA has RPO car #1100, Louisville & Nashville, on display. It is an all-steel car built in 1914 by the American Car and Foundry Company.

The objective of the game is to become the fastest driver in the world by racing other drivers across several nations. The franchise is unrelated to the TV series of the same name. It marks the first game in the Top Gear racing game franchise, and it is one of the first racing games to be released on the Super NES. This game and its next two sequels were created by the same developers as the similar Lotus series of games released earlier on the Commodore Amiga and Sega Mega Drive systems.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. When players first start the game, they are given several options to choose from, including entering their name, a choice of four different controller layouts, a choice between automatic or manual transmission, and their choice of four unique cars. During the race, the player will have to steer and shift gears (if they chose a manual transmission). The player is also given control over three \\"nitros\\", which allow the player to increase their speed for a short period of time. The game features a password save system, made up of automotive terms such as \\"gear box\\" and \\"oilcloth\\". Each password grants access to another country to race in. During the race, there are pits in which players must stop in order to refuel. If their car runs out of fuel and coasts to a stop before the race is finished, the player will be disqualified.  Development and release  The music in Top Gear mostly consists of remixed tracks from the Lotus series of racing games on the Amiga produced by Barry Leitch. For example, the title music of Top Gear is taken from the ending of Lotus Turbo Challenge 2, and the third race of each country uses a remixed version of the Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge title theme. The game, along with several other retro titles, was released by Piko Interactive on a multi-cart for the Evercade handheld gaming system in 2020.  Reception  Top Gear was met with positive reception from critics and reviewers alike since its release.  Legacy  The game became very popular in Brazil. It inspired Brazilian company Aquiris Game Studio to create the arcade racing game Horizon Chase - World Tour, which features an original soundtrack scored by Top Gear composer Barry Leitch, who also contributes an unlockable remix of the Top Gear main title theme.

His era name means \\"Perpetual calendar\\". Zhu Youlang was the son of Zhu Changying (朱常瀛), the seventh son of the Wanli Emperor. He inherited the title Prince of Gui (桂王) from his brother and lived an obscure life as a minor member of the extremely large imperial family until the fall of Beijing and the suicide of Chongzhen, the last Ming emperor, in 1644 due to the rebellion of Li Zicheng's Shun dynasty and Zhang Xianzhong after Li Zicheng took Beijing. The true beneficiaries of the collapse of the Ming were the Qing dynasty which was founded by the northeastern Manchu Aisin Gioro family that rapidly conquered northern China, the Lower Yangtze valley, and Central China after mass defection from Ming remnants including Wu Sangui who let the Qing through the Great Wall to fight Li Zicheng. Descendants of the Ming continued to hang on in the south, and Youlang ascended the throne as the fourth Southern Ming emperor, with the reign-title Yongli in November 1646. Through the efforts of Polish Jesuit Michał Boym, many members of his family converted to Christianity. By 1661, pressed back into Yunnan province, he fled to Burma. A Qing Han Banner army led by Wu Sangui followed and captured him there, and he was executed in June 1662. History Historical background In April 1644 the last Ming emperor to rule all China committed suicide as a rebel army entered Beijing. Six weeks later, on 5 June, the army of the Manchus, a people from beyond the Great Wall, entered the city and proclaimed the end of the Ming and the beginning of the Qing. In the following two years, as the Qing extended their control over northern China, the remaining Ming loyalists attempted to regroup in the south, but in rapid succession the Hongguang, Longwu, and Shaowu emperors were captured and executed. Campaigns in southern China Zhu Youlang became \\"Caretaker of the State\\" on 20 November 1646, following the death of the Longwu emperor. When Longwu's brother then declared himself emperor with the reign-title Shaowu, Youlang himself ascended the throne (24 December 1646) as Yongli emperor. A brief war between the two emperors ended a month later when the Qing captured and executed Shaowu. The continuing military pressure of the Qing forced Youlang to withdraw further into the south and west, first to Guilin in Guangxi, then to Jiangxi and Hunan, then south again to Nanning in Guangxi. He had a number of experienced and devoted followers, but became increasingly reliant on the military support of local warlords and bandit chieftains. The best and most effective of these was Li Dingguo, who for five years was highly successful in enlarging Southern Ming territories in the southwest. This success, however, caused the Qing to place the entire region in the hands of the extremely capable Hong Chengchou, who was named governor-general of five provinces. By 1658 Youlang had been forced back into Yunnan, on the very edge of China's southwestern frontier. Flight and exile in Burma The flight of Prince Gui, the last ruling descendant of the Ming dynasty, who reigned as the Yongli Emperor. The borders shown here are those of provinces in the People's Republic of China. In 1658 Zhu Youlang retreated to Kunming in Yunnan, from where he sought refuge under the protection of Pindale Min (1608–1661), ninth king of the Taungoo dynasty of Burma. Pindale gave him permission to live at Sagaing, near the Burmese capital of Ava (both near the modern Burmese city of Mandalay), provided his men surrendered their weapons. He finally fled into Burma in 1661. It soon became apparent to the Burmese that Zhu Youlang intended to carve himself a kingdom in Burma, and war broke out between the exiled prince and his hosts. The Chinese devastated the land around Ava but failed to capture it, thanks to the defence offered by Pindale's mercenary Portuguese artillery (led by a mysterious Mi-thari Kattan, which might be a Burmese attempt at an otherwise unknown \\"Mister Cotton\\"). Pindale's attempt to profiteer from the resulting famine led to his overthrow by his brother and chief general, Pye Min (meaning \\"Prince Pye\\"), in May 1661. Pye broke the siege and demanded that all the Chinese, with the exception of Youlang himself, swear allegiance to the king of Ava, after which they would be dispersed through the kingdom. The ceremony at which this was to be carried out turned into a disaster, with the Chinese, fearing that the plan was to murder them all, turning on the Burmese. Pye now ordered all the Chinese, again with the exception of Youlang, to be put to death. At this point, in December 1661, a Qing army of 20,000 under Wu Sangui entered Burma and demanded the surrender of Youlang. Pye summoned his advisors, who pointed out that both the Burmese and the Chinese had previously delivered up persons to each other. In addition, Wu Sangui's army was large, and the Burmese had already suffered enough from the presence of their guest.The Asiatic Journal and Monthly Register, pp.188-190 Accordingly, on 22 January 1662, the last monarch of the Southern Ming, together with his sons and grandsons, were put on boats and forwarded to Wu Sangui's camp near Ava. Thinking that he was being taken to his longtime military protector Li Dingguo, the forlorn emperor only realized his real destination when he arrived at Wu's camp. Cited in Death Zhu Youlang, Prince of Gui and last serious claimant to the Ming throne, was delivered into the custody of Wu Sangui, a Chinese general who had once served the Ming, and Manchu prince, general, and high minister of state, Aisingga. He was transported to Yunnanfu, the capital of Yunnan, where in June he was personally strangled by Wu Sangui. Wu had played a major role in the overthrow of the dynasty, having opened the gates in the Great Wall to the Qing and later leading the Qing campaign against the Southern Ming. It is said that Youlang scorned Wu in his last moments, saying that he betrayed his people and country, and urged Wu to kill him faster because he was disgusted to see \\"a traitor's face.\\" The last Ming dynasty Princes who held out against the Qing after Zhu Youlang were the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Hónghuán w:zh:朱弘桓 who accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan. Zhu Shugui acted as his representative in the Kingdom of Tungning and performed rites in his name until 1683.

Biography She was born in Exmouth, Devon into a family of Plymouth Brethren. Her mother died when she was fourteen and it affected her entire life and the way she saw death. Patricia Beer was strongly influenced by the Plymouth Brethren Church, a loosely structured, fundamentalist sect. She attended Exmouth Grammar School before reading English at Exeter University. Beer moved away from her religious background as a young adult, becoming a teacher and academic. She took her B.Litt at the University of Oxford following which she spent seven years in Italy where she taught English Literature at the University of Padua, the British Institute and the Ministero Aeronautica in Rome. She began to write poetry after World War II, while living in Italy; she is most often classified as a 'New Romantic' poet comparable to John Heath-Stubbs. On her own account, however, there is a discontinuity in her work. Devon is a major presence. Beer returned to England in 1953 where she became Senior Lecturer in English at Goldsmiths' College at the University of London (1962-1968). From the later 1960s she wrote full- time. She edited several significant anthologies, broadcast, and contributed to literary reviews. She was married twice; first in 1960 to the writer P. N. Furbank, and then in 1964 to John Damien Parsons, an architect, settling in Upottery, near Honiton, England.

Part II\\", Fark OOD, Sofia, 2001. pp.22-23, 28-29. (bilingual: Bulgarian/English) Polish Air Force operated 15 Albatros C.III in 1918-1920 during Polish-Soviet War. Construction Like the Albatros C.I, the C.III was a popular aircraft with rugged construction and viceless handling. The most prominent difference between the two was the revised vertical stabilizer. The C.III had a lower, rounded tail compared to the large, triangular tail of the C.I, which, combined with smaller weight, gave the C.III greater agility. The power plant was either a 110 kW (150 hp) Benz Bz. III or a 120 kW (160 hp) Mercedes D.III inline engine and, like numerous other two-seaters used during the war (such as the British Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8) the cylinder head and exhaust manifold protruded above the front fuselage, limiting the pilot's forward visibility. The observer, who occupied the rear cockpit, was armed with a single 7.92 mm (0.312 in) Parabellum MG14 machine gun. C.III aircraft were typically fitted with a gun synchronizer and a single forward-firing 7.92 mm (0.312 in) LMG 08/15 machine gun. The C.III could also carry a bomb load of up to 90 kg (200 lb) in four vertical tubes in the fuselage or external racks.Grosz (1989), p.11,13,18 Between 1926 and 1927, two Mercedes D.III engined copies were built from saved parts and components of the destroyed aircraft by Bulgarian state aircraft workshops DAR as the DAR 2 for use as trainers.Bernád 2001, pp. 24–25.Y.

He was made an Officer of the Order of Canada on December 20, 1968. Leclerc was posthumously inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame for his songs \\"Moi, mes souliers\\", \\"Le P'tit Bonheur\\" and \\"Le Tour de l'île\\" in 2006. History Félix Leclerc was born in La Tuque, Quebec, Canada in 1914, the sixth in a family of eleven children. He began his studies at the University of Ottawa but was forced to stop because of the Great Depression. Leclerc worked at several jobs before becoming a radio announcer in Québec City and Trois-Rivières from 1934 to 1937. In 1939, he began working as a writer at Radio-Canada in Montréal, developing scripts for radio dramas, including Je me souviens. He performed some of his earliest songs there. He also acted in various dramas, including Un Homme et son péché. He published a number of scripts and founded a performing company which presented plays throughout Québec. In 1950, he was discovered by Paris impresario, Jacques Canetti, and performed in France to great success. He signed a recording contract with Polydor Records. He returned to Québec in 1953. In 1958, he received the top award of the Académie Charles Cros in France for his second album. He was invested into the Order of Canada in 1971, the National Order of Québec and became a Chevalier of the French Légion d'honneur in 1986. Leclerc was the father of three children: the photographer and cameraman Martin Leclerc, film director Francis Leclerc and Nathalie Leclerc, general and artistic director of l’Espace Félix-Leclerc and vice-president of the Fondation Félix-Leclerc. He died in his sleep in Saint-Pierre-de-l'Île-d'Orléans, Québec, in 1988. A monument in his memory was constructed there in 1989. A house which he occupied from 1956 to 1967 (and where his son Martin stayed with his mother for another year) is also a museum in his honor in Vaudreuil-Dorion, west of Montréal. Leclerc played a major role in revitalising the Québec folk song (\\"chanson\\") tradition. He also was a strong voice for Québec nationalism. Several parks, roads, and schools in Québec have been named in his honor. The Félix Awards, given to Quebec recording artists, are named after him. In 2000, the Government of Canada honored him with a postage stamp. His semi- autobiographical novel Pieds nus dans l'aube was adapted by his son, filmmaker Francis Leclerc, as the 2017 film Barefoot at Dawn.\\"«Pieds nus dans l’aube» — La poésie de l’enfance\\".

The Nazi government's concerns about degenerate music were a part of its larger and better-known campaign against degenerate art (). In both cases, the government attempted to isolate, discredit, discourage, or ban the works. Racial emphasis Jewish composers such as Felix Mendelssohn and Gustav Mahler were disparaged and condemned by the Nazis . In Leipzig, a bronze statue of Mendelssohn was removed. The regime commissioned music to replace his incidental music to A Midsummer Night's Dream . Though the Nazis wanted to discredit Jewish artists because of their race, they also wanted to have a better reason. The excuse was that some music was “anti-German” and that was why some songs needed to be banned. The certainty of this philosophy was contrasted by the inability to say what counted as “anti-German”. Many people, like Goebbels, could not point to what was German music and what had a “Jewish influence”. Goebbels, who was not a musician nor had any expertise in the subject, said “all music was not suited for everyone\\" File:Mendelssohn Bartholdy.jpg|Portrait of Felix Mendelssohn by the English miniaturist James Warren Childe (1778–1862), 1839 File:Photo of Gustav Mahler by Moritz Nähr 01.jpg|Gustav Mahler, photographed in 1907 at the end of his period as director of the Vienna Hofoper File:Schiele - Bildnis des Komponisten Arnold Schönberg. 1917.jpg|Arnold Schoenberg, by Egon Schiele, 1917 File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2005-0119, Kurt Weill.jpg|Kurt Weill in 1932 The Nazis also regulated jazz, including the banning of solos and drum breaks, scat, \\"Negroid excesses in tempo\\" and \\"Jewishly gloomy lyrics\\" . Discrimination From the Nazi seizure of power onward, these composers found it increasingly difficult, and often impossible, to get work or have their music performed. Many went into exile (e.g., Arnold Schoenberg, Kurt Weill, Paul Hindemith, Berthold Goldschmidt); or retreated into \\"internal exile\\" (e.g., Karl Amadeus Hartmann, Boris Blacher); or ended up in the concentration camps (e.g., Viktor Ullmann, or Erwin Schulhoff). Like degenerate art, examples of degenerate music were displayed in public exhibits in Germany beginning in 1938. One of the first of these was organized in Düsseldorf by Hans Severus Ziegler, at the time superintendent of the Weimar National Theatre, who explained in an opening speech that the decay of music was \\"due to the influence of Judaism and capitalism\\". Ziegler's exhibit was organized into seven sections, devoted to : # The influence of Judaism # Arnold Schoenberg # Kurt Weill and Ernst Krenek # Minor Bolsheviks (Franz Schreker, Alban Berg, Ernst Toch, etc.) # Leo Kestenberg, director of musical education before 1933 # Hindemith's operas and oratorios # Igor Stravinsky From the mid-1990s the Decca Record Company released a series of recordings under the title \\"Entartete Musik: Music Suppressed by the Third Reich\\", covering lesser-known works by several of the above-named composers.

Biography Robert Laxalt was born in 1923, a decade and a half after his father Dominique Laxalt and his mother Theresa Laxalt had emigrated to the United States in 1906 to herd sheep. His brother Paul Laxalt later became Governor of Nevada (1967–1971) and then a United States Senator (1974–1986). After graduating from Carson City High School, Robert Laxalt attended Santa Clara University and then the University of Nevada at Reno. Robert Laxalt began his writing career as a journalist working for United Press International, before starting his own news service in Nevada in the 1950s. In 1957, Laxalt published his second book Sweet Promised Land, which was widely read and remains his best-known work today. This book tells the story of Laxalt journeying with his father back to France. Laxalt later published over a dozen books, among which several (like Sweet Promised Land and The Basque Hotel) are biographical or semi-fictional accounts of his family's history. In 1961, Robert Laxalt founded the University of Nevada Press and served as its first editor.About the University of Nevada Press. Retrieved 24 November 2019 Basque identity From the Basque Oral History Project:Oral Histories, Jon Bilbao Basque Library, University of Nevada, Reno Libraries :Laxalt brought Basque identity to the forefront of those living in the Western States. Born on a livestock ranch during the Great Depression, he saw his father went out on the road doing whatever he could to make a living cause the depression. His mother heard that there was a Basque hotel in Carson City for sale called the French Hotel. The business went pretty well and even during Prohibition the hotels served wine. The clientele were more American than Basque. The politicians took a liking to Paul at the time, said he'd be governor some day. Eventually his father bought some ewes again and started buying private land so he would be able to run his sheep. He never wanted to be big again, because it was too risky. In the hotel there were also many miners, prospectors and buckaroos. In town, the Basques would wear their best suits every day. His father almost went crazy staying in the hotel, wanted to be outside in the mountains running sheep and cattle. :They knew most of the other families in the area, would travel around all the time. His father had only one American sheepherder, but he lost sheep. The significance of the Basque hotels were that they were a home away from home for the sheepherders, where they could speak Basque, play cards and have good food. About the herders, what they did and how they felt about their lifestyle. Who were the best sheepherders according to someone, scots and irishmen but the Basques would always stay with the sheep and never leave them.

Structure  The bridge crosses the River Liffey at a point known as the Strawberry Beds. On the motorway it starts at a point approximately 2 km south of junction 6 (Blanchardstown) and runs to a point almost immediately north of junction 7 (Palmerstown). It is 385 metres long, and at its highest elevation it is approximately 42 metres above the river. Figures from 2005 indicated that the bridge was carrying an average of 98,000 vehicles per day. The bridge is the only Liffey crossing between Chapelizod and Lucan Bridge (both of which are narrow two-lane structures) and thus it carries a large amount of traffic passing between the north and south Dublin suburbs.  Tolling system  Since 30 August 2008, tolling has been by means of number plate recognition via overhead gantries. Since 2013, the toll is €2.10 for cars on a tag account, €2.60 for cars whose number plates have been registered with eFlow on a video account, and €3.10 for unregistered cars. Unregistered vehicles can pay at Payzone outlets, by calling eFlow customer service or by paying on the eFlow website. Drivers who fail to pay receive escalating fines, depending on how long the toll remains unpaid. Prior to 29 August 2008, tolling was usually by cash payment at a toll plaza to the former operators NTR plc. A prepaid tag system, Eazy Pass, was also used since the early 2000s but was not barrier-free unlike the present arrangements. The tolling remains a single point operation. History The bridge was constructed as part of the first phase of the M50 motorway, and it and the section of motorway associated with it (junctions 6-7) were the first section of the M50 to open in 1990. Built by NTR plc (then called National Toll Roads plc) under a deal with Dublin County Council, the bridge was an early example of public private partnership (although that term was not used at the time) and was the first section of toll motorway to open in the State. In return for constructing and maintaining the bridge NTR received the right to operate it as a toll bridge for thirty years. Originally a single span structure, a second span was completed and opened in September 2003. In 2007, the National Roads Authority reached a deal with NTR to buy out the toll bridge effective 1 August 2008. However, for traffic management purposes, a toll remained, a situation prompting widespread and ongoing criticism. NTR continued to operate the bridge until 29 August 2008 when, at midnight eFlow took over. The toll plaza barriers were at that point replaced by overhead gantry based electronic tolling.

Fort Breendonk was originally built for the Belgian Army between 1906-13 as part of the second ring of defenses of the National Redoubt protecting the important port-city of Antwerp. It was covered by a five-metre thick layer of soil for defense against bombings, a water-filled moat and measured . During World War II, the fort was requisitioned by the Germans as a prison camp for detaining Belgian political dissidents, resistance members,and Jews. Although technically a prison rather than a concentration camp, the Fort was infamous for its prisoners' poor living conditions and for the use of torture. Most prisoners who were detained at the camp were later transferred to larger concentration camps in Eastern Europe. Of the 3,590 prisoners known to have been imprisoned at Breendonk, 303 died or were executed within the fort itself but as many as 1,741 died subsequently in other camps before the end of the war. Today, the site is a national memorial and museum which is open to the public. Construction and military use Modern aerial photograph of Fort Breendonk, from the north. The earth which originally covered the Fort's structure was removed by the prisoners under German supervision Fort Breendonk was originally built by the Belgian Army in 1906–13 as part of the second ring of defenses of the National Redoubt protecting the important port-city of Antwerp. It was covered by a five-metre thick layer of soil for defense against bombings, a water-filled moat and measured . It saw military service after the German invasion of Belgium in World War I. The siege of Antwerp begun in September 1914 and Breendonk came under fire from German howitzers out of range of its own guns on 1 October. However, the Germans successfully breached the Belgian line at Lier and were able to capture the city without making an assault on Breendonk. The fort's garrison surrendered on 9 October 1914. Breendonk was used briefly in World War II but was already militarily obsolete. During the German invasion of Belgium in May 1940, it served as the initial headquarters of the Belgian General Staff under King Leopold III but was abandoned as the Germans advanced. The Belgian Army surrendered on 28 May 1940, beginning a period of German occupation which lasted until September 1944.  German prison camp: Breendonk I  Breendonk was occupied during the campaign of May 1940 and soon transformed into a prison camp which was controlled by SS and other security agencies of Nazi Germany—Sicherheitspolizei (SIPO) and Sicherheitsdienst (SD) in particular—although Belgium itself was under military (Wehrmacht) jurisdiction and controlled by General Alexander von Falkenhausen. Administration and inmates On 20 September 1940, the first prisoners arrived. Initially most of the prisoners were petty criminals, people deemed anti-social, or who did not conform to the German race laws. Later on, resistance fighters, political prisoners and ordinary people captured as hostages were detained as well. Another section was used as a transit camp for Jews being sent to death camps in Eastern Europe such as Auschwitz-Birkenau. The camp was guarded by Flemish collaborationist paramilitaries as well as German SS units. Of the 300 prisoners that died in the camp itself, 185 were executed; many of the rest died of torture, disease or exposure. Most of those that did survive were transported to concentration camps. The German execution poles and gallows, as well as the torture chamber, are preserved in the current museum on the site. Between 3,500 and 3,600 prisoners were incarcerated in Breendonk during its existence, of whom 1,733 died before liberation. About 400-500 were Jews. Most of the non-Jewish prisoners were left-wing members of the Belgian resistance or were held as hostages by the Germans. In September 1941, the Belgian Communist prisoners held at Breendonk were deported to Neuengamme concentration camp. Jewish prisoners in Breendonk were segregated from other prisoners until 1942. Thereafter, Jews were transferred to the nearby Mechelen transit camp and deported to the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp in Nazi-occupied Poland. Daily life in the camp View of Breendonk's courtyard where roll-calls were held Upon arrival at the camp, new inmates were brought to the courtyard where they would have to stand facing the wall until they were processed into the camp. They were forbidden to move and any motion was severely punished. In the camp, punishment consisted of beatings, torture in the old gunpowder magazine, hanging or execution by firing squad. Inmates were forced to watch any executions that took place. The camp commander Lagerkommandant Philipp Schmitt was known to set his German Shepherd dog (called \\"Lump\\") loose on the inmates. His wife was also known to wander the camp, ridiculing the inmates and ordering punishments at whim. Severe and arbitrary beating occurred daily. During winter 1942-1943, after the German defeat at Stalingrad, it occurred more than once that inmates, mostly Jewish, were forced by the Flemish SS guards to enter into the extremely cold water of the moat and kept there with a shovel. The victims gradually sank or fell into the mud and most of them, after a struggle that could last for over 15 minutes, finally drowned. The prison's gallows, built by the Germans, are preserved in the current museum All the prisoners were subjected to forced labour. The camp authorities wanted the earth that had covered much of the Fort to be removed and shifted to build a high bank around the camp to hide it from outside view. In the few years Fort Breendonk was used by the Nazis, of soil covering the fort were removed by the prisoners by hand at a gruelling pace. Prisoners only had hand tools to complete this enormous task and the soil had to be transported to the outer wall via hand carts on a narrow gauge railway system. The ground in the camp was often very soggy causing the rails to sink away in the mud. Prisoners were then expected to move by hand the carts filled with dirt, pushing and dragging them back and forth over a distance of more than 300 meters. This regime was imposed for over 12 hours a day, seven days a week, even in the worst of weather conditions. Orders were given only in German, so inmates were forced to learn the basic commands rather quickly or otherwise be punished for failure to obey orders. Prisoners were also forced to salute and stand to attention every time a guard passed. Accommodation in the fort consisted of the old barracks. Built from thick stone, without windows and with only minimal ventilation, these were extremely cold and damp. Each barrack room only had a small coal burning stove, and providing sufficient heating was nearly impossible. Rooms were originally designed for no more than 38 people, but frequently housed over 50 inmates sleeping in three-tier bunk beds on straw mattresses. The top bunks were highly prized. Inmates only had a single small bucket per room for a toilet during the night, and many of the sick and weakened inmates simply allowed their waste to drop down to the lower levels. This caused much fighting between inmates, which was probably what the guards wanted. View of the Fort's entrance Prisoners were allowed to use the toilet in the given order only twice a day. There were two gathering spaces inside the fort, east and west, each one with a small building, made of brick and without doors, equipped with four holes and one urinal. Only in 1944 a greater facility was added. But to go to the toilet was always done under surveillance, in group and in a hurry: an additional opportunity for the guards to intimidate and humiliate the prisoners. Jewish prisoners were segregated from other inmates and housed in specially constructed wooden barracks. These barracks were poorly insulated and over-crowded. Other prisoners were housed in cells, either in small groups or individually. The aim was to isolate certain prisoners for later interrogation and torture. Food was severely rationed for the prisoners and distributed in different quantities to the various types of inmates. Jews received the least food and water. Prisoners were served three meals a day. Breakfast consisted of two cups of a coffee substitute made of roasted acorns and of bread. Lunch was usually 1 litre of soup (mostly just hot water). Supper was again 2 cups of a coffee substitute and of bread. This was far from enough to sustain a human being, especially considering the intense cold or heat, harsh labour and physical punishments the prisoners were subjected to. View of an interrogation cell This harsh treatment of prisoners started to leak outside the Fort to such a degree that the head of the administrative staff of the Military Governor of Belgium Eggert Reeder was compelled to order an inspection of the Fort because Von Falkenhausen \\"did not want the camp to become known to history as the hell of Breendonk\\". But the respite was short lived also because the SS seized and forwarded to Germany most of the food parcels sent in by the Red Cross. Conditions in the camp were so cruel and harsh that those who left alive were so weak that their chances of survival at the final destination were severely hampered. Often prisoners were so sick and weak that they were led straight to the gas chambers or simply died within weeks of their arrival. The regime in the camp was at least as harsh as in an actual concentration camp. On 4 September 1944 the SS evacuated the Fort, and all the remaining prisoners were sent to Buchenwald concentration camp. Fewer than 10 percent of the inmates survived the war. Particular controversy surrounds the Flemish SS guards of the camp, who so openly and cruelly turned against their fellow countrymen in support of their Nazi paymasters. Notable inmates Famed author, philosopher, and journalist Jean Améry (formerly Hans Mayer) was captured by the Nazis in July 1943 while fighting with Belgian Resistance. He was subsequently sent to Fort Breendonk, where he was severely tortured before being sent to Auschwitz.Susan Derwin, \\"What Nazi Crimes against Humanity Can Tell Us about Torture Today,\\" in Speaking about Torture, ed. Julie A. Carlson and Elisabeth Weber (New York: Fordham University Press, 2012), 75. Améry discussed his experiences in a book he wrote about the dehumanization that occurred between victim and perpetrator during the Holocaust, a work he entitled At the Mind's Limits. Comics artist Marc Sleen also spent time in Breendonk, together with his brother, because his third brother was a member of the resistance. The Nazis hoped to hear them out about the whereabouts of their brother, but they never betrayed him. As a consequence Sleen, his brother and other prisoners were put in a death cell, where one of them was shot every day. By the time it was Sleen's turn he was lucky that D-Day had occurred, causing a mass panic among the prison guards. They took every prisoner with them to another camp, where Sleen was able to escape. Yet he would suffer post-traumatic nightmares about these experiences for the rest of his life.Smet, Jan, en, Auwera, Fernand, \\"Marc Sleen\\", Standaard Uitgeverij, 1985. The artist Jacques Ochs was interned in Breendonk from 1940 to 1942, when he managed to escape. A few of the drawings he made during his time there had survived. He used them after the war to reconstruct scenes of life in the camp, and in 1947 published those in the book Breendonck – Bagnards et Bourreaux (\\"Breendonck – Slave Laborers and Hangmen\\").  Allied prison: Breendonk II  Belgian collaborators under guard at Breendonk after the liberation The officer of the British Army designated to liberate the camp late in 1944 was Charles Arnold-Baker, a German and officer in MI6. After VE Day, Eileen Younghusband, a WAAF officer and fluent French-speaker, acted as a guide to RAF personnel visiting the camp. She had been in Germany prior to the start of the war, and had encountered fleeing Jews. During the German bombing of Britain, she had been a radar filter officer giving warning of air raids. When the German V-2 ballistic missile attacks on London and elsewhere began in 1944, she was sent to Belgium with mathematicians to help locate V-2 launch sites. Fort Breendonk was briefly repurposed as an internment camp for Belgian collaborators. This period of the Fort's existence is known as \\"Breendonk II\\". The internees were moved to Dossin Barracks, Mechelen, on 10 October 1944. Later significance War crimes trials Trials of the Flemish SS guards, considered Nazi collaborators, were held during 1946 in Mechelen and including some guards and officials at Fort Breendonk. Of those who were convicted, 18 Martin Gilbert-Second World War were sentenced to be executed by firing squad in 1947, two of which appealed their case and had their sentences revised to life imprisonment. Four others were sentenced to life in prison, one to 20 years in prison, and one other was acquitted, and two guards who were sentenced to life were never found. The Nazi camp commandant, Philipp Schmitt, was tried in Antwerp in 1949; he was sentenced to death and was shot by a firing squad on 9 August 1950. He never showed any remorse and denied all of the atrocities that occurred at Breendonk, claiming he was merely re- educating the inmates as he had been ordered. Museum and memorial The Political Prisoner (1947) by Idel Ianchelevici at Breendonk In 1947 Fort Breendonk was declared to be a national memorial, recognizing the suffering and cruelty that had been inflicted on Belgian prisoners during World War II. The fort is now a well-preserved example of the prison camps operated by Nazi Germany and a national museum. The Fort is open to visitors all year round and is located close to the A12 Brussels-Antwerp motorway. Pictures of working Nazi internment camps during the war are rare and, for a long time, it was believed that absolutely no pictures of Breendonk during the war existed. But in the early 1970s a batch of photos of the camp was discovered in the possessions of Dutch photographer Otto Spronk. He had collected thousands of pictures and films of the Third Reich as part of his work for the Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary Society (Cegesoma). The collection consisted of 37 pictures depicting daily life in the camp. They were taken by German Nazi photographer Otto Kropf for propaganda purposes but were never used. All pictures are essentially cliche stills; none of the daily atrocities or horrors of the camp are shown. But they are the only reference material available. Several of the inmates on the pictures managed to survive the war and were able to identify the others on the pictures and the circumstances in which they were taken.

The word leone is Italian for lion. It was released as a replacement to the Subaru 1000 and was the predecessor to the Subaru Impreza. All Leones were powered by the Subaru EA boxer engine. Most cars were equipped with optional four-wheel drive. At the time of its introduction, the Leone was Subaru's top model until 1989, when the larger Legacy was introduced. Although released in Japan and some export markets as the Leone, for many years, this was the only vehicle sold internationally by Subaru where the smaller kei cars Rex, Vivio, R-2, 360, and Sambar were not commonly sold. As a result, in major markets such as Australia, Europe and North America, it was instead identified with a trim level designation, some of which included: DL, GL, GLF, GLF5, GL-10, and RX. The car is thus often referred to simply as the Subaru GL or the Subaru L series.  First generation  The first generation Leone was released on October 7, 1971 as a front-wheel drive coupé, with trim levels DL, GL and GSR. April 1972 saw the introduction of the two- and four-door sedans with trim levels DL, GL and in Japan, the Super Touring. At its introduction, the Leone was Subaru's largest car, and was the top level vehicle above the kei car Subaru Rex. In September 1972 the four-wheel drive (4WD) station wagon (A67) was released, however it did not appear in the United States until 1974 as a 1975 model. The Leone was introduced before the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo to emphasize its durability in adverse weather conditions. Up until this time four-wheel drive had been limited mainly to off-road vehicles, although the very expensive Jensen FF had been built in limited numbers. Subaru broke this pattern by introducing a mass-produced four-wheel drive passenger car, after having tested the waters by building a limited series of four-wheel drive FF-1 1300G wagons in 1971. Four-wheel drive was Subaru's most notable feature during the 1970s and 1980s, leading to particularly strong sales in places like Switzerland and Colorado. The Leone competed with the Toyota Corolla, Nissan Sunny, Honda Civic, Mazda Familia, Isuzu Gemini, and the Mitsubishi Lancer. The Leone introduced a Subaru tradition of frameless side windows for all models. In August 1968, Subaru entered into an alliance with Nissan Motors. The appearance of the new Leone was influenced by the design efforts from Nissan, especially the long hood and short trunk appearance that Nissan was using at that time for their own products. The 1400 RX coupé was one of the first Japanese automobiles to be equipped with four-wheel disc brakes. The two-door hardtop (with different bodywork than the two-door sedan or two-door coupé) was introduced in June 1973 and a 4WD sedan (A27) in 1975. In the Japanese market, the sedan had to be equipped with the SEEC-T desmogged EA71 engine producing , whereas the station wagon was classified as a commercial vehicle and thus received an engine with . The Leone was originally equipped with a 1.2- or a 1.4-litre flat-four, carbureted, OHV engine. The 1,100 cc engine from the earlier FF-1 G was carried over for the Leone 1100 van in the Japanese domestic market, but was only available in the first few years. In September 1975, as a response to tightening emissions regulations, the 1.2 was removed from the sedan lineup (although it continued to be available as a van-wagon version in the Japanese domestic market). To be able to offer as much power as the pre-smog 1.4 a bigger, 1.6-litre version was added for 1976. The Leone was available with a four-speed manual transmission, a five-speed manual transmission, and also a three-speed automatic transmission beginning in 1975. Some early models had duo-servo drum brakes at the front, however, later models were equipped with disc brakes. All models originally had rear drum brakes except the RX coupés. Unusually, the handbrake or emergency brake operated on the front wheels. In March 1977 an updated Leone range was released. All body panels were altered slightly and the overall look was 'smoother' and more contemporary in appearance. A completely new dashboard with altered interior were also part of the update. Despite these changes the overall effect was similar to the earlier version and it was mechanically identical, with the exception of the rear track which was widened by . The chassis codes were changed, with sedans now in the 30 series and estates in the 60 series. The little 1.2 continued to be available in the lowliest standard van model, with . In November 1977 a new top model arrived, the Leone Grand Am-T, which adopted the federalized safety bumpers and had an interior \\"inspired by American tastes.\\" The Leone entered Australia and New Zealand in 1973, with cars imported fully assembled from Japan. The 4WD Wagon entered the Australian market in 1975, and remained the only vehicle in its class until the early 1980s. Many versions - sedan, wagon and Brumby (BRAT) coupe utility, were also assembled from CKD kits, from 1978, in New Zealand by then-importer Motor Holdings' Waitara plant near New Plymouth. Local assembly ceased when the Legacy range replaced the Leone in 1993.

In 1976 the EA63 engine was replaced with the 1.6 liter EA71 engine. The EA71 engine was originally installed in cars equipped with automatic transmission but eventually supplanted the EA63 across the entire range of vehicles in the US and Australia. Using Subaru's new SEEC-T technology meant that a catalytic converter was not necessary, lowering cost and enabling the use of leaded fuel. Power in 49-state (US) trim was at 5200 rpm (two horsepower less in California), although drivability and gas mileage suffered distinctly from the emissions equipment. The Wagon was also available with four-wheel drive, beginning with the 1977 model year.R&T; Buyer's Guide 1979, p. 120 A print ad for the 1973 Subaru GL coupé referred to the engine as \\"quadrozontal\\" The large bumpers required in the United States sat on hydraulic units; these were not a part of the original design and thus intruded considerably into the luggage compartment.Subaru DL 4-door sedan, p. 188 Late in 1977 saw the introduction of the Subaru BRAT as a 1978 model. This was a two-seater body with a pickup truck bed, with two seats welded into the bed to evade the so-called chicken tax on light commercial vehicles. It brought the U.S. lineup to eight models in three trim levels. Most were in the volume DL trim except a base two-door, and the GF hardtop and 4WD models which shared a higher specification. For 1979, a decontented DL 4WD wagon and Brat were added along with fancier GL four-door sedan and 2WD wagon models bringing the total to twelve, the original fully equipped 4WDs also getting the DL designation. The original Brat was updated for 1981 with a dual-range 4WD transmission and the 1.8-litre EA81 engine. This was sold alongside the second generation Leone (introduced in 1979) until the 1982 model year.  Second generation  In June 1979 the Leone saw its first complete model update. This generation was released with a two-door hardtop coupé, four-door sedan, station wagon and a three-door hatchback. Export sales began in the fall with the 1980 model year. The earlier two-door sedan was replaced by a three-door hatchback design (\\"Swingback\\" in Japan), as an alternative to contemporary hatchback competitors. The Swingback, however, differed from its competitors in offering the option of four-wheel-drive. New for this generation was a dual-range four-speed 4WD transmission with both hi/lo range gearing and manual ride height adjustment on the 4WD models.http://www.cars101.com/oldsubaru.html In November 1981 Subaru introduced Japan's first all-wheel-drive vehicle with an automatic transmission, utilizing the world's first \\"wet hydraulic multi-plate clutch\\". This allowed the driver to engage 4WD with a simple push of a button rather than shifting a lever as in the manual models. The electric switch activated a solenoid that pushed the clutch plates together, thereby engaging the driveshaft to the rear wheels. A new 1.8 L EA81 engine was added to the lineup from the beginning. In November 1983, a turbocharger with optional multi-port fuel injection was also added to the BRAT and Turbo Wagon models. They were only available with an automatic transmission and 3.70:1 gearing. In Japan the top-spec 1800 GTS sedan was the first Subaru to offer air conditioning, power windows, and power steering. The installation of a turbocharger was to provide better fuel economy by reducing emissions and burning fuel more effectively as opposed to providing a performance oriented product, due to taxes levied by the Japanese Government on a graduated scale based on the emissions emitted from the car. Export markets This generation of hatchback and BRAT were made alongside the third-generation offerings until 1987 for the BRAT in the United States (1993 in some markets and 1994 in Latin America) and 1989 for the hatchback. All other second generation models were discontinued by 1985. ;United States In the United States, up-level trim vehicles could be identified by headlights – early GLs had square while others had round; later GLs had quad square headlights and lower series had single squares, with 1982 being a transition year (2WD GL=quad square, 4WD GL=single square with third light, all DLs=single square, STD hatchback=single round). 1980–1982 models also featured an optional third headlight hidden behind the grille logo, using a similar approach used by Chrysler in the late 1960s called the Super-Lite. The logo moved up and out of the way when the driver activated a switch on the dash, revealing the extra headlight and activating it when the high-beams were illuminated. ;Australia Australian buyers originally only received the option of a 1.6-liter engine coupled with a four-speed manual transmission.Boyce, p. 162 It was available as a four-door sedan or as a 4WD wagon.

The BRAT was developed directly from the company's four- wheel drive station wagon model and was first introduced as a 1978 model – following the concept of coupe utilities such as the Chevrolet El Camino and the Ford Ranchero. The Brat was also known as Brumby, MV or Shifter depending on where it was sold. American versions also had carpeting and welded-in rear- facing jumpseats in the cargo area – serving actually to circumvent a tariff known as the Chicken tax. Although the BRAT could fairly be called a truck, the plastic seats in the cargo bed allowed Subaru to classify the BRAT as a passenger car. Passenger cars imported into the US were charged only a 2.5% tariff, compared to 25% on light trucks. The BRAT was restyled in 1981 and the jumpseats were discontinued after the 1985 model year. The BRAT was introduced with a rise in popularity of small trucks being sold in the United States, primarily from Toyota, Nissan, and Mazda. Production continued into 1994 but ceased to be imported to North America in 1987. It was also known as the Brumby in Australia and New Zealand and the Shifter in the UK. Imports to Europe, Australia (from 1978), and New Zealand continued until February 1994. The BRAT was not sold in Japan and was manufactured for export markets. All BRATs had four-wheel drive and the Subaru EA engine. Early models received a 1.6L EA-71 whereas 1981 and later models received a 1.8 L EA-81 engine. 1983 and 1984 models could be purchased with an optional 94 hp (70 kW) turbocharged engine. Manual transmissions were standard on all models and an automatic transmission was available on turbocharged BRATs. 1980 and earlier models had a single-range transfer case, while 1981 and later GL models had a dual range transfer case (DLs still had single range) and all turbocharged models were equipped with an automatic transmission with single range push-button four- wheel drive. In 2003, Subaru tried this approach again but with a 4-door model, based on the second generation Subaru Outback platform called the Subaru Baja.  Third generation  On July 16, 1984, the Leone saw its second major redesign. This generation was released with a three-door hatchback, four-door sedan and a continuation of the popular station wagon body style. This generation Leone made its way to the United States in 1985. The hatchback was hamstrung by a very high rear cargo lip, but did receive a split folding rear seat. In Europe, the range was 1.3 DL, 1.6 DL, 1.6 GL, 1.8 DL, and 1.8 GL 4WD. There were also Turbo versions, with in catalyzed specifications. Not all versions were offered in all countries. In North America, the 1.6-liter engine was dropped completely from the lineup, due to its lack of power. The 1.3 was only available in select markets. For 1987, the Leone received a facelift with a smoothed out appearance. A new 1.8-liter SOHC engine, EA-82 was offered instead of the OHV 1.8-liter flat-four engine. The engine was available with a carburetor, single point fuel injection, multi-port fuel injection, or multi- port fuel injection with a turbocharger. From 1988 this generation saw the availability of a full-time 4WD manual transmission or a full-time 4WD four- speed electronically controlled automatic transmission. Other options found in the third generation Leone were a full digital instrument panel; self diagnostic computer, travel computer, cruise control and pneumatic suspension with selectable height,(previous generations 4WD models had manual height adjustment). The performance oriented three-door RX was introduced in 1987, equipped with the EA82T turbo engine mated to a five speed manual transmission with synchronized dual-range and a manually-locking center differential). It had a 3.70:1 rear Limited Slip Differential, rally tuned suspension, four wheel disc brakes, power windows, A/C, central locking differential, adjustable seats and steering wheel, split fold-down rear seats, and hill holder. Weight was . An AT version was introduced in 1989, its final year of production. Only 2,600 were made. From September 1989 until 1993, the van version was also provided to Isuzu as the \\"Geminett II\\" under an OEM deal. By 1990 the Leone name continued to be used in Japan but was now known as the Loyale in Chile, the United States and Canada; the L-Series in Europe and Australia, and as the Omega in New Zealand where the third generation was the last to be assembled locally by Motor Holdings at Waitara. The popularity of the Leone wagon was ceded to the new, larger, Legacy wagon in 1989 and was ultimately replaced by the Impreza in 1994. The Impreza was introduced with a 'hatch like' wagon which was reminiscent of the first and second generation Leone wagons.

Drivers for individual rallies included Ari Vatanen, Per Eklund, Shekhar Mehta, Mike Kirkland, Possum Bourne, Frank Tundo, Harald Demut and Chilean driver Jose Antonio Celsi. Mike Kirkland finished 6th overall and won the A Group at the 1986 Safari Rally. That year Subaru was one of the only manufacturers combining 4WD and turbo. Jose Antonio Celsi finished eight in the 1986 Marlboro Rally Argentina and fifth in the 1988 Marlboro Rally Argentina. During 1989 Subaru entry two works RX Turbo for Jose Antonio Celsi and Possum Bourne. Celsi finished fourth, but retired on the final road section and Bourne retired during the first stage. Subaru changed the rally model to Legacy RS for the 1990–1992 period and took part in the first complete season in the World Rally Championship with the same model in 1993.  Leone Delivery Van  Introduced in August 1994, the Subaru Leone Van was a badge engineered version of the Nissan AD van for light commercial uses. The Leone's successor Legacy and Impreza did not compete in this segment. It was sold in two generations until the 2001 model year. In March 2001, sales of the Leone Van ended. The Sambar, which had grown larger due to changes in mini vehicle standards, was beginning to compete with the Leone Van. The name of \\"Leone\\" ended after three decades. At the same time, it meant Subaru's withdrawal from the small truck market.

His most significant biography was the well-received life of his friend E. M. Forster.  Career  After Reigate Grammar School, Furbank entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge. After graduating with a First in English, he served in the army. He became a corporal in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers and was in Italy in 1945. He returned to Emmanuel as a teaching Fellow in 1947. While in Cambridge Furbank became a close friend of the novelist E. M. Forster, and also of the mathematician Alan Turing, whose literary executor he would become. Furbank moved to London in 1953 and worked as an editor and librarian. He contributed reviews to The Listener. In 1972 he became a professor of the Open University In 1960 in London he married the poet and critic Patricia Beer. The marriage was dissolved by 1964 when she remarried. Works Furbank's best known work was his sympathetic and widely acclaimed biography E. M. Forster: A Life. Forster had recognised that a biography was inevitable and had originally asked the novelist William Plomer to write one. Plomer found it impossible to describe Forster's sexuality and Furbank was asked instead. Forster's old college, King's College, made Furbank a fellow for the two years before Forster's death in 1970 to support the writing and the biography was published in two parts in 1977 and 1978. Furbank won a Truman Capote Award for Literary Criticism for his Diderot: A Critical Biography (1992). He also edited the works of Daniel Defoe and made major contributions to the question of attributions to Defoe in A Critical Bibliography of Daniel Defoe, The Canonisation of Daniel Defoe, and A Political Biography of Daniel Defoe all co-written with W. R. Owens. Furbank also helped oversee the publication of Alan Turing's collected works.

Family and education Humphrey Spender was the third son of Harold Spender, a journalist and writer. Humphrey's mother, Violet Schuster, came from a German family who had emigrated to Britain in the 1870s. Violet died in 1921 and Harold Spender died in 1926. Humphrey had two brothers, the poet Stephen Spender and the scientist and explorer Michael Spender, and one sister, Christine. As a child, Humphrey learnt photography from his older brother Michael Spender and was given a handsome German camera for his tenth birthday. After attending Gresham's School, Spender initially studied art history at Freiburg University for a year, where he spent time with his brother, Stephen Spender, and other literary figures including Christopher Isherwood. During this period he gained exposure to continental European avant-garde photography and film. He enrolled at the Architectural Association School of Architecture, but became disinclined to practice as an architect. Soon after graduating from the school Spender decided to make a career in photography. Career He went on to set up a photography studio on the Strand with Bill Edmiston, who was his lover. Spender was renowned for his commercial photography. During this time he took photographs for advertisements as well as magazines like Harper's Bazaar. In the mid-1930s, he was recruited to work for the Daily Mirror under the nickname 'Lensman'. Spender became a member of the Mass Observation movement, taking pictures of daily life in working class communities. His most famous photographs are of the 'Worktown Study'. (Worktown was the Mass Observationist's codename for Bolton).http://boltonworktown.co.uk/ Taken in a period between 1937 and 1940, his photographs cover the full range of Mass-Observation’s interests – politics and elections; religion; street scenes; industrial landscapes; the public house; market scenes; new buildings and developments; observers in action; sport and leisure time; work in the textile mills; on holiday in Blackpool; street hoardings and advertisements. Spender was joined in this project by the artist, Graham Bell.Toward the end of his involvement with Mass Observation, Spender also took on work as a photographer for the recently established, highly successful photographically illustrated magazine Picture Post. With the coming of World War II, Spender served briefly in the Royal Army Service Corps before being appointed an official war photographer. He also worked as an interpreter of photo-reconnaissance pictures, identifying German rocket sites and making maps for D-Day. In December 1944 during World War II, Spender was staying at the Hotel Gruenwalder in Innsbruck, Austria as part of his reconnaissance work with the Royal Army Service Corps. On 17 December, Spender encountered Heinrich Himmler, the notorious head of the Nazi SS who had arrived at the hotel unannounced armed with a team of soldiers. Himmler was seated at a table when Spender walking past, was asked to approach him and speak in German. Because of his mothers German-Jewish ancestry and his time spent in Germany, Spender luckily was conversant in the language and quietly left the hotel unnoticed. Otherwise it would have meant certain death for him because of his background. Spender also recounted a time he heard Adolf Hitler speak at a public gathering in Berlin in 1939. He said his voice was \\"very powerful and commanding\\". In about 1955 he abandoned photography for painting and textile design, and taught at the Royal College of Art from 1953 until he retired in 1975. In 1968, Spender moved to Maldon, Essex, where he lived at The Studio, Ulting. This was the first built design by architect Richard Rogers. Marriages Spender's first wife, Margaret Low, with whom he adopted a son, died in 1945. His second wife, Pauline Wynn, with whom he had a son, died in 2003. He then married the photographer Rachel Hewitt, who was more than fifty years younger. Spender had told his wives before marrying them that he was bisexual, like his brother Stephen Spender, and he had affairs with both men and women throughout his life, including Frederick Ashton and Eslanda Goode Robeson.Independent obituary, 14 March 2005Times obituary, 15 March 2005 References *Humphrey Spender: Artist whose photographs of the working classes became regarded as an invaluable historical record, obituary in Daily Telegraph (London, England) 15 March 2005, from Humphrey Spender at Newspapers Online Gale (accessed 22 August 2007) External links *British Army Officers 1939–1945 *Humphrey Spender at friendsandrelations.com *Photographs taken by Humphrey Spender for the Mass-Observation project in Bolton Category:1910 births Category:University of Freiburg alumni Category:2005 deaths Category:People educated at Gresham's School Category:People from Kensington Category:Photographers from London Category:20th-century English painters Category:English male painters Category:21st-century English painters Category:Bisexual artists Category:History of the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton Category:Bisexual men Category:British Army personnel of World War II Category:Royal Army Service Corps officers ","title":"Humphrey Spender"},{"id":"1107978","text":"Vladimir Valentinovich Krylov () (born 26 February 1964) is a former Soviet athlete.

It mixes Afro-Cuban clave- based rhythms with jazz harmonies and techniques of improvisation. Afro-Cuban jazz emerged in the early 1940s with the Cuban musicians Mario Bauzá and Frank Grillo \\"Machito\\" in the band Machito and his Afro-Cubans in New York City. In 1947, the collaborations of bebop trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and percussionist Chano Pozo brought Afro-Cuban rhythms and instruments, such as the tumbadora and the bongo, into the East Coast jazz scene. Early combinations of jazz with Cuban music, such as \\"Manteca\\" and \\"Mangó Mangüé\\", were commonly referred to as \\"Cubop\\" for Cuban bebop. During its first decades, the Afro-Cuban jazz movement was stronger in the United States than in Cuba. Kenny Dorham, In the early 1970s, the Orquesta Cubana de Música Moderna and later Irakere brought Afro-Cuban jazz into the Cuban music scene, influencing styles such as songo. History \\"Spanish tinge\\"—the Cuban influence in early jazz Although clave-based Afro-Cuban jazz did not appear until the mid-20th century, the Cuban influence was present at the birth of jazz. African-American music began incorporating Afro-Cuban musical motifs in the 19th century when the habanera gained international popularity. The habanera was the first written music to be rhythmically based on an African motif. The habanera rhythm (also known as \\"congo\\" or \\"tango\\") can be thought of as a combination of tresillo and the backbeat. : ew Staff << \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef percussion \\\\time 2/4 \\\\repeat volta 2 { g8. g16 d'8 g, } } >> W. C. Handy aged 19, 1892 Musicians from Havana and New Orleans took the twice-daily ferry between both cities to perform, and the habanera took root. John Storm Roberts states that the musical genre habanera \\"reached the U.S. 20 years before the first rag was published\\". For more than a quarter-century in which the cakewalk, ragtime, and jazz were forming, the habanera was a consistent part of African-American popular music. Early New Orleans jazz bands had habaneras in their repertoire, and the tresillo/habanera figure was a rhythmic staple of jazz at the turn of the 20th century. Comparing the music of New Orleans with the music of Cuba, Wynton Marsalis said that the tresillo is the New Orleans clave.\\"Wynton Marsalis part 2.\\" 60 Minutes. CBS News (26 June 2011). \\"St. Louis Blues\\" (1914) by W. C. Handy has a habanera/tresillo bass line.

Tyler's \\"Maori\\": \\"I observed that there was a sudden, proud and graceful reaction to the rhythm...White dancers, as I had observed them, took the number in stride. I began to suspect that there was something Negroid in that beat.\\" After noting a similar reaction to the same rhythm in \\"La Paloma\\", Handy included this rhythm in his \\"St. Louis Blues,\\" the instrumental copy of \\"Memphis Blues,\\" the chorus of \\"Beale Street Blues,\\" and other compositions.\\" Jelly Roll Morton Jelly Roll Morton considered the tresillo/habanera (which he called the Spanish tinge) to be an essential ingredient of jazz. Morton stated, \\"Now in one of my earliest tunes, 'New Orleans Blues', you can notice the Spanish tinge. In fact, if you can't manage to put tinges of Spanish in your tunes, you will never be able to get the right seasoning, I call it, for jazz—Morton (1938: Library of Congress Recording).\\"Morton, Jelly Roll (1938: Library of Congress Recording), The Complete Recordings by Alan Lomax.

Buddy Bolden, the first known jazz musician, is credited with creating the big four, a habanera-based pattern. The big four (below) was the first syncopated bass drum pattern to deviate from the standard on-the-beat march.Marsalis, Wynton (2000: DVD n.1). Jazz. PBS.

It is not clave-based. On the other hand, jazzy renditions of Don Azpiazú's \\"The Peanut Vendor\\" (\\"El manicero\\") by Louis Armstrong (1930), Duke Ellington (1931), and Stan Kenton (1948), are all firmly in-clave since the 2-3 guajeo provides the primary counterpoint to the melody throughout the entire song. Mario Bauzá and Machito The consensus among musicians and musicologists is that the first jazz piece to be based in-clave was \\"Tanga\\" (1943) composed by Cuban-born Mario Bauza and recorded by Machito and his Afro-Cubans. \\"Tanga\\" began humbly as a spontaneous descarga (Cuban jam session) with jazz solos superimposed on top. alt= The right hand of the \\"Tanga\\" piano guajeo is in the style known as ponchando, a type of non- arpeggiated guajeo using block chords. The sequence of attack-points is emphasized, rather than a sequence of different pitches. As a form of accompaniment it can be played in a strictly repetitive fashion or as a varied motif akin to jazz comping. The following example is in the style of a 1949 recording by Machito, with René Hernández on piano. : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff << \\\\relative c' { \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 2 = 100 \\\\clef treble \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\time 4/4 4 r r r8[ ] r[ ] r4 } >> ew Staff << \\\\relative c { \\\\clef bass \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\time 4/4 \\\\bar \\".|:\\" c8 g c,4 bes'8 f bes,4 c'8 g c, bes' r[ bes] bes,4 \\\\bar \\":|.\\" } >> >> } Ten innovations by Machito's Afro-Cubans # The first band to make congas, bongo, and timbales the standard percussion in Afro-Cuban based dance music. The use of broken bell patterns by the bongocero in mambo horn sections, the increased rhythmic vocabulary of the conga drum and its function in a band setting, the increased importance of the timbales in setting up figures played by the horns and accenting them as a jazz drummer would do in a big band. e.g. \\"Nagüe,\\" also the first recorded example of all three percussion instruments playing as a section. # The first band to explore jazz arranging techniques with Afro-Cuban rhythms on a consistent basis, giving it an identifiable sound. Cuban big band arranger Chico O'Farill stated, \\"This was a new concept in interpretating Cuban music with as much (harmonic) richness as possible. You have to understand how important this was. It made every other band that came after, followers.\\"Notes from The Mambo Inn: The Story of Mario Bauzá. PBS documentary (1998). # The first band to explore modal harmony from a jazz arranging perspective through the recording of \\"Tanga\\". Of note is the 'sheet of sound' effect in the arrangement through the use of multiple layering. # The first big band to explore, from an Afro-Cuban rhythmic perspective, large-scale extended compositional works. e.g. \\"The Afro-Cuban Jazz Suite\\" by Chico O'Farill. # The first band to combine big band arranging techniques within an original composition with jazz oriented soloists using an Afro-Cuban based rhythm section, e.g. Gene Johnson - alto, Brew Moore - tenor, composition - \\"Tanga\\" (1943). # The first multi-racial band in the United States. # The first band in the United States to use the term \\"Afro-Cuban\\" in its name (Machito & The Afro-Cubans), alluding to the West African roots of their music. This was an overlooked contribution by the orchestra to the burgeoning civil rights movement which compelled the Latin and African-American communities of New York to deal with their West African musical roots. # The first Afro-Cuban dance band to explore clave conterpoint from an arranging standpoint. The ability to weave seamlessly from one side of the clave to the other without breaking its rhythmic integrity within the structure of a musical arrangement. # Music director Mario Bauzá and lead vocalist Machito promoted a standard of excellence for subsequent band leaders, such as José Curbelo, Tito Puente, Marcelino Guerra, Tito Rodriguez, and Elmo Garcia. Although it could be argued that Xavier Cugat established such a standard much earlier with his orchestra at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel (1931), the sound emulated by bandleaders in New York City was different from Cugat's. Cugat performed for the high society of New York City, not the Latino community in East Harlem (El Barrio) and the South Bronx. Cugat's music was one they may have heard on the radio, but this community had little access to it. # The Machito Afro-Cubans provided a forum for progressive musical ideas, compositions, and arrangements. They explored the fusion of Afro Cuban music with jazz arranging and jazz-oriented soloists in a multiracial framework. Bauzá developed the 3-2/2-3 clave concept and terminology. A chord progression can begin on either side of clave. When the progression begins on the three- side, the song or song section is said to be in 3-2 clave. When the chord progression begins on the two-side, it is in 2-3 clave. : ew RhythmicStaff { \\\\clef percussion \\\\time 2/2 \\\\repeat volta 2 { c4.^\\\\markup { \\"3-2 son clave\\" } c8 r4 c r c c r } } : ew RhythmicStaff { \\\\clef percussion \\\\time 2/2 \\\\repeat volta 2 { r4^\\\\markup { \\"2-3 son clave\\" } c c r c4. c8 r4 c } } In North America, salsa and Latin jazz charts commonly represent clave in two measures of cut-time (2/2); this is most likely the influence of jazz conventions. When clave is written in two measures (above), changing from one clave sequence to the other is a matter of reversing the order of the measures. Bauzá balanced Latin and jazz musicians in Machito's band to realize his vision of Afro-Cuban jazz. He mastered both types of music, but it took time for him to teach the jazz musicians in Machito's band about clave. When trumpeter Doc Cheatham joined the band, Machito fired him after two nights because he couldn't cope with clave. left Dizzy Gillespie and Chano Pozo Mario Bauzá introduced bebop innovator Dizzy Gillespie to the Cuban conga drummer, dancer, composer, and choreographer Chano Pozo. The brief collaboration of Gillespie and Pozo produced some of the most enduring Afro- Cuban jazz standards. \\"Manteca\\" (1947), co-written by Gillespie and Pozo, is the first jazz standard to be rhythmically based on clave. According to Gillespie, Pozo composed the layered, contrapuntal guajeos (Afro-Cuban ostinatos) of the A section and the introduction, while Gillespie wrote the bridge. Gillespie recounted: \\"If I'd let it go like [Chano] wanted it, it would have been strickly Afro-Cuban all the way. There wouldn't have been a bridge. I thought I was writing an eight-bar bridge, but after eight bars I hadn't resolved back to B-flat, so I had to keep going and ended up writing a sixteen-bar bridge.\\" It was the bridge that gave \\"Manteca\\" a typical jazz harmonic structure, setting the piece apart from Bauzá's modal \\"Tanga\\" of a few years earlier. Arrangements with a \\"Latin\\" A section and a swung B section, with all choruses swung during solos, became common practice with many \\"Latin tunes\\" of the jazz standard repertoire. This approach can be heard on pre-1980 recordings of \\"Manteca\\", \\"A Night in Tunisia\\", \\"Tin Tin Deo,\\" and \\"On Green Dolphin Street.\\" Gillespie's collaboration with Pozo brought African-based rhythms into bebop, a post-modernist art form. While pushing the boundaries of harmonic improvisation, cu-bop as it was called, also drew more directly from Africa, rhythmically. Early performances of \\"Manteca\\" reveal that despite their enthusiasm for collaborating, Gillespie and Pozo were not very familiar with each other's music. The members of Gillespie's band were unaccustomed to guajeos, overly swinging and accenting them in an atypical fashion. Thomas Owens observes: \\"Once the theme ends and the improvisation begins, ... Gillespie and the full band continue the bebop mood, using swing eighths in spite of Pozo's continuing even eighths, until the final A section of the theme returns. Complete assimilation of Afro-Cuban rhythms and improvisations on a harmonic ostinato was still a few years away for the beboppers in 1947.\\" On a live 1948 recording of \\"Manteca,\\" someone is heard playing the 3-2 son clave pattern on claves throughout a good portion of this 2-3 song.Dizzy Gillespie and His Big Band, featuring Chano Pozo. GNP CD 23 (1948). The rhythm of the melody of the A section is identical to a common mambo bell pattern: : { \\\\relative c' { \\\\time 2/2 \\\\key bes \\\\major \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 2 = 108 f4 aes aes8 bes r[ bes->~] bes[ aes] f[ bes] r[ aes->] r[ bes] } } 1940s –1970s In early 1947 Stan Kenton recorded \\"Machito,\\" written by his collaborator / arranger Pete Rugolo.Roberts (1999: 73). Some consider the piece to be the first Afro-Cuban jazz recording by American jazz musicians. John Storm Roberts observes that the piece \\"has no Latino instrumentalists on it, a lack of that is obvious; the crisp, fast montuno with which the piece opens is weighed down by not-so-adept drumming from Shelly Mann.\\" Later, on 6 December of the same year, Kenton recorded an arrangement of the son \\"The Peanut Vendor\\" with members of Machito's rhythm section. Kenton continued to work with Afro-Cuban rhythms and musicians for another decade; the 1956 Kenton album Cuban Fire! was written as an Afro-Cuban suite by Johnny Richards. Mongo Santamaría (1969) Cuban percussionist Mongo Santamaría first recorded his composition \\"Afro Blue\\" in 1959.\\"Afro Blue,\\" Afro Roots (Mongo Santamaria) Prestige CD 24018-2 (1959). \\"Afro Blue\\" was the first jazz standard built upon a typical African three-against-two (3:2) cross-rhythm, or hemiola. The song begins with the bass repeatedly playing 6 cross-beats per each measure of , or 6 cross-beats per 4 main beats—6:4 (two cells of 3:2). The following example shows the original ostinato \\"Afro Blue\\" bass line.

Guajeos (Afro-Cuban ostinato melodies), or guajeo fragments are commonly used motifs in Latin jazz melodies. For example, the A section of \\"Sabor\\" is a 2-3 onbeat/offbeat guajeo, minus some notes.

In the 1980s a generation of New York City musicians had come of age playing both salsa dance music and jazz. In 1967 brothers Jerry and Andy González at the ages of 15 and 13 formed a Latin jazz quintet inspired by Cal Tjader's group. with Jerry on congas and Andy on bass. During 1974–1976 they were members of one of Eddie Palmieri's experimental salsa groups. Andy González recounts, \\"We were into improvising... doing that thing Miles Davis was doing—playing themes and just improvising on the themes of songs, and we never stopped playing through the whole set.\\" While in Palmieri's band, the González brothers started showing up in the DownBeat Readers' Poll. In 1974, the González brothers and Manny Oquendo founded the salsa band Libre and experimented with jazz and Afro-Cuban rhythms. Libre recorded Charlie Parker's \\"Donna Lee\\" as a danzón, Miles Davis's \\"Tune Up\\" as a conga de comparsa, and Freddie Hubbard's \\"Little Sunflower\\" as a mambo. In the 1980s, Tito Puente began recording and performing Latin jazz. The González brothers worked with Puente as well as Dizzy Gillespie. McCoy Tyner hired the brothers when he played Afro-Cuban jazz. Other New York musicians included Bobby Sanabria, Steve Turre, Conrad Herwig, Hilton Ruiz, Chris Washburn, Ralph Irizarry, David Sánchez, and Dave Valentine. Latin jazz musicians in San Francisco included John Santos' Machete Ensemble, Rebeca Mauleón, Mark Levine, Omar Sosa, and Orestes Vilato. Jan L. Hartong's Nueva Manteca is based in The Hague, Netherlands, and Yilian Cañizares in Lausanne, Switzerland. The Cuban branch \\"Jazz bands\\" began forming in Cuba as early as the 1920s. These bands often included both Cuban popular music and popular North American jazz, and show tunes in their repertoires. Despite this musical versatility, the movement of blending Afro-Cuban rhythms with jazz was not strong in Cuba itself for decades. As Leonardo Acosta observes: \\"Afro-Cuban jazz developed simultaneously in New York and Havana, with the difference that in Cuba it was a silent and almost natural process, practically imperceptible\\".Cuba's contribution to the genre came relatively late, beginning with the band Irakere. \\"Chékere-son\\" (1976) introduced a style of \\"Cubanized\\" bebop-flavored horn lines, that departed from the more \\"angular\\" guajeo-based lines typical of Cuban popular music. The horn line style introduced in \\"Chékere-son\\" is heard today in Afro-Cuban jazz, and the contemporary popular dance genre known as timba. Another important Irakere contribution is their use of batá and other Afro-Cuban folkloric drums. \\"Bacalao con pan\\" is the first song recorded by Irakere to use batá. The tune combines the folkloric drums, jazzy dance music, and distorted electric guitar with wah-wah pedal. According to Raúl A. Fernández, the Orquesta Cubana de Música Moderna members would not have been allowed by the orquesta to record the unconventional song. The musicians travelled to Santiago to record it. \\"Somehow the tune made it from Santiago to radio stations in Havana where it became a hit; Irakere was formally organized a little bit later\\". Several of the founding members did not always appreciate Irakere's fusion of jazz and Afro-Cuban elements. They saw the Cuban folk elements as a type of nationalistic \\"fig leaf\\", cover for their true love—jazz. They were obsessed with jazz. Cuba's Ministry of Culture is said to have viewed jazz as the music of \\"imperialist America.\\" Pablo Menéndez, founder of Mezcla, recalls: \\"Irakere were jazz musicians who played stuff like 'Bacalao con pan' with a bit of a tongue in cheek attitude—'for the masses.' I remember Paquito d'Rivera thought it was pretty funny stuff (as opposed to 'serious' stuff)\\" (2011: web). In spite of the ambivalence by some members towards Irakere's Afro-Cuban folkloric/jazz fusion, their experiments changed Cuban popular music, Latin jazz, and salsa. Another important Cuban jazz musician is pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba, whose innovative jazz guajeos revolutionized Cuban-style piano in the 1980s. Like the musicians of his generation who founded the timba era, Rubalcaba is a product of the Cuban music education system. He studied both piano and drums. Rubalcaba began his classical musical training at Manuel Saumell Conservatory at age 9, where he had to choose piano; he moved up to \\"middle-school\\" at Amadeo Roldan Conservatory, and finally earned his degree in music composition from Havana's Institute of Fine Arts in 1983. By that time he was already playing in clubs and music halls in Havana. Many Cuban jazz bands, such as the saxophonist Tony Martinez's group, perform at a level few non-Cubans can match rhythmically. The clave matrix offers infinite possibilities for rhythmic textures in jazz. The Cuban-born drummer Dafnis Prieto in particular, has been a trailblazer in expanding the parameters of clave experimentation. Afro-Cuban singer Daymé Arocena has been described as a \\"cross between Celia Cruz and Aretha Franklin\\". Clave license More than a half century ago, Mario Bauzá developed arranging in-clave to an art. Another name for clave is guide- pattern, and that is how Bauzá related to it. He taught Tito Puente, and Puente's arrangers learned from him. The techniques were passed down from one generation to the next. Many educated Cuban musicians reject the idea of 3-2/2-3 clave. Dafnis Prieto and Alain Pérez reject the concept. Many younger musicians reject the concept of \\"clave rules\\". Pérez states, \\"I just don't treat the clave as a study or a profound analysis conceived around where it overlaps and where it comes in. I didn't learn it in that way\\". Bobby Sanabria laments the pervasiveness of this attitude in Cuba. \\"The lack of clave consciousness in Cuba is starting to be felt more and more where the rhythmic equilibrium established by the clave direction is being sacrificed due to lack of knowledge in how to work with it from an arranging standpoint by young arrangers especially in the timba movement\\" Perhaps Juan Formell, founder of Los Van Van, summed up this contemporary Cuban clave attitude best. \\"We Cubans like to think we have 'clave license'...and we don't feel obsessed about the clave as many others do\\".

Overview Regarding the human population, end- targets for an optimum population include ecological sustainability, economic outputOn the Concept of Optimum Population'' P. S.

Some commentators disagree with the concept of \\"optimum population\\", believing that the human population will always, in the long- term, be able to adapt to the requirements of a larger population. Any conception of an optimum population level must lie between a minimum viable population of the human species and the maximum level of population that can be sustained by the carrying capacity of the planet Earth. Estimations Various end-targets are often balanced together in estimating the optimum human population, and different emphasis on different end-targets cause variability among estimates. The optimal world population has been estimated by a team co-authored by Paul R. Ehrlich.Gretchen C. Daily, Anne H. Ehrlich, and Paul R. Ehrlich. Optimum Human Population Size . Population and Environment: A Journal of Interdisciplinary Studies Volume 15, Number 6, July 1994 01994 Human Sciences Press, Inc. End-targets in this estimation included: *Decent wealth and resources to everyone *Basic human rights to everyone *Preservation of cultural diversity *Allowance of intellectual, artistic, and technological creativity *Preservation of biodiversity Based on this, the estimation of optimum population was to be roughly around 1.5 billion to 2 billion people.

It is considered a pioneering example of photojournalism and was an immediate success, selling 1,700,000 copies a week after only two months. It has been called the UK's equivalent of Life magazine. The magazine’s editorial stance was liberal, anti-Fascist and populistHulton|Archive – History in Pictures History of Picture Post by the Archive Curator Sarah McDonald, 15/10/04. Accessed March 2008 and from its inception, Picture Post campaigned against the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany. In the 26 November 1938 issue, a picture story was run entitled \\"Back to the Middle Ages\\": photographs of Adolf Hitler, Joseph Goebbels and Hermann Göring were contrasted with the faces of those scientists, writers and actors they were persecuting. History In January 1941 Picture Post published their \\"Plan for Britain\\". This included minimum wages throughout industry, full employment, child allowances, a national health service, the planned use of land and a complete overhaul of education. This document led to discussions about post-war Britain and was a populist forerunner of William Beveridge's November 1942 Report. Sales of Picture Post increased further during World War II and by December 1943 the magazine was selling 1,950,000 copies a week. By the end of 1949 circulation had declined to 1,422,000. Founding editor Stefan Lorant (who had also founded Lilliput and had even earlier pioneered the picture-story in Germany in the 1920s) had been succeeded by (Sir) Tom Hopkinson in 1940. Lorant, who had some Jewish ancestry, had been imprisoned by Hitler in the early 1930s, and wrote a best-selling book thereafter, I Was Hitler's Prisoner. By 1940, he feared he would be captured in a Nazi invasion of Britain, and fled to Massachusetts, USA, where he wrote important illustrated U. S. histories and biographies. During World War Two, the art editor of the magazine, Edgar Ainsworth, served as a war correspondent and accompanied the American 7th Army on their advance across Europe in 1945. He visited the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp three times after the British army liberated the complex in April 1945. Several of his sketches and drawings from the camp were published in a September 1945 article, Victim and Prisoner. Ainsworth also commissioned the artist Mervyn Peake to visit France and Germany at the end of the war, and he too reported from Bergen-Belsen. Hopkinson said his photographers were thoroughbreds, and whereas text could always be written after the event, if his photographers did not come back with good pictures, he had nothing to work with. Years later Hopkinson said the greatest photos he ever received to lay out were Bert Hardy's images from the Korean War Battle of Incheon, which James Cameron wrote the article for. The magazine's greatest photographers included Hardy, Kurt Hutton, Felix H. Man (aka Hans Baumann), Francis Reiss, Thurston Hopkins, John Chillingworth, Grace Robertson, and Leonard McCombe, who eventually joined Life Magazine's staff. Staff writers included MacDonald Hastings, Lorna Hay, Sydney Jacobson, J. B. Priestley, Lionel Birch, James Cameron, Fyfe Robertson, Anne Scott-James, Robert Kee and Bert Lloyd; many freelancer writers contributed, as well, including George Bernard Shaw, Dorothy Parker, and William Saroyan. On 17 June 1950 Leader magazine was incorporated in Picture Post. Editor Tom Hopkinson was often in conflict with (Sir) Edward G. Hulton, the owner of Picture Post. Hulton mainly supported the Conservative Party and objected to Hopkinson's socialist views. This conflict led to Hopkinson's dismissal in 1950 following the publication of Cameron's article, with pictures by Hardy, about South Korea's treatment of political prisoners in the Korean War. By June 1952, circulation had fallen to 935,000. Sales continued to decline in the face of competition from television and a revolving door of new editors. By the time the magazine closed in July 1957, circulation was less than 600,000 copies a week. Picture Post was digitised as The Picture Post Historical Archive, 1938-1957 and consists of the complete, fully searchable facsimile archive of the Picture Post. It was made available in 2011 to libraries and institutions. Hulton Press Library As the photographic archive of Picture Post expanded through the Second World War, it became clear that its vast collection of photographs and negatives, both published and unpublished, were becoming an important historical documentary resource. In 1945, Sir Edward Hulton set up the Hulton Press Library as a semi-independent operation. He commissioned Charles Gibbs-Smith of the Victoria and Albert Museum to catalogue the entire archive using a system of keywords and classifications. The Gibbs-Smith system was the world’s first indexing system for pictures, and it was eventually adopted by the Victoria and Albert and parts of the British Museum collections. When Picture Post folded, Sir Edward Hulton sold the archive collection to the BBC in 1957. It was incorporated into the Radio Times photo archive, and the BBC expanded the collection further with the purchase of the photo archives of the Daily Express and Evening Standard newspapers. Eventually, the BBC disposed of its photo archive and the BBC Hulton Picture Library was sold on once more, this time to Brian Deutsch, in 1988. In 1996, the Hulton Picture Collection was bought by Getty Investments for £8.6 million. Getty Images now owns the rights to some 15 million photographs from the British press archives dating back to the 19th century. In 2000, Getty embarked on a large project to digitise the photo archive, and launched a dedicated website in 2001.A data migration programme began in 2003 and the Hulton Archive was transferred to the main Getty Images website; the Hulton Archive is still available today as a featured resource within the vast Getty holdings.

The official name in English was changed from Orleans to Orléans by the Ontario Geographic Names Board in 1994, but the unaccented form remains common usage.) is a suburb of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It is located in the east end of the city along the Ottawa River, about from Downtown Ottawa. The Canada 2016 Census determined that Orléans' population was 116,688. Prior to being amalgamated into Ottawa in 2001, the community of Orléans was spread over two municipal jurisdictions, the eastern portion being in the pre-amalgamation City of Cumberland, the western portion in the City of Gloucester. According to the 2016 census, 69,178 people lived in the Cumberland portion of Orleans, while 47,510 people lived in the Gloucester portion. Today, Orléans spans the municipal wards of Orléans, Innes, and Cumberland. Orléans contains a significant francophone population.  History  St-Joseph Blvd. circa 1971. The Duford Hill to Queenswood Heights is in the background (behind the Coca- Cola sign). Today, Place d'Orléans would be on the left and the Dental Docs Office to the right. It was in the 1830s that the earliest pioneers arrived in the Orléans area. Amongst the first Francophones were the Dupuis, Besserer, Major, Duford and Vézina families. A few English-speaking families also made Orléans their home from the very beginning, such as the Kennys and the McNeelys. In 1880, the parish was made up of 43 Anglophone families and 131 Francophone families. In 1858, the first subdivision plans (Lots 1 and 2) were registered in the County of Carleton, for Gloucester Township, thereby creating the Village of Saint-Joseph d'Orléans. In 1859, François Dupuis also registered his plan (Lot 3) including St. John (St-Jean), Dupuis (Dessere), and Scott Streets (St-Charles). Orleans was named by Msgr. Ebrard in the late 1850s for the city of the same name in France. According to the Canadian Permanent Committee on Geographical Names files he applied for establishment of a post office \\"plus tard en 1859\\". It was granted in 1860. In 1860, Father Alphonse-Marius Chaîne was appointed resident priest of the new Saint-Joseph d’Orléans parish, founded in October of the same year. In 1885, the first church opened its doors. In 1922, a second church - the current one - replaced the first which had been destroyed by fire. The parish priest was Mgr. Hilaire Chartrand. In the same year (1922) Orléans became a semi-autonomous municipality, known as a police village, and more decisions were made locally. The police village was governed by a council consisting of three volunteers elected to preserve peace, health, and public safety. At the time, the village was part of Gloucester Township, which in turn, was part of Carleton County. However, some parishioners lived in Cumberland Township, east of Champlain Street, the dividing line between the townships. By the 1950s, St-Joseph Boulevard became a major artery, with storefronts multiplying everywhere and new restaurants opening up the length of the through fare. Social life took on a decidedly community flavour, with clubs and community associations being formed. Commercial life improved considerably in Orléans in 1955 with the establishment of the first Chamber of Commerce in Orléans, which campaigned on behalf of various causes, such as pressing for a decent water and sewer system in the 1960s. The quiet, rural community that was once Orléans lived its last moments in 1958, when developers hit the town, and from then on, things would never be the same. Orléans has known dramatic residential growth since then, which has led to profound social and linguistic changes in the make-up of the population. The first major real estate development was Queenswood Heights with construction beginning in 1958. In 1970, the Grey Nuns of Charity Congregation sold 500 acres of land to the Costain and Minto real estate companies, which launched major developments in the Convent Glen, Orléans Wood, Chatelaine Village areas, etc. On Jan. 1 1974, the village of Saint- Joseph d’Orléans was incorporated into the Regional Municipality of Ottawa- Carleton. It was in the 1970s that the first high schools opened their doors, and after-class hours had Orléans youth start setting up their own clubs. Map of Orléans, Ontario, with main road arteries shown. The housing and population boom years for Orléans came in the decade from 1981 to 1991. The population of Orléans tripled and grew from 24,000 to 70,000 people. Orléans recorded the second-highest population growth rate in the entire country in the late 1980s. In 1989, Orléans became a municipality, Cumberland Township moved its city hall from Leonard, Ont. to Orléans. Orleans continued its residential developments through the 1990s. In addition to the residential developments, the 1990s in Orleans saw the final expansion of the Place d'Orléans shopping centre, a movie theatre, several new restaurants, new businesses, four new high schools, etc. In 2001, Orléans was amalgamated into the City of Ottawa, becoming Urban sub-area No. 16 (now No. 15). The country-wide housing boom starting from 2000 has also seen an extremely large amount of housing and residential areas being developed in the eastern Orléans area west of Trim Road and south of Innes Road, such as the new communities Avalon, Notting Gate (including Notting Hill). The population and business growth in the area prompted the re-development of Innes Road from a two-lane to a four-lane road in 2005. With the Innes Road expansion, newer business areas along Innes Road between Trim and Pagé Roads, consist of many large retail outlets, restaurants, gyms, a movie theatre, etc.  Timeline  * 1833 – François Dupuis, founder of Orléans, is listed on St. Joseph assessment rolls. * 1834 – First Anglo settlers arrive in Blackburn Hamlet. * 1836 – Cummings Bridge links Montreal Road to Bytown. * 1846 – François Dupuis arrives with wife Mary Scott in what will be Orléans * 1849 – First Catholic Chapel Saint-François- Xavier, opens on land donated by François Dupuis. * 1850 – Post Office opens in Notre-Dame-de-Lourdes. * 1850 – Road opened between Cumberland and Gloucester and Bytown. * 1850 – Toll gate opens at Green’s Creek. * 1850 – Besserer family begins operating summer resort at Besserer’s Grove with quay at Besserer’s Landing – closed in 1885. * 1855 – Father François-Joseph Michel opens Catholic mission in Cumberland, previously known as Foubertville. * 1856 – Luc Major arrives in Orléans and opens tavern. * 1858 – Luc Major draws up first plan of Orléans * 1860 – Postmaster Jean Théodore Besserer gives St- Joseph-d’Orléans its name after his place of birth. * 1860 – Private French school opens in Orléans. * 1868 – McArthur Road opens as short-cut to Cyrville through McArthur Farm to avoid costly Montreal Road tolls. * 1871 – Start of construction on St-Joseph-d’ Orléans Church – completed in 1885. * 1882 – Canada Atlantic Railway opens from Ottawa to Carlsbad Springs and Maritimes.

Millennium Sports Park is a 34 hectare sports and recreational complex, consisting of 15 Soccer and Football fields located at 100 Millennium Blvd in Orleans. The closest major intersection to the Sports Park is Innes Road @ Trim Road. The site is currently home to a number of youth sporting clubs in the Eastern half of the Greater Ottawa Area. Currently, the largest tenants at the facility are Ottawa TFC soccer club (formerly known as the Cumberland United Soccer Club) and the Cumberland Panthers football club. Petrie Island is situated along the Ottawa River in the north-east of Orléans. The Petrie Islands were formed by sand deposited at the close of the last ice age, about 12,000 years ago. The 2 km by 500 m area, from the foot of Champlain St. to Trim Rd in Orleans, has a total shoreline length, including all channels and bays, of about 12 km. Much of the area has been publicly owned since 1983, purchased to preserve the natural habitat of the western portion of the islands. Sand dredging at the eastern end was phased out in 2003, and the ten- hectare sand fill and natural beach is now in use for public recreation. Petrie Island is home to turtles in some of its sheltered lagoons and has a nature centre for learning more about the local environment. There is a marina with canoe and kayak rentals. Petrie Island is host to annual Canada Day celebrations for the Orléans community. There are also several nature trails and paths throughout the area including the Bilberry Creek Trail and the Princess Louise Trail (incl. a waterfall) through which Taylor Creek runs. In 1984 the Township formed a committee to develop a policy for uses of Conservation lands and approved the policy in March 1985. In 1988 a Township wide Nature trails sub-committee was formed under the Cumberland Township Recreation committee. This Committee, composed of volunteer Township residents advises and assists the Township in the development, maintenance and protection of the natural areas within Cumberland. At present there are: * 2.7 km of trails in Chatelaine Village * 5.5 km of trails in Queenswood/Fallingbrook Escarpment * 9 km of trails in Ravine – Township Western boundary (Q.H.) * 2 km of trails in Cumberland Village In 2009, the Shenkman Arts Centre opened just east of Place d'Orléans. It is a multidisciplinary arts centre that houses two theatres, seven galleries and 17 studios. The Centre houses activities within specialized spaces for hands-on instruction, creation and presentation of the visual, performing, literary and media arts and unique spaces for receptions and special events. Operated by the City of Ottawa, this diversity of programs and activities is attributed to a unique collaboration with the Centre’s Resident Arts Partners: AOE Arts Council, Gloucester Pottery School, MIFO (Mouvement d’implication francophone d’Orléans), Ottawa School of Art–Orléans Campus, and OYP Theatre School. The Centre is also home to Resident Company Tara Luz Danse and ARTicipate, a one- of-a-kind endowment fund that supports innovative programming at the Centre. A memorial diorama by Bruce Garner was erected August 13, 2000 in the Memorial Park near Royal Canadian Legion, Branch 632 to remember those who have served Canada in wars and as peace keepers.

It has a population of 4,133,Census 2001 increasing to 4,230 at the 2011 Census. History of the parish In former times, when Kent was administered through areas known as lathes, Sutton-at-Hone was a half-lathe. It covered an area well in excess of Dartford Borough as it is today. The half-lathe embraced a number of towns and villages including Dartford (Darentford) and Hawley. 1894 saw the formation of the Parish Council of Sutton-at-Hone under the Local Government Act of that year. At that time the Council's area included Sutton-at-Hone, Hawley, Swanley Junction, Swanley Village, Hextable and Crockenhill. In 1955 many parish boundaries were changed dramatically and the Parish was reduced to just Sutton-at-Hone and Hawley. In the late 1970s the parish was renamed Sutton-at- Hone and Hawley Parish Council to reflect its specific administration area see St John's Jerusalem Within the parish is the one-time Commandery of the Knights Hospitallers of the Order of St John of Jerusalem.

Alongside Jane Slaughter, Woodyatt is the programme's longest-serving cast member, having played the role since 1985. Early life and education Woodyatt was born on 28 June 1968 in Walthamstow, and grew up in East London. He was educated at two independent schools: at Forest School, on the edge of Epping Forest, in Walthamstow in north east London, where he shared classes with comedy writer Sharat Sardana and cricket captain Nasser Hussain. He then attended the Sylvia Young Theatre School. He also attended Llanidloes High School, Llanidloes in Wales. Career Following the completion of his studies at the Sylvia Young Theatre School, Woodyatt appeared in children's drama The Baker Street Boys. He then put his acting career on hiatus and worked as a butcher in Wales for a brief period, before joining the cast of BBC soap opera EastEnders. Not expecting to stay much beyond the first year, Woodyatt has become the longest serving male cast member in EastEnders; apart from Jane Slaughter, he is the only character from the first episode to appear in the soap without officially leaving. Alongside Letitia Dean, Gillian Taylforth and Jane Slaughter, who play Sharon Watts, Kathy Beale and Tracey, Woodyatt is one of only four members of the original cast currently in EastEnders, but is the only one except Slaughter to have appeared continuously throughout the show's run. In 2013, his longevity was honoured at the British Soap Awards, where he received a Lifetime Achievement Award for his portrayal of Ian Beale. Woodyatt has also appeared as a guest personality on several BBC game shows and charity fundraisers, including A Question of Sport, Robot Wars (winning the show's Celebrity Special with the robot Pussycat) and Children in Need. In 2015, Woodyatt played the henchman of the Wicked Queen in a pantomime production of Snow White at Swindon’s Wyvern Theatre. Speaking about joining the production, Woodyatt commented: \\"I absolutely love performing in front of an audience as it’s so different to camera – I love the reaction of the audience. I am very much looking forward to spending the Christmas season at the Wyvern Theatre, which I know has a reputation for staging outstanding pantomimes.\\" On the 24th of April 2015 the comedy singer Gavin Osborn released a song titled \\"Adam Woodyatt\\" posing the question; \\"Imagine how it feels, being Ian Beale?\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZARkg3MUgS0 In 2019, he appeared on Celebrity Masterchef. In August 2020, it was announced that Woodyatt would be taking an \\"extended break\\" from appearing in EastEnders. Photography Woodyatt is also a photographer, a hobby he took up while performing On The Razzle at the National Theatre when he was 13 years old. In 2008, he won the Architectural Photographer of the Year Award of the Society of Wedding and Portrait Photographers with a picture he took at St Pancras, where he was filming EastEnders. Personal life On 8 April 1998, Woodyatt married dancer Beverley Sharp in a private ceremony at Disney World, Florida. The couple have two children, and for many years lived in Southam, Warwickshire, 72 miles northwest of the BBC Elstree Studios in south Hertfordshire, where EastEnders is recorded. On 21 August 2020, it was revealed that Woodyatt had decided to separate from Sharp the previous year, after more than twenty years of marriage. Woodyatt is a supporter of Liverpool F.C. Charity Inspired by his father's death from cancer aged 58, Woodyatt has helped raise money for various cancer research initiatives, and broke his collarbone in June 2003 whilst training for a charity bicycle ride. Woodyatt was also involved in launching an Aid for Haiti event at Coventry's Ricoh Arena in February 2010, with many of his actor colleagues posing for photographs, signing autographs, and providing items for an auction, which raised £30,000. Woodyatt is also a supporter of Warwickshire & Northamptonshire Air Ambulance and an Ambassador for the Children's Air Ambulance. In January 2019, it was announced that he would be running the London Marathon with some of his EastEnders co-stars for a Dementia campaign in honour of former Eastenders actress Barbara Windsor.

It was used as an administrative center for the province. Due generally to river floods, the fort was rebuilt twice, the last time in limestone in the 1750s in the era of French colonial control over Louisiana and the Illinois Country. A partial reconstruction exists of this third and last fort. The site is now preserved as an Illinois state park and is four miles (6 km) west of Prairie du Rocher in Randolph County, Illinois. It is south of St. Louis, Missouri in the floodplain area that became known as the American Bottom. The site and its associated buildings were placed on the National Register of Historic Places and recognized as a National Historic Landmark on October 15, 1966, and it was named one of the contributing properties to the new French Colonial Historic District in 1974, along with other area French-influenced sites such as the Creole House, the Pierre Menard House, the Kolmer Site (a former Indian village), and the site of Fort Kaskaskia.Brown, Margaret K. National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: French Colonial Historic District. National Park Service, n.d., 6. The name of the fort honored Louis, duc de Chartres, son of the Regent of France. The fort's stone magazine, which survived the gradual ruin that overtook the rest of the site, is considered the oldest building in the state of Illinois. The state historic site today hosts several large re-enactments at the fort of colonial-era civil and military life each summer. History A bartizan at the corner of one of the reconstructed bastions French rule On January 1, 1718, the French government granted a trade monopoly to John Law and his Company of the West. Hoping to make a fortune mining precious metals, the company built a fort to protect its interests. The original wooden fort was built in 1718–1720 by a French contingent from New Orleans, led by Pierre Dugué de Boisbriant. When administration of the Illinois Country was moved from Canada to New Orleans, governance was transferred to the Company of the Indies. The fort was built to be the seat of government and to control the Indians of the region, particularly the Fox. The original fort was a palisade of logs with two bastions at opposite corners. Within five years, flooding from the Mississippi had left the original fort in bad condition. Construction of a second fort further from the river, but still on the flood plain, began in 1725. This fort was also made of logs and had a bastion at each of the four corners. The second wooden fort deteriorated somewhat less rapidly but by 1742 was in bad repair. In 1747 the French garrison moved to the region's primary settlement to the south at Kaskaskia. The French debated where to rebuild the fort. When rule of the area reverted to the French crown in the 1730s, officials began to discuss construction of a stone fortress. The government in New Orleans wanted to move the garrison permanently to Kaskaskia, but the local commandant argued for a location near the original site. 1778 map of the settlements near the fort in the Illinois County The government decided to rebuild a fort in stone near the first forts rather than at Kaskaskia. Construction began in 1753 and was mostly completed in 1754. The limestone fort had walls 15-ft (3 m)-high and 3-ft (1 m)-thick, enclosing an area of 4 acres (16,000 m²). The stone for construction was quarried in bluffs about two or three miles (4 km) distant and had to be ferried across a small lake. British rule In 1763 the Treaty of Paris was signed following the Seven Years' War (French and Indian War) and the French transferred control of the Illinois Country east of the Mississippi to Great Britain. (Spain had been granted the western part of the Illinois Country—also known as Upper Louisiana—in the 1762 Treaty of Fontainebleau.) The stone fort had served as center of French administration of the region for only twenty years. The British had difficulty getting a regiment to their newly acquired fort, but on October 10, 1765, a small detachment of the 42nd Royal Highland Regiment commanded by Captain Thomas Stirling took control of the fort and surrounding area. The 42nd was shortly replaced by the 34th Regiment. French Canadian settlers were ordered to leave or get a special license to remain. Many Canadien settlers moved to the more congenial culture of St. Louis.\\"At Home on the French Frontier\\", Illinois State Museum Website, Retrieved October 27, 2004.\\"The Expedition to Fort Chartres\\", 42nd Royal Highlanders, Inc., of Lafayette, IN website, Retrieved October 27, 2004. The 34th Regiment of Foot renamed the installation Fort Cavendish, after its colonel. However, the post was known as Ft. Chartres from 1768 on, after the 34th were replaced by the 18th (Royal Irish) Regiment under the command of Lt. Col. Wilkins. The British abandoned the post in May 1772 when the majority of the 18th (Royal Irish) Regiment was ordered back to Philadelphia. A small party under Capt Hugh Lord remained at Kaskaskia until May 1776.\\"Fort de Chartres State Historic Site\\", Official website, Retrieved on January 24, 2008 Ruin The Mississippi continued to take its toll after the fort was abandoned. In 1772 the south wall and bastion fell into the river. The remaining walls deteriorated, and visitors noted trees growing in them by the 1820s. Locals carted away stones for construction over the years. By 1900 the walls were gone. The only part of the original fort that remained was the stone masonry powder magazine. Reconstruction The fort's powder magazine prior to restoration, from photograph in 1906. The fort's powder magazine, here restored, is thought to be the oldest standing building in Illinois. The State of Illinois acquired the ruins in 1913 as a historic site and restored the powder magazine in 1917. The powder magazine is thought to be the oldest existing building in the state of Illinois. In the 1920s the foundations of the fort's buildings and walls were exposed. In the late 1920s and through the 1930s, the US WPA rebuilt the gateway and two stone buildings. A combination museum and office building, constructed in 1928 on the foundation of an original fort building, houses exhibits depicting French life at Fort de Chartres. The large stone \\"Guards House,\\" reconstructed in 1936, contains a Catholic chapel furnished in the style of the 1750s, along with a priest's room, a gunner's room, an officer-of-the-day room, and a guard's room. Also on the grounds are an operating bake oven, a garden shed built of upright logs in French Colonial poteaux-sur-sol (French: \\"post on sill\\") construction, and a kitchen garden with raised beds of produce typical of French 18th-century Illinois. Partial reconstruction of the fort's walls on the original foundations followed in 1989.\\"Fort de Chartres\\", Illinois Historic Preservation Agency site, Retrieved on January 24, 2008 The frames of some additional buildings were erected as a display of the post-and-beam construction techniques used for the originals. Other buildings' foundations and cellars were exposed for educational display as well. Today the site has a museum and small gift shop. It plays host each June to a Rendezvous that is said to be one of the largest and oldest in the country, celebrating frontier French and Indian culture. The site is protected by modern levees, but the Mississippi River is still an occasional menace. The flood of 1993 breached the levee and sent waters fifteen feet deep to lap at the top of the walls.

He is best known for noting the role of the hippocampus in memory, his study of reflexes, and Bekhterev’s disease. Moreover, he is known for his competition with Ivan Pavlov regarding the study of conditioned reflexes. Early life Vladimir Bekhterev was born in Sorali, a village in the Vyatka Governorate of the Russian Empire between the Volga River and the Ural Mountains.PsychiatryOnline American Journal of Psychiatry Vladimir Bekhterev, 1857–1927 V. M. Bekhterev's father – Mikhail Pavlovich – was a district police officer; his mother, Maria Mikhailovna – was a daughter of a titular councilor, was educated at a boarding school which also provided lessons of music and the French language. Beside Vladimir they had two more sons in the family: Nikolai and Aleksandr, older than he by 6 and 3 years respectively. In 1864 the family moved to Vyatka, and within a year the head of the family died of tuberculosis when Bekhterev was still very young. While his childhood was not simple, Bekhterev did have the opportunity to attend Vyatka gymnasium in 1867, one of the oldest schools in Russia, as well as the Military Medical Academy in St. Petersburg in 1873.Russia-InfoCentre :: Vladimir Bekhterev world-famous Russian neurologist :: people Then he studied in St. Petersburg Medicosurgical Academy where he worked under professor Jan Lucjan Mierzejewski (pl).Whonamedit – Vladimir Mikhailovich Bekhterev It was here where Bekhterev's interest in the disciplines of neuropathology and psychiatry were first sparked. Bekhterev in 1873, aged 16 Russia went to war with the Ottoman Empire in 1877. Bekhterev took time off from his studies in order to help the war effort by volunteering with an ambulance detachment. After the war, he returned to school. While attending school, Bekhterev worked as a junior doctor in the clinic of mental and nervous diseases at the Institutes of Medic’s Improvement. Here he began performing his experimental work. In 1878, Bekhterev graduated from the Medical and Surgery Academy of St. Petersburg with a degree similar to a Bachelor of Medicine. After graduating, Bekhterev worked at the Psychiatric Clinic in St. Petersburg. where he was inspired to begin studying the anatomy and physiology of the brain, the area in which he would later make some of his most notable contributions. It was also during this time that Bekhterev married Natalya Bazilevskaya. In 1880, Bekhterev began publishing his research. One of his earlier works described Russian social issues. In this paper, he wrote essays describing the individual characteristics of the Votyaks (Udmurts), a Finno-Ugric people under Russian rule who live in the Udmurt Republic between the rivers Vyatka and Kama. Then on April 4, 1881, Bekhterev successfully defended his doctoral thesis, \\"Clinical studies of temperature in some forms of mental disorders,\\" and received his doctorate from the Medicosurgical Academy of St. Petersburg. This doctorate allowed Bekhterev to become a \\"private-docent\\" or associate professor, where he lectured on the diagnostics of nervous diseases. Contribution to neurology Portrait of Bekhterev by Ilya Repin Throughout his career, Bekhterev conducted a large amount of research which greatly contributed to the current understanding of the brain. This research was described in works such as The Conduction Paths in the Brain and Spinal Cord, written in 1882, followed by a second edition written in 1896. In 1884 he published 58 scientific works about the functions of the brain. His extensive research led to an 18-month travel scholarship awarded to study and conduct research in both Germany and Paris. On this trip he worked with and learned from a variety of notable contributors the field of science such as Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920), Paul Emil Flechsig (1847–1929), Theodor Meynert (1833–1892), Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal (1833–1890), Emil du Bois-Reymond (1818–1896), and Jean Martin Charcot (1825–1893). Bekhterev's scholarship lasted until September 1885, after which, he returned to Russia and worked as the head of the Psychiatry Department at the University of Kazan until 1893.Vladimir Bekhterev (Russian psychiatrist) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia During his time at the University of Kazan, Bekhterev made some of his greatest contributions to neurological science. He established the first laboratory of experimental psychology in Russia in 1886 to study the nervous system and the structures of the brain. As a result of his research, Bekhterev believed that there were zones within the brain and each of these zones had a specific function. Moreover, because nervous disorders and mental disorders usually occur in conjunction with each other, he believed that there was no definite distinction between these disorders. When conducting research at the University of Kazan, Bekhterev also identified Ankylosing Spondylitis or Bekhterev’s disease (more frequently spelled in English as Bechterew’s disease, following the German transliteration system for Russian names), a degenerative arthritis of the spine. As a result of his groundbreaking research, in 1891, Bekhterev was granted permission by the Kazan government to open and become the chairman of the Neurology Science Society. In 1893, Bekhterev left the University of Kazan to return to St. Petersburg Military Medical Academy to become the head to the Department of Nervous and Mental Diseases where he worked with Alexandre Dogiel. Here he continued his contribution to neurological research by organizing the first Russian neurosurgical operating room to specialize in neurosurgery. While Bekhterev never performed any surgeries himself, he was highly involved in the diagnostics of neurological diseases, eventually earning him the Full State Chancellor Title in 1894. Between 1894 and 1905 Bekhterev was very busy with his research. He completed between 14 and 24 scientific works per year and founded Nevrologicheski Vestnik (Neurology Bulletin) in 1893,Nevrologicheski Vestnik: The History of the Journal the first Russian journal on nervous disease. Eventually, his work earned him the Baire’s Prize, awarded in December 1900, for the two volumes of his writing “Pathways of brain and bone marrow” in which he noted the role that the hippocampus plays in memory. Bekhterev's other writings include “Mind and Life,” a book written in 1902, which contained multiple volumes including “Foundations for Brain Functions Theory” written in 1903. “Foundations for Brain Functions Theory” described Bekhterev's views on the functions of the parts of the brain and the nervous system. It also suggested the Energetic Inhibition Theory which describes automatic responses (reflexes). This theory claims that there is an active energy in the brain which moves towards a center, and when this happens, the other parts of the brain are left in an inhibited state. He published around 600 scientific papers. The most important works are \\"Suggestion and its Role in Social Life\\" (1899), \\"Consciousness and its Borders\\" (1888), \\"Psyche and Life\\" (1902),\\"Objective Psychology\\" (1907), \\"Subject Matter and Tasks of Social Psychology as an Objective Science\\" (1911), \\"Collective Reflexology\\" (1921) and \\"General Principles of Human Reflexology\\" (1926). An Autobiography was published at 1928, after his death. He founded other scientific journals: the “Archives of psychiatry, neurology and experimental psychology” (1896) and the “Bulletin of psychology, criminal anthropology and hypnotism” (1904).Preface by José Manuel Jara of :V. M. Bekhterev \\"Suggestion and its Role in Social Life\\" Italian edition Psichiatria e Territorio, 2013 “Suggestion and its role in social life” is a book of its time, the turning of the nineteenth to the twentieth century. On the question of the so-called psychic epidemic (folie à deux, folie à millions…), the author refers Calmeil, Landel, Laségue, Falret, Legrand de Saule, Regnard, Baillarger, Moreau de Tours and Morel. Gustave Le Bon and Gabriel Tarde are also mentioned on the psychology of the crowds.. He stresses the difference between suggestion and hypnosis Bekhterev was interested in phenomena of direct mental suggestion and made experiments to influence behavior of dogs at distance (José Manuel Jara, 2013). Bekhterev's research on associated responses would become highly connected with the important area of psychology called Behaviorism. It also led to a long-standing rivalry with Ivan Pavlov, described in further detail below. Objective psychology Objective psychology is based on the principle that all behavior can be explained by objectively studying reflexes. Therefore, behavior is studied through observable traits. This idea contrasted the more subjective views of psychology such as structuralism, which allowed for the use of tools such as introspection to study inner thoughts about personal experiences. Objective Psychology would later become the basis of Reflexology, Gestalt Psychology, and especially behaviorism, an area which would later revolutionize the field of psychology and the manner in which the science of psychology is conducted. Bekhterev’s beliefs about how to best conduct research contributed to the rise of Soviet sociolinguistics from the ashes of völkerpsychologie and the Journal of the History of the behavioral Sciences. Other contributions Bekhterev founded the Psychoneurological Institute at the St. Petersburg State Medical Academy; however, he was forced to resign in 1913 as a professor at the Military Medical Academy in St. Petersburg. He was reinstated in 1918 following the Russian Revolution of 1917 and became the chairperson for the Department of Psychology and Reflexology at the University of Petrograd in St. Petersburg as well as established the Institute of Studying Brain Mental Activities. In 1921 he was involved in organising the First Conference on Scientific Organization of Labour. He was critical of Taylorism arguing that \\"The ultimate ideal of the labour problem is not in it, but is in such organisation of the labour process that would yield a maximum of efficiency coupled with a minimum of health hazards, absence of fatigue and a guarantee of the sound health and all round personal development of the working people.\\" During his time away from teaching, Bekhterev worked to open an orphanage, complete with both a kindergarten and school, for refugee children from the western regions of Russia. He also participated in creating health services in the \\"young country\\" of Russia. Rivalry with Ivan Pavlov Both Ivan Pavlov and Bekhterev independently developed a theory of conditioned reflexes which describe automatic responses to the environment. What was called association reflex by Bekhterev is called the conditioned reflex by Pavlov, although the two theories are essentially the same. Because John Watson discovered the salivation research completed by Pavlov, this research was incorporated into Watson’s famous theory of Behaviorism, making Pavlov a household name. While Watson used Pavlov’s research to support his Behaviorist claims, closer inspection shows that in fact, Watson’s teachings are better supported by Bekhterev’s research.Hergenhahn, B.R. (2009). An Introduction to the History of Psychology, Sixth Edition. Behaviorism (pp. 394–397). Wadsworth Cengage Learning. Bekhterev was familiar with Pavlov’s work and had multiple criticisms. According to Bekhterev, one of Pavlov’s major research flaws included using a saliva method. He found fault with this method because it could not be easily used on humans. In contrast, Bekhterev's method of studying this association (conditioned) reflex using mild electrical stimulation to examine motor reflexes was able to demonstrate the existence of this reflex in humans. Bekhterev also questioned using acid to encourage saliva from the animals. He felt that this practice may contaminate the results of the experiment. Finally, Bekhterev criticized Pavlov’s method by stating that the secretory reflex is unimportant and unreliable. If the animal is not hungry then food may not elicit the desired response, acting as evidence of the method’s unreliability.Hergenhahn, B.R. (2009). An Introduction to the History of Psychology, Sixth Edition. Behaviorism (pp. 394–397). Wadsworth Cengage Learning. Pavlov however was not without his own criticisms of Bekhterev, stating that Bekhterev’s laboratory was poorly controlled. Death There is a lot of mystery surrounding the death of Bekhterev. It is known for certain that Bekhterev died in 1927, but controversy exists surrounding his death. Bekhterev was a co-founder of the First All-Russian Congress of Neurologists and Psychiatry, held in December 1927 in Moscow, and was appointed as an Honorary President of the Congress. On December 23, 1927, after having lectured on child neurology at the Congress, Bekhterev went to the Kremlin to examine Joseph Stalin. About 3 hours later he came back to the Congress for a meeting and said to some colleagues there: \\"I have just examined a paranoiac with a short, dry hand.\\" The day after, Bekhterev suddenly died, causing speculation that he was poisoned by Stalin as revenge for the diagnosis. Moreover, after Bekhterev's death, Stalin had Bekhterev's name and all of his works removed from Soviet textbooks. Legacy Russian stamp honoring Bekhterev issued in 2007 Vladimir Bekhterev's contributions to science and specifically psychology were impressive. Bekhterev was a force in the science of neurology; greatly expanding knowledge on how the brain works as well as the parts of the brain. For instance, his research on the hippocampus allowed for the understanding of one of the most central portions of the brain vital to the function of memory. Moreover, his influence to psychology was immeasurable. Bekhterev’s works laid the groundwork for the future of psychology. His ideas regarding Objective psychology as well as his views on reflexes were a cornerstone of behaviorism.

A number of NOP-related incidents received some media coverage in Poland and abroad. According to the European Roma Rights Centre, on July 3, 1998, NOP supporters vandalised the Roma community centre in Łódź. Along with racist graffiti, swastikas were sprayed onto the office walls. The perpetrators also left behind their signature as NOP – Narodowe Odrodzenie Polski. During the same night, the same group reportedly vandalised the premises of the Jehovah's Witnesses religious group.European Roma Rights Centre In March 2000, in Łódź, swastikas and the slogan \\"Jews out!\\" along with NOP symbols were spray-painted on the home of Marek Edelman, who was the deputy commander in the Warsaw Ghetto uprising and the last of the leaders of the uprising still alive. The incident was condemned by the president and prime minister of Poland, who sent Edelman letters of support and apology.Anti-Semitic Incidents – March 2000, by the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs NOP front organization National-Radical Institute (Instytut Narodowo-Radykalny, INR) was involved in publishing Western and Polish Holocaust denial literature. In 1997, INR published a volume of translated works of Western Holocaust deniers under the title The Myth of the Holocaust. The same year, INR announced that there were no exterminations in gas chambers at Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. In 2006, the NOP was involved in campaigning to free convicted British Holocaust denier David Irving from prison in Austria, and produced a poster containing the slogan \\"David Irving – Uwolnić prawdę\\" (\\"David Irving – Free the truth\\".) The party also expressed support for the bombing of Israel at the time of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, with a poster image stating, \\"Bomby na Izrael – Już czas !!!\\" (\\"Bombs against Israel – it's about time!!!\\"). On August 13, 2006, NOP leader Adam Gmurczyk published a declaration on behalf of the NOP Executive Council titled Izrael musi zostać zniszczony!

It is the natural symbol of the island of Tenerife, together with the blue chaffinch. Dracaena draco in Vila Nova Sintra, Island of Brava, Cape Verde Dragon tree in the Will Rogers Memorial Park in Beverly Hills, California Description Dracaena draco is a monocot with a branching growth pattern currently placed in the asparagus family (Asparagaceae, subfamily Nolinoidae). When young it has a single stem. At about 10–15 years of age the stem stops growing and produces a first flower spike with white, lily-like perfumed flowers, followed by coral berries. Soon a crown of terminal buds appears and the plant starts branching. Each branch grows for about 10–15 years and re-branches, so a mature plant has an umbrella-like habit. It grows slowly, requiring about ten years to reach in height but can grow much faster. Being a monocotyledon, it does not display any annual or growth rings so the age of the tree can only be estimated by the number of branching points before reaching the canopy. The specimen called \\"El Drago Milenario\\" (the thousand-year-old dragon) growing at Icod de los Vinos in northwest Tenerife is the oldest living plant of this species. Its age was estimated in 1975 to be around 250 years, with a maximum of 365 years, not several thousand as had previously been claimed. It is also the largest D. draco tree alive. Its massive trunk comes from the contribution of clusters of aerial roots that emerge from the bases of lowest branches and grow down to the soil. Descending along the trunk, they cling tightly to the trunk, integrate with it and contribute to its radial growth. There is considerable genetic variation within the Canary Island dragon trees. The form found on Gran Canaria is now treated as a separate species, Dracaena tamaranae, based on differences in flower structure. The form endemic to La Palma initially branches very low with numerous, nearly vertical branches arranged fastigiately. There is a forest of such trees at Las Tricias, Garafia district, La Palma. Uses When the bark or leaves are cut they secrete a reddish resin, one of several sources of substances known as dragon's blood. Red resins from this tree contain many mono- and dimeric flavans that contribute to the red color of the resins. Dragon's blood has a number of traditional medical uses, although dragon's blood obtained from Dracaena draco was not known until the 15th century, and analyses suggest that most dragon's blood used in art was obtained from species of the genus Daemonorops. The primary and secondary plant body are the site of the secretory plant tissues that form dragon's blood. These tissues include ground parenchyma cells and cortex cells. Dragon's blood from Dracaena draco and Dracaena cinnabari can be distinguished by differences in 10 compounds and a dominant flavonoid DrC11 missing in Dracaena draco. The Guanches worshiped a specimen in Tenerife, and hollowed its trunk into a small sanctuary. Humboldt saw it at the time of his visit. It was tall and in circumference, and was estimated to be 6000 years old. It was destroyed by a storm in 1868. Cultivation Dracaena draco is cultivated and widely available as an ornamental tree for parks, gardens, and drought tolerant water conserving sustainable landscape projects. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

It is 44 km northwest of Wanganui. Patea is 17 km to the west, and Waitotara is 10 km to the southeast. State Highway 3 and the Marton - New Plymouth Line railway run through the town. The population was 798 in the 2013 Census, a decrease of 63 from 2006. History and culture Waverley was an important colonial stronghold during the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s, during which time the town was called Wairoa. The town is well known for its farming and thoroughbred stables. The race horse Kiwi was trained in the paddocks of a Waverley sheep farm by owner Snow Lupton and went on to go from last on the final bend to win the 1983 Melbourne Cup. Marae The local Te Wairoa-iti Marae and Maruata meeting house are a meeting place for Ngāti Tai, a hapū of Ngā Rauru Kītahi. Ironsand mining and renewable energy The Waipipi onshore ironsand mine operated near Waverley from 1971 to 1987, producing a total of 15.7 million tonnes of concentrate for export. The Waipipi site is now being developed for the Waipipi Wind Farm, with 31 turbines generating up to 133 MW. Features Waverley has a large sawmill which employs around 48 staff. The mill is the only major sawmill as far as New Plymouth in the north and Levin in the south. Waverley Beach Waverley has a black sand beach, the colour is due to iron sand deposits. The campground at the beach is well used in the summer months, as the beach provides safe surfing. Waverley has a number of cafes and coffee shops and is a popular place for tourists to stop for a break before entering the Taranaki region. Waverley and surrounding community has a South Taranaki District Council LibraryPlus, which provides a full library service and Council related services. These services include being able to register your dog, pay your rates or inquire about obtaining a building permit. Other services include a Tot Time for the under 5s and bookclub catering to intermediate and high school age children. The LibraryPlus also has three APN computers, offering free internet and Skype to the public. Waverley has a small skatepark as well as a playground in the town park that can be seen off the main road that runs through Waverley. Also there are well kept tennis courts and on Brassey St there is a small dirt jump track for push bikes. The locals call it the BMX track. The cave at Waverley's cave beach has collapsed due to erosion.

Geography  Eibar lies at an altitude of 121m above sea level, in the west of the province of Gipuzkoa, right next to Biscay. Eibar has an oceanic climate. The town lies in a narrow valley in a mountainous area, the highest mountains are between 700 and 800 metres high. Eibar is traversed by river Ego, which is a tributary of the Deba. Apart from the urban area, the municipality consists of five rural neighbourhoods: Otaola-Kinarraga, Aginaga, Arrate, Mandiola and Gorosta.  History  The city was chartered by Alfonso XI of Castile in 1346, receiving the name of Villanueva de San Andrés de Heybar. The feudal families that dominated the territory engaged in the War of the Bands. Eibar, like the rest of settlements in the valley, had an industry based on finery forges and the manufacture of arms. In 1766, Eibar got engaged in a social revolt known as the Machinada, and years later, in 1794, it was attacked by the French, who destroyed the town. In the 19th century, industrialisation transformed the production systems in the city and was accompanied by an important social movement. In the Carlist Wars, Eibar sided with the Liberals. Labour movement and socialism became particularly strong in Eibar. In 1931, Eibar was the first city in Spain to proclaim the Second Spanish Republic; in recognition it was given the title of \\"Very Exemplary City\\". In the Spanish Civil War, Eibar was practically destroyed. The rebuilding brought important industrial development and a demographic increase, as Eibar reached nearly 40,000 inhabitants in a few years. Due to the lack of space for enlargements, several factories moved to Durangaldea and Álava. The industrial crisis in the 1980s also made Eibar lose a great part of its population. At the beginning of the 21st century, Eibar's economy is based on industry and services.

It was completed in 1949. Historical background Merville was originally a private house, the modern-day Merville House, and estate built in 1795 by the Belfast banker and merchant John Brown (c.1740-1808). It was intended as his country retreat. Other fêted people would come to reside at the sprawling 24-acre shoreline manor. Between 1849–1887, for example, it was the home of Sir Edward Coey (1805–87), noted as the first and only Liberal Party Mayor of Belfast (1861) and prominent wealthy businessman, who helped make Belfast one of the most prosperous manufacturing centres in the world during the 19th century. However, between 1947-49 the Garden Village, the first such housing development in Ireland, was constructed. It was the idea of Lurgan-born builder Thomas McGrath who had established his company, Ulster Garden Villages Limited, in January 1946. Merville was designed with a French architectural twist, which initially influenced McGrath when serving in France as a Royal Engineers' soldier in the First World War. English architect Edward Prentice Mawson, eldest son of the garden designer Thomas Hayton Mawson, became McGrath's choice of architect for the project after being introduced to him by his site manager Jesse Williams who previously worked with Mawson in England. Mawson was the consultant architect of all of McGrath's ambitious Garden Village schemes in Northern Ireland. Apart from Merville these were at Abbots Cross, Fernagh, Prince's Park, King's Park, Muckamore and Whitehead, all in County Antrim. The Merville development was of 256 apartments, 28 cottage flats, 146 terraced and semi-detached houses and a row of 14 shops. The building work was completed in 1949. Conservation Area designation Merville Garden Village was designated a conservation area on 23 June 1995 because of its unique architecture and landscape and is the only neighbourhood in the borough of Newtownabbey to have this protection.Northern Ireland Planning Service website - conservation area map and documentation: accessed 12 July 2010 Merville House restoration In April 2000 Patricia Pepper, Jackie Thompson and Brian McNally began the restoration of Merville House when they met Belfast Regeneration Office officials, amongst others. The meeting with potential funders was initiated by local North Belfast MLA Fred Cobain after a chance meeting with MRA committee member Barbara McPhee. However, Stephen Hamilton, another Merville resident, joined the committee and formally set up Merville House Limited in February 2002 to help garner funding for the project. Other key players in the Merville House team included the late Jacqui Thompson, and Carol and Colin Simms who assisted with grant applications. The scheme was ultimately funded by Ulster Garden Villages Limited, International Fund for Ireland, Newtownabbey Borough Council, Newtownabbey Local Strategy Partnership and Belfast Local Strategy Partnership and a private donor. The house was officially re-opened on 27 April 2006 by Baroness Blood, a well- known community activist in west Belfast. Today Merville House is utilised by the whole community. 60th anniversary celebration On 25 September 2009 a celebration was organised by Merville Residents' Association to mark the 60th anniversary of the completion of the village with guest of honour Thomas Prentice Mawson,Thomas Prentice Mawson at the Mawson Kendal archive the son of Edward Prentice Mawson. Thomas was a member of the original Merville design team led by his father.

Bitchy Beginning in 1996, Warren served as the island's only police officer. However, since no one had been arrested on the island since the 1950s, her duties involved issuing driving licences and stamping visitors' passports. Warren had no qualifications or formal training to be a police officer, and was given the job because everyone on the island had a \\"job\\". The island's jail was described as \\"the size of a garden shed and riddled with termites\\", and its cells had been used to store building materials and lifejackets. When the island came into the international spotlight due to a sexual abuse scandal, a law enforcement professional sent to the island criticized their practices, stating \\"It was glaringly obvious ... that their standard of policing was not really adequate.\\" Warren was elected on 15 December 2004 to the Island Council. As a radio operator, she broadcasts under the call sign VP6MW. Pitcairn's sexual abuse trial Warren was an outspoken critic of accusations that the island's girls had been sexually abused when young, and the prosecution of a selected number of Pitcairn's male residents. She claimed that young girls on Pitcairn customarily became sexually active after age 12, a practice of underage sex that had been accepted as a Polynesian tradition since the settlement of the island in 1790. One resident, Olive Christian, said of her girlhood, \\"We all thought sex was like food on the table.\\" Many Pitcairn Island men blamed the British police for persuading the women involved to press charges. Some of the women agreed, and advocated a conspiracy theory that the trial was, in Warren's words, \\"a British plot to jail the [community's] able-bodied men and 'close' the island\\", and that the British officials \\"picked on all the viable young men, the ones who are the backbone of this place\\".Marks, Kathy.\\"Growing up on Pitcairn: 'We all thought sex was like food on table'\\", The Independent (London), 29 September 2004.

In contrast to cuisine classique, an older form of haute cuisine, nouvelle cuisine is characterized by lighter, more delicate dishes and an increased emphasis on presentation. It was popularized in the 1960s by the food critic Henri Gault, who invented the phrase, and his colleagues André Gayot and Christian Millau in a new restaurant guide, the Gault-Millau, or Le Nouveau Guide. History Menon, La nouvelle cuisine (1742) The term \\"nouvelle cuisine\\" has been used several times in the history of French cuisine, to mark a clean break with the past. In the 1730s and 1740s, several French writers emphasized their break with tradition, calling their cooking \\"modern\\" or \\"new\\". Vincent La Chapelle published his Cuisinier moderne in 1733–1735. The first volumes of Menon's Nouveau traité de la cuisine came out in 1739. And it was in 1742 that Menon introduced the term nouvelle cuisine as the title of the third volume of his Nouveau traité.Philip Hyman and Mary Hyman, \\"Printing the Kitchen: French Cookbooks, 1480–1800\\", in Jean-Louis Flandrin and Massimo Montanari, eds., Food: A Culinary History from Antiquity to the Present, 1999, (translation of Histoire de l'alimentation, 1996), p. 398 François Marin worked in the same tradition. In the 1880s and 1890s, the cooking of Georges Auguste Escoffier was sometimes described with the term.Mennell, p. 163 A left The modern usage is variously attributed to authors Henri Gault, Christian Millau, and André Gayot,André Gayot, \\"Of Stars and Tripes: The True Story of Nouvelle Cuisine\\" who used nouvelle cuisine to describe the cooking of Paul Bocuse, Alain Chapel, Jean and Pierre Troisgros, Michel Guérard, Roger Vergé, and Raymond Oliver, many of whom were once students of Fernand Point.Mennell, 163–164. Paul Bocuse claimed that Gault first used the term to describe food prepared by Bocuse and other top chefs for the maiden flight of the Concorde airliner in 1969.France on a Plate BBC Four TV programme 1 December 2008 The style Gault and Millau wrote about was a reaction to the French cuisine classique placed into \\"orthodoxy\\" by Escoffier. Calling for greater simplicity and elegance in creating dishes, nouvelle cuisine is not cuisine minceur (\\"thin cooking\\"), which was created by Michel Guérard as spa food. It has been speculated that the outbreak of World War II was a significant contributor to nouvelle cuisine's creation—the short supply of animal protein during the German occupation made it a natural development.Hewitt, 109–110. The \\"formula\\" thumb Gault and Millau \\"discovered the formula\\" contained in ten characteristics of this new style of cooking. The ten characteristics identified were:Gault&Millau;, history of the company , see paragraph \\"Les 10 commandements de la nouvelle cuisine\\" *A rejection of excessive complication in cooking. *Cooking times for most fish, seafood, game birds, veal, green vegetables and pâtés were greatly reduced in an attempt to preserve the natural flavours. Steaming was an important trend from this characteristic. *The cuisine was made with the freshest possible ingredients. *Large menus were abandoned in favour of shorter menus. *Strong marinades for meat and game ceased to be used. *Heavy sauces such as espagnole and béchamel were replaced by seasonings with fresh herbs, high-quality butter, lemon juice, and vinegar. *Regional dishes replaced as inspiration instead of cuisine classique *New techniques were embraced and modern equipment was often used; Bocuse even used microwave ovens. *The chefs paid close attention to the dietary needs of their guests through their dishes. *The chefs were extremely inventive and created new combinations and pairings. Abandonment There is a standing debate as to whether nouvelle cuisine has been abandoned. Much of what it stood for—particularly its preference for lightly presented, fresh flavours—has been assimilated into mainstream restaurant cooking. By the mid-1980s, some food writers stated that the style of cuisine had reached exhaustion and many chefs began returning to the cuisine classique style of cooking, although much of the lighter presentations and new techniques remained.

He was a very pious man and was said to have effected many miraculous cures for gout and toothache. The Schorne Well at North Marston, Schorne Lane During a drought, he discovered a well, whose waters were reputed to have miraculous properties. His reputation for holiness was such that he is believed to have cast the devil into a boot. He is often pictured holding a boot with a devil in it, which was thought to be the origin of the child's jack-in-the-box toy. However, the toy did not come about until over 500 years after Schorne's time. When he died, his shrine in the church at North Marston became a popular place of pilgrimage and he was regarded by many as a saint, although he was never canonised. His remains were later moved to St George's Chapel, Windsor, the burial place of English monarchs. Henry VIII, who was buried there, went on pilgrimage to Schorne's Well in July 1511http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2F4297_3DA98D16DA42063CFD530E25714FEF88_journals__HIS_HIS57_01_S0018246X13000368a.pdf&cover;=Y&code;=e9c7530ec97e6fb550aadfcbedad50cd Richard Rex, The Religion of Henry VIII, p.8 and May 1521.David Starkey, p.7, Henry The Holy Well was renovated in 2004/2005 and may still be seen in North Marston. There was a rector in Princes Risborough called John de Schorne in circa 1289, according to the list of rectors in the front of the parish register. It is likely to be the same person, though this is difficult to confirm for certain.Princes Risborough Parish Register, held at the Centre for Buckinghamshire Studies One of the two team benefices in Claydon Deanery is named after Schorne to this day.

Sometimes, it involves sending direct mail to the addresses of registered voters and compiling a list of addressees from which the mail is returned undelivered. If the mail is returned, it is seen as proof that the person does not live there. The list is then used to purge or challenge voters' registrations on the grounds that the voters do not legally reside at the registered addresses. In the United States, the practice of purging voter rolls has been challenged in the courts for perceived racial bias when minority neighborhoods are targeted, and it has been declared illegal under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by some courts. However, the practice is legal in many states and a 2018 legal challenge to Ohio's list-maintenance process was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court. The term has also been applied to recent cases of increased requirements for proof of identity, residency, and eligibility being added with the intent to limit the number of eligible voters. Method Voter caging typically refers to the practice of sending mail to addresses on the voter rolls, compiling a list of the mail that is returned undelivered, and using that list to purge or challenge voters' registrations and votes on the grounds that the voters on the roll do not legally reside at their registered addresses.http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/special/s0809a/final.pdf Usually, a political party will send out non-forwardable, first-class mail to voters or particular voters they want to target (often assumed to be a demographic that belongs to the opposing party). It will compile a list of voters for whom mail has been returned as undeliverable. The list is called a caging list. In some cases, such mail can be returned at a rate of 1 in every 15 letters sent out, as shown in Ohio in 2008 when the Board of Elections had 600,000 letters of voter confirmation returned as undeliverable. The party uses caging lists created by themselves or by the Board of Elections to challenge the registration status of voters and potentially purge them from the voting rolls under state laws that allow voters whose registrations are suspect to be challenged. When voters turn out to vote, they may be challenged and required to cast a provisional ballot. If investigation of the provisional ballot demonstrates that the voter has just moved or there is an error in the address and the voter is legally registered, the vote should be counted as well as vice versa. United States Legality Section 8 of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) has been interpreted to prohibit voter caging: \\"Pursuant to the NVRA, a voter may not be removed from the voters list unless (1) the voter has requested removal; (2) state law requires removal by reason of criminal conviction or mental capacity; (3) the voter has confirmed in writing that he has moved outside the jurisdiction maintaining the specific voter list, or (4) the voter both (a) has failed to respond to a cancellation notice issued pursuant to the NVRA and (b) has not voted or appeared to vote in the two federal general elections following the date of notice.\\" Voter caging may thus be legal if the primary purpose is to identify those who are not properly registered to vote and to prevent them from voting illegally but not if the primary purpose is to disenfranchise legitimately registered voters on the basis of a technicality. In January 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Husted v. Randolph Institute, a legal challenge to Ohio voter caging laws. The Court upheld Ohio's list-maintenance practice in a 5–4 decision issued in June 2018. Examples  1980s  In 1980, Republican Christian Conservative leader Paul Weyrich said, \\"I don't want everybody to vote. ... our leverage in the elections ... goes up as the voting populace goes down.\\" In 1981 and 1986, the Republican National Committee (RNC) sent out letters to African-American neighborhoods. When tens of thousands of them were returned undeliverable, the party successfully challenged the voters and had them deleted from voting rolls. The violation of the Voting Rights Act got the RNC taken to court by the Democratic National Committee (DNC). As a result of the case, the RNC entered a consent decree, which prohibited the party from engaging in anti-fraud initiatives that targeted minorities from conducting mail campaigns to \\"compile voter challenge lists.\\" The RNC sent letters to predominantly-black neighborhoods in New Jersey in 1981. When 45,000 letters were returned as undeliverable, the committee compiled a challenge list to remove those voters from the rolls. The RNC then sent off- duty law enforcement officials to the polls and hung posters in heavily black neighborhoods warning that violating election laws is a crime. The effect was to suppress or intimidate black voters. In Louisiana in 1986, the RNC tried to have 31,000 voters, mostly black, removed from the rolls when a party mailer was returned. Again, the action was challenged and dismissed. The consent decrees that resulted prohibited the party from engaging in anti-fraud initiatives that target minorities or from conducting mail campaigns to \\"compile voter challenge lists.\\" 2004 elections BBC journalist Greg Palast obtained an RNC document entitled \\"State Implementation Template III.doc\\" that described Republican election operations for caging plans in numerous states. The paragraph in the document pertaining to caging was: > V. Pre Election Day Operations New Registration Mailing > At whatever point registration in the state closes, a first class mailing > should be sent to all new registrants as well as purged/inactive voters. > This mailing should welcome the recipient to the voter rolls. It is > important that a return address is clearly identifiable. Any mail returned > as undeliverable for any reason, should be used to generate a list of > problematic registrations. Poll watchers should have this list and be > prepared to challenge anyone from this list attempting to vote.Johnston, > Mark. \\"Suppressing the Vote\\", E Pluribus Media, 14 Apr 2007, accessed 16 Nov > 2008 Shortly before the 2004 election, Palast also obtained a caging list for Jacksonville, Florida, which contained many blacks and registered Democrats. The list was attached to an email that a Florida Republican Party official was sending to RNC headquarters official Tim Griffin.Palast, Greg. \\"New Florida Vote Scandal Feared\\", BBC News, 24 Oct 2004, accessed 16 Nov 2008 The Republican National Committee also sent letters to minority areas in Cleveland, Ohio. When 35,000 letters were returned as undeliverable, the party employed poll watchers to challenge the voters' right to vote. Civil liberties groups challenged the RNC in a case that went to the Supreme Court, but the RNC was not stopped from challenging the voters.\\"Emails Detail RNC Voter Suppression in Five States\\", Truthout, accessed 16 Nov 2008. The caging list was named Exhibit 3. Similarly, the RNC sent out 130,000 letters to minority areas in mostly-black Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and it hoped to cage voters there in the Democrat stronghold. Journalists have found evidence that the RNC had also attempted to use voter caging to suppress or intimidate voters in states such as New Mexico, Ohio, Florida, Nevada, and Pennsylvania. For example, New Jersey RNC officials used caging lists to challenge absentee ballots and absentee ballot requests. 2008 elections As noted earlier, the Republican Secretary of State in Michigan was found purging voters from voting rolls when voter ID cards were returned as undeliverable. In the court challenge, the federal judge ordered the state to reinstate the voters. The judge ruled that the state's actions were in violation of the NVRA. His decision noted that there was no way to prevent qualified voters from being disfranchised as their cards may be returned as undeliverable by postal error, clerical error, inadvertent routing within a multi-unit dwelling, or even simple misspelling or transposition of numbers in an address.\\"Lawsuit says Michigan is violating Motor Voter Law\\", Michigan Messenger, accessed 16 Nov 2008 In December 2007, Kansas Republican Chair Kris Kobach sent an email boasting that \\"to date, the Kansas GOP has identified and caged more voters in the last 11 months than the previous two years!\\" Republicans sent out fundraising mailers to voters in five Florida counties: Duval, Hillsborough, Collier, Miami-Dade and Escambia, with 'do not forward' on the letters. The mailers included inaccurate voter ID numbers and ostensibly confirmed with voters they were registered as Republican. The RNC declined to discuss the mailer with the St. Petersburg Times. A representative denied that the mailing had anything to do with caging. Two top Florida elections officials, both Republicans, faulted the Republican mailing, calling it \\"confusing\\" and \\"unfortunate\\" because of a potential to undermine voter confidence by making them question the accuracy of their registrations.\\" Some officials expressed concern that the RNC would try to use a caging list derived from the mailers.Bousquet, Steve. \\"Democrats, Florida elections officials criticize GOP mailing\\", Tampa Bay, 16 September 2008, accessed 16 November 2008 In Northern California, reports of voter caging emerged when letters marked 'do not forward' were sent to Democrats with fake voter ID numbers. The description of the letters matches the letters that were sent out in Florida. See the caging letter that was sent out here. Many details on the letters were false; for example, the letters referred to a Voter Identification Division, but RNC personnel said they had no such department. The RNC did not return calls from a news organization regarding the letters. On October 5, 2008 the Republican Lieutenant Governor of Montana, John Bohlinger, accused the Montana Republican Party of vote caging to purge 6,000 voters from three counties that trend Democratic. The purges included decorated war veterans and active duty soldiers. Terri Lynn Land, the Secretary of State of Michigan, was found to be purging thousands of voters from voting rolls based on Voter ID cards being returned as undeliverable. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) took Michigan to court over the purges. Judge Stephen J. Murphy ruled the purge illegal under the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) of 1993 and directed Land to reinstate the affected voters. (See full ruling here ). The New York Times found in its review of state records that unlawful actions in six states led to widespread voter purges, which could have impacted the 2008 elections. Some of the actions were apparently the result of mistakes by the states in handling voter registrations and files as they tried to comply with a 2002 federal law related to running elections. Neither party was singled out, but because the Democratic Party registered more new voters this year, Democratic voters were more adversely affected by such actions of state officials.Urbina, Ian. \\"States Actions to Block Voters Appear Illegal\\", The New York Times, 9 October 2008, accessed 16 November 2008 2013: RNC v. DNC retention of consent decree In the years since the original 1982 consent decree on voter caging, a series of suits and countersuits between the RNC and the DNC as well as civil rights groups and labor unions ensued. The RNC would attempt to have the consent decree lifted and other parties would attempt to have the decree enforced in specific cases in which the plaintiffs would allege the RNC was in violation of the decree. In November 2008, the RNC sought to have the consent decree lifted in the U.S. District Court in Newark (Republican National Committee v. Democratic National Committee). Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise rejected the effort, and his ruling was upheld by the Third US Circuit Court of Appeals. The Third Circuit ruling found, \\"It is not in the public interest to vacate the decree.\\" It also stated, \\"If the RNC does not hope to engage in conduct that would violate the Decree, it is puzzling that the RNC is pursuing vacatur so vigorously notwithstanding the District Court's significant modifications to the Decree.\\" The RNC then petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States to hear an appeal of the Third Circuit ruling; the Supreme Court declined to hear the case, leaving the Third Circuit ruling to stand as legally binding. 2016: No new violation established  \\"On October 26, 2016, the DNC filed a motion asking that the court find the RNC had violated the decree. On November 5, after abbreviated discovery, the district court denied the DNC’s request, ruling that the DNC had not provided sufficient evidence of coordination between the Trump campaign and the RNC on ballot-security operations, but will allow the DNC to offer further evidence after the election,\\" according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law. 2016: Indiana voter purges In 2016, Indiana came under lawsuit for using software to purge voters that was described as \\"99% inaccurate\\". 2017: Consent decree expired  On 2018-01-08 the US District Court for the District of New Jersey refused to extend the consent decree beyond its previous December 1, 2017, expiration date, because, “the DNC did not prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, a violation of the [1982] Consent Decree before December 1, 2017”. Harvard Law Professor Nicholas Stephanopoulos suggested this decision was at least partially influenced by a general decline in the willingness of courts to intervene in election law issues, as witnessed by several moderately recent decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States, especially in Shelby County v. Holder. He wrote, “the half-century in which federal courts have decided redistricting cases can be divided into two periods: one lasting from the 1960s to the 1980s, in which voters and politicians were both comparatively nonpartisan; and another reaching from the 1990s to the present day, which amounts to perhaps the most hyperpartisan era in our country’s history.”.

Eaton co- founded the Rensselaer School in 1824 with Stephen van Rensselaer III \\"in the application of science to the common purposes of life\\". His books in the eighteenth century were among the first published for which a systematic treatment of the United States was attempted, and in a language that all could read. His teaching laboratory for botany in the 1820s was the first of its kind in the country. Eaton's popular lectures and writings inspired numerous thinkers, in particular women, whom he encouraged to attend his public talks on experimental philosophy. Emma Willard would found the Troy Female Seminary (Emma Willard School), and Mary Mason Lyon, the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary (Mount Holyoke College). Eaton held the rank of senior professor at Rensselaer until his death in 1842. Life Eaton's Herbarium, published in 1830, includes one hundred eleven specimens labeled in his handwriting. Amos Eaton was born at Chatham, Columbia County, New York on May 17, 1776. His father, Captain Abel Eaton was a farmer of comfortable means. He belonged to a family that traced its lineage to John Eaton, who arrived from Dover, England in 1635, settling two years later in Dedham, Massachusetts Bay Colony. Amos Eaton showed early preference for nature, by the age of sixteen constructing his own compass and chain to survey land as a chain bearer. Eaton was sent to Williamstown with the Rev. Dr. David Potter, of Spencertown, to study at Williams College. After graduating in 1799 with high marks in natural philosophy, he married the daughter of Malachi and Mary (née McCall) Thomas in October the same year, who died in 1802, leaving him a son. He arranged to study in the legal profession, studying law with the Hon. Elisha Williams, of Spencertown, and the Hon. Josiah Ogden, of New York, receiving admittance to the bar of the Supreme Court of New York. An association that he formed in New York with Dr. David Hosack and Dr. Samuel L. Mitchell, marked another determining point in his career; for, under their instruction, Eaton, became committed to the natural sciences, and in particular botany. Eaton practiced as a lawyer and as a land agent in Catskill, New York until 1810, when he was jailed on charges of forgery, spending nearly five years in prison. On his release in 1815, Eaton removed to New Haven at Yale College to take up the study of botany, chemistry and mineralogy under the tuition of Benjamin Silliman and Eli Ives. He then returned to Williams College to offer a course of lectures and volunteer classes of the students on botany, mineralogy zoology, and geology and published a botanical dictionary. In 1817, he published his Manual of Botany for the Northern States, the first comprehensive flora of the area; it ultimately went through eight editions. From Williams College the lectures were extended, in the shape of courses, with practical instructions to classes, to the larger towns of New England and New York. He returned to New York State in 1818 to Albany on DeWitt Clinton's preparations for him to deliver a series of lectures to the New York State Legislature on the state's geology in connection with the building of the Erie Canal and agriculture. Among the legislators who heard these lectures was Stephen Van Rensselaer III, patroon of Rensselaerswyck, who, in 1820, hired him to produce A geological Survey of the County of Albany, which was followed by geological surveys of much of the area through which the canal was built. Ultimately, Eaton would complete a survey of a section fifty miles wide from Buffalo to Boston. Eaton delivered talks at the Lenox Academy and the Medical College at Castleton, Vermont, where he was appointed professor of natural history in 1820. He gave lectures and practical instructions in Troy, laying the foundation as a result of his work, of the Lyceum of Natural History. In 1820 and 1821, Eaton initiated geological and agricultural surveys of Albany and Rensselaer counties at the expense of Van Rensselaer. Eaton's efforts led Troy as a depository of an extensive collection of geological specimens and comprehensive land surveys. Rensselaer School After co-founding the Rensselaer School in 1824, Van Rensselaer appointed Eaton to teach chemistry, experimental philosophy, geology, surveying, and the \\"laws regulating town officers and jurors.\\" By then Eaton was a well established public speaker on natural philosophy, touring and delivering lectures in the northeast. He was also a recognized pioneer in botany and principal land surveyor in the country. Eaton immediately set about to develop a new kind of institution devoted to the application of science to life, to a modern scientific prospectus, to new methods of instruction and examination, to recognize women in higher education a possibility, and to be practical in training for adults. Eaton's original aim was to also train teachers and disciples, which he did in large numbers. Students learned by doing, in sharp contrast with the conventional method of learning by rote. Students were made into experimenters and workers, and, in place of recitations, delivered lectures to one another. Eaton also often led day excursions, taking students to observe the application of science on nearby farms and in workshops, tanneries, and bleaching factories. They then returned to the laboratory, analyzing the principles involved. This, too, was an innovation, as it represented a reversal of the usual pedagogical method, which began with the principle and proceeded to the application. Eaton's principal focus was the training of students to teach science and its applications to the New York farming community via experimental demonstrations, a goal in keeping with Britain's mechanics' institutes and lyceum movements on diffusing useful knowledge. As a result, Eaton's system of instruction posed a challenge, if not a threat, to the traditional liberal-arts colleges, causing them to expand their own curricula and set up departments or schools of engineering and science. Formal engineering education would not be added at Rensselaer until 1828. After becoming professor of natural history at Harvard College in 1842, Asa Gray required some practical work of all of his students in botany along the lines established by Amos Eaton. Under his leadership, Troy, New York rivaled London, England as a center for geological studies in the first part of the 19th century. Eaton was interested in education for women, he had lectured them on his tour of New England, and he was persuaded that their failure in science was caused by inferior opportunity, not \\"perversion of female genius.\\" Eaton, clearly hoped to educate females at the school. He believed that women were capable of learning practical science and mathematics; they simply had not been taught the subjects at traditional female academies. His commitment to the cause led Eaton to enroll a class of eight young women in a special mathematics course to show that they could advance beyond \\"the speculative geometry and algebra as generally practiced in female seminaries.\\" When the students completed their course of study in 1835, Eaton requested a review of their progress by the school's less-than-enthusiastic board of examiners. The eight young ladies who participated in Eaton's experiment continued their education at the Troy Female Seminary. Eaton trained a bevy of future, notable, scientists and lectured to countless later educationists. Today Amos Eaton Hall houses the mathematics department, and the Amos Eaton Professorship is a faculty endowment named at the institute. The Amos Eaton Chair was originally given by students to Amos Eaton in 1839, but was later returned to the institute by the Eaton family. Personal life Following the death of his first wife, Polly Thomas, Eaton was remarried to Sally Cady in 1803, who bore him five sons. After her death he was remarried to Anna Bradley in 1816, by whom he had three sons and two daughters. She having died, Eaton married Alice Johnson in 1827, who bore him one son, and survived him about four years. Three of his children showed a preference for natural philosophy. Hezekiah Hulbert Eaton (1809-1832) became a chemist at Transylvania University but died at the age of twenty-three. Major General Amos Beebe Eaton (1806-1877) was a U.S. Army officer interested in natural philosophy. Sara Cady Eaton (1818-1881) taught natural sciences and modern languages in a young woman's seminary at Monticello, Illinois.

The original product consisted of powdered sodium hexametaphosphate (amorphous sodium polyphosphate), which in water would complex with ambient calcium ion and certain other cations, preventing formation of unwanted salts and interference by those cations with the actions of soap or other detergents. Its name was a portmanteau derived from the phrase \\"calcium gone\\".Walker, Andrea K. \\"Calgon, take me away...again,\\" The Baltimore Sun, Tuesday, June 22, 2010. Originally promoted for general use in bathing and cleaning, it gave rise to derivative products which have diverged from the original composition. Today, Calgon water softener contains the active ingredient sodium citrate and the now discontinued powder used zeolite and polycarboxylate, all of which are less problematic in wastewater treatment than phosphates. The Calgon water softener was first introduced to the market in 1930 by Calgon, Inc. of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Calgon, Inc. was acquired by Merck in 1968 and later broken up and sold off. Today, the Calgon brand is a owned by the Anglo-Dutch multinational company Reckitt Benckiser for use in Europe as a water softener, and in the United States by Ilex Consumer Products Group as a bath and beauty product.  Companies  The brands have their origin in Calgon, Inc. of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which first put Calgon water softener on the market in 1933.Trademark registration of \\"Calgon\\", U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

In this advertisement, a woman wearing a fluffy pink robe is seen in a chaotic home scenario. As tension rises, she utters the slogan \\"Calgon, take me away!\\" The next scene shows her relaxing in a bath in a quiet room.  \\"Ancient Chinese secret, huh?\\"  A set of commercials from the early 70s that ran for many years was for Calgon powdered water softener for laundry. They were set in a Chinese laundry somewhere in Anytown, USA. A Caucasian lady customer at the counter (American actress Pamela Wiley) asks \\"Mr. Lee\\" (played by Chinese- American actor Calvin Jung), \\"How do you get your shirts so clean?\\" He puts a finger to his lips and says, with a light Chinese accent, \\"Ancient Chinese secret.\\" The scene shifts to Mrs. Lee (Japanese-American actress Anne Miyamoto) in the back room, who overhears her husband and says – in a perfectly flat Midwestern accent – \\"My husband! Some hotshot! Here's his \\"Ancient Chinese Secret\\"—Calgon!\\" Mrs. Lee then praises new formula Calgon, stating that when it is added to rinse water it helps make clothes 30 percent cleaner. The customer is just about to exit the laundry when Mrs. Lee pops her head around the door frame and calls to her husband, \\"We need more Calgon!\\" The customer turns around and challenges Mr. Lee: \\"'Ancient Chinese Secret,' huh?\\" Mr. Lee smiles sheepishly. In other countries Calgon water softener adverts in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, and in the rest of Europe (including Italy) promote the product solely on the basis of saving washing machines from breakdown rather than any benefits to the clothing in the wash, although the products on sale are identical to those in the United States. The difference is accounted for by the prevalence in Europe of household washing machines with intrinsic heaters, whose elements benefit from the prevention of boiler scale. In Portugal, the Calgon advertisement jingle has been the same popular onePortuguese Calgon jingle - \\"Prolongue a vida da sua máquina com Calgon!\\" for almost 30 years. In Italy, Calgon was called Calfort from 1965 to spring 2008.  Criticism  In May 2011 a study by Which? magazine demonstrated that there was no evidence to suggest that washing machines lasted longer when treated with Calgon under \\"normal\\" washing conditions. Calgon disputes this, however. In October 2011, Dutch TROS TV program Radar also concluded Calgon water softener is not necessary under \\"normal\\" washing conditions for Dutch customers. In popular culture The slogan \\"Calgon, take me away!\\" has been referenced in a number of forms of entertainment. * In the Gilmore Girls episode \\"Lost & Found,\\" Lorelai mutters it under her breath after Luke reveals he escaped from the madness surrounding his nephew Jess by watching hockey in the diner on a TV the size of a toaster. *\\"Shake It Off,\\" a 2005 single by recording artist Mariah Carey. The chorus includes the lyric \\"Just like the Calgon commercial/I really gotta get up outta here/And go somewhere . . .\\" *The L7 song \\"Diet Pill\\" contains the line \\"Calgon can't take me away\\". *A 1997 episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 featuring the film Space Mutiny. Mike and the Bots parody the name of the character Elijah Kalgan (pronounced \\"Calgon\\") numerous times; for example, saying \\"Kalgan, blow me away!\\" after he shoots another character. *The slogan serves as the inspiration for the Dixie Chicks song \\"Cowboy Take Me Away\\". *In The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air episode \\"Bundle of Joy\\", Geoffrey utters the slogan after being overwhelmed by many different requests from the family in a daydream. He utters the slogan again during the end credits of that episode. *In the movie \\"Beerfest\\" the character Todd Wolfhouse utters the phrase after finding out his grandmother was a prostitute. The slogan \\"Ancient Chinese secret, huh?\\" has also been a reference in a number of forms of entertainment. *In the 1993 film Wayne's World 2, Wayne is sitting on his girlfriend's bed when they start talking about laundry. Wayne asks how she gets the laundry so clean. Casandra, portrayed by Tia Carrere, says \\"It's an ancient Chinese secret.\\" Wayne, portrayed by Mike Myers, says, \\"Ancient Chinese secret, huh?\\" while looking directly into the camera with a box of Calgon in his hand. *Saturday Night Live parodied the commercial with Jackie Chan (the show's guest host) in May 2000. The commercial parody played like the original, except the customer was male (played by Chris Parnell) and after he said \\"Ancient Chinese secret, huh?\\", the husband (Chan) attacked him and said \\"You tell anyone the secret, you're a dead man\\". *In the Arrested Development episode \\"Sword of Destiny\\", Lindsay recommends a Chinese herbal store called Ancient Chinese Secret to her brother, Michael. Michael and Tobias respond, in unison, \\"Ancient Chinese Secret, huh?\\" *Indie band Clem Snide has a song titled \\"Ancient Chinese Secret Blues.\\" The final lyrics of the song are \\"Calgon, take me away\\". *In an episode of Family Guy, after burning down Mort's pharmacy, Quagmire is stressing out from the guilt to which Peter says \\"Calgon, take him away!\\" In the next scene, we see Quagmire relaxing in a bathtub inside a bubble from which he gets up and says to Peter, \\"This isn't helping it's actually making it worse!\\" and we just see the bubble float away. They never explain how they get Quagmire down. In a much earlier episode (\\"A Picture's Worth a Thousand Words\\") the family visits the United Nations building in New York and Stewie looks on a computer belonging to the Chinese delegation and says \\"Hidden missile silos behind the Great Wall? Ancient Chinese Secret huh?\\" *In the Barenaked Ladies song \\"Crazy ABC's\\", from their album Snacktime!, Ed Robertson says that \\"X is for Xi'an, an ancient Chinese city, true.\\" Steven Page responds, \\"Ancient Chinese city, huh?

While being a new Bubble Bobble for a new generation, in actuality it takes place after Parasol Stars. Gameplay Screenshot of Bubble Symphony For this adventure, Bubblun and Bobblun, the familiar green and blue bubble dragons, are joined by girls Kululun (an orange dragon) and Cororon (a purple dragon). However, they are stated to be the children of the Bub and Bob of the first game. According to the intro, the four characters (as humans) inadvertently unleash Hyper Drunk, the final boss, while reading books. Hyper Drunk transforms the four into bubble dragons and banishes them to a new world. Characters * is the well-rounded character; he can fire three grouped bubbles straight ahead when powered up (the bubble button is held for a few seconds then released). * has faster speed in exchange for shorter range. He can shoot three bubbles in a spread pattern when powered up. * has the longest available range, but is slow. She can shoot her bubbles in a \\"T\\" pattern (forwards, backwards, and down) when powered up. * has the fastest bubble blowing and can shoot her bubbles in an inverted-\\"T\\" pattern (forwards, backwards, and up) when powered up. Although a sequel to Bubble Bobble, the game inaugurates few changes to the gameplay formula of that title. The small changes that have been made are that a boss is now encountered every five to ten levels, giving those scenes a similar prominence to Rainbow Islands, and the player takes a branching route through the levels by selecting one of two doors after every boss. The players can now charge the bubble shot; if released when the dragon's horns or bow is glowing, he/she will breathe three bubbles at once, with the specific formation dependent on the character chosen. The players must collect certain square cards with music notes inside, in order to get the 4 keys that lead to the final world or face an early false ending. Also, the characters have to collect a rod to turn their characters from their dragon to human forms during the course of the game. Cameos The game features cameos by other notable Taito characters or settings from games as diverse as The NewZealand Story, Darius, Space Invaders, Arkanoid, Liquid Kids, KiKi KaiKai (including Cindy, known in Japanese version as Sayo-chan and the English Pocky & Rocky games as Pocky), Yūyu no Quiz de Go! Go!, Pu·Li·Ru·La, and The Fairyland Story. Continuity * Within the context of the game world, Bubble Memories - The Story of Bubble Bobble III takes place before Bubble Symphony, even though the latter is released earlier. * All the enemies from the original Bubble Bobble appear in this game, along with a lot of newer enemies. * The credits (in the arcade version) show all the enemies' names, and those of characters who make cameos from other Taito games. Ports Bubble Symphony was released on the Sega Saturn in Japan, as well as via Taito Legends 2 on the PC in North America and Europe, and on the Xbox in Europe only. It was released on the PlayStation 2 in Japan only, via Taito Memories II Volume 2.

Written and directed by John Lasseter, this two-minute short film revolves around one larger and one smaller desk lamp. The larger lamp, named Luxo Sr., looks on while the smaller, \\"younger\\" Luxo Jr. plays exuberantly with a ball that it accidentally deflates. Luxo Jr. was Pixar's first animation after Ed Catmull and John Lasseter left Industrial Light & Magic's computer division of Cinetron Computer Systems. It is the source of Luxo Jr., the hopping desk lamp included in Pixar's corporate logo. Lasseter's aim was to finish the short film for the 1986 SIGGRAPH, an annual computer graphics conference attended by thousands of industry professionals. The film would come from his experiments with modeling his Luxo lamp. Lasseter worked to improve the story within the allotted two minutes. In animation, the film demonstrates the use of shadow maps within the rendering software. Lasseter applied the classic animation principles popularized by Disney's Nine Old Men to convey the lamps' emotions. Catmull and Lasseter worked around the clock, and Lasseter even took a sleeping bag into work and slept under his desk, ready to work early the next morning.The Pixar Story (2007) (TV documentary) In total it took about four and a half months to do.Feature: Toy Story: A Triumph of Animation The commitment paid off, and it was finished in time to be shown at SIGGRAPH. Before Luxo Jr. finished playing at SIGGRAPH, the crowd had already risen in applause.Paik, K., Lasseter, J., Iwerks, L., Jobs, S. & Catmull, E. (2007). To Infinity and Beyond!: The Story of Pixar Animation Studios. Chronicle Books. . Luxo Jr. is regarded as a breakthrough in the animation medium as a whole, changing traditionalists' interpretation of computer animation. The short was the first work of animation to use procedural animation, the software written by Eben Ostby.PIXAR: The Company and Its Founders - Sharyland ISD (page ten) It received an Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Short Film, becoming the first CGI film nominated for an Academy Award. The soundtrack music is an uncredited edit of three tunes on Brian Bennett's album Counterpoint In Rhythm: Finesse, Quicksilver, and Chateau Latour. In 2014, Luxo Jr. was deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. Plot In a dark room, a large illuminated balanced-arm desk lamp named Luxo Sr. sees a small yellow ball with a blue stripe and a red star on the front rolling up to him. He eyes the ball curiously, and pushes it away, but the ball comes back to him. He pushes it away again, but it rolls past him as Luxo Jr., his happy and excited son, hops over and plays with the ball. Luxo Jr then balances himself on top of the ball and bounces on it excessively, causing it to deflate. Luxo Jr. flips the deflated ball onto its side and looks up at Luxo Sr., who gently admonishes his son. Luxo Jr. then hops offscreen in shame, but is later seen playing with a beach ball. Luxo Sr. looks at the camera, then shakes his head in embarrassment. Background The Graphics Group, which was one third of the Computer Division of Lucasfilm, had been associating with Industrial Light & Magic on computer generated graphics in the early 1980s. In 1984, the group produced an animated short titled The Adventures of André and Wally B., which premiered at the annual SIGGRAPH conference to great fanfare. The group, which numbered 40 individuals, was spun out as a corporation in February 1986 with investment by Steve Jobs shortly after he left Apple Computer. Jobs paid $5 million to George Lucas for technology rights and put them and $5 million cash as capital into the company. A factor contributing to Lucas' sale was an increase in cash flow difficulties following his 1983 divorce, which coincided with the sudden dropoff in revenues from Star Wars licenses following the release of Return of the Jedi. The newly independent company was headed by Dr. Edwin Catmull as President and Dr. Alvy Ray Smith as Executive Vice President. They were joined on the Board of Directors by Steve Jobs who was Chairman. Pixar's small animation department—consisting of Lasseter, plus the part-time supporting efforts of several graphics scientists—was never meant to generate any revenue as far as Jobs was concerned.Price, p. 89 Catmull and Smith justified its existence on the basis that more films at SIGGRAPH like André and Wally B. would promote the company's computers. The group had no film at SIGGRAPH the preceding year, its last year under Lucas's wing, apart from a stained-glass knight sequence they produced for Young Sherlock Holmes. Catmull was determined that Pixar would have a film to show at its first SIGGRAPH as an independent company in August 1986. Luxo Jr. was produced by Pixar employee John Lasseter as a demonstration of the Pixar Image Computer's capabilities. Two other short animations by two of the company's graphics experts were in production during the time in which Luxo Jr. was conceived. Bill Reeves, who was interested in algorithms to re-create the turbulence of ocean waves, made Flags and Waves, with waves reflecting a sunset and lapping against the shore. Eben Ostby, a Brown architecture major turned graphics programmer, made Beach Chair, starring a chair that walked across the sand and nervously approached the water, dipped its front legs in just far enough to test the temperature, then scurried along. Reeves and Ostby also assisted Lasseter with model making and rendering on Luxo Jr. Production Lasseter's student film at CalArts, The Lady and the Lamp (1979), applied Walt Disney's observation that giving lifelike qualities to inanimate objects held comic potential. Luxo Jr. displayed a further insight, however: that inanimate objects as characters held the potential for dramatic value as well. The film would come from Lasseter's experiments with modeling his Luxo lamp. He had felt inspiration strike when fellow employee Tom Porter brought his infant son Spencer to work one day and Lasseter, playing with the child, became fascinated with his proportions. A baby's head was huge compared with the rest of its body, Lasseter realized. It struck Lasseter as humorous and he began to wonder what a young lamp would look like. He fiddled with the dimensions of all the parts of his Luxo model—all but the bulb, since lightbulbs come from a store and don't grow, he reasoned—and he emerged with a second character, Luxo Jr.Price, p. 90 Lasseter initially intended the film as a plotless character study. When he showed some early tests at animation festival in Brussels, respected Belgian animator Raoul Servais exhorted him, \\"No matter how short it is, it should have a beginning, a middle, and an end. Don't forget the story.\\" Lasseter protested that the film would be too short for a story. \\"You can tell a story in ten seconds\\", Servais responded. Lasseter was convinced. He devised a simple plot line in which the two lamps would play a game of catch with an inflated ball; Luxo Jr. would then approach the ball, hop onto it, bounce until the ball popped under him, and show dejection as the parent lamp looked on. Finally, Luxo Jr. would reappear feeling excited with a new, larger ball. Among the films shown at SIGGRAPH in 1985, Lasseter particularly admired a piece of character animation called Tony de Peltrie, from a group at the University of Montreal; it featured a strikingly expressive human character, an aging piano player who entertained while inwardly reflecting on better days, which inspired Luxo Jr. Apart from the film's hoped-for promotional value, Catmull and Smith rationalized the project as a test of \\"self- shadowing\\" in the rendering software- that is, the ability of objects to shed light and shadows on themselves. Before self-shadowing, CGI shadows were made by adding a flattened and darkened version of the shadowed object. On the technical level, the film demonstrates the use of shadow maps to simulate the shifting light and shadow given by the animated lamps.Foley, J. D., Van Dam, A., Feiner, S. K. & Hughes, J. F. (1995). Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice. Addison-Wesley. . The lights and the color surfaces of all the objects are calculated, each using a RenderMan surface shader, not surface textures. The articulation of \\"limbs\\" is carefully coordinated, and power cords trail believably behind the moving lamps. Because time and money were tight, Lasseter reduced the setting to its simplest elements. The background would be plain black and there would be no camera movement. His energies would rather be focused instead on working out techniques based on classic animation principles to convey emotion. Even though the characters were faceless and wordless, Lasseter shaped such subtleties as the speed of the child's hops and the way it carried its head to convey in an instant when the child was feeling joy and when it was feeling sadness. At every moment, the parent and child seemed to have a definite frame of mind.Price, p. 91 On the cinematic level, it demonstrates a simple and entertaining story, including effectively expressive individual characters.Courrier, K. (2005). Randy Newman's American Dreams: American Dreams. ECW Press. . Catmull and Lasseter worked around the clock, and Lasseter even took a sleeping bag into work and slept under his desk, ready to work early the next morning. Release Luxo Jr., alongside Flags and Waves and Beach Chair, premiered at SIGGRAPH in the Dallas Convention Center Arena, where the audience of six thousand immediately recognized Luxo Jr. as a breakthrough.Price, p. 92 Before Luxo Jr. finished playing at SIGGRAPH, the crowd had already risen in applause. \\"Pixar's marketing department did not go out of its way to point out that none of the film, not a single frame, had been rendered on a Pixar Image Computer\\", wrote David Price in his book The Pixar Touch. The audience was captivated by the far more realistic look than André and Wally B.. More significant than its photorealism, however, was its emotional realism. \\"It was perhaps the first computer-animated film that enabled viewers to forget they were watching computer animation\\", wrote Price. Afterward, Lasseter saw Jim Blinn, longtime professional colleague, approaching him, obviously readying a question. Lasseter braced for a question about the shadowing algorithm or some other recondite technical issue that he knew equally little about. Blinn instead asked whether the big lamp was the mother or the father. Although the memories of those involved are now hazy, Lasseter elsewhere referred to the parent lamp as the father. Lasseter then realized that he had succeeded in applying the Disney touch of thought and emotion to his characters. > \\"Luxo Jr. sent shock waves through the entire industry – to all corners of > computer and traditional animation. At that time, most traditional artists > were afraid of the computer. They did not realize that the computer was > merely a different tool in the artist's kit but instead perceived it as a > type of automation that might endanger their jobs.

The film was released for home video as part of Tiny Toy Stories in 1996, the VHS and DVD releases of Toy Story 2 in 2000, and Pixar Short Films Collection, Volume 1 in 2007. Legacy In 1986, Luxo Jr. received an Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Short Film. It was the first CGI film nominated for an Academy Award.Internet Movie Database Spinoffs of the short called \\"Surprise\\", \\"Light & Heavy\\", \\"Up and Down\\", and \\"Front and Back\\" have appeared on Sesame Street, which are now available on the Pixar Short Films Collection – Volume 1. Luxo Jr., without the cord, now serves as the mascot for Pixar Animation Studios, appearing in its production logo before and after every feature film (except for original printings of Toy Story, where he only appears after the film). From 1995 to 2007, he hops in from the right, stops next to the letter \\"I\\" in \\"PIXAR\\", and jumps on it until he has completely squashed it down, like he did to his rubber ball in the short. He then looks around to check if the letter had been squashed down, as the text \\"Animation Studios\\" fades in, then angles his head toward the camera; at this point, all the light typically fades to black except for his head, which goes out with a click after a moment. Occasionally, the head fades in time with the light—this is usually the case when the logo appears right before a Pixar feature film—but this is exceptional. Some variations of this sequence were created for specific Pixar films. For Cars, the message \\"Celebrating 20 Years\\" appeared as the background faded out, with Luxo Jr.'s head used as the zero. Pixar was founded in 1986; Cars, released in 2006, marked their 20th anniversary. In a teaser trailer for WALL-E, Luxo Jr.'s bulb burns out when he turns to look at the camera. WALL-E rolls in from the right, replaces the bulb with an energy-saving fluorescent bulb (in-keeping with the environmental themes of the film), and pats Luxo Jr. on the head before going back the way he came. However, he trips over the letter \\"R\\" in PIXAR as he goes, so he stops and positions his body to take its place, after which Luxo Jr. looks at the camera. WALL-E slightly peeks his eyes out, and the lights go out normally. This is also shown after the end credits of that film, also concluding with the \\"BNL\\" jingle and logo afterwards. A new variant of the sequence, optimized for 3-D projection, was first played with the 3D version of Up. The same animation as the regular logo plays as normal. However, the camera pans to the right while zooming out from the \\"P\\" in the PIXAR letters; therefore Luxo Jr. is seen approaching from the centre when he is first seen. Another anniversary variation was created for the 2011 film Cars 2, with the message \\"Celebrating 25 Years\\" appearing as the background faded out. The C appeared in the same position as Luxo Jr.'s head, which subsequently faded away to leave only the text, again celebrating Pixar's anniversary. This variation appears only in theatrical releases of the said film. However, in the DVD, as well the Blu-Ray releases and TV airing uses the standard logo instead. In Toy Story Toons, Luxo Jr. looks up to the falling curtain, which reveals the title, Woody and Buzz. Both pose as soon as the curtain fell completely. Yet another variation was used in Incredibles 2, where Luxo Jr. is in 2D and the background is reddish-yellow. Another variation of the logo is also seen after the credits of Toy Story 4 where instead of Luxo Jr., Duke Caboom rides in on his motorcycle and bounces the \\"I\\" down with it and receives a high-five from the Toy Soldier who had missed out on one earlier in the film at which the logo instantly cuts to black (the clap sound substituting for the light clicking off). Other appearances *In 2012, three design students, Adam Ben-Dror, Shanshan Zhou & Joss Doggett created a real life, animatronic version of Luxo Jr. They called the project Pinokio. *Since the short's release, the ball from the short has appeared in almost every Pixar production to date. *In 1987, a series of four Luxo Jr. shorts were produced for Sesame Street. The shorts produced were \\"Up & Down\\", \\"Front & Back\\", \\"Heavy & Light\\", and \\"Surprise\\". *In To Infinity and Beyond!: The Story of Pixar Animation Studios, a book of Pixar's history up through January 2007, film critic Leonard Maltin said that he \\"like[s] the fact that Luxo [Jr.] still has significance to the people at Pixar\\", and remarked that it was something like Disney's Mickey Mouse. *The short was later released on November 24, 1999 in theaters with Toy Story 2. This version is preceded with the modern Pixar logo and the message \\"In 1986, Pixar Animation Studios produced its first film. This is why we have a hopping lamp in our logo\\". This would carry over to the VHS and DVD releases of Toy Story 2 in 2000. There is also a scene in Toy Story 2 where Hamm frantically flicks through TV channels to find a certain commercial. One of the channels is showing Luxo Jr. *In Tin Toy, a picture of Luxo Jr. appears. *In Red's Dream, an older lamp appears. *At Disney California Adventure, an animatronic Luxo Jr. greets people on the way into Pixar Pier and Paradise Gardens Park. *Luxo Jr. also appears in Disney Infinity. *Luxo Sr. also appears a lot in the Toy Story series although, he is non-anthropomorphic, and is painted red. The red version had also had a cameo in Club Penguin: Elite Penguin Force. Somehow, it later was owned by Bonnie in the Toy Story Toon Hawaiian Vacation. In Toy Story 3, it is decorated with stickers. *An audio-animatronic version of Luxo Jr. used to appear in Pixar Place at the Disney's Hollywood Studios theme park. *The Pixar logo was parodied by the comedy website CollegeHumor in a short titled \\"Pixar Intro Parody\\". The logo plays out as normal but Luxo Jr. kills the letter I. As the other letters mourn the loss of capital I, Luxo Jr. is tried for murder and subsequently sentenced to the electric chair, leaving the other letters of the logo to celebrate his \\"death\\". *An online animator known as \\"PixarFan8695\\" has created a fan YouTube series known as the \\"Luxo Jr. Short Series\\" which is about the playful adventures of Luxo Jr.'s exciting life, along with his loving father, Luxo Sr, and his friends. *Luxo Jr. appears as a playable character in Lego The Incredibles. *One Robot Chicken sketch, known as \\"Good Cop Bad Lamp\\", features Luxo Jr. Notes References * 2009 Vintage Books edition: , Excerpt available at Google Books.

Formed from Old Red Sandstone, it is one of the tallest stacks in the United Kingdom. The Old Man is popular with climbers, and was first climbed in 1966. Created by the erosion of a cliff through hydraulic action some time after 1750, the stack is no more than a few hundred years old, but may soon collapse into the sea. Geography The Old Man stands close to Rackwick Bay on the west coast of Hoy, in Orkney, Scotland, and can be seen from the Scrabster to Stromness ferry. From certain angles it is said to resemble a human figure. Winds are faster than for nearly a third of the time, and gales occur on average for 29 days a year. Combined with the depth of the sea, which quickly falls to , high-energy waves on the western side of Hoy lead to rapid erosion of the coast. Geology The Old Man of Hoy is a red sandstone stack, perched on a plinth of basalt rock, and one of the tallest sea stacks in the UK. It is separated from the mainland by a 60-metre (200 ft) chasm strewn with debris, and has nearly vertical sides with a top just a few metres wide. The rock is composed of layers of soft, sandy and pebbly sandstone and harder flagstones of Old Red Sandstone, giving the sides a notched and slab-like profile. History A painting by William Daniell of the Old Man with two legs, some time around 1817 The Old Man is probably less than 250 years old, and may soon collapse. The stack is not mentioned in the Orkneyinga saga, written 1230, and on the Blaeu map of 1600, a headland exists at the point where the Old Man is now. The McKenzie map of Hoy of 1750 similarly shows a headland but no stack, but by 1819 the Old Man had been separated from the mainland. William Daniell sketched the sea stack at this time as a wider column with a smaller top section and an arch at the base, from which it derived its name. Sometime in the early nineteenth century, a storm washed away one of the legs leaving it much as it is today, although erosion continues. By 1992 a 40-metre (130 ft) crack had appeared in the top of the south face, leaving a large overhanging section that will eventually collapse. Human activity Climbing The Old Man of Hoy The stack was first climbed by mountaineers Chris Bonington, Rusty Baillie and Tom Patey in 1966. From 8–9 July 1967, an ascent featured in The Great Climb, a live BBC three-night outside broadcast, which had around 15 million viewers. This featured three pairs of climbers: Bonington and Patey repeated their original route, whilst two new lines were climbed by Joe Brown and Ian McNaught-Davis and by Pete Crew and Dougal Haston. In 1998, Catherine Destivelle was the first person to make a solo ascent of the Old Man of Hoy; she did so while four months pregnant. Red Széll became the first blind person to climb the Old Man, despite suffering from retinitis pigmentosa that left him with 5% vision. With assistance from Martin Moran and Nick Carter, he scaled the stack in 2013. The youngest person to climb the Old Man is Edward Mills, who was 8 years old when he completed the climb in 4 hours 55 minutes on 9 June 2018, to raise money for the charity Climbers Against Cancer as his mother had terminal breast cancer. He was accompanied by his trainers, Ben West and Cailean Harker. There are seven routes up the stack, the most commonly used of which is the original landward facing E1 (Extremely Severe). A log book in a Tupperware container is buried in a cairn on the summit, as an ascensionists' record. As many as fifty ascents of the stack are made each year. BASE jump Roger Holmes, Gus Hutchinson-Brown and Tim Emmett made the first BASE jump from the stack on 14 May 2008. Hutchinson-Brown died 11 days later during a jump in Switzerland. On 27 July 2019, two Poles, Filip Kubica and Dominik Grajner repeated this stunt and B.A.S.E. jumped from the top. Highline walking On 10 July 2017, Alexander Schulz completed a highline walk to and from the summit, at above the sea on a line long.

He is most famous as \\"The Poet of the Heath\\" for his novels and poems celebrating the people and landscape of the North German moors, particularly the Lüneburg Heath in Lower Saxony. Löns is well known in Germany for his famous folksongs. He was also a hunter, natural historian and conservationist. Despite being well over the normal recruitment age, Löns enlisted and was killed in World War I and his purported remains were later used by the German government for celebratory purposes.  Life and work  Hermann Löns was born on 29 August 1866 in Kulm (now Chełmno, Poland) in West Prussia. He was one of twelve siblings, of whom five died early. His parents were Friedrich Wilhelm Löns (1832–1908) from Bochum, a teacher, and Klara (née Cramer, 1844–96) from Paderborn. Hermann Löns grew up in Deutsch-Krone (West Prussia). In 1884, the family relocated back to Westfalen as his father found a position in Münster. A sickly child who survived typhus, Löns graduated from school on his second try with the Abitur in 1886. Urged by his father, he began to attend courses at Münster university in preparation for studying medicine. In 1887, he started his studies at the University of Greifswald. There he joined a dueling fraternity (Turnerschaft Cimbria), but was dismissed cum infamia (with infamy). In November 1888, Löns relocated to the university of Göttingen, but returned to Münster without having attained a degree. In fact, he never even enrolled at Göttingen but joined a drinking society called the Club der Bewusstlosen. At Münster he studied natural sciences emphasizing zoology at the Theologische und Philosophische Akademie from the spring of 1889 to autumn 1890. While there, he developed interests in environmental issues – protecting nature from damage by industrial activity – and in literature. However, he was also arrested in 1889 for disorderly conduct and sentenced to five days in jail for extinguishing gas lights and resisting arrest while drunk.Bronze statue of Löns as a hunter, erected in 2006 in left In the autumn of 1891, Löns decided to quit university without graduating and to become a journalist. He went first to Kaiserslautern, where he worked for the newspaper Pfälzische Presse. He was dismissed after five months for being late and for being drunk. Löns then went to Gera where he again became an assistant editor, this time for the Reußische Volkszeitung. He also lost that job after three weeks, again for being drunk. Löns then started work as a freelance reporter for the Hannoveraner Anzeiger. From 1892, Löns lived in Hanover and as a regional news editor wrote about a wide variety of subjects. Some of his writings with the pseudonym \\"Fritz von der Leine\\" were collected as a book Ausgewählte Werke von Fritz von der Leine, published in 1902. The year before, Löns had published a collection of poetry and a book of short stories on hunting. In 1902, Löns quit the newspaper and co-founded the rival newspaper Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung. In April 1903, he became its editor-in-chief, but by February 1904 the newspaper folded due to a lack of funds. Löns then joined the Hannoversches Tagblatt, writing as \\"Ulenspeigel\\". It was at this time that Löns began to make a name for himself as a writer on nature, in particular on the heaths of Lower Saxony (Heidedichter). In 1906, he published these writings in Mein braunes Buch which became his first literary success. Löns became editor-in-chief of the newspaper Schaumburg- Lippische Landeszeitung of Bückeburg in 1907, and remained in this position through April 1909. Once again, alcohol consumption was the cause of his dismissal. Freed from the need to do regular work as a newspaper man, Löns wrote and published several more of his works in 1909, emphasizing animal studies and characterization, including the popular Mümmelmann. That same year, he wrote three more novels, two of which were published in 1910, including Der Wehrwolf, his most successful book, depicting the bloody revenge of Lower Saxony peasants against marauding soldiers of the Thirty Years War. The poems contained in the collection Der kleine Rosengarten (1911) were referred to by Löns as \\"folk songs\\" (Volkslieder). They included the Matrosenlied (\\"Sailors' Song\\") with the chorus Denn wir fahren gegen Engelland (\\"For we are sailing against England\\"), which was put to music by Herms Niel and became one of the most-sung German military songs of World War II. A number of his poems from Der kleine Rosengarten were set to music by Franz Gabriel [1883-1929] in 1927-8 and published in an album with a dedication to the tenor, Richard Tauber, who recorded 13 of them for Odeon in August 1928. Another of his poems, Das Geheimnis [The Secret], beginning 'Ja, grün ist die Heide', was set to music by Karl Blume and recorded by Tauber in 1932.  Marriages and divorces  Löns had married Elisabet Erbeck (1864–1922), a divorced sales assistant, at Hanover in 1893 (engagement 1890, divorced 1901). She had five miscarriages and was committed to a sanatorium. Soon after the divorce, Löns had changed his confession from Catholic to Protestant and married Lisa Hausmann (an editorial assistant, born 1871), also at Hanover. He had a child with his second wife, but their son was mentally and physically handicapped. In 1911, his family left him, after he fired a shotgun inside their home. In the divorce proceedings he had a nervous breakdown. Löns refused to pay alimony and then left without leaving an address, travelling in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands. In November 1911, Löns considered suicide. In November 1912, he returned to Hanover and subsequently published two more collections of hunting and nature stories Auf der Wildbahn (1912) and Mein buntes Buch (1913), followed by his final novel, Die Häuser von Ohlendorf (1913). Suffering from bipolar disorder, Löns veered between depression and making fantastic plans for the future.  First World War service  At the age of 48, he volunteered for service with the German Army for the First World War. Due to his ill health and weak constitution, he was rejected initially by the military. It took the intervention of an officer friend of his for Löns to be accepted as a common fusilier by the Ersatzbatallion of the Regiment Generalfeldmarschall Prinz Albrecht von Preußen, also known as 73rd Fusilier Regiment. On 26 September 1914, just three weeks after enlisting on 3 September, Löns was killed in action during an assault on a French position at Loivre near Reims in France. Of the 120 men in his unit, only two dozen survived. Reception in National Socialist Germany Monument marking the spot where the purported remains of Hermann Löns were buried late in 1934 near Barrl. The \\"Lönsgrab\\" near Walsrode where the body was reburied in 1935. Löns' books continued to sell well after his death. By 1934, they had reached an overall circulation of 2.5 million books. By 1938, the Wehrwolf had sold more than 500,000 copies (reaching 865,000 copies by 1945). This made him one of the most successful authors in Germany at the time. Löns had considered himself as a poet of nature and he had argued eloquently for conservationism. He was co-initiator of the Heideschutzpark at Wilseder Berg which later grew into the Naturpark Lüneburger Heide (Lüneburg Heath Nature Park), the first nature reserve in Germany. Löns combined these sentiments, based not least on the ' of the turn of the century (as represented by Adolf Bartels) with an increasingly radical nationalism, the racist concept of an \\"aristocratic peasantry\\" (Blood and soil), enmity towards the metropolis (Berlin) and xenophobia. His literary work has been categorised as part of the folkish philosophy, although his character was also one of intense individualism.Wolff, M., \\"Hermann Löns: An Introduction to his Life and Work\\" in TYR, vol. 1 (Ultra Press, 2002), p. 143. As some of his writings had included nationalistic ideas, he was considered by the National Socialists as one of their writers. Some parts of his works conformed well with the \\"Blood and soil\\" ethos endorsed by National Socialist ideologues such as Walther Darre and Alfred Rosenberg, which lauded the peasantry and small rural communities as the true character of the German nation. On 5 January 1933, a French farmer found the boots of a German soldier in one of his fields. With the help of the local sexton, he uncovered a skeleton and identification tag. The sexton buried the body in an individual grave in a German graveyard near Loivre. It took almost 18 months for the tag to reach Berlin via the German embassy in France. This tag was subsequently lost during an Allied bombing raid on Berlin; an extant photograph of it does not allow a definite conclusion on whether the tag said \\"F.R.\\" (Füselier-Regiment) or \\"I.R.\\" (Infanterie-Regiment). However, on 8 May 1934 the newspaper Völkische Beobachter announced that the grave of Löns had been discovered. In October 1934, at the behest of Adolf Hitler, Löns' purported body was exhumed and brought to Germany. There was not any medical examination to try to verify that these were indeed the remains of the writer. In 1919, several bodies had been exhumed in the vicinity of the area where Löns was killed and transferred to the war cemetery at Luxembourg. From there they were moved to a mass grave near Loivre, where they remain to this day, according to the Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge, a charity. It is quite possible that Löns' remains were among them. The exhumed body of Löns was supposed to be buried in the Lüneburg Heath, given his association with the area. However, the exact location of his new grave posed problems. The initial plan to bury him at the Sieben Steinhäuser, a megalithic site, was abandoned since the military at the time had (still secret) plans to establish the military training facility Bergen in the area. An alternative site near Wilseder Berg was rejected due to concerns about the environmental effect of large numbers of visitors to the grave. Finding a suitable burial place became an issue for the top echelons of the regime, including Hermann Göring, Rudolf Heß, Joseph Goebbels, Werner von Blomberg and even Adolf Hitler. On 30 November 1934, members of the Sturmabteilung (SA), apparently on orders from Goebbels, removed the remains from the graveyard chapel in Fallingbostel where they were awaiting reburial. They buried them near the roadside of what was then Reichsstrasse 3 (now Bundesstrasse 3 or B3) south of Barrl, near the area known presently as Reinsehlen Camp. However, on 2 August 1935, the anniversary of the start of World War I, on the initiative of von Blomberg, Minister of War, the Reichswehr exhumed the remains and transferred them to the Tietlinger Wacholderhain near Walsrode, where an earlier (1929) memorial had been erected, for a ceremonial reburial. Later reception After 1945, Löns remained a bestselling author. The company that published most of his works estimated that by 1966 they had sold 7.5 million books written by him. The 1932 movie Grün ist die Heide (Green Is The Heath) was based on Löns' writings. It was remade with great commercial success in 1951, featuring Sonja Ziemann and Rudolf Prack, and again in 1972. In 1956, Dieter Borsche featured as Löns in ', a German movie based on Löns' autobiography Das zweite Gesicht. Memorials Müden. There are 113 memorials total to Löns in Germany plus eight in Austria and 19 in other countries. Additionally, 247 streets and roads in Germany have been named for him. Twelve schools have his name. Finally, there is Hermann Löns Stadium at Paderborn.

A leading German intellectual during the Weimar Republic, his criticism of Hitler and the Nazi party forced him to leave Germany with his family in 1933. He died prematurely in New York City in 1936. Biography Hegemann was the son of Ottmar Hegemann (1839-1900), a manufacturer in Mannheim, and Elise Caroline Friedrich Vorster (1846-1911), daughter of Julius Vorster, a founder of Chemische Fabrik Kalk in Cologne. He graduated from Gymnasium Schloss Plön in 1901. Hegemann began college studies in Berlin, studied art history and economics in Paris, economics at the University of Pennsylvania and in Strasbourg, and completed his doctorate in economics at Munich in 1908.Werner Oechslin, \\"Between America and Germany: Werner Hegemann's Approach to Urban Planning,\\" in Berlin/New York: Like and Unlike: Essays on Architecture and Art from 1870 to the Present, ed. Josef Paul Kleihues and Christina Rathgeber, New York: Rizzoli, 1993, , pp. 281–95, p. 287. In the United States in 1909, he worked for the \\"Boston 1915\\" Exposition, a five-year plan to develop and improve the Boston area. Back in Berlin the following year Hegemann was General Secretary of the 1910 Universal City Planning Exhibition held in Berlin in May and June.Christiane Crasemann Collins, Werner Hegemann and the Search for Universal Urbanism, New York: Norton, 2005, , p. 35. The exhibition aroused great interest and was reprised in refocused form in Düsseldorf; Hegemann wrote an article about it for a general audience and a two-volume official book.\\"Die Städtebau-Ausstellung und ihre Lehren,\\" Die Woche; Der Städtebau nach den Ergebnissen der allgemeinen Städtebau-Ausstellung in Berlin, 1911, 1913. Collins, p. 51, p. 373, note 45; p. 375, note 72. These city planning exhibitions were the first of their kind: Hegemann was in the right place at the right time to play a formative role in the early development of city planning as a profession. In 1912 Hegemann accepted an invitation from Frederic C. Howe, Director of the People's Institute in New York, to give lectures on city planning in over 20 American cities. Edward Marshall, \\"VASTER SKYSCRAPERS INEVITABLE, SAYS GERMAN EXPERT; Dr. Werner Hegemann, One Of the World's Greatest Authorities on City Planning, Says Our Present High Buildings Mean Intolerable Congestion and Will Be Succeeded by Structures Ten Times as Great but More Widely Separated – Faults of Subways Pointed Out,\\" New York Times magazine, April 6, 1913 (pdf) retrieved December 18, 2010.Collins, p. 20. He impressed his American hosts by attaching more importance to city infrastructure and organization than to appearance. In his lectures he debated the opportunities and dangers of urban development and advised against imitating European models. When his tour ended in California, he bought a motorcar and toured the west coast up to Seattle. The municipalities of Oakland and Berkeley then engaged him to do a comprehensive planning report, published in 1915 as the \\"Report on a City Plan for the Municipalities of Oakland & Berkeley.\\" Hegemann's report developed a hierarchy of planning areas and called for the cooperation of urban groups to steer urban development, encouraging the turn from inner-city embellishment to optimizing urban functions. In early 1914 Hegemann embarked by ship on a return voyage to Germany via the Pacific, in order to visit the Far East and Australia. That July he boarded a German flagged ship in Australia for the final leg of the journey home. World War I broke out as the ship reached the coast of Africa, and it dodged English warships for several weeks before being sequestered for months off the coast of Mozambique. In April, 1915, Hegemann stowed-away on a Norwegian vessel bound for the United States, where he spent the duration of the war. Hegemann remained in the United States until early 1921. He established \\"Hegemann & Peets,\\" a firm specializing in city and suburban planning based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with landscape architect Elbert Peets.\\"Biographical résumé of Elbert Peets,\\" On the Art of Designing Cities: Selected Essays of Elbert Peets, Ed. Paul David Spreiregen, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT, 1966, OCLC 604141820, p. 226. The firm designed the Washington Highlands Historic District, and Wyomissing Park, a \\"Modern Garden Suburb\\" in Reading, Pennsylvania. Hegemann and Peets together published \\"The American Vitruvius: An Architects' Handbook of Civic Art,\\" a \\"thesaurus\\" of civic art for architects, commenting on about 1200 examples of the discipline. In 1918, visiting his friend Fiske Kimball at the University of Michigan, Hegemann met Ida Belle Guthe, daughter of Karl Eugen Guthe. In 1920 the couple married at her home in Ann Arbor, Michigan. In 1921 Hegemann returned to Europe with his new bride. After a sojourn in Naples, Italy, in 1922 he designed and built a home in Nikolassee, outside of Berlin. He became editor of Wasmuths Monatshefte für Baukunst, published by Ernst Wasmuth Verlag, known for its international coverage of architecture and Hegemann's incisive critiques. With a literary-polemical style of criticism that stood out sharply from the manifesto style of the moderns, Hegemann opposed formal modernism and academic traditions and favored a moderate modernity. He encouraged people with different views to write to the journal, and facilitated debates among schools of architectural thought. Hegemann also wrote several historical books debunking German heroes and, in 1930, the work for which he is best remembered, Das steinerne Berlin: Geschichte der Grössten Mietkasernenstadt der Welt (Stony Berlin: History of the Largest Tenement City in the World), which combines historical and architectural criticism. In the introduction he wrote, \\"It is a German illusion to believe in the possibility of creating an intellectual capital as long as the so-called educated people are almost proud of their inadequate understanding of urban planning.\\"Oechslin, p. 292 (translation there). After a lecture tour in South America, where he again spoke out against following European aesthetics and planning, he devoted himself increasingly to warnings against the National Socialists in a series of political articles, culminating in the book \\"Entlarvte Geschichte\\" (\\"History Unmasked\\"). Hegemann fled Germany in February, 1933 (the month after Hitler took power), upon publication of \\"Entlarvte Geschichte,\\" dedicated sarcastically to Adolf Hitler. In May, 1933, he was denounced by the Nazis as an \\"Historical Forger,\\" and his books were burned in the Nazi book burnings.Collins, pp. 306, 316. After several months in Geneva and France, Hegemann was invited by Alvin Johnson to teach urban planning at The New School for Social Research in New York beginning in November 1933.Collins, p. 321. That October Hegemann left Europe for the United States with his wife and four young children. He was one of many intellectuals essentially exiled by Nazi Germany in the 1930s. Upon arriving in New York City on November 4, 1933, Hegemann opined that the German people would not tolerate Hitler for more than two more years. He began lecturing at the New School and organizing assistance for intellectuals and scholars detained by the Nazis in Germany. In 1935 he was also retained as a lecturer at Columbia University.Collins, p. 335. The Nazis seized Hegemann's house in Nikolassee in 1935, and in 1938 revoked his doctorate. Meanwhile, he made efforts to stir public opinion in the case of Carl von Ossietzky, another German critic of Hitler, who was arrested and imprisoned by the Nazi's in the same month that Hegemann left Germany. He also wrote in support of Roosevelt's New Deal. Hegemann saw the rise of Hitler in Germany as emerging from a historical context of Germans celebrating and idealizing strong men. Characteristically overstating the point, he criticized a century or more of \\"craving for submission\\" by German professors, bureaucrats and professionals, and observed that if Hitler ever decided to stop enslaving the nation, he would be \\"overwhelmed by an irresistible rush into ever deeper submission\\" by those with \\"collusive attitudes toward war- hungry German nationalism.\\" Similarly, in 1934 Hegemann viewed the persecution of Jews in Germany as \\"in conformity with Old Prussian tradition\\" of antisemitism, and as consistent with the German aristocracy's lack of interest in \\"intellect and higher culture.\\" Writing from the perspective of 1934, Hegemann could not have foreseen that five years later Hitler would begin a world war resulting in the deaths of 60 million people. Hegemann's early years in the United States, along with his strong education and broad interests, made him an intermediary between architects and city planners throughout Europe and on both sides of the Atlantic. In particular, his The American Vitruvius refers extensively to European design, taking many examples from his book on the Berlin 1910 exhibition, while in Amerikanische Architektur und Stadtbaukunst he informs German architects of American solutions.Oechsler, p. 290. However, his emphasis on urban planning rather than purely formal considerations and possibly his having not been present during the development of the Modern Movement in architecture in Europe put him at odds with modernists. For example, in 1929 he was forced to retract an accusation that Martin Wagner's primary activity as chief of city planning for Berlin was funnelling architectural commissions to extremist friends,Oechslin, p. 292; p. 295, note 119. and he labeled Le Corbusier's Ville Contemporaine project for transforming Paris \\"only vieux jeu\\" (old hat) and sarcastically predicted that it was likely to be realized, > [not] because [the skyscrapers] are desirable, healthy, beautiful, and > reasonable from the perspective of urban planning but because they are > theatrical, romantic, unreasonable, and generally harmful, and because it is > part of the money-making activities of a metropolis, in what is literally > the world's most international city, Paris, to serve the need for sensation > and the vices of native and imported fools.Oechslin, p. 291, quoting in > translation from \\"Kritik des Grosstadt-Sanierungs-Planes Le Corbusiers,\\" Der > Städtebau (1927) p. 70. Der Gerettete Christus Hegemann authored the book Der Gerettete Christus (Translated as Christ Rescued) in 1933. The book discusses a variant of the swoon hypothesis that Jesus did not die on the cross but only fainted.Jocz, Jakób. (1981). The Jewish People and Jesus Christ After Auschwitz: A Study in the Controversy Between Church and Synagogue. Baker Book House. p. 234 Death In New York in early 1936, Hegemann became ill, first diagnosed with Sciatica and then hospitalized with apparent pneumonia.Collins, pp. 362, 363. While bed-ridden in New York City he worked on his last book, the three-volume \\"City Planning, Housing,\\" intended to supplement and update The American Vitruvius. Eventually completed by two co-editors, the last volume appeared in 1938.Collins, p. p. 352.Oechslin, p. 291, referring to it as City/Planning/Housing. Hegemann died on April 12, 1936, at age 55 in New York City. The treating doctor opined that the cause of death was Tuberculous meningitis.

Like most dinosaur genera, Acrocanthosaurus contains only a single species, A. atokensis. Its fossil remains are found mainly in the U.S. states of Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming, although teeth attributed to Acrocanthosaurus have been found as far east as Maryland, suggesting a continent wide range. Acrocanthosaurus was a bipedal predator. As the name suggests, it is best known for the high neural spines on many of its vertebrae, which most likely supported a ridge of muscle over the animal's neck, back, and hips. Acrocanthosaurus was one of the largest theropods, reaching in length, and weighing up to . Large theropod footprints discovered in Texas may have been made by Acrocanthosaurus, although there is no direct association with skeletal remains. Recent discoveries have elucidated many details of its anatomy, allowing for specialized studies focusing on its brain structure and forelimb function. Acrocanthosaurus was the largest theropod in its ecosystem and likely an apex predator which preyed on sauropods, ornithopods, and ankylosaurs. Discovery and naming Acrocanthosaurus is named after its tall neural spines, from the Greek ɑκρɑ/akra ('high'), ɑκɑνθɑ/akantha ('thorn' or 'spine') and σɑʊρος/sauros ('lizard'). There is one named species (A. atokensis), which is named after Atoka County in Oklahoma, where the original specimens were found. The name was coined in 1950 by American paleontologists J. Willis Stovall and Wann Langston Jr. Langston had proposed the name \\"Acracanthus atokaensis\\" for the genus and species in his unpublished 1947 master's thesis, but the name was changed to Acrocanthosaurus atokensis for formal publication. Skull of NCSM 14345, North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences The holotype and paratype (OMNH 10146 and OMNH 10147), discovered in the early 1940s and described at the same time in 1950, consist of two partial skeletons and a piece of skull material from the Antlers Formation in Oklahoma. Two much more complete specimens were described in the 1990s. The first (SMU 74646) is a partial skeleton, missing most of the skull, recovered from the Twin Mountains Formation of Texas and currently part of the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History collection. An even more complete skeleton (NCSM 14345, nicknamed \\"Fran\\") was recovered from the Antlers Formation of Oklahoma by Cephis Hall and Sid Love, prepared by the Black Hills Institute in South Dakota, and is now housed at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh. This specimen is the largest and includes the only known complete skull and forelimb. Skeletal elements of OMNH 10147 are almost the same size as comparable bones in NCSM 14345, indicating an animal of roughly the same size, while the holotype and SMU 74646 are significantly smaller. The presence of Acrocanthosaurus in the Cloverly Formation was established in 2012 with the description of another partial skeleton, UM 20796\\\\. This specimen, consisting of parts of two vertebrae, partial pubic bones, a femur, a partial fibula, and fragments, represents a juvenile animal. It came from a bonebed in the Bighorn Basin of north-central Wyoming, and was found near the shoulder blade of a Sauroposeidon. An assortment of other fragmentary theropod remains from the formation may also belong to Acrocanthosaurus, which may be the only large theropod in the Cloverly Formation. Acrocanthosaurus may be known from less complete remains outside of Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming. A tooth from southern Arizona has been referred to the genus, and matching tooth marks have been found in sauropod bones from the same area. Several teeth from the Arundel Formation of Maryland have been described as almost identical to those of Acrocanthosaurus and may represent an eastern representative of the genus. Many other teeth and bones from various geologic formations throughout the western United States have also been referred to Acrocanthosaurus, but most of these have been misidentified; there is, however, some disagreement with this assessment regarding fossils from the Cloverly Formation. Description Relative sizes of Acrocanthosaurus and a human Acrocanthosaurus was among the largest theropods known to exist. The largest known specimen (NCSM 14345) is estimated to have measured from snout to tail tip and weighed , with an upper maximum weight of within the realm of possibility for this specimen. Its skull alone was nearly in length. Skull diagram of NCSM 14345 The skull of Acrocanthosaurus, like most other allosauroids, was long, low and narrow. The weight-reducing opening in front of the eye socket (antorbital fenestra) was quite large, more than a quarter of the length of the skull and two-thirds of its height. The outside surface of the maxilla (upper jaw bone) and the upper surface of the nasal bone on the roof of the snout were not nearly as rough- textured as those of Giganotosaurus or Carcharodontosaurus. Long, low ridges arose from the nasal bones, running along each side of the snout from the nostril back to the eye, where they continued onto the lacrimal bones. This is a characteristic feature of all allosauroids. Unlike Allosaurus, there was no prominent crest on the lacrimal bone in front of the eye. The lacrimal and postorbital bones met to form a thick brow over the eye, as seen in carcharodontosaurids and the unrelated abelisaurids. Nineteen curved, serrated teeth lined each side of the upper jaw, but a tooth count for the lower jaw has not been published. Acrocanthosaurus teeth were wider than those of Carcharodontosaurus and did not have the wrinkled texture that characterized the carcharodontosaurids. The dentary (tooth-bearing lower jaw bone) was squared off at the front edge, as in Giganotosaurus, and shallow, while the rest of the jaw behind it became very deep. Acrocanthosaurus and Giganotosaurus shared a thick horizontal ridge on the outside surface of the surangular bone of the lower jaw, underneath the articulation with the skull. Skeletal diagram The most notable feature of Acrocanthosaurus was its row of tall neural spines, located on the vertebrae of the neck, back, hips and upper tail, which could be more than 2.5 times the height of the vertebrae from which they extended. Other dinosaurs also had high spines on the back, sometimes much higher than those of Acrocanthosaurus. For instance, the unrelated Spinosaurus had spines nearly tall, about 11 times taller than the bodies of its vertebrae. The lower spines of Acrocanthosaurus had attachments for powerful muscles like those of modern bison, probably forming a tall, thick ridge down its back. The function of the spines remains unknown, although they may have been involved in communication, fat storage, muscle or temperature control. All of its cervical (neck) and dorsal (back) vertebrae had prominent depressions (pleurocoels) on the sides, while the caudal (tail) vertebrae bore smaller ones. This is more similar to carcharodontosaurids than to Allosaurus. Life restoration Aside from its vertebrae, Acrocanthosaurus had a typical allosauroid skeleton. Acrocanthosaurus was bipedal, with a long, heavy tail counterbalancing the head and body, maintaining its center of gravity over its hips. Its forelimbs were relatively shorter and more robust than those of Allosaurus but were otherwise similar: each hand bore three clawed digits. Unlike many smaller fast-running dinosaurs, its femur was longer than its tibia and metatarsals, suggesting that Acrocanthosaurus was not a fast runner. Unsurprisingly, the hind leg bones of Acrocanthosaurus were proportionally more robust than its smaller relative Allosaurus. Its feet had four digits each, although as is typical for theropods, the first was much smaller than the rest and did not make contact with the ground. Classification and systematics Restored head Acrocanthosaurus is classified in the superfamily Allosauroidea within the infraorder Tetanurae. This superfamily is characterized by paired ridges on the nasal and lacrimal bones on top of the snout and tall neural spines on the neck vertebrae, among other features. It was originally placed in the family Allosauridae with Allosaurus, an arrangement also supported by studies as late as 2000. Most studies have found it to be a member of the related family Carcharodontosauridae. At the time of its discovery, Acrocanthosaurus and most other large theropods were known from only fragmentary remains, leading to highly variable classifications for this genus. J. Willis Stovall and Wann Langston Jr. first assigned it to the \\"Antrodemidae\\", the equivalent of Allosauridae, but it was transferred to the taxonomic wastebasket Megalosauridae by Alfred Sherwood Romer in 1956. To other authors, the long spines on its vertebrae suggested a relationship with Spinosaurus. This interpretation of Acrocanthosaurus as a spinosaurid persisted into the 1980s, and was repeated in the semi-technical dinosaur books of the time. Artist's impression of a pair of Acrocanthosaurus on the move Tall spined vertebrae from the Early Cretaceous of England were once considered to be very similar to those of Acrocanthosaurus, and in 1988 Gregory S. Paul named them as a second species of the genus, A. altispinax. These bones were originally assigned to Altispinax, an English theropod otherwise known only from teeth, and this assignment led to at least one author proposing that Altispinax itself was a synonym of Acrocanthosaurus. These vertebrae were later assigned to the new genus Becklespinax, separate from both Acrocanthosaurus and Altispinax. Most cladistic analyses including Acrocanthosaurus have found it to be a carcharodontosaurid, usually in a basal position relative to the African Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus from South America. It has often been considered the sister taxon to the equally basal Eocarcharia, also from Africa. Neovenator, discovered in England, is often considered an even more basal carcharodontosaurid, or as a basal member of a sister group called Neovenatoridae. This suggests that the family originated in Europe and then dispersed into the southern continents (at the time united as the supercontinent Gondwana). If Acrocanthosaurus was a carcharodontosaurid, then dispersal would also have occurred into North America. All known carcharodontosaurids lived during the early-to-middle Cretaceous Period. The following cladogram after Novas et al., 2013, shows the placement of Acrocanthosaurus within Carcharodontosauridae. Paleobiology Growth and longevity From the bone features of the holotype OMNH 10146 and NCSM 14345, it is estimated that Acrocanthosaurus required at least 12 years to fully grow. This number may have been much higher because in the process of bones remodeling and the growth of the medullary cavity, some Harris lines were lost. If accounting for these lines, Acrocanthosaurus needed 18–24 years to be mature. Forelimb function Restoration of Acrocanthosaurus engaging in alt= Like those of most other non-avian theropods, Acrocanthosaurus forelimbs did not make contact with the ground and were not used for locomotion; instead, they served a predatory function. The discovery of a complete forelimb (NCSM 14345) allowed the first analysis of the function and range of motion of the forelimb in Acrocanthosaurus. The study examined the bone surfaces which would have articulated with other bones to determine how far the joints could move without dislocating. In many of the joints, the bones did not fit together exactly, indicating the presence of a considerable amount of cartilage in the joints, as is seen in many living archosaurs. Among other findings, the study suggested that, in a resting position, the forelimbs would have hung from the shoulders with the humerus angled backward slightly, the elbow bent, and the claws facing medially (inwards). The shoulder of Acrocanthosaurus was limited in its range of motion compared to that of humans. The arm could not swing in a complete circle, but could retract (swing backward) 109° from the vertical, so that the humerus could actually be angled slightly upwards. Protraction (swinging forward) was limited to only 24° past the vertical. The arm was unable to reach a vertical position when adducting (swinging downwards) but could abduct (swing upwards) to 9° above horizontal. Movement at the elbow was also limited compared to humans, with a total range of motion of only 57°. The arm could not completely extend (straighten), nor could it flex (bend) very far, with the humerus unable even to form a right angle with the forearm. The radius and ulna (forearm bones) locked together so that there was no possibility of pronation or supination (twisting) as in human forearms. None of the carpals (wrist bones) fit together precisely, suggesting the presence of a large amount of cartilage in the wrist, which would have stiffened it. All of the digits were able to hyperextend (bend backward) until they nearly touched the wrist. When flexed, the middle digit would converge towards the first digit, while the third digit would twist inwards. The first digit of the hand bore the largest claw, which was permanently flexed so that it curved back towards the underside of the hand. Likewise, the middle claw may have been permanently flexed, while the third claw, also the smallest, was able to both flex and extend.Mounted skeleton seen from aboveAfter determining the ranges of motion in the joints of the forelimb, the study went on to hypothesize about the predatory habits of Acrocanthosaurus. The forelimbs could not swing forward very far, unable even to scratch the animal's own neck. Therefore, they were not likely to have been used in the initial capture of prey and Acrocanthosaurus probably led with its mouth when hunting. On the other hand, the forelimbs were able to retract towards the body very strongly. Once prey had been seized in the jaws, the heavily muscled forelimbs may have retracted, holding the prey tightly against the body and preventing escape. As the prey animal attempted to pull away, it would only have been further impaled on the permanently flexed claws of the first two digits. The extreme hyperextensibility of the digits may have been an adaptation allowing Acrocanthosaurus to hold struggling prey without fear of dislocation. Once the prey was trapped against the body, Acrocanthosaurus may have dispatched it with its jaws. Another possibility is that Acrocanthosaurus held its prey in its jaws, while repeatedly retracting its forelimbs, tearing large gashes with its claws. Other less probable theories have suggested the forelimb range of motion being able to grasp onto the side of a sauropod and clinging on to topple the sauropods of smaller stature, though this is unlikely due to Acrocanthosaurus having a rather robust leg structure compared to other similarly structured theropods. Brain and inner ear structure Digital endocranial endocast of the braincase of specimen NCSM 14345 In 2005, scientists reconstructed an endocast (replica) of an Acrocanthosaurus cranial cavity using computed tomography (CT scanning) to analyze the spaces within the holotype braincase (OMNH 10146). In life, much of this space would have been filled with the meninges and cerebrospinal fluid, in addition to the brain itself. However, the general features of the brain and cranial nerves could be determined from the endocast and compared to other theropods for which endocasts have been created. While the brain is similar to many theropods, it is most similar to that of allosauroids. It most resembles the brains of Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus rather than those of Allosaurus or Sinraptor, providing support for the hypothesis that Acrocanthosaurus was a carcharodontosaurid. The brain was slightly sigmoidal (S-shaped), without much expansion of the cerebral hemispheres, more like a crocodile than a bird. This is in keeping with the overall conservatism of non-coelurosaurian theropod brains. Acrocanthosaurus had large and bulbous olfactory bulbs, indicating a good sense of smell. Reconstructing the semicircular canals of the ear, which control balance, shows that the head was held at a 25° angle below horizontal. This was determined by orienting the endocast so that the lateral semicircular canal was parallel to the ground, as it usually is when an animal is in an alert posture. Possible footprints Some Texas counties where large theropod tracks have been discovered in the Glen Rose Formation. The Glen Rose Formation of central Texas preserves many dinosaur footprints, including large, three-toed theropod prints. The most famous of these trackways was discovered along the Paluxy River in Dinosaur Valley State Park, a section of which is now on exhibit in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, although several other sites around the state have been described in the literature. It is impossible to say what animal made the prints, since no fossil bones have been associated with the trackways. However, scientists have long considered it likely that the footprints belong to Acrocanthosaurus. A 2001 study compared the Glen Rose footprints to the feet of various large theropods but could not confidently assign them to any particular genus. However, the study noted that the tracks were within the ranges of size and shape expected for Acrocanthosaurus. Because the Glen Rose Formation is close to the Antlers and Twin Mountains Formations in both geographical location and geological age, and the only large theropod known from those formations is Acrocanthosaurus, the study concluded that Acrocanthosaurus was most likely to have made the tracks. Digital fly-through over the Glen Rose trackway, reconstructed from photographs The famous Glen Rose trackway on display in New York City includes theropod footprints belonging to several individuals which moved in the same direction as up to twelve sauropod dinosaurs. The theropod prints are sometimes found on top of the sauropod footprints, indicating that they were formed later. This has been put forth as evidence that a small pack of Acrocanthosaurus was stalking a herd of sauropods. While interesting and plausible, this hypothesis is difficult to prove and other explanations exist. For example, several solitary theropods may have moved through in the same direction at different times after the sauropods had passed, creating the appearance of a pack stalking its prey. The same can be said for the purported \\"herd\\" of sauropods, who also may or may not have been moving as a group. At a point where it crosses the path of one of the sauropods, one of the theropod trackways is missing a footprint, which has been cited as evidence of an attack. However, other scientists doubt the validity of this interpretation because the sauropod did not change gait, as would be expected if a large predator were hanging onto its side. Pathology The skull of the Acrocanthosaurus atokensis holotype shows light exostotic material on the squamosal. The neural spine of the eleventh vertebra was fractured and healed while the neural spine of its third tail vertebra had an unusual hook-like structure.Molnar, R. E., 2001, Theropod paleopathology: a literature survey: In: Mesozoic Vertebrate Life, edited by Tanke, D. H., and Carpenter, K., Indiana University Press, p. 337-363. Paleoecology Acrocanthosaurus carrying a Tenontosaurus carcass away from a pair of Deinonychus Definite Acrocanthosaurus fossils have been found in the Twin Mountains Formation of northern Texas, the Antlers Formation of southern Oklahoma, and the Cloverly Formation of north-central Wyoming and possibly even the Arundel Formation in Maryland. These geological formations have not been dated radiometrically, but scientists have used biostratigraphy to estimate their age. Based on changes in ammonite taxa, the boundary between the Aptian and Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous has been located within the Glen Rose Formation of Texas, which may contain Acrocanthosaurus footprints and lies just above the Twin Mountains Formation. This indicates that the Twin Mountains Formation lies entirely within the Aptian stage, which lasted from 125 to 112 million years ago. The Antlers Formation contains fossils of Deinonychus and Tenontosaurus, two dinosaur genera also found in the Cloverly Formation, which has been radiometrically dated to the Aptian and Albian stages, suggesting a similar age for the Antlers. Therefore, Acrocanthosaurus most likely existed between 125 and 100 million years ago. During this time, the area preserved in the Twin Mountains and Antlers formations was a large floodplain that drained into a shallow inland sea. A few million years later, this sea would expand to the north, becoming the Western Interior Seaway and dividing North America in two for nearly the entire Late Cretaceous. The Glen Rose Formation represents a coastal environment, with possible Acrocanthosaurus tracks preserved in mudflats along the ancient shoreline. As Acrocanthosaurus was a large predator, it is expected that it had an extensive home range and lived in many different environments in the area. Potential prey animals include sauropods like Astrodon [published online] or possibly even the enormous Sauroposeidon, as well as large ornithopods like Tenontosaurus. The smaller theropod Deinonychus also prowled the area but at in length, most likely provided only minimal competition, or even food, for Acrocanthosaurus.

Ohi Day commemorates the rejection by Greek Prime Minister Ioannis Metaxas of the ultimatum made by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini on 28 October 1940, the Hellenic counterattack against the invading Italian forces at the mountains of Pindus during the Greco-Italian War, and the Greek Resistance during the Axis occupation. Ultimatum This ultimatum, which was presented to Metaxas by the Italian ambassador to Greece, Emanuele Grazzi, shortly after 03:00 am on 28 October 1940, who had just come from a party in the Italian embassy in Athens, demanded Greece allow Axis forces to enter Greek territory and occupy certain unspecified \\"strategic locations\\" or otherwise face war. It was allegedly answered with a single laconic word: όχι (No!). However, his actual reply was, “Alors, c’est la guerre!” (Then it is war!). In response to Metaxas's refusal, Italian troops stationed in Albania, then an Italian protectorate, attacked the Greek border at 05:30 am--the beginning of Greece's participation in World War II (see Greco-Italian War and the Battle of Greece).

It is currently known to include two species: C. saharicus and C. iguidensis, which are among the larger theropods, nearly as large as or even larger than Tyrannosaurus, Giganotosaurus, and Spinosaurus. The genus Carcharodontosaurus is named after the shark genus Carcharodon, itself composed of the Greek (, meaning \\"jagged\\" or \\"sharp\\") and (, \\"teeth\\"), and the suffix ' (\\"lizard\\"). Discovery and naming Restored skull of SGM-DIN 1, the neotype of C. saharicus In 1924, two teeth were found in the Continental intercalaire of Algeria, showing what were at the time unique characteristics. These teeth were described by Depéret and Savornin (1925) as representing a new taxon, which they named Megalosaurus saharicus and later categorized in the subgenus Dryptosaurus. Some years later, paleontologist Ernst Stromer described the remains of a partial skull and skeleton from Cenomanian aged rocks in the Bahariya Formation of Egypt (Stromer, 1931); originally excavated in 1914, the remains consisted of a partial skull, teeth, vertebrae, claw bones and assorted hip and leg bones. The teeth in this new finding matched the characteristics of those described by Depéret and Savornin, which led to Stromer conserving the species name saharicus but finding it necessary to erect a new genus for this species, Carcharodontosaurus, for their strong resemblance to the teeth of Carcharodon (Great white shark). The fossils described by Stromer were destroyed in 1944 during World War II, but a new, more complete skull was found in the Kem Kem Formation of Morocco during an expedition led by paleontologist Paul Sereno in 1995, near the Algerian border and the locality where the teeth described by Depéret and Savornin (1925) were found. The teeth found with this new skull matched those described by Depéret and Savornin (1925) and Stromer (1931); the rest of the skull also matched that described by Stromer. This new skull was designated as the neotype by Brusatte and Sereno (2007) who also described a second species of Carcharodontosaurus, C. iguidensis from the Echkar Formation of Niger, differing from C. saharicus in aspects of the maxilla and braincase. Description Size comparison of selected giant theropod dinosaurs, C. saharicus in orange Carcharodontosaurus includes some of the longest and heaviest known carnivorous dinosaurs, with various scientists proposing length estimates for the species C. saharicus ranging between and weight estimates between .Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. (2012) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages, Winter 2011 Appendix. In 2016 Molina-Pérez & Larramendi gave a length of and a weight of for C. saharicus, and a length of and a weight of for C. iguidensis. Carcharodontosaurus were carnivores, with enormous jaws and long, serrated teeth up to eight inches long. A skull length of about 1.53 to 1.6 meters (5.0 to 5.2 ft) has been restored for C. saharicus,Molina-Pérez & Larramendi 2016. Récords y curiosidades de los dinosaurios Terópodos y otros dinosauromorfos, Larousse. Barcelona, Spain p. 142 and the skull of C. iguidensis is reported to have been about the same size. Currently, the largest-known theropod skull belongs to another huge carcharodontosaurid dinosaur, the closely related Giganotosaurus (with skull length estimates up to 1.95 meters) (6.4 ft). Gregory S. Paul estimates Carcharodontosaurus iguidensis at and .Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press. Brain and inner ear Life restoration of C. saharicus In 2001, Hans C. E. Larsson published a description of the inner ear and endocranium of Carcharodontosaurus saharicus. Starting from the portion of the brain closest to the tip of the animal's snout is the forebrain, which is followed by the midbrain. The midbrain is angled downwards at a 45-degree angle and towards the rear of the animal. This is followed by the hindbrain, which is roughly parallel to the forebrain and forms a roughly 40-degree angle with the midbrain. Overall, the brain of C. saharicus would have been similar to that of a related dinosaur, Allosaurus fragilis. Larsson found that the ratio of the cerebrum to the volume of the brain overall in Carcharodontosaurus was typical for a non-avian reptile. Carcharodontosaurus also had a large optic nerve. Size comparison between the destroyed holotype (yellow) and the neotype (gold) with a human The three semicircular canals of the inner ear of Carcharodontosaurus saharicus – when viewed from the side – had a subtriangular outline. This subtriangular inner ear configuration is present in Allosaurus, lizards, turtles, but not in birds. The semi-\\"circular\\" canals themselves were actually very linear, which explains the pointed silhouette. In life, the floccular lobe of the brain would have projected into the area surrounded by the semicircular canals, just like in other non-avian theropods, birds, and pterosaurs.

It resulted from cross- breeding between local Dutch chickens and various \\"Shanghai\\" birds imported from Asia to Europe in the later part of the nineteenth century; these may have been of Brahma, Cochin or Croad Langshan type. It is named for the town and gemeente (municipality) of Barneveld, in Gelderland in the central Netherlands. The hens are good layers of large brown eggs and, unlike some other breeds, continue to lay well during winter.  History  Double-laced cock Bantam hen Eggs In the 1850s Asian chickens began to arrive in Europe, where they were at first known as \\"Shanghai\\" chickens. These were initially cross-bred among themselves, and only later developed into breeds such as the Brahma, the Cochin and the Croad Langshan. From about 1865, some of these Shanghai chickens were cross-bred with local farmyard chickens in the area of Barneveld. Towards the end of the nineteenth century there may also have been some breeding with a type called Amerikaanse Nuthoenders (\\"American utility birds\\"), which showed some similarity to the American Wyandotte; it is not known what these birds were, or if they were really American. In about 1906 there may also have been some cross-breeding with British Buff Orpington stock. According to Hans Schippers, the greatest influence on the characteristics of the Barnevelder was from the Langshan, which contributed hardiness, brown eggs, and good winter production. The name Barnevelder was first used for birds shown at the Landbouwtentoonstelling or agricultural exhibition held in The Hague in 1911. From about this time attempts were made to breed for consistent type and colour. However, when the Dutch Poultry Club discussed whether to accept the Barnevelder as a new breed in 1919, it was found to be too variable. In 1921 a breeders' association was formed, and the first standard was drawn up. The breed was recognised in 1923. From about 1921 the Barnevelder was exported to the United Kingdom, where brown eggs were in demand. The birds were at first very variable, with single-laced, double-laced or – mostly – partridge plumage. Partridge and double-laced varieties were included in the British Poultry Standard; the double-laced became the principal variety. There may have been some cross-breeding with Indian Game stock. The partridge variety was added to the Standard of Perfection of the American Poultry Association in 1991.  Characteristics  The original and most well-known Barnevelder variety is the double-laced variety, which has a single vertical comb and yellow legs, but other varieties also exist. In standard-sized birds, the pattern is expressed on a brown (e^b/e^b) background. Only the females express the double-laced pattern, whereas the males are melanized black-breasted reds. The Barnevelder Club of the Netherlands recognizes the double-laced, double-laced blue, black, and white varieties in both large fowl and bantam versions. The club also recognizes the silver double-laced variety, but only the bantam version. They note that a few new varieties, such as the silver-black double-laced, are in development but are not yet officially recognised. Some countries recognize varieties not recognised in the Netherlands, such as the autosexing barred, dark brown, partridge, chamois, blue, and silver varieties.

It was originally called Acid pH1 and published by Sonic Foundry, later by Sony Creative Software as Acid Pro, and since spring 2018 by Magix as both Acid Pro and a simplified version, Acid Music Studio. Acid Pro 8 (the current version ) supports 32-bit and 64-bit architectures, and has MIDI, ASIO, VST, VST3, DirectX Audio, and 5.1 surround sound support.  History  Acid was first launched in 1998, as Acid pH1, by Sonic Foundry in Madison, Wisconsin. It was a loop-based music sequencer, in which Acid Loop files could be simply drag- and-dropped then automatically adjust to the tempo and key of a song with virtually no sonic degradation. A website for budding musicians using Acid technology was set up, named AcidPlanet.com. The software became very popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s among composers, producers, and DJs interested in quickly creating beats, music textures, or complete compositions and orchestrations, that would work with virtually any tempo or key signature. Sonic Foundry sold its Acid, Vegas, Sound Forge, CD Architect, Siren, VideoFactory, ScreenBlast, and Batch Converter product lines to Sony Pictures Digital in July 2003; the merger resulted in the new Sony Creative Software division. Sony's Acid Pro 6 (released in the third quarter of 2006) introduced a full-digital audio workstation that also included MIDI and multitrack audio recording with full support for ASIO computer-audio and VST synthesizer-plugin standards. On May 20, 2016, German company Magix Software GmbH announced they had acquired the majority of the products in the Sony Creative Software portfolio. These include Acid Pro, Vegas Pro, Movie Studio, and Sound Forge Pro. Acid Pro 8, the first version since Magix's acquisition, was announced on January 21, 2018 and released in spring 2018. The update came with new modern features including an enhanced interface, support for 64-bit, additional samples, VST3 support, over 20 DirectX audio effects, the ability to mix in 5.1 surround sound, and new features named Media Manager, BeatMapper, and Chopper. In one version or another, Acid Pro runs on PCs with all versions of Microsoft Windows since Windows 2000; Acid Pro 8 requires Windows 8.1 or later. Versions do not exist for macOS or Linux.  Acid Loops  Acid Loop (trademark), also Acidized or Acidified loop (generic terms), refers to a sound clip which can be repeated and transposed to form a song with minimal manual adjustment. Acidized loops contain tempo and key information, so that Acid can properly time-stretch and pitch-shift the clip to fit into an existing track structure. An Acidized loop is a specially prepared WAV audio file, which can be created using an audio-editing tool such as Sound Forge. The technology was created in 1998 for Sonic Foundry's original Acid pH1 software. Sony and Magix later sold series of Acidized loop sample CDs to be used with Acid Pro, as have various third-party companies. Since then, this looping technique has been adopted by the majority of other digital audio workstations on the market, sometimes with competing brand names for the feature, such as Cakewalk Sonar (calling it Groove Clips), and Cubase (calling it Audio Warp). Many DAWs can also directly support Acidized loops intended for use in Acid Pro. Other versions * Acid Music Studio is a simplified, lower-cost version of Acid Pro.

The adult insects are less well known, due to their relatively short lifespans compared to the larvae and mostly fly at dusk or after dark, and may be mistakenly identified as dragonflies or damselflies; they are sometimes known as antlion lacewings, and in North America, the larvae are sometimes referred to as doodlebugs because of the strange marks they leave in the sand. Antlions have a worldwide distribution. The greatest diversity occurs in the tropics, but a few species are found in cold-temperate locations, one such being the European Euroleon nostras. They most commonly occur in dry and sandy habitats where the larvae can easily excavate their pits, but some larvae hide under debris or ambush their prey among leaf litter. Antlions are poorly represented in the fossil record. Myrmeleontiformia is generally accepted to be a monophyletic group, and within the Myrmeleontoidea, the antlions' closest living relatives are thought to be the owlflies (Ascalaphidae). A 2019 study finds Myrmeleontidae to be monophyletic, aside from Stilbopteryginae and Palparinae, which form separate clades closer to Ascalaphidae. The predatory actions of the larvae have attracted attention throughout history, and antlions have been mentioned in literature since classical times. Etymology The exact meaning of the name \\"antlion\\" is uncertain. It has been thought to refer to ants forming a large percentage of the prey of the insect, the suffix \\"lion\\" merely suggesting destroyer or hunter. In any case, the term seems to go back to classical antiquity. The antlion larva is often called a \\"doodlebug\\" in North America because of the odd winding, spiralling trails it leaves in the sand while relocating, which look as if someone has been doodling. The scientific name of the type genus Myrmeleo – and thus, the family as a whole – is derived from Ancient Greek léon (λέων) \\"lion\\" + mýrmex (μύρμηξ) \\"ant\\", in a loan translation of the names common across Europe. In most European and Middle Eastern languages, at least the larvae are known under the local term corresponding to \\"antlion\\". Description Antlions can be fairly small to very large neuropterans, with wingspans ranging from . The African genus Palpares contains some of the largest examples. Acanthaclisis occitanica is the largest European species, with an wingspan, and most North American species approach this size. The adult has two pairs of long, narrow, multiveined, translucent wings and a long, slender abdomen. Although they somewhat resemble dragonflies or damselflies, they belong to a different infraclass of winged insects. Antlion adults are easily distinguished from damselflies by their prominent, apically clubbed antennae which are about as long as the head and thorax combined. Also, the pattern of wing venation differs, and compared to damselflies, the adults are very feeble fliers and are normally found fluttering about at night in search of a mate. Adult antlions are typically nocturnal, and rarely seen by day. Males of most species have a unique structure, a bristle-bearing knob known as a \\"pilula axillaris\\", at the base of the rear wing. The abdomen in males is usually longer than in females and often has an extra lobe. The tip of the abdomen of females shows greater variation than that of males, depending perhaps on oviposition sites, and usually bears tufts of bristles for digging and a finger-like extension. The antlion larva has a robust fusiform body, a very plump abdomen, and a thorax bearing three pairs of walking legs. The prothorax forms a slender mobile \\"neck\\" for the large, square, flattened head, which bears an enormous pair of sickle-like jaws with several sharp, hollow projections. The jaws are formed by the maxillae and mandibles; the mandibles each contain a deep groove over which the maxilla fits neatly, forming an enclosed canal for injecting venom to immobilise the victim, and enzymes to digest its soft parts. The larva is clad in forward-pointing bristles which help it to anchor itself and exert greater traction, enabling it to subdue prey considerably larger than itself. Antlion larvae are unusual among insects in lacking an anus. All the metabolic waste generated during the larval stage is stored; some is used to spin the silk for the cocoon and the rest is eventually voided as meconium at the end of its pupal stage. Distribution There are about 2,000 species of antlion found in most parts of the world, with the greatest diversity being in warmer areas. The best known species are those in which the larvae dig pits to trap their prey, but by no means do all species do this. Antlions live in a range of usually dry habitats including open woodland floors, scrub-clad dunes, hedge bases, river banks, road verges, under raised buildings and in vacant lots. Life-cycle The life-cycle of Distoleon tetragrammicus Apart from pit-trap-forming taxa, the biology of members of the family Myrmeleontidae, to which the antlions belong, has been little studied. The life-cycle begins with oviposition (egg-laying) in a suitable location. The female antlion repeatedly taps the prospective laying site with the tip of her abdomen and then inserts her ovipositor into the substrate and lays an egg. Depending on the species and where it lives, the larva either conceals itself under leaves, debris or pieces of wood, hides in a crack or digs a funnel-shaped pit in loose material. As ambush predators, catching prey is risky because food arrives unpredictably and, for those species that make traps, maintaining one is costly; the larvae therefore have low metabolic rates and can survive for long periods without food. They can take several years to complete their life-cycle; they mature faster with plentiful food, but can survive for many months without feeding. In cooler climates they dig their way deeper and remain inactive during the winter. An antlion cocoon on the side of a house. When the larva attains its maximum size, it pupates and undergoes metamorphosis. It makes a globular cocoon of sand or other local substrate stuck together with fine silk spun from a slender spinneret at the rear end of the body. The cocoon may be buried several centimetres deep in sand. After completing its transformation into an adult insect over the course of about one month, it emerges from the case, leaving the pupal integument behind, and works its way to the surface. After about twenty minutes, the adult's wings are fully opened and it flies off in search of a mate. The adult is considerably larger than the larva as antlions exhibit the greatest disparity in size between larva and adult of any type of holometabolous insect. This is by virtue of the fact that the exoskeleton of the adult is extremely thin and flimsy, with an exceptionally low density. The adult typically lives for about 25 days, but some insects survive for as long as 45 days. Ecology Sand pit trap of an antlion Antlion larvae eat small arthropods – mainly ants – while the adults of some species eat pollen and nectar, and others are predators of small arthropods. In certain species of Myrmeleontidae, such as Dendroleon pantherinus, the larva, although resembling that of Myrmeleon structurally, makes no pitfall trap, but hides in detritus in a hole in a tree and seizes passing prey. In Japan, Dendroleon jezoensis larvae lurk on the surface of rocks for several years while awaiting prey; during this time they often become coated with lichen, and have been recorded at densities of up to 344 per square metre. The larva is a voracious predator. Within a few minutes of seizing its prey with its jaws and injecting it with venom and enzymes, it begins to suck out the digestion products. The larva is extremely sensitive to ground vibrations, the low-frequency sounds made by an insect crawling across the ground; the larva locates the source of the vibrations by the differences in timing of the arrival of waves detected by receptors, tufts of hairs on the sides of the two hindmost thoracic segments. Antlion larva extracted from sand pit In trap-building species, an average- sized larva digs a pit about 2 in (5 cm) deep and 3 in (7.5 cm) wide at the edge. This behavior has also been observed in the Vermileonidae (Diptera), whose larvae dig the same sort of pit to feed on ants. Having marked out the chosen site by a circular groove, the antlion larva starts to crawl backwards, using its abdomen as a plough to shovel up the soil. By the aid of one front leg, it places consecutive heaps of loosened particles upon its head, then with a smart jerk throws each little pile clear of the scene of operations. Proceeding thus, it gradually works its way from the circumference towards the center. As it slowly moves round and round, the pit gradually gets deeper and deeper, until the slope angle reaches the critical angle of repose (that is, the steepest angle the sand can maintain, where it is on the verge of collapse from slight disturbance), and the pit is solely lined by fine grains. By digging in a spiral when constructing its pit, the antlion minimises the time needed to complete the pit. When the pit is completed, the larva settles down at the bottom, buried in the soil with only the jaws projecting above the surface, often in a wide-opened position on either side of the very tip of the cone. The steep-sloped trap that guides prey into the larva's mouth while avoiding crater avalanches is one of the simplest and most efficient traps in the animal kingdom. The fine grain lining ensures that the avalanches which carry prey are as large as possible. Since the sides of the pit consist of loose sand at its angle of repose, they afford an insecure foothold to any small insects that inadvertently venture over the edge, such as ants. Slipping to the bottom, the prey is immediately seized by the lurking antlion; if it attempts to scramble up the treacherous walls of the pit, it is speedily checked in its efforts and brought down by showers of loose sand which are thrown at it from below by the larva. By throwing up loose sand from the bottom of the pit, the larva also undermines the sides of the pit, causing them to collapse and bring the prey with them. Thus, it does not matter whether the larva actually strikes the prey with the sand showers. Antlion larvae are capable of capturing and killing a variety of insects and other arthropods, and can even subdue small spiders. The projections in the jaws of the larva are hollow and through this, the larva sucks the fluids out of its victim. After the contents are consumed, the dry carcass is flicked out of the pit. The larva readies the pit once again by throwing out collapsed material from the center, steepening the pit walls to the angle of repose. Sand pit trap with remains of an ant Antlion larvae require loose soil, not necessarily but often sand. Antlions can also handle larger granular material which is filtered out of the soil during pit construction. The larvae prefer dry places protected from the rain. When it first hatches, the tiny larva specialises in very small insects, but as it grows larger, it constructs larger pits, and thus catches larger prey, sometimes much larger than itself. Other arthropods may make use of the antlion larva's ability to trap prey. The larva of the Australian horsefly (Scaptia muscula) lives in antlion (for example Myrmeleon pictifrons) pit traps and feeds on the prey caught, and the female chalcid wasp (Lasiochalcidia igiliensis) purposefully allows itself to be trapped so that it can parasitise the antlion larva by ovipositing between its head and thorax. Evolution The closest living relatives of antlions within the Myrmeleontoidea are the owlflies (Ascalaphidae); the Nymphidae are more distantly related. The extinct Araripeneuridae and Babinskaiidae are considered likely to be stem groups in the Myrmeleontiformia clade. The phylogeny of the Neuroptera has been explored using mitochondrial DNA sequences, and while issues remain for the group as a whole (the \\"Hemerobiiformia\\" being paraphyletic), the Myrmeleontiformia is generally agreed to be monophyletic, giving the following cladogram: The subfamilies are shown below; a few genera, mostly fossil, are of uncertain or basal position. The fossil record of antlions is very small by neuropteran standards. However, some Mesozoic fossils attest to the antlions' origin more than 150 million years ago. These were at one time separated as the Palaeoleontidae, but are now usually recognized as early antlions. There is little consensus regarding the supra-generic classification within the Myrmeleontidae, but the following four subfamilies (with select genera) are accepted by many researchers: * Acanthaclisinae ** Centroclisis * Myrmeleontinae ** Bankisus Navás, 1912 ** Dendroleon ** Euroleon Esben-Petersen, 1918 *** Euroleon nostras (European antlion) ** Glenoleon Banks, 1913 *** Glenoleon falsus *** Glenoleon pulchellus Australia ** Hagenomyia *** Hagenomyia tristis Africa ** Menkeleon * Palparinae (including Araripeneurinae) ** Palpares * Stilbopteryginae ** Stilbopteryx The following subfamilies have been recognized by some taxonomists: * Brachynemurinae (otherwise in Myrmeleontinae) * Dendroleontinae (otherwise in Myrmeleontinae) * Dimarinae * Echthromyrmicinae * Glenurinae * Myrmecaelurinae (otherwise in Myrmeleontinae) * Nemoleontinae (otherwise in Myrmeleontinae) * Pseudimarinae Antlions of uncertain systematic position are: * Palaeoleon (fossil) * Porrerus * Samsonileon File:Antlion doodles.jpg|Antlion larva trails (doodles) in sand File:2015.10-434-146bp antlion(unidentified sp.,adult,L(wing tip-antnena tip)4.8cm) DD11.176086,-4.335053@Bobo-Dioulasso,BF thu29oct2015-1054h.jpg|Thorax and head (with club-shaped antenna) of antlion adult File:Antlion1 by Jonathan Numer.jpg|Larva File:Formicaleone.jpg|20x closeup of larva File:Antlion.ogv|Video of antlion larva trying to catch prey with sand traps and eating a small spider File:Antlion video.ogv|Video of a larva trapping an ant by throwing sand at it Myrmecoleon, from the Hortus Sanitatis of Jacob Meydenbach, 1491 In culture and folklore In popular folklore in the southern United States, people recite a poem or chant to make the antlion come out of its hole. Similar practices have been recorded from Africa, the Caribbean, China and Australia. The Myrmecoleon was a mythical ant-lion hybrid written about in the 2nd century AD Physiologus, where animal descriptions were paired with Christian morals. The ant-lion as described was said to starve to death because of its dual nature – the lion nature of the father could only eat meat, but the ant half from the mother could only eat grain chaff, thus the offspring could not eat either and would starve. It was paired with the Biblical verse Matthew 5:37. The fictional ant-lion of Physiologus is probably derived from a misreading of Job 4:11. The French naturalist Jean- Henri Fabre wrote that \\"The Ant-lion makes a slanting funnel in the sand. Its victim, the Ant, slides down the slant and is then stoned, from the bottom of the funnel, by the hunter, who turns his neck into a catapult.\\" Antlions appear as antagonists in the 1991 life simulation video game, SimAnt, the Final Fantasy series, Terraria, Monster Rancher 2, Mother 3, and (in a giant form) the Half-Life 2 video game series. The Trapinch, Vibrava, and Flygon Pokémon evolution line is based on an antlion. In Don’t Starve Together, an antlion is featured as a boss. The fictional sarlacc from the Star Wars franchise is often compared to the real-life antlion.Jeanne Cavelos, The Science of Star Wars: An Astrophysicist's Independent Examination of Space Travel, Aliens, Planets, and Robots as Portrayed in the Star Wars Films and Books(New York: St. Martin's Press, 1999), p. 71, . It also appears as a predator in the film Enemy Mine. In the third book of Tove Jansson's Moomins series, Finn Family Moomintroll, a rather large and fanciful antlion appears in the second chapter, depicted as a sand-dwelling predator with the literal head of a lion.

It is centred on a historic settlement, first documented in 570 CE (Mervyn Archdall). The district shares Dublin's two largest municipal parks, Saint Anne's Park and Bull Island with its 4.5 km beach, with neighbouring Clontarf, and is crossed by several small watercourses. Raheny is also a civil parish in the ancient barony of Coolock.Placenames Database of Ireland – Raheny civil parish The coastal hamlet grew rapidly in the 20th century and is now a mid-density Northside suburb with a village core. Location and access Raheny today, in the context of Dublin, by satelliteRaheny runs from the coast inland, with its centre about from Dublin city centre and from Dublin Airport. It is administered by Dublin City Council. The county boundary with Fingal lies close by, where Raheny meets Kilbarrack. Nearby areas include Killester, Clontarf, Artane, Kilbarrack, Coolock and Donaghmede, and the skyline is dominated by Howth Head. Raheny is bisected by the Howth Road (R105) and the R809 (from Bull Island via in turn Watermill Road, Main Street, Station Road) and is also accessed from the Malahide Road (R107), the coastal James Larkin Road (R807) and the R104 (including the Oscar Traynor Road and Kilbarrack Road). Raheny railway station, opened on 25 May 1844, overlooking the village centre, serves the DART suburban railway system and the Dublin-Belfast main line, and parts of Raheny are served by other DART stations, Harmonstown and Kilbarrack, on the same line. Raheny is also served by Dublin Bus (routes 29a, 31, 31a and 31b, and 32, and at night, 29n and 31n) and has a taxi rank. Much of the district is situated on gently rising ground, with a bluff overlooking Bull Island at Maywood and Bettyglen, and further rises from the village centre to the station and then to Belmont or Mount Olive, a hill which once featured a windmill. Opposite and beyond Belmont was once an area of sunken land with limestone quarries but this was landfilled, much of it with urban refuse, and then partly levelled and converted into a city park, Edenmore Park, in the late 1960s. Raheny and neighbouring districts, early 20th century Historical features Ráth (ringfort) At the heart of Raheny lie the remains of a large ancient ringfort (or ráth) from which the area gets its name. The ráth extends under the centre of the modern village, from beside the Santry River, including some marshy ground, to the Roman Catholic church, Windsor Motors, the Scout Den and the two St. Assam's Churches. Some excavations were carried out in the 1970s, giving an idea of its size (probably c. 110m across) and structure. The old church and graveyard complex behind the village plaza may reflect a remnant of the rath, as does some embankment behind the Scout Den. During the 19th century, significant changes to the village, especially the centre, occurred, as a result of work on the Howth Road by the Telford Engineering Company; prior to this, the road entered the village at the bottom of the central hill, turning sharply coastwards at the top of Main Street. Works to straighten the road resulted in a reduction of the old ringfort. Religious sites The ruined St. Assam's Church, dating from a 1712 reconstruction of a 1609 building, is believed to be the successor to early religious settlement. The later St. Assam's Church, opposite it, was built from 1859, in the period when Roman Catholics regained the right to have their own churches, and opened in 1864. Raheny was also the site of two holy wells. The first of these, St. Ann's Well, gave its name to St. Anne's Park. The site of this well is still visible under a stone cupola by the boating lake in the park, but it has been dry for several decades, despite efforts by municipal authorities to restart it. The second well, dedicated to the patron saint of the area, St. Assam, lay in the field which now holds the Church of Our Lady Mother of Divine Grace. When last recorded, it was marked by a depression in the ground but was later, in the 20th century, covered over, and its waters diverted into the Santry River. The \\"Celtic-style\\" cross on display in the village (now on the main plaza but previously placed in other locations, including at the junctions of Main Street and Watermill Lane, and of Watermill Land and Howth Road) is a memorial to Marie Elizabeth Hayes, an early female medical graduate and 19th-century medical missionary from the area to India, paid for by locals in the area in which the doctor worked. Raheny Heritage Trail and guides In 1992, the Raheny Heritage Society published a walking guide, the Raheny Heritage Trail, which included a general introduction to the area and its history, and a map, and this was reprinted, with only minor changes, in 2000. Large panels describing highlights of the area's historical and natural sights in English and Irish, and with maps of the central village area, stand either side of the central crossroads. In 2006 the Raheny Business Association placed blue informational plaques, with wording co-ordinated with the Raheny Heritage Society, on or near 15 historical buildings. Raheny-on-the-Strand There was, at least by the 18th century, a hamlet, a \\"second Raheny\\", Lower Raheny or Raheny-on-the-Strand, in the area of Black Bush and by the coastal point known as the \\"Whip of the Water\\" - where the Howth Road on its then route, and Fox Stream, met the sea. There was a beach road here, later washed away, then succeeded by the tram line to Howth. The current coastal road, the James Larkin Road, is a much more recent construction. Mills and quay In the 18th century, Raheny had a water mill near the mouth of the Santry River, in ruins by 1757; this gave the name to the lane from the village down to the coastal road, now Watermill Road. There were also two windmills, a rare item on the map of the Dublin area. One of the latter, mapped as \\"Old Windmill\\", was situated on the Howth Road, on the slope above the Naniken River, and the other, \\"The Mill of Raheny\\", on Belmont hill, where the Capuchin friary now stands. There was also a stone wharf where the lane from the village came down to join the coastal road. Crescent Cottages Crescent Cottages, Raheny Eight cottages in a crescent formation on Station Road near the junction with the Howth Road are among the oldest buildings in the village, having been built around 1790 by local resident Samuel Dick, then Governor of the Bank of Ireland. The cottages served as residences for men who worked on Mr. Dick's estate. The cottages are informally known as the \\"Doh-Ray-Mee\\" cottages due to their resemblance to piano keys. The cottage nearest to the Manhattan pub was once the village post office. The cottages were willed to a trust to support what is now Springdale School, and aside from one sold, with court permission, to fund capital developments, the rent from the cottages contributes to the running of the school. Name Several explanations exist for the origin of the name Raheny: one (from Ráth Éanna) is that it means the ringfort of Éanna, an early local chief, another (Ráth Eanaigh) is that the name derives from eanach, an old Irish word for marsh or swamp, or for a passage through a swampy area. Yet another (deriving from Rath Ain Abha) comes from \\"Noble Fortress of the Sea\\".Dublin, Cahill, 1922: Authentic Derivations of Place- Names in County Dublin Traced and Explained With the Aid of Real Evidence, MacNamara, M. A. It is a matter unlikely ever to be fully resolved, as the origins of names, especially in areas within the Pale, were lost. Locally, most use Ráth Éanna while officialdom now tends towards Ráth Eanaigh. Until the mid-20th century, many local residents pronounced the English language name as something more like Rahenny or Rathenny, as it was mapped in the 18th century, or Ratheny. Although there are a range of similar names (such as Rahanna), the name Raheny is nearly unique in Ireland, occurring in just one other locality, a portion of the rural town of Lusk. This once-significant monastic and civil centre in north County Dublin is not very remote but no connection between the two locales is known. Natural features In addition to the Santry River (historically Skillings Glas), Raheny is also crossed by the Naniken River (previously parts of it named Ballyhoy after a townland through which it passes), the Fox Stream and the Blackbanks Stream, all monitored by Dublin City Council. The Santry and the Naniken are shown on many old maps, and one or other of the other two sometimes also appear. The Santry comes from Harristown and Dubber, north of Ballymun, and passes through eastern Santry, and Coolock, then between Harmonstown and Edenmore, to reach central Raheny and then flow on to the sea; it is in the open for most of its course. The Naniken, now culverted for more than half its length, flows from central Santry through Artane, then passes under the railway line in a syphon. Its line marked by a disused lane from Ennafort to the Howth Road, it passes under Ballyhoy Bridge (now hidden under the tarmac of the main road) and comes out of culvert at the edge of St Anne's Park, and forms a feature through the park. From partway through the park, its course marks the boundary between Raheny and Clontarf. Both the Fox and Blackbanks Streams flow from the limestone area above Station Road (which used to hold caves and quarries), one either side of the steep Belmont or Mount Olive hill on Station Road; both flow underground. The Fox Stream runs through Walmer lands, under Tuscany Downs, but is today smaller than historically, as some of its flow is diverted by pipe before the railway, into the already larger Blackbanks Stream. According to a chronicle of the ceremony of \\"Riding the Franchises\\", the Fox Stream used to mark the northern boundary of Dublin City. A major feature is the nearly beach known as Dollymount Strand, on the nature reserve of North Bull Island, shared with Clontarf. Parklands include the two largest Dublin municipal parks, North Bull Island itself and Saint Anne's Park (formerly the home of the Guinness family of brewing and later banking fame), which is also shared with Clontarf, as well as Edenmore Park (10.25 hectares, with a pitch and putt course, playground and exercise area, and playing fields), Springdale Road Park (along the Santry River) and many small green areas. There is excellent walking and cycling on the sea front (one can walk or bike from Howth to Dún Laoghaire, with problems only in the Docklands area), and good walking on North Bull Island and in St. Anne's Park. Raheny Tidy Village Group, with the support of Dublin City Council, launched a set of three measured walking routes for the Raheny area, the Raheny Way, with a guiding noticeboard at Raheny Station, and a leaflet available at various locations around the area. Community organisations and media The village plaza near Raheny's centre, by Dublin City Council and the RBA A range of residents' associations have been established over time but many have faded as housing areas have matured. One of those still functioning, the St Anne's Residents' Association (SARA), with some allied bodies, operates a community hall, CARA Hall, on All Saints' Drive, while the Grange Woodbine Association has hall facilities on Station Road. One umbrella body, the Raheny Community Council operated for a time in the 1970s, while another, the Federation of Raheny Residents (FoRR), was active from 1981 to 2011. The Federation organised a range of activities, some in conjunction with the Raheny Business Association and some with the local authority and other official bodies, including strategic plans for the village, Neighbourhood Watch arrangements, community awareness weeks, the charitable Mayor of Raheny campaigns, events for older people, the setting up of the Millennium Clock in the middle of the village, and the moving of the Marie Elizabeth Hayes Cross. Many other voluntary groups operate in the area, some secular, such as the Raheny Heritage Society, Raheny Toastmasters, Raheny St. John Ambulance Division Raheny Order of Malta unit and Raheny Community First Responders and some church-related, such as the local conference of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Mothers' Union. A special form of community organisation was the Maywood Avondale Bettyglen TV Association (MABTVA), which provided a local TV cable service for parts of Raheny (most of Dublin being served by one of two large TV cable companies), using its own receiving station, situated at the back of the old Bettyglen Estate. The Raheny News, a local voluntary production founded in 1975, is a four-page newsletter, printed on green paper, and aimed at keeping residents of Raheny informed of current happenings, is produced weekly throughout most of the year by a group of local people, with some support from the Roman Catholic parish. It was founded by the late Fr Cornelius O'Keefe along with a few local volunteers, including Madeleine Meyler and Lily Leslie. It was a partial successor to The Acorn, a bi-monthly magazine sponsored by the joint Killester-Raheny parish, and then by Raheny parish alone, and to The Relay, the magazine of Raheny Community Council. Roman Catholic and Church of Ireland parishes also produce bulletins. Another local paper, The Raheny Informer, was published monthly in the 2000s. From time to time, postcards of the area are published. Raheny is part of the service area of community radio station NEAR FM. Business community Many of the local business interests, and some civic entities, are members of the Raheny Business Association (RBA), a form of chamber of commerce. Environment and Tidy Towns For many years Raheny has had a voluntary Tidy Village Group, which drives activities for the Tidy Towns competition, and has helped the area win a number of civic awards. In 2006, the Raheny Business Association began to sponsor a part-time paid coordinator to help the group in its work. Consistently scoring well in the Tidy Towns competition, Raheny received a Highly Commended rating in 2008, and the detailed report noted potential, with some further organisation, to win the competition outright. The following year, 2009, Raheny won the Best Urban Village award and was one of four areas of Dublin City to receive a commendation in the overall Tidy Towns competition. In 2014 Raheny again won the Best Urban Village award in the Tidy Towns competition. Raheny has won the bronze medal in its category in the National Tidy Towns Competition in 2015, 2016 and 2017 Amenities and business A feature of Raheny is Dublin's second busiest municipal library branch, opened in 1972 and at one time the busiest in Ireland. Located near the village centre it has a reading garden and recycling centre. Adjacent to the library is the site of the first Catholic School in the village, built by William Sweetman circa 1820, now a solicitor's office. The district also holds St. Francis Hospice and St. Joseph's Hospital (administered by Beaumont Hospital Board), as well as a small local health centre, a Credit Union branch (the local credit union merged with those of Artane and Coolock), a Garda Síochána station, located opposite the national school complex on All Saints' Drive, and one of Dublin's three driving test centres, at the St. Anne's shopping plaza. Local amenities include many shops and several small shopping areas. There are several financial institutions, a fitness club and multiple doctors, dentists and specific and alternative health providers. The area's swimming pool, separate from but adjacent to St. Paul's College, closed to the public in 2006 after about 30 years of private operation, and was later replaced by an apartment block development. The main local shopping facility is located in the centre of the village, on the Howth Road beside the Santry River. The anchor unit is a SuperValu store. Also part of the shopping centre complex are an AIB Bank, Ulster Bank, cafe/restaurant, and several other retail and service units. Across the Howth Road from the shopping centre proper are several other retail units and service outlets. Dublin bus routes 31 and 32 serve the shopping centre's 'Raheny Village' stop. Parts of the areas are also served by the Tesco-anchored Kilbarrack Shopping Centre and another in coastal Kilbarrack and Edenmore Shopping Centre, and the nearest large supermarkets are in Donaghmede and at Clare Hall. There are two service stations, one at each end of the area, and there are three motor dealers, two of which also handle repairs and one further vehicle repair location. Hospitality Until the 2000s, Raheny had one of just a few hotels in Dublin's northern suburbs; this shortage was reduced by the building of a range of hotels near Dublin Airport, . The Shieling Hotel, or Old Shieling, in the former Fox Hall, a part of the small Regency Hotel group, ceased operation in early 2008, after planning permission had been granted, after an appeal, to redevelop the main house, a protected historic structure, as flats, with additional apartment blocks adjacent. The district features a range of bed-and-breakfast establishments. There are several pubs, the best known including the Cedar Lounge, the Manhattan, the (Raheny) Inn and the Watermill, and eating places include the Watermill and three restaurants, one of the three old schoolhouses in the village centre, at the top of Main Street, one on Watermill Road, in the former Raheny Hardware building, and one in St Assam's, as well as a coffee shop with dinner service, under the main shopping centre. Religious institutions Raheny has four church buildings in the village core, active Roman Catholic and Church of Ireland (Anglican) churches, one closed Catholic church, and one ruin. The Catholic church overlooks the centre of the village (with feature belfry and baptistry), while the Church of Ireland building is sited on the approach to the village centre from the city. The central Roman Catholic church building is the Church of Our Lady Mother of Divine Grace, of the Catholic Parish of Raheny. The building, completed in 1962, was designed by Peppard and Duffy architects, at the behest of Monsignor William Fitzpatrick and Archbishop John Charles McQuaid, with a capacity of 1500 to accommodate a burgeoning local congregation. The church opened Sunday, July 22, 1962. The main entrance is framed within a large triangle inset with numerous smaller triangles, recalling traditional motifs from Romanesque Irish churches. The facade and the bell-tower are built with green limestone. Our Lady's substantially smaller predecessor, St. Assam's Church, built between 1859 and 1864, is directly opposite. Regular worship ceased there when Our Lady's opened, and it was lightly used for the succeeding three decades, hosting St Joseph's Youth Club (Bru Sheosamh), Taize prayer services, and some meetings and occasional Masses. The building is a Protected Structure. It was later sold, and a conversion to office space was planned. The district is also served by the pyramid-style church of Kilbarrack-Foxfield Parish, by St. Benedict's, of Grange Park Parish, and by St. Brigid's, of Killester Parish, and by the chapel at the Capuchin Friary. A number of other Roman Catholic religious orders also have local presences. Prior to the restoration of local worship, Rahenyites had for centuries to attend Mass in Coolock or, later, Clontarf, or in local houses. The Church of Ireland church, for the Anglican Parish of Raheny (now in Union with the Parish of Coolock), All Saints Church, was built at the expense of Arthur Guinness, 1st Baron Ardilaun of the Guinness family. Before this church was built, Raheny Parish was served by the older church in the centre of Raheny, an earlier St. Assam's Church, dating back to 1712, and previously to 1609 and before. All Saints' has a Rectory in the grounds, as well as a community hall and a preserved gate lodge for the verger. In April 2010, it was announced that the church required extensive roof repairs and funds were raised to complete this. There was for some time also a large Plymouth Brethren meeting hall in \\"new\\" Bettyglen. Methodist worshippers have churches in Clontarf and Sutton, and Presbyterian churches are in Clontarf and Howth. Education The district has a boys' secondary school, St. Paul's College, Raheny (attended by approximately 600 pupils in 2006) and one of Ireland's largest girls' secondary schools, Manor House, as well as Ardscoil La Salle, on Raheny Road, a smaller mixed second level facility. There is a primary school complex just behind the village centre, with a mixed junior school, Scoil Ide, and distinct boys' and girls' senior schools, Scoil Assaim and Scoil Aine respectively, as well as a shared assembly hall, used for many community events. There is also a mixed primary school, Springdale National School, on Springdale Road, overseen by a Board of Governors, with an endowment which includes rent from seven of the area's historic cottages at the Crescent. There is a special national school operated by St. Michael's House on Raheny Road, and another general primary school in the Grange Park locality. The locality of Edenmore has its own school facilities, with a junior girls' school (St Monica's), and separate senior primary schools for boys (St Malachy's) and girls (St Eithne's). Sport GAA Raheny GAA, founded in the late 1950s, has a large clubhouse on All Saints Drive. St Vincents GAA was based north of the village centre, but has since moved to Marino Athletics Raheny Shamrock Athletic Club operates from a converted old schoolhouse behind the Scout Den on the slopes of the old fortification which gives its name to Raheny. The Shamrocks manage the annual AXA Raheny Five Mile Road Race, and 30 other events. The club became the largest athletics club in Dublin and have provided four Olympians. There is also a regular \\"parkrun\\" in St Anne's Park. Soccer (association football) Raheny United F.C. was formed from the union of two local clubs, Raheny Boys F.C. and Dunseedy United F.C. The senior men's team plays in Athletic Union League, while the senior women's team were founder members of the Women's National League and have also played in the Dublin Women's Soccer League Grange Woodbine F.C. was founded in 1973 and its teams play their home matches at Edenmore Park and Woodbine Road Belgrove F.C. play their home matches at St. Paul's College, Raheny. Golf and related sports St. Anne's Golf Club, founded by a small group of locals in 1921, is based at the Raheny end of Bull Island, while the Royal Dublin Golf Club is also on Bull Island, primarily in Clontarf but partly, and with its service entrance, in Raheny. There is also a public par-3 golf course in St Anne's Park, and municipal Pitch and Putt facility within Edenmore Park, on Station Road. Racquet sports St Anne's Park Tennis Club plays at the public tennis courts at St Anne's Park. There are also two badminton clubs, Raheny Badminton Club and Raheny Smashers, both playing at the badminton facility in Baldoyle. Youth groups CGI Guide Promise Badge The 73rd Raheny Scout Group, a unit of Scouting Ireland, meet at their den on the banks of the Santry River, opposite the Church of Our Lady Mother of Divine Grace on the Howth Road. Raheny Guides, also known as Buion An Leanbh Prague of the Catholic Guides of Ireland, have been in existence since 1966, meeting on a Wednesday evening. The Cygnets (age 5–7) meet in the CARA Hall and the Brigins (age 6–10), Guides (age 10–16) and Rangers (age 14–19) meet in Scoil Aine (Raheny N.S.) Hall. There are also Girls' and Boys' Brigade companies meeting at the Church of Ireland halls. Previously the area had a youth club for the eastern end of the village, M.A.F.R.A., and later St Joseph's Youth Club, based at the new St Assam's Church, and supported by the Roman Catholic parish. Politics In Dáil Éireann, Raheny is part of the five-seat Dublin Bay North constituency. Until the 2016 general election it was split between the constituencies of Dublin North-Central and Dublin North-East. The splitting of the district, which also gives electoral stations either side of the village centre (generally at the library and at the National Schools complex), was a source of local anger for many years. Long-serving politicians for the area include Seán Kenny (politician), a Dublin City Councillor from 1979 until 2011 when he was elected for the second time in Dáil Éireann (the first occasion having been in the 1990s) and former minister Michael Woods, who lives in neighbouring Kilbarrack. Past figures include the late ex-Taoiseach Charles Haughey, and Councillor Niamh Cosgrave, of Foxfield, the latter in a rare move having been removed from the City Council for non-attendance. Localities and housing The civil parish of Raheny comprises at least the townlands of Ballyhoy, Bettyville, Charleville, Edenmore, Foxlands, Glebe, Maryville, Mountolive (or Mount of Olives), North Bull Island, Raheny North, Raheny South and (the) Snug. Some historic records also note the village centre as a distinct entity, \\"Raheny Town\\". Foxlands now contains Avondale, Maywood and Bettyglen, while Mountolive (and parts of Swan's Nest) now include several roads and estates, notably \\"Tuscany Downs\\" whose naming caused ministerial comment and public discussion about inappropriate naming conventions. The modern civic district is sometime seen as extending beyond these areas, and at one time Raheny was used as the address for much of what is now Donaghmede, for example. The civil parish is still maintained in law, and its boundaries were last reviewed during 1985, with their extension to a greater part of Dublin Bay; it includes half, or slightly more, of Bull Island. The first major housing development in Raheny was St Anne's, built for Dublin Corporation on parts of the former Guinness estate not retained as a public park, which was followed by Cill Éanna and Ennafort, then Avondale, Rathmore Park, St Assam's and Foxfield, and Maywood were developed by the building firm of Curtis & Farrelly in the early to mid-1960s., Grange Park, Millwood and Grange-Woodbine, and \\"Old\\" Bettyglen followed, and later Ashcroft on the former St Vincent's grounds, \\"New Bettyglen\\" in the 1980s, Belmont and Tuscany Downs. There are a number of housing units for older people, notably in St. Anne's and at Avondale, and three retirement / nursing homes, one formerly dedicated for retired members of the Garda Siochana and their families, one run by the Little Sisters of the Poor at Sybil Hill, and one HSE facility. The Sorohan Brothers built a range of houses from 1966. Starting in the mid-2000s, Raheny, most of which was laid out with semi-detached and terraced houses with good gardens front and rear, has seen a surge in infill development, especially on corner sites, and the arrival of a small but growing number of apartment developments (the area previously had almost no apartment buildings). Localities All of one and part of another of Raheny's townlands were largely developed by Dublin Corporation to form a new neighbourhood, Edenmore, in one of its largest ever housing projects. Although still part of the overall district, and shown in addresses as Edenmore, Raheny, the new area, with its own schools, small shopping centre (including one of Dublin's highest-turnover pubs), church (Roman Catholic: St. Monica's), health centre and some sports teams, has a distinct identity. There is also a nursing home, St Gabriel's. The locality of Harmonstown, straddling the boundary between Raheny and Artane, lies just over the railway line from the Ennafort housing development in Raheny, and across the Santry River from Edenmore.

History Mondo 2000 originated as High Frontiers in 1984, edited by R. U. Sirius (pseudonym for Ken Goffman) with co-editor and publisher Morgan Russell. R. U. Sirius was succeeded as Editor-in-Chief by Alison Bailey Kennedy, a.k.a. \\"Queen Mu\\" and \\"Alison Wonderland\\".Kennedy is also known for her theories concerning the use of bufotenin by the ancient Olmec of Mesoamerica. See . Sirius was joined by hacker Jude Milhon (a.k.a. St. Jude) as editor and the magazine was renamed Reality Hackers in 1988 to better reflect its drugs and computers theme. It changed title again to Mondo 2000 in 1989. Art director and photographer Bart Nagel, a pioneer in Photoshop collage, created the publication's elegantly surrealist aesthetic. R. U. Sirius left at the beginning of 1993, at about the same time as the launch of Wired. The magazine continued until 1998, with the last issue being #17.

The parish includes the hamlet of Brunthwaite.  History  Silsden was mentioned in the 1086 Domesday Book as \\"Siglesdene\\", and as the most important village in Craven. Generally an agricultural area, the Industrial Revolution had a significant impact on West Yorkshire, including Silsden. The town hosted a number of mills none of which now operate in their original form. There is still industry in the town, some in old mill buildings and some in a new industrial estate between the town and the river. The town retains a very small amount of manufacturing. The Leeds and Liverpool Canal became a key element of local infrastructure upon its completion in 1816. Silsden was then connected to both a significant manufacturing city (Leeds) and a major ocean port (Liverpool) by canal. Canal boats allowed for cheap transportation of bulk goods, especially coal and wool, to the area. St. James' Church, Kirkgate In 1911, there was a riot in Silsden when the police station was attacked.Daily Mirror 10 April 1911 \\"Mob attack police station\\" A very unpopular policeman had been too enthusiastic in his duties. Questions were raised in the House of Commons and it was reported in the national press. The policeman was removed from the town and no more trouble occurred. During the 1940s, a hostel was built off Howden Road, to house refugees and prisoners of war from various countries. The area is now a housing estate, and there is a plaque to commemorate the hostel on Ings Way. In 1998, a hoard of 27 gold coins dating back to the 1st century AD were found in the town and subsequently valued at £20,000 by experts appointed by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport.The Silsden Hoard Waterloo Mills The Guinness Book of World Records reported that the biggest onion ever, at , was grown in Silsden in 2010 by Vincent Throup. However this has since been beaten. On 6 July 2014, Stage 2 of the 2014 Tour de France from York to Sheffield, passed through the town.  Brunthwaite  The hamlet of Brunthwaite lies about half a mile (900m) east of the centre of Silsden, near Brunthwaite Beck and at the foot of Rombalds Moor. Land here formed a small manor from Saxon times, and the first known written mention of the name (as Bronthweyt) occurs in the 14th century. The oldest buildings in the present settlement are from an 18th-century farming community. The hamlet was designated as a conservation area in 1977, which was reassessed by Bradford Council in 2005. Governance The town is part of the Craven ward of the Metropolitan borough of the City of Bradford, part of the Metropolitan county of West Yorkshire.  Community  Silsden Fire Station Silsden has been administered by the City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council since 1974. It also has its own town council. Silsden has eight public houses: the Robin Hood, the Counting House, the Red Lion, the Duck Pond, the Post Office, the Butchers Arms, the Punch Bowl, and the King's Arms. There are two members' clubs: Sunnybank Social Club and Twisters Social Club. Whilst Silsden does not have its own railway station, the Steeton and Silsden railway station is south in the village of Steeton. The station provides a link for commuters to the cities of Leeds and Bradford. Sunnybank Social Club Lying between Keighley and Ilkley, Silsden is served by buses to both these towns. Silsden's public transport benefits from Silsden being part of West Yorkshire rather than North Yorkshire, the border of which runs along one end of the town.  Notable people  The Lampkin family lived at Silsden during the Second World War. Lampkin brothers Arthur, Alan and Martin were, later, national motorcycle trials champions. Martin Lampkin won the 1975 FIM Trial World Championship and his son, Douglas \\"Dougie\\" Lampkin, is a twelve-time trials world champion. The Wainman family, a second motorsport dynasty from Silsden, compete in BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars. Frankie Wainman was World Champion in 1979, while his son Frankie Wainman Junior is one of the most successful drivers in the history of the sport. English rugby league player Jack Reed, who played for the Brisbane Broncos, was born in Silsden. Henry Price started his first Fifty Shilling Tailors shop in Silsden.Competition Commission Report: United Drapers Stores With this fortune, the now Sir Henry Price, bought Wakehurst Place, Ardingly, West Sussex, which is now owned by the National Trust. Margaret Wintringham, née Longbottom, was a British Liberal Party politician. She was the second woman take her seat in the House of Commons and lived in Silsden when her father was the head teacher at Bolton Road School.  Television  On 27 April 1995, a one-off anthology supernatural drama titled Chiller aired, in which episode 6, titled \\"number 6\\", featured Silsden. It was featured for almost the entire one-hour episode, using locations across the town. Bonapartes Restaurant, on Kirkgate, was the subject of the first-ever episode of Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares in 2004. After the show aired, Bonapartes’ owner Sue Ray threatened to take legal action against Ramsay, Channel 4 and the programme makers, Optomen, after claiming that the show put her £400,000 in debt. Christine Hall, producer of Kitchen Nightmares, refused to accept the blame, stating Ray only had herself to blame.\\"Ramsay's nightmare put me out of business\\" - TimesOnline The programme revisited the restaurant in the second series, but Ray would only talk to Ramsay off-camera. In June 2006, Ramsay won a High Court case against the London Evening Standard, which had alleged, after reports from Ray, that scenes and the general condition of Bonapartes had been faked. Ramsay was awarded £75,000 plus costs. Ramsay said at the time: \\"I won't let people write anything they want to about me. We have never done anything in a cynical, fake way.\\" In July 2007, the butchers, barbers and shoe shop located on Bradley Road were used in an episode of ITV's The Royal.

Early life Carson was born in (or near) Cobb County, Georgia. His father worked as a section foreman for the Western and Atlantic Railroad Company. In his teens, Carson learned to play the fiddle, using an old Stradivari-copy violin brought from Ireland in the early 18th century.Malone, McCulloh 1975, p. 17.Miller 1996, p. 73. In his teens, he worked as a racehorse jockey. In 1894, Carson married, and a couple of years later, in 1900, he began working for the Exposition Cotton Mills in Atlanta, followed by work in other cotton mills of the Atlanta area for the next twenty years, eventually being promoted to be a foreman.Wolfe 2001, p. 65. In 1911, Carson's family moved to Cabbagetown, Georgia, and he and his children began working for the Fulton Bag and Cotton Mill.Goodson 2007, p. 174. Three Fink, Gary M. 1993 The Fulton Bag and Cotton Mills Strike of 1914–1915: Espionage, Labor Conflict, and New South Industrial Relations. Cornell University Press. years later, in 1914, the workers of the cotton mill went on strike for their right to form a union, and Carson had nothing else to do but to perform for a living in the streets of North Atlanta. In these days, he wrote many songs, and he used to print copies and sell them in the streets for a nickel or a dime. Some of the songs he wrote dealt with real-life drama like the murder ballad \\"Mary Phagan\\". Because the governor of Georgia, John Marshall Slaton, commuted the death sentence of the condemned murderer of Mary Phagan to a life sentence, Carson, in outrage, wrote another version of \\"Mary Phagan\\" where he accused the governor of being paid a million dollars from a New York bank to change the verdict, causing him to be thrown in jail for slander.Wolfe 2001, p. 66. The convicted killer, Leo Frank, was lynched. (It is now widely believed that the real killer was actually Jim Conley.) On April 1, 1913, Carson performed at the first annual \\"Georgia Old-Time Fiddlers' Convention\\", held at the Municipal Auditorium in Atlanta,Russell 2007, p. 5.Daniel 2001, p. 18–19. where he came in fourth.Daniel 2001, p. 22. But between 1914 and 1922, he was proclaimed \\"Champion Fiddler of Georgia\\" seven times. The governor of Tennessee, Robert L. Taylor, dubbed him \\"Fiddlin' John\\". In 1919, Carson began touring, mostly the areas north of Atlanta, with his newly formed band the Cronies. He became associated with many politicians of Georgia, like Tom Watson, Herman Talmadge, and Eugene Talmadge, relations that gave rise to new songs like \\"Tom Watson Special\\". Carson and his daughter Rosa Lee began a series of performances for different political campaigns: for the Tom Watson U.S. Senate Campaign in 1920, for all of the Gene Talmadge campaigns, and for the Herman Talmadge for governor campaign. On September 9, 1922, Carson made his radio debut at the Atlanta Journal's radio station WSB in Atlanta, It was reported by the Atlanta Journal that Carson's fame quickly spread all over the United States following his broadcast at WSB.Miller 1996, p. 71. Career and aftermath In early June 1923, Polk C. Brockman, an Atlanta furniture store owner, who had been instrumental in the distribution of records for Okeh Records, went to New York City to work out a new business deal with Okeh Records.Wolfe 2001, p. 64.Malone, McCulloh 1975, p. 18. Later, in New York, he was asked if he knew of any artist in Atlanta that could justify a recording trip to Georgia. Brockman promised to return with an answer. A few days later, he was watching a movie followed by a silent newsreel at the Palace Theater in Times Square. The newsreel contained footage of Fiddlin' John Carson from an old time fiddler's contest in Virginia. Brockman wrote in his notebook: \\"Record Fiddlin' John Carson\\". At his next meeting with Okeh Records Board, he persuaded Ralph Peer to go ahead and record Carson.Miller 1996, p. 72. On June 19, 1923,Mazor, Ralph Peer, 2014, p. 53 Carson made his recording debut in an empty building on Nassau Street in Atlanta, cutting two sides, \\"The Little Old Log Cabin in the Lane\\" and \\"The Old Hen Cackled and the Rooster's Going To Crow.\\" Brockman told researchers in the 1960s that Peer had disliked the singing style of Carson and described it \\"pluperfect awful\\", but Peer was persuaded by Brockman to press five hundred for him to distribute.Wolfe 2001, p. 67. (Peer's biographer, Barry Mazor, argues that Peer's dissatisfaction concerned the technical quality of the recording, rather than the music, and that Peer was keen to make more recordings of Carson in New York.)Mazor, Ralph Peer, 2014, pp. 54–55 The recording was immediately sold out from the stage of the next Fiddler's convention on July 13, 1923. Peer, realizing Carson's potential, immediately invited Carson to New York City for another recording session. His recordings of \\"You Will Never Miss Your Mother Until She Is Gone\\" and \\"Old Joe Clark\\" both sold over one million copies, and each was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. Fiddlin' John Carson ceased recording temporarily in 1931 but resumed in 1934, now for the Victor label. Between 1923 and 1931, Carson recorded almost 150 songs, mostly together with the \\"Virginia Reelers\\" or his daughter Rosa Lee Carson, who performed with him as \\"Moonshine Kate\\".Malone, McCulloh 1975, p. 19. He wrote more than 150 songs in his life, but only nine were ever copyrighted. Because Carson couldn't read sheet music, he had his songs transferred to standard notation by the stepdaughter of preacher Andrew Jenkins, Irene Spain.Peterson 1997, p. 23. Carson was involved in several copyright issues with both Okeh Records and other musicians during his active career. In his later years, he worked for the local government as an elevator operator in Atlanta, a job he had obtained through his friendship with governor Herman Talmadge.Russell 2007, p. 7. He died in 1949 in Atlanta, Georgia, holding his fiddle in his arms, and is buried in Sylvester Cemetery in the East Atlanta neighborhood of Atlanta, where surviving friends and family play music at his grave each year around the anniversary of his birth. Views on race and evolution Carson made a pun relating to the KKK in \\"There Ain't no bugs on me (\\"The night was dark and driz'ly an' the air was full of sleet, m' ol' man join'd the Klu Klux an' ma she lost 'er sheet\\"), and was a regular at Ku Klux Klan rallies. His \\"Ballad of Little Mary Phagan\\" helped to exacerbate the anti-semitism that was a major factor in the lynching of Mary's alleged murderer, Leo Frank.

It was also later ported to the Motorola 6809; that version was called Flex9.FAQs, FLEX User Group All versions were text-based and intended for use on display devices ranging from printing terminals like the Teletype Model 33 ASR to smart terminals. While no graphic displays were supported by TSC software, some hardware manufacturers supported elementary graphics and pointing devices. It was a disk-based operating system, using 256-byte sectors on soft-sectored floppies; the disk structure used linkage bytes in each sector to indicate the next sector in a file or free list. The directory structure was much simplified as a result. TSC (and others) provided several programming languages including BASIC in two flavors (standard and extended) and a tokenizing version of extended BASIC called Pre-compiled BASIC, FORTH, C, FORTRAN, and PASCAL. TSC also wrote a version of FLEX, Smoke Signal DOS, for the California hardware manufacturer Smoke Signal Broadcasting; this version used forward and back linkage bytes in each sector which increased disk reliability at the expense of compatibility and speed. Later, TSC introduced the multitasking, multi-user, Unix-like UniFLEX operating system, which required DMA disk controllers, 8\\" disk, and so sold in only small numbers. Several of the TSC computer languages were ported to UniFLEX. During the early 1980s, FLEX was offered by Compusense Ltd as an operating system for the 6809-based Dragon 64 home computer.

It is the main access route from Dublin (via the M4/N4) to most of County Mayo, including the county's largest towns, Castlebar, Ballina (via the N26), and Westport. Almost all of the route has been improved during the 2000s with the construction of bypasses and extensive resurfacing works on stretches not bypassed. From Longford, the N5 passes through Strokestown and close to Ballaghaderreen, before crossing the N17 at an interchange near Ireland West Airport Knock. The N26 to Ballina leaves the N5 just outside Swinford. The road is long. Standard of route The N5 is a two-lane, single carriageway route throughout its entire length. The road has wide driving lanes and hard shoulders for between Castlebar and just west of Frenchpark, and between Strokestown and Longford for . The remainder of the route – between Frenchpark and Strokestown and between Westport and Castlebar – consists of a narrow road with no hard shoulders, and with a poor horizontal and vertical alignment allowing few overtaking opportunities. Almost all of the route has a modern asphalt surface laid after the year 2000. This is largely in good condition, except for a stretch of several kilometres just west of Tulsk, where the road pavement has degraded significantly. Campaign to upgrade route The standard of the N5 road is a significant political issue in Mayo. Local politicians have argued that because the N5 is the main access route to the county, it should be upgraded to a consistent standard - a single carriageway road with hard shoulders, bypassing all towns along the route. Political arguments were given more weight in recent years when several major multinational firms based in Mayo joined forces to lobby the government to upgrade the N5. The Mayo Industries Group is made up of household names including Coca-Cola (through its Mayo subsidiary Ballina Beverages), Allergan Pharmaceuticals, Baxter and Hollister. The group has met with senior government ministers on several occasions in an attempt to secure funding for further improvements to the road. Completed schemes Ballaghaderreen bypass This scheme comprises of standard single carriageway and provides a bypass to the north of Ballaghaderreen town. The project includes realignment/bridging of local roads and a major grade separated junction between the N5 and R293 to provide access to the town. An Bord Pleanála approved the scheme in 2008. Transport Minister Leo Varadkar turned the first sod on the project on 2 November 2012, and the road opened on 2 September 2014. Longford bypass This is a standard single carriageway link between the N4 and the existing N5. It provides a bypass to the northwest of Longford town so that traffic between Dublin and Mayo no longer has to pass through Longford town centre. The scheme includes rail and river bridge crossings and access is restricted to the roundabouts at either end of the scheme. Construction commenced in April 2011 and the road opened to traffic on 3 August 2012. Charlestown bypass An long single carriageway bypass of Charlestown, from east of Carracastle to the end of the Swinford bypass at Cloonlara, began construction in March 2006 and opened on 2 November 2007. It cost €81 million to build. It is named the John Healy Road in honour of the late Irish Times journalist who wrote about the economic decline of Charlestown in the 1960s. Scramoge – Cloonmore An stretch of standard single carriageway between Strokestown and Longford commenced construction in September 2001 and was officially opened on 10 May 2004 at a cost of €21 million. The project includes two river bridges, one rail bridge, 500 metres of culverts and 600,000 cubic metres of earthworks - including excavation of 350,000 cubic metres of peat. Swinford bypass A single carriageway bypass of Swinford was completed in 1993. It incorporates a major junction with the N26 road to Ballina. Castlebar – Turlough This single carriageway includes a bypass of Turlough village and a relief road around Castlebar. It opened in 1991. Schemes in planning or construction Westport – Turlough (under construction) This project will comprise a new 20km dual carriageway from Westport to the existing N5 near Turlough, bypassing Castlebar, as well as a single carriageway relief road around Westport and the realignment of 2.5km of the N59 road north of the town. An Bórd Pleanala approved the route in May 2014. Contracts were signed in October 2019 for the construction of the project. Scramoge – Ballaghaderreen The project involves the upgrade of the N5 in Co Roscommon between Rathkeery at the eastern end of the Ballaghaderreen bypass and Scramoge, east of Strokestown. It will bypass Frenchpark, Bellanagare, Tulsk and Strokestown. The planned route, a stretch of single carriageway, was approved by An Bord Pleanala in January 2019. Turlough – Bohola The Turlough to Bohola road scheme will facilitate the upgrade of the N5 from east of Castlebar to east of Bohola. The project will combine an online upgrade of the existing N5 west of Bellavary with offline bypasses of both Bellavary and Bohola. A preferred route corridor has been selected. Route through Longford and Roscommon The N5 near Tulsk, County Roscommon in 2006, before upgrade works The N5 leaves the N4 on the northwest side of Longford. The first of the route follows a new bypass road that was completed in August 2012. Approximately west of the town, the N5 crosses the River Shannon into County Roscommon at Tarmonbarry Bridge. The road passes by Scramoge along a realignment (opened in May 2004) on the way to Strokestown. West of Strokestown, at Tulsk, the N61 crosses the N5. The route continues northwest and passes north of Ballaghaderreen (alignment opened in 2014) before crossing into Co Mayo. Route through Mayo The N5 continues west bypassing Carracastle and Charlestown (bypass opened 2007). The N17 crosses the route near Charlestown. The N26 joins the N5 at Cloonlara just east of Swinford (bypassed to the south by the N5 Swinford Bypass). The N5 runs west/southwest through Bohola to Bellavary, where it meets the N58. The N5 continues west towards Castlebar, where it bypasses the town on the southeastern side. West/southwest of Castlebar, the road enters Westport along Castlebar Street, Bridge Street and Shop Street (the N5 also runs via James Street and North Mall). At The Octagon in Westport town centre, the N5 meets the N59. The N5 is County Mayo's busiest road with traffic counts of almost 18,000 on the Castlebar relief road. The section between Westport and Castlebar sees over 10,000 vehicles daily, while the section with the lowest volumes is the Charlestown bypass with no more than 7,000 vehicles. Confusion over termination point Under the Local Government (Roads and Motorways) Act (Declaration of National Roads) Order 1977 - which defined the original national primary and secondary routes – the N5's terminus was set at Castlebar. The section of road between Castlebar and Westport was designated part of the N60, a national secondary route. Outdated road signage (which should have been replaced by the local authority or at least corrected) in Castlebar also indicates that the N5 commences on the Castlebar inner relief road at the Westport Road roundabout. However the road between Westport and Castlebar was upgraded to national primary route status in 1994 (under the Roads Act, 1993 (Declaration of National Roads) Order, 1994) and became part of the N5 road. Road signage on this route reflects this. The route no longer runs through Castlebar town centre in any case, having been bypassed by a relief road. Road signage on the N4 in Dublin was mostly patched to reflect the new destination only in the early 2000s but some signs reading Castlebar still remain elsewhere.

Riley Puckett (May 7, 1894 – July 13, 1946) was an American country music pioneer, best known as a member of Gid Tanner and the Skillet Lickers. Biography Puckett was born in Dallas, Paulding County, Georgia.1917 draft registration An incorrect treatment of his eyes using lead acetate during infancy left him blind. He had his formal education at the Georgia School for the Blind in Macon, Georgia. He sang and played guitar and banjo. He was first heard on the radio as a part of Clayton McMichen's Hometown Band. His vocalizing was a regular feature at the Georgia Old-Time Fiddlers Conventions. Newspaper reporters covering these events referred to him as the \\"Bald Mountain Caruso\\" in admiration of his renditions of such songs as \\"When You and I Were Young, Maggie\\" and \\"Sleep, Baby, Sleep\\". For several years Puckett played and sang with the Home Town Boys, a string- band ensemble composed of Atlanta-area musicians. They made their debut on Atlanta's six-month-old radio station, WSB, on September 18, 1922. Until going off the air in 1926, they remained one of the station's most popular acts. In 1924 Puckett accompanied fiddler Gid Tanner to New York, where, on March 7 and 8, they recorded twelve songs and tunes for the Columbia Phonograph Company. They were the first country-music artists to record for that firm. These recording sessions yielded vocal selections by Puckett and fiddle tunes by Tanner. One of Puckett's songs, \\"Rock All Our Babies to Sleep\\",(Columbia-#107-D, with \\"Little Old Log Cabin in the Lane\\", on the reverse side), established him as probably the first country-music artist to yodel on records. Yodeling was employed as an embellishment by numerous country music vocalists well into the 1940s. From 1929 Nov.4 Clayton McMichen, Riley Puckett, Lowe Stokes, Fate Norris, Bert Layne, Uncle Fuzz (prob. Frank Walker, Tom Dorsey (aka Dan Hornsby) recorded in Atlanta \\"A Night in a Blind Tiger\\" pt. 2. on Columbia Records and continued recording together on Blue Bird Records, March 1934, San Antonio, Texas. Puckett was a charter member of the influential string band Gid Tanner and His Skillet Lickers and continued to record with the group through their last session in 1934. Puckett recorded as a solo artist into the early 1940s, creating a discography of more than 200 records on such labels as Columbia, Decca, and Bluebird. His repertoire included novelty songs, religious songs, traditional folk songs, cowboy songs, and ballads from the field of popular music. Riley Puckett was one of the nationally known pioneer country music artists who gained experience and exposure at the Georgia Old-Time Fiddlers Conventions, held in Atlanta between 1913 and 1935. His dynamic single-string guitar playing, featuring dramatic bass runs, earned for him an enviable reputation as an instrumentalist. Many aspiring guitarists who followed him have studied and copied his style. Although he was an accomplished musician on several instruments, his singing was most responsible for establishing him as an important figure in the history of country music. In addition to making records, he appeared in stage shows and worked on radio stations in Atlanta and other Georgia cities, as well as selected eastern and midwestern cities. Riley Puckett was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in 1986. He died of blood poisoning on July 13, 1946, in East Point, Georgia. He had developed a pimple on his neck which turned into a boil. He ignored medical attention and continued to work until he became very ill. A doctor lanced the boil but it was too late as the blood poisoning had already set in and he died in the hospital. He is buried at Enon Baptist Church.

His political career was closely tied to that of his father, Otto von Bismarck, and he left office a few days after his father's dismissal. He succeeded his father as the 2nd Prince of Bismarck in 1898. He was born in Berlin and died in Friedrichsruh. Early life Herbert von Bismarck born in Berlin, the oldest son of Otto von Bismarck and his wife, Johanna, née von Puttkamer. He had an older sister, Marie (b. 1847), and a younger brother, Wilhelm (b. 1852). He fought in the Franco-Prussian War, sustaining a bullet wound through the left leg during a cavalry charge at the Battle of Mars-La- Tour. He joined the diplomatic service in 1874 on his father's wishes. Bismarck attempted to gain influence with the heir to the German throne, Prince Wilhelm, by appealing to his narcissism. In June 1884, he wrote to thank Wilhelm for a portrait that Wilhelm had given to him after they returned from a state visit to Russia: Bismarck became Under-Secretary and acting head of the Foreign Office in 1885, and the following year, he was appointed the State Secretary for Foreign Affairs. He additionally was appointed Minister of State of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1888. He once said, \\"My father is the only person who can handle this business\\" In 1890, when Kaiser Wilhelm II called for the resignation of Otto von Bismarck as Chancellor, Herbert von Bismarck also resigned as State Secretary, despite Wilhelm attempts to retain him so that his de facto dismissal of his father would \\"look better in the eyes of the world\\". Personal life Bismarck had wanted to marry Princess Elisabeth von Carolath-Beuthen in 1881, but his father would not allow it, as she was a Catholic divorcée and was ten years older than Herbert. The Chancellor pressured his son with tears, blackmail and threats to disinherit him by getting Kaiser Wilhelm I to change the primogeniture statutes. That experience left Herbert a very bitter and alcoholic man. He once shot five bullets through a Foreign Office window, to be told he may have hit someone. He replied, \\"Officials have to be kept in a permanent state of irritation and alarm; the moment that ceases they stop working\\". On 21 June 1892 in Vienna, he married Marguerite, Countess of Hoyos, a member of the originally-Spanish House of Hoyos from Hungary. She herself was half-English and a grand-daughter of Robert Whitehead, the inventor of the torpedo. They had five children: *Countess Hannah Leopoldine Alice von Bismarck-Schönhausen (1893–1971), married Leopold von Bredow (1875–1933) *Countess Maria Goedela von Bismarck- Schönhausen (1896–1981), married Hermann Graf Keyserling (1880-1946) *HSH Otto Christian Archibald, Prince von Bismarck (1897–1975), married Ann-Mari Tengbom (1907–1999) *Count Gottfried Alexander Georg Herbert von Bismarck-Schönhausen (1901–1949), married Melanie, Countess of Hoyos (1916–1947) *Count Albrecht Edzard Heinrich Karl von Bismarck-Schönhausen (1903–1970), married Mona Travis Strader (1897–1983). He was at his father's bedside when the latter died on 30 July 1898, at 10:57 p.m. He died in Friedrichsruh. The capital of the German colonial administration of German New Guinea was called Herbertshöhe (now Kokopo) in his honor.

Ali ibn Husayn survived the Battle of Karbala in 680 CE, after which he and other surviving family members and companions of Husayn were taken to Yazid I in Damascus. Eventually, he was allowed to return to Medina, where he led a secluded life with a few intimate companions. His life and statements were entirely devoted to asceticism and religious teachings, mostly in the form of invocations and supplications. His famous supplications are known as Al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya \\"The Scripture of Sajjad\\". Birth  Ali ibn al-Husayn was born in Medina in the Hejaz, now in Saudi Arabia, in the year 38/658–9. He may have been too young to have remembered his grandfather Ali; he was raised in the presence of his uncle Hasan and his father Husayn, Muhammad's grandchildren. It is said that Ali ibn al-Husayn was related through his mother Shahrbanu, the daughter of Yazdegerd III, to the last Sasanain Emperor. Ali ibn al-Husayn was known as ibn al-Khiyaratayn, the \\"son of the best two\\", meaning the Quraysh among the Arabs and the Persians among the non-Arabs\\".

She is said to have died shortly after giving birth to her only son Ali.Muh’sin al-Ameen al-A’mili, A’yan as-Sheea’h, Damascus, 1935, IV, 189. And in other stories this happened during the caliphate of Uthman and Ali. Ali ibn al-Husayn was related through his Sasanian bloodline to the Byzantine emperors Maurice and Tiberius II Constantine through princess Mariam, known as Shirin, daughter of emperor Maurice. In Karbala In 61/680, Muhammad's grandson Husayn ibn Ali and a small group of supporters and relatives were martyred at the Battle of Karbala by the large military forces of the Umayyad caliph Yazid, to whom Husayn had refused to give an oath of allegiance. Zayn al-Abidin accompanied his father on a march toward Kufa; he was present at the Battle of Karbala but survived the battle because he was ill. Once the Umayyad troops had martyred Husayn and his male followers, they looted the tents and took the skin upon which he was laying. It is said that Shemr was about to kill Zayn al-Abidin but his aunt Zaynab made Umar ibn Sa'ad, the Umayyad commander, spare his life. Zain al- Abidin and the enslaved women were taken to the caliph; eventually he was allowed to return to Medina. During the journey, he delivered speeches in Kufa and Damascus, and informed the people of his father's intentions. Several accounts record Zayn al-Abidin's deep sorrow over the massacre. It is said that for thirty-four years, he would weep when food was placed before him. One day a servant said to him, \\"O son of Allah’s Messenger! Is it not time for your sorrow to come to an end?\\" He replied, \\"Oh person you did not do justice by saying this! Jacob the prophet had twelve sons, and Allah made one of them disappear\\". His eyes turned white from constant weeping, his head turned grey out of sorrow, and his back became bent in the gloom (Quran, 12:84), though his son was alive in this world. But I watched while my father, my brother, my uncle, and seventeen members of my family were slaughtered all around me. How should my sorrow come to an end?\\"From Shaykh as-Sadooq, al-Khisal; quoted in al-Ameen, A’yan, IV, 195. The same is quoted from Bin Shahraashoob's Manaqib in Bihar al-Anwar, XLVI, 108; Cf. similar accounts, Ibid, pp. 108–10 The aftermath of Karbala and his Imamate Kufa's people invited Husayn to go to Kufa and be their Imam, but they did not back him and his family against Kufa's governor, who massacred them in Karbala. Thus they thought themselves responsible for the tragedy of Karbala and tried to compensate for it by throwing themselves into the struggle to obtain vengeance for Husayn's blood. They chose Sulayman b. Surad al Khuza'I as their leader and called themselves Tawwabun (penitents). They were seeking an opportunity for action, until Mukhtar al-Thaqafi came to Kufa and claimed to represent Muhammad ibn al- Hanafiyyah. He soon gained the authority of a leader and took vengeance on those who were involved in Husayn's killing. Umar ibn Sa'ad and Shemr were executed and their heads were sent to Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah. Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad was also killed in the battle on the Zab; his head was taken to the place in Kufa where Ubaid Allah had received the head of Husayn. The governor of Medina did not consider that Zayn al-Abedin was responsible for Mukhtar's action, since he had already left Medina for its outskirts to avoid being involved in political movements. Moreover, there is evidence that he was unmolested and excepted from giving allegiance to Yazid, after the Battle of Harra, where Medinans were sacked and looted by Yazid's army. Around that time, the question of the right of succession between Ali ibn al-Husayn and Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah gained the most attention. Muhammad ibn al- Hanafiyyah was a pious, brave man whom many considered him as their Imam. Other Shiʻi sects said Zayn al-Abedin had the right to inherit the Imamate, for his father Husayn had designated him the next Imam. Muhammad ibn al- Hanafiyyah said he was more worthy. After the death of Ibn Zubayr, the governor of Medina, Zayn al-Abedin and Muhammad ibn Hanafiyyah agreed to go to Mecca and appeal to the Black Stone of the Kaaba to try to determine which one of them was the true successor. They went to the Kaaba, where the Black Stone was placed. Muhammad prayed for a sign but no answer came. Afterwards, Zayn al-Abedin prayed and the Black Stone became agitated and nearly fell off the wall; thus came the answer that Zayn-al-Abidin was the true Imam after Husayn, an answer which Muhammad had already known and accepted and he showed to other people. After this, Zayn al-Abedin returned to Medina and led a quiet life with a few companions who referred to him for answers to religious questions. Social status Ali ibn al-Husayn was respected by his followers, who considered him as the fourth imam, and by the circle of Medinan scholars who considered him as an eminent traditionalist. The lawyer Said ibn al-Musayyib and the jurist and traditionist Al-Zuhri—though attached to the court of the Umayyad—were among his admirers. Al-Zuhri gave him the honorific Zayn al- Abedin—the ornament of worshippers—and narrated many Hadiths from him. Evidence for his high position among people comes from an ode told by the well-known Arab poet Farazdaq. This ode mentions an occasion when the Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik was overshadowed by the respect people showed to the imam. It was the time of Hajj when both of them were trying to reach the Black Stone through the crowd turning around the Kaaba. The people gave way to Zayn al-Abedin while Hisham struggled desperately. This deeply offended the Caliph, who sarcastically asked to whom the people had shown such respect. Farazdaq, who was present there, composed an ode addressing Hisham's question; it is considered a masterpiece of Arabic literature and the most reliable contemporaneous document describing Zayn al-Abidin. Asceticism It is narrated from the Imam that when he saw a beggar weeping, he said: If the world was in his hands and suddenly it dropped from him, it would not be worth weeping for. The Imam renounced worldly pleasures but did not give way to poverty and feebleness, rather he was \\"pious with what God prohibited\\". The Imam was self-denying and turned away from the world, and Sufis consider him as Sufi and wrote biographies about him. It is known from the Imam that while circumambulating the Kaaba, he heard a man asking God for patience, so he turned to him and said: \\"You are asking (God) for tribulation. Say: O God, I ask You for well-being and gratitude for it.\\" It is also related when asked about asceticism, Zayn al-Abidin replied, \\"Asceticism is of ten degrees: The highest degree of asceticism is the lowest degree of piety. The highest degree of piety is the lowest degree of certainty. The highest degree of certainty is the lowest degree of satisfaction. Asceticism is in one verse of Allah’s Book: 'Hence that you may not grieve for what has escaped you, nor be exultant at what He has given you.'\\" Works Al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya According to William Chittick, the Al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya is the \\"oldest prayer manual in Islamic sources and one of the most seminal works of Islamic spirituality of the early period\\". Shia tradition considers this book with great respect, ranking it behind the Quran and Ali's Nahj al-Balagha. This prayer book deals with Islamic spirituality and provides teachings on levels from the theological to the social. The traditional category of \\"faith\\", for example, which forms the basic subject matter of most of Islamic thought as developed in kalaam philosophy and Sufism, has been discussed in this book. Zayn al- Abidin refers frequently to Islamic practices, emphasizing the necessity of following the Quran and the hadith's guidelines, and the necessity of establishing justice in society. The Fifteen Whispered Prayers The Fifteen Whispered Prayers also known as The Fifteen Munajat, is a collection of fifteen prayers attributed to Zayn al-Abidin, which some researchers regard as a supplementary part of the latter collection. These prayers enable a person to recite the prayer that is most in accordance with his present mood. The prayers start with repentance, which is the first step towards a genuine communion with God. Supplication of Abu Hamza al-Thumali According to Abu Hamza al-Thumali, during the month of Ramadhan, Imam Zayn al-Abidin would spend most of the night in prayer. At the beginning of the fast, he recited a supplication later known as Du'a Abi Hamzah al-Thumali (The supplication of Abi Hamzah al-Thumali). This supplication is recorded in the book Misbah al- Mutahijjid of Shaykh Tusi. Treatise on Rights Zain al-Abidin's Treatise on Rights is the only work other than supplications, short sayings and letters, attributed to him. According to Chittick, this treatise is especially important because it deals with many of the same themes as the Sahifa in a different style and language. In this book, Zayn al-Abidin clarifies that a hierarchy of priorities must always be observed: The individual comes before the social, the spiritual before the practical, and knowledge before action. Each human being has a long series of social duties, but these depend upon his more essential duties; faith in Allah, and placing one's own person into the proper relationship with the Divine Reality. Death desecrated grave at Al- Baqi' in Saudi Arabia Zayn al-Abidin was poisoned by Umayyad ruler Al-Walid through the instigation of the Umayyad caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik in Medina. The date of his death is 95/713-14; he was buried next to his uncle, Hasan, in the cemetery of Al-Baqi' cemetery in Medina. After his death many people discovered their livelihoods had come from him. He would go out with a sack of food on his back, knocking at the doors of more than 100 families, and gave freely to whoever answered while covering his face to avoid being recognized.

The park features thousands of hoodoos, referred to locally as goblins, which are formations of mushroom-shaped rock pinnacles, some as tall as several yards (meters). The distinct shapes of these rocks result from an erosion-resistant layer of rock atop relatively softer sandstone. Goblin Valley State Park and Bryce Canyon National Park, also in Utah about to the southwest, contain some of the largest occurrences of hoodoos in the world. The park lies within the San Rafael Desert on the southeastern edge of the San Rafael Swell, north of the Henry Mountains. Utah State Route 24 passes about east of the park. Hanksville lies to the south.San Rafael Desert, Utah, 30x60 Minute Topographic Quadrangle, USGS, 1986Hanksville, Utah, 30x60 Minute Topographic Quadrangle, USGS, 1980  History  Coffee table arch Evidence of Native American cultures, including the Fremont, Paiute, and Ute, is common throughout the San Rafael Swell in the form of pictograph and petroglyph panels. Goblin Valley is noted for several rock art panels, as well as the rock formations. The secluded Goblin Valley was then found by cowboys searching for cattle. Then, in the late 1920s, Arthur Chaffin, later owner/operator of the Hite Ferry, and two companions, were searching for an alternate route between Green River and Caineville. They came to a vantage point about west of Goblin Valley and were awed by what they saw - five buttes and a valley of strange, goblin-shaped rock formations surrounded by a wall of eroded cliffs. In 1949, Chaffin returned to the area he called Mushroom Valley. He spent several days exploring the mysterious valley and photographing its scores of intricately eroded rocks. Publicity attracted visitors to the valley despite its remoteness. In 1954, it was proposed that Goblin Valley be protected from vandalism. The state of Utah later acquired the property and established Goblin Valley State Reserve. It was officially designated a state park on August 24, 1964. In 2019 the state park was expanded by adding 6,261 acres of federal land. 2013 vandalism A naturally fallen hoodoo, not the vandalized one In October 2013, a delicately balanced hoodoo was intentionally knocked over by a Boy Scout while two other men watched, one of whom recorded a video that was later uploaded to the Internet. The men claimed that the hoodoo appeared ready to fall, and that it was intentionally knocked over to prevent park visitors from being hurt. The hoodoo formation had existed for many millions of years, having formed out of rock that dated back as far as 165 million years. The average rate of erosion of a hoodoo is approximately 2–4 feet (0.6-1.3 m) every 100 years. The two leaders were subsequently dismissed from their leadership roles by the Utah National Parks Council, which is a local council of the Boy Scouts in Utah. The national Boy Scouts then removed the men from the scouting organization altogether. In January 2014, two of the menthe one who toppled the hoodoo and the cameramanwere arraigned on felony charges of \\"criminal mischief\\" and \\"intentionally damaging, defacing and destroying property.\\" The two men pleaded guilty to lesser charges of criminal mischief and attempted criminal mischief, and received a sentence of one year probation plus fines and case-related fees.  Plants and animals  The flora of Goblin Valley include Mormon tea, Russian thistle, Indian ricegrass, and various cacti, as well as junipers and pinyon pines at higher elevations.\\"Goblin Valley State Park Brochure\\" (archive). stateparks.utah.gov. State of Utah. July 2017. Retrieved January 7, 2019. Fauna include jackrabbits, scorpions, kangaroo rats, pronghorns, kit foxes, midget faded rattlesnakes, and coyotes.  Geology  Mushroom caprocks The unusual stone shapes in Goblin Valley result from the weathering of Entrada sandstone. The Entrada consists of debris eroded from former highlands and redeposited on a former tidal flat of alternating layers of sandstone, siltstone, and shale. The rocks show evidence of being near the margins of an ancient sea with the ebb and flow of tides, tidal channels that directed currents back to the sea and coastal sand dunes. Joint or fracture patterns within the Entrada sandstone beds created initial zones of weakness. The unweathered joints intersected to form sharp edges and corners with greater surface-area-to-volume ratios than the faces. As a result, the edges and corners weathered more quickly, producing the spherical-shaped 'goblins'. The Entrada sandstone from which the hoodoos developed was deposited in the Jurassic period around 170 million years ago.  Climate  Dark red hoodoos at dusk Average daytime highs in the summer average between , though the low humidity, high elevation, and sparse vegetation allow evenings to cool off rapidly to about . Also, the intermittent summer monsoon arriving from the south can bring intense and localized thunderstorms. The rugged terrain and intense rainfall can lead to devastating flash floods, while the low humidity combined with gusty winds and frequent lightning can spark wildfires. Winters have colder temperatures and occasional snow, with temperatures above freezing most days, but often dropping as low as at night. The average precipitation is less than . Film Goblin Valley was prominently featured in the movie Galaxy Quest (1999) as an alien planet. The eroded sandstone dunes in the valley inspired the design of the fictional planet’s rock monsters.

Burmese literature was historically influenced by Indian and Thai cultures, as seen in many works, such as the Ramayana. The Burmese language, unlike other Southeast Asian languages (e.g. Thai, Khmer), adopted words primarily from Pāli rather than from Sanskrit. In addition, Burmese literature tends to reflect local folklore and culture. Burmese literature has historically been a very important aspect of Burmese life steeped in the Pali Canon of Buddhism. Traditionally, Burmese children were educated by monks in monasteries in towns and villages. During British colonial rule, instruction was formalised and unified, and often bilingual, in both English and Burmese known as Anglo- Vernacular. Burmese literature played a key role in disseminating nationalism among the Burmese during the colonial era, with writers such as Thakin Kodaw Hmaing, an outspoken critic of British colonialism in Burma. Beginning soon after self-rule, government censorship in Burma has been heavy, stifling literary expression. Classical literature The earliest forms of Burmese literature were on stone engravings called kyauksa () for memorials or for special occasions such as the building of a temple or a monastery. Later, palm leaves called peisa () were used as paper, which resulted in the rounded forms of the Burmese alphabet. During the Bagan Dynasty, King Anawrahta adopted Theravada Buddhism as the state religion, and brought many Pali texts from Ceylon. These texts were translated, but Pali remained the literary medium of the Burmese kingdom. Furthermore, Pali influenced Burmese language in structure, because of literal translations of Pali text called nissaya (). The earliest works of Burmese literature date from the Bagan dynasty. They include proses recording monarchical merit acts and poetic works, the earliest of which was Yakhaing minthami eigyin (Cradle Song of the Princess of Arakan), dated to 1455. During the Bagan and Inwa dynasties, two primary types of literature flourished, mawgun () and eigyin, () and pyo (), religious works generally derived from the Jataka tales. Non-fiction and religious works prevailed during this period although kagyin (), a war poem by a monarch, was an early form of this genre in history. As literature grew more liberal and secular, poetry became the most popular form of literature in Burma. The flexibility of the Burmese language, because of its monosyllabic and tonal nature, and its lack of many consonantal finals allowed poetry to utilise various rhyming schemes. By the 15th century, four primary genres of poetry had emerged, namely pyo (poems based on the Jataka Tales, ' ( metaphysical and religious poems), mawgun (historical verses written as a hybrid of epic and ode), and eigyin (lullabies of the royal family). Courtiers also perfected the myittaza (), a long prose letter. Buddhist monks were also influential in developing Burmese literature. Shin Aggathammadi rendered in verse the Jataka stories. During this time, Shin Maha Thilawuntha (1453–1520) wrote a chronicle on the history of Buddhism. A contemporary of his, Shin Ottama Gyaw, was famous for his epic verses called tawla () that revelled in the natural beauty of the seasons, forests and travel. Yawei Shin Htwe, a maid of honour, wrote another form of poetry called aingyin on the 55 styles of hairdressing. After the conquest of Siam by the Toungoo Dynasty, Thailand became a Burmese colony. This conquest incorporated many Thai elements into Burmese literature. Most evident were the yadu or yatu (), an emotional and philosophic verse and the yagan (), which imitated the themes of the yadu genre, which was more emotionally involved, could be inspired by mood, place, incident, and often addressed to sweethearts and wives. Famous writers of yadu include Nawade I (1545–1600) and Prince Natshinnaung (1578–1619). Some parts of Laos and Cambodia also became Burmese colonies during Second Burmese Empire and thereby influenced Burmese literature. In the areas of law, there were two major types of literature, dhammathat (), which appeared prior to the 13th century, and shauk-htone (), which were compilations of brief accounts of historic cases and events in simple narrative to serve as guides and legal precedents for rulers. As the Konbaung Dynasty emerged in the 18th century, the Third Burmese Empire was founded. This era has been dubbed the \\"Golden Age of Literature\\", with poets such as Letwe Thondara. After a second conquest of Ayutthaya (Thailand), many spoils of war were brought to the Burmese court. The Ramayana () was introduced and was adapted in Burmese. In addition, the Ramayana inspired romantic poems, which became popular literary sojourns among the royal class. Burmese literature during this period was therefore modelled after the Ramayana, and dramatic plays were patronised by the Burmese court. The Burmese adapted Thai verses and created four new classical verses, called: taydat (), laygyo (), dwaygyo () and bawle (). First printing press (1816) The arrival of the first printing press in Burma in 1816, sent by the British Serampore Mission, helped to liberalise centuries-old traditions of writing in verse (lay-lone tha-paik (), a poetry type, where four syllable lines are linked in a climbing rhyme and grouped into stanzas of 30 lines.). Monks remained powerful in Burmese literature, compiling histories of Burma. Kyigan Shingyi (1757–1807) wrote the Jataka Tales incorporating Burmese elements, including the myittaza (Pali metta or love + Burmese sa or letter), which are love letters and are important sources of first-hand accounts of the economic and social changes Burma was undergoing before colonialism. During the First Anglo-Burmese War (1823–1826), more solemn and muted moods exuded from Burmese literature, including lyrical music. In addition, yazawin, historical chronicles, became important in the Konbaung dynasty, although they had been written since the Inwa dynasty. In 1724, U Kala wrote the Maha yazawin gyi (The Great Chronicles), covering Burmese history until 1711. In 1829, King Bagyidaw appointed scholars to compile the Hmannan yazawin dawgyi (Glass Palace Chronicle), covering Burmese history until 1821. A successor king, King Mindon Min appointed a committee of Burmese scholars from 1867 to 1869 to create the Dutiya maha yazawin dawgyi (The Second Great Royal Chronicles). British Burma (1824-1948) When Burma became a colony of British India, Burmese literature continued to flourish, even though the institution of the Burmese monarchy, the leading patron of Burmese arts and literature in pre-colonial times, had been dismantled. English literature was still relatively inaccessible although both English and Burmese, in a curriculum called Anglo-Vernacular, was now taught in schools. Despite the fact that Burmese literature was well entrenched in Burmese culture, the lack of patrons to support literature slowed its further development. The colonial period marked a tremendous change in Burmese literature, which had once been patronised and innovated by members of the royal court, and was now being led by civilians such as university students. In 1910, J S Furnivall established the Burma Research Society, which further emboldened the Burmese to protect their literary and cultural heritage. Beginning in the 1920s, a nationalist movement emerged, and this influence became evident in modern novels, short stories, and poems. At the University of Rangoon, student writers continued to develop new forms of Burmese poetry. A major landmark in Burmese literature was called the Hkit san (Testing the Times, ) movement, a search for a new style and content, led most notably by Theippan Maung Wa along with Nwe Soe, Zawgyi, Min Thu Wun and Mya Kaytu, while still at university and after, in the decade before the Second World War. During the Hkit san movement, University of Rangoon students innovated new styles of writing, with shorter and clearer sentences, and unadorned prose, a radical transformation from royal writings of the pre-colonial eras beforehand. The movement for independence continued to fuel Burmese literature. Thakin Kodaw Hmaing was greatly influential in spawning this anti-colonial literature with his powerful laygyo gyi () and htika () verses famous for their patriotic and satirical content. Hmawbi Hsaya Thein was particularly influential, with Bazat yazawin (Oral Chronicles), which relied on oral tradition. Novels also came into vogue, with the first being James Hla Kyaw's Maung Yin Maung Ma Me Ma, written in 1904 and inspired by the Count of Monte Cristo. Kala paw wut-htu (, 'modern novels') became popular during this era, with P Moe Nin writing the first Burmese novels to focus on the individual and place that character at the centre of the plot. Theippan Maung Wa and Thein Pe Myint were among other original and innovative authors from the colonial period. Female writers, such as Dagon Khin Khin Lay, who wrote about the hardships of peasant life under colonialism, also gained prominence during the nationalist period leading up to independence. The British author George Orwell, who was severely critical of British colonialism, wrote Burmese Days published in 1935. In addition, literary culture in Burma expanded to the masses during this period, with the arrival of printing presses and publishers, such as the Hanthawaddy Press, a major publisher of Burmese and Buddhist works established by Phillip Ripley. In the 1920s to the 1930s, monthly literary magazines like Dagon and Ganda Lawka (World of Classics) were published to connect readers to writers, who often published novels in serial installations. Post-independence literature (1948-) After independence in 1948, Burmese literature developed further to adopt and assimilate Western styles of writing. A year earlier, the Burmese Translation Society, a government-subsidised organisation, was founded to translate foreign works, especially those related to the fields of science and technology. In 1963, a year after the socialist coup, the Society was merged into the Sapay Beikman (), a government publishing house. Another influential publisher was the Pagan Press (est. 1962), which translated Socialist and Marxist works into Burmese. In 1976, the first Burmese Encyclopedia () was published. The socialist government, like the previous civilian government, was a patron of Burmese literature, believing \\"enriching literature\\" to be a goal of socialist democracies, as outlined in the Revolutionary Council's System of Correlation of Man and his Environment. However, censorship and promotion of socialist ideology became important aims of the government, in regulating literature, as seen in the reorganisation of the Ministry of Information, which censored works according to three primary objectives that aimed to promote socialism: > # To introduce necessary bills, acts and orders concerning literature and > information agencies. # To promote participation of the people in the > construction of the socialist state. # To defend the socialist system from > its ideological enemies. —Discussion of the National Literary Conference. > Rangoon: Ministry of Information, 1963.  Censorship  In 1971, the government formed the Burmese literary Commission, to develop Burmese literature further. On 5 July 1975, the Printers and Publishers' Central Registration Board, the main censorship board of the Home Ministry (four years earlier, the Board had been a part of the Information Ministry), issued a statement to warn publishers to self-censor works (especially those criticising the Burma Socialist Programme Party, the government, pornographic writing and libel), undermining the principle of freedom of expression. Many contemporary works are of history and biographical accounts. Because of strict government censorship beginning in the 1960s with the rule of Ne Win, Burmese literature has become subdued in many ways. By 1976, only 411 titles were published annually, compared to 1882, when 445 titles were published.Statistics available on page 86 of U Thaung's Contemporary Burmese Literature. Various factors, especially the lengthened bureaucratic process to obtain printing permits, censorship, and increasing economic hardship of consumers because of the socialist economic schemes, contributed to the decline of Burmese literary output. Popular novels have similar themes, often involving adventure, espionage, detective work, and romance. Many writers also translate Western novels, especially those of Arthur Hailey and Harold Robbins. The flourishing translation sector is the result of the Burmese government, which did not sign the Universal Copyright Convention Agreement, which would have forced Burmese writers to pay royalties to the original writers. Short stories, often published in magazines, also enjoy tremendous popularity. They often deal with everyday life and have political messages (such as subtle criticisms of the capitalist system), partly because unlike novels, short stories are not censored by the Press Scrutiny Board. Poetry is also a popular genre today, as it was during the monarchical times, but unlike novels and other works, which use literary Burmese, may use the vernacular, instead of literary Burmese. This reform movement is led by left-leaning writers who believe laymen's language (the vernacular and colloquial form of Burmese) ought to be used instead of formal Burmese in literature. One of the greatest female writers of the Post-colonial period is Journal Kyaw Ma Ma Lay. Khin Myo Chit was another important writer, who wrote, among her works, The 13-Carat Diamond (1955), which was translated into many languages. The journalist Ludu U Hla was the author of numerous volumes of ethnic minority folklore, novels about inmates in U Nu-era jails, and biographies of people working in different occupations. The Prime Minister U Nu himself wrote several politically oriented plays and novels. Other prolific writers of the post-colonial era include Thein Pe Myint (and his The Ocean Traveller and the Pearl Queen, considered a Burmese classic), Mya Than Tint (known for his translations of Western classics like War and Peace), Thawda Swe and Myat Htun. Distinguished female writers, who have also been an ever-present force in Burmese literary history, include Kyi Aye, Khin Hnin Yu, and San San Nweh.  Contemporary  In 2012, Bones Will Crow: 15 Contemporary Burmese Poets was published by Arc Publications (UK). It was edited by ko ko thett and James Byrne and featured poetry from Tin Moe, Thitsar Ni, Aung Cheimt, Ma Ei, Maung Chaw Nwe, Maung Pyiyt Min, Khin Aung Aye, Zeyar Lynn, Maung Thein Zaw, Moe Zaw, Moe Way, ko ko thett, Eaindra, Pandora and Maung Yu Py and was published as part of Arc Publications Anthologies in Translation series and, later in 2013, by Northern Illinois University Press in the United States. This bi-lingual edition of poetry is regarded as the first anthology of modern Burmese poetry in the West.

Today, Syndal has no banks, petrol stations, or supermarkets. At one point in time there were five schools, three primary schools and two secondary schools, containing the name Syndal - The former schools of Syndal High School, Syndal Technical School, and Syndal Primary School, and the continuing Syndal North Primary School (now Mount Waverley North Primary School), and Syndal South Primary School. Syndal has a nominated Australia Post postal office, although Syndal is still part of the greater Mount Waverley and Glen Waverley suburbs, and shares the same postal code as Mount Waverley, 3149, or Glen Waverley, 3150. Syndal was originally the name of a farm owned by Sir Redmond Barry on High Street Road, which was purchased off Barry by the Coleman family who consolidated a number of farms at the time. The name for the locality was reclaimed in 1930 when the railway line to Glen Waverley station was opened and the name for the station at Blackburn Road and Coleman Parade had to be decided.

The organization was founded in 1990 by film critics Sharon LeMaire and Sue Kiner, following the success of the first Chicago Film Critics Awards given out in 1988. The association comprises 60 members. Since 1989, the CFCA has given out annual awards that recognize the best films in a variety of categories. These awards are noted in the established print media such as Variety and The Hollywood Reporter. The association has also hosted the annual Chicago Critics Film Festival since 2013, which intends to bring a number of feature and short films to a larger audience. Membership The Chicago Film Critics Association restricts its membership to professional film critics, who have been employed in the media as a \\"critical voice or staff authority\\" on the subject of the cinema for six months. Applicants for membership in the CFCA must provide a letter signed by a producer or editor showing they have been in paid employment as a critic, as well as examples of published work. Applicants must also reside in the Chicago area. By 2004, the CFCA had just over 40 members and now comprises over 60. Its membership includes writers for such film-related websites and print media as Ain't It Cool News, The A.V. Club, Chicago Sun-Times, Daily Herald, Consequence of Sound, Paste, and eFilmCritic.com.  Chicago Film Critics Awards  The Chicago Film Critics Awards (also known as the Chicago Flames) have been held annually since 1988 and recognise achievement in film making and acting performances. The first awards were compiled by the CFCA's founders and were not presented in a ceremony. In the past, winners received a glass Chicago Flame trophy, which featured an etching of the Chicago skyline created by artist Josef Puehringer. Current award categories * Best Actor * Best Actress * Best Adapted Screenplay (2006–) * Best Animated Film (2007–) * Best Art Direction (2012–) * Best Cinematography (1990–93, 1995–) * Best Director * Best Documentary (2001–) * Best Editing (2012–) * Best Film * Best Foreign Language Film * Best Original Score (1993–) * Best Original Screenplay (2006–) * Best Supporting Actor * Best Supporting Actress * Most Promising Filmmaker (2001–) * Most Promising Performer (2001–) Previous award categories * Best Screenplay (1990–2005) * Most Promising Actor (1988–2000) * Most Promising Actress (1988–2000) 20th Century Fox boycott In 2007, the CFCA boycotted all 20th Century Fox and Fox Searchlight films, as part of a protest over the studio's decision to limit online critics' access to media screenings. A number of critics complained that the late media screenings affected the quality of their reviews. The CFCA's protest garnered support from many other film critics associations, including the Washington D.C. Area Film Critics Association and the San Francisco Film Critics Circle. Chicago Critics Film Festival The Chicago Critics Film Festival was founded in 2013 and is held annually. It is the only film festival in the country that is entirely programmed and produced by a film critics association. Of the decision to host a film festival, Erik Childress, the festival's producer and CFCA board member stated, \\"We really wanted to be a bigger part of the film discussion here in Chicago, and we wanted to bring the discussion about these films to the community. It was an idea that was floating out there until we had the means to pull it off. It's really expanded far beyond what we expected.\\" The inaugural event was held from April 12–14, 2013 at the Muvico Theater in Rosemont. The festival showcased over 20 films that would have had a low distribution in a bid to expose them to a larger audience. Films shown included The Spectacular Now and The Dirties. The event also featured Q&A; sessions with directors William Friedkin and Sarah Polley. The second festival was expanded to a week, beginning May 9, 2014 at the Music Box Theatre.

The unit evolved several times until 1921, after which the name was lost during one of many reorganisations. History Beginnings – 49th Middlesex Rifle Volunteers Corps (Post Office Rifles) When the Volunteer Force was formed in 1859/60 Viscount Bury raised the 21st Middlesex Rifles Volunteer Corps (Civil Service Rifles) drawing its recruits from civil servants based in London. There were sufficient recruits from the GPO staff to form a Post Office company, which was placed under Captain John Lowther du Plat Taylor's command. Ambulance detachment, 24th Middlesex Rifle Volunteers (Post Office), 1897 On 13 December 1867 a bomb exploded outside Middlesex House of Detention, Clerkenwell. It was an attempt to rescue two members of Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) detained there awaiting trial.Campbell C: Fenian Fire – The British Government Plot to Assassinate Queen Victoria (HarperCollins, London, 2002) The Government's response was to raise special constables to protect London buildings against future \\"Fenian outrages\\". The GPO special constables had been supervised and trained by Major JL du Plat Taylor (and Civil Service Rifles' NCOs). After the crisis was over the GPO special constables approached du Plat Taylor to request that they be formed into a Rifle Volunteer unit. Du Plat Taylor, who was the Private Secretary to the Postmaster General, sought permission from the Postmaster General and the War Office to form such a unit. Permission was granted and on 2 March 1868 the 49th Middlesex Rifle Volunteers Corps (Post Office Rifles) was duly raised from the Post Office Companies (Civil Service Rifles) and the special constables all of whom were GPO servants. Du Plat Taylor become its first commanding officer. In 1880 a reorganisation of the volunteer corps saw the unit renumbered as the 24th Middlesex Rifle Volunteers (Post Office Rifles). Service in Egypt In 1882 a detachment of two officers and 102 men volunteered for service in Egypt, where they performed postal and telegraph duties under the command of General Garnet Wolseley. As the Army Post Office Corps (APOC) they came under enemy fire at Kassassin in so doing became the first 'volunteers' to see enemy action. The 24th Battalion was awarded their first battle honour \\"Egypt 1882\\". South Africa During the Second Boer War the 24th Middlesex contributed a large number of volunteers comprising 16 officers and more than 1,000 other ranks. In 1907 they were awarded the battle honour \\"South Africa 1899–1902\\". In 1902 the 24th Middlesex (Post office) was one of six rifle corps to form the 4th or City of London Brigade, a volunteer infantry brigade. Territorial Force More changes were introduced upon the creation of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907. This Act brought the part-time Volunteer Force infantry artillery and engineer units and Yeomanry (mounted) regiments from across the country together into a single Territorial Force in 1908. As a result of this, the 24th Middlesex became the 8th (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment (Post Office Rifles). World War I The Post Office Rifles served with distinction in the Great War. They arrived in France on 18 March 1915. By the end of the war, 1,800 men from the Post Office Rifles would be dead and 4,500 more would be wounded. After the outbreak of the war, the existing units of the Territorial Force each formed duplicate (or \\"second line\\") units. The existing Post Office Rifles was redesignated as the 1/8th Battalion, London Regiment when a second Post Office Rifles battalion, the 2/8th Londons, was formed in September 1914. In 1915 a third line battalion, the 3/8th was formed. Between them, the three battalions earned 19 battle honours. At the Capture of Wurst Farm, in September 1917, the 2/8th lost over half its fighting strength, dead or wounded, but its men were awarded a total of 40 gallantry medals. These included a Victoria Cross won by Sergeant A. J. Knight, making him the only Post Office Rifleman to win this honour. Battle honours The battle honours awarded to the 8th (City of London) Battalion, The London Regiment (Post Office Rifles) for the \\"Great War\\" were announced in March 1924. Ten honours (shown in bold type) were selected by the regiment to be displayed on the King's Colours: *Festubert, 1915 *Loos *Somme 1916, '18 *Flers-Courcelette *Le Transloy *Bullecourt *Messines, 1917 *Ypres, 1917 *Menin Road *Passchendaele *Cambrai, 1917 *St. Quentin *Bapaume, 1918 *Amiens *Albert, 1918 *Hindenburg Line *Épehy *Pursuit to Mons *France and Flanders 1915–'18 After the Great War Further reorganisations took place after World War I. Many saw these changes as a dilution of the battalion's Post Office identity. Included in these reorganisations was the amalgamation of the 8th Battalion with the non-Post Office 7th (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment in 1921, forming the 7th London Regiment (Post Office Rifles). In 1935, it was converted from infantry to the searchlight role as the 32nd (7th City of London) Anti-aircraft Battalion, Royal Engineers, and the 'Post Office Rifles' name was finally dropped. In 1939 they expanded from Finsbury Square, into newly built drill-halls at Grove Park and Bexleyheath. Shortly afterward the unit was split, forming a duplicate battalion at Bexleyheath called 73rd (Kent Fortress) S/Light Battalion, Royal Engineers, with outstations at Greenhithe and Sidcup. In 1940 both units re-badged as Royal Artillery. Successor units still occupy Grove Park and Bexleyheath drill- halls, as 265 (Home Counties) Battery, 106th (Yeomanry) Regiment, Royal Artillery and 265 (Kent and County of London Yeomanry) Support Squadron, Royal Corps of Signals. Both units strive to continue and maintain the traditions and history of their predecessor regiments. Memorials to the Post Office Rifles Memorials to the Post Office Rifles can be found at Paignton War Memorial, at St. Lawrence Parish Church, Abbots Langley, and on a plaque outside the Uckfield village church. A Book of Remembrance is placed in the church traditionally associated with the Post Office Rifles at Church of St Botolph Aldersgate, London EC1. There is no formal memorial to the Rifles in France, but many of the fallen from the Great War have their names recorded on memorials such as the Menin Gate at Ypres and Sir Edwin Lutyens's memorial to the missing at Thiepval. Also on the Pozieres Memorial to the missing of 1918 and notably the Arras memorial. Men of the Rifles are buried in Bedford House Cemetery outside Ieper (Ypres)in Belgium. . A Regimental memorial plaque is displayed within The Army Reserve Centre in Grove Park, London. Correspondence Captain Home Peel, the Adjutant of the 1st/8th Post Office Rifles was killed in action on 24 March 1918. The Royal Mail archive in London contains some letters and other documents relating to his wartime service. These paint a picture of a typical officer educated at Charterhouse and employed by the India Office prior to World War I. There is a letter written on German military stationery, the purpose of which was to comfort Mrs. Peel. This humanitarian gesture was made by E.F. Gayler, who describes himself in the letter as 'late of 45 Stainton Road, Entcliffe, Sheffield'. In this letter, he writes: \\"Although enemy and sometime deeply hurt by the ridiculous tone of your home press, I feel it a human duty to communicate these sad news. Capt. Peel was killed in action near Longueval and died, as it seems by the wounds received, without suffering.\\" See also *Volunteer Force (Great Britain) *Territorial Army (United Kingdom) *British Army *Militia (United Kingdom) *Honourable Artillery Company *Bermuda Volunteer/Territorial Army Units 1895-1965 *The Royal Hong Kong Regiment (The Volunteers) *Yeomanry *1st Nottinghamshire (Robin Hood) Volunteer Rifle Corps (VRC) *Artists' Rifles *The Liverpool Scottish *Home Service Force References and sources ;Notes ;Sources * The British Postal Museum & Archive Further reading * A list of those who served and lost their lives in World War I * Post Office Rifles British Postal Museum & Archive Information Sheet * Terriers in the Trenches : The Post Office Rifles at War 1914–1918 by Charles Messenger – (1982) * Men of Letters: The Post Office Heroes who Fought the Great War by Duncan Barrett – (2014) * Postmen at War by Col ET Vallance CBE ERD - (2015) * THE POST OFFICE RIFLES, 8th Battalion City of London Regiment 1914 to 1918 – (1919) * The Regimental History of the 32nd Searchlight Regiment Royal Artillery (7th City of London TA) – Whittington Press (1943) * Londoners on the Western Front, a history of the 58th Division 1914-1919 by David Martin (2014) Category:Military units and formations in London Category:Battalions of the London Regiment (1908–1938) Category:1868 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:1921 disestablishments in the United Kingdom Category:Military units and formations established in 1868 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1921 ","title":"Post Office Rifles"},{"id":"1108481","text":"Jon F.

Each wishbone or arm has two mounting points to the chassis and one joint at the knuckle. The shock absorber and coil spring mount to the wishbones to control vertical movement. Double wishbone designs allow the engineer to carefully control the motion of the wheel throughout suspension travel, controlling such parameters as camber angle, caster angle, toe pattern, roll center height, scrub radius, scuff and more. Implementation Saab Quantum IV The double-wishbone suspension can also be referred to as \\"double A-arms\\", though the arms themselves can be A-shaped, L-shaped, or even a single bar linkage. A single wishbone or A-arm can also be used in various other suspension types, such as variations of the MacPherson strut. The upper arm is usually shorter to induce negative camber as the suspension jounces (rises), and often this arrangement is titled an \\"SLA\\" or \\"short long arms\\" suspension. When the vehicle is in a turn, body roll results in positive camber gain on the lightly loaded inside wheel, while the heavily loaded outer wheel gains negative camber. Between the outboard end of the arms is a knuckle. The knuckle contains a kingpin for horizontal radial movement in older designs, and rubber or trunion bushings for vertical hinged movement. In newer designs, a ball joint at each end allow for all movement. Attached to the knuckle at its center is a bearing hub, or in many older designs, a spindle to which the wheel bearings are mounted. To resist fore-aft loads such as acceleration and braking, the arms require two bushings or ball joints at the body. Double wishbone suspension in action as on display at the Toyota Museum in Nagoya, Japan At the knuckle end, single ball joints are typically used, in which case the steering loads have to be taken via a steering arm, and the wishbones look A- or L-shaped. An L-shaped arm is generally preferred on passenger vehicles because it allows a better compromise of handling and comfort to be tuned in. The bushing in line with the wheel can be kept relatively stiff to effectively handle cornering loads while the off-line joint can be softer to allow the wheel to recess under fore-aft impact loads. For a rear suspension, a pair of joints can be used at both ends of the arm, making them more H-shaped in plan view. Alternatively, a fixed-length driveshaft can perform the function of a wishbone as long as the shape of the other wishbone provides control of the upright. This arrangement has been successfully used in the Jaguar IRS. In elevation view, the suspension is a 4-bar link, and it is easy to work out the camber gain (see camber angle) and other parameters for a given set of bushing or ball-joint locations. The various bushings or ball joints do not have to be on horizontal axes, parallel to the vehicle centre line. If they are set at an angle, then anti-dive and anti-squat geometry can be dialled in. In many racing cars, the springs and dampers are relocated inside the bodywork. The suspension uses a bellcrank to transfer the forces at the knuckle end of the suspension to the internal spring and damper. This is then known as a \\"push rod\\" if bump travel \\"pushes\\" on the rod (and subsequently the rod must be joined to the bottom of the upright and angled upward). As the wheel rises, the push rod compresses the internal spring via a pivot or pivoting system. The opposite arrangement, a \\"pull rod\\", will pull on the rod during bump travel, and the rod must be attached to the top of the upright, angled downward. Locating the spring and damper inboard increases the total mass of the suspension, but reduces the unsprung mass, and also allows the designer to make the suspension more aerodynamic. Short long arms suspension A short long arms suspension (SLA) is also known as an unequal length double wishbone suspension. The upper arm is typically an A-arm, and is shorter than the lower link, which is an A-arm or an L-arm, or sometimes a pair of tension/compression arms. In the latter case the suspension can be called a multi-link, or dual ball joint suspension. The four-bar linkage mechanism formed by the unequal arm lengths causes a change in the camber of the vehicle as it rolls, which helps to keep the contact patch square on the ground, increasing the ultimate cornering capacity of the vehicle. It also reduces the wear of the outer edge of the tire. SLAs can be classified as short spindle, in which the upper ball joint on the spindle is inside the wheel, or long spindle, in which the spindle tucks around the tire and the upper ball joint sits above the tire. Drawbacks Short spindle SLAs tend to require stiffer bushings at the body, as the braking and cornering forces are higher. Also they tend to have poorer kingpin geometry, due to the difficulty of packaging the upper ball joint and the brakes inside the wheel. Long spindle SLAs tend to have better kingpin geometry, but the proximity of the spindle to the tyre restricts fitting oversized tyres, or snowchains. The location of the upper balljoint may have styling implications in the design of the sheetmetal above it. SLAs require some care when setting up their bump steer characteristic, as it is easy to end up with excessive, or curved, bump steer curves. History The double wishbone suspension was introduced in the 1930s. French car maker Citroën began using it in their 1934 Rosalie and Traction Avant models. Packard Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan, used it on the Packard One- Twenty from 1935, and advertised it as a safety feature. During that time MacPherson strut was still in the area of aviation technology and was derived from aircraft landing mechanism. Later on, until 1951, Ford Company decided to use the MacPherson strut on small production cars, the English Ford Consul and Ford Zephyr. Thus, the double wishbone was applied early in automobiles history and there are no genetic relationship between MacPherson strut and double wishbone suspension. Double wishbones are usually considered to have superior dynamic characteristics as well as load-handling capabilities, and are therefore commonly found on sports cars and racing cars throughout automotive history. Examples of makes in which double wishbones can be found include Alfa Romeo, Lancia, Maserati, , Mazda MX-5/Roadster, MG, Saab, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, ToyotaToyota Celica 2000-05 and Pontiac vehicles. The Aston Martin DB7, the Rover 600, the Honda NSX, Honda S2000 and the Honda Prelude use a rare double wishbone suspension set-up both at the front and rear, informed by Honda's experience in Formula One. Short long arms suspension, a type of double wishbone suspension, is very common on front suspensions for medium-to-large cars such as the Honda Accord (replaced by the simpler and less expensive MacPherson struts in 2013+ models), Peugeot 407, Citroen C5, Peugeot 508 GT or Mazda 6/Atenza (equally replaced by MacPherson struts in 2014+ models). The Honda Civic used double wishbone suspension design until 2000 (replaced by MacPherson struts in 2001+ models). It also provides least camber change at bump and rebound condition. Advantages The double wishbone suspension provides the engineer more design choices than some other types do. It is fairly easy to work out the effect of moving each joint, so the kinematics of the suspension can be tuned easily and wheel motion can be optimized. It is also easy to work out the loads that different parts will be subjected to which allows more optimised lightweight parts to be designed. They also provide increasing negative camber gain all the way to full jounce travel, unlike the MacPherson strut, which provides negative camber gain only at the beginning of jounce travel and then reverses into positive camber gain at high jounce amounts. Disadvantages Double wishbone suspensions may take up less space but are more complex, and thus more expensive, than other systems like a MacPherson strut. Due to the increased number of components within the suspension setup, it takes much longer to service and is heavier than an equivalent MacPherson design. At the other end of the scale, it offers less design choice than the more costly and complex multi-link suspension system.

Introduction to fandom  Trimble's introduction to science fiction fandom was TASFiC, the 1952 Worldcon. She was serving in the United States Navy at Naval Station Great Lakes and happened to see an announcement in Astounding Science Fiction about the upcoming convention that weekend. She met a number of other science fiction enthusiasts, including Robert Bloch, Willy Ley, and August Derleth; and claims that Harlan Ellison, \\"this bespectacled young man who had just sold his first short story\\", \\"decided he liked me and proposed on the spot.\\" (She declined.) When it was discovered that she was an artist and cartoonist, she was recruited to contribute illustrations for science fiction fanzines. Trimble says that she met future husband John Griffin Trimble under Forrest J Ackerman's piano, where several fans had taken refuge during a particularly crowded party. \\"John was in the Air Force, so he and I traded Stupid Office Stories and discovered we liked each other a lot.\\"  Fan activities  Trimble helped revive a flagging Los Angeles Science Fiction Society (LASFS) in the late 1950s. In 1958, she put together the \\"Worldcon Futuristic Fashion Show\\" at Solacon, the 1958 16th World Science Fiction Convention. She ran once again in 1966 at Tricon, the 24th Worldcon, incidentally giving fandom a glimpse of three early Star Trek costumes. Trimble started and directed \\"Project Art Show\\", the first modern convention art show, in 1960. The success of Project Art Show led to art shows becoming a profitable part of most conventions, large and small. The Trimbles were part of the successful \\"Save Star Trek\\" campaign, generally credited with allowing the series to run for a third season rather than being canceled after two. They also helped with the campaign to have the first of NASA's space shuttles named Enterprise. Their efforts earned them uncredited roles as a crew members in Star Trek: The Motion Picture, along with a contingent of other members of fandom who were allowed to serve as extras in full costume, portraying crew members (both human and alien) in the Recreation Deck scene (at the time, the largest number of persons ever appearing in a single Star Trek scene). Her other film credits include makeup design for Flesh Gordon; and a role as 'Ma Cant,' a satirical version of Superman's Martha Kent, in a film short called Superbman: The Other Movie. Trimble contributed to the first encyclopedic collection of data for Star Trek, the Star Trek Concordance, which contains cross-referenced details on every character, setting, event and device in every episode of the original Star Trek, its animated incarnation and, in later editions of the book, the Star Trek films. The first edition of the book was self-published in 1969, followed by a supplement in 1973 and a mass-market printing in 1976 by Ballantine Books; the work was subsequently updated for a new edition published by Citadel Press in 1995. According to former Trek archivist Richard Arnold, the Concordance was used as a primary source of official canon by writers of the Star Trek Universe when he first started working at Paramount. In 1982, Trimble published a memoir of her experiences in Star Trek fandom entitled On the Good Ship Enterprise: My 15 Years with Star Trek. In 1974, Trimble was among the first group of winners of the Inkpot Award by Comic-Con International. Trimble received the Big Heart Award in 1964 , and (in her persona of Flavia Beatrice Carmigniani) the Society for Creative Anachronism's Order of the Laurel, an art award. Bjo and John are also both members of the SCA's Order of the Pelican for service. (She and John were Baron and Baroness of the SCA's Barony of the Angels [Los Angeles Chapter of the SCA] from September 2008 until January 2012.) She also received the International Costumers Guild's Lifetime Achievement award. Trimble was Guest of Honor at 1995's DragonCon, the 6th North American Science Fiction Convention, as well as at many other science fiction and Star Trek conventions around the world. Bjo and John Trimble were the Fan Guests of Honor at the 60th Worldcon, ConJosé.

Publisher:Ordnance Survey – Southampton A2 edition. Publishing Date:2008. on the busy A14 trunk road between Bury St Edmunds to the west and Ipswich to the southeast. The town is on the main railway line between London and Norwich, and lies on the River Gipping, which is joined by its tributary, the River Rat, to the south of the town. The town takes its name from the Old English word stōw meaning \\"principal place\\", and was granted a market charter in 1347 by Edward III. A bi-weekly market is still held there today on Thursday and Saturday. The population of the town has increased from around 6,000 in 1981 to its current level of around 19,000, with considerable further development planned for the town and surrounding villages as part of an area action plan. It is the largest town in the Mid Suffolk district and is represented in parliament by the MP for Bury St Edmunds, currently Jo Churchill. Historic events Disaster struck Stowmarket on 11 August 1871, when an explosion at a local gun cotton factory claimed twenty-eight lives and left seventy five injured. The site of the explosion is now home to a large paint factory. In 1909 Stowmarket High School was founded. On the 8 June 1918 the first UK astronomical observation of nova V603 Aquilae was made from Stowmarket by A. Grace Cook. History repeated itself on 13 December 1934 when amateur astronomer J. P. M. Prentice discovered DQ Herculis from the town. Just before midday on Friday 31 January 1941, a solitary German bomber plane (eyewitness accounts differ on the model) was spotted over Stowmarket firing its guns. The bomber strafed a large area of the town, before dropping bombs onto the high street. The Stowmarket Congregational Chapel, a gothic style building that was built in the 19th century, was completely destroyed. There was only one casualty, Mrs Rhoda Farrow, who had just returned from seeing her son Ronald and his fiancee off at the railway station. On 17 July 2002, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, visited Stowmarket during the Golden Jubilee Celebrations. This was the Queen's second visit to Stowmarket, having first visited the town not long into her reign as Queen in July 1961. During the visit, Her Majesty and Prince Philip visited the local market, meeting stall holders before the Queen unveiled a new Town Sign and met representatives from local organisations while the Duke of Edinburgh met students who took part in The Duke of Edinburgh's Award and viewed a display at the Museum of East Anglian Life. Landmarks Church of St Peter and St Mary The church of St Peter and St Mary is in the Decorated style and dates to the 14th century. The 16th-century former vicarage, now the town council offices and register office, has associations with John Milton; Milton’s Tree in its grounds is believed to be an offshoot of one of the many trees he planted there. Haughley Park is an historical house of significance listed in the English Heritage Register. It is a large red brick country house built in about 1620 for the Sulyard family who were very prominent landowners in this area. Opened in 1967, the Museum of East Anglian Life occupies a site close to the town centre. The Karnser is a raised pavement in Station Road West, next to the church. The name is the East Anglian dialect word caunsey, meaning a causey (causeway). Transportation Station from the front In the 18th century the Gipping was made navigable between Stowmarket and Ipswich by a series of locks. The newly created canal was known as the Ipswich and Stowmarket Navigation. Stowmarket railway station, on the Great Eastern Main Line, is served by numerous train services operated by Greater Anglia: Peterbrough to Ipswich (via Ely, Bury St Edmunds and Stowmarket); Cambridge to Ipswich (via Newmarket, Bury St Edmunds, Stowmarket and Needham Market); and Norwich to London Liverpool Street (via Diss / Ipswich / Colchester / Chelmsford / Stratford). Suffolk County Council has built a road from the Central Roundabout, a short distance to the east of Stowmarket, to Gipping Way in central Stowmarket at a cost of £21 million. The scheme was completed in summer 2010. The new road bridges the railway line and the River Gipping. Governance Stowmarket Town Council is the first tier of local government for Stowmarket in Suffolk. Formed in 1974 from the Stowmarket Urban District Council, the Town Council serves a population of approximately 20,000 people in four wards. It is made up of 16 elected members backed up by a staff of over 30. The council is located in the historic Milton House. Stowmarket is also home to Babergh and Mid Suffolk District Council offices. Sport and leisure John Peel Centre Centre for Creative Arts, formerly the corn exchange Stowmarket has a non-League football club Stowmarket Town F.C., which plays at Greens Meadow. There is also a rugby club located at Chilton Fields, to the north of the town. Stowmarket is home to a handful of gyms and also boasts its own leisure centre complete with swimming pools, climbing wall, bowls green, gym, and artificial-turf football pitch. The town has a plethora of grassroots clubs playing a multitude of sports, many feature on Stowmarket Sport. The Regal Theatre Cinema has been in operation in the town centre for more than fifty years, offering films, concerts and theatre productions. The former Corn Exchange underwent a £1 million refurbishment in 2012 to become a music venue, art gallery and theatre named the John Peel Centre for Creative Arts. It is named after the late influential DJ and broadcaster who lived just outside the town.. Climate Stowmarket has a maritime climate type as is typical for the bulk of the British Isles. Wattisham is the nearest official weather station, about 4 miles south south west of Stowmarket Town centre. The absolute maximum temperature recorded was 35.3c (95.5f) during the August 2003 heatwave. In an average year 11.9 days will report a temperature of 25.1c (77.2f) or above, with the warmest day of the year rising to 29.0c (84.2f). The absolute minimum temperature is −14.6c (5.7f), set in January 1979, although given online records only date back to 1960; it is likely the winter of 1947 saw lower temperatures. In an average year, 48.3 air frosts can be expected. Sunshine, averaging over 1635 hours a year, is amongst the highest for inland areas of Britain. Annual rainfall totals average below 575mm, with over 1mm of rain falling on 109.4 days. All averages refer to the observation period 1971–2000. Stowmarket today Stowmarket has held an annual carnival for well over 50 years in the recreation park featuring a fun fair, fireworks, a procession through the town and local entertainment. Stowmarket also plays host to the music festival Stow-Fest, a live music open-air event that takes place annually at Chilton Fields in the North of Stowmarket. Since 2010 the town has hosted the Stowblues Festival, organised in partnership with BBC Radio Suffolk. Notable residents The poet John Milton made regular visits to the town as his tutor, Dr Thomas Young, became vicar of Stowmarket in 1628. Other notable residents included political writer William Godwin, who spent time as minister at the Stowmarket Independent Church; and singer / West End actress, Kerry Ellis, who was brought up in the nearby village of Haughley and attended Stowmarket's High School. Delia Smith also resides nearby in Combs. Stow has produced a professional footballer, James Scowcroft who played for the local junior sides and Ipswich Town. Professional wrestler Neil Faith has lived in Stowmarket. As well as poet George Crabbe, who went to school in the town. The amateur astronomers A. Grace Cook and J. P. M. Prentice lived in the town. Former MP Gareth Snell is from Stowmarket. Murder victim Matthew Pyke grew up in this town.

He left home at 18 determined to write for a living. He took up residence in Bloomsbury, where he would live for the rest of his life. Early career Brome began his career as a journalist and magazine editor, his first short story anthology was published in 1936. Having been declared unfit for active duty, he worked for the British Ministry of Information during World War II. After the war Brome worked under Michael Young as a Labour Party researcher. Literary career Following the electoral success of the Labour Party in 1945, Brome turned his hand to biography writing. Fittingly, his first subject was the new Prime Minister: Clement Attlee. He went on to receive some critical and commercial success with his second work, H.G. Wells in 1950. Brome went on to chronicle the lives of such men as Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Frank Harris, J. B. Priestley, and Havelock Ellis to wide acclaim. Two of his literary works, The Surgeon and The Embassy, were international bestsellers. However, his works were not always treated so kindly by critics; his biography of Aneurin Bevan was particularly poorly received. Brome was a regular at the British Library, and was a member of its advisory committee from 1975 until 1982. He was a vocal supporter of the library's move from the British Museum to its own purpose built building in St. Pancras, even writing numerous letters to such organs as The Times and the Times Literary Supplement praising the move. At the time of his death Brome still occupied the third story flat he had lived in for fifty years despite growing frailty and deafness.

Greene continues directing the organisation. In addition, she also directs CPA Press, a publishing company that focuses on specialist astrological works. Greene has been one of the most consistently popular astrologers of the 20th century. Almost all of her many books remain in print. Greene became quickly famous with the publication, by Weiser, of Saturn: A New Look at an Old Devil, in 1976, in which she applied Jungian psychology to revise the image of Saturn as a planet of misfortune, recasting it in a more Jungian image that has continued to be very popular into the 21st century. Greene wrote a historical novel in 1980, The Dreamer of the Vine, dealing with the themes of Nostradamus and Jesus bloodline.Transworld Publishers Limited, 1982. . Her remaining books have been on topics applying principles of psychoanalysis to astrology (Psychological astrology). Many are transcripts of her lectures, and many are co-authored, especially with Howard Sasportas. In addition to giving frequent lectures and directing a certificate programme in psychological astrology, Greene has continued to produce many books, all of which are now published by her own company, the CPA Press. She has also co-authored, with Juliet Sharman-Burke, a deck of tarot cards, the Mythic Tarot. Her most influential books include Saturn: A New Look at an Old Devil, and the philosophically-inclined The Astrology of Fate. The Outer Planets & Their Cycles, The Luminaries (with H. Sasportas) and The Dark of the Soul are other examples of her work.

It is typically used on the rear axle of a motor vehicle. A leading arm, as used on the Citroën 2CV and the M422 Mighty Mite, has an arm connected between (and perpendicular to, and to the rear of) the axle and the chassis. It is used on the front axle.  Types   Trailing- arm  Trailing-arm designs in live axle setups often use just two or three links and a Panhard rod to locate the wheel laterally. A trailing arm design can also be used in an independent suspension arrangement. Each wheel hub is located only by a large, roughly triangular arm that pivots at one point, ahead of the wheel. Seen from the side, this arm is roughly parallel to the ground, with the angle changing based on road irregularities. A twist-beam rear suspension is very similar except that the arms are connected by a beam, used to locate the wheels and which twists and has an anti-roll effect. Some aircraft also use trailing arms in their landing gear, with oleo struts for shock absorption. A trailing arm landing gear results in smoother landings and a better ride when taxiing compared to other types of landing gear.  Semi- trailing arm  A semi-trailing arm suspension is a supple independent rear suspension system for automobiles where each wheel hub is located only by a large, roughly triangular arm that pivots at two points. Viewed from the top, the line formed by the two pivots is somewhere between parallel and perpendicular to the car's longitudinal axis; it is generally parallel to the ground. Trailing-arm and multilink suspension designs are much more commonly used for the rear wheels of a vehicle where they can allow for a flatter floor and more cargo room. Many small, front-wheel drive vehicles feature a MacPherson strut front suspension and trailing-arm rear axle.

Information from the Star Trek \\"Expanded Universe\\" typically fills \\"holes\\" in the Star Trek story and timeline, with explanations of events which have never been adequately explained through live action productions. The term was first used in 1966 by writer D.C. Fontana to describe information put forth in the backstory of Doctor Leonard McCoy. Although original Star Trek fiction (for adult audiences) dates back to James Blish's 1970 novel Spock Must Die!, published by Bantam Books, the publishing company Simon & Schuster is most directly responsible for contributing to the Star Trek Expanded Universe through its license with Pocket Books which has generated many Star Trek novels over the past twenty-five years. Information in the novels, while sometime contradictory, often serves to provide information to the Star Trek Expanded Universe. The term \\"Star Trek Expanded Universe\\" is not an official usage of Paramount Pictures, Simon & Schuster, or any other Star Trek licensee. The term is occasionally used within fandom by analogy with the Star Wars expanded universe as defined by Lucasfilm. However, the policies and practices pertaining to licensed Star Trek fiction are not identical to those used by Lucasfilm. For example, unlike in Star Wars fiction, there is no overall effort among the various licensees to integrate all Star Trek fiction into a single continuity. Although the majority of Star Trek novels in recent years have been written to be consistent with one another and with certain Star Trek comic books, they remain incompatible with many earlier novels and comics, and occasionally with contemporary novels as well. Many of these premises have been accepted by Star Trek fans as being canon, even though Paramount Pictures, owners of the Star Trek franchise, considers only live-action television and film productions to be canon. This has led to conflict on occasion when a TV episode or film contradicts well-established Expanded Universe backstory (most notably in the case of the prequel series, Star Trek: Enterprise). Expanded premises * Leonard McCoy's Backstory: Leonard McCoy was married shortly before obtaining his medical degree. Starting a private practice, McCoy fathered a daughter before being divorced by his wife and losing custody of his child. Sometime after 2260, he closed his medical practice and accepted a staff officer's commission in Starfleet to escape the pain of losing his wife and daughter. * Second Five Year Voyage of the USS Enterprise: Following the events of Star Trek: The Motion Picture the Enterprise embarked on a second five-year mission of exploration. James T. Kirk did not regain his rank of rear admiral but chose to remain a captain to command the Enterprise. The aborted television series Star Trek: Phase II was to have been set during this second five-year mission, and there remains a \\"gap\\" between the first and second Trek feature films that suggests such a mission might have occurred, though this has never been confirmed in any canonical resource. Stories that are set in this timeframe do not necessarily conform to any known episode storyline that was planned for Phase II. * Chekov's Promotion History and Later Life: Ensign Chekov was promoted to lieutenant junior grade at the conclusion of the first five-year voyage of the Enterprise. By 2271, he was a full lieutenant. He obtained the rank of lieutenant commander during the second five-year voyage of the Enterprise and, in 2276, was promoted to commander and assigned as the executive officer of the USS Reliant. He appeared apparently as a retired commander in Star Trek Generations, but later novels and fan sources from Star Trek: The Next Generation indicate that he eventually became an admiral. Walter Koenig also has been quoted as saying at science fiction conventions that he speculates often if Chekov is in some way related to Worf's adoptive Russian parents. *Physical Appearance of the Romulans: The ruling class Romulans of the 23rd century were referred to unofficially as Romulans of the \\"Smooth Brow\\". These Romulans were direct descendants of the original Vulcan dissidents that left Vulcan circa AD 1 (Earth Calendar). By the mid-24th century, the Smooth Brow Romulans had lost most of the power on Romulans to be replaced by standard Romulans who, through centuries of inbreeding and off-world marriages, had developed very pronounced forehead ridges. These Romulans occupied most positions of power in the 24th century government and military; however, the Romulans of the Smooth Brow could still be found in the public light. Commander Sela, a Romulan-Human cross, was often mistaken by fellow Romulans as a Smooth Brow. Ambassador Spock was also able to infiltrate Romulan society by posing as a Smooth Brow Romulan. *The Riker-Troi Romance Backstory: Although various hints have appeared in sundry Next Generation episodes, only the novel Imzadi actually told the whole story of how Riker and Troi originally met and fell in love - and of what came between them. *Further Adventures of the Deep Space Nine crew: After the disappearance of Benjamin Sisko and the conclusion of the war with the Dominion, the planet Bajor joins the Federation. Kira Nerys is given permanent command of the station and a Starfleet commission of captain. Many new crew members join DS9, including Elias Vaughn (the station's new executive officer, and commander of the Defiant), Ensign Thirishar ch'Thane (the new Andorian science officer), Lieutenant Sam Bowers (tactical), and others. Sisko eventually returns to corporeal existence and moves with his family to Bajor. (See Deep Space Nine relaunch for further information.) * James T. Kirk's resurrection: Shortly after Star Trek Generations, William Shatner and co-writers Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens wrote a series of novels taking place after the events in the movie, bringing James T. Kirk back from the dead, much like mainstream comic books. While the novels are not mentioned in regular continuity, they are often read by fans who felt Kirk had died an \\"unheroic\\" death and deserved something more. Many fans accept these novels into their own fanon continuity (or at least choose to accept The Return only, the most important and commercially successful of the novels). In these, Kirk is venturing in the 24th century, while falling in love again, having a child, getting along with Spock, Leonard McCoy and, also temporally misplaced, Scotty, while also getting himself into new adventures with them, and developing a nice friendship with Jean Luc Picard. They even take a vacation trip together, in The Captain's Peril, shortly after the Dominion War's end, a few months prior to Star Trek: Nemesis. Critics cite an overdone focus on Kirk as the glorified hero, often leaving Picard and others in downplayed roles. These novels, which are not considered part of the overall continuity of the other Star Trek novels, are collectively referred to by fans as the \\"Shatnerverse.\\" Star Trek: New Voyages, also uses the idea of Kirk living on in that both released episodes feature possible futures, The pilot \\"Come What May\\" features a scene where Kirk sees his possible future. This includes most of the more famous movie scenes (Spock's death, and parts of Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country) and then Spock speaking the works \\"Captain Kirk is alive\\" just after a repeat of Kirk's last line in Generations. In addition episode one (\\"In Harm's Way\\") features Kirk and Spock traveling back in time to help their younger selves; the year they come from is given as 2373, or two years after Kirk's \\"death\\" (and roughly the time period Shatner's third novel Avenger gives for Kirk's reappearance on the Galactic stage). * Charles 'Trip' Tucker's life: In \\"These Are The Voyages...\\", the final episode of Star Trek: Enterprise, Charles 'Trip' Tucker is apparently killed defending his ship against alien pirates. The latest Enterprise novel, Last Full Measure, revealed in its final scenes that Trip actually survived the attack and lived on after the events of this episode. It is unknown at present how Trip survived, who ordered that his death be faked, or why. The Enterprise novels are currently undergoing a relaunch similar to that of DS9, so it is possible that these questions may be answered. Disproved premises *Physical Appearance of the Klingons: The marked difference in the physical characteristics of the Klingons, as seen in Star Trek: The Original Series and in later feature films and television productions, was first explained as the result of a genetic engineering experiment which took place approximately between the year 2210 and 2270. In an attempt to emulate humans, and make infiltration in human regions of space easier, the Klingon Empire merged human DNA with a large segment of its military force. The result was the \\"Klingon- Human Fusions\\" who were the only Klingons permitted to have contact with the Federation. By 2271, this attempt at creating Klingon-Human Fusions had been abandoned and the Empire abolished the project. Certain high ranking Klingons (such as Kor, Koloth and Kang) were permitted to undergo procedures to remove the human DNA from their cell structures and revert to a pure Klingon appearance. To this day, the Klingon Empire considers the attempts at creating Klingon-Human Fusions to have been an embarrassment and it is \\"not discussed\\" with outsiders. An alternate explanation was offered in the DC Comics graphic novel, Debt of Honor which suggested the ridged Klingons were a different race than the human-like Klingons, which had suffered discommodation at some point. In a two-part episode of Star Trek: Enterprise, aired in 2005 as \\"Affliction\\" and \\"Divergence\\", this premise was disproved and it was revealed that the change in Klingon appearance was the result of a virus that resulted from military enhancement experiments. Presumably a cure was found for the condition (which was passed from generation to generation) sometime prior to Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Dr. Antaak had one line toward the end of \\"Divergence\\" stating that perhaps he could specialize in cosmetic surgery. This would explain how Kor, Koloth and Kang changed their appearance from smooth brow in The Original Series to cranial ridges in DS9. (The DC Comics premise was disproved much earlier by the appearance of Kor, Koloth and Kang (now with ridges) in the DS9 episode \\"Blood Oath\\"). *Klingon Society: FASA Corporation's 1980s Star Trek role-playing game and supplements greatly expanded on Klingon society, enlisting the aid of the late Star Trek novelist John M. Ford. The version of the Klingon society in the 2260s was that of a paranoid society of both \\"human-fusion\\" and \\"Imperial Klingons\\", complete with sophisticated nomenclatures, a Klingon Emperor, \\"thought admirals\\" and an afterlife known as the \\"Black Fleet.\\" The home planet was known as \\"Klinzhai\\". Most of these ideas were superseded in several episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation (and subsequent productions) which established the Klingon homeworld as \\"Qo'nos\\" (also spelled \\"Kronos\\") and the Klingon afterlife as Stovokor. Flag ranks in the Klingon fleet have been established (post-FASA) as both generals (such as Martok from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine) and admirals (Star Trek: Enterprise). The Animated Series Star Trek: The Animated Series (TAS) was a 22 episode set of animated adventures of the Enterprise crew, which aired originally on NBC from 1973-1974. It featured the reappearance of popular characters from the original series, including Harry Mudd and Cyrano Jones, and speculates on what happened to them after they were last seen in live-action. Some Star Trek novels and comics have utilized characters that were only ever seen in the animated series, most notably Arex and M'Ress. It has been suggested by fans that these stories took place during the fourth or fifth year of Kirk's original \\"five-year mission.\\" Arguably, the most-debated element of TAS is the introduction of Robert April as the first captain of the Enterprise NCC-1701. Canon status From the show's debut up until the end of the first season of Star Trek: The Next Generation, TAS was considered part of Star Trek canon. Then, from the end of the first season of Star Trek: The Next Generation on May 16, 1988 (when all licenses for Star Trek spin-off fiction were renegotiated) up to June 27, 2007, TAS was \\"decanonized\\". However, on June 27, 2007, Star Treks official website incorporated information from TAS into its library, recanonizing it.

Early life and career Born at Goldsboro, North Carolina, Washington was appointed to the United States Naval Academy on 17 May 1883. He graduated on 10 June 1887 and, after the required two years of sea duty during which he served on the European Station in the sloops and , was commissioned ensign in 1889. Over the ensuing three years, he briefly served in U.S. Coast Survey Ship Endeavor, followed by a tour in the gunboat to the far east. He was assigned to the office of the Navy's Judge Advocate General in 1892. Subsequently, after duty on several trial boards for general courts martial at the Norfolk and Washington Navy Yards, he was assigned to a succession of ships—, and —before joining the battleship in early 1898. He was on this ship when she helped to defeat the Spanish Fleet under Admiral Cervera on 3 July 1898 in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba. His younger brother and naval cadet, Pope Washington, was one of the survivors of the explosion of the Maine. After a second tour of duty ashore in the office of the Judge Advocate General, Washington served on the General Board. Ordered thence to the Asiatic Station, he joined the staff of Rear Admiral Robley D. \\"Fighting Bob\\" Evans, the Commander-in-Chief, Asiatic Fleet, on 29 October 1902. Quartered on the battleship , the Asiatic Fleet's flagship, he remained on Evans' staff until detached on 1 June 1904. Special duty at the Bureau of Navigation followed his return from the Orient and preceded his assuming command of dispatch boat , the vessel which was then serving as the Secretary of the Navy's yacht. Washington next put in another tour with the Bureau of Navigation for duty before returning to sea in 1912 to command, in turn, the gunboat and cruisers and over the next two years. World War I On 20 April 1914, Washington—by then a captain—assumed the duties of Hydrographer of the Navy. World War I broke out in Europe less than four months after Washington assumed the Hydrographer's duties, depriving the United States of its external sources of oceanographic and hydrographic information. Washington and his small staff responded by independently gathering the necessary data for use by the United States Navy and Merchant Marine. Relieved as hydrographer on 23 June 1916, Washington was given command of the battleship . A few months after the United States entered the war in the spring of 1917, Florida crossed the Atlantic with Battleship Division Nine to operate with the British Grand Fleet. The manner in which he carried out this assignment won Washington the Distinguished Service Medal for \\"exceptionally meritorious service in a duty of great responsibility.\\" Post-war service On 22 November 1918, eleven days after the Armistice, he assumed command of Flagship Division 3, Battleship Force 1, Atlantic Fleet, flying his \\"flag\\" alternately in yachts and . He subsequently commanded Divisions 2 and 4, successively, of the Atlantic Fleet. Detached from this duty on 9 August, he assumed the post of Chief of the Bureau of Navigation on 11 August, with the accompanying rank of rear admiral. Less than a year later, Washington received orders to duty as Commander-in-Chief, Asiatic Fleet (CINCAF). He broke his flag in armored cruiser on 11 October 1923 and commanded the Fleet until 14 October 1925. During his tour, the Asiatic Fleet provided support for the United States Army's round-the-world flight in the spring of 1924. Operating from the Kurils to Calcutta, the destroyer squadrons of the Fleet sailed on plane-guard stations, transported supplies and spare parts, and provided radio bearings and communications services for the planes, and thus contributed greatly to the success of the flight. Relieved as CINCAF on 14 October 1925, Washington became Commandant of the Naval Operating Base, San Francisco, California, on 19 November 1925, and filled the billet until his retirement on 6 June 1929. Last years and legacy In the 1930s Washington was the Governor of the Philadelphia Naval Home. Advanced on the retired list to the full rank of admiral on 16 July 1942, Washington died at the Bethesda Naval Hospital, Bethesda, Maryland on December 15, 1954. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery Arlington, Virginia and his grave can be found in section 3, site 1738. Namesake * The oceanographic research ship was named for him.

POS is defined by RFC 2615 as PPP over SONET/SDH. PPP is the Point to Point Protocol that was designed as a standard method of communicating over point-to-point links. Since SONET/SDH uses point-to-point circuits, PPP is well suited for use over these links. Scrambling is performed during insertion of the PPP packets into the SONET/SDH frame to solve various security attacks including denial-of-service attacks and the imitation of SONET/SDH alarms. This modification was justified as cost-effective because the scrambling algorithm was already used by the standard used to transport ATM cells over SONET/SDH. However, scrambling can optionally be disabled to allow a node to be compatible with another node that uses the now obsoleted RFC 1619 version of Packet over SONET/SDH which lacks the scrambler. Applications of POS The most important application of POS is to support sending of IP packets across Wide Area Networks. Large amounts of traffic on the Internet are carried over POS links. POS is also one of the link layers used by the Resilient Packet Ring standard known as IEEE 802.17. History of POS Cisco was involved in making POS an important Wide Area Network protocol. PMC-Sierra produced an important series of early semiconductor devices which implemented POS. Details about the name \\"POS\\" POS (packet over SONET) is a double-nested abbreviation. The S represents \\"SONET/SDH\\", which itself stands for \\"Synchronous Optical Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy\\". Given this information, POS technically stands for \\"Packet over Synchronous Optical Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy\\". Complementary Interfaces The System Packet Interface series of standards from the Optical Internetworking Forum including SPI-4.2 and SPI-3 and their predecessors PL-4 and PL-3 are commonly used as the interface between packet processing devices and framer devices that implement POS.

Everyone plays for themselves. It is a compendium game of 11 rounds, each of which has its own goal. The aim of the game is to score as few penalty points as possible. The player who scores the fewest points is declared the winner. Object Bonken is fundamentally a trick-taking game with the exception of the Domino contract. A trick is taken by the player who played the highest card of the led suit or, if applicable, the one who played the highest trump. The card rankings are as usual, the Ace being high and 2 low. Players are obliged to follow suit if able to do so. If there are trumps, a player is allowed (not required) to play a trump if he cannot follow suit. Gameplay One of the players starts as dealer and shuffles the deck. After this, he deals every player 13 cards. The cards are dealt clockwise. The player who sits across the table from the dealer can choose which of the rounds is played. He is not allowed to choose a round that has already been played. The player to the right of the dealer starts doubling. After the descriptions of the rounds is the explanation of doubling. The player on the left of the dealer plays the leading card. After the first trick the player who took that trick plays the next leading card. After each round the cards are shuffled and dealt by the player to the left of the previous dealer. As noted before, each of the rounds has its own goal. Rounds 1st round Ducking (Bukken): the goal is to take the fewest tricks possible. There are no trumps. Each trick taken by a player scores -5 points. 2nd round No Hearts (Hartenjagen): the aim is to avoid capturing hearts in any tricks taken. There are no trumps. A player may not lead with hearts unless he cannot do otherwise. Every heart taken scores -5 points. 3rd round No Men (Herenboeren): the goal is to avoid capturing Kings and Jacks in any tricks taken. There are no trumps. Each King captured scores -20 points and each Jack scores -10 points. 4th round No Queens (Vrouwen): the goal is to avoid capturing Queens in any tricks. There are no trumps. Each Queen captured scores -30 points. 5th round No King of Hearts (Hartenheer): there are no trumps. Players may not lead with hearts unless they cannot do otherwise. The player who captures the King of Hearts scores -50 points. 6th round No Last (Laatste slag): there are no trumps. The player who takes the last trick scores -50 points. 7th round Domino (Domino): cards are laid to the table. When on lead, a player must lay either and Eight or a card one rank higher or lower than a table card (e.g. a 6 of diamonds may be laid off against a 7 of diamonds, but not the 7 of spades or 8 of diamonds). Players may only pass if unable to do either. The player who is last out scores -50 points. 8th to 11th round Trumps (Troeven): every player is allowed to choose trumps for the round once. The player may choose what a trump suit is or to play with no trumps. A player may not choose a suit that has already been chosen. Each trick won scores 10 points. Note that only 4 out of 5 options are played. Doubling Before the chosen round is played all players have the opportunity to double. The player to the right of the dealer may begin doubling. If a player doubles another, the difference in point obtained in that round will be added to his point total and subtracted from the other players total. If a player doubles a player and that player doubles back, the difference is accounted twice. The person who chose the round can only double back, that is, he cannot double players who haven't doubled him. If the points are divided correctly, the sum of the final scores of all four player will be 0, even if players have doubled during the game.

The Ford Model T used a inline 4-cylinder engine. It was primarily a gasoline engine. It produced for a top speed of . It was built in-unit with the Model T's novel transmission (a planetary design), sharing the same lubricating oil. The T engine was known for its simplicity, reliability, and economy. The engine remained in production for many years, and millions of units were produced. The engine design's lifespan exceeded that of the Model T vehicle itself, with industrial, marine, and military applications extending its production run. The T engine is on the Ward's 10 Best Engines of the 20th Century list. Fuel choices and fuel economy The T engine was built as a gasoline engine. While not engineered specifically for multifuel ability, its simple, robust design allowed it to successfully run on a variety of combustible fuels including benzene, ethanol, or, with various available after-market attachments, kerosene. According to Ford Motor Company, the Model T had fuel economy on the order of . Carburetor and fuel system Cutaway view of the fuel system for the Ford Model T engine, showing the gravity-feed fuel supply, carburetor cutaway, and intake stream.. The T engine had one carburetor, a side-draft, single-venturi unit. Its choke and throttle valves were controlled manually; the latter was with a hand lever rather than a foot pedal. The carburetor had no accelerator pump. Various vendors supplied Ford with carburetors for the T engine, including Holley, Zenith, and Kingston. During most of the T's production run, its fuel tank was mounted to the frame beneath the front seat. Because Ford relied on gravity to feed fuel to the carburetor rather than a fuel pump, a Model T could not climb a steep hill when the fuel level was low. The immediate solution was to climb steep hills in reverse. In 1926, the fuel tank was moved forward and upward, under the cowl, on most models, which improved the gravity feed. Internal design Cutaway internal view of Ford Model T engine.. The T engine was an inline-four, with all four cylinders cast into one engine block. Such monobloc design was an uncommon practice when T production started in 1908. It lent itself to mass production, showing the Ford company's prescient focus on design for manufacturability. The head, however, was detachable, which not only aided Ford in manufacturing but also made valve jobs (cleaning, grinding, or replacement of the poppet valves) easier. The block and head were both of cast iron. The engine's bore was and its stroke was even, for a total displacement of . The compression ratio was 3.98 for most engines; early engines were slightly greater. This value is low by modern standards but was typical for the era, making the engine forgiving of poor-quality, low-octane fuel and minimizing cranking effort at starting. The valvetrain was a side valve (flathead) design. The crankshaft had 3 main bearings. Cooling system thermosyphon cooling system of the Ford Model T engine.. The T engine's cooling system reflected the T's simplicity design theme. The first few hundred Model Ts had a water pump, but it was eliminated early in production. Instead, Ford opted for a cheaper and more reliable thermosyphon system. Thermosyphon was a common engine-cooling method of the era. Hot water, being less dense, would rise to the top of the engine and up into the top of the radiator, descending to the bottom as it cooled, and back into the engine. (This was the direction of water flow in most cars which did have water pumps, until the introduction of crossflow radiator designs.) The thermosiphon system was susceptible to overheating if worked heavily, but served well for most Model T usage. Many types of water pumps were available as aftermarket accessories. Ignition system Overview of the ignition system of the Ford Model T engine.. The Model T engine's ignition system used a flywheel-mounted magneto to produce the current necessary to produce a spark to initiate combustion. This current was distributed by the timer (analogous to a distributor in a modern vehicle) to one of the four trembler coils, one for each cylinder. The coil stepped up the voltage and discharged it to the spark plug in the cylinder. Ignition timing was adjusted manually by using the spark advance lever mounted on the steering column, which rotated the timer, advancing or retarding the ignition timing. A certain amount of skill and experience was required to find the optimal spark timing for any speed and load. The magneto was the first Model T component to be assembled on an assembly line, and the method was copied to many other Model T production segments. The ignition system of the Fordson tractor was similar to the Model T's. Starting, lights, and electrical system beyond ignition When electric headlights were introduced in 1915, the magneto was upgraded to supply enough power for the lights and horn. In the early years of Model T production, all Ts were started with a hand crank. A battery could be used to supply ignition current for starting, since it could be difficult to hand-crank a very cold engine fast enough for the magneto to produce sufficient current. However, although all T's had a \\"BAT\\" position (\\"battery\\") on the coil box switch and a corresponding terminal on the box, Ford did not supply or even encourage the use of a battery before 1919, when it introduced a battery-driven electric starter. Even this was not standard equipment for all models until sometime in 1926, the last year of production. Most cars sold after 1919 were equipped with this starter, which was engaged by a small round foot-operated button switch on the floor. These cars included a battery and a generator for recharging it, and this system also powered the lights. (Cars sold without the system continued to use magneto-powered lights.) In keeping with the goal of ultimate reliability and simplicity, the trembler coil and magneto ignition system was retained even on cars with the starter system. Operation Overhead views of Ford Model T engine, with the head removed in one view.. Operating the T engine was not difficult after some experience, although the learning curve was longer than today's. The various manual control tasks (such as manual choke and spark advance) and the method of use (such as hand throttle) were typical for automobiles of the era, although they might seem more like farm tractor operation to most automobile drivers of today. Before starting a Model T with the hand crank, the spark had to be manually retarded or the engine might \\"kick back\\". The crank handle was cupped in the palm, with the thumb tucked under the handle (not clasped over top of it), so that if the engine did kick back, the rapid reverse motion of the crank would throw the hand away from the handle, rather than violently twisting the wrist or breaking the thumb. Most Model T Fords had the choke operated by a wire emerging from the bottom of the radiator where it could be operated with the left hand. This was used to prime the engine while cranking the engine slowly; then the engine was started with a rapid pull of the crank handle. In good tune, an already-primed T engine only has to be cranked half a turn for it to successfully start. The T's planetary transmission is famous for its differences from what later became the norm for car transmission operation. The 3 foot pedals are not used in the way later cars use their pedals. Operation is not difficult but requires \\"unlearning\\" habits used with later vehicles. Design changes over the years The following major changes were made (listed by year): * 1909 -- First model year - Water pump was discontinued; subsequent Model T engines used thermosyphoning to circulate the coolant. * 1911 -- Valve covers were added * 1917 -- Higher head with larger water jacket * 1919 -- Engine starter introduced as an option * 1920 -- Lighter-weight rods and pistons * 1922 -- The cylinder casting was changed so a single valve cover could be used * 1926 -- An extra boss was added at the rear for two additional bolts stiffening the transmission, * 1927 -- The carburetor throttle rod was re-routed over the engine Production run The T engine was produced continuously from September 27, 1908, through August 4, 1941, exactly 12,000 days. This makes it one of the longest engines in series production, especially considering that the specifications remained mostly unchanged for this entire duration. Its production run for the U.S. consumer market for passenger cars and pickups was shorter, being the 19 years' production run of the Model T itself for that market (1908 to 1927). But the engine continued to be produced and sold to various consumer, industrial, military, and marine markets throughout the world until 1941.

In 1961, Lupoff wrote an article for Comic Art about the launch of Xero and his focus on comics: :The night of the costume ball, Pat and I showed up in our costumes: hastily devised Captain Marvel and Mary Marvel outfits. Mine was made from a set of long underwear, and hers was nothing but a man’s red T-shirt emblazoned with felt lightning, plus a yellow sash. They were extremely popular costumes. Everyone from Doc Smith on down wanted to take our pictures. Why?… The only conclusion that can be drawn is that it was not us, nor our costumes themselves, that were popular. It was Captain Marvel and Mary Marvel, momentarily embodied in us, that drew the admiration and applause... Further, \\"All in Color\\" has been the most letter-provoking feature of Xero, numerous people have requested copies, specifying that their motive is to obtain the comics articles, and if all the authors currently committed to write for the series come through with articles, the series will run well into 1962 before material runs out.Thompson, Maggie. \\"Was 1960 Comic Book Time?\\" Comics Buyers Guide, November 2010. In subsequent issues, the articles and letter columns often featured well-known contributors: Dan Adkins, Otto Binder, James Blish, Anthony Boucher, Algis Budrys, Lin Carter, Avram Davidson, L. Sprague de Camp, Roger Ebert, Harlan Ellison, Ed Gorman, Ron Haydock, Roy Krenkel, Frederik Pohl, Larry Shaw, Robert Shea, Steve Stiles, Bob Tucker, Donald E. Westlake, Ted White, Paul Williams and Walt Willis.  Books  The format of Xero imitated Ace Books' Ace Doubles (two novels bound together with cover illustrations on front and back). When Xero was flipped over, it revealed a second cover leading into an article on comic books. These articles were mostly about 1940s superheroes: \\"The Spawn of M.C. Gaines\\" by Ted White; \\"Me To Your Leader Take\\" by Richard Ellington; \\"The Big Red Cheese\\" by Dick Lupoff; \\"The First (arf, arf) Superhero of Them All (Popeye)\\" by Bill Blackbeard; \\"OK, Axis, Here We Come!\\" by Don Thompson; \\"One on All and All on One\\" by Tom Fagan; \\"A Swell Bunch of Guys\\" by Jim Harmon; \\"The Four-Panelled, Sock-Bang-Powie Saturday Afternoon Screen\\" by Chris Steinbrunner; \\"Captain Billy's Whiz Gang!\\" by Roy Thomas; \\"The Second Banana Superheroes\\" by Ron Goulart; and \\"Comic of the Absurd\\" by Harlan Ellison. These articles were later collected in the hardcover book All in Color for a Dime (Arlington House, 1970), reprinted in paperback by Ace Books in 1971 and Krause Publications in 1997.Lupoff, Richard A., and Don Thompson. All in Color for a Dime. New Rochelle, N.Y.: Arlington House, 1970. , Other articles and art from Xero were reprinted in The Best of Xero, published by San Francisco's Tachyon Publications in 2004.Lupoff, Pat and Richard A.

San Francisco: Tachyon, 2004. , John Hertz reviewed The Best of Xero in Emerald City: :Davidson, Carter, and Stiles all contributed to Xero; Stiles, who in 2004 was on the Best Fanartist ballot, then drew with a stylus on mimeograph stencils, the technology of the day. Pat & Dick Lupoff typed stencils in their Manhattan apartment, printed them on a machine in Noreen & Larry Shaw’s basement, collated by hand, and lugged the results to SF cons or stuffed them in mailboxes. The machine had not been given by Damon Knight, A. J. Budrys explained in a letter after a while, but lent. Eventually drawings could be scanned by electro-stencil, a higher tech. Colored ink joined colored paper, sometimes wildly colored. Xero could be spectacular. Knight later founded the Science Fiction Writers of America; he and Budrys were each later Writer Guest of Honor at a Worldcon. James Blish won two Retrospective Hugos in 2004; in Xero he reviewed Budrys’ Rogue Moon (not reprinted by Tachyon), and Kingsley Amis’ New Maps of Hell.

The remains of an individual who would have stood about in height were discovered in 2003 at Liang Bua on the island of Flores in Indonesia. Partial skeletons of nine individuals have been recovered, including one complete skull, referred to as \\"LB1\\". These remains have been the subject of intense research to determine whether they represent a species distinct from modern humans; a 2017 study concludes by phylogenetic analysis that H. floresiensis is an early species of homo, a sister species of homo habilis. This hominin was at first considered remarkable for its survival until relatively recent times, initially thought to be only 12,000 years ago. However, more extensive stratigraphic and chronological work has pushed the dating of the most recent evidence of its existence back to 50,000 years ago. The Homo floresiensis skeletal material is now dated from 60,000 to 100,000 years ago; stone tools recovered alongside the skeletal remains were from archaeological horizons ranging from 50,000 to 190,000 years ago. Specimens Discovery Liang Bua Cave, where the specimens were discovered The first specimens were discovered on the Indonesian island of Flores in 2003 by a joint Australian-Indonesian team of archaeologists looking for evidence of the original human migration of modern humans from Asia to Australia. They instead recovered a nearly complete, small-statured skeleton, LB1, in Liang Bua Cave, and subsequent excavations recovered seven additional skeletons, initially dated from 38,000 to 13,000 years ago. LB1 is a fairly complete skeleton, including a nearly complete skull, which belonged to a 30-year-old female, and has been nicknamed \\"Little Lady of Flores\\" or \\"Flo\\". An arm bone provisionally assigned to H. floresiensis is about 74,000 years old. The specimens are not fossilized and have been described as having \\"...the consistency of wet blotting paper.\\" Once exposed, the bones had to be left to dry before they could be dug up.Morwood and van Oosterzee 2007 Skeleton at the Natural History Museum, London Stone implements of a size considered appropriate to these small humans are also widely present in the cave. The implements are at horizons initially dated to 95,000 to 13,000 years ago. Modern humans reached the region by around 50,000 years ago, by which time H. floresiensis is thought to have gone extinct. Comparisons of the stone artefacts with those made by modern humans in East Timor indicate many technological similarities. Scandal over specimen damage In early December 2004, Indonesian paleoanthropologist Teuku Jacob removed most of the remains from their repository, Jakarta's National Research Centre of Archaeology, with the permission of only one of the project team's directors and kept them for three months.Morwood & van Oosterzee (2007) ch. 9 Some scientists expressed the fear that important scientific evidence would be sequestered by a small group of scientists who neither allowed access by other scientists nor published their own research. Jacob returned the remains on 23 February 2005 with portions severely damaged and missing two leg bones to the worldwide consternation of his peers. Reports noted the condition of the returned remains, \\"... [including] long, deep cuts marking the lower edge of the Hobbit's jaw on both sides, said to be caused by a knife used to cut away the rubber mould ... the chin of a second Hobbit jaw was snapped off and glued back together. Whoever was responsible misaligned the pieces and put them at an incorrect angle ... The pelvis was smashed, destroying details that reveal body shape, gait and evolutionary history.\\" and causing the discovery team leader Morwood to remark, \\"It's sickening; Jacob was greedy and acted totally irresponsibly.\\" Jacob, however, denied any wrongdoing. He stated that the damages occurred during transport from Yogyakarta back to Jakarta despite the physical evidence to the contrary that the jawbone had been broken while making a mould of the bones.Morwood & van Oosterzee (2007) ch. 9, pp. 230-231 In 2005, Indonesian officials forbade access to the cave. Some news media, such as the BBC, expressed the opinion that the restriction was to protect Jacob, who was considered \\"Indonesia's king of palaeoanthropology,\\" from being proven wrong. Scientists were allowed to return to the cave in 2007, shortly after Jacob's death. Classification Phylogeny Bust of a H. floresiensis female at the Hall of Human Origins, Smithsonian The discoverers proposed that a variety of features, both primitive and derived, identify these individuals as belonging to a new species, H. floresiensis. Based on previous date estimates, the discoverers also proposed that H. floresiensis lived contemporaneously with modern humans on Flores. Before publication, the discoverers were considering placing LB1 into her own genus, Sundanthropus floresianus (\\"Sunda human from Flores\\"), but reviewers of the article recommended that, despite her size, she should be placed in the genus Homo. Two orthopedic studies published in 2007 reported that the wrist bones were more similar to those of chimps and Australopithecus than to modern humans. However, another 2007 study of the bones and joints of the arm, shoulder, and lower limbs also concluded that H. floresiensis was more similar to early humans and other apes than modern humans.Larson et al. 2007 (preprint online ) A 2009 cladistic analysis concluded H. floresiensis branched off very early from the modern human line, either shortly before or shortly after the evolution of H. habilis 1.96–1.66 million years ago. In 2009, American anthropologist William Jungers and colleagues found that the foot of H. floresiensis has several primitive characters, and that they could be the descendants of a species much earlier than H. erectus. A 2015 Bayesian analysis found greatest similarity with Australopithecus sediba, Homo habilis and the primitive H. erectus georgicus, raising the possibility that the ancestors of H. floresiensis left Africa before the appearance of H. erectus, and were possibly even the first hominins to do so. However, H. floresiensis has several dental similarities to H. erectus, which could mean H. erectus was the ancestor species. Their ancestors may have reached the island by one million years ago. In 2016, fossil teeth and a partial jaw from hominins assumed to be ancestral to H. floresiensis were discovered at Mata Menge, about from Liang Bua. They date to about 700,000 years ago and are noted by Australian archaeologist Gerrit van den Bergh for being even smaller than the later fossils. Based on these, he suggested that H. floresiensis derived from a population of H. erectus and rapidly shrank. A phylogenetic analysis published in 2017 suggests that H. floresiensis was descended from the same (presumably australopithecine) ancestor as H. habilis, making it a sister taxon to H. habilis. On the basis of this classification, H. floresiensis is hypothesized to represent a hitherto unknown and very early migration out of Africa. A similar conclusion was suggested in a 2018 study dating stone artefacts found at Shangchen, central China, to 2.1 million years ago. Evolutionary tree according to a 2019 study: DNA extraction attempt In 2006, two teams attempted to extract DNA from a tooth discovered in 2003, but both teams were unsuccessful. It has been suggested that this happened because the dentine was targeted; new research suggests that the cementum has higher concentrations of DNA. Moreover, the heat generated by the high speed of the drill bit may have denatured the DNA. Congenital disorder hypotheses The small brain size of H. floresiensis at 417 cc has prompted hypotheses that the specimens were simply H. sapiens with a birth defect, rather than the result of neurological reorganisation. ;Microcephaly LB1 (left) vs. microcephalic human (right) Prior to Jacob's removal of the fossils, American neuroanthropologist Dean Falk and her colleagues performed a CT scan of the LB1 skull and a virtual endocast, and concluded that the brainpan was neither that of a pygmy nor an individual with a malformed skull and brain. In response, American neurologist Jochen Weber and colleagues compared the computer model skull with microcephalic human skulls, and found that the skull size of LB1 falls in the middle of the size range of the human samples, and is not inconsistent with microcephaly. In 2006, American biologist Robert Martin and colleagues also concluded that the skull was probably microcephalic, arguing that the brain is far too small to be a separate dwarf species; he said that, if it were, the 400-cubic-centimeter brain would indicate a creature only one foot in height, one-third the size of the discovered skeleton. A 2006 study stated that LB1 probably descended from a pygmy population of modern humans, but herself shows signs of microcephaly, and other specimens from the cave show small stature but not microcephaly. In 2005, the original discoverers of H. floresiensis, after unearthing more specimens, countered that the skeptics had mistakenly attributed the height of H. floresiensis to microcephaly. Falk stated that Martin's assertions were unsubstantiated. In 2006, Australian palaeoanthropologist Debbie Argue and colleagues also concluded that the finds are indeed a new species. In 2007, Falk found that H. floresiensis brains were similar in shape to modern humans, and the frontal and temporal lobes were well-developed, which would not have been the case were they microcephalic. In 2008, Greek palaeontologist George Lyras and colleagues said that LB1 falls outside the range of variation for human microcephalic skulls. However, a 2013 comparison of the LB1 endocast to a set of 100 normocephalic and 17 microcephalic endocasts showed that there is a wide variation in microcephalic brain shape ratios and that in these ratios the group as such is not clearly distinct from normocephalics. The LB1 brain shape nevertheless aligns slightly better with the microcephalic sample, with the shape at the extreme edge of the normocephalic group. A 2016 pathological analysis of LB1's skull revealed no pathologies nor evidence of microcephaly, and concluded that LB1 is a separate species. ;Laron syndrome A 2007 study postulated that the skeletons were those of humans who suffered from Laron syndrome, which was first reported in 1966, and is most common in inbreeding populations, which may have been the scenario on the small island. It causes a short stature and small skull, and many conditions seen in Laron syndrome patients are also exhibited in H. floresiensis. The estimated height of LB1 is at the lower end of the average for afflicted human women, but the endocranial volume is much smaller than anything exhibited in Laron syndrome patients. DNA analysis would be required to support this theory. ;Endemic cretinism Colin Groves and Debbie Argue examining the type specimen In 2008 Australian researcher Peter Obendorf—who studies endemic cretinism—and colleagues suggested that LB1 and LB6 suffered from myxoedematous (ME) endemic cretinism resulting from congenital hypothyroidism (a non-functioning thyroid), and that they were part of an affected population of H. sapiens on the island. Cretinism, caused by iodine deficiency, is expressed by small bodies and reduced brain size (but ME causes less motor and mental disablement than other forms of cretinism), and is a form of dwarfism still found in the local Indonesian population. They said that various features of H. floresiensis are diagnostic characteristics, such as enlarged pituitary fossa, unusually straight and untwisted humeral heads, relatively thick limbs, double rooted premolar, and primitive wrist morphology. However, Falk's scans of LB1's pituitary fossa show that it is not larger than usual. Also, in 2009, anthropologists Colin Groves and Catharine FitzGerald compared the Flores bones with those of ten people who had had cretinism, and found no overlap. Obendorf and colleagues rejected Groves and FitzGerald's argument the following year. A 2012 study similar to Groves and FitzGeralds' also found no evidence of cretinism. ;Down syndrome In 2014, physical anthropologist Maciej Henneberg and colleagues claimed that LB1 suffered from Down syndrome, and that the remains of other individuals at the Flores site were merely normal modern humans. However, there a number of characteristics shared by both LB1 and LB6 as well as other known early humans and absent in H. sapiens, such as the lack of a chin. In 2016, a comparative study concluded that LB1 did not exhibit a sufficient number of Down syndrome characteristics to support a diagnoses.  Anatomy  Reconstruction of an H. floresiensis female The most important and obvious identifying features of H. floresiensis are its small body and small cranial capacity. Brown and Morwood also identified a number of additional, less obvious features that might distinguish LB1 from modern H. sapiens, including the form of the teeth, the absence of a chin, and the lesser angle in the head of the humerus (upper arm bone). Each of these putative distinguishing features has been heavily scrutinized by the scientific community, with different research groups reaching differing conclusions as to whether these features support the original designation of a new species, or whether they identify LB1 as a severely pathological H. sapiens. A 2015 study of the dental morphology of 40 teeth of H. floresiensis compared to 450 teeth of living and extinct human species, states that they had \\"primitive canine-premolar and advanced molar morphologies,\\" which is unique among hominins. The discovery of additional partial skeletons has verified the existence of some features found in LB1, such as the lack of a chin, but Jacob and other research teams argue that these features do not distinguish LB1 from local modern humans. Lyras et al. have asserted, based on 3D-morphometrics, that the skull of LB1 differs significantly from all H. sapiens skulls, including those of small-bodied individuals and microcephalics, and is more similar to the skull of Homo erectus. Ian Tattersall argues that the species is wrongly classified as Homo floresiensis as it is far too archaic to assign to the genus Homo.Tattersall, 2015, p. 194 Size LB1's height is estimated to have been . The height of a second skeleton, LB8, has been estimated at based on tibial length. These estimates are outside the range of normal modern human height and considerably shorter than the average adult height of even the smallest modern humans, such as the Mbenga and Mbuti at , Twa, Semang at for adult women of the Malay Peninsula, or the Andamanese at also for adult women. LB1's body mass is estimated to have been . LB1 and LB8 are also somewhat smaller than the australopithecines from three million years ago, not previously thought to have expanded beyond Africa. Thus, LB1 and LB8 may be the shortest and smallest members of the extended human family discovered thus far. Their short stature was likely due to insular dwarfism, where size decreases as a response to fewer resources in an island ecosystem. In 2006, Indonesian palaeoanthropologist Teuku Jacob and colleagues said that LB1 has a similar stature to the Rampasasa pygmies who inhabit the island, and that size can vary substantially in pygmy populations. Of course, the Rampasasa pygmies are completely unrelated to H. floresiensis. Aside from smaller body size, the specimens seem to otherwise resemble H. erectus, a species known to have been living in Southeast Asia at times coincident with earlier finds purported to be of H. floresiensis. Brain Skull at the Naturmuseum Senckenberg, Germany In addition to a small body size, H. floresiensis had a remarkably small brain size. LB1's brain is estimated to have had a volume of , placing it at the range of chimpanzees or the extinct australopithecines. LB1's brain size is half that of its presumed immediate ancestor, H. erectus (). The brain-to-body mass ratio of LB1 lies between that of H. erectus and the great apes. Such a reduction is likely due to insular dwarfism, and a 2009 study found that the reduction in brain size of extinct pygmy hippopotamuses in Madagascar compared with their living relatives is proportionally greater than the reduction in body size, and similar to the reduction in brain size of H. floresiensis compared with H. erectus. Smaller size does not appear to have affected mental faculties, as Brodmann area 10 on the prefrontal cortex, which is associated with cognition, is about the same size as that of modern humans. H. floresiensis is also associated with evidence for advanced behaviours, such as the use of fire, butchering, and stone tool manufacturing. Limbs The angle of humeral torsion is much less than in modern humans. The humeral head of modern humans is twisted between 145 and 165 degrees to the plane of the elbow joint, whereas it is 120 degrees in H. floresiensis. This may have provided an advantage when arm-swinging, and, in tandem with the unusual morphology of the shoulder girdle and short clavicle, would have displaced the shoulders slightly forward into an almost shrugging position. The shrugging position would have compensated for the lower range of motion in the arm, allowing for similar manoeuverability in the elbows as modern humans. The wrist bones are similar to those of apes and Australopithecus, significantly different from those of modern humans, lacking features which evolved at least 800,000 years ago. The leg bones are thicker than those of modern humans. The feet were unusually flat and long in relation with the rest of the body. As a result, when walking, they would have had to have bent the knees further back than modern humans do. This caused a high-stepping gait and low walking speed. The toes had an unusual shape and the big toe was very short. Culture Models representing a Homo floresiensis, the Flores giant rat, the giant stork Leptoptilos robustus and the dwarf form of elephant Stegodon florensis insularis. Because of a deep neighbouring strait, Flores remained isolated during the Wisconsin glaciation (the last glacial period), despite the low sea levels that united Sundaland. Therefore, the ancestors of H. floresiensis could only have reached the isolated island by water transport, perhaps arriving in bamboo rafts around one million years ago. Liang Bua Cave shows evidence of the use of fire for cooking, and bones with cut marks. The cave also yielded a great quantity of stone artefacts, mainly lithic flakes. Points, perforators, blades, and microblades were associated with remains of the extinct elephant Stegodon, and were probably hafted into barbs to sink into the elephant. This indicates the inhabitants were targeting juvenile Stegodon. Similar artefacts are found at the Soa Basin south, associated with Stegodon and Komodo dragon remains, and are attributed to a likely ancestral population of H. erectus. Extinction The youngest bone remains in the cave date to 60,000 years ago, and the youngest stone tools to 50,000 years ago. The previous estimate of 12,000 BCE was due to an undetected unconformity in the cave stratigraphy. Their disappearance is close to the time that modern humans reached the area, suggesting that the initial encounter caused or contributed to their extinction. This would be consistent with the disappearance of H. neanderthalensis from Europe about 40,000 years ago, within 5,000 years after the arrival of modern humans there, and other anthropogenic extinctions. Modern human bones recovered from the cave dating to 46,000 years ago indicate replacement of the former H. floresiensis inhabitants. Other megafauna of the island, such as Stegodon and the giant stork Leptoptilos robustus, also disappeared. \\"Hobbit\\" nickname H. floresiensis was swiftly nicknamed \\"the hobbit\\" by the discoverers, after the fictional race popularized in J. R. R. Tolkien's book The Hobbit, and some of the discoverers suggested naming the species H. hobbitus. In October 2012, a New Zealand scientist due to give a public lecture on Homo floresiensis was told by the Tolkien Estate that he was not allowed to use the word \\"hobbit\\" in promoting the lecture. In 2012, the American film studio The Asylum, which produces low-budget \\"mockbuster\\" films,Somma, Brandon (4 January 2013). \\"Masters of the Mockbuster:What The Asylum Is All About\\". The Artifice. planned to release a movie entitled Age of the Hobbits depicting a \\"peace- loving\\" community of H.floresiensis \\"enslaved by the Java Men, a race of flesh-eating dragon-riders.\\" The film was intended to piggyback on the success of Peter Jackson's film The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. The film was blocked from release due to a legal dispute about using the word \\"hobbit.\\" The Asylum argued that the film did not violate the Tolkien copyright because the film was about H.floresiensis, \\"uniformly referred to as 'Hobbits' in the scientific community.\\" The film was later retitled Clash of the Empires.

It is generally considered to be more libertarian than the Progress Party itself.Eilif Frich Flydal: Hagen ute, ungdommen inne Dagbladet, 11. mai 2006 The organization has active chapters in all counties of Norway as well as in over 50 municipalities. From 2012, Himanshu Gulati was the organisation's chairperson. Gulati is the first leader of a youth wing of a major Norwegian political party with multi-cultural background.Første fleirkulturelle leiar for ungdomsparti, NRK After being selected to the post of State Secretary in the Ministry of Justice, Gulati stepped down. In 2014, Atle Simonsen was elected chairperson Atle sat as chairman until 2016, when the annual national meeting of FpU elected Bjørn- Kristian Svendrud as the organisation's chairman. Atle now works as political adviser to Minister of Children and Equality Solveig Horne.  History  The organization was officially founded by members of the Progress Party (FpU) on the annual party convention on 10–11 February 1978, the same convention where Carl I. Hagen was elected chairman of the party. The organizations first leader was the future mayor of Oslo, Peter N. Myhre, who served until 1984.  1994 Bolkesjø purge  As soon as in 1989, rifts appeared within the FpU between a liberal and conservative faction. In the 1989 election several, hardline libertarians such as Pål Atle Skjervengen and Tor Mikkel Wara gained seats in the Storting and this further weakened the conservatives' position. That same year saw controversial proposals put forth by the liberals regarding gay marriage and immigration which sparked heated debates within among the youth members. In 1992, the liberal Lars Grønntun was elected leader after a power struggle with Ingvar Myrvollen. This began a period of large-scale infighting which ultimately led to the board dissolving the organization, only to have the decision reversed by the party. After the expulsion of its entire liberal faction during the 1994 Progress Party national convention at Bolkesjø in Telemark, Ulf Leirstein became the new leader.  Recent history  Norwegian secondary schools hold school elections. The organization consistently polls better there than its parent party and emerged as the largest party nationwide in 1989, 2003, 2005 and 2009. Recently, they have been out-polled by their social-democratic rivals from AUF. In 2009, FpU set a new membership record of 3,031 members, although this number dipped to 2,892 in 2010. Nevertheless, all political youth-organizations experienced an upsurge in new members in the aftermath of the 2011 Norway attacks.  Ideology and political positions  In the organization's manifesto, it states: \\"The Progress Party's Youth supports a free-marked economy, regulated by supply and demand, without interference from government officials. A market economy is the economical system which gives the individual person greatest freedom of action\\". It also wishes to reform the welfare state with private insurance arrangements and increase privatization in the health and education sector, for one making the public hospitals \\"compete\\" with the privately owned hospitals for best possible care. It supports the legalization of medicinal cannabis, and more liberal drug laws in general.  Leadership   List of chairpersons  * 1978–1984: Peter N.

NKU still persisted as an organization, however, and held a congress in the middle of May 2006, where it declared its wish to cooperate with NKP, but also to continue on its own if necessary. At the same time NKP organized a conference of their own, where they established a new youth organization for the party, with the same name and logo as the original NKU. This has led to a conflict over the rights to the name, logo, history, international contacts and property of NKU, which lasted until July 2008. The conflict ended in court, where both NKU and NKP was found responsible for the problems that had arisen. However, it was decided that NKU still had the right to their name and logo. Therefore, NKP's re-established version of the Youth League, which had taken up several new members since 2006 had to change its name from Young Communist League of Norway (Norges Kommunistiske Ungdomsforbund) to Youth Communists in Norway (Ungkommunistene i Norge) and also change their logo. UngKom took over for NKU as NKP's youth league and view themselves as an incarnation of NKU. After freezing NKU's membership due to uncertainty over the situation in Norway, the World Federation of Democratic Youth decided to admit both communist youth organizations in February 2010. History 1903–1940 In 1903 in the city of Drammen as Young Social Democrats of Norway (NSU) as the youth wing of the Norwegian Labour Party. In 1923 they changed their mother party from the Labour Party to the newly formed communist party, which was formed following a conflict on the membership in Komintern. In the 1930s, the youth league worked together with the communist party against strikebreakers, fascism and for the establishing of a national front to defend the country against fascism and nazism. 1940–1949 When World War II came to Norway 9 April 1940, the youth communists prepared its organization for illegal work in case the Nazi occupation lead to communist organizations being illegalized. This happened in August the same year, a month before the illegalization of the other political parties. In addition to the communists being the fascists' and nazis' main enemy, this happened because the communists were the only ones who refused to print Quisling's statement of 10 April.The Norwegian Communist Party's newspaper Arbeideren 10 April 1940 By 16 April, communists urged armed resistance, while the other parties urged calm behavior.Hviteboka 1940, Second Edition, Forlaget Ny Dag, 1975. Following the illegalization, the youth league's resistance sharpened with the creation of some of Norway's first illegal papers during the warDød over de tyske okkupanter, First Edition, Informasjonsforlaget, 1998. When the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of 1939 was violated, the Youth Communists intensified their activities further. In the period 1941–1945 the Youth League was part of numerous sabotage-raids against Germans and German-aiding production, several of their members also contributed directly in the war effort. One example of this is Dagny Siblund from Jacobsnes in Finnmark, northern Norway, who fled to the Soviet Union and received training there before being dropped in a parachute over Norway as Norway's first female parachuter.Død over de tyske okkupanter, First Edition, p. 60, Informasjonsforlaget, 1998. When the war came to an end and the occupation was lifted, the organization had gained so much popularity that several of the Labour Party's Youth Wing leagues joined the communist league instead. In the next few years the youth league would disagree so much with the communist party that it resulted in an open political conflict within both organizations between the so-called Furubotn-fløy and the Løvlien-fløy. 1949–present The youth league became less prominent in Norwegian politics as the communist party lost its seats in the Storting. In 1967 a right-wing faction in the youth league was excluded from the communist party, but the faction had majority control over the central part of the communist youth league resulting in the youth league suspending to be the youth league of the communist party. In response to this the communist party established a new youth league called Communist Youth (KU) which took NKU's seat for a couple of years until NKU died out and they could reclaim the name and logo of the organization. NKU again became the youth wing of the communist party.

Founded by brothers Richard and David Darling in October 1986, Codemasters is one of the oldest British game studios, and in 2005 was named the best independent video game developer by magazine Develop. Codemasters Group Holdings plc is the holding company of Codemasters, which is publicly traded and owns The Codemasters Software Company Limited.  History   Background  Codemasters' logo between 1986 and 1993 While attending school in Vancouver, Richard Darling and his elder brother, David Darling, had learned programming with punch cards and had access to the school's computer room outside of hours through one of the school's janitors. Additionally, on weekends, they were allowed to use the Commodore PET computer owned by their father, James, to create a text version of Dungeons & Dragons. Later on, the two brothers and school friend Michael Heibert, whose family possessed a VIC-20 computer, founded Darbert Computers and created video game clones of popular games, such as Galaxian and Defender. The Darling brothers later returned to England, where they acquired their own VIC-20 and founded Galactic Software, again with the help of Heibert. An advertisement placed in the magazine Popular Computing Weekly caught the attention of Mastertronic, a British software publisher, and the two brothers quit their education to pursue development of budget-priced games for the company. These games included Space Walk, BMX Racers, Jungle Story, Orbitron, Sub Hunt, Pigs in Space. They also developed The Games Creator, a game making tool that would later be sold commercially. The Darling brothers found success in making these games, gaining by the time they were 16 and 17, respectively. In 1985, the two owned a 50% stake in Mastertronic, which they proceeded to sell in March 1986 when they decided to become independent. By October 1986, the Darling brothers, with help by their father, had founded Codemasters. They initially worked out of the Beaumont Business Centre in Banbury, where their elder sister, Abigail, managed the front desk. Codemasters' first game was BMX Simulator, a successor to BMX Racers. According to David Darling, the company aimed at making budget-priced games with the quality of full-priced games, as they would gain a larger customer base that would subsequently create better exposure. To produce more games in less time, Codemasters started hiring developers on a freelance basis. Products developed using this strategy include G-Man and Danger Zone by Mike Clark, Terra Cognita by Stephen Curtis, Super Robin Hood and Ghost Hunters by the Oliver Twins, Super Stuntman by Peter Williamson, Lazer Force by Gavin Raeburn, and ATV Simulator by Timothy R. Miller. By April 1987, Codemasters started seeking programmers that would create platform conversions of Codemasters' games in exchange for four-digit sums, via placements in Popular Computing Weekly.  1990s  As the 8-bit computer market diminished, Codemasters turned to develop for the 8-bit and 16-bit console markets, as well as moving away from their budget title legacy to more full-price games on the 16-bit computers — 1993 saw the last title in the budget Dizzy series, Crystal Kingdom Dizzy, although they released a full-price Dizzy game, Fantastic Dizzy, later. They had major success with the Micro Machines series and Pete Sampras Tennis on the Sega Mega Drive. Both franchises featured the J-Cart, allowing two extra controllers to be attached to the game cart without requiring Electronic Arts' 4 way play or SEGA's four-player adaptor. Codemasters is notable for making the large majority of games published by Camerica, which bypassed Nintendo's lock-out chip by glitching it and produced unlicensed NES games. These NES games were known for being shiny gold and silver cartridges that were slightly different from normal NES cartridges in shape, though they still fit into the cartridge slot. Many Codemasters titles were also featured on Camerica's Aladdin Deck Enhancer. In 1990, Codemasters developed a device called the Power Pak, later renamed the Game Genie. It was a cheat cartridge for the NES, released in the US by Galoob and in Canada and the UK by Camerica. In an ultimately unsuccessful lawsuit, Nintendo sued Galoob in the case Galoob v. Nintendo, claiming that the Game Genie created derivative works in violation of copyright law. In an effort to establish themselves in the United States, they announced that they would launch a new development studio in Oakhurst, using offices that were abandoned by Sierra On-Line and hiring much of Yosemite Entertainment's laid off staff in mid- September 1999.  1998–2009  Between 1998 and 2003, Codemasters dominated one area of game console entertainment when they teamed up with Jester Interactive Limited to publish their range of music creation software, for PlayStation, PlayStation 2 and PC, namely MUSICtm, Music 2000, MTV Music Generator and MTV Music Generator 2. In 2003 this partnership was dissolved, with Jester releasing their own Music 3000 product. Codemasters released their final music based product called MTV Music Generator 3 in 2004. Codemasters have since continued to release titles for later generation systems, such as the TOCA series, Colin McRae Rally series, Brian Lara Cricket series and Operation Flashpoint. They owned the rights to use the title Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising, but have parted with the original developer Bohemia Interactive Studio. In spite of this, Codemasters released Operation Flashpoint: Elite, developed by Bohemia, for Xbox in October 2005. The year 2005 also saw the appointment of Rod Cousens, formerly of Acclaim, as Managing Director. In April 2007, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group entered into a game distribution agreement with Codemasters to distribute the company's titles in North America ending May 2008. Also in April, Codemasters launched the massively multiplayer online role-playing game, The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar in Europe on behalf of Turbine. In June, Codemasters were purchased by equity group Balderton Capital and they changed their logo to an interlocked metallic C and M. Later that month they released the latest in the Colin McRae Rally series, Colin McRae: Dirt. They also published Overlord and Clive Barker's Jericho. Following the death of Colin McRae on 15 September 2007, Codemasters released a public statement expressing their sorrow and support for the family. In March 2008, Codemasters announced a new partnership with Majesco Entertainment which would focus on titles for DS and Wii, including Nanostray 2, Toy Shop, Cake Mania 2 and Nancy Drew: The Mystery of the Clue Bender Society for DS, and Wild Earth: African Safari, Our House and Cake Mania for Wii. In May, it was announced that Codemasters had won the rights to the Formula One licence after Sony's deal ran out. The first resulting game, F1 2009, was released on the Wii and PlayStation Portable in Autumn 2009, and another similar game, F1 2010, on the PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 in 2010. The game is based on the Dirt, Grid and Dirt 2 engine. On 8 April 2008, Sega announced the closure of Sega Racing Studio, although no reason was specified it has been assumed it was due to lackluster sales of Sega Rally Revo. At a later time Sega announced none of the employees were folded into internal studios. On 25 April 2008, Codemasters bought Sega Racing Studio. The studio was headed by Guy Wilday, who was involved in the Colin McRae Rally games and was formerly the series producer. In the 2008 Queen's Birthday Honours, the Darlings were appointed Commanders of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for services to the video game industry.  2010–present  On 5 April 2010, Reliance Big Entertainment, an Indian company acquired a 50% stake in the company. Later in 2010, Codemasters launched the free-to-play version of Lord of the Rings Online. While originally scheduled for 10 September, it was delayed due to contractual reasons and launched on 2 November. In May 2011, Codemasters transferred control of the European Lord of the Rings Online to Turbine. On 3 June 2011, the Codemasters.com website was breached. It is believed that the attacker was able to gain access to the personal information of registered users with Codemasters accounts. Codemasters notified its users about the attack via email on 10 June 2011, after which their websites were pulled down and users redirected to their Facebook page. In mid-2012, it was announced that Codemasters' racing games, whether about to be produced or developed, would begin to be branded under the 'Codemasters Racing' label. Dirt: Showdown and F1 2012 were the first racing titles to receive the new label name. The label was discontinued in 2016, as Codemasters' subsequent racing games, Dirt Rally and F1 2016 are branded with the regular Codemasters logo. On 9 June 2013, Reliance Entertainment increased its stake in Codemasters from 50% to 60.41%, making it the majority owner. In April 2015 Codemasters CEO Rod Cousens left to join Jagex, leaving COO Frank Sagnier as the new temporary CEO. In April 2016, Codemasters announced that they had hired most of the staff of racing game developer Evolution Studios after Sony closed the company. The first Codemasters title for eighth generation consoles was F1 2015, launched in July 2015. In October 2015 they released Overlord: Fellowship of Evil, their first non-racing game since 2011 and the last as of May 2018, not counting Onrush, which shares many aspects with racing games but is specifically in the separate vehicular combat genre. After the disappointing sales of Onrush, several members of the Codemasters EVO development division were let go in redundancies and the division was shifted to a support role for other titles. Codemasters held an initial public offering to list the company on the London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment Market on 1 June 2018. The company's shares were valued at 260 pence during trading bringing in a total of GBP 185 million. As a result of the IPO, Reliance Entertainment held a 29.5% stake in Codemasters. Through placings in June and November 2019 Codemasters welcomed new institutional shareholders to the register whilst providing Reliance with a highly satisfactory exit and thus ending their nine-year relationship with them.https://www.insidermedia.com/news/midlands/entertainment-giant-sells- remaining-stake-in- codemasters#:~:text=An%20Indian%20entertainment%20giant%20has,million%20shares%2C%20at%20205p%20each. Codemasters acquired Slightly Mad Studios, the developers of the Project CARS titles, in November 2019 for about . The acquisition brought the total staff at Codemasters to about 700 people. The studio got the exclusive license to the World Rally Championship series in June 2020 which will begin as a five- year deal in 2023, with plans to release their first game in 2024.

Young Liberals was founded on 27 January 1909, with Anders Kirkhusmo as the first leader. The current president is Sondre Hansmark, since 2017. Vice presidents are Ane Breivik and Lars Brandsås, and the International Officer is Idun Gulla Dyrnes. It advocates a more liberal version of the mother party's social liberalist ideology. Young Liberals of Norway is a member of the international liberal youth organizations: * European Liberal Youth (LYMEC) * International Federation of Liberal Youth (IFLRY) Name The Norwegian name 'Unge Venstre' has historical reasons, and although it literally translates as 'Young Left' in English, Young Liberals of Norway are not socialists, but in fact liberals. To avoid confusion, the official English-language name of the party is 'Young Liberals of Norway'. Proposals to change the name of Unge Venstre to 'Liberal Ungdom' ('Liberal Youth') have been defeated in successive congresses. Policies of Young Liberals of Norway * The Young Liberals are strongly in favour of fighting climate change, calling it \\"the greatest threat of our time\\" on their website.http://www.ungevenstre.no/politikk As a result, the Young Liberals are in favour of helping renewable energy become competitive through subsidies, but believe that the market rather than politicians should determine which technology is best.http://www.ungevenstre.no/politikk/energi The Young Liberals oppose the construction gas power stations without Carbon capture and storage, and opposes subsidies for polluting industries. The Young Liberals are also in favour of other types of environmental protection, such as hindering oil exploration of the coast of Lofoten due to the fragility of the environment. * The Young Liberals are in favour of free trade, especially the removal of tariffs on the products of developing nations.http://www.ungevenstre.no/politikk/handel This is seen as an integral part of achieving global economic justice rather than a threat to it. * The Young Liberals are arguably the most pro-immigration political group in Norway, and advocate free labour immigration.http://www.ungevenstre.no/politikk/innvandring The Young Liberals supports compulsory classes in Norwegian as a prerequisite for gaining citizenship.http://www.ungevenstre.no/politikk/integrering * The Young Liberals are in favour of Norwegian membership in the European Union,http://www.ungevenstre.no/politikk/eu and criticise the European Economic Area agreement as undemocratic because Norway is not represented when decisions regarding it are taken. * The Young Liberals have recently become especially prominent in the debate on drug policy, and is advocating harm reduction policies. It is calling for legalization and regulation of all drugs. The youth party also advocates administration of clean heroin to drug addicts who have not succeeded in other means of rehabilitation. Furthermore, the party stresses that more resources must be spent on rehabilitation, health care and follow-ups for both previous and existing drug addicts. Relationship with Venstre Young Liberals of Norway are independent of Venstre but co-operates closely with them, for example the leader of Young Liberals is automatically a member of the central governing body (Sentralstyret) of Venstre. Venstre and Young Liberals have different opinions on some matters, most prominently in that Young Liberals of Norway supports Norwegian entry into the European Union while Venstre opposes this. The Young Liberals of Norway failed to make Venstre pro-EU during Venstre's party congress in April 2009. The Young Liberals are generally more liberal in their views than the mother party, both on social and economic issues. They aim to influence Venstre views so that they accords more with those of the Young Liberals. Notable recent victories include convincing Venstre to support heroin prescription in the treatment of addiction, to consider drug decriminalization and to support intellectual property reform.

Military career During the Spanish–American War (1898), Ensign McVay served aboard the , a double-turret monitor. It patrolled the waters off Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Key West and participated in the shelling of San Juan in May 1898. In 1908, after serving as a navigator aboard USS Hartford and USS Alabama and a tour at the US Naval Academy, McVay was given command of USS Yankton. In 1909, McVay was stationed at Norfolk, Virginia, as the Yankton had just returned from an around-the-world cruise with the Great White Fleet. World War I service During World War I, McVay served as commanding officer aboard three vessels: USS Saratoga, , and USS Oklahoma. Asiatic Fleet Command After the war, McVay served as a commander in the Yangtze Patrol. At this time, the United States, along with Japan and the major European nations, had garrisons in Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin. U.S. Navy gunboats regularly patrolled the Yangtze River to protect foreigners during a turbulent period when China had no effective central government.

Geography Raon-l'Étape is positioned at the mouth of the Plaine River at the point where it converges into the Meurthe, itself a tributary of the Moselle. Because it is on departmental frontier with the adjacent Meurthe-et-Moselle département, Raon-l'Étape is sometimes known as the \\"Gateway to the Vosges\\" (porte des Vosges). The town is positioned at a point where relatively flat lands transform into a much more mountainous topography: the mountains have for centuries restricted the options for travellers between francophone France and Alsace (formerly the western reaches of the Empire on the other side of the Vosges). The position of Raon has therefore been critical to influencing the movements of merchandise in peace time and of armies in war time for many centuries. Saint-Dié-des-Vosges is to the south-east while Nancy is to the north-west, in both cases tracking the national road RN59, much of which has in recent years been upgraded to quasi-autoroute quality. Taking a cross country route, Épinal is approximately to the south-west. The little town is closely surrounded by woodland, which covers almost 60% of the communal territory. The town has a long tradition of manufacturing in a wide range of sectors such as paper milling, quarrying, engineering, plastics, textiles, clothing and telecommunications. It is also a major commercial centre for surrounding communes, notably on Saturday mornings, Saturday being market day. History The name An earlier name for the commune was 'Ravon', a word which in the local dialect denotes the confluence of rivers. 'Étape' has mutated from the word 'Tape' which was the name given to the right to transit the territory, obtained in return for a toll which was imposed on merchants, whether moving their goods along the river or along the adjacent road. Two settlements on either side of the Meurthe The old village was founded in the thirteenth century on the 'champ de Rua', near the confluence of the Plaine and Meurthe rivers, and dominated by Beauregard Castle which had been rebuilt and extended by Frederick III, Duke of Lorraine. The land was included within the territory of Moyenmoutier Abbey. The Dukes of Lorraine controlled the transit of salt and wheat towards the mountains, and imposed a 'protection levy' on the 'Saulniers Way', a well frequented trade route across the mountains towards Sélestat and Saales. The foundation of Raon achieved its economic objectives, attracting members of the mercantile class which was growing across Europe at this time. The application of the Beaumont Law in the little town enfranchised the merchants, providing an enhanced contractual basis for commerce. Geography also favoured commerce with the presence of two navigable rivers, and economic success was assured through civic privileges conferred by the dukes and through the security afforded by the growth of fortifications and the maintenance of a military garrison. On the left bank of the river, the hamlet of La Neuveville dates back further, having been established during the twelfth century with protection and support from Duke of Lorraine by the cannons of Étival Abbey who provided both the necessary land and the expertise. The port at La Neuveville made it possible for loads of both processed and rough-cut timber to be exported along the river. The little town grew rapidly in size and wealth, and the white monks themselves reverted to a more contemplative existence, while the civilian administration of the dukes seized the initiative in founding Raon-l'Étape on the other side of the river which made it easier to protect transshipment across the river the important Saulniers Way trade route towards the mountains and The Empire beyond. During the fourteenth century the civil influence of the monks declined at La Neuveville as the little town and its important port facilities came increasingly under the sole control of the Dukes, while the citizens continued vigorously to reject the pressing influence of Raon-l'Étape. Neither town grew beyond a population of a few thousand, still separated into two settlements by their river, until the nineteenth century, but by the end of the seventeenth century they nevertheless had grown larger than Saint-Dié up in the mountains to the south-east. In 1864 it was the left bank, and therefore La Neuveville, that was privileged to receive a rail connection on the line from Nancy. The railway brought industrialisation and also put an end to the transportation of timber by floating it down the river, which had contributed to the development of the little port for so long. Paradoxically, it was the prestige of Raon-l'Étape which in some ways benefitted more than that of La Neuveville: tourism began to evolve in France for the first time in the late nineteenth century, and the old right bank town with its picturesque medieval streets offered a quaint charm that replaced the industrial and commercial action that grew apace in its left bank rival. The commune of today results from the merger in 1947 of La Neuveville and Raon-l'Étape into a single commune. Their strategic position meant that both towns suffered badly in the Second World War, and the remaining residents were strongly supported by humanitarian aid from, in particular, the Swiss Red Cross in the years immediately following the conflagration. The acting mayor of La Neuveville, who was a man named Capel, wondered if rebuilding a separate mairie was worth while at a time of severe economic hardship, given that the mairie of Raon-l'Étape now looked unnecessarily large for the diminished population level on the right bank. The proposal to merge the communes was therefore essentially driven by the economics of the situation in which the communities found themselves: the responsible councils and the prefect were persuaded and the fusion of the former rival communes went ahead. Although the two communes had been intended by their founders as complementary settlements, long centuries of rivalry were not so easily set aside, and the different banks of the river continue to value their separate histories. Old Wars The Thirty Years' War 1618-1648 The closing decades of the sixteenth century and the first half of the seventeenth century were a particularly grim period for Lorraine and for much of Europe. The weather seems to have contributed an above average quota of poor or failed harvests, while the Thirty Years' War unleashed a catalogue of horrors, especially on the territories such as Lorraine that found themselves buffered between two great continental powers of that time, France and The Empire. Massacres, looting and executions were inflicted both by the locally recruited armies and by the hordes of the dispossessed that often followed in their wake. The Swedish armies, allied with the French, have a reputation for particular savagery in Lorraine during the time of Duke Charles IV. Two battles unfolded before the walls of Raon during the period. The first of them in 1635 found the troops of the recently defeated Duke of Lorraine confronting the French cavalry: on this occasion Lorraine prevailed. But in 1636 there was another battle in which the armies of Lorraine and their imperial allies were defeated. That same year Richelieu, the French king's first minister, keen to minimise opportunities for Austrian resistance, arranged for the flattening of all the castles in Lorraine, including Beauregard Castle which for centuries has overlooked Raon. All the passing armies and successive battles left behind them only ruin and desolation. The local economy collapsed: famine and plague ensued. Lorraine was slow to recover. The statistical records show large numbers of people simply disappeared. Even in 1710, a census undertaken for Raon counted only 194 inhabitants. The French revolution and its aftermath 1789-1800 For the most part. the violent and destructive manifestations of the French Revolution and the battles of the ensuing Napoleonic Wars occurred far from Lorraine, though the district suffered its share of economic disruption and the mobilisation of fighting age men. The administrative reforms that occurred across France put and end once and for all to the church-state partnership that had controlled the country for so long under the ancien regime, and left the civil state in control. The Franco-Prussian war After the French imperial army of Napoleon III was defeated at Sedan on 2 September 1870, and faced with the advance of enemy troops further south in the Vosges region, resistance mobilised rapidly, as disparate companies of Gardes Mobiles and of irregular guerilla fighters sprang to arms. Several fighters were killed at a battle occurring in the Plaine Valley at a small settlement called Lajus on 20 September 1870, and the region experienced various skirmishes, small scale battles and other incidents including the taking and shooting of civilian hostages during and beyond the closing months of 1870. The most important battle took place on 6 October 1870 in the La Salle - Nompatelize sector (after which the battle would be named), at a gap in the mountains on the route towards Épinal. The battle was won by the Baden Brigade commanded by General Degenfeld. After the Peace signed at Frankfurt on 10 May 1871, Raon was garrisoned by a battalion of the 9th Pomeranian Regiment who were initially billeted on the citizens, and subsequently installed in a barracks that was completed by the end of December 1871. On 14 November 1872 the Pomeranians were replaced by the 2nd battalion of Prince Albrecht's 73rd regiment of Hanoverian Fusiliers. They administered Raon-l'Étape in collaboration with the civilian authorities without major incident. Nevertheless, the town was obliged to pay financial contributions / reparations totally 33,840 francs. On 30 July 1873 the occupation ended and the German troops withdrew towards Baccarat and the new Franco-German frontier to the north of Nancy. The departure of the soldiers unleashed much celebration in Raon. Sport US Raon-l'Étape is based in the town.

The most popular London museum in the private sector is The Sherlock Holmes Museum. The DCMS totals for the financial year to 31 March 2008 were as follows: :NOTE: Tate Modern and Tate Britain are on separate sites two miles apart, but the DCMS only publishes a single combined visitor figure for them. Tate Modern is widely reported to attract the more visitors of the two, but it is not clear whether it received more visitors than the British Museum on its own. The majority of government-funded museums stopped charging admission fees in 2001 and, although this was challenged in 2007, this has remained the case. Following the removal of admission charges, attendances at London museums increased, with a large percentage of the 42 million annual visitors nationwide.

It is the youth organisation of the Red party, which originally formed with the merger of the Red Electoral Alliance and the Workers' Communist Party in March 2007. The current leader of Red Youth is Alberte Tennøe Bekkhus. Politics It is an organisation with three main principles: revolutionary socialism, feminism, and communism. Their goals are typically communist; they aim to organise the working class in preparation for what they perceive as an eventual overthrow of the capitalist system. Since the election of the Red-Green government in 2005, Red Youth has been working to push the Labour Party and the Socialist Left Party in a communist direction. In August 2008, a faction of communist dissidents left the youth organization to form Revolutionary Communist Youth, the youth affiliate of Serve the People. Activism Red Youth is an activist organisation, and has performed political actions and media stunts directed towards Norwegian politicians. Red Youth interrupted the Christian Democratic Party's national meeting in 2004 in an attempt to expose and highlight what they perceived as the Christian Democrats' anti-homosexual attitude. Also in 2004, they harassed the Conservative Minister of Education, Kristin Clemet, for alleged crimes against Norwegian students. Several members of the Red Youth were arrested in 2005, after trying to charge the Parliament of Norway in what was an anti-racist action. The Red Youth also built a refugee asylum in the garden of the Conservative Minister of Local Government, Erna Solberg, in 2008, as a protest against her immigration policies.

She had assistance from Kevin Standlee and Anne Murphy. The magazine published 134 regular issues and 6 special issues between September 1995 and October/November 2006. Emerald City received several Hugo Award nominations during its run, winning once in 2004 in the Best Fanzine category. History Morgan began publishing Emerald City in September 1995, and the magazine contained numerous reviews of books and reports on the current state of science fiction fandom. The vast majority of the published material was written by Morgan herself, though several guest writers also contributed. Ending its run in November 2006, the 'zine was published on a regular monthly schedule, Morgan having produced a total of 134 issues, all of which are still available for download in multiple formats. Morgan also maintained a popular weblog with current news related to science fiction and fantasy writing and publishing. On August 1, 2006, Morgan announced on her weblog that \\"Emerald City will be ceasing publication over the next couple of months.\\" Subsequently, the September 2006 issue (number 133) was described on Morgan's email list as \\"The final(-ish) edition.\\" A last issue, number 134, was published in November 2006.

In 2005, Cheryl Morgan was nominated for three Hugo Awards: the magazine for Best Fanzine, Morgan herself for Best Fan Writer, and the web site for Best Web Site. Subsequently, Morgan declared Emerald City to be a semiprozine, and the magazine was nominated in 2006 for Best Semiprozine, while Morgan was again nominated for Best Fan Writer. In 2008, after continuing to write at her personal website, cheryl-morgan.com, Morgan was nominated for another Hugo Award for best fan writing. She was again nominated and won 2009's Hugo Award in this category. In 2010 and 2011, Clarkesworld Magazine, a semiprozine on which Morgan worked as non-fiction editor, was nominated and won for Best Semiprozine. On September 1, 2011, Morgan announced her withdrawal from the Clarkesworld staff as well as from several other genre projects. As of 2011, Emerald City and Morgan as an individual have been nominated for a total of 10 Hugo Awards, with two wins. The two Clarkesworld wins brings her personal Hugo Award collection up to four rockets.

Trade can take the form of managerial exchange, technology transfers, and all kinds of goods and services. (However, certain exceptions exist that cannot be exchanged; the railway services of a country, for example, cannot be traded with another country to avail the service.) It contrasts with a closed economy in which international trade and finance cannot take place. The act of selling goods or services to a foreign country is called exporting. The act of buying goods or services from a foreign country is called importing. Exporting and importing are collectively called international trade. There are a number of economic advantages for citizens of a country with an open economy. A primary advantage is that the citizen consumers have a much larger variety of goods and services from which to choose. Additionally, consumers have an opportunity to invest their savings outside the country. There are also economic disadvantages of an open economy. Open economies are interdependent on others and this exposes them to certain unavoidable risks. If a country has an open economy, that country's spending in any given year need not equal its output of goods and services. A country can spend more money than it produces by borrowing from abroad, or it can spend less than it produces and lend the difference to foreigners. there is no totally-closed economy.  Economic models   The basic model  In a closed economy, all output is sold domestically, and expenditure is divided into three components: consumption, investment, and government purchases. Y = C + I + G where Y is the national income, C is the total consumption, I is the total investment and G is the total government expenditure. In an open economy, some output is sold domestically and some is exported to be sold abroad. We can divide expenditure on an open economy’s output Y into four components: Cd, consumption of domestic goods and services, Id, investment in domestic goods and services, Gd, government purchases of domestic goods and services, X, exports of domestic goods and services. The division of expenditure into these components is expressed in the identity Y = Cd + Id + Gd + X. The sum of the first three terms, Cd + I d + Gd, is domestic spending on domestic goods and services. The fourth term, X, is foreign spending on domestic goods and services (the value of exports). Since total domestic spending is a sum of spending on domestic as well as foreign goods and services, we can say that, C = Cd + Cf, I = I d + I f, G = Gd + G f. We substitute these three equations into the identity above: Y = (C − Cf ) + (I − I f ) + (G − G f ) + X. We can rearrange to obtain Y = C + I + G + X − (Cf + I f + G f). The sum of domestic spending on foreign goods and services (Cf + I f + G f) is expenditure on imports (IM). We can thus write the national income accounts identity as Y = C + I + G + X − IM. Since the value of total imports is a part of domestic spending and it is not a part of domestic output, it is subtracted from the total output. This gives us the value of Net Exports (NX = X − IM), the identity becomes Y = C + I + G + NX. In closed economy: National savings = Investment. Closed economy countries can increase its wealth only by accumulating new capital. If output exceeds domestic spending s, we export the difference: net exports are positive. If output falls short of domestic spending, we import the difference: net exports are negative. International capital flows and trade balance Begin with the identity Y = C + I + G + NX. Subtract C and G from both sides to obtain Y − C − G = I + NX. Y − C − G is national saving S, which equals the sum of private saving, Y − T − C, and public saving, T − G, where T stands for taxes. Therefore, S = I + NX. Subtracting I from both sides of the equation, we can write the national income accounts identity as S − I = NX. This shows that economy's net exports must be equal to the difference between savings and investment. Another name for net exports is the trade balance, as it tells us the difference between imports and exports from being equal. The left-hand side of the identity is the difference between domestic saving and domestic investment, S − I, known as net capital outflow. Net capital outflow is equal to the amount that domestic residents are lending abroad minus the amount that foreigners are lending to home country. If net capital outflow is positive, the economy’s saving exceeds its investment, and lending the excess to foreigners. If the net capital outflow is negative, the economy is experiencing a capital inflow: investment exceeds saving, and the economy is financing this extra investment by borrowing from abroad. The national income accounts identity shows that net capital outflow always equals the trade balance. That is, Net Capital Outflow = Trade Balance S − I = NX. If S − I and NX are positive, we have a trade surplus. In this case, since our exports are higher than our imports, we are net lenders in world financial markets. If S − I and NX are negative, we have a trade deficit. In this case, we are importing more goods than we are exporting. And hence we are net borrowers in the world markets. If S − I and NX are exactly zero, we are said to have balanced trade because the value of imports exactly equals the value of our exports.  Capital mobility and world interest rates  In case of a small open economy, perfect capital mobility is often assumed. By \\"small\\" it is understood that an economy has very small share in the world markets. Things that happen within the economy are thus assumed to have a negligible effect on interest rate. By perfect capital mobility, it is often meant that residents of a country have full access to goods and services and specifically financial markets of the world. The assumption of perfect capital mobility, together with the very strong assumption of a perfect equilibrium, causes the interest rate in the small open economy, r, to equal the world interest rate r*, the real interest rate prevailing in world financial markets: r = r*. This means that people in this small open economy will never borrow at more than rate r in the small open economy. They will shift to international markets to borrow or invest, in case r > r*. Because of the popularity of the small open economy model, it is often said that, the interest rates in a small open economy are determined by the world markets. The world interest rate is determined in another way, and often economists choose to model this through an equilibrium between world interest and world savings.

History  The area is where Commodore Gordon Bremer, commander-in-chief of British forces in China, took formal possession of Hong Kong on 26 January 1841. Captain Edward Belcher, who surveyed the island in 1841, wrote: \\"We landed on Monday, the 25th, 1841, at fifteen minutes past eight A.

The area, which came to be known as Possession Point, was kept an open space, and used for recreation by the local Chinese, who called it Tai Tat Tei. It was developed in the 1980s and formed into a hotel and commercial complex, which is also the site of the Hong Kong–Macau Ferry Terminal.Tsang, Steve (2007) [2004]. A Modern History of Hong Kong.

In maps of the 1980s and before, Hollywood Road Park is marked as Possession Point. This marks the original site which, owing to land reclamation, is no longer located on the coast.

It was effectively replaced in 1951 with the launch of Ford UK's Zephyr Six and Consul models, though V8 Pilots were still offered for sale, being gradually withdrawn during that year. In its production run 22,155 cars were made. Engine and running gear The Pilot was the first large post-War British Ford. It was based on the pre-War Model 62 chassis, and was initially offered in 1946 with the 2227 cc side-valve V8 60 engine from the 1939 model. That engine proved inadequate for the vehicle size and was quickly replaced by the E71A Dagenham 'Enfo' (English Ford) 30hp engine. Dagenham cast its own version of the US 1937 Model 78, 21 stud, 30 indicated hp, 221 cubic inch/3.6 litre block and probably all ancillaries, most of which had Enfo part numbers. The E71A engine had a number of differences from the 1937 US engine. The block had one frost plug at the rear on each side, just below the heads, the heads had the firing order cast in, the crankshaft had a long snout, allowing for the fitting of double pulley fan belts for trucks, and big end bearings were flanged 1/4 shells (4 per journal). The sump was also different, because it had a pear-shaped locating hole to accommodate the Lucas starter. Exhaust manifolds had a flowing design, which was an improvement on US versions. The E71 30hp 3622 cc engine developed , with a stroke of and a bore of , and was fed by a single Solex carburettor. The engine, with twin-sheave belt pulleys, was also used in Thames trucks. The gearbox had three forward ratios and one reverse, and gears were changed by a gear lever on the steering column. Steering used a form of worm and roller mechanism called a Marles steering box, which had an \\"hour-glass cam and a double roller\\". The car was considered old-fashioned even when new, but its front brakes were hydraulically operated. The rear brakes were cable-operated. The Pilot was built with 6-volt Lucas electrics, including the starter & generator. A twin exhaust system was standard, providing a quality sound. The wide stud pattern wheels were the same as on 1936 to 1939 US cars. The front and rear brake drums were ENFO-made but had the same dimensions as the 1936 US Model 68. Most Pilots were four-door saloons, based on the 1935 USA Model 48, but Estate (Shooting Brake (Woody)) and pick-up versions were built, the latter for export only. The chromed brass front windscreen could be opened for ventilation, pivoted about a top hinge. Leather upholstery was standard, and the trim on all interior window frames and the dashboard was made of Bakelite plastic. Trafficator-type indicators were standard, and a hydraulic four-jack system was optional. Production ended in 1951 when Ford replaced the Pilot with the Zephyr. Like other Fords of its era, the Pilot had vacuum-driven wipers powered from the engine manifold, with a vacuum reservoir tank to improve performance under load, whereas wipers on US cars without the reservoir tended to work much more slowly or even stop under full throttle or under load. The car was reputed to accelerate from 0 to in 21 seconds, have a top speed of , and return .

The ensemble cast features Chris Cooper, Kris Kristofferson, Matthew McConaughey and Elizabeth Peña and deals with a sheriff's investigation into the murder of one of his predecessors. Filmed on location along the Rio Grande in southern and southwestern Texas, the film received near-universal critical acclaim, with critics regarding it as a high point of 1990s independent cinema as well as Sayles' best work. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Writing, and also appeared on the ballot for the AFI's 10 Top 10 in the western category. The film was a box office success, grossing $13 million against its $3 million budget. Plot Sam Deeds is the sheriff of Rio County in Frontera, Texas. A native of Frontera, Sam returned two years ago and was elected sheriff. Sam's late father had been the legendary Sheriff Buddy Deeds, who is beloved by the town, remembered as a unique individual with a great sense of fairness and justice. As a teenager Sam had problems with his father and the pair routinely argued and fought. Sam is particularly disapproving of efforts by local business leader Mercedes Cruz and Buddy's former chief deputy, Mayor Hollis Pogue, to enlarge and rename the local courthouse in Buddy's honor; he considers it an unneeded waste of taxpayers' money. As a teenager, Sam had been in love with Mercedes's daughter Pilar, but the courtship was strongly opposed by Buddy and Mercedes. After a chance meeting, Sam and the widowed Pilar, now a local teacher, slowly resume their relationship. Colonel Delmore Payne has recently arrived in town as the commander of the local U.S. Army base. Delmore is the son of Otis \\"Big O\\" Payne, a local nightclub owner and leading figure in the African-American community. The two are estranged because of Otis's serial womanizing and abandonment of Delmore's mother when Delmore was a child. Two off-duty sergeants from the base discover a human skeleton on an old shooting range on the base along with a Masonic ring, a Rio County sheriff's badge, and later, an expended pistol bullet, very unusual on a rifle range. Sam brings in Texas Ranger Ben Wetzel to help with the case. Wetzel tells Sam that forensics identify the skeleton as that of Charlie Wade, the infamously corrupt and cruel sheriff who preceded Buddy. Wade mysteriously disappeared in 1957, taking $10,000 in county funds, after which Buddy became sheriff. Sam investigates the events leading up to Wade's murder. He learns that Wade terrorized the local African-American and Mexican communities, including extorting money from local business owners on a monthly basis and numerous murders where he asks his innocent victims to show him any weapon they might have, to then justify shooting them for \\"resisting arrest\\". Wade used this method to murder, in front of Deputy Hollis, Mercedes' husband, Eladio, having discovered he was running an illegal smuggling operation in Rio County without bribing Wade. Sam also uncovers secrets about his father's nearly 30-year term as sheriff that reveal Buddy's own corruption. He visits Wesley Birdsong, a Native American and a roadside tourist stand owner, who reveals that Buddy was a wild young adult after his service in the Korean War but settled down after becoming a deputy sheriff and marrying Sam's mother; but he reveals that Buddy did have a mistress, whose name Wesley claims to have forgotten. Sam travels to San Antonio, where he visits his marginally mentally ill ex-wife Bunny and searches through his father's things, where he discovers love letters from Buddy's mistress. Otis tells Sam that Buddy's focus was on the county political machine while Wade's focus was on money. The janitor at the sheriff's office reveals to Sam that he worked on Buddy's home while incarcerated in the local jail. A local reporter uncovers that Buddy forcibly evicted residents of a small community to make a lake that made Frontera a popular tourist destination with Buddy and Hollis receiving lakefront property. Sam confronts Hollis and Otis about Wade's murder. Wade discovered Otis was running an illegal gambling operation at the nightclub, after he had previously warned Otis against running numbers in the club. A furious Wade violently attacked Otis, ordered him to hand over the monthly extortion money, and then was about to use his \\"resisting arrest\\" setup to kill Otis. Buddy arrived just as Hollis shot Wade to prevent Otis's murder. The three buried the body and took the $10,000 from the county and gave it to Mercedes—who was destitute after Eladio's recent death—to buy her restaurant. Hollis reveals that Buddy and Mercedes did not take up until some time later. Sam decides to drop the issue, saying it will remain an unsolved mystery. Hollis voices concern that, when the skeleton is revealed to be Wade, people will assume Buddy killed him to take his job, to which Sam states that Buddy's legend can handle it. Pilar meets Sam at an old drive-in theater where Sam shows her an old photo of Buddy and Mercedes and tells her Eladio died 18 months, rather than \\"a couple months\\", before she was born, revealing Buddy is Pilar's father. Both are hurt over the deception but decide that, since she cannot have any more children, they will continue their romantic relationship, despite the knowledge that they are half-siblings.

Reception Critical response The film received highly positive reviews. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 94% based on 47 reviews, with a rating average of 8.59/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Smart and absorbing, Lone Star represents a career high point for writer-director John Sayles -- and '90s independent cinema in general.\\" Two years after release, Jack Mathews of the Los Angeles Times declared it \\"critically acclaimed and darn near commercial\\". In retrospect from 2004, William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer said that the film was \\"widely regarded as Sayles' masterpiece\\", declaring that it had \\"captured the zeitgeist of the '90s as successfully as \\"Chinatown\\" did the '70s\\". Writing at the time of release, Janet Maslin of The New York Times said, \\"This long, spare, contemplatively paced film, scored with a wide range of musical styles and given a sun-baked clarity by Stuart Dryburgh's cinematography, is loaded with brief, meaningful encounters... And it features a great deal of fine, thoughtful acting, which can always be counted on in a film by Mr. Sayles\\". \\"All the film's characters are flesh and blood\\", Maslin added, pointing particularly to the portrayals by Kristofferson, Canada, James, Morton and Colon. Film critics Dennis West and Joan M. West of Cineaste praised the psychological aspects of the film, writing, \\"Lone Star strikingly depicts the personal psychological boundaries that confront many citizens of Frontera as a result of living in such close proximity to the border\\". Ann Hornaday for the Austin American-Statesman declared it \\"a work of awesome sweep and acute perception\\", judging it \\"the most accomplished film of [Sayles'] 17-year career\\". However, not all contemporary critics were completely positive. While The Washington Post writer Hal Hinson characterized it as \\"a carefully crafted, unapologetically literary accomplishment\\", he said that Sayles' \\"directing style hasn't grown much beyond that of a first-year film student\\", declaring the director was \\"stagnant\\".

These were cathode ray tubes (CRT) that stored information written to them using an analog technique inherent in the CRT and based upon the secondary emission of electrons from the phosphor screen itself. The resulting image was visible in the continuously glowing patterns on the face of the CRT. DVBST technology was anticipated by Andrew Haeff of the US Naval Research Laboratory, and by Williams and Kilburn in the late 1940s. Tek's (Tektronix) Robert H. Anderson refined Haeff's concepts in the late 1950s to produce a reliable and simple DVST. Principle The DVBST implements two electron guns: a \\"flood gun\\" and a \\"writing gun\\". The writing gun scans across a wire grid, charging the grid to create the negative image. The flood gun then floods the grid. Previously charged areas repel the incoming electrons so that electrons only pass through the grid to the phosphor in those areas not previously charged. The technology offered several advantages and disadvantages. Advantages * No refreshing is needed. * Very complex pictures can be displayed at very high resolution without flicker. Disadvantages * They ordinarily do not display color. * Selected part of the picture can not be erased. * The erasing and redrawing process can take several seconds for complex pictures. * No animation in DVST. * Modifying any part of image requires redrawing of entire image. Applications Tektronix- made DVBSTs were used for analog oscilloscopes (first in the 564 oscilloscope, then the type 601 monitor (1968), the 611 monitor, the 7313 and 7514 plug-in mainframe oscilloscope, all from Tektronix) and for computer terminals such as the archetypal Tek 4010 and its several successors including the Tektronix 4014. Portions of the screen are individually written-to by a conventional electron beam gun, and \\"flooded\\" by a wide, low velocity electron gun. Erasure required erasing the entire screen in a bright flash of green light, leading to the nickname \\"the mean green flashin' machine\\". Some DVBST implementations also allowed the \\"write-through\\" of a small amount of dynamically refreshed, non-stored data. This allowed the display of cursors, graphic elements under construction, and the like on computer terminals.  Skiatron  Another version of a (non-Tektronix) DVBST was the \\"dark trace\\" CRT, also known as the Skiatron. This CRT replaced the conventional light-emitting phosphor layer on the face of the tube screen with a scotophor such as potassium chloride (KCl). KCl has the property that when a crystal is struck by an electron beam, that spot would change from translucent white to a dark magenta color. By backlighting such a CRT with a white or green circular fluorescent lamp, the resulting image would appear as black information against a green background or as magenta information against a white background. A benefit, aside from the semi-permanent storage of the displayed image, is that the brightness of the resultant display is only limited by the illumination source and optics. The image would be retained until erased by flooding the scotophor with a high-intensity infrared light or by electro-thermal heating. Using conventional deflection and raster formation circuity, a bi-level image could be created on the membrane and retained even when power was removed from the CRT. By using an array of dots, say 8 × 8, a larger pixel could be formed to represent 64 gray levels. One such device, the D36 Image Display, was made by DICOMED Corporation and a technical paper was presented at the 1972 Electro- Optical Conference in Geneva, Switzerland.

From 1180 on the Scharmbeck belonged to the Prince- Archbishopric of Bremen. The monastery in Osterholz was founded in 1182 and persisted until 1650, when Lower Saxony became mostly Protestant. In 1648 the Prince-Archbishopric was transformed into the Duchy of Bremen, which was first ruled in personal union by the Swedish and from 1715 on by the Hanoverian Crown. In 1823 the Duchy was abolished and its territory became part of the Stade Region in the Kingdom of Hanover. In 1927 the two communities of Osterholz and Scharmbeck were merged under the name of Osterholz-Scharmbeck and in 1929 town privileges were granted. Between 1978 and 1992, 4,200 soldiers of the U.S. Army's 2nd Armored Division (Forward) were stationed, and another 4,000 family members resided in Osterholz-Scharmbeck.

It is not the same as a sand dune. It features very short fire return intervals, one to five years. Without fire, sandhills undergo ecological succession and become more oak dominated. Entisols are the typical sandhill soil, deep well-drained and nutrient poor. In Florida, sandhills receive cm of rainfall per year, just like the more hydric ecosystems surrounding them. Sandhills are xeric because they have poor water holding capacity. Dominant vegetation includes longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), American turkey oak (Quercus laevis), and wiregrass (Aristida stricta). A number of rare animals are typical of this habitat including the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus), red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis), Sherman's fox squirrel (Sciurus niger shermani), and striped newt (Notophthalmus perstriatus). Invasive species that are a problem on sandhills include Cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica), camphor laurels (Cinnamomum camphora), and Natal grass (Melinis repens).

Genres Argo's first issue, Music from Bali, was dedicated to the Indonesian gamelan (ensemble) recorded at the Winter Garden Theatre, London. The catalogue eventually ran to 1,000 items. In 1953, Usill was introduced to Indian musician Deben Bhattacharya, who was responsible for field recordings of traditional music in India. Bhattacharya had been frustrated by the absence of recordings he could use for his BBC Radio broadcasts. Around the same time, Walter Harris recorded an amateur Brazilian choir in Rio de Janeiro. Such recordings as these appeared in the labels \\"Living Traditions\\" series. Taking advantage of the capacity of the longer playing time of LP records, Argo embarked on recording the complete works of William Shakespeare. Cambridge University's Marlowe Players participated in the series, which was the responsibility of Dadie Rylands, a fellow at King's College, Cambridge. Recording began in 1957 and was completed by 1964. Initially professional actors had been reluctant to work for the project, but in time Judi Dench, Derek Jacobi and Prunella Scales participated. \\"The Poet Speaks\\" series consisted of contemporary poets reading their work. It included Ted Hughes, Sylvia Plath, and Anthony Thwaite. In 1954, the company recorded the Festival of Lessons and Carols (Christmas) service at King's College, Cambridge, a venue where the acoustics had previously defeated the abilities of engineers at other companies. A series of the masses of Joseph Haydn, initially recorded at the same venue, commenced in 1960, though after the first release with the London Symphony Orchestra, later recordings were made with the Choir of St John's College, Cambridge and the Academy of St Martin in the Fields under George Guest. One of their biggest sellers was Under Milk Wood featuring Richard Burton in the BBC production of Dylan Thomas' radio drama. Bought by Decca Argo was bought by British Decca in 1957. Usill remained in charge and the company was able to maintain autonomy from the parent company. The company at this time recorded dramatised versions of Alice in Wonderland (1958) and Through the Looking-Glass, both directed by Douglas Cleverdon and both starring Jane Asher in the title role, with actors Tony Church, Norman Shelley, and Carleton Hobbs, with Margaretta Scott as the narrator; and The Wind in the Willows (1960), adapted and produced by Toby Robertson, with Richard Goolden as Mole, Frank Duncan as Rat, Tony Church as Badger, and Norman Shelley as Toad, with Patrick Wymark as the narrator. Another significant recording from this era is the premiere recording of Benjamin Britten's one-act opera/miracle play for children, Noye's Fludde (1961). A series of recordings of steam locomotives (then in the early stages of being phased out in the UK) was masterminded by the film sound recordist and mixer Peter Handford, selling up to 30-40,000 copies per year under the name Transacord. It also did some other unusual pressings such as London's Last Trams using early amateur mobile sound recorders. catalogue DA78 The repertoire diversified into modern British jazz through the poetry and jazz movement of the early 1960s. This meant that recordings by pianist Michael Garrick were particularly well represented. The radio ballads of Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger, originally produced by BBC Radio (1958–64), were leased and issued by Argo from 1965. MacColl and Seeger also issued a 12-volume series of LPs called The Long Harvest, which featured variant British and U.S. versions of traditional ballads from the collection of Francis James Child. A small cluster of folk artists joined the label around this time, including Tom Paley (with his New Deal String Band), the Druids, the Clutha, the Songwainers, and the Garret Singers. In the 1970s, Decca extended their children's audiobook series the Railway Stories on the Argo label, with six further books (3 LPs) narrated by William Rushton. In 1974, they produced an abridged, dramatic version of The Hobbit, read by Nicol Williamson,The Hobbit, read by Nicol Williamson. 4-record boxed set, Argo Records, 1974, ZPL 1196/9 and released the soundtrack to the film Tarka the Otter (1979), which featured Peter Ustinov's narration and David Fanshawe's music score. The label passed to PolyGram when the conglomerate acquired British Decca in 1980. Harley Usill left the company and co-founded ASV Records. Argo as an independent entity ceased in 1988. Argo relaunch, 1990 The label was relaunched in 1990 as an imprint of Decca with the intent to concentrate on choral, organ, and British and American classical music. Releases continued throughout the 1990s. The last release was in 1998. The audio books (in cassette and CD form) continue in the Argo name but under a different logo.

He is remembered as one of the first American heroes of the war after ordering his crew to bail out while he remained at the bomber’s controls trying to keep the plane in the air before it exploded, killing him. His was the first American B-17 to be shot down in combat. Life Kelly was born in Madison, Florida in 1915 and graduated from high school there in 1932. He went on to West Point in 1933, graduated in the Class of 1937, and was assigned to a B-17 bomber group. He was the first Army officer to fly the Boeing Flying Fortress in the Far East. Battle and death On December 10, 1941 (December 9th in the United States), a single B-17C Flying Fortress heavy bomber, #40-2045, departed from Clark Field, on the island of Luzon, Commonwealth of the Philippines, alone and without escort, to search for an enemy aircraft carrier which had been reported near the coastal city of Aparri, at the northern end of the island. The aircraft was under the command of Captain Colin P. Kelly, Jr., Air Corps, United States Army, of the 14th Bombardment Squadron, 19th Bombardment Group. Kelly’s Flying Fortress had not been fully fueled or armed because of an impending Japanese air raid. It carried only three 600-pound (272 kilogram) demolition bombs in its bomb bay. While enroute to their assigned target area, Captain Kelly and his crew sighted a Japanese amphibious assault task force north of Aparri, including what they believed was a Fusō-class battleship. The crew was unable to locate the reported aircraft carrier and Kelly decided to return to attack the ships that they had seen earlier. Kelly made two passes at 20,000 feet (6,096 meters) while the bombardier, Sergeant Meyer Levin, set up for a precise drop. On the third run, Sergeant Meyer released the three bombs in trail and bracketed the IJN light cruiser Natori. It and an escorting destroyer, IJN Harukaze, were damaged during the attack: > ...The battleship [actually, the light cruiser IJN Natori] was seen about 4 > miles offshore and moving slowly parallel with the coastline...

On its return flight, the bomber was then engaged by the Tainan Air Group A6Ms which had been patrolling over Vigan. They attacked it, followed it, and attacked again. Captain Kelly ordered his crew to bail out and though the fire had spread to the flight deck, Kelly remained at the bomber's controls while he tried to keep the plane straight and level. Staff Sergeant James E. Halkyard, Private First Class Willard L. Money, and Private Altman were able to escape from the rear of the B-17. The navigator, Second Lieutenant Joe M. Bean, and the bombardier, Sergeant Levin, went out through the nose escape hatch. As co-pilot Lieutenant Donald Robins tried to open the cockpit’s upper escape hatch, the Flying Fortress exploded. Robins was thrown clear and was able to open his parachute. Boeing B-17C 40-2045 crashed approximately three miles (4.8 kilometers) east of Clark Field.

Kelly had earlier in peace time also been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. The United States Junior Chamber of Commerce posthumously gave its 1941 distinguished service award to Kelly on January 22, 1942, in Chicago.

It equals a nation's income minus consumption and the government spending.  Economic model  Closed economy with public deficit or surplus possible In this simple economic model with a closed economy there are three uses for GDP (the goods and services it produces in a year). If Y is national income (GDP), then the three uses of C consumption, I investment, and government purchases can be expressed as: * Y = C + I + G National saving can be thought of as the amount of remaining income that is not consumed, or spent by government. In a simple model of a closed economy, anything that is not spent is assumed to be invested: * \\\\text{National Saving} = Y - C - G = I National saving can be split into private saving and public saving. Denoting T for taxes paid by consumers that go directly to the government and TR for transfers paid by the government to the consumers as shown here: * (Y - T + TR - C) + (T - G - TR) = I (Y − T + TR) is disposable income whereas (Y − T + TR − C) is private saving. Public saving, also known as the budget surplus, is the term (T − G − TR), which is government revenue through taxes, minus government expenditures on goods and services, minus transfers. Thus we have that private plus public saving equals investment. The interest rate plays the important role of creating an equilibrium between saving S and investment in neoclassical economics. * S(r)=I(r) where the interest rate r affects saving positively and affects physical investment negatively. Open economy with balanced public spending In an open economic model international trade is introduced. Therefore the current account is split into exports and imports: * \\\\text{Net eXports} = NX = \\\\text{eXports} - \\\\text{iMports} = X - M The net exports is the part of GDP which is not consumed by domestic demand: * NX = Y - ( C + I + G ) = Y - \\\\text{Domestic demand} If we transform the identity for net exports by subtracting consumption, investment and government spending we get the national accounts identity: * Y = C + I + G + NX The national saving is the part of the GDP which is not consumed or spent by the government. * Y - C - G = S = I + NX Therefore the difference between the national saving and the investment is equal to the net exports: * S-I = NX Open economy with public deficit or surplus The government budget can be directly introduced into the model. We consider now an open economic model with public deficits or surpluses. Therefore the budget is split into revenues, which are the taxes (T), and the spendings, which are transfers (TR) and government spendings (G). Revenue minus spending results in the public (governmental) saving: * S_G = T - G - TR The disposable income of the households is the income Y minus the taxes net of transfers: * Y_d = Y - T + TR Disposable income can only be used for saving or for consumption: * Y_d = C + S_P where the subscript P denotes the private sector. Therefore private saving in this model equals the disposable income of the households minus consumption: * S_P = Y_d - C By this equation the private saving can be written as: * S_P = Y - T + TR - C and the national accounts as: * Y = S_P + C + T - TR Once this equation is used in Y=C+I+G+X-M we obtain * C + I + G + (X - M) = S(P) + C + T - TR By one transformation we get the determination of net exports and investment by private and public saving: * S_P + S_G = I + (X - M) By another transformation we get the sectoral balances of the economy as developed by Wynne Godley.

Since 1935, it has been classified as a state park. It is the most- visited state park facility in South Carolina and is a part of the ACE Basin estuarine reserve area. Known for its natural environment, the island remains one of the few remaining undeveloped Sea Islands in the Lowcountry. The park is known for its 19th century lighthouse which bears its name. The park's beach has been featured in several travel publications and was listed in 2013 as a Top 25 beach in the United States by TripAdvisor.http://www.tripadvisor.com/TravelersChoice-Beaches-cTop-g191#14 Hunting Island lighthouse from beach History Hunting Island retains its colonial designation of the \\"Hunting Islands,\\" which served as hunting preserves for Lowcountry planters and elite in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Hunting Island light was constructed in the 1850s and soon thereafter destroyed by Confederate forces in the early days of the Civil War. Ten years after the Civil War ended the lighthouse was rebuilt, and later relocated to its current position. The 1893 Sea Islands hurricane swept Hunting Island and other nearby Sea Islands clean, but the lighthouse survived. In the 1930s, the island was developed into a state park by the Civilian Conservation Corps as bridges were constructed to connect the outer Sea Islands with Beaufort. Thanks to limited human development, the island remains a preserve for its abundant wildlife. There are more than of beach, a dense maritime forest in the interior areas, and an extensive saltwater marsh on the western side. The most notable attraction is the 19th-century lighthouse, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. While not operational, the lighthouse tower features a rotating light in the tower that is turned on at night. A campsite at Hunting Island The southern terminus of U.S. Route 21 has been on Hunting Island since 1953. US 21 extended to the south end of the island until about 1980, when erosion destroyed a portion of the highway, forcing the state to create a new entrance to the park and a set of one-lane roads through the palmetto forest. US 21 now ends at the point where it formerly veered east toward the lighthouse. Since 1980, Hunting Island has suffered major beach erosion as a result of heavy tides from the confluence of the Atlantic Ocean and Saint Helena Sound, and is expected to shrink in size by ten per cent over the next forty years. At times there is ride-able surf on the island, which is best three hours before high tide due to the large continental shelf effect on incoming waves. In 1993, most of the Vietnam scenes in Forrest Gump were filmed on Hunting Island and neighboring Fripp Island. The Marsh Boardwalk at Hunting Island Wildlife The wildlife includes loggerhead turtles, deer, alligators, raccoons, diamondback rattlesnakes, and hundreds of species of birds. The island has an abundance of herons and egrets, as well as summertime sightings of the painted bunting. The interior lagoon (which was created by sand dredging in 1968) has become naturalized and home to such species as seahorses and barracuda. Each summer loggerhead turtle hatchlings emerge from the sand and walk out to the ocean. Around 60 and 130 nests are laid annually on the beach. A volunteer organization, the friends of hunting island has a permit from the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources to find and protect the nests. Each morning during nesting season, volunteers walk every mile of the beach to help find and protect nests. Facilities Hunting Island provides locations for recreational vehicles and tent campers on the northern portion of the island. All but one park's cabins have been destroyed in recent years due to high beach erosion. A lagoon is adjacent to a washed-out cabin road and serves as a popular location for fishing. Hunting Island Visitors Center is located in the middle of the island, overlooking a small lagoon. The center provides general information on the island, and has space for activities and offices for park staff. The center is also connected with Hunting Island's extensive trail system and is a short distance to several beach access points. The Hunting Island Nature Center features live animals and exhibits about the habitats and history of the park. The center is located at the entrance to the Paradise Pier fishing pier, which juts into the Fripp Inlet between Hunting and Fripp Island. The lighthouse is open year round to the public. Visitors are able to climb to the viewing deck of the tower for a nominal fee. Hunting Island's of beachfront provide a pristine, natural experience for visitors. Although the beach is heavily eroded towards the southern end of the island, ample shore remains in the central section and in the campground areas towards the north end. The state park also features several trails for hiking and biking, including a loop trail that cuts through the maritime forest and along the lagoon. The trail also connects to the Marsh Boardwalk, a popular stop for photographers. A short 5-minute walk leads visitors across a section of marsh onto a hammock and towards a deck along a tidal creek.

If N is the number of points on the elliptic curve E over a finite field with q elements, then Helmut Hasse's result states that :|N - (q+1)\\\\le 2 \\\\sqrt{q}. The reason is that N differs from q + 1, the number of points of the projective line over the same field, by an 'error term' that is the sum of two complex numbers, each of absolute value . This result had originally been conjectured by Emil Artin in his thesis. It was proven by Hasse in 1933, with the proof published in a series of papers in 1936. Hasse's theorem is equivalent to the determination of the absolute value of the roots of the local zeta-function of E. In this form it can be seen to be the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis for the function field associated with the elliptic curve.  Hasse-Weil Bound  A generalization of the Hasse bound to higher genus algebraic curves is the Hasse–Weil bound. This provides a bound on the number of points on a curve over a finite field. If the number of points on the curve C of genus g over the finite field \\\\mathbb{F}_q of order q is \\\\\\\\#C(\\\\mathbb{F}_q), then :|\\\\\\\\#C(\\\\mathbb{F}_q) - (q+1)\\\\le 2g \\\\sqrt{q}. This result is again equivalent to the determination of the absolute value of the roots of the local zeta- function of C, and is the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis for the function field associated with the curve. The Hasse–Weil bound reduces to the usual Hasse bound when applied to elliptic curves, which have genus g=1.

GRP was known for its all-digital recordings and jazz-pop sound. History The music label was started and founded by Oscar-winning composer and Grammy Award-winning jazz musician Dave Grusin along with his best friend and former drummer turned engineer and co- producer/label runner Larry Rosen. Grusin and Rosen were originally members of singer Andy Williams' band during the 1960s and after both left Williams, Grusin established both his career as jazz musician with his debut album Subways Are for Sleeping for Columbia Records and as an established film composer with scores for Divorce American Style (his first film score ever written and a job obtained from his work with prolific film and television producer Bud Yorkin), The Graduate, The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter (which is Grusin's favorite film score and would re-record the theme on many of his jazz albums in later years), Candy and Winning as well as working in television. Rosen would start his own commercial recording agency catering to record music for television commercials and other industry films, while personally learning the art of music engineering giving up playing professionally as a jazz drummer. He would build his own studio during this period that would be the first step of Grusin and Rosen's evolution of the eventual label in years to come. Early 1970s With Grusin and Rosen flourishing in their respective careers as a film composer, jazz musician, engineer and commercial music producer in which Rosen had won numerous CLIO awards for background in commercial music, a chance recording session for a commercial would set up what would become the seeds of their eventual partnership. Rosen had just recorded a musician named Jon Lucien in 1972 in which Lucien would sing and play for the engineer and fledging producer. Rosen was excited about the prospects of recording him and then contacted Grusin to do the musical arrangements for the potential album. The album Rashida for RCA Victor released in 1973 was Grusin and Rosen's first producing job and they followed up their first collaboration with Lucien with Song For My Lady for Columbia Records in 1975. Grusin during this time would not only provide arrangements for the likes of Sergio Mendes and Peggy Lee but also began a prolific partnership in Hollywood with the late director Sydney Pollack, that would benefit both men as they worked together for more than three decades until Pollack's passing in the late 2000s. Their first film together The Yakuza for Warner Bros. would also feature one of Grusin's best friends and also a label mate in popular guitarist Lee Ritenour, who was around 19 years old at the time, and Three Days of The Condor starring Oscar Award winner Robert Redford, which is the most popular score and film of their decades-long collaboration. 1975–1977 In 1975 when Rosen was visiting Los Angeles where Grusin was working at the time, he made a proposition to Grusin to form a company together since they had already been collaborating on several projects. Grusin agreed and as soon as that happened, Dr. George Butler, who was running Blue Note Records called them to produce an album by a young musician from Detroit who been playing with jazz and R&B; star George Benson with CTI Records named Earl Klugh. They both agreed and Klugh's self-titled album released in 1976 would be the first official release under their newly formed production company, Grusin/Rosen Productions. They would produce two more Klugh albums for Blue Note, Living Inside Your Love and Finger Paintings. Also during this period, the pair would go on to produce another of Rosen's recording musicians for his commercials in violinst Noel Pointer, his debut album for Blue Note Phantazia and his follow-up album, Hold On. Phantazia featured the debut of flautist Dave Valentin, who would be the first artist signed to the soon-to- be-born label in 1978. They also produced albums for other artists, including Patti Austin's Havana Candy for CTI Records, Lee Ritenour's The Captain's Journey for Elektra Records, and Yutaka Yokokura's Love Light for Alfa Records Japan, which was a hit throughout the US despite being released only in Japan, where the album was considered a commercial failure, as well as Grusin's One Of The Kind for Polydor Records. They were all successfully-produced albums, especially during the latter half of the decade, when disco had become a successful musical fad. They were also able to accomplish this with somewhat limited airplay before more radio stations that featured solely jazz would hit the airwaves, which eventually happened in later years throughout the US. Grusin and Rosen's albums were so well produced that radio stations did find a place for them, which would benefit them in the next couple of decades. 1978–1981 Grusin and Rosen's success as producers led to a meeting with Arista Records chief Clive Davis, whose Novus Records jazz banner had produced solid albums that were not selling despite positive reviews. Davis offered Grusin and Rosen a deal that would make them producers for at least three jazz artists per year, which the pair was not interested in doing. Grusin and Rosen wanted a logo deal that would make them established, and Davis agreed to it. GRP/Arista Records was formed and the very first artist signed under their new deal was flautist Dave Valentin, who had made his debut on his friend Noel Pointer's albums for Blue Note. Singer Angela Bofill, who was Valentin's girlfriend at the time, was also signed to the label along with trumpet player Tom Browne, vibraphonist Jay Hoggard and the youngest performer under their banner, high school piano prodigy Bernard Wright, who was 16 years old when he recorded his debut album Nard in 1980, among the other artists they signed and produced. Valentin's debut album Legends would sell more than 70,000 copies, Bofill's debut album Angie would sell over 280,000 copies and Browne's debut album Browne Sugar would sell more than 700,000 copies, which surprised many and solidified Grusin's and Rosen's reputations as producers. Also during this period, Grusin made his first pure digital recording, the best-selling album Mountain Dance, which was recorded live with no overdubbing and utilized some of the best recording technology at the time including the digital Soundstream Editing System, which was from Salt Lake City, Utah. The album was recorded in five grueling days and was one of the first digital recordings produced in 1978. Grusin then took a group of artists for a tour in Japan which was documented by the album Dave Grusin And The GRP All-Stars In Japan and featured many of the label's artists including Grusin and his brother Don Grusin, Tom Browne, Dave Valentin, Bobby Broom, Marcus Miller, Buddy Williams, and guest Japanese saxophonist Sadao Watanabe, which was recorded in fall of 1980 and would be the first of many GRP concerts that they would hold over the years there. 1982 Grusin and Rosen's time at Arista Records was coming to an end as Clive Davis and the label were seeing different visions for the success of the label. Davis wanted to concentrate on hit singles by the latest hot artists for extended airplay, while Grusin and Rosen were concentrated on great sound quality, performances and establishing a bigger audience for jazz at that point in time. Grusin and Rosen made an amenable parting with Arista and Davis in which they were able to acquire a few albums that they produced including bestsellers such as Legends, Browne Sugar, The Hawk (Dave Valentin's follow-up album to Legends), Without Rhyme Or Reason by Scott Jarrett (brother of jazz pianist Keith Jarrett), Days Like These by Hoggard and Grusin's own albums Mountain Dance and Out Of The Shadows. They were also able to acquire other albums they were involved with from other labels that included Grusin's One Of A Kind from Polydor Records and Lee Ritenour's On The Line and Rio from Elektra Records, which was recorded in 1978 as a hybrid digital and analog recording that was recorded both in the US and in Brazil, while the former was a pure digital recording with no overdubbing whatsoever. Other albums that they produced under their banner would stay with Arista, which is now owned by Sony Music Entertainment. This would also be true of artists such as Tom Browne and Angela Bofill, who was coaxed into leaving GRP by Davis for a more lucrative deal with the label that resulted in watered-down drum machine material much like Browne's. In later years, after her short-lived success under Grusin and Rosen's tutelage, Bofill would suffer some personal health- related setbacks. Soon they would make a very important decision that would change the history of jazz, since both Grusin and Rosen both strongly felt that all of the albums they had produced for most labels were getting the \\"back of the bus\\" treatment without proper advertising or promotion. They were also disappointed that the albums they produced were not released or available at record stores on their release dates. Taking in all of these factors, Grusin and Rosen formed a record company because they wanted to be in control of all of these factors. This led to them signing established jazz stars such as Lee Ritenour, Billy Cobham, Chick Corea, Dizzy Gillespie, and Gerry Mulligan to go along with Dave Valentin, who joined Grusin and Rosen after leaving Arista Records along with newbies, guitarist Kevin Eubanks, the group Special EFX and Diane Schuur, a blind singer-pianist from Seattle, who was discovered by the late saxophonist Stan Getz and invited to the White House in 1982 to perform with Getz for First Lady Nancy Reagan on a special that aired on PBS. The Compact Disc Player and Compact Disc were introduced that year in Japan; Grusin and Rosen were intrigued by its audiophile sound and it was something they felt would be vital to the growth of the company. 1982–1989 Now established as a record company, Grusin and Rosen were pushing forward and thinking of the future and how to make the label stand out with the evolving technology of the times. Grusin and Rosen figured that the compact disc with its optical and audiophile capabilities would be a very important part of what they were trying to do to make the label successful, which was to produce high-quality recordings with the best sound and production available to them including recording venues, musicians and orchestras. To accomplish this, they decided on a specific album that not only would introduce the best of what they were producing, but also an album that catered to those people who could afford the first CD players available for their homes, which cost $1,000 per unit at the time in 1983. After much research, the Glenn Miller Band was chosen to be the first album recorded for their company in January 1983. Members of the original band, as well as special guests like singer Mel Tormé, also participated in the ambitious project recorded in New York City. The album In The Digital Mood not only became a popular album after its release selling more than 100,000 units, but also one of the label's greatest selling albums to this day, and was recognized as such in 1992 with a \\"Gold Edition\\". They followed up this best selling album with Gerry Mulligan's Little Big Horn and Grusin's NY/LA Dream Band, which was a live concert from 1982 that was recorded in Japan and seen throughout the country. The label during this period would be known mainly for its fusion work, but two of the first three releases were the straight-ahead jazz albums by Glenn Miller Band and Mulligan. Another vital addition was recording the great Dizzy Gillespie, which helped the label even more as Grusin and Rosen teamed him up with the best of the young jazz musicians performing at the time, including saxophonist Branford Marsalis and pianist Kenny Kirkland for the album New Faces. Compact discs were carried in limited supply in record stores but were available wherever CD player systems were sold at that time when they were first released. Knowing this, Grusin and Rosen produced CD Samplers (three in three different volumes from 1984–87) that showcased the artists on the label, the sound quality, and performances due to the lack of other record labels having joined the format at that time which lasted until 1987, when a lot of the record labels made the transition to the CD format. These CDs did help gain the label an audience with the audiophiles who first bought these machines and also, to expand the label in format. Their first batches of pressed discs from 1984 until 1987 came directly from Japan by the JVC Corporation, which are audiophile in quality and were quality produced recordings that truly displayed the dynamic range of the performances, unlike an LP or cassette. In 1984, Grusin would release his second purely digitally recorded album and his first one for his label, Night- Lines, which used even more contemporary digital equipment and instruments not unlike his 1978 effort for Arista Records, Mountain Dance. So would artist Billy Cobham and his purely digital album, Warning, who recorded this album during the year. Grusin and Rosen were approached by the JVC Corporation late in 1984 to represent them because of their standards for the highest quality in recording and for their well-regarded albums for the latest in their audio technology. So for the first time under their own banner, the label conducted its first live tour around Europe and the US during the Summer of 1985. Eventually, the label decided to have a \\"live session\\" which was videotaped at the Record Plant Recording Studio in Los Angeles, California as well featuring all of the members of that travelled that included Grusin, Ritenour, Valentin, Schuur and their GRP recording members. Also in 1984 the film, Falling In Love starring Oscar winners Robert De Niro and Meryl Streep would be released by Paramount Pictures. Grusin provided the original musical score for the film, but the film had been tracked by music from Grusin's breakthrough digital album, Mountain Dance which became the main theme for the film despite writing a purely jazz score in the same vein. In 1985, the label released their first- ever soundtrack to any motion picture for the drama, American Flyers starring Oscar winner Kevin Costner, which was composed and performed by Lee Ritenour and Greg Matheson, who were with the label exclusively at the time. The album was never released on CD until Varèse Sarabande finally released it in 2016. In 1986, Eddie Daniels would make his Grammy-nominated debut for the label with Breakthrough, which was a fusion album of a different sort as Daniels' clarinet solos were mixed with a huge London Orchestra creating a very elaborate and popular album that melded both jazz and classical together. A year later, Daniels' follow-up album for the label To Bird With Love, would be the very first \\"pure\\" jazz recording for the label dedicated to the late saxophonist Charlie Parker, gaining positive reviews. By 1987, the label was no longer independent as they signed a distribution deal with MCA Distributing, one of the six largest distribution companies in the US at the time. The deal was significant at the time because it helped the label reach the top of the Billboard Magazine charts as the number one jazz label in the world starting in 1988, according to the Billboard polls, as more people would have access to their recordings unlike before. They also produced and released a similar project to that of the Glenn Miller Band dedicated to one of jazz's greatest legends, Duke Ellington. The album \\"Digital Duke\\" reassembled members of Duke Ellington's band under the direction of his son, Mercer, in a digital recording setting with the latest technology. The album was produced in conjunction to the United States Postal Office's official .22 cent Stamp dedicated to Ellington a year earlier commemorating his 87th Birthday. The label also signed vibraphonist Gary Burton and saxophonist Tom Scott, who would make significant contributions to the label with well-received albums of their own in \\"Reunion\\" and \\"Born Again\\", which is Scott's first pure jazz recording for the label and the first in more than a decade at the time and \\"Them Changes\\", which was the music from the short-lived \\"The Pat Sajak Show\\" that ran on CBS from January 1989 to 1990, where Scott was the musical director on. 1988 marked a couple of firsts for the label. Flautist Dave Valentin recorded his first \\"Live\\" album for the label and that for any solo artist, \\"Dave Valentin Live At The Blue Note\\", which was a two-night recording that took place on May 31 and June 1 of that year, which would mark the first of a series of \\"Live Albums\\" for the artists on the label which would follow in later years with Chick Corea (\\"Alive\\"), The Rippingtons (\\"Live In LA\\") and \\"Dave Grusin Presents GRP All-Star Big Band Live!\\" which was the follow-up album to the original GRP All-Star Big Band from the labels' 10th Anniversary. The label also recorded the first of three Christmas albums featuring artists from the label entitled \\"A GRP Christmas Collection\\" that included jazz interpretations of classic Christmas songs and some that are obscure arranged in diverse ways by the artist recording on it. The label would produce two more albums in 1991 and 1993, which was the final one under Grusin and Rosen's supervision before they departed from the label in 1994. The artists that participated in the album included the likes of Grusin, Lee Ritenour, David Benoit, Gary Burton, Tom Scott, Diane Schuur, Nelson Rangell, Arturo Sandoval, Chick Corea, Eddie Daniels, New York Voices, George Howard, Ramsey Lewis, B.B. King, Russ Freeman and The Yellowjackets among others. Grusin would win his first Academy Award for Robert Redford's second film as a director, \\"The Milagro Beanfield War\\", which would be released a year later as part of his last album for the label of the decade, \\"Migration\\". The label also signed popular harpist, Deborah Henson-Conant to further diversify the label much like they had done in the late 1970s which got their label off and running. Signing her to a four-album deal in which her fourth album for the label in 1993 called \\"Budapest\\", was abruptly cancelled and released by another label. By the end of 1989, GRP is named the number one jazz label in the world by voters. Radio stations like New York's CD 101.9 on the East Coast and WNUNA 95.5 in California were up and running under the \\"smooth jazz\\" format where a lot of the label's stars began to shine and the label would create samplers on behalf of the record stations to promote the label and the artist. Giving them considerably strong airplay over the radio. The label would have a successful year with albums by David Benoit, Lee Ritenour, Dave Grusin, Chick Corea, Gary Burton, Diane Schuur and Nelson Rangell that would propel them into the 1990s on a high note. Grusin would celebrate his 1988 Academy Award win with another nomination for his score and important participation for the comedy-drama, \\"The Fabulous Baker Boys\\", starring Oscar Winner 7, Jeff Bridges, Academy Award Nominee Beau Bridges (Jeff's brother) and Academy Award Nominee Michelle Pfeiffer. The film would receive multiple nominations, including Best Picture and for Grusin's invaluable contribution for Best Original Score. The album would be a best seller for the label. 1990–1994 In early 1990, Grusin and Rosen decided to sell the label to the MCA Corporation for the sum of 40 million dollars in celebration of their 3-year deal with MCA Distributing. However, this was a differently structured deal in which the company would not be absorbed or merged with another within the family of labels under the MCA Records label. This particular deal was one in which the company expanded to something much bigger. GRP now had the sole exclusivity to produce and release new as well as old recordings by artists were currently on the MCA Records roster that included Larry Carlton, B.B. King, Spyro Gyra, The Yellowjackets, George Howard, Acoustic Alchemy, Michael Brecker, and The Crusaders, among others. In addition to that, GRP was also solely responsible for reissuing, remastering and releasing premiere titles from the Impulse!, Chess, Argo and Decca catalogs that featured a wealth of jazz recordings from popular jazz artists that include John Coltrane, Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Count Basie, Ramsey Lewis, Keith Jarrett, Coleman Hawkins, Max Roach, Sonny Rollins, McCoy Tyner and many, many more. Recordings that have taken at least three decades to release at the present time and continue to be reissued currently. One of their first reissues, \\"Billie Holiday: The Complete Decca Recordings\\" won Grammy Awards in 1991. Also in 1990, Cuban trumpet player Arturo Sandoval defected to the United States and the label immediately signed him and made his debut for the label in 1991 with the album \\"Flight To Freedom\\", his first five solo albums and several other appearances on the label with fellow recording artists such as Dave Valentin, Rene Toledo, Dave Grusin and a well received album dedicated to his best friend, the late Dizzy Gillespie \\"Dream Come True\\", which featured a collaboration with Oscar Winner Michel Legrand and albums such as \\"A GRP Christmas Collection\\", and the \\"GRP All-Star Big Band\\" to name a few until his final album, the critically acclaimed \\"Swingin\\" for the label in 1996. Grusin would also received a third consecutive Academy Award Nomination for the Robert Redford drama, \\"Havana\\" directed by his best friend, Sydney Pollack in which the label released the soundtrack for the film. In 1992, the label celebrated its 10th Anniversary after being formed in 1982 in spectacular fashion as Dave Grusin and Larry Rosen assembled nearly every artist with the exception of singers Diane Schuur and Patti Austin to record the album \\"GRP All-Star Big Band\\" which was recorded in January 1992 and featured prominent jazz artists such as Lee Ritenour, Arturo Sandoval, Eddie Daniels, Tom Scott, Gary Burton, Dave Weckl, Nelson Rangell, among others. The label not only released a CD with bonus tracks, but also they recorded the event which was available on both VHS and LaserDisc. The album and the band proved to be so popular that fans asked for more of the band and seeing them live in concert. They listened to the fans and did a follow-up album called \\"Dave Grusin Presents GRP All-Star Big Band Live!\\" which was released in 1993 based on the tour of the band that featured most of the artist on the original recording in 1992 and some of band members who participated in that recording. They would do one final recording in 1995, \\"All Blues\\" shortly before Grusin and Rosen would leave the label. It was also fitting that the label would also pay homage to their very first release, \\"Glenn Miller Orchestra: In The Digital Mood\\" which started the label and album had become a Gold Record after selling more than a million copies since its release in 1983. The label produced an elaborate \\"Gold Edition\\" featuring a bonus track not on the original release and new special artwork to commemorate the event. The Rippingtons would record their album \\"Live In LA\\" that would feature the popular jazz group in a live setting from their September 1992 concert which was also sold as a video cassette and LaserDisc to coincide with the release of the CD in June 1993. In 1993, the label released Dave Grusin's score to the Tom Cruise thriller \\"The Firm\\" which was based on the John Grisham novel which was a blockbuster hit and the album was a best seller for the label. What made this particular soundtrack unique was that it was an all piano score by Grusin and much to everyone's surprise, received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Score by the Academy Awards branch which added another accolade for the company. \\"The Cure\\" would be his final soundtrack released for the label which came out after his departure in 1995. Also that year, Sergio Salvatore, a young pianist from New Jersey would make his debut on the label. What made this release unique was the fact that Salvatore was only 13 years old at the time the album was recorded and became the youngest artist ever signed to the label. Bernard Wright, who Grusin and Rosen produced in the early 1980s during their logo deal with Arista Records, was their youngest at 16 years old until Salvatore was signed. Grusin and Rosen had seen the child prodigy on the Johnny Carson Show and were highly impressed by his maturity and performance. The label would produce and release his self-titled release \\"Sergio Salvatore\\" during 1993 and his well-received follow up, \\"Tune Up\\" in 1994, which featured many of GRP's artists including Chick Corea, Gary Burton and Russ Freeman until Salvatore left the label after Grusin and Rosen departed and recorded with both Concord Records in 1996 and N2K Encoded Music in 1997, where Grusin and Rosen were both involved with that label in some capacity. In 1994, the label would release the soundtrack to the hit and critically acclaimed documentary film \\"Hoop Dreams\\", which was nominated for Academy Awards and had fallen into a lot controversy about how the film was handled by the Academy voters branch. The label would also pay homage to a few jazz legends in albums recorded by both Dave Grusin and Arturo Sandoval. The albums \\"The Gershwin Connection\\", and \\"Homage To Duke\\" by Grusin and \\"I Remember Clifford\\" by Sandoval were purely jazz albums dedicated to George Gershwin, Duke Ellington and Clifford Brown, where were best sellers for the label and featured elaborate artwork. Also, by this time the label had produced several offshoots that included Stretch Records, Peak Records, and a partnership with MCA in which a few releases by artists such as Laima and Patti Austin were under the GRP/MCA partnership. This did not last long, however. 1995 - Present After founders Dave Grusin and Larry Rosen left the label in early in 1995, famed producer Tommy LiPuma was given the reins of the label with a few of Grusin and Rosen's artists staying on board, including David Benoit, Arturo Sandoval (who would depart in 1997), Lee Ritenour (who would depart in 1996 and return in 2002), The Rippingtons featuring Russ Freeman (who would depart the label in 2000), Gary Burton (who would depart in 1996), Spyro Gyra (who would depart in the late 1990s), Diane Schuur (who would leave after 1997) Tom Scott (who would depart late in the 1990s), Nelson Rangell (who would depart in 1997), Joe Sample (who stayed with the label until his passing), Larry Carlton (who would go onto record with his regular group, Fourplay, and would sign with Warner Bros. Records after 1996), and Ramsey Lewis (who would leave after 1997). Many original or recently signed artists departed, including Dave Valentin (who had recorded fifteen albums for the label from the beginning until 1994), Chick Corea (who left for Concord Music during 1995 after his final release for GRP), Sergio Salvatore, The Yellowjackets, B.B. King, Michael Brecker (whose contract was transferred back to Impulse! Records where he had originally signed during the 1980s), Teodross Avery (who Grusin and Rosen signed in 1993 had his contract transferred to Impulse!), Eddie Daniels (had already left in 1994), Patti Austin, Urban Knights (who would leave for Narada Jazz after 1997) and John Patitucci (who would leave for Concord Music in 1996) among the many artists who were not brought back when their contracts expired. With this turnover, LiPuma brought in some familiar faces and new artists that he felt would keep Grusin and Rosen's vision of the label alive while integrating his own musical ideals. These artists included Grammy Award winners George Benson, Al Jarreau, David Sanborn, Mindi Abair, Keiko Matsui, Marc Antoine, Rick Braun, Chris Botti, Rachel Z, Will Downing, and former New York Yankees outfielder Bernie Williams' debut album as a professional jazz guitarist. This established group of popular jazz artists were the perfect complements to those artists who survived the purge of the label. However, the biggest coup for GRP was signing Grammy Award winning pianist and singer Diana Krall from Impulse!, which gave the label class and stability over the next decade or so. Her popularity had kept the label afloat for a long time (until she eventually signed with Verve in the mid 2000s), along with saxophonist Mindi Abair, who made her debut in 2003 and was an instant hit with smooth jazz fans until leaving the label after 2005, where she has become a major star. Founder Dave Grusin did record a tribute album dedicated to the music of the legendary Henry Mancini entitled Two For The Road in 1996 and released in 1997. This would be the second to last album for the label, with Dave Grusin: Now Playing, a solo piano album dedicated to his music from the films he had composed the music for recorded in 2003 and eventually released in 2004 being his last official release on the label. The label would change its name and moniker to Great Records Period after 1995 under LiPuma's direction since Grusin and Rosen had sold the company in 1990. In later years, the label would take a more commercial direction signing artists like Sarah McLachlan, Ledisi and others to the label which has gone away from its jazz roots.

After splitting from Arista Records to go on their own, Dave Grusin and Larry Rosen, the founders gambled on the format to bring out their spirited high quality recordings to life. From 1983 until 1987, all of their CD releases were pressed by JVC Japan which added impeccable sound and sonic clarity that made the CD's pretty much sell themselves even in audio stores that had to carry the discs to sell with the expensive CD players that were released during this time. The first official album produced and recorded for this purpose was \\"In A Digital Mood\\" featuring the music of the late big band jazz leader, Glenn Miller, which was a high end production recorded in January 1983 for two important reasons. The first was produce an album that would suit the format's sonic capabilities and the second was that the first people who would buy the first CD players would be audiophile fanatics that would be in the range of enjoying this type of music. Grusin and Rosen's intutions were proven right as the album went on to Gold Record status within ten years of its release and had sold over a million copies. The label's original releases were albums that Grusin and Rosen bought or licensed from Arista Records as well as other label's such as Polydor, JVC Japan and Elektra from artists such as Dave Valentin (who was the label's first signing), Lee Ritenour, Tom Browne, Jay Hoggard, Scott Jarrett and Grusin himself. There were plenty of new and fresh album releases by jazz legends Gerry Mulligan and jazz's ambassador Dizzy Gillespie in new sonic, digital settings along with new talent being displayed by the likes of Diane Schuur, Kevin Eubanks, and Special EFX along with veteran drummer Billy Cobham, who would be joined later on by Ritenour, Chick Corea, Eddie Daniels, David Benoit, Gary Burton and Tom Scott to add more diversity to label's roster. The label would sign a distribution deal with MCA in 1987 and it was the final year that the label would have their CD titles pressed by JVC Japan for the US. All titles would be pressed in the US starting in 1988. *GRP-9501 Dave Grusin: NY/LA Dream Band *GRP-9502 Glenn Miller: In a Digital Mood (The first official album produced, recorded and released by the label independently.

They write that he was once a governor of Khorasan and father to Ma'mūn’s Iranian mother, Marjil, which makes him Ma'mūn's grandfather. He claimed he was a prophet of God in the eastern fringe of Khorasan in the mid 8th century and managed to gain followers among the villagers in that area. Many were previously followers of Bihafarid, whom the Abbasid commander, Abu Muslim, crushed militarily.  Reinvigoration of Bihafarid's movement  Ustadh Sis launched a rebellion in 767, purportedly with 300,000 fighting men. His initial base was the mountainous region of Badghis, and he soon occupied Herat and Sistan before marching towards Merv. He initially defeated an Abbasid army under the command of al-Ajtham of Merv, but was himself defeated in a bloody battle against an army led by Muhammad ibn Abdallah, the son of the Caliph al-Mansur (and a future Caliph himself).  Suppression of Ustadh Sis rebellion  According to al-Tabari, 70,000 of Ustadh Sis's followers were killed in the battle, and 14,000 were taken captive. Ustadh Sis managed to flee to the mountains, but the general Khazim ibn Khuzayma al-Tamimi followed him and was able to capture him. Ustadh Sis was sent in chains to Al-Mansur, who ordered his execution. Later, Al-Mahdi gave amnesty to 30,000 captives.

It was named after its commander, Ludwig Adolf Wilhelm von Lützow. The Corpsmen were also widely known as the “Lützower Jäger“ or “Schwarze Jäger“ (“Black Hunters”), sometimes also \\"Lützower Reiter\\" (\\"Lützow Riders\\"). Origins The unit was officially founded in February 1813 as Königlich Preußisches Freikorps von Lützow (Royal Prussian Free Corps von Lützow). Lützow, who had been an officer under the ill-fated Ferdinand von Schill, obtained permission from the Prussian Chief-of-Staff Gerhard von Scharnhorst to organize a free corps consisting of infantry, cavalry, and Tyrolean Jäger (literally, “hunters” ― i.e., marksmen, snipers), for flank attacks and guerrilla warfare behind the French lines. Volunteers were to be drawn from all over Germany (including Austria) to fight against Napoleon I of France; it was hoped that this broadly national force would aid in rallying the smaller German governments into the ranks of the Allies. The Corps has been alleged to have consisted mostly of students and academics; however, in reality these amounted to no more than 12% of the total force, which was actually composed mostly of craftsmen and laborers. Besides the well-known Saxon dramatist and poet Carl Theodor Körner, the Corps also included academics, writers, and other well known figures, such as Georg Friedrich Kersting, Friedrich Friesen, Joseph von Eichendorff, and Friedrich Ludwig Jahn. The educator Friedrich Fröbel, who later developed the concept of the Kindergarten, also belonged to the Lützowers. In addition, at least two women, Eleonore Prochaska and Anna Lühring, had managed to join in disguise. The Tyroleans, whose leaders Jakob Riedl and Joseph Ennemoser had fought with Andreas Hofer for the liberation of Tyrol since 1809, came into the Lützow Corps after the armistice of Summer 1813. Uniforms Free Corps Uniforms: Mounted Jäger and Hussars. Illustration from Uniformenkunde by Richard Knötel Because the Kingdom of Prussia already had problems financing and equipping its regular forces, the volunteers had to equip and supply themselves by their own means. Many times civilian clothing or old uniforms ― even enemy uniforms taken as booty ― were simply dyed. Black was therefore used for their uniforms rather than the normal Prussian blue, because this was the only color that could be used to dye the improvised clothing (if any other had been used, the clothing's original color would have shown through, resulting in an unacceptable mix of colors for the Corps as a whole). The quality of the material often left much to be desired. For similar reasons of economy, a civilian-style trench coat, the so-called litewka or Polish frock coat ― double-breasted, without a tail-slit ― was chosen for infantry and rifle detachments, and later extended to the artillery. The tunic was black, as were the trousers, with red trim chosen for the rank insignia along the collar, cuffs, epaulets, and front edge of the tunic; on officers’ uniforms, collars and cuffs were faced in velvet. On the tunic’s front, eight embossed brass buttons were arranged in two vertical rows. Volunteers with particular skills were allowed to transfer to special units with their own uniforms. Hussars and lancers (uhlans) wore dolman jackets, often brought from their former units, dyed black (as were the hussars’ pelisses). Hussars and lancers wore only black and white, the red being omitted. Officers’ uniforms carried silver cords, rather than white, and were in addition trimmed with black fur. Lützow himself wore the black hussar uniform. Free Corps Uniforms: Musketeer and Tyrolean Jäger. Illustration from Uniformenkunde by Richard Knötel The Tyrolean Jäger retained their previous uniform, gray with green facings. Headgear Due to its improvised nature, headgear worn by the Free Corps was varied. The infantry headgear corresponded to that of Schill’s corps of 1809, consisting of a black shako, with a clasp and side cordon and tassel. The cavalry wore a felt shako (though due to scarce resources, some were made even of cardboard) with a black-and-yellow braid and tassel; often a black oilcloth was worn over them as protection from the weather. For parades cavalry were accustomed to wear a black horsehair tassel and a black cordon. The Tyroleans continued to wear the turned up and plumed hats of their native region. In addition, some volunteers sported peaked caps or even large berets. Often against orders the symbol of a civilian or student society would be attached. In the early days of the Corps, Lützow and others also wore a skull on their headgear (in the same manner as the Duke of Brunswick’s Schwarze Schar), until forbidden by royal command. Combat The Lützow Free Corps distinguished itself from the mass of the army, in that it was a voluntary association, whose members were remarkable for superior activity, energy, and enterprise. Unlike many of the regular army, their loyalty was rather to Germany as a whole than to Prussia or the House of Hohenzollern; many of them made a vow to neither cut their hair nor their beards till they had driven the French entirely out of German lands. Nevertheless, it had the highest percentage of deserters in the Army of Prussia, was treated with marked coolness by the King (who was anything but an ardent nationalist and anyway preferred his regulars), and accomplished relatively little in the way of major military success. The average size of the Corps was 2,900 infantry, 600 cavalry and 120 artillery, varying throughout the war. It fought in many battles, operating first independently in the rear of the French troops, later as a regular unit in the allied armies. The Lützowers displayed great gallantry throughout the remainder of the war, and proved a source of constant annoyance to the French, who regarded them with exceptional hostility, Napoleon himself referring to their chief as ce brigand Lützow, chef du corps de la Vengeance\\" (\\"that bandit Lützow, head of the band of Revenge\\"). At the proclamation of the armistice of 4 June – 13 August 1813, the Corps, eager to gain a dashing victory against the hated emperor, had been deep behind enemy lines and were hastening back to German-held territory (supposedly under a French safe-conduct), when they were caught there in contradiction to the terms of armistice. The French general Fournier ordered an attack on the Corps, replying to a demand for explanation, \\"Armistice pour tout le monde, excepté pour vous!\\" (\\"truce for everyone, except for you\\").Bigelow, Poultney. History of the German Struggle for Liberty. Harper & Brothers (1896). Volume II., pp. 105-107. After the peace of 1814 the Corps was dissolved. The infantry were converted into the 25th Infantry Regiment (from 5 November 1816 known as the 1st Rhine) as regular infantrymen, consisting of 2419 men (82 officers / 2337 troops) organized into a 1st Battalion, 2nd Battalion, and 3rd Battalion, under the command of Christian Friedrich Engel von Petersdorff (who had been a major under Lützow); the cavalry were reorganized into the 6th Ulans under Lützow himself. After Napoleon’s return from Elba, both regiments fought at Ligny and Waterloo during the Hundred Days. The composition of their units remained unique and still bore the impress of the Lützow corps, e.g., retaining the same black litewka and shako. Theodor Körner (Pastel Miniature by Emma Körner, 1813) Theodor Körner Upon hearing that the then Major von Lützow had announced the formation of the Free Corps, on 15 March 1813 Theodor Körner abandoned a promising career as a dramatist in Vienna and his engagement with the beautiful actress Antonie Adamberger. Inspired with the Romantic nationalism of the times, Körner felt himself irresistibly attracted towards a body consisting of volunteers drawn from all over the numerous German realms. On his arrival at Breslau with recommendations to the most influential men in the Prussian army, he joined the Corps on 19 March. As a member of the Corps he contributed songs and poems to celebrate and encourage his fellows, often accompanying himself on the guitar; many of these poems were later published by his father in the collection Leyer und Schwerdt (modern Leier und Schwert, “Lyre and Sword”) (Berlin, 1814). On 26 August an engagement took place at the forest of Rosenow near Gadebusch, in which Körner fell. Theodor Körner died at the age of twenty-one, and was buried under an oak in the village of Wöbbelin, about a mile from Ludwigslust. Legacy Despite its relatively small size and its lack of military success, the Corps became famous after the war, as it was the only unit in the army consisting of people from all over the German states. Throughout the 19th century, these anti-Napoleonic Free Corps were greatly praised and glorified by German nationalists, and a heroic myth built up around their exploits. Inasmuch as many Lützow Free Corps veterans took part in the first Wartburg festival of 1817, demanding German unity and democratic reforms, the black-red-gold color scheme formed by the combination of black cloth, red trim, and brass buttons on their uniforms would later become associated with republican and nationalist (or Pan-German) ideals. During the Hambacher Fest of 1832 and Revolutions of 1848 in the German states, flags with these colors were used, if even often displayed in reverse order compared to modern day's flag of Germany. This combination, reminiscent of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation (whose heraldic coat-of-arms depicted a black eagle on a shield of gold, often in later times with red beak and legs), was selected as the official national colors of the German flag in 1919, and again in 1949. In the aftermath of Germany’s defeat in the First World War, the legend was invoked by extremist groups with far greater emphasis on its nationalism than on republicanism. Consequently, one of the paramilitary Freikorps active in the period of the Weimar Republic took the name “Freikorps Lützow.”Freikorps Lützow in the Axis History Factbook Film The story of the Lützow Free Corps served as the basis for several historical films: * Was Steine erzählen (“What the Stones Tell”) (Germany 1925, directed by Rudolf Randolf) * Lützows wilde verwegene Jagd (“Lützow's Wild Hunt”) (Germany 1927, directed by Richard Oswald) * Theodor Körner (Germany 1932, directed by Carl Boese) * Lützower (German Democratic Republic 1972, directed by Werner W.

La Baigneuse by Alfonse Grebel on Ave. Guy de Maupassant History Situated west of the town of Antibes on the western slope of the ridge, halfway to the old fishery village of Golfe-Juan (where Napoleon landed in 1815), it had been an area with many stone pine trees ( in French), where the inhabitants of Antibes used to go for a promenade, for a picnic in the shadow of the stone pine trees or to collect tree branches and cones for their stoves. The village was given the name Juan-les-Pins on 12 March 1882. The spelling Juan, used instead of the customary French spelling, Jean, derives from the local Occitan dialect. Other names discussed for the town include Héliopolis, Antibes-les-Pins and Albany-les-Pins (after the Duke of Albany, the fourth son of Queen Victoria). The following year, 1883, it was decided to build a railway station in Juan-les-Pins on the Paris-Lyon-Méditerranée (PLM) line that had been there since 1863.

Here to be a global norm means to be an element k of K such that there is an element l of L with \\\\mathbf{N}_{L/K}(l) = k; in other words k is a relative norm of some element of the extension field L. To be a local norm means that for some prime p of K and some prime P of L lying over K, then k is a norm from LP; here the \\"prime\\" p can be an archimedean valuation, and the theorem is a statement about completions in all valuations, archimedean and non-archimedean. The theorem is no longer true in general if the extension is abelian but not cyclic. Hasse gave the counterexample that 3 is a local norm everywhere for the extension {\\\\mathbf Q}(\\\\sqrt{-3},\\\\sqrt{13})/{\\\\mathbf Q} but is not a global norm. Serre and Tate showed that another counterexample is given by the field {\\\\mathbf Q}(\\\\sqrt{13},\\\\sqrt{17})/{\\\\mathbf Q} where every rational square is a local norm everywhere but 5^2 is not a global norm. This is an example of a theorem stating a local-global principle. The full theorem is due to . The special case when the degree n of the extension is 2 was proved by , and the special case when n is prime was proved by . The Hasse norm theorem can be deduced from the theorem that an element of the Galois cohomology group H2(L/K) is trivial if it is trivial locally everywhere, which is in turn equivalent to the deep theorem that the first cohomology of the idele class group vanishes. This is true for all finite Galois extensions of number fields, not just cyclic ones. For cyclic extensions the group H2(L/K) is isomorphic to the Tate cohomology group H0(L/K) which describes which elements are norms, so for cyclic extensions it becomes Hasse's theorem that an element is a norm if it is a local norm everywhere.

History At the time of the Indian Independence Movement, Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi advocated for Akhand Hindustan, a proposition that Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, agreed with, believing that \\"as Britain wanted to retain her empire by pursuing a policy of divide and rule, Hindu-Muslim unity could not be achieved as long as the British were there.\\" In addition, Mazhar Ali Khan wrote that \\"the Khan brothers [were] determined to fight for Akhand Hindustan, and challenged the League to fight the issue out before the electorate of the Province.\\" On 7–8 October 1944, in Delhi, Radha Kumud Mukherjee presided over the Akhand Hindustan Leaders' Conference. The Indian activist and Hindu Mahasabah leader Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, in response to Islamic and European nationalism, propounded the notion of an akhand bharat as well as a Hindu Rashtra ('Hindu Nation'), emphasizing the potential cultural, religious and political unity of Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains throughout the Indian subcontinent 'from Kashmir to Rameshwaram and Sindh to Assam', and the alienation of Indian Muslims and Christians due to their 'spiritual homelands' in the Middle East instead of the Indian subcontinent. Contemporary usage The call for creation of the Akhand Bharat or Akhand Hindusthan has on occasions been raised by Hindu nationalist organisations such as the Hindu Mahasabha, Kakbhusundi Revolutionary Forum (KRF), Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Shiv Sena, Hindu Sena, Hindu Janajagruti Samiti and Bharatiya Janata Party.Yale H. Ferguson and R. J.

Other major Indian political parties such as the left-wing Indian National Congress do not subscribe to a call for Akhand Bharat, although India formally claims the entire region of Kashmir (territorially divided between India, Pakistan and China) as an integral part of India through official maps. Pre-1947 maps of India, showing the modern states of Pakistan and Bangladesh as part of British-occupied India, illustrate the borders of a proto-Akhand Bharat. The creation of an Akhand Bharat is also ideologically linked with the concept of Hindutva (Hinduness) and the ideas of sangathan (unity) and shuddhi (purification) that seek to focus modern Indian politics on a continuous civilizational legacy and heritage of the Indian subcontinent. The Akhand Bharat comprises of modern Day India, Pakistan, Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, Afghanistan, Indonesian Islands and all the coastal countries of Indian Ocean. A 1993 diary of the trade union wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh included a map depicting Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Cambodia as territories that were part of \\"Akhand Bharat\\".

In December 2015, following Narendra Modi's diplomatic visit to Lahore, Pakistan, the BJP National Secretary Ram Madhav (in an interview with Al Jazeera's Mehdi Hassan) described that \\"The RSS still believes that one day [India, Pakistan and Bangladesh], which have for historical reasons separated only 60 years ago, will again, through popular goodwill, come together and Akhand Bharat will be created.\\" In March 2019, RSS leader Indresh Kumar claimed that Pakistan would reunite with India by 2025, that Indians would settle in and migrate to Lahore and Lake Mansarovar in Tibet, that an Indian- allied government had been ensured in Dhaka, and that a European Union-style Akhand Bharat would form. Former Indian Supreme Court Judge Markandey Katju advocated in Pakistani newspaper The Nation that the only solution to the ongoing dispute between India and Pakistan is the reunification of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh under a strong, secular, modern-minded government. He expanded on the reasons for his support for an reunified India in an article for Newslaundry; Katju advocated that such a state would be administered by a secular government. Katju serves as the chairman of the Indian Reunification Association (IRA), which seeks to campaign for this cause. The former Indian Deputy Prime Minister Lal Krishna Advani, in April 2004, similarly endorsed a confederation of the sovereign nations of India and Pakistan as a powerful geopolitical entity rivaling the European Union, United States of America, Russian Federation and People's Republic of China. Hindu nationalist political groups such as Shiv Sena, a former ally of BJP, have sought the reclamation of Pakistan-administered Kashmir under the pretence of akhand bharat, especially after the abrogation of Article 370 and 35A of the Indian constitution (removing the semi-autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir) in August 2019. Following the abrogation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status, some posters in Islamabad displayed a map of an \\"Akhand bharat\\".

It is about 75 kilometres from Cape Town and has a population of slightly over 15,000 people. Since 2000 it has been incorporated into Stellenbosch Municipality. History Franschhoek's original inhabitants are the Khoisan peoples, who continue to live in this place. In 1688, French Huguenot refugees began populating the valley establishing farms and businesses bringing with them their experience in agriculture. The name of the area soon changed to le Coin Français (\\"the French Corner\\"), and later to Franschhoek (Dutch for \\"French Corner\\"), with many of the settlers naming their new farms after the areas in France from which they came.[The Old Buildings of the Cape, Hans Fransen. Jonathan Ball Publishers:Cape Town. p.283] La Motte, Champagne, La Cotte, Cabrière, La Provence, Bourgogne, La Terra de Luc and La Dauphine were among some of the first established farms -- most of which still retain their original Cape Dutch farm houses today. These farms have grown into renowned wineries. Many of the surnames in the area are of French origin, e.g. Du Toit, Marais, Du Plessis, Malan, Malherbe, and Joubert. This heritage is shown today by the Huguenot Monument which stands at the end of the town. The nearby Huguenot Memorial Museum adjacent to the monument explores the history of the French Huguenots who settled in the Cape, and especially in the Franschhoek Valley. On exhibition are the various tools they used to make wine, clothes they wore, and interpretation of their culture and goals. The Cape Dutch architecture in much of the village is unspoiled, as restrictions have been placed on the extent of renovations and new construction in order to preserve the spirit of the original settlers to the area. In 1904, a 28km branch line was built between Paarl and Franschhoek to serve as an alternative to ox-drawn carts for farmers wanting to get their produce to market. Steam locomotives operated along the route until diesel locomotives took over in the 1970s and then, in the 1990s, as the need for rail transport decreased, service along the railway line was discontinued. The branch line was reinstated in 2012Cape Argus - Fran tram to rattle winelandsPaarl Post - Franschhoek wine tram here by a private operator and now sees service as the Franschhoek Wine Tram,Franschhoek Wine Valley - Franschhoek Wine Tram a tourism project utilizing newly constructed double-decker trams modeled after the Blackpool Corporation Tramways Double Deck Balcony Tramcar of circa 1923 to transport tourists between wine estates in the area. Recent developments Once a sleepy country retreat, the village began experiencing a boom in the 1990s, and property prices have sharply increased. The ideal summer weather, snowy peaks in winter and proximity to Cape Town have turned Franschhoek into one of South Africa's most sought after residential addresses. The construction of the new English-medium private Bridge House School outside the village has also attracted many urban dwellers to the village. Franschhoek is notable for having some of the top restaurants in the country within its borders. This fact, together with the strong wine culture, and pristine natural and architectural beauty has made Franschhoek into what many describe as the \\"food and wine capital\\" of South Africa. The city hosts one of the top 50 restaurants in the world, according to the \\"S.Pellegrino world's 50 best restaurants\\"-ranking and a famous Belgian Pâtisserie for Belgian pralines. The attributes of the village have turned Franschhoek into a popular tourist destination, with dozens of bed & breakfasts and small cottages available for accommodation. The shopping experience in Franschhoek is very interesting with several independent boutiques and menswear shops and quality homeware stores. There is even a famous chocolate shop. The art galleries are plentiful and excellent .

He is credited with developing the first commercially available detachable guitar pickup. DeArmond established a working relationship with Horace \\"Bud\\" Rowe, whose Rowe Industries subsequently manufactured and developed pickups and other music- related devices into the 1980s. Early developments DeArmond's younger brother, John, was a budding guitarist at age 10 but wanted to make his guitar louder and better-sounding, and in 1935 created a magnetic pickup using components from the ignition coil of a Ford Model A. Harry DeArmond realized the commercial potential of such a device, and began developing the idea into something commercially feasible. In part to support this undertaking, he founded DeArmond Research, at 4124 Secor Road in Toledo, Ohio (West Toledo), which he operated until the 1960s. One of his early contracts was as a design consultant for small manufacturing firms owned by entrepreneur Horace Rowe, a relationship that lasted through 1975. In 1931, Rowe founded his first company, Fox Electrical and Manufacturing, located at 3120 Monroe Street in Toledo, Ohio. Among other commercial directions, Fox manufactured small electric motors, which required the tooling to create coils of insulated copper wire. DeArmond interested Rowe in turning the company's knowledge of coil winding to the building of guitar pickups. The name was changed to Fox Sound Equipment Corporation in 1935. A pickup-building operation was soon opened. Bud Rowe consolidated his companies in 1940 as Rowe Industries, under which it operated through 1970. The first DeArmond pickups The first RH (\\"round-hole\\") and FH (\\"F-hole\\") guitar microphones were constructed in 1939. \\"Mounted within a metal casing, …six Alnico II pole pieces on a bakelite spool\\" with a coil of 42-gauge copper wire. (That same year, John DeArmond, age 14, hopped a train to California, where he worked as a musician until he was able to join the Navy.) The RH was designed to fit into the opening of a standard (\\"round hole\\") guitar, with a wire clip at one end and two adjustable spring-steel arms at the other, making the device readily removable. To avoid interfering with performance, the device projected only a few millimeters above the soundboard. The FH model had a significantly different appearance. One end of the metal-cased coil assembly fitted onto a 1/8\\" steel rod (called the pressure rod by the manufacturer), itself mounted parallel to the guitar's strings a short span away from the sixth (or \\"low E\\") string; this allowed the player to adjust the pickup's location for preferred tonal character and for minimal interference with performance. The end of the pressure rod was clamped across the strings between the guitar's bridge and tailpiece assemblies. The configuration was soon nicknamed \\"monkey on a stick\\" because of a resemblance to a popular child's toy of the era. As with the RH model, the FH could easily be installed and removed without modification (or damage) to the instrument. Later, an option was offered with a shorter pressure rod intended to be attached to the side of the guitar's neck with two small screws; this provided less interference with the guitarist's right hand as well as an aesthetically \\"cleaner\\" appearance. Each pickup models was offered in a variant — the RHC and FHC respectively — that had a volume-control potentiometer. The FHC-B has a twelve-foot cable but no volume control, being intended for use with a volume pedal. The FHC-C had a volume control (potentiometer) in a small box on the cable, ten inches from the pickup. The pressure-rod pickup design originally used an output cable with a threaded female connector on one end and a 1/4\\" plug on the other, a common configuration for high-impedance microphones of the era. The connector (Amphenol 80-75-MC1F, Switchcraft 2501F) had a knurled coupling ring, which allowed the fitting to attach to a corresponding male-threaded connector on the volume box or \\"module\\" which completed the signal path to the amplifier. The plastic insulation of the cables became stiff or brittle with age, prompting players to repair or replace these themselves in order to keep using the pickup. Eventually, DeArmond replaced the one-piece (twelve-foot) integral cables and the threaded connectors with a 1/8-inch phono jack on the pickup and provided an 1/8\\"-plug-to-1/4\\"-plug cable. The Rhythm Chief DeArmond introduced model 1000, the Rhythm Chief archtop guitar pickup, in 1948. This was followed late 1953 by the model 1100 Adjustable Rhythm Chief with individual polepiece screws and a fancier look (chrome plating, and later, gold plating). The 1100 was presented to the public along with the introduction of the 210, the adjustable-pole soundhole model. Tap-style guitar To promote the sensitivity of his pickups, Harry DeArmond developed a fretboard-tapping technique for guitar performance, creating notes with hammer-on and pull-off rather than picking, and sometimes playing two guitars simultaneously. DeArmond's method was adopted by Jimmie Webster, a designer and demonstrator for Gretsch Guitars. Webster wrote a brief instruction book in 1952, popularized the technique in his travels, and in 1959 recorded an LP, Webster's Unabridged: Jimmie Webster's Stereo Guitar (RCA Victor LPM-1942). The \\"gold foil\\" and 2000 models In the 1950s, with the increasing popular interest in \\"electrified\\" guitars, some manufacturers turned to Rowe Industries rather than expending resources on making their own pickups. As a result, Harry DeArmond is best known for pickups used on inexpensive \\"beginner\\" instruments as well as quality guitars. Most widely distributed were the so-called \\"gold foil\\" pickups, primarily installed in inexpensive Harmony Company guitars. Generally, these have a chrome-plated metal casing, with cut-out shapes (leading to further colloquial naming: diamond, S, moustache, scroll, and more), beneath which was placed a metalized plastic shim, for aesthetic reasons as well as to simply keep dust away from the pickup's inner parts. Being very simple in design, most of these pickups had no height adjustment, and often needed to be installed on some sort of a riser or pedestal to achieve optimum distance from the strings. Though widely scorned for years, these \\"cool\\"-impedance pickups eventually achieved popularity, in part because of the unique tone imparted by the heavy steel mounting plates. (The \\"gold foil\\" pickups were sometimes called \\"Golden Tone\\" pickups in catalogue copy; these should not be confused with the later \\"Goldtone\\" two-coil humbucking pickups.) Among the finest — and most complex — DeArmond pickups were the Model 2000. These are best known for appearing on better models of Gretsch guitars, where they were called the Dynasonic (or sometimes DynaSonic, later renamed the FidelaTone so as not to clash with Rogers Drums over their Dyna-Sonic snare). These feature a moderately complex system of individual polepiece height adjustment, with the result that the steel components account for part of the pickup's unique tonal characteristics. Though Harmony and Gretsch are the best-known DeArmond customers, Rowe Industries pickups (including pressure-rod models) were factory installed by a wide range of other brands. C.F. Martin & Company used DeArmonds on their electrified D-18E and D-28E models. Other brands include Airline, D'Angelico, Eko, Epiphone, Fender, Galanti, Guild, Hofner, Kustom, Levin, Meazzi, Messenger, Micro-Frets, Premier, Silvertone, and Standel. Effects devices and amplifiers In 1941, Rowe Industries introduced the world's first effects unit intended specifically to modify the sound of an electric guitar. The floor-based Model 601 Tremolo ControlPresto Music Times, August 1941 contained a mains-voltage motor that rocked a small sealed bottle fitted with two electrical contacts and containing electrically conductive fluid. The variable frequency of the \\"make and break\\" action of the mechanism created a type of tremolo effect. Bo Diddley and many other artists used this device. A foot-pedal version, the Model 800 Trem Trol followed in 1948, greatly reducing the awkward bulk of the 601. In the early 1960s, Rowe Industries created a line of guitar amplifiers, including a series for C. F. Martin & Company. Seeing a rising market for relatively simple (yet profitable) effects devices, in the later 1960s Rowe increased output of new effects-box models, > the Square Wave Distortion Generator and the DeArmond Wa-Wa pedal. The > DeArmond Weeper… Wa-Wah pedal. …three versions of phase shifters including > the model 1900 Pedal Phasor, the model 1920 Tornado Phase Shifter and the > model 1930 Twister Phase Shifter. Legacy Harry DeArmond retired in 1976, by which time his company had designed and manufactured over 170 different pickups for a wide range of stringed instruments, and many amplifiers and effects units. DeArmond and Rowe each received multiple patents for their various music-related efforts, and for more prosaic work: > During the 1960s, in addition to their music-related products, Rowe > Industries produced components for radar, aerospace and missile defence > systems, including the Nike-Hercules missile, the Nike-X, the Apollo moon > shot and the B-52 communications system. Later use of trade names Around 1998, Fender had acquired interests in various brands, including Guild Guitars and the DeArmond name. Fender launched a line of import Guild guitars in Korea and Indonesia under the DeArmond brand. The better Korean guitars had Dynasonic-style pickups also branded as DeArmond, and made in the United States, but there was no tangible connection to Rowe Industries or Harry DeArmond. The later \\"2K\\" pickups (subsequently appearing on models of Fender guitar) looked cosmetically like the Model 2000 but were just single-coil pickups, as is true of almost all subsequent copies.

He was regarded as one of the leading members of the Tabi'in (d. ca. 712). Sa'īd is held in the highest esteem by scholars of the Shi'a and Sunni Islamic tradition and was considered one of the leading jurists of the time. He also narrated several hadith from Ibn Abbas. Life At the battle of Jamājim in 82 AH (699-701), Ibn al-Ash'ath and his followers, including 100,000 from amongst the mawāli, took on the army of al-Hajjāj (d. 714), the governor of the Iraqi provinces during the reign of the Umayyad caliph al-Walid I. Within their forces was a group known as the 'Battalion of Qur'an Reciters' headed by Kumayl ibn Ziyad an-Nakha\`i and including Sa\`īd ibn Jubayr. The revolt was brutally put down and Sa\`īd was forced to flee to the outskirts of Mecca. He persisted in travelling to Mecca itself twice a year to perform the hajj and \`umrah and would enter Kufa secretly to help resolve peoples' religious issues. Dialogue between Ibn Jubayr and al-Hajjaj Sa'īd was finally apprehended and brought before al-Hajjāj. Excerpts from a transcript of their dialogue follows:Sa'īd ibn Jubayr entered upon al-Hajjāj, who asked his name (and he knew his name well): :Sa'īd: Sa'īd ibn Jubayr. :Al- Hajjaj: Nay, you are Shaqīy ibn Kusayr. (al-Hajjāj is playing with words here: Sa'īd means happy and Shaqī means unhappy; Jubayr means one who splints broken bones and Kusayr means one who breaks them.) :Sa'īd: My mother knew better when she named me. :Al-Hajjāj: You are wretched (shaqīta) and your mother is wretched\\" (shaqiyat). Then he told him: \\"By Allah, I will replace your dunya with a blazing Fire. :Sa'īd: If I knew you could do it, I would take you as a God. :Al-Hajjāj: I have gold and wealth. Bags of gold and silver were brought and spread before Sa'īd ibn Jubayr in order to try him. :Sa'īd: O Hajjāj, if you gathered it to be seen and heard in showing off, and to use it to avert others from the way of Allah, then by Allah, it will not avail you against Him in any way. Saying this, he aligned himself towards Qiblah. :Al-Hajjāj: Take him and turn him to other than the Qiblah. By Allah, O Sa'īd ibn Jubayr, I will kill you with a killing with which I have not killed any of the people. :Sa'īd: O Hajjāj choose for yourself whatever killing you want, by Allah you will not kill me with a killing except that Allah will kill you with a like of it, so choose for yourself whatever killing you like. :Al-Hajjāj: Turn him to other than the Qiblah. :Sa'īd: Wherever you [might] turn, there is the Face of Allah.Qur'an, 2:115 :Al-Hajjāj: Put him under the earth. :Sa'īd: From it (the earth) We created you, and into it We will return you, and from it We will extract you another time.Qur'an, 20:55 Al-Hajjāj was outdone and ordered the beheading of Sa'īd ibn Jubayr. Sa'īd was martyred in the month of Sha'bān, 95 AH (ca. May 714) at the age of 49. Al-Hajjāj is reported to have soon lost his senses and died within a month.

Sa'id was asked by Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan to write a book concerning Quranic exegesis. His exegesis is mentioned by Ibn al-Nadim in his al-Fihrist under Shiite exegeses, without mentioning any other exegesis that is temporally prior to it. His mausoleum is located in al-Hay city in the Wasit Province of Iraq. In Iraq, Rabi' al-Awwal 25 of every year is recognized as the anniversary of Sa'id ibn Jubayr's martyrdom. On this day people congregate in his mausoleum and honor the day. His mausoleum is a pilgrimage site for the Shia Muslims.

Club career Katalinski's career began in a small club Igman based in Ilidža, a suburb of Sarajevo. He was spotted there in 1964 by Željezničar coaches who offered a move to their club's youth system. He accepted the offer immediately and one year later made his first team debut. Katalinski played for Željezničar until 1975, making more than 250 league appearances and, although a defender, scoring 32 league goals. In total, he played more than 350 games for Željezničar, scoring more than 100 goals. He was a part of the team that won the Yugoslav First League in the 1971–72 season. Katalinski decided to go abroad in 1975. Subsequently, he signed a contract with French Ligue 1 club Nice. He played 150 games for Nice before deciding end his career in 1978 at only the age of 30 because of a severe injury. International career As a youngster, Katalinski started playing for junior team of SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, and later for the Yugoslav junior national team (12 caps) and Under-21 national team (18 caps). In 1972, he made his debut for the senior Yugoslav national team. He collected 41 caps and scored 10 goals. One of the most famous moments of his career was a 1974 FIFA World Cup qualification play-off match against Spain at Waldstadion in Frankfurt. Katalinski scored the only goal of the game that secured Yugoslavia a place at the 1974 FIFA World Cup and instantly became a hero of the nation.

Such texts share the general belief of the uniqueness of Japan, and the term nihonjinron can be employed to refer to this outlook. The concept became popular after World War II, with books and articles aiming to analyze, explain, or explore peculiarities of Japanese culture and mentality, usually by comparison with those of Europe and the United States. The literature is vast, ranging over such varied fields as sociology, psychology, anthropology, history, linguistics, philosophy, biology, chemistry and physics so in addition to the common generic word nihonjinron, a variety of topical subgenres exist, divided up by specific theme or subject-matter. For example: * : \\"new theories on climate\\" (implying the influence of climate on peoples) * : \\"theories on Japanese culture\\" * : \\"theories on Japanese society\\" * : \\"theories on Japan\\" * : \\"theories on the Japanese economy\\" Books written by non-Japanese authors may also be classed as nihonjinron, if they share, contribute to, or reflect the vision, premises, and perspectives characteristic of the Japanese genre. History Hiroshi Minami, one of the foremost scholars of the genre, states in his survey: The roots of the nihonjinron be traced back at least to the kokugaku (\\"national studies\\") movement of the 18th century, with themes that are not dissimilar to those in the post-war nihonjinron. Early themes The problem of Japanese identity in much of the early period is in terms of the local traditions and the powerful influence of Chinese culture, for example the revolt of the anti- Buddhist Mononobe and Nakatomi clans against the pro-Buddhist Soga clan, which had sponsored the introduction of not only Buddhist metaphysics but also Chinese statecraft into Japan in the 6th century. Later, Kitabatake Chikafusa (1293–1354) wrote his Jinnō Shōtōki (\\"Chronicles of the Authentic Lineages of the Divine Emperors\\") which defines Japan's superiority in terms of the divinity of its imperial line and the divinity of the nation itself (Shinkoku). The general drift of such works is to pull the abstract, universal language and thought of Japan's foreign models down to earth, to reframe it in Japanese conditions, among the illiterate population at large, and assert the special historical characteristics of Japan as opposed to the civilizations which had, until that time, endowed the country with the lineaments of a universalist culture.Dale, Peter N. 'Nipponologies (Nihon-ron. Nihon-shugi)', 1994 p. 355 In the 16th century European contacts with Japan gave rise to a considerable literature by travelers and foreign missionaries on the Japanese, their culture, behavior, and patterns of thinking. In turn this had some impact on Japanese self-images, when this material began to be read by many Japanese after the Meiji Restoration; and this tradition of cross-cultural discourse forms an important background component in the rise of the modern nihonjinron. Kokugaku Kokugaku, beginning as a scholarly investigation into the philology of Japan's early classical literature, sought to recover and evaluate these texts, some of which were obscure and difficult to read, in order to appraise them positively and harvest them to determine and ascertain what were the original indigenous values of Japan before the introduction of Chinese civilization. Thus the exploration of early classical texts like the Kojiki and the Man'yōshū allowed scholars of Kokugaku, particularly the five great figures of Keichū (1640–1701), Kada no Azumamaro (1669–1736), Kamo no Mabuchi (1697–1769), Motoori Norinaga (1730–1801) and Hirata Atsutane (1776–1843)Minamoto Ryōen, Tokugawa Shisō Shōshi, Chūkō Shinsho, Tokyo 1973 p. 178, corrects the traditional figure of four great founders, which excluded Keichū to explore Japan's cultural differences with China, locate their sources in high antiquity, and deploy the results in a programmatic attempt to define the uniqueness of Japan against a foreign civilization. These scholars worked independently, and reached different conclusions, but by the 19th century were grouped together by a neo-Kokugakuist named Konakamura to establish the earliness of Japanese self-awareness.Susan L. Burns. Before the Nation. Duke University Press, 2003. p. 199. Implicitly or otherwise, they advocated a return to these ostensibly pristine ethnic roots, which involved discarding the incrustations of those Chinese cultural beliefs, social rites and philosophical ideas that had exercised a political ascendancy for over a millennium within Japan and had deeply informed the neo-Confucian ideology of the Tokugawa regime itself. The irony was that the intellectual techniques, textual methods and cultural strategies used by nativist scholars against Confucianism borrowed heavily from currents in both Chinese thought (Taoist, Confucian and Buddhist) and their Japanese offshoots. Motoori, the greatest nativist scholar, is deeply indebted, for instance, to the thought of Ogyū Sorai the most penetrating Confucian thinker of Tokugawa times. In similar wise, scholars detect in modern Japanese nationalism, of which the nihonjinron are the resonant if melodiously subdued, post-war echo, many features that derived from borrowings abroad, from the large resources of cultural nationalism mined in European countries during their own respective periods of nation-formation. Under the alias of assertions of difference, nationalisms, in Japan as elsewhere, borrow promiscuously from each other's conceptual hoards, and what may seem alien turns out often to be, once studied closely, merely an exotic variation on an all too familiar theme. Meiji period In the second half of the 19th century, under strong military and diplomatic pressure, and suffering from an internal crisis that led to the collapse of the Bakufu, Japan opened its ports, and subsequently the nation, to commerce with the outside world and reform that sought to respond vigorously to the challenges of modern industrial polities, as they were remarked on by Japanese observers in the United States and Europe. The preponderant place of China as model and cultural adversary in the cognitive models developed hitherto was occupied by the West. But, whereas Japan's traditional engagement with Chinese civilization was conducted in terms of a unilateral debate, now Japanese scholars and thinkers could read directly what Westerners, themselves fascinated by the 'exoticism' of Japanese culture, said and wrote of them. Japanese contact with, and responses to these emerging Western stereotypes, which reflected the superiority complex, condescension and imperial hauteur of the times, fed into Japanese debates on national identity. As Leslie Pincus puts it, speaking of a later phase: There ensued an intense period of massive social and economic change, as, under the direction of a developmental elite, Japan moved from the closed world of centuries of Tokugawa rule (the so-called sakoku period) to Meiji Westernization, and, again in close conformity with the prevailing occidental paradigm, to imperialist adventurism with the growth of the colonialism. The Taishō period marked a slightly more 'liberal' turn, as the pendulum swung towards a renewed interest in the Western model (\\"Japan must undergo a second birth, with America as its new mother and France as its father\\"). With the crisis of 1929 and the concomitant depression of the 1930s, militarism gained the upper hand in this era of the , and nationalistic ideologies prevailed over all attempts to keep alive the moderate traditions of liberal modernity. Postwar period Total economic, military and spiritual mobilization could not stave off defeat however, and slowly, under occupation, and then rapidly with its reasserted independence, Japan enjoyed a decades-long resurgence as global industrial and economic powerhouse until the crisis of the 1990s. The cultural patterns over this century long trajectory is one of a continuous oscillation between models of pronounced Westernization and traditionalist autarky. Between the two alternatives, attempts were frequently made to mediate a conciliatory third way which would combine the best of both worlds: .Cf. Hirakawa Sukehiro (平川祐弘), Wakon Yōsai no keifu, Kawade Bungei Shinsho,1976 passim The frequency of these chronic transitional upheavals engendered a remarkable intensity of debate about national directions and identity ( kokuminsei; minzokusei), whose complexity over time renders a synthetic judgment or bird's-eye view of the literature in question rather difficult. A major controversy surrounds the question regarding the affiliation of the post-war nihonjinron theories with the prewar conceptualization of Japanese cultural uniqueness. To what degree, that is, are these meditations under democracy on Japanese uniqueness innocent reflections of a popular search for identity, and in what measure, if any, do they pick up from the instrumental ideology of Japaneseness developed by the government and nationalists in the prewar period to harness the energies of the nation towards industrialization and global imperium? The questions are rendered more complex by the fact that in the early post-war period, the restoration of a 'healthy nationalism' was by no means something exclusive to right-wing cultural thinkers. An intense debate over the necessity to develop ideal, positive forms of national consciousness, regarded as a healthy civic identity, figures prominently in the early writings of Maruyama Masao, who called for a healthy , and in the prolific debates of members of the who preferred to speak of . These debates ranged from liberal center-left critics to radical Marxist historians.Curtis A Gayle, Marxist History and Postwar Japanese Nationalism 2003 Some scholars cite the destruction of many Japanese national symbols and the psychological blow of defeat at the end of World War II as one source of nihonjinron's enduring popularity, although it is not a uniquely 20th century phenomenon. In fact the genre is simply the Japanese reflex of cultural nationalism, which is a property of all modern nations. The trend of the tone of nihonjinron argument is often reflective of the Japanese society at the time. Peter N. Dale, covering the period analysed by the Nomura survey, distinguished three major phrases in the development of post-war nihonjinron discourse: *First phase (1945–1960): Dominance of the Western model with a concomitant repudiation of Japanese specificity. *Second phase (1960–1970): Recognition of historical relativity, of certain defects in Western industrial society, and certain merits in Japanese traditions, as they are re-engineered in Japanese modernization. *Third phase (1970–?): Recognition of Japanese specificity as a positive model for a uniquely Japanese road towards modernity and its global outreach.Dale, The Myth of Japanese Uniqueness, 1986 p. 213 Tamotsu Aoki subsequently finessed the pattern by distinguishing four major phases in the post war identity discourse.Aoki 1990 p. 29 In Dale's proposal, this drift from negative uniqueness to positive evaluation of uniqueness is a cyclical trend, since he believes the same pattern can be detected in the literature on identity for the period from 1867 to 1945, from early Meiji times down to the end of World War Two. Nihonjinron, in Dale's view, recycle prewar Japanese nationalist rhetoric, and betray similar ends. For Aoki, contrariwise, they are natural movements in a national temper which seeks, as has been the case with other nations, its own distinctive path of cultural autonomy and social organization as Japan adapts itself to the global world order forged by the West. During the early post-war period, most of nihonjinron discourses discussed the uniqueness of the Japanese in a rather negative, critical light. The elements of feudalism reminiscent of the Imperial Japan were all castigated as major obstacles to Japan's reestablishment as a new democratic nation. Scholars such as Hisao Ōtsuka, a Weberian sociologist, judged Japan with the measure of rational individualism and liberal democracy that were considered ideals in the U.S. and Western European nations back then.Sugimoto & Mouer, Images of Japanese Society 1986 pp. 70-71 By the 1970s, however, with Japan enjoying a remarkable economic boom, Ōtsuka began to consider the 'feudal residues' in a positive light, as a badge of Japan's distinctive difference from the West (Ōtsuka, Kawashima, Doi 1976 passim). Nihonjinron books written during the period of high economic growth up to the bubble burst in the early 1990s, in contrast, argued various unique features of the Japanese as more positive features. Specific theses # The Japanese race is a unique isolate, having no known affinities with any other race. In some extreme versions, the race is claimed to be directly descended from a distinct branch of primates.(1)Watanabe Shōichi, Nihongo no kokoro, Kōsansha Gendai Shinsho, Tokyo 1954.pp.11f (2) Oguma Eiji, Tan'itsu minzoku shinwa no kigen, Shin'yōsha, Tokyo 1995 # This isolation is due to the peculiar circumstances of living in an cut off from the promiscuous cross-currents of continental history, with its endless miscegenation of tribes and cultures. The island country in turn enjoys a whose peculiar rhythms, the putative fact for example that Japan alone has , color Japanese thinking and behaviour. Thus, human nature in Japan is, peculiarly, an extension of nature itself.(1) Watsuji Tetsurō, Fūdo, Iwanami Shoten 1935 passim; (2)Dale, Myth of Japanese Uniqueness, ibid. pp.43f. # The Japanese language has a unique grammatical structure and native lexical corpus whose idiosyncratic syntax and connotations condition the Japanese to think in peculiar patterns unparalleled in other human languages. The Japanese language is also uniquely vague.Morimoto, Tetsurō (森本哲朗) Nihongo Omote to Ura (日本語表と裏) (\\"Japanese inside and outside\\") Shinchōsha Tokyo 1985 Foreigners who speak it fluently therefore, may be correct in their usage, but the thinking behind it remains inalienably soaked in the alien framework of their original language's thought patterns. This is the Japanese version of the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, according to which grammar determines world-view.(1)Suzuki Takao, Kotoba no ningengaku, Shinchō Bunko, Tokyo 1981.pp.109ff;(2) Itasaka Gen, Nihongo yokochō, Kōdansha Gakujutsu Bunko, Tokyo 1978 pp.69ff; (3)Kawashima Takeyoshi in Ōtsuka Hisao, Kawashima Takeyoshi, Doi Takeo, 'Amae' to shakai kagaku, Kōbundō, Tokyo 1978 p.29 #Japanese psychology, influenced by the language, is defined by a particular cast of that conduce to a unique form of , in which clearly defined boundaries between self and other are ambiguous or fluid, leading to a psychomental and social ideal of the .Dale, Myth of Japanese Uniqueness, ibid. ch.7,8 pp.116-175, ch.12 pp.201ff. # Japanese social structures consistently remould human associations in terms of an archaic characterized by , , and . As a result, the cannot properly exist, since will always prevail.Dale, Myth of Japanese Uniqueness, ibid. ch.7 pp.100ff As cultural nationalism Scholars such as Peter N. Dale (1986), Harumi Befu (1987), and Kosaku Yoshino (1992) view nihonjinron more critically, identifying it as a tool for enforcing social and political conformity. Dale, for example, characterizes nihonjinron as follows: The emphasis on ingroup unity in nihonjinron writings, and its popularization during Japan's period of military expansion at the turn of the 20th century, has led many Western critics to brand it a form of ethnocentric nationalism.

It was a two-door, four-seat estate design, related to the Ford Prefect 100E four-door saloon, sharing the same Ford sidevalve engine and other parts and the same interior trim. It was substantially shorter than both the Prefect and the closely related Ford Anglia 100E two-door saloon. It used the short front doors of the four-door model because the bodyshell was optimized for use as a panel van (which was marketed as the Thames 300E). The rear door was in two pieces split horizontally. The rear seat could be folded flat to convert from a four-seater to a load carrier. Until 1957 there were wood trim pieces screwed to the sides of the vehicle. The Squire competed in the same market segment as the Hillman Husky and Austin A30 / A35 based estate, both significantly more popular in the UK than longer estates at the time. Total production was 17,812 cars. British magazine The Motor tested a Squire in 1955, recording a top speed of , 0- in 20.2 seconds, and a fuel consumption of . The test car (with the optional heater) cost £668, including taxes. Ford Escort The Ford Escort was a mechanically identical estate car with the lower trim level of the Ford Anglia. This proved more popular, and a total of 33,131 Escorts were produced between 1955 and 1961. Production of the Escort continued until 1961, two years longer than the Squire. The Escort name was later used by Ford of Europe in 1968 on another small car, and a North American variant was introduced in 1980. A less expensive variant of the Ford Squire was branded as the Ford Escort.
