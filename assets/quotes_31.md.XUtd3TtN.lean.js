The son of wealthy art collectors, he managed The Phillips Collection, a museum founded by his parents. Under his leadership, the museum increased its collection, underwent expansion projects and received substantial financial support. Prior to his career as a museum director, Phillips served during World War II, worked as an analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and co-founded a local magazine. Early life Laughlin Phillips, nicknamed Loc, was born in Washington, D.C. in 1924, the son of Duncan Phillips, an art collector and critic, and Marjorie Acker Phillips, a painter. He had one sibling, Mary Marjorie, born in 1922, who contracted encephalitis at a young age and was institutionalized. According to Phillips, \\"she was severely brain damaged and never got beyond being four years old.\\" Phillips was named after his great- grandfather, James H. Laughlin, co-founder of the Jones and Laughlin Steel Company and chair of the Pittsburgh National Bank (a precursor to PNC Financial Services). Three years prior to Phillips' birth, Duncan and Marjorie founded the Phillips Memorial Gallery, the United States' first museum of modern art. The museum was located in the Phillips' home, a Georgian Revival house in Dupont Circle where Laughlin spent his early childhood. In 1930, the family moved to another house, Dunmarlin, a mansion on Foxhall Road NW designed by architect John Russell Pope, to increase the museum's gallery space. During his childhood, Dunmarlin was a noted meeting place for diplomats, politicians and artists. Phillips attended special events and exhibits, including a photography exhibit where his own work was displayed. He was chauffeured each day to St. Albans School, an elite private school where he graduated in 1942. Career Following his graduation, Phillips attended Yale University, his father's alma mater, for one year before serving in World War II. He was an Army intelligence officer in the Pacific theater and earned a Bronze Star Medal. After the war, Phillips attended the University of Chicago using benefits provided by the G.I. Bill. He began working for the CIA after earning a Master of Philosophy degree. Around this time Phillips married Elizabeth Hood with whom he had two children, Duncan and Liza. The couple later divorced and he married his second wife, Jennifer Stats Cafritz. While working for the CIA, Phillips was stationed in several locations, including Saigon and Tehran. He left the CIA and in 1965 co-founded the Washingtonian magazine, a venture with his former college roommate and CIA colleague, Robert J. Myers. Following his father's death in 1966, Phillips began serving as board chairman of the museum. His mother was the director of the museum until 1972, when Phillips assumed the role. He sold his stake in the magazine in 1979 to devote all of his time to The Phillips Collection, at the time a \\"deteriorating jewel box of a museum\\", calling it \\"a family responsibility.\\" During his tenure as director of The Phillips Collection, Phillips \\"administrative skill helped guide\\" the museum into a \\"far more financially stable position.\\" He oversaw the expansion of the museum's collection, including key purchases of works by Pierre Bonnard, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso and Jackson Pollock. Phillips also oversaw the expansion of the museum's facilities, including a renovation in 1983 and the addition of the Goh Annex in 1989, doubling the museum's space. He \\"supervised multi-million dollar fundraising campaigns, starting charging admission, established corporate and personal membership programs, and sought arts endowment grants that the museum had seldom if ever pursued.\\" Phillips worked for fifteen years to help establish the museum's Center for the Study of Modern Art, \\"an interdisciplinary forum for scholarly discussion, research, and publication on issues of production.\\" For his successful efforts at improving the museum, Phillips was named a \\"Washingtonian of the Year\\" by Washingtonian magazine. He retired as museum director in 1992, and for the first time in its history, the museum was managed by someone other than a Phillips family member. Later years Phillips continued serving as the museum's chairman of the board until March 2002. He and his wife, Jennifer, moved to Washington, Connecticut, a few years before his death in 2010 from prostate cancer. The couple had previously lived in Georgetown, in a home on O Street NW, after the Phillips estate, Dunmarlin, was purchased by a wealthy Saudi Arabian businessman and demolished.

For this purpose a separate plot of Regency Park was bought, located at 20 Gda≈Ñska Street, in the immediate vicinity of St Peter's and St Paul's Church. The construction lasted two years (1886-1887) and eventually cost 1400,000 Marks, while it was initially estimated at 97,000 Marks. The building was designed by architect Gustav Reichert, in the style of German Historicism, referring to classicism forms. In 1908, the southern part of the two-storey building was extended on the basement dependence and its own entrance. The builder was Emil Haydemann, master bricklayer: on the ground-floor the extension comprised a brick wing with its own entrance, covered with a lean-to roof. The activities in the Society House were run until June 1939, focused on the organization of social and cultural life (art and science) of German elite. The building, in 1902, was also used by the German Society of Arts and Sciences in Bydgoszcz,Zeitschrift der Naturwissenschaftlichen Abteilung der Deutschen Gesellschaft f√ºr Kunst und Wissenschaft in Posen (Naturwissenschaftlicher Verein) : zugl. Organ der Abteilung f√ºr Naturwissenschaften in Bromberg / Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Kunst und Wissenschaft in Posen-published Posen : [s.n.], 1902 - 1914 trade merchants, singing bands. In December 1904, the Jubilee celebration of the Bromberg Horse Grenadier Regiment was held in the Society House, attended personally by Emperor Wilhelm II. Interwar period During interwar, the building was still property of \\"Deutsche Kasinogesellschaft\\" and was a cultural and entertainment center. A stylish garden area was located on the north of the place, for caf√© and concerts. The facility was used till 1934 by residents from all socio-cultural societies, regardless of their nationality. In the 1920s, the director Meinhard opened at Gdanska 19 a small movie theatre called Apollo Central Theater - . As a result, Polish branch of the Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts installed its seat in the building on September 1, 1921, and started presenting exhibitions of contemporary graphics and sculpture. It also held concerts by Bydgoszcz Music Society, Bydgoszcz Conservatory of Music () and Municipal Conservatory of Music (). Choirs from both Polish school children and German speaking schools happened there. Among many concerts in the edifice hall, one was played by pianist Feliks Szymanowski, then Bydgoszcz resident, brother of composer Karol Szymanowski.Pruss Zdzis≈Çaw, Weber Alicja, Kuczma Rajmund: Bydgoski leksykon muzyczny. Kujawsko-Pomorskie Towarzystwo Kulturalne Bydgoszcz 2004 City orchestra, chamber ensembles and soloists from Pozna≈Ñ, Gda≈Ñsk or Berlin have been presented in the garden. After accession to power of Hitler in Germany, the attitude of German authorities in Bromberg hardened, and forbade activities of Polish organizations in the building, which exclusively served German and Nazi organizations. Anti-Polish activity by the German minority was re-aroused by the decision of the Polish municipal authorities on 15 June 1939 to close the Society House and rename it to \\"Social House\\" (): the announcement was met with violent protests in Bydgoszcz by German and Nazi partisans. Pomeranian Arts House In 1945, thanks to the artist Marian Turwid, then President of the Pomeranian branch of the Association of Polish Artists and Designers, the building was dedicated to Arts. Polish art expert Jerzy Remer, on behalf of the Commission for Reconstruction supervised the work on the building. On May 7, 1946, during the celebration of the 600th anniversary of the city of Bydgoszcz, has been unveiled the Pomorski Dom Sztuki (Pomeranian Arts House): it housed a concert hall, a permanent showroom for arts -BWA (), a local club for Arts associations and a Plastic Arts Centre (). The building was the seat of Pomeranian Art workshops for writers, musicians and artists from all domains.Prus Zdzis≈Çaw, Weber Alicja: Bydgoski leksykon operowy Kujawsko- Pomorskie Towarzystwo Kulturalne Bydgoszcz 2002. Between 1945 and 1982, the premises were mainly used by Leon Wycz√≥≈Çkowski's State School of Art established in 1945, which has been directed by Marian Turwid from 1945 to 1972. The Pomeranian Arts House also hosted the Pomeranian Symphony Orchestra from 1946 to 1953. In addition, until the construction of Polish Theatre in Bydgoszcz in 1949, many events took place in the edifice. In 1956, the Bydgoszcz Opera company was established there. Over the next years, the building had many users, but was never really suited for the musical theater business. As a consequence, in 1956, the project of remodeling the building and adapt it to the needs of the opera was studied. Architects planned to build a scene with the necessary elements, an auditorium for 600 people and to create a moat for the orchestra, by extending the Arts House the East, on a plot from the Park Casimir the Great. This study failed due to technical and financial resources it required: it had been calculated that reconstruction would cost as much as 50% of the cost of construction of a brand new building. Thus emerged the idea of erected an independent, modern opera house building in the bend of the Brda river. In 1965, once the permanent showroom for arts -BWA has been constructed, the southern wing built in 1908 was demolished. From 1972, the building housed a small stage of Opera Nova, while larger performances (operas, operettas and ballets were held in Polish Theatre in Bydgoszcz. After 1982, with Leon Wycz√≥≈Çkowski's State School of Art moving to a building at Konarski street, the City Opera became the sole legal owner of the Pomeranian Arts House. Building of the Bydgoszcz Music Academy - \\"Feliks Nowowiejski\\" In 2006, the edifice has been taken over by the Bydgoszcz Music Academy - \\"Feliks Nowowiejski\\". Since 2008, the facility is being modernized to fit the needs of the Academy of Music: * the basement houses warehouses for instruments, dressing rooms and technical rooms; * the ground floor is occupied by a 100-seats concert hall with room with room for orchestra and choir; * upstairs are located classrooms. Architecture The edifice is a detached, two-storey building with basement, and has got the characteristics of classicism. The facades are characterized by a uniform and scare use of architectural details, putting the accent on horizontal and vertical layouts. They have been designed on a bossage decorated pedestal and cornice-topped with a chain pattern. The building front part is an avant- corps, topped by a gable with a triangle tympanum. Avant-corps corners are pilaster-shaped. The top floor of front elevation has attic style balustrade. At the gable top is placed a lyre, symbolizing music and poetry, in relation with the cultural function of the building. Building interiors originally comprised a main concert hall and a ballroom. At the beginning of the 20th century, the hall room had 9-metre-high loggias and galleries: it could accommodate a thousand people. Upstairs, the building housed a small auditorium on the first floor, a library, club rooms, a restaurant and wine cellar. Little of the original design has survived in today's layout. The building has been put on the Pomeranian heritage list (N¬∞601297-Reg.A/1116) on 18 November 1993.

Initially available with a twin-cylinder engine in the original MULE 1000 model, the range has grown and been gradually updated over the years, and now includes both petrol and diesel variants. History In 1988, the first Kawasaki MULE was introduced in the form of the MULE 1000; it featured a water-cooled twin- cylinder engine, which was fitted to an open-cab utility vehicle chassis. The MULE 1000 also featured a continuously variable transmission (CVT), independent suspension at the front and rear and a locking rear differential. The MULE 2010 was introduced in 1989, and featured a larger engine, a high/low CVT transmission, selectable four-wheel-drive and a De Dion rear suspension. 1990 saw the introduction of three new MULEs; the 2020, which was designed for golf courses and used a fan-cooled single-cylinder engine, the 2030, which was designed for industrial work, and the compact 500 model with a single seat. The MULE 2500 series was introduced in 1992 and featured a new V-twin engine with a fan cooled CVT. The 2500 series also featured four wheel self-adjusting hydraulic brakes and introduced a high mounted air intake system for the engine and transmission that drew air through the rear cab frame tubes.Kawasaki MULE 2510/MULE 2520 Utility Vehicle Service Manual, third edition pp. 15-8 The two-seat compact model 550 followed in 1996 and a turf version of that model, known as the 520, followed in 1999. The first diesel MULE with a three-cylinder engine was introduced in 1999 as part of the 2500 series. The MULE 3000 series arrived the following year, combining the 2500 series' V-twin petrol engines with a new continuously variable transmission and featuring new \\"pick-up truck\\" styling incorporating a storage compartment under the hood; a diesel version followed in 2003. 2005 saw the introduction of a four-seat version of the 3000 series and the compact 600 series, which featured an upgraded suspension, a engine, and new \\"high volume\\" bodywork similar to the 3000 series. In 2009, the 4000 series followed, with both petrol and diesel versions being available.

It was for a long time the only private journalism school in the entire Nordic region; only Germany and the USA at that time had similar private schools. Although there was a lack of educated journalists there was initial hesitation to the Poppius initiative, due to a belief that journalism could only be learnt through experience, not taught. Set Poppius started the school with his wife Ebba. Set was the school manager and teacher while his wife was responsible for the school's finances. The school soon developed a good reputation amongst journalists, and many praised the school such as Majgull Axelsson, Caroline √Ñlvebrink Calais, Beppe Wolgers, Svante Foerster, Carl Otto Werkelid, Malou von Sivers, Mona Krantz, Hans Nestius, Mats Lundeg√•rd, Sten Hedman, Magdalena Ribbing, Kristin Kaspersen, Fredrik Lindstr√∂m and Carolina Neurath.

Nielsen's winning time was 8:18.3; as a world record, it was officially ratified as 8:18.4, since the IAAF's rules required times at the distance to be rounded up to the next fifth of a second. Later that year, Nielsen won bronze in the 10,000 m at the inaugural European Championships in Turin, losing only to Finland's Ilmari Salminen and Arvo Askola; he was Denmark's only medalist in the meet. Nielsen competed in the 1936 Summer Olympics in the 5000 m, but failed to qualify from the heats.

The squadron was initially equipped with three Ilyushin 38 aircraft and later two more IL 38 aircraft were inducted. With the induction of the IL 38s, the Navy acquired modern maritime reconnaissance and fixed-wing Anti Submarine Warfare(ASW) capability. In January 1978, the squadron aircraft using the on board Magnetic Anomaly Detector (MAD) equipment successfully located the wreckage of the ill-fated Air India Jumbo which had crashed soon after take-off off the Mumbai coast. The Winged Stallions added yet another feather to their cap when they completed 25000 hours of accident free flying in 1996. With the Mid Life Update of the IL 38 SD (Sea Dragon) being completed in 2009 the Winged Stallions are set to gallop their way to further glory in the coming years.

It uses the V4 engine from the Honda VFR1200. It is the Ariel marque's first new motorcycle in more than 50 years. Design Ariel Atom sports car with similar exposed frame Ariel has a \\"long-standing relationship with Honda\\", who were sufficiently impressed with Ariel's Atom sports car to allow them to use their VFR engine in the Ace. The V4 engine is suspended from \\"a huge, bridge-like aluminium frame\\" that resembles a trellis frame in appearance. Trellis frames are usually fabricated from welded tubes, such as on the Ducati Monster, as well as for the chassis of the Atom. The Ace's frame, however, is not made from welded steel tube; rather the frame sides are machined from a solid aluminium billet. This gives the frame's diagonal stiffeners their distinctive triangular vee section, rather than the usual round-section tube. The Ariel Ace comes with a choice of two alternative front suspensions; either a conventional upside-down telescopic fork or Ariel's own girder fork. Rear suspension uses a single-sided swingarm. The final-drive is a shaft-drive. An unusual feature is that the rider's knees do not grip a shaped fuel tank; instead, one's knees are alongside the frame, which is rather less comfortable. Customization Bikes can be ordered from the factory with various options, and upgraded over time. Options include front and rear suspension, handlebars, bodywork, fuel tank size, exhaust, wheels, seat, footrests, colors and finishes. Reception Roland Brown, writing in The Daily Telegraph, concludes that the Ace is a \\"dramatically styled, cleverly engineered and enjoyably powerful V4 roadster that returns the renowned Ariel marque to motorcycling in impressive fashion\\". Jensen Beeler, writing in Asphalt and Rubber, dubbed it \\"the most expensive Honda you will ever come across\\" noting its exclusivity. Loz Blain in Gizmag called it \\"one of the best looking motorcycles I've ever seen\\", also noting the price puts it out of reach for many riders. Gizmag and Jalopnik both noted the unique customization options available to create a cruiser, fully faired sportbike, or naked bike around a common frame and powertrain; the latter publication called it an \\"adult Lego set\\". A review in Road & Track compared the design to that of the Atom sports car, calling it \\"purposeful\\" but \\"not particularly pretty\\".

History In 1896, a Dublin jeweller, Mr. Samuel Waterhouse, presented the Donore Harriers club with a silver shield for a 10-mile handicap cross-country race. The shield was known as the 'Donore Harriers Waterhouse Challenge Shield'. This race now known as the Waterhouse Byrne Baird Shield has been competed for every year, except 1916, since then, on St. Stephen‚Äôs Day (26 December). The race starts and finishes every year at the same tree beside the Dog Pond on the horse gallop in the Phoenix Park, Dublin, Ireland. The shield has to be won three times by the same person in order for the trophy to be claimed as the property of any one individual. In 1919, P.J. Byrne, after winning the trophy three times, re-presented the trophy to the club, and the same thing happened when Davie Baird similarly had three victories. A Mr. Uhlemann has also won the trophy three times overall, but two of those occasions occurred after Mr. Baird managed to achieve immortality and add his name to the trophy; thereby resetting the clock for all other previous winners who had to begin again in their quest to win it three times to get their name added to the ‚Äôshield name‚Äô. The closest finish was in 1962, when Leo Lynch got to finish less than one yard/metre ahead of the fast finishing scratch man Mick Neville. Earlier that year in January & February Neville became the only athlete ever to win all four individual Irish Cross Country Championships: AAU and IAAB Senior and Junior/Intermediate.

It is the Donore Harriers Club Cross Country Championships Cup. Since 2017, Donore women compete on the same day for the Jim McNamara Cup. Faugh-a- Ballagh Cup The course traditionally takes in the horse gallop trail, which runs adjacent to Chesterfield Avenue in the Phoenix Park. It turns close to the stone wall, which is in the clearing at the end of the gallop & with the Pope's Cross in view. It turns back entering the inside part of the tress at the top of the Kyber before emerging through the open ground with its numerous dips, heading in the direction of the Civil Service Pavilion; where loops around again to the Horse Gallop. The Faugh-a-Ballagh Cup which was first awarded in 1907 to the senior men's winner, is one of the oldest trophies in Donore Harriers; and club trophies in Ireland. It was presented by the 87th Royal Irish Fusiliers in 1907 as a perpetual trophy for the men's club cross country championship over 6 miles. The first running of the cup took place in Meadowbrook, Dundrum. A report from the time stated that there was \\"a big gathering of spectators, including many old associates of the club foregathered to witness what turned out to be a very interesting event...\\" It goes on to give at length to give details of the race, including that, '\\"V.P. McDonagh, Hon. Secretary sent the 13 competitors on their journey to a capital start\\" Previous winners of the cup include well known Irish International and Donore Harriers Athletes: Bertie Messitt, Tom O‚ÄôRiordan and Jim McNamara. L.Kelly was the first winner of the cup. Since then there have been three '4 time' winners of the cup: * Paddy Byrne 'the Byrne from the Waterhouse Byrne Baird Shield' - 1916/1917/1919/1920 * Kevin Maguire - 1948/1949/1950/1951 * Eddie Spillane - 1970/1971/1973/1974 However, the most prolific winner was Bertie Messitt with six wins in 1953, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1961 and 1964.

Davie Baird joined the 10th Battalion of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers and was badly wounded at the Battle of Ancre in 1916. He made a full recovery and went on to win, most famously the Waterhouse Byrne Shield over three occasions to add his name to that trophy. There is also an amazing connection and coincidence between 6-time winner of the cup Bertie Messitt and the Fusiliers and the Faugh-a- Ballagh Cup. Years before he joined Donore Harriers, due to lack of work he joined the British Army in 1946, aged 18. His regiment, the Royal Irish Fusiliers were known worldwide as the 'Faughs'. Bertie wrote poetry, and he wrote this short poem about his time in the Regiment: FAUGH-A-BALLAGH I wore a hackle in my hat, and marched behind a band. Carried a Lee Enfield rifle, and served in foreign lands. They were the best days of my life, I cherish those golden years. When I was a proud member of the Irish Fusiliers.

The idea was put forward for zincblende GaAs and InAs semiconductors since 2006, and then extended to all commonly used wurtzite and zincblende semiconductors. Given the difficulty of finding direct experimental evidence for the existence of these effects, there are different schools of thought on how one can calculate reliably all the piezoelectric coefficients. On the other hand, there is widespread agreement on the fact that non linear effects are rather large and comparable to the linear terms (first order). Indirect experimental evidence of the existence of these effects has been reported in the literature in relation to GaN and InN semiconductor optoelectronic devices. History Non linear piezoelectric effects in polar semiconductors were first reported in 2006 by G.Bester et al. and by M.A. Migliorato et al., in relation to zincblende GaAs and InAs. Different methods were used in the seminal papers and while the influence of second (and third) order piezoelectric coefficients was generally recognized as being comparable to first order, fully ab initio and what is currently known as Harrison's model, appeared to predict slightly different results, particularly for the magnitude of the first order coefficients. Formalism While first order piezoelectric coefficients are of the form eij, the second and third order coefficients are in the form of a higher rank tensor, expressed as eijk and eijkl. The piezoelectric polarization would then be expressed in terms of products of the piezoelectric coefficients and strain components, products of two strain components, and products of three strain components for the first, second and third order approximation respectively. Available Non Linear Piezoelectric Coefficients Since 2006 many more articles were published on the subject. Non linear piezoelectric coefficients are now available for many different semiconductor materials and crystal structures: *zincblende GaAs and InAs, under pseudomorphic strain, using Harrison's Model *zincblende GaAs and InAs, for any combination of diagonal strain components, using Harrison's Model *All common III-V semiconductors in the zincblende structure using ab initio *GaN, AlN, InN in the Wurtzite crystal structure, using Harrison's Model *GaN, AlN, InN in the Wurtzite crystal structure, using ab initio *ZnO in the Wurtzite crystal structure, using Harrison's Model *Wurtzite crystal structure GaN, InN, AlN and ZnO, using ab initio *Wurtzite crystal structure GaAs, InAs, GaP and InP, using Harrison's Model Experimental Evidence Particularly for III-N semiconductors, the influence of non linear piezoelectricity was discussed in the context of light-emitting diodes: * Influence of external pressure * Increased efficiency See also *Piezotronics *Piezoelectricity *Light-emitting diode *Wurtzite crystal structure References Category:Nanoelectronics Category:Semiconductor devices Category:Semiconductors ","title":"Non linear piezoelectric effects in polar semiconductors"},{"id":"44856543","text":"Rotaliata is a class of Foraminifera characterized by tests that are exclusively multichambered, mostly planospiral or trochspiral, or derived from either.

She was the mother of Mahmud Khan and Ahmad Alaq, the next Moghul Khans of Moghulistan. Background and family Shah Begum was the fourth daughter of Shah Sultan Muhammad, king of Badakhshan. Her father's family boasted of their descent from Alexander the Great. She contended that they had swayed the scepter of Badakhshan from three thousand years. She had five sisters, one of them was married to Sultan Masud Kabuli, who was a descendant of Amir Timur. Another sister of hers, Shahzada Begum was married to Sultan Abu Sa'id Mirza, and bore him Abubakr Mirza. The Mirza, after the death of his father, engaged in war with Sultan Husain Mirza, and caused much disturbance in the kingdom. Her third sister was married to Ibrahim Barlas, who bore him a son, Jihangir Barlas, who at the end of Chaghatai rule became chief minister. Her fourth sister was married to Sayyid Shah Buzurg Arhangi. Her fifth sister was married to Shaikh Abdullah Barlas, who bore him three sons, Sultan Vais Barlas, Mizrab Barlas and Sultan Sanjar. Marriage to Yunis Khan When Sultan Yunus Khan returned a second time from Khorasan, Amir Sayyid Ali had died, and Saniz Mirza had sought the assistance of Yunus Khan. Yunus Khan in those days, often went backwards and forwards to Kashghar. At that time, the Khan sent Amir Zia- ud-Din, who was one of the most eminent Sayyids of Kashghar, to Sultan Muhammad, in Badakhshan, to ask one of his most immaculate daughters in marriage. Sayyid Zia-ud-Din brought Shah Begum back with him to Kashghar, and delivered her over to the Khan. Shah Begum married Yunis Khan as his second wife in 1461. Issue By her Yunis Khan had two sons, the elder was Sultan Mahmud. In Samarkand he was generally called Janikeh Khan. The younger khan was Sultan Ahmad Khan, and was well known by the name of Ilcheh Khan. She also had two daughters. The elder daughter was Sultan Nigar Khanum, who had married Sultan Mahmud Mirza, successively Sultan of Hissar and of Samarkand, by whom she had an only son, Sultan Ways, or, he was generally called, Khan Mirza; she married afterwards two khans of the Kaizak Uzbeks in succession. Shah Begum's younger daughter, Daulat Sultan Khanum married Muhammad Temur Sultan, the son of Muhammad Shaybani Khan. As queen dowager Shah Begum was widowed in 1487, and survived her husband more than twenty years. Her grandson, Sultan Ways Mirza known as Khan Mirza, son of her daughter Sultan Nigar Khanum had been educated at Tashkent, after his father Sultan Mahmud Mirza's death in 1495, and had become the favourite of his grandmother and aunts, who were at the court of the elder Khan, as well as of his uncle, Muhammad Hussain. Shah Begum, the grandmother, Mihr Nigar Khanum, the aunt, and Muhammad Hussain Mirza, the uncle of Khan Mirza, were all now at Kabul, as well as Khan Mirza himself, who had remained behind with his grandmother, instead of accompanying his cousin Babur on his expedition. Shah Begum left the Mongol region for family reasons, and after wandering for a long time she met her step grandson Babur in Kabul in 1505. Shah Begum who was the woman of spirit, and of intrigue, resolved to raise her favourite grandson, Khan Mirza to the throne. She gained over a body of the Mughals, who had remained behind at Kabul, and who regarded with reverence the widow of their old Khan, and the mother of the two Khans, his sons. She also drew over to her interest Sultan Sanjar Barlas, a chief of considerable influence, and her sister's son. The real head of the conspiracy, however, seems to have been Muhammad Hussain Mirza, though he was anxious not to appear, and left the ostensible management of the affair to Shah Begum. However, she failed to raise her favourite grandson, Khan Mirza to the throne. She was forgiven by Babur, and he treated her generously. She had always despotically managed the weak mind of her son, the elder Khan. When the khan retired into the desert, after he was released by Muhammad Shaybani, she found herself, thwarted by his ministers, which produced a quarrel with her son. Unable to bear the contradiction to which she was now subjected, and to which she had never been accustomed, she repaired to Samarkand, under pretense of solicitation from Sheibani some district as a settlement for the khan, and she there appears to have passed her time very comfortably, in the society of her daughters, and of numerous female connections. In 1507-8, she laid claim to Badakhshan saying that it had been her family's hereditary kingdom for three thousand years. Babur assented to her scheme, and she set out for Badakshan, together with Mihr Nigar Khanum and Mirza Khan. Death However, when Mirza Khan came to Badakhshan his first entrance into the country was not prosperous. He had pushed forward to meet with Zobayr of Ragh, a man of no family, and to announce the coming of the begum, when he fell in with a detachment of the army of Mirza Abu Bakr Dughlat, which attacked and dispersed his few followers. He himself fled to Zobayr. Shah Begum, his aunt and, the other ladies who followed behind, were surprised and carried off to Abu Bakr, in whose prisons they died, after much cruel suffering.

He also sat in the Irish House of Commons and the House of Commons of Great Britain. In later life, embittered by his chronic state of poverty, lack of professional advancement and a failing military career, he espoused the Jacobite cause, and died in exile in France. He was the first owner of the famous Echlin Sword. Family He was born at Ardquin, County Down, youngest son of Robert Echlin, and great-grandson of Robert Echlin, Bishop of Down and Connor from 1612 to 1635. The Echlin family came to Ireland from Fife in the early seventeenth century. His mother was Mary Leslie, daughter of Henry Leslie, Bishop of Meath and his wife Jane Swinton. His father died shortly after Robert's birth, and seems to have left his family badly provided for, although his mother's second marriage to Sir Robert Ward, 1st Baronet of Killagh, presumably restored the family's financial position. Robert's elder brother Sir Henry Echlin had a successful career as a barrister and judge, ending with a term as second Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland), he was created the first of the Echlin baronets in 1721, and became a substantial landowner, with his principal seat at Clonagh Castle in County Kildare. The third brother John also prospered: he was the father of Charles Echlin MP. Poverty Robert for a time shared in his brothers' prosperity, and acquired estates in County Monaghan, but he soon fell into difficulty and suffered years of financial embarrassment. By his own account, the blame for his financial problems lay entirely with the English Crown, which failed to pay his wages or offer him further advancement: he claimed that for many years he paid his soldiers out of his own pocket, and that he was ultimately forced to sell his estates as a result. In 1712 he sought permission to retire: by January 1713 he was pleading with the English Government for justice, as he faced \\"utter ruin\\". It is very likely that his bitterness at what he saw as the Crown's gross ingratitude for his long years of loyal service was one of the principal factors in his going over to the Jacobite cause in 1715. Whether his brother Sir Henry gave him any financial help is unclear. Military service He first saw active service in 1689, in the first year of the Williamite War in Ireland, and took part in the defence of Inch, County Down. When his uncle, Sir Albert Cunningham (who had married his aunt Margaret Leslie), raised the Iniskilling Dragoons later that year Echlin was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel. He and his men fought with distinction at the Siege of Derry and at the Battle of the Boyne and were commended for their services by King William III. It is frequently said that Echlin first used the Echlin Sword at the Boyne, but the better view is that it was made around 1708. On his uncle's death in 1691 he petitioned to be given command of the Regiment, remarking that he knew all the men and was related to all the officers, and that \\"it is well known that it was my industry and pains that made it a regiment\\". His request was granted, and he was in time appointed to the rank of Lieutenant General, although he complained constantly that his pay was in arrears. In 1707 the new regime in Dublin Castle dismissed him from all his offices, but he was restored to his command in 1709. The Regiment was sent to Scotland in 1708 (the Echlin Sword is thought to have been made about this time), and subsequently to the Low Countries. In 1712, apparently to rebuke Echlin for his \\"pretensions\\", the Regiment was returned to England, despite Echlin's request for it to be sent to Ireland, and reduced in size. Soon after the death of Queen Anne, Echlin was summarily dismissed from command of his Regiment: by his own account no charge was made against him other than that of being a Tory. He complained that there was \\"not a farthing paid to him\\", despite his chronic poverty. By now utterly disillusioned with the Government, he followed his patron, the Duke of Ormonde, to France and offered his services to the Old Pretender. Politics He sat in the Irish House of Commons as member for Monaghan Borough 1695‚Äì1703, and in the British House of Commons as member for Sudbury 1710‚Äì1713. In politics he was a faithful ally of James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde: this led to his brief dismissal from his military command in 1707. It was almost certainly at the invitation of Ormonde, who had already gone over to the Jacobite cause, that Echlin joined him in France in 1715. The Jacobite court noted with disappointment that only a handful of Ormonde's followers were prepared to make this sacrifice, and that those like Echlin who did so were mostly ruined men with nothing to lose and nothing to offer. Jacobite During the abortive Jacobite Rising of 1715 he was sent to Scotland: after \\"running great hazards\\", he reached the Orkneys, seized a vessel and returned to the Continent. He spent his last years in France, living on a small pension from the Old Pretender, and by his own account waiting for any chance to prove his zeal and loyalty in his cause. A projected invasion in 1718 was aborted due to bad weather: Ormonde wrote to commiserate Echlin on the mischance but for which \\"we might have met in our own country\\". In 1719 the Pretender paid him the considerable sum of ¬£300 \\"very privately\\". Marriage He married Anne, daughter of Sir Francis Blundell, 3rd Baronet, and his second wife Anne Ingoldsby, in 1696: they had no children. Anne died in 1724, having outlived her husband, whose precise date of death is not recorded. Related articles *Jacobitism *6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons *Williamite War in Ireland References *Ball, F.

Built in 1805, it is the only Federal period house to survive in the town, and is also one of its most imposing houses. It was built by David Warren, an early settler of adjacent Buckfield and a veteran of the American Revolutionary War. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Warren House is a typical rural New England connected farmstead, with a large main block and an ell joining it to a barn. The main block is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, two interior chimneys, and a stone foundation. The main entrance is centered on the front facade, with a transom window above, and is framed by pilasters and an entablature. There is a secondary entrance in the ell, which extends to the main block's right, and in the rear of the house. The entire house, including ell and barn, is clapboarded. The interior of the main block has retained much of its original material, including Federal style fireplace mantels, pumpkin pine flooring, and original doors. The house was built in 1805 by David Warren, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War who was one of the early settlers of nearby Buckfield. Warren served eleven terms in the state legislature (when the area was still part of Massachusetts), and served as Hartford's justice of the peace. The house remained in the hands of his descendants until the early 20th century. It includes a number of 19th-century outbuildings, including a second barn, chicken coop, and ice house.

As a six-year-old in the autumn of 1994 he won the Grand Prix d'Automne, one of the most important hurdle races in France and was then sent to England where he recorded an upset victory over a strong field in the King George VI Chase. He continued to race for several years without replicating his early success. After his retirement from professional racing he competed in Point-to-point races. Background Algan was a \\"tall, elegant\\" dark bay or brown gelding bred in France by Suc Fran√ßois Halgand & Claude Gouin. He was sired by the French Thoroughbred stallion Le Pontet whose other progeny included the Grand Steeple-Chase de Paris winner Le Pontif. His dam Djaipour was not a Thoroughbred, being descended from Rezeenne, a mare of unknown pedigree. During his racing career he was owned by the Marquesa de Moratalla and trained in France by Fran√ßois Doumen at Lamorlaye. Racing career 1993/1994 season In the 1993/1994 season Algan was ridden in by Adam Kondrat. He won a hurdle race at Auteuil Hippodrome on very soft ground on 9 October and finished eighth behind Al Capone II when joint-favourite for the Prix Georges Courtois in December. 1994/1995 season In September 1994, Algan won the Prix Richard et Robert Hennesy from his stable companion Val d'Alene who won the Racing Post Chase later that season. After finishing fifth to the Doumen-trained Bog Frog in the Prix Carmarthen, Algan recorded his most important victory up to that time when beating Druval by half a length in the Grand Prix d'Automne hurdle over 4100 metres on 1 November. When moved up in distance for the Prix Leon Olry-Roederer hurdle over 4800 metres three weeks later he finished third behind Druval and Royal Chance. In December, Algan was sent to England to contest the 44th running of the King George VI Chase over three miles at Kempton Park Racecourse on Boxing Day. He started a 16/1 outsider and was regarded as the second string runner from the Doumen yard behind The Fellow who had won the race in 1991 and 1992. The nine- runner field also included the 1993 winner Barton Bank who started favourite, Bradbury Star (twice winner of the Mackeson Gold Cup), Monsieur Le Cure (Sun Alliance Chase), Travado (Arkle Challenge Trophy) and Young Hustler (Sun Alliance Chase). Ridden by Philippe Chevalier, Algan was restrained at the back of the field in the early stages before making progress approaching the third last fence where The Fellow, who had been struggling for some time, was pulled up by Adam Kondrat. Barton Bank who had made most of the running, went well clear of the field at the second last as Algan continued his progress, moving into second approaching the final fence. At the last obstacle, Barton Bank, ten lengths clear of his opponents blundered badly, unseating his jockey Adrian Maguire leaving Algan to win the race by two and a half lengths and a head from Monieur Le Cure and the Irish-trained outsider Second Schedual. In February, Algan returned to Britain for the Racing Post Chase and finished last of the five finishers behind Val d'Alene under top weight of 164 pounds. In March he contested the Britain's most prestigious steeplechase, the Gold Cup at the Cheltenham Festival. He unseated Chevalier when making a bad mistake at the thirteenth fence in a race won by Master Oats. Later career In the 1995/1996 season, Algan finished third to Al Capone II in the Prix La Haye Jousselin in November and won the Prix Robert de Clermont in February. He again contested the King George VI, run that year at Sandown Park Racecourse in January but finished sixth, beaten fifty lengths by the winner One Man. Before the race, Doumen pointed out that the seven-hour journey by road and ferry caused many problems including \\"dehydration, weight loss, and tiredness\\". He failed to win in the next two seasons, although he did finish fourth in both the 1996 Prix La Haye Jousselin and the 1997 Grand Prix d'Automne. In March 1999 he recorded his first big win for more than three years when he defeated Vieux Beaufai by a neck in the Prix Troytown, a steeplechase over 4400 metres. In the 1999/2000 season he won a hurdle race in October, finished second to Vieux Beaufai in the Prix Georges Courtois and ran third to the same horse in the Prix Troytown. In December 2003 Algan, then aged fifteen, was bought by James Ryan and then competed on the amateur Point- to-point circuit. In February 2004 Ryan said that he had been told by Doumen that Algan was still \\"young at heart\\" and \\"doesn't act his age\\".

No further performances are planned for Murau.  History  Each summer, Shakespeare in Styria staged an open-air Shakespeare production in the Styrian Alps, together with concerts, lectures and readings. From modest beginnings as a teacher student-training program, the project developed into a small annual festival with professional actors from all over Europe. Until 2011 performances were in English, since 2013 in German. In 2007 British director Daniel Winder took over as artistic director from Nicholas Allen. In 2011 he handed this position on to British theatre director Sean Aita. Since 2013 productions have been directed by Nicholas Allen and US-American sword-master Roberta Brown. In the early years, sets were designed by Rudolph J. Wojta. Maria Krebs served as costume designer and maker from 2002 -2006. Several well-known actors have appeared as actor-in- residence sharing their artistry with the young performers.Austrian Times: Shakespeare still kicking in Styria, July 16, 2008 The festival also serves as springboard for young aspiring actors; for example, the 2009 production of MacbethGregor Schenker: Da steht ein Zelt am Feld, Falter, N. 31/2009 formed the basis for the 2012 film production The Tragedy of MacbethIMDb: The Tragedy of Macbeth using the same principal actors as the Murau production - Marek Oravec and Hannah Taylor-Gordon - and eventually winning awards for Best Film, Best Actor, and Best Director at the Indie Film Festival. In 2010 and in 2011 English actor Ben Crystal and Irish actor Damien Molony performed at the Austrian festival. During the first four years performances took place in the town's Festival Hall. In 2006, Shakespeare in Styria moved to the courtyard and barn of Murau Castle owned by the House of Schwarzenberg. Head of the family is Karel Schwarzenberg, former Czech foreign minister. His wife, Princess Therese Schwarzenberg n√©e Hardegg, was Festival President until 2013. Well known Burgtheater actress Annemarie D√ºringer was patron from 2004 until her death in 2014. She also gave readings during the festival. In 2013, the festival was relaunched at a new site, the G√ºnther Domenig pavilion in midst the city park, now performing in German and therefore appealing to a broader audience.Kleine Zeitung: \\"Shakespeare in Styria\\" bringt heuer \\"Othello\\" auf Deutsch, August 5, 2013ORF: ‚ÄûShakespeare in Styria‚Äú spielt auf Deutsch, August 8, 2013Wien International: ‚ÄûIm Schlamm suhlen werden wir uns nie‚Äú , July 17, 2014 The festival moved to its current home at St. Lamrecht Abbey, some 14 km from Murau, in the summer of 2016.

She was operated by FerriMaroc and Comarit between 2010 and 2011 and previously owned and operated by TransEuropa Ferries between Ramsgate and Ostend. FerriMaroc owned the ferry between 2001 and 2013 and operated her between 2001 and 2010 before placing her on charter. She was scrapped at Alang in late 2015 under the name Sher. History Pride of Free Enterprise was built by Schichau Unterweser AG for European Ferries services between Dover and Calais, initially entering service with them in 1980. In 1987 European Ferries was purchased by P&O; European Ferries; in the same year her sister ship, Herald of Free Enterprise capsized just outside Zeebrugge. As a result of these two events, Pride of Free Enterprise was renamed Pride of Bruges under a rebranding exercise undertaken by P&O; following the bad publicity of the Herald of Free Enterprise disaster. In 1998 P&O; European Ferries merged its Short sea routes with Stena Line to form P&O; Stena Line. As a result of this merger the vessels were again rebranded, this time the vessel was renamed to P&OSL; Picardy. In 2000 P&OSL; Picardy was laid up pending sale, eventually being sold to Transeuropa Ferries. Transeuropa Ferries renamed the vessel Oleander and introduced a freight only service between Ramsgate and Oostende which began on 4 July 2002. Two years later, on 20 July 2004 Oleander was joined by Larkspur to provide a joint passenger/freight service also operating between the two ports. From 2010 onwards Oleander was often sailing on the Spain - Morocco lines on short term leases from TEF to Comarit or FerriMaroc. When TEF went into bankruptcy in April 2013 the Oleander moved on more permanent basis to Acciona Trasmediterr√°nea and sailed on the Almeria to Nador route as M/F Sherbatskiy. The ship was renamed Sher for her last voyage to the scrapyard at Alang, India and broken up in late 2015.

A few texts such as Hathayoga Pradipika combine both.  The virtue of mitahara  Mitahara is discussed in ≈öƒÅ·πá·∏çilya Upanishad, as well as by SvƒÅtmƒÅrƒÅma. It is one of the yamas (virtuous self restraints) discussed in ancient Indian texts. The other nine yamas are Ahi·πÉsƒÅ (‡§Ö‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§∏‡§æ): Nonviolence, Satya (‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø): truthfulness, Asteya (‡§Ö‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á‡§Ø): not stealing, Brahmacharya (‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ö‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø): celibacy and not cheating on one's spouse, K·π£amƒÅ (‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§Æ‡§æ): forgiveness,Stuart Sovatsky (1998), Words from the Soul: Time East/West Spirituality and Psychotherapeutic Narrative, State University of New York, , page 21 Dh·πõti (‡§ß‡•É‡§§‡§ø): fortitude, DayƒÅ (‡§¶‡§Ø‡§æ): compassion, ƒÄrjava (‡§Ü‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú‡§µ): sincerity, non-hypocrisy, and ≈öauca (‡§∂‡•å‡§ö): purity, cleanliness. Some of the earliest ideas behind Mitahara trace to ancient era Taittiriya Upanishad, which in various hymns discusses the importance of food to healthy living, to the cycle of life,Annamaya Kosa Taittiriya Upanishad, Anuvaka II, pages 397-406 as well as to its role in one's body and its effect on Self (Brahman, Atma, Spirit).Realization of Brahman Taittiriya Upanishad, Anuvaka II & VII, pages 740-789; This is extensively discussed in these chapters; Illustrative quote - \\"Life, verily, is food; the body the food-eater\\" (page 776) The Upanishad, states Stiles,M Stiles (2008), Ayurvedic Yoga Therapy, Lotus Press, , pages 56-57 notes ‚Äúfrom food life springs forth, by food it is sustained, and in food it merges when life departs‚Äù. The Bhagavad Gita includes verses on ‚Äò‚Äòmitahara‚Äô‚Äô in Chapter 6. It states in verse 6.16 that a yogi must neither eat too much nor too little, neither sleep too much nor too little.Paul Turner (2013), FOOD YOGA ‚Äì Nourishing Body, Mind & Soul, 2nd Edition, , page 164 Understanding and regulating one‚Äôs established habits about eating, sleeping and recreation is suggested as essential to the practice of yoga in verse 6.17.Stephen Knapp, The Heart of Hinduism: The Eastern Path to Freedom, Empowerment and Illumination, , page 284 Another ancient text, in a South Indian language, Tirukku·πõa·∏∑ states moderate diet as a virtuous life style. This text, written between 200 BC and 400 AD, and sometimes called the Tamil Veda, discusses eating habits and its role in a healthy life (Mitahara), dedicating Chapter 95 of Book 7 to it. Tirukku·πõa·∏∑ states in verses 943 through 945, ‚Äúeat in moderation, when you feel hungry, foods that are agreeable to your body, refraining from foods that your body finds disagreeable‚Äù. Tiruvalluvar also emphasizes overeating has ill effects on health, in verse 946, as ‚Äúthe pleasures of health abide in the man who eats moderately. The pains of disease dwell with him who eats excessively.‚ÄùTirukku·πõa·∏∑ see Chapter 95, Book 7Tirukku·πõa·∏∑ Translated by V.V.R. Aiyar, Tirupparaithurai : Sri Ramakrishna Tapovanam (1998) Medieval era Sanskrit texts such as Dasakumara Charita and Hatha Yoga Pradipika discuss Mitahara. For example, Hatha Yoga Pradipika verse 1.57 states the importance of ‚Äò‚Äòmitihara‚Äô‚Äô, as Verses 1.57 through 1.63 of the critical edition of Hathayoga Pradipika suggests that taste cravings should not drive one‚Äôs eating habits, rather the best diet is one that is tasty, nutritious and likable as well as sufficient to meet the needs of one‚Äôs body and for one‚Äôs inner self. It recommends that one must ‚Äúeat only when one feels hungry‚Äù and ‚Äúneither overeat nor eat to completely fill the capacity of one‚Äôs stomach; rather leave a quarter portion empty and fill three quarters with quality food and fresh water‚Äù.KS Joshi, Speaking of Yoga and Nature-Cure Therapy, Sterling Publishers, , page 65-66 Verses 1.59 to 1.61 of Hathayoga Pradipika suggests ‚Äò‚Äòmitahara‚Äô‚Äô regimen of a yogi avoids foods with excessive amounts of sour, salt, bitterness, oil, spice burn, unripe vegetables, fermented foods or alcohol. The practice of Mitahara, in Hathayoga Pradipika, includes avoiding stale, impure and tamasic foods, and consuming moderate amounts of fresh, vital and sattvic foods.  Dietectics and mitahara  Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita are among the two largest surviving compendium on nutrition and diet that have survived from ancient and medieval periods of India.Sushruta Samhita KKL Bhishagratna, Vol 2, Calcutta Caraka Samhita emphasizes the need to plan and understand the role of diet in health, across Chapters 5, 6, 25, 26 and 27. In verse 25.31, it states \\"wholesome diet promotes health and growth, unwholesome diet is the most important cause of diseases\\". In verses 25.38-39, Caraka Samhita classifies foods into groups based on its source and taste, then categorizes them into nutritive and harmful. In Chapters 26 and 27, it suggests that the same food can be nutritive in small amounts while harmful in large amounts or if cooked improperly or if eaten together with foods its lists. Food, claims Caraka Samhita, must be tailored to needs of one's body, state of one's health, climate, season, habits and personal palatability and needs. In the spirit of Mitahara, in Chapter 5, it insists even light, easily digested and nutritious food should be consumed in moderation and should not be consumed in excess of bodily requirements. In Chapter 6, Caraka Samhita recommends that food should be tailored to the season, with rich and fatty foods being beneficial in winter, while light soups, fruits and acidulated drinks more suited for summers. In verses 6.6-7, it suggests that the diet should be planned and nourishing foods consumed in rotation, tailored to one's health condition and personal needs. As with Caraka Samhita, the other large compendium on health ‚Äì Sushruta Samhita ‚Äì includes many chapters on the role of diet and personal needs of an individual. In Chapter 10 of Sushruta Samhita, for example, the diet and nutrition for pregnant women, nursing mothers and young children are described.KKL Bhishagratna, Chapter X, Sushruta Samhita, Vol 2, Calcutta, page 216-238 It recommends milk, butter, fluid foods, fruits, vegetables and fibrous diets for expecting mothers along with soups made from jangala (wild) meat.Sushruta Samhita KKL Bhishagratna, Vol 2, Calcutta, page 217 In most cases, vegetarian diets are preferred and recommended in the Samhitas; however, for those recovering from injuries, growing children, those who do high levels of physical exercise, and expecting mothers, Sutrasthanam's Chapter 20 and other texts recommend carefully prepared meat. Sushruta Samhita also recommends a rotation and balance in foods consumed, in moderation. For this purposes, it classifies foods by various characteristics, such as taste. In Chapter 42 of Sutrasthanam, for example, it lists six tastes ‚Äì madhura (sweet), amla (acidic), lavana (saline), katuka (pungent), tikta (bitter) and kashaya (astringent). It then lists various sources of foods that deliver these tastes and recommends that all six tastes (flavors) be consumed in moderation and routinely, as a habit for good health.KKL Bhishagratna, Sutrasthanam, Chapter XLII Sushruta Samhita, Vol 1, Calcutta, page 385-393  Related concepts  The concept of Mitahara is discussed in over 30 different ancient and medieval era texts of Hinduism.SV Bharti (2001), Yoga Sutras of Patanjali: With the Exposition of Vyasa, Motilal Banarsidas, , Appendix I, pages 672-680 However, some texts use a different word and concept for the idea of \\"moderate diet and paying attention to what one eats and drinks\\". For example, Shivayoga Dipika uses the term NiyatƒÅshana (planned, regulated eating), while Dattatreya Samhita uses LaghrƒÅhƒÅra (eating lightly, small portions of diverse foods).

This first exhibition was shown under this heading in 2001 in the Carolinen Palais in Munich (Germany). The same exhibition was presented at the Museum M√∂nchehaus Goslar (Germany) in 2002. Both exhibitions were curated by Martin Leyer-Pritzkow.  New figurative painting  The artists featured in these exhibitions blurred the historical distinction between abstract and figurative painting. Human figures, landscapes, plants, figures, interior/exterior spaces were combined in non-representational landscapes. All forms of expression, visual languages or art historical quotations were incorporated into their work. Christoph Zuschlag, a German art historian expressed in his text about the Young Figuratives: \\"...the ideological trench struggles to figuration and abstraction, which divided the art scene in the post-war period into two hostile camps, is now regarded as well as outdated as the picturesque tendencies of the 60s and 70s. This means that the painter today - no longer under constant pressure to justify - especially after the reunification with former East Germany, where painting had its leadership never lost and that a figurative painter is no longer automatically opposing abstraction. This in turn liberates the young figuratives: freedom of synthesis .... They have the freedom to own, for example, the characteristic of the Informal resolution of the classical principle of form and make it useful for their own paintings, even and especially when they themselves work figurative.\\"[2]  Participating Artists  * Armin Baumgarten * Woytek Berowski * Hans-J√∂rg Holubitschka * Peter Lindenberg * Oliver Lochau * Bernard Lokai * Stefan Schwarzm√ºller * Benjamin Nachtwey * Katrin Roeber  Edition Young Figuratives by M√∂nchehaus Museum  At the opening of the exhibition in 2002 an offset print edition of nine works by all participating artists entitled \\"Young Figurative - M√∂nchehaus Museum of Modern Art 2002\\" were made available with an edition of 90 copies.[3]  References  * Gerald Kleffmann, Friends under the umbrella‚Äù (Freunde unterm Schirm), S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, no. 24, p. 39, 2001 * Martin Leyer-Pritzkow, editor : Young Figuratives, (Junge Figurative) with texts among others by Christoph Zuschlag and Robert Ketterer, in German and English, 2001, [1] * Christoph Zuschlag: Young Figruative painting, in Young Figuratives, edited by Martin Leyer-Pritzkow, English and German, 2001, [2] * Edition \\"Young Figuratives\\" M√∂nchehaus Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, 2001 edition of 90 each with nine different leaves.

He was also the commander-in-chief of the Royal Burmese Army from 1258 until his death in 1260. Ava kings from Swa Saw Ke to Narapati II and all Konbaung kings were descended from him. Background He was a descendant of the 11th-century general Nyaung-U Hpi.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 360 That he was married to a daughter of King Kyaswa and that he became the chief minister show that he hailed from a (distant) branch of the royal family.(Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 360): He was married to Saw Khin Htut, daughter of King Kyaswa by queen Yaza Dewi. Per (Aung-Thwin 1985: 130‚Äì131), ministers of the court were usually drawn from more distant branches of the royal family. Their subordinates were not royal but usually hailed from top official families. He was born c. 1198/99.Based on his date of death in early 1260 at age 61 (or 62nd year in Burmese age reckoning) per (Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 344‚Äì345). Career Reigns of Kyaswa and Uzana He first entered the royal service of King Htilominlo and became a judge before graduating to the royal court as a junior minister.Than Tun 1964: 131 He rose to the rank of chief minister with the title of Yazathingyan by 1248 at King Kyaswa's court.(Taw, Forchhammer 1899: 114‚Äì115): The stone inscription dated Tuesday, 10th waxing of Tazaungmon 610 ME (27 October 1248) at a temple near the Izzagawna monastery lists Kyaswa's ministers, of which the name Yazathingyan comes first. By then the court ran the country.Htin Aung 1967: 55 King Kyaswa, a devout Buddhist and scholar, was interested only in religion and gave up all administrative duties to his heir-apparent Uzana. But Uzana was not interested in governing either; he was reportedly interested only in chasing elephants and drinking liquor. Uzana in turn handed over the administration to the court.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 333, 336 When Kyawswa died and Uzana became king in 1251, nothing changed from the court's perspective. They still ran the country. However, the court, in particular Yazathingyan, came into conflict with Uzana's headstrong son and heir-presumptive Thihathu. Yazathingyan felt slighted by what he considered the young prince's rude and disrespectful behavior toward him‚Äîsomeone several decades older.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 337‚Äì338 (According to the chronicles, Yazathingyan was once spat on by the young prince. Chronicles do not say how old Thihathu was but given that Yazathingyan was about 15 years older than Uzana, he was at least three decades older than Thihathu.) Putsch of Thihathu The old minister nursed a grudge against the young prince. His opportunity to repay him came in May 1256 when Uzana died during one of his many elephant hunting trips in the south. Thihathu, the only son of Uzana by a queen, claimed the throne,Than Tun 1964: 134‚Äì135 but the powerful court disagreed. Yazathingyan persuaded the court to back Uzana's only other son by a concubine. The junior prince, known by the nickname of Min Khway-Chi (lit. \\"Prince Dog Dung\\"), was seen as harmless, and someone that they could control. The court prevailed in the ensuing power struggle. Thihathu was arrested,Maha Yazawin Vol. 1 2006: 235 and, though the chronicles do not explicitly state it, he was most likely executed. According to inscriptional evidence, Prince Dog Dung was crowned king with the title of Narathihapate in November 1256. Exile in Dala Yazathingyan had badly miscalculated; the 18-year-old new king was not harmless after all. He quickly consolidated power and pushed aside Yazathingyan by exiling him to Dala (modern Yangon). In shock, Yazathingyan asked the king why. The young king famously replied that when the construction of a temple is complete, the scaffold must be removed, and that Yazathingyan was the scaffold which must be removed now that his rise to power was complete.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 339 Martaban campaign (1258‚Äì59) The king had acted in haste; the vassal rulers did not respect the inexperienced king. The vassal rulers of Martaban (Mottama) and Missagiri(Harvey 1925: 326‚Äì327): Also spelled Macchagiri. Area west of Thayet. An inscription dated 1096 shows that Missagiri was in Arakan. But Harvey believes that it may not have stretched as far west to the Arakan coastline. both revolted. On the advice of his queen Saw Hla Wun, the king recalled Yazathingyan to Pagan (Bagan).Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 340 In 1258, he returned to Pagan and organized two expeditions. In December 1258,Maha Yazawin (Maha Yazawin Vol. 1 2006: 238) says the campaign began two years after the king's accession on Thursday, 6th waxing of Pyatho 604 ME, which translates to Sunday, 28 December 1242. Since Narathihapate came to power in 1256, the more probable date is 6th waxing of Pyatho 620 ME (1 December 1258). Yazathingyan led an army of 2000 men, 200 horses, and 20 elephants to start the Martaban campaign, while Thray Pyissapate, captain of the Household Guards, led another army to Missagiri. Yazathingyan's army faced little resistance and took the city after a siege of 8 days. The minister appointed Aleimma as the new governor and brought back the rebellious governor Nga Shwe and prisoners of war.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 341Maha Yazawin Vol. 1 2006: 238 Missagiri (1259‚Äì60) Meanwhile the Missagiri campaign had gone badly. The army had been badly defeated there and retreated in disarray. The king sent Yanda Pyissi, the younger son of Yazathingyan, to the front with an order to execute the commander, Thray Pyissapate. Yazathingyan was on his way back to Pagan, intercepted his son en route near Salin, and stopped him from carrying out the order. At Pagan, he presented the king with the rebel lord of Martaban and prisoners of war. When the king was in a better mood, he persuaded the king to rescind the execution order of Pyissapate.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 343 In return, the king asked Yazathingyan to lead the next dry-season campaign to Missagiri. Yazathingyan agreed. In November 1259,(Maha Yazawin Vol. 1 2006: 240) says the campaign began on Thursday, 10th waxing of Nadaw 605 ME (10 November 1244). Since the king came to power only in 1256, the date should be 10th waxing of Nadaw 621 ME (25 November 1259). Yazathingyan led an army of 40,000 men to Missagiri. His two sons also joined him. The Pagan armies laid siege to the city until starvation forced them to surrender. Yazathingyan however fell ill on the return trip through the Irrawaddy delta. He was either travelling by sea from Missagiri or settling some delta revolt.Harvey 1925: 327 He died in Dala. He was 61.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 344‚Äì345 The king is said to have been greatly saddened by the news.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 345 Legacy Yazathingyan had at least four children. Two of the children became generals in the Pagan army with the titles of Ananda Pyissi and Yanda Pyissi. Both brothers had competed to succeed their father's title, Yazathingyan. Maha Yazawin (Maha Yazawin Vol. 1 2006: 241) says both brothers fought to succeed the title Yazathingyan, and Ananda Pyissi eventually received it. Hmannan Yazawin (Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 345) only says both brothers fought to succeed the title but omits Ananda Pyissi winning it. The title was eventually given to the man who later became King Yazathingyan of Myinsaing. The chronicles do not mention the mother of Ananda Pyissi and Yanda Pyissi. He also had at least two younger children named Saw San and Saw Soe by Princess Saw Khin Htut, daughter of King Kyaswa and Queen Yaza Dewi. His descendants became famous people in Burmese history. His two sons led the Burmese army against the first two Mongol invasions (1277, 1283‚Äì84).Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 354 Saw Soe became a principal queen of King Kyawswa, the successor of Narathihapate. Through Saw Soe, Ava kings from Swa Saw Ke to Thihathu were his descendants.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 360, 402‚Äì403 Through Yanda Pyissi, Ava kings from Mohnyin Thado to Narapati II were his descendants.Letwe Nawrahta 1961: 12‚Äì13 Through Mohnyin Thado, all the king of the Konbaung Dynasty were his descendants.

Global Art Forum ;Commissioner & Director-at-Large In 2012, the director of Art Dubai, Antonia Carver, invited Basar to reinvent its associated cultural program, the Global Art Forum, which had been running since 2007 in a form derived from Art Basel Talks. Global Art Forum 6, under the directorship of Basar, was entitled \\"The Medium of Media\\"http://artdubai.ae/global-art- forum/2012 and took place in Doha, Qatar (18/19 March 2012) and Dubai (21‚Äì24 March 2012). It expanded the disciplinary remit to include novelists, historians, filmmakers and journalists; as well as introducing the Globe Books imprint; long term research projects and curated art and media exhibitions. \\"The Medium of Media\\" investigated the meaning of the word \\"media\\" in an art context as well as the role that media played in the unfolding of the Arab Spring which was barely a year old at that point. This was followed by Global Art Forum 7 (17‚Äì23 March 2013), commissioned by Basar, directed by H.G.Masters, and entitled \\"It Means This.\\"http://artdubai.ae/global-art- forum/2013 The theme of language has been an ongoing concern for Basar, who has said, \\"Contemporary reality is often ahead of our ability to describe it, because we are still left behind in the terminology of the previous era or moment. Such a schism leads to blindness about what is actually happening to us, around us.\\"http://brownbook.me/keeping-his-word/ Global Art Forum 8 (15/16 & 19‚Äì21 March 2014) was commissioned by Basar, directed by Omar Berrada and Ala Younis, and entitled \\"Meanwhile...

In 2012, Tod Wodicka wrote in The National newspaper, \\"That GAF took place on an island felt somehow important, and illustrated the oft repeated‚Äîand manifestly true‚Äîclaim that it acted as Art Dubai's brain.\\"\\"Douglas Coupland in Dubai, amidst a culture accelerated,\\" 6 April 2012 http://www.thenational.ae/lifestyle/douglas- coupland-in-dubai-amidst-a-culture-accelerated And then in 2013, Einar Engstr√∂m wrote in Leap magazine, \\"Among the invited guests, the 'artist' was barely present.

Opened in 1990, it is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) and operated by Covanta Energy. It is located adjacent to the New Jersey Turnpike between Raymond Boulevard and the Passaic River in Newark. As of 2012, the facility processed 2,800 tons of municipal solid waste per day, its two generators producing approximately 65 megawatts of power. The facility burns garbage from the 22 municipalities of Essex County and from New York City's Manhattan Community Board Districts 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12. As of January 1, 2013 the PANYNJ gave Covanta control of the facility through 2032, with optional extension to 2052. As part of the agreement the New York City Department of Sanitation will continue to use about 50% of the plant's disposal capacity. Convanta agreed to invest $75 to $100 million for operational improvements, including a modern particulate emissions control system and a new recycling system for ferrous and non-ferrous metals. In June 2013, a refuelling station for trucks using compressed natural gas (CNG) opened at the facility.

Early life and education Lynch was born in Bayside, Queens to an Irish Catholic family. His father was a subway motorman for 30 years. He went to Monsignor Scanlan High School in the Bronx. Career Lynch worked for a short time as a New York City Subway conductor, but on January 4, 1984, he became a police officer with the New York City Police Department. He has been described as being the most powerful police union chief in the world, having served in this role since 1999 and winning reelection to a fifth term in 2015. Lynch makes $65,382 per year as a police officer and $65,382 per year as the head of the union. He has been described as \\"New York City's Blue Bulldog\\" for being the head of the 23,000-member Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York. Personal life Lynch is married to Kathleen Casey, and has two sons, both of whom are New York City police officers. Conflicts Lynch has a history of conflicting with New York City Hall. In 2007, he stated that the PBA \\"could never support former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani for any elected office.\\" He was a huge critic of Police Commissioner Ray Kelly as well as Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Lynch spoke outwardly against the city's teachers' union boss Michael Mulgrew for co- sponsoring Al Sharpton's rally against stop-and-frisk, saying \\"It is absolutely ridiculous that [Mulgrew] . . . would waste his members' dues to get involved with a march that has nothing to do with teachers or his union.\\" In the wake of 2014 killings of NYPD officers, Lynch turned his back on Mayor Bill de Blasio due to a belief held by himself that political climates set by the mayor and other government officials led to the killing of the two officers. After the autopsy of Eric Garner, who died as a result of a choke hold in July 2014 while being suspected of selling loose cigarettes, he defended the actions of the NYPD officers. In November 2019, both Lynch and de Blasio criticized Bloomberg's apology for the stop-and-frisk policy which occurred under his administration. Lynch released a statement that said, in part, ‚ÄúThe apology is too little, too late‚Äù; \\"Mayor Bloomberg could have saved himself this apology if he had just listened to the police officers on the street‚Äù; ‚ÄúWe said in the early 2000s that the quota-driven emphasis on street stops was polluting the relationship between cops and our communities‚Äù; and ‚ÄúHis administration‚Äôs misguided policy inspired an anti-police movement that has made cops the target of hatred and violence, and stripped away many of the tools we had used to keep New Yorkers safe.‚Äù On August 18, 2020, Lynch and the PBA endorsed Donald Trump for President in the 2020 United States presidential election and appeared in the 2020 Republican National Convention.https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/08/trump-endorsed-by-nyc- police-union.html References Category:Leaders of organizations Category:Leaders of American trade unions Category:Police unions in the United States Category:People from Bayside, Queens Category:New York City Police Department officers Category:1964 births Category:Living people ","title":"Patrick Lynch (police officer)"},{"id":"44857677","text":"The Order of the Good Death is a death acceptance organization founded in 2011 by mortician and author Caitlin Doughty. The group advocates for natural burial and embracing human mortality. Along with Doughty, members include Sarah Chavez, Director of The Order of the Good Death, Megan Rosenbloom, Director of Death Salon, and Amber Carvaly, Director of Undertaking LA. Other notable members are artist and monument-maker Greg Lundgren, TED speaker Jae Rhim Lee, alternative funeral home director Jeff Jorgenson, artist Landis Blair, forensic pathologist Judy Melinek, author and photographer Paul Koudounaris, and other death professionals, artists and academics. The group held its first \\"death salon\\" in Los Angeles in 2013. Another salon was held in 2014 at St Bartholomew's Hospital Pathology Museum in London by museum curator Carla Valentine. The group took its name from the Brazilian Order of Our Lady of the Good Death. Death-positive movement Death positivity was popularized by Caitlin Doughty as a play on the term sex positivity. The death-positive movement is a social and philosophical movement that encourages people to speak openly about death, dying, and corpses. The movement seeks to eliminate the silence around death-related topics, decrease anxiety surrounding death, and encourages more diversity in end of life care options available to the public. However, the ideas behind the movement have existed much longer. The Order of the Good Death website lists the beliefs of the death-positive movement as being that cultural censorship of death and dying does more harm than good, that open discussions about death should be accepted as a natural human curiosity, that families should have full rights to care for the bodies of their loved ones without intervention from funeral businesses, and that end of life care should be diversified and performed in ways that cause less damage to the environment than our current practices. The movement also strongly encourages participants to speak to their families about their own end of life wishes, even if they are young and healthy, and is critical of the commercialized funeral industry. It also encourages people to express their feelings about death through art. Other organizations such as End Well, founded by physician and film producer, Shoshana R. Ungerleider, are contributing to the movement by hosting an annual conference and media platform to highlight solutions to make the end of life experience more human- centered. Death Over Dinner, founded by restaurateur and author, Michael Hebb and Angel Grant, is an organization that encourages people to have dinner parties to talk about mortality which has facilitated more than 200,000 dinners.

Background Indonesia is a Muslim-majority country, with Muslims constituting around 85% of the population. However, despite this there are significant minority religions in the country as well as a great deal of diversity in the expression of Islam between different groups of Muslims. This environment has meant that Indonesian Islam has traditionally been open, tolerant and moderate in character. In the past decade, however newer, more conservative and radical forms of Islam have begun to emerge in Indonesia and other Muslim countries. These forms of Islam are more characterized by an exclusive mindset which is intolerant of difference either amongst the Indonesian community in general or the Islamic community more specifically. These groups, whole small in number have garnered international media attention in recent years, particularly after September 11 attacks. The emergence of these groups has threatened Indonesia‚Äôs traditional image as an open, tolerant and moderate Muslim community. In response to this, the Indonesian Center for Islam and Pluralism (ICIP) was established in 2003 as an organization to link together various progressive-moderate Islamic activists in Indonesia and the Asian region. These activists are dedicated to the ideals of pluralism which promote respect for difference, whether this is between different religious, ethnic or social groups or between different streams of thought within a particular religions. It is hoped that through establishing this network between progressive moderate activists they will be able to more effectively counter existing radical-conservative networks in Indonesia and the region. Objective ICIP aims to build a network of Islamic Non- Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and progressive-moderate Muslim activists and intellectuals in South-East Asia and eventually around the globe.

He worked for some months as a kitchen boy at the Pontargen Hotel in Falmouth.Murphy (2004), p.121 Service at sea and capture At the age of 14, Berry claimed to be fifteen years old in order to join the Merchant Navy and after an initial engagement at sea he sailed aboard the oil tanker \\"Cymbeline\\" on 27 May 1940 as a Boy Seaman.Weale (1994), pp.66-67National Archives, London, Document KV2/255 Sailing on behalf of the British Admiralty from Gibraltar to Trinidad \\"Cymbeline\\" was attacked on 2 September 1940 by the German commerce raider ,Thomas (1995), p.263 a merchant vessel converted into a heavily armed cruiser. The tanker was sunk with loss of life although the survivors, including Berry, were rescued and taken prisoner of war being held aboard for 6 weeks before going into captivity in occupied France.Young (1989), p.52 Berry was held prisoner of war at Besan√ßon and later Ilag St. Denis in France,Weale (1994), p.112 during which time he reportedly escaped from captivity and became a black marketer in Paris until recaptured. Questioned by the Gestapo he betrayed people who had helped him escape and as a result was not spoken to by any other prisoner on his return to prison camp. British Free Corps In 1943 British fascist John Amery who was touring camps in Germany and occupied France and Poland where British prisoners were held persuaded Berry to join his British Free Corps with the stated objective of fighting beside the German Army against communist forces on the eastern front. Berry and three other recruits were moved to accommodation in Paris (Avenue Exelmanns) before an expected move to Berlin. Berry had little education and had been convinced that Amery was the British Foreign Secretary Leo Amery who was actually John Amery's father. Berry was arrested in Paris by the Gestapo and held for 8 weeks until he was sent to Berlin in August 1943 and lodged in a boarding house.Weale (1994), p.67 Unable to speak German he spent most of his time at the zoo although he claimed to have been frequently arrested for signalling to the bombers which were targeting Berlin by night. He was severely beaten on one occasion.Murphy (2004), p.128 Reportedly twenty-nine US seamen volunteered to join a similar \\"American Free Corps\\" and left the MILAG camp, some going into the service of the German radio broadcasting service. Berry was not involved in radio broadcasting.Thomas (1995), p.258 Berry was enlisted into the British Free Corps in November 1943, by which time it had moved from control of the German Army to the Waffen-SS. He was transported to Genshagen where he joined the other recruits Roy Courlander, Lewis, William Brittain, Frank McLardy, Martin and Alfred Minchin. In February 1944 the unit moved to Hildesheim at the base of the SS Nordic Study Centre, it numbered 8 men and from here the New Zealander Roy Courlander began visiting prison camps to try to recruit more members.Weale (1994), p.129 From late April 1944 he wore SS uniform with rank and national insignia and a British flag emblem on his sleeve.Weale (1994), p.132 In June 1944 Berry was sent with Alfred Minchin to recruit new members from prison camps. Having been recognized as their naive former Boy Seaman by ex-members of the crew of the \\"Cymbeline\\" who were on a prison working party in Westertimke, Berry was advised that contrary to what he had been told Germany was losing the war and that he should return to the prison camp.Murphy (2004), pp.135-136 He spoke to the senior officer of the British prison camp Captain Robert Finlay-Notman and other officers asking for advice on how to get out of the British Free Corps and placed in writing a plea for help. He was advised to visit the Swiss Embassy in Berlin, which one source states he did in July 1944, although another states that he did not do this, Berry received no real help despite Captain Finlay-Notman's written request to the Swiss.Weale (1994), p.134Thomas (1995) Still undergoing training, heMurphy (2004), p.143 moved to Dresden with the British Free Corps on 11 October 1944 where combat-engineer training commenced after they were issued with weapons and expected to carry out military duties for the first time.

Following the heavy bombing of Dresden by Allied Air Forces in 1945 they were all arrested, prior to being moved to Berlin ready to move to the Eastern Front and into action.Weale (1994), pp.171-172 On 22 March 1945 he was assigned with a handful of the recruits to join the 3rd Company of 11th SS Armoured Reconnaissance Unit which consisted of Germans, Dutch, Danish, Norwegians, Flemings, Swedes, Swiss and various foreign volunteers. Before being put into the frontline on the River Oder the men of the British Free Corps were removed.Weale (1994), p.175 During evacuation of the units in late April-early May 1945 Berry could not be found and the remaining members left him behind.Weale (1994), p.181 Berry was captured out of uniform by the Red Army who believed that he was a British prisoner of war and handed him to nearby US Army units.

It was established in 1960 in the Mecsek mountain above the city, and was originally known as Mecsek Cultural Park. A now-closed amusement park, established in 1961 was also on the site, linked to the zoo by a 570 m light railway. Aquarium-Terrarium in 2015 The aquarium-terrarium is separate from the zoo, in the inner city located within the mediaeval cellar system. It was built in 1985, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the zoo. The zoo has approximately 100,000 visitors annually. History History of the zoo The zoo was built in 1959-1961, with labour contributed by high school and university students, as well as other labourers of various types through the socialist voluntary labour scheme. (It took altogether 45,367 labour hours according to the memorial plaque near the entrance. The construction started in April 1959, and had been finished in 1961, although the zoo phase had been opened on 19 August 1960.) The location was chosen to locate the zoo within the natural surroundings of the Mecsek hills, outside the urban landscape. Originally, there were a tiny terrarium and aquarium, and also cougars, lions, tigers, leopard, black panther, Eurasian lynx, bears, and wolves as well. Later, the aquarium and the terrarium moved to the city, and because of the tiny cages, many animals had to be moved to other zoos (in the early 2000s the lions' cages have been renovated, and the lynxes stayed only). Besides the obsolete circumstances, the zoo endangered the water system for the city, so in the 2000s, there were a number of plans to move or close the zoo. The area of the zoo is 3.5 ha, and it is not considered large enough to have many bigger animals. In 2012, there were 250 animals of 57 species, including lions, monkeys, kangaroos, camels, hippos, zebras, and Falabella miniature horses. History of the Aquarium-Terrarium The Aquarium-Terrarium was opened to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the zoo. It was placed in the mediaeval cellar system, where a year-round tropical atmosphere (27-28 ¬∞C temperature and high humidity) can be created. The cellar is at Munk√°csy street No 31,pecs.utisugo.hu, in Hungarian 10 metres below the home of Mih√°ly Munk√°csy. The 800 m2 large cellar was designed by S√°ndor D√©v√©nyi. Its system contained 27 terrariums and 5 larger, 31 smaller aquariums with approximately 800 animals of 138 species. The Aquarium-Terrarium closed on 28 March 2016, followed by the relocation of the animals to the zoo the following day. The utilization of the building is unknown. Reconstruction The 50-year-old zoo was in very poor condition. Some old cages did not meet the standards of the 21st century, and the zoo spoiled the catchment area, so there were plans to move the zoo to √Årp√°dtet≈ë (near MecsExtr√©m Park)Elnyerte a t√°mogat√°st a k√∂lt√∂z√©shez a p√©csi √°llatkert - bama.hu, in Hungarian or K√∂k√©ny (as a Safari Park),P√©cs: √°llatkert vagy szafaripark? - greenfo.hu, in Hungarian but for financial reasons the move never happened.

The route was researched in 2014, and featured in the book The Classic Walks; Northern Yorkshire Coast and Moors published in January 2015 which coincided with the trail's opening. A regional route, the Esk Valley Way, already existed, but the Yorkshire Esk Trail was devised to overcome perceived shortcomings in the RR. The Trail's first leg follows country lanes from Castleton to Westerdale village, then uses footpaths and lanes to reach open moorland. Unlike the RR, it runs very close to the multiple tiny sources of the Esk, then follows the river to Castleton Station. Stage 2 is a linear route from Castleton Station to Egton Bridge Station (on the Esk Valley railway line). The stage follows bridleways and footpaths to Danby, then a country lane to the landmark Danby Beacon. A moorland footpath gives access to more paths to Lealholm, then the railway accompanies walkers closely to Glaisdale. A final stretch along a paved packhorse trod rises high above the Esk en route to Egton Bridge. There is an optional crossing of the river on stepping stones near the station. Stage 3 is another linear walk, from Egton Bridge Station to Whitby. A former toll road, now a permissive track, takes walkers beside the river and railway to the outskirts of Grosmont, then paths over fields and rougher ground lead to Sleights. An elevated scenic stretch beside fields follows to Ruswarp, where the Trail joins a permissive path between the railway and river. On the approach to Whitby, walkers pass under one of the most striking features of the walk, the Victorian Larpool Viaduct. Finally, the river debouches into the North Sea in Whitby's scenic harbour. A train can be caught back to the day's start point.

He was an exponent of the Kavungal School of Kathakali (Kavungal Kalari), noted for its rigorous training methods and overt physical interpretation of abhinaya. He is known to have brought innovations to the dance form, especially in the decorative movements (kalasam) and his contributions are reported in the development of grammar and costumes for the Kavungal School. A recipient of the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1973, Panicker was honored again by the Government of India, in 2006, with the fourth highest Indian civilian award of Padma Shri. Biography Kavungal Chathunni Panicker was born in 1922 in the small hamlet of Thichur, near Vadakkancherry in Thrissur district in the South Indian state of Kerala. He started learning Kathakali in 1933, at the age of eleven, under the tutelage of Sankara Panicker, his uncle, where he stayed for three years and later under Katambur Gopalan Nair. His debut performance was in 1936 at the age of 14. In six years time, aged 20, Panicker formed his own troupe. In 1947, Panicker and his troupe rendered a performance in Ooty, a hill station in the state of Tamil Nadu where he had the opportunity to meet Vikram Sarabhai, Indian scientist and his wife, Mrinalini Sarabhai, renowned classical dancer and the founder of Darpana Academy of Performing Arts, Ahmedabad. The next year, Panicker received invitation from Mrinalini Sarabhai to join the institution as its principal. He accepted the offer and stayed with Darpana till his retirement in 1985.

Ray Lightwood was born in Coventry. He was educated at Birchfield Road School in Birmingham. During World War Two Lightwood received training at the Radar and Wireless training school at RAF Yatesbury and after initially serving in India as a ground and service engineer, he became a travelling engineer with South East Asia Command. He was also seconded to Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough to study captured radar equipment. After the war Lightwood worked as an industrial electronics applications engineer and representative. Lightwood was a medical engineer, researcher and technician in the Department of Surgery at Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham from 1958 to 1987. In consultation with cardiothoracic surgeon Leon Abrams he researched, designed and developed the first variable rate heart pacemaker in 1960. Lightwood used electrodes attached to the heart coupled to an external pacemaker, so all the electronic components were kept outside the body, and could be replace in the event of failure. This was the first patient controlled permanent pacemaker as the primary circuit consisted of an inducing coil supplied by a portable transistor which produced short pulses at adjustable intervals and intensity.http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/documents/culture/bookletfinalpdf.pdf Ray Lightwood gave lectures about his research to conferences and societies. Lightwood also delivered lectures at Birmingham University, Keele University and the University of Nottingham, as well as at Matthew Boulton College in Birmingham and at Coventry Technical College. Lightwood was awarded the Official Degree of BSc (Pure Science) in 1974 by Birmingham University for which he submitted a thesis entitled 'An inductively coupled system for electrical pacemaking of the heart'. He retired from the Department of Surgery at Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham in 1987. He was a Methodist Lay Preacher. Lightwood died in 2001.

Sir William Boyd Carpenter (1841‚Äì1918), an English clergyman of the Established church of England, Bishop of Ripon, afterwards a Canon of Westminster and Chaplain to the reigning sovereign of England, wrote in a letter dated 7 August 1907 that his family bore the Hereford Arms. Sir Noel Paton, upon painting the Family Arms, informed him that the supporters were originally a round-handled sword, which in drawing over time became shortened, until nothing but the cross and globe were left beneath it. Those Hereford Arms were used by \\"John Carpenter, town clerk of London, who died 1442 A.

After a lengthy course of litigation, the UK House of Lords held that a High Court judge was not wrong to find that competition had not been foreclosed for a pub landlord, Mr Crehan. This finding was, however, on narrow grounds, and ran contrary to the decision of the English Court of Appeal, and appeared different to the European Commission and European Court of Justice. In the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015, sections 41 to 73, Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 ss 41-73 the beer ties were abolished altogether. Facts In 1991, Crehan agreed with Inntrepreneur, which controlled 7,355 pubs, to take two leases on pubs in Staines, where he would have to buy the beer from Courage Ltd, which owned 19% of UK beer sales. He had to buy beer exclusively at a specified price. The lease was a standard form, and it was not negotiable. In 1991, Courage and Grand Metropolitan had set up Inntrepreneur as a jointly owned company. The leases were all extended to 20 years, much longer than previously. However, the Secretary of State, in charge of competition law enforcement at the time, required that holdings be reduced to 4,350 by October 1992, and that ties be released by March 1998. However Crehan could not compete for anywhere near that long against free houses nearby who could buy beer more cheaply, and in September 1993 his business failed, with a loss. He was sued for ¬£15,226 for outstanding sums for beer. Courage Ltd claimed that Crehan had not paid for deliveries of beer. Crehan argued that the agreement was contrary to TEC article 81, and unenforceable, and counterclaimed for damages. It was shown that free houses were able to buy beer at much lower prices than tied tenants, reducing their profitability. Inntrepreneur had sought negative clearance from the Commission in 1992 that it could not infringe competition law under TEC article 81(3). In 1994, Crehan and others applied for a declaration that there was an infringement. In 1997, after a different agreement was negotiated, Inntrepeneur withdrew its application, and the Commission stated (given the withdrawal) now that only the national court could decide. Judgment Court of Appeal The Court of Appeal held that English law did not permit a party to an illegal agreement to recover damages, and so an action in damages would in any case be barred for Mr Crehan even if an article 81 action were successful. European Court of Justice The ECJ held that article 81(2) made agreements void, Mr Crehan could obtain relief, and in principle claim damages. A rule of national law that barred such a claim was precluded. It was true, as a principle of EU law, that a litigant should not profit from unlawful conduct, but this did not apply if the party did not bear significant responsibility for the distortion of competition, paras 22‚Äì28. At 32 it said to determine responsibility, the bargaining power of the parties and their conduct should be taken into account. At 34 it said a network of contracts could have a cumulative effect on competition, and the party who contracts with the one controlling a network cannot bear significant responsibility. High Court Park J held that he was not bound by findings of fact by the Commission in 1999 that it was difficult to gain access to the UK beer market. The market had not been foreclosed, and so Crehan‚Äôs claim was dismissed. Court of Appeal The Court of Appeal held that this probably conflicted with the Commission‚Äôs views, and so the High Court‚Äôs decision was precluded. Damages were awarded. House of Lords The House of Lords held that the first instance judge‚Äôs decision was to be restored. Conflicts between the Commission‚Äôs decisions and courts should be avoided, but the decisions were different enough that the Court of Appeal should not have interfered.

History The congregation was founded by Scottish immigrants in 1830, originally named St. Andrew's. The name was changed to St. Paul's in 1873. The building was constructed over four years, from 1854-57. The choir at the west end of St Paul's was extended in 1909, designed by Hugh Vallance. The building was designated a National Historic Site in 1990.St. Paul's Presbyterian Church / Former St. Andrew's Church, Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of Canada Building features The church building was designed by William Thomas (architect) in the style of English Gothic revival. The building's exterior is grey limestone which comes for the most part from local Hamilton quarries by stonemason George Worthington. Many windows are adorned with Gothic tracery. The sanctuary is made of dark wood. There is a chancel with rich foliage sculptures on the capitals. The church yard includes a small cemetery. Architectural historian Marion MacRae assessed the building as \\"the best Decorated Gothic Revival Church in Ontario\\". Steeple The church has a single steeple made entirely of stone which rises a height of 180 feet. It rises to a height of 100 feet to the top of the parapet line at which point it almost imperceptibly reduces itself into an octagonal spire with lucarnes on alternate sides. The tower and spire display medieval details from the Middle Pointed or Decorated phase of English Gothic (late 13th to early 14th century), including twin, pointed belfry openings on each side of the tower. The corners of the tower are reinforced with buttresses at right angles to the walls. There are narrow angle turrets each with their own delicate spire adorned with crockets and a finial at the top. It is the largest entirely stone steeple in Canada. Bells The chimes are eleven bells weighing in total 9873 pounds (4488 kg), ranging is size from the smallest at 300 pounds (136 kg) to the largest bell at 2100 pounds (955 kg).

More recognizable for the Lagoa das Sete Cidades at its centre, the volcanic complex includes centuries of geomorphological structures that include lava domes, cones, lava flows and maar geomorphology that have marked its history. History A historic rendering of the Sete Cidades Massif and crater lakes Lateral profile of the crater wall towards the western edge of the caldera A view of the northeastern flanks of the Sete Cidades Massif, showing the small radial cones in Santo Ant√≥nio The almost circular caldera is a nested structure formed as a result of three separate caldera collapse episodes,Robert B. Moore (1990), p.603 each associated with explosive eruptions.Jose Pacheo et al. (2002), p.4-5 These caldera collapse episodes occurred following explosive eruptions that formed the Risco, Bretanha and Santa Barbara pyroclastic fields.Jose Pacheo et al. (2002), p.5-6 The first phase occurred 35,700 years ago, and ceased with the collapse of the principal volcano. A secondary phase began around 28,750 years ago and was responsible for the collapse of the northwest portion of the primitive caldera. Around 15,740 years ago the last phase, marked by the collapse of the northern and northeastern portions of the crater occurred. In each of these formational phases, lapilli fallout (resulted from Plinian eruptions) and the pyroclastic flow deposits were transformed into ignimbrites, from melting. The Sete Cidades Massif has experienced 17 intra- caldera eruptions within the last 5000 years, which makes it the most active in the archipelago. The intra-calderan activity has been essentially marked by trachyte sub-Plinian and Plinian eruptions, with some having hydromagmatic characteristics. These formations date to 35,700 B.C., 28,750 B.C. and 15,740 B.C. Numerous smaller explosive eruptions then occurred between these paroxysmal events. In the last 5000 years, 17 explosive eruptions took place within the Sete Cidades volcano, resulting in fallout and hydromagmatic eruptions. Location of these eruptions vary, but they generally took on a southerly dispersal. Yet, there is geological evidence for pyroclastic density currents associated with three or four explosive events, but high concentrations of pyroclastic flows are sparse. It may be likely that: * any pyroclastic flows were confined to channels and only deposited locally in depressions; and * these deposits were quickly eroded away. The last intra- caldera eruption occurred approximately 500 years A.D., resulting in the creation of the Caldeira Seca cone. At the base of the caldera, there exist six Holocene era pyroclastic cones. Further, a large group of Pleistocene post-caldera trachytic lava domes, lava flows, and pyroclastic-flow deposits have been discovered on the northwestern flanks of the massif. Along historical eruptions have generally been basaltic in quality, with effusive characteristics that were less explosive, but generally Hawaiian or Strombolian in nature, occurring along the flanks of the crater and conditioned by regional and radial faults. Unlike Furnas, Sete Cidades has no active fumaroles, and most secondary manifestations occur in the submarine vents off the coast of Ponta da Ferraria and the coast of Mosteiros, as well as zones of natural degasification. The most recent historical eruption dates back to the 15th century; Sete Cidades has not erupted historically, although an eruption may have occurred immediately prior to the island's first colonisation, associated with a rift zone immediately southeast of the Sete Cidades Massif. Other eruptions have occurred within the caldera and from submarine vents along the western coast of the island; there have been four Strombolian eruptions and three Surtseyan eruptions in occupied history within a short distance of the shoreline. Geography The Sete Cidades Massif occupies the northwestern portion of the island and corresponds to a circular central caldera , whose interior is occupied by various lakes and volcanic cones of pumice, lava domes and maars. The depth of the caldera varies between in the west to in the east, although this varies at about median. Regional tectonics influence the geomorphological forms in this region, as does a rift zone characterized by abundant scoria cones extending to the southeast from the caldera. This rift zone is uncharacteristically higher than the crater rim, that it could shield Ponta Delgada from all but pyrcolastic flows associated with any future eruption. The northwestern flank is marked by the Mosteiros Graben, a tectonic structure aligned in a northwest to southeast orientation following the fault of the Terceira Rift zone. These faults and regional fractures have given way to radial faults resulting in scoria cones and lava domes throughout the serra. The volcano of Sete Cidades is distinguished by two stratigraphic layers: * The inferior group includes the oldest deposits associated with subaerial eruptions occurring more than 200,000 years B.C. This period of activity was essentially effusive producing basalt lava flows of trachyte. * The superior layer includes the eruptive products of eruptions occurring 36,000 years B.C., resulting in the first formation of the primary monogenic cone. This group is marked by six formative phases resulting from explosive debris of trachyte materials, including pyroclastic bombs and flows, some resulting from hydromagmatic forces.

Related jobs included paperboy, delivering newspapers to subscribers, and news butcher, selling papers on trains. Adults who sold newspapers from fixed newsstands were called newsdealers, and are not covered here. The hawkers sold only one newspaper, which usually appeared in several editions a day. A busy corner would have several hawkers, each representing one major newspapers. They might carry a poster board with giant headlines, provided by the newspaper. The downtown newsboy started fading out after 1920, when publishers began to emphasize home delivery. Teenage newsboys delivered papers on a daily basis for subscribers who paid them monthly. Hawkers typically purchased a bundle of 100 copies from a wholesaler, who in turn purchased them from the publisher. Legally every state considered the newsboys to be independent contractors, and not employees, so they generally were not subject to child labor laws. In the United States they became an iconic image of youthful entrepreneurship. Famous American newsboys included Bruce Barton, Ralph Bunche, Joe DiMaggio, Thomas Edison, Dwight Eisenhower, Joe Kennedy, Sam Rayburn, Walter Reuther, David Sarnoff, Cardinal Spellman, Harry Truman and Mark Twain.David E. Whisnant, \\"Selling the gospel news, or: The strange career of Jimmy Brown the newsboy.\\" Journal of Social History 5.3 (1972): 269-309, at p. 271. The Chicago Daily News in 1901 relied on newsboys hawking the headlines.

Benjamin Franklin is sometimes called the \\"first American newsboy\\", as he helped deliver his brother's New England Courant in 1721. But the real beginning of the trade of newsboy comes in 1833, when the New York Sun started hiring vendors in New York City. At the time, newspapers were generally either picked up at the newspaper's office, sent by mail, or delivered by printers' apprentices or other employees. The Sun, by contrast, was not sold in stores or by subscription.Burgan, p. 4 Its publisher, Benjamin Day, recruited unemployed people using help-wanted notices to vend his newspaper. Instead of the adults he expected, his ad drew children: the first was the 10-year-old Irish immigrant Bernard Flaherty, who turned out to be a talented hawker‚Äîlater a stage comedian‚Äîwho would cry out the day's most sensational headlines: \\"Double Distilled Villainy\\"; \\"Cursed Effects of Drunkenness!\\"; \\"Awful Occurrence!\\"; \\"Infamous Affair!\\".Matthew Goodman, The Sun and the Moon: The Remarkable True Account of Hoaxers, Showmen, Dueling Journalists, and Lunar Man-Bats in Nineteenth-Century New York, 2010, p. 31 These newsboys could either hawk to passersby on the street or establish subscription routes; many did both.Priscilla Ferguson Clement, Jacqueline S. Reiner, eds., Boyhood in America: An Encyclopedia, 2001, , s.v. 'Newsboys', p. 471 A newsgirl and boy selling papers outside saloon entrances in New York, 1910; girls were very rare. Newsboys' were not employees of the newspapers but rather purchased the papers from wholesalers in packets of 100 and peddled them as independent agents. Unsold papers could not be returned. The newsboys typically earned around 30 cents a day and often worked until late at night.(nd) Child labor in America 1908-1912: Photographs of Lewis W. Hine. Retrieved 17 June 2007. - See \\"Newsies\\". Cries of \\"Extra, extra!\\" were often heard into the morning hours as newsboys attempted to hawk every last paper.David Nasau, (1999) p. 9. Great Depression The local delivery boy pulling a wagon or riding a bicycle while tossing the morning or evening paper onto the front porch was a product of the 1930s. Newspapers lost circulation and advertising as the economy went down, and needed to boost revenues and cut expenses. Starting in 1930, the International Circulation Managers' Association launched a national operation to show local newspaper managers how to boost home newspaper readership. They designed a prepackaged curriculum in door-to-door subscription marketing that taught newsboys new skills in scheduling time, handling money, keeping accounts, and -- especially--presenting a winning salesman persona. This movement created the middle-class newspaper boy and permanently altered the relationship between teenage years and entrepreneurial enterprise.Todd A. Postol, \\"Creating the American Newspaper Boy: Middle-Class Route Service and Juvenile Salesmanship in the Great Depression.\\" Journal of Social History (1997) 31#2: 327-345. online Circulation managers solved their problem: The teenage boys. They were still independent contractors rather than employees, but the circulation manager designed the routes, and taught the boys how to collect and account for the subscription money. To inspire the young entrepreneurs, they created a distinctive gendered managerial philosophy of masculine guidance. It inspired the boys' entrepreneurship and stabilized their work habits, while providing extra money for tight family budgets.Todd A. Postol, \\"Masculine Guidance: Boys, Men, and Newspapers, 1930‚Äì1939.\\" Enterprise & Society 1.2 (2000): 355-390. Critics and reformers Newsboys were often seen as victims of poverty and delinquents in the making. In 1875 a popular writer found them a nuisance: :There are 10,000 children living on the streets of New York....The newsboys constitute an important division of this army of homeless children. You see them everywhere.... They rend the air and deafen you with their shrill cries. They surround you on the sidewalk and almost force you to buy their papers. They are ragged and dirty. Some have no coats, no shoes, and no hat.See Newsies. In St. Louis, Missouri in the first half of the 20th century reformers and child savers saw the newsboys as potential victims of the dangers and temptations of the urban environment. They secured a law in 1903 which created the state's first juvenile courts with the ability to hear criminal cases involving minors.Bonnie Stepenoff, ‚ÄúChild Savers and St. Louis Newsboys, 1896‚Äì1948,‚Äù Missouri Historical Review 104#3 (April 2010), 125‚Äì37 In Cincinnati in 1919, charity workers found that a tenth of the teenage boys were news hawkers, and they earned only 20 cents a day. They were twice as likely to be delinquents, they gambled a great deal amongst themselves, and were often attacked by thugs from other newspapers. The recommendation was to replace newsboys under the age of 16 with crippled war veterans.Maurice Beck Hexter, The Newsboys of Cincinnati (1919) online The paintings of London artist Augustus Edwin Mulready (1844-1904) told his audience that when they see a newsboy hawking papers they should see him as a symptom of poverty and urban malaise.Ronald D. Rarick, \\"Seeing poor children: Three artists' views.\\" Journal of Children and Poverty 6.2 (2000): 85-98. News butcher \\"News butchers\\" worked on passenger railroads selling newspapers, candy, and cigars to the passengers. Thomas Edison was a news butcher in his youth, but he lost that job after he set a car on fire due to white phosphorus igniting in a chemistry set he had onboard. Walt Disney worked as news butcher on the Missouri Pacific Railway as a teenager, and his memories of that experience influenced his design of the Disneyland Railroad. Ireland Stephanie Rains examines the newsboy as a characteristic presence on Irish streets in the early twentieth-century and also necessary last link in the chain of media production and distribution. He was little touched by mechanization--the newspaper vending box came later. Publishers depended on boys as young as eleven years old to sell copies, especially in downtown areas. Newsboys were very visible and audible figures on Irish city streets, and were themselves the subject of frequent newspaper stories which typically represented them as exemplars of the urban working classes for middle-class readers.Stephanie Rains \\"City streets and the city edition: newsboys and newspapers in early twentieth-century Ireland.\\" Irish Studies Review 24.2 (2016): 142-158. Labor actions and strikes Newsboys struck for better pay and working conditions multiple times: 1884,\\"Newsboys strike\\", New York Times.

July 21, 1899 In the newsboys' strike of July 1899, many New York newsboys refused to deliver major newspapers, and asked the public to boycott them. The press run of Joseph Pulitzer's World fell by nearly two- thirds. After two hectic weeks, the papers capitulated. After a two-week strike, papers did not lower their prices, but did agree to buy back all unsold papers, and the union disbanded.David Nasaw, Children of the City: At Work and at Play (1965) pp 167-77, online free to borrowDavid Nasaw, \\"Dirty- Faced Davids & The Twin Goliaths\\" American Heritage 36.3 (1985): 42-47. The New York newsboys' strike of 1899 inspired later strikes, including the Butte, Montana, Newsboys Strike of 1914,Peavy, L. and Smith, U. (1999) Frontier Children. University of Oklahoma Press. p.112. and a 1920s strike in Louisville, Kentucky.Reinier, J.S., Ferguson, P. and West, E. (2001) Boyhood in America: An encyclopedia. ABC-Clio Inc. Chicago newsboys faced an uphill battle to gain better incomes, particularly during the 1912 media strike. Attempts to unionize were sporadic and undercut by intimidation and sometimes violent counter-responses by the publishers.Jon Bekken, \\"Crumbs from the Publishers' Golden Tables: the plight of the Chicago newsboy.\\" Media History (2000) 6#1: 45-57. According to Jon Bekken: :Documented newsboy strikes took place in Boston (1901, 1908); Chicago (1912); Cleveland (1934); Des Moines (1922); Detroit (1877); Kansas City, Kansas (1947); Lexington, Kentucky (1899); Minneapolis (1918); Mobile (1942); New York City (1886, 1890, 1893, 1898, 1899, 1908, 1918, 1922, 1941, 1948); Oakland (1928); Portland, Oregon (1914); St. Louis (1945); San Jose, California (2000); and Seattle (1917).Jon Bekken, \\"Newsboy Strikes.\\" in Encyclopedia of Strikes in American History (2009): 609-619. During 1933 to 1935, the New Deal agency, the National Recovery Administration (NRA), promulgated a newspaper industry code that restricted juvenile employment in order to help unemployed adults. the restrictions expired when the Supreme Court in 1935 struck down the NRA as unconstitutional.Todd Alexander Postol, \\"Hearing the Voices of Working Children\\" Labor's Heritage (1989) 1#3 pp 4-19. Images \\"Boys Selling Newspapers on Brooklyn Bridge\\" by Lewis Hine, 1908 American photographer Lewis Hine crusaded against child labor in America in the early 20th century by taking photographs that exposed frightful conditions, especially in factories and coal mines. He photographed youths who worked in the streets as well, but his photographs of them did not depict another appalling form of dangerous child labor or immigrant poverty, for they were not employees. There were working on their own as independent young entrepreneurs and Hine captures the image of comradeship, youthful masculinity and emerging entrepreneurship. The symbolic newsboy became an iconic image in discourses about childhood, ambition and independence.Oenone Kubie, \\"Reading Lewis Hine's Photography of Child Street Labour, 1906‚Äì1918.\\" Journal of American Studies 50.4 (2016): 873-897.

In 1911 they won the International Exhibition in Paris in 1911 for the quality and comfort of the carriages produced. In 1927, with the advent of motorization, car production began. The main plant was opened in Mirandola where they realized vehicles bodies on chassis of Alfa Romeo, Ansaldo, Lancia, Fiat and Officine Meccaniche. In 1931 the production focused on the realization of bodies for commercial vehicles: vans, cabins for trucks, trucks and ambulances, occupying about 70 workers. Subsequently, the first buses were made, first with a wooden structure and then with tubular steel. During World War II, the production was temporarily converted for the wartime needs of the Ministry of the Navy, while in the post-war period the company participated in exhibitions and events industry bus (like the Golden Rose of San Remo), which allow to know the name in the Italian bus market. In 1962 the founder died and the company passed to his son Sirner. The 1970s were characterized by considerable investment. New models were made, innovative for its time, as the bus roof, the bus floor, the bus with seedlings structural inclined. They introduced innovations such as remote-controlled doors, acoustic and thermal insulation, air conditioning, reclining seats, heating, radio and television. The frames used were DAF, Fiat, MAN, Mercedes and Renault. In the 1980 it started a collaboration with Volvo. On the death of Sirner Barbi in 1994, the management passed to the brothers Alberto and Carlo Barbi and the factory was transferred in the industrial Mirandola, in San Giacomo Roncole. Among the most important products there are the models \\"ITALY 99\\" and \\"Echo\\" on Volvo mechanics. In the 2000 was designed the model \\"Genesis\\", the evolution of which \\"Galileo\\" was born in 2008. In 2007 the group produced some prototypes of van for the horse transport and cabins for lifts. From 2009 has been sold the new version of Genesis, powered Iveco chassis and Irisbus.

The film portrays an epic adventure trek and technical summit climb of the highest mountain in North America. The mountain is also known as Mount McKinley. Denali has an altitude of 20,320‚Äô and is one of the Seven Summits of the World. Situated in Alaska, in Denali National Park and Preserve near the Arctic Circle, a June Denali climb is spent entirely without darkness ‚Äì essentially a single month-long ‚Äúday‚Äù. And being so far North and so high, the entire climb, from flying into Base Camp via bush plane, to up- and-down the Kahiltna Glacier with repetitive carry-and-move snowshoe pack trips, to steep ascents near the 20,000‚Äô Summit Ridge is spent entirely on snow. This is a classic climb of America‚Äôs highest-altitude jewel. Start in the lush, green Talkeetna summer and wind your way through spectacular 3D vistas, blizzards and personal triumphs to reach the pinnacle of the United States of America. Once you see the mountains in 3D you‚Äôll never want to see them ‚Äúflat‚Äù again!  Origins  Up Denali 3D is the fifth 3D mountaineering movie from tree-D Films in the series of Seven Summits in Three Dimensions. Previous 3D films were shot on Cerro Aconcagua, (Aconcagua - The Top of the Western World), Mount Kilimanjaro, (Africa 3D), Russia's Mount Elbrus, (unedited), and Carstensz Pyramid, aka Puncak Jaya, (Carstensz Pyramid ‚Äì 3D Adventure in Irian Jaya). Cast Climbers The climbers were individuals who had never met each other and came from a variety of backgrounds. Tom Riederer was on the path of the Seven Summits - this would be his fifth, all filmed in 3D. Mike Smith was an athletic mechanic working for Delta Airlines in Atlanta GA. Gary D. Bacon is a former business executive- turned-adventure-traveler and mountaineer. Steve Ullman was only 18 years old at the time of the climb, and had participated in Outward Bound mountaineering school. His grandparents in Massachusetts coincidentally lived next door to Bradford Washburn. Phil Fleet was attempting to join the High Pointers club, summiting the highest point in each of the 50 US states. Denali was his 48th, and most difficult. Guides Guide Kirby Spangler is from Alaska and has many years climbing experience. Rob Gowler is from Jackson WY and has guided around the world. Both men were affiliated with the Alaska Mountaineering School/Alaska-Denali Guides and highly skilled for the climb.  Physical Training and Preparation  Climbing a big mountain obviously requires one to be fit and strong. Filming at the same time furthers this requirement. Training is started months in advance. Preparation of equipment, aside from the camera equipment, is a significant undertaking for each member of the team. A typical gear list has numerous items for climbing and camping in cold and windy weather. Similar attention for food preparation is required as well. The catering truck does not deliver at 20,000'! Production  Camera development for extreme environments  Thomas Riederer is a Professional Engineer and inventor who developed the camera system used in the filming of Up Denali 3D, which needed to be reliable for the extreme cold weather anticipated by the climb, as well as light, self-contained and portable to allow a month's worth of shooting with no resupply. Advancements from the camera system used for Aconcagua were designed and tested prior to production. A digital video camera with a modification of the NuView 3D lens, which Riederer invented, was selected. Modifications included a heating system to keep the camera operational at filming temperatures down to 35 below zero Fahrenheit, Left eye/Right eye polarization balancing for taming the white glare of the snow, vertical alignment mechanisms to avoid Left eye/Right eye vertical parallax and other optical, electronic and mechanical modifications.  Further camera development  Based on the filming success of Up Denali 3D and with the subsequent advent of High Definition Television, Thomas Riederer developed and patented advanced stereoscopic cameras for observation, entertainment, virtual reality and surgical applications. On the 3D display side, the advent and development of 3D image processing software such as Stereoscopic Player and StereoMovieMaker have enabled standard-definition productions like Up Denali 3D to be displayed in higher resolution on 3DHD flat-panel televisions.  Filming  The film was shot entirely on location, in Denali National Park and in and around Talkeetna, Alaska. Due to extreme crevasse danger on the glacier the climbers/guides were always roped together in teams of three or four during travel. Higher up the mountain, the steepness and sheer exposure also required roping-up of not only the climbers to each other but also to the mountain. That required snow protection in the form of snow pickets such that the ropes, and hence climbers, were tied to the mountain to prevent catastrophe should a climber fall. This aspect, though adding to filming difficulty, also gave the production an \\"up close and personal\\" feel. Some of the scenes showed the ropes, adding an interesting additional 3D depth cue To save weight and space in the otherwise 75 lb pack, no tripod was used in the filming, as Thomas Riederer was formerly a competitive pistol shooter with quite steady hands for steady shots.  Route  The chosen route was the now-ubiquitous West Buttress route first pioneered by Bradford Washburn in 1951. The route is detailed in a book by Colby Coombs and Bradford Washburn * Release Due to the lack of suitable 3D display systems in theaters at the time, Up Denali 3D was initially released to local Santa Barbara venues on an informal basis. Portable 3D projection systems were set up by Riederer, and the film was played along with sister tree-D Films productions. Up Denali 3D was released to a more broad audience in 2004, where it was played with excellent acceptance at the Santa Cruz Film Festival. In 2005, the film was presented at the Marjorie Luke Theater. as part of the Digital Days Film Festival Digital Days is an offshoot of the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, where in February 2004 Riederer's Aconcagua ‚Äì The Top of the Western World was the first 3D film ever to be played there. Subsequent screenings were held at the National Stereoscopic Association annual convention in Irving, Texas, in July 2005, Stereoscopic Displays and Applications convention in 2006, West (Sonoma CA) County Film Fest in October 2008, Paso Robles Indie 3D Film Festival in November 2008, and numerous other venues in subsequent years. Distribution In 2006, Up Denali 3D was released on DVD in both 2D and Field-Sequential 3D (Active shutter 3D system) formats. The DVD is available through several 3D DVD distributors. In addition, the film is available from 3D content streaming sites. A Blu-ray Disc version is planned, for better compatibility with 3D HDTV systems. Distribution was made to several overseas distributors as well. Accolades The Stereo Club of Southern California awarded Up Denali 3D, as well as a sister previous production Alaska 3D: Flora, Fauna & Fishin‚Äô both Honorable Mention medals at its 2005 \\"The 4th Ever 3D Movie/Video Competition\\" on July 21, 2005. The judges were Ray Zone, Chris Condon and Dan Symmes, all legendary stalwarts in the stereoscopic film business. Thomas Riederer was present at the awards, and knew the judges well.

The Agreement was published on 23 December 2014. The Stormont House Agreement is intended to bind the parties and communities closer together on resolving identity issues, coming to a settlement on welfare reform, and on making government finance in Northern Ireland more sustainable. After ten weeks of further talks, it led to the Fresh Start Agreement in November 2015, which aimed to secure the full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement and to deal with the impact of continued paramilitary activity. The Agreement was named after the building where the negotiations took place; Stormont House, the provincial headquarters of the Northern Ireland Office. The talks were primarily chaired by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Theresa Villiers, though Irish foreign minister Charles Flanagan, British Prime Minister David Cameron and Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny also participated at various points. The Agreement came after approximately thirty hours of continuous, final-stage talks. Prior to the Agreement, there had been an increasing feeling that the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly were in danger of collapse. Background In the aftermath of the Good Friday and St Andrews Agreements which brought and restored devolution to Northern Ireland several issues remained unresolved by the political parties in Northern Ireland. Issues relating to the legacy of The Troubles, including victims rights and investigation of historic criminal activity, had not been the subject of compromise between the Unionist and Nationalist communities. Ongoing division also surrounded issues of identity, including Orange Order parades and the flying of flags (which had manifested itself in the Belfast City Hall flag protests from 2012 to 2013). Some of these sources of disagreement were addressed during talks brokered by Richard Haass and Professor Meghan O'Sullivan. These talks began in September 2013, and broke up on 31 December of that year without agreement. Several other ongoing political contentions were also resolved by the Stormont House Agreement. These include the devolution of Corporation Tax to Northern Ireland. Within Northern Ireland there has been an all-party consensus on the need to devolve corporation tax to allow the Province to compete for business with the Republic of Ireland. This is because the Republic of Ireland's rate of tax is 12.5%, considerably lower than the UK rate of 20%, which Northern Ireland businesses currently pay. Welfare reform was also the subject of extensive disagreement between elements of the Executive (notably Sinn F√©in), and the UK Government. HM Treasury had been determined that Northern Ireland should adopt the welfare reform, and had imposed fines on the Executive for their failure to do so. Within the Executive the parties were split. Whilst Sinn F√©in had opposed passing welfare reform, the Democratic Unionist Party had attempted to do so, arguing that it was inevitable, and that failure to do so would incur further fines from London. A primary aim of the Stormont House Agreement, particularly from the perspective of the UK Government, was to resolve the welfare dispute, and have reform passed. Contents of agreement The Agreement was omnibus in nature, and included a myriad of different subjects. The Agreement exists within the paradigm created by the earlier peace agreements signed between 1998 and 2007, and augments them. The past, flags, and parades In an attempt to resolve the disputes in this area the signatories agreed to the establishment of a Commission on Flags, Identity, Culture and Tradition. This will be in place by June 2015, to report no later than 18 months thereafter. The Commission will be composed of fifteen members, of whom seven shall be selected by the leaders of the Northern Irish parties. The DUP and Sinn F√©in shall each be entitled to two members, with the next three largest parties getting one each. The remaining eight members shall be drawn from outside of government. In principle it was agreed that the responsibility for parades should be devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly. To ensure the legacy of the Troubles was not forgotten it was agreed that an Oral History Archive be established to allow persons involved to share experience of the Troubles. An independent body named the Historical Investigations Unit will be set up to investigate outstanding criminal killings and alleged police misconduct that occurred during, and in connection with, the Troubles. It will be overseen by the Northern Ireland Policing Board. Fiscal policies The Agreement binds the Northern Ireland Executive to passing a final balanced budget by January 2015. The British Government agreed to provide a financial package to Northern Ireland of an addition ¬£2bn from 2014 to 2020. It is also envisaged that the Executive will institute \\"a comprehensive programme of Public Sector Reform and Restructuring\\". This will be aided by an independent strategic review to be conducted by the OECD by the end of 2015. Corporation Tax was agreed to be devolved from Westminster to Belfast by 2017, provided that the rest of the Agreement is implemented by Northern Irish parties first. Welfare reform The Agreement binds the parties to implementing welfare reform in Northern Ireland on a similar basis to that which was implemented in Great Britain by the Welfare Reform Act 2012. Devolution reform The Agreement slightly alters the structure of the Northern Ireland institutions. The number of representatives in the Northern Ireland Assembly was agreed to be reduced, from six MLAs per Westminster constituency to five in time for the 2021 Assembly election (however this was actually implemented in 2017 due to the calling of an early election). It is also envisaged that reforms will be put in place to allow parties to decline from joining the Northern Ireland Executive, and instead receive funding as an official opposition, as occurs in other legislative bodies in Ireland and the UK. By the 2016 election the number of Stormont departments will be reduced from twelve to nine. Irish language The UK and Irish governments reaffirmed their commitment to recognising the Irish language in Northern Ireland. However, the Agreement does not create any binding clauses on the recognition of official status for Irish. Reaction The signing of the Agreement was met with broad support by a majority of Northern Irish political parties but not the Ulster Unionist Party and outside governments. The Northern Irish Trade Union movement, however, was not as supportive of the agreement staging a number of protests and public meetings against the agreement and the majority of ICTU affiliated public service unions held a one-day strike on 13 March. Northern Ireland * First Minister Peter Robinson: The deal is \\"as much as and more than we have ever been able to do on these issues in the past. So it is a very significant agreement.‚Äù * Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness: \\"We're proud of our achievement, I think it is remarkable that we managed against all odds, when people told us it couldn't be done to achieve this in the interests of those [vulnerable] people. I think that is something to be proud of.\\" Sinn F√©in eventually withdrew from the deal days before the Trade Union strike. United Kingdom *Prime Minister David Cameron: \\"I am delighted that a workable agreement has been reached that can allow Northern Ireland to enjoy a brighter, more prosperous future, while at the same time finally being able to deal with its past.\\" *Secretary of State Theresa Villiers: I believe this is a genuine step forward, real progress on some of the most critical issues for Northern Ireland and I'd like to express my strong thanks to all of Northern Ireland's political leaders who have participated in this process. Ireland * Minister of Foreign Affairs Charles Flanagan: ‚ÄúToday we are building on the hard-won peace on this island with a new agreement which aims to further reconciliation and foster economic growth.‚Äù United States *President Barack Obama: \\"when there is a will and the courage to overcome the issues that have divided the people of Northern Ireland, there is a way to succeed for the benefit of all\\" *Secretary of State John Kerry: \\"This is statesmanship, pure and simple, and leadership by all parties to break a political impasse and avoid a fiscal crisis by resolving complex budgetary and welfare issues.\\" *Meghan O'Sullivan (who had co-chaired the Haass talks): \\"[these proposals] really do offer a new way forward for Northern Ireland and its people\\". Implementation The implementation of the Agreement has been delayed due to disagreements about welfare reform, and controversy about paramilitary activity. The Committee on the Administration of Justice, and academics from the Institute for the Study of Conflict Transformation and the Transitional Justice Institute have drafted a Model Implementation Bill on the dealing with the past elements of the Agreement. A group of civil society activists and academics have adopted a set of Gender Principles for Dealing with the Legacy of the Conflict to address this gap in the Agreement.http://www.ulster.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/66285/Gender- Principle-Report-Sept-2015_Final-Version.pdf References Category:Ireland‚ÄìUnited Kingdom relations Category:Treaties entered into force in 2014 ","title":"Stormont House Agreement"},{"id":"44858531","text":"Sir Frederick Lloyd Dumas (15 July 1891 ‚Äì 24 June 1973), generally known as \\"Lloyd Dumas\\" or \\"F. Lloyd Dumas\\", was a journalist and politically influential newspaperman in Victoria and South Australia. Early history Dumas was born in Mount Barker, South Australia, the fourth child and youngest of three sons of Amelia Dumas, n√©e Paltridge, (died 1 November 1938) and Charles M. R. Dumas (1851‚Äì1935), who founded the Mount Barker Courier. A grandmother was a sister of Mount Barker pioneer John Dunn and his grandfather, Victor Dumas, ran a highly praised private school in Mount Barker. Any family connection with the great French novelist Alexandre Dumas is as yet conjectural. He was educated at Mount Barker and Victor Harbor and in 1904 won a scholarship to the Teachers' College. He quit his studies in late 1906 or early 1907 to work for the Adelaide Advertiser and in mid-1910 helped out as interim Murray Bridge correspondent for his father's newspaper. In 1911 he was one of the founders of the South Australian branch of the Australian Journalists' Association.S. Cockburn, 'Dumas, Sir Frederick Lloyd (1891‚Äì1973)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published first in hardcopy 1996, accessed online 29 December 2014 In 1914 he left for Victoria. Melbourne and London Around 1915 he accepted a position on the literary staff of the Melbourne Argus, and worked as a Federal roundsman. He publicly supported the pro-conscription stance of Prime Minister Hughes and was chosen by Hughes to manage the \\"pro\\" campaign for the second conscription referendum. In 1918 Dumas accompanied him and Minister for the Navy Cook to the Imperial Conference in England. He returned to the Argus after the war. Around 1922 the Melbourne Sun and Sun News-Pictorial had been founded by the publishers of the Sydney Sun to break into the Melbourne market. The daily newspaper failed with a loss of between ¬£120,000 and ¬£150,000 in the first few years, but the Sun News-Pictorial was quite successful, and was purchased by Herald and Weekly Times Ltd. in 1925. Dumas was hired to oversee the transition and has been credited with the paper's subsequent success. In 1927 he was sent to London to manage the Australian Newspapers Cable Service. Return to South Australia He returned to Adelaide in 1929 to take up the position of Managing Editor with The Advertiser, which a consortium led by Keith Murdoch had just taken over. He was appointed to the board in 1931, became managing director from 1938 to 1961 and chairman from 1942 to 1967. Dumas was, with Murdoch's blessing, pleased to be seen as a partisan editor, and throughout the Depression supported those he deemed as offering \\"sound government\\". He supported Lionel Hill as the Labor Premier, and continued to support him when he adopted the austerity measures of the \\"Premiers' Plan\\" in August 1931, through his sacking from the Labor Party and formation of a minority government with the support of Liberals, his resignation and finally his controversial appointment as Agent-General in London. With the advent of (later Sir) Thomas Playford as Liberal Premier, Dumas found a leader whom he could whole-heartedly support. Playford had ambitious plans to encourage multi-national companies to establish manufacturing bases in the State, and immediately after World War II, with the support of The Advertiser and an electoral system biased towards country voters, immediately set about implementing his plans, which involved nationalizing and upgrading the Adelaide Electric Supply Company and the various regional electricity providers as the Electricity Trust of South Australia (ETSA) and establishing the Housing Trust to provide austere but economical housing for workers with families, and courting major overseas companies such as General Motors and Philips Lighting and Electrical to establish manufacturing bases in South Australia, as well as encouraging established local companies such as BHP, Pope Products, Perry Engineering, Clipsal, Simpsons, SABCO and Actil to expand, resulting in a vibrant manufacturing sector, later decried as a \\"rust- bucket economy\\" and now largely dismantled. Other interests Dumas was fond of good food and wine, to the detriment of his waistline, and was a gracious host. In 1930 Dumas was admitted as a member to the Adelaide Club. He was a director of Australian Newsprint Mills Pty Ltd., a board-member of Herald and Weekly Times Ltd and chairman of directors of Reuters News Agency. He was on the board of the National Gallery of South Australia and chairman from 1955 to 1963. In addition, he sat on the board of directors of Elder, Smith & Co. Ltd from 1941 to 1967. Bibliography Recognition A portrait by Sir Ivor Hele was donated by his descendants to the National Portrait Gallery in 1999. The Sir Lloyd Dumas Gallery of the Art Gallery of South Australia was named for him. Family Dumas married Daisy Hall on 23 November 1915.

It acts as the resolution authority for a subset of banks in the euro area and as the institutional hub of the Single Resolution Mechanism. Resolution is the restructuring of a bank by a resolution authority through the use of resolution tools in order to safeguard public interests, including the continuity of the bank‚Äôs critical functions and financial stability, at minimal costs to taxpayers. History The SRB was established by the EU Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation of 2014 and became operational on 1 January 2015, with full assumption of its resolution authority on 1 January 2016. Its early development was supported by the European Commission. It moved to its current office on Treurenberg 22 in central Brussels in late 2015. The initial activity of the SRB was largely about establishing processes and methodologies, particularly in the area of resolution planning. In June 2017, the SRB took its first (and as of mid-2020, only) decision to take resolution action in the case of Banco Popular Espa√±ol. Single Resolution Fund The Single Resolution Fund (SRF) was established by the SRM Regulation. Where necessary, it may be used to ensure the efficient application of resolution tools and the exercise of the resolution powers conferred to the SRB by the SRM Regulation. The SRF is composed of contributions from credit institutions and certain investment firms in the 19 participating Member States within the Banking Union. It is being gradually built up during the period until 2023 included, and shall reach the target level of at least 1% of the amount of covered deposits of all credit institutions within the Banking Union by 31 December 2023.

This is believed to be the longest time that anyone has lived in this manner who then awoke without any residual symptoms. Life Olsson was born in Okn√∂ near M√∂nster√•s, the second-eldest of five children; her siblings were all brothers. She suffered a head wound while outdoors at age 14 on 18 February 1876, but seemed to recover from it quickly. On 22 February, she complained of a toothache. Her family believed that her tooth was sore because of witchcraft, and she was ordered to go to bed. However, when she fell asleep, she did not wake up. Her father was a fisherman and unable to afford a doctor, and the family relied instead on the advice of friends and the town midwife. Olsson's mother force-fed her milk and sugar water. Finally, the neighbors paid for a visit from a doctor, who was unable to wake the sleeping girl and determined that she was in a coma. This doctor continued to visit her for a year, after which he wrote to the editor of Scandinavia's leading medical journal, soliciting the help of other professionals in finding a cure for Olsson's continuous sleep-state. Olsson was visited by doctors who noted that her hair, fingernails, and toenails did not appear to grow. The family reported that Olsson occasionally sat up and \\"mumble[d] prayers she had learned by rote in childhood\\". One doctor who visited Olsson was Johan Emil Almbladh, who thought that her sleep-state was a result of hysteria. In July 1892, Olsson was hospitalized in Oskarshamn, where she was treated with electroconvulsive therapy. On 2 August 1892, she was released from the hospital without awakening or her situation improving. The hospital said that the appropriate diagnosis was \\"dementia paralytica\\". However, there is little to suggest that she actually suffered from that illness. She was not re-examined by a doctor until she awoke from her sleep. During the entire time that she was asleep, Olsson was given two glasses of milk each day. Her mother died in 1904, and after this, a maid continued to take care of Olsson and the household. Upon the death of her brother in 1907, Karolina began crying hysterically, although she remained in an assumed coma. She reportedly did not touch any food that she received during her years in bed, and the family's maid never heard her speaking. Olsson awoke on 3 April 1908, 32 years and 42 days after she had first fallen asleep. The maid found her crying and jumping on the floor. When her surviving brothers arrived, however, she did not recognize them. She was very thin and pale, and she showed sensitivity to light during the first few days after awakening. She was weak and had difficulty speaking. She could still read and write, and she remembered everything that she had learned before she fell asleep. Newspaper reporters from all over Europe and the United States travelled to Okn√∂ to interview her, and she and the family went into hiding to avoid the attention. She submitted to psychiatric testing in Stockholm and was found to be in full possession of the faculties that she had possessed before she fell asleep. At 46 years old, she was described as appearing to be no older than 25.  Studies  It has been speculated that Olsson may not really have been asleep and hibernating all that time. There were many unexplained characteristics of her state; for example, her hair, fingernails, and toenails did not seem to grow. Psychiatrist Dr. Fr√∂destr√∂m met Olsson in 1910. He published a paper on her condition in 1912 titled La Dormeuse d'Okn√∂ ‚Äì 21 Ans de Stupeur. Gu√©rison Compl√®te, but his analysis was limited to her situation being an unclear case of hibernation. It was later revealed that Olsson did wake up occasionally and, when she did, she reacted with sorrow and anger. Fr√∂destr√∂m speculated that Olsson thought that she was seriously ill, and that she remained still with her eyes closed and refused to eat to elicit sympathy. It has been conjectured that her mother had helped her and kept the fact secret that she was no longer hibernating.  Death  Olsson died in 1950 aged 88 from an intracranial hemorrhage.

(MIS) is a US-based company specializing in the engineering and manufacturing of three-dimensional printers for use in microgravity. Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, Made In Space's 3D printer (Zero-G printer) was the first manufacturing device used in space. History Made In Space was founded in August 2010 by Aaron Kemmer, Jason Dunn, Mike Chen, and Michael Snyder, during that year's Singularity University Graduate Studies Program. Their primary mission is to enable humanity to become a multi-planetary species. In the spring of 2011, Made In Space created their 3D Printing Lab at the NASA Ames Research Center on Moffett Field in Mountain View, California. That summer, they were awarded a sub-orbital flight for the printer through NASA's Flight Opportunities Program. From July through September 2011, the Made In Space team performed over 400 microgravity test parabolas on NASA's reduced gravity aircraft (the \\"Vomit Comet\\"), proving their 3D printing in microgravity. With this proven concept, Made In Space was award a Phase 1 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant for the design of a 3D printer to be tested on the International Space Station (ISS). In January 2013, Made In Space was awarded Phase 2 of the SBIR to build and flight-qualify an additive manufacturing facility with their 3D printer for the International Space Station (ISS). Phase 3 was awarded in February 2013 to fly their 3D printer to the ISS. In May 2014, NASA awarded Made In Space a Phase 1 SBIR contract for the development of a recycler unit to use with the 3D printer the ISS and for their microwell project. Shortly after, Made In Space was awarded an ISS Space Flight Awareness Award. This award honors \\"teams that have significantly improved the efficiency, cost or capabilities of space flight\\". In June 2014, Made In Space showcased their in-space manufacturing capabilities at the White House Maker Faire. On September 21, 2014 at 1:52 a.m. EDT (0552 GMT), Made In Space's Zero-G printer was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida to the ISS on board SpaceX CRS-4. On November 17, astronaut Barry \\"Butch\\" Wilmore unpacked the 3D printer from its launch packaging. On November 24 at approximately 1:28 p.m. PST, Made In Space successfully printed the first part ever manufactured in space. On December 11, 2014, Made In Space's the printer's first functional application was announced: a buckle developed by NASA astronaut Yvonne Cagle. This buckle is part of exercise equipment to assist with the reduction of muscle loss in zero gravity environments. On December 12, 2014, the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum re-opened after three years of renovation. Made In Space's 3D printer was one of their re-opening exhibits at the \\"Tools: Extending Our Reach\\" exhibit area. The Zero-G printer was featured along with replicas of 13 of the first 21 objects printed in space and a replica of the plate affixed to the printer, which was created by Jon Lomberg, the artist who designed Voyager's Golden Record. On December 17, 2014, the first uplinked tool, a ratchet, was manufactured on the ISS. All of the other items previously manufactured were printed before launch, and the files were available via an SD card launched along with the printer. The ratchet files were uplinked from the Made In Space office to the ISS space station. The ratchet took four hours to print. On September 27, 2018, the company announced an agreement with local government to open its European subsidiary in Luxembourg. Made In Space Europe will work on the development of a low-cost modular robotic arm for in-space applications. On January 17, 2020, Florida governor Ron DeSantis announced the company's corporate headquarters would be relocating from Mountain View, CA to Jacksonville, FL. The headquarters relocation and expansion effort will involve more than $3 million in new capital investment for Jacksonville. Made in Space was acquired in June 2020, by Redwirehttps://www.aeroequity.com/redwire/ Redwire (a newly formed company of the merger between Deep Space Systems and Adcole Space). 3D Printing in Zero-G Technology Demonstration Announced in May 2013, NASA and Made In Space sent the first 3D printer to space, known as the 3D Printing in Zero-G Technology Demonstration (also known as 3D Printing in Zero-G Experiment or 3D Printing in Zero-G). The scientific objective of this experiment was to prove a 3D printer could be developed for use in zero gravity. This experiment \\"is the first step towards establishing an on-demand machine shop in space, a critical enabling component for deep space crewed missions and in-space manufacturing\\". Integrated into a Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG), 3D Printing in Zero-G is a proof of concept experiment. It includes printing multiple copies of planned items to test for several variables, including dimensions, layer adhesion, tensile strength, flexibility, and compressional strength. Known as \\"coupons\\", these items will be tested by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and compared to duplicate items printed on Earth. The comparisons of these space and terrestrial manufactured coupons will be used to further refine 3D printing in space. The Jon Lomberg Golden Plate Inspired by Jon Lomberg's work on the Voyager Golden Record, Lomberg worked with Made In Space to create the Golden Plate to help commemorate the first manufacturing of something in space. It is attached internally, so it is visible through the front viewing window. The Golden Plate features imagery that symbolizes both the 3D Printing in Zero-G project and the individuals who have been instrumental in bringing the project to fruition. These features include 27 stars, which represents 16 key contributors from the Marshall Space Flight Center; 10 key Made In Space, Inc. employees, and Jon Lomberg; a comet to symbolize all of the other people who supported Made In Space; and Star Trek character Jean Luc Picard's catchphrase, \\"Make it so\\", in binary, symbolizing the functionality the 3D printer brings to the ISS. Additive Manufacturing Facility In April 2016, the Additive Manufacturing Facility was installed aboard the ISS. It is designed to be accessible for use by NASA as well as other government agencies, academic institutions and businesses. It is currently capable of printing objects as large as 10 cm x 10 cm x 14 cm from three different polymers including acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and a polyetherimide/polycarbonate composite (PEI-PC). Recycling of 3D printer plastic In 2014, NASA selected Made In Space as one of several companies to develop a recycler for 3D printed material on the ISS. In the follow-up solicitation, Made In Space failed to be selected for the Phase II SBIR. Large structure in-space manufacturing Made In Space is working with Northrop Grumman and Oceaneering to build and demonstrate Archinaut, a versatile in-space robotic precision manufacturing and assembly system.NASA seeks to break the \\"tyranny of launch\\" with in-space manufacturing. Eric Berger, Ars Technica. 29 July 2019. Archinaut would enable in-space production and assembly of the backbone structures for large telescopes, repair, augmentation, or repurposing of existing spacecraft, and robotic assembly of new space stations. MIS is currently in ground testing of a central spar onto which rolled up solar arrays can be extended and locked into place. The flight demonstration is expected in 2022, launched on an Electron rocket. The company has released video demonstrations of Archinaut's robotic assembly and Robotics Development Lab, as well as animations showing Archinaut's in-space assembly and manufacture capabilities.ULISSESDILO Fiber optics The multi-flight experimental payloads are producing test quantities of ZBLAN optical fiber. Based on the results from initial experiments and market demand, Made In Space plans to develop and operate larger-scale microgravity production facilities for ZBLAN and other microgravity-enabled materials. For its fiber optics development, MIS has teamed with ThorLabs. The advantage of fiber optics produced in microgravity are much lower signal loss capabilities, which benefit long-haul communications, medical research, super- computing, and many other industries and applications. Other activities In 2018, MIS was awarded Small Business Innovation Research award extensions of 24 months for its Vulcan and Industrial Crystallization Facility (ICF). The Vulcan Advanced Hybrid Manufacturing System is an additive and subtractive manufacturing technology being developed for in-space applications. Vulcan enables fabrication of precisely-machined metal parts at the point-of-use, such as on the International Space Station or future crewed space platforms. The ICF on the International Space Station would also manufacture space- enabled, multi-use optical crystals in microgravity. Optical crystals are used by such industries as computers and data-processing systems. An MIS commercial recycling facility is scheduled to be sent to the International Space Station in late 2019. The facility will take in plastic waste and unneeded plastic parts and physically convert them into spools of feedstock for the space station additive manufacturing facility used for manufactured-in-space parts.

They are made of repeating units of a 1,2,3-triazole and an oligopeptide. They can be visualized as an oligopeptide that is flanked at both the C-terminus and N-terminus by a triazole molecule. Synthesis Clicked peptide polymers are prepared by the azide-alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition also called the click reaction; which is commonly used in bioconjugation reactions to link molecules together with a stable triazole bridge. Peptide based polymers are produced from a cycloaddition variant of step-growth polymerization. The monomers used in this polymerization are oligopeptides with terminal azide and terminal alkyne groupsvan Dijk, M., Nollet, M., Weijers, P., Dechesne, A., van Nostrum, C., Hennink, W., Rijkers, D., and Liskamp, R.

Monomer preparation To prepare and oligopeptide with both a terminal azide and terminal alkyne two modifications must be carried out. The first is the amidation of the oligopeptide's C-terminus by propargylamine. This would done with all other reaction groups protected and with the C-terminus activated. Amidation of an tripeptide's C-terminus by propargyl amine. The group, X at the C-terminus can be a normal or activated carboxylate such as an anhydride, acid-chloride, or NHS-ester. The second modification required is the addition of an azide to the N-terminus. Unlike the addition of the alkyne this can be done on the whole peptide, or solely on the N-terminal residue which is added to the rest of the oligopeptide by solid-phase peptide synthesis. The addition of the azide occurs by Cu(II)-catalyzed diazo transfer.Alper, P. B.; Hung, S.-C.; Wong, C.-H. Tetrahedron Lett. (1996), 37, 6029-6032 Addition of an azide to the N-terminal amino acid by Cu(II) catalyzed diazo transfer Degradation The molecules linked to one another by the azide-alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition are connected by an aromatic triazole which is extremely stable, and can withstand high temperatures and extremes of pH. The oligopeptide units of a clicked peptide polymer are a different story. The triazole bridges do not confer any stability to oligopeptide. Degradation of the polymer occurs at the peptide bonds linking individual amino acids. The amide bonds can be attacked non-specifically by acid or base catalyzed hydrolysis. The polymer's peptide bonds can also be attacked by endopeptidases which will cleave at a specific side of a specific peptide bond based upon the residues which make up that bond. Enzymatic degradation sites of a clicked peptide polymer. For example, if the first residue is a phenylalanine then the enzyme chymotrypsin will cleave at site 1, and if the third residue of the tripeptide is a lysine then trypsin would cleave at the third cleavage site.

The series ran for 57 episodes over two seasons. It was based on the successful radio series of the same name which was based on the novels by George Harmon Coxe. The series starred Richard Carlyle originally as the title role of Jack \\"Flashgun\\" Casey. Later, Darren McGavin would take on the title role. The series co-starred actress Jan Miner as Ann Williams, Jack's girlfriend and a fellow reporter. Origins In 1934, author George Harmon Coxe who was already known for the writer of Black Mask magazine, which was launched in 1920, created a new character called Jack Casey who solved crimes for the police. The character was so successful in the magazine that Coxe wrote a novel about him called Silent Are the Dead in 1942. There were also two movie made about him entitled Women Are Trouble, (1936), and Here's Flash Casey, (1938). Another Casey novel was written entitled Murder For Two in 1943. There were three more Casey novels released; Error of Judgement, (1961), The Man Who Died Too Soon, (1962), and Broken Image, (1964). On July 7, 1943, the CBS Radio Network launched the long-running radio series called Casey, Crime Photographer, (originally called Flashgun Casey). The show was very successful. It was renamed in April 1944 to Casey, Press Photographer, and again in June 1945 to Crime Photographer. It was finally called Casey, Crime Photographer in March 1947. The radio series was cancelled on November 16, 1950. It was revived and put back on the radio as simply Crime Photographer. It was only on for a year from January 13, 1954-April 22, 1955 before being permanently cancelled. Between the cancelation of the radio series in 1950 and the revival of it in 1954, CBS Television aired a television series for one year entitled Casey, Crime Photographer (also known as Crime Photographer). Synopsis Casey, Crime Photographer premiered on Thursday April 19, 1951 on CBS. For the first season, actor Richard Carlyle portrayed the title role of Jack Casey, nicknamed \\"Flashgun\\". Casey is a reporter, specifically a photographer for the fictional newspaper, The Morning Express in New York. Casey usually reports at crimes photographing crime scenes and collaborates with the police and participates in the solving of these crimes. His girlfriend, Ann Williams, which was played by future Palmolive spokesperson and actress Jan Miner for the entire series, is also a reporter at The Express. Every week on every episode, Casey goes to the Blue Note Caf√© where a bartender named Ethelbert is usually always there waiting for Casey to tell him his most recent job experience and his most recent crime investigation. The season one finale aired on August 30, 1951. Season 2 changes Season 2 premiered on September 7, 1951. The major changes that occurred during the season were mainly cast related. The biggest change in the cast was the change of the actors who played Casey. Richard Carlyle originally played Casey but in June 1951, near the end of season one, the show's executives replaced Carlyle with another popular actor, Darren McGavin. This was McGavin's first role on television. The role of Ethelbert the bartender also changed as season two rolled around. Originally, the role of Ethelbert was played by actor John Gibson. In June 1951, along with Carlyle, Gibson was replaced by Cliff Hall who entered season two playing the role of Ethelbert. Season two also saw the birth of a new character, Jack Lipman. Lipman was Casey's partner. Lipman was portrayed by actor Archie Smith. Jan Miner maintained her role as Casey's girlfriend and fellow Express reporter Ann Williams. CBS cancelled the show in 1952. Its last episode aired on June 5, 1952. Cast *Jack \\"Flashgun\\" Casey - Portrayed by Richard Carlyle originally. Actor Darren McGavin took over the role in June 1951 and through season two, (the final season). Casey is a photographer/reporter who works at The Morning Express, a New York newspaper. He collaborates with the police to solve seemingly unsolvable crimes. In every episode, Casey is always at the Blue Note Caf√© to tell the story of his last job endeavor to the patriots of the bar, (mainly the bartender). *Ann Williams - Portrayed by Jan Miner for both seasons. Also is a reporter at The Express. Ann is also the girlfriend of Casey and occasionally is involved in Casey's \\"adventures\\". *Ethelbert - Portrayed originally by John Gibson. Was replaced by Cliff Hall in June 1951. Ethelbert is a waiter/bartender at the Blue Note Caf√©. Ethelbert is usually the one with whom Casey tells his stories to each week *Jack Lipman - Portrayed by Archie Smith. Lipman was a character introduced towards the end season one in the Summer of 1951. Lipman became familiar with viewers of the series by the season two premiere on September 7, 1951. Lipman was Casey's partner who assisted him in solving the crimes and getting pictures of them for The Express. Production notes The series was telecast live from New York City for both of its seasons. The series aired on Thursday nights at 10:30 pm EST. The series was produced by Martin Manulis. This was his first production role in television. The series was directed by Sidney Lumet in his earliest television directing roles. The music that would usually accompany Casey and his conversations with Ethelbert were performed by The Tony Mottola Trio. The last episode of Casey, Crime Photographer aired nationally on June 5, 1952. But two other episodes of the series aired only in New York on June 12 and 19, 1952. After the series ended its run in June 1952, CBS replaced the series with the game show I've Got a Secret which premiered on the 19th of June of that year.

His tenure corresponded with the administration of Governor Buddy Roemer. Background Herring graduated in 1968 from the Palmer School of Chiropractic in Davenport, Iowa. From February 1969 until October 1970, he served in the United States Navy. Thereafter, he worked as a chiropractor in Alexandria (1970‚Äì1992), in Metairie in Jefferson Parish (1992‚Äì1996), in Amite in Tangipahoa Parish in southeastern Louisiana (1996‚Äì1998), and since 1998 in the capital city of Baton Rouge. Beginning in April 2004, he became affiliated with Louisiana Spine and Sports Medicine in Baton Rouge. Long active in his profession, Herring has taught on the graduate faculties of four chiropractic colleges: his alma mater, Palmer, Parker University in Dallas, Texas, Texas Chiropractic College in Pasadena, Texas, and Logan College of Chiropractic in Chesterfield, outside St. Louis, Missouri. Herring has written scholarly articles carried in such publications as American Chiropractors, Dynamic Chiropractic, The Chiropractor Today, and Chiropractic Technique. Political life From 1976 to 1987, Herring was a member of the Louisiana Statewide Health Coordinating Council. Herring won a runoff election on November 21, 1987, for the House seat vacated by Republican Jock Scott, who ran unsuccessfully for the Louisiana State Senate against the Democrat Joe McPherson. Herring defeated fellow Democrat Eugene Paul \\"Gene\\" Cicardo, Sr. (1933‚Äì1996), one of the first white graduates of the historically black Southern University Law Center in Baton Rouge and a former city attorney chosen by Arnold Jack Rosenthal, the last of the municipal finance and utilities commissioners in Alexandria. In a low-turnout contest, Herring polled 4,034 votes (52.7 percent) to Cicardo's 3,627 (47.3 percent). Cicardo had led the five-candidate primary field with 26.7 percent of the votes cast, compared to Herring's 22.9 percent. Representative Herring served on the House committees of Civil Law and Procedure and Health and Welfare. Herring did not seek a second term in the House in the 1991 nonpartisan blanket primary, and his seat was won by the African-American school board member, Israel \\"Bo\\" Curtis of Alexandria. Herring instead lost a bid in 1991 for the District 29 seat in the Louisiana State Senate; he finished in third place in the five- candidate primary election with 7,114 votes (19.1 percent). Another losing primary candidate was the singer Jay Chevalier. Victory instead went to another Democrat, the incumbent state Senator Joe McPherson, who in the runoff election defeated the Republican Robert W. Bates. More than a decade after his legislative tenure, Democratic Governor Kathleen Blanco appointed Herring to head a joint legislative task force to formulate plans to handle problems in the Louisiana Group Benefits Program for eighty thousand state employees. In January 2017, Herring was listed as a Republican voter and a resident of Ward 5 in Livingston Parish outside Baton Rouge by the office of Louisiana Secretary of State Tom Schedler.

The resources devoted to this plan greatly exceeded those allocated to preparations to raise an expeditionary force to serve outside Australia.Wilcox (1999), pp. 173‚Äì174 The Australian Government also expanded the pre-Federation network of coastal defences to provide protection against raids from Japanese or German warships prior to World War I.Horner (1995), p. 66 In 1912, these defences were manned by 14 companies of the Australian Garrison Artillery, each of which had a strength of over 100 men.Horner (1995), p. 67 Garrison forces Mobilisation during 1914 6 inch Mk VII gun at Fort Nepean which fired on SS Pfalz. This posed photograph was probably taken shortly after the incident on 5 August 1914.Horner (1995), p. 75 All coastal defence batteries were activated hours before the declaration of war against Germany (which took place at 9:00 am Melbourne time on 4 August).Horner (1995), p. 72 The next morning, a 6-inch gun from the examination battery at Fort Nepean, which was located at the opening of Port Phillip Bay, fired a shell over the bows of the German cargo ship SS Pfalz after its Australian pilot failed to notice a signal for the ship to stop. Pfalz subsequently steamed into nearby Portsea, and was secured by a naval boarding party. This was the only shot to be fired at an enemy vessel in Australian waters during the war, and may have been the first shot fired by the armies of the British Empire during the war.Horner (1995), pp. 73‚Äì74 The militia members of the garrison units received call-up notices on 6 August, and reported for duty at 9 am the next day.Horner (1995), p. 74 During the early days of August all coastal fortifications were fully manned by gunners, engineers and infantrymen.Horner (1995), pp. 74‚Äì75 The gunners remained at their stations for the rest of the year, as it was feared that the German armoured cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau could attack Australia. In addition to the coastal defences in Australia, a battery of four 4.7 inch guns manned by naval personnel was established to protect the town of Rabaul in New Britain in March 1915; this town had been captured from German forces in September 1914. After the initial call-up of reservists to man the garrison artillery, the commanding officers of the other militia units were directed to begin preparations to raise an infantry division and a light horse division for home defence tasks. By the end of August 1914 the Government had judged that a force of this size was unnecessary given that Australia was distant from the war zones. Instead, it was decided to maintain only a small number of infantry battalions and light horse regiments on active duty at any one time.Wilcox (1999), p. 177 By the end of 1914 the home defence force comprised 100,000 reservists, of whom 56,000 were members of the Citizens Forces and 51,000 were rifle club volunteers. Despite fears of sabotage and uprisings by German-Australians, no domestic threat eventuated. However, on 1 January 1915 twenty members of the 82nd Infantry Battalion assisted the police to kill two men who fired on picnickers during the \\"Battle of Broken Hill\\".Wilcox (1999), p. 178 Members of the coastal artillery units were not initially permitted to volunteer for overseas service in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). However, the threat of naval attack from German raiders greatly decreased after the British victory in the Battle of the Falkland Islands on 8 December 1914, and in early 1915 the Australian Government decided to form a heavy artillery brigade (which was eventually designated the 36th (Australian) Heavy Artillery Group) for service in France from the permanent members of the garrison artillery units.Horner (1995), pp. 81‚Äì82 Garrison duties For the remainder of the war the Australian Government was concerned that German surface raiders or submarines could enter Australian waters, or that Japan could start a war in the Pacific if the Allied forces in France suffered a significant defeat. To guard against these threats, reserve infantry and artillery units were periodically activated for garrison duties. A total of between 3,000 and 4,000 soldiers were on active service at any point in time. As well as manning coastal defences, these soldiers patrolled the coastline near major cities and guarded vital infrastructure such as water reservoirs and undersea telegraph cable landing points.Wilcox (1999), pp. 178‚Äì179 The coastal defences were generally manned on a skeleton basis, though reservists were available to fully activate them if a threat developed.Scott (1941), p. 197 The restriction on militia gunners serving overseas was lifted in 1916, and those who volunteered for the AIF were often posted to the 36th (Australian) Heavy Artillery Group.Horner (1995), p. 83 A group portrait of several men from the 74th (Boothby) Regiment during a training camp in or about 1915 The Citizen Forces deteriorated during the war as the AIF was given precedence for manpower and other resources. While the size of the force increased during 1915, a high proportion of its members volunteered for overseas service with the AIF. Many of the militia's officers were used to train AIF recruits, and camp facilities and equipment were also assigned to the expeditionary force. This greatly disrupted the Citizen Forces training activities, with few units conducting training camps during late 1915 or 1916.Wilcox (1999), p. 180 While there were intakes of conscripts to the Citizen Forces during 1916 and 1917, few of these men were ever required to undertake periods of training or active service.Wilcox (1999), p. 181 In October 1916 the government called up 37,000 reservists for a short period of compulsory training ahead of a plebiscite on whether conscripts should be compelled to serve overseas. Both this plebiscite and a second vote in 1917 ended in the rejection of the Government's proposal that conscripts be used to reinforce the AIF.Wilcox (1999), p. 182 By 1918 the Citizen Forces were close to collapse as many of its best members had transferred to the AIF and the remaining personnel were largely untrained.Wilcox (1999) pp. 181‚Äì184 The Government attempted to revive the Citizen Forces during the last months of the war. The initially successful German Spring Offensive which began in March led to concerns that Japan could attack Australia. In response, the Government reinstated regular training camps for militia units and launched a campaign to encourage men rejected by the AIF to volunteer for the militia. This effort proved unsuccessful as both reservists and their employers considered the training camps to be pointless and disruptive to the economy, and only 500 men chose to volunteer for the Citizen Forces.Wilcox (1999), pp. 184‚Äì185 While a scheme to set up a reserve force manned by AIF veterans who had returned to Australia attracted 17,000 volunteers, they received no training.Wilcox (1999), p. 186 Two partial mobilisations of the garrison forces took place when it was feared that German raiders were operating in Australian waters. The first of these mobilisations occurred between February and April 1916, and led to the coastal defences being fully manned. After this time only the examination batteries at major ports, which were used to force vessels to stop and be searched if ever necessary, were manned.Scott (1941), p. 198 On 20 November 1917, one of the coastal guns at Fremantle fired on the Japanese cruiser Yahagi when she gave an incorrect signal while entering the port. The Australian Governor-General subsequently travelled to Perth to apologise to Yahagis captain for this incident. The coastal defences were activated again between 21 April and 16 May 1918 when the raider SMS Wolf was thought to be operating near Australia. The examination batteries were stood down on 21 November 1918. Naval forces During the war the Royal Australian Navy took up a large number of small ships to serve as patrol boats, though many served for only short periods. These craft were used to patrol coastal waters and harbours for German raiders and mines.Straczek (2014), pp. 35‚Äì36 In early 1917 the RAN began to organise a minesweeping force using small craft manned by a combination of naval and civilian personnel; 18 vessels were eventually used as auxiliary minesweepers.Straczek (2014), pp. 35 These vessels were subsequently used to sweep for mines laid by the Wolf off the Australian south-east coast.Dennis et al (2008), p. 465 During the war a Naval Guard Section was also raised to provide security for ships in port and to protect wireless stations.Palazzo (2001), p. 71 See also *Military history of Australia during World War I *1st Special Squadron (Japanese Navy) References ;Citations ;Works consulted    * Further reading  Category:Military history of Australia during World War I ","title":"World War I defences of Australia"},{"id":"44859127","text":"√âric Pras (born 1 March 1972) is a French chef, Meilleur Ouvrier de France (2004), rated three stars by the Guide Michelin.

Education Hellyar was born in 1947 in New Plymouth. She completed a Diploma in Fine Arts (Hons) at the Elam School of Art in 1970. Work Working in both sculpture and installation, Hellyar's work incorporates a wide range of materials, from found natural items such as grass and stones, to clay, fabric and plaster, to latex, lead and bronze for casting. Over the years consistent themes in Hellyar's work have included 'her celebration of the environment, her interest in people's interaction with nature, the validation of the domestic and a questioning of traditional gender roles'. At art school she was encouraged to experiment with rubber latex, then a new material. Hellyar was drawn to the properties of the medium, which allowed for precise replication of texture and details, and used latex to cast objects such as leaves and pine cones. Country Clothesline (1972), now in the collection of the Govett-Brewster Art Gallery, was one of Hellyar's first major works: it comprises 22 items of clothing dipped in latex and strung along a rope propped up by a pole. There is an element of chance in the work, as there are no instructions as to what order the items should be hung in. An early exhibition titled Bush Situation (1976) created an environment to surround the viewer with floor pieces and hanging latex casts of vegetation, often stitched together with copper wire. Art historian Priscilla Pitts notes that 'Despite the subtlety of colour and detail in these works, some viewers found the flabby texture and rubbery smell of the latex unpleasant and distinctly unnatural, a less than welcome reminder that this was art, not nature'. From the late 1970s Hellyar began to work more with found objects and materials such as clay, which were less expensive and more readily available than latex and metal. Writer Warwick Brown describes a 'memorable 1979 exhibition' where Hellyar showed '70 small, soft sculptures made of stitched, unbleached calico enclosing various natural materials. Antennae ventured out of folds and pockets; furry, feathery things hid in cocoons or webs. Each small work had its own identity, and the spectator seemed surrounded by sheltering, reclusive life, gathered in a laboratory for study or experiment'. In 1982 Hellyar had an exhibition called Shelter at the Auckland City Art Gallery. For this she filled the room entirely with structures created from muslin, flax and twigs, which were plaited, woven and stitched together. The structures resembled traps, lairs or shelters, and were 'inhabited' by 'small creatures made from substances like fur and claws, shells and bark'. In the 1970s Hellyar spent periods living in Cornwall and in Scotland, when she travelled around Europe and visited many museums and galleries. This experience fuelled her interest in the way objects are collected and displayed as 'artefacts'. Subsequently, Hellyar produced a series of works in the early 1980s known as 'Thought Cabinets', in which she drew on the aesthetics of museum displays, laying out bones, food and 'artefacts' she created from a variety of materials in cabinets, cupboards, trays, or directly on the floor of the gallery space. The works examine, among other ideas, the evolution of human thought and intelligence and how the hunter/gather model of ancient societies might apply to modern life. For the 1982 Sydney Biennale Hellyar created a sculptural installation with three components, Meat Cupboard, Dagger Cupboard and Cloak Cupboard. Wooden cabinets with glass fronts were filled with a variety of objects both created and collected by the artist: in a letter she described the contents of Meat Cupboard as \\"3 realistic bones from decent-sized cuts, 6 abstract foetal forms, 6 collected 'found' nests, 6 of my clay containers with different meat types in each.\\" Each group of items was placed on a separate shelf in its cabinet, with each shelf referencing a different style of art: Realism at the top, then Abstraction, then Found Objects, with the lowest shelf melding all three. In the mid 1980s Hellyar started working with latex and fabric again, and extended the ‚Äòhunter/gatherer‚Äô theme in works like the ‚ÄòPacific Food Aprons‚Äô, in which latex castings of vegetables and meat were sewn onto fabric aprons. Art historian Anne Kirker notes that by the time of her 1985 Aprons exhibition in Wellington, Hellyar was seen as 'one of the country's most thought-provoking and innovative sculptors'. Priscilla Pitts in her 1998 survey of recent New Zealand sculpture notes that a tension between large ideas and subtle manifestations is key to Hellyar's work. Describing a 1986 installation work Being Born, Bearing Fruit and Dying, made up of plant and sea life forms moulded from fine white clay or cast in latex, bronze, lead or iron, Pitts writes: > These forms are grouped to lead the viewer through a schematised narrative > not only of the human (and all of nature's) cycle of birth, reproduction and > death, but also of the evolution of life, on earth, from the water to the > land and finally to the air. The work is large and its themes are grand, yet > through the fragmented, low-lying nature of the composition and the use of > small, life-size objects, Hellyar ensures it is anything but monumental. > This is a characteristic of much of her work, which consistently challenges > modernist notions of sculpture as stand-alone, assertive and monolithic. In the 1990s Hellyar made large, delicate bronze sculptures cast from plants and flowers. She continues today to work across sculpture and installation. In 2015 Hellyar collaborated with artists Maureen Lander and Jo Torr on an exhibition Tell Tails at the National Library of New Zealand. The exhibition took inspiration from the collections of the Alexander Turnbull Library and Hellyar's contribution Red cloud is made up of dozens of handkerchiefs, neckerchiefs, serviettes and napkins dyed blood red. These materials were all used as items of exchange in early interactions between indigenous people in the Pacific and European explorers; the work was inspired by a work by colonial artist William Ellis in which Tahitian people wear European neckerchiefs. In late 2017 Hellyar presented the exhibition Looking, Seeing, Thinking at Te Uru Waitakere Contemporary Gallery. The installation, made of printed cloth and sculptures, extended Hellyar's interest in the history of the Enlightenment in New Zealand: > The history of the Enlightenment in New Zealand has been a subject of > Hellyar‚Äôs work since 2002, notably with her exhibition Mrs Cook‚Äôs Kete at > the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford with Maureen Lander. Exploring histories of > gender, Hellyar notes that Mrs Cook‚Äôs mother was an entrepreneur with a > warehouse that provided much of the women‚Äôs clothing used for trade in the > Pacific. Hellyar is particularly interested in what Europeans brought into > the Pacific at that time, and also what they took, including the development > of museum collections that map objects into hierarchies through museum > processes of naming, sorting and display. Botanical drawing, still in use in > museums today, was popular in the 18th century, both for scientific use and > amongst enthusiasts, amateur botanists and gardeners. Teaching career Hellyar lectured at the Gippsland Institute of Higher Education in 1980 and was senior lecturer at Elam from 1981 to 1996. Anne Kirker noted in her 1986 history of New Zealand women artists that Hellyar had 'earned a reputation as a teacher and is one of the few women to be employed as such at either of the two university art schools in this country'. Major exhibitions and collections Hellyar has exhibited consistently in New Zealand and internationally since the 1970s. Her work has been included in major exhibitions including the 1982 Biennale of Sydney, When Art Hits The Headlines (National Art Gallery, Wellington, 1987), NZXI (Auckland City Art Gallery, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney, and Contemporary Art Institute, Brisbane, 1988), Three from NZ (Long Beach Museum of Art, Los Angeles, 1990), Headlands (MCA, Sydney, 1992), and Treasures of the Underworld (New Zealand Pavilion at the 1992 Seville Expo, Amsterdam and various New Zealand venues, 1992 to 1994). In 2005 Hellyar participated in the Tylee Cottage Residency at Whanganui's Sarjeant Gallery and in 2011 the resident botanic artist at the Auckland Botanic Gardens. Hellyar's work is held in many New Zealand public collections, including the Auckland Art Gallery, Govett- Brewster Art Gallery, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa and the Christchurch Art Gallery.

Kurtycz in ParisKurtycz artworks were often complex matrices combining performances and graphic design elements, including photographs, drawings, maps, wax forms, stamps, letters, musical notation and even axes and explosives. His performances and his photographic and print works on paper have influenced Mexico City artists. Kurtycz is known for his use of printing techniques in his graphic artworks. In the 1970s he mobilized his art projects into a challenge to the art establishment, including mail bombs (a series of artworks posted as letters), intended to push art establishment leaders beyond traditional conceptions of what constitutes art.

Abrams (2000), p. 194 His father, Colonel Ivan Alexandrovich Urusov, was the Moscow military chief Arseny Zakrevsky's deputy. His mother Princess Yekaterina Ivanovna Urusova (n√©e Elsnits) belonged to the aristocratic Naryshkin family. After graduating the Moscow University in 1866 he joined a Saint Petersburg district court as a lawyer and became famous after achieving the acquittal of Marfa Volokhova, a peasant woman falsely accused of her husband's murder. According to Alexander Hertzen, \\"by the late 1860s Urusov has become the major star of the Russian advocatory.\\" In 1871 Alexander Urusov successfully defended in court several members of the so-called Nechayev group: some of his clients were acquitted. According to a secret agent's report to his Special Corps of Gendarmes's chief, Urusov \\"in Moscow [was] quite enjoying his popularity as a people's tribune.\\" A year later in Geneva Urusov issued a statement advising the Swiss authorities against extraditing Sergey Nechayev to Russia. Accused on this account of \\"maintaining criminal contacts with revolutionaries,\\" in September of that year Urusov was arrested in Moscow and deported to Finland where he stayed in exile until 1876. \\"I very much hope that he will stay there under the real, not imaginary police surveillance,\\" Tsar Alexander II inscribed upon the Urusov's police file. Banned from practice in court, Urusov turned to journalism and became a popular literary and theatre critic, writing under the pseudonym Alexander Ivanov. He was a friend of Ivan Turgenev, regularly corresponded with Anton Chekhov, was considered an authority on the French poetry and literature (Baudelaire and Flaubert in particular) and later exerted the strong influence upon the circle of the young Russian symbolists. Urusov was the first to recognize a major talent in Konstantin Balmont and helped him publish his book Under the Northern Sky (Saint Petersburg, 1894). In his essays and articles Urusov (who described himself as \\"a liberal\\") was a fierce critic of social injustice in Russia, propagating the same principles he upheld in court. In the late 1870s Urusov moved to Warsaw and made himself a name there as a court prosecutor. In 1878 another famous Russian lawyer Anatoly Koni assisted his return to Saint Petersburg where he joined the city's regional court as a prosecutor's assistant. Urusov was permitted to return to a barrister's practice in 1881 by the Minister of justice Dmitry Nabokov's special order. In 1891 he became known in Europe, helping to acquit the French writer L√©on Bloy, accused of defamation. In 1890s Alexander Urusov's health deteriorated. He died in 1900 after prolonged illness. Fellow lawyer and writer Sergey Andreevsky, speaking at the funeral, called Urusov \\"the first great role model for a defending lawyer that Russia has ever had.\\"  References  Category:Imperial Russian lawyers Category:Imperial Russian literary critics Category:Imperial Russian people of Tatar descent Category:People from Moscow Category:1843 births Category:1900 deaths Category:Imperial Russian translators Category:Moscow State University alumni Category:Imperial Russian philanthropists Category:19th-century translators Category:19th-century philanthropists ","title":"Alexander Ivanovich Urusov"},{"id":"44859238","text":"Delyan () is a village in Dupnitsa Municipality, Kyustendil Province, south- western Bulgaria.

History The local Mocedades Galeguistas were linked to the local party groups of the PG, but barely maintained contact with each other. It was Xaime Illa Couto, the secretary general of the Mocedade Galeguista of Vigo, the first person that appealed to create a Union of the Mocedades Galeguistas.

He also briefly held the post of commander of the empire's musketeer corps (tofangchi-aghasi).  Biography  A native of Isfahan, Mirza Shah originally served as an architect, but was in 1503 appointed as the personal vizier of the powerful Qizilbash magnate Durmish Khan Shamlu, who had recently been appointed as the governor of Mirza Shah's native city. Mirza Shah was appointed as vakil and vizier in 1514 after the Battle of Chaldiran, which had a damaging impact on the health of Safavid king Ismail I, who withdrew from affairs of the state and began heavily drinking. The appointment of Mirza Shah to the vakil office was because he had after the battle found Ismail's favorite wife who was lost in Azerbaijan. In 1516, Ismail I also appointed Mirza Shah Hossein as commander of the musketeer corps (tofangchi-aghasi). Mirza Shah used the absence of the king as an opportunity to expand his authority. Furthermore, Mirza Shah also became a close friend with Ismail and was alongside him during his period of drinking. This made Mirza Shah gain influence over the king himself. In 1521, Mirza Shah chose to confront his former master, Durmish Khan Shamlu, managing to send him far away from the Safavid court‚Äîto Herat in Khorasan, where he was forced to serve as its governor. However, Mirza Shah Hossein outsmarted himself in the end, and as a result was in 14 April 1523 murdered at the hands of furious Qizilbash members. He was succeeded by Jalal al-Din Mohammad Tabrizi.

Founded in 1849, it was one of the oldest Protestant churches in California. The First Presbyterian building is located on 49 N. 4th Street in Downtown San Jose across from San Jose City Hall. The neighborhood is home to several other churches, including the Trinity Episcopal Cathedral, the First Unitarian Church of San Jose, Our Lady of La Vang Parish, and the Cathedral Basilica of St. Joseph.  History  On February 23, 1849, the Rev. John W. Douglas, a young Presbyterian minister, arrived at Monterey Bay, California via steamship. In March 1849, he began his ministry in San Jose, California. The church, which was called \\"Independent Presbyterian Church,\\" first met in the \\"Juzgado,\\" a building which at the time also served as both a courthouse and as a jail (see San Jose City Hall). In 1851, a wooden church was built on North Second Street, across the street from the present Trinity Episcopal Cathedral. On June 3, 1858, the church changed its name to \\"First Presbyterian Church,\\" and has been called that ever since. In just over a decade, the original wooden building was considered to be too small. A new brick church building was built in 1863. This building was repaired after the earthquake of 1868, and was in use until the 1906 San Francisco earthquake demolished that church building. A new church building, located at 48 N. 3rd Street, was completed and dedicated in April 1908. That building was in use for several decades, until 1968, when it was condemned as a fire hazard. A new and smaller church building was built on 49 N. 4th Street, and has been in use since 1973. On June 30, 2019, the First Presbyterian Church of San Jose held its last Sunday service, which was attended by members, friends and guest musicians. The congregation voted to dissolve, due to declining membership. The programs that benefit people who are homeless will continue for now.  Daughter churches  Over the years, the First Presbyterian Church of San Jose has given birth to many other Presbyterian churches. In 1881, 77 members were dismissed to organize the Second Presbyterian Church, now known as the Westminster Presbyterian Church. In 1944, a committee of elders laid the foundations of the Foothill Presbyterian Church. In 1953, about 250 members of the First Church became the founding members of the Calvin Presbyterian Church which closed in 2007.

Following the privatisation of BT in 1984, the company decided to create a newly designed and improved take on the British telephone box, which at this point consisted of only red telephone boxes which BT had recently acquired, the most common being the iconic K6 box. These red boxes were considered flawed in parts by BT for several reasons, including cost, lack of ventilation, accessibility and maintenance. BT announced the ¬£160 million series of new boxes, the KX series designed by GKN, as well as announcing the eventual replacement of all existing telephone boxes. The main telephone box in the KX range is the KX100. Upon launch, there were five models in total. The boxes were produced at a rate of 5,000 a year, with the total count of all BT-owned kiosks reaching 137,000 by 1999, a number which has since decreased by more than seventy per cent. Whilst the updated functions of the KX series were praised, the designs were widely criticised and were seen as inferior to the red telephone boxes. The plan to replace the red boxes was also criticised. Many of the models in the KX series were revamped graphically after BT changed their logo in 1991, and production of the KX100 stopped in 1996 with its replacement, the KX+, attempting to address the criticisms that the original KX100 had received by revising its design to incorporate elements of older red telephone boxes. Later versions of the KX+ incorporated broadband connection. BT was reported to have stopped making telephone boxes altogether in 2001, although this was later denied with the introduction of the ST6 in 2007, which saw the end of the KX series. Background In 1980, preparing for privatisation, Post Office Telephones, who owned all of the United Kingdom's telephone boxes, was renamed British Telecom, later to become simply BT. The most common telephone box in the United Kingdom was the K6 red telephone box, introduced in 1935. The newly formed BT underwent two telephone box projects in 1981. The most successful of the two was the introduction of phonecard-operated telephone kiosks in July after a successful trial, with the phones in the kiosks being named Cardphones. The other project was painting several of the remaining red telephone boxes in yellow, BT's new corporate colour, although upon the announcement in February 1981, it was stated that all of the red telephone boxes would be converted. This was harshly received by the public, with the Daily Mail launching a campaign \\"against the yellow peril\\" and questions were asked in Parliament. In the House of Lords, the Earl of Gowrie, the Minister of State for Employment, called on BT \\"to abandon this ridiculous scheme\\". In the House of Commons, Mark Lennox-Boyd MP asked the then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, if she would treat the decision \\"with the greatest possible dismay\\". Thatcher, who herself was responsible for the privatisation, would only say that she could \\"see my honourable Friend's point\\". The existing red telephone boxes were seen by BT as no longer meeting the needs of users. Campaigning worked and BT shortly announced that only 90 of the 77,000 remaining traditional boxes had been painted different colours, that it was \\"as an experiment\\" and that no final decision had been reached. Nonetheless, whilst they had sympathized with what the public saw as a cultural icon, BT quickly turned their attention to what they saw as flaws in all of Britain's telephone boxes. They considered them outdated and no longer of need to the public, finding that few people like using them, and noted their expensive cost, difficult maintenance and noted how they could not be used by handicapped people. Furthermore, the boxes were noted for a lack of ventilation and little space. Although British Telecom had already introduced the yellow Booth 7A (\\"Oakham\\") kiosks in 1980 to several locations with limited floor space or extreme vandalism, it was with their privatisation in late 1984, that BT began planning for a scheme of new telephone boxes which improved on the previous telephone boxes and addressed their concerns. Launch In early 1985, British Telecom announced a ¬£160 million modernisation scheme for the public telephone network inherited from the General Post Office. Described as \\"a major improvement to the public telephone service\\", the \\"new designs that were to be the most perfect telephone kiosks you could imagine.\\" They were both BT's first standardised telephone booths and their first altogether, having only been privatised less than half a year earlier. The new telephone boxes were named the KX series. Whilst it is unknown what the initials stand for, it is believed the \\"K\\" stands for kiosk, following the Post Office telephone box naming system. The introduction of the new kiosks was also to see the eventual replacement of all existing prior telephone boxes. In January 1985, Nick Kane, the Director of Marketing for BT Local Communications Services, announced the replacement plan and stated they were being replaced because they \\"no longer meet the needs of our customers. Few people like to use them. They are expensive and difficult to clean and maintain and cannot be used by handicapped people\\". The first KX to be installed, a KX100, was unveiled in Leicester Square, London. BT later stated the KX models \\"were cheaper to maintain, more resistant to vandalism and were designed to blend in with any surroundings. Special attention was paid to environmental considerations, acoustics, weather protection, lighting and ventilation after intensive market research was conducted into customers' needs. The designs assisted customers with disabilities and allowed access to wheelchair users.\\" The KX series was not the first attempt to replace the red telephone box with regards to easier access, lower maintenance and brighter lighting, as they follow Post Office Telephone's \\"Croydon\\" telephone boxes from 1972. The Croydon boxes, which featured a black handset silhouette with bright yellow paintwork, were erected in Croydon, Surrey, as an experimental prototype to replace the red telephone boxes. However, whilst the trials were successful, the quality of the materials and design made it too expensive for the Post Office to mass-produce and the design was not adopted. Regardless, the design of the Croydon boxes proved an important influence on the KX100. It was also described as looking \\"quite stunning\\" and as influencing the Australian Telstra telephone boxes. Original models The original KX telephone booths were designed by GKN and DCA (David Carter Associates) and are of light-weight construction and use an aluminum frame clad in stainless steel panels with anodised aluminium edging. They were also fitted with sound proofing, vandal-resistant panelling and \\"better lighting.\\" As had recently been retrofitted to several existing red telephone boxes, many of the coin- operated KX telephone boxes used the BT Payphone 600. Kiosks of the KX series were introduced at a rate of 5,000 a year, and by 1999, the combined total of the KX series and acquired Post Office telephone boxes had reached 137,000. There were 100,000 KX100s introduced alone, although only 40,500 remain. Although green bins to dispose of used BT phonecards had been added to already existing kiosks, the phonecard-operated KX kiosks were the first to be introduced with them, although a minority of phonecard-operated KX kiosks did not feature the bin. BT further tightened a number of these bins in late 1992 to take extra care that people can not steal disposed cards from them. KX100 An early KX100 kiosk (right) alongside a later Mk2 model (left). A line of KX100 kiosks with the original logo and insignia, during the changeover from smoked glass to clear. The first and most common KX, designed to be the direct successor to the K6, the KX100 is a four-sided rectangular box with a flat roof. Aside from the back panel, which is formed of stainless steel panels, the three other sides of the box are made of glass, with two large window panels set above and beneath a slim, black plastic modesty panel, also with a black plastic trim around the windows. The same three sides of the booth stop short of the ground to provide ventilation, another improvement on the non-ventilated K6, and for litter accumulation. Initial deliveries had cylindrical legs, for leveling on site, a flat-sheet roof with upturned edges and a multi-panel back. A slightly updated model known as the Mk2 soon followed, without the adjustable legs and with a single sheet back panel and the more familiar 'biscuit tin lid' roof. At launch, KX100s had smoked glass windows with lettering and logos printed on the inside face. To improve visibility of the kiosks - in particular during daylight hours - the printing was first moved onto the outside surface of the glass and then the smoked glass was dropped altogether. Later kiosks were all fitted with clear glass. The door of the kiosk has a light action and features a bright-coloured moulded plastic panel and handle for easier opening than previous boxes. For the first KX100s, this part was bright yellow, whilst the Phonecard variants used a bright green. The payphone inside the coin-operated version was originally yellow with a blue phone, but this was later phased out. The upper glass window panels carried the company logo, which upon launch, was the yellow dotted British Telecom 'T' logo. Changes to the panel and handle colour and BT logo were made in 1991 (see 1991 revamp), changes which adorn almost all remaining KX100s. The KX100 was designed to be supplied with or without a door, depending on requirements, with the door version designed to be located on sites where complete weather and acoustic protection is needed. The overall unit was designed to be wide enough to allow wheelchair access. The open booth is designed for use on quieter sites yet still provides good weather protection and ease of access for the disabled. They can be used on single sites or suited back to back or side by side. KX200 KX200 with a Type C pillar box. The KX200 is a hooded unit provided as a single or double pedestal version. Designed to be suitable for location in most street sites but also to be positioned indoors where acoustic protection is needed. They were designed to be especially accessible for wheelchair bound people and, as with the KX100, they are sometimes positioned back to back. It consists of a back panel, a flat roof which also supports two glass panels which stretch down the booth but stop far short of the ground. These panels sport the BT logo. KX300 KX300 and lamp box. The KX300 is a triangular unit designed so it could be used in groups, although many were erected alone. The triangular design of the KX300 ensures acoustic and weather protection. It was also designed to enable full use of available floor space and to provide better siting flexibility. As with the KX100, it has raised sides to prevent litter accumulation. There are two versions, one with two glass sides, the other with one glass side and one fabricated side with acoustic panels and fittings for directory holders. It was essentially a triangular-based variant of the KX100. Several KX300s were fitted with doors that resemble the KX100 doors, although many were not. KX420 in Leeds. KX410 and KX420 The KX410 and KX420 are two hooded phone booths on posts created specifically for sites with little available ground space or sites which are prone to vandalism. As such, there is no space for directories or customer instructions, with the booth structures being made of aluminium alone, with the BT logo being on both the left and right of the structures, whilst hooded is a simple telephone. They were also considerably shorter than the other designs. The KX410, unlike the K420, was suitable for surface mounting. These were not BT's first attempt at a post-situated telephone booth, as they follow the Booth 7A (or \\"Oakham\\" booths as they became known) which was a yellow booth used in areas of extreme vandalism introduced some years earlier. KX520 For use indoors, such as in shopping centres, another design, the KX520, was introduced. This is essentially a telephone mounted to a post with two small windows joined at the top of the booth to the left and right whilst topped by a hood, underneath which is an extending tab which features the BT logo. Public reaction Red Phone Box, a website dedicated to the history of British telephone boxes, said that \\"nobody could deny the functionality of the designs as their main objectives were to be easy for disabled people to use and very easy to maintain, but everybody could deny the attractiveness of the designs.\\" BT later said that although the public liked parts of the designs, such as \\"the fact that they were lighter, more airy and more accessible for people with disabilities than the traditional style, customers felt that there was still room for improvement. Popular opinion was that the square shape seemed clinical and that something softer and more rounded would be preferable.\\" The scheme to replace the already existing red telephone boxes provoked a strong reaction from many members of the general public, with many disapproving of the removal of the red kiosks. Despite public campaigning to revert the plan to remove the red boxes, and unlike with the campaign protesting against the yellow telephone boxes several years earlier, BT did not respond, and whilst some red telephone boxes remained, the KX project was completed in 1988. The KX's reputation has not improved with age. In 2001, The Guardian referred to the KX100 as \\"utterly bland\\" and noting that since its introduction, BT \\"has done its utmost to turn the phone box from one of the most famous and elegant pieces of street furniture into the most boringly ugly. It might be more vandal proof, more accessible and more modern (in the worst sense of the word) but the KX100, even when feebly capped in a fake Gilbert Scott-style crown, looks plain nasty.\\" On the left, the Mercury booth as introduced in 1988. On the right, the much modified final version with roof-top signs, tubular walk- under guards and privacy glazing. Alan Powers, an architectural historian who led the Thirties Society against BT newcomers in the mid-1980s, said \\"the clutter is appalling\\" and \\"nobody has made a worthy successor to Scott's [red telephone box]. They're all utterly banal. Though I have recently seen a new phone in Bloomsbury [London] that is very, very elegant. Maybe BT has finally got it right.\\" It was reported in 2008 that a local from Ffair Rhos, Cadwgan, uses a KX100 yards from his house to contact friends and run his business, as well as cleaning it and opening his window to hear it call, noting he does this so that BT will not remove the box, and that he will not have a home phone installed to help this. BT's telephone boxes in the UK soon saw a rival with the introduction of Mercury Communications own set of telephone booths, which were launched on 27 July 1988 with 26 booths at Waterloo station, London. The Machin-designed Mercury booth was as best accepted by the public and, at worst, positively hated. Examples of the response included \\"something from outer space\\",Southampton Echo; 2 June 1990 \\"pieces of fairground machinery\\"Wolverhampton Express & Star; 31 May 1990 and \\"demented bird tables - complete with perches.\\"Gloucester Citizen; 14 November 1990 but, and much more importantly to Mercury, they turned out to be non-profitable. The Mercury payphone sites closed down in 1995, with many of the sites taken over by Interphone, who went on to replace the Machin booths with their own housings. In the 1988 Quality of Service report, the UK's public payphone system was listed as having a 96% reliability, compared to only 72% in 1987. As a result of the programme, there were 80,000 of the stainless steel design kiosks in service by 1996, in addition to 30,000 hooded or canopied phones and 15,000 of the original red telephone boxes. In 2001, BBC reported that the transition from the classic red telephone boxes to the KX telephone boxes was successful in reducing vandalism. 1991 revamp BT changed their logo in 1991, now featuring a new typeface for the newly shortened name \\"BT\\" (prior to this they used their full name British Telecom), and an unpopular stylized figure of a piper. The KX100, 200 and 300 were updated accordingly. The coin-operated KX100 now featured a pink moulded plastic panel and handle, where as before it was yellow. Variations of the new logo now featured on all booths in place of the 'T' logo. The variations were namely a coloured version, a grey version and a larger, grey piper on its own. The typeface used to identify the type of box atop the entrance (i.e. \\"Telephone\\" or \\"Phonecard\\") was changed, now featuring an italicized serif font, often beneath a red line. Certain boxes in mostly Welsh-speaking parts of Wales use \\"Teleffon\\" instead of \\"Telephone\\" on the box. The KX410 and 420 were not revamped, and remain today in their original 1985 guise. The logo on the KX520 features a full colour version of the BT logo. The commemorative plaque on the 100,000th BT telephone box. The revamp was followed by the installation of the BT's 100,000th telephone box, a KX100 at Dunsop Bridge, Lancashire, on 29 June 1992, after the village was recently named the closest to the centre of the British Isles. Upon installation, BT also included a commemorative plaque to explain its significance reading \\"You are calling from the BT payphone that marks the centre of Great Britain.\\" In fact, the phone is 4.2 miles (6.8 km) from the true centre. The telephone box was unveiled by Sir Ranulph Fiennes, and in BT's A1141 list of unique alphabetical Telephone Exchange codes, the code for Dunsop Bridge is DSB. Whilst the BBC noted in 2002 that the box is the village's \\"monument\\", local postmaster and shop owner Phil Woodhead said the town did not capitalise on its status, saying \\"there is only that payphone really... we haven't put up big signs or anything like that. If this was a bigger town with more shops, then maybe we would do something, but because we are so small, there is really no-one to push it.\\" KX+ A pair of KX+ kiosks, erected alongside an existing group of KX100s. A KX+ and modified Internet booth In 1996, BT, having acknowledged the negative reaction to the original KX models, made an attempt to win the public over and revisited the KX100 and built upon its design to improve its appeal and add some character. The new updated version was named the KX+, also known as the KXplus, the KXPlus, the KX100 Plus or the KX100+. It is essentially an updated and taller version of the KX100. It differs from the KX100 in that the 'waistband' in its door and sides is lower, and the colour used in the midsection trim panel and remodelled door handle also now matches the newly introduced trim panel at the top. In a nod to earlier Post Office kiosks and following the negative feedback on the KX100's design, it features a domed, plastic roof (modelled on those of the K2 and K6). This said, the dome also brought other benefits to BT. The enhanced model was now taller and more visible than the boxes of BT's competitors, and it also offered valuable extra space for future developments, such as public wi-fi hotspot equipment. The earliest KX+ kiosks carried signage on the door and side lintels and the domed roof. The interior of the booths are fitted with a large illuminated display panel. They also contained a small seat and a shelf for writing or placing property. They featured a lower handle on the door to help customers with disabilities and a new closing mechanism to make the door more robust. The original version featured red trim panels and a red-domed roof. This colour was chosen for its high visibility, and also to recall the red colour of the iconic Post Office kiosks. In late 2003, BT introduced internet connectivity to select kiosks. These booths feature distinctive blue colour to distinguish them from kiosks with standard telephone equipment (see photo), and also carry the BT Openzone logo. These kiosks have been described as perhaps \\"the last throw of the dice to save the telephone box\\", with Red Phone Box noting \\"the idea is good but the practicality isn't, you are unable to print out your internet findings in these boxes as a printer and paper would create mess.\\" The payphone within the KX+ inside takes cash, phonecards, credit cards and chargecards, with these payment options clearly written on the outside of the box rather than using red or green colour coding which was the practice of the KX series as well as elder red telephone boxes that had been updated accordingly. The first KX+ kiosks appeared in Autumn 1996, with the first being placed in London, and within its first year, over 5,000 KX+ kiosks had been installed. Its launch also saw the end of production for the KX100. Some KX100s went on to be retrofitted with KX+ style domes - in effect a cost-reduced model, known during its development as the K Excel but supplied as KX Minus. Both the KX+ and the KX Minus were designed by DCA and manufactured by GKN. Later developments A row of KX100s that operate by both coins and phonecards Whilst the full 5,000 production of KX+ remain today, a successful scheme which took place around the same time as the introduction of the KX+ was to reinstall the iconic K6 design telephone boxes in places that have parted with them, with many places continuing to be reunited with K6s. BT phonecards with a magnetic stripe are no longer sold but it is still possible to use prepaid telephone cards in BT phone boxes by manually keying in the card access number and PIN. Another development that became possible after the deregulation of the telephone industry of 1996 was that many companies followed in Mercury Communications' footsteps by erecting their own kiosks, including Spectrum Interactive and Cable & Wireless. Perhaps in another attempt to sustain public usage of payphones, several modern BT payphone kiosks have a cash machine on one side, some of them, introduced in 2005, taking the shape of the KX+. In 2005, BT announced they were scrapping plans to remove 200 telephone boxes in rural Yorkshire owing to their importance to the geographically isolated areas. BT also introduced a new type of phonecard telephone to be used in their phonecard-operated kiosks in 1996, the BT Payphone 2000, which was installed in high usage sites such as airports and railway stations. This payphone featured a large LCD display with information to assist the user. The on-screen language could be also changed between English, Welsh, French, Italian and Spanish languages to help users whose first language is not English. They also launched a series of internet payphones called the Multi.phone, also known as the Multiphone, in 1999. The touch screen terminals display a range of \\"hot buttons relevant to the needs of the modern traveller and consumer\\", with one of the buttons leading to BBC News Online. By January 2001, 600 Multi.phones were installed, but to revive the fortunes of their extensive network after usage fell 37% in two years, BT announced a six-month promotion during which the phones would be totally free for internet use. A BBC critic reviewed the Multi.phone in a negative light, saying it made the reviewer \\"nostalgic for the old callbox pips. Sometimes, as BT once put it so perfectly, \\"it's good to TALK\\".\\" After the six month free trial was over, keyboards were added to the Multi.phones. Around the same time, they also introduced Britain's first credit card-operated public payphone, Creditcall, which like the Phonecard, was another cashless payphone service, enabling customers to make calls using major credit cards. It was installed on a trial basis in at Heathrow Airport and Waterloo station in London. In 2004, BT considered plans where their telephone boxes could be used to download music, turning them into \\"virtual jukeboxes\\", where anyone owning an iPod or portable music player would be able to go into a phonebox and download a song, being able to pay using a credit card or a BT charge card. The concept behind the boxes providing access to music was seen as an opportunity to attract mobile phone users, who long ago deserted phone boxes into BT facilities, Regardless, the plans were abandoned. By 2017, the total number of BT owned telephone boxes had fallen to 40,000 with half of these under threat of scrapping over the following five years. ST6 ST6 phone box Whilst BT was reported to have stopped making telephone boxes in January 2001, citing loss of profits due to the increasing popularity in mobile phones, production had resumed by the time of the introduction of the ST6 (Street Talk 6) in June 2007, which seemingly saw the end of the KX series. The ST6, a collaboration between BT and public advertising company JCDecaux, is a unit that incorporates a telephone on one side and a scrolling advertising billboard on the reverse. The idea is that the advertising would pay for the running of the phone. The first ten ST6 kiosks were installed in Richmond and Ealing, London. BT announced in May 2012 that it was going to repair and restore 1,300 KX telephone boxes.

Biography  A native of Yazd, Abd al-Baqi was the son of Na'im-al-Din Nematollah Sani, who was descended from Shah Nematollah, the founder of the Nematollahi order. In the early 16th-century, Abd al-Baqi succeeded his father as the leader of the Nematollah order. Later in 1511, Abd al-Baqi took part in a celebration at the camp of the Safavid ruler Ismail I (r. 1501‚Äì1524). One year later, Abd al-Baqi served under the vakil Najm-e Sani, who was after a few months killed in Khorasan by Uzbeks. Abd al-Baqi was then appointed as the new vakil by Ismail I. Abd al-Baqi participated in the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514, where the Safavids, however, were defeated and Abd al-Baqi himself was killed. Another Iranian, Mirza Shah Hossein, was then appointed as the new vakil after having found Ismail's favorite wife, who was lost after the battle. Abd al-Baqi had a son named Mir Abd al-Baqi Yazdi (d. 1564), who was appointed as the governor of Yazd when Ismail's son Tahmasp I ascended the Safavid throne in 1524. He also later in 1535/6 married one of Tahmasp's sisters, who bore him an unnamed daughter, who later married Tahmasp's son Ismail II.

When Brodrick insisted on attending, Maspero took the matter up with the Sorbonne council who found nothing in the rules to prevent a woman attending. According to Brodrick, Maspero warned her that she would \\"probably have a very bad time\\" and indeed when she first attended she found the students to be rough, rude, and smelly. On one occasion they poured ink down her back. Brodrick simply laughed their tricks off and eventually became great friends with them. Career Back in England, Brodrick entered College Hall, London in 1888 where she studied at University College London under Stuart Poole (co-founder with Amelia Edwards of the Egypt Exploration Society) and Peter le Page Renouf. She did not enter for a University of London degree due to her prior studies.\\"Dr. Mary Brodrick.\\" by \\"A correspondent\\", The Times, 22 July 1933, p. 14.

Background The revolt came in continuity of a series of mistrust events between the Ottoman Empire and the Albanian population following the demise of Ali Pasha Tepelena, the Massacre of Monastir, 1830, and the suppression of the Pashalik of Shkodra. The Tanzimat reforms triggered a series of uprisings in Albanian Vilayets. After the revolts suppression, the Albanians lost their elite position within the Empire, established since the K√∂pr√ºl√º family, and the seeds of the Albanian Nationalism were sown. Events After the suppression of the Albanian Revolt of 1843-1844, the Ottoman troops were conscripted in Dibra and, with the exception of Shkodra, all districts were ordered to give up their arms. Winter then put an end of all further operations. In mid-May 1845, Yakova region rose again. Re≈üid Pasha had forbidden the population from bearing arms the year before, but the district refused to comply. The revolt started with around 2,0000 people from Yakova area, and spread to the highlands. The highlanders (Krasniqe, Gashi, Byty√ßi, and Tropoja) gathered under Krasniqe leaders Binak Alia (1805-1895) (Mulosmanaj clan) and Sokol Rama (1790-1860) (Gjonbalaj clan) both from Bujan. Sokol Rama is also referred as Sokol Arami or Sokol Aram. Other leaders were Haxhi Brahim Bajraktari, Sulejman Abaz Lushaj and Niman Uka Bajraktari. The uprising spread to the region of Reka (today's part of Mavrovo and Rostu≈°a municipality in Republic of Macedonia). The rebels comprised about 8,000 men. They drove the Ottoman garrison out of Yakova. Re≈üid Pasha, Wali of Rumelia, initially instructed to make use of irregular troops that the other districts of Albania had to provide, likewise in the previous revolts. These were about 3,000 men from Shkodra, primarily Catholic Mal√´sia highlanders from the tribes of Hoti, Shkreli, Kastrati, Re√ßi, Lohja, Shala, Shoshi, and Postriba tribes, as well as men from Mirdita and Mat. In early June, imperial troops retook Gjakova and the irregular forces advanced on Reka and the mountains through Junik. The rebel sent most of the women and children to take refuge in the mountains near Bellaje (De√ßan area). The revolt was initially successful, but when the irregular troops were reinforced by imperial forces with artillery, they were able to take the Morina Pass in Byty√ßi area, and when the rebels were put to flight on 1 July, the troops marched into Gashi and Krasniqi. In order to defeat the rebels completely, Re≈üid Pasha ordered further irregulars from Shkodra on the other side of the mountains to advance in order to block their escape route. This operation was carried out successfully by the Malissors of Shala and Shoshi, and by Ali Bey of Gucia from north with a contingent of men from Gucia, Plava, Vasojeviƒá, and Kuƒçi. As a result, the revolt was suppressed on 6 July 1845. Further, the Ottomans arrested a number of suspicious individuals in Yakova and fortified their position in front of local population. Bib Doda Pasha, Catholic Kapidan of Mirdita with his irregulars from Mirdita and Mat, and some from Tetovo went into the mountain valleys to conscript soldiers among the highlanders, therefore enforcing one of the Tanzimat requests. At the same time, many Albanians arrested during previous uprisings received amnesty and were released in an Ottoman attempt to calm down the situation. Aftermath The success of the Turkish policy of centralization was, however, ephemeral. As long as Turkish troops were present in full force, some soldiers could be conscripted and some taxes collected by force. In Kosovo, the Tanzimat reforms could not be carried out until 1860.

A \\"vernacular region\\" is a distinctive area where the inhabitants collectively consider themselves interconnected by a shared history, mutual interests, and a common identity. Such regions are \\"intellectual inventions\\" and a form of shorthand to identify things, people, and places. Vernacular regions reflect a \\"sense of place,\\" but rarely coincide with established jurisdictional borders.[Scheetz, George H.] \\"Whence Siouxland?\\" Book Remarks [Sioux City Public Library], May 1991. The Tri-City area‚Äîthe name sometimes appears as \\"Tri-Cities\\"‚Äîis primarily located in Kane County, though Batavia and St. Charles include parcels in DuPage County. They are often grouped together due to their shared history, close proximity on the Fox River, relative socioeconomic condition, and similar population sizes. These three communities are among the oldest in Kane County as well as the state, all having been incorporated long before Chicago. History of the name The name, \\"Tri-City\\" originated in 1910 with the publication of the first Tri-City Directory: Batavia, Geneva, St. Charles, by the Evans Directory Service of Elgin, Illinois. There were ten editions of the Tri-City Directory published from 1910 to 1943. During this same period, the local telephone directories served all three cities, as well. There are other origin stories. In 2011, Batavia Mayor Jeffery D. Schielke has theorized that the Tri-City moniker originated in the early 20th century from the deviation of the railroad track between Aurora and Elgin to the three cities, which conductors nicknamed the Tri-Cities. Former St. Charles mayor Norris has theorized that the nickname grew in popularity during the 1940s and 1950s, when the area experienced a relative population boom and the boundaries of the cities began to move closer and closer together. Nowadays, the Tri-City area is bonded by retail and industrial corridors on Kirk and Randall Roads, joint policy decisions, area organizations, and the Fox River.http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20110101/news/701029911/ Historic places * The Fabyan Windmill located in Geneva * The Fabyan Villa in Geneva * The Arcada Theater in St. Charles * The historic Hotel Baker in downtown St. Charles. * The Batavia Depot Museum in downtown Batavia. * The Batavia Institute in Batavia, a former sanitarium where Mary Todd Lincoln stayed. * The historic Campana Factory in Batavia.

It is best known for its final scene, which Japanese World War II censors found troubling. Army tells the story of three generations of a Japanese family and their relationship with the army from the Meiji era through the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Ryu plays the man of the middle generation, Tomohiko, and Tanaka his wife Waka. A large portion of the movie concerns Tomohiko's and Waka's concern that their oldest son Shintaro will be too weak to become a good soldier and their efforts to mold him into one. Other portions of the movie include Tomohiko's own exclusion from fighting during the Russo-Japanese War due to illness, and his later indignation when a friend suggests that Japan could lose a war. In the wordless final scene of the movie, Shintaro marches off with the army for deployment in the invasion of Manchuria. Tanaka's character runs alongside him tearfully and expresses her anxiety over his well-being. Japanese wartime censors were upset by this scene because Japanese mothers in films were supposed be depicted as being proud to send their sons to battle, and not being at all upset about it. According to film critic Donald Richie, the scene was spared being cut because arguably Tanaka's emotions were caused by her internal conflict between her duty to be happy to send her son off to war and her own selfishness by loving and trying to possess him. Criterion Collection essayist Michael Koresky and others attribute the fact that the script escaped censorship of this scene to the fact that the scene is wordless, and so in the script it merely states \\"The mother sees the son off at the station.‚Äù Koresky attributes the scene's power to purely cinematic elements, i.e., \\"expressive cutting, the variations in camera distance, Tanaka‚Äôs stunning performance.\\" As a result of the final scene, which according to Richie was called \\"deplorable and an unnecessary stain on an otherwise fine film,\\" Kinoshita was subjected to enhanced attention from the censors until the end of the war. Reportedly, an army officer stormed into the Shochiku film studio after the film's premiere on November 22, 1944, accusing Kinoshita of treason.

RBSS works to counter the suggestion that citizens of Raqqa welcomed the presence of ISIL. Some sources described the group as one of the few reliable sources of information from the city. It was founded by Abu Ibrahim a-Raqqawi. RBSS has described itself as an \\"nonpartisan and independent\\" news page. Activities The group has published first hand accounts, videos and photos of life and war crimes in Raqqa through its Facebook page and website, other social media, and via interviews and furnishing material to media organizations worldwide. As a result, RBSS has been cited by international media outlets fairly extensively, and major news outlets have done feature stories on the group. Since no foreign or domestic journalists could operate in Raqqa during the ISIL occupation, the efforts of RBSS provided unique insights. The work was dangerous, with ISIL militants searching for, torturing(CNN interview) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di0QrhdfmGk and in some cases killing suspected RBSS members. Members According to an interview with VICE News, there were originally 17 members who started out opposing the Syrian government. When ISIL moved into the city in April 2014 the group started posting information about ISIL. One member who had fled Raqqa said \\"After we launched the campaign and posted a lot of crucifixions and executions on the news and Facebook and Twitter, they made three Friday sermons about us, saying we are infidels and we're against Allah and \\"we'll catch them and we'll execute them.\\" \\"We are 12 inside the city and four outside. Before the 12 inside the city were posting on Twitter and posting on Facebook, and talking to journalists, but it's very dangerous. So we decided to use a \\"secret room,\\" and the people in the city post all the photos, the news, and everything, and the four that are out, we are posting it on the internet, Twitter, and Facebook, and talking to journalists. We hide behind fake names and we don't trust anyone, so we don't get captured.\\" Several members of RBSS have been executed inside Raqqa. In May 2014, Al-Moutaz Bellah Ibrahim was kidnapped by ISIL and murdered. In July 2015, ISIL released a video showing two men being strung up on trees and shot. Though ISIL claimed the two murdered men had worked with RBSS, one of the founders of RBSS denied they were members. Another friend of the group was similarly executed. Mohamed al-Mousa, the father of one of the group's founders, was killed in ISIL custody. On October 30, 2015, RBSS activist Ibrahim Abdul Qadir (age 20) and his friend Fares Hamadi were found stabbed and beheaded in Urfa, Turkey. It was the first acknowledged assassination outside of ISIL controlled territory. Abdalaziz Alhamza acts as a spokesperson. At least five members of the group live outside Syria. Hamoud Almousa is the co-founder and spokesperson. On December 16, 2015, masked men murdered RBSS member Ahmad Mohammed al-Mousa in the then rebel held city of Idlib, Syria. Naji al Jerf, the group's film director and editor-in-chief of the independent monthly Hentah, was killed in Gaziantep, Turkey with a silenced pistol in broad daylight outside a media building in late December 2015. ISIL claimed responsibility on Twitter. In an interview with Sarah Montague on BBC HARDtalk, aired June 22, 2016, RBSS spokesman Hussam Eesa said, via interpreter, \\"When we chose to work together against Daesh, documenting its abuses, we understood there would be casualties. However, it's been worse than we expected. It is an inevitable price to be paid. So far we have lost 14 people ‚Äì four group members and 10 friends and family members. Currently we have 18 inside Raqqa and 10 outside Raqqa.\\" Significant stories When ISIL banned home internet in Raqqah and forced internet users into cafes where they could be monitored, RBSS started releasing unfiltered information about life under ISIL rule. RBSS members broke the story of the failed U.S. special forces raid to save journalist James Foley and the other hostages. Soon after the release of a video showing the burning alive of a Jordanian pilot, Muath Al-Kasasbeh, RBSS released Google Earth photos they cross-referenced to landmarks pinpointing the location of the execution in the southern part of Raqqa near the river. They also reported that videos of the execution were played for the public on large screens throughout the city of Raqqa. RBSS detailed that the effects of Russian airstrikes in and around Raqqa were targeting mainly civilian targets, and having little effect on ISIL. The group also relayed reports from the ground of illegal white phosphorus munitions used in airstrikes. Awards and praise The group was awarded the International Press Freedom Award in 2015, from the Committee to Protect Journalists. The citation said in part \\"While RBSS was formed to document the atrocities of [ISIL], its members have also reported critically on the Assad government's bombings, other rebel forces, and civilian casualties caused by U.S.-led airstrikes\\". RBSS was given the 2016 Civil Courage Prize for \\"risking their lives on a daily basis to document the abuses of the Islamic State.\\" Kyle Orton writing for The Independent, said \\"The risks are extreme. Their bravery quite extraordinary\\" and wrote \\"Where [ISIL] presented a functioning, just government, RBSS showed the scarcity and brutality. Not a few foreign fighters ... have gone to wage \\"five-star jihad\\" ... only to be disillusioned... that [ISIL] is reportedly having to kill them to stop them leaving. RBSS's work, therefore, offers the chance of preventing people inclined toward [ISIL's] ideology actually going to Syria.\\" City of Ghosts is a 2017 documentary about the group.

He played in the New South Wales Rugby League Football Competition (NSWRL), now called the National Rugby League (NRL). He debut his rookie year with the Eastern Suburbs Roosters Rugby League team (now the Sydney Roosters) in 1978, then with the Canterbury Bulldogs and the South Sydney Rabbitohs. Of Lebanese Australian heritage, Reaiche later relocated to Florida to work for the Church of Scientology; he is no longer a member. Reaiche is the father of actors Alanna Masterson and Jordan Masterson. Early life & education Reaiche was born in the suburb of Redfern in Sydney, Australia; he is the middle sibling of a younger brother and sister and two older sisters. Reaiche and his family encountered discrimination due to their Lebanese heritage. He began playing rugby league with his brother Tony with the local kids at Redfern Park adjacent to Redfern Oval, home to the South Sydney Rabbitohs. The two brothers would watch the Rabbitoh games by climbing the Oval's 10-foot high barbed wire fence. By the age of 10 Reaiche went to St Mary's Cathedral College, Sydney a Roman Catholic Secondary School in the city, where he played in his first official Rugby League team. He also was selected to play representative district football for the Sydney Roosters Juniors. Time in Lebanon In October 1972, Reaiche and his family moved to Beirut, Lebanon. Reaiche attended the Good Shepherd Secondary Institute (GSSI) School in the suburb of Achrafieh. Reaiche and his brother played soccer with the school's team while teaching the other students how to play Rugby League. With no real grass playing fields, they began teaching them on the schools concrete grounds with full tackling techniques. The political landscape changed drastically and sectarian fighting escalated. Reaiche's parents decided to send him back to Sydney for his safety. Professional career In 1977 Reaiche returned to playing Rugby League. He captained the Christian Brothers' High School, Lewisham First's XIII Rugby League team. That year he was the highest point scorer in the metropolitan college league division, and was awarded \\"Best & Fairest Player\\" by Rugby League player Ron Coote. Later that year, the school team lost its coach due to an unexpected death, so Joe took over the coaching job and lead the team to victory in the Metropolitan Catholic Colleges Sports Association (MCC) Final at Henson Park defeating Marcellin College Randwick, where he scored 13 of the teams 25 points in their 25-15 victory. In January 1978, at the age of 19, Reaiche was drafted into the Sydney Roosters Rugby League Squad, where he played in their First Grade team with notable players such as Arthur Beetson, Bob Fulton, Russell Fairfax, Mark Harris, Bill Mullins and Kevin Hastings. In 1981, he played for the Canterbury Bulldogs, where he played alongside the Mortimer Brothers (Steve Mortimer, Peter and Chris), the Hughes Brothers (Greg Hughes, Mark and Gary) and the Gearin Brothers (Steve Gearin; Paul and Greg) - who all went to Christian Brothers' High School, Lewisham. In 1982 he played first grade for the South Sydney Rabbitohs. Personal life During his rugby career, Reaiche began practicing Scientology. After finishing his final year in 1983 with the Sydney Roosters, he relocated to Clearwater, Florida to join the Church of Scientology's elite Sea Org. While a Scientologist he met Carol (n√©e Masterson), who had 2 children of her own. They married in 1985 and added 2 more children to the family: son Jordan (b. 1986) and daughter Alanna (b. 1988). Joe and Carol left the Sea Org in 1986 and moved to California in 1993 to further their kids' acting careers with Carol as manager; they divorced in 1995. Both remained active in the Church, but in 2005 Joe was expelled and declared a 'Suppressive Person.' As a result, Reaiche is estranged from his children and stepchildren, all still current Scientologists, who have 'disconnected' from Joe under orders from the Church. In a 2010 interview with Four Corners, Reaiche claimed to have spent around a half million dollars on Scientology over three decades.Quentin McDermott (8 March 2010). Scientology in the spotlight amid fresh allegations. ABC News. Australian Broadcasting Corporation.Quentin McDermott (8 March 2010). Scientology: The Ex-Files. Australian Broadcasting Corporation. He accused the Church of Scientology of framing him for financial misconduct, which he denies, as a pretense for expelling him, after he complained about its management and fundraising practices. He further supported a review of the Church's favorable tax status in Australia: \\"[Scientology]'s not really a church... it may have a philosophy that's religious, but it's strictly business.\\" Reaiche currently works in the insurance and health industry.

It was released on September 23, 2016 for Windows on Steam, and was available in English before its Japanese release on December 29, 2016. The story is set in a world where artificially intelligent, emotional androids called Phiroids were developed before a rapid decline in human civilization. An emotionless young man named Rei with a mechanical right hand is cared for by a girl in a small town as he gradually learns how to express emotions. Like Key's 2004 game Planetarian: The Reverie of a Little Planet, Harmonia is defined as a \\"kinetic novel\\", since its gameplay offers no choices or alternate endings. Instead, the player proceeds through the story solely by reading. The story was written by Kai and Tsuzuru Nakamura, and character design was produced by Itaru Hinoue. The game's soundtrack was composed by Shinji Orito, Ry≈ç Mizutsuki and Tomohiro Takeshita. Harmonia was described as providing an emotional impact despite its short length, but was said to not be as impactful as other titles developed by Key. Plot Setting and gameplay Harmonia is set in a post-apocalyptic world sometime in the future. A rapid decline in human civilization began once the population hit its peak of 10 billion, caused in part by pollution and war. During this time, artificially intelligent, emotional androids called Phiroids were developed to serve as partners for humans. Although Phiroids were originally powered by batteries for the first two generations, they were afterwards developed to be powered by eating food, making them nearly indistinguishable from humans. Artificial memories could also be implanted into the Phiroids, making them highly desirable, leading them to be produced in numbers that eventually rivaled the human population at a time when the birth rate was already in decline. Eventually, nuclear warfare and the resulting nuclear fallout killed off most of humanity, culminating in a world covered in dark clouds and ash blocking out sunlight, land stripped of vegetation, and an ocean that could no longer support life. Some people were placed in cryogenic facilities in an attempt to sleep long enough until the environment improved even a little bit. Average dialogue and narrative in Harmonia depicting the main character Rei talking to Shiona and Tipi (respectively). Harmonia is a visual novel in which the player assumes the role of Rei. The gameplay is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue and follows a linear plot line; this is what Key refers to as a \\"kinetic novel\\". The text in the game is accompanied by character sprites, which represent who Rei is talking to, over background art. Throughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which take the place of the background art and character sprites. Once the game is completed, a gallery of the game's CGs and background music becomes available on the title screen. The story takes place in a town with a stable water source that supports a small population. Frequented locations include the church where Rei and Shiona live, the library where Tipi lives, and the town plaza. The town also has various establishments, including a general store, a photo studio, and a bar. Although most of the town does not have electricity, there is a solar-powered battery in the library. On the outskirts of town, there is a ruined Phiroid factory next to the town dump. Story Harmonia begins when the protagonist wakes up in a derelict facility without any memories of who or where he is. Rei notices that his right hand is mechanical, and when he sees various Phiroids strewn about the facility, he assumes he is a Phiroid whose production went unfinished, as he also realizes that he does not have any emotions. Rei leaves the facility and walks several days to the outskirts of a town, where he is found by a girl named who takes him back to the church where she lives and names him Rei. To pay Shiona back for her kindness, Rei sets out to repair a broken music box containing a song her brother had composed. Rei goes to the library to find a book to help in the repairs and meets the librarian, a little girl named who is constantly sad. Once the music box is repaired, Shiona is able to sing to the tune in the town plaza while Rei plays the music box. With the help of the townspeople, Rei also repairs a projector to play a film directed by the son of , the owner of the general store. Rei finds a heavily injured man and races to try to save his life, but the man shortly dies after he brings him to the church. The whole town shows up to show their respects at the funeral. Worried about Tipi's state of mind in dealing with the man's death, Rei repeatedly tries to go see Tipi, but Shiona keeps preventing him from going to see her. Rei eventually makes it to the library, but Shiona merely tells Tipi that her parents, who she has been waiting to return, are dead and that she will always be alone. Enraged at Shiona's behavior, Rei gets her to leave the library and Rei stays with Tipi overnight. Rei and Tipi wake up the next morning to find that the town is under attack. When Rei leaves to investigate, he finds humans have infiltrated the town and are killing the townspeople. Rei is nearly killed by them, but Shiona protects him from a gunshot, which leaves her unconscious, but alive. Rei takes Shiona back to the library where they regroup with Tipi before leaving through the sewer system to make it back to the church. A lone man comes to the church, and while Rei is fighting him, the man uses a grenade, but Shiona protects Rei from the blast. The aftermath of the blast makes Rei realize that he was human all along, and that everyone else in the town were Phiroids. After collecting some supplies, the three of them leave the town and make it to the facility where Rei originally woke up, which still has some electricity. Tipi gives Rei access to an electronic library on a tablet shortly before her battery is no longer able to function. Rei and Shiona stay in the facility for a time until Shiona eventually succumbs to the gunshot wound which had damaged her internal components. Rei puts Shiona and Tipi in cryogenic pods before leaving with the music box in an attempt to find a world where humans and Phiroids can coexist. Sometime later, Shiona wakes up in a facility with her memories wiped, but she is told that there was a music box with her when she was found. The environment has recovered and human civilization is once again prosperous and highly technological. Shiona is taken back to the town where humans and Phiroids once again coexist. She is reunited with Tipi, who also had her memories wiped. Prompted by the tune playing from the music box, Shiona sings the song which is now known worldwide. Development and release Harmonia is directed by Kai, who also wrote the scenario with Tsuzuru Nakamura. In 2010, Nakamura had submitted a scenario titled to VisualArt's' Kinetic Novel Awards. Itaru Hinoue served as the art director and character designer, which marked her last contribution to Key before resigning in September 2016. At the time, she was most pleased with her art in Harmonia compared to her art in other games, especially with how she drew the faces of the characters. The game's soundtrack was composed by Shinji Orito, Ry≈ç Mizutsuki and Tomohiro Takeshita. The game's theme song is by Ayaka Kitazawa, and the game also features the insert song by Haruka Shimotsuki. A single containing both songs was released on April 11, 2015 by Key Sounds Label. Two music albums were released on May 26, 2017: Harmonia original soundtrack and a piano remix album titled Teneritas. Harmonia is Key's 12th visual novel and second \\"kinetic novel\\" after Planetarian: The Reverie of a Little Planet. It was announced in April 2015 to celebrate Key's 15th anniversary, and added to Steam Greenlight in October 2015, but this was followed by numerous delays. It was released on September 23, 2016 for Windows on Steam, and was available in English before its Japanese release on December 29, 2016 at Comiket 91. Although only a limited number of copies were sold at Comiket, Harmonia was released for general sale on May 26, 2017 in Japan. According to VisualArt's president Takahiro Baba, Harmonia was first released in English because he wanted to know how the game would be received worldwide before its release in Japan. Reception Harmonia ranked at No. 20 in terms of national sales of PC games in Japan in May 2017.

Following the example of the Russian Chronicle of Current Events, the Lithuanian Chronicle was published from 19 March 1972 to 19 March 1989 by Catholic priests and nuns. In total, 81 issues appeared. It focused on repressions against Catholics in Lithuania, but also included reports of other violations of human rights in the Soviet Union. Selections from its reports regularly appeared in the Moscow-based Chronicle of Current Events; in turn items from Russia and Ukraine were translated into Lithuanian. The Chronicle inspired the Chronicle of the Catholic Church in Ukraine, issued from 1984 to 1987 by the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. Contributors and editors The writers and the publishers were routinely interrogated, arrested, and imprisoned by the KGB, including its founder and first editor Sigitas Tamkeviƒçius. Between 1973 and 1983, a total of 17 people were arrested (2 priests, 4 nuns, and 11 secular persons). After Tamkeviƒçius' arrest in 1983, the Chronicle was edited by Jonas Boruta. Other writers and collaborators included Petras Plumpa, Nijolƒó Sad≈´naitƒó, Gerarda Elena ≈†uliauskaitƒó, Bernadeta Mali≈°kaitƒó, Kazimieras Ambrasas. The texts were usually pessimistic and reflecting siege mentality. Circulation at home and abroad The Chronicle was reproduced using a typewriter and copied with primitive self-made machines. Therefore, the initial circulation was only about 100‚Äì300 copies. With the help of Russian dissidents (Sergei Kovalev, Gleb Yakunin, and others) and Western visitors (who agreed to take souvenirs with photographic films of the Chronicle hidden inside), copies of the Chronicle were smuggled across the Iron Curtain. In the United States, the Chronicle was translated and published by various Lithuanian American organizations. The text was also read on Vatican Radio, Voice of America, Radio Liberty.

Note the inlay on the head (\\"Lucy\\") and on the neck (\\"Albert King\\"). Lucy is the name given to the Gibson Flying V and a series of copies owned by blues guitarist Albert King. King apparently picked the Flying V (at a time when few other guitarists did) because of its style, and in return helped make it famous. First Lucy The \\"original\\" Lucy, named for Lucille Ball, was a right-handed 1958 Gibson Flying V made of korina, and it is the guitar King used on almost all of the important recordings he made for Stax Records. The guitar was stolen but later recovered. King bought it in his St. Louis days, in the late 1950s, when his career was beginning to take off. He kept the name secret for a while, for some reason, and then revealed it as Lucy; Stax played up the revelation by releasing the single \\"I Love Lucy\\", which became a hit in 1968. King played a second Flying V, a 1966 model, after his 1958 model was stolen. Reportedly this one was given to him by Gibson; this is the guitar he used to record \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\". The 1958 V was recovered and it was retired in 1974, to make way for the second Lucy. Second Lucy The second Lucy was made by luthier Dan Erlewine, who had seen King when the latter played at the Ann Arbor Blues Festival in Michigan in 1970, and in 1971 had met King at a show in Ann Arbor. He offered to build him a true left-handed V out of a 125-year old piece of black walnut. King agreed and came to Erlewine's shop the day after, where Erlewine measured his guitar and took notes. King asked for his name to be inlaid on the fretboard, and the name \\"Lucy\\" on the peghead. This Lucy was delivered to King in May 1972. The guitar was refretted (by Erlewine's cousin Mark, in Texas) in the late 1970s or early 1980s, and underwent repairs in Memphis after being underwater for 24 hours due to a tornado in the mid 1980s. Erlewine saw the guitar again in 1989 and did fret work and other minor repairs. Since then Erlewine has made a number of copies, all from the same slab of walnut; Erlewine said in 2009 that he had enough wood to make 20 or so Lucys. Third Lucy In 1980, a third Lucy was made by Bradley Prokopow. King played the Erlewine and Prokopow guitars until his death in 1992. Fourth Lucy Built by John Bolin upon commission from Billy Gibbons, this one is known as the pink Lucy. Currently resides at Stax Museum in Memphis Fifth Lucy Custom Archtop Flying V, built by Tom Holmes in 1987 upon commission from Billy Gibbons, it was given to AK for his 64th birthday. This guitar was recently sold by Gruhn's guitar to an unknown collector. Legacy Steven Seagal owns the 1958 and 1966 Flying Vs, and the Erlewine copy. A rumor reported by Seagal has it that the 1958 V was a bargaining chip in a craps game in the late 1960s; Seagal says he bought it in Memphis after the guitar had been hidden for twenty years. He bought the Erlewine copy in the early 2000s. Seagal's repairman had the guitar in his shop when his seven- year-old son happened to see it, along with the ghost of a \\"big black man\\" he later identified as King. The Gibson website echoes Seagal's judgment on King's importance to the guitar, and says Lucy played \\"a considerable role in immortalizing the model\\".

It is sometimes known as 'English Golden Russet', and has frequently been confused with 'English Russet'. The fruits of this cultivar are yellow gold with an occasional orange flush and lot of russeting. Its flesh is fine texture, juicy and crisp. Early in the season, Golden Russets exhibit an attractive, though extreme, tartness that makes them an excellent eating apple; if left to ripen long, their flavor grows quite sweet, but their flesh deteriorates and becomes mealy and soft. Despite its positive characteristics, the apple does not market well as an eating variety because of its russet. Harvested at late season, the Golden Russet keeps very well in storage. It keeps its shape in cooking, though its texture‚Äîregardless of when it was harvested‚Äîwill turn noticeably mealy when baked. The Golden Russet's tree can tolerate some cold.

Donovan is a Canadian drama film, co-written, co- produced, and directed by Xavier Dolan, in his English-language debut. It stars Kit Harington, Jacob Tremblay, Natalie Portman, Susan Sarandon, Kathy Bates, Thandie Newton, Ben Schnetzer, and Jared Keeso. The film deals with themes of celebrity, tabloid media in Hollywood, mother-son relationships, and homosexuality. It is presented as three different sequences of scenes interspersed during the film: a series set in 2017 showing a young actor who reminisces about the written correspondence he shared as a child with an American TV star who died since then, and two other series set in the mid-2000s depicting the lives of both characters at the time of the correspondence. The Death & Life of John F. Donovan had its world premiere at the 2018 Toronto International Film Festival, making it Dolan's first film to premiere at the festival. The film was critically panned, with many critics describing it as Dolan's \\"worst\\" directorial effort. Plot In 2017, Times journalist Audrey Newhouse interviews actor Rupert Turner about his recently published book Letters to a Young Actor. The book collects letters he received from John F. Donovan, an actor he corresponded with as a child and who died from a drug overdose. In a flashback to the mid-2000s, Turner is a child actor who is bullied by his homophobic schoolmates. He idolizes Donovan, who plays the lead character in the teen drama series Hellsome High. The tabloid press frequently speculates that Donovan is gay and closeted; when gossip regarding Donovan soliciting male prostitutes makes headlines, his correspondence with Turner is made public, sparking malicious speculation about the nature of Turner and Donovan's relationship. Donovan writes his final letter to Turner, and dies shortly after. In the present, Turner says he does not know whether or not Donovan's death was related to the scandal. Newhouse muses that she initially dismissed Turner's book as \\"mishaps from the First World,\\" but has reconsidered based on their meeting. Cast Production In December 2014, it was announced that Kit Harington and Jessica Chastain would star in the film, with Xavier Dolan directing the film from a screenplay he wrote with Jacob Tierney. Harington would portray the titular character while Chastain would portray a journalist. That same month, it was announced Susan Sarandon and Kathy Bates had joined the cast of the film. Sarandon would portray the role of Donovan's mother, while Bates would portray the role of his manager. In November 2015, it was announced that Adele was in talks to appear in a cameo role. That same month, Michael Gambon, Bella Thorne, Chris Zylka, Emily Hampshire, and Jared Keeso joined the cast of the film. In February 2016, Natalie Portman, Nicholas Hoult and Thandie Newton joined the cast. In July 2016, it was announced Ben Schnetzer joined the cast of the film, replacing Hoult. In February 2017, it was announced Jacob Tremblay had been cast in the film. In June 2017, Amara Karan joined the cast of the film. Gabriel Yared composed the film's score, which was recorded in July 2017. Filming Principal photography began on July 9, 2016, in Montreal. Principal photography on Unit 1 concluded on September 3, 2016. In February 2017, production resumed in Montreal, before being completed in the spring of 2017 in London and Prague. Post-production In February 2018, Dolan confirmed via Instagram that during post-production, Jessica Chastain's character had been cut from the film for timing and pacing reasons. In an interview in October 2018, Bella Thorne mentioned she had filmed some scenes, but they were with Chastain's character and thus were cut from the film. Release The film was invited to premiere at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival in May, but (according to artistic director Thierry Fremaux), Dolan still wasn't happy with the film, opting to continue editing. It had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2018. The film was released in France on March 13, 2019. It was released in Canada by Les Films S√©ville on August 23, 2019. It was released in the United States on December 13, 2019, by Momentum Pictures. Reception It currently holds an approval rating of 21% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 28 reviews, with an average rating of 3.55/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"The Death and Life of John F. Donovan finds writer-director Xavier Dolan flailing at profundity with a technically assured drama that never makes sense of its own ideas.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds an aggregated score of 28 out of 100 based on 12 critics, indicating \\"Generally unfavorable reviews\\". IndieWire dubbed the film the \\"worst\\" of Dolan‚Äôs career; they also called the screenplay \\"soapy\\" and \\"clumsy\\". The Guardian gave the film one out of five stars, deeming it a \\"dubious mess\\". NOW Magazine called the film \\"mediocre at best\\". RogerEbert.com criticized Dolan's music choices and wrote that the film has \\"major flaws\\", but praised Tremblay's performance. The Hollywood Reporter called the cast \\"impressive\\", but called the film a \\"half-baked, cumbersome, overlong psychodrama\\". In a more positive review, Screen International wrote that the film \\"may revisit a lot of familiar territory for Dolan but on this form it is good to welcome him home.\\" References External links * Category:2010s coming-of-age drama films Category:2018 films Category:Canadian coming-of-age drama films Category:Films about actors Category:Films about filmmaking Category:Films shot in Montreal Category:Films directed by Xavier Dolan Category:Gay-related films Category:Canadian LGBT-related films Category:LGBT-related drama films Category:2018 LGBT-related films Category:Films shot in Prague Category:Films set in 2006 Category:Films set in 2017 Category:Films set in London Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films set in Pennsylvania Category:Films set in Prague Category:Films scored by Gabriel Yared Category:Canadian nonlinear narrative films Category:Canadian films Category:2018 drama films ","title":"The Death &amp; Life of John F.

It was built in 1877 along the state border of Queensland and New South Wales It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 March 2003. Wallangarra railway station was on the only railway route between Sydney and Brisbane and had to handle the break-of-gauge where Queensland Railways' Southern line met the New South Wales Government Railways' Main Northern line. Wallangarra was the terminating point for the Sydney Mail, with passengers transferring to the Brisbane Limited for the remainder of the journey to Sydney. In 1930 New South Wales's North Coast line from Sydney to Brisbane was completed; as it used only standard gauge for the whole route, it was a more efficient route than travelling via Wallangarra, leading to the decline of Wallangarra station. However, Wallangarra continued to be served by passenger trains until the services from Brisbane and Sydney were truncated at Toowoomba and Tenterfield respectively on 1 February 1972.\\"20 Years Ago\\" Railway Digest February 1992 page 81  History  Wallangarra railway station opened on 14 February 1887, when the Queensland Railway's Southern line was extended from Stanthorpe to Wallangarra.Wallangarra Centre for the Government of Queensland On 16 January 1888, the New South Wales Government Railways' Main Northern line was extended from Tenterfield to Wallangarra, thereby opening an inter-colonial rail link between Brisbane and Sydney. Because of the break-of-gauge, the Wallangarra railway station was built astride the state border with a single island platform with one building, with the western side for by the narrow gauge line from Queensland and the eastern side by the standard gauge line from New South Wales. Each side of the building sported the awnings and signage of Queensland Railways and New South Wales Railways respectively. Even though the two lines shared a common station at Wallangarra (which sits astride the border), the New South Wales side of the station was initially named Jennings after the town on the New South Wales side of the border but ultimately became known as Wallangarra.Wallangarra Station NSWrail.net Temporary buildings were first erected with the permanent buildings being erected from 1887 to 1890. The first section of Queensland's Southern and Western Railways had opened between Ipswich and Bigges Camp (Grandchester) on 31 July 1865. The railway was constructed to link the pastoral areas of the Darling Downs, with the head of navigation on the Bremer River at Ipswich. The Southern and Western Railway was progressively extended to reach Toowoomba in April 1867, following completion of the Main Range section of the railway. Further westward extension of the Western line from Ipswich to Dalby was completed in 1868. The Southern line serving the southern part of the Darling Downs to Warwick was built in two sections was approved by the Queensland Parliament in 1865. However major financial difficulties for the colony saw that the line was not completed to Hendon until 1869 and through to Warwick until 1871. An indirect route from Ipswich was chosen branching off the western line near Gowrie railway station, and running south via Westbrook, to save on construction costs. The discovery of tin south of Warwick at Stannum Creek, and around present day Stanthorpe, in 1871 encourages a rush of miners to the area. The first agitation for an extension came from miners and people on the tin fields wanting closer communication with Brisbane and its port. A large amount of goods was also transported over the inter-colonial border and shipped from Northern New South Wales, whilst ore was also treated at a special smelter built in Brisbane. It was hoped that railway connections with Brisbane would secure this traffic for Queensland. A trial survey undertaken from Warwick to Stanthorpe in 1873 identified difficulties that would be experienced in construction of a railway line through the Granite Belt, the cost of which prevented any action being taken. Two more surveys were completed in 1876 and 1877, and importantly these surveys continued beyond Stanthorpe through to the Queensland/New South Wales border. Construction from Warwick to Stanthorpe was approved in August 1877. The section from Warwick to Stanthorpe was divided into two sections and work commenced in 1878 being completed in 1881. In March 1878, Queensland railway engineer Henry Charles Stanley consulted with his counterparts in the New South Wales Government over a suitable route for a future railway interconnection between the two states. At that time, there were plans to extend the NSW railway to Tenterfield, so they agreed a route that followed the old Ballandean road from Stanthorpe to Tenterfield with a border crossing point at (what would subsequently become) Wallangarra. In May 1878, Queensland surveyor George Phillips and New South Wales surveyor Mr Francis agreed the best place for the two railways to meet was at the border at the location that is now Wallangarra. In 1884, after confirming the border crossing location with the New South Wales Government, the Queensland Parliament approved plans for extension of the line southwards from Stanthorpe to the Queensland-New South Wales border via Ballandean. In August 1884, Queensland's chief railway engineer Stanley travelled to Sydney to meet with the New South Wales authorities having prepared designs for the railway station on the border that would meet the need of both colonies. Recognising that the Queensland railway extension towards the border was more advanced than the New South Wales extension, it was agreed that Queensland should construct the border railway station and that New South Wales would contribute to the cost. In April 1885, the Queensland Government awarded the contract for the extension of the railway to the border to the railway contractors George Bashford and Company for ¬£140,885/8/2, with an expected completion date of June 1887. In May 1885, the Queensland Government announced the sale of land in the new border township of Wallangarra, with 179 town lots to be auctioned at a starting price of ¬£8 per acre. On 29 June 1885, the sale of the land was an \\"extraordinary success\\" with all lots sold for prices ranging from ¬£26 to ¬£131 per lot (about ¬£500 per acre). In February 1886, Queensland provided New South Wales with the detailed plans costing ¬£28,000 for the railway station at Wallangarra, but in March 1886 New South Wales declared the cost too expensive. The New South Wales Premier, Patrick Jennings, then proposed that Tenterfield rather than Wallangarra should be the meeting point and break-of- gauge for the two railways. There was considerable support for the Tenterfield proposal in New South Wales, mostly arguing that Tenterfield was an established town whereas Wallangarra was, in the words of New South Wales Premier Henry Parkes, \\"nothing but a desolate wilderness\\". Even within Queensland, there was support for Tenterfield with the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce arguing that a Tenterfield break-of-gauge would open up new markets for Queensland in northern New South Wales (as the transhipping cost at Wallangarra would be avoided). In October 1886, the New South Wales railway extension to Tenterfield was opened; only the gap between Wallangarra and Tenterfield remained to be complete and that remained subject to the break-of- gauge dispute. However, even as the issue of the location of the break-of- gauge was still being hotly debated in the newspapers, the Queensland Government pushed on with constructing the railway according to the original agreements. The Queensland Commissioner for Railways gave instructions on 18 November 1886 for a smaller permanent station to be constructed wholly on the Queensland side of the border at Wallangarra at a cost of ¬£6,000 but with the platform and station yard layout designed to incorporate the eventual extension of the New South Wales standard gauge lines to the border. . On 14 February 1887 the Queensland railway line was opened to the border. On 26 February 1887 the contract for the building of a station master's residence, goods shed, and removal of the carriage and engine sheds from Stanthorpe to Wallangarra was awarded to George Bashford and Company for ¬£2509. In May 1887, Premier Parkes accepted that agreements entered into by his predecessor Jennings had \\"hopelessly committed\\" New South Wales to accept Wallangarra as the break-of-gauge location. The New South Wales government completed its railway line to the Wallangarra station in January 1888, although it did not erect awnings over its platform until 1890. On 17 January 1888, the first Brisbane-to-Sydney service left Brisbane. The transhipping station and yards of the Wallangarra railway station lead to the creation of two townships on the border, Wallangarra on the Queensland side and Jennings on the New South Wales side. Several years after the railway station was opened linking the two state railway lines, the border township of Wallangarra was described as being of \\"quite a pretentious appearance consisting of butchers, bakers, blacksmiths and with an aerated water factory\\". New South Wales platform (eastern side), 2015The station was built on an island platform, with station awnings on both sides. The Queensland side awnings (western platform) being to Queensland design patterns and that on the standard gauge side (eastern platform) being built after New South Wales pattern. Both colonies had name boards in their usual style. The original station building occupies the present southern section, and consisted of office, lobby, store and closets. The booking office also served as the customs office and general waiting room as well as the Station Master's office. In 1892, drawings were prepared by Henrik Hansen for a new bar, dining room, refreshment room, female staff (girls) bedrooms and kitchen. The Queensland/New South Wales border forms part of the fenceline for the Station Masters property. The station master's residence was unusual for a Queensland station residence as it was constructed in brick. A Post Office was opened in the station in March 1887. While Queensland always officially called the station Wallangarra (although usually wrote it as Wallan-garra after circa 1908), the naming of the railway station by the New South Wales authorities was inconsistent and caused confusion to travellers. On 16 January 1888, the New South Wales named it Jennings, but renamed it Wallangarra on 1 February 1889. On 1 October 1889, it became Jennings for the second time but reverted to Wallangarra on 1 January 1890. On 1 January 1891 it became Jennings for the third time, reverting finally to Wallangarra in April 1904. Sydney Mail at Spring Bluff, 1915 By 1884, the train travelling between Brisbane and Stanthorpe had been referred to as a \\"Mail\\" train running with a Travelling Post Office. The opening of the inter-colonial line in 1888 saw the introduction of a regular train service between Sydney and Brisbane, known as the \\"Sydney Mail\\" (26 Up) and (37 Down) were the premier service of the era. The timetable was improved in 1894 and remained unchanged until 1908, when a more powerful locomotive C16 class was introduced. In 1923, a new and heavier Sydney Mail train was constructed consisting of nine carriages including a parlour car based on observation platform at the rear of the train, to be hauled at what was the time the most powerful locomotives on a narrow gauge in Australia. In 1921, the Federal Royal Commission into Standard Gauge had recommended that the mainland States of Australia and the Australian Government commit themselves to providing a uniform railway network linking the capital cities of Australia with a common gauge. As part of the standardisation of the disparate gauges, a new link between Sydney and Brisbane via Kyogle, New South Wales was identified as being a central element. Queensland, in 1924, passed the South Brisbane Kyogle Grafton Act committing itself to the construction of a new standard gauge railway from South Brisbane railway station to the border with New South Wales. As part of this, New South Wales demanded a bridge over the Clarence River at Grafton and the upgrading of the Kyogle branch. The Australian Government provided half the funding for the project. The interstate standard gauge railway line between Kyogle and South Brisbane opened in 1930. The importance of the Toowoomba-Wallangarra southern line diminished, as the new link via northern New South Wales and the Richmond Gap into Queensland did not involve a change of trains at a border station. Station master's house, 2008 During the time of the Second World War the strategic importance of Wallangarra was vital in providing an inland transhipment and staging point during the defence of Australia. Large numbers of workers were employed to tranship goods in the New South Wales section of the yard. The extensive yard and station complex at this time consisted of the station building, closets and horse dock at the southern end of the station platform (the border dock). Refreshment Room staff and ambulance quarters were situated at the north end of the platform. On the western (Queensland) side was a goods office, casual crew quarters with dining room, frame tent and library. To the north-east an engine shed was situated, reserve coal dump, locomotive coal stage, tool room, ASM's residence (1919), ganger's residence (1919) and trucking yards. On the east side (New South Wales) was the Station Master's residence (1887), 25 ton weighbridge, lamp room, waitresses quarters and the footwarmer furnace. Quarters were also provided for laundresses. Most of these ancillary buildings are now removed. The last Sydney Mail (26 Up) ran on 29 January 1972, and the Brisbane- Wallangarra service was withdrawn as of 1 February 1972. The Wallangarra Refreshment Rooms closed to the public on 5 August 1973. With the cessation of passenger services on the Queensland side of the border, the line reverted to a goods-only basis. With the continuing decline of Wallangarra the decision was taken in 1984 to abolish one of the two positions of Assistant Station Master. In 1988, the New South Wales line from Tenterfield to Wallangarra closed. The last train to operate north of Tenterfield was an Australian Railway Historical Society charter on 15 January 1988 hauled by diesel locomotive 4487.\\"To the Border or Bust\\" Railway Digest March 1988 page 99 However, in the same year, Queensland Rail installed a gantry crane formerly used at Clapham Yard in Brisbane.\\"Wallangarra\\" Railway Digest July 1988 page 266 The line northwards of Guyra in New South Wales, and then Armidale was progressively mothballed by New South Wales's State Rail Authority. In March 1994 the Assistant Station Master's and Ganger Residences at Wallangarra were sold. The Station Master's residence was sold in 1994-1995, and the Station Officer withdrawn in 1995. The Southern line south of Warwick was threatened with closure in 1993-1994, but the link was retained due to community protest, and a twice weekly goods service was still operated. In recent times trains have only been run on an as required basis, and all station staff withdrawn leaving Wallangarra as an unattended station. Queensland Rail ceased freight services to Wallangarra in March 2007.\\"Level Crossing Safety: Warwick to Wallangarra\\" Railway Digest April 2013 pages 40-43 The Australian Railway Historical Society operated a twice yearly service to Wallangarra as The Winelander.

A small-stock slaughtering yard consisting of high-walled brick for the refreshment rooms adjoined the station building. The New South Wales side awning was built in 1890, and is sheeted with flat raked iron. Brackets and columns were cast by the Toowoomba Foundry. The elevations now overpainted, have pilasters at regular intervals with archways marking the location of the original lobby. Internally space was provided for offices and a large kitchen, dining room and bar. The offices are located to the south of the present ticket lobby with refreshment rooms and post office now vacated to the north where there is also an enclosed yard (slaughtering yard). The refreshment room fittings have been removed. The station platform features a two road horse dock platform at its southern end. The Queensland/New South Wales border diagonally crosses the platform approximately to the north of the horse dock platform. The Station Master's house faces the Sydney platform and is constructed of brick. It is an asymmetrical villa, being constructed in a L-shape with faceted bay in the projecting wing, posted verandah (reconstructed), stuccoed quoins and decorative brackets to the gable ends, and prominent chimneys. To the west of the station are two buildings identified by Ward in his survey as being the Locomotive Inspector's quarters and running men (crew) quarters.  Heritage listing  Wallangarra Railway Station and Complex was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 March 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Wallangarra railway station, associated trackwork in the railway yard and ancillary railway buildings situated at Wallangarra on the border of Queensland and New South Wales are important in demonstrating the pattern of transportation and communications in Queensland's history. In particular it demonstrates the pre-eminence of rail transport in the nineteenth and early twentieth century in Australia. The station building and yardwork was the response to the meeting between two separate colonial railway systems at a border using separate railway gauges. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. It is a rare complex of its type, being especially comparable nationally with Serviceton on the Victoria/South Australian border (1888) in terms of its construction date, large size and redundancy. It compares also with other late Victorian border stations at Albury and Wodonga. The station building and Station Masters residence are uncommon in Queensland as being constructed of masonry. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The station building and yardwork was the response to the meeting between two separate colonial railway systems at a border using separate railway gauges.  Engineering heritage award  The station received a Historic Engineering Marker from Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.

He was the starting quarterback of the Texas Longhorns in 1951‚Äì52 and the athletic director at Texas Tech University from 1985 to 1993. Early life James Carroll Jones, or \\"T\\" as he preferred to be called, was born in Childress, Texas in 1931 and grew up on a farm there. He was one of six children, and had an older brother who died from blood poisoning that resulted from a football injury. Each of his two other brothers eventually went to college on football scholarships. His name on his birth certificate was \\"Baby Boy Jones\\" but he got the name \\"T\\" from his older brother, Charles, who used to proudly point to his young sibling and say \\"Tee the baby!\\" As a senior in 1948, Jones was an All-State T formation quarterback who led Childress to a successful season as a dual- threat quarterback, passing for 1,370 yards and running for 500 more. He played in the 1949 all-state high school all-star game in Beaumont where he was forced to play tailback, and he was voted the best back in the game. He was also a top basketball player and pole vaulter. Many people think the nickname \\"T\\" comes from his play in the T formation, but it actually comes from his brother Charles, who played football against T at Baylor. When T was born, his parents did not have a name for him and so his birth certificate reads \\"Baby Boy Jones\\". Charles would point to T and say \\"see the baby,\\" but he couldn't pronounce \\"see\\" so it sounded like \\"Tee the baby.\\" Jones was known as \\"Tee Tee\\" for a long time, but shortened that to just T when he got older. College Football Jones played both ways for the Texas Longhorns, as both a defensive back and a quarterback, while also returning punts. He quarterbacked the freshman team and then started a few games at defensive back his sophomore year while also taking some snaps at quarterback. In 1951, the first season with coach Ed Price, Jones was set to compete with Dan Page and Tompkins for the starting role. But when Tompkins left in the winter to play professional baseball, Jones got the start in the opener against Bear Bryant's #6-ranked Kentucky, and he threw the game winning pass to help Texas upset the Wildcats. Texas switched from the straight-T offense to the Split-T and Jones led the team to victories against Purdue, North Carolina and #11 Oklahoma. The last was their first victory over the Sooners in four years, and their first win in the Cotton Bowl in the last seven attempts. Texas climbed to #4 in the rankings before being upset by Arkansas, a team they had not lost to since 1938. In the game Jones and Page combined for 1-12 passing, with Page making the only completion, and lost by 2 on a Pat Summerall field goal. Jones started the following game against Rice, but Page led the Longhorns to the win and took over as starter for the rest of the season. Jones threw only four more passes in 1951. With Page under center, Texas lost to #16 Baylor for the first time since 1938 and upset #12 TCU. They needed to beat Texas A&M; for a share of the conference title and a trip to the Orange Bowl, but in a game that Jones sat out, Texas was upset 22‚Äì21 and beaten by A&M; for the first time since 1939. In 1952, Jones, halfbacks Gib Dawson and Billy Quinn and fullback Dick Ochoa created Texas' all-time greatest backfield combination. All four made the All-Southwest Conference team, the only time one school's backfield ever did that in conference history. Against Texas A&M;, Jones, Dawson and Quinn all rushed for more than 100 yards, the first time 3 players ever did that in a single game for a Longhorn team, and a feat that has only been repeated once since. The team set the school record for rushing, and the school and conference records for total offense. Jones won the Houston Post's Southwest Conference MVP Trophy. The Longhorns won the Southwest Conference and beat Tennessee in the 1953 Cotton Bowl. He finished his career with a 14‚Äì3 record, the best winning percentage of any quarterback to start for more than one season in school history at the time and third best in the Southwest Conference history at the time. Jones was elected to the Longhorn Hall of Honor in 1978. Records * UT - Best winning percentage (minimum 1 season), career - 82.4%, surpassed by James Street in 1969 Coaching After graduating in June 1953, Jones was hired by Dana X. Bible as a graduate assistant coach for the Texas Longhorn football team in 1953. He then served two and a half years in the Army Transportation Corps as part of his obligation as a Korean War era ROTC student. When that was completed in 1956, he considered trying out for the San Francisco 49ers but instead he was hired as an assistant coach for the Longhorns under Ed Price. When Darrell Royal replaced Price, Jones was retained and stayed on Royal's staff as a backfield coach for the freshman team, then a quarterback coach and later defensive backfield coach. During that time Texas won 3 Southwest Conference Championships and 1 Cotton Bowl. In the summer before the 1963 National Championship season, Jones decided he needed to spend more time with his family due to his wife's illness and he resigned from the team. Athletic Director Jones spent six years selling class rings and then another twelve at City National Bank in Austin, Texas where he was eventually a senior vice- president. In 1980, he was hired as an Assistant Athletic Director by then Texas Athletic Director Bill Ellington, who had been on Royal's coaching staff with Jones. When Ellington retired in 1981, many suspected that Jones was the heir-apparent, but instead the job went to then Kansas State AD Deloss Dodds. Jones was retained by Dodds and stayed at Texas, being promoted to Associate Athletic Director in 1982. On August 10, 1985 Jones was hired as athletic director at Texas Tech to replace John Conley. He immediately merged the men's and women's athletic departments and dealt with an investigation into football recruiting violations. He made several key hiring decisions including successful coaches Spike Dykes, James Dickey and Larry Hays; oversaw construction of new athletic offices and a baseball stadium and was AD of the program during the Lady Raiders run to the 1993 NCAA women's basketball championship‚Äîthe school's first and only one in any NCAA sport. The Dickey hiring was the source of some tension with Dr. Robert Lawless, then the school president, who preferred a national search rather than promoting a current assistant. Shortly after the school's first national championship, Jones resigned abruptly on June 8, 1996, with 14 months remaining on his contract, because he felt like he had lost \\"the confidence of the President and the Board of Regents.\\" In recognition of his contributions, he was inducted into the Texas Tech Hall of Honor in 2004. Jones was married twice, with two kids from the first marriage. After leaving Texas Tech, he retired to Horseshoe Bay, Texas, just west of Austin.

History Medieval The field of Kosovo was in the province of Dardania The region was an economic hub of the early Eastern Roman Empire in the province of Dardania. Praevalitana (the region before the valley), a province that bordered Dardania was named after the fact that it was located directly to the west of the field. A reference to the field may appear in the early Christian cult of Florus and Laurus of the 4th century AD, which was recorded no earlier than the 6th century AD.

The Kosovo field was the site of the Battle of Kosovo in June 1389, the battlefield northwest of Pristina where the Serbian army fought the Ottoman army. It is for this field, and the battle, that the Kosovo region and contemporary Kosovo, and in turn the historical Kosovo Vilayet and Yugoslav Kosovo and Metohija is named. The modern city of Kosovo Polje is also named after the field. Serbian ruler Stefan Lazareviƒá (1389‚Äì1427) erected a marble column with inscriptions on the field, in memory of his father. Another Battle of Kosovo (1448) was fought between the Ottoman Empire and Kingdom of Hungary. Modern history In 1877, the Kosovo Vilayet was established by the Ottoman Empire.

It was composed in 1962 and premiered the same year at the Edinburgh Festival. A performance takes about 15 minutes. History The Horn Trio was commissioned by the Edinburgh Festival, and was written especially for hornist Barry Tuckwell, violinist Brenton Langbein, and pianist Maureen Jones, in part because they were all Australians, like the composer . Tuckwell's virtuosity was particularly important in stimulating the conception of this trio, as well as the Horn Concerto that Banks composed for Tuckwell three years later . Analysis The trio is in three movements: #Lento‚ÄìAllegro moderato #Adagio espressivo #Moderato, scherzando There is some disagreement concerning the compositional techniques employed. While Banks most often employed twelve-tone serial techniques in his concert music, one writer contends that the trio is an exception , while another describes it as atonal as well as serial . Whatever the technical basis, the work is economically built from a small group of basic ideas, with an emphasis on the descending semitone and a perfect fourth (; ). After a slow introduction, the first movement falls into five main sections: a lyrical first section, a passage of fluctuating tempos featuring muted horn and sul ponticello violin, a slow section based on the unifying falling semitone, a horn cadenza, and a reprise of the first main section . The second movement is slow and lyrical, in four sections defined in part by different pairings of the instruments. It opens with a long, flowing idea in the horn, accompanied by the piano. This is followed by a duet for violin and piano, then a con fantasia cadenza for horn and violin. In the final section, all three instruments sound together at last (; ). The finale is light in mood, in 6/8 time and marked scherzando, but in form is a rondo with a coda. The episodes develop the slow material from the third section of the first movement . The piano in this movement is marked by many bars of repeated quavers, and functions similarly to the rhythm section of a jazz ensemble .

With a degree in anthropology from the University of New Zealand, she spent most of her working life in the United States, where she worked closely with her husband, a fellow New Zealander and renowned anthropologist Felix Maxwell Keesing. She published a number of works, and co-authored several significant books with her husband, including Taming Philippine Headhunters: a Study of Government and of Cultural Change in Northern Luzon (1934) and Elite Communication in Samoa: A Study of Leadership (1956).  Early life  Born on December 1, 1904, in Auckland, New Zealand, to parents Frederick Samuel Martin and Alice Maude Peart. Her parents described themselves as missionaries, but their lives and commitments were more complicated and nuanced than that label usually allows. Their work with the local indigenous communities included providing medical attention, as well as running a local store. As a result, Marie grew up with Maori friends and neighbors. She writes about her childhood in the posthumous book Hidden Valleys and Unknown Shores (Harcourt 1978). She attended the University of New Zealand and graduated with a BA in history in May 1926. She became engaged to Felix ‚ÄúFee‚Äù Keesing that same month and they married in July 1928. During their engagement, setting a pattern she would follow throughout their lives, she collaborated with him as he rewrote his Master‚Äôs thesis for the 1928 publication The Changing Maori (Thomas Avery & Son). Whilst not acknowledged as a co-author, she was always described as an ever present co-interlocutor, collaborator and companion. Marie and Felix had two children: economist Donald Beaumont Keesing (b. 1933, London, died 25 Apr 2004 in Washington DC) and anthropologist Roger Martin Keesing (b 1935 Honolulu, died 1993, Canada). The family lived in Chicago, New Haven, London, Honolulu, Washington, D.C., before settling at Stanford University in the 1940s with Marie and Felix taking American citizenship in 1940s. Roger was an undergraduate at Stanford University and maintained a strong relationships with the institution throughout his lifetime. Donald was an associate professor at Stanford, and an undergraduate at Harvard; both he and Roger got their PhD's from Harvard. Felix Keesing died of a heart attack whilst playing a game of tennis in April 1961 at Stanford. Marie Keesing died on July 13, 1961, after her husband‚Äôs untimely death three months earlier. As George Spindler, long time Stanford colleague of the Keesings put it ‚ÄúShe gave up her life, in the agony of grief over his death, on July 13.‚Äù There is some speculation that she blamed herself for her husband's death and this, along with a bout of severe depression, drove her to suicide.  Career  Like many other anthropological marriages of the first half of the 20th century, there is a kind of unevenness to Marie Keesing‚Äôs record. She follows Felix Keesing‚Äôs opportunities and carves out spaces to do her own work where she can and also works with him in research projects. As the wife of a working anthropological partnership, she is sometimes a recognized co-author with Felix, and sometimes a clear collaborator recognized only in fulsome terms in a publication‚Äôs preface. However, her impact on Felix‚Äôs work was acknowledged by his peers. As fellow anthropologist George Spindler wrote in Felix Keesing‚Äôs obituary: ‚ÄúIn all of his work he was aided by Marie Keesing, who was his collaborator on some of his books and his companion on most of his trips to remote peoples in the hinterlands of the Pacific.‚Äù However, in the American Anthropologist obituary for Felix Keesing the following year, her co-authorship of several volumes appears erased. Marie left New Zealand with Felix in 1928. Under the auspices of a multi-year Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship, Felix Keesing relocated to the United States, working at Yale and the University of Chicago. He and Marie spent time with the leading lights in American anthropology, fostering a particular interest in ethnohistory and culture-change. In 1930, he and Marie moved to Honolulu to take up research positions at the Institute of Pacific Relations (IPR). The IPR, established in 1925, was an international NGO that provided a forum for discussion of problems and relations between nations of the Pacific Rim. Marie and Felix conducted fieldwork in Samoa and the Philippines in the early 1930s. Their interests in cultural change, transformation and structures of power, as well as ethno-historical approaches, culminated in the publication of Taming Philippine Headhunters: a Study of Government and of Cultural Change in Northern Luzon (1934). After a brief stint at the London School of Economics, Felix took up the challenge of starting the first department as chairman of the Department of Anthropology and Sociology at the University of Hawaii. During his nearly decade-long tenure, Marie continued to work at the Institute for Public Relations, writing about issues in the Pacific region. She also became very active in women‚Äôs organizations in this period. She was involved in the Pan Pacific Women‚Äôs Association (PPWA) from its first meetings in 1928 and 1930; the association had a clear charter to raise and discuss questions affecting women and children across the Pacific, including social conditions. She was a regular participant in the PPWA meetings; she organized many panels and workshops including an important roundtable on the role of women in social systems in 1939. During World War II, Felix Keesing was called to Washington, D.C., where he worked in the Office of Strategic Services. After a year in D.C., Felix relocated his family to Stanford University, where whilst establishing the Stanford Anthropology Department, he would continue to work with the United States government in a range of capacities through the 1950s. This included training Navy personnel about Pacific cultures and conducted surveys of former Japanese-occupied Pacific territories. It is unknown how much Marie participated in this work. She clearly was an active participant in his work in Western Samoa. Their work there culminating in the publication of Elite Communication in Samoa: A Study of Leadership (1956). At the time of their deaths, Felix and Marie were working on a new ethno-historical project revisiting their earliest work on the Philippines. The book, published posthumously is attributed only to Felix but Roger Keesing, their son, writes in the preface, that his mother ‚Äúplayed a tireless role as editor, critic, contributor and companion, as she did in all of his [Felix‚Äôs] work‚Äù.

Established in 1950, the school offers programs leading to the Bachelor's in Social Work, Master of Science in Social Work, and PhD in Social Work degrees and is rated one of the top 10 social work programs in the United States. Luis H. Zayas, Ph.D. is the dean of the school. In 2017, after a donation of $25 million by telecommunications pioneer R. Steven \\"Steve\\" Hicks, the school was renamed to the Steve Hicks School of Social Work. The school is headquartered in UT's School of Social Work Building (formerly the University Junior High School).  Research  Research projects at the UT School of Social Work are administered through The Center for Social Work Research (CSWR). The Center was founded in 1974 to provide an environment that facilitates interdisciplinary, scientifically rigorous research endeavors. Currently, the center houses 9 research institutes.  Addiction Research Institute  This institute focuses on substance abuse among underserved populations, particularly African-Americans and Mexican-Americans. The program adopts a uniquely social work perspective, emphasizing factors at the individual, family, organizational, societal, and cultural level that influence substance abuse and substance abuse treatment.  Health Behavior and Research Training Institute  This institute specializes in the development and implementation of interventions to address health behaviors and in the training and supervision of providers in the field who address behavior change on the front lines. Our theoretical framework is based on the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) and Motivational Interviewing (MI). Through funding primarily from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), HBRT's intervention research focuses on fetal alcohol spectrum disorder; alcohol, cocaine, smoking, and other substance disorders; STI testing; HIV and safer sexual practices; and screening and brief motivational interventions in medical settings.  Donation and renaming  In 2017, the School of Social Work received a large donation from telecommunications pioneer and vice chairman of the Board of Regents at the University of Texas System, R. Steven \\"Steve\\" Hicks. The announcement of this donation was made September 6, 2017, and in commemoration of the event, the university tower was lit burnt orange. The $25 million donation is to be split three ways, with $10 million going towards establishing a permanent endowment to support future scholarships, $5 million being used to match donations in an effort to encourage additional gifts, and $10 million being used to fund and enhance various aspects of the education system. Hicks, who is a business man himself with no personal background in social work, stated he made the donation in an effort \\"to reduce student debt burden so that social work graduates can stay in their careers doing what they love and positively affecting the lives of thousands of people.\\" References External links * Category:University of Texas at Austin schools, colleges, and departments Category:Schools of social work in the United States ","title":"University of Texas at Austin School of Social Work"},{"id":"44862919","text":"Rolling Stones is a 1916 American drama silent film directed by Dell Henderson and written by Edgar Selwyn.

Following Squint, Taylor retired from recording music as a solo artist, pursuing a career as a filmmaker, songwriter, and record producer. In 2010, Taylor started recording music again. In 2011, Peter Furler, former member of Newsboys, a band for which Taylor has produced and written, revealed in an interview that he, Taylor, Jimmy Abegg and John Mark Painter had started recording for a new project by Taylor. At that time, the band was still unnamed, and referred to itself as \\"Steve Taylor and Some Other Band\\".

Its root is ‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§É which means - a 'cover' or 'veil'. This word also refers to emanation and to the manifest power of Lord Vishnu. It has different meanings depending on the doctrine of the treatise and the context, such as revealing of the knowledge of Vedas, manifestation of Vishnu or Buddha, and the war formations of Mahabharata. Vy≈´ha in Hinduism Vy≈´ha in the Upanishads: unraveling of the knowledge In the Upanishads the word vyuha occurs once, it appears in ≈õloka 16 of the Isha Upanishad :- :‡§™‡•Ç‡§∑‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡•á‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§∑‡•á ‡§Ø‡§Æ ‡§∏‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡§æ‡§™‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§π ‡§∞‡§∂‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§∏‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§π :‡§§‡•á‡§ú‡•ã ‡§Ø‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡•á ‡§∞‡•Ç‡§™‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§≤‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§£‡§§‡§Æ‡§Ç ‡§§‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡•á ‡§™‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ‡§ø ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§Ω‡§∏‡§æ‡§µ‡§∏‡•å ‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å‡§∑‡§É ‡§∏‡•ã‡§Ω‡§π‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ø |:\\"O Sun, sole traveler of the Heavens, controller of all, Surya, son of Prajapati; remove thy rays and gather up the burning light. I behold thy glorious form; I am he, the Purusha within thee.\\" In this passage vy≈´ha means ‚Äì 'remove' (to a distance thy rays). The sage declares that the Truth is concealed in the Vedas, covered by a golden lid or vessel Badarayana, by declaring ‚Äì utpattyasambhavƒÅt (‡§â‡§§‡•ç‡§™‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∏‡§Æ‡•ç‡§≠‡§µ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç) (Owing to the impossibility of origin) - Brahma Sutras (II.ii.42) refutes the Bhagavata view that the Chatur-vy≈´ha forms originate successively from Vasudeva, for any origin for the soul is impossible, an implement cannot originate from its agent who wields it. Whereas in a vy≈´ha an army re-sets its different able warriors and weaponry into a specific arrangement as per battle demands, the Supreme Being re-sets the contents of consciousness through yogamaya with each formation concealing yet another formation. The five layers of matter (prakrti) that constitute the human body are the five sheaths (panchakosa), one moves inwards from the visible layers through more refined invisible layers in search of own true self. Vy≈´ha in the PƒÅ√±carƒÅtra ƒÄgama: the Vai≈õnava doctrine of manifestation The PƒÅ√±carƒÅtra ƒÄgama, which are based on EkƒÅyana recension of the ≈öukla Yajurveda, is later than the Vedas but earlier than the Mahabharata. The main ƒÅgamas are the Vai≈õnava (worship of Vishnu), the ≈öaiva (worship of Shiva) and the ≈öƒÅkta (worship of Devi or Shakti) ƒÅgamas; all ƒÅgamas are elaborate systems of Vedic knowledge. According to Vedanta Desika, the PƒÅ√±carƒÅtra ƒÅgama teaches the five-fold daily religious duty consisting of ‚Äì abhigamana, upƒÅdƒÅna, ijyƒÅ, svƒÅdhyƒÅya and yoga, the name of this ƒÅgama is derived on account of its description of the five-fold manifestation of the Supreme Being viz, para (supreme or the transcendental form), vy≈´ha (formation or manifestation as the four vy≈´ha), vibhava (reincarnation or descent to earth as avtƒÅra), arcƒÅ (visible image of God) and antaryƒÅmi (cosmic form of God). Lakshmi accompanies Vishnu in His Chatur-vy≈´ha (four-fold manifestation) as VƒÅsudeva (creator), Sa·πÖkar·π£a·πáa (sustainer), Pradyumna (destroyer), and Aniruddha (spiritual knowledge promulgator). This is the Vai≈õnava doctrine of Vy≈´ha or the doctrine of formation. The Chatur- vy≈´ha forms of Vishnu are related to four of the six causes of creation which six are God Himself as the final cause of creation and His five aspects ‚Äì NarƒÅyana (thinking), VƒÅsudeva (feeling), Samkar≈õana (willing), Pradyumna (knowing), and Aniruddha (acting) successively. Each divinity controls its specific creative energy. The six gunas ‚Äì jnana (omniscience), aishvarya (lordship), shakti (potency), bala (force), virya (virtue) and tejas (self- sufficiency), acting in pairs and in totality, are the instruments and the subtle material of pure creation. Vy≈´has are the first beings created, and they represent the effective parts of a coherent whole. Here, vy≈´ha means ‚Äì projection; the projection of the svar≈´pa ('own form') as bahur≈´pa ('manifest variously'). Vy≈´ha in the Mahabharata: battle formations The Mahabharata and the Manu Samhita list by name and formation many vy≈´has ('battle formations'), some were small in size and others, gigantic, such as: # Ardha- chandra-vy≈´ha ('crescent moon formation'), # Chakra-vy≈´ha('circular formation') a large formation was devised by the Kauravas in which Abhimanyu, son of Arjuna, was trapped never to emerge alive. # Garbha-vy≈´ha ('womb-shaped formation'), # Makara-vyuha ('crocodile formation'), adopted by Bhishma in the Kurukshetra War # Mandala vyuha ('galaxy formation'), # Oormi vyuha ('ocean formation'), # Shakata-vy≈´ha ('cart-shaped formation'), # Sarvatobhadra-vy≈´ha ('grand formation'), # Suchi-vy≈´ha ('needle-shaped formation'), # Shyena-vyuha (also called Garuda Vyuh) ('eagle formation'). At the commencement of the Kurukshetra War which lasted for eighteen days, the Pandavas, being aware that Bhishma stood protected by the \\"makara vyuha\\" and was ready for battle, they had adopted the invincible \\"sheyna vyuha\\" with Bhima leading stationed at the mouth and Arjuna stationed at the neck of the bird-shaped vyuha, and Yudhishthira patrolling the rear. # Vajra-vy≈´ha was large a three-fold formation of warriors. Vy≈´ha in Buddhism In MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism, the word vy≈´ha means \\"arrangement\\", the like of marvelous, supernatural, magical arrangements, or supernatural manifestations. It is also extant in the Pali language, where it means \\"an array\\" or \\"grouping of troops.\\" The term is also found among the titles of some Buddhist texts. In Pure Land Buddhism, the character of AmitƒÅbha Buddha is elaborated upon in both the Longer SukhƒÅvatƒ´vy≈´ha S≈´tra and the Shorter SukhƒÅvatƒ´vy≈´ha S≈´tra. The term \\"SukhƒÅvatƒ´vy≈´ha\\" may translated as \\"description of SukhƒÅvatƒ´\\". The KƒÅra·πá·∏çavy≈´ha S≈´tra has been translated as \\"The Basket‚Äôs Display\\".

The Harpoons received their baptism with fire when hostilities broke out in 1971. Extensive ASW operations were undertaken and the Harpoons clocked over 156 hours of war effort. Over the decade the Harpoons continued to operate from INS Vikrant as the only front line carrier borne rotary wing squadron and earned the honour and reputation of being the most versatile and baleful of the whirly birds. The squadron got greater punch with the procurement of Sea King 42B which have an improved sensor fit and capability for Anti-Shipping strikes. The squadron shifted to INS Shikra, Mumbai from INS Garuda, Kochi in October 1995 and has been based there ever since. As always the Harpoons continue to remain the eyes and ears of the fleet.

Christian Newman Christian Newman is a fictional character from the original CBS Daytime soap opera, The Young and the Restless. He is the son of Sage Warner (Kelly Sullivan) and Adam Newman (Justin Hartley), prematurely delivered by Adam in Chancellor Park on October 7, 2015. Christian was presumed dead on November 8, 2015, as a result of complications from his premature birth. It was previously believed that Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow) is his father, however, it was revealed that Adam is Christian's biological father, and Adam doctored the results to avoid suspicion when he was masquerading as the late Gabriel Bingham. Only days later, it was revealed that Christian's death was faked by Dr. Anderson (Elizabeth Bogush), a doctor at Fairview. Dr. Anderson's motives for stealing the baby and faking his death are still unknown at this time, but on November 23, 2015, she handed Christian to Sharon Newman (Sharon Case) and congratulated her on the birth of her new son. Sharon was a patient at Fairview who was severely medicated by Dr. Anderson and kept in a drug-induced state. The doctor convinced Sharon that she was pregnant (she has miscarried) and kept her isolated at the hospital. Sharon and her husband, Dylan McAvoy (Steve Burton) decided to name \\"their\\" baby Sullivan \\"Sully\\" McAvoy, in honor of Dylan's friend who was killed in Afghanistan. Sage confronted Nurse Stephens on April 27, 2016, and she admitted to stealing Christian and helping Dr. Anderson pass off Christian as Sharon's son. Sharon had a DNA test run which proved \\"Sully\\" was really Christian but decided to hide the truth. Sage confronted Sharon, who admitted the truth, but Sage died in a car wreck on her way to tell Nick that Christian was alive.

G. Wells, first published in 1896 in Pearson's Magazine., accessed 22 Dec 2014. It was included in The Plattner Story and Others, a collection of short stories by Wells first published in 1897. The story describes a journey to the ocean bed in a specially-designed metal sphere; the explorer within discovers a civilization of human-like creatures. Historical background The Challenger expedition, arranged by the Royal Society, was the first systematic deep-sea exploration. From 1872 to 1876, HMS Challenger surveyed and explored around the world; the physical and chemical qualities of the deep sea were investigated, and biological samples were collected by dredges. The bathysphere, a spherical deep-sea submersible which Elstead's apparatus seems to resemble, first appeared in the 1930s. Story summary Elstead has invented an apparatus by which a person can travel to great depths and observe the life on the sea bed. It is a steel sphere, about nine feet in diameter, intended to withstand immense pressure. Weights attached to the sphere by a cable take it to the sea bed. The explorer makes observations through the window in the sphere, oxygen inside being replaced by a fictitious \\"Myers apparatus\\". A clockwork mechanism cuts the cable after a certain time, and the buoyancy of the sphere takes it back to the surface. The sphere is to be lowered into the water from the Ptarmigan, which has sailed to a region where the water is five miles deep. The organization behind the project (perhaps funded by a scientific body, or by Elstead) is not specified. The details of the sphere, and of Elstead's plan to use it to view the ocean floor, are made clear in the conversations of Elstead and the officers of the Ptarmigan; because of the immense pressure at the depth to be explored, the officers have their doubts about the apparatus working to plan, and about Elstead's likelihood of survival. The sphere does not return on schedule. While the ship's officers wait, \\"the December sun was now high in the sky, and the heat very considerable.\\" By midnight, they are fearing the worst; then they spot the re-emergence of the sphere. It is eventually retrieved at dawn. After a week, Elstead has recovered enough to tell his experiences. He relates the eventful descent, lasting several minutes, during which the sphere became unexpectedly hot. On the sea bed, after observing the unusual species of fish and invertebrates, he sees \\"a strange vertebrated animal.... The vertical pitch of its face gave it a most extraordinary resemblance to a human being.... It was a biped; its almost globular body was poised on a tripod of two frog-like legs and a long thick tail.\\" This creature, together with others, tow the sphere to a kind of altar in their city; the inhabitants prostrate themselves before Elstead, and chant. He observes this for several hours: eventually the cable breaks and the sphere returns to the surface. The narrator has talked to eminent scientists, who think such a civilization is quite possible; he further speculates: \\"We should be known to them, however, as strange, meteoric creatures, wont to fall catastrophically dead out of the mysterious blackness of their watery sky. And not only we ourselves, but our ships, our metals, our appliances, would come raining down out of the night.... One can understand, perhaps, something of their behaviour at the descent of a living man....\\" Elstead never writes an account of his experience; after making improvements to the sphere, he makes another descent, but (like The Time Traveller in Wells's The Time Machine) he does not return from his second adventure.

Description The Burmese krait is a medium-sized krait, typically approximately in total length, although some specimens may grow up to . Like most kraits, they are slender snakes with short tapering tails measuring around . The head is flat and slightly distinct from the neck. The eyes of this species are generally small to medium in size with black round pupils. Dorsal scales are smooth and glossy with the vertebral row enlarged and hexagonal. The body of this species is triangular shaped in cross-sections. The dorsum has anywhere from 11 to 14 broad, white crossbars, which are as wide as the black interspaces, while the centers of each of the scales is spotted with black. The belly of the Burmese krait is uniformly white in colour. Distribution and habitat Currently, this species is understood to be endemic to Myanmar. It can be found in Mandalay, Sagaing, and Magway divisions of Myanmar. It might also occur in adjacent areas of Yunnan Province in China, Thailand, Laos, Bangladesh and/or northeastern parts of India, but it has not yet been observed in any of them. The type locality of this species is Meiktila, in Upper Myanmar in the Mandalay Division which lies in seasonal dry forest; thus, this species is likely to occur throughout the central dry zone. It occurs in dry tropical lowland forest. Specimens have been located in disturbed habitats close to plantations and villages. This species can be found from near sea level to elevations reaching . Behaviour This is a terrestrial species of snake that is active at night, being a nocturnal in nature. The disposition of this species is placid and shy, often coiling loosely and hiding its head beneath its body when molested or threatened. It is very disinclined to bite unless persistently provoked. Prey Burmese kraits prey predominantly on other species of snakes, but they still occasionally do take small mammals such as rats and mice, lizards, frogs, and even fish. Venom Very little is known about the venom of this species. Like other species of krait, the venom is potent and contains both pre- synaptic and post-synaptic neurotoxins. There is no known antivenom for bites by this species. Bites of humans by this species are exceptionally rare, therefore no well-documented cases of human fatalities have been attributed to this species.

Dissimilatory sulfate reduction is a form of anaerobic respiration that uses sulfate as the terminal electron acceptor. This metabolism is found in some types of bacteria and archaea which are often termed sulfate-reducing organisms. Dissimilatory sulfate reduction occurs in four steps: # Conversion (activation) of sulfate to Adenosine 5‚Äô-phosphosulfate (APS) via Sulfate adenylyltransferase # reduction of APS to sulfite via Adenylyl-sulfate reductase # transfer of the sulfur atom of sulfite to the DsrC protein creating a trisulfide intermediate catalyzed by DsrAB. # reduction of the trisulfide to sulfide and reduced DsrC via a membrane bound enzyme, DsrMKJOP. Which requires the consumption of a single ATP molecule and the input of 8 electrons (e‚àí). The protein complexes responsible for these chemical conversions ‚Äî Sat, Apr and Dsr ‚Äî are found in all currently known organisms that perform dissimilatory sulfate reduction. Energetically, sulfate is a poor electron acceptor for microorganisms as the sulfate-sulfite redox couple is E0' -516 mV, which is too negative to allow reduction by NADH or ferrodoxin that are the primary intracellular electron mediators. To overcome this issue, sulfate is first converted into APS by the enzyme ATP sulfurylase (Sat), at the cost of a single ATP molecule. The APS- sulfite redox couple has a E0' of -60 mV, which allows APS to be reduced by either NADH or reduced ferrodoxin using the enzyme adenylyl-sulfate reductase (Apr), which requires the input of 2 electrons. In the final step, sulfite is reduced by the dissimilatory sulfite reductase (Dsr) to form sulfide, requiring the input of 6 electrons. Note. The term \\"dissimilatory\\" is used when hydrogen sulfide is produced in an anaerobic respiration process. By contrast, the term \\"assimilatory\\" would be used in relation to the biosynthesis of organo-sulfur compounds.

His family was of Jewish-Italian origin and was well known in the Dutch music scene for about a century.Scherft, 'Speurtocht', p. 132. The Hague period Thanks to the scholarship from the 'Maatschappij tot Bevordering der Toonkunst', which the young Toonkunst-Department of Middelburg promoted him for, he could visit the Koninklijke Muziekschool (the present-day Royal Conservatory) in The Hague. This fact is commemorated in the earliest surviving composition of Samehtini, a vocal piece with instrumental accompaniment entitled 'Dankbare proeve' from 1833.Original manuscript in Zeeuws Archief, Middelburg, Netherlands, archive Koninklijke Zangvereniging Tot Oefening en Uitspanning, Middelburg (class 1522), inv.nr. 25, a 2002 performance on SoundCloud. The piece was written when he was just 16 or 17 years old. Samuel Maju finished his education most successfully, being part of the Court Chapel of The Hague. Return to Middelburg After finishing his education, he offered his services to the people of his home town by placing an advertisement in the Middelburgsche Courant in August 1834.Zeeuwse Bibliotheek, Middelburg, Netherlands, newspaper Middelburgsche Courant, 16 August 1834, page 2. At his house in the Hoogstraat in Middelburg, music lovers could enjoy violin-, piano-, guitar- or singing classes. Leeuwarden period In 1839, he moved to Leeuwarden in the province of Friesland as a music teacher. In the Frisian capital he soon became famous both as a violinist and as a conductor and composer. He was allowed to write a festive march for the visit of King William III to Leeuwarden on 29 April 1852. His work was performed by the Leeuwarden 'Muziekvereniging Crescendo Euphonia' as part of a torch lit serenade on the Gouverneursplein and was received enthusiastically by the public.Koninklijke Bibliotheek, The Hague, Netherlands, newspaper Leeuwarder Courant, 30 April 1852, page 1. Samehtini's 'Leeuwarder Polka' is most likely part of his productive Leeuwarden years. Marriage On 16 August 1848, Samehtini got married in Leeuwarden to stockbrokers daughter Carolina Neumark, who gave him six children. One of them was the famous horn player, conductor, and energetic composer Maurits Samehtini (1863-1943). Amsterdam period Samehtini moved from Leeuwarden to Amsterdam, where he continued his (main) job of music teacher. He left his home near the 'Vrouwenpoort', one of Leeuwardens city gates, in the autumn of 1854, to live in Amsterdam. Here, in the summer of 1873, he celebrated his silver wedding anniversary. In honour of the deceased Dutch writer and linguist Jacob van Lennep (1802-1868), he wrote a funeral march for the piano. Death Six years after the silver wedding anniversary Samehtini died on 10 December 1879 in his home near the Rokin in Amsterdam. According to a mourning ad he died after a short illness. Two days later the funeral took place on the Jewish Cemetery 'Zeeburg' (now part of the Flevopark).

For centuries the church was used by the monks of Tutbury Priory, as well as the being the parish church of Tutbury. However, the monastery appears to have been founded slightly later than the church. Most of the nave was rebuilt in the 13th century. At the Reformation the eastern part of the church, which served the monastic community, was demolished along with the priory buildings. The South tower appears to be a 16th-century addition. The north aisle is an addition of 1820-2 by Joseph B H Bennett. The chancel and sanctuary were replaced in 1866 by George Edmund Street funded by Sir Oswald Mosley.

He was also known as Johannes Colizzi. Bohemian and German years Kauchlitz Colizzi was born in Chrudim, a town in eastern Bohemia, a part of the current Czech Republic. There is little data on the family in which he grew up. Only the name of his sister Ludmilla is known. Nothing is known about his education. As an adult Johann Andreas taught his students to play the harpsichord and pianoforte. He also composed and gave singing lessons. His first published composition, a collection of songs with harpsichord accompaniment, appeared in 1766 in Braunschweig. Colizzi also made himself a meritorious etcher.Van Heuvel/Zeiler, 'Biografie', p. 149-152; Clement, 'Aspecten', p. 68. Leiden period On 15 June 1766 he obtained the appointment as an Italian language teacher at Leiden University, in Leiden. The Leiden art society Kunstgenootschap 'Kunst Wordt Door Arbeid Verkreegen' published his bundle with songs and dances on the occasion of the wedding of prince-stadtholder William V of Orange and princess Wilhelmina of Prussia. His orchestral works were written in the Leiden years. Among these works are the 'Ouverture Slavonne' and the 'Quattro Concerti Barbari'. In 1774 his Dissertatio Philisophica De Sono was published based on a manuscript that he had completed six years earlier. The book was followed by several other music theory works of his hand. The Hague period In April and May 1777 Colizzi moved because of his appointment as harpsichordist at the stadtholderly Music Chapel in The Hague and music teacher of, among others, the future Dutch King William I and his mother princess Wilhelmina. In the years 1762-1787 hymns of the Amsterdam reverend Rutger Schutte (1708-1784) were published. Colizzi was asked to write melodies in Italian style for the fourth volume. After the Music Chapel was disbanded, because of the flight of the prince-stadtholder in 1795, Colizzi remained in The Hague. From 1797 dates the composition for singing voice with keyboard accompaniment on the occasion of the silver wedding anniversary of the Danish envoy, baron Herman Schubart (1756-1832) and his wife, celebrated in The Hague.Original manuscript in Zeeuws Archief, Middelburg, Netherlands, archive Schorer family (class 157), inv.nr. 510, a 2002 performance on SoundCloud. Marriage He married in Leiden on 11 May 1772 as the music teacher Jan Collizzi with Cornelia Maria van Dinter, one of the daughters of the Leiden physician Dr. Hermanus van Dinter.

She was regarded as a \\"highly influential figure in the calcium homoeostasis field\\".  Early life and education  Barbara Entwistle was born on 6 March 1939 in Blackburn to Thomas Entwistle, a teacher, and Gladys Mary Entwistle (n√©e Cornall). She attended Blackburn High School and Queen Mary School in Lytham St Annes. She received a BSc in biochemistry from the University of Edinburgh in 1957. She stayed there to conduct research, supervised by Guy Marrian, and in 1961 received a PhD for her thesis entitled The metabolism of cholesterol in the animal body. From 1958 to 1963 she also worked as an assistant lecturer at Edinburgh.  Scientific career  After taking a break from working in order to look after her young children, in 1967 Mawer became a research associate at the University of Manchester, studying vitamin D and metabolic bone disease with William Stanbury. Together they were among the first to demonstrate why patients with renal disease are deficient in calcium ‚Äì namely, they cannot produce calcitriol. Mawer was promoted to senior research fellow in 1974, and she became a \\"North West Regional Health Authority senior research fellow\\" in 1983. Stanbury retired that year, and when Mawer applied to the Medical Research Council for funding, they claimed not to know her, as previously Stanbury had received the funding. However, she would later succeed in receiving, with her colleague Mike Davies, funding of almost one million pounds per year to research the metabolism of vitamin D. They discovered that calcitriol receptors are found throughout the body, and Mawer worked on developing assays for vitamin D metabolites, for which she became well known. She was appointed as a reader in medicine in 1993 before being made Professor of Bone and Mineral Metabolism in 1995. She retired from Manchester in 2001. Mawer was president of the Bone and Tooth Society (now the Bone Research Society) from 1992 to 1994; she had previously served as secretary. Not long before her death the Society established a fellowship to assist its members undertaking research. Mawer was among the founders of Manchester's Bone Disease Research Centre and served as its deputy director from its inception in 1994 until 1997.  Politics  Mawer took part in local politics, serving as a parish councillor and school governor in Thelwall, Warrington, where she lived. She was elected to Warrington Borough Council in 1987, becoming leader of the Liberal Democrat opposition there in 1991. During her tenure the number of Liberal Democrat councillors more than doubled; she herself was well regarded for her intelligence and hard work for the local community. She served as Warrington's representative on the North West Regional Assembly. She stepped down in 2004.  Personal life and death  In 1957 she married George Mawer, a doctor and pharmacologist, with whom she had three daughters; they later divorced amicably. In 1981 she married Clifford Gordon Taylor, a research chemist. Mawer died on 7 March 2006 at Christie Hospital in Manchester, having had liver cancer for two years. She left her daughters and her second husband.

While it was considered \\"groundbreaking\\" when enacted, it has been reformed several times to increase a presumption against bail. The original legislation had three classes of eligibility for bail - minor offences where people were entitled to bail, offences where bail was favoured, and a third where there was no recommendation for or against bail. Prior to creation Prior to the creation of the Bail Act 1978, the bail system in New South Wales relied on rules in different statutes and common law. The Federal Judiciary Act 1903 states that bail will be governed by state laws - there is no federal law for bail. Jurisdiction of State and Territory courts in criminal cases. None of the English Acts concerning bail were adopted under the Imperial Acts Adoption Act 1969. Police \\"almost invariably\\" required cash in order to grant bail, although a person could also act as a surety on behalf of the person being bailed and provide a sum of money. In the seventies, the amount of cash needed for bail could range from $500 to sums of five figures. In 1969, the Institute for Criminology at Sydney University Law School ran a seminar suggesting improvements to the bail system, resulting in a proposed system similar to the Manhattan Bail Project. Armstrong suggested in 1977 that migrants were over-represented in jail because they did not have friends or family to act as sureties for them. 1976 review In April 1976, the Attorney-General Frank Walker convened a Bail Review Committee \\"to examine and report on the system of bail in New South Wales\\". The committee consisted of K.S. Anderson, a stipendiary magistrate, and Susan Armstrong, a lecturer of law at UNSW. The committee's review urged that everyone had the right to be released on bail unless there were strong reasons for refusing it, and recommended that police and the courts should have to show reason why someone should not be granted bail. A study found that bail was more likely to be refused to older people, Aboriginals, \\"shabby\\"-looking people (including those wearing beards - possibly a middle-class prejudice), defendants without a lawyer, defendants with a previous criminal record, and defendants who did not ask for bail. (1976) 1(4) University of New South Wales Law Journal 298. Two studies were conducted into bail by the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research to assist the Committee, their findings were published in 1977. The BoCSaR review noted that cases such as Philip Western, who killed a bank manager while on bail, were capable of triggering reviews of the bail law. While the Committee recommended a presumption in favour of bail for all offenses, an exception was added for violent or armed robbery by the NSW Government. Stubbs states that at that time, \\"governments took no pleasure in high rates of imprisonment and of remand in custody\\". Police training and introduction After the legislation was passed in December 1978, police were trained in its use. Police described the law as overly complex. The assistant general secretary of the Police Association, Bruce Howe, criticised it as being \\"completely hopeless\\", and the Assistant Police Commissioner in charge of training, K. Jensen, suggested that the amount of paperwork involved in the new law would result in police being pulled off the streets unless more personnel were provided. In January 1980, the new law was not yet in force. Due to a shooting on Boxing Day 1979 where the gunman was free on bail, the issue of the bail law was important to the community, and Neville Wran was facing criticism over the law not yet being in force. The Shadow Attorney- General, John Maddison, criticised the government over not including the police when drafting up the new laws. Bail Assessment Service and Supervision Program (1983) After the law was enacted, it became evident that bail was not being granted to as many people as the law had intended. A Bail Assessment Service and Supervision Program (BASS) was set up, based on research from courts in the United States and Europe which were influenced by the Manhattan Bail Project. A pilot program began in January 1983 and ran for six months in an inner city area. Magistrates found the information provided by the BASS program helpful and granted bail to two thirds of applicants who had been refused bail by the police. 1988 amendments In 1988, the bail law was amended to introduce a class of offences where the presumption was against granting bail, the Bail (Amendment) Act 1988. The Bail (Further Amendment) Act 1988 ensured people retained a presumption in favour of bail for minor offences. 1998 amendment The Bail Amendment Act 1998 reduced the presumption in favour of bail for manslaughter, wounding with intent, kidnapping, aggravated sexual assault, sexual intercourse with a child under 10, and assault with intent to commit sexual intercourse with a child under 10. This act was linked to the Bega schoolgirl murders. 2002 amendments In June 2001 the Police Commissioner called for changes to the bail law in regards to repeat offenders. The 2002 amendments removed the presumption in favour of bail for some kinds of repeat offenders. These amendments have been described as being part of the lead-up to the 2003 election, where both the government and opposition were trying to show the electorate that they were tough on crime. They added in provisions aimed at \\"increasing access to bail\\" for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, juveniles and intellectually disabled or mentally ill people. A 2004 study found that these measures did not have the effect of increasing access to bail for Indigenous people or juveniles. The amendments created to allow rehabilitation as being part of bail conditions have been described as an attempt at therapeutic jurisprudence, but have garnered criticism as making the bail process part of the punishment.Booth, T. & Townsley, L. 2009, 'The Process is the Punishment: The Case of Bail in New South Wales', Current Issues in Criminal Justice, vol. 21, no. 1, pp. 41-58. 2003 In 2003, a woman was murdered by her estranged husband, and this prompted further review of the Bail Act. Section 22A The original Bail Act did not limit the number of bail applications. Section 22A is a section of the law introduced in 2007 which aimed to reduce frivolous bail applications. However, it had the effect of increasing the number of people in remand, particularly young people. Due to the section giving one chance for bail, legal counsel would as a matter of course advise their clients not to apply for bail early on, leading to accused persons being put on remand. Criticism New South Wales has been described as the \\"most punitive\\" state when it comes to amendments to its bail legislation. The Bail Bill 2010 removed several criteria to ensure the rights of the person accused. Alex Steel commented that this would make it harder for the person accused to make a case, because prisoners on remand are automatically placed in maximum security. As of 2010, a lobby group called the Bail Reform Alliance campaigned for changes to the law. Members of the Alliance included the NSW Law Society, NSW Young Lawyers, the Public Service Association, the NSW Council for Civil Liberties and the NSW Welfare Rights Centre. A study in 2011 found that between 1999 and 2008, there had been a decline in the percentage of cases where bail was given without any conditions attached. It found that this was not due to a difference in the cases in 2008 from 1999, but instead there was stricter conditions being attached to bail in later years. Furthermore, the study pointed out that bail conditions leaves the defendant 'vulnerable to re- arrest' for further offenses or for breaching their bail conditions, and that even when breach of bail conditions does not involve an offense, it often leads to remand. During the period of 1978 to 2007, the Bail Act 1978 was one of the most frequently amended pieces of legislation, being amended every 4.5 months. Review and repeal On 9 June 2011, Premier Barry O'Farrell announced that the NSW Law Reform Commission would review the bail law. In April 2012, the Commission reported that the Bail Act 1978 had become complex, making it difficult even for legal practitioners to understand and apply. It noted that over the 15 years prior, the population in remand had tripled due to \\"policy shifts\\". It recommended a new, simplified, bail law, to be written in \\"plain English\\".Report 133 Law Reform Commission: Bail (2012) NSW Law Reform Commission.

On 5 September 1968 the base was severely damaged by Typhoon Bess. A Loran-C station, designation SH-3 \\"Z\\" was established at T√¢n M·ªπ in 1969 and operated by the United States Coast Guard. In March 1970 T√¢n M·ªπ Naval Support Activity ceased operations and the base facilities were handed over to the U.S. Army Support Command. 1971-4 On 23 May 1972 during the Easter Offensive, the 7th Marine Battalion launched Operation Song Than 6-72, an amphibious assault from T√¢n M·ªπ against the flanks of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) force on the Street Without Joy. On 8 September 1972 during the Second Battle of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã, Vietnamese Rangers boarded the at T√¢n M·ªπ to conduct a feint amphibious assault intended to draw PAVN forces away from the Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã citadel. In late 1972 Troop F, 4th Cavalry was based at T√¢n M·ªπ before being withdrawn from Vietnam in late February 1973. 1975 On 22 March 1975 in the face of the PAVN offensive, the decision was made to abandon Hu·∫ø and withdraw all South Vietnamese forces to an enclave around Danang. The plan was for the 147th Marine Brigade to withdraw to the T√¢n M·ªπ Base where they would be picked up by Republic of Vietnam Navy ships. The base was soon swamped with Marines, soldiers and civilians seeking evacuation, however only smaller ships were able to dock at the base and ferry evacuees to larger ships offshore. Due to the overcrowding and the threat from the closing PAVN, the Marines moved further down the coast where two attempts were made to pick them up by LST over the next 2 days, however the LST could only approach to within several hundred feet of the shore forcing the Marines to attempt to swim out to the ship, in the end only approximately 600 of the 3000 Marines were evacuated to Danang. Current use The base is abandoned but the airfield and docks are still clearly visible on satellite images. On the ground, the airfield bitumen runway is still intact although overgrown with weeds, and the control tower is fully intact.

With scenery and costumes designed by the composer's wife Isabel Lambert, it was first presented by the Royal Ballet at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, London, on 9 July 1951.Alexander Bland, The Royal Ballet: The First Fifty Years. London: Threshold Books, 1981, p286. Background The idea of a ballet on the subject of the Greek seer who changes sex was first considered by Lambert in the 1930s. Lambert started composing the score in Paris, but due to the distractions of other work he had to enlist assistance for the orchestration from younger colleagues, such as Robert Irving, Humphrey Searle, Gordon Jacob, Alan Rawsthorne and Elisabeth Lutyens.Motion, Andrew. The Lamberts: George, Constant & Kit, Chatto & Windus, London, 1986, p250-251. One of three ballets commissioned for the Festival of Britain, Lambert's score is roughly contemporary with French composer Francis Poulenc's short comic opera Les mamelles de Tir√©sias first performed at the Op√©ra-Comique in 1947, on a similar sex-change theme, based on Guillaume Apollinaire's surrealist text of 1917.Stephen Lloyd: Constant Lambert: Beyond the Rio Grande, Boydell Press, 2015 The premiere was conducted by the composer and given in the presence of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. There were 12 performances in 1951, then ten the following year, seven in 1953, three in 1954 and two in the next season. The critical reception was generally negative, and the composer instructed solicitors to challenge the hostile review by Richard Buckle, which cast aspersions on the entire artistic leadership of the Royal Ballet company.Reprinted in Buckle, Richard.

After a solo and a dance for Tiresias and male corps de ballet, priestesses and a young virgin come on the scene. The Neophyte gives him a wand and departs. Tiresias spots two snakes copulating and in a rage he strikes the female snake with his staff and is thus changed into a woman. Following a pastoral interlude, shepherds and shepherdesses enter and dance with Tiresias. Her lover appears, and they dance a climactic pas de deux. Then there is a bacchanale celebrating their happiness, at the end of which two snakes enters, engaged as before. Tiresias strikes the male snake with her staff, and is restored to his original self. Another interlude transforms the scene to a palace courtyard where Zeus and Hera are arguing whether men or women get most pleasure in sex. Called to be judge Tiresias declares that women do, and Hera angrily blinds him, but Zeus bestows the gift of prophecy on Tiresias and he departs.David Vaughan, Frederick Ashton and His Ballets, revised edition (London: Dance Books, 1999), Synopsis p. 423.

History As early as the beginning of the 16th century, the region of Bretanha was already occupied by a few settlers. The first reference to Bretanha appeared only between 1515 and 1527, since the northwestern region of the island of S√£o Miguel was known as Capelas. In 1515, the region was deannexed from the municipality of Vila Franca do Campo and integrated into the municipality of Ponta Delgada (which was created in 1499). There is little information that survives from this period (1515-1527), a point in the region's chronology occupied with early settlement. At that time historian Gaspar Frutuoso named then area Bretanha, for the rugged, highlands of Brittany: the area was referred to as the places of the north (and may have colloquially referred to the Portuguese vernacular, as \\"distant lands in the north\\"). Later authors would attribute the regions name to an emigrants from Brittany, who lived in the lands of this region. Francisco Drumond described it as \\"a port village that sheltered the furious winds, situated on land little elevated, oriented to the north, a league and half to the west of Santo Ant√≥nio\\". The church of Nossa Senhora da Ajuda existed in 1525, in 1716 the Church of Nossa Senhora da Ajuda was founded and in 1856, the Church of Nossa Senhora dos Rem√©dios was also established, serving an ever-increasing agrarian population. These settlements were based primarily on agriculture, herding and fishing. In 1960, Bretanha comprised three localities: Rem√©dios, Ajuda and Pilar. Rem√©dios was deannexed from Bretanha (by decree-law 43.392) on 13 December 1960, to form the parish of Rem√©dios. Bretanha ceased to function as an independent parish on 10 July 2002 (under decree-law 24A/02), when it was subdivided into two new civil parishes of Ajuda da Bretanha and Pilar da Bretanha. Geography The parish had an area of approximately and approximately 1334 inhabitants at the time that it was divided, pertaining to a population density of little over 102 people per square kilometre.

In its inception, CPTC had remained engaged in training only the constable level within limited resources and training facilities. Now, the changing trend of policing as per the changed political context has demanded well versed and qualified police officers to meet the public expectations. Its prime responsibility apparently lies in developing professional competency of the senior police officers through conducting foundation as well as advanced training courses. To accomplish this objective needs sufficient and well- trained police personnel which is impossible to envisage without the efforts and the contribution of the training institute. NPA is solely responsible for conducting basic and advanced programs of the police officers. NPA relentlessly indulged in new scientific methods and advanced technological adaptations to ensure the new concept of policing. The introduction of improved administrative practices focuses on enhancing qualitative instructors and its training to bring about improvements in administrative, investigative, and overall improvement on police professionals. Human Resource Development NPA primarily does concern with human resource development activities as identified on an organizational level to promote professional skills by running different quality training programs.

They were of a \\"cab over engine\\" design, and produced by the Autocar Company from 1941 to 1945 with 2,711 being built. The U8144 had a similar chassis, with van bodies by York-Hoover ‚Äî 607 were built for use of the SCR-270 early warning radar system by the U.S. Signal Corps. As part of the same family, over 11,000 of the U7144-T, and some 2,750 of the virtually identical White 444T were built to serve as rear area tractor trucks to haul semi-trailers, ranging from flatbed to communications vans.  History  In the late 1930s, as the war approached, the Autocar Company, that had been selling trucks to the U.S. Army since 1909, began adapting their commercial cab over engine - or C.O.E. - trucks for military duty. In 1939 Autocar began developing their two-wheel drive, 5-ton (4,536 kg; on road cargo rating) Model U70 truck, into a four wheel drive range ‚Äî the -ton (2,268 kg; off-road load rating) U2044, U4044 and U4144 trucks and U4044-T and U4144-T tractors;Autocar U-2044 / 4044 / 4144 / 5044 ‚Äì Trucks PlanetOldtimers gallery.

In the nomenclature, ‚ÄúU‚Äù indicated \\"engine Under the seats\\" (for C.O.E.); the first two numerals were the core model number, the next two numerals indicated the wheels and drive (44 for 4x4), and ‚ÄúT‚Äù indicated tractor. Autocar 4044-T/4144-T 2¬Ω-ton tractor truck (1940/1941) The first in the range was the 2.5-ton model U2044 truck, with a TM 5-5167: Engine, Gasoline, Hercules Models JXC and JXD Hercules JXD engine with an output of 84HP ‚Äî but once equipped with Autocar's own , 100HP, six-cylinder gasoline engine, the trucks evolved into the U4000 range. Autocar built 233 models U2044 and U4044 trucks, and 548 model U4044-T tractors in 1940-1941; and 138 model U4144 trucks and 274 model U4144-T tractors in 1941. The model U2044, U4044 and U4144 trucks were all built by Autocar as cab and chassis, with third-party bodies, as -ton, L-1, 660 gallons, Oil Servicing tankers ‚Äì 371 units in all. A further 822 units were built as towing tractors ‚Äì 548 models U4044-T and 274 models U4144-T. All U2044 and U4044/U4144 models (1,193 units) were mechanically largely similar and grouped together as the SNL G-626. The U5044-T (a.k.a. G-635) was also powered by Autocar's , 100HP engine, but had twice the load rating as the U4144-T. Only 97 were produced in 1940 and 1941 ‚Äì primarily as a line haul tractor to tow fuel trucks.Autocar U-5044-T Tractor ‚Äì Olive-Drab In 1941, the U8144T became the Army's standard ponton tractor - a specialized tractor for towing ponton trailers, loaded with bridge sections Autocar U-8144-T Ponton Tractor ‚Äì Olive-Drab \\\\- and went into production.  Engine and driveline  For the U8144 models, a Hercules RXC engine was used. This L-head inline 6 cylinder gasoline engine developed at 2300 rpm and of torque at 900 rpm. The 5-speed manual transmission was direct in 4th gear and had an overdrive gear. A 2-speed transfer case also engaged or disengaged the front axle. The ladder frame had a wheelbase with two banjo style live beam axles on leaf springs. Brakes were full air, the tires were 12.00x20.  Bodies  The U8144T tractor was used to tow semi-trailers with 10-ton or 25-ton ponton bridging equipment. Directly behind the cab was a large toolbox. 2,711 were built between 1941 and 1945, of which 42 went to the Soviet Union under the Lend Lease Act.Engines of the Red Army in WW2: Autocar U-8144T The U8144 had a similar chassis with van bodies built by York-Hoover. They were used by the Signal Corps for the SCR-270 early warning radar. The K-30 was the operating truck and the K-31 was the power generator truck. The K-30 had a window on the left and right front side of the van body and the K-31 did not. There was also a K-62(-A) operating truck; 607 of all types were built. U7144-T Tractor, 4- to 5-ton, 4x4 / White 444T Autocar U7144-T tractor truck The Autocar U7144-T or (G-510) was a shorter version of the U8144-T tractor truck, with the same driveline, but with a shorter wheelbase and without the toolbox behind the cab. Nor did it have the U8144's oversize tires ‚Äì using 9.00x20s instead, and it was rated at 4-tons off road. The model was also built by White Motor Company, who bought Autocar in 1953,History ‚Äì Autocar Trucks as their Model 444T (G-691), and there was the mechanically equivalent Federal G-513. Together, these were the U.S. Army's standard 4- to 5-ton, 4x4 tractor trucks, used for towing a variety of semi- trailers, like the 25-foot and 40-foot, -ton type C-2 flatbeds (for wrecking, moving aircraft, and general hauling), and the AAF type F-2 and F-2A fuel tankers. The U7144-T also towed a trailer with SCR-270 antenna support components. The U7144-T and White 444T had a maximum towed load capacity of 30,000 lbs, and both were powered by the same Hercules RXC 529 cu.in., 112HP, six-cylinder gasoline engine.Autocar U-7144-T Tractor ‚Äì Olive-Drab Autocar built 11,104 of these from 1941 through August 1945, and White built another 2,751 units from mid 1944 to 1945. For all intents and purposes, the White 444T was an exact double of the Autocar U7144-T, in every aspect, and the U.S. Army published not a single technical manual (TM) specific to the White truck. Nor did any of the Autocar's manuals mention the existence of White-built units. Nevertheless, White assigned its own parts numbers for their trucks, so the only official \\"manual\\" publication for the White was the SNL G-691 supply parts catalog.
