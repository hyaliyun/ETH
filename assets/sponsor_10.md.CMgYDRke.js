There had been some debate as to whether or not she was of Manchu descent. It had been claimed that she was born into a banner family named Gu and took on Manchu identity after her marriage to Yihui Â•ï‰ºö (1799-1838), a Manchu prince. Other scholars claim that the confusion about her identity is an attempt to obscure her family's descent from E-er-tai, a Manchu grand secretary disgraced (and forced to commit suicide) during one of Qianlong's literary inquisitions.Ellen Widmer, The Beauty and the Book: Women and Fiction on Nineteenth-Century China. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Asia Center, 2006, pp.187-88 discusses various versions of the story of Gu's family background.

Her marriage to Yihui seems to have been a happy one, despite the fact that she had the status of concubine rather than primary princess consort (Yihui's princess consort was Lady He≈°eri). She had five children‚Äîthree sons and two daughters. Yihui also had children with his primary wife, who died early. Gu's life was thrown into turmoil when her husband died in 1838. Yihui's family forced her and her children out of their Beijing home. The reasons for their hostility are unclear, but a rumored affair between Gu Taiqing and Gong Zichen may have been part of the story. During this period of poverty she may have sustained her family by selling jewelry and artwork.Widmer, The Beauty and the Book, p.188. Some sources say that she had seven children. After the death of her husband, Gu's circle of female friends, including the Xu sisters Yunlin and Yunjiang and Shen Shanbao, who was her sworn sister,Ellen Widmer, \\"Honglou Meng Sequels and their Female Readerships in Nineteenth-Century China\\" in Snakes' Kegs: Sequels, Continuations, Rewritings and Chinese Fiction, edited by Martin Huang.

Basic elements such as movement, space, action and time, all expressed through the human figure, are reflected in her work. The Boston Globe has written that \\"she explores the concept of time, with long shadows lingering across paintings\\". The characters that Navarro uses for her paintings are people that have crossed paths with her in different locations around the world.

With a slightly higher than average number of people over 65, the population of just the civil parish was measured at 6,629 as at the 2011 Census. Every year around the August Bank Holiday, Sawley All Saints holds a flower festival, with themed floral displays inside the church and a beer festival held in the village.

Canal boats moored in Sawley Marina Sawley Marina is one of the most prominent features of the village, with access to the region's main waterways.Sawley marina website History Sawley 'All Saints' Church The old name for Sawley was Sall√©. Between Sawley and Church Wilne and Great Wilne is the junction of the River Derwent and the Trent. It is to this that Sawley owes its position. The church of All Saints is thirteenth century and contains Saxon and Norman work. and commands a position on a small rise near the river. Up until the 19th century, Sawley was the most important village in the area, commanding the first river crossing, Harrington Bridge, above Nottingham. In 2009, Sawley was blighted with a smell coming from waste products being legally dumped onto nearby farmland. The smell was dubbed the 'Sawley Stink'. A dedicated group of local residents campaigned successfully to put an end to the process, with recyclers agreeing to stop the pollution. Opposite from Sawley churches is Bothe Hall once owned by the Booth family. The Booths were a wealthy landowning family from Cheshire whose principal seat was at Dunham Massey. Bothe Hall was probably built between 1660 and 1680, and has an interior that contains some exposed ceiling beams and a regency staircase. Another monumental building in the village, is the Sawley Memorial Hall and Community Centre, which was opened by Richard Attenborough in 1958 to remember those who died during the two World Wars. The Sawley and District Historical Society held a display about the war years associated to the village and surrounding areas, in the Sawley All Saints Church, back in August 2009. Other buildings of interest in the area include Sawley Baptist Church, which was built in the 1800.

Description  The mangrove kingfisher is about long. The male and female are alike. The head is dark grey-brown, with black lores and a narrow white line above the eye, and the cheeks and sides of the neck are brown-grey. The grey breast and flanks are vermiculated (having dense, irregular lines). There is a black patch under the wing. The rest of the plumage is similar to the woodland kingfisher, having black and blue covert and flight feathers. The beak of the mangrove kingfisher is red, the eyes are dark brown, and the legs are dark grey-brown. The juvenile bird is duller, has coarser vermiculations and a yellowish-buff wash on the breast, and has a brown beak. Birds in the south tend to have slightly longer wings and narrower beaks. Distribution and habitat This species is found near the eastern coast of Africa, from Somalia, south through Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique, to South Africa. One individual has been recorded in eastern Zambia. It usually occurs within of the coast, but is also found inland along the Jubba and Zambezi rivers. It is considered a partial migrant. When not breeding, it lives in estuaries and mangrove, and also wooded shores, thornveld, forest, cultivated land, parks and gardens. To breed, it leaves estuaries and mangrove, moving to woodland and wooded rivers; these are generally farther inland, an exception being that they breed in the Zanzibar Archipelago. Behaviour This kingfisher catches fish and also eats crabs, prawns, lizards and insects. The song is a raucous, accelerating series of tchi notes, and the breeding display includes spreading the wings. Breeding has been recorded from October to January. Nests have been recorded in tree holes and termite nests. Status The population appears to be declining because of habitat loss, but the decline is not rapid, and the species has a large range, so the IUCN has assessed it as a least-concern species. Juveniles sometimes collide with human structures while migrating.

The line had been planned, and authorised in 1882, by the Kingsbridge and Salcombe Railway which was subsequently acquired by the GWR in 1888. The station was host to a GWR camp coach from 1934 to 1939. A camping coach was also positioned here by the Western Region from 1952 to 1957 then two coaches from 1958 to 1961. The station was downgraded to an unstaffed halt when it closed to freight on 6 February 1961. Despite local opposition it was closed on 16 September 1963 and is now a private dwelling.

She served as a Judge of the Supreme Court from 1992 to 2017, and was the longest-serving member of the court on her retirement. She also served as a Judge of the High Court from 1991 to 1992. Early life Susan Gageby was born in Dublin in 1945 and educated at Alexandra College, Dublin. She is the daughter of the former editor of The Irish Times, Douglas Gageby, the sister of another barrister Patrick Gageby and maternal granddaughter of Se√°n Lester. She is from a Church of Ireland background. She attended Trinity College, Dublin, the King's Inns, and the Law School of Columbia University, New York City (LL.M. 1972). She was involved with the Free Legal Advice Centres while studying in Dublin and was a founder and president of the Archaeology and Folklife Society at Trinity College. Legal career She was called to the bar in July 1971 and became a Senior Counsel in October 1987. She was the fourth woman to enter the Inner Bar. She became a senior counsel on the same day as future Supreme Court colleague Mary Laffoy. She worked on the Midland circuit until 1979, following which she was based in Dublin. She was involved in a number of leading cases while a junior barrister and a Senior Counsel particularly in the area of judicial review.  Judicial career   High Court and Supreme Court  She became a High Court judge in 1991. In 1992, at the age of 47, she was the first woman appointed to the Supreme Court. She was considered for appointment to the role of President of the High Court in 1994, but declined to have her name put forward. She made two dissents early on in her period on the Court. Throughout her tenure as a judge she was seen by commentators to be a \\"liberal\\" judge. In Kelly v Hennessy in 1996, she outlined criteria for a court to consider as evidence of the existence of nervous shock in Ireland. In 2001, she was the sole member of the Supreme Court to dissent in TD v Minister for Education. The court overturned a decision of Peter Kelly in the High Court to direct the government to build secure care units for certain children. From 1995 to 1998, she chaired the Working Group on a Courts Commission, which was responsible for a significant reform of the organisation of the courts since the foundation of the state. It led to the establishment of the Courts Service. She was on the Interim Board of the Court Service and served on the Board of the Court Service from its inception, and chaired the board from 2001 to 2004. She chaired the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure which recommended in 2002 the establishment of a commercial court within the High Court. From 2006, she chaired the Working Group on a Court of Appeal. The report of the group was published by the government in August 2009. It recommended the establishment of a general Court of Appeal. This was ultimately established in 2014, after a referendum in 2013. Denham was part of the Irish delegation which, with the Netherlands and Belgium, established the European Network of Councils for the Judiciary (ENCJ) and she continues an involvement in this Network. From 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016, she was President of the Network of the Presidents of the Supreme Judicial Courts of the European Union which is an association of Supreme Court Presidents and Chief Justices of EU Member States. She wrote the judgment in McD v. L (2009), upholding the parental rights of a sperm donor.  Chief Justice  On 4 July 2011, she was nominated by Taoiseach Enda Kenny to become Chief Justice of Ireland, she was appointed as Chief Justice by President Mary McAleese on 25 July 2011. She was the first woman appointed to the office and as a member of the Church of Ireland, she was the first non-Catholic to hold the position. She was also the first graduate of Trinity College, Dublin to have been appointed; Chief Justices have largely been graduates of University College Dublin. She succeeded John L. Murray. During her tenure as Chief Justice, the Supreme Court issued suspended declarations of unconstitutionality for the first time. The possibility to delay the effect of a court declaration that a piece of legislation is contrary to the Constitution was first explored by Denham in A v Governor of Arbour Hill Prison. The court first adopted this approach in N.V.H v Minister for Justice & Equality in May 2017. As Chief Justice, she oversaw changes in the operations of the Supreme Court and the courts generally. She oversaw the removal of the requirement for judges to wear wigs while hearing cases. In 2015, the Supreme Court sat outside Dublin for the first time since 1931, sitting in Cork. She corresponded with the Office of Public Works over the lack of heating in the Four Courts, threatening to cancel sittings if the issue was not resolved. She advocated for the inclusion of a new courtroom for the Supreme Court in plans to develop a new family court complex on Hammond Lane. In her capacity as Chief Justice, she oversaw the administration of the Presidential Declaration of Office at the inauguration of President Michael D. Higgins in Dublin Castle in November 2011. She retired from the position in July 2017, and was succeeded by Judge Frank Clarke. She was the third-longest serving Supreme Court judge ever at the time of her retirement. In her remarks on her retirement, she drew attention to the government's failure to institute a judicial council, having first attempted to persuade the government to establish one in 1997.  Post- retirement  The Courts Service announced on 24 August 2020 that the Supreme Court had appointed her to review the attendance of Supreme Court judge S√©amus Woulfe at a dinner organised by the Oireachtas Golf Society. She was appointed on a non-statutory basis as the relevant section in the Judicial Council Act 2019 on judicial conduct had not yet been commenced.  Personal life  She is married to paediatrician Dr Brian Denham and they have four children. From 1996 to 2010, Denham was a Pro-Chancellor of Trinity College, Dublin.

Omnivorous, they feed mainly on detritus; these fish search for food by digging in the sediment. They are of squat, tadpole-like shape, with a large, very ossified head that has three pairs of barbels, which are rather long. They are nocturnal animals active during twilight. Requires enough hiding places between roots and stones during the day. They lie hidden in the underwater roots and stocks. Eats worms and insect larvae, feed residues and artificial food. Prolonged temporary cooling, can burrow into the ground at lightning speed, that only the eyes look out, others emit growling noises, if you catch them out, reproduction is little explored, some species are to build nests, the Spiny catfish can become very old. They are able to produce sounds; every basic unit of the sound they emit when they move their pectoral spine lasts 100-200 milliseconds and has a frequency of 170-250 hertz. The barbels of the males are brown and yellowish white striated, the females monochrome yellowish white. The soil should be fine-grained and contain peat.

By 1981, with Tillett on piano and lead vocals, the group were moving into a \\"tougher 1960s-influenced direction\\". In 1982 Bradbury left to join Severed Heads and was replaced by Nick Fisher on drums. Peter Watt also joined on rhythm guitar but was replaced in the next year by Penny Ikinger. In February 1984 The Wet Taxis first toured Melbourne, they were hailed as sporting an American garage- style psychedelic sound, they covered bands such as MC5, Moving Sidewalks and Unrelated Segments. In Melbourne they supported Kids in the Kitchen at one gig and Chris Bailey at another. They followed with a live broadcast from the Prince of Wales Hotel, St.Kilda, on 3PBS FM radio. The group signed with the Hot Records label and recorded a single, \\"C'mon\\", which was a cover version of The Atlantics 1967 track, \\"Come On\\". It was produced by David Connor and Kent Steedman, and was released in May 1984. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, noted it provided \\"an authentic 1960s garage/R&B; sound\\". Late that year they issued an album, From the Archives, and by February 1985 went into hiatus. In July 1986 Pollyanna Sutton of The Canberra Times described the album as \\"a mix of studio and live recordings over three years\\". In 2002 the band, alongside Laughing Clowns, The Lighthouse Keepers and Gondwanaland Project, were described by The Sydney Morning Heralds Matt Buchanan as one \\"of the most popular bands in the Australia's indie scene\\" in an article reminiscing about Hot Records. Back in late 1983, Tillett worked with Damien Lovelock of The Celibate Rifles and Brett Myers of Died Pretty in a side project, No Dance. The trio issued a three-track EP, Carnival of Souls, in March 1984; which featured lead vocals by each member: Tillett's \\"Swimming in the Mirror\\", Lovelock's \\"You Say\\", and Myers' \\"Just Skin\\". McFarlane described No Dance's style, \\"[they] eschewed the electric rock framework of the musicians' respective bands for a more acoustic and melodic approach\\". In mid- year Tillett provided piano for Laughing Clowns' album, Ghosts of an Ideal Wife (August 1985). By late 1984 Tillett was working with another side project, Paris Green, with a core of himself, Raoul Hawkins on bass guitar, and Jeffrey Wegener on drums (ex-Laughing Clowns) joined by \\"a loose aggregation of musicians\\". Other musicians included Louis Burdett on drums (ex-Benders) and Charlie Owen on lead guitar (ex-Tango Bravo). According to McFarlane Paris Green \\"covered material ranging from Mose Allison to John Coltrane, Ray Charles to Nina Simone, and on any given night there was as many as nine or ten musicians on stage\\". Tillet (on piano) and Fisher worked on Ed Kuepper's debut solo album, Electrical Storm (June 1985). In January 1986 Tillett, Fisher and Ikinger revived The Wet Taxis with Rod Howard on bass guitar, Jason Kain on lead guitar (ex-Relatives), and Bronstantine Karlarka on keyboards. By May they were joined by a brass section of Dianne Spence on saxophone, Kathy Wemyss on trumpet (both ex-Laughing Clowns), and Gladys Reed on trombone. Reed had backed No Dance on Carnival of Souls. In July Tillett described his three newest members to Sutton, \\"[t]here are so many hot female musicians in Sydney and none seem to be getting a go. It is not just a gimmick\\". The Wet Taxis supported a tour by Nico and undertook other tours. They issued a single, \\"Sailor's Dream\\" in May 1987, which was produced by Rob Younger (of Radio Birdman, New Christs) at Paradise Studios for Citadel Records. The band broke up by mid-year. Tillett recorded his debut solo album, Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell, with bandmates Ikinger and Spence; Burdett and Owen (both now ex-New Christs); and with Lenny Bastiaans on bass guitar. Tillett co-produced with Bruce Callaway, it was issued on Citadel Records during November 1987. McFarlane felt its style was a mix of \\"jazz, blues, R&B;, pop and rock, making for fascinating and engrossing listening\\". Tillett told Stuart Coupe of The Canberra Times his motivation, \\"[it] was to play songs within a wide spectrum, everything from a full band through to a duet. It gets away from the expectations that people have with me of it always sounding like Wet Taxis\\". To promote his album, Tillett assembled a backing band, The Ego Trippers from Hell, and toured Australia. In 1989 Tillett briefly joined Catfish, Don Walker's side-project, on vocals. Also in that year Tillett fronted The Aspersion Caste, aka Louis Tillett and His Cast of Aspersions, with Bastiaans, Burdett, Ikinger (by then ex-Kings of the World) and Owen; they were joined by Miroslav Bukovsky on trumpet, James Greening on trombone, and Jason Morphett on saxophone. The group released a single, \\"Condemned to Live\\", in January 1990 on the Blue Mosque label, which was distributed by Festival Records. McFarlane felt it displayed \\"astonishing gut- bucket blues that packed a considerable punch\\". In 1989, Tillett also contributed piano to the debut single from Sydney band Bughouse. In April 1990 the parent album, A Cast of Aspersions, followed on Blue Mosque/Festival Records which was co-produced by Tillett and Owen. It was \\"another eclectic set of material driven by Tillett's booming baritone voice and smouldering organ, Owen's jagged guitar lines and the swinging brass arrangements\\" according to McFarlane. The Canberra Times Penelope Layland was \\"let down by the lyrics\\" while his \\"musicianship is impeccable, his melding of jazz and rock is imaginative and perfectly executed\\", however \\"[c]annibals and witches populate Tillett's songs, and these characters indulge in an array of unspeakable pagan rites ... the lyrics seem to be aimed at kids at a slumber party, trying to outscare each other with horror stories\\". Tillett and The Aspersion Caste toured Australian and then Europe. By 1991 The Aspersion Caste line-up was Fisher and Spence with Jackie Orszaczky on bass guitar (ex-Syrius) and Colin Watson on guitar. Orszaczky was soon replaced by Damian Kennedy on bass guitar. The backing group were disbanded in the next year as Tillett worked on his solo album, Letters to a Dream (October 1992), which he co- produced with Barry Wolfison. Bevan Hannan writing for The Canberra Timess finds \\"[t]he instrumentals are infatuating, perhaps long-winded at times, but to Tillett's credit he sustains the mood, mainly due to the absence of electronics and a rhythm section. His bold operatic voice is engaging and he works an interesting interplay with backing singer Mary-Ellen Stringer\\". In June 1993 Tillett (on piano, Hammond organ, vocals and percussion) and Owen (on guitar and percussion) recorded an album, The Ugly Truth, with Owen producing. It was released in 1994 on Return to Sender/Normal Records. The pair released a second album together, Midnight Rain, in October 1995, which was produced by Tony Cohen. For that album Tillett provided lead vocals, piano, Hammond organ, Roland synthesiser and soprano saxophone. The pair toured in support of the album. Midnight Rain won the Rolling Stone Critics Award for Best Album of 1996. Later that year Tillett and Owen joined Tex Perkins' backing band on a promotional tour for the latter's debut solo album, Far Be It from Me (August 1996).

The exact location has been debated for centuries, but southwest of present-day Selma, Alabama, is one possibility. In 1540 Chief Tuskaloosa arranged for more than 2500 native warriors to be concealed at Mabila, prepared to attack a large party of foreign invaders in the Mississippian culture territory: Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto and his expedition.Sylvia Flowers, \\"DeSoto's Expedition\\", U.S. National Park Service, 2007, webpage: NPS-DeSoto. DeSoto's route: map shows Mabila (lower left, in green circle) in Hernando de Soto's extensive expedition though Native American territories in what is now Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi and into Arkansas. When Hernando de Soto had first met Tuskaloosa at his home village, and asked him for supplies, Tuskaloosa advised them to travel to another of his towns, known as Mabila, where supplies would be waiting. A native messenger was sent ahead to Mabila. When Tuskaloosa arrived with the first group of Spaniards, he asked the Spanish people to leave the settlement and territory. A fight broke out between one soldier and a native, and many warriors emerged from where they had been hiding in houses and began shooting arrows at the Spaniards. The Spaniards fled, leaving their possessions inside the fortress. The full conflict that resulted is called the Battle of Mabila. Armed with guns, the Spaniards eventually burned down the village and killed most of the warriors. The single primary source about DeSoto's expedition was written by Hern√°ndez de Biedma. Another account, usually described as that of DeSoto's aide Rodrigo Ranjel, survives only partially in a summary history written by Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de Oviedo y Vald√©s. That secondary source had a strong influence on the formation of the text generally known as the Rela√ßam of the \\"Gentleman of Elvas\\" and, in turn, on the writing of Garcilaso de la Vega's Florida del Inca. (see review of The Hernando de Soto Expedition: History, Historiography, and Discovery in the Southeast in Journal of Interdisciplinary History 30.3, Winter 1999, webpage: SIU-G). Fortress town The walled compound of Mabila, one of many encountered by the Spaniards in their exploration, was enclosed in a thick stuccoed wall, 16.5-ft (5-m) high. It was made from wide tree trunks tied with cross-beams and covered with mud/straw stucco, to appear as a solid wall. The fortress was defended by Muskogee warriors, who shot arrows or threw stones. Based on the earlier sources, Garcilaso de la Vega described the town of Mabila as: Related spellings: Mavila, Mavilla, Mauvilla. Artist's impression of Mabila: note walls appear solid (stuccoed tree trunks). Battle of Mabila The Spaniards suffered their greatest losses of the De Soto Expedition during the battle at Mabila, but the Mississippians suffered even more grievous losses. De Soto had demanded supplies, bearers, and women from the powerful Chief Tuskaloosa, when they met him at his main town. He said they needed to go to another settlement, and took them to Mabila. On October 18, 1540, de Soto and the expedition arrived at Mabila, a heavily fortified village situated on a plain. It had a wooden palisade encircling it, with bastions placed so that archers could shoot their longbows to cover the approaches. Upon arriving at Mabila, the Spaniards knew something was amiss. The population of the town was almost exclusively male- young warriors and men of status. There were several women, but no children. The Spaniards also noticed the palisade had been recently strengthened, and that all trees, bushes, and weeds, had been cleared from outside the settlement for the length of a crossbow shot. Outside the palisade, they saw an older warrior in a field, who was seen exhorting younger warriors, and leading them in mock skirmishes and military exercises. When the Spaniards reached the town of Mabila, ruled by one of Tuskaloosa's vassals, the Chief asked de Soto to allow him to remain there. When de Soto refused, Tuskaloosa warned him to leave the town, then withdrew to another room, and refused to talk further. A lesser chief was asked to intercede, but he would not. One of the Spaniards, according to Elvas, \\"seized him by the cloak of marten-skins that he had on, drew it off over his head, and left it in his hands; whereupon, the Indians all beginning to rise, he gave him a stroke with a cutlass, that laid open his back, when they, with loud yells, came out of the houses, discharging their bows.\\" The Spaniards barely escaped from the well-fortified town. The Indians closed the gates and \\"beating their drums, they raised flags, with great shouting.\\" De Soto determined to attack the town, and in the battle that followed, Elvas records: \\"The Indians fought with so great spirit that they, many times, drove our people back out of the town. The struggle lasted so long that many Catholics, weary and very thirsty, went to drink at a pond near by, tinged with the blood of the killed, and returned to the combat.\\" De Soto had his men set fire to the town, then by Elvas's account, : \\"breaking in upon the Indians and beating them down, they fled out of the place, the cavalry and infantry driving them back through the gates, where losing the hope of escape, they fought valiantly; and the Catholics getting among them with cutlasses, they found themselves met on all sides by their strokes, when many, dashing headlong into the flaming houses, were smothered, and, heaped one upon another, burned to death. : \\"They who perished there were in all two thousand five hundred, a few more or less: of the Catholics there fell two hundred... Of the living, one hundred and fifty (150) Catholics had received seven hundred wounds...\\" Elvas noted later that four hundred hogs died in the conflagration. The exact count of the dead is not known, but Spanish accounts at the time estimated the Indian dead at between 2,500 and 3,000. This range would make the battle one of the bloodiest in recorded North American history.

He was elected following the death of King Garcia II. Like the former king, Ant√≥nio I pursued a foreign policy focused at removing the Portuguese from his region. Policy against the Portuguese Since 1620, Kongo and Portugal had been in a near-constant state of war with the only intervals coming after decisive BaKongo victories. After almost 30 years of decline in the face of BaKongo, Mbundu and Dutch military victories, the Portuguese had retaken their colonial possession in Luanda while establishing a tenuous peace with their old enemies. Feeling threatened by Portugal's return on Kongo's southern border, Ant√≥nio I sought to renew Kongo's war against the Portuguese with a new alliance similar to the one at the Battle of Kitombo. Unable to rely on the Dutch for assistance, he sent emissaries to Spain but failed to procure an alliance. He also contacted Kongo's Mbundu allies in Matamba and the semi- independent kingdoms of Dembos and Mbwila. Death at the Battle of Mbwila The Portuguese got wind of these plans and were also pressing claims to sovereignty over the small kingdom of Mbwila. When a succession dispute between Mbwila's king (supported by Kongo) and his aunt (supported by Portugal) erupted, the rivals both came with armies to settle the dispute. At the Battle of Mbwila, the BaKongo suffered their worst military defeat. This resulted in the death of hundreds, which included King Ant√≥nio had led a contingent of 400 swordsmen into the battle. King Ant√≥nio I was decapitated during or shortly after the battle (his head buried with royal honours by the Portuguese), while his crown and sceptre were taken to Portugal as trophies. Aftermath King Ant√≥nio died with no heir apparent. Many of the men who could have taken his place died or were captured at the battle, including his seven-year-old son. The ruling House of Kinlaza and the opposing House of Kimpanzu fought furiously over the throne causing a devastating civil war.

Produced by the Sci-Fi Channel, it was filmed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Plot Four electricians, Dean, Junior, Ray and Shelly (nickname for Sheldon), are sent to cut off the power in a condemned building before it's torn down. They notice there's a difference between the floor plans and the actual size of the building. Upon breaking down a door they discover an old laboratory, which encloses an atomic pile (vintage nuclear reactor) powering a weird machine in the floor. They unwittingly set off an alarm and then boot up the device. Dean falls through a dimensional portal that's created and Junior goes after him, while Ray and Shelly read a journal left behind by the scientists. Dean and Junior appear outside in a deserted and web covered Chicago. Dean goes off to have a look around, while Junior waits for the others. Shelly, by reading the journal, realizes that the researchers were attempting to make a gateway to a parallel universe and he and Ray decide to step through the portal. Finding no one on the other side of the dimensional portal, Ray and Shelly set off and get a fright when Junior leaps out. Junior leads them to a broken-down security van, with much money in the back. Junior, Ray and Shelly start celebrating, while Dean comes running back armed with a block of wood. Junior suddenly says \\"Guys\\" and steps forward with a claw in his stomach. Junior dies, and more creatures (spider people) attack the others. A group of humans save the electricians and kill the creatures. They fight more of the creatures, and head back to the portal, Dean stops to help a survivor and the portal closes leaving him trapped. On Shelly's and Ray's side, the atomic pile shorts the portal. Shelly starts trying to fix it, while Ray goes off to call for help. The survivors bring Dean into their hideout where they meet Crane. A female survivor, Elayna, insists that Dean come with them to see \\"The Old Man\\". She blindfolds him and they set out for the base. Meanwhile, Ray comes back saying that everyone thinks he's insane and refused to send anyone. He did however come back with a small arsenal of guns. Dean meets the Old Man, who is revealed to be Dr. Richard Moreli, the inventor of the portal who got stranded here 30 years ago. Dean tells him his friends are on the other side and trying to fix it. Dr. Moreli tells him when he opened the portal 30 years ago, it let in giant evil Spider Queens into this parallel Earth, who set out to enslave and devour most of humankind. Mankind held out for a while until the ammunition gave out. Elayna says the \\"soldiers\\" (the spider people) used to be normal people, but the Spider Queen's venom makes them completely under her control. Any survivors are made to show the soldiers where their base camp is, so that when others go out and come across these camps, they are empty and bloodstained. They leave the base, to find the Spider Queen has been watching, they hear gunshots and find Shelly and Ray. The survivors bring them back to the base, and Shelly and Moreli begin to build a new portal. The lookouts later spot \\"soldiers\\" in the building and go to hunt them down. Dean and Ray stay behind to defend Shelly and Moreli. Dean gets impatient and goes off to help, leaving Ray alone. Dean, Crane and Elayna, meet up and go back for Moreli, but find Ray with a broken leg and alone. The three set out for the Queen's lair, while Ray stays behind to build traps. They find Moreli in the food chamber, but Shelly has been bitten. Shelly grabs Dean's gun and holds it to his head, telling them to go. The four race back to the base, while Shelly comes face to face with the Queen. Shelly tries to shoot her, but he is too far gone to take the shot. Fully converted by her venom, he leads the Queen and her army back to the base, and the \\"soldiers\\" kill everyone but Crane, who kills what remains of her army save Shelly and the Queen. Crane collapses, and Moreli leaves the makeshift lab to go out to him. Crane dies in his arms, and the Queen leaps down and kills Moreli. Shelly enters the lab, turning off the power. Dean tries to get through to him, but fails and is forced to kill him. Dean and Elayna work hurriedly on the portal, and they are just about to power it up when the Queen shows up. Dean grabs the last two wires to connect, and he connects them to the Queen. The current starts moving between the two, and the Queen gets electrocuted. The portal opens and Dean and Elayna jump through. The strain on the power system causes it to explode, and the Queen to explode with it. Dean and Elayna wake up on a beach, and they share a kiss, just before the shadow of a large flying animal descends upon them, the two having apparently only made it to another alternate world and not to Dean‚Äôs original Earth. Their fate is left to the imagination.

O'Malley 2004 pages 115-117Michael Freze, 1993, Voices, Visions, and Apparitions, OSV Publishing page 246 She is also referred to as Mar√≠a Concepci√≥n Cabrera Arias de Armida, sometimes as Conchita Cabrera de Armida or Conchita Cabrera Arias de Armida, and often simply as Conchita. She was beatified in Mexico City on 4 May 2019, as the first Mexican laywoman to receive this recognition.https://www.milenio.com/politica/comunidad/beatifican-a- concepcion-cabrera-la-primera-laica-mexicana  Life  She was born to Octaviano Cabrera Lacavex and Clara Arias Rivera, who had a respectable but not lavish family life. Although she recalled having frequently disobeyed her parents as a child, she showed a special love for the Holy Eucharist from an early age. In 1884 she married Francisco Armida, with whom she had nine children between 1885 and 1899. In 1901, when she was 39 years old, her husband died and she had to care for her children,Ellsberg, Robert. \\"Venerable Concepci√≥n Cabrera de Armida\\". Blessed Among Us: Day by Day with Saintly Witnesses, Liturgical Press, 2016, , p. 128 the youngest of whom was two years old. Her life as a widow was not made any easier by the fact that the Mexican Revolution raged from 1910 to 1921, taking the lives of 900,000 of Mexico's population of 15 million. Yet her writings reflect an amazing tranquility amid the chaos that surrounded her. As a mystic, she reported that she heard God telling her: \\"Ask me for a long suffering life and to write a lot... That's your mission on earth\\". She never claimed direct visions of Jesus and Mary but spoke of Jesus through her prayers and meditations. Her spiritual life started before the death of her husband. In 1894 she took \\"spiritual nuptials\\" and in 1896 wrote in her diary: \\"In truth, after I touched God and had an imperfect notion of His Being, I wanted to prostrate myself, my forehead and my heart, in the dust and never get up again.\\" During her life her writings were examined by the Catholic Church in Mexico and even during her pilgrimage to Rome in 1913 during which she had an audience with Pope Pius X. Church authorities looked favorably upon her writings. Her writings were widely distributed and inspired the establishment of the \\"Works of the Cross\\" in Mexico: * Apostleship of the Cross founded in 1895, * Congregation of Sisters of the Cross of the Sacred Heart of Jesus founded in 1897, * Covenant of Love with the Heart of Jesus founded in 1909, * The Fraternity of Christ the Priest founded in 1912, and * The Congregation of Missionaries of the Holy Spirit founded in 1914. These works continue today.  Writings  Her children report that they hardly ever saw her in the process of writing, but her religious writings and meditations total over 60,000 handwritten pages. The length of her religious writings thus approaches that of Saint Thomas Aquinas. As a laywoman, she often aimed to show her readers how to love the Catholic Church. She wrote: > To love the Church is not to criticize her, not to destroy her, not to try > to change her essential structures, not to reduce her to humanism, > horizontalism and to the simple service of a human liberation. To love the > Church is to cooperate with the work of Redemption by the Cross and in this > way obtain the grace of the Holy Spirit come to renew the face of this poor > earth, conducting it to its consummation in the design of the Father's > immense love. In Seasons of the Soul she viewed the maturation of spiritual life as an ongoing process through the various seasons until the soul has fulfilled its purpose on earth. It discusses how the Holy Spirit is at work gradually transforming the soul through its seasons in the image and likeness of Jesus. The book A Mother's Letters reflects the fact that she was not a cloistered mystic but a busy mother with nine children and a widow during a turbulent time in Mexico's political history. The letters provide a glimpse of her warm, human side as she communicates with her family. Her other books include: To My Priests, Holy Hours, Before the Altar, You Belong to the Church and Irresistibly Drawn to the Eucharist. \\"I Am\\": Eucharistic Meditations on the Gospel \\"I Am\\": Eucharistic Meditations on the Gospel is a book of meditations written in 1912 by Conchita, the result of meditations during Eucharistic adoration.Joshua Footman The Esoteric Codex: Roman Catholic Mystics 2015 1329605985- - Page 7 \\"Her book I Am: Eucharistic Meditations on the Gospel, was the results of meditations during Eucharistic adoration\\" It aims to clarify the words with which Jesus defines Who He is in a variety of statements beginning with the words: \\"I am\\". Her writings aim to clarify the words with which Jesus defines who he is in a variety of statements beginning with the words: \\"I am\\". The book thus aims to lead the reader to a better understanding of the mystery of Jesus Christ. These 31 meditations were originally published in 2001. They were inspired by a wide range of Gospel passages in which Jesus explains who he is in a variety of statements beginning with the words \\"I am\\". Death Conchita died on March 3, 1937, at the age of 74 and is buried at the Church of San Jos√© del Altillo in Mexico City. She had lived a multi-faceted life, being a mother, a widow, a mystic and a writer. Of herself she wrote: > I carry within me three lives, all very strong: family life with its > multiple sorrows of a thousand kinds, that is, the life of a mother; the > life of the Works of the Cross with all its sorrows and weight, which at > times crushes me until I have no strength left; and the life of the spirit > or interior life, which is the heaviest of all, with its highs and lows, its > tempests and struggles, its light and darkness. Blessed be God for > everything!  Beatification  Her canonization process was started in 1959 by the Archbishop of Mexico City, at which time about 200 volumes of her writings were submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints to be assessed. Pope John Paul II declared her as Venerable on December 20, 1999, and he began the process of beatification. Pope Francis confirmed a miracle attributed to her intercession on 8 June 2018 (paving the way for her to be formally beatified), and Cabrera was beatified on 4 May 2019 in a ceremony which was held Mexico City at the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNjMl_cYQ5M&list;=PLLGkgDIwI4IYS1CzMmR1bBSYAm69Rj5DC&index;=4&t;=0s She is also the first Mexican lay woman to be beatified.https://www.aciprensa.com/noticias/beatifican-a-concepcion-cabrera- la-primera-laica-mexicana-que-llega-a-los-altares-40950She See also * Maria Candida of the Eucharist * I AM (book) *Our Lady of Medjugorje *Josefa Menendez *Faustina Kowalska *Marguerite Bays *Anne Catherine Emmerich *Maria Valtorta *Ottavio Michelini Notes Sources and external links * Spanish Wikipedia * Conchita: A Mother's Spiritual Diary * Work of the Cross * Blessed Concepcion Cabrera * I Am: Eucharistic Meditations on the Gospel * Seasons of the Soul * Video about Cabrera de Armida at Museum House * \\"I Am\\" at AlbaHouse Category:1861 births Category:1937 deaths Category:People from San Luis Potos√≠ Category:Catholic laity Category:Roman Catholic mystics Category:19th-century venerated Christians Category:20th-century venerated Christians Category:Beatifications by Pope Francis Category:Mexican beatified people Category:Mexican Christian mystics Category:19th-century Christian mystics Category:20th-century Christian mystics Category:Venerated Catholics by Pope John Paul II Category:19th-century Mexican women writers Category:19th-century Mexican writers Category:20th-century Mexican women writers Category:20th- century Mexican writers ","title":"Concepci√≥n Cabrera de Armida"},{"id":"11682017","text":"The Mid-Delaware Bridge, sometimes known as the Port Jervis-Matamoras Bridge or the Fourth Barrett Bridge, is a continuous truss bridge which carries U.S. Routes 6 and 209 across that river between those two communities and thus the states of New York and Pennsylvania.

It began in the mid-19th century, when the local Milford and Matamoras Railroad settled a dispute with the larger, growing Erie Railroad with the latter's assent to a law requiring that it construct a bridge across the Delaware at Matamoras that could carry both road and rail traffic. It was supposed to have been completed by 1852, but due to the railroad's unsuccessful efforts to have the law requiring the bridge declared unconstitutional it only began building it that year. It was finished in 1854.Ehrenreich, Thomas; 2001; \\"The story of a little railroad and a big bridge; Railroad Extra; retrieved from catskillarchive.com June 9, 2007. In 1870 that bridge was destroyed in a storm. Directors of the Milford and Matamoras confronted Jay Gould about this in New York when the Erie showed no apparent interest in immediately rebuilding it. He told them the railroad had sold its interest in the bridge to another company, which turned out to be a dummy corporation. A new railroad bridge was built upstream Port Jervis businessmen led by Charles St. John frustrated by the delays formed the Barrett Bridge Company to build a suspension bridge designed by John A. Roebling. The bridge which had two spans of opened in 1872. In March 1875 an ice dam on the Delaware upstream broke and in the ensuing flood, it took out the newly built railroad bridge above the Barrett Bridge. The rail bridge then took out sections of the Barrett Bridge which floated downstream but were relatively undamaged. They were carted back and reassembled within a few weeks.The Wreck of the Barrett Bridge at Port Jervis - New York Times - March 21, 1875The Port Jervis Flood - New York Times - March 18, 1875 It lasted until its destruction in the severe flood of October 1903.Denenberg, David; 1872 Barrett; retrieved from bridgemeister.com June 9, 2007. A new Barrett Bridge was built shortly thereafter, using a design similar to the current bridge. In 1922 it was taken over by the new Joint Interstate Bridge Commission set up by the two states to manage their Delaware River bridges; tolls were eliminated. The Barrett Bridge lasted until October 18, 1939, when a new bridge crossing the span was completed. Two lanes of the new bridge opened on October 9. Demolition of the old bridge began that same day and lasted through November 26. It would be the only crossing in the area until Interstate 84 was completed in the 1960s with a bridge less than a mile downstream. The Mid-Delaware has proven hardier than its predecessors, standing firm through the post-hurricane flooding in 1955.

Initially, Hertfordshire Chorus was known as the Hatfield Philharmonic Chorus which, with the Hatfield Philharmonic Orchestra, was conducted by Frank Shipway who was instrumental in founding the Hatfield Philharmonic Society, of which it was a part. Michael Kibblewhite was appointed chorus master in 1973 and, in 1977, Shipway, musical director of the orchestra, moved on. The Society appointed Howard Burrell to conduct the orchestra alongside Kibblewhite's choir. The two groups later split, with the orchestra remaining as the Hatfield Philharmonic Society and the chorus becoming independent. Michael Kibblewhite became the Musical Director and conductor of the new chorus, bringing in professional orchestras for concerts, a trend continued today. David Temple replaced Michael Kibblewhite as Musical Director in September 2000 and Charles Andrews is their accompanist. The choir has performed in venues across the United Kingdom and Europe, including the Royal Albert Hall, the Royal Festival Hall and The Sage Gateshead. Hertfordshire Chorus is renowned for its innovative programming, frequently involving commissions such as \\"Mass in Blue\\" and \\"Ode to a Nightingale\\" by Will Todd, \\"Ice\\" by Orlando Gough, \\"Solaris\\" by Steve Block and \\"Codebreaker\\" by James McCarthy. The choir recorded \\"Ode to a Nightingale\\" and Codebreaker\\", with the BBC Concert Orchestra in 2017, released on Signum Records in October 2017. Hertfordshire Chorus regularly supply choirs to sing at weddings and funerals in the Hertfordshire area. Recently, with an influx of new, younger members, the choir has branched out, with singers providing vocal support for Ray Davies in live gigs and his The Kinks Choral Collection album, Andrea Bocelli, Goldfrapp, Bombay Bicycle Club, Noel Gallagher, Faryl Smith and singing the lead track \\"Zadok the Priest\\" on the album Pride of the Nation by the Band of the Coldstream Guards. Hertfordshire Chorus have also provided singers for TV shows including BBC's The Choir and The One Show. It performed Faur√©'s Requiem mass and several other pieces on BBC Radio 2's Good Friday show: \\"At the foot of the cross\\", recorded live in St Albans Cathedral, and has been broadcast many times on BBC Radio and Classic FM.

Cormorant was launched 5 February 1919 by Todd Shipbuilding Corp., New York City; sponsored by Miss M. E. Vellaire; and commissioned 15 May 1919, Lieutenant J. R. McKean in command.  North Sea mine clearance  Based on Kirkwall in the Orkney Islands, Cormorant joined in the dangerous and exacting task of clearing the North Sea minefields between 22 August 1919 and 1 October. On towing duty, she called at Devonport, Brest, Lisbon, Ponta del Gada, Azores, and Bermuda before returning to Staten Island 19 November 1919 for the Fleet Review in the North River.  U.S. East Coast operations  For the next year and a half, she operated along the east coast and in the Caribbean, joining in maneuvers and military simulations, as she towed targets, acted as tender, and carried mail for the Fleet. Between 23 September 1920 and 27 December 1920, she was in ordinary without a crew at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, for repairs, returning then to full commission. On 5 February 1921 Cormorant arrived at Washington, D.C., for experimental work under the Bureau of Ordnance. For the next six years she operated almost exclusively in the Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay testing mine weapons and devices, on occasion going to Newport, Rhode Island, on this duty. Early in 1927 she served for a period of two months as station ship in the Virgin Islands, but experimental mine work continued to be her primary duty. In 1928 she again served in the Virgin Islands for two months, and in 1932, was at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for a month to tow targets. Several times in 1933 she steamed to Pensacola, Florida, in connection with experimental mineplanting and sweeping. Similar duty continued through 9 December 1942. On 1 June 1942 she was reclassified AT-133.  World War II Atlantic Theatre operations  Between 18 January and 19 May 1943, Cormorant gave tug services at Guantanamo Bay to destroyers in training there, and after calling at Charleston, South Carolina, for repairs in June, sailed north to Reykjav√≠k, Iceland, for salvage duty until 13 October. On 7 December she arrived at Falmouth, England, which was to be her base during the months of training and preparation for \\"Operation Overlord\\", the invasion of Normandy. As masses of men and shipping accumulated in English ports, Cormorant gave the essential tug, towing, and salvage services that amphibious operations demand.  Supporting Operation Overlord  Reclassified ATO-133 on 15 May 1944, she put to sea from Portsmouth, England, 7 June 1944 for the newly invaded Normandy coast, and served as towing and salvage ship there, expediting the landing of the great number of men and supplies to support forces ashore, until 23 July. Cormorant towed small craft and barges between Southampton, England, and France until 28 September, then had a brief overhaul at Plymouth, England, returning to Falmouth, England, for salvage and towing duty until 12 November.  Pacific Theatre assignment  Cormorant operated between Plymouth, England, and Antwerp on towing duty until 16 January 1945, and returned to New York in convoy 28 February. After overhaul at Norfolk, Virginia, she cleared for the Pacific theater, arriving at San Pedro, California, 24 June. On towing duty, she proceeded to Guam where she served as torpedo recovery ship between 6 September and 12 December.  Post-War decommissioning  Returning to San Pedro, California, 24 January, Cormorant was decommissioned 29 March 1946, and sold on 8 January 1947.  Awards  Cormorant received one battle star for World War II service.

Nathan, (November 8Professor and Poet ‚ÄòLoved To Play With the Language‚Äô obituary from the Daily Californian 1924 - June 3, 2007) was an American poet, critic, and professor emeritus of rhetoric at the University of California, Berkeley where he retired in 1991. Born in El Monte, California, Nathan earned a bachelor's degree in English at UC Berkeley in 1950, a master's degree in English in 1952 and a Ph.D. in 1961. He was then hired as a lecturer in UC Berkeley's Department of Speech, and was promoted to associate professor in 1965 and to professor in 1968. Among other honors, he received the National Institute of Arts and Letters prize for poetry, a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Phelan Award for Narrative Poetry, and three silver medals from the Commonwealth Club of California, including one for The Potato Eaters. His poems were also published in The New Yorker, The Atlantic, New England Review and The Georgia Review, among other publications.Leonard Nathan, distinguished poet, dies at 82 obituary/press release from UC Berkeley news website Overview The author of 17 volumes of poetry, Nathan has been described as \\"a fixture for 50 years in literary circles both on and off the UC Berkeley campus.\\" Ted Kooser, a recent U.S. poet laureate and an English professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, counted Nathan among his mentors, particularly for his \\"economy of words.\\" \\"He was among the finest poets of his generation and will be missed by all of us who practice the art\\", said Kooser, who struck up a correspondence with Nathan in the 1970s after complimenting Nathan on a poem he had seen in a magazine. Nathan's first book of poems, Western Reaches, brims with images of the California landscape. After a year in India, he published a book about his experiences there titled, The Likeness: Poems out of India. That same year, Princeton University Press published Nathan's Returning Your Call, which was nominated for a National Book Award. His prose included Diary of a Left-Handed Bird Watcher and The Poet's Work, an Introduction to Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz.

The film is set in Naples, where Luca Di Angelo (Fabio Testi) and his brother Michele use speedboats to smuggle cigarettes, and find themselves between two contraband bosses after they lose a load of cigarettes. The film's story was changed to include additional scenes of violence and to better pace the plot. On the second week of a ten-week shooting schedule, the production exhausted its budget and received funding from real life smugglers in Naples. The smugglers also made changes to the plot and title of the film. Plot Luca Di Angelo (Fabio Testi) is a smuggler, one member of an organized team trafficking cigarettes and booze up and down the coast off Naples, Italy. After a run-in with the police in which the smugglers manage to get away by faking a boat explosion resulting in the police motorboats responding to the false emergency, Luca and his brother Mickey suspect Scherino (Ferdinand Murolo), the head of a rival gang of smugglers, of passing on their actives. Lucia and Mickey take their accusations to their boss Perlante (Saverio Marconi) a sleazy playboy withy numerous Mafia connections, who agrees to look into it. After a nighttime fire at Mickey's racing stables kills a valued racehorse, he and Luca drive over to inspect the damage. But on the way, they are stopped at a fake police roadblock where the assassins dressed as policemen trick Mickey into getting out of the car and machine-gun him to death over and over again (a homage to Sonny Corelone's death scene in The Godfather), while Luca barely escapes injury by hiding on the floor of the car. Afterwards, Perlante suggests that Luca leave town for a few days, but he refuses. After his brother's funeral, conducted on the gang's speedboats in the Bay of Naples, with the police surveying them, Luca vows revenge. Despite his wife Adele's (Ivana Monti) pleas, Luca goes after the prime suspect: Scherino. That night, Luca breaks into Scherino's house, but gets spotted and severely beaten up by Scherino's henchmen. However, Scherino spares Luca's life. He tells Luca that he had no part in Mickey's killing. After Luca recovers from his injuries thanks to a local doctor named Charlie (Giordano Falzoni) who treats injuries for large bribes of cash, Luca meets with an informant who gives him a tip to who ordered the hit on Mickey. Traveling to a derelict fishing boat in the marina where a hood is making a drug pick-up, Luca tortures him for information about his boss, whom Luca learns is a Frenchman called Francois Jacios, aka: The Marsigliese. Luca calls Perlante, who tells him more about the vicious gangster, and who is muscling into Italian organized crime to deal in hard drugs. At his hideout in Naples, the Marsigliese (Marcel Bozzufi) is meeting Ingrid, a German drug courier from Frankfurt wanting to sell him some heroin. When the Marsigliese sees that the heroin is 'cut', he has her face horribly burned by a blowtorch while he watches with sadistic satisfaction. Over the course of one day, the Marsigliese orders a series of shootings of all the rival Mafia Dons all over Naples as part of his plan to become the sole kingpin of Naples. Perlante barely escapes an attempt on his life when his right-hand man Alfredo (Giulio Farnese) triggers a bomb which has been hidden under Perlante's bed, killing Alfredo and Perlante's mistress. Perlante calls Luca and tells him about the series of hits. He sets up a meeting between them and the Marsigliese at the local soccer stadium where the Frenchman discusses merging their criminal concerns. Afterwards, Luca meets with his fellow smugglers and persuades them not to accept the Marsigliese demands for the inflow of drugs into their community would only escalate the number of addicts and drug-overdoses, plus they would not receive any profits since the Marsigliese would keep most of the money for himself and his close associates. In response to the Mafia killings, the Naples police chief (Fabio Jovine) orders Captain Tarantino (Venantino Verantini) to conduct a massive sweep of the Neapolitan bay area to clean it up of crime. The dragnet has many smugglers arrested. Luca is saved from a police raid on his house by, of all people, Scherino, who suggests they form an alliance to defeat the Marsiglise. They meet that night at Perlante's house to discuss their plans with him. But Luca soon smells the tell-tale odor of the Marsiglieses personal parfum in the room. Luca realizes that Perlante is in league with the Marsgliese just as the gangster and his henchmen burst into the room and kill all of Scherino's henchmen as well as mortally wound Scherino himself. Luca's split-second reflexes of diving out a glass window and running away from the house ensures his escape. The mortally wounded Scherino manages to shoot off one shot from his gun at the traitorous Perlante, hitting him in the neck, before he drops dead himself. The Marsigliese abducts Luca's wife, Adale, and again insists that Luca should turn over the smuggling network over to his drug operation. To help Luca make up his mind, the sound of Adale being beaten and gang-raped are relayed to Luca over the phone. Luca agrees to the Marsigliese demands. In desperation, Luca calls upon the elderly Don Morrone (Guido Alberti), the leader of the old-guard Italian Mafia who has been reading the news throughout the movie of the numerous killings. Morrone is happy to come out of semi-retirement to deal with the French sadist. Morrone relays his plans to his various middle-aged associates who swing back into action for their cause. The following morning, a meeting occurs between Luca and the Marsigliese in a local open square where the handover to Adele is taking place. Luca sees that it is indeed a set up to have him killed. Don Morrone and his men, using a series of hit-and-run attacks, appear and blast away all of the Marsigliese's henchmen. Luca then chases the crazed Marsigliese through the deserted streets and allyways where after the Frenchman runs down an alley which is a dead end, Luca catches up to him and shoots the Marsigliese dead who lands on a pile of garbage bags. Across town, the police raid the Marsigliese hideout where they find the traumatized Adele and a large stash of cocaine and heroin, while the rest of the Marsigliese henchmen surrender. The final scene has Captain Tarantino meeting with Don Morrone and his housekeeper at a wharf marketplace where the policeman thanks the elderly Mafia don for his tip leading to the discovery of the Marsigliese hideout and drug shipment seizure. But when Tarantino asks Morrone about the murder of the Marsigliese and his men, Morrone claims to know nothing about it, and also not to know Luca Di Angelo. From Tarantino's sarcastic tone of voice, he knows that Morrone is lying. But out of sympathy, the policeman lets Morrone go without arresting him. Production Lucio Fulci and Giorgio Mariuzzo co-wrote the script for Contraband based on an original story by Ettore Sanz√≤ and Gianni De Chiara with a working title of Il contrabbandiere / Violenza. Mariuzzo has stated the story initially started with producer Sandro Infascelli, but found the story did not work and called in Mariuzzo to re-shape it. Mariuzzo re-structured the script to change its pace and added a more scenes of violence. Filming began on Contraband on 3 December 1979. The film was shot in 11 weeks within the De Paolis Studios in Rome and in Naples. Within the first two weeks of filming at De Paolis Studios the production had run out of money. Moving the production to Naples, local smugglers lent themselves to the production of the film as extras and let the crew use their motorboats for some scenes. The smugglers also changed parts of the script by including lines against drug trafficking and to drop the term Violenza (Violence) from the title. Among the smugglers was Giuseppe Grecco, the son of Sicilian Mafia member Michele Greco. Giuseppe Grecco would ask Fulci technical questions about filming and would later direct films in the 1990s. Filming ended in March 1980.

Its Quechua name means \\"great river\\". The word \\"Mantaro\\" may be a word originally from the Ashaninka language, who live downstream along the Ene River. The Mantaro, along with the Apurimac River, are the sources of the Amazon River, depending on the criteria used for definition. Geography The river nominally has its source at Lake Junin, but tributaries above Lake Junin extend as much as 70 km farther upstream, for a total length of 809 km. The named tributaries of the river are the Cunas which enters the Mantaro at regional capital Huancayo, and the Kachimayu which flows near the city of Ayacucho. The upper Mantaro is 432 km long extending from Lake Junin to the Kachimayu inflow while the lower river shown on the map is 307 km long. The river runs through the provinces Jun√≠n, Yauli, Jauja, Concepci√≥n and Huancayo in the Jun√≠n Region, then through the Huancavelica Region and the Ayacucho Region. The river then returns to the Jun√≠n Region in Satipo Province, where it unites with the Apurimac River to form the Ene River. Its hydrographic basin also includes some of the Pasco Region. The river belongs to the hydrographic basin of the Amazon River. Its principal tributaries are the Cunas River, the Vilca/Moya River, the Ichhu River, and the Kachimayu. The Mantaro River in Junin region. The river runs generally southeast through south-central Peru. Its source, Lake Junin is 4,082.7 m in elevation, while its mouth lies at a mere 440m above sea level. This gives the river an incredibly steep gradient of nearly 5m/km, sufficient to carve the impressive Mantaro Valley. This valley is the most important food source for the capital Lima. The Mantaro Hydroelectric Complex is located in the Tayacaja Province of the Huancavelica Region, and produces 31% of all electrical energy generated in Peru. The first complete paddling descent of the river from the source was accomplished by Rocky Contos and James Duesenberry in May 2012. Previously, the lower 140 km of the river were descended in kayak and later cataraft by Richard Pethigal in 2002. The lower section of the river is known for Sendero Luminoso camps. Source of the Amazon In 1971, an expedition led by the National Geographic Society cited the Apur√≠mac River as the designated headwaters of the Amazon River, with a follow-up expedition in 2000 confirming the connected Lake Ticlla Cocha as the furthest upstream Amazon extension. The definition for the distinction used at the time of survey was based on absolute length which the tributary added to the river, given a continuous and year-round flow of water. With the Tablachaca Dam built in 1974, a portion of the Mantaro River suffers a dry spell for five months of the year, previously excluding it from the list of source eligibility. However, research published in 2014 challenged this existing definition, and used advanced imaging and topographic data to establish the Mantaro as the true longest upstream source feeding into the Amazon Basin. The new measurements add approximately 75‚Äì92 km to the original Amazon River length.

Its climate has been recorded as one of the hottest places in the world, with temperatures reaching 53.5 ¬∞C (128.3 ¬∞F) on 26 May 2010. The town is surrounded by fertile agriculture land, which is irrigated by water from the Dadu canal. The local people have limited access to potable drinking water. The farming of livestock is common in Dadu, especially in Kachho, an area largely inaccessible due to the lack of a good road infrastructure. Paat, has a mainline railway station named Piyaro Goth. History Paat is close to Sehwan, an ancient city of the Indus Valley Civilization. A mound known as Lohum Jo Daro near the Piyaro Goth railway station was first discovered in 1925, and subsequently excavated by the archaeologist Majumdar. He recovered several objects typical of Indus culture along with pottery from the Mohenjo Daro period. There is evidence that the conditions in Baluchistan and Sindh five thousand years ago were more favourable for human habitation than they are today. There are various views about the origin of the town and the popular one is that it was initially called 'Patar' after the maharaja who built it. Patar in Persian means the crown. Hence, it is envisaged that either it was important to the crown or else it is so named after its shape being like a crown. In 1785 the river changed its course and the town had to shift on the other bank leaving 'old paat' and constructing 'new paat'. Lal Shahbaz Qalander of Sehwan (1177‚Äì1274) visited Paat between 1196 and 1224 and met a Sufi nobleman there named Pir Haji Ismail. The two contemporaries became friends and often met to exchange ideas on religious preaching, tolerance, and cohesion among their communities. A shrine to Pir Haji Ismail was subsequently built in Paat, and is still regularly visited today. In view of the links with Lal Shahbaz Qalandar and the services rendered by the locals to the spread of the Sufism and religion, it was bestowed the title of 'Paat Shareef' to honour the town. In the sixteenth century, the Mughal Emperor Humayun fled to Sindh after his defeat by Sher Shah Suri. He met and fell in love with Hamida Banu, daughter of Shaikh Ali Akbar Jami, a Persian Shia and a friend and preceptor to Mirza Hindal, the youngest son of first Mughal Emperor and Humayun's father Babur, and married her at Paat in 1541. She gave birth to Akbar, who went on to become the next Emperor. Also the wedding of Humayun's brother Kamran who married the daughter of emperor of Sindh, Shah Arghun, was held in Paat. Hyder Kaloach well known as Hyder Harvi came during Arghun period from Hirat to Sindh and settled in Pat. His collection of poetry is Qasaid Hyder Kaloach if popular. In 1915, the reformist educationalist Kazi Ahmadi established, with the help of the British government, a co-educational Model School in Paat, which now bears his name. Education of girls in Sindh was a bold step in those days, and met with a lot of opposition. The school has since been completely rebuilt by the government of Sindh, who have managed it since Pakistan's independence. Current status Most of the original residents belonging to the sayed, Ansari, Junejo, Memon, Siddiqui, Kazi, Bhatti, Soomro, Mangi, Palh and Channa families have settled in Karachi, and those remaining in Paat suffer under poor economic conditions and low living standards.

Located in the western Negev desert, adjacent to the Egyptian border, it falls under the jurisdiction of Ramat Negev Regional Council. In it had a population of . Early history Ancient Nitzana was founded by the Nabataeans in the 3rd century BC. There are traces of a large first century BC building with a monumental staircase. The settlement was a trading post on the Eilat to Gaza route. In the early 2nd century AD the emperor Hadrian diverted this trade from Elat to Damascus. Despite this loss Nitzana grew under Byzantine rule. In the late 3rd century AD the fort was enlarged with stables for horses and camels. In the 4th century a church was built attached to the north end of the fort. It was dedicated to SS Sergius and Baccus. In the 7th century a second church, dedicated to the Virgin Mary was built 60m south east of the fort. Remnants of the Turkish railway station. At the far left: the water stop. The tax register for 587-9 AD indicates that the town had 1,500 inhabitants, with 116 houses. This was a time of prosperity with the route from Gaza to Elat reopened and pilgrim traffic to Saint Catherine's Monastery. A find of late Byzantine papyri has given much detail of the life of the town. Following the arrival of Islam the town went into a slow decline and by the 8th century it had ceased to exist.Murphy-O'Conner, Jerome (2008) The Holy Land.

The modern village was founded in 1987 by Aryeh Eliav, a former member of the Knesset for several left-wing parties, and was named after the Nabatean city. It also gives its name to the Nitzana Border Crossing, formerly Auja al-Hafir. It was the site of Operation Volcano in 1955, an Israeli raid against Egyptian positions.

Recorded during 1965, it was released in January 1967 as Impulse! A-9106 (AS-9106 for the stereo version), and was the last album released during Coltrane's lifetime. Background The tracks on Kulu S√© Mama were pieced together from three different recording sessions in 1965. The ballad \\"Welcome\\" was recorded by Coltrane's \\"classic quartet\\" on June 10 at Van Gelder Studio in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, in a session which also produced \\"Last Blues\\" (released in 1998 on Living Space) and \\"Untitled 90314\\" (released in 1978 on Feelin' Good and in 1998 on Living Space) as well as \\"Transition\\" and \\"Suite\\" (released in 1970 on Transition). \\"Welcome\\" was also reissued on the 1993 CD release of Transition. Coltrane explained that \\"Welcome\\" \\"is that feeling you have when you finally do reach an awareness, an understanding which you have earned through struggle. It is a feeling of peace. A welcome feeling of peace.\\" On June 16, the quartet visited Van Gelder Studios for a recording session which yielded \\"Vigil\\" and the two versions of \\"Dusk Dawn\\" which appear as bonus tracks on the CD reissue of Kulu S√© Mama. (The longer version of \\"Dusk Dawn\\" was first released on Living Space.) The session also yielded the tracks \\"Untitled 90320\\" (released on Feelin' Good) and \\"Living Space\\" (released on Feelin' Good, Living Space, and, in a version with overdubbings arranged by Alice Coltrane, on Infinity). According to Coltrane, \\"Vigil\\" \\"implies watchfulness. Anyone trying to attain perfection is faced with various obstacles in life which tend to sidetrack him. Here, therefore, I mean watchfulness against elements that might be destructive - from within or without.\\" He added: \\"I don't try to set standards of perfection of anyone else. I do feel everyone does try to reach his better self, his full potential, and what that consists of depends on each individual. Whatever that goal is, moving toward it does require vigilance.\\" Over the coming months, Coltrane's music continued to evolve at a rapid pace, and he recorded a slew of albums (Ascension, New Thing at Newport, Sun Ship, First Meditations (for quartet), Live in Seattle, Om). By the time of the October 14 session at Western Recorders in Los Angeles, scheduled during an eleven day stint at the It Club, Coltrane had added tenor saxophonist Pharoah Sanders and multi- instrumentalist Donald Rafael Garrett (both of whom had appeared on Live in Seattle and Om), as well as drummer Frank Butler and vocalist and percussionist Juno Lewis. Togther they recorded \\"Kulu S√© Mama (Juno S√© Mama)\\" and \\"Selflessness\\". The latter appeared as a bonus track on the CD reissue of Kulu S√© Mama, and had previously appeared on Selflessness: Featuring My Favorite Things, released in 1969. Both tracks were reissued in 1992 on the compilation The Major Works of John Coltrane. The track \\"Kulu S√© Mama (Juno S√© Mama)\\" was written by Juno Lewis, who had met Coltrane through a mutual friend four days prior to the recording session. Lewis (1931-2002) was a drummer, drum maker, singer, and composer based in Los Angeles. According to Jon Thurber of the Los Angeles Times, Lewis \\"showed Coltrane his long work, 'Kulu Se Mama,' a lengthy autobiographical poem that reflected his pride in his ancestors and strong sense of tradition... Coltrane invited Mr. Lewis into a Los Angeles studio to join Coltrane's regular band\\" for the recording session. \\"Kulu S√© Mama (Juno S√© Mama)\\" marked Lewis' first appearance on a recording. He sang in \\"an Afro-Creole dialect he cites as Entobes\\" and played \\"Juolulu, water drums, the Dome Dahka, and... bells and a conch shell.\\" Lewis also played percussion on \\"Selflessness\\". Reception Scott Yanow of AllMusic commented \\"Lewis' chanting and colorful percussion make this a unique if not essential entry in Coltrane's discography.\\" All About Jazz reviewer Chris May referred to Kulu S√© Mama as \\"a vibrant and accessible album\\" and stated that if the title track \\"had been created in the 2000s, 'Kulu Se Mama' might be labeled groove or even jam band music.\\" May also wrote: \\"Kulu S√© Mama is essential listening for anyone interested in the immediate pre-history of astral jazz.\\" In his album liner notes, Nat Hentoff described the title track as \\"an absorbing, almost trance-like fusion of tenderness and strength, memory and pride. And fitting its ritual nature, the singing and much of the playing by the horns have the cadences of a chant.\\" Hentoff concludes the notes by stating: \\"in Coltrane's view of man in the world, there are always further stages to work your way toward. The striving is ceaseless. It is not striving in competition with others, but rather a striving within the self to discover how much more aware one can become.\\" Influence A version of \\"Welcome\\" appears on the 1973 Santana album titled Welcome. The album was made shortly after Carlos Santana met Alice Coltrane, with whom he would later record, for the first time. Santana stated: \\"At that time, I felt my whole existence pulled toward John Coltrane.\\" Track listing Personnel * John Coltrane -- tenor saxophone * Pharoah Sanders -- tenor saxophone, percussion (tracks 1, 4) * McCoy Tyner -- piano (#1, 3-6) * Jimmy Garrison -- double bass (#1, 3-6) * Donald Rafael Garrett -- clarinet, double bass, percussion (#1, 4) * Frank Butler --drums, vocals (#1, 4) * Elvin Jones -- drums * Juno Lewis -- vocals, percussion, conch shell, hand drums (#1, 4) Notes  References  External links *[ All-Music entry] Category:1967 albums Category:John Coltrane albums Category:Impulse!

In 1950 he formed Jennings Musical Instruments (JMI) Ltd, the company that produced the famous Vox Guitar amplifiers. In 1956 the company name was changed to Jennings Musical Industries Ltd. Disenchanted with the company direction, he left JMI Ltd in 1967 and set up a separate company, Jennings Electronic Industries. Biography Jennings was born in Hackney, London, England on 28 February 1917. He became an accomplished amateur accordion player. He served with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers during World War II, but he was discharged from the Army on medical grounds in 1942. Jennings then worked at the Vickers munitions plant in Kent. There he met amateur guitarist Dick Denney who played with a local big band. On occasion, the two played together, but not professionally. Denny also had an interest in electronics and radio technology. In 1944, Jennings started repairing accordions and trading in second hand musical instruments part-time at first. In 1946, Jennings set up his first shop in Dartford, Kent and began importing accordions and other musical instruments. He also invented new products, the first being the Univox electronic organ, which was a huge success, and not only inspired the \\"Vox\\" brand name but was the springboard for his musical instrument amplifier manufacturing empire. During the early 1950s, Jennings focused mainly on keyboards; he attempted to modify organ amplifiers for electric guitars, but had little success. Dick Denney, was also experimenting with guitar amplification and succeeded in producing a 15 watt amplifier paired with a speaker. After adding a tremolo unit, he made two more prototypes, one of which was shown to Jennings. Jennings offered Denney a job with his company, now named Jennings Musical Instruments (JMI). Denney accepted the position of engineer and further developed his prototype. In 1957 JMI launched the short- lived AC2/30, the first guitar amplifier to be branded Vox, but it was the AC/15 guitar amplifier, launched in January 1958, that made the Vox brand name world-famous. Displeased with the direction his old company was taking, Tom Jennings left JMI in 1967, roughly the same time that Marshall overtook Vox as the dominant force in the British guitar amplifier market. He set up a new company, Jennings Electronic Industries (JEI), in his old Dartford location. Later, Dick Denney joined the new company which operated for several years, making an updated and rebadged version of the AC30, along with other amplifiers and a new range of organs. Jennings died in London in 1978 at the age of 60.

It rises in the Manipur Hills of northeast India as the Barak River and flows west becoming the Surma River and then flows south as the Meghna River, a total of of which are within Bangladesh, to the Bay of Bengal. Course Barak Meghna River Basin From its source in the Manipur Hills of India, Liyai Village of Poumai tribe, the river is known as the Barak River (locally known as Avoure). Near its source, the river receives a number of tributaries, including the Irang, Makru, Tuivai, Jiri, Gumti, Howrah, Kagni, Senai Buri, Hari Mangal, Kakrai, Kurulia, Balujhuri, Shonaichhari and Durduria. It flows south through Manipur State, then southwest leaving Manipur and entering Assam State at Tipaimukh or Ruonglevaisuo after abruptly veering north a it's confluence with the Tuivai. In Assam State the Barak flows northward then west receiving many small tributaries in the Cachar Valley Assam State. It continues to flow west past the town of Silchar where it is joined by the Madhura River. After Silchar, it flows for about , and near Badarpur it divides into the Surma River and the Kushiyara River and enters Bangladesh. The principal tributaries of the Barak in India are the Irang, Makru, Tuivai, Jiri, the Dhaleshwari (Tlawng), the Singla, the Longai, the Madhura, the Sonai (Tuirial), the Rukni and the Katakhal. Surma After entering into modern Karimganj District in south Assam, Barak divides in two, with the northern branch being called the Surma River and the southern branch the Kushiyara River. At this point the river enters the Sylhet Depression (or trough) which forms the Surma Basin.Mannan, Abdul (2002) \\"Stratigraphic evolution and geochemistry of the Neogene Surma Group, Surma Basin, Sylhet, Bangladesh\\" University of Oulu, Oulu, Bangladesh, The Surma is fed by tributaries from the Meghalaya Hills to the north, and is also known as the Baulai River after it is joined by the south-flowing Someswari River. The Kushiyara receives tributaries from the Sylhet Hills and Tripura Hills to the south, the principal one from the Tripura Hills being the Manu. The Kushiyara is also known as the Kai River after it is joined by a major offshoot (distributary) from the Surma. When the Surma and the Kushiyara finally rejoin in Kishoreganj District above Bhairab Bazar, the river is known as the Meghna River. Meghna The Meghna is formed inside Bangladesh above Bhairab Bazar by the combination of the Surma and Kushiyara rivers. Down to Chandupura, Meghna is hydrographically referred to as the Upper Meghna. After the Padma joins, it is referred to as the Lower Meghna. River Meghna from the bridge over the river In Daudkandi, Comilla, Meghna is joined by the great river Gumti, created by the combination of many streams. This river reinforces Meghna a lot and increases the waterflow considerably. The pair of bridges over Meghna and Gop are two of the country's longest bridges. The name for the largest distributary of the Ganges in Bangladesh is the Padma River. When the Padma joins with the Jamuna River, the largest distributary of the Brahmaputra, and they join with the Meghna in Chandpur District, the result is the Lower Meghna. After Chandpur, with the combined flow of the Padma and Jamuna, it moves down to the Bay of Bengal in an almost straight line. In the course from Chandpur to the Bay of Bengal, the Meghna splits into a number of little rivers, but the main flow is through the Meghna Estuary. Near Bhola, just before flowing into the Bay of Bengal, the river divides into two main streams in the Ganges delta and separates an island from both sides of the mainland. The western stream is called Ilsha and the eastern one is called Bamni.

This music, therefore, is not for fans of Coltrane's earlier sheets of sound period or for those who prefer jazz as melodic background music...

The saxophonist Pharoah Sanders, whose music Coltrane admired, and who had previously recorded with Coltrane on Ascension, went to hear the group and was invited to sit in. According to Sanders, \\"[H]e told me then that he was thinking of changing the group and changing the music, to get different sounds. He asked me to play with him.\\" At the same time, the multi-instrumentalist Donald Garrett, who had played with Coltrane's group in 1961 as a second bassist, was also asked to sit in. At the end of the two-week gig, both Sanders and Garrett were asked to join the band, and accompanied it to the next engagement, September 27 - October 2, at The Penthouse in Seattle. During the stay in Seattle, Coltrane decided to document the newly-expanded group at his own expense, hiring the recording engineer Jan Kurtis for the September 30 gig. \\\\- Roughly 3¬Ω hours of music were recorded that evening and, roughly four years after Coltrane's death, four pieces, \\"Cosmos\\", \\"Out Of This World\\", \\"Evolution\\" and \\"Tapestry In Sound\\", were selected to appear on the original double LP, with \\"Out Of This World\\" and \\"Evolution\\" split over two sides. Two additional pieces, \\"Body And Soul\\" and an incomplete version of \\"Afro Blue\\", were added for the CD release, and the previously-split \\"Out Of This World\\" and \\"Evolution\\" were restored to create continuous versions. (\\"Afro Blue\\" features an alto saxophone solo by an unidentified player; it has been speculated that this may have been Carlos Ward or Joe Brazil.) Most of the remaining music recorded that evening was released on CD by Rare Live Recordings in 2011 on The Unissued Seattle Broadcast, which was created from a fan's recording of a radio broadcast, Jazz from the Penthouse on KING-FM, hosted by Jim Wilke. It contains four tracks: \\"Untitled Original\\", which ends with a bass duet that apparently precedes \\"Cosmos\\" from the original disc in terms of the actual running order; an incomplete continuation of the version of \\"Afro Blue\\" that appeared on the original CD; \\"Lush Life\\"; and an incomplete version of \\"My Favorite Things\\". The following day, October 1, Coltrane's group, along with Joe Brazil, went to Jan Kurtis's studio, Camelot Sound Studios in Lynnwood, Washington, to record Om.

The island lies immediately south of the mainland by the village of √Övik. The island essentially forms the southern part of the √Övik village harbour. The island sits about half-way between the Lindesnes peninsula to the west and the town of Mandal to the east. The fishing village is very picturesque due to its wooden houses dating back to the 1700s and 1800s. History Svin√∏r was once a very prosperous port with its own customs house. The port was a good port to protect ships in bad weather, especially near the harsh waters surrounding the Lindesnes peninsula (the Norwegian term uthavn meaning \\"exterior harbor\\"). During the early 1800s, there were over 100 residents on the small island, but by 1993, the last permanent resident left the island, leaving the island as a haven for holiday cottages that bring many residents each summer.

Early life Stevens was born at his family's estate at Castle Point in Hoboken, New Jersey on September 24, 1785. He was the eldest son of Col. John Stevens, a revolutionary war veteran, pioneer in steamboats, and purchaser of what is now Hoboken, and Rachel Cox, who was from New Brunswick, New Jersey. His brothers included Robert Livingston Stevens, a businessman and inventor, and Edwin Augustus Stevens, who founded the Stevens Institute of Technology. His paternal grandparents were John Stevens Jr., a prominent New Jersey politician who served as a delegate to the Continental Congress, and Elizabeth (n√©e Alexander) Stevens, who was the daughter of James Alexander, the Attorney General of New Jersey, and Mary (n√©e Spratt) Provoost Alexander, a prominent merchant. His aunt Mary Stevens married Robert R. Livingston, the first Chancellor of the State of New York. Career Stevens graduated from Columbia University in 1803. He ran the company that had the first steam ferry between Hoboken, New Jersey and New York City. Yachting John Cox Stevens, the sporting son in the family, built a series of yachts. In 1844, on board his yacht, Gimcrack, he was named Commodore of the New York Yacht Club which he and nine others had just proposed forming.America's Cup Hall of FameStevens Institute of Technology Stevens once served as president of The Jockey Club and set up the 1823 Great North-South Match. The race stoked sectional tensions when the Northern horse, \\"American Eclipse\\", defeated the southern colt, \\"Sir Henry\\". The northern victory encouraged a northern enthusiasm for horse racing but embarrassed southerners with their pretensions of superiority in breeding, training, and racing horses. He was also a founding member of New York's oldest gentlemen's society, the Union Club of which he served as the second president. He introduced cricket to the United States.America's Cup Acclopaedia Personal life On December 27, 1809, he was married to Maria Cambridge Livingston (1799‚Äì1865), a member of the socially prominent Livingston family. Maria was the daughter of Robert \\"Cambridge\\" Livingston and Elsie Swift Livingston and the granddaughter of Robert Livingston, the 3rd Lord of Livingston Manor. John and Maria did not have any children. During his early years, he lived at Annandale. After his marriage, they lived in a house called Red Hook, north of Poughkeepsie, New York on the Livingston Manor. During Stevens' time as a horse racer, they lived in a \\"farmhouse on Long Island, a few miles outside Brooklyn and only three miles from the Union Course.\\" In 1845, the Stevens moved to New York City, where he built a Grecian mansion, known as \\"Stevens' Palace\\", located at the corner of College Place and Murray Street and designed by prominent architect Alexander Jackson Davis. Stevens died in New York City on June 10, 1857. He was buried in the family crypt located under Christ Church in South Amboy, New Jersey.

The species inhabits a single island, Karakelang, in the Indonesian archipelago.  Taxonomy  Extinct subspecies E. h. histrio and E. h. challengeri, which may be invalid Two subspecies of the red-and-blue lory, E. h. histrio and E. h. challengeri, are thought to have become extinct due to deforestation. The former occurred in Sangihe, the latter possibly in Miangas Island. The only surviving population, living on the island of Karakelang (formerly also on other parts of the Talaud Islands), belongs to the subspecies E. h. talautensis. The taxonomic validity of the subspecies is however still uncertain.  Description  The red-and-blue lory is roughly in length, including the tail. The species is sexually monomorphic, i.e. sexes are visually alike. The beak is short, sharply curved, and bright orange. The feathers nearest the cere (the area nearest the nostrils) are bright red. The crown of the head is intense purple. The back of the head is red, and the nape of the neck is intense violet. An indigo-violet stripe runs diagonally from the cere corner to the nape of the neck. The bird's plumage is mostly bright red. The rump and lower belly are a slightly deeper red. The breast has a broad band of deep blue. Extending the color from the nape, the bird's back is a deep violet purple. Wing and tail flight feathers - rectrices and remiges - are between red and red-violet. The wing covert feathers are black and red with black tips. The leg feathers are bluish-purple. The feet are medium gray, and the claws are black. The cere is very dark gray, and the irises of the eyes are dark brown. The red-and-blue lory's voice consists of short, harsh chattering screeches. Their flight is said to be quick and straight.  Distribution and habitat  The red-and-blue lory is now confined to the Talaud Islands off northern Sulawesi, Indonesia, where almost all individuals appear to inhabit a single island (Karakelang). Further populations, some apparently introduced, disappeared during the 20th century from Sangihe, Siau and Tagulandang. The population is thought to be in rapid decline. The birds inhabit forests from sea level to about 1,500 meters above sea level. The population is only sustainable or viable on Karakelang, and their population on that island is fragmented into approximately four locations. This restricted range makes them very vulnerable to potential extinction.  Ecology  These parrots are strictly arboreal, meaning they spend their lives in the trees. They do not forage on the ground. The species eats a primarily nectar- and pollen-based diet, like most lories and lorikeets. It supplements its diet with occasional insects and fruit. The red-and-blue lory is said to be raucous and noisy in the wild, but to be silent while feeding. Mature trees are needed for nesting, and logging sometimes selectively removes these trees, which constitutes a threat to the specie's survival. Clutch size is 2 eggs, with a hatching time of 25‚Äì26 days. Outside of the breeding season, the species forms social flocks, which congregate in palm plantations. While the species is nonmigratory, they are said to fly between neighboring islands in search of food. Most lories and lorikeets have a lifespan of 10‚Äì15 years in captivity, so although the lifespan of this species is not definitively known, it can be possibly inferred from the lifespans of similar species. Very rare in commercial aviculture, successful breeding has only been reported once in the scientific literature.  Conservation  Specimen in a zoo The red-and- blue lory is currently classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN. The species is also listed as CITES Appendix I, meaning that all international trade in wild- caught individuals is prohibited. Illegal trade continues, however, with 80% of the illegally taken or 'poached' specimens being shipped to the neighboring Philippines. Threats to the population include illegal trapping for the pet trade, insecticide spraying on coconut plantations, logging or habitat degradation, and exotic Newcastle disease from escaped domestic poultry. Due to their striking appearance, these parrots have been valued as pets or cage birds in Indonesia and the Philippines since the 19th century. They have been trapped for commercial trade since that time. Only since the late 1990s did the trapping decrease. Loose enforcement of international and national laws has contributed to the decline of the species. These bird are fully protected by Indonesian law as well as CITES. Logging activities, even in their nature preserve home, also threaten the species. Population-wise, two of the three subspecies, including the nominate or definitive subspecies, are presumed extinct, and the remaining subspecies is on the decline. Only 5,500‚Äì14,000 red-and-blue lories remain in the wild.

History The former Storybook Park was sold to Durell Everding, whose family also owned Santa's Village (now Santa's Village AZoosment Park) in 1961 and renamed Adventureland. Some attractions from Storybook Park were kept, but the new owner began to focus on adding more rides to the park to attract older visitors as well. Owner Durell Everding died in 1970 and the park was run by his family until it was later purchased by Medinah Investors. The park closed in 1977 as the result of competition from newer parks; the park's rides and attractions were sold off upon the park's closing. Since the park's closing, Medinah Road on the site's east side was re-routed through part of the property. The Scottish Rite Valley of Chicago building now occupies most of the site, although aerial views show evidence of the park's trails, while urban explorers have reported finding remains of park buildings and ride foundations on the site.

It is part of the Church of Scotland's Presbytery of Europe and one of two congregations of the Church of Scotland in Switzerland, the other being the Scots Kirk in Geneva. Sunday services are in English. History In Lausanne, the very first attempts to form a Presbyterian congregation go back to 1866, but they failed after two years. Amalric-Fr√©d√©ric Buscarlet, pastor in Naples, was staying temporarily in Montreux, where he worked as a chaplain during the tourist season. In 1874, Mrs Williamina Davidson invited him to come to Lausanne, to take some weekday services. Accepting the offer, he rapidly built up a small congregation, which soon asked the Continental Committee of the Free Church of Scotland to finance a permanent clerical post. Buscarlet was named the first minister of the Scottish Church in Lausanne in 1876. The first services were held in the Mus√©e industriel, rue Chaucrau, or in the chapel of the √âglise libre des Terreaux, but very quickly Buscarlet gathered the necessary funds for the construction of a dedicated building. He engaged one of the most celebrated French architects of the period, Eug√®ne-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc (who was then working on the restoration of Lausanne Cathedral), to draw up plans for a new church. The construction was entrusted to Jules Verrey, a local architect who erected a number of other religious buildings, particularly for the Free Church of Vaud. The new church was formally dedicated to the glory of God on April 12, 1877, although it had still not been completely finished. The Rev. Buscarlet remained in post until 1907. Constructed between 1876 and 1877, the church was completed in 1879 by the addition of a small vestry on the south-eastern side of the building. Originally known as Trinity Presbyterian Church, it was renamed St Andrew‚Äôs Church, probably in 1933 following a property transfer from the United Free Church of Scotland to the Church of Scotland. The church was restored in 1953 and again in 1981-1982, then under the direction of Marcel D. Mueller, an architect of Belgian origin, and a member of the congregation. The building is of interest for its asymmetric architectural shape and its finely crafted timbered roof, both inspired by rural English and Scottish churches. In addition, its interior layout and furnishings are original: the pews, the raised central pulpit (reached by two converging staircases), the Communion table and the celebrants‚Äô seats were realised according to the designs of Viollet-le-Duc. In 1974, the building was registered in the Heritage Inventory (recensement architectural du Canton de Vaud), and in 1995 it was made a category B listed building under federal protection (Protection des Biens Culturels en cas de conflit arm√©).

The instrument was paid for by a member of the congregation, Ian Reddihough, who also designed and stitched the four large tapestries (1967-1975) adorning the walls of the church. St Andrew‚Äôs House, the church hall, was built between 1958 and 1962 after the plans of the architect Mueller.

Whalen was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He played in the American Football League for the Boston Patriots, and then in the National Football League for the Denver Broncos and Philadelphia Eagles. Whalen played college football at Boston College and was selected in the third round of the 1965 AFL Draft. He was also drafted in the fourth round of the 1965 NFL Draft by the Minnesota Vikings. Jim Whalen is the only football player to have 3 TD receptions in a college game played at Boston College Alumni Stadium and have 3 TD receptions in a professional football game played at Boston College Alumni Stadium. Jim caught 3 TD passes for the Boston Patriots in their 41‚Äì10 rout of the Miami Dolphins at BC on October 15, 1967. The Boston Red Sox were playing in the 1967 World Series and the Patriots had to play at Boston College for this game. Earlier in 1962 as a sophomore at Boston College, Whalen hauled in three touchdown receptions in a victory against Boston University. Early years James Francis \\"Jim\\" Whalen, Jr., grew up in Cambridge, Massachusetts residing on Plymouth Street. He was the son of James Francis \\"Brud\\" Whalen and Helen Whalen, n√©e Zukowski. He has one sister, Rosemary.Family sources. (Whalen's father was one of the preeminent multi-sport collegiate stars of his era, captaining the Manhattan College baseball and football teams in its sports heyday at the national level. In one of his seasons on the gridiron he averaged 9.1 yards per carry rushing, 12.7 yards per pass reception, and 45 yards per punt return and was among the leaders nationally in touchdowns scored.The Titusville (PA) Herald, November 11, 1935. He was elected into the Manhattan College Athletic Hall of Fame in 1989.) The younger Whalen was a three-sport star at Cambridge High and Latin, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a school that also produced a number of other top athletes including MLB Hall-of-Fame pitcher and 342 game winner Tim Keefe, MLB player Eddie Waitkus on whom the movie The Natural was loosely based and Olympic high jumper John Thomas. Whalen, who starred in football, baseball and ice hockey, was subsequently inducted into the Cambridge Rindge and Latin Athletic Hall of Fame. College years Overview Whalen is considered one of the finest pass catchers and all-around athletes to graduate from Boston College. At the time of his graduation after the 1964 season, Whalen was the top pass receiver in Boston College history with 73 career receptions, surpassing the total of 70 accumulated by Art Graham, who like Whalen a few years later, would go on to a stellar career with the Boston Patriots. In addition to being one of the top ends in the country, Whalen was called upon to also punt his senior season. During his tenure at BC, Whalen also lettered in baseball and ice hockey in addition to football. The 1963, 1964 and 1965 BC Eagles hockey teams won the Beanpot Tournament while the 1963 and 1965 teams each reached the national Frozen Four. Whalen was elected into the Boston College Varsity Club Hall of Fame in 1995. 1962 season Whalen started as a sophomore at Boston College recording 16 catches for 309 yards and a lofty 19.3 yards per reception. He was second on the team in touchdowns with six, trailing only Art Graham who scored seven. Boston College would finish with an 8‚Äì2 record including wins over Texas Tech, Vanderbilt and Houston. 1963 season Consensus First Team All-East selection as offensive end.Schenectady Gazette, November 29, 1963. Ranked first nationally in yards per catch (minimum of 25 catches) with an average of 20.1.USA Today College Football Encyclopedia, 1953‚Äìpresent. His 523 receiving yards on 26 catches ranked eighth nationally,only 36 yards out of the fourth position. In addition to leading BC in receiving yards, Whalen also led in receptions. Boston College finished with a 6‚Äì3 record including wins over Virginia and Vanderbilt. 1964 season Repeated as consensus First Team All-East. Joining Whalen at the offensive skill positions were Roger Staubach/Navy at QB, Milt Moran/UMass at end, and Jim Nance and Floyd Little, each of Syracuse, as backs.Gettysburg Times, November 30, 1964. After the conclusion of the 1964 season, Whalen was selected as a starter in both the East ‚Äì West Shrine Game (held in San Francisco), as well as the Senior Bowl (Mobile, Alabama). Whalen recorded 31 catches and 398 receiving yards, leading the team in both categories. He was also one of three primary punters that season leading the squad with nearly 35 yards per kick. Boston College finished 6-3 including wins over #9 ranked Syracuse and Cincinnati which would finish 8-2 that season. Against Air Force, Whalen's 4th down 30 yard touchdown reception on an Ed Foley pass snapped a 7‚Äì7 tie leading to a 13‚Äì7 win.Reading Eagle, October 25, 1964. Later that season, Whalen's 15 yard catch in the closing moments resulted in a 10‚Äì8 victory in Holy Cross coach Eddie Anderson's final game. Professional career Unlike his father, who turned down offers from both professional football and Major League Baseball,The Portsmouth Herald, June 8, 1939.The Boston Globe, July 22, 1989.The Burlington (NC) Daily Times-News, October 8, 1936. the younger Whalen decided to take his athletic talents to the professional level. Although being recruited by teams from the National Hockey League as well as from others in Major League Baseball, Whalen chose football and signed with the hometown Boston Patriots who had drafted him with the 23rd overall pick. (Note: The younger Whalen was also drafted by the Minnesota Vikings.) 1965 season Recorded 22 catches and 381 receiving yards, each of which ranked eleventh among combined AFL and NFL tight ends. On October 24, 1965, Whalen recorded his first professional 100 yard receiving game (109 yards) against the Oakland Raiders. Patriots finish the season with a 4-8-2 record. 1966 season Recorded 29 catches for 502 receiving yards ranking ninth among all tight ends in the combined AFL and NFL. His four receiving touchdowns ranked first among AFL tight ends and fourth overall trailing only John Mackey, Jerry Smith and Pete Retzlaff. On November 13, 1966, Whalen scored his first professional touchdown on a 42-yard pass reception from Babe Parilli in a 27‚Äì21 win over the Houston Oilers. He would then proceed to score three more touchdowns over the next five games. The First Team All-Pro tight ends in 1966 were Fred Arbanas (22 catches, 305 yards and 4 touchdowns) and John Mackey (50, 829 and 9). Patriots finish 8-4-2. 1967 season Recorded 39 catches for 651 yards, each ranking seventh among combined AFL and NFL tight ends. His five receiving touchdowns as a tight end ranked second in the AFL and fourth in the combined AFL and NFL. Whalen's 651 receiving yards was tops among all Patriot receivers, ahead of the 606 recorded by WR Art Graham and 502 by RB Larry Garron, and his five receiving touchdowns also topped the squad. On October 15, 1967, Whalen tied the Patriots record of three touchdowns in a single game during a 41‚Äì10 thrashing of the Miami Dolphins. The three receiving touchdowns while subsequently surpassed by WR Randy Moss on November 18, 2007, against Buffalo, is through the 2012 season still a Patriots record for tight ends. The First Team All-Pro tight ends were Billy Cannon (32, 629 and 10) and John Mackey (55, 686 and 3). Patriots finish 3‚Äì10‚Äì1. 1968 season Recorded 47 catches and seven touchdowns as a tight end, each leading the AFL and ranking second among all AFL and NFL tight ends (Jackie Smith led the NFL with 49 receptions). Whalen also piled up 718 receiving yards ranking second among AFL tight ends and fourth across the combined AFL and NFL. No other Patriot tallied more than 19 receptions or 331 yards receiving. Whalen's 87-yard pass reception on a Tom Sherman pass (October 27, 1968) against the Super Bowl- bound (and winning) New York Jets was at the time the longest play from scrimmage in Patriots history. Through the 2012 season it still remains as the longest reception by a tight end in Patriots history, and also one of the longest by a tight end in professional football history. On September 22, 1968, the Boston Patriots and New York Jets played the first professional football ever held in the state of Alabama. The Patriots at the time did not have a permanent home stadium and with a possible eye to relocation, played a \\"home game\\" at Legion Field in Birmingham, in part to capitalize on the popularity of Jets quarterback Joe Namath who played his college football at the University of Alabama. The Jets would go on to defeat the Patriots 47‚Äì31, despite Whalen's game-high 6 receptions (George Sauer led the Jets with 5 catches). After a 20‚Äì17 victory against the Denver Broncos (September 29, 1968) in which Whalen caught four balls including one for a touchdown, he was awarded a game ball by his teammates.The Boston Globe, September 30, 1968. Ironically two years later, Whalen would be playing for the Broncos. Had a career game high eight receptions against the Oakland Raiders on October 6, 1968. Also during the season, Whalen would have two multiple touchdown games in a pair of wins against the Buffalo Bills (October 20, 1968 with Mike Taliaferro at QB) and the Cincinnati Bengals (December 1, 1968 with Tom Sherman at QB). It would be over 25 years until another Patriot tight end, Ben Coates, would exceed both Whalen's receptions per scheduled game and receiving yardage per scheduled game when the former combined with QB Drew Bledsoe in 1994 to set a new NFL record for tight ends. Additionally during the 1968 season, Whalen led the Patriots in both touchdowns and total yards from scrimmage (718). This was the first of only two seasons in Patriots history through 2012 that a tight end would lead the club in yards from scrimmage‚Äîthe second coming in 1994 during Ben Coates record-setting season. Whalen is named Patriots team MVP by the 1776 Booster's Club. For his accomplishments in 1968, Whalen would be accorded First Team All-Pro, marking the first time that any Patriots receiver, tight end or otherwise, would be selected First Team All- Pro. The other All-Pro tight end that season was John Mackey (45, 644 and 5). Patriots finish 4-10. 1969 season In a season during which he was battling influenza, Whalen recorded 16 receptions for 235 yards and a touchdown in a year in which no Patriot (running backs included) caught more than 29 balls.Associated Press article appearing in multiple newspapers including the Panama City News-Herald, Panama City, Florida, April 15, 1970. On September 28, 1969, in a loss against the Oakland Raiders, Whalen scores his last touchdown as a Patriot. After the season, Whalen was traded to the Denver Broncos for another tight end, Tom Beer, who would subsequently write a book entitled Sunday's Fools about his days in football. Patriots finish 4-10. 1970 season In his first season as a Denver Bronco, Whalen records 36 receptions for 503 yards and three touchdowns ranking in the top ten in each category across all NFL tight ends. In a 24‚Äì10 victory over the Atlanta Falcons on October 18, 1970, Whalen scores his first touchdown as a Denver Bronco on an 8-yard pass from QB Pete Liske. A month later on November 22, 1970, Whalen scores his last NFL touchdown during a 31‚Äì6 win over the New Orleans Saints. The First Team All-Pro tight end is Charlie Sanders who records 40 catches, 544 receiving yards and 6 touchdowns. Placing second in the All-Pro voting for tight ends that season is Bob Trumpy (29, 480 and 2). 1971 season As a Denver Bronco, Whalen pulled in a game-high 4 passes for 53 yards in a loss to the Green Bay Packers followed by 3 more catches, and a game-high 71 yards from scrimmage the next week (October 3) in a loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. However, during that game against the Chiefs, Whalen missed a block that resulted in the game-winning touchdown, and was abruptly released by the Broncos two days later. He was then picked up by the Philadelphia Eagles, for whom he hauled in a 41-yard pass against the Washington Redskins before retiring. Historical perspective Despite playing his entire career during the shorter 14-game season and largely for teams that ranked at or near the bottom in passing, Whalen's accomplishments still compare favorably in today's offense-oriented game. He is one of only four Patriot tight ends (Russ Francis, Ben Coates and Rob Gronkowski) to string together three consecutive seasons of 500+ yards receiving (he had another with the Denver Broncos), and one of only three (Coates, Gronkowski) to record 650+ yards in back-to-back seasons. Additionally, Whalen's Patriot career yards per reception average of 16.3 ranks first among all Patriot tight ends and sixth all-time among all Patriot receivers, wide outs included (minimum of 150 career receptions). His career average of 16.0 per catch (inclusive of his time with the Denver Broncos and Philadelphia Eagles) as a tight end is outstanding and ranks in the top ten in the history of professional football (minimum of 150 receptions). Five of Whalen's 20 career touchdowns were for 40 or more yards. Whalen through 2013 still also holds Patriots tight end records for longest reception (87 yards), longest touchdown reception (87 yards) and most touchdown receptions in a single game. Furthermore, Whalen protected the ball exceptionally well, fumbling just twice in his career. Through the end of the 2010 season, only one tight end in history (Andrew Glover) had fewer career fumbles than Whalen while catching as many passes. Had a career game high of 134 yards receiving (against the Miami Dolphins in 1967), and is one of only five Patriot tight ends (Coates, Hasselbeck, Gronkowski and Hernandez) to record at least four career 100 yard receiving games. Whalen's accomplishments also compare favorably to those of his peers during his time in professional football. The All AFL Hall-Of-Fame First Team All-1960's Team tight end is Fred Arbanas. Catching passes from Hall-Of-Fame quarterback Len Dawson, Arbanas caught 198 balls for 3,101 yards, a career 15.7 yards per catch average, 34 touchdowns while fumbling 4 times in 118 games. Whalen's career line is 197 catches for 3,155 yards, a career 16.0 yards per catch average, 20 touchdowns while fumbling twice in 89 games. During his career, Whalen caught touchdown passes from Babe Parilli, Don Trull, Mike Taliferro, Tom Sherman and Pete Liske. He also lined up with Steve Tensi, Alan Pastrana, Steve Ramsey and Don Horn in the quarterback position. He was elected into the Patriots 1960s All-Decade Team.The Boston Globe, March 31, 2009.

Gale House, or simply Thomas Gale House, is a house located in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Illinois, United States. The house was designed by famous American architect Frank Lloyd Wright in 1892 and is an example of his early work. The house was designed by Wright independently while he was still employed in the architecture firm of Adler & Sullivan, run by engineer Dankmar Adler and architect, Louis Sullivan; taking outside commissions was something that Sullivan forbade. The house is significant because of what it shows about Wright's early development period. The Parker House is listed as contributing property to a U.S. federally Registered Historic District. The house was designated an Oak Park Landmark in 2002. History The Thomas H. Gale House is one of three houses along Chicago Avenue in Oak Park, two of which belong to a group known as American architect Frank Lloyd Wright's \\"Bootleg Houses\\".\\"Thomas H.

Retrieved June 9, 2007. This trio of houses, also including the Robert P. Parker House and the Walter Gale House, were designed by Wright independently while he was still employed by Adler and Sullivan. Architect Louis Sullivan loaned Wright money during the construction of his own home and studio, and Wright was working it off at the firm; independent work was forbidden by Sullivan.Lockwood, Charles (1986-06-08). \\"The houses Wright built\\".

The Thomas Gale house is especially similar to the Robert P. Parker House. In all, Wright designed at least eight \\"bootleg houses\\" moonlighting while still under contract with Sullivan. When Sullivan found out about the side projects, in late 1892 or early 1893, Wright was dismissed. The Thomas Gale House is one of at least four which still stand; sources vary as to the exact numbers. The three bootleg houses were part of a series of homes which had small differences but nearly identical plans. They include the aforementioned Walter Gale House and Parker House, the Francis Woolley House, also located in Oak Park, and the Robert G. Emmond House in La Grange, Illinois.Heinz, Thomas A. The Vision of Frank Lloyd Wright, Chartwell Books, Inc., Edison, New Jersey: 2006, pp. 55-56, (). Thomas H. Gale, a prominent Oak Park citizen, purchased six adjacent lots on Chicago Avenue from his father, Edwin, in 1891 when he married Laura Robeson. He selected Wright to design his home and construction began in July 1892 at a cost of US$3,000. During the summer of 1892, the Gales lived with Thomas Gale's parents until their home was complete at the end of the year. The next year, Thomas' brother Walter purchased the lot adjacent to the Thomas Gale House and commissioned Wright to design his home, as well; the commission was Wright's first after leaving Adler and Sullivan.Sprague, Paul E.

Architecture The design for the Thomas Gale House and the Parker House, and to some extent the Walter Gale House, were derived from the more expensive Emmond House in La Grange. The homes all feature irregular roof composition with high pitches and polygonal dormers. The Thomas Gale House reflects the style of Wright's first teacher Joseph Silsbee. Sullivan's influence can also be seen in the taut masses of the house, his philosophy of \\"geometric simplification\\" is evident in the Parker House's design. While generally cast in the Queen Anne style, the Parker House has more ample rounded forms than the common Queen Anne homes being built at the time. The small size is deceiving as the Thomas Gale House is spacious. The turret bays have walls that are more than half consisted of windows. The fireplace is set in the center of the house which allows it to heat and service two rooms, the parlor and the dining room. The side elevations of the Gale House are symmetrical but adjacent buildings are built too close for the design to be seen clearly. The house is designed in a rectangular plan and is supported by a stone foundation. The exterior is clad in wooden clapboard. The building has a high-pitched, hip roof which features polygonal dormers, a brick chimney and overhanging eaves (a feature that would later become common to Wright's Prairie style). On the northeast and southeast corners of the building are polygonal towers with conical roofs. The tower windows, arranged in horizontal bands (another common Prairie element), are a mix of casement windows and fixed windows. The current front porch replaced a non-original porch with iron railings.\\"Thomas H. Gale House,\\" (PDF), Oak Park Landmark Nomination Form, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. Retrieved June 9, 2007. The non-original porch is seen in illustrations in the architectural guide map published by the Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust. The front elevation also has a dormer with a pair of casement windows. Significance Though small in size and adorned with inexpensive detailing the Thomas Gale House, along with the Parker House, are of significance because of what they reveal about Frank Lloyd Wright's development as an architect. The house is listed as a contributing property to the Frank Lloyd Wright-Prairie School of Architecture Historic District.\\"Frank Lloyd Wright-Prairie School of Architecture Historic District,\\" Property Information Report-District listing, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency.

Retrieved June 9, 2007. At first glance, the Thomas Gale House, along with the other bootleg houses, appear to devolve from the early promise of Wright's James Charnley House by including such historical styles as Colonial Revival, Queen Anne and Dutch Colonial. However, the houses illustrate Wright's burgeoning individuality as he adapted the styles to fit his own vision. The Thomas Gale and Parker Houses in particular represent a more streamlined version of the traditional Queen Anne style design. The houses incorporate rectilinear features which would later become hallmarks of Wright's fully mature Prairie design. References *McAlester, Virginia & Lee.

Segmented regression analysis can also be performed on multivariate data by partitioning the various independent variables. Segmented regression is useful when the independent variables, clustered into different groups, exhibit different relationships between the variables in these regions. The boundaries between the segments are breakpoints. Segmented linear regression is segmented regression whereby the relations in the intervals are obtained by linear regression. Segmented linear regression, two segments 1st limb horizontal 1st limb sloping up 1st limb sloping down Segmented linear regression with two segments separated by a breakpoint can be useful to quantify an abrupt change of the response function (Yr) of a varying influential factor (x). The breakpoint can be interpreted as a critical, safe, or threshold value beyond or below which (un)desired effects occur. The breakpoint can be important in decision making Frequency and Regression Analysis.

Free download from the webpage , under nr. 20, or directly as PDF : The figures illustrate some of the results and regression types obtainable. A segmented regression analysis is based on the presence of a set of ( y, x ) data, in which y is the dependent variable and x the independent variable. The least squares method applied separately to each segment, by which the two regression lines are made to fit the data set as closely as possible while minimizing the sum of squares of the differences (SSD) between observed (y) and calculated (Yr) values of the dependent variable, results in the following two equations: * Yr = A1.x + K1 for x < BP (breakpoint) * Yr = A2.x + K2 for x > BP (breakpoint) where: :Yr is the expected (predicted) value of y for a certain value of x; :A1 and A2 are regression coefficients (indicating the slope of the line segments); :K1 and K2 are regression constants (indicating the intercept at the y-axis). The data may show many types or trends, Drainage research in farmers' fields: analysis of data. Part of project \\"Liquid Gold\\" of the International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. Download as PDF : see the figures. The method also yields two correlation coefficients (R): *R_1 ^ 2 = 1 - \\\\frac{\\\\sum (y - Y_r) ^ 2 }{ \\\\sum (y - Y_{a1})^2} for x < BP (breakpoint) and *R_2 ^ 2 = 1 - \\\\frac{\\\\sum (y - Y_r) ^ 2 }{ \\\\sum (y - Y_{a2})^2} for x > BP (breakpoint) where: : \\\\sum (y - Y_r) ^2 is the minimized SSD per segment and :Ya1 and Ya2 are the average values of y in the respective segments. In the determination of the most suitable trend, statistical tests must be performed to ensure that this trend is reliable (significant). When no significant breakpoint can be detected, one must fall back on a regression without breakpoint. Example Segmented linear regression, type 3b For the blue figure at the right that gives the relation between yield of mustard (Yr = Ym, t/ha) and soil salinity (x = Ss, expressed as electric conductivity of the soil solution EC in dS/m) it is found that:R.J.Oosterbaan, D.P.Sharma, K.N.Singh and K.V.G.K.Rao, 1990, Crop production and soil salinity: evaluation of field data from India by segmented linear regression. In: Proceedings of the Symposium on Land Drainage for Salinity Control in Arid and Semi-Arid Regions, February 25th to March 2nd, 1990, Cairo, Egypt, Vol. 3, Session V, p. 373 - 383. BP = 4.93, A1 = 0, K1 = 1.74, A2 = ‚àí0.129, K2 = 2.38, R12 = 0.0035 (insignificant), R22 = 0.395 (significant) and: * Ym = 1.74 t/ha for Ss < 4.93 (breakpoint) * Ym = ‚àí0.129 Ss + 2.38 t/ha for Ss > 4.93 (breakpoint) indicating that soil salinities < 4.93 dS/m are safe and soil salinities > 4.93 dS/m reduce the yield @ 0.129 t/ha per unit increase of soil salinity. The figure also shows confidence intervals and uncertainty as elaborated hereunder. Test procedures Example time series, type 5 Example of an ANOVA table: in this case the introduction of a break point is highly significant. The following statistical tests are used to determine the type of trend: # significance of the breakpoint (BP) by expressing BP as a function of regression coefficients A1 and A2 and the means Y1 and Y2 of the y-data and the means X1 and X2 of the x data (left and right of BP), using the laws of propagation of errors in additions and multiplications to compute the standard error (SE) of BP, and applying Student's t-test # significance of A1 and A2 applying Student's t-distribution and the standard error SE of A1 and A2 # significance of the difference of A1 and A2 applying Student's t-distribution using the SE of their difference. # significance of the difference of Y1 and Y2 applying Student's t-distribution using the SE of their difference. #A more formal statistical approach to test for the existence of a breakpoint, is via the pseudo score test which does not require estimation of the segmented line. In addition, use is made of the correlation coefficient of all data (Ra), the coefficient of determination or coefficient of explanation, confidence intervals of the regression functions, and ANOVA analysis.Statistical significance of segmented linear regression with break-point using variance analysis and F-tests. Download from under nr. 13, or directly as PDF : The coefficient of determination for all data (Cd), that is to be maximized under the conditions set by the significance tests, is found from: *C_d=1-{\\\\sum (y-Y_r)^2\\\\over\\\\sum (y-Y_a)^2} where Yr is the expected (predicted) value of y according to the former regression equations and Ya is the average of all y values. The Cd coefficient ranges between 0 (no explanation at all) to 1 (full explanation, perfect match). In a pure, unsegmented, linear regression, the values of Cd and Ra2 are equal. In a segmented regression, Cd needs to be significantly larger than Ra2 to justify the segmentation. The optimal value of the breakpoint may be found such that the Cd coefficient is maximum. No-effect range Illustration of a range from X=0 to X=7.1 over which there is no effect. Segmented regression is often used to detect over which range an explanatory variable (X) has no effect on the dependent variable (Y), while beyond the reach there is a clear response, be it positive or negative. The reach of no effect may be found at the initial part of X domain or conversely at its last part. For the \\"no effect\\" analysis, application of the least squares method for the segmented regression analysis Segmented regression analysis, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. Free download from the webpage may not be the most appropriate technique because the aim is rather to find the longest stretch over which the Y-X relation can be considered to possess zero slope while beyond the reach the slope is significantly different from zero but knowledge about the best value of this slope is not material. The method to find the no-effect range is progressive partial regression Partial Regression Analysis, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. Free download from the webpage over the range, extending the range with small steps until the regression coefficient gets significantly different from zero. In the next figure the break point is found at X=7.9 while for the same data (see blue figure above for mustard yield), the least squares method yields a break point only at X=4.9. The latter value is lower, but the fit of the data beyond the break point is better. Hence, it will depend on the purpose of the analysis which method needs to be employed.

While playing for the Yunnan Running Bulls, Muoneke was physically attacked during a postgame confrontation between himself and Chinese national team captain and Shanghai Sharks player Liu Wei. After Muoneke and the Sharks' Cai Liang wrestled for the ball during the game, Cai, Liu and some Sharks players confronted Muoneke, his wife, children and mother-in-law as they were leaving the stadium. Muoneke had a water bottle thrown at him, before being chased and cornered by the players. Liu and Cai were subsequently fined and suspended. The Shanghai Sharks were also fined.

History In 1834, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania chartered the Portsmouth and Lancaster Rail-Road, one of the earliest in the United States being organized only six years after the first, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The following year, the company changed its name to the Harrisburg, Portsmouth, Mountjoy and Lancaster Rail-Road Company. Simon Cameron of Middletown (who later became Secretary of War under President Abraham Lincoln) and James Buchanan of Lancaster (who later became President of the United States) were among the founders. The HPMtJ&L; followed the east side of the Susquehanna River, surveyed and located in 1834 to connect the Susquehanna River valley communities of Harris Ferry (now Harrisburg), Portsmouth (now a part of Middletown), Mount Joy, and Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The HPMtJ&L; also connected with the Cumberland Valley Railroad at Harrisburg, the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad at Lancaster, and to the Portsmouth Canal Basin in Middletown. Construction work began in 1835 and the main line completed in 1838, concluding with a tunnel built just outside of Elizabethtown. The first track laid of the new railroad ran from Harrisburg to the Portsmouth section of Middletown, becoming one of the first sections of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) built. The line opened with horse-drawn cars. A branch line was completed in 1850, built from Middletown (Royalton) to Columbia, connecting with the terminus of the Philadelphia & Columbia Railroad. This branch included a very short tunnel outside of Columbia, named Point Rock Tunnel. Share of the Harrisburg, Portsmouth, Mountjoy and Lancaster RR Company, issued 5. August 1857 Several improvements to the entire line were made. Beginning in 1886, the tunnel outside Elizabethtown was eliminated with an open cut. Between 1892 and 1903, 23 curves were eliminated and easement of several others. By 1917, all wooden bridges were replaced with permanent structures. Pennsylvania Railroad Operation and Control The PRR first operated the HPMtJ&L; under contract for 20 years starting September 1, 1849, whereby the PRR was to purchase all the equipment of the HPMtJ&L; for use on both lines. The PRR next arranged a more-favorable lease of the HPMtJ&L; for 999 years from January 1, 1861. This lease brought the last piece of railroad between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia under the control of the PRR. The HPMtJ&L; was finally merged into the PRR on April 25, 1917.

Showing an early ability in music, he moved to Braunschweig (Brunswick) in 1679 to study with organist Jacob B√∂lsche and in 1684 studied briefly with both Johann Adam Reincken and Dieterich Buxtehude in Hamburg and L√ºbeck.

A is a traditionally Japanese garment worn around the neck of Zen Buddhists who have taken the precepts. It can also signify Lay Ordination. It is made of 16 or more strips of cloth, sewn together into a brick-like pattern by the student during their period of preparation for their jukai or ordination ceremony. There is no set standard, but the most common application of rakusu color is for the front of the rakusu to be black for priests and brown for teachers. The back of the rakusu is left white. The teacher will traditionally write the student's new Dharma name and occasionally their lineage.  History  The rakusu is a miniature version of a standard kƒÅ·π£ƒÅya worn around the neck like a bib. The rakusu is a garment possibly of Chinese origins, potentially dating back to the periods of the Buddhist persecutions from which the Ch√°n Buddhist tradition emerged as the strongest sect. The Buddha's original outer robe was a rectangular robe in the ratio of 6 by 9. The Buddha is said to have renounced the wearing of new cloth and created his robe from pieces of cast- off white burial cloth found at burial sites and dyed with saffron, for its disinfecting value. It is said in legend to resemble the rice fields seen by the Buddha himself while walking on pilgrimage. One origin story holds that when the Chinese emperors forbid the wearing of robes, defrocked all the Buddhist monks, and bestowed imperial favor on the Confucian and Taoist priests, then Buddhist monks created a miniature version of their robe to be worn secretly around the neck underneath their regular lay clothing. Another suggests that the rakusu developed as Zen monks became involved in manual labor because a full robe would have been too unwieldy. Additionally, some Japanese scholars believe it was developed in Japan during the Edo or Tokugawa Era, as the result of regulations specifying the size and fabric type of monks clothing. Assuming the rakusu was used in China, it fell into general disuse there, but the tradition continues in Japan and it is now commonly associated with Zen Buddhist lineages stemming from that country. The rakusu today is still sometimes made with an ornamental circular clasp on the left side to emulate the circular clasp used on some full-sized robes.  Symbolism  The rakusu represents the garments that the Buddha put together to wear after he left his palace to seek enlightenment. According to Buddhist scripture, SiddhƒÅrtha left the palace where he was a prince, and collected rags from trash heaps, funeral pyres, and various other places. He then cleaned the rags by rubbing them in saffron, which gave his robes an orange-golden appearance. In the S≈çt≈ç school, the rakusu's color is usually determined by the wearer's status. For example, lay practitioners frequently receive a blue rakusu and black ones are given upon ordination as a priest. A brown rakusu indicates that the wearer has received dharma transmission and is authorized to teach. On the back of the collar of the rakusu there is an identifying embroidered stitch that represents each of the existing schools of Zen. The S≈çt≈ç school uses a broken pine needle design, the Rinzai school a mountain-shaped triangle, and the ≈åbaku school a six-pointed star.

It introduces Earth-Two, and more generally the concept of the multiverse, to DC Comics. The story was written by Gardner Fox under the editorial guidance of Julius Schwartz (whose subsequent autobiography was titled Man of Two Worlds), and illustrated by Carmine Infantino. In 2009, DC Comics released a new digitally remastered graphic novel collection, DC Comics Classics Library: The Flash of Two Worlds. It features the classic flagship story and other subsequent Pre-Crisis Flash material. Plot summary At a charity event organized by Iris West, the Flash performs super-speed tricks to entertain the children there as the scheduled magician has not come. Recreating a rope climbing trick, the Flash begins vibrating his molecules when he suddenly disappears from the stage. He finds himself outside near an unfamiliar city, which he discovers to be Keystone City, the home of the Golden Age Flash. Keystone City is located on Earth-Two (not named as such in this story),The name \\"Earth-Two\\" does not appear until \\"Crisis on Earth 1!\\" in Justice League of America #21. an Earth in a parallel universe. On Barry Allen's world, the Golden Age Flash is thought to be a fictional comic book character. Barry looks up Jay Garrick in the phone book and introduces himself to the older speedster. On this Earth, Jay had retired as the Flash years earlier, the year his comic book series was canceled on Earth-One, and married his longtime girlfriend, Joan Williams. Barry claims Gardner Fox's thoughts must have been tuned in to the events of Earth-Two. Garrick says he is preparing to resume being the Flash and describes for Barry three incredible crimes that were committed recently. These thefts were perpetrated by three of Jay's former adversaries, the Fiddler, the Shade, and the Thinker, who have joined forces. The Flashes split up, with Jay taking on the Thinker and Barry against the Shade, but they are unable to defeat them. The Flashes regroup and go after the Fiddler together, saving a man from a falling steel girder along the way. Shade and Thinker meet up and realize that there are two Flashes. They hurry to warn the Fiddler of this turn of events, but the Fiddler has already managed to stop the Flashes with his musical powers. He commands the two speedsters to commit robberies for him. Just as the villainous trio are about to flee with their loot, the two Flashes capture them. It turns out that they had put small jewels in their ears to block the Fiddler's mind-control music after he told them to put them down and take larger jewels, then played along in order to fool the criminals. Barry returns to his Earth after Jay announces he is coming out of retirement and will continue as the Flash of his world. Effects of the story The success of \\"Flash of Two Worlds\\" encouraged DC to revive many of its Golden Age characters. Eventually, crossovers between the two Earths would become an annual feature in the Justice League of America comics, beginning with issue #21, \\"Crisis on Earth-One!\\" (August 1963), and culminating in the 1985 miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths. The cover itself has become an iconic image, and has been referenced in many covers including Flash vol. 1 #147 (Sep. 1964), Dark Horse Presents #67 (November 1992), Flash vol. 2 #123 (Mar. 1997), Impulse #70 (Mar. 2001), Flash Rebirth #5 (Jan. 2010), and The Flash #9 (Oct. 2016) as part of the Rebirth reboot. In 2004, a near-mint copy of The Flash #123 sold in a Heritage auction for $83,000. In Final Crisis #2 (August 2008), the location of this story is revisited by Wally West (the third Flash) and Jay Garrick (the first Flash), but by the time of Final Crisis the Central City community center has become an abandoned strip joint. Later in the same issue it becomes the location for the return of Barry Allen (the second Flash), for the first time since his apparent death in Crisis on Infinite Earths #8 (November 1985). Other media The comic is featured in the episode of The Big Bang Theory, \\"The Jiminy Conjecture\\". It is the comic book Sheldon loses in a cricket identification bet to Howard, and he can be seen holding it near the episode's conclusion. The concept of the Golden Age Flash being a comic book character on the Silver Age's Earth, and his retirement on his Earth coinciding with the cancellation of the series, is reused in the Justice League two-parter \\"Legends\\". It features the titular team visiting a Golden Age era reality with the \\"Justice Guild of America\\", a team similar to the Justice Society who are said to have been characters in a comic book series within the DC Animated Universe. John Stewart says the comic series was canceled and the League later deduce that this occurred when the team was killed in their timeline. The episode titled \\"Flash of Two Worlds\\" of Season 2's The Flash uses the title of the original story. It also contains a brief scene reminiscent of the cover, when the two Flashes run around opposite sides of a brick wall to check on a hostage after a fight with the criminal Sand Demon. In the show, Barry and Jay's situations are reversed: Jay (later revealed to be Hunter Zolomon) finds himself stranded on Earth 1, whereas in the comic, Barry arrives on Earth 2 (although he is able to leave at the end).

In women's basketball, the Sydney Uni Flames compete in the WNBL. The men's and women's water polo clubs also compete in their national leagues, with the men's team winning the title in 2005. The cricket club, founded in 1864, has competed in the Sydney Grade Cricket competition since its inception. The University fielded a rugby league team in the New South Wales Rugby League's Sydney premiership from 1920 to 1937. It currently competes in the NSW Tertiary Student Rugby League competition. The Sydney Uni Baseball Club was established in 1904, and enters three teams in the Sydney Winter Baseball League, which is the highest calibre competition in the state for the winter season. The Club also enters a fourth team into the Pacific Coast Baseball League. The baseball team are also reigning champions of the Australian University Games and have established themselves to be the champion team of the current era, winning three gold and once silver in the past four years at Australian University Games events. The Sydney Uni Boxing Club (SUBxC) was established as an independent club in 1908, having existed prior to this as a division of Sydney Uni Athletics Club (est. 1878). The Club trains all levels of boxing to male and female boxers, at the University's HK Ward Gymnasium, and enters boxers for internal and external competitions, including the NSW Boxing State Titles.NSW Boxing State Titles The Sydney University Fencing Club (SUFC) was founded in 1945 and is the oldest university fencing club in Australia. The club actively competes in all state and national level tournaments with active members on the international circuit, including several Olympians. Kendo Club training at HK Ward Gym The Kendo club, founded in 2005, has since merged with SU SPORT in 2007. USYD Kendo ClubUSYD Kendo Club actively participates in all regional and national level tournaments, as well as Australian University Games every year. The club is a member of New South Wales Kendo Association governed by the Australian Kendo Renmei. In netball, the Sydney Sandpipers were based at the university until they left the Commonwealth Bank Trophy, and the university now fields a team in the NSW state league. The Sydney University Soccer Football ClubThe Sydney University Soccer Football Club was founded in 1946. The club fields elite teams for men and women in the Football NSW Super League and Premier League respectively. The club also fields all age men's teams in the Eastern Suburbs Football Association Eastern Suburbs Football Association and all age women's teams in the North West Sydney Women's Soccer Association.North West Sydney Women's Soccer Association They also have a number of junior girls' teams and an over 35 men's team. The Australian rules football club, the Sydney University Students AFC, has teams in the Sydney AFL and the women's SWAFL competitions. The American football club, the Lions, was founded in 1984 and is the most successful club in the Gridiron NSW league, with twenty nine championship game appearances and twenty state titles, including the last sixteen in a row (2003‚Äì2018). The Sydney University Cheerleaders have won several New South Wales State Championships and were National Champions in 2008. Several of the team's members competed with Team Australia, in the All Girl Elite division, at the International Cheer Union (ICU) Cheerleading World Championships, during April 2013. Through some tough competition, the girls came second only to Canada, in a sport usually dominated by North America. Sydney University's sailing club is one of the country's oldest. Having gone through hard times, it has recently led the revival in Australian university sailing, organising new events and getting sailing back into the Unigames for 2010. The Sydney University Taekwondo ClubSydney University Taekwondo Club (USYDTKD) is a World Taekwondo Federation club formed in mid-2001 to cater for students who wish to learn mainstream taekwondo and represent Sydney University at the annual inter-university sporting events, such as Australian University Games.

Merlin first appeared in National Comics #1 (July 1940). The character is a direct descendant of the Arthurian wizard Merlin and spent most of his time fighting Nazis, using, as his title page frequently read, \\"occult powers to aid democracies in their fight against oppression\\". Fictional character biography In 1940, while unhappily contemplating his waning fortunes, playboy Jock Kellog is contacted by a messenger who tells him his eccentric, wealthy uncle is ill and might be dying. Kellog races to the scene in rural England, hoping his financial troubles will be ameliorated by a great inheritance. Instead of the palatial residence he expected, Jock arrives at a modest cottage. Upon entering, he discovers it is filled with numerous antiques of Arthurian vintage. Kellog's uncle is indeed dying, and he tells the young playboy that he is the last of a line of men who can trace their descent directly from Merlin. Before dying, the old man gives Kellog a green, hooded cloak and tells him that, while wearing it, he will inherit all the powers of Merlin himself. At first, Kellog disbelieves his uncle's story. However, while wearing the cloak, Kellog instinctively uses magic to save a woman falling from a building, and comes to accept his uncle's story as true. He thereafter resolves to use his newfound abilities to aid mankind. Kellog assumes the name of his magical ancestor, Merlin, and goes about roaming Europe, fighting Nazis wherever he encounters them. In 1945, Merlin the Magician was one of several magic and occult heroes who were contacted by Hourman to help defeat an entity known as \\"Stalker\\". Although the heroes were victorious, Merlin was killed in the battle. The disposition of his cloak remains unknown, perhaps because there is no one left of Merlin's line to use it, making the cloak useless. Powers and abilities Merlin possessed somewhat ill-defined but reputedly powerful magical abilities when wearing his magic cloak. He was shown able to produce virtually any effect that he could conceive. He could battle gods single-handedly, instantaneously teleport anywhere in the world, or summon mythological creatures to do his bidding. He also possessed astral projection, telekinesis, reality manipulation, and the ability to bring anyone back to life. Often, he could use his magic by speaking backwards. Similarity to other occult heroes Like numerous other magical heroes of the era, Merlin the Magician shares some similarities with Lee Falk's popular Mandrake the Magician strip, particularly in his appearance, which was a stereotypical prewar \\"stage magician\\" look, with a suit, mustache and cape. Like Zatara, who was similarly descended from a famous predecessor (Leonardo da Vinci), Merlin the Magician frequently invoked his magical effects by speaking them backwards (this attribute was given to him in National Comics #12 by writer-artist Fred Guardineer, who had himself previously created the backwards-talking Zatara for Action Comics). Appearances Merlin the Magician's final Quality Comics appearance was in National Comics #45. The last Merlin feature in National Comics appeared in issue #26. and thereafter followed an almost fifty-year hiatus for Merlin during which Quality Comics (or a large part of its stable of characters) was essentially folded into DC Comics. He made an appearance in All Star Comics v.2 #1 (May 1999), as a part of the 'Justice Society Returns' storyline. In that two-part arc, it was revealed that Merlin the Magician had actually died in battle with the supernatural entity known as \\"Stalker\\" in 1945. In 1985, Blackthorne Publishing released some black and white reprints of early issues of National Comics, including Merlin the Magician's appearances.

Development of physical dependence and the resulting withdrawal symptoms, some of which may last for years, may result from taking the medication as prescribed. Benzodiazepine withdrawal is characterized by sleep disturbance, irritability, increased tension and anxiety, panic attacks, hand tremor, shaking, sweating, difficulty with concentration, confusion and cognitive difficulty, memory problems, dry retching and nausea, weight loss, palpitations, headache, muscular pain and stiffness, a host of perceptual changes, hallucinations, seizures, psychosis, and increased risk of suicide (see \\"signs and symptoms\\" section below for full list). Further, these symptoms are notable for the manner in which they wax and wane and vary in severity from day to day or week by week instead of steadily decreasing in a straightforward monotonic manner. This phenomenon is often referred to as \\"waves\\" and \\"windows\\". It is a potentially serious condition, and is complex and often protracted in its course. Long-term benzodiazepine use, defined as daily use for at least three months, is not desirable because of the associated increased risk of dependence, dose escalation, loss of efficacy, increased risk of accidents and falls, particularly for the elderly, as well as cognitive, neurological, and intellectual impairments. Use of short-acting hypnotics, while being effective at initiating sleep, worsen the second half of sleep due to withdrawal effects. Benzodiazepine withdrawal can be severe and can provoke life-threatening withdrawal symptoms, such as seizures, particularly with abrupt or overly rapid dosage reduction from high doses or long time users. A severe withdrawal response can nevertheless occur despite gradual dose reduction, or from relatively low doses in short time users, even after a single large dose in animal models. A minority of individuals will experience a protracted withdrawal syndrome whose symptoms may persist at a sub-acute level for months, or years after cessation of benzodiazepines. The likelihood of developing a protracted withdrawal syndrome can be minimized by a slow, gradual reduction in dosage. Chronic exposure to benzodiazepines causes neural adaptations that counteract the drug's effects, leading to tolerance and dependence. Despite taking a constant therapeutic dose, long- term use of benzodiazepines may lead to the emergence of withdrawal-like symptoms, particularly between doses. When the drug is discontinued or the dosage reduced, withdrawal symptoms may appear and remain until the body reverses the physiological adaptations. These rebound symptoms may be identical to the symptoms for which the drug was initially taken, or may be part of discontinuation symptoms. In severe cases, the withdrawal reaction may exacerbate or resemble serious psychiatric and medical conditions, such as mania, schizophrenia, and, especially at high doses, seizure disorders. Failure to recognize discontinuation symptoms can lead to false evidence for the need to take benzodiazepines, which in turn leads to withdrawal failure and reinstatement of benzodiazepines, often to higher doses. Awareness of the withdrawal reactions, individualized taper strategies according to withdrawal severity, the addition of alternative strategies such as reassurance and referral to benzodiazepine withdrawal support groups, all increase the success rate of withdrawal. Signs and symptoms Withdrawal effects caused by sedative-hypnotics discontinuation, such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or alcohol, can cause serious medical complications. They are cited to be more hazardous to withdraw from than opioids. Users typically receive little advice and support for discontinuation. Some withdrawal symptoms are identical to the symptoms for which the medication was originally prescribed, and can be acute or protracted in duration. Onset of symptoms from long half-life benzodiazepines might be delayed for up to three weeks, although withdrawal symptoms from short-acting ones often present early, usually within 24‚Äì48 hours. There may be no fundamental differences in symptoms from either high or low dose discontinuation, but symptoms tend to be more severe from higher doses. Daytime reemergence and rebound withdrawal symptoms, sometimes confused with interdose withdrawal, may occur once dependence has set in. 'Reemergence' is the return of symptoms for which the drug was initially prescribed, in contrast, 'rebound' symptoms are a return of the symptoms for which the benzodiazepine was initially taken, but at a more intense level than before; whereas 'interdose withdrawal' is when a prior dosage of drug wears off and beginnings of an entirely new cycle of withdrawal sets in, the symptoms of which dissipate upon taking the next dosage but after which yet another entirely new cycle of withdrawal begins when that dosage wears off, a new onset of withdrawal between each dosage thus called 'interdose withdrawal' and if not properly treated can recur indefinitely in a vicious circle (for which a benzo with a long half life, e.g. diazepam, can be substituted so the drug does not wear off between doses). Withdrawal symptoms may appear for the first time during dose reduction, and include insomnia, anxiety, distress, weight loss, dizziness, night sweats, shakes, muscle twitches, aphasia, panic attacks, depression, derealization, paranoia, indigestion, diarrhea, photo phobia etc., and are more commonly associated with short-acting benzodiazepines discontinuation, like triazolam. Daytime symptoms can occur after a few days to a few weeks of administration of nightly benzodiazepine use or z-drugs such as zopiclone; withdrawal-related insomnia rebounds worse than baseline, and for rapidly eliminated benzodiazepines, including triazolam and temazepam, this may occur even when used briefly and intermittently, according to a small 1991 study (n=18). The following symptoms may emerge during gradual or abrupt dosage reduction: Rapid discontinuation may result in a more serious syndrome As withdrawal progresses, patients often find their physical and mental health improves with improved mood and improved cognition. Mechanism The neuroadaptive processes involved in tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal mechanisms implicate both the GABAergic and the glutamatergic systems. Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system; roughly one-quarter to one- third of synapses use GABA. GABA mediates the influx of chloride ions through ligand-gated chloride channels called GABAA receptors. When chloride enters the nerve cell, the cell membrane potential hyperpolarizes thereby inhibiting depolarization, or reduction in the firing rate of the post-synaptic nerve cell. Benzodiazepines potentiate the action of GABA, by binding a site between the Œ± and Œ≥ subunits of the 5-subunit receptor thereby increasing the frequency of the GABA-gated chloride channel opening in the presence of GABA. When potentiation is sustained by long-term use, neuroadaptations occur which result in decreased GABAergic response. What is certain is that surface GABAA receptor protein levels are altered in response to benzodiazepine exposure, as is receptor turnover rate. The exact reason for the reduced responsiveness has not been elucidated but down-regulation of the number of receptors has only been observed at some receptor locations including in the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra; down-regulation of the number of receptors or internalization does not appear to be the main mechanism at other locations. Evidence exists for other hypotheses including changes in the receptor conformation, changes in turnover, recycling, or production rates, degree of phosphorylation and receptor gene expression, subunit composition, decreased coupling mechanisms between the GABA and benzodiazepine site, decrease in GABA production, and compensatory increased glutamatergic activity. A unified model hypothesis involves a combination of internalization of the receptor, followed by preferential degradation of certain receptor sub-units, which provides the nuclear activation for changes in receptor gene transcription. It has been postulated that when benzodiazepines are cleared from the brain, these neuroadaptations are \\"unmasked\\", leading to unopposed excitability of the neuron. Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate nervous system. Increased glutamate excitatory activity during withdrawal may lead to sensitization or kindling of the CNS, possibly leading to worsening cognition and symptomatology and making each subsequent withdrawal period worse. Those who have a prior history of withdrawing from benzodiazepines are found to be less likely to succeed the next time around. Diagnosis In severe cases, the withdrawal reaction or protracted withdrawal may exacerbate or resemble serious psychiatric and medical conditions, such as mania, schizophrenia, agitated depression, panic disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, and complex partial seizures and, especially at high doses, seizure disorders. Failure to recognize discontinuation symptoms can lead to false evidence for the need to take benzodiazepines, which in turn leads to withdrawal failure and reinstatement of benzodiazepines, often to higher doses. Pre-existing disorder or other causes typically do not improve, whereas symptoms of protracted withdrawal gradually improve over the ensuing months. Symptoms may lack a psychological cause and can fluctuate in intensity with periods of good and bad days until eventual recovery. Prevention According to the British National Formulary, it is better to withdraw too slowly rather than too quickly from benzodiazepines. The rate of dosage reduction is best carried out so as to minimize the symptoms' intensity and severity. Anecdotally, a slow rate of reduction may reduce the risk of developing a severe protracted syndrome. Long half-life benzodiazepines like diazepam or chlordiazepoxide are preferred to minimize rebound effects and are available in low dose forms. Some people may not fully stabilize between dose reductions, even when the rate of reduction is slowed. Such people sometimes simply need to persist as they may not feel better until they have been fully withdrawn from them for a period of time. Management Chlordiazepoxide, 5 mg capsules, are sometimes used as an alternative to diazepam for benzodiazepine withdrawal. Like diazepam, it has a long elimination half-life and long-acting active metabolites. Management of benzodiazepine dependence involves considering the person's age, comorbidity and the pharmacological pathways of benzodiazepines. Psychological interventions may provide a small but significant additional benefit over gradual dose reduction alone at post- cessation and at follow-up. The psychological interventions studied were relaxation training, cognitive-behavioral treatment of insomnia, and self- monitoring of consumption and symptoms, goal-setting, management of withdrawal and coping with anxiety. There is no standard approach to managing benzodiazepine withdrawal. With sufficient motivation and the proper approach, almost anyone can successfully withdraw from benzodiazepines. However, a prolonged and severe syndrome can lead to collapsed marriages, business failures, bankruptcy, hospitalization, and the most serious adverse effect, suicide. As such, long-term users should not be forced to discontinue against their will. Over-rapid withdrawal, lack of explanation, and failure to reassure individuals that they are experiencing temporary withdrawal symptoms led some people to experience increased panic and fears they are going mad, with some people developing a condition similar to post-traumatic stress disorder as a result. A slow withdrawal regimen, coupled with reassurance from family, friends, and peers improves the outcome. According to a 2015 Cochrane review cognitive behavior therapy plus taper was effective in achieving discontinuation in the short-term but the effect was not certain after six months. Medications While some substitutive pharmacotherapies may have promise, current evidence is insufficient to support their use. Some studies found that the abrupt substitution of substitutive pharmacotherapy was actually less effective than gradual dose reduction alone, and only three studies found benefits of adding melatonin, paroxetine, trazodone, or valproate in conjunction with a gradual dose reduction. *Antipsychotics are generally ineffective for benzodiazepine withdrawal-related psychosis. Antipsychotics should be avoided during benzodiazepine withdrawal as they tend to aggravate withdrawal symptoms, including convulsions. Some antipsychotic agents may be riskier than others during withdrawal, especially clozapine, olanzapine or low potency phenothiazines (e.g., chlorpromazine), as they lower the seizure threshold and can worsen withdrawal effects; if used, extreme caution is required. *Barbiturates are cross tolerant to benzodiazepines and should generally be avoided; however phenobarbital can be used, as it is relatively safe,Clinical Guide to the Diagnosis and Treatment of Mental Disorders By Michael B. First, Allan Tasman, p. 242 see below. *Benzodiazepines or cross tolerant drugs should be avoided after discontinuation, even occasionally. These include the nonbenzodiazepines Z-drugs, which have a similar mechanism of action. This is because tolerance to benzodiazepines has been demonstrated to be still present at four months to two years after withdrawal depending on personal biochemistry. Re-exposures to benzodiazepines typically resulted in a reactivation of the tolerance and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. *Bupropion, which is used primarily as an antidepressant and smoking cessation aid, is contraindicated in persons experiencing abrupt withdrawal from benzodiazepines or other sedative- hypnotics (e.g. alcohol), due to an increased risk of seizures. *Buspirone augmentation was not found to increase the discontinuation success rate. *Caffeine may worsen withdrawal symptoms because of its stimulatory properties. At least one animal study has shown some modulation of the benzodiazepine site by caffeine, which produces a lowering of seizure threshold. *Carbamazepine, an anticonvulsant, appears to have some beneficial effects in the treatment and management of benzodiazepine withdrawal; however, research is limited and thus the ability of experts to make recommendations on its use for benzodiazepine withdrawal is not possible at present. *Ethanol, the primary alcohol in alcoholic beverages, even mild to moderate use, has been found to be a significant predictor of withdrawal failure, probably because of its cross tolerance with benzodiazepines. *Flumazenil has been found to stimulate the reversal of tolerance and the normalization of receptor function. However, further research is needed in the form of randomised trials to demonstrate its role in the treatment of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Flumazenil stimulates the up-regulation and reverses the uncoupling of benzodiazepine receptors to the GABAA receptor, thereby reversing tolerance and reducing withdrawal symptoms and relapse rates. Because of limited research and experience compared to the possible risks involved, the flumazenil detoxification method is controversial and can only be done as an inpatient procedure under medical supervision. :Flumazenil was found to be more effective than placebo in reducing feelings of hostility and aggression in patients who had been free of benzodiazepines for 4‚Äì266 weeks. This may suggest a role for flumazenil in treating protracted benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. :A study into the effects of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil, on benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms persisting after withdrawal was carried out by Lader and Morton. Study subjects had been benzodiazepine- free for between one month and five years, but all reported persisting withdrawal effects to varying degrees. Persistent symptoms included clouded thinking, tiredness, muscular symptoms such as neck tension, depersonalisation, cramps and shaking and the characteristic perceptual symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal, namely, pins and needles feeling, burning skin, pain and subjective sensations of bodily distortion. Therapy with 0.2‚Äì2 mg of flumazenil intravenously was found to decrease these symptoms in a placebo-controlled study. This is of interest as benzodiazepine receptor antagonists are neutral and have no clinical effects. The author of the study suggested the most likely explanation is past benzodiazepine use and subsequent tolerance had locked the conformation of the GABA-BZD receptor complex into an inverse agonist conformation, and the antagonist flumazenil resets benzodiazepine receptors to their original sensitivity. Flumazenil was found in this study to be a successful treatment for protracted benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, but further research is required. A study by Professor Borg in Sweden produced similar results in patients suffering from protracted withdrawal. In 2007, Hoffmann‚ÄìLa Roche the makers of flumazenil, acknowledged the existence of protracted benzodiazepine withdrawal syndromes, but did not recommended flumazenil to treat the condition. *Fluoroquinolone antibiotics have been noted to increase the incidence of a CNS toxicity from 1% in the general population, to 4% in benzodiazepine-dependent population or in those undergoing withdrawal from them. This is probably the result of their GABA antagonistic effects as they have been found to competitively displace benzodiazepines from benzodiazepine receptor sites. This antagonism can precipitate acute withdrawal symptoms, that can persist for weeks or months before subsiding. The symptoms include depression, anxiety, psychosis, paranoia, severe insomnia, parathesia, tinnitus, hypersensitivity to light and sound, tremors, status epilepticus, suicidal thoughts and suicide attempt. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics should be contraindicated in patients who are dependent on or in benzodiazepine withdrawal. NSAIDs have some mild GABA antagonistic properties and animal research indicate that some may even displace benzodiazepines from their binding site. However, NSAIDs taken in combination with fluoroquinolones cause a very significant increase in GABA antagonism, GABA toxicity, seizures, and other severe adverse effects. *Imidazenil has received some research for management of benzodiazepine withdrawal, but is not currently used in withdrawal. *Imipramine was found to statistically increase the discontinuation success rate. *Melatonin augmentation was found to statistically increase the discontinuation success rate for people with insomnia. *Phenobarbital, (a barbiturate), is used at \\"detox\\" or other inpatient facilities to prevent seizures during rapid withdrawal or cold turkey. The phenobarbital is followed by a one- to two-week taper, although a slow taper from phenobarbital is preferred. In a comparison study, a rapid taper using benzodiazepines was found to be superior to a phenobarbital rapid taper. *Pregabalin may help reduce the severity of benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms, and reduce the risk of relapse. *Progesterone has been found to be ineffective for managing benzodiazepine withdrawal. *Propranolol was not found to increase the discontinuation success rate. *SSRI antidepressants have been found to have little value in the treatment of benzodiazepine withdrawal. *Trazodone was not found to increase the discontinuation success rate. Inpatient treatment Inpatient drug detox or rehabilitation facilities may be inappropriate for those who have become tolerant or dependent while taking the drug as prescribed, as opposed to recreational use. Such inpatient referrals may be traumatic for non- abusers. Prognosis A 2006 meta-analysis found evidence for the efficacy of stepped care: minimal intervention (e.g. send an advisory letter, or meet large number of patients to advise discontinuation), followed by systematic tapered discontinuation alone without augmentation if the first try was unsuccessful. Cognitive behavioral therapy improved discontinuation success rates for panic disorder, melatonin for insomnia, and flumazenil or sodium valproate for general long-term benzodiazepine use. A ten-year follow-up found that more than half of those who had successfully withdrawn from long-term use were still abstinent two years later, and that if they were able to maintain this state at two years, they were likely to maintain this state at the ten- year followup. One study found that after one year of abstinence from long- term use of benzodiazepines, cognitive, neurological and intellectual impairments had returned to normal. Those who had a prior psychiatric diagnosis had a similar success rate from a gradual taper at a two-year follow-up. Withdrawal from benzodiazepines did not lead to an increased use of antidepressants. Withdrawal process It can be too difficult to withdraw from short- or intermediate-acting benzodiazepines because of the intensity of the rebound symptoms felt between doses. Moreover, short-acting benzodiazepines appear to produce a more intense withdrawal syndrome. For this reason, discontinuation is sometimes carried out by first substituting an equivalent dose of a short-acting benzodiazepine with a longer-acting one like diazepam or chlordiazepoxide. Failure to use the correct equivalent amount can precipitate a severe withdrawal reaction. Benzodiazepines with a half-life of more than 24 hours include chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, clobazam, clonazepam, chlorazepinic acid, ketazolam, medazepam, nordazepam, and prazepam. Benzodiazepines with a half-life of less than 24 hours include alprazolam, bromazepam, brotizolam, flunitrazepam, loprazolam, lorazepam, lormetazepam, midazolam, nitrazepam, oxazepam, and temazepam. The resultant equivalent dose is then gradually reduced. The consensus is to reduce dosage gradually over several weeks, e.g. 4 or more weeks for diazepam doses over 30 mg/day, with the rate determined by the person's ability to tolerate symptoms. cited The recommended reduction rates range from 50% of the initial dose every week or so, cited to 10-25% of the daily dose every 2 weeks. For example, the reduction rate used in the Heather Ashton protocol calls for eliminating 10% of the remaining dose every two to four weeks, depending on the severity and response to reductions with the final dose at 0.5 mg dose of diazepam or 2.5 mg dose of chlordiazepoxide. For most people, discontinuation over 4-6 weeks or 4-8 weeks is suitable. Prolonged period of reduction over many months should be avoided to prevent the withdrawal process from becoming a \\"morbid focus\\" for the person. Duration After the last dose has been taken, the acute phase of the withdrawal generally lasts for about two months although withdrawal symptoms, even from low-dose use, can persist for six to twelve months gradually improving over that period, however, clinically significant withdrawal symptoms may persist for years, although gradually declining. A clinical trial of patients taking the benzodiazepine alprazolam for as short as eight weeks triggered protracted symptoms of memory deficits which were still present up to eight weeks after cessation of alprazolam. Protracted withdrawal syndrome Protracted withdrawal syndrome refers to symptoms persisting for months or even years. A significant minority of people withdrawing from benzodiazepines, perhaps 10% to 15%, experience a protracted withdrawal syndrome which can sometimes be severe. Symptoms may include tinnitus, psychosis, cognitive deficits, gastrointestinal complaints, insomnia, paraesthesia (tingling and numbness), pain (usually in limbs and extremities), muscle pain, weakness, tension, painful tremor, shaking attacks, jerks, dizziness and blepharospasm and may occur even without a pre-existing history of these symptoms. Tinnitus occurring during dose reduction or discontinuation of benzodiazepines is alleviated by recommencement of benzodiazepines. Dizziness is often reported as being the withdrawal symptom that lasts the longest. A study testing neuropsychological factors found psychophysiological markers differing from normals, and concluded that protracted withdrawal syndrome was a genuine iatrogenic condition caused by the long-term use. The causes of persisting symptoms are a combination of pharmacological factors such as persisting drug induced receptor changes, psychological factors both caused by the drug and separate from the drug and possibly in some cases, particularly high dose users, structural brain damage or structural neuronal damage. Symptoms continue to improve over time, often to the point where people eventually resume their normal lives, even after years of incapacity. A slow withdrawal rate significantly reduces the risk of a protracted or severe withdrawal state. Protracted withdrawal symptoms can be punctuated by periods of good days and bad days. When symptoms increase periodically during protracted withdrawal, physiological changes may be present, including dilated pupils as well as an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. The change in symptoms has been proposed to be due to changes in receptor sensitivity for GABA during the process of tolerance reversal. A meta-analysis found cognitive impairments in many areas due to benzodiazepine use show improvements after six months of withdrawal, but significant impairments in most areas may be permanent or may require more than six months to reverse. Protracted symptoms continue to fade over a period of many months or several years. There is no known cure for protracted benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome except time, however, the medication flumazenil was found to be more effective than placebo in reducing feelings of hostility and aggression in patients who had been free of benzodiazepines for 4‚Äì266 weeks. This may suggest a role for flumazenil in treating protracted benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. Epidemiology The severity and length of the withdrawal syndrome is likely determined by various factors, including rate of tapering, length of use and dosage size, and possible genetic factors. Those who have a prior history of withdrawing from benzodiazepines may have a sensitized or kindled central nervous system leading to worsening cognition and symptomatology, and making each subsequent withdrawal period worse. Special populations Pediatrics A neonatal withdrawal syndrome, sometimes severe, can occur when the mother had taken benzodiazepines, especially during the third trimester. Symptoms include hypotonia, apnoeic spells, cyanosis, impaired metabolic responses to cold stress, and seizures. The neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome has been reported to persist from hours to months after birth. A withdrawal syndrome is seen in about 20% of pediatric intensive care unit children after infusions with benzodiazepines or opioids. The likelihood of having the syndrome correlates with total infusion duration and dose, although duration is thought to be more important. Treatment for withdrawal usually involves weaning over a 3- to 21-day period if the infusion lasted for more than a week. Symptoms include tremors, agitation, sleeplessness, inconsolable crying, diarrhea and sweating. In total, over fifty withdrawal symptoms are listed in this review article. Environmental measures aimed at easing the symptoms of neonates with severe abstinence syndrome had little impact, but providing a quiet sleep environment helped in mild cases. Pregnancy Discontinuing benzodiazepines or antidepressants abruptly due to concerns of teratogenic effects of the medications has a high risk of causing serious complications, so is not recommended. For example, abrupt withdrawal of benzodiazepines or antidepressants has a high risk of causing extreme withdrawal symptoms, including suicidal ideation and a severe rebound effect of the return of the underlying disorder if present. This can lead to hospitalisation and potentially, suicide. One study reported one-third of mothers who suddenly discontinued or very rapidly tapered their medications became acutely suicidal due to 'unbearable symptoms'. One woman had a medical abortion, as she felt she could no longer cope, and another woman used alcohol in a bid to combat the withdrawal symptoms from benzodiazepines. Spontaneous abortions may also result from abrupt withdrawal of psychotropic medications, including benzodiazepines. The study reported physicians generally are not aware of the severe consequences of abrupt withdrawal of psychotropic medications such as benzodiazepines or antidepressants. Elderly A study of the elderly who were benzodiazepine dependent found withdrawal could be carried out with few complications and could lead to improvements in sleep and cognitive abilities. At 52 weeks after successful withdrawal, a 22% improvement in cognitive status was found, as well as improved social functioning. Those who remained on benzodiazepines experienced a 5% decline in cognitive abilities, which seemed to be faster than that seen in normal aging, suggesting the longer the intake of benzodiazepines, the worse the cognitive effects become. Some worsening of symptoms were seen in the first few months of benzodiazepine abstinence, but at a 24-week followup, elderly subjects were clearly improved compared to those who remained on benzodiazepines. Improvements in sleep were seen at the 24- and 52-week followups. The authors concluded benzodiazepines were not effective in the long term for sleep problems except in suppressing withdrawal-related rebound insomnia. Improvements were seen between 24 and 52 weeks after withdrawal in many factors, including improved sleep and several cognitive and performance abilities. Some cognitive abilities, which are sensitive to benzodiazepines, as well as age, such as episodic memory did not improve. The authors, however, cited a study in younger patients who at a 3.5-year followup showed no memory impairments and speculated that certain memory functions take longer to recover from chronic benzodiazepine use and further improvements in elderly people's cognitive function may occur beyond 52 weeks after withdrawal. The reason it took 24 weeks for improvements to be seen after cessation of benzodiazepine use was due to the time it takes the brain to adapt to the benzodiazepine-free environment. At 24 weeks, significant improvements were found, including accuracy of information processing improved, but a decline was seen in those who remained on benzodiazepines. Further improvements were noted at the 52-week followup, indicating ongoing improvements with benzodiazepine abstinence. Younger people on benzodiazepines also experience cognitive deterioration in visual spatial memory, but are not as vulnerable as the elderly to the cognitive effects. Improved reaction times were noted at 52 weeks in elderly patients free from benzodiazepines. This is an important function in the elderly, especially if they drive a car due to the increased risk of road traffic accidents in benzodiazepine users. At the 24-week followup, 80% of people had successfully withdrawn from benzodiazepines. Part of the success was attributed to the placebo method used for part of the trial which broke the psychological dependence on benzodiazepines when the elderly patients realised they had completed their gradual reduction several weeks previously, and had only been taking placebo tablets. This helped reassure them they could sleep without their pills. The authors also warned of the similarities in pharmacology and mechanism of action of the newer nonbenzodiazepine Z drugs. The elimination half-life of diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, as well as other long half-life benzodiazepines, is twice as long in the elderly compared to younger individuals. Many doctors do not adjust benzodiazepine dosage according to age in elderly patients.

Steps have been taken to promote guidelines and best practices, and major resources are now dedicated to this field. A greater understanding of the accessible tourism market has been promoted through research commissioned by the European Commission where a stakeholder analysis has provided an insight into the complexities of accessible tourism.Buhalis, D., Michopoulou, E., Eichhorn, V., & Miller, G.

When expanded to include all beneficiaries of accessible tourism, as defined above, the number grows to some 130 million people affected in Europe alone. According to the World Report on Disability by World Health Organization and the World Bank in 2011, over 1 billion of people in the world had some disability, of whom nearly 200 million experienced severe difficulty in functioning. In addition to the social and health benefits, the market represents an opportunity for new investment and new service requirements, rarely provided by key players in the tourism sector. According to ENAT, the European Network for Accessible Tourism, accessible tourism includes: * Barrier-free destinations: infrastructure and facilities * Transport: by air, land and sea, suitable for all users * High quality services: delivered by trained staff * Activities, exhibits, attractions: allowing participation in tourism by everyone * Marketing, booking systems, web sites & services: information accessible to all  Specific needs and requirements  Specific problems found by travellers or tourists with disabilities include: * Inaccessible, or only partly accessible, web sites * Lack of accessible airport transfer * Lack of wheelchair accessible vehicles * Lack of well-adapted hotel rooms * Lack of professional staff capable of dealing with accessibility issues * Lack of reliable information about a specific attraction's level of accessibility * Lack of accessible restaurants, bars, and other facilities * Lack of adapted toilets in restaurants and public places * Inaccessible streets and sidewalks * Lack of technical aids and disability equipment such as wheelchairs, bath chairs and toilet raisers File:Extended picnic table campground.jpg|A campground picnic table made accessible to wheelchairs and walkers with its extended top.

Brief history  Europe and the United States of America are home to the majority of the existing companies in this niche. However, companies worldwide are starting to appear as the result of a growing need, largely driven by senior tourism, due to increasing life expectancy in developed countries. The United States requires ADA compliant ramp access to virtually all businesses and public places. Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany, France and other northern European countries are increasingly prepared to receive tourists in wheelchairs, and to provide disability equipment and wheelchair accessible transport. With the growth of the internet, online travel planning is also becoming more common, leading to the rise of online accessibility maps. Starting in 2016, Lonely Planet started offering online resources by country.

Grape anthracnose can be identified by the \\"bird's eye\\" lesions on the berries and sunken black or greyish lesions on leaves and shoots. From these lesions, conidia are produced. This disease can be lethal to the plant, either through defoliation and removal of photosynthetic capacity, or through injury to the active regions of the vine. Grape anthracnose is particularly important to the wine industry, as it can decrease quality and quantity of berries produced as well as kill the vine outright, leading to large economic losses, in particular during the middle summer months.Effects of Anthracnose Disease on Productiveness of Thompson-Seedless Cultivar of Grape Vitis-Vinifera, Singhrot R. S., Singh J. P., Suhag L. S., Indian Journal of Mycology and Plant Pathology  Hosts and symptoms  Illustration from 1892 depicting Grape Anthranose symptoms on grape shoots, leaves, and berries. E. ampelina affects two species of Rubus and three species of Vitis. Specifically, E. ampelina affects blackberries, raspberries, mountain grapes, fox or concord grapes, and the European wine grape. Anthracnose diseases can cause disease on a variety of plants, but the primary host for E. ampelina, is grape.http://www.plantwise.org/?dsid=20773&loadmodule;=plantwisedatasheet&page;=4270&site;=234, Grape Anthracnose Anthracnose on grape presents itself as lesions on shoots, leaves, and berries. Lesions will first appear on young shoots, showing up as small circular reddish spots that will later become larger and create grey lesions which appear sunken. The lesions will eventually develop margins that are a dark reddish-brown to violet-black color. If left untreated, lesions on shoots will become larger and eventually kill the shoot. While these lesions may be very apparent and easy to identify, they can sometimes be confused for hail damage. Hail damage typically appears on only one side of the plants. Also, anthracnose lesions will have darker and more raised edge. Anthracnose lesions on leaves and petioles look very similar to those on shoots. However, on leaves, the lesions will have dry grey or white centers that will eventually fall off, leaving a hole. This response by the plant is called a shot-hole. Should the lesions spread and the infection make it into the vascular system of the leaf, the anthracnose will prevent the proper development of the leaf and will lead to malformation or to the drying of the leaf. Grape vines are susceptible to anthracnose before flowering all the way through fruit soften and coloration. Essentially, the berries are susceptible to the pathogen throughout the growing season. Anthracnose presents itself on the berries as small reddish circles, around a quarter inch in diameter, that will become sunken with a narrow dark brown to black border. Eventually, the center of the lesion will change color from violet to white or grey and become velvety. These lesions often look like a shooting target or bullseye. Should the disease spread to and affect the pulp of the berry, it will cause cracking, which opens the berry to secondary infections. Disease Cycle Disease cycle of Elsinoe ampelina, causal agent of Anthracnose in grapes. Late in the season, the Grape Anthracnose fungus produces sclerotia, which are located primarily at the edge of the infected lesions on shoots. Unlike acervuli, sclerotia serves as the overwintering structures.Anthracnose, Anthracnose at Weekend Gardener Because the fungus over-winters in dormant and dead canes‚Äîone-year-old wood that starts to become lignified‚Äîdisease control becomes very difficult. Large numbers of conidia are disseminated from sclerotia in the spring when there are wet periods of 24 hours and temperature is above 36 ¬∞F (2 ¬∞C). The conidia infect the young leaves, shoots, and berries of the grape vine. Conidia will germinate, causing primary inoculum under the following circumstances: presence of free water in 12 hours and adequate temperature (36-90 ¬∞F (2-32 ¬∞C)).Anthracnose, Anthracnose at University of Minnesota In fact, primary inoculum of Grape Anthracnose is possible even before bud break. The infection rate will escalate with increases in temperature. Development of disease symptom is also temperature- dependent: within 13 days at 36 ¬∞F, or within 4 days at 90 ¬∞F. Simultaneously, ascospores are produced on the lesions of infected canes or berries left on the trellis system or on the vineyard floor to carry out the infection. These ascospores are formed in asci, which are in cavities within a stroma‚Äîthe dense structural tissue that produces fruiting bodies in fungi‚Äîof pseudothecium. Pseudothecium of grape anthracnose, the sexual fruiting body of the fungus, has asci containing eight four-celled ascospores. The fungus also overwinters as pseudothecium, but the importance of ascospores in disease development is not clearly understood. The study done by Mirica (1998) validated that the ascospores do germinate and infect the tissue and produce the Sphaceloma phase which shows the existence of the perfect stage of Elsinoe ampelina. Overall, conidia and ascospores overwinter on the ground and on infected tissue and become the source of primary inoculum. S.A.M.H. Naqvi (2004) Diseases of Fruits and Vegetables: Volume I: Diagnosis and Management Throughout spring and summer, the fungus produces acervuli on the exterior of the necrotic areas at their mature stage. Under wet condition, these acervuli form conidia. The conidia from acervuli becomes the secondary sources of infection for the remainder of the growing seasons. In summary, the disease cycle of Elsinoe Ampelina is as follows: 1) the fungus overwinters by forming both pseudothecium and sclerotia, 2) the spores from both structures cause primary inoculum and form mycelium on the infected lesions, 3) acervuli disseminate conidia which becomes the source of secondary inoculum. As mentioned earlier, grape anthracnose is dependent upon moisture and temperature. It can be exacerbated during heavy rainfall and hail, or by overhead irrigation. Environment Grape anthracnose can be found where ever grapes are grown, however it is more prevalent in certain areas. It thrives under warm and wet conditions.Compendium of Grape Diseases, Pearson, Roger and Austin Goheen, 1988 Both primary and secondary inoculum are spread by the splashing of rain on to new tissue. Moisture is required for the germination of conidia on tissue. New tissue is the most vulnerable to infection. Overgrown vines also promote infection as they take longer to dry out after dew or rain, often due to decreased air flow in the canopy. The disease can become even more severe in areas of poorly drained soil or during years of heavy rainfall or rain coupled with high temperatures. Management Sanitation is a critical factor in controlling grape anthracnose. The removal of infected tissues is done during the dormant stage, often when it is cold and dry in the winter months. The infected tissue must be then be destroyed upon removal. This reduces the amount of primary inoculum available to be released in the spring. Wild grape varieties in proximity to cultivated grapes should be removed. The wild species can host grape anthracnose and are a source of primary inoculum. Because the conidia are spread by water splashing, it is not crucial to eliminate all wild grapes, just the ones near the cultivated grapes. Planting varieties with resistance or tolerance to grape anthracnose can aid in management of the disease. American varieties like 'Concord' and 'Niagara' have more resistance to the disease, while French hybrids and Vitis vinifera are more susceptible to infection. Specific susceptible hybrid grape cultivars include 'Vidal', 'Mars', 'Marquis', and 'Reliance'. Canopy upkeep can be an important preventive measure when dealing with anthracnose. Proper pruning and training will increase air flow around the plant and thus reduce the drying time of external tissue surfaces. Appropriate care is especially crucial for target areas of new growth because they are most susceptible to the pathogen. Fungicides are a control measure commonly used once grape anthracnose has become established in a vineyard. The most important fungicide application occurs in early spring during the dormant period before bud swell.https://ag.purdue.edu/hla/Hort/Documents/ID-169-2012.pdf , Midwest Small Fruit and Grape Spray Guide, 2012 A lime-sulfur solution is most commonly used. This is typically applied at a rate of ten gallons per acre. Commercially available Sulforix can also be used at a rate of one gallon per acre. Both fungicides target the sclerotia overwintering in the canes. This dormant fungicide application is then followed up throughout the season by foliar sprays‚Äîsprays that target the surface of foliage. These sprays help protect the new susceptible tissues.Epidemiology of Grape Anthracnose: Factors Associated with Defoliation of Grape Leaves Infected by Elsinoe ampelina, Carisse, O. and Vincent Morissette-Thomas, Plant Disease Foliar sprays are typically recommended at two-week intervals. Other commercial products often used include Mancozeb, Captan, Ziram, Sovran, Rally, Elite, Inspire Super, Adamant, Mettle, Revus Top, Vintage, and Pristine. The majority of these fungicides are sterol inhibitors and a few are EBDC‚Äînon-systemic, surface- acting fungicides. It is important to use fungicides with different modes of action to avoid resistance development. Another control method is ensuring the use of disease-free plantings,First Report of Anthracnose Caused By Elsinoe ampelina on Grapes in Michigan, Schilder, A, S. Smokevitch, M. Catal, W. Mann. Plant Disease, Sept 2005, Vol. 89, Number 9. although phytosanitary regulations ban the movement of infected plants and propagules. The best way to ensure one is getting disease-free plantings is to buy them from a certified operation with disease-tested grape vines.http://www.eurofinsus.com/stalabs/pdf/MONIS%20-%20Clean%20Planting%20Stock_300.pdf, Disease Tested Grapevine Planting Stock, 2010 Importance Grape anthracnose can be found wherever grapes are grown. Lesions can kill leaves, shoots, the actively growing parts of vines, and cause the berries to be undesirable and unusable. Damage can be seen throughout the growing season, with severe damage in July through September, as the berries are ripening and undergoing veraison.Epidemiology of Grapevine Anthracnose Cause by Sphaceloma ampelinum in North India, Suhag L. S., Grover R. K., Indian Phytopathology In climates with strong winters, even if the disease does not outright kill the vine, it will reduce its photosynthetic capacity, leading to decreased amounts of carbohydrate reserves in the vine and eventual death in winter as those reserves dry up and the plant is unable to sustain itself. In addition, once the disease afflicts the berries, it will lead to a decrease in quality and quantity, which will have detrimental economic impact as wine makers will have lower volumes of lower quality berries to work with.

From an interchange with CSX Transportation at Laurens the railroad runs to the northwest, terminating at East Greenville. Primary commodities include plastic resins, gas turbines, wind turbines, food products, forest products, and chemicals with the railroad accumulating about 5,500 annual carloads in 2008. The railroad serves a General Electric facility that provides a source of high value cargo for the line, shipping several gas and wind turbines via rail on a weekly basis. History What is now the Carolina Piedmont railroad began as the Greenville and Laurens Railroad, which was chartered in 1878 and arrived in Greenville in 1882. The railroad was later merged with three others in the region to form the Port Royal and Western Carolina Railway in October 1886. In 1896, the railroad was merged, this time with the Port Royal and Augusta Railway to create the Charleston and Western Carolina Railway, and was promptly acquired by the Atlantic Coast Line in 1897. Additional mergers came in 1959, as the Charleston & Western Carolina was formally merged into the Atlantic Coast Line. The ACL was merged into the Seaboard Coast Line in 1967, and the SCL was merged into the Seaboard System in 1983. The final merger came in 1986, when the Seaboard System was merged into CSX Transportation. Shortline service begins Annual carloads amounted to about 8,000 in 1988, which prompted CSX to sell the portion from Laurens to a point short of downtown Greenville to the Carolina Piedmont Railroad on November 5, 1990. A key factor in the sale was the fact that the line could not support intermodal or automotive shipments on account of low clearances. The railroad was operated as a division of the South Carolina Central Railroad, a subsidiary of RailTex. For the year 1995, about 6,000 annual carloads originated or terminated on the line. Expansion and acquisition In April 1997, the railroad acquired the Greenville and Northern Railway, running from Greenville to Travelers Rest for a distance of . The G&N; was slated for abandonment, along with of track located at the end of the Carolina Piedmont near the Greenville Downtown Airport. However, on May 28, 1999 the railroad reached an agreement with the Greenville County Economic Development Corporation (GCEDC) to purchase both sections in their entirety. The Greenville & Northern was converted into the Swamp Rabbit Trail walking trail after the GCEDC failed to find a new operator, while the southern portion was operated by the Carolina Piedmont under contract by the GCEDC and is primarily used for railcar storage. An additional change came in 2000 as the South Carolina Central's parent company, RailTex, was purchased by RailAmerica. Around the same time the railroad teamed with General Electric to upgrade rail infrastructure in order to accommodate heavy turbine loads originating from the Greenville facility. Heavier rail was installed, and significant upgrades to the ballast and roadbed were made. The railroad continued to operate under RailAmerica, hauling 5,529 annual carloads in 2008. until December, 2012 when RailAmerica was absorbed into the competitor Genesee & Wyoming company.

He was the son of Anna Leonowens, famous as a tutor of King Mongkut. Leonowens later served as an officer with the Siamese Royal Cavalry and founded a Thai trading company that still bears his name, Louis T. Leonowens Ltd. He was the basis of a major character in the 1944 novel Anna and the King of Siam, as well as other fictional works based on it. Early life Leonowens was the son of Anna Leonowens nee Edwards, an Anglo-Indian who had never visited Britain, and Thomas Leon Owens, an Irish-born, India- raised clerk, who married in India in 1849. The couple left India for Singapore, then part of the Straits Settlements, in 1852. Louis was born at Lynton, Western Australia,Register of Births, Western Australia, no. 3469, 1856 where his father was working for the Commissariat. In 1857, the family moved to Penang, where his father was a hotel manager. His father died in 1859, and his mother moved to Singapore with Louis and his elder sister, telling the British expatriate community there that she was a genteel Welsh woman, the widow of a British army officer who had unfortunately lost her fortune.Loos, Tamara. \\"Review of Bombay Anna... by Susan Morgan, Journal of Historical Biography, vol 5 (Spring 2009), pp. 146‚Äì52 His mother's story was believed, and she was invited, in 1862, to teach the wives and children of King Mongkut of Siam (now Thailand). After sending Louis's sister to England to get a British education, his mother took him to Bangkok. He was raised in the Siamese royal palace for nearly six years and was schooled by his mother alongside the royal children, until 1867. He was sent to Europe to complete his education. By 1874, Louis was in the United States with his mother, but he had accumulated debts. He fled the U.S. and was estranged from his mother for 19 years. Career In 1881, at the age of 25, he returned to Siam and was granted a commission of Captain in the Royal Cavalry, by King Chulalongkorn. Leonowens in 1884 left the military and entered the teak trade. He went on in 1905 to found the Louis Thomas Leonowens Company in Siam, which became Louis T.

Taxation in the British Virgin Islands is relatively simple by comparative standards; photocopies of all of the tax laws of the British Virgin Islands would together amount to about 200 pages of paper.Compared to, for example, the tax code of the United States, which is approximately 70,000 pages. Taxation in the British Virgin Islands is mostly notable for what is not subject to taxation. The British Virgin Islands has: * no capital gains tax, * no gift tax, * no sales tax or value added tax, * no profit tax, * no inheritance tax or estate duty, and * no corporation tax. There is technically still income tax assessed in the British Virgin Islands for companies and individuals, but the rate of taxation has been set at zero.Income Tax Act (Cap 206); income tax was reduced to zero when the payroll tax was introduced. Foreign earned income was previously taxed on a remittance basis. However, individuals are subject to a payroll deduction made of up to 8% for employees with 12% paid by employers, in relation to all salaries over US$10,000 per annum. The absence of most major forms of taxation in the Territory has led to the country being included on most recognised lists of tax havens,See for example, OECD list of uncooperative tax havens (2000), the Dorgan-Levin-Feingold bill, and the official IMF list . although the jurisdiction prefers to style itself as a modern offshore financial centre. There are a number of forms of taxation and revenue collection in the British Virgin Islands, but the majority of the Government's revenues are obtained directly from annual licence fees for offshore companies incorporated in the jurisdiction. Payroll tax In 2005 the British Virgin Islands introduced a payroll tax in relation to employment and \\"deemed employment\\"\\"Deemed employment\\" broadly encompasses (i), partners in a partnership, (ii) directors or (iii) shareholders of a company who are actively involved in running the business and are not solely passive investors. within the British Virgin Islands.Payroll Taxes Act 2004 The legislation was brought in at the same time as income tax in the Territory was reduced to zero. The numbers were not in fact a perfect balance, and the Government (deliberately) reduced the amount of tax revenue it received by moving to the payroll tax system. The tax is paid at a graduated rate depending upon the size of the employer. The current rates (as at June 2007) are 10% for small employersA small employer (defined in the Act as a \\"class 1 employer\\" is one which has a payroll of less than US$150,000, a turnover of less than US$300,000 and fewer than 7 employees or \\"deemed employees\\" in total. and 14% for larger employers. 8% of the total remuneration is deduction from the employee, the remainder of the liability is met by the employer. The first US$10,000 of remuneration are free from payroll tax. Stamp duty Certain limited transactions in the British Virgin Islands are still subject to stamp duty.Stamp Act (Cap 202) The main application of the stamp duty legislation relates to transfers of real estate, or transfers of shares in companies which own real estate. The rate of stamp duty on such transactions varies according to the status of the transferee; if the transferee is a Belonger, then stamp duty on land transfers is assessed at 4%; if the transferee is a Non-Belonger, it is assessed at 12%. The legislation also includes a number of \\"rump\\" taxes that were imposed many years ago and subsist only due to a lack of attention in relation to updating legislation; the amounts involved are tiny, and are never enforced in practice. For example, charterparties are technically subject to stamp duty at a rate of 50¬¢ in the British Virgin Islands, but despite the flourishing bareboat charter industry stamp duty is rarely if ever paid by charterers. Separately, the British Virgin Islands also imposes various documentary duties which are described as being distinct from stamp duty on various classes of instrument: *Cheque duty is assessed at 10¬¢ on each negotiable instrument (including traveller's cheques) presented for payment within the Territory.Cheque Duty Act (Cap 201) *Trust instruments are assessed with trust duty of US$200 (unless they are charitable trusts or bare trusts).Trustee Act (Cap 303) The reason for not referring to these documentary taxes as stamp duty was that under the old International Business Companies Act (Cap 291), companies incorporated under that Act were exempt from stamp duty, and so to retain the payment obligations for those companies, they were referred to as 'cheque duty' and 'trust duty' respectively. Land tax and house tax Real estate in the British Virgin Islands is subject to nominal taxation.Land and House Tax Act (Cap 207) Because the amounts payable are so small, it is not uncommon for householders to not pay the tax at all, and then discharge all back taxes and penalties when they come to sell their property. The total tax on residential properties rarely exceeds US$100 per annum. The tax costs more to collect than it raises. During the Territory's last review of taxation, considerations were made to amend the law to reduce the amount of taxation collection due to a perception that it penalised second home owners (but not to abolish the taxes). As with stamp duty, land tax rates are considerably higher for foreigners than for Belongers. *Belongers pay annually: **US$10.00 for the first acre, or part thereof, and **US$3.00 for each subsequent acre, or part thereof. *Non-Belongers pay annually: **US$50 for the first half acre, or part thereof, **US$150 for the second half acre, or part thereof, and **US$50 for each subsequent half acre. House tax is paid at the same rate for all persons, and is it assessed at 1.5% of the annual rental value of the house. There is a general perception that rental values for owner-occupied homes tend to be assessed as being lower than their actual true market rental value. Customs duties Imports into the British Virgin Islands are, subject to certain limited exceptions,Computer equipment being one notable one. subject to import duty.Customs Duties Act (Cap 105) Although this raises a modest amount of government revenue, it tends to be used as a political tool, and to prevent excessive competition with local retailers from the nearby U.S. Virgin Islands. EU Withholding tax In common with most British Overseas Territories, the British Virgin Islands had the EU withholding tax imposed upon it in relation to interest payments in the jurisdiction which are payable to natural persons who are resident within the European Union.Mutual Legal Assistance (Tax Matters) (Amendment) Act 2005 The withholding tax was not mandatory; depositors can elect not to pay it by agreeing to full disclosure of their account information to the revenue authorities in their country of residence. The implication is that the withholding tax is only applied to those who are not properly declaring their income in their home countries. However, payment of the withholding tax does not exempt the income from any applicable income taxes in the home jurisdiction; there is no double taxation relief under the relevant legislation. The amounts raised by the EU withholding tax to date have been extremely modest.The amounts collected have never exceeded US$100,000 in total; it is not clear whether it actually costs more to collect and police the tax than it actually raises. There are two likely reasons for this; firstly, for an Offshore Financial Centre, the British Virgin Islands has an underdeveloped banking infrastructure compared to (for example) the Cayman Islands or Jersey and so comparatively modest sums are deposited in the Territory's banks; secondly, the withholding tax only affects deposits held by natural persons - because most offshore tax structuring involves the use of either an offshore company or an offshore trust, this usually takes it outside the scope of the tax. The EU Withholding tax was abolished in favour of disclosure of information with effect from 1 January 2012.Mutual Legal Assistance (Tax Matters) (Automatic Exchange of Information) Order, 2011 Miscellaneous other taxes The British Virgin Islands has a number of other minor taxes and levies. These include: * Car tax, under the Self-Drive vehicles (Rentals) (Taxation) Act (Cap 210) * Hotel tax, under the Hotel Accommodation Taxation Act (Cap 205) * Petroleum income tax, under the Petroleum Income Tax Act (Cap 209) * Passenger tax, under the Passengers Tax Act (Cap 208) * A tax is assessed on charterers, although it is characterised as a \\"permit\\" under the Cruising Permits Act (Cap 207) In addition there are a huge number of miscellaneous Governmental fees and charges which are levied pursuant to the Statutory Rates, Fees and Charges Act, 2005.

He was a carpenter by trade who worked on the Sutton Valence estate of John Willes, a Kent landowner and cricketer and arguably the most influential proponent of rounder bowling in the early 19th century. Ashby already had a reputation as a fine cricketer and is first known to have played for the county side in 1807 alongside Willes. He made his first-class cricket debut the following season and went on to make 45 appearances in top-class matches, most of them for Kent XIs. He also appeared for Hampshire, Sussex and Surrey sides as well as for MCC and played nine times for the Players against the Gentlemen. He played in the 1822 Kent match against MCC at Lord's when Lord Frederick Beauclerk, a leading MCC member, contrived to have Willes no-balled for throwing in an attempt to have rounder bowling outlawed. Willes famously left the match although Ashby, whose bowling action was probably lower than Willes', remaining in the match. Ashby played his last first-class match in 1830 but continued to play club cricket. He was employed as a professional at Camberwell Cricket Club in 1836 and played there for 10 years. Ashby married Sarah Whatson in 1819 and had two children, a son and a daughter. He died of bronchitis at Lambeth in 1847 aged 61.

Reception Reviewer Tim Niland wrote that both of Coltrane's performances are \\"explosive in their intensity\\", with \\"One Down, One Up\\" \\"nearly boiling over at times\\". He stated: \\"Despite the audacity of the music there are enough hints of melody and the musicians are so obviously sincere in their desire to explore that they are given great support by the audience.\\" Niland concluded: \\"While the music on this disc must have come as something of a shock to those who were unprepared for it, listening in historical context reveals it to be an excellent example of the rapidly evolving state of jazz in the mid 1960's by two of its most well known practitioners.\\" In a review for Jazz Times, Mac Randall wrote: \\"The classic Coltrane quartet was about to split when they played the '65 Newport Festival, and you can kinda tell; the leader is clearly aiming for something that his bandmates can't quite see. And yet the music they make together still packs a major emotional punch... A lot of people didn't like the 'new thing' that Trane and Shepp were offering here. Some still don't. But more than 50 years on, its breadth and depth are impossible to deny.\\" Writing for All About Jazz, Derek Taylor stated that Coltrane's quartet \\"works up a lengthy lather on 'One Down, One Up' before launching into a burning rundown of 'My Favorite Things.' Compared to other concert recordings by the quartet the first piece is just below par, though there's still plenty of incendiary fireworks ignited by the four... Coltrane's upper register tenor solo becomes so frenetic on 'One Down, One Up' that there are moments where he moves off mic, but his soprano work on 'My Favorite Things' is nothing short of astonishing, a blur of swirling harmonics that threatens split his horn asunder.\\" Regarding Shepp's set, he wrote that it is \\"brimming with political overtones and barely contained dysphoria and his sound on tenor is an arresting amalgam of raspy coarseness and delicate lyricism...

United Kingdom Ford ends 90 years of building cars in Britain when the Dagenham plant finishes Fiesta production in February, but it will remain open for the production of vans and the development of engines. The new fifth-generation Fiesta, will be built at the Valencia plant in Spain. The 5-door hatchback launched first with the 3-door launching in December. Its front-wheel drive chassis is used for an estate/MPV crossover called the Fusion. Another addition to the range will be a Peugeot-sourced 1.4 turbo- diesel engine. The Escort name was retired after 34 years when the last van models were produced and was replaced with the Transit Connect late in the year. The Puma coupe ends production after 5 years as the ST170 and RS versions of the Focus launch. Vauxhall introduces a second-generation Vectra which continues to be built in Britain, moving production to Ellesmere Port. Land Rover introduces new version of Range Rover at the start of the year while the smaller Discovery gets a facelift four years after the launch of the current generation with Range Rover styling cues. France The new Renault Megane earns the European Car of the Year award, and offers a 1.9 direct- injection diesel engine. The initial bodystyles are three- and five-door hatchbacks. The new Renault Megane achieves the full 5 star Euro NCAP making it the first small family car in Europe to do so. Renault has also re-entered the executive car sector with the Vel Satis, a five-door luxury hatchback. Citro√´n Saxo production is winding down after six years following the launch of the new C3 - a five-door hatchback. Saxo production will continue for another year until the launch of the new C2. The Eurovan venture between Peugeot, Citro√´n and Fiat has been renewed in an all-new format. Fiat retains the Ulysse nameplate, but the Citro√´n Synergie becomes the C8 and the Peugeot 806 becomes the 807. Left-hand drive markets will get the Lancia Phedra. Germany The Volkswagen Polo has been relaunched in a new fourth generation format, sharing its underpinnings with the ≈†koda Fabia that was launched two years ago. The BMW 7 Series is updated. A similarly styled update for the smaller 5 Series is due for next year. The latest Mercedes E Class is introduced, which looks very much like the smaller C Class and the larger S Class. Spain The third generation SEAT Ibiza goes on sale at the same time as the new Volkswagen Polo upon which it is mechanically based. A C√≥rdoba saloon version comes with a boot. Eastern Europe The six-year-old Volkswagen Passat design has been tweaked to become the Czech-built Superb. Japan Honda launched a new supermini, the Jazz. Honda also launched a new version of Accord large family car. The Nissan Micra has a new version with styling that blends modern and retro.

They also feature in the spin-off series Class, in the first series finale \\"The Lost\\" (2016). Since their initial appearance, they have been persistently nominated as one of the most popular and frightening Doctor Who monsters. Steven Moffat attributes their appeal to childhood games such as Grandmother's Footsteps and the notion that every statue might secretly be a disguised Weeping Angel. Description According to the Doctor, the Weeping Angels \\"are as old as the universe (or very nearly), but no one quite knows where they come from.\\" He also describes them as \\"the deadliest, most powerful, most malevolent life-form evolution has ever produced.\\" Weeping Angels are unusual as predators in that they neither kill nor directly parasitize their prey. Their usual mode of feeding is to make use of time paradoxes ‚Äì with a single touch, a Weeping Angel can send a person into the past to a point before his/her own birth, and can then feed off the \\"potential energy\\" of the years which that victim would have lived in the present. The Doctor describes the Weeping Angels as \\"the only psychopaths in the universe to kill you nicely\\" because their victims are otherwise uninjured and may live out long and potentially fulfilling lives in the past. The Cherubim angels, shown at the Doctor Who Experience. In their usual form, Weeping Angels resemble silent human-sized stone statues in the form of winged angels in draped clothing (such as might appear as tomb statuary in a Victorian graveyard). Apart from the wings, their standard form appears to mimic Earth humans (two arms, two legs, two eyes) even when they are infiltrating worlds on which the inhabitants differ from this form. Generally, their facial features are bland and serene and their proportions human-normal. However, as they close in on more aware victims they transform to a more horrific, bestial, and demonic aspect with wide-open mouths, vampiric teeth, and clawed hands. In the episode \\"The Angels Take Manhattan\\", another form of Weeping Angel is shown, the cherubim. Unlike the Weeping Angels, the cherubim are not silent, making a childlike giggling and having audible footsteps. It is not explicitly stated that these are young Weeping Angels, but they are referred to as \\"the babies\\". It is also implied that Weeping Angels can mimic the forms or dimensions of a broader range of statuary if required: in \\"The Angels Take Manhattan\\" (2012), one Weeping Angel takes the form (or hijacks the existing form) of the Statue of Liberty (manifesting as a full-size Liberty with Weeping Angel features) and the final moments of \\"Blink\\" (2007) suggest that any statue might be a disguised Weeping Angel. When they are not being observed by another being, Weeping Angels can move very quickly and silently. Their phenomenal speed allows them to close distances of meters literally in the blink of an eye. However, when they are being observed they become \\"quantum-locked\\", occupying a single position in space and becoming stone. In this state, they are frozen and difficult to destroy. They cannot suppress this reaction. If two Weeping Angels were to look at each other at the same time, they would be trapped in stone form until an outside force moves one out of the other's line of sight. To prevent this, they often cover their eyes while moving, which makes them look as though they are weeping. When stalking a victim, Weeping Angels will generally take advantage of their speed to avoid being trapped in the quantum lock. Weeping Angels are physically very strong, although they rarely physically kill a victim since this wastes the time-potential energy which the Weeping Angels would otherwise consume. One exception to this behaviour is when a Weeping Angel or group of Weeping Angels wishes to communicate with other beings ‚Äì in these instances, they select a victim and snap their neck prior to \\"rearranging the brains\\" for their own purposes; the Weeping Angels are then capable of speaking and conversing via their victim's voice and senses. In the Series 5 episode, \\"The Time of Angels\\" (2010), a soldier of the Church nicknamed \\"Angel Bob\\" suffers this fate, becoming the \\"voice\\" of a group of Weeping Angels and explaining their motives and thoughts to the Doctor before disappearing in the rip in the fabric of time and space. Weeping Angels appear to have little culture or motivation other than those serving their basic predatory requirement of gaining energy. The Doctor has described them as the loneliest beings in the universe since their quantum-lock reaction makes it impossible for them to socialise with other creatures. However, Weeping Angels are capable of communication, as they often work in groups and clearly communicate with each other. On those occasions when they have chosen to communicate with their prey or foes (using the gruesome proxy method mentioned above) they have demonstrated a cold and impersonal intelligence, but exhibit no empathy and no emotions beyond hunger, determination, and occasional predatory sadism. While Weeping Angels can recognise individuals in other species when the situation requires it, they themselves speak collectively and appear to have little or no concept of themselves as individuals. Weeping Angels prefer to take their energy from live victims, but if required, they can drain other forms such as that from electric lights (as seen in \\"Blink\\") or other electronics. In \\"Blink,\\" the Weeping Angels attempted to steal the Doctor's TARDIS after trapping him in the past. The engine of the vehicle contained enough time energy to feed them forever, but the Tenth Doctor stated that the possible damage they could cause \\"could switch off the sun\\". Without power, an Angel will start to decay and revert to a stone state even when not being watched. While still initially capable of movement, its speed will also be extremely hindered when close to a starvation point (as seen in \\"The Time of Angels\\"), with its range lessened from meters to a partial step. The effects of starvation can be undone by providing the Weeping Angel with energy, but it is implied that Weeping Angels can no longer acquire energy themselves in this state. A starving Weeping Angel becomes less and less active, and if dormant for too long will erode as a stone statue does, or even lose its physical existence altogether (although it can still exist in an image-based or conceptual state). Weeping Angels have also exhibited a startling ability to project themselves through images, suggesting that they are as much conceptual entities as physical ones. A warning in an ancient book on the Weeping Angels, found by River Song, states that \\"that which holds the image of an angel becomes itself an angel\\". Using this ability, the Weeping Angels appear to be able to hijack both audio-visual equipment and organic memory. In \\"The Time of Angels\\", a Weeping Angel trapped in the vault of the starship Byzantium took advantage of a video screen which was playing footage of it elsewhere in the vessel: the creature escaped by overriding the screen controls and nearby electronic equipment, took over the screen, and passed through it to physically manifest in another location. Weeping Angels can also imprint a mental image of themselves into a person's mind by looking straight into their eyes: the image then gestates and takes over the person's body to manifest as a new Weeping Angel. Amy Pond was infected in such a manner where an involuntary verbal count-down indicated her remaining open-eyed moments as a human. She was able to suspend the Weeping Angel's gestation (but not eliminate it) by closing her eyes, refusing to let it breach the \\"filter\\" of her optic nerve. In the novel Touched by an Angel, a starving angel is reduced to the point where it no longer has a physical being, and instead exists in the image viewed by cameras. As such, whatever is within the sight of the camera is within the range of the angel which retains fast movement, but at the cost of range. Normally, as in \\"The Time of Angels\\", the Weeping Angel image would walk right out of the screen; but when it is starving, it cannot do so. To stop movement, simply viewing the screen is enough to lock the Weeping Angel. The Weeping Angels are well known to River, who appeared in two of the three major stories to date. River has mentioned that she studied the Weeping Angels and wanted to learn more about them. In the Series 7 episode, \\"The Angels Take Manhattan\\", despite being removed from New York's history, a lone Weeping Angel gained a small victory in permanently trapping the Doctor's companions, Amy and her husband Rory Williams, in the past. In \\"The Time of the Doctor\\", the finale for the Eleventh Doctor, at least two Weeping Angels were present when the Doctor and Clara Oswald teleported down to the planet Trenzalore. The Weeping Angels emerged from the snow-covered ground of a frozen forest during a swirling blizzard; both Clara and the Doctor were thus blinded to their presence, unable to see them as they approached. They were, however, able to escape the angels despite this. The angels, like most of the villainous factions appearing in that episode, abandon Trenzalore when it becomes apparent that they cannot prevail against the Doctor. In the Series 9 finale episode, \\"Hell Bent\\", a Weeping Angel is shown to be in the cloisters of Gallifrey. A Weeping Angel briefly appears in the Doctor Who spin-off, Class, in the first series finale \\"The Lost\\", where the headmistress of Coal Hill Academy, Dorothea Ames, is killed by a Weeping Angel, as she was deemed to have made too many mistakes by the Governors. Appearances Angel of the Waters, one of the real-life angel statues appearing in the episode \\"The Angels Take Manhattan\\" Doctor Who * \\"Blink\\" (2007) * \\"The Time of Angels\\" / \\"Flesh and Stone\\" (2010) * \\"The Angels Take Manhattan\\" (2012) Cameos * \\"The God Complex\\" (2011) * \\"The Time of the Doctor\\" (2013) * \\"Hell Bent\\" (2015) Class * \\"The Lost\\" (2016) Details In \\"Blink\\", a quartet of Weeping Angels send the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) and his companion Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman) to the year 1969, and seek to feed off the vast \\"time energy\\" reserves of the TARDIS he left behind in the present. But though they found the key to the TARDIS, they cannot find the machine itself. Sally Sparrow (Carey Mulligan) takes the key from one of them while it is in stone form, leading them to stalk Sally to recover it. During their pursuit, Sally inadvertently leads them to the TARDIS. Eventually, the four Weeping Angels, having surrounded the TARDIS, are tricked into looking at each other when the box disappears, leaving them quantum locked in their stone forms forever. In \\"The End of Time\\", the President of the Time Lords, Rassilon (Timothy Dalton), refers to the two dissenters on the return of Gallifrey as being forced to stand like the Weeping Angels, and the two Time Lords are posed with their hands over their eyes. In the two-part story \\"The Time of Angels\\" and \\"Flesh and Stone\\", in the distant future, a large group of Weeping Angels have been trapped in a catacomb for centuries, slowly losing their form due to starvation. When a rogue angel causes a starship to crash into the catacomb, the Weeping Angels feed off its leaking radiation and revive. The Weeping Angels are seen moving on-screen for the first time when they realise that Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) cannot see them. They are defeated when they fall into a crack in time and are erased from existence. In \\"The Angels Take Manhattan\\", numerous Weeping Angels including one in the form of the Statue of Liberty have taken control of a building in New York, holding victims captive so they can repeatedly feed off their time energy. Amy and her husband, Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill), create a paradox by having Rory kill himself before he can be fed off to death. This paradox kills all but one of the Weeping Angels and erases the events from history. However, this surviving Weeping Angel encounters the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) and his companions in 2012 and sends Amy and Rory back in time, separating them from the Doctor forever. In \\"The Time of the Doctor\\", Weeping Angels are discovered on Trenzalore by Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman) buried in mounds of snow. After Clara touches the hand of the Weeping Angel, believing it to be a statue, the Weeping Angels start digging their way out of the snow and surround The Doctor and Clara, the snowstorm making it difficult for either Clara or the Doctor to keep eye contact. They escape by summoning the TARDIS with the TARDIS key which the Doctor has concealed in his wig. Later in the episode, another Weeping Angel (unspecified if it is one from earlier or not) is seen in the town of Christmas as one of the many species that have managed to bypass the forcefield around Trenzalore in an attempt to silence the Doctor. The Weeping Angel is seen staring into a mirror the Doctor has placed, thus remaining quantum-locked whilst it looks at its reflection.

The Daleks usually come out on top in such polls. Moray Laing, Editor of Doctor Who Adventures, praised the concept of escaping a monster by not blinking, something both simple and difficult to do. In a 2012 poll of over ten thousand respondents conducted by the Radio Times, the Weeping Angels were again voted the best Doctor Who monster with 49.4% of the vote. The Daleks came in second place with 17%. The Weeping Angels came in at number three in Neil Gaiman's \\"Top Ten New Classic Monsters\\" in Entertainment Weekly. They were also rated the third \\"baddie\\" in Doctor Who by The Telegraph, behind the Nestene Consciousness and Daleks. The Angels were listed as the third scariest television characters by TV Squad. In 2009, SFX named the climax of \\"Blink\\" with the Weeping Angels advancing on Sally and Larry the scariest moment in Doctor Who history. They also listed the Angels in their list of favourite things of the revival of Doctor Who, writing, \\"Scariest. Monsters. Ever.\\" \\"Blink\\" won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form in 2008. Popular culture Weeping Angel is the name of a hacking tool revealed in Vault 7, co-developed by the CIA and MI5, used to exploit smart TVs for the purpose of covert intelligence gathering. Once installed in a suitable TV, the tool enables the television to record its surroundings while appearing to be turned off (so-called \\"Fake-Off\\"). The tool was developed in 2014 as part of a joint CIA/MI5 workshop, and there's no evidence that it was ever operational. Quantum mechanics Weeping Angels are described as quantum-locked entities that do not exist if one attempts to observe them. Observation also plays an important role in the theory of quantum mechanics (see Schr√∂dinger's cat). Bell's theorem is a no-go theorem of quantum mechanics that concerns the existence or non-existence local hidden variables. It can be argued that hidden variables do not exist until they are observed.

Anyone with a problematic relationship with food is welcomed; OA's Third Tradition states that the only requirement for memberships is a desire to stop eating compulsively. OA was founded by Rozanne S. and two other women in January 1960. The organization's headquarters, or World Service Office, is located in Rio Rancho, New Mexico. Overeaters Anonymous estimates its membership at over 60,000 people in about 6,500 groups meeting in over 75 countries. OA has developed its own literature specifically for those who eat compulsively but also uses the Alcoholics Anonymous books Alcoholics Anonymous and Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions. The First Step of OA begins with the admission of powerlessness over food; the next eleven steps are intended to bring members \\"physical, emotional, and spiritual healing.\\"  Definitions  OA defines compulsions as \\"any impulse or feeling of being irresistibly driven toward the performance of some irrational action.\\" OA further defines compulsive overeating as a progressive, addictive illness. OA views compulsive overeating as a chronic condition and part of an attempt to alleviate psychological stress. Like other twelve-step programs, OA sees compulsive eating as a threefold illness, symbolically understanding human structure as having three dimensions: physical, mental and spiritual. Compulsive eating manifests itself in each dimension. A book describing itself as based on OA methods states that in the mental dimension a compulsive eater is not \\"eating down\\" feelings, but rather expressing an \\"inner hunger.\\" To help potential members decide whether or not they need the program, OA provides a questionnaire, asking questions such as, \\"Do you give too much time and thought to food?\\" Answering \\"yes\\" to three or more of these questions is considered a good indication of problems with which OA may be able to assist.  Abstinence in OA  ‚ÄúAbstinence in Overeaters Anonymous is the action of refraining from compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviors while working towards or maintaining a healthy body weight.‚Äù Frequently Asked Questions https://oa.org/newcomers/how-do-i- start/frequently-asked-questions/#7 This concept of abstinence has been criticized for its lack of specificity. While in AA abstinence means not drinking alcohol, some argue that it is not possible to set out specific foods, because OA's experience is that different people have different food triggers (i.e. foods and food behaviors that cause them to eat compulsively). While it is often said that alcoholics don't have to drink, but compulsive eaters still have to eat, Overeaters Anonymous responds by pointing out that alcoholics do have to drink, but cannot drink alcohol, just as compulsive eaters do have to eat, but cannot eat foods which cause compulsive eating. OA literature specifically defines \\"compulsion\\" as follows: \\"By definition, 'compulsion' means 'an impulse or feeling of being irresistibly driven toward the performance of some irrational action.'\\"Questions and Answers About Compulsive Overeating, available at http://www.oawny.org/about.htm#definition (last visited January 31, 2012). Therefore, \\"compulsive eating\\" and \\"compulsive food behaviors\\" (as those terms are used in OA's definition of abstinence) means irrational eating, or irrational food behaviors, taken as a result of an impulse or feeling that feels irresistible. So, according to Overeaters Anonymous, \\"abstinence\\" is the act of refraining from \\"compulsive eating\\" and \\"compulsive food behaviors,\\" while working towards or maintaining a healthy body weight. While this definition can fairly be described as nuanced and subject to personal interpretation (e.g., the definition of a \\"healthy body weight\\"), or requiring self-searching analysis (e.g., to determine the drivers of certain behaviors), it is not unspecific. The objective of OA's definition of abstinence is that the compulsive eater refrain not from eating, but rather, from compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviors, and work towards or maintain a healthy body weight. Thus, OA calls for the compulsive eater to define his or her own plan of eating which enables the compulsive eater to abstain from compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviors, while working towards or maintaining a healthy body weight. The program suggests that members identify the foods that \\"trigger\\" overeating. Since individuals are responsible to define their own plan of eating, they are able to change their plan of eating if their needs and understanding of their compulsions change, without that change constituting a breach of abstinence. Members are encouraged to seek counsel with other individuals before making such changes, generally including a member or members of the OA fellowship, to validate that the reasons are sound and not unwittingly a decision based on underlying compulsion.  Recovery tools and strategies  Comedores Compulsivos An√≥nimos (Overeaters Anonymous) group in Santiago de Compostela (Spain) The OA program is based on the twelve steps and twelve traditions of Alcoholics Anonymous. Small changes have been made to make these applicable to eating disorders, but such adaptation has been minimal. To take the twelve steps and practice the twelve traditions, OA program literature recommends using nine \\"Tools of Recovery.\\" These are A Plan of Eating, Sponsorship, Meetings, the Telephone, Writing, Literature, an Action Plan, Anonymity and Service. These tools are considered critical to obtaining and maintaining abstinence. Meetings offer a consensual validation and serve to diminish feelings of guilt and shame. A sponsor provides guidance through the OA program and support where necessary, but gradually encourages autonomy in the sponsee. A sponsor strives to make his or her job obsolete.  Food plans  In Overeaters Anonymous, abstinence is \\"the action of refraining from compulsive eating while working towards or maintaining a healthy body weight.\\" According to OA, \\"by definition, 'compulsion' means 'an impulse or feeling of being irresistibly driven toward the performance of some irrational action.'\\" OA has a long and complex history with \\"food plans\\" and does not endorse or recommend any specific plan of eating, nor does it exclude the personal use of one. OA recommends that each member consult a qualified health care professional, such as a physician or dietitian. OA publishes a pamphlet, Dignity of Choice, which assists in the design of an individual food plan and also provides six sample plans of eating (reviewed and approved by a licensed dietitian) with which some OA members have had success. Individual OA meetings and sponsors may make more detailed suggestions. Some of these caution against foods containing excessive sugar, caffeine and white flour. A qualitative analysis of bulimics recovering in OA found bulimic OA members with excessively rigid plans are less likely to remain abstinent. The researchers conducting the analysis suggested that new members begin with a somewhat rigid plan which becomes increasingly flexible by the end of a year in the program. An individual's plan of eating may call for the exclusion of certain triggering behaviors. For example, a person who knows that eating after a certain time in the evening triggers compulsive food behavior might include in their plan of eating a commitment to abstain from eating after that time of night; a person who knows that snacking between meals triggers compulsive food behavior would probably include in their plan of eating a commitment to abstain from chewing (or sucking) between meals.  Demographics  In 2002 a dissertation compared the results of a survey of 231 OA members in the Washington, DC area of North America undertaken in 2001 with the findings from surveys of OA members taken in 1981, twenty years previously. The 2001 survey showed that 84% of OA members identified as binge eaters, 15% as bulimic, and 1% as anorexic. The 1981 survey had found that 44.5% of OA members identified as binge eaters, 40.7% as bulimic, and 14.8% as anorexic. The survey also found an increase in the percentage of males in OA from 9% in 1981 to 16% in 2001. Both figures are generally in line with estimates made by the American Psychological Association that the male to female ratio of those with eating disorders ranges from 1:6 to 1:10. The researcher stated that the typical OA member in Washington was white and highly educated. The typical OA member surveyed in 2001 worked in a full-time capacity and homemakers only comprised 6% of the 2001 OA population, in contrast to 30% of those surveyed in 1981. This reflects the trend for increasing numbers of females to be employed outside of the home. Further, 80% of the 2001 participants had attained a college degree, compared to 59% of those surveyed in 1981. The percentage of OA members who were divorced or separated had risen from 10% in 1981 to 21% in 2001, also reflecting trends amongst the general population.  Correlations with maintaining abstinence  Research has identified a number of OA practices significantly correlating with maintaining abstinence in OA: adherence to a food plan (including weighing and measuring food), communication with other members (specifically sponsors), spending time in prayer and meditation, performing service work, completing the fourth step, completing the ninth step, writing down thoughts and feelings, attending meetings, reading OA/AA literature, and the educational status of the participant. Researchers have therefore concluded that application of OA practices might directly help promote abstinence and reduce the frequency of relapse in those with binge eating disorder and bulimia nervosa.  Honesty  Though not found in research to be significant, a number of OA members responded that honesty was a very important OA practice. Researchers have noted the high level of honesty at OA meetings and pointed out that working the Twelve Steps reinforces this quality.  Spirituality  Some researchers have found that in spite of its perceived high importance to the program spirituality does not correlate with measures of weight loss; others have found somewhat contradictory conclusions. In particular, an increased sense of spirituality was correlated with improvement in eating attitudes, fewer body shape concerns, and better psychological and social functioning. However, measures of religiosity and particular religious affiliations have never been found to correlate with treatment outcomes.  Demographic abstinence differences  Some research has found the average length of abstinence for bulimics in OA was significantly higher than the average length for binge eaters. Paradoxically, bulimics were also found to attend fewer meetings, and had less of a commitment to write their thoughts and feelings down daily. However, the frequency of relapse for bulimics and binge eaters was not significantly different. The differences may be explained by the predictable nature of the bulimic cycle. Other research has found binge eaters in OA had better success than bulimics. Most OA members who have reported negative experiences in the program are anorexic. This could be caused by OA's focus on problems of eating too much rather than too little. Some OA practices, such as refraining from eating certain kinds of foods, are antithetical in the case of anorexics.  Results  The average weight loss of participants in OA has been found to be . Survey results show that 90 percent of OA has responded that they have improved \\"somewhat, much, or very much\\" in their emotional, spiritual, career and social lives. OA's emphasis on group commitment and psychological and spiritual development provided a framework for developing positive, adaptive and self-nurturing treatment opportunities.  Changes in worldview  Changes in worldview are considered critical for individuals in the recovery process, as they are generally accompanied by significant behavioral changes. Accordingly, several researchers have identified worldview transformation in members of various self-help groups dealing with addiction issues. Such research describes \\"worldview\\" as four domains: experience of self, universal order (God), relationships with others and perception of the problem. In OA, members changed their beliefs that \\"it is bad to eat\\" to \\"one must eat to stay alive and should not feel guilty about it\\"; \\"one is simply overweight and needs to lose pounds\\" to \\"one has underlying psychological and interpersonal problems\\"; \\"one must deprecate oneself, deprive oneself, please other people\\" to \\"it is okay to express positive feelings about oneself and take care of one's needs\\"; \\"food is the answer to all problems, the source of solace\\" to \\"psychological and emotional needs should be fulfilled in relationships with people\\"; \\"I am a person who eats uncontrollably\\" to \\"I am someone who has limitations and does not eat what is harmful for me.\\"  Understanding of control  The act of binging and purging provides bulimics with the illusion that they can regain a sense of control. Binge eating has been described as a \\"futile attempt to restock depleted emotional stores, when attempts at doing everything perfectly have failed.\\" The self-destructive behavior of injecting intoxicating drugs parallels overeating; it permits the user to experience comfort, and to feel punished afterwards. In relationships, many OA members attested to trying to control their own lives and those of others. Paradoxically, an OA member's experience of themselves was also characterized by strong feelings of personal failure, dependence, despair, stress, nervousness, low self-esteem, powerlessness, lack of control, self-pity, frustration and loneliness. As part of these feelings, the self was perceived as being both a victim of circumstances and a victim of the attitude of others. Many members viewed this lack of self-esteem as deriving from their external appearance. Harsh self- criticism is a typical characteristic, accompanied by feelings of \\"I don't deserve it\\" and \\"I'm worth less than others.\\" Such feelings were found to have a dominant influence on relationships with others. Members describe their sense of relaxation and liberation, and the increasing value of restraint and modesty in their lives. Their testimonies show that, paradoxically, it is by becoming aware of their powerlessness and accepting the self's basic limitations that they begin to feel the recovering self's growing power. At the same time, personal responsibility replaces self-pity and the expectation that others will act for the good of the individual. With these old attitudes, egocentricity and exaggerated, false self-confidence perpetuate the problem which led them to join OA. While their eating disorder was active, many OA members claimed that their experience of self was composed of an obsessive aspiration for perfection which concealed their sense of worthlessness.  Comparisons  A significant difference between Twelve Step work and cognitive-behavioral therapy is the acceptance of a Higher Power and providing peer support. A large study, known as Project Match, compared the two approaches as well as motivational enhancement therapy in treating alcoholics. The Twelve Step programs were found to be more effective in promoting abstinence. However, some researchers have found that cognitive-behavioral therapy is the most effective treatment for bulimics. The two approaches are not mutually exclusive. OA is most appropriate for patients who need intensive emotional support in losing weight. Each OA group has its own character and prospective members should be encouraged to sample several groups.  Criticism  OA differs from group therapy in not allowing its participants to express their feelings about (and to) each other during meetings. OA meetings are intended to provide a forum for the expression of experience, strength and hope in an environment of safety and simplicity. However each member is encouraged to get a sponsor to help them with their feelings, etc. one-on-one.  Feminist  OA has been an object of feminist criticism for encouraging bulimic and binge-eating women to accept powerlessness over food. Feminists assert that the perception of powerlessness adversely affects women's struggle for empowerment; teaching people they are powerless encourages passivity and prevents binge eaters and bulimics from developing coping skills. These effects would be most devastating for women who have experienced oppression, distress and self-hatred. Twelve-step programs are described as predominantly male organizations which force female members to accept self-abasement, powerlessness and external focus, and reject responsibility. Surrender is described as women passively submitting their lives to male doctors, teachers and ministers; the feminist view suggests that women focus on pride instead of humility. OA contends that the context of powerlessness within the program isn't referring to an individual's flaws, but simply with the acceptance that they have a problem with food that they cannot seem to defeat with their unaided will. The slogan \\"We are powerless, not helpless,\\" is an example of this distinction. By accepting that they are powerless over certain things and thereby surrender the illusion of control, they are then able to make an honest appraisal and make clearer decisions about what they truly do control.  Fanaticism  Opponents of Twelve Step programs argue that members become cult-like in their adherence to the program, which can have a destructive influence, isolating those in the programs. Moreover this kind of fanaticism may lead to perception that other treatment modalities are unnecessary. Surveys of OA members have found that they exercise regularly, attend religious services, engage in individual psychotherapy and are being prescribed antidepressants. This is evidence that participants do not avoid other useful therapeutic interventions outside of Twelve Step programs.  Literature  OA also publishes the book Overeaters Anonymous (referred to as the \\"Brown Book\\"), The Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions of Overeaters Anonymous, For Today (a book of daily meditations), the OA Journal for Recovery, a monthly periodical known as Lifeline, and several other books.

It released in stores on August 21, 2007, despite being announced by the band's lead singer as coming out on July 24, 2007. It was officially completed at sometime around 8:00 p.m. on June 10, 2007, and features \\"Lose It\\" as the first single. Background Prior to the release of their debut album, Cartel were attracting major label attention. In September 2005, Chroma was released through independent label The Militia Group. Within a year, the group signed to major label Epic, and their debut album had sold over 100,000 copies. Sometime in 2006, Mediaedge:cia and True Entertainment contacted Dr Pepper with the concept of placing a band inside a bubble to record an album. In January 2007, Dr Pepper approached the band asking if they would like to participate. Around this time, a radio campaign was set up for potential second single \\"Say Anything (Else)\\". The group's label, however, said \\"We gotta do this (the bubble).\\" They went on further to explain, \\"If we take this momentum now and then dump a new record on top of it, we could probably blow it out.\\" Vocalist/guitarist Will Pugh pondered \\"the timing [with a second single] wasn't going to work out with the bubble. ... But they screwed the pooch with that record. Like, how could we not work more than one single? This is insane.\\" Recording On May 24, 2007, Cartel entered a giant glass bubble at Hudson River Park in New York. The bubble featured a modern recording studio, as well as a living area. On June 12, the group left the bubble and performed a 45-minute set outside it. This event, dubbed Band in a Bubble, lasted for 20 days and was filmed in its entirety. The band's progress was viewable via a four-episode series that aired on MTV, also called Band in a Bubble. The event was live streamed through a website via the use of 23 webcams. At the time, Pugh called the experience \\"the best thing to ever happen to us. A platform this big can show the world that real bands still exist. There's no outside producer, no hidden magic, just us writing and recording. It beats the heck out of being in college.\\" However, he later admitted that the event was a marketing stunt. Release On June 12, 2007, \\"Lose It\\" was released as a single. The group performed several gigs in July and August 2007, before going on tour with Nightmare of You and Weatherbox from August to October. Prior to it, Nightmare of You had to drop off the tour due to a medical emergency and were replaced by The Honorary Title. A music video was released for \\"Lose It\\" on August 9. Cartel was initially planned for release on July 24, before being released on August 21 through Epic. It was made available for streaming via PureVolume two days later. The Best Buy edition included three live-in-the-studio versions of \\"No Subject (Come with Me)\\", \\"This Is Who We Are\\" and \\"The Fortunate\\", while the iTunes version included \\"Get Away\\" as a bonus track. Reception The album received mixed reviews by critics. Prior to the album's release, Epic Records' digital media marketing Vice President Doug McVehil said the label \\"absolutely benefited from Dr Pepper's commitment to market our band alongside their soda\\". Following its release, the album debuted at number 20 on the U.S. Billboard 200, selling about 28,000 copies in its first week.Katie Hasty, \\"'High School Musical 2' Hangs On Atop Billboard 200\\" , Billboard.com, August 29, 2007.

John Coltrane only plays on two tracks, \\"Manifestation\\" and \\"Reverend King\\". Background In late January 1966, Coltrane and his group, which included saxophonist Pharoah Sanders, pianist Alice Coltrane (McCoy Tyner had left the group at the end of the previous year), bassist Jimmy Garrison, bassist / clarinetist Donald Rafael Garrett, and drummers Elvin Jones and Rashied Ali, arrived in San Francisco for a two- week gig at the Jazz Workshop, sharing the bill with Thelonious Monk's quartet. During the first week of their visit, Jones resigned from the band, joining Duke Ellington's group, and was replaced by Ray Appleton. Garrett also left for part of the gig. On February 2, the group (without Garrett, and with Appleton substituting for Jones), visited Coast Recorders in San Francisco, where they recorded a number of tracks, including \\"Manifestation\\" and \\"Reverend King.\\" \\"Manifestation\\" features solos by John Coltrane on tenor sax, Sanders on piccolo (returning later on tenor sax), and Alice Coltrane on piano. (It was Alice Coltrane's first recording with her husband.) \\"Reverend King\\" begins and ends with chants of \\"Aum-Mani-Pad-Mi-Hum\\" and features a solo by Sanders on tenor, as well as one of John Coltrane's few recorded appearances on bass clarinet. Tapes of these two tracks remained in the Coltranes' house until January 1968, roughly six months after John Coltrane's death, when Alice Coltrane decided to pair them with two tracks she recorded with her own group, \\"Lord, Help Me to Be\\" and \\"The Sun\\". These were her first recordings as a leader, and feature bassist Garrison and drummer Ben Riley, with Sanders appearing on tenor sax on \\"Lord, Help Me to Be\\" and briefly on flute on \\"The Sun\\". \\"The Sun\\" begins with a recording of John Coltrane and Sanders chanting \\"May there be peace and love and perfection throughout all creation,\\" and ends with John Coltrane's voice saying \\"Alice?\\" Both pieces were later released as bonus tracks on the CD reissue of Alice Coltrane's first solo album, A Monastic Trio. These four tracks were initially released as Cosmic Music on Coltrane Records in late 1968. However, representatives from Impulse! Records soon contacted Alice Coltrane, offering to include her as an Impulse! artist and suggesting that Cosmic Music be re-released on their label. She recalled: \\"Once [Cosmic Music] was available... the Impulse people said, 'Your ideas are fine, the music is good, but let us produce it. Let us have control of the artwork, and we'll put out a beautiful cover and music that's in your hands, and it'll be a very nice album and we also can get it out throughout the world.' There was no sense of someone coercing or whatever, or even trying to persuade me. It was just, 'If you would like, we can produce it very nicely for you.' And it was!\\" The album was reissued by Impulse! in 1969 with new cover art and with the co-credit \\"produced by Coltrane Records.\\" Two of the remaining tracks from the February 2, 1966 session appeared on Infinity with extensive editing and overdubbing, and one of the tracks also appeared on Jupiter Variation. Reception AllMusic reviewer Michael G. Nastos called Cosmic Music \\"emphatic, surging, and sometimes unfathomable.\\" Thom Jurek, also writing for AllMusic, wrote \\"While this record holds up quite well... it is still a minor Impulse album compared to some of the saxophonist's master works.\\" John Corbett included the album in his book Vinyl Freak: Love Letters to a Dying Medium, referring to \\"Manifestation\\" as \\"beautiful energy music, as Coltrane knew how to craft it\\" and expressing admiration for \\"Reverend King\\"'s \\"gloriously ecstatic bass clarinet ‚Äî another underdocumented facet of Trane‚Äôs recorded history ‚Äî and... joyous group interaction by the full ensemble.\\"  Track listing  # \\"Manifestation\\" (11:37) # \\"Lord, Help Me To Be\\" (7:29) # \\"Reverend King\\" (11:00) # \\"The Sun\\" (4:02) Tracks #1 and 3 recorded on February 2, 1966 at Coast Recorders, San Francisco, CA.

Early life and background  Sylva was born in Brass, Bayelsa (formerly Rivers State, of which Bayelsa State was split off from in 1996), and was educated there and in Lagos, the former capital of Nigeria. He was a member of the Rivers State House of Assembly in the 1990s.  Education  Sylva graduated from the University of Port Harcourt with distinction in English (Linguistics) in 1986. At the time, he was the best graduating student from his department and departmental valedictorian. He was subsequently awarded a Doctor in International Relations (Honoris causa) by the UBIS University in 2011.  Political career  Sylva's political career started in 1992 when he won a seat in the House of Assembly election representing Brass constituency in old Rivers State. At the time, he was the youngest of all the members in the house of Assembly. His political career continued when he was appointed as the Special Assistant to the Minister of State for Petroleum in 2004 under the auspices of Dr. Edmund Dakouru. He continued in that position until he resigned to join the PDP gubernatorial primaries in 2006 in Bayelsa State, in which he placed, second behind Dr. Goodluck Jonathan. After the PDP presidential primaries election and Dr. Jonathan was appointed as a running mate to HE Umaru Musa Yar‚Äôadua of blessed memory, the gubernatorial candidacy for PDP became vacant, and conventional wisdom took the better of the political actors and Sylva was elevated to occupy the position of PDP gubernatorial candidate. As a candidate of the People's Democratic Party Sylva won the Bayelsan gubernatorial election on May 29, 2007 and succeeded Goodluck Jonathan who went on to the position of Vice President. During his inauguration he said that Bayelsa was \\"the least developed industrially and commercially\\" of all 36 states. Sylva's opponent in the 2007 election, Ebitimi Amgbare of the Action Congress, legally challenged his victory. Although the Bayelsa State Election Petitions Tribunal upheld Sylva's election, Amgbare took the matter to the Appeal Court in Port Harcourt which overturned the Tribunal's decision and nullified Sylva's election on April 15, 2008. The Appeal Court's five justices were unanimous in their decision and ordered that Speaker Werinipre Seibarugo be sworn in to replace Sylva as acting Governor, with a new election to be held within three months.\\"Nigerian governor loses his job by court order\\" , Panapress (afrik.com), April 16, 2008.

The route is long, and it traverses Barren, Metcalfe, Cumberland, Clinton, Wayne, Pulaski, McCreary and Whitley Counties in southern Kentucky. It originates near the KY 70 junction with Interstate 65 in Cave City and ends at a junction with US 25W at Youngs Creek. Route description KY 90's western terminus at Cave City. Barren and Metcalfe Counties Kentucky Route 90 begins at Cave City at an intersection with KY 70, equipped with a traffic light, in the one part of the city where many restaurants, hotels, and gas stations are located. It is a major tourism hot- spot due to the close proximity to Mammoth Cave National Park, in nearby Edmonson County, along with few other attractions along KY 70 west of the city. Signs at the I-65 exit tend to imply that KY 90 ends at the exit itself, while state highway documents indicate that the end is at the intersection with KY 70, about from the exit proper. In spite of this, both KY 70 and KY 90 markers appear on the signage for Exit 53 of I-65. After KY 90's first mile, it intersects U.S. Route 31W, still within city limits of Cave City. KY 90 then heads into a south-southeasterly path to the Barren County seat, Glasgow, where it crosses the Veterans Outer Loop (US 68) passes the local Walmart and a local Marquee Cinema, and then has junctions with US Highways 31E and 68 Business, which is co-joined with Kentucky Route 80 in this area. It also has an intersection with US 31E's business loop at the Barren County courthouse. Before leaving the city of Glasgow, KY 90 has an intersection with the Louie B. Nunn Cumberland Parkway at the exit 14 interchange on the southeastern side of the city. After leaving Glasgow, the highway continues in a southeasterly fashion and passes through the small town of Eighty Eight, and then goes into southern Metcalfe County, and passes through Summer Shade. Cumberland and Clinton Counties KY 90 enters Cumberland County, and passes through Marrowbone and the county seat, Burkesville. After going through Burkesville, KY 90 turns due east, crosses the Cumberland River, and has intersections with short roads leading to Dale Hollow Lake State Park, and then goes into Clinton County, where, for about , it is co-joined with US 127, which is the core route of the annual World's Longest Yard Sale (a.k.a. The Highway 127 Corridor Sale), which takes place in early August. Wayne County and beyond KY 90 then goes through more rural areas and then into Wayne County where it intersects Kentucky Route 92 at Monticello. The state highway continues into a northeasterly course towards Mill Springs, the site of a famous Civil War battle site, and a mill built in 1877 (accessible via KY 1275). It enters the southern portion of Pulaski County. The highway's concurrency with US 27 begins after KY 90 crosses the Cumberland River for a second time (at that point part of Lake Cumberland) near Burnside, Kentucky. KY 90 runs concurrently with U.S. 27 for about 14.6 miles (23.5 km) from Burnside to Parkers Lake. Early in this stretch of road is the gateway to General Burnside State Park; it later enters the Daniel Boone National Forest. After departing US 27 in northern McCreary County, KY 90 is the main route that accesses Cumberland Falls State Resort Park. It crosses the Cumberland River a third time just upstream and around a bend from the falls. At the route's terminus in the Whitley County community of Young's Creek, there is a 0.32 mile-long (0.51 km) spur called KY 90S that serves as a secondary entrance to the highway for traffic going southbound on U.S. 25W. The road is signed as KY 90. Points of interest along the route These are points of interest that can be accessible along this route: * Mammoth Cave Wildlife Museum at Cave City. * Roadside Park in Marrowbone, Kentucky once served as a hospital camp for both the Union and Confederate soldiers during the Civil War. * Seventy Six Falls (accessible via KY 704), is a waterfall along the shoreline of Lake Cumberland in northern Clinton County.Seventy Six Falls, KY * Mill Springs Mill (Wayne County) (accessible via KY 1275).Mill Springs Mill - Monticello, Kentucky * General Burnside State Park near Burnside. *Cumberland Falls State Resort Park at the McCreary/Whitley County line.

Appalachian Regional Commission. September 2, 2013. Retrieved October 31, 2017. History The early days (1929-1960) KY 90 was established in 1929 as one of the charter routes of the Kentucky State Highway System. The highway's original western terminus was located in downtown Glasgow at a junction with KY 80 (which at the time was not co-signed with US 68 in this area until the 1940s). Along the route, it connected to certain areas via two ferries, one at Burkesville, and the other at the Whitley/McCreary County line near Cumberland Falls. KY 90's eastern terminus was at a junction with US 25W, but at the time it was in downtown Corbin at the Whitley/Laurel County line. Sometime between 1940 and 1955, US 25W was rerouted to its current route, and KY 90's eastern end was relocated to an area between Corbin and Cumberland Falls. A bridge near the falls was built sometime during that time frame so KY 90 traffic would not be bombarded with rapids that affected ferry service. Also during the 1950s, KY 90 was extended northwestward from its previous terminus in downtown Glasgow, to a junction with U.S. Route 31W, which at the time was south of Cave City. The road that KY 90 took over, Happy Valley Road, was previously signed as Kentucky Route 351. The modern days (1960-present) At sometime between 1969 and 1973, KY 90 from the KY 685 junction to US 31W was rerouted to make KY 90 go directly into Cave City. KY 90's western terminus was also relocated to its current west end at a then-new junction with KY 70 near the I-65 exit 53 interchange, thus extending KY 90 by another , and providing westbound KY 90 traffic direct access to I-65. In 2013, KY 90 between the Cumberland Parkway junction and the Eighty Eight community was reconstructed to add truck-climbing lanes in two spots. Reconstruction of KY 90 continued from that area to the Metcalfe County line, and was completed by Fall 2015. In September and October 2014, the first of KY 90, along with the KY 70 overpass over I-65 (the latter of which began in 2013), were both reconstructed and were widened to four lanes, plus a center lane for left turns. Some talks between the KYTC and Stantec are taking place to widen an stretch of KY 90 from Cave City to Glasgow to either a 2+1 type of road (two lanes plus the turning lane in the center) or a complete 4-laner with a median. Plans for it are still yet to be placed on the agenda. Opinions of locals are being used for consideration before the project even happens.French, Jackson (June 29, 2016). \\"Kentucky Transportation Cabinet hears public comments on planned KY 90 widening\\".

It is found in soil, air, and plants as a leaf pathogen. It can occur as an endophyte where it produces antiviral and antifungal secondary metabolites. Sporulation of N. sphaerica causes its initial white coloured colonies to rapidly turn black. N. sphaerica is often confused with the closely related species N. oryzae due to their morphological similarities. History N. sphaerica was first identified by E. W. Mason in 1927. In 1913, S. F. Ashby and E. F. Shepherd isolated fungal cultures from banana plants and sugarcane, respectively, which were classified under the genus Nigrospora due to its morphology. Mason studied these cultures and noticed the persistent appearance of two distinct mean spore sizes. The persistence of the division in spore size led to the classification, by Mason, of the larger spore isolates as N. sphaerica, and the smaller isolates as N. oryzae. Since its classification in 1927, it has been under the class Sordariomycetes. Growth and morphology N. sphaerica colonies grow rapidly and appear hairy or woolly. The conidiophores are short and clustered surfacing from mycelium. They appear translucent in colour and have an average range of 8-11Œºm in diameter. The conidiophores are often straight stalks or slightly curved. Conidia grow from the tips of the translucent conidiophores. The conidia are brownish black, oblate spheroid, and single celled. On average they range from 16-18Œºm in diameter. The initial white translucent looking colony of N. sphaerica turns brown/black due to mass sporulation of conidia from the conidiophores. In laboratories, N. sphaerica is grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) at room temperature. Habitat and ecology N. sphaerica is commonly found in air, soil, various plants, and some cereal grains. It is rarely found in indoor environments. N. sphaerica has been identified in many areas around the world, however it is most prevalent in tropical and subtropical countries. A study shows N. sphaerica to be the most abundant airborne fungal species found in various urban sites in Singapore. Air samples were collected using an RCS microbial air sampler. Fungal spores trapped on the agar strips were developed and counted. They were then cultured into isolates allowing for identification by morphology. Results showed N. sphaerica with the highest spore counts at ground levels and low altitudes around 40m. During asexual reproduction N. sphaerica releases spores known as conidia. The conidia are ejected out forcefully at maximum horizontal distances of 6.7 cm, and 2 cm vertically. Discharge of spores occurs in all directions. The mechanism for projection relies on the conidiophore consisting of a flask-shaped support cell that bears the conidium. Liquid from the support cell squirts through the supporting cell projecting the spore outwards. This characteristic of forcible spore discharge is rarely seen in hyphomycetes. N. sphaerica requires moisture to release spores into the air, therefore accumulation begins around 2:00 a.m. with peak time of abundance occurring around 10:00 a.m. Spore count rapidly decreases after 10:00 a.m. and remains low throughout the day. Plant pathogenicity Decaying plants is one of the most common places where N. sphaerica is found. Many studies around the world found N. sphaerica as a leaf pathogen. N. sphaerica was isolated from various plants displaying leaf spots. These reported cases reveal newly identified plant hosts for the pathogen N. sphaerica that have been validated through Koch‚Äôs postulates. The fungus causes a progressively fatal leaf spot diseases of a range of plants including blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum), licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra), and Wisteria sinensis (Chinese Wisteria). Initial lesions resemble small red spots around 2-5 mm particularly near the tips and edges of leaves, eventually resulting in complete defoliation. The fungus also causes a blight disease of the commercial tea plant, Camellia sinensis. Symptoms of blight was observed in commercial tea estates in Darjeeling, India. The disease affected plants of all ages, being especially pronounced in younger plants. Fungal colonies displayed an initial white colour that eventually turned gray/brown. Based on these morphological characteristics, N. sphaerica was identified as the fungal pathogen. Inoculation of the pathogen using conidial suspension spray, and re- isolation of N. sphaerica satisfied Koch‚Äôs postulates. rRNA sequence comparison of the ITS region confirmed N. sphaerica identity. Cases of leaf spot disease of kiwi fruit (Actinidia deliciosa) have been reported from orchards in Huangshan, Anhui Provence, China. Infected leaves browned and defoliated. Conidia morphology and culture properties suggested N. sphaerica as the etiological agent, later confirmed by Koch‚Äôs postulates and ITS identification. Human pathogenicity Often the common response to N. sphaerica in humans is hay fever or asthma. N. sphaerica is not widely considered a true human pathogen, however there are various reported cases of Nigrospora species in human eye and skin infections. Of those, there have only been a handful of reported cases of N. sphaerica infection in human. One specific case study identified N. sphaerica as the cause of an onychomycosis case in a 21-year-old man. Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail. Fungal spores found in the body of the nail resembled the characteristic morphology of N. sphaerica. DNA sequence analysis further confirmed the identity. Another case found N. sphaerica isolated from a corneal ulcer. A woman in south India was diagnosed with a fungal corneal ulcer after being hit in the eye from a cow‚Äôs tail. Analysis of corneal scrapings showed presence of hyphae elements suggesting cause of ulcer from a fungal pathogen. Isolated cultures were grown and examined. Conidia and colony characteristics of the culture led to identification of N. sphaerica as the fungal pathogen. It was hypothesized that this special case of fungal corneal ulcer was caused by transfer of spores to the patients eye from contamination with soil (a common habitat of the fungus) or other matter from the cow‚Äôs tail. Secondary metabolites Although N. sphaerica is often considered as a pathogen, it can also act as an endophyte depending on its host. Various studies have identified novel metabolites isolated from N. sphaerica. Some of these metabolites act as phytotoxins, while others contain antiviral or antifungal properties. The purpose of the production of many of these metabolites by the fungus are not fully understood or still unknown and is an area that needs to be further studied. Aphidicolin is a mycotoxin originally known to be produced by the fungus, Cephalosporium aphidicola. This antiviral compound was isolated in mycelium culture filtrate of N. sphaerica. Epoxyexserophilone is a metabolite similar to the phytotoxin, exserohilone. Fermentation of N. sphaerica led to the production of epoxyexserophilone. Etiolated wheat coleoptile bioassay indicated that the compound is biologically inactive, and ineffective against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Nigrosporolide is a 14-membered lactone produced by N. sphaerica. It is structurally related to the phytotoxic metabolite, seiricuprolide, which is produced by the fungus, Seiridium cupressi. The compound is shown to fully inhibit growth of etiolated wheat coleoptiles, at concentrations of 10‚àí3M. Phomalactone (5,6-dihydro-5-hydroxy-6-prop-2-enyl-2H-pyran-2-one) is found to be produced by N. sphaerica. It inhibits mycelial growth of plant pathogenic fungi, Phytophthora infestans. The metabolite also inhibits sporangium and zoospore germination of both P. infestans and Phytophthora capsici. The study also shows that the metabolite reduces progression of late blight disease in tomatoes caused by P. infestans.

Gannet was laid down 1 October 1918 by the Todd Shipyard Corp., New York; launched 19 March 1919; sponsored by Miss Edna Mae Fry; and commissioned at the New York Navy Yard 10 July 1919, Lt. John E. Armstrong in command.  Post-World War I operations  Gannet departed New York 11 August 1919 and reached San Diego, California, 2 November after training out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A unit of the Train, Pacific Fleet, she based at San Diego and was subsequently assigned to Aircraft Squadron, Battle Fleet, and later to Base Force, U.S. Fleet. Serving primarily as a tender to aircraft squadrons, she also performed towing, transport, and passenger service along the western seaboard, and made periodic cruises as tender to aircraft units participating in Army-Navy exercises, fleet problems, and maneuvers off Hawaii, the Panama Canal, and in the Caribbean Sea. She spent the summer months of 1926, 1929, and 1932-35 as tender to aerial survey expeditions to Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. On 30 April 1931 Gannet was designated a minesweeper for duty with aircraft. She was reclassified AVP-8, 22 January 1936.  U.S. East Coast operations  Gannet departed San Diego, California, 18 August 1937 and based at Coco Solo, Panama, as tender for aircraft squadrons of the Scouting Force until 1 June 1939. Arriving Norfolk, Virginia, 9 June, she then became tender to Patrol Wing 5, Aircraft Scouting Force. In a series of cruises from Norfolk, she tended Navy patrol planes based at Key West, Florida, Bermuda, Santa Lucia, and Trinidad; then steamed north 22 September 1941 to establish an advance seaplane base at Kungnait Bay, Greenland (6 October ‚Äì 23 October). She served on plane guard station in the Davis Strait for an Iceland-Argentia ferry flight before returning to Norfolk 11 November.  World War II Atlantic Theatre operations  Gannet was tending patrol planes at Hamilton, Bermuda, when the Japanese struck Pearl Harbor. She returned to Norfolk, Virginia, 12 December and sailed 21 January 1942 for Bermuda to serve as tender to Patrol Squadron 74 (VP-74), which provided air patrol and coverage in approaches to that base. Gannet also was communication center for all aircraft operations in that area.  Torpedoed by German submarine  Departing Bermuda 2 June, Gannet joined British ship HMS Sumar the next day in an unsuccessful search for the torpedoed merchantman . Ordered back to base the afternoon of 6 June, the two warships became separated during the night.

The formation is composed of Army Reserve units within the province of Alberta and the Northwest Territories. The headquarters of the brigade is in Calgary. The brigade has an establishment of 2,500 all ranks. The role of the Army Reserve is to be \\"a professional part-time force that provides local engagement and a responsive integrated capability, at home or abroad, in sustainment of the Army mission.\\" Most of the soldiers within the brigade serve part time in units or sub-units stationed in their communities. As the Canadian Army generates task-specific units for employment on expeditionary and domestic operations under the command of the Canadian Joint Operations Command, 41 CBG, as a force generator, is tasked with the following: # On order provide general-purpose, combat-capable soldiers and specialist sub-subunits (troops or platoons) capable of augmenting the Regular Force on expeditionary operations; and # On order provide a domestic response unit (Territorial Battalion Group), sub-units (Direct Response Companies), or sub-sub-units (Direct Response Platoons or Local Response Platoons) capable of augmenting the Regular Force on domestic operations.

Black or Magellanic woodpecker Alerce Costero National Park (, ) is a protected wild area in the Cordillera Pelada about from Valdivia and from La Uni√≥n. Fitzroya trees grow inside the protected area and give the area its name, with Alerce Costero translating as Coastal Fitzroya. The Natural Monument has a total area of . History Alerce Costero National Park has its origins in the National Monument Alerce Costero, created on January 3, 1987, by the Chilean government. In 2012 the area was elevated to national park status and was renamed Alerce Costero National Park (Spanish: Parque Nacional Alerce Costero). The new national park is the result of a public- private collaboration that united the state-owned Alerce Costero National Monument, Valdivia National Reserve and Quitaluto estate with land donated by The Nature Conservancy, which also owns the adjacent Valdivian Coastal Reserve. Details The park is administered by CONAF (the Chilean National Forest Corporation), has a total surface area of , and rises to a maximum altitude of . The geography of the park make it suitable for many species of endemic birds and mammals with very specific habitat requirement. One of the goals of the park is to protect the Valdivian temperate rain forest and help maintain Chaihu√≠n river basin, an important watercourse in the region, while also protecting the Chaihu√≠n community that depend on the river. The unique ecosystem of the southern Chilean Coast Range and Valdivian temperate rain forest makes this a priority site for biodiversity conservation. The mountainous area served as a refuge from the devastating effects of the last glaciation which occurred during the Quaternary Period, and more recently from the effects of volcanic activity. It has not, however, been kept safe human activity and is today classes as a threatened area. From about 1750 to 1943, when the land between Maull√≠n River and Valdivia was colonized by Spain and then Chile, numerous fires of Fitzroya woods occurred in Cordillera Pelada. These fires were initiated by Spaniards, Chileans and Europeans. Earlier, from 1397 to 1750 the Fitzroya woods of Cordillera Pelada also suffered from fires that originated from lightning strikes and indigenous inhabitants. Climate The area of Valdivia and the Los R√≠os Region has a rainy temperate climate, with rains all year round. The park is slightly warmer than the rest of the region, with an average annual temperature of 12¬∞ Celsius and temperatures ranging from being in January and the in July. Location and access Fitzroya forest at Alerce Costero National Park, Chile. The park is part of the Valdivian temperate rain forest, and located in the Coastal Range of the communes of Corral and La Uni√≥n. There are works in progress to improve access to the park but the use of four wheel drive vehicles is currently recommended. ; Access from Corral The main access is route T-80 that runs from Corral to the seaside village of Hueicolla. The road consists of of gravel and of dirt road, suitable only for off-road vehicles or mountain bikes. There is an alternative route for standard vehicles via the road joining La Uni√≥n and Santa Elisa in the Cumleufu area. Other ways of accessing the park from Corral (all suitable for four wheel drives and mountain bikes only) include: * 1C Access: West entrance, approaching from the town of Chaihu√≠n in Corral commune, towards the Catrileufu zone that used to be part of the former Valdivia National Reserve. * 2C Access: North entrance from Corral, following route T- 470, to the Quitaluto-Catrilelfu zone. * 3C Access: North entrance from the town of Morro Gonzalo Corral in the commune of the Quitaluto. * 4C Access: Entrance from route T-60 via the Valdivia ‚Äì La Union Highway (Route T -640) in the Tres Chiflones zone, toward La Romaza by a dirt road. ; Accesses from La Uni√≥n * 1U access: South entrance from the town of Santa Elisa in the commune of La Uni√≥n to the La Romaza area,. The road is in good condition and suitable for all vehicles. * 2U Access: Entrance via route T-80 from La Uni√≥n to the Alto Mirador area. The gravel road is in good condition and is suitable for all vehicles. There is also a river access from the Chaihu√≠n river and a four wheel drive route that runs from the coast via route T-470 to Hueicolla, and from there to route T-80. Main features and activities Entry to the park is free, and it is open daily from 9:00 to 20:00. As its name suggests, one of the main features of the park are the ancient Fitzroya trees, some of which are thousands of years old, especially in the southern area of the park. The evergreen forest has burnt out patches where forest fires have left their mark, which have given the area its alternative name: \\"Cordillera Pelada\\" or \\"Bald Mountains.\\" The park is suitable for hiking and horseback riding, and has several viewpoints and places to observe the flora, fauna and landscapes. The park is a particularly popular site for mountain biking. In the north area (Catrilelfu, Las Romazas) there is a CONAF office with park rangers, tourist information and safety advice. Toilets and trash cans are located around the park. The park has two short official trail routes, both located in the southern part, although more than of further trails are being explored and equipped for visitors. * The 1,800 \\"Alerce Milenario\\" (Ancient Fitzroya) route leads to a 3,000-year-old, Fitzroya tree. * The \\"Piedra del Indio\\" (Indian Stone) route leads to an area with views of the mountain range and river. Here can be found examples of ‚ÄúCipr√©s de las Guaitecas‚Äù or (Pilgerodendron). There is a camping zone with some equipment such as tables, a wooden shelter, and information.

He was the Speaker for his last two-year term, 2005--2007\\\\. Prior to 2005, he had been the House Majority Leader. In Wyoming, Speakers traditionally retire from the House upon the expiration of their tenure as presiding officer. Luthi was thereafter named by Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne as the Director of the Minerals Management Service. Luthi formerly served in the United States Department of the Interior during the administration of Presidents Ronald W. Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush. The first Bush transferred him to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Since 2000, Luthi has been a partner in the Luthi and Voyles law firm in Thayne. Since 1993, he has also been a managing partner of the JE Luthi Ranch, a beef cattle operation in Lincoln County. From 1990--1993, he served in Washington, D.C., in career positions as Senior Counselor for Environmental Regulations in NOAA's Office of General Counsel. Earlier, he was an attorney in the Interior Department Office of the Solicitor from 1986--1990\\\\. In 2007, President George W. Bush named Luthi Deputy Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. On July 23, 2007, the administration appointed him head of the Minerals Management Services where he remained until January, 2009. On March 1, 2010, Luthi became president of the National Ocean Industries Association (NOIA), a Washington, D.C. based political action committee representing \\"the companies that develop the nation‚Äôs valuable offshore energy resources.\\" . As NOIA president, Luthi wrote to the acting director of the Minerals Management Service on June 7, 2010, advocating rapid clarification of offshore drilling rules because \\"it is not a time for a lengthy and undefined ban or suspension on all drilling.\\" Luthi is considered an authority on royalties paid to the U.S. government by companies which produce energy from the public domain, both on land and water. From his legislative service, Luthi was instrumental in the formulation of state budgets which relied heavily upon royalties and severance taxes paid by energy companies operating on federal leases. He was also a legislative member of the Energy Council, an organization of legislative representatives from energy-producing states and Canadian provinces and private energy-related industries. The council meets quarterly to consider the latest developments in energy matters. Luthi formerly worked as a legislative assistant in the office of former U.S. Senator Alan K. Simpson of Cody. He provided counsel on legal and legislative issues including oil and natural gas taxation. He later transferred to the office of then U.S. Representative Richard B. Cheney of Wyoming, later Vice President of the United States. Luthi received a bachelor of science degree in law enforcement in 1979 from the University of Wyoming at Laramie. He procured his Juris Doctor law degree from UW in 1982. In June 2007, upon the death of U.S. Senator Craig Thomas, Luthi was among thirty applicants for appointment to fill the vacancy until a special election is held on November 4, 2008. Luthi was not chosen by the Republican State Central Committee as one of the three finalists to be considered for appointment by the state's governor, Democrat Dave Freudenthal. Luthi tied for fifth place on the second ballot and lost a tie-breaking vote. In September 2008, Democratic Senator Bill Nelson of Florida called upon Luthi to resign from the Minerals Management Service because of a sex, drug, and oil scandal at the service that occurred between 2002 and 2006, before Luthi became director.

The module was published in 1982 by TSR, Inc. for the first edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rules. It formed the first of the three-part Desert of Desolation module series. The module was written by Tracy and Laura Hickman; Tracy Hickman would later go on to help create the Dragonlance campaign setting. Plot summary The original Daystar West edition of the scenario involves a tomb which is rumored to be theft-proof. At the start of the adventure, the player characters are confronted by the ghost of a long- dead Pharaoh, cursed to wander the sands of his now-deserted land for time on end, in search of the ones who can break the curse and free him from this world. The characters soon find themselves searching for items which will end the curse and bring them wealth and power. There are five levels to explore in the pyramid, and a large exterior temple. The TSR version of Pharaoh is an Egyptian-styled adventure that includes a pyramid map and a trap-filled maze. In Pharaoh, the player characters (PCs) are driven into the desert for a crime they did not commit. The characters journey to the sunken city of Pazar and from there must travel to the haunted tomb of an ancient pharaoh. While in the desert, the characters encounter the spirit of Amun-Re, a pharaoh cursed to wander the desert until his tomb is robbed. Amun-Re begs the PCs to remove his staff of ruling and Star Gem from his tomb to break his curse. The tomb was built to be thief-proof and has so far lived up to its reputation. While in Amun-Re's pyramid, the characters can use an item called the dome of flight to control or reverse gravity; carelessness can cause them to fall upwards. The palm trees in this room bear exploding fruit. The characters also encounter a maze with numerous traps. The module contains wilderness maps, and a number of smaller adventures as well. Publication history In 1977, Tracy Hickman (co-creator of the Dragonlance campaign setting) and Laura Hickman were married. Soon after, while living in Provo, Utah, they wrote the adventures Pharaoh and Ravenloft. The Hickmans decided to privately publish the first two adventures they had designed together, Rahasia and Pharaoh, which earned them a reputation on a local level. Pharaoh was published as part of the \\"Night Ventures\\" line of scenarios in 1980, by DayStar West Media Productions, as a sixty-eight-page book. The module was designed to be played and completed with a satisfactory conclusion with a couple of sessions of playing time. However, disaster struck when Tracy went into business with an associate who went bad, leaving the Hickmans to cover thirty-thousand dollars in bad checks. They were driven into bankruptcy, and Tracy Hickman decided to sell their modules to TSR, \\"literally so that I could buy shoes for my children\\". TSR decided not only to buy the modules, but hire Tracy as a game designer: : \\"They said it would be easier to publish my adventures if I was part of the company. So, we made the move from Utah to Wisconsin.\\" In 1982, TSR published Pharaoh as a thirty-two-page booklet with two outer folders, for the first edition of AD&D.; It was designed for 6-8 player characters of levels 5-7 and formed the first of the three-part Desert of Desolation module series. The cover art for Pharaoh was provided by Jim Holloway.Tracy and Laura Hickman. Pharaoh (TSR, 1982), Tracy Hickman noted that the module Pharaoh can teach positive lessons about the concepts of good to youth, saying of the eponymous Pharaoh character, the \\"apparent misery to which this figure was condemned by his own lust for wealth continues to teach the value of deeds over possessions to all who play that game today.\\"Ethics in Fantasy: Morality and D&D; Part 2 at TRHickman.com Reception Harley Bates reviewed the Daystar West edition of the adventure in The Space Gamer No. 54. He commented that \\"It's a nice break from standard ongoing campaigns, and gives both players and judges attainable goals in shorter steps.\\" Bates added that \\"The inhabitants of the tomb are far from the ordinary fare and provide the players and the judge with fascinating role-playing. There are many clues and puzzles scattered throughout the adventure. All in all, it's a very tightly-woven adventure which should be enjoyable for all involved.\\" He criticized that \\"The only real flaw is that there are too many typographical errors. Most of the play supplements available today suffer from this. Couldn't designers and publishers spend just a little more time proofreading?\\" Bates concluded his review by stating: \\"Given the overall quality we are presented in this product, the typos can be overlooked [...] It's a great buy, considering the time, effort, and thought evident throughout.\\" Dungeon Master for Dummies lists Pharaoh as one of the ten best classic adventures. Doug Cowie reviewed Pharaoh very favorably for Imagine magazine. He noted the \\"first rate cover art\\" and the overall \\"value- for-money feel\\" of the module. He also praised the well-designed layout and the standardized approach to describing encounter areas. Cowie expected that those who played this \\"dangerous, tricky and entertaining\\" module would wish to continue with the sequels I4 and I5. One month later, Doug Cowie also reviewed Oasis of the White Palm favorably for Imagine magazine. He found it a ‚Äútough test‚Äù for the players and praised the ‚Äúfirst rate cover art‚Äù and ‚Äúlively illustrations‚Äù inside. Cowie found I4 a ‚Äúmainstream AD&D; adventure with plenty of treasure, traps and tricks‚Äù situated mostly in ‚Äútraditional room/corridor environments‚Äù. But according to him it also offers ‚Äúplenty of interesting goings-on between NPC individuals and groups‚Äù so that the players find themselves in a ‚Äúdynamic society‚Äù. Cowie cautioned that some encounters are quite complicated so the DM needs to study the module closely before running it. Cowie felt I4 to be an ‚Äúexcellent, varied module‚Äù that offered ‚Äúexcitement, depth and tension‚Äù. He concluded his review by calling it ‚Äúa must for those who have played I3 and highly recommended for anyone else.‚Äù Pharaoh and Oasis of the White Palm were reviewed in White Dwarf, No. 45 by Jim Bambra, who gave both modules 10 of out 10 overall. Bambra felt that Pharaoh involved \\"some excellent adventure situations,\\" and said that the \\"design of the pyramid is very imaginative and the use of wall carvings to provide background information to the adventure really brings it to life making it more than just a collection of rooms.\\" He felt that the presentation of both modules was excellent, and liked the new format, which utilized a short paragraph to quickly describe how the adventure should be run. He felt that this system, which also included distinct listings of traps, tricks, monsters, and treasure, \\"makes it far easier to find information quickly and reduced the chance of leaving something important out in the heat of play.\\" Bambra concluded by stating that these \\"are both excellent adventures, they are imaginative, colourful and challenging.\\" The module was considered as a milestone in dungeon design because since that moment they needed to have ¬´ an overarching, cohesive plot, usually with epic overtones. Dungeons were not silly little mazes, but structures that made sense architecturally.

The character of Hamlet played a critical role in Sigmund Freud's explanation of the Oedipus complex. Even within the narrower field of literature, the play's influence has been strong. As Foakes writes, \\"No other character's name in Shakespeare's plays, and few in literature, have come to embody an attitude to life ... and been converted into a noun in this way.\\" History Renaissance period Interpretations of Hamlet in Shakespeare's day were very concerned with the play's portrayal of madness. The play was also often portrayed more violently than in later times. The play's contemporary popularity is suggested both by the five quartos that appeared in Shakespeare's lifetime and by frequent contemporary references (though at least some of these could be to the so-called ur-Hamlet). These allusions suggest that by the early Jacobean period the play was famous for the ghost and for its dramatization of melancholy and insanity. The procession of mad courtiers and ladies in Jacobean and Caroline drama frequently appears indebted to Hamlet. Other aspects of the play were also remembered. Looking back on Renaissance drama in 1655, Abraham Wright lauds the humor of the gravediggers' scene, although he suggests that Shakespeare was outdone by Thomas Randolph, whose farcical comedy The Jealous Lovers features both a travesty of Ophelia and a graveyard scene. There is some scholarly speculation that Hamlet may have been censored during this period: see Contexts: Religious below. Theatres were closed under the Puritan Commonwealth, which ran from 1640‚Äì1660. Restoration When the monarchy was restored in 1660, theatres re-opened. Early interpretations of the play, from the late 17th to early 18th century, typically showed Prince Hamlet as a heroic figure. Critics responded to Hamlet in terms of the same dichotomy that shaped all responses to Shakespeare during the period. On the one hand, Shakespeare was seen as primitive and untutored, both in comparison to later English dramatists such as Fletcher and especially when measured against the neoclassical ideals of art brought back from France with the Restoration. On the other, Shakespeare remained popular not just with mass audiences but even with the very critics made uncomfortable by his ignorance of Aristotle's unities and decorum. Thus, critics considered Hamlet in a milieu which abundantly demonstrated the play's dramatic viability. John Evelyn saw the play in 1661, and in his Diary he deplored the play's violation of the unities of time and place. Yet by the end of the period, John Downes noted that Hamlet was staged more frequently and profitably than any other play in Betterton's repertory. In addition to Hamlet's worth as a tragic hero, Restoration critics focused on the qualities of Shakespeare's language and, above all, on the question of tragic decorum. Critics disparaged the indecorous range of Shakespeare's language, with Polonius's fondness for puns and Hamlet's use of \\"mean\\" (i.e., low) expressions such as \\"there's the rub\\" receiving particular attention. Even more important was the question of decorum, which in the case of Hamlet focused on the play's violation of tragic unity of time and place, and on the characters. Jeremy Collier attacked the play on both counts in his Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage, published in 1698. Comparing Ophelia to Electra, he condemns Shakespeare for allowing his heroine to become \\"immodest\\" in her insanity, particularly in the \\"Flower Scene\\". Collier's attack occasioned a widespread, often vituperative controversy. Hamlet in general and Ophelia in particular were defended by Thomas D'urfey and George Drake almost immediately. Drake defends the play's justice on the grounds that the murderers are \\"caught in their own toils\\" (that is, traps). He also defends Ophelia by describing her actions in the context of her desperate situation; D'urfey, by contrast, simply claims that Dennis has discerned immorality in places to which no one else objected. In the next decade, Rowe and Dennis agreed with Collier that the play violated justice; Shaftesbury and others defended the play as ultimately moral. Early eighteenth century Criticism of the play in the first decades of the 18th century continued to be dominated by the neoclassical conception of plot and character. Even the many critics who defended Hamlet took for granted the necessity of the classical canon in principle. Voltaire's attack on the play is perhaps the most famous neoclassical treatment of the play; it inspired numerous defenses in England, but these defenses did not at first weaken the neoclassical orthodoxy. Thus Lewis Theobald explained the seeming absurdity of Hamlet's calling death an \\"undiscovered country\\" not long after he has encountered the Ghost by hypothesizing that the Ghost describes Purgatory, not death. Thus William Popple (in 1735) praises the verisimilitude of Polonius's character, deploring the actors' tradition of playing him only as a fool. Both Joseph Addison and Richard Steele praised particular scenes: Steele the psychological insight of the first soliloquy, and Addison the ghost scene. The ghost scenes, indeed, were particular favorites of an age on the verge of the Gothic revival. Early in the century, George Stubbes noted Shakespeare's use of Horatio's incredulity to make the Ghost credible. At midcentury, Arthur Murphy described the play as a sort of poetic representation of the mind of a \\"weak and melancholy person.\\" Slightly later, George Colman the Elder singled out the play in a general discussion of Shakespeare's skill with supernatural elements in drama. In 1735, Aaron Hill sounded an unusual but prescient note when he praised the seeming contradictions in Hamlet's temperament (rather than condemning them as violations of decorum). After midcentury, such psychological readings had begun to gain more currency. Tobias Smollett criticized what he saw as the illogic of the \\"to be or not to be\\" soliloquy, which was belied, he said, by Hamlet's actions. More commonly, the play's disparate elements were defended as part of a grander design. Horace Walpole, for instance, defends the mixture of comedy and tragedy as ultimately more realistic and effective than rigid separation would be. Samuel Johnson echoed Popple in defending the character of Polonius; Johnson also doubted the necessity of Hamlet's vicious treatment of Ophelia, and he also viewed skeptically the necessity and probability of the climax. Hamlet's character was also attacked by other critics near the end of the century, among them George Steevens. However, even before the Romantic period, Hamlet was (with Falstaff), the first Shakespearean character to be understood as a personality separate from the play in which he appears. Not until the late 18th century did critics and performers begin to view the play as confusing or inconsistent, with Hamlet falling from such high status. Goethe had one of his characters say, in his 1795 novel Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship, \\"Shakespeare meant...to represent the effects of a great action laid upon a soul unfit for the performance of it...A lovely, pure, noble, and most moral nature, without the strength of nerve which forms a hero, sinks beneath a burden which it cannot bear, and must not cast away.\\" This change in the view of Hamlet's character is sometimes seen as a shift in the critical emphasis on plot (characteristic of the period before 1750) to an emphasis on the theatrical portrayal of the character (after 1750). Romantic criticism Already before the Romantic period proper, critics had begun to stress the elements of the play that would cause Hamlet to be seen, in the next century, as the epitome of the tragedy of character. In 1774, William Richardson sounded the key notes of this analysis: Hamlet was a sensitive and accomplished prince with an unusually refined moral sense; he is nearly incapacitated by the horror of the truth about his mother and uncle, and he struggles against that horror to fulfill his task. Richardson, who thought the play should have ended shortly after the closet scene, thus saw the play as dramatizing the conflict between a sensitive individual and a calloused, seamy world. Henry Mackenzie notes the tradition of seeing Hamlet as the most varied of Shakespeare's creations: \\"With the strongest purposes of revenge he is irresolute and inactive; amidst the gloom of the deepest melancholy he is gay and jocular; and while he is described as a passionate lover he seems indifferent about the object of his affections.\\" Like Richardson, Mackenzie concludes that the tragedy in the play arises from Hamlet's nature: even the best qualities of his character merely reinforce his inability to cope with the world in which he is placed. To this analysis Thomas Robertson adds in particular the devastating impact of the death of Hamlet's father. By the end of the 18th century, psychological and textual criticism had outrun strictly rhetorical criticism; one still sees occasional critiques of metaphors viewed as inappropriate or barbarous, but by and large the neoclassical critique of Shakespeare's language had become moribund. The most extended critique of the play's language from the end of the century is perhaps that of Hugh Blair. Another change occurred right around the Romantic literary period (19th century), known for its emphasis on the individual and internal motive. The Romantic period viewed Hamlet as more of a rebel against politics, and as an intellectual, rather than an overly-sensitive, being. This is also the period when the question of Hamlet's delay is brought up, as previously it could be seen as plot device, while romantics focused largely on character. Samuel Coleridge, for example, delivered lectures on Hamlet during this period that evaluated his tragic state of mind in an interpretation that proved influential for over a century. For Coleridge, Shakespeare depicted Hamlet's light of indecisiveness as resulting from an imbalance between the human attention to external objects, and inward thoughts, and thus suffered a paralysis of action because his faculty of vivid imagination overpowered his will and induced an aversion to actually enacting any measure For Coleridge, Shakespeare aimed to convey the basic message that man must act, and not be trammeled by excessive thinking that only leads to delay. Later criticism has come to consider this view as much a reflection of Coleridge's own problematical nature as an insight into the Shakespearean character. Coleridge and other writers praised the play for its philosophical questions, which guided the audience to ponder and grow intellectually. Late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries At around the turn of the 20th century, two writers, A. C. Bradley and Sigmund Freud, developed ideas which built on the past and greatly affected the future of Hamlet criticism. Bradley held the view that Hamlet should be studied as one would study a real person: piecing together his consciousness from the clues given in the play. His explanation of Hamlet's delay was one of a deep \\"melancholy\\" which grew from a growing disappointment in his mother. Freud also viewed Hamlet as a real person: one whose psyche could be analyzed through the text. He took the view that Hamlet's madness merely disguised the truth in the same way dreams disguise unconscious realities. He also famously saw Hamlet's struggles as a representation of the Oedipus complex. In Freud's view, Hamlet is torn largely because he has repressed sexual desire for his mother, which is being acted out by and challenged by Claudius. Mid- and late-twentieth century Later critics of the century, such as T. S. Eliot in his noted essay \\"Hamlet and His Problems\\", downplayed such psychological emphasis of the play, and instead used other methods to read characters in the play, focusing on minor characters such as Gertrude, and seeing what they reveal about Hamlet's decisions. Eliot famously called Hamlet \\"an artistic failure\\", and criticized the play as analogous to the Mona Lisa, in that both were overly enigmatic. Eliot targeted Hamlet's disgust with his mother as lacking an \\"objective correlative\\"; viz., his feelings were excessive in the context of the play. Questions about Gertrude and other minor characters were later taken underwing by the feminist criticism movement, as criticism focused more and more on questions of gender and political import. Current, New Historicist theories now attempt to remove the romanticism surrounding the play and show its context in the world of Elizabethan England.  Twenty-First Century  The scholar Margreta de Grazia, finding that much of Hamlet scholarship focused on the psychological, dedicated her work Hamlet without Hamlet to understand the political in the play. Indeed, the scholar Linda Charnes echoed this notion in her review article of the text \\"There is no figure in Shakespeare's canon more explored, expounded upon, analyzed, psychoanalyzed, deconstructed, reconstructed, appropriated, situated, and expropriated than Hamlet, Prince of Denmark.\\" de Grazia points out that many related words in the play such as \\"adamah - like Adam from the Garden of Eden - (stone)\\" and \\"hamme (land)\\" have multiple meanings and that some of these meanings are political through their overt concern with land. Analysis and criticism Dramatic structure In creating Hamlet, Shakespeare broke several rules, one of the largest being the rule of action over character. In his day, plays were usually expected to follow the advice of Aristotle in his Poetics, which declared that a drama should not focus on character so much as action. The highlights of Hamlet, however, are not the action scenes, but the soliloquies, wherein Hamlet reveals his motives and thoughts to the audience. Also, unlike Shakespeare's other plays, there is no strong subplot; all plot forks are directly connected to the main vein of Hamlet struggling to gain revenge. The play is full of seeming discontinuities and irregularities of action. At one point, Hamlet is resolved to kill Claudius: in the next scene, he is suddenly tame. Scholars still debate whether these odd plot turns are mistakes or intentional additions to add to the play's theme of confusion and duality. Language Hamlet's statement in this scene that his dark clothing is merely an outward representation of his inward grief is an example of his strong rhetorical skill. Much of the play's language embodies the elaborate, witty vocabulary expected of a royal court. This is in line with Baldassare Castiglione's work, The Courtier (published in 1528), which outlines several courtly rules, specifically advising servants of royals to amuse their rulers with their inventive diction. Osric and Polonius seem to especially respect this suggestion. Claudius' speech is full of rhetorical figures, as is Hamlet's and, at times, Ophelia's, while Horatio, the guards, and the gravediggers use simpler methods of speech. Claudius demonstrates an authoritative control over the language of a King, referring to himself in the first person plural, and using anaphora mixed with metaphor that hearkens back to Greek political speeches. Hamlet seems the most educated in rhetoric of all the characters, using anaphora, as the king does, but also asyndeton and highly developed metaphors, while at the same time managing to be precise and unflowery (as when he explains his inward emotion to his mother, saying \\"But I have that within which passes show, / These but the trappings and the suits of woe.\\"). His language is very self-conscious, and relies heavily on puns. Especially when pretending to be mad, Hamlet uses puns to reveal his true thoughts, while at the same time hiding them. Psychologists have since associated a heavy use of puns with schizophrenia. Hendiadys is one rhetorical type found in several places in the play, as in Ophelia's speech after the nunnery scene (\\"Th'expectancy and rose of the fair state\\" and \\"I, of all ladies, most deject and wretched\\" are two examples). Many scholars have found it odd that Shakespeare would, seemingly arbitrarily, use this rhetorical form throughout the play. Hamlet was written later in his life, when he was better at matching rhetorical figures with the characters and the plot than early in his career. Wright, however, has proposed that hendiadys is used to heighten the sense of duality in the play. Hamlet's soliloquies have captured the attention of scholars as well. Early critics viewed such speeches as To be, or not to be as Shakespeare's expressions of his own personal beliefs. Later scholars, such as Charney, have rejected this theory saying the soliloquies are expressions of Hamlet's thought process. During his speeches, Hamlet interrupts himself, expressing disgust in agreement with himself, and embellishing his own words. He has difficulty expressing himself directly, and instead skirts around the basic idea of his thought. Not until late in the play, after his experience with the pirates, is Hamlet really able to be direct and sure in his speech. Contexts Religious John Everett Millais' Ophelia (1852) depicts Ophelia's mysterious death by drowning. The clowns' discussion of whether her death was a suicide and whether she merits a Christian burial is at heart a religious topic. The play makes several references to both Catholicism and Protestantism, the two most powerful theological forces of the time in Europe. The Ghost describes himself as being in purgatory, and as having died without receiving his last rites. This, along with Ophelia's burial ceremony, which is uniquely Catholic, make up most of the play's Catholic connections. Some scholars have pointed that revenge tragedies were traditionally Catholic, possibly because of their sources: Spain and Italy, both Catholic nations. Scholars have pointed out that knowledge of the play's Catholicism can reveal important paradoxes in Hamlet's decision process. According to Catholic doctrine, the strongest duty is to God and family. Hamlet's father being killed and calling for revenge thus offers a contradiction: does he avenge his father and kill Claudius, or does he leave the vengeance to God, as his religion requires? The play's Protestantism lies in its location in Denmark, a Protestant (and specifically a Lutheran) country in Shakespeare's day, though it is unclear whether the fictional Denmark of the play is intended to mirror this fact. The play does mention Wittenberg, which is where Hamlet is attending university, and where Martin Luther first nailed his 95 theses. One of the more famous lines in the play related to Protestantism is: \\"There is special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be not now, 'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet will it come‚Äîthe readiness is all.\\"Hamlet 5.2.202‚Äì6. In the First Quarto, the same line reads: \\"There's a predestinate providence in the fall of a sparrow.\\" Scholars have wondered whether Shakespeare was censored, as the word \\"predestined\\" appears in this one Quarto of Hamlet, but not in others, and as censoring of plays was far from unusual at the time. Rulers and religious leaders feared that the doctrine of predestination would lead people to excuse the most traitorous of actions, with the excuse, \\"God made me do it.\\" English Puritans, for example, believed that conscience was a more powerful force than the law, due to the new ideas at the time that conscience came not from religious or government leaders, but from God directly to the individual. Many leaders at the time condemned the doctrine, as: \\"unfit 'to keepe subjects in obedience to their sovereigns\\" as people might \\"openly maintayne that God hath as well pre-destinated men to be trayters as to be kings.\\" King James, as well, often wrote about his dislike of Protestant leaders' taste for standing up to kings, seeing it as a dangerous trouble to society. Throughout the play, Shakespeare mixes the two religions, making interpretation difficult. At one moment, the play is Catholic and medieval, in the next, it is logical and Protestant. Scholars continue to debate what part religion and religious contexts play in Hamlet. Philosophical Philosophical ideas in Hamlet are similar to those of Michel de Montaigne, a contemporary to Shakespeare. Hamlet is often perceived as a philosophical character. Some of the most prominent philosophical theories in Hamlet are relativism, existentialism, and scepticism. Hamlet expresses a relativist idea when he says to Rosencrantz: \\"there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so\\" (2.2.268-270). The idea that nothing is real except in the mind of the individual finds its roots in the Greek Sophists, who argued that since nothing can be perceived except through the senses, and all men felt and sensed things differently, truth was entirely relative. There was no absolute truth. This same line of Hamlet also introduces theories of existentialism. A double-meaning can be read into the word \\"is\\", which introduces the question of whether anything \\"is\\" or can be if thinking doesn't make it so. This is tied into his To be, or not to be speech, where \\"to be\\" can be read as a question of existence. Hamlet's contemplation on suicide in this scene, however, is more religious than philosophical. He believes that he will continue to exist after death. Hamlet is perhaps most affected by the prevailing scepticism in Shakespeare's day in response to the Renaissance's humanism. Humanists living prior to Shakespeare's time had argued that man was godlike, capable of anything. Scepticism toward this attitude is clearly expressed in Hamlet's What a piece of work is a man speech: ::... this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory, this most excellent canopy the air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why it appeareth nothing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is a man‚Äîhow noble in reason; how infinite in faculties, in form and moving; how express and admirable in action; how like an angel in apprehension; how like a god; the beauty of the world; the paragon of animals. And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? Scholars have pointed out this section's similarities to lines written by Michel de Montaigne in his Essais: ::Who have persuaded [man] that this admirable moving of heavens vaults, that the eternal light of these lampes so fiercely rowling over his head, that the horror-moving and continuall motion of this infinite vaste ocean were established, and continue so many ages for his commoditie and service? Is it possible to imagine so ridiculous as this miserable and wretched creature, which is not so much as master of himselfe, exposed and subject to offences of all things, and yet dareth call himself Master and Emperor. Rather than being a direct influence on Shakespeare, however, Montaigne may have been reacting to the same general atmosphere of the time, making the source of these lines one of context rather than direct influence. Common subjects of criticism Revenge and Hamlet's delay Within Hamlet, the stories of five murdered fathers' sons are told: Hamlet, Laertes, Fortinbras, Pyrrhus, and Brutus. Each of them faces the question of revenge in a different way. For example, Laertes moves quickly to be \\"avenged most throughly of [his] father\\", while Fortinbras attacks Poland, rather than the guilty Denmark. Pyrrhus only stays his hand momentarily before avenging his father, Achilles, but Brutus never takes any action in his situation. Hamlet is a perfect balance in the midst of these stories, neither acting quickly nor being completely inactive. Hamlet struggles to turn his desire for revenge into action, and spends a large portion of the play waiting rather than doing. Scholars have proposed numerous theories as to why he waits so long to kill Claudius. Some say that Hamlet feels for his victim, fearing to strike because he believes that if he kills Claudius he will be no better than him. The story of Pyrrhus, told by one of the acting troupe, for example, shows Hamlet the darker side of revenge, something he does not wish for. Hamlet frequently admires those who are swift to act, such as Laertes, who comes to avenge his father's death, but at the same time fears them for their passion, intensity, and lack of logical thought. Hamlet's speech in Act III, where he chooses not to kill Claudius in the midst of prayer, has taken a central spot in this debate. Scholars have wondered whether Hamlet is being totally honest in this scene, or whether he is rationalizing his inaction to himself. Critics of the Romantic era decided that Hamlet was merely a procrastinator, in order to avoid the belief that he truly desired Claudius' spiritual demise. Later scholars suggested that he refused to kill an unarmed man, or that he felt guilt in this moment, seeing himself as a mirror of the man he wanted to destroy. Indeed, it seems Hamlet's Renaissance-driven principles serve to procrastinate his thoughts. The physical image of Hamlet stabbing to death an unarmed man at prayer, from behind, would have been shocking to any theater audience. Similarly, the question of \\"delay\\" must be seen in the context of a stage play‚ÄîHamlet's \\"delay\\" between learning of the murder and avenging it would be about three hours at most‚Äîhardly a delay at all. The play is also full of constraint imagery. Hamlet describes Denmark as a prison, and himself as being caught in birdlime. He mocks the ability of man to bring about his own ends, and points out that some divine force molds men's aims into something other than what they intend. Other characters also speak of constraint, such as Polonius, who orders his daughter to lock herself from Hamlet's pursuit, and describes her as being tethered. This adds to the play's description of Hamlet's inability to act out his revenge. Madness Hamlet has been compared to the Earl of Essex, who was executed for leading a rebellion against Queen Elizabeth. Essex's situation has been analyzed by scholars for its revelations into Elizabethan ideas of madness in connection with treason as they connect with Hamlet. Essex was largely seen as out of his mind by Elizabethans, and admitted to insanity on the scaffold before his death. Seen in the same context, Hamlet is quite possibly as mad as he is pretending to be, at least in an Elizabethan sense. Protestantism Hamlet was a student at Wittenberg or so is thought. Wittenberg is \\"one of only two universities that Shakespeare ever mentions by name\\", and \\"was famous in the early sixteenth century for its teaching of ... Luther's new doctrine of salvation\\". Furthermore, Hamlet's reference to \\"a politic convocation of worms\\" has been read as a cryptic allusion to Luther's famous theological confrontation with the Holy Roman Emperor at the Diet of Worms in 1521. However, the more influential Reformer in early 17th century England was John Calvin, a strong advocate of predestination; many critics have found traces of Calvin's predestinarian theology in Shakespeare's play. Calvin explained the doctrine of predestination by comparing it to a stage, or a theater, in which the script is written for the characters by God, and they cannot deviate from it. God, in this light, sets up a script and a stage for each of his creations, and decrees the end from the beginning, as Calvin said: \\"After the world had been created, man was placed in it, as in a theater, that he, beholding above him and beneath the wonderful work of God, might reverently adore their Author.\\" Scholars have made comparisons between this explanation of Calvin's and the frequent references made to the theatre in Hamlet, suggesting that these may also take reference to the doctrine of predestination, as the play must always end in its tragic way, according to the script. Rulers and religious leaders feared that the doctrine of predestination would lead people to excuse the most traitorous of actions, with the excuse, \\"God made me do it.\\" English Puritans, for example, believed that conscience was a more powerful force than the law, due to the new ideas at the time that conscience came not from religious or government leaders, but from God directly to the individual. Many leaders at the time condemned the doctrine, as: \\"unfit 'to keepe subjects in obedience to their sovereigns\\" as people might \\"openly maintayne that God hath as well pre-destinated men to be trayters as to be kings\\". King James, as well, often wrote about his dislike of Protestant leaders‚Äò taste for standing up to kings, seeing it as a dangerous trouble to society. In Hamlet's final decision to join the sword- game of Laertes, and thus enter his tragic final scene, he says to the fearful Horatio: In itself, this line lays the final capstone on Hamlet's decision. The line appears to base this decision on his believed predestination as the killer of the king, no matter what he may do. The potential allusion to predestinarian theology is even stronger in the first published version of Hamlet, Quarto 1, where this same line reads: \\"There's a predestinate providence in the fall of a sparrow.\\" Scholars have wondered whether Shakespeare was censored, as the word \\"predestined\\" appears in this one Quarto of Hamlet, but not in others, and as censoring of plays was far from unusual at the time. Catholicism At the same time, Hamlet expresses several Catholic views. The Ghost, for example, describes himself as being slain without receiving Extreme Unction, his last rites. He also implies that he has been living in Purgatory: \\"I am thy father's spirit / Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night, / And for the day confin'd to fast in fires, / Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature / Are burnt and purg'd away\\" (1.5.9-13). While belief in Purgatory remains part of Roman Catholic teaching today, it was explicitly rejected by the Protestant Reformers in the 16th century. Catholic doctrines manifest themselves all over the play, including the discussion over the manner of Ophelia's burial in Act 5. The question in this scene is of whether it is right for Ophelia to have a Christian burial, since those who commit suicide are guilty of their own murder in the doctrines of the church. As the debate continues between the two clowns, it becomes a question of whether her drowning was suicide or not. Shakespeare never fully answers this question, but presents both sides: either that she did not act to stop the drowning and therefore committed suicide of her own will, or that she was mad and did not know the danger and thus was killed by the water, innocently. The burial of Ophelia reveals more of the religious doctrines in question through the Priest overseeing the funeral. Scholars have carefully outlined the \\"maimed rites\\" (as Hamlet calls them) carried out by the Priest. Many things are missing in her funeral that would normally make up a Christian burial. Laertes asks, \\"What ceremony else?\\" The priest answers that since her death was questionable, they will not give her the full funeral, although they will allow her \\"maiden strewments\\", or flowers which were thrown into her grave. In cases of suicide, sharp rocks, rather than flowers, were thrown in. The difficulties in this deeply religious moment reflect much of the religious debate of the time. Other interpretations Feminist Ophelia, distracted by grief (4.5). Feminist critics have explored her descent into madness in her defense. Feminist critics have focused on the gender system of Early Modern England. For example, they point to the common classification of women as maid, wife or widow, with only whores outside this trilogy. Using this analysis, the problem of Hamlet becomes the central character's identification of his mother as a whore due to her failure to remain faithful to Old Hamlet, in consequence of which he loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia as if she were a whore also. Carolyn Heilbrun published an essay on Hamlet in 1957 entitled \\"Hamlet's Mother\\". In it, she defended Gertrude, arguing that the text never hints that Gertrude knew of Claudius poisoning King Hamlet. This view has been championed by many feminists. Heilbrun argued that the men who had interpreted the play over the centuries had completely misinterpreted Gertrude, believing what Hamlet said about her rather than the actual text of the play. In this view, no clear evidence suggests that Gertrude was an adulteress. She was merely adapting to the circumstances of her husband's death for the good of the kingdom. Ophelia, also, has been defended by feminists, most notably by Elaine Showalter. Ophelia is surrounded by powerful men: her father, brother, and Hamlet. All three disappear: Laertes leaves, Hamlet abandons her, and Polonius dies. Conventional theories had argued that without these three powerful men making decisions for her, Ophelia was driven into madness. Feminist theorists argue that she goes mad with guilt because, when Hamlet kills her father, he has fulfilled her sexual desire to have Hamlet kill her father so they can be together. Showalter points out that Ophelia has become the symbol of the distraught and hysterical woman in modern culture, a symbol which may not be entirely accurate nor healthy for women. Psychoanalytic Key figures in psychoanalysis‚ÄîSigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan‚Äîhave offered interpretations of Hamlet. In his The Interpretation of Dreams (1899), Freud proceeds from his recognition of what he perceives to be a fundamental contradiction in the text: \\"the play is built up on Hamlet's hesitations over fulfilling the task of revenge that is assigned to him; but its text offers no reasons or motives for these hesitations\\". He considers Goethe's 'paralysis from over- intellectualization' explanation as well as the idea that Hamlet is a \\"pathologically irresolute character\\". He rejects both, citing the evidence that the play presents of Hamlet's ability to take action: his impulsive murder of Polonius and his Machiavellian murder of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Instead, Freud argues, Hamlet's inhibition against taking vengeance on Claudius has an unconscious origin. Freud's theory of Hamlet's unconscious oedipal desire towards his mother has influenced modern performances of the 'closet scene' (3.3). In an anticipation of his later theories of the Oedipus complex, Freud suggests that Claudius has shown Hamlet \\"the repressed wishes of his own childhood realized\\" (his desire to kill his father and take his father's place with his mother). Confronted with this image of his own repressed desires, Hamlet responds with \\"self-reproaches\\" and \\"scruples of conscience, which remind him that he himself is literally no better than the sinner whom he is to punish\\". Freud goes on to suggest that Hamlet's apparent \\"distaste for sexuality\\", as expressed in his conversation with Ophelia (presumably in the 'nunnery scene' rather than during the play- within-a-play), \\"fits in well\\" with this interpretation. Since this theory, the 'closet scene' in which Hamlet confronts his mother in her private quarters has been portrayed in a sexual light in several performances. Hamlet is played as scolding his mother for having sex with Claudius while simultaneously wishing (unconsciously) that he could take Claudius' place; adultery and incest is what he simultaneously loves and hates about his mother. Ophelia's madness after her father's death may be read through the Freudian lens as a reaction to the death of her hoped-for lover, her father. Her unrequited love for him suddenly slain is too much for her and she drifts into insanity. In addition to the brief psychoanalysis of Hamlet, Freud offers a correlation with Shakespeare's own life: Hamlet was written in the wake of the death of his father (in 1601), which revived his own repressed childhood wishes; Freud also points to the identity of Shakespeare's dead son Hamnet and the name 'Hamlet'. \\"Just as Hamlet deals with the relation of a son to his parents\\", Freud concludes, \\"so Macbeth (written at approximately the same period) is concerned with the subject of childlessness\\". Having made these suggestions, however, Freud offers a caveat: he has unpacked only one of the many motives and impulses operating in the author's mind, albeit, Freud claims, one that operates from \\"the deepest layer\\". Later in the same book, having used psychoanalysis to explain Hamlet, Freud uses Hamlet to explain the nature of dreams: in disguising himself as a madman and adopting the license of the fool, Hamlet \\"was behaving just as dreams do in reality ... concealing the true circumstances under a cloak of wit and unintelligibility\\". When we sleep, each of us adopts an \\"antic disposition\\". Gothic Hamlet contains many elements that would later show up in Gothic literature. From the growing madness of Prince Hamlet, to the violent ending to the constant reminders of death, to, even, more subtly, the notions of humankind and its structures and the viewpoints on women, Hamlet evokes many things that would recur in what is widely regarded as the first piece of Gothic literature, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, and in other Gothic works. Walpole himself even wrote, in his second preference to Otranto: > That great master of nature, Shakespeare, was the model I copied. Let me ask > if his tragedies of Hamlet and Julius C√¶sar would not lose a considerable > share of their spirit and wonderful beauties, if the humour of the grave- > diggers, the fooleries of Polonius, and the clumsy jests of the Roman > citizens, were omitted, or vested in heroics? Heroic Paul Cantor, in his short text called simply Hamlet, formulates a compelling theory of the play that places the prince at the center of the Renaissance conflict between Ancient and Christian notions of heroism. Cantor says that the Renaissance signified a \\"rebirth of classical antiquity within a Christian culture\\". But such a rebirth brought with it a deep contradiction: Christ's teachings of humility and meekness (\\"whoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also\\") are in direct conflict with the ancient ethos that is best represented by Achilles' violent action in the Iliad (\\"I wish only that my spirit and fury would drive me to hack your meat away and eat it raw for the things that you have done to me\\"). For Cantor, the character of Hamlet exists exactly where these two worlds collide. He is in one sense drawn towards the active side of heroism by his father's legacy (\\"He smote the sledded Polaks on the ice\\") and the need for revenge (\\"now could I drink hot blood. And do such bitter business as the day/ Would quake to look on\\"). Simultaneously though, he is pulled towards a religious existence (\\"for in that sleep of death what dreams may come\\") and in some sense sees his father's return as a ghost as justification for just such a belief. The conflict is perhaps most evident in 3.3 when Hamlet has the opportunity to kill the praying Claudius. He restrains himself though, justifying his further hesitation with the following lines: \\"Now might I do it pat, now ‚Äòa is a-praying;/ And now I‚Äôll do it- and so ‚Äòa goes to heaven,/ And so am I reveng‚Äôd. That would be scann‚Äôd:/ A villain kills my father, and for that/ I, his sole son, do this same villain send/ To heaven.\\". At this moment it is clear that the prince's single mind and body are being torn apart by these two powerful ideologies. Even in the famous 3.1 soliloquy, Hamlet gives voice to the conflict. When he asks if it is \\"nobler in the mind to suffer\\", Cantor believes that Shakespeare is alluding to the Christian sense of suffering. When he presents the alternative, \\"to take arms against a sea of troubles\\", Cantor takes this as an ancient formulation of goodness. Cantor points out that most interpretations of Hamlet (such as the Psychoanalytic or Existentialist) see \\"the problem of Hamlet as somehow rooted in his individual soul\\" whereas Cantor himself believes that his Heroic theory mirrors \\"a more fundamental tension in the Renaissance culture in which he lives\\". Meta- interpretational Maynard Mack, in a hugely influential chapter of Everybody's Shakespeare entitled \\"The Readiness is All\\", claims that the problematic aspects of Hamlets plot are not accidental (as critics such as T.S. Eliot might have it) but are in fact woven into the very fabric of the play. \\"It is not simply a matter of missing motivations,\\" he says, \\"to be expunged if only we could find the perfect clue. It is built in\\". Mack states that \\"Hamlet's world is pre-eminently in the interrogative mood. It reverberates with questions\\". He highlights numerous examples: \\"What a piece of work is man!... and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust?\\"; \\"To be, or not to be‚Äîthat is the question\\"; \\"Get thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners?\\"; \\"What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven?\\". The action of the play, especially the scenes outside the castle, take place in a kind of logical fog. The opening scene is riddled with confusions and distortions: \\"Bernardo?\\"; \\"What, is Horatio there?\\"; \\"What, has it appeared again tonight?\\"; \\"Is not this something more than fantasy?\\". Hamlet himself realizes that \\"he is the greatest riddle of all\\" and at 3.2.345 he expresses his frustration with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern: \\"how unworthy a thing you make of me... call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, you cannot play upon me\\". Mack says that the confusion of the drama points \\"beyond the context of the play, out of Hamlet's predicaments into everyone's\\". Other critics such as Martin Evans expand upon Mack's notion of built-in mystery, claiming that even the textual discrepancies between the three known versions may actually be deliberate (or at the very least they add to the effect). Evans also argues that Shakespeare's impenetrable text and Hamlet's 'unplayable' strings could be meant to reflect the deep anxieties that were felt in an era of philosophical, scientific and religious disorientation. The works (and actions) of Machiavelli, Copernicus and Luther had upset hierarchical notions of virtue, order and salvation that had persisted since the Middle Ages. Hamlet is in a sense the inscrutable and enigmatic world within which human beings had to orient themselves for the first time. We are each characters in a play just like Gertrude, Polonius and the rest‚Äîwhere they are trying to grasp Hamlet, we are trying to grasp Hamlet. Whatever interpretation we walk away with though, whether it be existential, religious or feminist, it will necessarily be incomplete. For Mack, human beings will always remain in an \\"aspect of bafflement, moving in darkness on a rampart between two worlds\\". David P. Gontar in his book Hamlet Made Simple proposes that most of the puzzles in the play can be resolved by conceiving of Prince Hamlet as the son of Claudius, not Hamlet the Dane. Note that Hamlet is suicidal in the first soliloquy well before he meets the Ghost. Gontar reasons that his depression is a result of having been passed over for the Danish throne which is given inexplicably to the King's brother. This tends to imply an impediment to succession, namely illegitimacy. On this reading some collateral issues are resolved: Hamlet is angry at his mother for an extramarital affair she had with Claudius, of which he, the Prince, is a byproduct. Further, the reason Hamlet cannot kill the King is not because the King is a father figure but, more strongly, because he is Hamlet's actual biological father. We can deduce, then, that the Ghost is in fact a liar, who shows no concern for Hamlet's own personal welfare. He confirms the fatherhood of King Hamlet in order to give Hamlet an incentive for revenge.

It has six sites of archaeological importance. Archeological Sites Muniyappasamy and Kali Temple The Muniyan and Kali Temple is located 500 meters from the village, and has its own drinking water pond. The temple and the pond are preserved by the villagers for the annual festival. The large water pond used by the town for a swimming pool was deepened in the 1970s. When its floor was dug up, dozens of mudhumakkal Thazhis (burial urns) were discovered, along with earthen lamps and eating utensils, which were buried along with the urns in the belief that the dead may find light and food in the afterlife. These archaeological finds were reburied after their discovery. In this village a famous festival called ERUTHUKATTU is celebrated almost every year.Eruthukattu means taming specially nurtured,strong,fast, powerful and trained bulls by the village youth. This festival makes the village famous in the surrounding areas. The annual Kudhirai Eduppu ( Horse Parade) ritual of this temple refers to the thwarting of the Turk Invasion, with the intervention of the deity, as per legend. It most likely refers to the siege of Malik Kafur. Malik Kafur's forces were known to have marched up to Rameshwaram and Keelathooval is right on the route, with two beheaded Hindu stone sculptures as added testimony . Kafur's siege on Madurai continued for weeks.Malik Kafur Pallivasal The Pallivasal (Tamil for mosque or madarasa) is near the kuttivila grove, about a kilometer to the east of the village, where the Paramakudi-Mudukulathur Road passes. The kuttivila trees are preserved by the local populace, who regard the trees as holy. Seeraaa pallivaasal The Seeraa pallivaasal, about four kilometers in the south eastern direction, is devoid of any structures, but the ilandai tree there is considered holy. Ilandai trees are rare in this part of the Ramnad district. This site may have been a holy place in the pre-10th century A.D, when the Arabs who came to trade and settled along the Coromandel coast, as Keelathooval is from the Bay of Bengal. Muniappa Samy Temple The Muniappa Samy Temple, with its own holy pond, is of unknown origin, and the annual Maasi Kalari celebration is held here. The customs and rituals of these temples are looked after a family of hereditary trustees. The pond behind this temple is lined with huge banyan trees. Kudumboorani The Kudumboorani, with its holy tree, shelters a large variety of birds, as well as the remains of an ancient temple of Shiva. Stone pillars stand along with statues of deities and Soolayudam, the three pronged weapon of Shakti. The pond near this temple site is used as drinking water resource. The living area of the people clusters in a circle around the temples of about four to five kilometers in diameter. The two headless standing statues of deities (or King and Queen) were vandalized during the pillage of Malik Kafur in A.D. 1311. Hero Stone The Hero Stone in front of the main Pillayar temple was removed, as it was located in the centre of a village pathway, though the location may have been a battle field. The tamarind tree next to the elementary school is also said to be standing on the site of a Muslim settlement which was destroyed by an invading force. Legend says that the women-folk of this entire community sealed themselves into a cellar underground so that they would not be defiled by the invaders. The place name Keelathooval means \\"Eastern Nest\\" in Malayalam, a language which is not spoken in the nearby area, but rather in the adjoining state of Kerala. Ancestry The present residents are traced to the lineage of the Sethupathy clan, which ruled the Ramnad Country from early 17th century till India's independence in 1947. In A.D. 1888, the king of Ramnad Bhaskara Sethupathy married Sivapakkiam Nachiar, the daughter of Kannusamy Thevar of Thooval, who was a relative of the King. Mannar Bhaskara Sethupathy by Dr. S.M.

Burke was executive vice president and general manager of the Royals from the middle of the 1974 season through October 1981. He then served as club president until his death on May 12, 1992. During his tenure, Burke was general manager of the Royals' first American League championship team, the 1980 edition, then was president of the 1985 Royals, who won the franchise's first World Series title. In addition to those two pennant-winners, the Royals won American League West Division championships in 1976, 1977, 1978, 1981 (second half of a split season) and 1984. In , he was named Major League Executive of the Year by The Sporting News after his first division title. Before coming to Kansas City, Burke had been a member of the front office of the Texas Rangers and its predecessor, the second modern-era Washington Senators franchise. He had begun his baseball career in 1948 with the Louisville Colonels of the Triple-A American Association, where he worked under general manager Ed Doherty. After rising to the post of GM of the Colonels in , Burke joined the expansion Senators in their debut 1961 season as business manager, again working for Doherty, the team's first general manager. He later was named the Senators' vice president and treasurer, and was retained when Bob Short purchased the Senators in 1968. He accompanied the franchise to Dallas-Fort Worth when it relocated after the season and became the Rangers' general manager in their first season in North Texas. After two years in that role, Burke moved to the Royals as business manager after the campaign. In June 1974, Burke became the second general manager in the Royals' six-year history. One of his first major moves was the hiring of Whitey Herzog as manager during the middle of the 1975 season on July 25. Herzog would be elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame as a manager in 2010, but he had failed dismally as the Rangers' pilot, working under Burke, during 1973. In Kansas City, he would turn the Royals into consistent contenders in the AL West. Burke also appointed Jim Frey and Dick Howser as managers after Herzog's exit, and each man would lead Kansas City to an American League pennant (and, in Howser's case, the 1985 World Series title as well). Burke became the Royals' second club president after the 1981 season, succeeding owner Ewing Kauffman, and his top assistant, John Schuerholz, was promoted to general manager. Like Herzog, Schuerholz would also be elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame (in 2017, for his later success as GM of the Atlanta Braves). Burke died of lymphatic cancer in Kansas City, Kansas, at age 68.

Anderson, set in the Dune universe created by Frank Herbert. Released on September 16, 2008, it is the first book in the Heroes of Dune series and chronicles events between Frank Herbert's Dune (1965) and Dune Messiah (1969), as well as between Dune and its 2001 Brian Herbert/Kevin J. Anderson prequel, Dune: House Corrino. Following the events of Dune, Paul Atreides is in control of the all-important planet Arrakis and therefore the entire universe. Former Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV has been deposed and exiled, but plots to return to power. The Fremen jihad in Paul's name rages as he himself sees to the accuracy of his consort Princess Irulan's chronicle of his life story. Paul flashes back to his memories of the War of Assassins which played out in his youth, before his family relocated to Arrakis in Dune. Plot The book is divided into seven sections, which alternate between Paul Atreides's youth before the events portrayed in Dune, and the early period of his Fremen jihad between Dune and Dune Messiah. Paul Atreides's youth Twelve-year-old Paul resides on the planet Caladan with his parents, Duke Leto Atreides and his Bene Gesserit concubine Lady Jessica. House Ecaz of Ecaz and House Moritani of Grumman are embroiled in a generations-long feud, and an Atreides- Ecazi alliance is set to be formalized by Leto's marriage to the Archduke Armand Ecaz's daughter Illesa. At the wedding, Leto and his family escape an assassination attempt, but Armand is injured and Illesa is killed. Leto and Armand lead a retaliatory attack on Grumman, not realizing that the Moritani forces have been supplemented by troops from House Harkonnen, sworn enemies of the Atreides. The Padishah Emperor's Sardaukar warriors also arrive to prevent full-scale war. Viscount Hundro Moritani has planned this entire offensive as a means to assemble the Ecazi, Atreides, and Imperial forces and annihilate them with a doomsday device; the plot fails as Moritani's Swordmaster Hiih Resser disables the weapon.  Muad'Dib's jihad  After the fall of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV and Paul's accession to the Imperial throne, Paul's Fremen forces are engaged on multiple fronts, fighting the Houses that refuse to recognize Atreides rule. The Fremen finally capture Kaitain, the former Imperial capital and home planet of House Corrino. Paul levels Shaddam's fortress, which he hopes will send a message to the other dissident Houses. He invites Whitmore Bludd, a former Swordmaster of House Ecaz and a friend to Paul's former mentor Duncan Idaho, to help him construct on Arrakis the grandest citadel the universe has ever seen. Meanwhile, Earl Thorvald, the nobleman heading the rebel forces, is being chased across the galaxy by Fremen naib Stilgar and Paul's Fedaykin commandos. Elsewhere, Shaddam's former minion the exiled Count Fenring and his Bene Gesserit wife Margot are raising their daughter Marie on Tleilax, training her as a weapon against the Atreides. The savage brutality of the Fremen pushes more noble Houses into alliances with Thorvald. Bludd is executed after trying to assassinate Paul and make his mark in history. Growing more callous and savage as the years pass, Paul ultimately orders the complete annihilation of Thorvald's home planet after he learns that the rebel is planning an attack against Caladan. Marie attempts to assassinate Paul but is killed by Paul's young sister Alia; a distraught Fenring manages to stab Paul mortally. Saved by an overdose of the drug melange, Paul arises and banishes the Fenrings to live out their days with Shaddam, whom they now loathe.

Biography He was born in Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk), Royal Prussia (a fief of the Crown of Poland) to his father's second wife and named after his father (died 1604), who was a procurator. The Danzig city council gave scholarships to Samuel Scheidt and him to study with Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck in Amsterdam from 1607 to 1610; in the autumn of that year, he returned home where he became assistant organist of the Marienkirche. His application to become principal organist of the church after Cajus Schmiedtlein died in March 1611 failed due to complaints about his arrogance and style of performance. He moved to K√∂nigsberg in 1611 to take up the post of organist of Altstadt Church, and became court organist at Warsaw in 1616. He returned to Danzig in 1623 to become principal organist, where he remained until his death; he failed in an application for the post of Kapellmeister in 1627 after the death of Andreas Hakenberger, who was succeeded by Kaspar F√∂rster. He did not lead a serene life; he became sidelined at the Warsaw court, and had long-running feuds with Kaspar F√∂rster, choirmaster of the Marienkirche from 1627 to 1652, and Marco Scacchi, Polish court choirmaster from 1628 to 1649. Music His first book of Psalmen Davids consists of two concertos for three and four voices and twelve settings for four and five voices of material drawn from the Calvinist Goudimel-Lobwasser psalter of the Reformed Church. The form used is that of the chorale motet, the instrumental parts having little significance, mainly doubling the voices. Psalmorum Davidicorum II consists of fifteen psalms for four to eight voices, a concerto for four voices, and an eight-part instrumental canzona; the works are antecedents of the concertato chorale motet and the chorale cantata; there are instrumental preludes and ritornellos, and alternating sections of solo and tutti passages. His keyboard works bear some similarity to Sweelinck, but are not generally of a high quality. The highly ornamented line is usually played by the right hand with the chorale underneath. This texture is interrupted by episodes exploiting effects of harmony and colour.

(Title 42 of the United States Code, Sections 11101 - 11152) It followed a federal antitrust suit by a surgeon against an Astoria hospital and members of its clinic in which he claimed antitrust actions were effected through the mechanism of peer review in the hospital. He claimed that a general surgeon of the clinic initiated the action due to an ongoing dispute between him and the clinic. He prevailed in a jury trial. (The antitrust suit was later overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals on the grounds that existing Oregon statutes already protected the peer review committee members from prosecution and that these protections should extend to federal antitrust suits brought by individuals for monetary (but not injunctive) relief.) Soon thereafter Congressman Wyden introduced HCQIA in an effort to extend state peer review immunities on a federal level.  Context for passage  The rising numbers of medical malpractice lawsuits during the preceding decade played a factor in the passage of the act. It was claimed that physicians with a history of malpractice suits could move easily from state to state with no mechanism of interstate reporting available. Consumer groups therefore lobbied extensively for passage in the name of patient safety. They claimed, supported by statistics from the US Office of the Inspector General, that although the number of physicians was rising, disciplinary actions against physicians' licenses had not risen in proportion. These concerns coincided with an exponential increase in malpractice lawsuits against physicians. The Medical Malpractice Trial Bar, with its system of contingency fees, had been blamed for encouraging an increasing number of frivolous, non-meritorious lawsuits over the preceding 2 decades. In this environment, physicians and hospitals appeared reluctant to report their peers and thereby increase the overall legal liability for their profession. Malpractice insurance premiums had already begun to skyrocket due to the malpractice environment, and physicians were not inclined to make the situation worse. During the ensuing debate, studies were published that asserted that only a small fraction of medical negligence was ever brought to a lawsuit. Several medical malpractice attorneys, such as Harvey Waschman in his text American Law of Medical Malpractice, asserted that most \\"malpractice lawsuits involve the type of slip-up that would be obvious to a first year medical student.\\" The fact that only a very small number of lawsuits win on their merits (even when they are filed) suggested that the standard of negligence used by medical malpractice attorneys was not the same one used by medical professionals and the courts. Furthermore, the studies of negligence did not attempt to separate the contribution of systems failures (not attributable to a single medical practitioner) from that of an individual physician. It has been shown since that time that system failures are common in healthcare.  Principles of immunity for peer review participation  The American Medical Association lobbied for confidentiality and legal immunity for healthcare peer review processes. It theorized that only in such an environment could system failures be identified and corrected and physician participation be increased. This immunity became incorporated into the HCQIA.  National Practitioner Databank  The AMA objected to the creation of a National Practitioner Databank (NPDB) unregulated by medical boards, claiming that the number of frivolous suits that would be reported would be misleading. It claimed that there was already a databank used by state medical boards that kept a record of physician disciplinary actions. It argued that the NPDB would be subjected to reporting of actions by non-peer reviewed committees. Their objection proved correct.  Amendments  In 1991 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) required state medical boards to report \\"any negative action or finding\\" by \\"any peer review or accreditation entity,\\" wresting the notion of peer review by physicians away from the National Practitioner Databank. In California, this move was echoed as insurance agencies and health plans were enabled to perform \\"peer review.\\" This combination of events ended the ability of physicians to conduct peer review of themselves, and \\"peer review\\" of physicians became transformed into \\"performance appraisal\\" done by physicians and non-physicians alike. Although the original HCQIA had afforded immunity to physician peer reviewers only (which were originally assumed to constitute the group of peers), the OBRA amendment conferred immunity to a widening circle of non-physician performance appraisers as well.

It is the fifth novel in The Dresden Files, his first published series that follows the character of Harry Dresden, professional wizard. This book is published by New American Library with the . Plot summary Harry shares a TV panel with a Vatican priest, Father Vincent, and S√£o Paulo University Professor Don Paolo Ortega, a disguised Red Court Vampire noble. Father Vincent hires Dresden to recover the stolen Shroud of Turin while Ortega challenges Harry to a duel to end the war between the White Council and the Red Court. After the show concludes, Dresden is attacked by the Denarian Ursiel, a fallen angel attached to a mortal host. Michael Carpenter and two other Knights of the Cross, Shiro and Sanya, rescue him and ask him to drop the Shroud investigation, but Dresden refuses. Dresden tracks the Shroud to a boat, but is captured by the thieves. Deirdre, another Denarian, attacks the boat and kills one of the thieves. Dresden fools her into taking a decoy safe rather than the Shroud itself. The surviving thief, Anna Valmont, flees with the Shroud. Dresden's onetime lover, Susan Rodriguez, escorts him to a high society art sales charity event run by Johnny Marcone, where the Shroud will likely be sold. The sale is interrupted by the Denarians, who seize the Shroud and kidnap Dresden. Nicodemus, leader of the Denarians, pressures Harry to join with the Denarian Lasciel or die. Dresden refuses. Shiro arrives and trades himself for Dresden. Dresden is almost re-captured, but Susan, enhanced in battle by her semi-vampire status, helps him escape. She reveals that she is working with The Fellowship of St. Giles, an organization of half-turned humans resisting the vampire Courts. Harry deduces that Father Vincent is a Denarian imposter, and the real priest is the murder victim he is investigating for Murphy. With the Knights, he captures the imposter and forces him to reveal that Nicodemus plans to use the Shroud to create a deadly plague curse at O'Hare Airport, an international travel hub. Dresden fights his duel with Ortega at Wrigley Field, overseen by The Archive (a little girl containing the sum of humanity's written knowledge) and her bodyguard Kincaid. Ortega, facing defeat, draws a forbidden weapon. He is shot by Martin, one of Susan's associates. Red Court vampires surge onto the field, covering Ortega's escape. Dresden races to the airport with the Knights. They find Shiro severely tortured and near death. Shiro entrusts his sacred sword Fidelacchius to Dresden and reveals that Nicodemus is now going to St. Louis by train to spread the plague curse. He then dies. Dresden enlists the aid of Marcone and catches up to the St. Louis train. Dresden, Marcone, and the Knights battle the Denarians to retrieve the Shroud. They recover the Shroud and stop the plague, but Nicodemus escapes and Marcone appropriates the shroud. While Dresden recuperates in Michael's home, he receives a letter from Shiro, who reveals he is dying of cancer and intended to sacrifice himself. Dresden's White Council mentor, Ebenezar McCoy, wipes out Ortega's Latin American compound by crashing a satellite into it. Dresden trails Marcone to a secluded, rural hospital and discovers that Marcone is using the Shroud in an attempt to heal the comatose Amanda Beckitt. Dresden tells Marcone he can have three days to see if the Shroud will heal her, then return it to the Church. Marcone agrees. Nicodemus attempts to suborn Michael's youngest son into the Denarian order, but Dresden thwarts him, but not without pain and cost.

Playing career Murray played his youth football at Belvedere before going abroad. At Belvedere he played in the same team as Wes Hoolahan. Murray began his career as a trainee at Premier League side Blackburn Rovers, though he never made a first-team appearance. An initial loan period at Second Division club Cambridge United was turned permanent in March 2002, as the U's signed Murray on a free transfer from Blackburn. Murray's three seasons at the club, in which he made over 100 appearances, saw Cambridge relegated to the Third Division. He signed a three-year contract for League Two side Northampton Town for an undisclosed fee in July 2004, but his tenure at the club was blighted by serious injuries, including an infected Achilles tendon. In both the 2005‚Äì06 and 2006‚Äì07 seasons, Murray did not play a single minute of football. He was released in May 2007, but was invited to still train with the club. After an unsuccessful trial with Leyton Orient, Murray joined Conference Premier side Stafford Rangers on 28 August 2007, making his debut in a 2‚Äì1 defeat at Oxford United. He then joined Peter Taylor's Stevenage Borough team on a short-term contract in the January 2008 transfer window, and narrowly missed out on a place in the Conference play-offs. After his release from Stevenage, he trained with League Two side Exeter City before signing for them, once more on a short-term deal. He left Exeter on 8 May 2009, after just 6 appearances for the club. At the start of the 2009‚Äì10 season, Murray signed for Grays Athletic along with eight other players. After a change in management at Grays, Murray left the club less than a week after joining them, signing for Luton Town on a six-month loan deal on 11 August 2009. He made his debut for Luton on the same day, in a 4‚Äì1 home victory over Manfield Town. On 13 January 2010, with his loan deal expired, Murray signed an 18-month contract with Luton. Murray continued to be a regular fixture at left-back for Luton, though he missed parts of the 2010‚Äì11 season due to injury, including Luton's penalty shootout loss to AFC Wimbledon in the Conference Premier play-off final. On 12 July 2011, he signed a new contract with the club. On 10 November 2011, Murray was deregistered as a Luton player to allow him to focus on recovering from a serious knee injury which had seen him take no part in Luton's 2011‚Äì12 season. The club signed Darlington defender Greg Taylor as a replacement. In July 2012, Luton manager Paul Buckle confirmed that Murray had left the club. Murray (speaking in 2020) confirmed that, despite his injury troubles, his time at Luton was the most enjoyable of his career. Physiotherapy career Murray sustained a career- ending injury at the age of 28. His last game, away to York City for Luton in the Conference in April 2011 (a month before his 29th birthday) saw him stretchered from the field of play. He trained as a physiotherapist at the University of Salford. On his transition from football to physiotherapy, Murray has said: \\"I never had any interest in playing again as I fell in love with physio, I filled the void that football had given me and I was ready for a change. I walked from one career into another and studying physio was the best thing I ever did\\". Murray took up a position with QPR. Harry Redknapp promoted him from an academy role to the first team, where he worked during the club's time in the Premier League. His first medical was Charlie Austin. Though he has spoken well of his time working with Redknapp, Murray became disillusioned with the politics of football. He parted ways with QPR. Murray then founded the London-based Remedy clinic among whose clinets have been rock star Dave Grohl and numerous athletes, including \\"a French international, a World Cup winner\\" whom Murray declined to name. Murray does not discuss his clients. His work with Grohl (whom Murray spent about six months with following a 2015 broken leg) became public knowledge after the rock star thanked him in media interviews in 2017 and even dedicated a song to Murray on stage at a 2019 RDS show. Murray said in 2020: \\"I had offers from Premier League clubs to go in as physio over the last few years but there is no job that would bring me back there as the work I do now [with Remedy] is the way I want to work with a client, if that's an athlete or anyone, we treat them the way they should be treated\\".

Mazzarelli, the place where Maria Mazzarello was born Valponasca, the place where Maria Mazzarello spent her childhood Life She was born in Mornese, in what is now the province of Alessandria, northern Italy, to a peasant family who worked in a vineyard. She was the eldest of ten children of Joseph and Maddalena Calcagno Mazzarelli. When she was fifteen she joined the Association of the Daughters of Mary Immaculate, run by her parish priest, Father Domenico Pestarino; it was a precursor to the founding of the Salesian Sisters. The Daughters were known for their charitable works and Mary soon set herself apart for her sound judgment, dedication, joy, and love of the young. Wherever she went the village children were drawn to her like a magnet, eager to hear her stories, or to ask her a multitude of questions about the Christian faith. When she was 23 years old, a typhoid epidemic hit Mornese and villagers started rapidly dying. Soon, her uncle and aunt were taken ill and Mary volunteered to care for them and their many children. After a week they were healed, but when she returned home Mary became ill with typhoid herself. She received the last rites of the Church and recovered, but the illness left her weak. The strength which had formerly sustained her in the fields was no more. Mary was now thin and frail; a shell of her formerly robust self. Her practicality led her to find other means to sustain herself, so she took an apprenticeship as a seamstress in the town and worked diligently at the craft. Like John Bosco, the skills which she learned in her youth she was later able to pass onto those who would come after her. After she recovered from her illness, in the month of October, Mary was walking in her village and was suddenly astounded to see before her a large building with a courtyard and many girls playing and laughing. A voice said to her, ‚ÄúI entrust them to you.‚Äù At the same time St John Bosco had a similar experience where he was shown a group of girls abandoned in a courtyard. The same voice said to him, ‚ÄúThese are my daughters; take care of them.‚Äù Mary was to become the co-founder of a religious order to care for young girls, just as the Salesian priest and brothers cared for young boys. The education of girls was a particular need in nineteenth century, and Mary decided to devote herself this work. Hosts of farm girls from the country, or serving girls, factory workers, and street vending girls filled the streets of the city; and all of them were at risk to juvenile prostitution. She wished to educate them, and teach them a trade, to save them from the dangers of street life. She persuaded some of her girl friends to join her in this project. Fifteen young women now comprised the Daughters of Mary Immaculate. Fr Pestarino busied himself with training them in the spiritual life and managed to secure a place for some of them to live in community, thus was the beginning of religious life in Mornese. The Daughters took in a few young girls and housed them, schooling them in the faith and handing down to them their knowledge of dress making. Don Bosco was told of the Daughters by Fr Pestarino, who himself was training as a Salesian of Don Bosco under the saint. Considering his vision of the young girls, Don Bosco decided to meet with them. He went to Mornese with his boy band under the guise of raising funds for his Oratory, but his true intention was to investigate the possibility of founding a female counterpart of the Salesian Sisters from the Daughters of Mary Immaculate. Institute of the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians Collegio, the first community of the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians In 1867, after meeting with them and receiving the Daughters' enthusiastic response to his proposal, Don Bosco drew up their first rule of life. A source of the community‚Äôs good spirit, sense of humor, optimism and charity, Mary Mazzarello was a natural choice as the first superior, although she did all that she could to not accept the title. Eventually obedience won out and she was the first Mother of the young community at age thirty. After much formation, struggles, the well-intentioned but misdirected advice of others, and difficulties with the townspeople (whose school for boys which they had raised money for and built was turned over to the Daughters for their work by Don Bosco), the day of their profession arrived. The fifteen young women, led by Mary Mazzarello, professed their vows as religious women in the presence of the Bishop of Acqui, their spiritual father Don Bosco, and Fr Pestarino. July 31, 1872 was the birthday of the new religious family. At age thirty-five, donned in a habit, she was now Sister Mary Mazzarello. She and the fourteen other newly professed religious sisters made up the fledgling order. The Daughters of Mary Help of Christians were officially founded. Mary was asked by Don Bosco to temporarily fulfill the role of superior until he could call together a council of the sisters to for an election. As the feminine branch of the Salesian religious family, the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians sought to do for girls what the priests and brothers were doing in Turin for boys. They brought to their ministry the particular feminine genius which lends itself so well to nurturing, teaching, and encouraging the young along the way of salvation and personal growth; they became well loved by the townsfolk. After being elected Mother General of the Salesian Sisters, Mary Mazzarello felt that it was important that she and the other sisters have a good understanding of how to read and write; it was a skill which many of them had never had the opportunity to acquire. Her dedication to her sisters was not limited to their intellectual development alone. In every way she was an attentive mother, which is why to this day she is still fondly referred to as ‚ÄúMother Mazzarello‚Äù by the Salesian Sisters. When several of the sisters were headed to the South American missions, she accompanied them to their port of call in Genoa, Italy, and then took a boat to France so that she could visit the sisters there. In Marseilles their ship broke down and had to be repaired. All of the passengers were forced to disembark while it was dry docked. Although the Sisters had been told that lodging had been prepared for them, there was a mix-up and they were left without beds to sleep on. Mother Mazzarello was not one to let events such as that discourage her so she took the sheets that they brought with them stuffed them with straw, and made makeshift beds for all of them. After a miserable night of sleep they all awoke, but Mother Mazzarello could not get up. A fever was ravaging her body and she was in terrible pain. The next morning, more out of a concern for worrying her already exhausted companions, she was able to get up, see the missionaries off, and then journey with her remaining Sisters to their house and orphanage in St. Cyr. In the Basilica of Our Lady Help of Christians, Turin  Death  Once in St. Cyr she fainted and was in bed for forty days the diagnosis was pleurisy. Eventually she returned to Italy, even though the doctor told her not to. She said that she wanted to die in her own community. She made her return journey in stages, as she did not want to push herself too much; she was painfully aware of her delicate condition. Fortunately on one of her stops Don Bosco was near and they were able to meet for the last time. In early April, Mary returned to Mornese. Her native air strengthened her and since she felt stronger she insisted on keeping the community schedule and doing her usual work. Unfortunately it was too much for her and she relapsed. Near the end of April it seemed that death was approaching. Finally, in the pre-dawn hours of May 14, 1881, Mother Mazzarello began her death agony. After receiving the last rites she turned her attention to those around her and weakly whispered, \\"Good-bye. I am going now. I will see you in heaven.\\" Shortly after she died at the age of forty-four. She was beatified on November 20, 1938 and canonized on June 24, 1951. Her incorrupt body is venerated in the Basilica of Our Lady Help of Christians, in Turin, Italy.

The CAC hosts an annual Gold Medal Exhibition each year along with a number of other smaller public and special museum exhibitions. Headquartered in one of the large bungalows that was part of the historic Vista del Arroyo Hotel in Pasadena, the California Art Club has a number of chapters throughout California.As of July 2016, there are ten CAC Chapters throughout California. http://www.californiaartclub.org/about/cac-chapters Origins of the CAC The history of the California Art Club begins with an earlier organization, The Painters' Club of Los Angeles. On the evening of March 10, 1906 a number of painters who lived in the Los Angeles area met together for the purpose of forming a club. Soon afterward, on the evening of March 17, eleven of these same men met at the studio of William Swift Daniell (1865-1933). After some discussion, it was unanimously decided to form a club then and there, and the Painters‚Äô Club of Los Angeles was born with the goal to arrange exhibitions and further the fine arts in Southern California.Antony Anderson, Art and Artists, Los Angeles Times, March 25, 1906; 6,2,5 The eleven founding Charter Members included Antony E. Anderson (1863-1939), Carl Oscar Borg (1879-1947), William Henry Cole (1870-1955), Albert Clinton Conner (1848-1929), Frank C. Conner, William Swift Daniell, David H. Dunn, Frank Elwin Evans, Frank Rennsselear Liddell (1864-1923), Hanson Duvall Puthuff (1875-1972), and George Thomas Winterburn (1865-1953).Minutes, March 17, 1906, Painters' Club of Los Angeles, CAC Archives According to the membership roster, the Painters' Club grew and eventually numbered around 42 members.Membership Roster, Painters' Club of Los Angeles, CAC Archives After several years and a number of exhibitions it became apparent to the members that the scope of the organization, which was open only to male painters, was too limited and a consensus arose to dissolve the organization in order to form one that was wider in scope. The Painters' Club of Los Angeles was disbanded in December 1909, but there would be a new group to follow, \\"to be called the California Art Club.\\"Anderson, Antony, Los Angeles Times, December 12, 1909, III17 A core group of members from the Painters' Club - Charles Percy Austin (1883-1948), Franz Bischoff (1864-1929), Carl Oscar Borg, Benjamin Chambers Brown (1865-1942), Frank Rennsselear Liddell, Hanson Puthuff, and William Wendt (1845-1946) - would be instrumental in laying the groundwork for the nascent California Art Club, as well as supplying its first three Presidents. The Founding of the CAC The California Art Club was founded in December 1909, immediately after The Painters' Club of Los Angeles was disbanded. Although the date and location of the first club meeting is unknown, the second was held February 5, 1910 in Franz Bischoff's Studio, located at 320 Pasadena Avenue, South Pasadena.Antony Anderson, Art and Artists, Los Angeles Times, February 13, 1910 Among its founding and earliest members were Hector Alliot (1862-1919), Antony E. Anderson (1863-1939), Charles Percy Austin, Franz Bischoff, Carl Oscar Borg, Benjamin Chambers Brown, Mauritz DeHaaff (1877-1948), Allen Durand (1865-1939), Aaron E. Kilpatrick (1872-1953), Frank Rennsselear Liddell, Everett Carroll Maxwell, William A. Matern (1867-1923), Frederick Roland Miner (1876-1935), John Hubbard Rich (1876-1954), Rob Wagner (1872-1942), Jack Wells [or Welles], William Wendt, and most likely Wendt's wife, sculptress Julia Bracken Wendt (1868-1942).See Julia Bracken Wendt's response (Open Letter, Los Angeles Times, January 1910) to Antony Anderson's Art and Artists column from December 12, 1909.Antony Anderson, Art and Artists, Los Angeles Times, February 27, 1910 One of the main objectives behind the founding of the new club was to expand its membership and encourage others to participate - \\"No longer limited to male painters based in L.A., the Club opened its membership to women, sculptors and artists living as far away as New York.\\" By the time of the club's Second Annual Exhibition in 1911,Held November 22 ‚Äì December 6, 1911 at Blanchard Hall, Los Angeles; exhibition pamphlet, CAC Archives membership had increased by about thirty members, including nine women: Helena Adele Dunlap (1876-1955), Helma Heynsen Jahn (1874-1925), Mary Ann Van Alstine Bartow (1848-1924), Alma May Cook (1884-1973), S. Henrietta Dorn Housh (1855-1919), Helen Hutchinson (1866-?), Louise Elizabeth Garden MacLeod (1857-1944), Lydie G. Price, and Elizabeth Waggoner.Second Annual Exhibition Pamphlet, 1911, CAC Archives By early 1912 Xarifa Hamilton Towner (1881-?) would also join.Antony Anderson, Art Notes, Los Angeles Times, February 4, 1912, III18 Frank Renssellear Liddell served as the first club President from 1909-10. Liddell was succeeded by William Wendt who filled the office of President twice: from 1911-14 as the second President, and from 1917-18 as the fourth. Wendt's terms bookended the club's third President, Benjamin Chambers Brown, who held that office from 1915-16.Antony Anderson, California Art Club, Los Angeles Times, Dec. 12, 1915, III28 The organization grew quickly in prestige under Wendt and Brown, connecting itself with the newly formed Museum of History, Science and Art in Exposition Park. The Art Committee of the new museum's Gallery of Fine Arts included at least four CAC members, including Everett C. Maxwell, who was both an Honorary CAC Member as well as Curator of the County Museum Art Gallery. The club began holding its annual exhibitions in the new space less than a year after the new museum was founded, and would continue to do so for more than two decades.Antony Anderson, Fifth Annual Exhibition, Los Angeles Times, Sept. 13, 1914, III10; Anderson, Fifth Annual Exhibition, Los Angeles Times, Oct. 11, 1914, III10; Anderson, Fifth Annual Exhibition Again, Los Angeles Times, Oct. 18, 1914, III6Antony Anderson, American Painters , Los Angeles Times, December 28, 1913, III5; This City as a Center of Art, Los Angeles Times, November 7, 1913, II3) As the CAC was being founded, California Impressionism was just beginning to emerge in Southern California. Many club members had studied overseas in European ateliers like the Acad√©mie Del√©cluse, the Acad√©mie Julian, and the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. Benjamin Brown studied at the Acad√©mie Julian with Jean-Paul Laurens (1838-1921) and Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant (1845-1902); Rob Wagner was also a student at Acad√©mies Julian and Del√©cluse. John Hubbard Rich spent four years at the Art Students League in New York City, then spent time at the School of the Boston Museum as well as two years studying in Europe. Along with classical atelier painting, the influences of French Impressionism were starting to be felt. Helena Dunlap studied with William Merritt Chase (1849-1916) in New York City and Andr√© Lhote (1885-1962) in Paris, and Charles Percy Austin was a pupil of John Twachtman (1853-1902). Others like Julia Bracken Wendt, William Wendt, and Edgar Payne studied at schools like the Chicago Art Institute.Julia Wendt at CAI - McKay, James, The Dictionary of Sculptors in Bronze, Antique Collectors Club, London, 1995Hughes, Edan, Artists in California 1786 ‚Äì 1940 Through the work of its artists and its annual exhibitions, the CAC was greatly responsible for popularizing the Impressionist style in California. Authorities like Professor William Gerdts have long identified California Impressionism as a regional variation of American Impressionism which was a very broad movement that was loosely bound to the French style. Most American and California Impressionists adopted the painterly brush work, brighter palette and colored shadows of French Impressionism and the elementary practice of sketching outdoors, directly from nature or en plein air. Early Years of the CAC and California Impressionism From its first exhibitions, the California Art Club became identified with Impressionism. In 1913, in the national magazine Arts Journal, the writer E.C. Maxwell wrote that \\"From a dozen different writers upon subjects pertaining to the development and trend of art in the west, the word has gone forth to the world that California, that land of golden light and purple shadows, is destined in the course of the next few years to give us a new school of landscape painting...Conditions seem right for a renaissance of art in California...If this art epoch of golden prophecy does not come to pass, it will not be the fault of the California Art Club.\\" The activities of the California Art Club were chronicled in the pages of the Los Angeles Times, the Herald Examiner and the Pasadena Star News. The art columnist for the Times, Antony Anderson was a founding member of the club and he was lavish in his praise of its exhibitions and its leaders, men like William Wendt, Benjamin Chambers Brown and Jack Wilkinson Smith. In the club's formative years, meetings were held at locations around Los Angeles, including members homes and studios,Meeting at Frank R. Liddell house, Anderson, Antony, Art and Artists, Los Angeles Times, June 5, 1910Meeting at Mauritz DeHaaf studio, Anderson, Antony, Art and Artists, Los Angeles Times, April 2, 1911 various schools and galleries,Meeting in the rooms of the Sketch Club, Anderson, Antony, Art Notes, Los Angeles Times, May 5, 1912, III24Meeting at the Copp Building, Anderson, Antony, Art Notes, Los Angeles Times, September 14, 1913, III22Meeting at the Cannon Art School, Anderson, Antony, Art Notes, Los Angeles Times, December 14, 1913, III4 and the Earl House, 2425 Wilshire Boulevard in Westlake Park.Meeting at the Earl House, Jarrett, Mary, Foreword, Who‚Äôs Who in the California Art Club, Inc., Roster and By-Laws, 1984, 75th Anniversary Edition, p.8, CAC Archives (now MacArthur Park). By the early 1920s, the club resolved to seek a more permanent location and laid out plans for a building fund with a goal to raise $150,000 primarily by exhibiting and selling artwork. CAC artist and Managing Director Walter Farrington Moses (1874-1947) led the effort of achieving their goal. A one-night exhibition was held at the Los Angeles Philharmonic Auditorium in 1923; included along with smaller donations was ‚Äú$500 on the spot.‚ÄùOf Interest to Artists, Los Angeles Times, December 17, 1922 Though the CAC as an organization is most often identified with California Impressionism, some CAC members worked in and experimented with other modes of painting and sculpting. Helena Dunlap (1876-1955),Dunlap is a very early member, first exhibiting with the CAC in their 2nd Annual Exhibition in 1911. an early CAC member and exhibitor, also went on to found the Modern Art Society of Los Angeles in 1916 with five other CAC members: Bert Cressey (1883-1944), Meta Cressey (1882-1964), Edgar Keller (1868-1932), Henrietta Shore (1880-1963) and Karl Yens (1868-1945).Artists in California 1786 ‚Äì 1940, Edan Milton Hughes At the CAC's Annual Exhibition at Exposition Park in 1931, members Ruth Peabody (1893-1966) and Phil Dike (1906-1990) won top honors for their work, which were dubbed \\"ultra modern.\\"Modernist Wins at California Art Exhibit, Los Angeles Express, November 19, 1931Two California Art Club Exhibition Prize Winners, Los Angeles Times, November 22, 1931 Another member, Stanton MacDonald-Wright (1890-1973),MacDonald-Wright joined the CAC in October 1954 - CAC Archives was a co-creator of Synchromism, an early abstract, color-based mode of painting which influenced artists like Donna Norine Schuster (1883-1953).Schuster exhibited with the CAC from 1915-38 and studied with MacDonald-Wright.

(1998). \\"Regional Reports\\". Archives of American Art Journal. 38 (3/4): 47‚Äì59. While the painters of the early California Art Club did not adhere to a stylistic code of any kind, they were all representational artists who worked from life, whether it was out doors, from nature or in the studio from models. The California Art Club was part of a broadly representational movement that held sway in California long after more modern styles of painting became popular elsewhere. During the 1910s and the \\"Roaring 20s\\" when the American economy bounded back from the post-World War I recession, the California Art Club grew in membership and prestige, but it lacked a permanent clubhouse. That changed in 1926, when the wealthy heiress and art patron Aline Barnsdall (1882-1946) gifted her home Hollyhock House, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, to the CAC to use as its headquarters as a fifteen-year loan. The club moved into the property atop Hollywood, known as Olive Hill, the following year. Gradually, during the 1930s, proponents of more modern movements also began to gain a foothold and younger patrons began to purchase their works instead of those of the California Impressionists. The Hollyhock House Years (1927-42) and the Depression By 1923, the idea of a new permanent home was gaining momentum. During ‚Äúan animated meeting‚Äù at their temporary headquarters at 623 Park View, the CAC looked at two feasible options: Aline Barnsdall had offered the club use of Olive Hill, her estate in Hollywood; a second option comprised another location at ‚Äúthe southwest corner of Grand View and Third Street.‚ÄùAnderson, Antony, Of Art and Artists: California Club Planning to Build, Los Angeles Times, September 21, 1924, p.30 Two years later the idea of a permanent clubhouse was still enthusiastically discussed, but 1925 saw the Club forced to restructure their project due to its being ‚Äúsuspended temporarily on the resignation of the business manager.‚Äù Strong interest remained despite the fact that they hadn‚Äôt yet reached their fundraising goal.Anderson, Antony, Of Art and Artists: Members of Club Vote for Gallery, Los Angeles Times, April 5, 1925, p.30 With the Club‚Äôs efforts stalled, Aline Barnsdall approached the City of Los Angeles about managing a section of her estate as a cultural arts center. Overlooking Hollywood Boulevard to the east and presenting panoramic views west towards the Pacific Ocean, the 36-acre hilltop estate south of Griffith Park was originally slated to include multiple structures dedicated to the arts. An eventual rift between Barnsdall and architect Frank Lloyd Wright meant that only three buildings would be completed: Hollyhock House, named after Miss Barnsdall‚Äôs favorite flower, and two other structures referred to as ‚ÄúResidences A and B.‚ÄùMerrell, Eric, California Art Club in Search of a Home: The Hollyhock Years, 1927-1942, California Art Club Newsletter, Winter 2010 Eventually in 1926 the City of Los Angeles agreed to take eight acres. The discussions between the City and Miss Barnsdall about how the property could be used included a stipulation that the California Art Club be given a lease on Hollyhock House lasting fifteen years.Art Club Takes Over New Home, Los Angeles Times, September 1, 1927, A1; Schrank, Sarah, Art and the City: Civic Imagination and Cultural Authority in Los Angeles, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008, p.38-39; California Art Club Bulletins, CAC Archives In the California Art Club Bulletin, the club‚Äôs monthly publication, CAC President Edwin Roscoe Shrader (1878-1960) wrote accepting the gift: ‚ÄúAline Barnsdall has brought to fruition her plans to establish a cultural center amidst the beauty of Olive Hill.

Siqueiros had consulted with Neutra about new approaches for \\"Street Meeting\\" that might better withstand the hot and dry Southern California climate.Desmond Rochfort, Mexican Muralists, Chronicle Books, San Francisco, 1993, p.146 Shortly after his lecture at the Hollyhock House, Siqueiros would begin work on \\"Am√©rica Tropical\\" with the help of twenty-nine artists, including CAC members Dean Cornwell, Karoly Fulop (1893-1963), and Frederick John Vrain Schwankowsky (1885-1974).Millier, Arthur, Huge Fresco for El Paseo, Los Angeles Times, August 24, 1932, p.15; Great Art Work to be Unveiled, Los Angeles Times, October 9, 1932, p.11] The stock market crash of 1929 was the big blow - it meant a decline in exhibition attendance and patronage. Then, as the Great Depression deepened, club membership gradually waned. This decline was somewhat inevitable as the founding members of the CAC aged, moved away or died throughout the 30s and 40s. William Wendt and Edgar Payne were living in Laguna Beach and had become active in the Laguna Beach Art Association. Membership fees for ‚ÄúArtists‚Ä¶and Lay Members‚Äù were reduced and it was noted in a bulletin that ‚Äúa few more new members would enable us to join in the popular sport of ‚ÄòBalancing the Budget.‚Äô‚ÄùImportant Notice, CAC Bulletin, May 1932, Vol. VII, No. 5, p.2 Also, following the example of other groups, the Club ‚Äúcancelled all unpaid dues prior to January 1932, providing the current dues [were] paid in full.‚Äù In addition, it created an Assistance Fund for any member needing financial aid.Dues; An Assistance Fund, CAC Bulletin, Oct. 1932, Vol. VII, No. 9, p.2 The deep impact of the Depression on the CAC was seen in ‚Äúa dwindling membership,‚Äù and corroborated reports that ‚Äúthe [Hollyhock] house was in pretty bad shape towards the end of [their] tenure‚Äù when their fifteen-year lease with the Hollyhock House ended in 1942.Hollyhock House: The California Art Club Years, p.5 After briefly giving the club an extension of their lease in January 1942, L.A. Parks Commission forced CAC to abandon Olive Hill by March of that year. The club established a temporary headquarters at Plummer Park until about August 1942, after which they met at the Women‚Äôs Club of Hollywood for a year. After the Women's Club, monthly meetings were held at the Masonic Temple from October 1943-February 1945. At the January 26, 1945 meeting at this location, Los Angeles Mayor Fletcher Bowron and Supervisor John Anson Ford were guests. Postwar Years In 1946 the California Art Club partnered with the Veterans Administration to present the First Annual G.I. Art Exhibit at the Museum of History, Science and Art in Exposition Park. \\"First prize winners are given membership in the art club for one year with all fees and dues waived.\\" There were forty-one exhibiting G.I. artists in all.Brushstrokes, L.A.

Press, 2008, p.69 The new museum director, James H. Breasted, Jr., wanted to open the venue up to more artists, not just those in the clubs. It didn't go over well, and the headlines made it to Life Magazine: ‚ÄúThe outraged artists set up their own canvasses on the museum‚Äôs steps and terrace and along the walls as examples of what should have been shown inside. Then they marched around the museum demanding that the director resign. Instead‚Ä¶[Director] James H. Breasted Jr. remained in his oak-doored office and quietly called police.

Annual exhibitions were held at venues such as the Greek Theater in Griffith Park (1949‚Äì66), Brand Library in Glendale (1979, 1982, 1990), and even a short- lived California Art Club Gallery located at 1309 Westwood Boulevard for a handful of years. Meeting places during this period included Channing Hall at United Methodist Church (March 1945-February 1947) and Rexall Square (September 1947-May 1949), with the group eventually settling into Rancho Golf Club House for two decades (September 1949 ‚Äì 1969).CAC Bulletins, CAC Archives Victor Matson was President of the California Art Club in 1961 and 1962. He was a landscape painter and an able organizer who had been active in many of the Southland art organizations. By the late 1960s and 1970s, the ranks of the California Art Club consisted primarily of amateur artists, but there was still a small group of professional painters that were active, such as Sam Hyde Harris. The California Art Club Bulletin 1925-1994 In November 1925, CAC President Shrader wrote in the foreword of the inaugural issue of The California Art Club Bulletin, \\"The Bulletin will fill a long-felt want in the activities of the Club.\\" Published monthly for nearly 70 years, it reported on club activities, exhibitions, member news, meetings, lectures, and more, both within the club and around greater Los Angeles. After the July 1994 issue, the Bulletin was redesigned and renamed the California Art Club Newsletter, starting with the Summer 1994 issue. It continues to be printed for the Club membership on a quarterly basis and includes articles written by art historians and scholars.CAC Bulletins and Newsletters, 1925-present, CAC Archives California Art Club Newsletter 1994-present Published by the California Art Club, the Newsletter is a quarterly journal that documents California's traditional arts heritage, both historic and contemporary. Each issue contains unique essays about artists and art movements written by art historians, museum curators, art writers, and artists. The publication includes \\"news briefs,\\" club activities, membership news, book reviews, and exhibition listings. Although the California Art Club was established in 1909, the first issue, Volume 1, No. 1, was printed in December 1925 and originally named \\"The California Art Club Bulletin\\" with artist Ralph Holmes (1876-1963) as its first editor. The \\"Bulletin\\" was published as a monthly periodical to keep members informed of fellow members and the goings-on of the local burgeoning Los Angeles art scene. The publication operated as a volunteer effort and was managed by several editors who were members of the club. However, after the Great Depression, Modernism, and World War II, the California Art Club fell on hard times, but still managed to exist, howbeit on a much smaller and scale. With the 1990s resurgence of representational art forms, the California Art Club experienced a revival that was launched in 1993. The organization began to re-brand itself as a prime leader in the contemporary-traditional art movement and recognized the need for a scholarly publication to help further their mission. Under the newly named editor-in- chief Elaine Adams, the June 1994 issue was renamed the \\"California Art Club Newsletter.\\" Over the years, the Bulletin has expanded from its single front- and-back 8-1/2 x 11 page to its present 36-page quarterly journal printed by Typecraft in Pasadena, California.  List of Editors  Artist Ralph Holmes (1876-1963) served as the first editor of the \\"California Art Club Bulletin\\" from December 1925 to January 1927. From February 1927 to December 1931, artist Louise Everett (1899-1959) served as editor; and from January to December 1932 John Coolidge was the editor. For ten years the Bulletin took a hiatus until 1942 when Edward Lanser became its editor and changed the publication's name to \\"C.A.C. Bulletin: The Voice of the California Art Club.\\" Lanser served as its editor until April 1948. Then, under Mary Jarrett who served as the new editor until 1954, the publication was renamed as \\"The Art Bulletin.\\" Next, artist Vic Carl Houser (1895-1972) served as editor until May 1958; followed by artist Horace \\"H.E.\\" Edmund Huey until March 1959, and in April 1959 Mary Jarrett returned to serve as editor, and then in June 1960 Vic Carl Houser returned as editor until April 1965. The Bulletin went into hiatus again until April 1968 when it published only one issue that year under Edris N. Baker as the editor. The next issue came out in October 1969 with artist Kaffy Reinhardt as the editor. Ruth Jones served as editor of the Bulletin until May 1994. Elaine Adams became editor-in-chief and renamed the publication as the \\"California Art Club Newsletter,\\" which continues today in 2017 under her management. Revival of the CAC By the early 1990s the membership of the California Art Club had been severely reduced. Peter Seitz Adams, a member in earlier years (he exhibited in the 68th Annual Gold Medal Exhibition in 1977),California Art Club 1977 Gold Medal Show pamphlet was contacted by longtime patron member Verna Gunther and 43rd CAC President Charles I. Harris (1922-2012) to take over the helm of the neglected California Art Club; Adams was elected the 44th President of the California Art Club in October 1993.President's Message, October 1993 CAC Bulletin His wife, Elaine Adams, managed the business of the organization, eventually becoming the Executive Director and CEO. In June 1994 Elaine Adams became editor-in-chief of the CAC Bulletin and immediately changed its name to the California Art Club Newsletter and soon expanded the publication to include scholarly articles about art history and profiles on contemporary artists of the CAC.Memoirs of the California Art Club 1993-2006 by Peter Adams, CAC President, Published in the 95th Annual Gold Medal Exhibition catalogue The first wave of painters to join the reorganized California Art Club included Dan Gooze√©, Steve Huston, Stephen E.

Gold Medal Exhibition The Gold Medal Exhibition is held each spring. Previous locations include: the Autry Museum of the American West, Pasadena Museum of History, USC Fisher Museum of Art, Pasadena Museum of California Art, and Luckman Fine Arts Complex at California State University, Los Angeles. Works are juried into the exhibition. Previously, at least two99th Annual Gold Medal Exhibition, 2000 Gold Medals were awarded at each exhibition, but sometimes numbered as many as five per exhibition.including the \\"Edgar Payne Award for Best Landscape\\" [started 96th Annual, 2006]; the \\"Guy Rose Award for Best Multi-Figurative Composition,\\" [started 98th Annual, 2009]; and the \\"Gold Medal Award for the Advancement of Art\\" [started 99th Annual, 2010]. The medals were voted on by the participating artist members of the organization. However, in 2016 the practice of presenting awards was discontinued. The look and design of the medals changed throughout the years and were created by various club members. Along with the award medals given out at the Annual Exhibitions, the practice of which dates back at least to 1926, there were a number of Memorial Medals, Silver Medals, and Medals of Honor that were given to members to honor their services and special contributions to the Club. In particular is the Medal of Honor created by Philip Paval around 1953. This medal was awarded in 1954 to Sir Winston Churchill when the statesman was invited by Paval to join the Club as an Honorary CAC Member. Churchill accepted and the medal is presently on display in the Collection of Chartwell House in the U.K. Special exhibitions In 1996, the California Art Club organized the California Wetlands Exhibition at the Natural History Museum in historic Exposition Park in Los Angeles. In May through August 1998, the CAC mounted Treasures of the Sierra Nevada at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.The catalog for the Treasure of the Sierra Nevada exhibition was written by Jean Stern of the Irvine Museum. The Carnegie Museum in Oxnard, California, hosted a large exhibition of works by painters from the California Art Club in 1994, entitled, \\"The California Art Club: 85 Years of Art\\". In 1997, a traveling exhibition which contrasted the work of American Impressionists and Classical Realist painters from the East and Midwestern United States along with the California Impressionists titled, \\"East Coast Ideals West Coast Concepts,\\" traveled from the Carnegie Museum in Oxnard to the Springville Museum of Art in Springville, Utah to the Academy of Art College in San Francisco.See catalog listed below, East Coast Ideals, West Coast Concepts. The California Art Club also organized and sponsored a traveling exhibition entitled, \\"Theodore Lukits, An American Orientalist,\\" dedicated to the Asian-themed works of Thedore Lukits, who had first been a member of the California Art Club in 1922 and was later made a Life Member. This exhibition of colorful still lifes and figurative works originated at the Pacific Asia Museum in the fall of 1998 and traveled to the Carnegie Art Museum in the winter of 1998 and 1999, then concluded at the Muckenthaller Cultural Center in Fullerton, California, in the Spring of 1999.This exhibition was curated by Jeffrey Morseburg and the CAC's Peter Adams. Later in 1999, the California Art Club began a relationship with the Frederick R. Weisman Museum of Art at Pepperdine University in Malibu with the exhibition entitled, \\"On Location in Malibu\\". CAC organization Membership The California Art Club membership is broad, with fewer than 2,000 members in a number of categories of membership. Signature Members are the most established painters who have been approved for membership by their peers from the ranks of Artist Members. Artist Members are juried into the organization from new applicants and the ranks of the Painting Patron Members. There is a category for out of state artist members, enabling the group the benefit of having the work of some of America's best traditional painters. There is also a large membership of Patron Members and also a Collector's Circle, which requires a donation to the organization.

Originally from York, he made his debut in 1996 and played in two premiership sides, in 1997, when South Fremantle beat East Fremantle in a derby grand final, and as captain in 2005, as well as three losing grand finals.

While not adopted by Britain's Royal Air Force, small numbers were bought by the Irish Free State and Bolivia, the latter of which used the type during the Chaco War. One modified Vespa was used to set a world altitude record of 43,976 ft (13,407 m) in September 1932. Design and development The Vespa was designed by Vickers as a private venture to meet the requirements of Air Ministry Specification 30/24,The only other aircraft designed to meet this specification was the Short S.3b Chamois, the first prototype, the Vespa I being flown in September 1925.Mason 1994, p.173. The Vespa, which was a single-engine biplane with a slim fuselage suspended between closely spaced and highly staggered two-bay wooden wings, was delivered for evaluation by the Royal Air Force, but crash landed owing to engine trouble on 24 June 1926 and was badly damaged.Andrews and Morgan 1988, p.200. It was then rebuilt with steel, fabric-covered wings as the Vespa II, but this was unsuccessful in getting orders from the RAF. It did, however, attract attention from Bolivia, which ordered six Vespa IIIs, an improved all metal version, in 1928, and the Irish Free State, which ordered four Vespa IVs in 1929 and a further four Vespa Vs in 1930.Andrews and Morgan 1988, p.203. The prototype Vespa was modified as the Vespa VI for demonstration to the Central Chinese government, but was not purchased, so was returned to Britain. It was rebuilt as the Vespa VII, with a supercharged Bristol Pegasus S engine for an attempt on the world altitude record, setting a record of 43,976 ft (13,407 m) on 16 September 1932.Andrews and Morgan 1988, pp.203‚Äì206. Operational history Six Vespa IIIs were delivered to Bolivia in 1928, where they were mainly used as operational conversion aircraft, although they did see limited use in the Chaco War as reconnaissance and long- range bombers, these aircraft operating at low altitude rather than the high altitude that Bolivia's Vespas were optimised for.Andrews and Morgan 1988, pp.200‚Äì203.

The mountain is located in an area of a National Park.Birding Trip Report - North-East Tunisia, May 2005 The town of Zaghouan is located below on its northern slope. The mountain is the site of a Roman temple known as the Temple des Eaux (Temple of Water), which marks the site of an aqueduct which used to take water to the city of Carthage over 100 km away. The summit route (5‚Äì8 hours, hard)  The ascent  Follow signs to the ‚ÄòTemple des Eaux‚Äô through the town. Continue past the temple on a road winding up the mountain to higher regions. Keep driving along this steep road for just over 10 kilometres until you reach a big white building on your left (Sidi Bougabrine). From here you should be able to see the summit fairly clearly to the south-south-east. Leading straight to the summit is a fairly steep ridge. Walk back along the road (from the building) for a kilometre until you are where the road intersects the ridge that is now to the south- east below a small rock face. There is also a parking space here but probably only big enough for 2 cars. From this point, (36¬∞21‚Äô54 N; 10¬∞06‚Äô13 E) leave the road and head up south-east onto the ridge. There is no path and pushing through undergrowth may be tricky. Some scrambling will also be involved. Once having gained the ridge, it is a fairly straightforward scramble to the top. Just continue along the top of the ridge until you run out of mountain! The route is arduous, and the terrain is very rocky or overgrown. Expect some tricky scrambling and exposure near the summit. When you reach the top (under 3 hours for a group of fit people), you will see that there are actually two peaks, the further one is barely higher than the first, but is the true summit.  The descent  Drop southwest off the summit, following a large gulley, but staying on the western shoulder. This descent is particularly steep and frustrating, as the rocks are too large to scree glissade, while small enough to easily twist an ankle. Keep going southwest down this shoulder until it starts flattening out, (36¬∞21‚Äô03 N; 10¬∞06‚Äô22 E) you then come across a series of old mining excavations. Some are deep shafts delving into the belly of the mountain. Please proceed with caution as these have not been used for a long time. Past the mine shafts where the shoulder widens out and flattens (dotted with a few trees), head southwest off the end of the shoulder (36¬∞20‚Äô58 N; 10¬∞06‚Äô11 E) below a buttress of rock and you should find an old mining track (keep a good eye out as this is not very visible). Follow this track heading north along the southern flank of the ridge you ascended for over ¬Ω a kilometre. Keep an eye out on the left for a drinking pool for livestock in the valley below. Leave the track and head down towards this.

The Whitby and Pickering Railway (W&P;) was built to halt the gradual decline of the port of Whitby on the east coast of England. Its basic industries‚Äîwhaling and shipbuilding‚Äîhad been in decline and it was believed that opening transport links inland would help regenerate the town and port. Until the turnpike to Pickering was opened in 1759, Whitby was better connected to the rest of the country by sea than by land; even then the difficult climb over the high moors was an obstacle. Stagecoach services did not start until 1795 and mail coaches (thrice weekly) until 1823. The Whitby and Pickering Railway opened in stages in 1836 (being one of the earliest railways in Yorkshire) and was worked by a horses until it was absorbed into the York and North Midland Railway in 1845 and was converted into a conventional double tracked steam-worked railway. History The W&P;, a horse drawn railway In 1795 it was proposed to construct a canal from Whitby to Pickering along much the same course as the later railway. After the success of the Stockton and Darlington Railway, which had a number of Whitby backers, attention switched to the possibility of a railway from Whitby to either Stockton or Pickering. Many pamphlets were issued for or against the various proposals; copies of some can be found in the library of the Whitby Literary and Philosophical Society. In 1832 George Stephenson was asked to report on the rival routes. Stephenson's report favoured a horse-worked railway to Pickering and his conclusion was accepted at a meeting in Whitby on 14 September 1832. The Whitby and Pickering Railway bill received the royal assent, from William IV, on 6 May 1833. The directors of the W&P; Company mainly came from Whitby or the immediate area and represented a cross section of the business community, including bankers, solicitors, shipbuilders and ship owners. The shareholders came from a wider area, some from London but those from the immediate area predominated. Construction and engineering thumb|300px|The 'Invitation to Tender' for constructing the first of the railway. thumb|right|300px|The 'Invitation to Tender' for constructing the final of the railway. The W&P; directors invited the first tenders for the construction of at the Whitby end of the railway by August 1833 and in October 1834 tenders for the final 8.5 miles (the 'central division' of the railway) were invited. The tender was awarded to Hamer and Pratt, who had just finished work on the Leeds and Selby Railway. There was an intention to link the W&P; to York and beyond; a meeting held in York in September 1834 to further the proposed railway from York to Leeds was attended by a W&P; delegation accompanied by engineer, George Stephenson, to lobby for a link to Pickering. The meeting may have been the first meeting of George Stephenson and George Hudson and bore fruit even though the York to Leeds Line was not built for some years. The Whitby and Pickering Railway (W&P;), was one of the first railways in Yorkshire, when it opened in 1836 as a single track horse worked railway. Its total length was 24 miles. George Stephenson planned to ascend from the valley of the Murk Esk at Beckhole to the high moors at Goathland by means of a long rope-worked incline at an average gradient of 1 in 15. \\"The method of working was that of a self‚Äëacting incline common in mines, but here, differing from the case of a mine, the load was equal each way, and so there was attached to each train a water‚Äëtank ; this was filled with water at the top of the incline, and its preponderating weight as it descended pulled the other train up the hill ; arrived at the bottom, the water‚Äëtank was emptied and was sent up with the next train\\".Smith, J.F., (1888) Frederick Swanwick: A Sketch, Printed for private circulation He would cross Fen Bog, near the summit of the line, using the same method, hurdles and fascines, he had previously used to cross Chat Moss on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The track consisted of wrought iron fish-bellied rails in lengths with five 'bellies' to each length, at 40 lb. to the yard. Cast iron chairs supported the rail between each 'belly', special double chairs supported the joints between lengths of rail. The chairs were fastened to locally quarried stone blocks using iron pins. A length of original track is displayed at Pickering Station. Stephenson in fact acted mainly in an advisory capacity, having delegated the work to his chief engineer Frederick Swanwick. The W&P; obtained materials by tender and suppliers were from many parts of the country; the rails, chairs and pins (which were in short supply partly due to heavy demand) were obtained from well-known suppliers including Bradley & Foster's Stourbridge Ironworks, the Capponfield Ironworks near Birmingham, the Nantyglo Ironworks, Monmouthshire and the Bedlington Ironworks in Northumberland. Supplies largely travelled by water. The surviving W&P; minute books in the National Archives show that supplies from the Midlands travelled by narrow boat to Gainsborough, where they were transshipped to coasters for forwarding to Whitby, others travelled by boat to Malton on the Derwent Navigation and were forwarded to Pickering by ox-cart. The total cost of the line was ¬£80,000, but with extra land purchased for probable enlargements, the cost was about ¬£105,000, or ¬£4,400 per mile. As one commentator put it \\"This is a good example of careful and conscientious work, no unnecessary expenditure, but a railway suited to the needs of the time, constructed at the smallest possible cost.\\" Operations and traffic thumb|300px|The details of early Whitby and Pickering Railway services, together with an advertisement for Belcher's book on the W&P.; Although the W&P; had been promoted to carry coal, stone, timber and limestone, it was intended to carry passengers from the start and three coaches were obtained (the first, from Beeston & Melling of Manchester) which were basically stage coaches adapted for use on a railway and a number of cheaper open market coaches were obtained, probably locally. The first class coaches were named Premier, Transit and Lady Hilda. The W&P; was never a well off company and the directors were anxious to carry passengers and goods at the earliest opportunity and on Monday 8 June 1835 the line between Whitby and the Tunnel Inn (now Grosmont) was opened, and its first class coach, Premier left Whitby at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, returning about 8 o'clock. The company subsequently ran two return journeys per day except on Sundays. In July 1835, for Ruswarp Fair the company provided a special coach that ran sixteen trips during the day between Whitby and Ruswarp which proved very popular some passengers travelling repeatedly because of the novelty. horse tunnel at Grosmont. Dodgson, . When the whole line opened on 26 May 1836, the W&P; operated a regular passenger service which connected at Pickering with the stagecoach to York and the rest of the developing railway network. There is a recorded instance of a ship from the Baltic docking at Whitby and its captain finding orders awaiting him to proceed to Liverpool. He took the W&P; coach to Pickering connecting to York where he boarded a train for Manchester (connecting by coach over the incomplete part of the Leeds and Manchester Railway) and completed his journey to Liverpool by train ‚Äì the whole journey only took hours, whereas it could have taken many days only a few years earlier. Whilst the introduction of railways (steam or horse powered) generally spelt the end of coach services on directly competing routes, it provided opportunities for feeder coach services as shown on the advertisement for 'The Queen' coach put on between Scarborough, Pickering and Helmsley only two months after the W&P; opened. The Y&NM;, the introduction of steam power When the W&P; was absorbed into the York and North Midland Railway in 1845 and into George Hudson's growing empire, the railway was rebuilt as a double track steam-worked railway and connected to the Y&NM;'s York to Scarborough Line being built at Rillington junction. Through rail journeys became possible from Whitby to the industrial districts of the West Riding, Hull, Manchester, Liverpool, London and other destinations. Whitby became accessible to day-trippers and holidaymakers. To encourage traffic George Hudson formed a company to develop the West Cliff in Whitby, building roads and hotels before work stopped at Hudson's downfall in 1849. With a connected national rail network the Royal Mail used the railways to carry mail. The first train from York to Whitby each morning was the mail train, a train that continued running for the best part of one hundred and twenty years. The conversion of the line from horse to steam power took place in stages; the first steam train service between Pickering and Levisham started on 1 September 1846 using a single track. By the following year a second track had been laid and was passed for use by Her Majesty's Railway Inspector Captain RE Coddington in a report dated 8 June 1847 following an inspection three days earlier. The same report did not approve opening the line between Levisham and the 'top of the Incline' at Goathland as 'over this portion the rails were ill adjusted, the sleepers irregular, the ballasting incomplete & some pairs of Contractors joints & shifting Rails remaining'. Approval was given for opening the line from the bottom of the Incline to Whitby but allowed the use of only a single engine. A further report dated 30 June 1847 following a second inspection the previous day, found a much improved state of affairs, one track was complete and the second within a day of completion. Captain Coddington summed up that 'I am of opinion that the line may be opened with safety on the 1st Inst according to the wish of the Company'. It is clear from Capt. Coddington's reports that the horse-drawn coaches continued to run until replaced by steam trains. The wooden sleepers required for rebuilding the line appear to have been imported from the Baltic to Whitby, details of several shiploads of sleepers are held in the National Archives. Following the discovery of apparent financial irregularities by George Hudson, the Y&NM; appointed a committee of investigation whose four printed reports includes severe criticism of the purchase and conversion of the W&P;:. > Your Committee have no precise information with respect to the manner in > which this purchase was brought about, but it would seem that the proposal > came in the first instance from the directors of the Whitby & Pickering > Company.

Elsewhere in the reports the Committee of Investigation summarise the costs (to date) for the Whitby branch: > To purchase of Whitby & Pickering (horse) Railway, 23¬Ω miles (¬£80,000) and > reconstruct it for locomotives. Authorized share and loan capital ¬£180,000. > Estimated expenditure to 30th June 1849: ¬£468,000. They also summarise the operating income and expenditure (in an extract from details covering the whole Y&NM;): > Total traffic for year 1848 > Whitby & Pickering ¬£11,323 > Working charges including depreciation, duty & rates ¬£8,172 > Net Receipts ¬£3,151 The York and North Midland Railway was one of three railways that formed the North Eastern Railway in 1854. In 1923 The North Eastern Railway was absorbed into the London and North Eastern Railway as part of the grouping of the railways following the First World War. In 1948 all the major railway companies in Great Britain were nationalised forming British Railways. Closure and rebirth The line from Rillington Junction to Whitby closed as a result of the Beeching Report along with most of Whitby's railway links. The Esk Valley Line was reprieved saving of the original W&P; between Whitby and Grosmont. In 1967 the North Yorkshire Moors Railway Preservation Society (NYMRPS) was formed with the aim of preserving the line between Grosmont and Pickering and re-opened as a Heritage Steam Railway. The NYMRPS became a charitable trust, the North York Moors Historical Railway Trust Ltd and succeeded in re-opening the line as the North Yorkshire Moors Railway (NYMR) in 1973. The route of the W&P; survived. On 8 February 2005 the Company was re-born as a private company for the benefit of the NYMR and is registered at Companies House in name with NYMR operating the route. In 2007 the NYMR obtained the necessary powers and agreements to operate steam trains over the Network Rail line from Grosmont to Whitby and as far as Battersby, the first UK heritage railway to do so; so steam trains once again run between Whitby and Pickering.

And for any parameter N \\\\ge L + M - 1,\\\\, it is equivalent to the N-point circular convolution of x_k[n]\\\\, with h[n]\\\\, in the . The advantage is that the circular convolution can be computed more efficiently than linear convolution, according to the circular convolution theorem: where: *DFTN and IDFTN refer to the Discrete Fourier transform and its inverse, evaluated over N discrete points, and * is customarily chosen such that is an integer power-of-2, and the transforms are implemented with the FFT algorithm, for efficiency. Pseudocode The following is a pseudocode of the algorithm: (Overlap-add algorithm for linear convolution) h = FIR_impulse_response M = length(h) Nx = length(x) N = 8 √ó M (see next section for a better choice) step_size = N - (M-1) H = DFT(h, N) position = 0 y(1 : Nx + M-1) = 0 while position + step_size ‚â§ Nx do y(position+(1:N)) = y(position+(1:N)) + IDFT(DFT(x(position+(1:step_size)), N) √ó H) position = position + step_size end  Efficiency considerations  Fig 2: A graph of the values of N (an integer power of 2) that minimize the cost function \\\\tfrac{N\\\\left(\\\\log_2 N + 1\\\\right)}{N - M + 1} When the DFT and IDFT are implemented by the FFT algorithm, the pseudocode above requires about complex multiplications for the FFT, product of arrays, and IFFT. Each iteration produces output samples, so the number of complex multiplications per output sample is about: For example, when M=201 and N=1024, equals 13.67, whereas direct evaluation of would require up to 201 complex multiplications per output sample, the worst case being when both x and h are complex-valued. Also note that for any given M, has a minimum with respect to N. Figure 2 is a graph of the values of N that minimize for a range of filter lengths (M). Instead of , we can also consider applying to a long sequence of length N_x samples. The total number of complex multiplications would be: :N_x\\\\cdot (\\\\log_2(N_x) + 1). Comparatively, the number of complex multiplications required by the pseudocode algorithm is: :N_x\\\\cdot (\\\\log_2(N) + 1)\\\\cdot \\\\frac{N}{N-M+1}. Hence the cost of the overlap‚Äìadd method scales almost as O\\\\left(N_x\\\\log_2 N\\\\right) while the cost of a single, large circular convolution is almost O\\\\left(N_x\\\\log_2 N_x \\\\right). The two methods are also compared in Figure 3, created by Matlab simulation. The contours are lines of constant ratio of the times it takes to perform both methods. When the overlap-add method is faster, the ratio exceeds 1, and ratios as high as 3 are seen. Fig 3: Gain of the overlap-add method compared to a single, large circular convolution.

They are most often used in orchestral and theater music.Blades, James, Percussion Instruments and their History, (Westport, CT: Bold Strummer, 1992), 393, 401.Baines, Anthony, The Oxford Companion to Musical Instruments, (New York: Oxford University Press, 1992), 34-35.  History  Bell plates were first developed and implemented as percussion instruments in ancient Asia, but did not enter into Western music until the late 19th century. This instrument then became popular, particularly in theater music, in the early 20th century.  Construction  Bell plates are made of sheets of aluminum or bronze, ranging in size from and to and . The range of the instrument typically covers 4 octaves in the form of a C-major scale, totalling 29 total plates. However, different sets of may contain different combinations of plates according to the needs of the owner. The plates are typically suspended from a semicircular frame and are occasionally fitted with resonators to enhance volume and the sounding of low partials.Peinkofer, Karl; Tannigel, Fritz. Handbook of Percussion Instruments (Mainz, Germany: Schott, 1976), 67-69. A variation of the bell plate is the Burma bell, a distinctively shaped bell plate that is often mounted using a single hole, allowing it to spin when struck, producing doppler effects.  Playing techniques  Bell plates can be played while suspended from a stand or while held in one hand of the performer depending of the number of different plates needed for a specific performance. If only one plate is needed, then the performer will simply hold that specific plate with one hand and strike it with the other. This plate can be kept on a table covered with a towel or carpet square while not being played. If the performance requires several plates to be played in succession, then the plates should be suspended from a stand. The player then strikes the plates with a wooden, hard plastic, or metal mallet which can be covered in varying thicknesses of felt to create a variety of sounds. A softer mallet, which has a thicker felt covering, can achieve a greater sounding of the fundamental pitch of the plate, while a harder mallet with a thinner covering of felt will produce stronger overtones and possibly overshadow the fundamental pitch of the plate. The sound can also be manipulated by striking different areas of the plate. Greater volume can be achieved by striking the center of the lower or upper third of the instrument, and a clearer pitch can be produced by striking the plate at the center or near the bottom edge.

According to the historian Tyrannius Rufinus, he was converted to Christianity with his brother Ezana by the missionary Frumentius. With his brother, he resisted the attempts of the Christian Roman emperor Constantius II to relieve Frumentius of his post as bishop and replace him with an Arian (which was a different sect of Christianity). Saizana was sent by King Ezana with his other brother Hadefa (alternatively spelled Adiphan, Adefa) to quell an uprising by the Beja.

The characters listed are almost all fictional, except for stars who appear as themselves. Still others, such as Aunt Dolly, intentionally blur the line between fiction and non-fiction. Main characters Miley Stewart Miley Ray Stewart (Miley Cyrus) is the teen main character of Hannah Montana. As her alter ego, Hannah Montana, she secretly lives a double life as a famous pop star. One of the concept names for her alter ego was Alexis Texas, but the writers learned there was an adult entertainer with the same name of Alexis Texas. Eventually the writers decided to use the real first name of the star, Miley Cyrus. Her best friends are Lilly and Oliver. She tries to keep the fact that she is Hannah Montana a secret but has told several people during the duration of the series, such as Lilly, Oliver, Sienna, Jake, and Jesse. Her main love interests are Jake and Jesse, along with occasional crushes. She is known to say \\"Sweet niblets!\\" \\"Ya think?\\" and \\"Say what?\\" as her catch phrases. She also has the best of both worlds. Her rivals, when she is Miley, are Amber and Ashley. She is like any other girl, facing challenges, but endures it with the help of family and friends. She has tons of wardrobe changes. Robby Stewart Robby Ray Stewart (Billy Ray Cyrus) is the widower father of Jackson and Miley Stewart. He is also Hannah Montana's manager, who was a former country singer. As Miley's father, he is also referred to as Hannah's father whenever they appear together publicly. Even though he does wear a fake mustache and a hat as a disguise, he does not use a fake name. He takes pride in his hair, and his shampoo collection. Whenever one of Hannah's song becomes a hit, instead of attributing it to the singer, he, jokingly, takes the credit himself. He is a loving and caring father, but knows when serious discipline is necessary. Jackson Stewart Jackson Rod Stewart (Jason Earles) is the older teenage brother of Miley Stewart and son of Robby Stewart (he is possibly named after singer Rod Stewart). He is known for his goofy, lazy and disgusting habits. Jackson is a very regular character in Hannah Montana. In the episode \\"He Could Be the One\\", Jackson does not take part in the actual story, but appears as a third-person omniscient narrator, although even in this role he appears in character. Jackson also has a central role in the feature film Hannah Montana: The Movie. Despite portraying a teen, Jason Earles was in his late twenties when he started the show. When the show ended, he was in his mid thirties. Like the rest of his family, Jackson is from Tennessee. He moved to Malibu, California with his father Robby and sister Miley after the death of his mother. In an off-handed remark in \\"Song Sung Bad,\\" Jackson implausibly suggests the reason for this move involved an embarrassing incident with a Tennessean girlfriend. When Jackson first attended school in California he was made fun of because of his accent, cowboy hat, boots, and large belt buckle with shining bright lights which he wore to school. Jackson and Miley constantly bicker and compete for their father's approval. Miley often finds Jackson's antics disgusting and Jackson thinks Miley is too full of herself sometimes. Yet on a deeper level, both Miley and Jackson privately express love and appreciation for each other like a normal brother-sister relationship. On several occasions Jackson even goes to great lengths to help Miley when she gets herself in serious trouble. Despite being the first born, and therefore having high expectations from Robby, Jackson constantly lives under Miley's, or rather Hannah's, shadow. Unlike Robby, Lilly and Oliver, Jackson does not attend Hannah events in disguise. This is at first because he exploits his connection with Hannah to impress his dates.The opposite of this plays out in \\"When You Wish You Were the Star.\\" Jackson gets tired of people pretending to be his friends just to get close to Hannah and moves out of the house and becomes a hermit. This takes place in a parallel universe in which Miley is Hannah all the time. Later, in \\"My Boyfriend's Jackson and There's Gonna Be Trouble\\" a paparazzi follows Miley and Jackson home from a concert and reports that they are dating. After this incident, Jackson publicly declares his love for Hannah is \\"like a sister,\\" but still keeps her secret. In \\"We Are Family: Now Get Me Some Water!\\" he openly works as Hannah's \\"assistant.\\" He also sometimes works as her chauffeur.\\"She's a Supersneak\\" and \\"Bye Bye Ball\\" While working as Hannah's chauffeur, Jackson is sometimes forced to miss his own activities. He reveals in \\"Bad Moose Rising\\" that he really does not mind driving her, as long as she shows appreciation. After Miley gets her license in the third season this is no longer an issue. Also Jackson states that even though they prank each other, he would never bring it into the \\"Hannah World\\". Lilly Truscott Lillian \\"Lilly\\" TruscottLillian Truscott spoken by Mamaw in \\"You Give Lunch a Bad Name\\" (closed captions confirm) (Emily Osment) is the best friend of Miley Stewart and girlfriend to Oliver Oken on seasons 3 and 4. When Miley is Hannah, Lilly is under the alias Lola Luftnagle, and also \\"Lola LaFonda.\\" She is also close friends with Hannah Montana and part of her entourage. Lilly/Lola has a huge crush on Orlando Bloom in the episode \\"The Test Of My Love\\", and tells Miley that she will see \\"the Lilly Bloom\\" when Orlando finally meets her. She also plays a central role in the film Hannah Montana: The Movie. The character was originally named Lilly Romero and then changed to Lilly Truscott. Miley Cyrus first auditioned for the role but was cast as the main character instead.Hannah Montana DVD Livin' the Rock Star Life special feature \\"Miley's Audition Tapes.\\" Emily Osment auditioned for the role after Cyrus was cast. Lilly was born in and grew up in California and was childhood friends with Oliver. She met Oliver in kindergarten and has been best friends with him ever since. In Judge Me Tender, she describes him as a dead beat when she first met him. She recently lived with her mother Heather Truscott (Heather Locklear) in Malibu. Heather appears in one episode, \\"Lilly's Mom Has Got It Goin' On,\\" where she briefly dates Miley's father Robby. Lilly's parents are divorced, and her father is an accountant. In season one Lilly claims to have a brother but this is contradicted by her in season three. In \\"Miley Get Your Gum,\\" Lilly refers to her brother's pet hamster. However, in the episode \\"Cheat it\\" Lilly says \\"Sometimes I wish I had a brother, then I come over here. All better!\\" In the season 3 episode \\"The Wheel Near My Bed (Keeps on Turnin'),\\" she moves in with the Stewarts' when her mother gets a job in Atlanta. But after she hears that Miley does not like her staying with them, she goes to stay at her dad Kenneth's (Jon Cryer) apartment only to find it even worse than the Stewart's house. Once Lilly and Miley make up, Lilly goes back to staying at the Stewart's house. Lilly and Miley have been best friends since about the 6th grade.In \\"Lilly's Mom Has Got It Goin' On\\" Miley talks about her and Lilly's custom of celebrating their friendship's \\"weekiversary.\\" Miley mentions missing their 200th weekiversary, which is almost four years. This episode takes place during their 9th grade year. She discovers Miley's secret in the pilot episode, \\"Lilly, Do You Want to Know a Secret?\\" when she sneaks into Hannah's dressing room after a concert and she sees the lucky bracelet that she had given Miley earlier in the episode. Although Lilly is dating Oliver, she looks at other guys. In \\"Once, Twice, Three Times Afraidy\\", she gazed at Tim, an old friend from camp, causing Oliver to point to the menu on the side, showing his muscles. Also in \\"He Could Be The One\\", she gave advice to Miley stating \\"whatever choice you make, it's gonna be okay... let's face it, they're both gorgeous!\\", making Oliver mad. Other than that, she stays faithful to him. In order to help Miley keep her secret, Lilly attends all Hannah Montana events wearing a disguise and posing as Hannah's companion and assistant \\"Lola Luftnagle.\\" Lilly first comes up with the name \\"Lola LaFonda\\" for her alter ego in the episode \\"Miley Get Your Gum\\", but she would later settle on Luftnagle in \\"It's My Party And I'll Lie If I Want To\\" and that name is used in all subsequent episodes. Lilly claims that Lola is the \\"daughter of oil baron Rudolph Luftnagle, [and] sister of socialites Bunny and Kiki Luftnagle.\\" Another alter ego of Lilly's is Lola LaBamba, whose wig is turquoise. Unlike Lilly, who wears a lot of hoodies/jackets, sneakers/sandals and sporty pants, Lola wears very tight clothes that have loud colors. Emily Osment once said in a backstage interview that Lola has some very tight pants that are impossible to sit in. Lola wears a lot of jewellery like rings, necklaces, huge earrings and bangles. Lola usually wears a short, brightly colored, wig but in Season 3 the wig is a little bit longer than the wigs used in Season 1 and 2. In most episodes Lola wears a differently colored wig, from white to red to purple to pink to blue (in one episode Traci Van Horne refers to Lola as a \\"bitter anime character\\"). Emily Osment has said that she has around 80 wigs for Lola, and that her personal favorites are the purple and white wigs. Lola is not dating Mike as said in \\"He Could Be The One\\". Instead she is dating Justin Timberlake, according to an internet rumor she has 'no idea' who started. Emily Osment said in a backstage interview that she is more like Lola than Lilly and that she loves Lola's clothes and just wants to keep them. Lola did not appear in Hannah Montana: The Movie. Lilly experiences a few short-lived dating relationships and only one serious one. She dates actor Jake Ryan (Cody Linley) at a 70s dance until Miley's jealously breaks them up, and her schoolmate Lucas (Sterling Knight) until Miley discovers he is a cheater. Miley also has a dream in which Lilly starts dating Jackson, and must learn to accept her friend for who she is. When Miley wakes up, she believes the dream was real and is pleasantly surprised when Lilly reacts with disgust. In \\"You Are So Sue-able to Me,\\" Lilly has a crush on her schoolmate Matt Marshall, but it is never revealed if they actually dated. After Matt asks Lilly to a dance, Miley tries to get Lilly to change her tomboy image so that Matt will find her more attractive. However, Matt gets turned off by Lilly's new look and stands her up. However, Lilly and Matt reconcile at the end of the episode after Miley was found liable for Lilly's suffering in the Teen Court. Lilly's celebrity crush is Orlando Bloom. Bloom is a recurring off- screen character in the show whom Lilly sometimes harasses at parties as Lola. She also has a crush on Justin Timberlake and supposedly spread a rumor that he's dating Lola. In the season 3 episode \\"Uptight (Oliver's Alright)\\", it is mentioned that Lilly had a crush on her French teacher during 7th grade. She wore a beret to school and said \\"Oui, Oui\\" so much that people started calling her \\"Tinkles Truscott\\". Lilly starts her most significant and successful relationship when she started dating Oliver Oken in season 3 of the series. Their friendship started in preschool when Lilly held his hand in order to share his crayons. Said Lilly, \\"He had the 64-Pack with the sharpener!\\" For years the two were best friends, but after a beach party, they decide to date each other (while Miley was away shooting her feature film Indiana Joannie) and we (and Miley) find out in \\"What I Don't Like About You.\\" However, after an argument over their favorite bands, (Radiohead and Coldplay) they broke up. Miley made a mini-Indiana Joannie movie and they made up and resumed dating. They attended prom together in Promma Mia. In \\"He Could Be The One,\\" Lilly says she loves Oliver. Their names for each other are \\"Olly-pop\\" and \\"Lilly- pop.\\" In \\"I Honestly Love You (No Not You)\\" Lilly tells Miley that Oliver calls her \\"Lilly-pop\\" because she had a pimple. In I Honestly Love You (No Not You) a love triangle appears when Miley (while asleep in the hospital because of a broken ankle), overhears Oliver say \\"I love you\\" while talking to Miley. This leads to Miley believing that Oliver was in love with her while dating Lilly. Miley thinks that all she has to do is wait till Lilly moves onto someone else and that Oliver will change his mind. But when Lilly announces that she loves Oliver, Miley tells her the truth. Miley and Lilly then hatch a plan to get Oliver back only to find out that Oliver was in fact, practicing saying \\"I love you\\" so he could say it to Lilly. In the end of the episode, Lilly and Oliver both say that they love each other. However, in \\"He Could Be The One,\\" Lilly tells Oliver that while Lilly may be dating Oliver, Lola is dating Justin Timberlake according to an online rumor \\"she doesn't know who started.\\" In \\"B-B-B-Bad To The Chrome,\\" Lilly and Oliver celebrated their 100th day relationship anniversary which Oliver forgets at first and Lilly was upset. They make-up again after Rico helped them get back together by writing a fake poem and send it to Lilly but signed as \\"Oliver Oken.\\" In the episode \\"Judge Me Tender\\", Oliver's singing career takes off, but all the attention he receives causes him to neglect Lilly. As a result, Lilly asks Miley to boot him off the show which results in them breaking up. However, Miley lets Oliver succeed to the semi-finals. Afterward, Miley manages to talk some sense into Oliver, causing him to make up with Lilly. Oliver Oken Oliver Oscar Oken (Mitchel Musso) is the male best friend to Miley Stewart and Lilly Truscott. He later begins to date Lilly. He uses the alias Mike Standley III while attending events with Hannah Montana in order to keep Miley's secret. He often refers to himself in the third-person as \\"Smokin' Oken\\". Oliver was born July 3, 1992 and grew up in California and was childhood friends and Kindergarten friends with Lilly. In Judge Me Tender, Lilly describes him as a dead beat when she first met him. He met Miley in the 6th grade and has been her closest guy friend ever since. However, before he met her, he had spread a rumour that she ate possum. He lives with his mother Nancy Oken who works as a police officer, his overprotective father, and a little brother. Oliver also has type 1 diabetes. Oliver is Jewish, as revealed in a few episodes. He says his family keeps Kosher, and says his mom goes Mashugana, \\"crazy\\" in Yiddish. In the first two episodes, Oliver is an overly enthusiastic Hannah Montana fan, saying \\"Hannah Montana is a goddess! I worship at her feet!\\" He has a record of stalking her and even dreams of one day marrying her. Miley mercifully reveals her secret to Oliver in the second episode. Since he has never had any romantic feelings for Miley, Oliver is freed from his Hannah obsession, but remains close personal friends with Miley. He makes a brief appearance in Hannah Montana: The Movie at Lilly's sweet 16th birthday party and in the credits doing the Hoedown Throwdown. He and Rico are the only main characters from the series to have small roles in the film. Oliver has a small role in the film because Mitchel Musso was working on his music career during the filming. In the episode \\"Everybody Was Best-Friend Fighting,\\" Oliver creates a disguise to attend Hannah events without blowing Miley's secret, similar to how Lilly created Lola Luftnagle. Lilly helps Oliver come up with the disguise which consists of a fake goatee, aviator sunglasses, an upside-down visor, white and blue shorts and a zip-up hoodie since he only had a vampire costume as a disguise so Lilly helped him. When asked for his name, Oliver thinks of the name \\"Mike Standley III\\", being inspired by a nearby mic stand. Mike is not dating Lola, as said in \\"He Could Be the One\\". Oliver has several dating relationships, but only two of them have been successful. He first dates Becca Weller whom Miley sets him up with after Becca confesses her feelings for Oliver to Hannah Montana in an email. (Becca was unaware that Hannah knew Oliver.) It is unknown how Oliver and Becca break up, but she only appears in one episode. Oliver later dates his classmate Sarah (Morgan York) with whom he is assigned a school project in which they must raise an imaginary child (a sack of flour). They break up after the project is due when they discover they have nothing in common, except their love for their imaginary flour child. So far, Oliver's second longest relationship has been with Joannie Palumbo (Hayley Chase), whom he starts dating in \\"Joannie B. Goode.\\" Miley and Lilly at first have a lot of animosity towards Joannie, but eventually Lilly becomes good friends with her and Miley accepts their relationship. Oliver and Joannie's relationship lasts for 11 more episodes until their amicable break up in \\"Papa's Got a Brand New Friend.\\" Oliver's most significant relationship and longest is with Lilly Truscott when they started dating in season 3 of the series. In pre-school, Lilly held Oliver's hand for his crayons, with the reasoning, \\"He had the 64-pack with the sharpener!\\" For years, the two were best friends, but after a beach party they decided to start dating and we first see this in \\"What I Don't Like About You\\" while Miley was away shooting her feature film Indiana Joannie. However, after an argument over their favourite bands (Radiohead and Coldplay) they broke up but Miley, made a mini- Indiana Joannie movie and they made up and resumed dating. They attended prom together in Promma Mia. The circumstances of their first date are under dispute by both Lilly and Oliver. In He Could Be The One, Lilly says that she loves Oliver. Their names for each other are Ollie-pop and Lilly-pop. In I Honestly Love You (No Not You) a love triangle appears when Miley (while asleep in the hospital because of a broken ankle), overhears Oliver say \\"I love you\\" while talking to Miley. This leads to Miley believing that Oliver was in love with her while dating Lilly. Miley thinks that all she has to do is wait till Lilly moves onto someone else and that Oliver will change his mind. But when Lilly announces that she loves Oliver, Miley tells her the truth. Miley and Lilly then hatch a plan to get Oliver back only to find out that Oliver was in fact, practicing saying \\"I love you\\" so he could say it to Lilly. In the end of episode Lilly and Oliver both say that they love each other. It is also mentioned in this episode that Lilly is the only girl he has ever loved. In \\"B-B-B-Bad To The Chrome,\\" Lilly and Oliver celebrated their 100th day relationship anniversary which Oliver forgets at first and Lilly was upset. They make-up again after Rico helped them get back together by writing a fake poem and send it to Lilly but signed as \\"Oliver Oken\\". It is also revealed in this episode that whenever he and Lilly are not together, he gets in a bad mood. In the episode \\"Judge Me Tender,\\" Oliver's singing career takes off, but all the attention he receives causes him to neglect Lilly. As a result, Lilly asks Miley to boot him off the show which results in them breaking up. However, Miley lets Oliver succeed to the semi-finals. Afterward, Miley manages to talk some sense into Oliver, causing him to make up with Lilly. In \\"Got to Get Her out of My House\\", Oliver and Lilly try and buy a car together. Also in the same episode, Rico insults Lilly and makes Oliver very angry to the point he tries to beat him up, much to Rico's delight. The final episode they say I love you to each other again and kiss. Oliver's celebrity crushes include Hannah Montana (until he finds out that Miley is Hannah), Mandy Moore, Jessica Simpson and Taylor Swift. Rico Suave Rico SuaveThe name Rico is Spanish for \\"rich.\\" (Mois√©s Arias) is the young manager of \\"Rico's Surf Shop,\\" a concession stand located on the beach near the Stewarts' home. He most commonly interacts with Jackson, his employee, despite the fact that Rico is several years younger. In the second season he also attends school with Miley, Lilly, and Oliver. Rico is the only main character unaware of Miley's double life. Rico's first appearance is in \\"It's My Party and I'll Lie if I Want To\\", the fifth episode of Hannah Montana. He makes a total of five appearance in that season as a recurring character. His popularity led to his becoming a main character beginning with season two. All together, Rico has appeared in 58 episodes. He also makes a brief appearance in the film Hannah Montana: The Movie during Lilly's birthday party bash exploding through her cake. Although Rico does not know Miley's secret, he appears partly out of character in the episode \\"He Could Be the One\\" as an omniscient narrator who is aware of the secret. In this role Rico acts apart from the story. In the episode \\"Get Down Study-udy-udy\\", Rico had almost discovered Miley's secret according to the steps, the song used in the \\"Bone Dance\\" created by Miley and her voice. When Miley reveals herself on television as Hannah, Rico is shocked and horrified that he couldn't see the obvious, unable to talk to anyone afterward. Rico comes from a very wealthy Latino family. His billionaire parents are often mentioned but never seen. He has a sister, a brother named Mateo (Mateo Arias), a cousin named Teresa, and an Australian/Mexican cousin nicknamed \\"Angus\\" whose real name is Alejandro Nu√±ez Gonzalez Uberto Sifuentes (Mois√©s Arias). Jackson and Rico have a frenemy relationship. Rico often comes up with ways of making Jackson miserable or getting him in trouble. He is an unforgiving employer and sometimes fires Jackson, only to re-hire him later. Rico is usually successful in his practical jokes on Jackson because of his virtually unlimited financial resources. On a few rare occasions Jackson gets the last laugh with Rico, as seen in \\"Hannah In The Streets With Diamonds.\\" (Rico called Jackson and his father 'country dumpkins', and Jackson got angry.) In \\"Once, Twice, Three Times Afraidy\\" he tells Jackson that he is the closest thing to a best friend he has. In \\"Wherever I Go\\", Rico fires Jackson to force him to get a real job. After he fails, Rico gets him a real job as a video game tester saying (though it was hard for him) that Jackson is his best friend which Jackson reciprocates. When Miley reveals herself to be Hannah, Jackson at first gloats over Rico not knowing the secret but takes pity on him and cheers him up by having a choir sing of all the other people who didn't figure it out, such as Donald Trump. The relationship Oliver and Rico have is practically the same as Jackson and Rico. Rico sometimes looks to Oliver as an older brother, but also as a target. He usually sees Oliver's complications and uses them against him, such as in \\"Don't Go Breaking My Tooth\\". He also takes heed in making fun and manipulating Jackson and Oliver, such as in \\"That's What Friends Are For?.\\" When it comes to business matters, such as making a commercial for Rico's, he turns to Oliver. He also thinks of Oliver as a much more efficient employee than Jackson, as he once got a job and Rico said he was perfect. Oliver is also seen working at Rico's again in season 3 in the episode \\"B-B-B-Bad To The Chrome\\" as well as in season 1 in the episode \\"We Are Family ‚Äì Now Get Me Some Water\\". Major recurring characters Jake Ryan \\"Dude, I slayed you once; don't make me slay you again!\\" Jake Ryan makes a dramatic introduction to his classmates in \\"New Kid in School\\". Leslie \\"Jake\\" Ryan portrayed by Cody Linley (season 1‚Äì4) is an Emmy- nominated television and film actor best known for his role as a zombie slayer on the teen sitcom Zombie High. He had an on/off relationship with Miley, something that has been ongoing throughout much of the series. Jake got his start in acting as a baby, appearing in commercials for \\"Wonder Diapers\\". He later got his big break in Zombie High (Buffy the Vampire Slayer parody) and went on to star in feature films such as Teen Bigfoot, Teen Gladiator and the Sword of Fire, and Roger Buck: Intergalactic Bounty Hunter (Buck Rogers parody). He claims that his box office appeal is just as big as Shia LaBeouf's. He also makes a brief appearance in the show Gotcha! (Candid Camera and Punk'd parody). Jake first meets Miley at Seaview Middle School where he attends as a part-time learner before relocating. Jake's arrival at Seaview causes a big stir among the students who are all big fans of Zombie High and are starstruck at meeting him. Jake basks in the attention, although Miley, who is a superstar herself, fails to be impressed at his star power and believes that Jake should be treated as a normal kid. This is what first attracts Jake to Miley, and with time, Miley begins to realize that she has feelings for him too, even though she refused to admit it at first. Throughout the course of Jake and Miley's relationship, the series explores one of its central themes - the ups and downs of celebrity life. Jake serves as Miley's foil and represents the over-exposed lifestyle she is trying to avoid. While Jake often enjoys the benefits of being famous, he also admits to Miley \\"sometimes I wish I could just turn it off\\". Jake and Miley first start dating in \\"People Who Use People\\", but their relationship lasts only a matter of minutes as Jake kisses Miley and then tells her he is going away to Romania for four months. (While he is there, it is extended to six months.) He returns in \\"Achy Jakey Heart\\" where Miley learns to forgive Jake. They restart their relationship. Jake reveals his real name 'Leslie' to Miley as his biggest secret, and says that he is glad that they don't have to keep any more secrets from each other. This has guilt over Miley until she finally reveals to him that she is Hannah Montana. Their relationship, however, comes to an end again after Miley learns that Jake is too self-centered and they later agree to be just friends. However, in \\"That's What Friends Are For?\\", Miley realizes that she is not over Jake, as she feels jealous about him spending time with Mikayla. Jake again returns in \\"Jake... Another Little Piece of My Heart\\" where it is revealed that both Jake and Miley still love each other, but won't admit it. The relationship is on again for the third time in \\"He Could Be the One\\". Robby seems to have second thoughts about Jake because he has broken Miley's heart multiple times, but nevertheless he is supportive of the relationship. In the season 4 episode \\"It's the End of Jake As We Know It\\" Oliver gets a picture text to his phone of Jake cheating on Miley, so Miley confronts Jake during the taping of a Christmas special with guest star Sheryl Crow. This ends their relationship for good. Roxy Roker Roxy Roker portrayed by Frances Callier (season 1‚Äì2) is Miley's personal bodyguard who works for her when she's Hannah, and sometimes when she's Miley. Roxy takes her job very seriously, and is known for her ridiculous attempts to keep Miley safe from danger. She is like family to the Stewarts, and sometimes watches the kids as a nanny, or helping cure Robby of sickness. Roxy used to be a Marine where she learned most of her techniques. She was also a bodyguard for the famous cellist Yo-Yo Ma. She later worked as a security guard, and while on duty at a place called \\"Wig City\\", she met Miley and Robby for the first time. Miley was trying to create the Hannah disguise, and Roxy helped her pick an appropriate wig. She then took a job as her bodyguard. She briefly worked for the Secret Service presidential protection unit after saving the president from contaminated sushi. After this she returned to work for Hannah. Roxy also has 60 hours of firefighter training. Roxy's catchphrases are \\"Roxy like a Puma!\\" and \\"I got my eyes on you!\\" Among her special abilities are dicing a pineapple with a karate chop, crushing a baseball into fine powder, and squeezing through air ducts. In \\"Schooly Bully\\", Roxy attends Miley's school under the pretense of keeping her safe from a bully, while all along trying to teach Miley that she can deal with the bully herself. Roxy owns a pair of bulletproof pantyhose, which she says \\"keeps bullets out; keeps Roxy in\\". Roxy is single and lives in an apartment with her dog named Diddy. She earlier had a goldfish named Denzel. The only time Roxy is seen to be intimidated was upon meeting an old high school friend, Clarice Johnson. Roxy was insecure about her life, but later learned that she didn't need to be. Roxy appears in \\"It's a Mannequin's World\\", \\"On the Road Again\\", \\"Schooly Bully\\", \\"Bad Moose Rising\\", \\"Take This Job and Love It\\", \\"When You Wish You Were the Star\\", \\"I Want You to Want Me... to Go to Florida\\", and \\"We're All On This Date Together\\". Amber and Ashley Amber Addison portrayed by Shanica Knowles and Ashley Dewitt portrayed by Anna Maria Perez de Tagle (season 1‚Äì4) are extremely mean and snobby girls who are Miley and Lilly's classmates and bitter rivals. They are typical school divas aka the mean girls, very popular among their peers and spoiled by their parents' money. Amber and Ashley are ironically both big Hannah Montana fans, despite their disdain for Miley. The girls first appear in the pilot episode and have since appeared in a total of 21 episodes. They make their last appearance on the series finale; when Lily and Miley get into Stanford University, they become assigned roommates to Amber and Ashley. They now want to be friends albeit for selfish reasons, as Miley's secret has been revealed. Amber seems to be the more competent of the duo with Ashley typically following her lead. Amber is the editor of the school yearbook, a great singer, and is the first in the class to hold a valid drivers license. Amber also does well in school, and it is revealed that Ashley often cheats off her test papers. They both try out for the cheer leading squad but get turned down. Ashley claims it's because she's \\"too pretty\\". They are antagonistic towards Miley and Lilly, banishing them to the \\"losers' table\\" at lunch and placing them at the bottom of the \\"cool list\\", their annual listing of their classmates by their perceived coolness. In \\"The Idol Side of Me\\", Miley conspires with Lilly to embarrass Amber on live television with Lilly's \\"Green Gas\\" science project, thinking she deserves it. Miley (as Hannah) has her first honest conversation with Amber backstage and learns that when she was younger, Amber was bullied and made fun of. Miley begins to feel sorry for her, and makes her promise to become a kinder person. In spite of this, Amber only fulfills her promise to a small extent and her bitterness towards Miley and superficial ways remain. In \\"Achey Jakey Heart\\", Amber and Ashley try to become Miley and Lilly's friends after Miley starts dating Jake Ryan. This gives Miley a small taste of why she maintains her Hannah secret, as Amber and Ashley only want to be her friend for selfish reasons. Whenever Amber and Ashley happen to say something at the same time, they say together \\"Oooo, tsss!\\" and touch index fingers. This celebratory gesture becomes their trademark and a source of great annoyance to Miley and Lilly. At the end of the pilot episode, Miley and Lilly do the gesture in mockery of Amber and Ashley. Miley later initiates it with Lilly, but she declines, and they decide on a new best friends handshake. In \\"It's a Mannequin's World\\", Roxy initiates the gesture with Robby, but he declines. Amber and Ashley appear in \\"Lilly, Do You Want to Know a Secret?\\", \\"It's a Mannequin's World\\", \\"Mascot Love\\", \\"Ooh Ooh Itchy Woman\\", \\"New Kid in School\\", \\"Good Golly, Miss Dolly\\", \\"Money for Nothing, Guilt for Free\\", \\"The Idol Side of Me\\", \\"You Are So Sue-able to Me\\", \\"Achey Jakey Heart Part One\\", \\"When You Wish You Were the Star\\", \\"Song Sung Bad\\", \\"No Sugar, Sugar\\" (unaired), \\"Uptight (Oliver's Alright)\\", \\"Ready, Set, Don't Drive\\" and \\"Wherever I Go\\". Traci van Horn Traci van Horn portrayed by Romi Dames (season 1‚Äì3) is a socialite and friend of Hannah Montana. Her record producer is her father and Miley counts his self-centered daughter, Traci as a close friend of Hannah's. Traci has had a frequent dislike for Hannah's friend, Lola, claiming that she is \\"so uncool\\". She has however, reluctantly accepted Lola at social events and maintains a friendly relationship with Hannah because of this. Traci talks with a nasal voice that is often noticed by others, which she claims is a \\"deviated septum\\" or else a \\"nasal condition\\". She and Jake Ryan prank Hannah on a reality TV show called Gotcha!, in which they make Hannah believe that the two are getting married. Hannah once went to Traci for boyfriend help when she asked to use her \\"faux-beau\\" to fool Lilly and Oliver (who believe that Miley is alone now that the two are dating). She seems to have a crush on Jackson, and is frequently having celebrity parties, in which Hannah and her friends go to (although Lilly only goes for the publicity). Traci appears in \\"It's My Party and I'll Lie If I Want To\\", \\"Torn Between Two Hannahs\\", \\"My Boyfriend's Jackson and There's Gonna Be Trouble\\", \\"Cuffs Will Keep Us Together\\", \\"When You Wish You Were the Star\\", \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get the Phone\\", \\"The Test of My Love\\", \\"Uptight (Oliver's Alright)\\", \\"Once, Twice, Three Times Afraidy\\", \\"Jake... Another Little Piece of My Heart\\", and \\"For (Give) a Little Bit\\". Cooper Cooper Montgomery portrayed by Andr√© Jamal Kinney (season 1), also called \\"Coop\\", is Jackson's best friend in season one. Cooper has not made an appearance outside of season one, although he is mentioned and it's assumed they still hang out. Cooper often plays the straight man to Jackson's antics. He works at a movie theater called \\"Nick's Fat City\\". He enjoys Shirley Temple cocktails, calling them \\"fruity and refreshing\\". He also has a secret love of baking, something he keeps secret because he believes it is a primarily female activity. Cooper has a little sister named \\"Olivia\\" (Rae'Ven Larrymore Kelly) who is a student on the East Coast. In \\"I Can't Make You Love Hannah if You Don't\\", Olivia visits Malibu on break where she meets Jackson. She agrees to go out with Jackson. Cooper gets mad at Jackson for flirting with his sister then he learns Olivia is Cooper's sister and she acts innocent. The incident causes a temporary rift in Jackson and Cooper's friendship. They are good friends again after Cooper realizes that everything was Olivia's fault. Cooper appears in \\"Miley Get Your Gum\\", \\"She's a Supersneak\\", \\"I Can't Make You Love Hannah If You Don't\\", \\"It's a Mannequin's World\\", \\"Oops I Meddled Again\\", and \\"Money for Nothing, Guilt for Free\\". Cooper is mentioned but unseen in the episodes \\"My Boyfriend's Jackson and There's Gonna Be Trouble\\" and \\"Bad Moose Rising\\" where he and Jackson have plans to go to a Los Angeles Dodgers game. In \\"You Give Lunch a Bad Name\\" Jackson says he had to miss Coop's party because Mamaw came to visit. Dontzig Albert Dontzig portrayed by Peter Allen Vogt (season 1 and 3) is the Stewarts' wealthy, snobby, pretentious, obese, and obnoxious next-door neighbor who has an ongoing rivalry with both Robby and Jackson. He can't stand the Stewarts, saying \\"I hate neighbors! That's why I have the big hedge!\\" He complains of leaves from their tree falling into his outdoor hot tub and makes fun of Jackson's new used car. His wife once had a car similar to Jackson's but traded it in because she thought it was too \\"girly\\". Mr. Dontzig tricks the Stewarts into a competition to see who can make their house look the scariest for Halloween, while all he wanted to do was attract more children to his house. This plan of course, backfires on him. He takes advantage of the Stewarts' generosity by faking a sickness to have them watch his bratty eight-year-old niece \\"Patty\\" (Savannah Stehlin). Patty becomes the center of a bet between Jackson and Miley in \\"Bad Moose Rising\\". Dontzig is an alumnus of the (fictional) State University of Santa Barbara and is a generous donor to the school. To write a letter of recommendation to the school in support of Jackson's matriculating, Dontzig has Jackson perform menial favors for him. Dontzig is the only character in Hannah Montana to be portrayed by two separate actors. Paul Vogt debuted the role in \\"Miley Get Your Gum\\", and his identical twin brother, Peter Allen Vogt, has performed the role ever since in the episodes \\"Torn Between Two Hannahs\\", \\"The Idol Side of Me\\", \\"Bad Moose Rising\\", and \\"Killing Me Softly with His Height\\". Paul returned in the episode \\"Killing Me Softly with His Height\\" in the role of Dontzig's sister, \\"Donna\\", who is a huge Robbie Ray fan. Dontzig also has a cousin named \\"Francesca\\" (Lisa Rinna) who is also a Robbie Ray fan. Susan Stewart Susan B. Stewart portrayed by Brooke Shields (season 2‚Äì3) was Robby's wife and Miley and Jackson's mother. Susan is the daughter of Grandma Ruby. She died three years prior to season one, but is often mentioned by the Stewarts and appears in household pictures. She also appears in person in three episodes by way of old home videos and various dream sequences. These are \\"I Am Hannah, Hear Me Croak\\", \\"The Way We Almost Weren't\\", and \\"He Could Be the One\\". Although they were both from Tennessee, Robby and Susan first met on the West Coast in a small roadside cafe off Interstate 10. Susan was working as a waitress at the cafe during her college days and Robby visited while driving home to Nashville. Robby claimed he fell in love with Susan immediately, and that he knew that Susan loved him too because she laughed at all his jokes. However, when Robby first asked Susan out she turned him down because she was already dating someone else. But with a little encouragement from Aunt Dolly, Robby persisted and Susan finally went out with him. Robby tells Oliver that he first got Susan to go out with him by using the line \\"My Robby name is hi'.\\" Susan was a supportive parent, but she was more strict than Robby and wouldn't let the children have sugar before bed because it gave them nightmares, as seen in \\"I Am Hannah, Hear Me Croak\\". She was a skilled shopper and Miley remembers that she had great taste in fashion. Robby remembers that when he and Susan went shopping, all he did was carry the bags. Susan died at age 34, when Miley was 10, of a car accident. The family's dealing with her death is first explored in the episode \\"She's a Supersneak\\" in which Miley overreacts to Robby dating another woman. Miley dreams about meeting her in \\"I Am Hannah, Hear Me Croak\\" because she is afraid she will lose her singing voice. Susan comforts Miley and teaches her that even if she can't be Hannah Montana anymore, just being Miley is still \\"pretty darn terrific\\". In \\"He Could Be the One\\", Robby shares a pre-recorded video of Susan, who had anticipated a future personal struggle Miley would have. In the video Susan tells Miley to always listen to her heart.This is the only hint at the cause of Susan's death, as it seems the family had anticipated her death. In \\"Super (stitious) Girl\\", it is learned that Susan gave Miley a special ankle charm bracelet which says \\"Dream\\". Miley wears this bracelet in all of her Hannah concerts until it is thrown overboard the SS Tipton by London Tipton, who was disgusted when Miley told her diamonds were fake. Robby admits that he misses Susan, and when she died he didn't think he could raise the kids by himself, but he found the strength by feeling her presence with him. In \\"What I Don't Like About You\\", Jackson plans to lie to a college recruiter in order to be accepted into college. Robby is disappointed, but rather than stopping him, he points to a picture of Susan and says that she would not be proud of him. The so-called \\"Mom card\\" works in making Jackson finally tell the truth. In the pilot episode, Robby tells Miley that Susan would have been proud of her performance at the Los Angeles concert. Siena Siena portrayed by Tammin Sursok (season 4) is Jackson's long-term girlfriend. She works a job as a bikini model. She lives next door to the Stewarts and has a cousin named TJ. Every time Jackson talks about her, he always stutters saying the word \\"bikini.\\" In \\"Sweet Home Hannah Montana\\", Siena and Jackson start out as being friends, but throughout the season, Siena shows to have true feelings for Jackson and cares for him for who he is. In \\"Hannah Montana to the Principal's Office,\\" she shows to have an immediate interest in Jackson and asks him out, even admitting to him that boys have always asked her out before, but that was the first time she herself had to ask. In \\"California Screamin',\\" Jackson admits to Siena that even though he wants to be more than just friends with her, he still feels insecure because he is not like the other guys she dates. Siena admits to Jackson that he is right, because he is \\"way better,\\" and they share their first kiss. In \\"De-De-De-Do, Da-Don't-Don't-Don't Tell My Secret,\\" while visiting Jackson, she mistakenly thinks Jackson is cheating on her with Hannah Montana after seeing Miley outside in her Hannah disguise through the kitchen window. In the end, to save their relationship, Miley shows Siena her closet. This results in Siena finding out that Miley is really Hannah. She later visits Jackson at his new job as a video game tester and comments on his and Miley's relationship. In the fourth season she appeared in 8 out of 13 episodes. Jesse Jesse portrayed by Drew Roy (season 3‚Äì4) is Hannah/Miley's romance interest. In \\"He Could Be The One,\\" Miley repeatedly tries but fails to tell her dad that she's dating Jake Ryan again. Soon, Robby winds up believing that she's hiding something from him. To make her father thankful for Jake, she pretends to like her bad boy bandmate Jesse, but gets in over her head when she starts to have feelings for him so it's up to Robby to help Miley listen to her heart and chose the guy who could \\"be the one.\\" In the end, Hannah tells Jesse that there is just something between her and Jake that is special and picks Jake after some help from a video of her mother and apparent intervention by her to help. In \\"Been Here All Along\\", Jesse starts seeing Miley and Miley cancels a special father-daughter afternoon with her dad to go on a first date with Jesse instead. After Jesse receives a phone call from his deployed father, their heartfelt conversation leads Miley to realize how fortunate she is to have her father close to home whenever she needs him. Then, in \\"I'll Always Remember You\\", it is revealed that Jesse knew that Miley was Hannah when he told Miley that his dad was in Afghanistan. Jesse ends up figuring out that Miley is Hannah before she could even tell him, claiming that \\"You both have the same beautiful eyes and amazing smile.\\" Things go from bad to worse when Jesse kisses Hannah on stage and is soon criticized for two-timing Hannah when he is spotted with Miley, this is the moment that the Hannah-secret started interfering with Miley's personal life to the point which it became too difficult to manage, and it served as the instigator to Miley revealing the secret to the world. Jesse later goes to see Miley off at the airport and they (presumably) kiss. Family members Stewart family Aunt Dolly (left) and Mamaw (right) smother Miley in a hug after putting their 30-year feud behind them. *'Mamaw' Ruthie Ray Stewart (Vicki Lawrence) is Miley and Jackson's paternal grandmother and Robby's mother (\\"Mamaw\\" is a nickname given to a grandmother). She lives in Tennessee but occasionally visits California. Ruthie is a demanding and opinionated woman, often seen nagging Robby about his habits and parenting skills. Ruthie also makes fun of him for being fat. While in high school Ruthie dated fellow Tennessean Elvis Presley and claimed to have been the one to first give him the nickname \\"The King\\" after playing checkers with him. Elvis eventually started dating Aunt Dolly which began a 30-year feud between the two women. A former Olympian who played volleyball at the 1964 Olympics, Ruthie maintained her competitive streak throughout life: From 1982 to 1999, she won \\"Lunch Lady of the Year\\" from the North Central Nashville School District every single year and in \\"Grandmas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Play Favorites\\" she was seen competing with Queen Elizabeth II in an arcade dance-game. Both Miley and Jackson love \\"Mamaw,\\" but they often find her overbearing. Ruthie alienates Miley in \\"Grandmas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Play Favorites\\" by clearly showing favoritism toward Jackson. Ruthie feels that because of all Miley's success, Jackson is often overlooked in the family, not realizing she's overlooking Miley's feelings as well. Ruthie reconciles with Miley and teaches her to better appreciate her brother. In the episode \\"B-B-B-Bad to the Chrome\\", Ruthie is seen to have a battered old car called Loretta (a 1980s Cadillac Eldorado convertible). Loretta has 40 years of smells including her husband's hair tonic and tomato sauce in between the seats. Ruthie has appeared once in seasons 1, 2, and 4, and twice in the third. The episodes include: \\"Grandmas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Play Favorites,\\" \\"I Will Always Loathe You,\\" \\"You Give Lunch a Bad Name,\\" \\"B-B-B-Bad to the Chrome\\", and \\"I Am Mamaw, Hear Me Roar!\\". *\\"Bubba\\" Joe Stewart was Ruthie's husband and Robby's father. Very little is said about him except that he had large ears and that he and Ruthie started dating after a school dance. He is presumably deceased as the family refers to him in the past tense. *Grandma Ruby (Margo Martindale) is Jackson and Miley's maternal grandmother, Robby's mother-in- law, and Susan's mother. She lives in Crowley Corners, Tennessee. She is rarely mentioned in the series, although Robby says that she goes to singles bingo. In Hannah Montana: The Movie, Ruby's birthday is Robby's excuse for taking the family back to Tennessee for two weeks. Ruby helps teach Miley the value of family and staying true to oneself. *Aunt Dolly (Dolly Parton) is a long-time friend of the Stewart family, long enough to remember when Robby was in diapers. Although not a blood relation, the Stewarts consider her a family member as she is Miley Stewart's godmother. Miley is seen to rely on her advice and encouragement. Dolly is also partly responsible for Miley's parents getting married. She lives in Nashville, Tennessee with her husband and dog Rufus. She has appeared in two episodes: \\"Good Golly, Miss Dolly\\" and \\"I Will Always Loathe You\\" in which she visits California. The character is primarily based on Parton herself who is the real-life godmother of Miley Cyrus. It is unclear if, like Dolly Parton, Aunt Dolly has a career in music; although she does mention that she used to perform on stage, and she was a go-to person for Miley when she was considering becoming a professional singer and, in \\"I Will Always Loathe You\\", Ruthie tells Dolly she \\"put the 'old' in Grand Ole Opry\\". She returned for the episode, \\"Kiss It All Goodbye\\". Her 30-year feud with Mamaw Ruthie Ray Stewart is due to both having dated Elvis Presley. *Uncle Earl (David Koechner) is one of Robby's brothers from Tennessee. Earl seems to have provided the family with endless stories and jokes, often at his own expense. Most of the stories about Uncle Earl concern his being overweight, lazy, smelly, or his fun-loving, childlike personality. For example, Uncle Earl once drilled for oil and accidentally hit a sewage pipe; Uncle Earl once tried to box a kangaroo and got knocked out cold; Uncle Earl once found a week-old sardine in his fat fold when he was looking for the remote; Uncle Earl once fell off a horse and it took four people to help him up; and Uncle Earl once chased a rolling quarter through a car wash and it was the cleanest he ever was in his life. It is learned that Earl enjoys watching football and playing poker, and he is a huge fan of Shakira. Robby says that Earl is one of the all-time great pranksters. He once went to college, but only stayed for four days. Earl is an unseen character for much of the series, but finally makes an appearance in the second-season episode \\"(We're So Sorry) Uncle Earl.\\" It is revealed that Earl's lifelong ambition is to be a rock star, and he hopes that Miley will be able to help him achieve that goal. Miley learns in a dream sequence that the table with the brightly-colored mannequin legs, often seen in the Stewarts' kitchen, was bought by Robby at one of Uncle Earl's garage sales. *Aunt Pearl is Earl's wife. In a similar manner to Earl, she has provided the family with endless stories and jokes. Unlike Earl, who did eventually appear, Aunt Pearl has remained completely unseen on screen, making her the longest-running unseen character in the show whose voice has not been heard. *Luann Stewart (Miley Cyrus) is Miley's identical twin cousin who visits from Tennessee in the episode \\"Torn Between Two Hannahs.\\" She looks very similar to Miley, except that she wears overalls, braids her hair, and speaks in a more exaggerated southern accent. Miley is convinced that Luann is evil, although Robby doesn't believe it. Miley claims that Luann pushed her down a well when she was six years old; Robby thinks that Luann is nice because she pulled Miley back out. Luann causes Miley trouble by dressing up as Hannah Montana and threatening to reveal her secret. Oliver and Luann are attracted to each other, but they never date. Throughout the episode, Miley makes several witch-related comments about Luann in keeping with the episode's Halloween theme. Because Miley Cyrus portrayed Luann, this made her a type of evil twin. *Bobby Ray Stewart (Billy Ray Cyrus) is Robby's identical twin brother and Luann's father. Like his daughter, Bobby has an exaggerated southern accent. Truscott family *Kenneth \\"Ken\\" Truscott (Jon Cryer) is an accountant. He first appears in season 3 in the episode \\"The Wheel Near My Bed (Keeps On Turnin')\\" and reappears in season 4 in the episode \\"I Am Mamaw, Hear Me Roar!\\". In \\"It's a Mannequin's World,\\" Lilly complains that he got her a savings bond for her birthday, seen by Lilly as worthless because she can't spend it. Although he is separated from Lilly's mother, he is known to spend time with Lilly and keep her accountable for her school work. Lilly says that he likes bran muffins and is susceptible to back injuries. He lives an hour away from Lilly. He has his own business but he fakes that he's successful and has an assistant called Margaret. He is lactose intolerant, but still eats ice cream, revealed in \\"It's the End of Jake As We Know It.\\" *Heather Truscott (Heather Locklear) is Lilly's mother. She first appears at a PTA meeting at the Stewarts' home in \\"Lilly's Mom Has Got It Goin' On.\\" She goes on a date with Robby, but things turn cold when she refuses to let Robby pay for her meal. Miley describes Heather as \\"uptight,\\" and Lilly eventually agrees with her. She reconciles with Robby, but they are no longer seen dating. Heather gets a job in Atlanta forcing Lilly to move. She attends a Hannah concert dressed as Lola Luftnagle's mother. She is divorced from Lilly's father. Earlier Heather bought Lilly a pair of horn-rimmed glasses which Lilly is embarrassed to wear. *Lilly's brother is first mentioned in the episode \\"Miley Get Your Gum\\" but Lilly later wishes that she has a brother in \\"Would I Lie to You, Lilly?\\". He had a pet hamster (who is later seen under the ownership of Lilly). Other than him, no other siblings are mentioned. Most likely Lilly's brother disappeared like the Chuck Cunningham Syndrome and Lilly is an only child. *Lilly's grandfather got run over by a school bus. In the episode \\"Good Golly, Miss Dolly\\", Lilly says that Principal Fisher reminds her of him. *Lilly's other grandparents smell like oatmeal and Lilly says that her dad uses the puppy dog look to make her shampoo Grandma. Oken family *Nancy Oken is Oliver's mother. Although unseen, Nancy is often portrayed as having exaggerated masculine characteristics. She is sometimes heard off screen using her \\"man voice\\" when she's angry. When Oliver's pet fish died, she flushed it down the toilet. She works as a police officer, then got promoted to detective and earlier had a job as a security officer.Oliver says his mom is a cop in \\"Me and Rico Down By the School Yard.\\" In \\"Hannah In the Streets With Diamonds,\\" Oliver wears Nancy's old uniform which is marked \\"Security Officer.\\" She makes homemade fried chicken. *Mr. Oken is very over-protective and still holds Oliver's hand in parking lots. *Oliver's brother loves to go to Mozzarella Mousie's and Make A Moose. *Aunt Harriet is Oliver's aunt. She is the reason for Oliver's fear of chewing gum; when he was a baby, Aunt Harriet was playing with Oliver when the piece of gum that she was chewing fell on him. She is seen in the episode \\"Miley Get Your Gum\\". Suave family *Rico Suave Sr. is Rico's father and owner of Rico's post. *Mrs. Suave is Rico's mother, who was heard in the episode \\"Ready, Set, Don't Drive\\". *Mateo Suave (Mateo Arias) is Rico's younger brother. *Rico's sister is Rico's older sister. She flirted with Jackson, but he is distracted by the fact that she is Rico's sister. *Teresa is Rico's cousin. She goes out on a date with Jackson, but he is distracted again by the fact that she is Rico's cousin. *Alejandro Nu√±ez Gonzales Uberto Sifuentes, a.k.a. \\"Angus\\" (Moises Arias) Rico's Australian/Mexican cousin. Rico thinks that he is more good- looking than him even though the two could be twins. Supporting characters School staff *Francis Corelli (Greg Baker) is a teacher of Miley, Lilly and Oliver. He is sometimes weird. He often teaches in an exaggerated fashion, by trying to be the \\"cool teacher\\", but he is the cool and fun teacher. He is usually star struck when he meets a celebrity like Jake or Hannah Montana. Even though he is unaware that Miley is Hannah Montana. It is later revealed that he lives in his mom's basement. He was Hannah's private tutor in the episode \\"When You Wish You Were the Star\\". *Karen Kunkle (Erin Matthews) is a teacher of Miley, Lilly, Oliver, Jackson and Rico. She is very strict to Miley and Jackson. In an attempt to get good grades, Jackson sets his father up on a date with Karen Kunkle, but fails when his father has an argument with her over his cooking ingredients. She revealed to Miley that she's from Detroit, and that she doesn't find her country sayings charming. *Lori (Christine Taylor) is a nurse at Seaview High School whom Robby Ray is dating. Miley first overhears her phone-conversation with her mother (continuously trying to set her up with dates in order to get discounts), and sets her up with Robby Ray. She only appears in three episodes. Students *Sarah (Morgan York), sometimes called \\"Saint\\" Sarah by Lilly, is Miley's classmate who represents a typical nerd girl. She is an environmentalist, a supporter of animal rights, and especially concerned about the poor and needy. Her interest in causes is something she evidently inherited from her parents who met at a blood drive and honeymooned while volunteering for the Peace Corps. Sarah gets up every day at 4 a.m., except for Saturdays, when she sleeps in to 5:30 a.m. She owns only two pairs of socks, thinking that having anymore would be extravagant. She once worked for Rico at the surf shop, and had her father Woody (Ed Begley Jr.) provide electric power by riding an exercise bike. Sarah is very polite and kind, but can also be quite assertive when she needs to. She briefly dated Oliver after they worked on a school project together, but she broke up with him because they had nothing to talk about. She also dated Jackson very briefly after a misunderstanding. Sarah's trademark is saying something very unpleasant, and then saying a cheery \\"Bye!\\" and walking away. Sarah also hyperventilates whenever she is in Hannah Montana's presence, apparently unable to pronounce her name. This has now occurred on two occasions, \\"Money for Nothing, Guilt for Free\\" in Season 1 and \\"Hannah Montana to the Principal's Office\\" in Season 4. So far, Sarah has appeared in \\"Money for Nothing, Guilt for Free\\", \\"My Boyfriend's Jackson and There's Gonna Be Trouble\\", \\"The Idol Side of Me\\", \\"Cuffs Will Keep Us Together\\", \\"You Are So Sue-able to Me\\", \\"Song Sung Bad\\", \\"Lilly's Mom Has Got It Goin' On\\", \\"Would I Lie to You, Lilly?\\", \\"Sweet Home Hannah Montana\\", \\"Hannah Montana to the Principal's Office\\" and \\"Love That Let's Go\\". It is revealed that her and Joannie's parents are dating. *Joannie Palumbo (Hayley Chase) is Lilly's rival since the second grade. When they were young, Joannie used to bully Lilly, cutting her kite loose and popping her balloon. Lilly has been trying to beat Joannie at something since the second grade. She is a vegetarian. In \\"Joannie B. Goode\\", Joannie starts to date Oliver much to the dismay of Lilly and Miley. However, after a sleepover, Lilly and Joannie learn that they have a lot in common and they become friends, driving Miley to become more competitive. Joannie and Oliver continue to date for 11 more episodes until their break up in \\"Papa's Got a Brand New Friend\\". In \\"Sweet Home Hannah Montana\\", it is shown that Joannie also became friends with Miley. So far, Joannie appeared in \\"Cuffs Will Keep Us Together\\", \\"Joannie B. Goode\\", \\"Don't Go Breaking My Tooth\\", \\"Papa's Got a Brand New Friend\\", \\"Sweet Home Hannah Montana\\" and \\"Hannah Montana to the Principal's Office\\". It is revealed in Joannie B. Goode that she is not a fan of Hannah Montana and actually dislikes her music (to Miley's dismay), though she quickly changes her mind in Hannah Montana to the Principle's Office when Hannah accidentally called her by her first name before being formally introduced, with Joannie claiming Her starpower cut right through my macho facade. It is said that Joannie's parents and Sarah's parents are dating, so it is possible that they may have become stepsisters after the show had ended. *Thor (Andrew Caldwell) is from fictional Mooville, Minnesota. He first appeared in \\"Me and Rico Down by the School Yard\\", as the new kid at Seaview High. Thor became acquainted with Jackson on the first day of school, to which Thor quickly labeled him as his new best friend, much to Jackson's annoyance. Later, Jackson remembered what it was like for him to be the new kid that everyone thought was a loser, and stuck up for Thor when he was being ridiculed by the other students. Thor usually comes off as being very friendly and has been known to be totally oblivious to when people make fun of him, or when he is found annoying to others. Thor was also seen in \\"You Are So Sue-able to Me\\" and \\"Get Down and Study-udy-udy\\". Thor is mentioned in \\"You Gotta Not Fight for Your Right to Party\\" in which he lends Jackson his pickup truck. *Max (Teo Olivares) tells Thor that Jackson is the welcoming committee and that California girls like guys who churn their own butter. Jackson invites Max to his party. Max says girls are saying hi to him just because he knows him. Max's girlfriend is a stereotypical nerd and is in the chess club at school. Max appears in \\"Me and Rico Down by the School Yard\\" and \\"Sleepwalk This Way\\". In \\"Welcome to the Bungle\\", Jackson says that Max's parents have extra Laker tickets. He and Jackson play basketball. Miley gives Max $20 to tell Lilly she has the ugliest ears in Seaview High history and a squeaky voice in \\"What I Don't Like About You\\". He's normally seen hanging out at the beach. *Johnny Collins (Corbin Bleu) is Miley's schoolmate who appears in the pilot episode. Miley has a huge crush on him but is afraid to speak to him. Johnny is a fan of Hannah Montana, and gets her autograph after her Los Angeles concert. He asks her to sign it to Johnny, claiming that Johnny is his little brother. Johnny is not seen again until close to the end of the second season in \\"We're All On This Date Together\\". His two-year absence was the result of going to school in Arizona which is reference to Bleu's role as Chad Danforth in High School Musical, which is actually set in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Rico calls Johnny \\"Poodle Dude\\", referencing his curly afro. He apparently comes from a rich family as he buys a dinner date with Hannah Montana for $19,000 at a charity auction. *Chad (Kyle Kaplan) is a schoolmate of Miley, Lilly and Oliver. In \\"Miley Get Your Gum\\", Oliver has a feud with Chad which starts with Chad sticking his used gum onto Oliver's \\"Hannah hand\\". Later, when Chad's locker is stuck, Oliver refuses to help him open it. Chad later sticks another piece of used gum on a picture of Hannah in Oliver's locker. Chad makes a speaking cameo in \\"Mascot Love\\" where he complains that Pirate Pete is blocking his view of the cheerleaders. *Gabe Lamotti (Chris Zylka), called \\"Hottie Lamotti with the Swimmer's Body\\", is a student at Seaview High, who all the girls constantly fawn over. Sarah goes with him to the dance. He asks Miley out but Jackson blocks him. *Todd (Patrick Ryan Anderson) is one of Lilly's guy friends from high school. He doesn't recognize Lilly after she changes her look. He asks Lilly to the dance, but she already had plans to go with Matt. He and Lilly also spend time surfing. Todd is the first person to taste the \\"Cheese Jerky\\" and realize how delicious it is, foreshadowing it's possible commercial success. He appears in \\"You Didn't Say It Was Your Birthday\\" where he enthusiastically bids on the likeness of Darth Vader which Lilly and Oliver discovered in a bag of chips. (This was a parody of the Virgin Mary grilled cheese sandwich.) *\\"Dandruff\\" Danny (Jack Taylor) is a classmate of Miley's who has excessive dandruff. He is bullied by the Cracker. Danny appears in \\"Good Golly, Miss Dolly\\", \\"School Bully\\", \\"New Kid At School\\" and \\"The Idol Side of Me\\". Other characters *Blue Jeans is Miley's horse. His first appearance was in Hannah Montana: The Movie. In \\"Miley Says Goodbye?\\", Miley brings him to Malibu. It is possible that the Hannah-song \\"Old Blue Jeans\\" is a reference to him, as Miley recalled in \\"Love That Let's Go\\" how she named him because he was tugging on her old blue jeans. *Mikayla (Selena Gomez) is a pop star who is very similar to Hannah, but is so far much less successful due to Hannah being in the industry for longer. Hannah first meets Mikayla on Colin Lassiter's television show where, on air, the two girls share kind and supportive words. After cutting to commercials, Mikayla bluntly informs Hannah that she despises her, starting a rivalry between the girls. Hannah and Mikayla appear together with Lassiter a second time for a telethon fundraiser where they trade insults. However, to the public, the girls pretend to be friends. Mikaylas first top 10 hit is \\"If Cupid Had a Heart\\". Like Hannah Montana, Mikayla's career also includes acting. Her film debut is Roger Bucks: Intergalactic Bounty Hunter in which she stars as \\"Alien Babe\\" alongside Jake Ryan. Though her character may appear arrogant and shallow based on her behavior towards Hannah, Mikayla actually has been shown to have a much softer side towards others. Mikayla appears in \\"I Want You to Want Me... to Go to Florida,\\" \\"That's What Friends Are For?,\\" and \\"(We're So Sorry) Uncle Earl.\\" Mikayla's music is panned by critic Barney Bittman (Gilbert Gottfried) who calls her a \\"teen poop sensation,\\" and says \\"If Mikayla had a heart, she'd stop singing!\\" Though Mikayla hates Hannah, she really likes Miley (not knowing they are the same person) and considers Miley her friend though she doesn't like Lilly. *Little girl (Noah Cyrus) is a recurring character who make brief appearances in seasons 1, 2 and 4. She portrays a mean and weird little girl in seven episodes so far. It is assumed that she knows Hannah's secret because she is in the ball pit when Hannah and Lola switch wigs in \\"Money for Nothing, Guilt for Free\\". It is revealed that her soccer mom has a tazor, and that she was able to climb a rope when she was four, mocking Miley because she is afraid. *Liposuction Liza (Lisa Arch) is Hannah's former assistant. She is mostly known for her photography and advertisement career, getting Hannah to promote zit cream and perfume in a couple of episodes in season 1. She returns in season 3 to take pictures of Jackson and Oliver for her online dating ad, in which the two portray average, unattractive guys that women would not want to date. She seems to have a one-sided crush on Robby. *Colin Lasitter (Michael Kagan) is a talkshow host. He is often blunt, asks very un-maneuverable questions, overly dramatic, but also is friendly throughout his six episode appearances in seasons 1‚Äì4. Considering that he was the first to interview Hannah, and that he created a bond with her long before her secret came out, he was initially upset at Miley for doing her big reveal on rival talk show host Jay Leno's show, and then an in-depth interview with news anchor Robin Roberts, leaving him last in line with her interview (groaning while calling himself Colin Last In Line Lasitter). Miley's ditching of the famous blonde wig caused many angry parents to call in and complain about her actions in \\"killing-off Hannah\\", much in the same way fans of the series responded negatively towards Miley Cyrus' more provocative image at the time. *Wendy (Sandy Brown) is the over-enthusiastic host of the \\"Wake-up it's Wendy Show\\". She first interviewed Hannah in the wake of \\"Jacksannah\\" in \\"My Boyfriend's Jackson and There's Gonna be Trouble\\", where Hannah \\"broke up\\" with Jackson. She appeared again in \\"That's What Friends Are For\\" when interviewing Jake Ryan and Mikayla on their up-and-coming movie. She told Jake it takes her a while to shake-off her over-enthusiastic persona after finishing an interview. *Mack and Mickey (Terry Rhoads and Leigh-Allyn Baker respectively) are 2 quirky talk show hosts that first appeared in Miley's dream in \\"He Ain't A Hottie, He's My Brother\\". Mack is portrayed as the egocentric and slightly dimwitted male counterpart to Mickey. In \\"Welcome To The Bungle\\" it is revealed that Mickey is pregnant, this is due to Baker's real-life pregnancy at the time, which resulted in her being cast as Amy Duncan in the fellow Disney Channel Sitcom Good Luck Charlie. *Byron and Andy (Charles Shaughnessy and John Henton) are 2 of Hannah's co-judges on the talent show \\"America's Top Talent\\" (a parody of America's Got Talent and American Idol). Byron is a parody of Simon Cowell and Andy is a parody of Randy Jackson. Real-life American Idol judge Kara DioGuardi portrayed herself alongside Byron and Andy in \\"Judge Me Tender\\".  Minor characters  *Rachel (Summer Bishil) is Miley and Jake's classmate from Spanish class. She and Jake Ryan start dating in \\"Good Golly, Miss Dolly,\\" a fact that Miley learns just after working up the courage to tell Jake her feelings for him. In \\"People Who Use People\\", it is said that Jake broke up with Rachel. *Lucas (Sterling Knight) boyfriend of Lilly in the episode \\"My Best Friend's Boyfriend\\". Miley finds out he is cheating on Lilly in the same episode and then Lilly breaks up with him. *Henrietta Laverne (Jaelin Palmer) also known as \\"The Cracker\\" appears in \\"Schooly Bully\\". She bullys Dandruff Danny, then starts to bully Miley. Miley and Lilly hear rumor that she was kicked out of her old school and they get scared. Miley asks Roxy for help, but she refuses so Miley acts like a Puma to scare The Cracker off. Which does not work. In the end, Miley and Lilly conduct a plan for the principal to catch The Cracker, and it worked, which turned out to be Roxy using reverse psychology. It is also assumed that she bullies people because she was bullied because of her name. *Guillermo Montoya (Michael Steger) is, in Oliver's opinion, the greatest tennis player in the world. He appears backstage at a Hannah concert where he meets Hannah, Lola, and for the first time, Mike Standley. He is a fierce competitor and claims to never lose. He plays in the United People's Relief Celebrity Pro-Am tournament, and picks Hannah as his celebrity partner after Kelly Clarkson has to drop out. *Joey Vitolo (Joey Fatone) is a retired Major League Baseball player and was the first player to hit five home runs in his first five at bats. His career was abruptly ended after he injured his shoulder doing a celebratory cartwheel on his last home run. After leaving baseball he owns and operates \\"Vitolo's\\", an Italian restaurant in Pasadena. He tends to shy away from fans, possibly from the ill treatment he has received by sportscasters after his retirement. It is also revealed that he has an ambition of becoming a pop star. He performs with Hannah at \\"Vitolo's\\". His daughter, Angela Vitolo (Juliette Goglia), Joey Vitolo's daughter, is a huge fan of Hannah Montana. *Cindy Merriweather (Edie McClurg) is the puppeteer of Pancake Buffalo (actually performed by Victor Yerrid, voiced by Susie Geiser), the puppet star of a long running children's television program. Pancake is a purple buffalo puppet and has a large number of loyal fans, known as \\"Buffalo Buddies.\\" Merriweather pretends that Pancake is real. She has a weakness for Swiss truffles. *Isis (Rachel York) is a famous pop star who has dominated the charts for 20 years. Both Miley and Lilly have been fans of Isis since they were young. Hannah and Lola meet Isis in \\"Yet Another Side of Me\\" where she makes Hannah question her career. Isis is based on the real-life pop star Madonna. Both are named after revered maternal figures (Isis and the Madonna) and both are known for regularly changing their image. Isis' songs \\"Immaterial Girl\\" and \\"Impress Yourself\\" reference Madonna's songs \\"Material Girl\\" and \\"Express Yourself\\". *Austin Rain (Mark Hapka) is a young country rocker who collaborates with Hannah for the successful duet \\"Us Isn't Us Without You.\\" Austin and Hannah's publicists have them fake date in public, but they both secretly hate each other. Hannah comes clean about the relationship live on The Real Deal with Colin Lassiter, his real name is Albert Niedermayer. *Evan (Kunal Sharma) is Traci's boyfriend in \\"It's My Party and I'll Lie If I Want To\\". Traci mentioned having an ex-boyfriend in \\"Once, Twice, Three Times Afraidy\\". *Holly (Josie Lopez) is an actress who appeared in a commercial for a toe fungus treatment. She stars alongside Jake Ryan in a film and they fake date to increase publicity. *Marissa Hughes (Nicole Anderson) is an actress who stars in Teen Gladiators and the Sword of Fire with Jake Ryan. According to Jake, he and Marissa pretend to be dating to increase interest in the film, similarly to how he had earlier dated Holly. On Jake and Marissa's fake date he says Miley's name rather than Marissa. *Alison (Katerina Graham) is Jackson's on and off-again girlfriend. She appeared in episodes, \\"No Sugar, Sugar (cancelled)\\", \\"Jake... Another Little Piece of My Heart\\" and \\"Uptight (Oliver's Alright).\\" She was last seen when she dumped Jackson after he got a good mark on a test because of her. *Heather (Gina DeVivo) is a skateboard competitor. She has beaten Lilly multiple times in an annual competition, and enjoys taunting Lilly about it. Her sidekick friend is Kim (Destiny Edmond). Crossover characters :Hannah Montana is set in the same time as That's So Raven,No characters originating on That's So Raven have appeared on Hannah Montana, yet Raven Baxter appeared alongside Hannah in a crossover episode on The Suite Life of Zack & Cody.

Maddie's mother, Margie Fitzpatrick, is a fan of Robbie Ray. Maddie is starstruck when she meets him.

Sophie is an enthusiastic Hannah Montana fan and is excited when she gets to meet her. She later dresses up like Hannah, and Lilly dresses up like Hannah in order to cover for Miley while she goes to look for Roxy. Sophie is unconvinced that Lilly is Hannah because she has no talent. *Agent Kaplan (Laird Macintosh) is a childish Secret Service agent who is assigned to protect President Martinez and Sophie.

Tipton and tries to impress her by getting dessert for her. *Cody Martin (Cole Sprouse) and Bailey Pickett (Debby Ryan) appear as a couple in \\"Super(stitious) Girl.\\" Hannah gives them tickets to her concert in Hawaii, as well as to the afterparty. Hannah met Cody years earlier, in \\"The That's So Suite Life Of Hannah Montana,\\" though she was only able to recognize Cody (mistaking him for Zack) in Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana when he had cake on his shirt. (This was because in \\"That's So Suite Life Of Hannah Montana\\" she ate cake off Zack's shirt). *Raven Baxter( Raven-Symon√©) is Hannah Montana's fashion designer whom she met in The Suite Life of Zack & Cody. Raven made her a dress for an award show after Hannah and London were fighting over the first one. Real-life characters Real-life celebrities portrayed by themselves *Larry David was the first celebrity to guest star as himself.

When he moves and says, \\"What are you looking at me for, you troglodite?\\" Cena walks up to him from behind and touches him. Jackson steps away and Cena tells him to read the book (not the magazine). Jackson replies, \\"But reading hurts,\\" so Cena picks him up and slams him. Then, he locks him up in a submission, uses the Attitude Adjustment on him, does his signature \\"You Can't See Me\\" and uses the Five Knuckle Shuffle. At the point of Jackson almost getting hit, he wakes up. *Ray Romano, the star of the TV show Everybody Loves Raymond, appears in \\"We're All On This Date Together.\\" A round of golf with Romano is being offered at a charity auction which is eventually sold to Oliver for $11.

Hannah at first desperately wants the part, but later tries to lose the job in order to impress Oliver. Hannah acts like a diva in front of Riener who assumes that she is trying to impress him with her acting skills. Hannah proves that she is not acting by dumping a cup of ice water down Reiner's shirt. *Nancy O'Dell appears as herself in \\"Cheat It.\\" She interviews Hannah and Austin Rain on the red carpet at the 15th annual Teen Scene Awards. *David Archuleta comes to California in \\"Promma Mia\\" in order to do some recording. He asks Hannah to record a duet with him (\\"I Wanna Know You\\") and she accepts, while at the same time going back on her promise to attend prom with her schoolmate Aaron. While recording the song, Archuleta gives Hannah a rose which reminds her of Aaron. She then decides not to break her promise, says a quick goodbye to Archuleta, and leaves the studio before finishing the song. *Sheryl Crow appears as herself in the fourth season and sings a duet with Hannah called \\"Need a Little Love\\" *Iyaz appears as himself in the fourth-season episode \\"Hannah's Gonna Get This\\" and sings a duet with Hannah called \\"Gonna Get This\\" after her failure to make her fans like her new song. *Jay Leno appears as himself.

He is denied his appointment by arriving two minutes late, and this helps Miley realize how strict the DMV is. Just before leaving, Schwarzenegger utters the famous line \\"I'll be back!\\", referencing his role in the film The Terminator. *Barack Obama (Reggie Brown), the President of the United States of America, appears in \\"Hannah Montana to the Principal's Office\\". President Obama comes to the Stewart's Ranch, after Miley makes a call to him to get her registered at her high school. He appears to be aware of Miley's double-life, as well as other secrets about Lilly and Robby. *Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Duffy), the Queen of England, visits California and Hannah and Robby perform for her. Because the Queen is late, Hannah speeds the tempo of the song and abbreviates the lyrics so that she can still attend Jackson's championship volleyball game. The Queen is attended by her humorless servant Simon Tisdale (Patrick Kerr) who briefs Hannah on Royal etiquette. The Queen is later seen, possibly in an apocryphal throwaway joke, visiting the Stewarts' home and playing a dancing video game (similar to Dance Dance Revolution) with Mamaw. In \\"Test of My Love,\\" Trey's parents invite Miley to a gala with Queen Elizabeth and Miley admits that she has already met the Queen, almost blowing her Hannah secret. *Ozzy Osbourne (Jason Earles) Though this was not a fictional portrayal, Jackson impersonated Osbourne at a Hannah concert in order to lure Hannah's critic Barney Bitman away from the concert.  Characters from Hannah Montana: The Movie  *Travis Brody (Lucas Till) is Miley's love interest in Hannah Montana: The Movie and comes from Crowley Corners in Tennessee. He was a childhood friend of Miley's and doesn't know her secret. When the towns people were angry about a mall being built, he suggests that Miley gets Hannah to perform a concert to support the town. When he finds out her secret he is upset that he was lied to, but learns to forgive her when she reveals her secret to the crowd at the concert. Their relationship doesn't last into the TV series, as Miley ends up with Jesse. *Vita (Vanessa L. Williams) is Hannah's publicist and only appears in Hannah Montana: The Movie. She was not happy when she got into a fight with Tyra Banks over shoes, and later appears near the end of the film, to help keep Miley's secret under wraps. *Oswald Granger (Peter Gunn) is the main antagonist of the film. He is a paparazzo who tries to discover Miley's secret. He follows her to Crowley Corners, on a tip given to him by Lilly. When he snaps a picture of Lilly dressed as Hannah, and thus keeps a low profile in the movie. When Miley decides to confess her secret to the people of Crowley Corners, Oswald snaps a picture and is chased down and cornered. He threatens to send the pictures to his editor, but is convinced by his own daughters not to spoil the secret. *Lorelai (Melora Hardin) is Robby Ray's love interest in Hannah Montana: The Movie. She is connected to the mayor as she was able to set up a meeting with him. *Mr. Bradley (Barry Bostwick) is a land developer who plans on building a mall on the fields of Crowley Corners, much to the towns peoples objection, because of the loss of open land. He seems pretty set on his goal as he taunts the town by telling them they won't stop him. Travis convinces Miley to invite Hannah to support their town. After the concert at the end of the movie the mall development doesn't pull through. *Lucinda (Jane Parr) She is the editor of BonChic, a British Magazine and Oswald's boss. She has a goal to find out Hannah Montana's secret and expose it to the world, and has Oswald follow her to Crowley Corners, often giving him phone-calls to get his job done.

She speaks about her predicament to an Immigration Officer, who is familiar with Thai culture, having worked in Thailand for many years and is married to a Thai woman. Through investigations by both the Immigration and Naturalization Service; and the State Labor Commission, a raid is planned on the apartment complex.

These forces seized S√≥c TrƒÉng and then moved towards Oudong, then royal capital of Cambodia. Ang Tong requested aid from M·∫°c Thi√™n T·ª©, who secured a truce with the Nguy·ªÖn lord, in exchange for a few more provinces, namely G√≤ C√¥ng and T√¢n An. Ten years later, the Cambodian throne was seized by Outey II, with the help of Nguy·ªÖn and Mac. In return for their contributions, he granted them seven provinces, including S√≥c TrƒÉng, Tr√† Vinh, Kampot, and Kompong Som. The de jure pretense of loyalty to the Le was performed by Vo vuong.

It is on the border with Burma, contiguous with the Tanintharyi Nature Reserve. It is a popular park owing to its proximity to the tourist town of Hua Hin. Geography Kaeng Krachan Reservoir The park covers parts of the districts Nong Ya Plong, Kaeng Krachan, and Tha Yang of Phetchaburi Province, and of Hua Hin of Prachuap Khiri Khan Province. It consists mainly of rain forest on the eastern slope of the Tenasserim Mountain Range. The highest elevation in the park is 1,513 meters, in a \\"joint area of Thailand and Myanmar\\". The second highest mountain peak is Kao Panern Toong with an elevation of 1,207 m. Two main rivers originate within the park area, the Pranburi River and the Phetchaburi River. The Phetchaburi is impounded by the Kaeng Krachan Dam at the eastern border of the park. The dam creates a lake covering an area of 46.5 km2. The dam was built in 1966. History The park was declared a reserve in 1964 and on 12 June 1981 it became the 28th national park of Thailand. Originally covering an area of 2,478 km2 (1.5 million rai; 240,000 ha), it was enlarged in December 1984 to include the boundary area between Phetchaburi and Prachuap Khiri Khan Provinces, an additional 300,000 rai. The park has been included in the list of ASEAN Heritage Parks. Since 2011, Thailand has proposed that Unesco designate Kaeng Krachan Natural Park a world heritage site. Myanmar claims that about one-third of the land included in Thailand's claim‚Äîalmost 1,000 km2‚Äîis part of Myanmar's Tanintharyi Region and has opposed Thailand's effort. The killing of wild elephants is a big problem at the park,noname (wild) at Kaeng Krachan National Park with authorities unable to control poachers. Some park officials are allegedly involved in the trade of elephant parts.5 park officials wanted for poaching elephants - Witness 'saw carcass burnt' at Kaeng Krachan (Thailand) Despite national park status, there are private plantations within the confines of Kaeng Krachan National Park. Some of these are surrounded by electric fences which, in June 2013, fatally electrocuted an elephant calf. In 2018, the park started taking bids on a project to pave 18.5 kilometres of the Bang Krang to Phanoen Thung Road. It is budgeted at 87.62 million baht. The existing one- lane dirt road is \\"broken beyond repair\\" according to the park's chief. Environmentalists oppose the project on the grounds that easier accessibility will mean more tourists in the fragile ecosystem. The park chief says, \\"...the project does not violate regulations...and [we have] a duty...to proceed with the project.\\" The project was halted, at least temporarily, in early-November 2018 by the National Parks Department to allow opponents to be heard on the issue. Flora and fauna The forests contain a great biodiversity of tropical vegetation, including tropical and subtropical broad leaf tree species and palms. Ninety-one species of mammals and 461 bird species have been counted in the park.

A sound speed gradient leads to refraction of sound wavefronts in the direction of lower sound speed, causing the sound rays to follow a curved path. The radius of curvature of the sound path is inversely proportional to the gradient. When the sun warms the Earth's surface, there is a negative temperature gradient in atmosphere. The speed of sound decreases with decreasing temperature, so this also creates a negative sound speed gradient. The sound wave front travels faster near the ground, so the sound is refracted upward, away from listeners on the ground, creating an acoustic shadow at some distance from the source. The opposite effect happens when the ground is covered with snow, or in the morning over water, when the sound speed gradient is positive. In this case, sound waves can be refracted from the upper levels down to the surface. In underwater acoustics, speed of sound depends on pressure (hence depth), temperature, and salinity of seawater, thus leading to vertical speed gradients similar to those that exist in atmospheric acoustics. However, when there is a zero sound speed gradient, values of sound speed have the same \\"isospeed\\" in all parts of a given water column (there is no change in sound speed with depth). The same effect happens in an isothermal atmosphere with the ideal gas assumption.

Biography Stader was born in Budapest, Austria-Hungary, on November 5, 1911, as Maria Moln√°r.\\"Maria Stader erinnert sich\\", Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen, 2 November 2011 During and after World War I, the price of food in Budapest was so high that it was difficult for her parents to support their five children. Maria and her younger sister, Elisabeth, were taken to Switzerland by The Salvation Army to recuperate for three months after being diagnosed with malnutrition. There, Maria's foster parents requested she stay for a full nine months. However, once in Budapest again, Maria fell seriously ill and it was also determined she would need her tonsils operated on. Her foster parents arranged for her to return to Switzerland. Because of difficulties with the immigration office, Maria could not remain in the canton of Z√ºrich, so her foster father found her a place with the Stader family in Romanshorn, where there is also the commemorative Maria-Stader path. They later adopted her. In 1939, Stader married Hans Erismann, the music director of Weinfelden and later the choir director of the Z√ºrich Opera House. Through the husband of her vocal teacher, Mathilde B√§rlocher, she met Stefi Geyer and her husband. Geyer herself was born in Budapest and had moved to Z√ºrich in 1920; she then became an ongoing supporter of Stader's career. Another native of Budapest, Ilona Durigo, became her vocal teacher in 1935 in Z√ºrich and introduced her to Hermann and Lily Reiff (a student of Franz Liszt). The Reiffs' home was the frequent meeting place of Adolf Busch and his brother Hermann Busch, Thomas Mann and the entire ensemble of the Z√ºrich Opera and Z√ºrich Theater. Fritz Busch arranged for Stader to go to the School in Tremezzo, run by the wife of Artur Schnabel, a few years later. From 1938 on, Stader received training from Giannina Arangi- Lombardi in Milan. Stader was a close friend of the Swiss politician Walther Bringolf, as well as of numerous musicians ‚Äì especially pianist Clara Haskil and the Hungarian conductor Ferenc Fricsay (with whom she became acquainted through Rolf Liebermann). She was also a friend of the French film director, Emil-Edwin Reinert and she corresponded with Albert Schweitzer. Career Stader first achieved fame for her interpretations of Mozart and her collaborations with conductor Ferenc Fricsay on works such as Don Giovanni, Le nozze di Figaro, The Abduction from the Seraglio, two versions (1954 and 1960) of 'Exsultate, jubilate' and the Great Mass, as well as Verdi's Messa da Requiem. She won, the Geneva International Music Competition in 1939, but although she \\"seemed poised for major stardom... her career was delayed by the outbreak of World War II,\\" according to Opera News.\\"Maria Stader\\" in Opera News, July 1999. Later in her career, Stader acquired a reputation as an outstanding Bach interpreter, especially with Karl Richter and Ferenc Fricsay. She recorded the Requiem by Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k with Karel Anƒçerl, and Beethoven's opera Fidelio (as Marzelline) with Hans Knappertsbusch. Stader was highly praised for her fine, if not very powerful, voice. She nearly always performed operatic roles in the recording studio and seldom, if ever, on stage because of her small stature ‚Äì she was about tall. She preferred the concert repertory, but, \\"even in concert, she frequently had to stand on a platform or box in order to be seen properly by the audience,\\" according to Opera News. This also enabled Stader to avoid the strain experienced by many operatic singers, and preserve her fresh and delicate-sounding voice until well into the 1960s. She stood on the concert podium for the last time in Philharmonic Hall in New York in Mozart's Requiem on December 7, 1969, \\"still in solid vocal condition.\\" Stader with accompanist husband Hans Erismann 1963.

Aprunculus is venerated as a saint; his feast day at Trier is April 22. His relics are preserved at Springiersbach Abbey. He is the patron saint of Bruchsal in Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Life Aprunculus may have belonged either to the disempowered pre-Frankish clergy of Trier or to the clergy sent to Trier from Auvergne by Theuderic I. There is a widespread story that Saint Gall was active in Trier at the same time as Aprunculus but this is unhistorical, as Gallus lived a century later. The absence of information on the bishops of Trier in the late 5th and early 6th centuries in contemporary sources suggests that the church in Trier was not significant politically in this period.MDZ/Digitale Bivliothek H H Anton, Trier im fr√ºhen Mittelalter, online version Veneration St. Abrunculus (Besslich) Aprunculus was probably buried in a small oratory on the site of St. Symphorian's Abbey in Trier. Since the end of the 6th century he has been venerated as a saint. He is recorded in the Martyrologium Hieronymianum. Gregory of Tours mentions him. There are reports of his veneration in Trier from the 10th century onwards, and also in Auxerre, Autun and Gellone in Languedoc. A portrait of him is found in the Egbert Psalter. In 1047 his remains were transferred to St. Paulinus' Church, Trier, where his grave was in a small crypt under the altar of St. Clement in front of the choir. In 1107 some of the relics were taken, along with those of Saint Modoald, by Abbot Thietmar for Helmarshausen Abbey in North Hesse. Others came in 1136 to Springiersbach Abbey. At this time other bones may have been translated to the Aprunculus Chapel in the immediate vicinity of Trier Cathedral. The remaining bones in St. Paulinus' were brought into the city in 1674 before the destruction of the church. An inscribed lead plaque was removed from the coffin and placed in the reliquary. In the area round Trier Aprunculus is patron of churches in Be√ülich in NewelRoscheiderhof.de: Be√ülich and Itzig (in Luxembourg). His feast day is 22 April. References *Holweck, F. G.

Additionally, he won six medals at the FIL European Luge Championships with four golds (Men's singles: 1978, 1984; Men's doubles: 1971, 1974), one silver (Men's singles: 1979), and one bronze (Mixed team: 1988). He also won the Luge World Cup overall title in men's singles in 1978-9, 1980-81 (tied with fellow Italian Ernst Haspinger), and 1982-3. Hildgartner is the only person to win a gold medal in men's singles luge and doubles luge at the Winter Olympics, FIL World Luge Championships, and FIL European Luge Championships. He was among the first inductees into the International Luge Federation (FIL) Hall of Fame in 2004, along with Klaus Bonsack and Margit Schumann. Following the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, the 17th turn at Cesana Pariol where the bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton events took place was renamed in his honour.

He cast Paul Robeson, Dudley Digges, Frank H. Wilson, and Fredi Washington. The screenplay was written by DuBose Heyward and filmed at Kaufman Astoria Studios with the beach scene shot at Jones Beach Long Beach, New York. Robeson starred in the O'Neill play on stage, both in the United States and the United Kingdom, a role that had helped launch his career. Background The film is based rather loosely on O'Neil's play, but adds an entire backstory before O'Neill's actual play begins, and includes several new characters that do not appear in it (such as Jones' girlfriend, and a friendly priest who advises him to give up his evil ways). The film does provide what may be Robeson's greatest dramatic performance in a movie. In the film version, the opening shots are of an African ritual dance. Some critics are quick to assess the opening as representative of the \\"primitive\\" black world to which Brutus Jones will eventually revert. However, more scholarly reviews of the film understand the complexities of the allusion to and comparison between the roots of the African-American church and the rhythmic chanting often seen in African religious practices. As discussed further, below, its director, Dudley Murphy, had co-directed Ballet Mecanique and other musically-based experimental films. Having just spent several years in Hollywood, he now craved the freedom to use musical forms as a way of translating O'Neill's experimentation on stage into a film form. Paul Robeson was already a musical star and would go on to study traditional African music and dance while on location in Nigeria and with scholars in London. A quick dissolve takes us into a Baptist church in the American South, where the dancing of the congregation presents an image that argues for a continuity between the \\"savage\\" Africans and the ring-shout Baptists. Such suggestive editing may be the kind of element that causes viewers to suspect the film of racism. Similarly, the film makes copious use of the word \\"nigger\\", as did O'Neill's original play. African Americans criticized O'Neill's language at the time, so its preservation and expansion in the film present another cause for critique. In fact, in the original production in 1920, the actor playing Jones, Charles Sidney Gilpin, a leading man in the all-African American Lafayette players, objected to the use of the word \\"nigger\\" to playwright Eugene O'Neill and began substituting \\"Negro\\" in the Provincetown Players premiere. He continued to do so when the show went on tour for two years in the States. In this, he reflected the African-American community's problematic relationship with the play. O'Neill, an ex-sailor who freely used offensive epithets, had based the character, down to some specific traits and use of language, on an African-American friend from the New England waterfront,Arthur R. and Barbara Gelb, O'Neill ‚Äì Life with Monte Cristo, New York, (2000) p. 349-50. and felt the use of the word was dramatically justified. They could not come to a reconciliation and O'Neill gave the part to the much younger and then-unknown Paul Robeson for the 1924 New York revival and then its London premiere, both of which launched Robeson as the first black leading man of heretofore white American and British theater. Given Robeson's subsequent career as a Civil Rights activist, his character using the term so frequently in regard to other blacks seems shocking today, but Robeson would not have had his impact on civil rights had he never played this role. It made him a star, in a way that virtually no other part in the 1920s and '30s could have done; with its powerful visions of a slave ship and being sold at auction, the role of Brutus Jones had a scope and a reality that no American play had had for a black man before. Robeson often struggled with the inherent racist and imperialist limits of what few leading man roles there were for a black actor then and ran into criticism at the time because of it (see Sanders of the River, a 1935 film set in Nigeria). Plot At a Baptist prayer meeting, the preacher leads a prayer for Brutus Jones, who has just been hired as a Pullman Porter, a job that served the upward mobility of thousands of African-American men in the first half of the 20th century. Jones proudly shows off his uniform to his girlfriend Dolly (and the film's audience, setting up the contrast with the later scenes in which \\"the Emperor Jones\\" parades around in overdone military garb) before joining the congregation for a spiritual. But Jones is quickly corrupted by the lures of the big city, taking up with fast women and gamblers. One boisterous crap game leads to a fight in which he inadvertently stabs Jeff, the man who had introduced him to the fast-life and from whom he had stolen the affections of the beautiful Undine (played by Fredi Washington). Jones was imprisoned and sent to do hard labor. (A stint on the chain gang allows the film its first opportunity to show Robeson without his shirt on, an exposure of male nudity unusual for 1933 and certainly for a black actor. Here and later the director plays on Robeson's sexual power and, implicitly, on cultural stereotypes about the libidinal power of black men.) Jones escapes the convict's life after striking a white guard who was torturing and beating another prisoner. Making his way home, he briefly receives the assistance of his girlfriend Dolly before taking a job stoking coal on a steamer headed for the Caribbean. One day, he catches sight of a remote island and jumps ship, swimming to the island. The island is under the crude rule of a top-hatted black despot who receives merchandise from Smithers, the dilapidated white colonial merchant who is the sole Caucasian on the island. Jones rises to become Smithers' partner and eventually \\"Emperor\\". He dethrones his predecessor with a trick that allows him to survive what appears to be a fusillade of bullets, creating the myth that he can only be slain by a silver one. Jones's rule of the island involves increasing taxes on the poor natives and pocketing the proceeds. The highlight is a twelve-minute spoken monologue taken directly from O'Neill's play, in which Brutus Jones (Robeson), hunted by natives in revolt, flees through the jungle and slowly disintegrates psychologically, becoming a shrieking hysteric who runs right into the path of his pursuers. This section was written as a nearly autobiographical account by O'Neill, who had gone off to Honduras the year after his graduation from Princeton and gotten hopelessly lost in the jungle, resulting in hallucinatory fears.

Murphy was restricted to a trip to Haiti to bring back extras, musicians and dancers. As a newly self- imposed exile of the Hollywood studio system, Murphy had insisted on New York as opposed to Los Angeles; an early advocate of an independent New York-based cinema, free of Hollywood control. As the co-director of Ballet Mecanique ‚Äì though Fernand L√©ger would become far more famous for this experimental, non- narrative film ‚Äì Murphy had explored avant-garde film from its earliest days in Paris, and he wanted creative freedom the New York symbolized to him. He also prized access to the New York-based African-American community's highly trained theatrical talent. Robeson had only one location requirement: no filming south of the Mason‚ÄìDixon line‚Äîthat is, in the then Jim Crow, segregated southern states of the former Confederacy. The producers, director and screenwriter were required to present the screenplay to Eugene O'Neill before filming could commence; fearful because they'd added quite a bit of material, by making new scenes from what on stage were entirely in monologue, they were delighted to find O'Neill gave the screenplay his blessing, saying they'd \\"written a fine three-act play.\\"Susan Delson, Dudley Murphy, Hollywood Wild Card (2005), Kindle edition, p. 1835. O'Neill received $30,000 for the rights, a not insubstantial sum in the height of the Depression, which he badly needed for an expensive summer home he'd just purchased. Paul Robeson got $5000 a week, comparable to star prices out in Hollywood. The budget was roughly $200,000. Dudley Murphy and screenwriter DuBose Heyward had both been experimenting in using imagery that is held together by the film's music, rather than dialogue or narrative. In the case of The Emperor Jones, the director was trying to do both, not always successfully. Robeson would later complain that Murphy was condescending to him, that he was rushed through important scenes. Murphy was, in truth, far more interested in camera angles and visual experiments than in acting. He had no theater background to speak of, and further reports surfaced that he was completely out of his element in Robeson's crucial jungle scenes‚Äîthe only parts of the film that actually used O'Neill's hallucinatory dialogue‚Äîand William C. deMille (Cecil B. DeMille's older brother) had to be brought in to complete them ‚Äì something DeMille himself claimed but was disputed by others. Emperor Jones also suffered at the hands of the Hays Office, whose Production Code was in place and had been since 1930, if only haphazardly enforced until the arrival of censor Joseph Breen the following year. (The use of the term \\"pre-code\\" for films made during and before 1934 is actually a misnomer; it refers to Breen's ascendancy, not to the absence of a code.) Black on white violence was strictly forbidden, so a scene in which Jones kills a sadistic white prison guard had to be cut, leaving a lurch in the action. Haitian women smoking were cut; a white trader lighting a cigarette for the Emperor was cut. A steamy scene between Robeson and Fredi Washington as a prostitute had to be reshot when the Hays Office decreed she was too light-skinned and might be mistaken for a white woman; the actress had to wear dark make-up when the scene filmed a second time (the following year, Fredi Washington, a lifelong civil rights activist, would star in the original Imitation of Life (1934), playing an African-American girl passing for white). Worst of all, the hallucinations in the jungle of the slave ship and the auction were removed, undercutting the film's \\"dramatic resonance and doing a serious injustice to Eugene O'Neill's play\\", as Murphy's biographer wrote in 2005.Delson, Dudley Murphy (2005), Kindle edition, p. 2003. Reception The film was a box office disappointment for United Artists. The black-and-white film had blue tinting for the jungle scenes, something for which Murphy went to considerable trouble in this era before color ‚Äì but it was considered old-fashioned, a throw-back to the silent era, and disappeared from most prints. In 2002, the Library of Congress restored The Emperor Jones using archive footage. This version was able to restore the cut scenes of black-on-white violence, in addition to several minor changes. Unfortunately, no existing film of the two cut dream sequences was found, and thus this edition remains incomplete. Awards In 1999, the film was deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\" by the United States Library of Congress, and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. ‚Äì thus setting the stage for its restoration. DVD release The film is in the public domain now, and can be purchased at many online outlets. A newly remastered version (with commentary and extras) was released on DVD by The Criterion Collection in 2006.

The book is by Roberto Trippini, music and lyrics by Lawrence Mark Wythe. It has been suggested that Wythe is perhaps the most talented British composer and lyricist of his generation, and that he is an exciting new voice in British musical theatre which has for some time not produced hit musicals from unknown creatives, i.e. beyond those created by already established names. Critical reception In 2010, Lyn Gardner in The Guardian said that much of the score for Tomorrow Morning was \\"sublime, and sublimely delivered\\". She gave the show three and a half stars. Time Out London gave the show four stars and made it Critics Choice. Michael Coveny in The Independent had less glowing praise for the show itself, but pointed out Wythe's skill as a composer and lyricist, and his potential for the future. Paul Vale in The Stage called the show \\"thoughtful and intelligent\\". Mark Shenton, in the Sunday Express, described the show as \\"coolly adult, neatly propelled by an earnest song cycle\\". Critic Mark Shenton has previously supported the show, and described Wythe as potentially the most talented British musical theatre writer of his generation.

Extraordinary This show was commissioned by Perfect Pitch Musicals for the BBC Children in Need in 2017 and developed at the University of Central Lancashire UCLAN in Preston, England. The premiere studio production was directed by Pip Minnithorpe and choreographed by Ellen Kane. Wythe wrote book, music and lyrics for the show which was featured on Children in Need in November 2017. Framed Originally title Girlfriends the show was renamed Framed after some confusion in the industry over an earlier musical by composer Howard Goodall. Framed is a musical romcom which was presented in London in 2011 with a cast including Emma Williams, Michael Xavier, Ashleigh Gray and Gabriel Vick. The show began life as a commission from a Korean producer and after development in 2010 with a bookwriter, the show was taken on as an independent project and rewritten by Wythe and has yet to see a full scale professional production. Roll On The Day This show played at the Etcetera Theatre in London in 2012. With a book by Roberto Trippini, the musical was directed by Vik Savilingam and produced by Katy Lipson of Aria Entertainment. Roll On... is a highly political piece about an African illegal immigrant painter who is trapped in a sting operation by a racist detective and a self-interested woman.

It combines three previously published individual modules: Pharaoh, Oasis of the White Palm, and Lost Tomb of Martek. The modules were made for use with the first edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D;) rules. Pharaoh was created by Tracy and Laura Hickman soon after the couple married in 1977, and published by TSR in 1982. Oasis of the White Palm was a collaboration between Tracy Hickman and Philip Meyers, and Hickman wrote the Lost Tomb of Martek on his own; both were printed in 1983. Each module is an Egyptian-styled adventure. The individual modules were well received by critics at the time of their release, and the compilation garnered accolades in the early 2000s. Plot summary Pharaoh Pharaoh is an Egyptian-styled adventure that includes a pyramid map and a trap-filled maze. Oasis of the White Palm In Oasis of the White Palm, the PCs arrive at the Oasis of the White Palm, which is on the brink of turmoil. Shadalah, who is to be the bride of the sheikh's eldest son, has been kidnapped. The sheikh believes her to be held by his enemies somewhere in the oasis. The PCs must solve the mystery before they can progress further. Once the characters make the contacts they need at the oasis, they continue to the temple of Set and the crypt of Badr al-Mosak, and the adventure concludes in the city of Phoenix; there, the PCs must obtain the three Star Gems (the one from Amun-Re's tomb in the previous adventure and two more introduced here) and free the djinni if they plan to move on to the next module.Meyers, Philip and Tracy Hickman. Oasis of the White Palm (TSR, 1983) The Oasis of the White Palm module contains wilderness maps, and also includes a number of smaller adventures. Lost Tomb of Martek The goal of the PCs is the tomb of the millennium-dead wizard Martek. The tomb lies in the vast Desert of Desolation, and the majority of the adventure takes place within Martek's tomb. The adventurers have to cross a sea of glass on skate-ships, and then pass through the Crystal Prism and the Mobius Tower in order to reach the final crypt. The adventure is organized into seven parts, taking the party from the desert through a number of planes on their way to the Citadel of Martek. They must use the Star Gems to revive the dead wizard. When they have done so, he lets them choose from a variety of magical treasure, and leaves to defeat the Efreet.Hickman, Tracy Raye. Lost Tomb of Martek (TSR, 1983) Publication history In 1977, Tracy Hickman (co-creator of the Dragonlance campaign setting) and Laura Hickman were married. Soon after, while living in Provo, Utah, they wrote the adventures Pharaoh and Ravenloft. The Hickmans decided to privately publish the first two adventures they had designed together, Rahasia and Pharaoh, which earned them a reputation on a local level. Pharaoh was published as part of the \\"Night Ventures\\" line of scenarios in 1980, by DayStar West Media Productions, as a sixty-eight-page book. However, disaster struck when Tracy went into business with an associate who went bad, leaving the Hickmans to cover thirty-thousand dollars in bad checks. They were driven into bankruptcy, and Tracy Hickman decided to sell their modules to TSR, \\"literally so that I could buy shoes for my children\\". TSR decided not only to buy the modules, but hire Tracy as a game designer: : \\"They said it would be easier to publish my adventures if I was part of the company. So, we made the move from Utah to Wisconsin.\\" In 1982, TSR published Pharaoh as a thirty-two-page booklet with two outer folders, for the first edition of AD&D.; It was designed for 6-8 player characters of levels 5‚Äì7, and formed the first of the three-part Desert of Desolation module series. Oasis of the White Palm is the sequel to the Pharaoh module. TSR published this adventure in 1983 as a thirty-two-page booklet with two outer folders, and the adventure was written by Tracy Hickman and Philip Meyers with cover art by Jim Holloway and interior illustrations by Keith Parkinson. It was intended for 6 to 8 characters of levels 6‚Äì8. Lost Tomb of Martek is the third module in the series, and was designed by Tracy Hickman, for 7th-9th level characters. Lost Tomb of Martek was published in 1983 as a 32-page booklet with two outer folders. The compilation module Desert of Desolation was printed in 1987. The compilation features a cover by Keith Parkinson. It is a revision of the I3, I4, and I5 AD&D; game modules, with additional design and revision by Peter Rice and William John Wheeler. Wheeler attempted to expand on the originals, without altering their tone. The adventures in Desert of Desolation are designed for a 5th-10th level party and have been reworked to fit into the Forgotten Realms setting, and the material was made compatible with the Wilderness Survival Guide rules. In the revision, the designers added additional background material, as well as staging tips for the Dungeon Master. The details of various elements that had been open-ended elements were spelled out. Desert of Desolation includes a 128-page adventure booklet, a sixteen-page maps booklet, and a large A1 sheet of maps and handouts. The compilation module contains new maps, including an isometric map of the tomb of Amun-Re. The revision also introduces ancient inscriptions for the players to decipher. At the time these modules were released, each D&D; module was marked with an alphanumeric code indicating the series to which it belonged. The earlier modules have module codes I3, I4, and I5 respectively, and the combined module's code is I3-5 Reception The modules were well received by critics, both separately and as a compilation. Called \\"The definitive \\"Egyptian-themed\\" D&D; adventure\\", it was ranked the 6th greatest adventure of all time by Dungeon in 2004. Christopher Perkins noted that \\"This adventure introduced a new encounter format later adapted for third edition adventures,\\" serving as the precursor to the format Dungeon would use for third edition. Chris Pramas felt the backstory made the adventure \\"so much more interesting than the typical dungeon bash, and the whole series dripped with atmosphere.\\" Pharaoh and Oasis of the White Palm were reviewed in White Dwarf, No. 45 by Jim Bambra, who gave both modules 10 of out 10 overall. Bambra felt that the presentation of both modules was excellent, and liked the new format, which utilized a short paragraph to quickly describe how the adventure should be run. He felt that this system, which also included distinct listings of traps, tricks, monsters, and treasure, \\"makes it far easier to find information quickly and reduced the chance of leaving something important out in the heat of play.\\" While Bambra was disappointed with I1 Dwellers of the Forbidden City, he felt that with I2 Tomb of the Lizard King and these two modules \\"the I series is fast becoming one of the best available\\". Bambra concluded by stating that these \\"are both excellent adventures, they are imaginative, colourful and challenging. If I5 The Lost Tomb of Martek is as good as these two the Desert series will be one of the best yet ranking with the G and D modules.\\" Lost Tomb of Martek received a positive review (9 out of 10) from Dave Morris in issue No. 55 of White Dwarf magazine. Morris felt the module met the high standards one would expect from Tracy Hickman. He complimented the \\"fun with spacetime distortion\\", the Mobius Tower, and the Guilders and Maddogs--dimwitted inbred descendants of rogues and paladins, respectively, who became trapped in the tomb over many centuries. According to Morris, \\"There is the sense throughout this adventure that the characters are agents of destiny, heroes fulfilling a chain of events set in motion long ages ago-- the author has succeeded admirably in creating this effect\\". Morris compared this module to Temple of Death, feeling that both are excellent adventures for characters of roughly the same level, but that while the characters would have to retire after the world-shattering adventure in Lost Tomb of Martek, the campaign would not necessarily have to end after playing Temple of Death. Doug Cowie reviewed Lost Tomb of Martek for Imagine magazine. He noted the module's attractive cover, but found the internal illustrations to be of low quality even though they were at times helpful to understand tricky bits of text. Cowie's main problem was with the \\"purple\\" prose of the descriptions to be read aloud by the DM to the players. He doubted that many gamemasters would use them as given. Overall, Cowie thought the module to be of \\"praiseworthy detail\\" and \\"so well designed [he] couldn't help liking it\\". Jim Bambra reviewed the Desert of Desolation compilation release for White Dwarf No. 93, calling it \\"more than a simple repackaging of the three original adventures... The adventure material itself has received considerable expansion.\\" Bambra praised the adventure, stating: > \\"These adventures are classic stuff and have stood the test of time well. > They mix roleplaying, wilderness and dungeon adventuring in an entertaining > and intriguing way. While the roleplaying is fun, and the wilderness > adventures certainly have the feel of being in a dry and dusty desert, it is > the dungeon adventure sections which really shine. These are some of the > best TSR has ever produced--they include tricks, traps, and combat, all the > stuff associated with dungeons. But more importantly, they are connected by > an epic storyline which really catches the flavour of the Arabian Nights.\\" Bambra liked the wall inscriptions in the pharaoh's tomb as part of the revised adventure, feeling that they add to the adventure and give the players some insight into what is going on: \\"They also pose an interesting problem, as they first need to be deciphered. Although written in English, their meanings are cunningly disguised, so some thought will be required to interpret them correctly.\\" He felt that the \\"adventurers must rely on their roleplaying skills to deal with the problems facing them\\" at the Oasis of the White Palm, and that once they figure out the mystery of the place \\"the action really hots up and in more ways than one!\\" Bambra described the last part of the adventure as \\"Another dungeon, but a very interesting one.\\" Bambra concluded his review by stating \\"These are easily the best of TSR's reprint series.\\" Desert of Desolation was reviewed in Dragon No. 126 by Ken Rolston. According to Rolston, \\"Tracy Hickman... is a first-rate designer, and these modules are exceptional examples of the module genre... The original modules were nifty dungeons, with lots of puzzles, monsters, and colorful encounters.\\" Rolston felt that the compilation module was a bit too heavy for his taste, \\"densely packed with information, built around a very linear narrative, and consisting, for the most part, of dungeon crawls--well, it makes slow going, and the writing style of the revision is pretty wordy\\". He also felt that the old- fashioned graphic design did not help the adventure's pacing and readability. Rolston concluded his review by stating \\"The original I3-I5 modules were pretty exciting in their time. In this revised version, they still count as classic AD&D; game adventures. But exciting? I'm afraid not.\\" References External links * Desert series at the Acaeum Category:1982 books Category:Dungeons & Dragons modules ","title":"Desert of Desolation"},{"id":"11685634","text":"Stanley C.

He helped establish the University of Missouri, led the successful effort to get it located in Boone County, and gained funding for the university with the passage of a series of acts in the Missouri Legislature. For his efforts, he was named \\"Father of the University of Missouri.\\"Stephens, 250. As a border state Congressman, Rollins played a role in Congress's passage of the Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery. He changed his vote to support the amendment, and spoke in favor of it. Rollins was a Whig for the first 20 years of his political career. When that party broke up, he began a political transition, changing parties several times before becoming a Republican late in his life. Rollins' lifelong support of business development was compatible with Republican policies, but his situation as a major slaveowner prevented him from joining the Republican Party until well after the Civil War.Mering, 225-226. Early years and family Portrait of Rollins at age 22, by Missouri artist George Caleb Bingham Rollins was born in Richmond, in Madison County, Kentucky. His father, Anthony Wayne Rollins, a physician, was born in Pennsylvania of Scotch-Irish immigrant parents, and named for the Revolutionary War hero Anthony Wayne. His mother, Sarah Harris Rodes Rollins, was born in Virginia and was of English descent. Rollins studied at Richmond Academy, attended Washington College (now Washington and Jefferson College) in Pennsylvania, and graduated from Indiana University in 1830. The Rollins family moved from Kentucky to Boone County, Missouri that same year. Rollins read law in the Columbia office of Abiel Leonard for two years, while helping to manage his father's farm. In 1832, Rollins enlisted in the Black Hawk War, and was given the rank of Major. After the war, Rollins entered law school at Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. When he graduated in 1834, he was admitted to the bar, and began practicing in Columbia that same year.Smith, 4-6. Mary Elizabeth Hickman Rollins. In 1837, Rollins married Mary Elizabeth Hickman (1820‚Äì1907). She was the daughter of James Hickman, and was from Franklin, in nearby Howard County, Missouri. They had 11 children, seven of whom survived to adulthood. Early political career Rollins began his political career as a Whig. His politics reflected his interest in business and resource development. In 1836, he purchased a Whig newspaper, the Columbia Patriot, which he edited for several years. That same year, he attended a railroad convention in St. Louis, where he was chosen to petition Congress for Missouri railroad land grants.Smith, 6. Missouri legislator Rollins was elected to the Missouri Legislature in 1838, representing Boone County. He was elected Representative in 1838, 1840, and 1854, and as a Senator in 1846. He was a delegate to the 1844 Whig National Convention. He ran for Governor of Missouri in 1848 and again in 1857, but was defeated both times. Rollins was a Whig from 1836 to 1855, when the party dissolved in dissension over the Kansas-Nebraska Act regarding the extension of slavery into territories and new states. As a large slaveholder in Missouri, Rollins was not an abolitionist, but he opposed both the extension of slavery and secession.Mering, 217-219. When the Whig Party ended, Rollins began a political transition. He ran as an independent in his second try for governor, supported by Know-Nothings, Thomas Hart Benton Democrats, and remnants of the Whigs. He lost to Democrat Robert M. Stewart by 334 votes. When he was not in the Missouri Legislature, Rollins developed his law practice in Columbia, despite ambivalence about the monotony of a legal career.Smith, 25. Establishment of the University of Missouri The first bill that Rollins drafted as a State Representative was to locate the University of Missouri. The bill directed that the university be located in one of six counties in the central part of the state along the Missouri River: Boone, Callaway, Cole, Cooper, Howard, and Saline Counties. Cole and Howard County legislators had hoped to secure the university for their counties by direct legislation, but Rollins' bill passed on February 8, 1839. Three days later, the Geyer Act, introduced by Henry Geyer of St. Louis, passed, officially incorporating the University of Missouri.Stephens, 12-14. Rollins' act directed that the county that raised the most money would be awarded the university. Rollins himself made a significant donation, and put considerable effort into raising subscriptions from fellow Boone County residents. The competition was most intense among Boone, Callaway, and Howard Counties. When state commissioners visited Howard County, Rollins was there. After learning that Howard County had increased the appraised value of land donated in the competition, Rollins sold of his own land to Boone County for $25 an acre. Boone County in turn appraised the land at $75 an acre in its bid. The $117,921 raised by Boone County was the highest amount, and won the university.Stephens, 15-17. Rollins' efforts to support the University of Missouri met with limited success before the Civil War. As Senator, he drafted a report in 1847 which proposed state funding for the school and a professorship for advanced studies in \\"Theory and Practice of Teaching.\\" The Senate passed a version two years later, providing no funding and only a \\"Normal Professorship.\\"Smith, 19-21. U.S. Representative and the Thirteenth Amendment Rollins was elected to Congress in 1860 as a Constitutional Unionist. He defeated Independent Democrat John B. Henderson. Rollins was elected again in 1862, this time as a Unionist, defeating Radical Republican Arnold Krekel. During the Civil War, Rollins remained a Unionist, and voted for most war measures in Congress. But his stands on slavery and African- American rights were more conservative than those of the dominant Republican Party. He opposed a measure allowing blacks and Indians to enlist in the war, on the basis that this policy would offend Southerners.Smith, 36. He also stated that the Emancipation Proclamation was legally void, and only defensible as a military necessity.Mering, 222-223. In Congress, Rollins introduced a bill to build a transcontinental railroad, passed as the Pacific Railway Acts of 1862. He also advocated the Morrill Act of 1862, providing funding for state agricultural colleges. Rollins' support of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which abolished slavery, played a key part in its passage by Congress, sending the amendment to the states for ratification. The Senate passed the bill easily on its first vote on April 8, 1864, but the House defeated it twice in 1864 before passing it on January 31, 1865. Rollins initially voted against the bill. Shortly before the third vote, President Lincoln personally asked Rollins to support the amendment, as necessary to preserve the Union. Rollins agreed to do so.Vorenberg, 181-182. On January 13, 1865, two days after the Missouri Constitutional Convention abolished slavery there, he spoke for the first time for the amendment, in a lengthy and persuasive speech to Congress.Vorenberg, 187.Smith, 196-221 provides text of Rollins' speech. With Rollins' support, the amendment passed with the required two-thirds majority with just two votes to spare.Vorenberg, 207. Rollins witnessed the Centralia Massacre in 1864. Later political career Rollins did not run for Congress in 1864, but returned to Columbia. In that year's presidential election, he endorsed the Democratic Party candidate, George B. McClellan. This signaled his preference for the party's conservative stance on slavery and African-American equality, and recognized its shift from secessionism. In 1866, he was elected as a Democrat to the Missouri House of Representatives, and in 1868 to the State Senate. There, Rollins supported President Johnson's mild Reconstruction policies, but did not strongly denounce Radical Republican efforts to develop more stringent policies, so as not to harm funding prospects for the University of Missouri.Mering, 223-224.Smith, 243. Rollins' support of business aligned with Republican policies, but his opposition to racial equality kept him from joining that party until after Reconstruction and Republicans stopped pushing for this. Now out of office, he broke with the Democrats in 1878 over their support of paper currency. He became a Republican, and remained one for the rest of his life. While a legislator, Rollins focused on the University of Missouri. The state was not funding the school. The Civil War left the university in poor physical shape and with few students. The local fundraising in the original competition set a precedent for the State Legislature to ignore later requests for money. As a result, the campus was small, the students came mainly from Boone County, and the place seemed more like a county school than a state university.Stephens, 18. As a legislator after the war, Rollins wrote, introduced, and helped pass several measures, which together financially stabilized the University of Missouri for the first time, and strengthened Columbia's hold on it: * Appropriation of $10,000 for a new President's House, and $16,000 per year for general funding (1867). * Establishment of Normal Department to train school teachers (1867). * Establishment of Agricultural and Mechanical College. Concessions to get the bill passed required Boone County to contribute money for the new college, and located the new Missouri School of Mines in Rolla, not in Columbia (1870). * Investment of $122,000 from state sales of \\"seminary lands\\" for higher education, as authorized by the Federal Government (1870). This money was augmented with a similar act in 1883. * Issue of $166,000 in bonds to build the new School of Mines at Rolla (called Missouri University of Science and Technology as of 2008), liquidate University debt, complete the Science Building (called Switzler Hall as of 2008), and add to the university's permanent endowment (1872). * Setting maximum university tuition at 10 dollars, making college easily affordable for most students (1872).Viles, 122-125.Smith, 42-47. Mural of Rollins, by George Caleb Bingham. The mural was located in the Academic Hall of the University of Missouri. Father of the University of Missouri When Rollins returned to Columbia after the 1872 legislative session, students assembled and adopted resolutions thanking him for his work on the university's behalf. The faculty issued a similar statement. The Board of Curators passed resolutions on May 9, 1872 giving Rollins the honorary title of \\"Pater Universitatis Missouriensis\\" (\\"Father of the University of Missouri\\").Smith, 47-49 provides the text of the resolutions. University of Missouri Board of Curators President Rollins was first named to the Board of Curators, the university's governing body, in 1847. He held the position until 1848, when the State Legislature removed the entire Board. He again joined the board in 1869, and was elected its President that same year. He held the position until ill health forced his resignation in 1886.Stephens, 58, 72, 249-250, 305. Friendship with George Caleb Bingham Among his many acquaintances, Rollins had a lifelong friendship with artist and politician George Caleb Bingham. Bingham painted numerous portraits of Rollins family members, including several of Rollins himself. Rollins gave Bingham a boost early in his career by getting several people in Columbia to have him paint their portraits. He later helped Bingham get a commission to do portraits of Thomas Jefferson and George Washington for the Missouri State Capitol,Christ-Janer, 33-34. These paintings were destroyed when the capitol burned in 1911. and he helped finance printings of Bingham's General Order No. 11. Late in Bingham's life, Rollins helped him get a position as the University of Missouri's first art professor.Nagel, 141. Rollins and Bingham named sons after each other.Nagel, 67. Bingham frequently visited the Rollins home, sometimes staying for a month at a time. The two maintained a frequent correspondence for over forty-five years, until Bingham's death, in which they discussed a variety of personal, social, and political issues. Death Gravesite of James Rollins in the Rollins Family Plot, Columbia Cemetery In 1874, Rollins was injured in a train wreck while traveling to St. Louis. He was bedridden for several months, and although he recovered to live 14 more years, he never fully regained his strength. Rollins died on January 9, 1888 in Columbia, Missouri. He is buried there at Columbia Cemetery. Notes References * Christ-Janer, Albert, George Caleb Bingham of Missouri, The Story of an Artist (1940).

Construction HMS Doris was one of nine Eclipse-class cruisers built in the years 1896-99, which were the direct successor to the Astraea class. They were larger in size and displacement, and received stronger armor and armor with a similar speed to their predecessors. HMS Doris had a displacement of 5690 t (5600 long tones) at an overall length of 113.7 m, width of 16.3 m and draft of 6.25 m. The ship was driven by two triple- cylinder vertical triple expansion steam engines, supplied by 8 coal-fired boilers, which moved a pair of propellers. The engines reached 8000 horsepower, giving a top speed of 18.5 knots. The normal stockpile of coal was 550 tons, and at maximum capacity the ship could take almost twice as much fuel at 1075 tons. The initial crew of the ship consisted of 393 officers and sailors. The cruiser was initially armed with five single-arm 152 mm (6 inch ) guns, six 120 mm (4.7 inch) guns, six three-pound (47 mm) guns, and three 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes. After the modernization of 1903-1905, the armament of the ship was as follows: eleven 152 mm guns, nine twelve-pound guns (76 mm), seven three-pound guns (47 mm) and three 450 mm torpedo launchers. During the First World War, the armament was limited to nine 152 mm guns, four 76 mm guns and one 47 mm gun, leaving torpedo armament unchanged. The deck armor had a thickness of 38 to 76 mm (1.5 to 3 inches) with the command tower having a thickness up to 152 mm. Main artillery pieces were protected by 76 mm thick casings. Service history One of Doris' guns on the march to Bloemfontein Under the command of Captain R. C. Prothero, she was flagship of Vice-Admiral Sir Robert Harris when he was Commander-in-Chief, Cape of Good Hope Station in South Africa 1898-1900. In 1899 at least one of HMS Doriss QF guns was mounted on an improvised field carriage and used as a field gun in the Second Boer War. The gun used at Magersfontein was known as Joe Chamberlain. Captain Prothero, known as 'Prothero the Bad', was a man of violent temper who terrified his officers and crew alike. She paid off at Devonport in May 1901, when, to honour her crew, the men of the other ships in the harbour spontaneously manned yards and sides and gave a salute. After a refit, she was on 4 June 1902 commissioned into the Channel Squadron with the crew of HMS Arrogant. Captain Frederick Robert William Morgan was appointed in command. She took part in the fleet review held at Spithead on 16 August 1902 for the coronation of King Edward VII, and visited Souda Bay, Crete for combined maneuvers with other ships of the Channel and Cruiser squadrons the following month. In October she visited Tetouan. In April 1911 she was on station with the Atlantic Fleet at Gibraltar under the command of Captain Michael Henry Hodges.CENSUS OF ENGLAND AND WALES, 1911 - Enumeration Book for the Royal Navy - His Majesty's Ship \\"Doris\\". First World War When the First World War began in August 1914, Doris was serving with the 11th Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet, and her Captain was Frank LarkenUsborne 1933, pp. 19‚Äì20. On 5 August, Doris captured a German merchant ship.Gardiner & Gray, p. 15 By November 1914, Doris was cruising off the West Coast of Ireland. On 7th of that month she was ordered to proceed to Alexandria to form part of the Allied force opposing Turkey. She was ordered to patrol the Syrian coast, looking out for enemy ships and shore installations, and to \\"exercise general pressure.\\" On 15 December Doris was lying off the Syrian coast near Beersheba when she spotted suspicious activity on a bluff commanding the shore. Closing in, her crew discovered it was a Turkish defensive position in the course of construction, and Captain Larken gave orders to open fire with one of the ship's main guns. The emplacement was swiftly destroyed.Usborne 1933, pp. 22‚Äì23. From Beersheba, Doris proceeded to the Gulf of Alexandretta, where she landed shore parties to disrupt Turkish communication lines, destroying telegraph lines and railway tracks. Anchoring off the harbour of Alexandretta, Larken sent word to the Military Governor of the town demanding that \\"All munitions of war, mines and locomotives\\" be handed over to his crew to be destroyed, and that all British and Allied subjects be surrendered to him, along with their families and effects.Usborne 1933, p. 29. Failure to comply would result in the town being shelled. The Governor communicated with Djemal Pasha, Military Commander of Greater Syria, who was not a man to be intimidated. Not only did Djemal Pasha refuse the demands, but he threatened that, if Larken opened fire on Alexandretta, one British captive would be shot for every Ottoman subject killed in the bombardment.Usborne 1933, pp. 31‚Äì32. In the event, negotiations were carried out through the American Consul in Alexandretta, and the Turks took the opportunity to evacuate all military stores and equipment from the town, before two railway locomotives were destroyed in a token gesture.Usborne 1933, pp. 39‚Äì42. Doris continued to patrol the Syrian coast until March 1915, carrying out thirteen landing operations and many coastal bombardments before being relieved by the French.Usborne 1933, p. 47. On 25 April 1915, Doris participated in a shore bombardment near Bulair along the western coast of the Gallipoli peninsula, intended as a diversionary feint for the main troop landings at Cape Helles area. From March 1917 to November 1918, she was stationed in India, where she served as a hulk. Doris was sold on February 2, 1919 in Mumbai.

He was re-elected at each subsequent election, holding the seat until his death. In parliament he was a committed advocate of the temperance movement and sought reform of the alcohol licensing laws. This led to his appointment as a member of the Royal Commission on Licensing of 1896‚Äì1899. Outside parliament Whittaker continued to have a number business interests including being chairman and managing director of the Life Assurance Institution. He was knighted in 1906, and appointed to the privy council in 1908. He found himself criticising his own party's budget in 1909 as he felt the taxation measures would erode the savings of many small investors in industrial and provident societies. He was appointed the chairman of the Select Committee on Parliamentary Procedure in 1914, immediately prior to World War I.

He served as Prefect of the Apostolic Signatura from 1954 until his death, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1953 by Pope Pius XII. To date, he and his brother, Amleto Giovanni Cicognani, are the last pair of brothers to serve simultaneously in the College of Cardinals. Coat of arms of Gaetano Cicognani Biography Cicognani was born in Brisighella to Guglielmo Cicognani and his wife Anna Ceroni. His brother, Amleto, was born over a year later in 1883. To support Gaetano and his brother, their widowed mother ran a general store.Time Magazine. The Vatican's No. 2 August 25, 1961 Cicognani studied at the seminary in Faenza, and was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Gioacchino Cantagalli on 24 September 1904. He then went to Rome to attend the Pontifical Roman Athenaeum S. Apollinare and was, like his brother, summoned to the elite Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy. After working in the Roman Rota and Apostolic Signatura, Cicognani taught at the Pontifical Roman Seminary and later entered the Secretariat of State in 1915. He became secretary of the Spanish nunciature on 1 February 1916, and a Privy Chamberlain of His Holiness on 9 March 1916. He was made auditor of the nunciature to Belgium on 3 February 1920. On 10 January 1925 Cicognani was appointed Apostolic Internuncio to Bolivia and Titular Archbishop of Ancyra. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 1 February from Cardinal Pietro Gasparri, with Archbishops Rafaello Rossi, OCD, and Giovanni Zonghi serving as co-consecrators, in the chapel of the Pontifical Collegio Pio-Latinoamericano in Rome. Archbishop Cicognani was later named Apostolic Nuncio to Peru on 15 June 1928, to Austria on 13 June 1936, and to Spain on 16 May 1938. In April 1934, when Nuncio to Peru, he visited his brother, the Apostolic Delegate to the United States, whom Gaetano had not seen in seven years.TIME Magazine. In the Churches April 30, 1934 Pope Pius XII created him Cardinal-Priest of Santa Cecilia in his second and last consistory of 12 January 1953. Cardinal Cicognani returned to work in the Roman Curia upon his appointment as Prefect of the Congregation of Rites on 7 December of that same year. He was appointed as prefect of the Apostolic Signatura on 18 November 1954 and was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 1958 papal conclave that selected Pope John XXIII. That December, his brother, Amleto, by a special dispensation of canon law, was also elevated to the College of Cardinals. This law had so distressed Gaetano, as he felt it curbed his brother's career, that he once came close to tears when someone jokingly said \\"Because of you, your brother cannot become cardinal\\". On 14 December 1959 he was named Cardinal Bishop of Frascati by Pope John. He died in Rome, at age 80, and is buried in the collegiate church of S. Michele in his native Brisighella.

He currently resides in the United States, where he is a visiting research scholar at Princeton University. Early life and education Mousavian was born in 1957 to a prosperous carpet-dealing family in Kashan, a major carpet-manufacturing center. His family had close ties to the Motalefeh, a religiously oriented revolutionary movement that dated back to the early 1960s and was eventually absorbed into the Islamic Republican Party (IRP). Mousavian studied at the Iran University of Science and Technology, as well as Sacramento City College and Sacramento State University in the United States. In 1981 he was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering from Sacramento State University of California. He was awarded an MA in International Relations from the University of Tehran in 1998 and a PhD in International Relations from the University of Kent at Canterbury in 2002. Early career in Iran Reuel Marc Gerecht of The Weekly Standard has speculated that Mousavian's father's connections in Motalefeh helped him win access to leading IRP figures, and led to his being named editor-in-chief of the Tehran Times, the revolution's English-language newspaper, which was established by IRP founder Mohammad Hosseini Beheshti. During his editorial tenure, from 1980 to 1990, Mousavian authored more than 2,000 articles. He also held a number of positions in the Iranian government in the 1980s, including a stint as Vice President of the Islamic Propagation Organization (1981‚Äì1983), worked with future-President Hashemi Rafsanjani as Chairman of the Parliament Administration Organization (1983‚Äì1986), and was Head and then Director General of the West Europe department of the Foreign Ministry (1986‚Äì1989). During the 1980s, Mousavian played a major role in what he later described, in a 2012 book, as ‚ÄúIran's humanitarian intervention to secure the release of Western hostages in Lebanon.‚Äù However, the hostage- takers (Hezbollah), had acted on instructions from the government in Tehran. Ambassador to Germany Mousavian was Iran's Ambassador to Germany from 1990 to 1997. Four Iranian dissidents were murdered at Berlin's Mykonos restaurant in 1992, and five years later a German court concluded that Iran's Special Affairs Committee had ordered the murders, and that the supreme leader, president, foreign minister and intelligence minister of Iran were all active members of that committee. The court found an Iranian intelligence officer and three Lebanese men guilty and issued an arrest warrant for Iran's intelligence minister. Also, Germany expelled four Iranian diplomats and asked that Mousavian be recalled to Iran; he did return to Tehran shortly thereafter. After the issuance of the arrest warrant for the intelligence minister, which Mousavian described as an insult to the entire population of Iran, Iranian news agencies made veiled threats against Germans abroad. Mousavian echoed, saying that if European nations kept treating Iran as America and Israel did, then they would be treated the same way by Iran. It was also during Mousavian's ambassadorial tenure that the Salman Rushdie affair took place, and Mousavian went on German radio to announce that Iran would not lift its fatwa against the writer. In the same interview, he expressed skepticism that Germany would risk its trade relations with Iran by protesting the Rushdie fatwa. Because of this statement, Social Democratic politician Freimut Duve called for Mousavian's expulsion, saying that he had, in effect, publicly expressed agreement with the fatwa; politicians from other parties echoed Duve's call. The German Foreign Ministry, moreover, summoned Mousavian to a meeting. Return to Iran Subsequently, he headed the Foreign Relations Committee of the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) of Iran during the eight years of Mohammad Khatami's presidency. Mousavian meanwhile continued his education in the late 1990s, receiving a master's degree from the University of Tehran in 1998 and a PhD from the University of Kent in the UK in international relations in 2002. He later served as Foreign Policy Advisor to Ali Larijani, Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council (2005-7), and Vice President of the Center for Strategic Research and in a variety of capacities for the Expediency Discernment Council's Center for Strategic Research (CSR) from 2005 to 2008. During this period he was Editor-in-Chief or a member of the Editorial Board for numerous CSR publications, including the Journal of Human Rights Studies, Journal of International Security and Terrorism, Rahbord (Strategy) Magazine, and Journal of Disarmament. Role in Iranian diplomacy Mousavian played a role in a number of key developments during his more than two decades working on Iranian foreign affairs. He helped to secure the release of two German hostages held by Hezbollah in Lebanon from 1990 to 1993 and American and other Western hostages held in Lebanon in 1998‚Äì1999, as well as contributing to the mediation of the largest-ever humanitarian exchange between Israel and Lebanese Hezbollah under Germany's auspices (1995‚Äì1996). Mousavian also played a role in Iran's cooperation with the US in Afghanistan against Al Qaeda and the Taliban in 2001. From 2003 to 2005, Mousavian was Spokesman of the Iranian nuclear negotiation team, which in 2003 agreed for Iran to provisionally suspend uranium enrichment and allow inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency at its nuclear sites as confidence building measures. In 2004, while head of the negotiating team, Mousavian asserted Iran's sovereign right to pursue nuclear technology for civilian use and expressed satisfaction that the U.S. had been ‚Äúisolated‚Äù at the IAEA in its attempt to pressure Iran. Mousavian's team was replaced shortly before the election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as President in 2005, in tandem with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei's announcement that Iran would resume enrichment activities. Accusations of espionage Mousavian was arrested and briefly jailed by the Ahmadinejad administration in 2007 and publicly accused by the president of espionage for allegedly providing classified information to Europeans, including the British Embassy, before being cleared by the judiciary. There was speculation that his arrest was part of a factional struggle between Ahmadinejad and a triumvirate of his opponents: Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Mohammad Khatami, and Hassan Rouhani, of whom Mousavian was considered an ally. After a year, a spokesman of Iran's judiciary announced that Mousavian had been cleared of the espionage charge after an investigation by three different judges. However, the third of those judges had sentenced him to a suspended term of two years in prison and to a five-year ban from holding official diplomatic posts because of his confessed opposition to the foreign and nuclear policy of President Ahmadinejad. Accusations were renewed on August 22, 2010, when the Ministry of Intelligence issued a statement repeating the old claims publicly announced by Ahmadinejad in 2007. Mousavian's lawyer has questioned this development, arguing that the Ministry of Intelligence statement ran contrary to the verdict reached three years earlier by the Iranian judiciary. Post at Princeton and controversy Dr Patricia Lewis, Sir Richard Dalton, Dr Seyed Hossein Mousavian (left to right) at the Chatham House event Nuclear Iran: Negotiating a Way Out. Mousavian has been a visiting research scholar at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs since 2009. Writing in the Weekly Standard in September 2012, Reuel Marc Gerecht argued that Mousavian's Western admirers, who see him as ‚Äúa guide to a possible resolution‚Äù of the Iran crisis, ‚Äúhave been as na√Øve as he has been deceitful.... To journalists and American officials, he has tried with conviction to make the case for Tehran‚Äôs 'peaceful' nuclear program. For him, the Iranian regime is 'misunderstood,' and the West, even under President Obama, has been too hostile and suspicious. Sufficient Western concessions and greater Western sensitivity are the keys to solving the nuclear contretemps.‚Äù Mousavian's ‚Äúassertions that Khamenei‚Äôs intent isn‚Äôt threatening,‚Äù noted Gerecht, ‚Äúare followed by hints that a bomb might, nonetheless, be logical for the Islamic Republic to develop, especially given the threatening behavior of the United States and Israel.‚Äù Gerecht further pointed out that Mousavian, in his writings and talks, is consistently ‚Äúrespectful towards Supreme Leader Khamenei.‚Äù Gerecht noted that \\"Mousavian at times claims to know a lot about Iran‚Äôs nuclear program, and then, when accusations from the IAEA are too cutting, not much at all.\\" For example, \\"Mousavian knew not a thing\\" about the uranium-enrichment facility at Fordow until President Obama's press conference about it. Citing Mousavian's expression of trust in \\"the supreme leader‚Äôs fatwa banning the use or production of nuclear weapons,\\" Gerecht observes wryly that \\"Mousavian is putting his trust in the man who demolished his world, incarcerated him, and forced him and his family into exile. It would be easy to say that Mousavian is just lying‚Äîand he is. But what is more intriguing is how hard it is for him to reflect critically on the revolution. In his eyes still, Iran‚Äôs faults are mostly American in origin‚Äîor tactical mistakes made by his archenemy, Ahmadinejad. Like battered Communists of old who just couldn‚Äôt stop loving the Soviet Union, Mousavian remains a party apparatchik who still loves the cause....There isn‚Äôt a word, even from the safety of Princeton, about the dark side of Khamenei and his Revolutionary Guards‚Äô having the bomb. Little men like Mousavian‚Äîideologues whose identities were created by the revolution‚Äîjust can't flip.\\" Current views Mousavian expressed deep concern about developments in Iran after that country's 2009 presidential election, but continued \\"to press for the U.S. to engage Tehran in a bid to reduce regional tensions,\\" according to a 2010 article by Jay Solomon in the Wall Street Journal. Mousavian believes that any future Iranian government will continue to pursue a nuclear fuel program, and that the U.S. should therefore improve relations with Tehran as a safeguard against an atomic weapons program. He also opposes UN sanctions against Iran, saying they \\"only serve to radicalize [Tehran‚Äôs] position.\\" Instead of imposing sanctions, the U.S. should \\"shape a comprehensive dialogue with Iran based on shared interests in stabilizing Iraq and Afghanistan\\" and \\"should develop with Tehran a broad security plan for the Persian Gulf that could prove crucial to securing the free flow of energy in and out of the strategic waterway.\\" Mousavian dismissed as \\"politically motivated\\" the conclusions of a November 2011 report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that suggested \\"possible military dimensions\\" to Iran's nuclear program. Writing in National Interest in December 2012, Mousavian questioned the assumption by Western powers that \\"the best hope of altering Tehran‚Äôs nuclear policy and halting its enrichment activities\\" lies in \\"comprehensive international sanctions and a credible threat of military strike.\\" Mousavian maintained that \\"such punitive pressures... will not change the Iranian leadership‚Äôs mindset, and that a military option would be catastrophic\\" for everyone. Besides, he insisted, Iran has no interest in acquiring nuclear weapons. He offered ten reasons why this is the case, among them that developing nuclear weaponry would be considered \\"forbidden or haram\\" under Islam, would \\"trigger a regional nuclear arms race,\\" and would be contrary to Iran's goal of becoming a modern nation. In another December 2012 article, Mousavian argued that \\"U.S. strategists... should understand... the role of religion and clerics\\" in Iran. Noting that the world's \\"most powerful ideological-political party... is the Shia Cleric Organization in Iran,\\" he complained that \\"Western policymakers and some of their 'Iranian experts'... have yet to realize that the clerical system... is a collective decision- making process, with heated discussions and debates among about twenty of the most revered Grand Ayatollahs in the country.\\" Washington, he emphasized, \\"needs to recognize that Islam is the main source of Iranian power, and the religious establishments will play a key role in the future developments of Iran and the region....Instead of changing Iran's government, the United States should focus its regional policy on three key areas: addressing the Palestinian issue, engaging moderate Islamists, and pursuing a regional security pact.\\" In a January 2013 New York Times op-ed headlined \\"How to Talk to Iran,\\" Mousavian and Mohammed Ali Shabani argued that there will be no ‚Äúresolution of the nuclear standoff‚Äù between Iran and the West if Western leaders fail to grasp two key concepts: \\"maslahat,\\" meaning \\"expediency, or self-interest\\" and \\"aberu,\\" meaning \\"face ‚Äì as in, saving face.\\" For millennia, they wrote, \\"Persian culture has been distinguished by customs that revolve around honor and esteem....There are almost no instances in modern Iranian history when maslahat has trumped aberu. The West has poorly understood these concepts. This was particularly true under President Bush, who rewarded Iran‚Äôs tacit acceptance of the American invasion of Afghanistan by labeling Iran a member of an 'axis of evil.'\\" Mousavian and Shabani expressed the belief that \\"Iran would be open to new measures regarding the transparency of its nuclear program, and would agree not to pursue any capability to enrich uranium beyond that needed to fuel atomic power plants, if its legitimate right to enrichment under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty was recognized and if an agreement to remove sanctions was reached.\\" Mousavian is a member of the International Panel on Fissile Materials, an organisation which works to end the production and use of enriched uranium and plutonium. Nuclear Iran: Negotiating a Way Out. Iranian Nuclear Crisis: A Memoir Reviewing Mousavian's 2012 book, Iranian Nuclear Crisis: A Memoir in the Wall Street Journal, Sohrab Ahmari said that although the book ‚Äúis billed as a memoir,‚Äù it is more of ‚Äúa diplomatic brief, complete with awkward bureaucratic prose and key sections stippled by bullet points.‚Äù Ahmari drew attention to ‚Äúthe endnotes, where an editor apparently felt obliged to acknowledge where the author parts company with the public record,‚Äù as in an assertion that Iran had fully disclosed the details of its nuclear activities to the IAEA.

Biography  Early life  Born Heywood Fisher Kling in New York City, Kling was the son of Mayme and Ken Kling. Ken was a cartoonist for the New York Daily Mirror, predicting the horse races in his strip Joe and Asbestos. Woody Kling was given the middle name Fisher in tribute to Ken Kling's friend Bud Fisher, who created the first successful daily comic strip in the United States. Career In the 1940s, Ken and Mayme Kling hosted celebrity parties at their home at The Eldorado building in New York City. At one of those parties, Woody Kling, then only in his 20s, met the vaudeville star Milton Berle. Berle told a joke, at which Kling did not laugh. When questioned by Berle as to what was wrong, Kling said the joke wasn't told in the right way, and retold it in his own style. Upon Kling receiving the laughs of the entire party, Berle hired Kling on the spot to produce, head write and create the theme song for a new television show in which Berle would be starring. Called The Texaco Star Theatre Starring Milton Berle, the show was created by Berle, produced live before a New York audience on kinescopes owned by Berle, but with the scripts and music owned by Kling. The show's theme song was the broadcasting creation of the modern jingle. The theme song, called \\"We Are the Men of Texaco\\", and written by Kling and Buddy Arnold, was the first time that a television program used music to promote a commercial advertiser's product. In the decades that followed, \\"We are the Men of Texaco\\" and the way it was staged ‚Äì sung by four gas station attendants (Kling's idea) ‚Äì was licensed by Kling's heirs to filmmakers wishing to depict the impact of television's advent on the American family (like Barry Levinson's 1990s film Avalon). The song also served as Milton Berle's theme for personal appearances. In 1979, Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi and Garret Morris recreated Kling's staging and sung \\"We Are the Men of Texaco\\" live on Saturday Night Live in honor of Berle, its host that week. The song's lyrics were quoted in obituaries of Berle. 1950s to 1960s Kling soon became the head writer on a number of television shows like The Jack Parr Show, The Will Rogers, Jr. Show, and The Red Buttons Show. He additionally created and wrote several dozen cartoon programs at Hal Seeger Studios. In 1968, Kling was producer of the program Wedding Party. Thereafter, he became head writer on The Jackie Gleason Show in Palm Beach, Florida. The hit show for Gleason became the first hit television shows to be broadcast from Florida. Finally, in late 1969, Kling moved to Hollywood, California where he wrote for Joseph Barbera the filmed television show Love, American Style. 1970s Kling thereafter was quickly hired for The Carol Burnett Show where he became head writer. While on Burnett, producer Norman Lear offered Kling the position of head writer on a new emerging show called All in the Family. Ironically, Lear had offered the starring role in the show to Kling's previous star Gleason, and then to Mickey Rooney, who 12 months later toured the country with a play written by Kling. Under Kling, All in the Family became a huge hit for CBS and Lear. Kling drew some of the show's most memorable episodes from his personal life. They included the February 23, 1976 episode \\"Joey's Baptism\\" in which Archie Bunker's baptizing his grandson (against the wishes of agnostic parents Mike and Gloria), which Kling, who was born atheist, based upon the baptism of his son Anthony at the time. In less than half a decade, Burnett and All in the Family brought Kling seven Emmy nominations, and two Emmy Awards. Kling helped create the introduction of the spin-off The Jeffersons, and wrote or head wrote other Lear shows Maude, Good Times, and Sanford Arms among others while turning down other Lear shows like One Day at a Time. Playwright In the early 1970s, Kling wrote the play Three Goats and a Blanket (Stop Thief Stop or Alimony). Over the next decade, the show, touring with Mickey Rooney, became the highest grossing play to never reach Broadway. Cartoons Between television film shows, Kling reunited with and wrote for Joe Barbera a series of cartoon series including Casper the Friendly Ghost and the Harlem Globetrotters. In 1983, he created and wrote the series The Littles and thereafter wrote the syndicated special Cabbage Patch Kids First Christmas. In the 1980s, Kling wrote and created the program Rainbow Brite that he licensed, solely for television syndication broadcast only. After Kling's death, his heirs sued Hallmark Cards, for copyright infringement of Kling's property alleging that Hallmark had stolen Kling's property making Hallmark over $1 billion during his illness and thereafter. Kling's case went up on appeal twice to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in California. In the first appeal (Kling v. Hallmark), Kling's heir won. The court found against Hallmark, ruling Kling's case was not barred by laches, becoming the leading decision on laches still today of the Court. In a second appeal (Kling v. Hallmark), the 9th Circuit found for Kling's heir, ruling Kling's heir to be the copyright owner of Woody Kling's Rainbow Brite works, but found Kling's damages to be barred by the statute of limitations, awarding Klings' heirs no money. Death Shortly after creating Rainbow Brite, Kling became ill with inoperable brain and lung cancer, eventually dying in Los Angeles on April 10, 1988. He was survived by his wife Mary, and his son Anthony.

Furbeck House is a house located in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Illinois, United States. The house was designed by famous American architect Frank Lloyd Wright in 1897 and constructed for Chicago electrical contractor George W. Furbeck and his new bride Sue Allin Harrington. The home's interior is much as it appeared when the house was completed but the exterior has seen some alteration. The house is an important example of Frank Lloyd Wright's transitional period of the late 1890s which culminated with the birth of the first fully mature early modern Prairie style house. The Furbeck House was listed as a contributing property to a U.S. federal Registered Historic District in 1973 and declared a local Oak Park Landmark in 2002. History George Furbeck's father, Warren, purchased the future site of the George W. Furbeck House in 1892. Furbeck was working as an electrical contractor in Chicago at the time and maintained a residence with his parents. On April 9, 1897 the Oak Park Reporter announced that George Furbeck would be erecting a Frank Lloyd Wright designed home on the site his father had purchased five years earlier. The site of the Furbeck home provided George Furbeck with easy access to the Oak Park Avenue train station and thus, to his office in Chicago. On June 29, 1897, two weeks after ground was broken on his new home, Furbeck married Sue Allin Harrington of Michigan. The next day Warren Furbeck's deed for the site of the George Furbeck House was transferred to his son. The George Furbeck House was completed in late 1897 or early 1898.Oak Park Landmark Nomination Form, pg. 4-5. Entire paragraph referenced. The home's interior has seen very little alteration and is mostly intact as Wright originally envisioned it. The exterior underwent significant alteration in 1920 when the enclosed brick front porch was built on the retaining wall that surrounded the original, smaller, open porch. The third floor dormer was also extended as well.\\"George W. Furbeck House,\\" Oak Park Tourist, excerpted from: Sprague, Paul E.

Retrieved May 31, 2007. Architecture The house was designed at the beginning of Wright's three-year period of experimentation that resulted in the fully mature Prairie house in the early 20th century with such projects as the Arthur Heurtley House and the Frank Thomas House, both in Oak Park. It combines elements from the traditional Queen Anne style and from Wright's own Prairie style, as such the home represents a transition by Wright toward early modern style. The home's windows are wood with wooden frames and mostly casement style, most of the first floor windows are topped with plain gray limestone lintels. Some of the casement windows feature original art glass with simple geometric designs.Oak Park Landmark Nomination Form, pg. 6. The art glass, which is one of Wright's earliest completely original designs of the type, features three vertical lines with simple colored borders. When compared with the art glass on the Isidore Heller House, designed the same year, the Furbeck glass is uninteresting and may represent the start of Wright's glass border art work.Heinz, Thomas A. Frank Lloyd Wright's Stained Glass & Lightscreens, (Google Books), Gibbs Smith, 2005, pg. 43, (). Retrieved 9 June 2007. Beneath the first and second floor windows a continuous stone sill course wraps around the house. The front (east) elevation is framed by two octagonal towers and the entire structure is clad in a pink-colored brick. The building's hip roof features overhanging eaves, an element common to Prairie style architecture. The entire structure rests upon a stepped, limestone water table. The main feature of the front facade, besides the octagonal towers, is the 20 ft (6.10 m) X 20 ft, one-story sun porch projecting from the building. The sun porch has a low-pitched hip roof with an eave that projects over the front door, which is centered on the porch and flanked by two pairs of casement windows. Above the sun porch, on the second floor, is a pair of art glass doors which open onto a balcony between the two octagonal towers.

Built in Floirac, France in 1893 its lenses were focused between +11 and +17 degrees declination. Until 1970 it had taken over 4,000 photographic plates.The Bordeaux Observatory Bordeaux Observatory is home to a large collection of instruments and archives from well over a century of astronomical activities. Until the 2016 it was actively used until the institution moved to a new location at the University. In the French language the name is Observatoire de Bordeaux. Early history In the late 18th century an attempt to establish Bordeaux Observatory wad made after the Transit of Venus. This led to a house being set aside as the Bordeaux Observatory, however, it was not equipped with any instruments. Although it did not really get established, it carried the banner of desire for real observatory in the area for a century. Finally, in 1876 an agreement between Government and the city was reached to establish a real observatory. The Government was trying to execute on a national agenda of increased education, and this nexused with city's desire for an Observatory; Bordeaxu would contribute 100,000 francs for its founding. It was founded in 1879 on a hill overlooking the Garonne river. The Bordeaux observatory was established in the late 1870s, and one of its first instruments was a Meridian circle. The instrument was built by Eichens with and glass objective of 19 cm by Henry. Also, an equatorial mounted refractor (glass lens) with 38 cm lens. The objective lens was made by Merz, and the mounting was done by Gautier and Eichens. Also a 13-inch (32 cm) aperture astrograph in support of the Carte du Ceil project. On founding, the observatory had the following areas of study: * Magnetic and meteorological observations * Meridian observationsthis had to do mostly with star positions) * Equatorial observations observations with the telescopes such as of comets, asteroids, moons of the Solar system, and stars * Computations such as for publications of meteorological catalogs Early work with the Meridian included updates to the Argelander-√ñltzen star catalog. 1900s In the late 20th century Bordeaux Observatory became active in field of radio astronomy. In 1967 the construction of millimeter wave interferometer was begun, in conjunction with others. Between 1983 and 1988, the automatic meridian circle of Bordeaux Observatory was used in support of the Hipparcos space observatory. The success of that space mission was on factor leading to demise of the utility of automatic meridian circles, because of the extreme accuracy achieved by Hipparcos for that time period. In 1990 a microwave radiometer for measuring ozone was established at the Observatory. In 1999, Bordeaux Observatory became a site for IVS.  2000s  In early 21st century it remained the site for the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique of Bordeaux, but that institution planned to move out from the site. In 2016, an astronomer of Bordeaux Observatory noted on a possible formation mechanism for \\"Planet Nine\\", a hypothesized planet beyond the Kuiper belt in the 2010s. In a simulation of solar system formation, they suggested that it could be leftover building block of an earlier time. As an institution the Bordeaux Observatory became the Observatoire Aquitain des Sciences de l‚ÄôUnivers (OASU).

He wrote music for the series, including its video games. Born in Tokyo, Arisawa began to learn piano at the age of 20. After graduating from Senzoku Gakuen College, Arisawa started his career in 1980 by composing \\"Shinjuku Transfer\\". He worked for the Tokyo Broadcasting System and wrote several TV dramas. From the 1990s until his death, Arisawa began composing for anime series exclusively. His work on Sailor Moon was initially based on pop music, but gradually began to change to those found in classical music. Sailor Moon was successful and Arisawa won several awards for his work. After Sailor Moon, Arisawa composed music for several shows, including the Digimon series, until his death from bladder cancer in 2005. Biography Arisawa was mostly self-taught, having been interested in music from childhood. He started to learn piano when he was 20 years old, and entered Senzoku Gakuen College when he was 22, eventually graduating with degrees in Composing and Orchestral Music. He studied jazz and pop arrangement with arranger Norio Maeda. In 1980, Arisawa's song \\"Shinjuku Transfer\\" was recorded by the chorus group SOAP for Epic/Sony Records. He released a full album the following year, \\"Hamot Pier,\\" and received the New Composer Incentive Award at the 1981 Tokyo Music Festival. The group broke up in 1982, but \\"Hamot Pier\\" was re-released in 1993. During the 1980s Arisawa worked as a composer and arranger for Tokyo Broadcasting System and wrote music for television commercials, including Coca-Cola advertisements. He also composed for various TV dramas, and released a single, \\"Takeoff of Love\\", for Japan Airlines' 30th anniversary celebration. He later served as Music Director for the NHK series Let's Learn English!. As the Music Director for Sailor Moon, Arisawa's first award was the 1993 Golden Disk Grand Prize from Columbia Records. He continued to compose for the entire anime series, plus several video games and some of the stage musicals. In 1998, 2000, and 2001 he won the JASRAC International Award for most international royalties, owing largely to the popularity of Sailor Moon music in other nations. Arisawa expressed an admiration of Hollywood-style music, drawing his initial inspiration for the tone of the Sailor Moon soundtrack from the Charlie's Angels TV series.

He was known by the courtesy title of Lord Newbattle until 1692, when he succeeded as Lord Jedburgh, then as Marquess of Lothian when his father died in 1703. Life Robert Kerr William Kerr was born in 1661, eldest son of Robert Kerr, 1st Marquess of Lothian (1636-1703) and his wife, Jean Campbell (d. 1700), daughter of Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll. Through their relationship with Argyll, the family was closely associated with Presbyterian and Whig interests and supported the 1688 Glorious Revolution. Little is known of his early life but in June 1685, he married his cousin Lady Jean Campbell (1661-1712), third daughter of 9th Earl of Argyll, who was executed after the failed Argyll's Rising in June 1685. They had a son, William, 3rd Marquess of Lothian (1690-1767) and four daughters, Anne (died 1727), Jean (died March 1768), Elizabeth (died May 1758) and Mary (died 1768). Career Under the title 'Lord Newbattle,' Kerr served as a Commissioner of Supply in 1685 and 1686 but his family's links to Argyll meant they were out of favour during the reign of James II & VII. Under William and Mary, he was Captain of an Independent Troop of Horse, ten of which were raised in April 1689 as a short-term response to the 1689-1691 Jacobite Rising. In 1691, these were re-organised as two regiments, Cunningham's Regiment, later 7th Dragoons and Lord Jedburgh's Dragoons, after Kerr inherited the title of Lord Jedburgh in 1692. He sat under this name in the Parliament of Scotland until its dissolution in 1707. Duke of Argyll, 1680-1743 Until 1694, when Richard Cunningham's regiment transferred to Flanders, these units were used for internal security and funded by the Scottish Parliament. After Cunningham was promoted Brigadier General, Jedburgh became Colonel of the 7th Dragoons in October 1696, but by now the Nine Years War was effectively over. Since regiments were named after their Colonel, for a few months there were two known as 'Lord Jedburgh's Dragoons;' the Scottish one was disbanded in October 1697, after the Treaty of Ryswick. Until the 1868 Cardwell Reforms, commissions were private assets that could be bought or sold and did not require actual service. Though less common as soldiering became more professional, some Colonels remained civilians who delegated their duties to a subordinate. Jedburgh seems to have been one of these, as he has no record of active service, unlike his brothers Lord Mark Kerr and Lord John Kerr, who both commanded regiments of their own. Despite this, he was promoted Brigadier when the War of the Spanish Succession began in 1702, while his father was created Marquess of Lothian and nominated a Commissioner for the proposed Union with England. He succeeded his father as Marquess after his death in 1703, was appointed Major General in 1704 and closely associated with his nephew, the 2nd Duke of Argyll in negotiations for the Acts of Union. In return, he was created a Knight of the Thistle in 1705 but lost influence when Argyll was replaced by the Duke of Queensberry as Lord High Commissioner. In a summary of Scottish politicians prepared in 1704, the government agent John Macky described him as follows; \\"He hath abundance of fire, and may prove himself a man of business when he applies himself that way; laughs at all revealed religion, yet sets up for a pillar of Presbytery, and proves the surest card in their pack, being very zealous though not devout; he is brave in his person, loves his country and his bottle, a thorough libertine, very handsome, black, with a fine eye, forty-five years old.\\" When George Ramsay, Commander-in-Chief, Scotland and Colonel of the Scots Regiment of Foot Guards died in September 1705, Lothian wanted to replace him in both positions. However, the Earl of Leven became C-in-C instead while he was not appointed Colonel until April 1707. He supported the Union and due to his connections with Argyll, was appointed Lieutenant General in 1708 and elected as one of the 16 Scottish Representative Peers for 1707 and 1708. However, he was removed from the House of Lords in 1709 after the vote was challenged, while the Tory landslide victory in the 1710 General Election meant the loss of his positions, including his Colonelcy in 1713. Although restored to the Lords after the accession of George I in 1715, he played little active part in politics; he died in 1722 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.

There are some mistakes in this text: see Felbick, 2012, p. 36 f. Education His first teacher was N. M√ºller, a minister from Obersulzbach, from whom Mizler learned the flute and violin.Felbick 2012, p. 175. From 1724 to 1730, Mizler studied at the Ansbach Gymnasium with Rector Oeder and Johann Matthias Gesner, who became director of the Thomasschule zu Leipzig from 1731 to 1734. He enrolled at Leipzig University on 30 April 1731, where he studied theology. His teachers there included Gesner, Johann Christoph Gottsched, and Christian Wolff. He earned a BS in December 1733 and a MS in March 1734. During this time, he also pursued the study of composition, and had some association with Johann Sebastian Bach, whom, he wrote, he had the honor to call his \\"good friend and patron.\\"Felbick 2012, p. 432 Mizler moved to Wittenberg in 1735 to study law and medicine; returning to Leipzig in 1736.Felbick 2012, p. 176 Career From May 1737, Mizler began lecturing on music history and Johann Mattheson's Neu-er√∂ffnete Orchestre (Newly Published Orchestra) he was the first to lecture on music at a German university in 150 years. He also began a monthly publication, the Neu er√∂ffnete musikalische Bibliothek (Newly Published Musical Library) in 1738Note: it became the periodical of his newly founded, Korrespondierenden Soziet√§t der Musicalischen Wissenschaften, which had the support of Count Giacomo de Lucchesini s well as G.H. B√ºmler, the Ansbach court Kapellmeister. At about this time, Mizler began a music publishing business; and he returned school to take a doctorate of medicine at Erfurt University in 1747. Move to Poland In 1743 he left Leipzig and settled permanently in Poland. Mitzler de Kolof (his nom de guerre in Poland) became secretary, teacher, librarian and court mathematician to Count Ma≈Çachowski of Ko≈Ñskie, from whom he learned Polish and with whom he studied Polish history and literature.Felbick 2012, p. 361ff. In 1747 Mizler moved to Warsaw. Mitzler also began a medical practice, which included consulting as a court physician to King August III. When he became court physician, this afforded him time to study the natural sciences. He established the publishing house 'Mizlerischer B√ºcherverlag, Warschau und Leipzig' in 1754. Honors Mitzler became a member of the Erfurt Academy of Sciences in 1755, and received Polish nobility in 1768.Felbick, 2012, p. 329. Publisher In association with the Za≈Çuski Library, Mitzler published and edited Poland's first scientific periodicals: Warschauer Bibliothek (1753‚Äì55), Acta Litteraria... (1755‚Äì56), Nowe Wiadomo≈õci Ekonomiczne i Uczone (Economic and Learned News, 1758‚Äì61 and 1766‚Äì67). From 1765 he published the Monitor (1765‚Äì85), which had been founded at the initiative of King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski,Monitor; Encyklopedia Polski (Encyclopedia of Poland); p. 422. in 1773‚Äì77 as its editor. In 1756 he set up a printing establishment, which in 1768 he conveyed (together with a type foundry) to Warsaw's Corps of Cadets, while retaining the business' directorship. At this printing establishment, Mitzler published scholarly editions of historic sources (a collection of chronicles, Collectio magna, 1761‚Äì71), literary works, and textbooks for the Corps of Cadets. He also operated a bookstore. Mitzler de Kolof promoted new ideas, including the emancipation of Poland's townspeople. From 1743 he was the chief advocate, in Poland, of Christian Wolff's philosophical doctrines.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Tatarkiewicz, Zarys dziej√≥w filozofii w Polsce (A Brief History of Philosophy in Poland), [in the series:] Historia nauki polskiej w monografiach (History of Polish Learning in Monographs), [volume] XXXII, Krak√≥w, Polska Akademia Umiejƒôtno≈õci (Polish Academy of Learning); 1948; pp. 11‚Äì12. NOTE: This monograph draws from pertinent sections in earlier editions of the author's Historia filozofii (History of Philosophy). Death Mitzler died in Warsaw in 1778. Music Mitzler, an amateur composer, was deeply interested in music theory, advocating the establishment of a musical science based firmly on mathematics; philosophy; and the imitation of nature in music. He translated Johann Joseph Fux's Gradus ad Parnassum into German (the original was in Latin), having written of it that \\"this methodical guide to musical composition [is] among all such works the best book that we have for practical music and its composition.\\"Felbick 2012, p. 233. Mitzler was a polymath: his interests encompassed music, mathematics, philosophy, theology, law, and the natural sciences. He was influenced in philosophy by the ideas of Wolff, Gottfried Leibniz, and Gottsched. The (this original title is in German and means \\"musical library\\"), which he published between 1736 and 1754, is an important document of the musical life in Germany at the time, and includes reviews of books on music written from 1650 up to its publication. Mizler himself contributed commentaries and criticisms on the writings of Wolfgang Printz, Leonhard Euler, Johann Adolf Scheibe, Johann Samuel Schroeter, , Gottsched, and Mattheson; especially the latter two's Critische Dichtkunst (1729) and Vollkommene Capellmeister (1739). His essays were detailed and perceptive and offer a useful musicological resource for present-day scholars of Baroque music.Felbick 2012, p. 126-309. Musical society The portrait of Bach commissioned for his entry into Mizler's Soziet√§t der Musicalischen Wissenschaften He founded the (or \\"Corresponding Society of the Musical Sciences\\") in 1738. Its aim was to enable musical scholars to circulate theoretical papers in order to further musical science by encouraging discussion of the papers via correspondence. Many of the papers appear in the Musikalische Bibliothek. The entry requirements of this society resulted in both the famous 1746/1748 Haussmann portrait of Bach and his Canonic Variations on \\"Vom Himmel hoch da komm' ich her\\" for organ, BWV 769. Membership was limited to twenty. Belonging to the society were: *1738: **G. de Lucchesini **L.C. Mizler (permanent secretary) **G. H. B√ºmler *1739 **C. G. Schr√∂ter **Heinrich Bokemeyer **G. P.

Directed by Frank Pierson, the screenplay was adapted by Pierson from the 1975 book King of the Gypsies by Peter Maas, which tells the story of Steve Tene and his Romani (Gypsy) family. Several technical advisors, bit players and extras who worked on the movie were real gypsies. David Grisman composed the score, which prominently featured legendary jazz violinist Stephane Grappelli; both men also appeared onscreen as gypsy musicians. Future actress Rachel Ticotin was one of the gypsy dancers. Eric Roberts was nominated for a 1979 Golden Globe for \\"Best Motion Picture Acting Debut - Male\\" for his performance as Dave. Plot summary The film deals with the criminal ways and turbulent lives of a group of modern-day Gypsies living in the early 1960s of New York City. While on his deathbed their \\"king\\", Zharko Stepanowicz (Sterling Hayden), passes his position of leadership on to his unwilling grandson, Dave (Eric Roberts). In spite of Dave's reluctance to become the Gypsies' new leader, Dave's father, Groffo (Judd Hirsch), resentful over not having been appointed leader, attempts to have Dave killed. Gruff is scheming and temperamental, and uses violence and threats to get the clan to do his bidding. Eventually this leads to a major confrontation with his son, and the film ends with the suggestion that Dave has finally accepted his legacy; with his voiceover considering the possibility of his bringing the rest of the tradition-bound Gypsies into the world of 20th Century customs and lifestyles.

Additional notes Dave's sister, Tita, is played by Brooke Shields, and his girlfriend, Sharon, is played by Annette O'Toole. This was the second consecutive film in which Susan Sarandon and Brooke Shields played mother and daughter, following Pretty Baby. Five and a half years after the release of the film, on June 20, 1984, Shelley Winters and Annie Potts appeared as guests on The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson. Miss Winters had no memory of working with Potts and the conversation brought the house down. A clip of this segment was replayed on several Tonight Show anniversary specials.

Such disturbances bring substantial amount of rainfall and are a threat to lives and property. Western disturbances, specifically the ones in winter, bring moderate to heavy rain in low-lying areas and heavy snow to mountainous areas of the Indian Subcontinent. They are the cause of most winter and pre-monsoon season rainfall across northwest India. Precipitation during the winter season has great importance in agriculture, particularly for the rabi crops. Wheat among them is one of the most important crops, which helps to meet India's food security. An average of four to five western disturbances form during the winter season. The rainfall distribution and amount varies with every western disturbance. Western disturbances are usually associated with cloudy sky, higher night temperatures and unusual rain. Excessive precipitation due to western disturbances can cause crop damage, landslides, floods and avalanches. Over the Indo-Gangetic plains, they occasionally bring cold wave conditions and dense fog. These conditions remain stable until disturbed by another western disturbance. When western disturbances move across northwest India before the onset of monsoon, a temporary advancement of monsoon current appears over the region. The strongest western disturbances usually occur in the northern parts of Pakistan, where flooding is reported number of times during the winter season. Effects on monsoon Western disturbances start declining in numbers after winter. During the summer months of April and May, they move across north India. The southwest monsoon current generally progresses from east to west in the northern Himalayan region, unlike western disturbances which follow a west to east trend in north India with consequent rise in pressure carrying cold pool of air. This helps in the activation of monsoon in certain parts of northwest India. It also cause pre monsoon rainfall especially in northern india. The interaction of the monsoon trough with western disturbances may occasionally cause dense clouding and heavy precipitation. The 2013 North India floods, which killed more than 5000 people in a span of 3 days, is said to be a result of one such interaction.

It is the burial place of the ancient Egyptian Ibi, who was \\"Chief Steward of the Adorer of the God\\" (Nitoqret I), during the reign of Psammetichus I during the 26th dynasty. Decoration and layout The tomb decoration in this tomb was copied from the tomb of another noble called Ibi, from the Old Kingdom cemetery at Deir el- Gabrawi. This is typical of the Saite Period, which tended to echo the decoration of previous periods of Egyptian history. The tomb is entered via a flight of steps that run parallel to the main axis. At the foot of these steps is an antechamber, which is decorated with scenes of Ibi adoring Ra-Horakhty. There is also a false door, echoing Old Kingdom decoration. A doorway leads from the middle of the right hand wall into what was a pillared hall (these pillars have since been destroyed). This room shows Ibi dressed as an ancient noble, watching the work of craftsmen and dancing girls. The right-hand wall has a doorway that leads into what was once an open court. This is decorated on the right-hand wall with a hunting scene, and on the left-hand wall Ibi and his father sit whilst offerings are placed in tables in front of them. From this hall several chambers lead off, one to the burial-shaft. These chambers have Ptolemaic paintings, and show that the tomb was reused at this time.

He was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. As a basketball player, he was a FIBA World Cup champion in 1950, who also competed at the 1948 Summer Olympic Games, and at the 1952 Summer Olympic Games. Furlong was inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame in September 2007. Early life and career Nicknamed Pill√≠n and El Primer Crack, Furlong started playing basketball and tennis at the Gymnastics and Tennis Club of Villa del Parque. He later concentrated in basketball, in the youth divisions of Club Gimnasia y Esgrima de Villa del Parque. After his debut with the first team in 1944, Furlong won 6 Torneo Metropolitano Buenos Aires League titles (1945, 1946, 1947, 1948, 1951, and 1954), in the amateur league that was run by the Argentine Basketball Federation. In 1953, Furlong began attending Southern Methodist University, where he played college basketball with the SMU Mustangs. He graduated in 1956, after reaching the 1956 NCAA Final Four, while playing alongside All American, and future NBA player, Jim Krebs. National team career Furlong (#8) fights for control of the ball, at the 1950 FIBA World Championship. At the 1948 London Summer Olympic Games, after a continued dominance by the United States in the Summer Olympics basketball competition, his 18 points scored, while playing center, helped the senior Argentine national basketball team stay within a basket of the USA, during a 59‚Äì57 loss. After the game, the United States' head coach, Omar Browning, called him, \\"one of the finest ball players I ever saw\\".\\"US Pushed to Top Argentina\\" at Kentucky New Era, 3 Aug 1948 The Argentine national team finished in fifteenth place in the 1948 Summer Olympics basketball tournament, after not being able to qualify to the eight-team second phase. Afterwards, Furlong also received and declined offers to play in the United States, for the NBA's Minneapolis Lakers, and Baltimore Bullets, and for Adolph Rupp, of the University of Kentucky. Furlong was a member of the Argentine team that won the gold medal at the 1950 FIBA World Championship, being the second top-scorer, a member of the All-Tournament Team, and the MVP of the tournament. He also scored 20 points in the final against the United States. In the 1951 Pan American Games, he helped Argentina win the silver medal in basketball. At the 1952 Helsinki Summer Olympics, his team earned a fourth-place finish in the basketball tournament, after losing in the semifinals, against the United States, 85‚Äì76. In 1953, after his team won the gold medal at the World University Games, he received a scholarship to play basketball for Southern Methodist University, in the United States. In 1955, he helped the Argentina squad repeat the silver medal result, at the 1955 Pan American Games. Retirement from basketball and tennis career In 1957, while playing club basketball for Villa del Parque, Furlong was forced to take an early retirement from the sport, at the age of 30, after the new Argentine military government and Amador Barros Hurtado (President of the Argentine Basketball Federation), made the controversial decision that all members of Argentina's FIBA World Cup team should be considered professional, as they had breached the ‚ÄòAmateurism Code‚Äô of the IOC, after receiving cars as gifts. On 8 January 1957, all the members of the Argentine FIBA World Cup team were banned for life, from participation in basketball. Juan Per√≥n had previously left the country, to escape the coup d'√©tat of his presidency. Furlong later played tennis, where he eventually attained a seventh place in the Argentine national rankings. In 1966, he joined the committee of the Argentine Tennis Association (AAT), becoming Vice- President, and eventually coach of the Argentine Davis Cup team. In 1977, his last year as a tennis coach, his team reached the semifinals of the 1977 Davis Cup.

The mountain is the highest point of the Swabian Jura (). It is one of the \\"Ten Thousanders\\" ‚Äîten 1,000-metre-high summits of the region. On the peak of the mountain is a 30-m-high tower which, reaching above the surrounding trees, offers a beautiful prospect, in clear weather as far as the Alps.  Prehistory  Like many of the mountains of the Swabian Alps, Lemberg is a \\"Zeugenberg\\"‚Äîa \\"witness mountain\\". A stratum of limestone has generally eroded away, leaving a few more-resistant remnants, such as the Lemberg. The name is Celtic in origin. Those Celtic prefix \\"lem-\\" means something like morass or sump. Probably this name derives from the source of the B√§ra river, a tributary of the Danube, at the foot of the mountain. From the 8th to 5th centuries B.C. there was a Hallstatt settlement on the Lemberg. Even today walls and ditches of a fortification can be detected on the summit. In the east and the west the summit plateau was terraced. Further remains of Celtic activity are also on the neighboring mountains, and the whole Heuberg region.  Lemberg tower  Lemberg observation tower By 1890 there were plans for the building of a wooden tower on the Lemberg or its neighbour, the Oberhohenberg (1,011 m). The historical significance and the comfortable ascent argued in favor of the Oberhohenberg, however finally‚Äîparticularly because of status as the highest mountain of the Swabian Alps‚Äîthe decision was made to build on the Lemberg. In 1894 the first terrain inspection was made by one engineer and two master craftsmen. However construction was delayed, in particular because of scarce funds. In 1897 the original plans were dropped; a discussion over the building of a tower from stone or iron began. Since the cost of a stone tower was estimated at 24,000 marks, a substantially cheaper building of iron was chosen. A company from Freiburg was assigned. The funds came predominantly from donations. The foundations were laid in Easter week, 1899. On Whit Monday, twelve workers began with the construction of the tower. Good weather favoured the work, so that on 17 June 1899 the building was already finished. The tower ascent has over 152 stairway steps, on twelve open floors. The tower consists of 23 tons of iron. The cost estimate of 10,000 Marks was not exceeded. The observation platform of Lemberg Tower is 30 metres above ground. With the flag pole on its top the tower is 34 metres tall. Since then, the tower has undergone refurbishing about every 25 years. Particularly after the First World War, during which the tower had also as in World War II no military importance, one played with the idea to demolish the tower in order to save the money for renovation. The suggestion did not find however sufficient proponents. The tower got in 1973 and 1999 closed for a longer time, in which it was refurbished by volunteered craftsmen from Gosheim. In the middle of the 1980s the former telecommunication office at of Rottweil installed two directional antennas on Lember Tower for the realization of a passive repeater microwave link between the communications building in Rottweil and the trunk exchange, situated at station road in Gosheim. This microwave link, which would not have been possible on direct way, served as addition to the existing telephone interwirings. After these were replaced by optical waveguide cables, this microwave link became ever more dispensable and in the year 2005 these antennas were dismantled. Geographical coordinates of Lemberg tower: 48¬∞9'3\\" N, 8¬∞44'56\\" E  Prospect  On clear days the view reaches to the south as far as the Alps, whose northern edge can be seen from the Zugspitze to the Bernese Alps. To the west lies the Black Forest, whose highest points are to be recognized: Feldberg in the southwest and Hornisgrinde in the northwest. At closer hand, the northwestern escarpment of the Swabian Alps (the Albtrauf) up to the Hohenzollern castle is to be seen, in the north the upper Neckar valley, the Sch√∂nbuch natural park, and in very good conditions even the Stuttgart TV tower, about 90 km away. Days with good viewing are more frequent in the autumn and winter than in the spring and summer.  Hiking access  The Lemberg can be ascended on designated hiking trails. The Schw√§bische Alb-Nordrand-Weg (\\"Swabian Alps northern edge way\\"), Hauptwanderweg 1 of the Swabian Alpine Club (Schw√§bischen Albverein), crosses the summit. From the nearest parking lot, the summit can be attained in about three-quarters of an hour, gaining about 180 m in elevation. From Wilflingen, the summit can be attained in approximately one and a half hours, climbing about 400 m. The trail crosses fields before entering the forest. The final climb of the trail is narrow and steep, gaining about 130 m.  Summit shelter  On the summit of the Lemberg, the Albverein maintains a hut; a German flag is flown from the tower on days when the hut is open. The first protection hut was inaugurated on 21 June 1901. It had a surface area of 6 √ó 3.5 m¬≤ and was a blockhouse made from round timbers on a concrete foundation. The construction cost amounted to 800 marks. Today's protection hut has a small guest room.

In its general form, the reaction can be described as a condensation reaction of aldehydes, ketones, Œ±,Œ≤-Unsaturated carbonyl compounds, or any combination of the above, in ammonia or ammonia derivatives. It was reported by Aleksei Chichibabin in 1924. The following is the overall form of the general reaction: :420px Reaction mechanism The elementary contributing steps of the reaction mechanism can be classified as more familiar name reactions, including an imine synthesis, a base-catalyzed aldol condensation, and initiating the ring-synthesis step, a Michael reaction. Fundamental reaction steps Chichibabin pyridine synthesis Detailed reaction mechanism Showing detailed curved-arrow electron pushing steps, formal charges, and categorized steps of the reaction. Mechanism of Chichibabin pyridine synthesis Synthetic applications Alkyl-substituted pyridines show widespread uses among multiple fields of applied chemistry, including the polymer and pharmaceutical industries. For example, 2-methylpyridine, 4-methylpyridine and 2-ethyl-5-methylpyridine exhibit widespread use in syntheses of latexes, ion-exchange matrixes, and photography materials. Limitations One of the chief limitations of practical application of the traditional Chichibabin pyridine synthesis is its consistently low product yield. With the exception of two experimental runs, Chichibabin himself was unable to obtain product yields in excess of 20% across a variety of reactants, solvents, and other experimental conditions. This, in concert with the high prevalence of byproducts, which would require a multitude of purification steps to isolate pure pyridine product, render unaltered forms of Chichibabin's method unsuitable for applied chemistry. The high proportion of byproducts and low yield are explained by the easily reversible nature of the aldol condensation, and carbonyl chemistry in general. For instance, the following side-reactions could lead to byproduct formation: Imine formation steps: 1.Nucleophilic attack of ammonia at the Œ≤-, rather than Œ±-carbon will prevent enamine/imine formation 2.Nucleophilic attack of ammonia on the enamine or imine Aldol condensation step 3.(In the case of asymmetric ketones), abstraction of the non-preferred Œ≤-Hydrogen 4.Enolate ion attack of the enamine or imine carbon 5.Enolate ion attack of an unintended aldehyde- or keto-carbonyl Pyridine synthesis step 6\\\\. Imine attack of carbonyl-, rather than Œ≥-carbon 7\\\\. Imine attack at an enamine or imine carbon In the case of simple aldehydes, and particularly in the case of Œ±,Œ≤-Unsaturated carbonyl compounds, polymerization of starting materials can occur frequently and is shown to significantly decrease yields. Ways to overcome limitations 1\\\\. Protection of the carbonyl increases product yields 2\\\\. Use of paraldehyde as a source of gradually available acetaldehyde 3\\\\. Large (>3x catalytic) excess of aqueous ammonia, with catalytic amounts of ammonium acetate 4\\\\. Conducting the reaction in the gas phase and passing-over a number of catalysts including aluminium(III) oxide (yield 65% at 600 K), zeolite (yield 98.9% at 500 K), and many others. 5\\\\. Increased pressures and temperature In vivo evidence of this mechanism In vivo, deamination of the Œ±-amino group of amino acids produces small amounts of ammonia. Researchers found that protein-incorporated allysine, (deaminated lysine) from bovine ligamentum nuchae elastin fibers appeared to be pyridine crosslinked. The structures of these cross-linked amino acids had 3,4,5- and 2,3,5-trisubstituted pyridine skeletons, specifically pyridinated desmosine (DESP) and pyridinated isodesmosine (IDP). Extrapolating from an in-vitro elastin model under physiological conditions, the researchers found that the ratios of IDP to DESP corresponded extremely closely with values based on both a calculation of a theoretical Chichibabin pyridine synthesis of 3 mol allysine and 1 mol ammonia, and reported ratios of 2,3,5- to 3,4,5-trisubstituted pyridine ratios of a Chichibabin pyridine synthesis involving phenylacetaldehyde. They concluded with relative certainty that the pyridine cross-links found in elastin were, in fact, due to an in- vivo Chichibabin pyridine synthesis of ammonia and allysine.

The series was re-released on DVD in 2003, with an 81-minute special-features disc. Production history The Long and Winding Road An official documentary on the Beatles career had been in the pipeline as early as 1970. Long-time friend and Apple Corps manager Neil Aspinall had compiled footage of concert, interview, and television appearances from various sources around the world. From this archival footage, he assembled a 90-minute feature film which was tentatively titled The Long and Winding Road and was completed in 1971. At this point, none of the former members had any involvement with the project, and plans for its release lay dormant until 1980, when John Lennon made a statement as part of a legal deposition against the producers of the musical Beatlemania. \\"I and the other three former Beatles have plans to stage a reunion concert\\", he said, referring to an event that was to be filmed as a finale of The Long and Winding Road (which was now to be a television special).Badman (2001), p. 269. According to Yoko Ono, the concert would have been held in England: \\"Just days before his brutal death, John was making plans to go to England for a triumphant Beatles reunion. His greatest dream was to recreate the musical magic of the early years with Paul, George and Ringo ‚Ä¶ (he) felt that they had traveled different paths for long enough. He felt they had grown up and were mature enough to try writing and recording new songs.\\"Badman (2002), p. 273. The alleged plan for a reunion was abandoned after Lennon was murdered on 8 December. Project resurrected In 1992, the project was resurrected as a six-part documentary series. This time, the surviving membersThey were later dubbed \\"The Threetles\\" by the press. were directly involved, giving interviews on film with Jools Holland. Lennon's interviews were sourced from archived footage. Also interviewed were insiders Neil Aspinall, the band's press agent Derek Taylor, and their long-time producer George Martin. The title of the documentary was now changed to The Beatles Anthology, as George Harrison was against naming the entire Beatles career after a Paul McCartney song. This new title was to be a working one but it eventually stayed, as it suited the parties concerned.Badman (2001), p. 489. A rough cut was completed in 1993 which was much more interview-based and focused on events, as opposed to the final cut, which included more concert and television performances. This early version of the series has since leaked and been released via bootleg. The documentary was broadcast on American television in three feature-length episodes comprising six abridged parts (two per episode) on Sunday 19 November, Wednesday 22 November, and Thursday 23 November 1995. It aired from 9 pm to 11 pm on ABC. The documentary was released on VHS and Laserdisc the following year. The Anthology was first shown on American television on ABC; the tagline for the network during the time was \\"A Beatles C\\".ABC print advertising, late 1995 and early 1996, TV Guide local edition Critical reception The documentary was met with generally positive reviews. Richard Buskin, author of The Complete Idiot's Guide to Beatles, commented that the retelling of the band's story was \\"extremely subjective\\" with the small lineup of only the four Beatles plus Martin, Aspinall and Taylor to voice their recollections. McCartney, Harrison and Starr \\"provided insights into their legend from the mature perspective of men in their fifties\\", according to Buskin, while \\"Lennon's [interviews] mostly originated from when he was in his twenties or thirties.\\" When viewing the separate interviews, the three surviving Beatles did not always recall events the same way. Compromises had to be reached so that sensibilities were not offended, in particular with regard to events resulting in the 1970 breakup. Thus, Buskin stated, the end result was not a definitive story of the Beatles' history, but rather a diplomatic celebration. New music The plans for a concert were abandoned and replaced with the intention that the surviving three members would play some incidental music in between segments and interviews. It was then put forward that the Beatles should write some new songs for the project. Both McCartney and Harrison wrote some material which became the song \\"All For Love\\", but it was then suggested to ask Yoko Ono if Lennon had left any unfinished material that they could work with. Ono gave McCartney cassette tapes in 1994 after they appeared together on stage at Lennon's induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The tapes contained four song demos that Lennon had been working on: \\"Free as a Bird\\", \\"Real Love\\", \\"Now and Then\\" and \\"Grow Old With Me\\".

The relative bearing is measured with a pelorus or other optical and electronic aids to navigation such as a periscope, sonar system, and radar systems. Since World War II, relative bearings of such diverse point sources have been and are calibrated carefully to one another. The United States Navy operates a special range off Puerto Rico and another on the west coast to perform such systems integration. Relative bearings then serve as the baseline data for converting relative directional data into true bearings (N-S-E-W, relative to the Earth's true geography). By contrast, Compass bearings have a varying error factor at differing locations about the globe, and are less reliable than the compensated or true bearings. The measurement of relative bearings of fixed landmarks and other navigational aids is useful for the navigator because this information can be used on the nautical chart together with simple geometrical techniques to aid in determining the position of the vessel and/or its speed, course, etc. The measurement of relative bearings of other vessels and objects in movement is useful to the navigator in avoiding the danger of collision. * Example: The navigator on a ship observes a lighthouse when its relative bearing is 45¬∞ and again when it is 90¬∞. He now knows that the distance from the ship to the lighthouse is equal to the distance travelled by the vessel between both observations.

AD 453) was the last wife of the Hunnic ruler Attila. Her name is East Germanic and suggests a Gothic origin. According to Priscus, Attila died after the feast celebrating their marriage in 453 AD, in which he suffered a severe nosebleed and choked to death in a stupor. \\"Shortly before he died, as the historian Priscus relates, he took in marriage a very beautiful girl named Ildico, after countless other wives, as was the custom of his race. He had given himself up to excessive joy at his wedding, and as he lay on his back, heavy with wine and sleep, a rush of superfluous blood, which would ordinarily have flowed from his nose, streamed in deadly course down his throat and killed him, since it was hindered in the usual passages. Thus did drunkenness put a disgraceful end to a king renowned in war. On the following day, when a great part of the morning was spent, the royal attendants suspected some ill and, after a great uproar, broke in the doors. There they found the death of Attila accomplished by an effusion of blood, without any wound, and the girl with downcast face weeping beneath her veil.JORDANES.

It tells the humorous story of a boy, John, who is visited by the titular Man, a minuscule human (homunculus) who arrives in the boy's bedroom unclothed and hungry. After getting over his initial shock, the boy starts to take care of him. The story follows their relationship over the next few days between John and 'Man', with the Man showing himself to be demanding, bossy and messy, but nevertheless a bond forms between the pair. Their time together involves many funny and peculiar moments, such as an odd obsession with Frank Cooper's Oxford marmalade, using socks for jumpers, and a near-death collision with a marmalade jar. Unlike the boy and Snowman in Briggs' famous wordless picture book The Snowman, both characters have full dialogue throughout, with each character's lines formatted differently so that they can be distinguished. Occasionally the dialogue and drawings are interspersed so that speech bubbles surround certain lines of text. Dutch and Danish-language editions were published in 1993 and the first U.S. edition in 1995. Later there was an audiobook edition, with Michael Palin voicing the Man and William Puttock voicing John. For both writing and illustrating The Man Briggs won the 1992 Kurt Maschler Award, or \\"the Emil\\".

Family  Eurydice was probably the mother of Creon's five children: Menoeceus (Megareus), Lycomedes, Haemon, Megara and Pyrrha.  Mythology   Sophocles' account  She appears briefly in Sophocles' Antigone (as an \\"archetypal grieving, saddened mother\\" and an older counterpart to Antigone), to kill herself after learning, from a messenger, that her son Haemon and his betrothed, Antigone, have both committed suicide. She thrusts a sword into her heart and curses Creon for the death of her two sons: Haemon and Megareus. Haemon killed himself because his father Creon had unjustly killed Antigone, to whom he was engaged.Sophocles, Antigone 1180, 1300 and passim  Statius' account  When the seer Tiresias predicts that if a son of Creon voluntarily throws himself off the wall, the city will be saved. Then Menoeceus decided to sacrifice himself and jumped off the wall. When his dead body was carried on the shoulders by a few people, Eurydice bursts through town in a wail of: : 'Was it then to make atonement and devote thy life for cruel Thebes that I nourished thee, illustrious boy, as though I were some worthless mother? What crime then had I wrought, what god so hated me? No incestuous offspring have I borne in unnatural intercourse, nor given unhallowed progeny to my own son. What matters that? Jocasta hath her sons, and sees them leaders and kings: but we must make cruel expiation for the war, that the brothers, sons of Oedipus, may exchange their diadems ‚Äî doth this please thee, O author of the blow? But why complain I of men and gods? Thou, cruel Menoeceus, thou before all didst haste to slay thy unhappy mother! Whence came this love of death? What cursed madness seized thy mind? What did I conceive, what misbegotten child did I bear, so different from myself? Verily 'tis the snake of Mars [Ares], and the ground that burgeoned fresh with our armed sires ‚Äî thence comes that desperate valour, that overmastering love of war: nought comes of his mother. Lo! of thine own will and pleasure slain, ay, even against the will of Fate, thou forcest an entrance to the gloomy shades. I was fearing the Danaan and the shafts of Capaneus: 'twas this hand, this hand of thine I should have feared, and the sword I myself once gave thee in my folly. See how the glade is wholly buried in his throat! None of the Danaan could have made a deeper thurst.' That is how Eurydice keeps complaining and complaining.Statius, Thebaid 10.783-814 Eventually, she was led away by friendly hands to the palace. The lamentation, however, was getting worse, so her companions and servants were forced to lock Eurydice into her room. There, she ploughed her face with her nails, pulled her hair out of her head and continued to mourn for months. In the end, she lost her voice, no longer looked towards the light, did not listen to supplications and lost her mind.

He was a descendant of American Revolutionary War Generals, Tennessee Governor John Sevier, and French royalty. He matriculated into the University of Georgia at the age of 16. He was boxing champion during his Junior year. He graduated from the University of Georgia (BS, 1880). Following the Civil War, with the Fuller family farm destroyed, and slaves freed, the Fuller family moved immediately to Atlanta. His father, Henry Alexander Fuller, opened what would become the largest Grocery Store in Atlanta during reconstruction. H.A. Fuller, with his sons Oliver, and Clarence Paul Fuller became Grocer Merchants. This store originated as Fuller & Oglesby. This partnership was dissolved, and became Fuller & Sons. In 1881 he married Katherine Fitzhugh Caswell of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and they had six children. Fuller and Caswell took over management of her father's estate, Napoleon Bonaparte (N.B.)

Database and web services The GeoNames database contains over 25,000,000 geographical names corresponding to over 11,800,000 unique features. All features are categorized into one of nine feature classes and further subcategorized into one of 645 feature codes. Beyond names of places in various languages, data stored include latitude, longitude, elevation, population, administrative subdivision and postal codes. All coordinates use the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84). Those data are accessible free of charge through a number of Web services and a daily database export. Wiki interface The core of GeoNames database is provided by official public sources, the quality of which may vary. Through a wiki interface, users are invited to manually edit and improve the database by adding or correcting names, move existing features, add new features, etc. Semantic Web integration Each GeoNames feature is represented as a web resource identified by a stable URI. This URI provides access, through content negotiation, either to the HTML wiki page, or to a RDF description of the feature, using elements of the GeoNames ontology. This ontology describes the GeoNames features properties using the Web Ontology Language, the feature classes and codes being described in the SKOS language. Through Wikipedia articles URL linked in the RDF descriptions, GeoNames data are linked to DBpedia data and other RDF Linked Data.

Manually correcting these inaccuracies is both tedious and error prone (due to the database size) and may require experts. The literature provides very few works on automatically resolving them. study the problem of automatically detecting the scope of locations in a geographical database and its applications in identifying inconsistencies and improving the quality of the database. Computing the boundary information can help detect inconsistencies such as near-identical places and the placement of locations such as cities under wrong parents such as provinces or countries.

Pierikos () is a Greek football club based in Katerini, Greece, part of the major multi-sport club of the same name. Their name was inspired from the State's name of Pieria. The club currently competes in the Gamma Ethniki, the fourth tier of the Greek football league system.  History of the club   The foundation  The club was founded on 11 April 1961 from the merger between Megas Alexandros (meaning Alexander the Great) Katerinis and Olympos Katerinis. Megas Alexandros had played in the 1st Division of Greek football in its first season (1959‚Äì60) but finished in the 15th position and thus relegated in the 2nd Division. Neither Megas Alexandros nor Olympos gained promotion in the following season. Unification of the two clubs has seen as the only way for the city of Katerini to have a team in the 1st Division. Therefore, Pierikos was born.The Birth of Pierikos The 1960s *In its first season (1961‚Äì62) Pierikos took the place of Megas Alexandros in the 2nd Division. It played in the Group of Western and Central Macedonia and finished 1st. Therefore, it was able to play in the 2nd Division play-offs. In the final Pierikos won 2‚Äì0 in a match against Olympiakos Kozanis and gained promotion to the 1st Division. In this season Pierikos scored 108 goals and conceded 28. *In its first season (1962‚Äì63), in the 1st division Pierikos finished in the 9th position scoring 36 goals and conceding 37.

Pierikos also played in the Greek Cup Semi- Final this season where was suffered a 3‚Äì1 defeat by AEK Athens FC.The finals of the Greek Cup that left in history This was as Final because the other Semi-Final between Olympiacos and Panathinaikos FC never ended and therefore AEK Athens FC was awarded the Greek Cup by E.P.O. *The 1964‚Äì65 season is, probably, the best season in the history of Pierikos. Pierikos finished in the 5th position scoring 39 and conceding 39. Its biggest win was a 4‚Äì0 against Niki Volou. *In the 1965‚Äì66 season, Pierikos finished in the 8th position.

The club scored 31 and conceded 43 goals. The club started showing signs of fatigue. *And these signs became totally clear in the 1971‚Äì72 season. Pierikos finished in the 16th position (out of 18 clubs) and thus relegated from the 1st Division. Its biggest wins were a 3‚Äì0 against Olympiakos Nicosia, a 3‚Äì0 against Panionios and a 3‚Äì0 against Olympiakos Volou.

Its biggest wins were a 4‚Äì0 against Panachaiki GE and a 4‚Äì0 against AO Egaleo. In this season Pierikos scored 46 goals and conceded 56. The club had the 4th best offense in the division but also the worst defense by far. *The 1978‚Äì79 season, is a black page in the history of the club. Pierikos plays in the Northern Group of the 2nd Division (the 2nd Division was then divided in two groups, each one having 20 clubs). The club finished in the 3rd position having lost a lot of games without match.Pierikos' relegation for bribery In that season Pierikos scored a fantastic 10‚Äì1 victory against Makedonikos Siatista F.C..

After these claims, the club was relegated to the National Amateur Division (3rd Division) instead of getting promotion to the 1st Division.Pierikos Relegated - GUILTY FOR BRIBERY  The 1980s  * In the 1979‚Äì80 season, Pierikos played in Group C of the National Amateur Division (3rd Division).

This is the biggest victory of the club ever. * In the 1980‚Äì81 season, Pierikos played in the Northern Group of the 2nd Division. Unfortunately for Pierikos, Iraklis Thessalonikis played in the same group. Iraklis is one of the biggest clubs in Greece, and that was the only season that Iraklis didn't play in the 1st Division. Iraklis was relegated because of accusations of bribing. Pierikos finally finished in the 2nd position with 58 points. In that season Pierikos scored 50 and conceded 34 goals.

Modern history  *In the 2019‚Äì20 season, Pierikos plays in the 3rd Group of the 4th Division. 2007‚Äì2008 season Panserraikos (left) *Pierikos started in fascinating manner in the 2007‚Äì2008 season. In the first matchday Pierikos won Kastoria by 3‚Äì0 (Pierikos' biggest win in the season) at home. In the second matchday Pierikos played again at home and won 2‚Äì1 versus PAS Giannina. After that Pierikos' manager Giorgos Vazakas resigned and the team was unable to find its starting form under guidance of German manager Thomas Kost. *In a game against ASK Olympiakos Volos the match referee showed 9 yellow cards, 2 red cards to the players of Pierikos plus a dubious penalty for ASK Olympiakos Volos (saved by the goalkeeper of Pierikos). Besides the team playing with 9 players, almost all of them having yellow cards, Pierikos was able to hold the match in a 0‚Äì0 score until the 68th minute. Then the referee Sidiropoulos gave a dubious foul, just outside the Pierikos area which ended up in the net making the score 1‚Äì0. After the 80th minute 3 players of Pierikos got out of the game for getting injured (Serginho 82', Garozis 84', Kalambakas 89') and thus Pierikos had just 3 players on field. The final whistle had gone in the 89th minute of the game. In the end 48 fouls were given against Pierikos, while only 8 against ASK Olympiakos Volos *A disciplinary committee decided that the game should be recorded as a 3‚Äì0 win by ASK Olympiakos Volos, plus Pierikos should have 3 points deducted. Their decision was based on the assumption that the Pierikos players were making up their injuries in their game against ASK Olympiakos Volos. *Pierikos struggled until the end of the season to avoid relegation to the 3rd Division, and finally managed it after an away win against Ionikos in the last matchday with a score of 1‚Äì0. *The team finally ended the league in the 13th position (out of 18 teams) gathering 42 points. The team scored 28 goals (the leagues 3rd worst scoring record) and conceded 31 This was the 3rd best defence after the league champions Panserraikos (conceded 19 goals) and the league runner-up Thrasyvoulos (conceded 27).

Then it once again achieved promotion to the Gamma Ethniki during the 2015‚àí16 season, when the club was crowned champions of Heraklion by finishing first in the regional league, and eventually placing first in the 2016 FCA Winners' Championship. Atsalenios currently holds the record for most Heraklion FCA Cup trophies won since the competition was established in 1971, with a total of 12 wins. The club has also claimed 9 Heraklion FCA Championships, second-most behind modern Superleague regulars OFI. Atsalenios maintains its own football academies, having produced a number of players that have since moved on to more prestigious clubs in Heraklion, such as OFI Crete and Ergotelis, as well as other Greek Superleague clubs. Some of the most renowned players to emerge from Atsalenios' infrastructure segments include Michalis Sifakis (former Greek champion with Olympiacos, 15 international caps with the Greek national football team), his father Myron (1986‚àí87 Greek Cup winner with OFI Crete), Manolis Roubakis, Petros Giakoumakis and others.

This is Derby's only FA Cup triumph. Stamps came close to scoring in regular time but the ball burst as he shot, making it easier to save. Stamps was famous for his powerful shot and is a cult figure in Derby County history, with the club's annual Player of the Year award being named after him. In 1942‚Äì43, Stamps made 14 guest appearances for Southampton, scoring 11 goals. He played for Burton Albion FC in the 1954‚Äì1955 season, signed by manager Reg Weston. He had scored 12 goals (including 2 penalties) in the Birmingham League and 6 goals in cup ties before the boxing day match against Gresley Rovers. He died in November 1991, barely two weeks before what would have been his 73rd birthday. Although blind for the final 20 years of his life, he continued to attend Derby County games. There was a bar in Derby city centre named after him, but in the early 2000s it was changed to a Walkabout bar.

A former amateur champion, he made his professional debut in 1993. The highest rank he reached was maegashira 4. He retired in March 2009 and is now a sumo coach. Career ≈åtsukasa began sumo at Miki Middle School and was a member of Ichikawa High School's sumo club, where he won national high school sumo championships. He continued his amateur sumo career at Nihon University. ≈åtsukasa was recruited by the former sekiwake Tochitsukasa, also a Nihon University alumni and head of the then-newly formed Irumagawa stable. He made his professional debut in March 1993. Due to his amateur achievements, he was given makushita tsukedashi status, meaning he could enter in the third-highest makushita division. Initially fighting under his real name of ≈åuchi, he won the makushita y≈´sh≈ç or championship in only his second tournament, with a perfect 7-0 record. However, it was not until January 1996 that he became a sekitori by earning promotion to the second- highest j≈´ry≈ç division, upon which he adopted the shikona of ≈åtsukasa. After a couple of short spells back in the makushita division, he took the j≈´ry≈ç division championship in May 1999 with an 11‚Äì4 record. He made the top makuuchi division for the first time in September 1999. The 39 tournaments it took him from his professional debut to reach makuuchi is the third-slowest amongst former collegiate wrestlers. During his sekitori career (75 tournaments in total) ≈åtsukasa was a classic \\"elevator\\" rikishi, too good for j≈´ry≈ç but not quite good enough for the top division. He was promoted to makuuchi no less than 11 times in total. This is two fewer than the record of 13 promotions held by Oshio, a record ≈åtsukasa said he would have liked to break. ≈åtsukasa was ranked in the top division for three of the six tournaments held in 2007 but did not manage a majority of wins against losses in makuuchi after July 2004. His last promotion in March 2008 made him the third-oldest postwar wrestler to earn promotion to the top division at 37 years. He won his first four bouts on his final return but then lost 10 in a row to finish with a 5-10 score. He won a second j≈´ry≈ç championship in January 2005. After the retirement of Kotonowaka in November 2005 he was the oldest man in the sekitori ranks (the top two divisions). Restricted by a shoulder injury, he produced only one winning record after January 2008. After the 2009 Haru basho, ≈åtsukasa would have dropped out of j≈´ry≈ç (see retirement below). His departure left Tosanoumi, who is two days under a year younger than ≈åtsukasa, as the oldest active sekitori. Fighting style His most frequently used kimarite or technique was a simple yori-kiri or force out, but he also favoured pushing or thrusting moves such as oshi-dashi and tsuki- otoshi, and pull downs such as hataki-komi and hiki-otoshi. At 175 cm or 5 ft 9 in he was one of the shortest wrestlers in the top two divisions. Retirement from sumo ≈åtsukasa pulled out of the March 2009 tournament on the 13th day with only one win, facing certain demotion to makushita for the first time since 1998. Before the start of the 14th day's matches, he officially announced his retirement from sumo at the age of 38. He said that although he would have liked to have reached a san'yaku rank, he left with no regrets. He has stayed in the sumo world as a coach at Irumagawa stable, having purchased the toshiyori name of Wakafuji. His danpatsu-shiki, or official retirement ceremony, was held at the Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan on January 30, 2010. Personal life He married in October 2013 and the wedding reception was held in August 2014.https://www.kobe- np.co.jp/news/sports/201409/0007297392.shtml Career record See also *Glossary of sumo terms *List of sumo tournament second division champions *List of past sumo wrestlers *List of sumo elders References External links * Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:People from Miki, Hy≈çgo Category:Japanese sumo wrestlers Category:Sumo people from Hy≈çgo Prefecture Category:Nihon University alumni ","title":"≈åtsukasa Nobuhide"},{"id":"11686762","text":"Abulak is a martyr and saint of the Coptic Church.

It was founded in 1905. Diagoras is named after the island's ancient boxer Diagoras. The team first played under Ottoman Rule until the short lived independence of the Dodecanese in 1912. No matches at all were held during the Balkan Wars and the team did not play with Greek teams until the Dodecanese joined with the rest of Greece in 1947. History The club demonstrated rich social, cultural, sporting and especially patriotic activities, because of which was dissolved by the occupying Fascist Italian authorities in 1929. Diagoras reconstituted in 1945, just prior the liberation of Rhodes and the union with Greece. They played in Super League Greece between 1986-1989. In 1987, the club reached the semi-finals of the Greek Cup, losing to OFI. On 16 February 2012, Diagoras was expelled from the professional leagues by the Greek Professional Sports Committee.

The history of militia in the United States dates from the colonial era. Based on the English system, colonial militias were drawn from the body of adult male citizens of a community, town, or local region. Because there was no standing English Army before the English Civil War, and subsequently the English Army and later the British Army had few regulars garrisoning North America, colonial militia served a vital role in local conflicts, particularly in the French and Indian Wars. Before shooting began in the American War of Independence, American revolutionaries took control of the militia system, reinvigorating training and excluding men with Loyalist inclinations.John Shy, \\"Mobilizing Armed Force in the American Revolution\\", in John Parker and Carol Urness, eds., The American Revolution: A Heritage of Change (Minneapolis, 1975), pp. 104‚Äì5. Regulation of the militia was codified by the Second Continental Congress with the Articles of Confederation. The revolutionaries also created a full-time regular army‚Äîthe Continental Army‚Äîbut because of manpower shortages the militia provided short- term support to the regulars in the field throughout the war. In colonial era Anglo-American usage, militia service was distinguished from military service in that the latter was normally a commitment for a fixed period of time of at least a year, for a salary, whereas militia was only to meet a threat, or prepare to meet a threat, for periods of time expected to be short. Militia persons were normally expected to provide their own weapons, equipment, or supplies, although they may later be compensated for losses or expenditures.Stephen P. Halbrook, \\"The Right of the People or the Power of the State Bearing Arms, Arming Militias, and the Second Amendment,\\" Valparaiso Law Review, vol. 26, number 1, page 131 (1991). Many of the states continued to maintain their militia after the American Revolution until after the U.S. Civil War. Many of the state National Guards trace their roots to the militia from the American Revolution. The lists below show the known militia units by state for the original colonies plus Vermont.The lists of state militias do not contain Continental Army units, unless they also served as militia units at some time during the Revolutionary War. Some states also had state units that were not militia or Continental Army.

During the American Revolutionary War, Delaware raised several units of militia in support of the Patriot side of the war. In the War of 1812, all of the Delaware volunteer units saw combat at Lewes, where they comprised the majority of force that drove off a British naval squadron seeking control of the Delaware River. Despite the federal government initially prohibiting volunteer units the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, a volunteer unit raised in Delaware would serve in the battles of Contreras, Cherubusco, Molino del Rey, and Chapultepec, losing so many men that the unit was nicknamed \\"The Bloody 11th.\\" During the American Civil War, Delaware would raise multiple units in support of the Union cause. During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the 1st Delaware Volunteer Infantry was mustered into federal service but not deployed abroad. With the passage of the Militia Act of 1903, all state militia units were folded into the National Guard of the United States, largely turning the state militias from a state-funded and controlled force to a reserve component of the federal military.

Initially, the militia units were centered on the 35 counties that then existed in the Province of North Carolina. The units fought against the British, Loyalists, and Cherokee Native Americans that aligned themselves with British forces. The units included military district brigades established in 1776, county regiments, four battalions, and one independent corps of light horse. Four regiments were located in counties that became part of the Southwest Territory in 1790 and later Tennessee in 1796. The size of brigades could be up to a few thousand volunteers. Brigades were commanded by a brigadier general. Regiments were commanded by a colonel and made up of a number of companies commanded by captains with about 50 men in each company. During engagements, one or more companies of regiments may have been involved in actions and commanded by the regimental or brigade commander. In 1778, Major General John Ashe was selected to command all North Carolina militia and State Troops. Brigade commanders reported to him. Separate from the North Carolina militia, the state provided 10 numbered regiments to the Continental Army that were referred to as the North Carolina Line. The following are the North Carolina militia Brigades and Regiments, along with the dates established and disestablished.: * Edenton District Brigade, 1776‚Äì1783 ** 1st Regiment of North Carolina Militia, 1780-1780 ** 2nd Regiment of North Carolina Militia, 1780-1780 ** Bertie County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** Camden County Regiment, 1777‚Äì1783 ** Chowan County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** Currituck County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** Gates County Regiment, 1779‚Äì1783 ** Hertford County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** Martin County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** 1st Pasquotank County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** 2nd Pasquotank County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1777 ** Perquimans County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** Tyrrell County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 * Halifax District Brigade, 1776‚Äì1783 ** 1st Battalion of Volunteers, 1776‚Äì1777 ** 2nd Battalion of Volunteers, 1776‚Äì1777 ** Bute County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1779 ** Edgecombe County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** Franklin County Regiment, 1779‚Äì1783 ** Halifax County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** Martin County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** Nash County Regiment, 1777‚Äì1783 ** Northampton County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** Warren County Regiment, 1779‚Äì1783 * Hillsborough District Brigade, 1776‚Äì1783 ** Caswell County Regiment, 1777‚Äì1783 ** Chatham County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** Granville County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** Mounted Volunteers Regiment, 1780-1780 ** Northern Orange County Regiment, 1776‚Äì1777 ** Orange County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** Randolph County Regiment, 1779‚Äì1783 ** Wake County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 * New Bern District Brigade, 1776‚Äì1783 ** Beaufort County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** Carteret County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** Craven County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** Dobbs County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** Hyde County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** Johnston County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** Jones County Regiment, 1779‚Äì1783 ** Pitt County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** Wayne County Regiment, 1779‚Äì1783 * Morgan District Brigade, 1782‚Äì1783 ** Davidson County Regiment, 1783-1783 ** Green County Regiment, 1783-1783 * Salisbury District Brigade, 1776‚Äì1783 ** Anson County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** Burke County Regiment, 1777‚Äì1782 ** Guilford County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** Lincoln County Regiment, 1779‚Äì1783 ** 1st Mecklenburg County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** 2nd Mecklenburg County Regiment, 1779‚Äì1780 **Polk's regiment of light dragoons, 1779‚Äì1780Polk's regiment of light dragoons was transferred to the South Carolina State troops in 1781 ** Montgomery County Regiment, 1779‚Äì1783 ** Richmond County Regiment, 1779‚Äì1783 ** Rowan County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** 2nd Rowan County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1777, 1782‚Äì1783 ** Rutherford County Regiment, 1779‚Äì1783 ** Sullivan County Regiment, 1779‚Äì1783 ** Surry County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** Tryon County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1779 ** Washington District Regiment, 1776‚Äì1777 ** Washington County Regiment, 1777‚Äì1783 ** Wilkes County Regiment, 1777‚Äì1783 * Wilmington District Brigade, 1776‚Äì1783 ** 1st Battalion of Militia, 1776-1776 ** 2nd Battalion of Militia, 1776-1776 ** Bladen County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** Brunswick County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** Cumberland County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** Duplin County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** New Hanover County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 ** Onslow County Regiment, 1775‚Äì1783 * Independent units **Independent corps of light horse, 1780  Pennsylvania  On November 25, 1755, the Pennsylvania Assembly passed the Militia Act of 1755. This measure 'legalized a military force from those who were willing and desirous of being united for military purposes within the province.' This was as a result of citizens' pleas for protection from the French and Indians on the western borders. Two years later, a compulsory militia law was also enacted. All males between 17 and 45 years of age, having a freehold worth 150 pounds a year, were to be organized into companies. Every enrolled militiaman was required to appear for training, arming himself, on the first Mondays of March, June, August, and November.

He also performed research involving diseases such as tuberculosis and cancer. In 1881 he was elected President of the London Medical Society and in 1887 President of the Clinical Society of London. Broadbent was a Physician-Extraordinary to Queen Victoria and Physician-in-Ordinary to King Edward VII and the Prince of Wales. Early life and education Broadbent was born at Longwood Edge in Lindley, now part of Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. He was the eldest of seven children born to John Broadbent, a wool manufacturer and prominent Wesleyan, and Esther (n√©e Butterworth). His younger brother was Colonel John Edward Broadbent . He was educated at Huddersfield College before he decided to study medicine. He was apprenticed to a doctor in Manchester before studying medicine at Owens College, and the Royal School of Medicine in Manchester. He studied in Paris in 1857 and returned in 1858 to pass the M.B. examination at Manchester. Career In 1859, Broadbent took up a junior post at St Mary's Hospital, London, with which he was associated for much of his career (1859‚Äì1896). The next year he was elected physician to the London Fever Hospital. In 1865, he was promoted to physician in charge of patients at St. Mary's, and full physician in 1871. It was through his work at St. Mary's that Broadbent earned his reputation as an expert pathologist and outstanding clinical teacher. His areas of expertise included neurology and cardiology, as well as cancer and typhoid. The months of November 1891 to October 1892 were critically important to Broadbent and his career, and gave him a narrow involvement in a notorious series of crimes. In November to December 1891 Broadbent was involved in saving the life of Prince George (the future King George V) from typhoid fever. At about the same time that he was involved in this he was sent a mysterious letter accusing him of murdering a prostitute named Matilda Clover the previous October with poison. This letter demanded a huge blackmail amount to avoid ruin. Broadbent wisely sent the letter to Scotland Yard. In January 1892, he was sent for by the Royal Family in an attempt to save Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale the older son of the Prince and Princess of Wales and \\"heir presumptive\\" to the throne of England. The Prince, known as \\"Prince Eddy\\" to the public (and nicknamed \\"Collars and Cuffs\\" due to some wardrobe choices he made) had caught a virulent strain of influenza. Broadbent tried everything he could to save the Duke, but on 14 January 1892 the Duke died. However, the Prince of Wales sent Broadbent a letter thanking him for his endeavours, that preserved for him and his wife one of their sons. Then, in the late spring, Broadbent was informed of a police investigation into the deaths of a series of prostitutes in the Stepney and Lambeth areas of London that began in October 1891 and continued until April 1892. One of the victims was Matilda Clover, who had been classified as having died of natural causes, but the letter from the blackmailer to Broadbent gave details showing the woman had been poisoned. An arrest was made in June 1892 of Dr. Thomas Neill Cream for blackmailing another physician named Harper. Subsequently this was changed to a charge of murder for the poisoning of Matilda Clover. The trial of the defendant occurred in October 1892, with the charges including the attempted blackmail of Broadbent, and Broadbent's appearance as a witness. Cream was found guilty and sentenced to death, being hanged in November 1892. Broadbent was a Physician-Extraordinary to Queen Victoria and Physician-in- Ordinary to King Edward VII and the Prince of Wales. Honours Broadbent received honorary doctorates from the universities of Edinburgh, where he obtained a M.D. with the thesis 'On the connection between diseases of the heart and apoplexy', St. Andrews, Leeds, McGill and Toronto. Broadbent was created a baronet, of Brook Street and Longwood, in 1893. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in March 1901. Personal life Broadbent married Eliza Harpin in 1863, and had three sons and three daughters: *Mary Ethel (1864 ‚Äì 10 March 1954) *John Francis Harpin (16 October 1865 ‚Äì 27 January 1946) *William Herbert (10 April 1867 ‚Äì 17 May 1867) *Walter (4 August 1868 ‚Äì 17 October 1951) *Gertrude (1870 ‚Äì 2 August 1905) *Eliza Madeleine (1872 ‚Äì 17 December 1949) His sons John and Walter also became physicians. He died at his home in London in 1907, following an eighth-month illness that began with pneumonia. His eldest son succeeded him in the baronetcy.

Aluminium conductor steel-reinforced cable (ACSR) is a type of high-capacity, high- strength stranded conductor typically used in overhead power lines. The outer strands are high-purity aluminium, chosen for its good conductivity, low weight, low cost, resistance to corrosion and decent mechanical stress resistance. The center strand is steel for additional strength to help support the weight of the conductor. Steel is higher strength than aluminium which allows for increased mechanical tension to be applied on the conductor. Steel also has lower elastic and inelastic deformation (permanent elongation) due to mechanical loading (e.g. wind and ice) as well as a lower coefficient of thermal expansion under current loading. These properties allow ACSR to sag significantly less than all-aluminium conductors. As per the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and The CSA Group (formerly the Canadian Standards Association or CSA) naming convention, ACSR is designated A1/S1A. Design The aluminium alloy and temper used for the outer strands in the United States and Canada is normally 1350-H19 and elsewhere is 1370-H19, each with 99.5+% aluminium content. The temper of the aluminium is defined by the aluminium version's suffix, which in the case of H19 is extra hard. To extend the service life of the steel strands used for the conductor core they are normally galvanized, or coated with another material to prevent corrosion. The diameters of the strands used for both the aluminum and steel strands vary for different ACSR conductors. ACSR cable still depends on the tensile strength of the aluminium; it is only reinforced by the steel. Because of this, its continuous operating temperature is limited to , the temperature at which aluminium begins to anneal and soften over time. Cable which relies entirely on the steel for strength, and so can be used at temperatures up to , is called aluminium-conductor steel-supported (ACSS). Steel core The standard steel core used for ACSR is galvanized steel, but zinc, 5% or 10% aluminium alloy and trace mischmetal coated steel (sometimes called by the trade-names Bezinal or Galfan) and aluminium-clad steel (sometimes called by the trade-name Alumoweld) are also available. Higher strength steel may also be used. In the United States the most commonly used steel is designated GA2 for galvanized steel (G) with class A zinc coating thickness (A) and regular strength (2). Class C zinc coatings are thicker than class A and provide increased corrosion protection at the expense of reduced tensile strength. A regular strength galvanized steel core with Class C coating thickness would be designated GC2. Higher strength grades of steel are designated high-strength (3), extra-high-strength (4), and ultra-high-strength (5). An ultra-high- strength galvanized steel core with class A coating thickness would be designated GA5. The use of higher strength steel cores increases the tensile strength of the conductor allowing for higher tensions which results in lower sag. Zinc-5% aluminium mischmetal coatings are designated with an \\"M\\". These coatings provide increased corrosion protection and heat resistance compared to zinc alone. Regular strength Class \\"A\\" mischmetal thickness weight coated regular strength steel would be designated MA2. Aluminium-clad steel is designated as \\"AW\\". Aluminium-clad steel offers increased corrosion protection and conductivity at the expense of reduced tensile strength. Aluminium-clad steel is commonly specified for coastal applications. IEC and CSA use a different naming convention. The most commonly used steel is S1A for S1 regular strength steel with a class A coating. S1 steel has slightly lower tensile strength than the regular strength steel used in the United States. Per the Canadian CSA standards the S2A strength grade is classified as High Strength steel. The equivalent material per the ASTM standards is the GA2 strength grade and called Regular Strength steel. The CSA S3A strength grade is classified as Extra High Strength steel. The equivalent material per the ASTM standards is the GA3 strength grade called High Strength. The present day CSA standards for overhead electrical conductor do not yet officially recognize the ASTM equivalent GA4 or GA5 grades. The present day CSA standards do not yet officially recognize the ASTM \\"M\\" family of zinc alloy coating material. Canadian utilities are using conductors built with the higher strength steels with the \\"M\\" zinc alloy coating. Lay Lay of a conductor is determined by four extended fingers; \\"right\\" or \\"left\\" direction of the lay is determined depending if it matches finger direction from right hand or left hand respectively. Overhead aluminium (AAC, AAAC, ACAR) and ACSR conductors in the USA are always manufactured with the outer conductor layer with a right- hand lay. Going toward the center each layer has alternating lays. Some conductor types (e.g. copper overhead conductor, OPGW, steel EHS) are different and have left-hand lay on the outer conductor. Some South American countries specify left-hand lay for the outer conductor layer on their ACSR, so those are wound differently than those used in the USA. Sizing ACSR conductors are available in numerous specific sizes, with single or multiple center steel wires and generally larger quantities of aluminium strands. Although rarely used, there are some conductors that have more steel strands than aluminum strands. An ACSR conductor can in part be denoted by its stranding, for example, an ACSR conductor with 72 aluminium strands with a core of 7 steel strands will be called 72/7 ACSR conductor.http://www.southwire.com/products/ACSR.htm Cables generally range from #6 AWG (\\"6/1\\" ‚Äì six outer aluminum conductors and one steel reinforcing conductor) to 2167 kcmil (\\"72/7\\" ‚Äì seventy two outer aluminum conductors and seven steel reinforcing conductors). Naming convention To help avoid confusion due to the numerous combinations of stranding of the steel and aluminium strands, code words are used to specify a specific conductor version. In North America bird names are used for the code words while animal names are used elsewhere. For instance in North America, Grosbeak is a (636 kcmil) ACSR conductor with 26/7 Aluminium/Steel stranding whereas Egret is the same total aluminium size (, 636 kcmil conductor) but with 30/19 Aluminium/Steel stranding. Although the number of aluminium strands is different between Grosbeak and Egret, differing sizes of the aluminium strands are used to offset the change in the number of strands such that the total amount of aluminium remains the same. Differences in the number of steel strands result in varying weights of the steel portion and also result in different overall conductor diameters. Most utilities standardize on a specific conductor version when various versions of the same amount of aluminum to avoid issues related to different size hardware (such as splices). Due to the numerous different sizes available, utilities often skip over some of the sizes to reduce their inventory. The various stranding versions result in different electrical and mechanical characteristics. Ampacity ratings Manufacturers of ACSR typically provide ampacity tables for a defined set of assumptions. Individual utilities normally apply different ratings due to using varying assumptions (which may be a result in higher or lower amperage ratings than those the manufacturers provide). Significant variables include wind speed and direction relative to the conductor, sun intensity, emissivity, ambient temperature, and maximum conductor temperature. Conducting properties In three phase electrical power distribution, conductors must be designed to have low electrical impedance in order to assure that the power lost in the distribution of power is minimal. Impedance is a combination of two quantities: resistance and reactance. The resistances of ASCR conductors are tabulated for different conductor designs by the manufacturer at DC and AC frequency assuming specific operating temperatures. The reasons that resistance changes with frequency are largely due to the skin effect, the proximity effect, and hysteresis loss. Depending on the geometry of the conductor as differentiated by the conductor name, these phenomena have varying degrees of affecting the overall resistance in the conductor at AC vs DC frequency. Often not tabulated with ACSR conductors is the electrical reactance of the conductor, which is due largely to the spacing between the other current carrying conductors and the conductor radius. The reactance of the conductor contributes significantly to the overall current that needs to travel through the line, and thus contributes to resistive losses in the line. For more information on transmission line inductance and capacitance, see electric power transmission and overhead power line. Skin effect The skin effect decreases the cross sectional area in which the current travels through the conductor as AC frequency increases. For alternating current, most (63%) of the electric current flows between the surface and the skin depth, Œ¥, which depends on the frequency of the current and the electrical (conductivity) and magnetic properties of the conductor. This decreased area causes the resistance to rise due to the inverse relationship between resistance and conductor cross sectional area. The skin effect benefits the design, as it causes the current to be concentrated towards the low- resistivity aluminum on the outside of the conductor. To illustrate the impact of the skin effect, the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard includes the conductivity of the steel core when calculating the DC and AC resistance of the conductor, but the (IEC) and The CSA Group standards do not. Proximity effect In a conductor (ACSR and other types) carrying AC current, if currents are flowing through one or more other nearby conductors the distribution of current within each conductor will be constrained to smaller regions. The resulting current crowding is termed as the proximity effect. This crowding gives an increase in the effective AC resistance of the circuit, with the effect at 60 Hertz being greater than at 50 Hertz. Geometry, conductivity, and frequency are factors in determining the amount of proximity effect. The proximity effect is result of a changing magnetic field which influences the distribution of an electric current flowing within an electrical conductor due to electromagnetic induction. When an alternating current (AC) flows through an isolated conductor, it creates an associated alternating magnetic field around it. The alternating magnetic field induces eddy currents in adjacent conductors, altering the overall distribution of current flowing through them. The result is that the current is concentrated in the areas of the conductor furthest away from nearby conductors carrying current in the same direction. Hysteresis loss Hysteresis in an ACSR conductor is due to the atomic dipoles in the steel core changing direction due to induction from the 60 or 50 Hertz AC current in the conductor. Hysteresis losses in ACSR are undesirable and can be minimized by using an even number of aluminium layers in the conductor. Due to the cancelling effect of the magnetic field from the opposing lay (right-hand and left-hand) conductors for two aluminium layers there is significantly less hysteresis loss in the steel core than there would be for one or three aluminium layers where the magnetic field does not cancel out. The hysteresis effect is negligible on ACSR conductors with even numbers of aluminium layers and so it is not considered in these cases. For ACSR conductors with an odd number of aluminium layers however, a magnetization factor is used to accurately calculate the AC resistance. The correction method for single-layer ACSR is different than that used for three-layer conductors. Due to applying the magnetization factor, a conductor with an odd number of layers has an AC resistance slightly higher than an equivalent conductor with an even number of layers. Due to higher hysteresis losses in the steel and associated heating of the core, an odd-layer design will have a lower ampacity rating (up to a 10% de-rate) than an equivalent even-layer design. All standard ACSR conductors smaller than Partridge ( {266.8 kcmil} 26/7 Aluminium/Steel) have only one layer due to their small diameters so the hysteresis losses cannot be avoided. Non-standard designs ACSR is widely used due to its efficient and economical design. Variations of standard (sometimes called traditional or conventional) ACSR are used in some cases due to the special properties they offer which provide sufficient advantage to justify their added expense. Special conductors may be more economic, offer increased reliability, or provide a unique solution to an otherwise difficult, of impossible, design problem. The main types of special conductors include \\"trapezoidal wire conductor\\" (TW) - a conductor having aluminium strands with a trapezoidal shape rather than round) and \\"self-damping\\" (SD), sometimes called \\"self- damping conductor\\" (SDC). A similar, higher temperature conductor made from annealed aluminium is called \\"aluminium conductor steel supported\\" (ACSS) is also available. Trapezoidal wire Trapezoidal-shaped wire (TW) can be used in lieu of round wire in order to \\"fill in the gaps\\" and have a 10‚Äì15% smaller overall diameter for the same cross-sectional area or a 20‚Äì25% larger cross-sectional area for the same overall diameter. Ontario Hydro (Hydro One) introduced trapezoidal-shaped wire ACSR conductor designs in the 1980s to replace existing round-wire ACSR designs (they called them compact conductors; these conductor types are now called ACSR/TW). Ontario Hydro's trapezoidal- shaped wire (TW) designs used the same steel core but increased the aluminium content of the conductor to match the overall diameter of the former round- wire designs (they could then use the same hardware fittings for both the round and the TW conductors). Hydro One's designs for their trapezoidal ACSR/TW conductors only use even numbers of aluminium layers (either two layers or four layers). They do not use designs which have odd number of layers (three layers) due to that design incurring higher hysteresis losses in the steel core. Also in the 1980s, Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) introduced TW designs where the size of the steel core was increased to maintain the same Aluminium/Steel ratio. Self-damping Self-damping (ACSR/SD) is a nearly obsolete conductor technology and is rarely used for new installations. It is a concentric-lay stranded, self-damping conductor designed to control wind induced (Aeolian-type) vibration in overhead transmission lines by internal damping. Self-damping conductors consists of a central core of one or more round steel wires surrounded by two layers of trapezoidal shaped aluminium wires. One or more layers of round aluminium wires may be added as required. SD conductor differs from conventional ACSR in that the aluminium wires in the first two layers are trapezoidal shaped and sized so that each aluminium layer forms a stranded tube which does not collapse onto the layer beneath when under tension, but maintains a small annular gap between layers. The trapezoidal wire layers are separated from each other and from the steel core by the two smaller annular gaps that permit movement between the layers. The round aluminium wire layers are in tight contact with each other and the underlying trapezoidal wire layer. Under vibration, the steel core and the aluminium layers vibrate with different frequencies and impact damping results. This impact damping is sufficient to keep any Aeolian vibration to a low level. The use of trapezoidal strands also results in reduced conductor diameter for a given AC resistance per mile. The major advantages ACSR/SD are: * High self-damping allows the use of higher unloaded tension levels resulting in reduced maximum sag and thus reduced structure height and/or fewer structures per km [or per mile]. * Reduced diameter for a given AC resistance yielding reduced structure transverse wind and ice loading. The major disadvantages ACSR/SD are: * There most likely will be increased installation and clipping costs due to special hardware requirements and specialized stringing methods. * The conductor design always requires the use of a steel core even in light loading areas. Aluminium- conductor steel supported Aluminium-conductor steel supported (ACSS) conductor visually appears to be similar to standard ACSR but the aluminium strands are fully annealed. Annealing the aluminium strands reduces the composite conductor strength, but after installation, permanent elongation of the aluminium strands results in a much larger percentage of the conductor tension being carried in the steel core than is true for standard ACSR. This in turn yields reduced composite thermal elongation and increased self- damping. The major advantages of ACSS are: * Since the aluminium strands are \\"dead-soft\\" to begin with, the conductor may be operated at temperatures in excess of without loss of strength. * Since the tension in the aluminium strands is normally low, the conductor's self-damping of Aeolian vibration is high and it may be installed at high unloaded tension levels without the need for separate Stockbridge-type dampers. The major disadvantages of ACSS are: * In areas experiencing heavy ice load, the reduced strength of this conductor relative to standard ACSR may make it less desirable. * The softness of the annealed aluminium strands and the possible need for pre-stressing prior to clipping and sagging may raise installation costs. Twisted pair Twisted pair (TP) conductor (sometimes called by the trade-names T-2 or VR) has the two sub-conductors twisted (usually with a left-hand lay) about one another generally with a lay length of approximately three meters (nine feet). The conductor cross-section of the TP is a rotating \\"figure-8\\". The sub-conductors can be any type of standard ACSR conductor but the conductors need to match one another to provide mechanical balance. The major advantages of TP conductor are: * The use of the TP conductor reduces the propensity of ice/wind galloping starting on the line. In an ice storm when ice deposits start to accumulate along the conductor the twisted conductor profile prevents a uniform airfoil shape from forming. With a standard round conductor the airfoil shape results in uplift of the conductor and initiation of the galloping motion. The TP conductor profile and this absence of the uniform airfoil shape inhibits the initiation of the galloping motion. The reduction in motion during icing events helps prevent the phase conductors from contacting each other causing a fault and an associated outage of the electrical circuit. With the reduction in large amplitude motions, closer phase spacing or longer span lengths can be used. This in turn can result in a lower cost of construction. TP conductor is generally only installed in areas that normally are exposed to wind speed and freezing temperature conditions associated with ice buildup. * The non-round shape of this conductor reduces the amplitude of Aeolian vibration and the accompanying fatigue inducing strains near splices and conductor attachment clamps. TP conductors can gently rotate to dissipate energy. As a result, TP conductor can be installed to higher tension levels and reduced sags. The major disadvantages of TP conductor are: * The non-round cross-section yields wind and ice loadings which are about 11% higher than standard conductor of the same AC resistance per mile. * The installation of, and hardware for this conductor, can be somewhat more expensive than standard conductor. Splicing Many electrical circuits are longer than the length of conductor which can be contained on one reel. As a result, splicing is often necessary to join together conductors to provide the desired length. It is important that the splice not be the weak link. A splice (joint) must have high physical strength along with a high electrical current rating. Within the limitations of the equipment used to install the conductor from the reels, as long of a length of conductor is generally purchased that the reel can accommodate to avoid more splices than are absolutely necessary. Splices are designed to run cooler than the conductor. The temperature of the splice is kept lower by having a larger cross-sectional area and thus less electrical resistance than the conductor. Heat generated at the splice is also dissipated faster due to the larger diameter of the splice. Failures of splices are a significant concern as a failure of just one splice can cause an outage that affects a large amount of electrical load. Most splices are compression-type splices (crimps). These splices are inexpensive and have good strength and conductivity characteristics. Some splices, called automatics, use a jaw-type design that is faster to install (does not require the heavy compression equipment) and are often used during storm restoration when speed of installation is more important than the long term performance of the splice. Causes for splice failures are numerous. Some of the main failure modes are related to installation issues, such as: insufficient cleaning (wire brushing) of the conductor to eliminate the aluminium oxide layer (which has a high resistance {a poor electrical conductor}), improper application of conducting grease, improper compression force, improper compression locations or number of compressions. Splice failures can also be due to Aeolian vibration damage as the small vibrations of the conductor over time cause damage (breakage) of the aluminium strands near the ends of the splice. Special splices (two piece splices) are required on SD-type conductors as the gap between the trapezoidal aluminium layer and the steel core prevents the compression force on the splice to the steel core to be adequate. A two-piece design has a splice for the steel core and a longer and larger diameter splice for the aluminium portion. The outer splice must be threaded on first and slid along the conductor and the steel splice compressed first and then the outer splice is slid back over the smaller splice and then compressed. This complicated process can easily result in a poor splice.http://classicconnectors.com/downloads/SD_Conductor_Concerns_for_Utilities.pdf Splices can also fail partially, where they have higher resistance than expected, usually after some time in the field. These can be detected using thermal camera, thermal probes, and direct resistance measurements, even when the line is energized. Such splices usually require replacement, either on deenergized line, by doing temporary bypass to replace it, or by adding a big splice over existing splice, without disconnecting. Conductor coatings When ACSR is new, the aluminium has a shiny surface which has a low emissivity for heat radiation and a low absorption of sunlight. As the conductor ages the color becomes dull gray due to the oxidation reaction of the aluminium strands. In high pollution environments, the color may almost turn black after many years of exposure to the elements and chemicals. For aged conductor, the emissivity for heat radiation and the absorption of sunlight increases. Conductor coatings are available that have a high emissivity for high heat radiation and a low absorption of sunlight. These coatings would be applied to new conductor during manufacture. These types of coatings have the ability to potentially increase the current rating of the ACSR conductor. For the same amount of amperage, the temperature of the same conductor will be lower due to the better heat dissipation of the higher emissivity coating.

() is a Greek football club based in Megara, Greece. It was founded in 1928. History Vyzas Megaron was founded in 1928 by students and named after the ancient Megara hero Byzas. In 1960, the club was promoted to Greece's Beta Ethniki, where it stayed for seven years. Vyzas was later promoted to Greece's top league, Alpha Ethniki, where it played for four years. Its best result was seventh. Between 1970 and 1975 and between 1979 and 1983, Vyzas played in Beta Ethniki. The team played for four years in Gamma Ethniki from 1983 to 1987.

During that season, the team finished 14th along with Larissa, later in the 2009‚Äì10 season, their 2nd place was tied with Kallithea. Vyzas played with Trikala, the 2nd team of the North group to the neutral stadium of Panionios at Nea Smyrni. Vyzas was losing 1‚Äì0 till 90th minute where the Megara team had a genuine chance, which was stopped by a handball, as Megarians said, but the referee gave nothing. Trikala won the game by 2‚Äì0 and the next season took part at Beta Ethniki. In 2011, the team finished 2nd in the South Group and entered the Football League where they remain until 2013 where they finished 19th.

The J-M Reef is the only known significant source of platinum group metals inside the United States and one of the significant resources outside South Africa and Russia. Associated by-product metals at the Company‚Äôs operations include minor amounts of gold, silver, nickel and copper. The J-M Reef is a narrow but extensive mineralized zone containing PGMs, which has been traced over a strike length of approximately . The company conducts mining operations at the Stillwater Mine near Nye, Montana and at the East Boulder Mine near Big Timber, Montana. Both mines are located on the J-M Reef. The company operates concentrating plants at each mining operation to upgrade mined production to a concentrate form. The company operates a smelter and base metal refinery at Columbus, Montana at which it further purifies the mined production to a PGM-rich filter cake. The filter cake is shipped to third-party custom refiners for final refining before being sold. The company recycles spent catalyst material to recover PGMs at the smelter and refinery. The company has a longterm catalyst sourcing agreement and spot contracts with other suppliers who ship spent catalysts to the company for processing to recover PGMs. The company smelts and refines the spent catalysts by the same process as the mined production is purified. Business Norilsk Nickel had bought a 51% stake in Stillwater in 2003, but in November 2010 Norilsk Nickel announced plans to sell this stake. Controversies In 2002, two class action suits were filed against the company, wherein stakeholders claimed that the Stillwater was artificially inflating the price of its securities. On Nov 1, 2004, Stillwater Mining restated its third quarter results, during which payment for debt issuance costs was $3.8 million, not a receipt of $0.8 million as originally reported. In 2006, a group of shareholders won a $2.6 million settlement against the company for \\"misleading statements about the company's financial performance\\" and its ore reserves. Acquisition Nornickel purchased Stillwater in 2003. In 2010 Nornickel put Stillwater up for sale. The South African mining company Sibanye Gold Limited proposed in December 2016 to acquire Stillwater for $2.2 billion ($18/share, a 61-percent premium over its average share price during the previous 52 weeks.)

The river is fed by a number of sources including springs from Biggin Moor, Great Hormead Brook, Little Hormead Brook and various field ditches, including the Braughing Bourne - the site of a former glacier from the Ice Age. It flows south, close to the B1368 road to the southwest of Braughing where it joins the River Rib at Gatesbury. This area was the site of a former Roman settlement.Braughing Official Website. URL accessed 9 June 2007. Until recently the river was diverted at this point to irrigate watercress beds before flowing into the Rib. The Quin Valley also includes the villages of Hare Street and Great Hormead as well as the smaller settlements of Hay Street and Dassels. The valley is shallow around the river with gently sloping sides at the northern end, becoming slightly narrower with steeper sides at the southern end of the area. Its sides are dominated by open arable farmland in small to medium fields with some occasional large fields particularly at the northern end. There is an absence of woodland and few mature trees grow alongside the river.Landscape Assessment of North Hertfordshire. URL accessed 9 June 2007. In Braughing, there are two ford crossings, one at Sheeps Lane and the other at Maltings Lane. The river is prone to severe flooding after heavy rain, rendering the fords impassable, particularly in the autumn and winter months. In 1922, a donkey and cart were swept away when its owner tried in vain to cross Sheeps Lane Ford. The animal was drowned.

Early life Coates was born in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England, the son of Joseph, a cordwainer, and his wife Ellen. While at Huddersfield College he gained medals for mathematics and classics and matriculated to the University of London. School Master Instead of taking up his university place Coates sailed to New South Wales in 1864 and became an assistant master at the newly founded Newington College, Sydney. In 1873 he moved to Fort Street School and after serving in schools at West Maitland and William Street, Sydney he became headmaster of Fort Street in 1876. He served only six months at Fort Street before briefly visiting England and in 1877 succeeding Dr Michael Howe as headmaster of Newington. During his six years there the college moved in 1880 from Silverwater to Stanmore and enrolments trebled. Under Coates's guidance the college established a high reputation for sport and for scholarship. He was the first captain in its cadet corps and in 1869 Newington became the first Australian school to play Rugby union in a match against the University of Sydney. Coates played in both the Rugby and cricket teams and was an important influence on two Old Newingtonians who were early members of the Australian cricket team - Tom Garrett and Edwin Evans. In September 1883 he successfully applied for the headmastership of the newly founded Sydney Boys' High School. Of the six public high schools begun in 1883 only three survived their early years, and the success of Sydney Boys' High School was due in large measure to Coates's dedication, leadership and inspiration. Several country boys were able to attend the school only because he took them as boarders in his own home. Despite a reputation as a stern disciplinarian he was highly esteemed and respected by his pupils, who responded to his deep knowledge of boys and to his rare gift for teaching. In 1892 High moved from Elizabeth Street, Sydney to a new site at Ultimo. Coates retired in June 1896 and after two severe strokes died at his home in Paddington. Cricketer Much of Coates's prestige with the boys derived from his prowess as a sportsman. To him a school was much more than an academy, and both at Newington and at Sydney High he gave every encouragement to sport, arranging matches with other schools and outside bodies. As captain of the New South Wales cricket team Coates played some thirty-two matches against other colonies and England. A sound batsman and fine slow bowler, he is credited with the introduction of the yorker in Australia. He was a founder and benefactor of the New South Wales Cricket Association and an original life member of the Sydney Cricket Ground.

The snack is also referred to as dried shredded cuttlefish. History and origins Historically, squid is common in Pacific coastal regions of East Asia and Southeast Asia. After the packaged form began shipping to English-speaking regions, the Japanese word surume and y√≥u y√∫ sƒ´ in Chinese for this form of seafood was translated as \\"dried shredded squid\\" and imprinted on packages. The snack was popularized, sold, and consumed regularly in Hong Kong during the 1970s. Shredded squid began being sold in Macau as an addition to their almond biscuit. In China, it is usually considered to be a light snack, sold in bags in many department stores in major cities. In Japan, dried shredded squid is popularly served as an otsumami (snack consumed while drinking alcohol). In Korean cuisine, dried shredded squid is eaten as anju (food to eat while drinking) and as banchan (small side dishes), such as the dish ojingeochae bokkeum, which is made by stir-frying dried shredded squid seasoned with a mixture of gochujang (chili pepper paste), garlics, and mullyeot (corn syrup-like condiment).https://web.archive.org/web/20090215050848/http://channel.patzzi.joins.com/article/article_dynamic.asp?aid=7514&Serv;=food&Sect1;=cook&Cont;= In Singapore, it was also popular amongst the older generation when it was sold in a Mama shop. It was marketed as the Chewing gum of the Orientals by the food manufacturing company Ken Ken in the 1970s, way before the chewing gum ban in Singapore in 1992. Preparation Thumb sized single strand Ojingeochae bokkeum, a Korean dish stir-fried in a sauce based on gochujang (chili pepper paste). Northern Pacific squid is separated into different parts and skinned; cooked at 65‚Äì80 ¬∞C for 3‚Äì5 minutes; and cooled, grated and seasoned at a temperature below 20 ¬∞C for more than four hours. Sugar, salt, sorbitol, sweeteners, organic acid, and MSG are typical additives.Doe, Peter E. [1998] (1998). Fish Drying and Smoking: Production and quality. CRC Press. They are then dried at 40‚Äì45 ¬∞C for 12‚Äì20 hours until it reaches a moisture level of 40%. It is then aged in a cold room for two weeks or longer and dried at a higher temperature of 110‚Äì120 ¬∞C for 3‚Äì5 minutes. It is then machine shredded and seasoned for a second time and dried again to a reduced moisture level of 25‚Äì27%. At this phase, the color is yellow or brownish. The amino acids on the squid are revealed by the increase in brown color over prolonged storage time. Vacuum packaging or nitrogen-filled packaging also increase browning. Consumers generally do not want excessive browning. Packaging The most common distribution method in today's Asian countries is the prepackaged format. The bags are usually sealed airtight to keep the squid chewy and tough. Depending on the company doing the packaging or preparation, each brand usually has its own ratio of MSG added. Unpackaged versions are much rarer than traditionally available in certain specialty shops, usually sold next to beef jerky. Cultural significance \\"Chewing gum of the Orientals\\" is the tagline for a Singaporean snack, Pon Pon, seasoned and prepared dried shredded squid. It was sold in the early 1960s in Singapore as Pon Pon, and later as Ken Ken, before the ban on chewing gum in Singapore in 1992. The concept stuck with Singaporeans. Many older Singaporeans grew up eating this cuttlefish snack before the advent of modern-day snacks such as chocolates and chips. Ken Ken Cuttlefish is still available in all the major supermarkets in Singapore. The Ken Ken prepared cuttlefish ‚ÄúChewing gum of the Orientals‚Äù is one of the nostalgic snacks which older Singaporeans remember, like White Rabbit (candy) and haw flakes. The snack was sold in mamak shops along the streets in Singapore. These were little provision stores that provided daily amenities and snacks to the community in olden Singapore. This was before the entrance of large chain supermarkets that caused rising competition towards the mamak shop's survival. Snacks like prepared cuttlefish that were popular amongst the older generation are slowly being phased out. The younger generation of Singaporeans is more westernised and less likely to form a taste for the traditional snack. The snack with its iconic green and white packaging was showcased in the Images of Singapore museum in Sentosa. Taste and texture Joe Distefano from The Village Voice describes it as ‚ÄúThe fibrous bits are just chewy enough to give your jaws a slight work out. A goodly amount of sugar, chili pepper, and salt help round out the funky fishiness.‚Äù Contamination News reports have claimed that arsenic and other toxic metals have been found in DSS packaged in Hong Kong.News Sina. \\"È¶ôÊ∏ØÊäΩÊ£ÄÂèëÁé∞Â§öÊ¨æÈ±øÈ±º‰∏ùÂê´ÊúâÁ†íÈúú.\\" Hong Kong shredded squid has arsenic.

Iran and Azerbaijan share, to a large extent, the same history, religion, ethnicity, and culture. The territory of what is now called the Republic of Azerbaijan was only separated from Iran in the first half of the 19th century, through the Russo-Persian Wars. In the area to the North of the river Aras, the territory of the contemporary Republic of Azerbaijan was Iranian territory until it was occupied by Russia. Iran and Azerbaijan are furthermore the only official Shia Muslim nations in the world where the vast majority of the people are Shia Muslims. They have respectively the highest and second highest Shia population percentage in the world,Juan Eduardo Campo,Encyclopedia of Islam, p.625 as well as the history of Shi'ism which is rooted in both nations from exactly the same moment in history, whereas the majority of the population of both their neighboring nations are either predominantly Christians or Sunni Muslims. However, in spite of this closeness, relationship between two countries is tense owning by previous historical hostilities. In 1918, the Musavat government adopted the name \\"Azerbaijan\\" for the newly established Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, for political reasons, even though the name of \\"Azerbaijan\\" had always been used to refer to the adjacent region of contemporary northwest Iran. As the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, a relatively downwards spiral started in the modern relations between Iran and Azerbaijan which lasted up to and including 2012, mainly commencing due to issues surrounding Azerbaijan's Nagorno-Karabakh conflict with Armenia. Iran, instead of backing up Azerbaijan, backed up Armenia, much to the anger of the Republic of Azerbaijan. However, recently since 2013‚Äì2014, relations have significantly re-improved with the advent of the Hassan Rouhani administration, who has since the start of his administration put efforts in making Azerbaijani-Iranian ties grow. In May 2015, the Ambassador of Iran to Azerbaijan announced that it didn't recognize the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, further boosting Azerbaijan‚ÄìIran relations. However, the sign of improvement has declined since Donald Trump came to power in the United States. Iran and Azerbaijan have had modern diplomatic relations since 1918. Iran recognized Azerbaijan's independence in 1991, and diplomatic relations between the two countries were established in 1992. Iran has an embassy in Baku and a consulate-general in Nakhchivan City. Azerbaijan has an embassy in Tehran and a consulate-general in Tabriz. Both countries are full members of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).  Context  For almost all of her history, the territory of the present-day Republic of Azerbaijan was a part of the various Iranian/Persian empires or Persianate empires, specifically during the reign of dynasties such as Median, Achaemenid, Parthians, Sassanid, the Shirvanshah, various dynasties of the Iranian Intermezzo, the Kara Koyunlu, the Ak Koyunlu, the Safavids, the Afsharids, the Zands, and the Qajars. The South Caucasus, in general, has been influenced by Iranian culture for thousands of years. In the course of the 19th century, following the occupation of the Caucasus by Russian troops during the Russo-Persian War (1804-1813) and Russo-Persian War (1826-1828), Qajar Iran was forced to cede what is now Azerbaijan, alongside Georgia, Dagestan, and Armenia to Imperial Russia under the terms of the treaties of Gulistan and Turkmenchay. Due to historical, cultural, ethnical, and religious ties, the Republic of Azerbaijan is considered as a part of Greater Iran.Encyclopaedia Iranica - \\"Caucasus and Iran\\" According to Pierre Thorez: \\"Although throughout history the Caucasus has usually been incorporated in political entities belonging to the Iranian world, at the beginning of the 19th century Russia took it, along with the Transcaucasus, from the Qajars (1133‚Äì1342/1779‚Äì1924), severing those historical ties. Since the establishment of Soviet power on Caucasian territory, relations with Persia have been reduced to an insignificant level.\\". According to Tadeusz Swietochowski, the territories of Iran and the republic of Azerbaijan usually shared the same history from the time of ancient Media (ninth to seventh centuries b.c.) and the Persian Empire (sixth to fourth centuries b.c.).Historical Background Vol. 3, Colliers Encyclopedia CD-ROM, 02-28-1996 During an official visit to Baku in October 2012, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad described his country's relations with Azerbaijan as ‚Äúbrotherly and very deep,‚Äù pointing to the countries‚Äô shared ethnic and religious heritage. A very large amount of ethnic Azerbaijanis populate the northwest region of Iran and are nowadays called native to the region, which is also called Azerbaijan, and both countries are majority Shia, while they hold the 1st and 2nd largest Shia adherents by population percentages in the world. As with almost their entire history, which is fully intertwined, the history of Shi'ism as the majority religion is rooted from exactly the same moment in history, dating back to the Safavid era. Representing two of only four Shia majority countries in the world, Azerbaijan and Iran share religious ties and a common border. Far more ethnic Azerbaijanis live in Iran (approximately 15-20 million) than in the Republic of Azerbaijan itself (approximately nine million), a result of the irrevocable forced cession by Qajar Iran of the territory that nowadays comprises Azerbaijan Republic to Imperial Russia in the course of the 19th century. Although Azerbaijan and Iran share strong historical and cultural connections, the countries are not natural allies. According to Alex Vatanka at the Middle East Institute in Washington, D.C., ‚ÄúAhmadinejad‚Äôs statement blatantly misrepresented the current state of affairs; today, it is not historical affinity but rather intense suspicion and rivalry that shape ties between Baku and Tehran. The same month Ahmadinejad made the statement, a court in Baku gave lengthy prison sentences to 22 Azerbaijanis charged with spying for Iran‚Äôs Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and plotting to carry out attacks against U.S. and Israeli targets in Azerbaijan.‚Äù  Relations from 1918‚Äì1920  In 1918, the Musavat government adopted the name \\"Azerbaijan\\" for the newly established Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, for political reasons, even though the name of \\"Azerbaijan\\" had always been used to refer to the adjacent region of contemporary northwest Iran. The decision to use the name Azerbaijan, drew some protests from Iran. Prior to the establishment of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, the name was only in use for the region of contemporary northwest Iran, namely Iranian Azerbaijan. Historically, the region of what is now the Azerbaijan Republic was known as Shirvan and Arran; two historically Iranian regions. According to Tadeusz Swietochowski:Tadeusz Swietochowski, Russia and Azerbaijan: A Borderland in Transition New York: Columbia University Press, 1995. pg 69 In 1919, Qajar Iran and Azerbaijan Democratic Republic did have some exchanges at governmental level. On 16 July 1919, the Council of Ministers [of ADR] appointed Adil Khan Ziatkhan, who had up to that time served as Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs, diplomatic representative of the republic of Azerbaijan to the court of the Persian King of Kings.\\"–í–Ω–µ—à–Ω—è—è –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏–∫–∞ –∫–æ–Ω—Ç—Ä—Ä–µ–≤–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤ –≤ –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–µ 1919-–≥–æ –≥–æ–¥–∞\\", –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω—ã–π –ê—Ä—Ö–∏–≤, No. 6 (37), 1929, p. 94. A Persian delegation headed by Seyyed Zia'eddin Tabatabaee came to Baku, to negotiate transit, tariff, mail, customs, and other such agreements. Speeches were made in which the common bonds between Caucasian Azerbaijan and Iran were stressed.Kazemzadeh, Firuz. \\"The Struggle for Transcaucasia: 1917‚Äì1921\\", The New York Philosophical Library, 1951, p. 229. In 1920, the Bolshevik 11th Red Army conquered the Caucasus and the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic became Azerbaijan SSR. In 1922, Azerbaijan SSR was incorporated into the Soviet Union, and from that point till 1991, the relations between Iran and Azerbaijan continued in the context of the Soviet- Iranian relations. However, after World War II, the Azerbaijani Ministry of Foreign Affairs could issue limited visas for travel to Iran only and Iran also maintained a consulate in Baku.  Relations from 1991 up to including 2012  Membership of OIC, relations with Israel and alienation of Iran Stamp of Azerbaijan, 1992 Iran was one of the first countries to establish full diplomatic relations with Azerbaijan. Following the declaration of the Parliament of Azerbaijan to restore independence of Azerbaijan Republic on October 18, 1991 and in early December 1991, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati visited Baku, where he signed a number of agreements on political, economic, and cultural cooperation and pledged to support Azerbaijan's membership in the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (now the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation). Within the few days after the visit, Iran recognized Azerbaijan on January 4, 1992, upgraded its consulate in Baku to establish full diplomatic relations.James P. Nichol. Diplomacy in the Former Soviet Republics, Praeger/Greenwood, 1995, , p. 150 Tehran was quick to recognize Azerbaijan as an independent state and set out to create amicable relations with a country similar to its own. Iran saw Azerbaijan as fertile ground for spreading its Islamic Revolution further. Azerbaijan was skeptical of Iran's theocratic government and looked instead to Turkey as a strategic partner. ‚ÄúIran‚Äôs initial euphoria at the prospect of a new Shia state quickly turned into dread, as Baku expressed irredentist sentiments and promoted the idea of a ‚ÄòGreater Azerbaijan,‚Äô which would unite Azerbaijan (the country) and Azerbaijan (the region in northwest Iran). Fearing Baku's intentions to fuel secessionism inside its borders, Iran provided vital backing to Armenia in its war against Azerbaijan over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, which dragged on from 1988 to 1994 and ended in an inconclusive cease-fire.‚Äù Iran‚Äôs siding with Armenia during the Nagorno-Karabakh War has not been forgotten in Azerbaijan, and Tehran‚Äôs support of Armenia‚Äîespecially in light of Azerbaijan‚Äôs recent growth in power projection‚Äîhas not abated. Azerbaijan‚Äôs power is growing primarily because of the influx of oil and gas revenues emanating from the Caspian Sea. Recognizing this, Iran has sought to reengage its northern neighbor and nudge Baku to reconsider its foreign relations‚Äîprincipally its close ties with Israel‚Äîbecause nowhere in the region does Iran see a more unambiguous Israeli footprint than it does in Azerbaijan. ‚ÄúIsrael and Azerbaijan share the common goal of containing Iranian influence. In this joint front, Azerbaijan provides proximity to Iran‚Äîwith much ion about Azerbaijani soil being used as a staging ground for Israeli military operations‚Äîwhile Israel possesses superior weapons technologies and other resources.‚Äù In February 2012, Azerbaijan signed a $1.6 billion defense deal with Israel that included air defense systems, intelligence hardware, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Azerbaijan is aware that its overtures and agreements with Israel anger Iran, but its response is that Iran's strong ties with Armenia anger Azerbaijan. ‚ÄúWhen Tehran has appealed to Azerbaijan‚Äôs Islamic identity, the Azerbaijanis quickly point out that Tehran‚Äôs relations with Armenia have been trouble-free compared with its ties with its Muslim neighbors.\\" Abulfaz Elchibey After the rise of Popular Front of Azerbaijan to power in June 1992, the newly elected President Abulfaz Elchibey endorsed the unification of the Azerbaijani populations of his country and Iranian Azerbaijan, and to that end, autonomy for the Iranian Azerbaijanis, a stance which alienated the Iranian government. According to Svante Cornell: He also states:Svante Cornell. Iranian Azerbaijan: A Brewing Hotspot Elchibey was against the breakup of his own nation based on ethnic lines, stating \\"Armenians have been living in Azerbaijan for centuries, and as full citizens of the state - just like the Lezgins, Tats, and Talyish...let them continue to live here as equal citizens before the law - but they must obey the laws of the state, no country would demand any less.Goltz, Thomas. Azerbaijan Diary. M.E. Sharpe. Published in 1998, page 63 He also denounced Iran's peace efforts during the Nargorno-Karabakh conflict, claiming Iran was attempting to give Armenia the advantage. However, during Nagorno-Karabakh War, Iran pressured Armenia and Karabakh Armenians to halt the offensive. Veiled threats first appeared in the English-language Kayhan International: This statement was followed by official warnings from the Iranian Foreign Ministry, accompanied by military reinforcements along Iran's borders with Azerbaijan and Armenia.\\"–°–æ—Å—Ä–µ–¥–æ—Ç–æ—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≤–æ–π—Å–∫ –Ω–∞ –∏—Ä–∞–Ω–æ-–∞–∑–µ—Ä–±–∞–π–¥–∂–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–µ –≤—ã–∑—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç —Ç—Ä–µ–≤–æ–≥—É\\", Izvestia, Moscow, September 4, 1993, p. 2 Iran also gave financial aid to Nakhchivan and pressured Armenia to refrain from attacking the enclave.S. Cornell, \\"Small nations and great powers: A Study of Ethnopolitical Conflict in the Caucasus\\", Richmond : Curzon Press, 2001, p. 325 In 1992, Elchibey, during a visit to Turkey, described himself as a soldier of Atat√ºrk and called for the downfall of Iran, which prompted a member of the Iranian parliament to threaten retaliation.Alaolmolki, Nozar. Life After the Soviet Union. published in 2001 page 50. Since then however, the two nations have had better relations, although tensions have sometimes been high, cooperating in areas including trade, security, and the energy sector. However, some tensions include the growing relationship between the United States, Israel, and Azerbaijan, Caspian Sea territorial issues, and Iran's support for Armenia. President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan had said that he did not support a United States attack against Iran. Novruz Mamedov, Azerbaijani presidential international affairs department head in 2005, has also said that Azerbaijan would not allow the United States to build bases within Azerbaijani territory and would not help in an attack against Iran. There were incidents involving of the use of force or its demonstration on the part of Iranian military forces. On July 23, 2001, an Iranian warship and two jets forced a research vessel working on behalf of British Petroleum (BP)-Amoco in the Araz-Alov- Sharg field in the sector of the Caspian Sea which is claimed by Iran. On February 22, 2007 Azerbaijani media outlets reported that Iranian helicopters had violated the air space of Azerbaijan by flying over the southern town of Astara for over 20 minutes. Reportedly, the flight took place right over the city administration building and caused considerable panic among the local residents.Jamestown, Eurasia Monitor, March 2, 2007 But for the most part Azerbaijan and Iran avoided any serious military clashes. In May 2005 Baku and Tehran signed a non-aggression pact barring third countries from using their territories for offensive operations against each other. In March 2006, during the World Congress of Azerbaijanis convention in Baku, a number of participants addressed both the concept of a \\"unified Azerbaijan\\" and \\"human rights abuses\\" against Azeris in Iran. A diplomatic controversy occurred when Iran's ambassador to Azerbaijan, Afshar Suleymani, an Azeri himself, expressed indignation concerning the views of some speakers who advocated the union of \\"southern\\" and \\"northern\\" Azerbaijan. Certain anti-Iran claims during an official seminar in Baku were harmful to relations between the two countries and were especially against the interests of the Republic of Azerbaijan. According to Karl Rahder, \\"Most analysts agree that the Iranian government has attempted to infiltrate Azerbaijan with agents and fifth column sleeper cells to weaken Azerbaijan from within for many years.\\"Karl Rahder. The Southern Azerbaijan problem, ISN Security Watch, 19/04/07 Opposite views stress on Azerbaijan's territorial claims over Iran.to receive part of Iran, and Armenia ‚Äì Nagorno Karabakh?\\" Baku has unofficially agreed to take part in anti-Iranian coalition President Ilham Aliyev's attitude of calling Iranian Azeris \\"Azerbaijanis who live in Iran\\"http://www.cfr.org/publication/10547/conversation_with_ilham_aliyev_rush_transcript_federal_news_service_inc.html \\"QUESTIONER: Hasan Hazar, Turkish daily Turkiye. Mr. President, you know, there are more than 20 million Azeris living in Iran. So my question is about that. What is Azerbaijan‚Äôs policy toward south Azerbaijan? ALIYEV: Azerbaijanis live in many countries. Recently we had the Second Congress of World Azerbaijanis. And according to our estimations, there are more than 50 million Azerbaijanis who live around the world, and about 30 million of them live in Iran. And of course all of them‚Äîtheir destiny for us is very important. When I visit other countries, I always meet representatives of the Azerbaijani community, because really Azerbaijanis live, as I mentioned, in many countries. We try to be helpful to their needs. We try to maintain good relations with the countries where Azerbaijanis live, so that their lives become better. \\"http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/11/0f418e0f-3f21-4ae3-8f3e-bceeb1c4be40.html Aliyev told EU officials today that Baku is unhappy that the Azeri language is banned from schools and the media in Iran. has angered some in the Iranian Azeri community. The last time that a minister of the Azerbaijan republic referred to Iranian Azeri's in that manner, the representative of Ardabil province in the Iranian parliament protested. Collaborative-conflicting energy issues In 2010, a memorandum of understanding and co-operation in the field of energy and transport was signed in Baku. On December 20, 2005 Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliev and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad attended the opening ceremony of a new gas pipeline from Iran to Azerbaijan's landlocked Nakhchivan Autonomous Region, which is separated from the mainland of Azerbaijan by a strip of Armenian territory. Nakhchivan has been cut off from gas supplies as a result of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict over Nagorno- Karabakh. Under a 25-year swap contract signed between the two countries in August 2004, the new pipeline will supply the region with Iranian natural gas. Azerbaijan will also deliver its gas to Iran's northeastern provinces. The volume of gas imports to Nakhchivan is expected to reach 250 million cubic meters in 2006 and 350 million cubic meters in 2007. On March 19, 2007, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran joined President Robert Kocharyan of Armenia to inaugurate a gas pipeline to pump Iranian natural gas to Armenia. Armenia is Azerbaijan's arch-foe. Iran's anti-Azerbaijain media broadcastes On February 3, 2007 Azerbaijan's minister of communications and information technology, Ali Abbasov, and the head of the Iranian State Broadcasting Agency, Ezzatollah Zarghami, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on bilateral media cooperation. Previously, Azerbaijan urged Iran to cease its \\"broadcasting and unauthorized transmission of Iranian Sahar-2 television into Azerbaijan\\" and \\"criticized the Azeri-language broadcasts beamed into southern Azerbaijan for containing \\"anti-Azerbaijani propaganda\\" aimed at destabilizing the southern regions of the country, and faulted the Iranian government for \\"interference in Azerbaijan's internal affairs. Iranian officials have claimed that the broadcasts are beyond their control, as Sahar-2 is a privately owned station and merely expresses \\"its own position\\" in its programs\\". Israeli anti-Iran listening posts in Azerbaijain In a Washington Institute for Near East Policy analysis, analysts Soner Cagaptay and Alexander Murinson alluded to reports that Israeli intelligence maintains listening posts along the Azerbaijani border with Iran.http://www.meforum.org/article/987 Israel and Azerbaijan's Furtive Embrace Bilateral tension with Iran On the 12th of April 2007, Azerbaijan handed Hadi Sid Javad Musavi, an Iranian citizen affiliated with the Southern Azerbaijan National Awakening Movement, to the Iranian authorities. In October 2007, according to Human Rights Watch, an eight-and-a- half-year prison sentence was handed down to Eynulla Fatullayev, editor of Azerbaijan's two largest independent newspapers, for terrorism and other charges. The terrorism and inciting ethnic hatred charges derive from an article Fatullayev wrote in Realni Azerbaijan, in which he argued that the government's support of the United States‚Äô position on Iran makes Azerbaijan vulnerable to attack from Iran, and he speculated on likely targets of such an attack. In December 2007, Court consideration on the cases of Novruzeli Mammadov, Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences Linguistics department chief, editor-in-chief of Tolishi sado newspaper and linguist Elman Guliyev, official of was started in the Court of Grave Crimes. The two were accused of receiving 1000 US dollars from Talish organizations in Iran after their newspaper published articles showing Persian poet Nizami and Iranian historical hero Babak Khoramdin as Talysh. Also in another incident in December 2007, the Court for Grave Crimes on sentenced 15 members of so-called Said group and its alleged leader, Said Dadashbeyli to lengthy prison sentences convicting them of treason and passing information on Israeli, U.S., and British activities in Azerbaijan Republic to Iranian intelligence. The Iranian government summoned the Azeri ambassador to Tehran to protest the claims and called them \\"baseless\\" accusations. Azerbaijan's reel of Eurovision Song Contest 2009 depicted the Maqbaratoshoara, a famous monument and a symbol of the Iranian city of Tabriz and the northwest region of Iran, shown among Azerbaijani national monuments. This has been perceived by many Iranians as a violation of Iranian territorial integrity and as an evidence that Azerbaijan Republic has claims on Iranian territory.Eurovision Song Contest 2009 (May 16, 2009).

Victoria Dementyeva. APA. 11 November 2009. Azerbaijan's president Aliyev has stated that he supports the U.S. sanctions against Iran. In a meeting with U.S. officials in Baku in February 2010 Aliyev expressed his support and also criticized European oil and gas companies for sabotaging the international sanctions regime. This information came out in one of the released diplomatic cables of the United States diplomatic cables leak in November 2010. According to STRATFOR Iran has politically and financially supported the Islamic Party of Azerbaijan (AIP), a pro-Iranian and religious Shiite opposition party officially banned by Baku. The leader of the AIP, Movsum Samadov, has called for the overthrow of the Azerbaijani government. Hezbollah's activities in Azerbaijan Despite Azerbaijan being a majority Shi'a country, decades of conflict with Iran has also led a huge legacy of this tension, and it is also expanded to other Iran-backed groups' attitude toward Azerbaijan, notably Hezbollah, a Lebanese Shi'a militant group. Hezbollah members had been arrested in 2009 following a failed attempt by Hezbollah members to blow up the Israeli embassy in Baku, Azerbaijan.https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-may-30-fg- shadow30-story.html  Iran-Azerbaijan visa free regime  Building of the Iranian embassy in Baku Azerbaijan agreed to a visa free regime with Turkey while Iran also demanded a visa free regime with Azerbaijan. Iran had threatened to cut off the critical supply line between Azerbaijan and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic if Azerbaijan lifts the visa requirements for the Turks, but does not extend the same privilege to Iranian citizens.  Deterioration of relations in 2012  In 2012, three men were detained by the Azerbaijan Ministry of National Security for planning to attack Israelis employed by a Jewish school in Baku. Security officials in Baku linked Iran to the planned terror operation. The men allegedly received smuggled arms and equipment from Iranian agents, possibly in retaliation to the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists. Wafa Guluzade, a political commentator close to the Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, warned Iran that \\"planning the murder of prominent foreign citizens in Azerbaijan by a band of terrorists, one of whom [Dadashov] resides in Iran, amounts to 'hostile activity' against our country.\\"Shvindler, Eli. Azerbaijan thwarts terror attack against Israeli, Jewish targets. Haaretz. January 2012 Iranian-Azeri relations deteriorated further after the Azeri Communication Minister, Ali Abbasov accused Iran of carrying out cyber attacks against the country. In March 2012 Azerbaijan arrested 22 people on suspicion of plotting attacks on the U.S and Israeli embassies in Baku on behalf of neighboring Iran. The ministry said that the suspects were recruited from 1999 onwards and trained in the use of weapons and spy techniques at military camps in Iran to enable them to gather information on foreign embassies, organizations and companies in Azerbaijan and stage attacks. All 22 were found guilty and given jail terms of at least a decade.\\"Azerbaijan jails 22 Iranian-hired spies who plotted attack on Israeli, U.S. targets.\\" Haaretz Newspaper, 9 October 2012.

The plan apparently involves using an Israeli tanker aircraft painted in the colors of a third country airline company that would land and refuel in Azerbaijan and then refuel the Israeli strike aircraft.Grove, Thomas. \\"Azerbaijan eyes aiding Israel against Iran.\\" Reuters, 30 September 2012. Iranian officials objected to Azerbaijan hosting the Eurovision 2012 Song Contest, claiming that Azerbaijan was going to host \\"a homosexual parade\\". Ali Hasanov, head of the public and political issues department in Azeribaijani President's administration, said that gay parade claims were untrue, and advised Iran not to meddle in Azerbaijan's internal affairs. In response, Iran recalled its ambassador from Baku, while Azerbaijan demanded a formal apology from Iran for its statements in connection with Baku's hosting of the Eurovision song contest, and later also recalled its ambassador from Iran.  Significant re-improvement of relations: 2014‚Äì2016  Presidents of Azerbaijan and Iran, Aliyev and Rouhani, seen here at the 4th Caspian Sea Summit in 2014. With the advent of Hassan Rouhani as president of Iran in late 2013, relations between the two neighbouring countries have gradually but significantly improved. In December 2014, Iran announced it would launch a bus service between the cities of Ardabil and Baku. The Iranian spokesman of the Ardabil provincial department of Transport and Terminals called launching the service a necessity, saying every year over 600,000 passengers visit Ardabil from the Azerbaijan Republic and Iranian provinces. In April 2015, Iran and Azerbaijan announced their decision to form a joint defense commission; a move that may indicate a conspicuous geopolitical shift in the South Caucasus. In May 2015, deputy chief of foreign relations at the Secretariat of the Supreme Leader of Iran's Islamic Revolution Mohsen Qomi has expressed his country's readiness to support Azerbaijan. He told chairman of Azerbaijan's State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations Mubariz Gurbanli who visited Tehran, ‚ÄúWe are ready to support Azerbaijan at any time‚Äù. Mr Qomi described Azerbaijan as ‚Äúa friendly and fraternal‚Äù country for Iran. He said Iran's Supreme Leader attaches great importance to expanding relationship with Muslim countries, especially Azerbaijan. In May 2015, the two countries also discussed the prospects for cooperation between Azerbaijan and Iran in the petrochemical sector. The two nations also have planned to expand their cooperation in tourism. The sides are expected to sign a document on tourism cooperation, the Iranian tourism organization reported. Several more treaties and accords related to the expansion of cultural, economical, strategical, and cooperations on joint defense were signed as of 2015, or were announced to be signed in the near future. Speaking about relations with Iran in May 2015, President Ilham Aliyev said the Iranian-Azerbaijani friendship is unbreakable and no extraneous force can split it. Aliyev further states that: Iran has also announced several times that it might join the TANAP project which will carry Azerbaijani gas to Turkey, statements which Azerbaijan has supported. In May 2015, the Ambassador of Iran to Azerbaijan announced that it doesn't recognize the self-proclaimed ‚ÄúNagorno-Karabakh Republic‚Äù. He further stated that: ‚ÄúThere is no country called Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and the Islamic Republic of Iran does not recognize such ‚Äúa country‚Äù. Of course, we don't recognize the ‚Äúelections held there‚Äù. Nearly one million Azerbaijani tourists visit Iran every year, a number which is continuing to increase steadily. Iran has abolished its visa regime for the neighboring Republic of Azerbaijan since 2010, and increased the number of visa free days from 15 to 30 days as of November 2015. Regarding Azerbaijan‚ÄìIran relations, President Aliyev stated that: \\"Our relations are being built on this solid basis and today, the Iranian-Azerbaijan relations have grown into the strategic cooperation and have never been in a such high level.\\"  Returning to tensions: 2016 onward  However, the effort of improving relations between the two countries was damaged with Donald Trump's rise to become President of the United States. Soon after Trump announced the United States recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and ordered the planning of the relocation of the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Azerbaijan voiced its recognition to Israel's position in Jerusalem, and Azerbaijan's returning anti-Iranian rhetoric remarks had a negative impact on the Azerbaijan‚ÄìIran relations.https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-iran-tensions- azerbaijan-officials-visit-israel-1.6112935 Furthermore, in spite of Iran's action not recognizing Artsakh, Azerbaijan was accused for continuing to sponsor pan-Turkist separatists within the country.http://isdp.eu/content/uploads/2017/09/2017-souleimanov-kraus-irans- azerbaijan-question-in-evolution.pdf In 2018, Azerbaijan suspended oil and gas trade with Iran in support to the United States' re-sanctions on Iran, which prompted hostility among Iranian Government over Azerbaijan.http://www.turan.az/ext/news/2018/11/free/politics%20news/en/76358.htm In 2019, Azerbaijan voiced support to the U.S.-led conference over Middle East held in Warsaw, sending delegations to participate on the February 2019 Warsaw Conference, further strained the once-already tensions between two countries.https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2019/02/15/mike- pompeos-shambolic-summit-in-warsaw The other issue also highlighted by the strong Azerbaijan‚ÄìTurkey relationship, with both being Turkic nations and supporting each other. After Turkey launched a military offensive into Northern Syria, in particular to Idlib, Azerbaijan has supported Turkish military intervention, while Iran has denounced the intervention.https://www.sabah.com.tr/dunya/2020/02/03/azerbaycandan- idlibdeki-sehitler-icin-bassagligi-mesaji Despite these unsettled tensions, Azerbaijan donated $5 million of financial aid to Iran in its fight against the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020 underlying the thaw of relations between these two countries and to defuel tensions that has still existed between two nations. Moreover, on April 7, Heydar Aliyev Center was illuminated with Iranian flag in solidarity with Iranians in fighting coronavirus pandemic. This soon soured when Azerbaijan accused Iran of sending trucks supplying Karabakh Armenian forces in the same month.https://eurasianet.org/iranian- trucks-in-karabakh-spark-protest-in-azerbaijan During the July 2020 Armenian‚ÄìAzerbaijani clashes, Azerbaijan and Armenia were invited by Iran to restraint.https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/450134/Iran-says-ready-to-mediate- between-Azerbaijan-and-Armenia However, Azerbaijani leadership has expressed its open distrust, due to Iran's alliance with Armenia and Russia, which is also referred into a proxy war between Russia and Turkey.https://www.voanews.com/europe/azerbaijan-armenia-clashes-highlight- turkey-russia-rift When hostility resumed again between Azerbaijan and Armenia in September, Azerbaijan accused Iran of tacit support for Armenia while Iran denied these accusations and stated its act to make peace in Karabakh.https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/5/iran- nkhttps://www.intellinews.com/iran-denies-allowing-passage-of-weapons-into- armenia-after-video-emerges-on-social-media-192945/?source=iran Diplomacy ;Republic of Azerbaijan *Tehran (Embassy) *Tabriz (Consulate-General) ;Republic of Iran *Baku (Embassy) *Nakhchivan (Consulate-General)  See also  *Azerbaijan‚ÄìIran border *Azerbaijan‚ÄìTurkey relations *Iran‚ÄìTurkey relations  References  Iran Category:Bilateral relations of Iran Category:Relations of colonizer and former colony ","title":"Azerbaijan‚ÄìIran relations"},{"id":"11687515","text":"David Primo (; born 5 May 1946 in Bulgaria) is a former Israeli international footballer who was part of the squad that competed at the 1970 World Cup, Israel's only world cup appearance.

He is best known as the lead vocalist and frontman of the bands Gods Child, Joe 90, and Low Stars, and as producer and co-writer for the neo-soul band Fitz and the Tantrums. Career Gods Child (1992‚Äì1996) Seefried's U.S. career started when a cassette tape of \\"Everybody's 1\\" was heard by Prince, who stopped the song midway through, ejected the tape and declared \\"this is mine\\". That song and four other psychedelic rock and soul tracks found their way to legendary artist, producer, musician and then record company president Quincy Jones and his A&R; man Hugo Burnham, drummer from English post-punk band Gang of Four. After flying to New York City to see Gods Child perform one of many shows at New York's CBGB, they signed the band to Warner Bros. Records via Quincy's imprint label Qwest. The band's first record, Everybody, was written and produced by Seefried with bandmate Gary DeRosa under the pseudonym \\"Bullfrog and the Elephant\\". The single \\"Everybodys 1\\" charted on two Billboard charts simultaneously, peaking at #18 on the Mainstream Rock chart and #25 on the Modern Rock chart. While making videos for songs \\"Everybody's 1\\", \\"Stone Horses\\" and \\"Slide\\", Gods Child toured nationally, headlining shows in New York City at Irving Plaza and Roseland Ballroom. They performed \\"Everybody's 1\\" on NBC's Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Their second record, Aluminum, produced by Tim Palmer, was critically acclaimed, but the singles \\"Female Elvis\\" and \\"This Is the Real World?\\" only charted regionally. The song \\"Need\\" was featured on the Fox Network television series Melrose Place. Joe 90 (1996‚Äì2000) After two albums with Warner Bros., Seefried moved to Los Angeles and changed the band's name from Gods Child to Joe 90, adding Adam Hamilton to the mix. Adam Duritz of Counting Crows signed the group to his imprint through Geffen Records. Their debut record Dream This includes the hit song \\"Drive\\", which Duritz sings on. Seefried returned the favor, guesting on \\"I Wish I Was a Girl\\"' and hit song \\"Hangin' Around\\" from This Desert Life. Joe 90 performed this song live with Counting Crows on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Their second album, A Raccoons Lunch, features the Laura Nyro song \\"And When I Die\\", which was the end title for the New Line Cinema film Final Destination, and \\"When You Arrive\\" from the soundtrack for the film Boys and Girls. The band's third record remains unreleased. Solo/Low Stars (2000‚Äìpresent) Seefried recorded solo debut Denim Blue in between touring as Rosanne Cash's guitar player. It was recorded in studios in New York City and Los Angeles, and includes a cast of friends, Gary DeRosa (Gods Child, Joe 90), Tony Shanahan (Patty Smith), Richard Lloyd (Television), as well as co- producers David Immergluck (Counting Crows) and Rich Pagano (Fab Faux). Denim Blue, completed in 2005, was held back because Seefried started southern California rock band Low Stars, whose debut album used tracks \\"Child\\", \\"Tracks In the Rain\\" and \\"L.A. Forever\\", previously slotted for Denim Blue. Low Stars' eponymous debut album was produced by George Drakoulias and was released in 2007 at Starbucks stores throughout the country through Hear Music. Low Stars performed songs \\"Calling All friends\\", the theme song that appears at the beginning of each episode of J. J. Abrams' show What About Brian, and \\"Child\\", on Last Call with Carson Daly. They capped a national tour with a performance of \\"One Step Up\\" at Carnegie Hall to celebrate the music of Bruce Springsteen. Denim Blue was released through Seefried's record label \\"Gnome Alone\\" in 2008. The songs \\"Hand of Fate\\" and \\"You Make Me\\" were included in the Tomothy Bogart film Touched. Production/songwriting Seefried produced and co-wrote Fitz and The Tantrums' EP Songs for a Breakup, Vol. 1 which was recorded during the first half of 2009 at Fitzpatrick's home in Los Angeles. He also produced and co-wrote their debut studio album, Pickin' Up the Pieces, released in August 2010, which received critical acclaim and reached No. 1 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart.[ Fitz & the Tantrums] at Billboard.com They were heralded as a \\"band to watch\\" in an April 2011 profile in Rolling Stone. In 2012 Seefried produced Anderson East's self-released debut album, Flowers of the Broken Hearted. The album was released on vinyl and consisted of two records: one which he recorded in Los Angeles with session players Charlie Gillingham, Don Heffington and Rob Wasserman, and one recorded in Nashville with Tim Brennan and Daniel Scobey. Each record has its own genre; the white disc, mostly written and produced by Seefried, has a progressive soul and Americana vibe, while the red disc is darker and has more of a rock sound. Seefried composed four songs on the Fitz and The Tantrums release More Than Just a Dream, released on May 7, 2013 on Electra/Atlantic records. Jessica Sager of Pop Crush wrote, \\"three unreleased Lana Del Rey songs have also emerged. 'Boarding School', co-written and produced by Chris Seefried, has a 1960s vibe and describes, in vivid detail, Del Rey's past alcohol and drug use ‚Äî she even describes \\"smoking crack in the back\\". To say it's as dark as her new hair color is an understatement, but the tune and melody are actually laidback and fun, which makes the track all the more intriguing and effective. It perfectly encompasses the 'gangsta Nancy Sinatra' Del Rey longs to embody.\\" Seefried co- wrote two songs and produced one on Cheers to the Fall, the first studio album by Andra Day. Warner Bros. Records alongside Buskin Records released the album on August 28, 2015. Day worked with Adrian Gurvitz, Raphael Saadiq and Seefried in the production of this album. The album was nominated for Best R&B; Album at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards.

The term is derived from the Arabic word for \\"spring\\", which is used in the Indian subcontinent, where it is the spring harvest (also known as the \\"winter crop\\").The opposite of rabi crops are the kharif crops which are grown after, the rabi and zaid (zaa-id) crops are harvested one after another respectively. Etymology The words kharif and rabi have their origins in Arabic. These came to be used in India with the ascent of the Mughal empire in the Indian subcontinent and have been widely used ever since. Rabi season The rabi crops are sown around mid- November, preferably after the monsoon rains are over, and harvesting begins in April / May. The crops are grown either with rainwater that has percolated into the ground, or using irrigation. A good rain in winter spoils the rabi crops but is good for kharif crops. The major rabi crop in India is wheat, followed by barley, mustard, sesame and peas. Peas are harvested early, as they are ready early: Indian markets are flooded with green peas from January to March, peaking in February. Many crops are cultivated in both kharif and rabi seasons. The agriculture crops produced in India are seasonal in nature and highly dependent on these two monsoons.Sowing time of Rabi & Kharif crop agropedia  Common rabi crops  Cereals * barley * gram * rapeseed * mustard * oat (Avena sativa) * wheat (Triticum aestvium) * Bajra (Pennisetum glaucum) * Linseed * Fruits List as follows.

It was created in 1856 after a series of petitions were sent to the Colonial Office in London protesting the Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company‚Äôs proprietary rule over the colony. It was the first elected assembly in British North America west of Ontario. Although at first only handful of colonists met the voting requirement, and most of those that did were tied to the HBC, the franchise was gradually extended, and the assembly began to assert demands for more control over colonial affairs, as well as criticize colonial governor Sir James Douglas's inherent conflict of interest as both governor and Hudson Bay Company's chief factor. History In an attempt to minimize the influence of the assembly he had been ordered to establish, Governor James Douglas, who described himself as \\"utterly averse to universal suffrage, or making population the basis of representation,\\"Duffus set an unusually high property requirement of for voters. The island was divided into four districts, and the assembly consisted of eight members: one from each of Nanaimo and Sooke, two from Esquimalt, two from Metchosin and three from Victoria. In the election on July 22, 1856, Victoria, which had the greatest number of qualified voters at five, was the only district contested. The power of the Assembly was severely limited. Despite the protests of newspapermen such as Amor de Cosmos, Douglas appointed the members of his government according to his own agenda, regardless of who dominated the Assembly. The governor also maintained control over the legislative process through the Legislative Council, an upper house of a sort that had its members appointed directly. However, the Assembly did have one significant power: it had to approve any use of public funds. The colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia were joined into a new single colony, the United Colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia, in 1866, and the Legislative Assembly of Vancouver Island ceased to exist. Its role was filled in the new colony by the Legislative Council of British Columbia. Leaders and parties John S. Helmcken, Speaker of the House of Assembly Dr. John Sebastian Helmcken, chosen as the first Speaker of the Assembly, would remain in that role until British Columbia joined Canadian Confederation in 1871. He was Douglas's son-in-law, and like his fellow assemblymen Surveyor-General Joseph Despard Pemberton and HBC company-man Joseph McKay, was considered part of what Amor De Cosmos termed the \\"family-company compact\\". John Muir, a sawmill-owner and coalmaster who represented Sooke, had also recently been in the employ of Douglas. James Yates, the Victoria publican, and Thomas Skinner, the farmer, were the voices of dissent in the assembly, always at odds with the company and its men. As franchise widened and the assembly became more influential, this division remained. Reformers such as Amor de Cosmos and Leonard McClure, who began to truly challenge the power of Douglas and his successor Arthur Edward Kennedy, continued to butt heads with establishment supporters such as George Hunter Cary, Henry Pering Pellew Crease and Robert Burnaby and William Fraser Tolmie.

The bascule bridges are on the far left The Van Brienenoord Bridge (Dutch: Van Brienenoordbrug) is a large twin tied-arch motorway bridge in the Netherlands. Located at the east side of Rotterdam, it crosses the New Meuse (Nieuwe Maas), a major distributary of the river Rhine. The bridge actually consists of two separate, parallel, and almost identical arch-bridges, as well as a set of three parallel bascule bridges on the north end. The bridge carries 12 lanes of traffic of the A16 motorway, the busiest highway in the Netherlands. Additionally, on the outside of the east arch, a two-way segregated cycling bridge has been mounted. Including lead-up ramps, the Van Brienenoord Bridge is 1320 metres long and vessels with up to 24 metres air draft can pass under the closed bridge. With a span of 300 m, the west arch is the longest span road bridge in the Netherlands. Traffic exceeds 235,000 vehicles crossing the bridge daily,https://www.rijkswaterstaat.nl/wegen/projectenoverzicht/a16-renovatie- van-brienenoordbrug/index.aspx using four 3-lane carriageways, in an express versus local / distributor arrangement. 300px|thumb|Looking at the twin bridge from the south, it's hard to tell that one of the twins is 25 years older than the other. Each bridge arch carries two roadways ‚Äì the inner with three lanes of express traffic; and an outer with another three local / distributor lanes. History The east arch (287.5 m long) was built in 1965, constituting the original Van Brienenoord Bridge.https://structurae.net/en/structures/van- brienenoordbrug In 1990 the bridge received a major upgrade, by the addition of a second, almost identical arch (305 m long and slightly broader) right next to its west flank, doubling its traffic capacity.https://structurae.net/en/structures/van-brienenoordbrug-1990 The bridge is named after the Eiland van Brienenoord (Isle of Brienenoord) in the river, on which some of its pillars are built. The little island was named after its former owner, baron Arnoud Willem van Brienen van de Groote Lindt in 1847. The Dutch suffix oord means a place. The bridge operator's house and radar on the north-east corner are defunct since 2005 An average of 150.000 ships pass the bridge every year. Approximately 500 of these ships require the bridge to be opened, a process which takes 18 minutes total. Suspending road traffic and opening the bridge takes 4 minutes, letting the ship pass takes 10 minutes, and closing the bridge requires another 4 minutes. During this time, road traffic is blocked by boom barriers. As of November 2005, the bridge is no longer controlled locally but from the nearby city of Rhoon, where the region's Road Traffic Control is located. A request to open the bridge for shipping needs to be made at the harbor authorities at least three hours in advance. An electro-mechanical failure on 17 March 2006 left the bridge open for about an hour, on the middle of day, causing traffic jams up to 7 kilometres in length. The western bridge was closed first, restoring traffic to Breda. The eastern bridge was closed at approximately 1 AM, restoring traffic to The Hague and Utrecht. On 5 November 2006 it failed to close again, this time due to an electrical failure, forcing engineers to close the bridge manually.

In addition to fighting the regular German army he also frequently encounters bizarre Nazi experiments concerning biomechanical technology and the occult.  Biography  Blazkowicz was born in August 1911 in the United States to Polish-American father Rip Blazkowicz and Jewish American mother Zofia Blazkowicz, and grew up near Mesquite, Texas. During World War II, B.J. became a sergeant in the U.S. Army Rangers, before receiving his commanding officer's commission and being recruited as the top agent for the United States Office of Secret Actions (OSA), a fictional version of the Office of Strategic Services, who dispatched him to investigate rumors of occult activity by the Third Reich's SS Paranormal Division (inspired by the real-world Ahnenerbe institute and the Thule Society). B.J. is a large, muscular man with dark-blonde hair, blue eyes and a strong jaw. He is 191 cm tall (6'3.25), and weighs in at 111 kg (245 lbs). The original timeline states that after World War II, in 1951 he married Julia Marie Peterson and reared a son named Arthur, who married a lady named Susan Elizabeth McMichaels and then came to have their own son who is the namesake of his grandfather. He would eventually star under a pseudonym, Billy Blaze, throughout the entire Commander Keen series. Billy Blaze later became the father of Doomguy, protagonist of the Doom series. In the MachineGames timeline, he married Anya Oliwa; and fathered twin daughters, Jessie and Zofia, that continued to battle Nazis in the 1980s. In video games B.J. as seen in Wolfenstein 3D (1992) and Wolfenstein: The New Order (2014) B.J. Blazkowicz entered the Wolfenstein series with Wolfenstein 3D in 1992. The motion comic series created to promote 2009's Wolfenstein claims a continuous (partially retconned) timeline with Wolfenstein 3D, Spear of Destiny, Return to Castle Wolfenstein, and finally Wolfenstein (later continued in Wolfenstein: The New Order, Wolfenstein: The Old Blood and Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus). The missions that Blazkowicz participates in include assassinating a series of fictional leaders of German bio-chemical warfare research programs and eventually killing Adolf Hitler himself in Wolfenstein 3D, defeating the Nazi plot to use the Spear of Destiny to summon the Angel of Death in Spear of Destiny, and foiling Heinrich Himmler's ritual to resurrect Heinrich I (a historical king from medieval German history, here portrayed by an evil necromancer) in Return to Castle Wolfenstein wherein he also finds out about Wilhelm \\"Deathshead\\" Strasse's plan to create an army of undead cyborgs. In 2009's Wolfenstein, he returns to fight the resurgent Fourth Reich's use of a highly destructive energy of great power from the parallel world known as the Black Sun dimension, which is again pitting him against Deathshead. The New Order establishes a new timeline that alters the previously perceived post-war profile, where Captain Blazkowicz suffers a head injury in 1946 that leaves him in a vegetative state for 14 years in a Polish asylum. In 1960, Blazkowicz awakens from his vegetative state as he is about to be executed, and joins the resistance against the Nazis who have conquered the whole world and who include his old nemesis Wilhelm \\"Deathshead\\" Strasse. This storyline is continued in The New Colossus which directly follows up on the last events of The New Order where Blazkowicz nearly dies of grenade fragmentation injuries in the final battle but promptly gets evacuated by Anya Oliwa and the surviving Kreisau resistance members under the helm of Caroline Becker. Blazkowicz spends the next five months in a coma as a result of his grave wounds. In the intro of The New Colossus, the player experiences memories of Blazkowicz's struggles during his youth with his abusive father. When Blazkowicz wakes up from his coma, he finds himself in an Kreisau occupied Nazi undersea vessel that is being attacked by the Nazis as Frau Engel has been hunting him down and effectively has taken over the commanding role after General Deathshead was assassinated by Blazkowicz. Following the long history of Nazi killings, B.J. Blazkowicz was rightfully nicknamed 'Terror Billy' by Nazi Order which becomes more apparent as the story progresses. In the past five months, The United States of America has surrendered to the Nazi Order and it's up to the Kreisau circle to gather the thinly stretched underground Nazi resistance groups all over the United States. Also in The New Colossus, an NPC lady Ritva Tuomivaara calls him on an elevator platform with pet name Blazkowiczi, making him sound more similar with Finns like her whose names tend to end to a vowel. In the spinoff Youngblood, an aged Blazkowicz goes missing and it's up to his daughters to track him down and rescue him. Wolfenstein RPG is set in an alternate timeline, which is mostly light-hearted and humorous, and serves as prequel to the Doom series. At the end, B.J. defeats and maims the Harbinger of Doom, a Nazi-summoned demon that is none other than the later Cyberdemon from Doom. Blazkowicz's descendant is Sergeant Stan Blazkowicz, the protagonist of Doom RPG and one of the protagonists of Doom II RPG. B.J. Blazkowicz himself was also supposed to star in an early sequel Rise of the Triad: Wolfenstein 3D Part II, which was eventually released as just Rise of the Triad with no Wolfenstein plot connection at all. Other appearances In the 2005 German film Der Goldene Nazivampir von Absam 2 ‚Äì Das Geheimnis von Schlo√ü Kottlitz, William B.J. Blazkowicz, portrayed by Daniel Krauss, tracks down Nazi scientists in secret laboratories located in the Austrian Alps in order to disclose the secret of \\"miracle weapons\\" involving Dracula's bones and to find that events occurring in the Kottlitz Castle are beyond imagination. In 2007, Samuel Hadida bought the rights to make a more direct adaptation of the game series and Roger Avary was given task to write and direct the project that was said to be the story of B.J. Blazkowicz's mission to Hitler's Wolf's Lair. In May 2012, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Wolfenstein 3-D, Bethesda Softworks released a free B.J. Xbox Live Avatar masks over on the series' Facebook page. Classic B.J. Blazkowicz Mask was made a purchasable item for Doom at Xbox Live Marketplace. In June 2017, Blazkowicz was added to Quake Champions as a playable champion. His in-game abilities include dual gun wielding and limited auto-healing. In 2019, in the movie Doom: Annihilation, a group of Marines travel to a base on a moon of Mars. The first body they find is identified as \\"William Blazkowicz\\", a Marine stationed on the base. In a nod to the Wolfenstein game, his body was decapitated, alluding to the events of Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus, when his decapitated head was placed on a German synthetic body to resurrect him. The Marine that finds him also comments on having to tell Blazkowicz's family about his death, a vague reference to his descendants.  Reception  The character has been well received. In 2008, IGN included B.J. Blazkowicz on the list of characters they would like to see in an ultimate fighting game, calling him \\"the soldier who fired the first shot in the first- person-shooter wars\\", as well as in an ultimate \\"zombie strike team\\" of the best zombie fighters in entertainment. IGN also listed him as first on a list of top commandos in video games, as \\"really, there's no greater victory for a commando than killing Hitler. Kudos, Blazkowicz.\\" In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as 93rd \\"most memorable, influential, and badass\\" protagonist in video games, stating that \\"when you‚Äôve single handedly defeat Mecha-Hitler, that pretty much makes you a hero in anybody‚Äôs book. B.J. has tirelessly slaughtered Nazis through three generations of hardware, and could be credited with kicking off the first-person shooter craze that led to games like Doom and Duke 3D.\\"100 best heroes in video games, GamesRadar, October 19, 2012 UGO.com featured Blazkowicz on the list of the greatest Jews in gaming: \\"Being the Nazi-hating son of Polish immigrants does make B.J. a candidate, but his Judaism remains woefully unconfirmed. For all the Nazis he's chain-gunned through, B.J. deserves a framed honorary Jew certificate.\\" The website Jew or Not Jew opined \\"he's probably just a Nazi-killing Pole.\\" Kotaku's Stephen Totilo wrote that \\"the hints are\\" in The New Order that Blazkowicz is Jewish, such as his knowledge of written Hebrew. When Totilo contacted Bethesda Softworks, they told him it is \\"never explicitly stated\\" and the developer MachineGames decided to \\"leave it up to the player to interpret.\\" The character's designer, Tom Hall, later confirmed that Blazkowicz's mother was Jewish. According to Spike's Jason Cipriano, \\"The New Order seems to be the first game that really gives the character some depth, and instead of just being another American, hell-bent on ending the Nazi regime Blazkowicz seems like he's a more multilayered character. B.J. has friends, a love interest, and a deeper reason to take down the Nazis: this time around he's not just trying to win a war - he's trying to save the world.\\" Anthony John Agnello of The A.V. Club noted MachineGames strived \\"to render Blazkowicz as a whole human being‚Äîat least, as human as he can be when he‚Äôs killing literally thousands of people, robots, dogs, and robot dogs.\\" GamesRadar's Ryan Taljonick opined B.J. [has become] a pretty interesting character, and delivers several internal monologues with just the right amount of drama\\" while Brian Bloom's \\"fantastic voicework makes them believable.\\" In his review of The New Order, Lee Cooper of Hardcore Gamer wrote that \\"where it succeeds beyond the basest point is in its execution of characters, particularly Blazkowicz himself, who offers no more depth than porta potty but somehow manages to shine as leading man\\" and \\"the grittiest, manliest, most absolute Nazi-killin‚Äô machine.\\" See also *Doomguy *Duke Nukem (character) *Gordon Freeman  References  Category:Fictional American people in video games Category:Fictional Polish Jews Category:Fictional Polish-American people Category:Fictional characters from Texas Category:Fictional military captains Category:Fictional patricides Category:Fictional American Jews in video games Category:Fictional revolutionaries Category:Fictional sergeants Category:Fictional United States Army Rangers personnel Category:Fictional victims of child abuse Category:Fictional World War II veterans Category:Fictional Nazi hunters Category:Fictional people sentenced to death Category:Fictional characters with post-traumatic stress disorder Category:First-person shooter characters Category:Horror video game characters Category:Male characters in video games Category:Science fiction video game characters Category:Fictional secret agents and spies in video games Category:Fictional mass murderers Category:Fictional soldiers in video games Category:Fictional terrorists Category:Wolfenstein Category:Video game characters introduced in 1992 Category:Bethesda characters ","title":"B.J.

He was twice commandant at Michilimackinac. Background Lignery was the son of Joseph le Marchand de Lignery and Marguerite Du Sillar. He began his military career in 1675 as a lieutenant in the R√©giment d'Auvergne. In 1683, he transferred to the navy, serving as a midshipman at Rochefort. In 1687, he went to Canada as a lieutenant on half-pay. He was made a knight of the Order of Saint Louis in 1728. He married Anne Robutel de La Noue, daughter of the seigneur de √éle Saint-Paul, on November 10, 1691 in Montreal. They had seven sons and two daughters. The best known of these was Fran√ßois-Marie Le Marchand de Lignery, a captain in the colonial regular troops and knight of the Order of Saint-Louis. In the summer of 1759, this son was fatally wounded by the English in fighting near Fort Niagara. At Michilimackinac He fought in the Iroquois War, where his service was recognized by his superiors. In 1688, he was promoted to lieutenant, and in 1705 to captain. In 1712, at the beginning of a 25-year war between the French and the Foxes, Canadian Governor Philippe de Rigaud de Vaudreuil sent him to reoccupy the former post of Michilimackinac, which had been abandoned by royal orders in 1696. War against the Foxes A few years later, in 1715, acting Governor Claude de Ramezay placed him in command of a major expedition against the Foxes. He was ordered to assemble a force of coureurs de bois. and northern Indians and lead them to the Chicago portage. This force would join a second force, recruited among the Indians of the southern Great Lakes, and move together against the Foxes. However, due to a series of mishaps -- the supply convoy from Montreal did not arrive on time and the French volunteers were unruly and hard to discipline -- the southern contingent never assembled; neither did Lignery and his army reach the assembly point. On December 1, 1715, a Fox war party led by Pemoussa (He Who Walks) attacked the French expedition along the Chicago lakefront, driving the French and their Indian allies back toward Michigan. Lignery returned to the command of Michilimackinac in 1722 after an absence of about three years. The Foxes were again at war with the French, attacking whites and natives in the Illinois country, a part of Louisiana. Louisiana, however, was a different colony from Canada, and Lignery and Vaudreuil adopted a policy of conciliation to preserve the peace in the west. In 1724, Lignery negotiated a treaty with the Foxes that ended their war on the Chippewas but allowed the war on the Illinois Indians to continue. Although Lignery denied it, officials in Louisiana and France felt that Vaudreuil and Lignery had sacrificed the southern colony to keep it from sharing in the western fur trade. Two years later, acting Governor Charles Le Moyne de Longueuil sent Lignery back to Baie des Puants (Green Bay) to renegotiate the treaty. At a council on June 7, 1726 he was able to obtain a promise from the Foxes not to make war on any of the French allies. 1728 expedition against the Foxes A new governor, Charles de la Boische, Marquis de Beauharnois, arrived in New France in 1726. In August 1728, he sent Lignery, recently promoted to major, in command of an army of 450 Frenchmen and 1,000 Indians against the Foxes. This was the largest force ever to advance so far into the interior, but it failed to secure a decisive engagement with the enemy. Lignery arrived at the fortified Fox village at the mouth of the Fox River on August 17. Here and elsewhere during the campaign, the Foxes fled to the west; the French could do no more than burn their villages and their crops. The expedition continued up the Fox River as far as the Wisconsin River portage before retracing their steps. Governor Beauharnois blamed Lignery for the failure to defeat the Foxes. He made serious accusations against him in his report to the ministry, and Jean-Fr√©d√©ric Ph√©lypeaux, comte de Maurepas ordered him tried by a council of war. Lignery was accused of mismanaging supplies, of having been so slow in pursuit that the Foxes were able to make good their escape, of refusing to turn over command to his lieutenant in spite of having a debilitating illness, and of having abandoned large quantities of supplies at Michilimackinac on the return trip to Canada. After hearing witnesses and reviewing other evidence, the council of war unanimously dismissed the charges. Lignery died a short time later, in 1731 or 1732 (sources differ) in Trois-Rivi√®res, where he had been named town major in 1728.

Construction and launch Originally she was to be named Prinsendam, however during construction, Holland America Line decided to name their new flagship Nieuw Amsterdam, in honor of the Dutch settlement of New Amsterdam, modern-day New York. Construction on the new liner was carried out at the N.V. Rotterdam Drydock Company. Christened by Queen Wilhelmina in April 1937, Nieuw Amsterdam was, at 36,982 tonnes, the largest liner ever constructed in the Netherlands up to that time. Proudly she was dubbed the Dutch \\"Ship of peace\\" since there were no provisions for possible war use incorporated in her design. At the time Nieuw Amsterdam was more completely protected against fire, had the largest air conditioning plant and the highest percentage of private baths of any ship afloat. The ship was also the only liner with a fully equipped and air conditioned theater. Interior The Nieuw Amsterdam was the Netherlands' \\"ship of state\\", just as the Normandie was France's, the Queen Mary was Britain's and United States was the United States', and numerous Dutch artists vied for the honor of creating some part of the ship. The first-class dining room aboard the Nieuw Amsterdam Their creation emerged in the spring of 1938, a light-colored and very spacious ship throughout, and although she had spacious public rooms, the colour scheme used gave her an even larger feel. Modern in every way, her owners proclaimed her \\"the ship of tomorrow\\". She followed the Art Deco trend of the day in both interior decorations and exterior design. The interiors were distinguished by fluorescent lighting, aluminum motifs, and gentle pastels throughout the ship that created an understated elegance that would make the liner a favorite among seasoned transatlantic passengers.Designing Liners: A History of Interior Design Afloat by Anne Massey One of the ship's centerpieces was the first class restaurant, having a Moroccan leather ceiling which was adorned by numerous Murano glass light fixtures, and columns covered in gold leaf. Tinted mirrors, ivory walls and satinwood furniture all contributed to create the luxurious atmosphere. The restaurant had no portholes or windows facing the open sea, making it depend solely on artificial illumination, a feature it shared with the first class restaurant on board the Normandie of 1935.Great Luxury Liners 1927‚Äì1954, A Photographic Record by William H. Miller, Jr. There also were two swimming pools on board, one outdoor and the other indoors on E-deck, featuring expensive Delft tiling. The Nieuw Amsterdam was the second ship in the world after the Normandie to boast a theater, a feature the larger and faster Queen Mary did not initially have. The deeply cushioned seats commanded an unobstructed view of the stage, and the egg-shaped contour of the auditorium took advantage of the latest in scientific sound-proofing materials and amplifying equipment to ensure perfect acoustics for concerts, dramatic performances and pre-release motion pictures. Found at the front end of the Theatre was a striking mural in red, black and gold by Reyer Stolk. A favorite rendezvous of many Nieuw Amsterdam passengers was the handsome First Class Smoking Room with its rich Circassian walnut paneling and deep, luxurious armchairs and settees. Flanked by two enclosed sun verandas extending to the sides of the ship, the Smoking Room had its own modern bar stocked with a connoisseur choice of fine liquors. First Class staterooms on the Nieuw Amsterdam were unusually attractive, ranging in size from cozy single person cabins to elaborate cabins-de-luxe. The handsome and modern decorative scheme made the cabins comfortable spots for daytime and evening relaxation. All First Class cabins on Nieuw Amsterdam had a private bathroom, a unique feature which no previous liner could boast. Early career On April 23, 1938, the Nieuw Amsterdam set out on her sea trials, which were to take place on the North Sea. Testing her speed and manoeuvring capability, the new vessel turned out to be all that she was supposed to be. Upon her return from the sea trials, the Nieuw Amsterdam was transferred to Holland America ownership and officially registered in the Dutch merchant fleet. The new liner's maiden voyage was on May 10, 1938, with arrival in New York May 17 with return begun May 21. Nieuw Amsterdam acclaim with titles such as \\"Ship of the Year\\" and, due to some features such as fire resistance, air conditioning and accommodations, \\"Ship of Tomorrow\\" by some. Although she was neither as large or fast as many of her contemporaries, she was to be a popular liner for the Dutch and was showered with superlatives. Her sleek outline and two slim funnels provided a striking profile and she soon garnered a loyal following amid stiff competition from great liners such as Cunard's Queen Mary and the superb Normandie of the French Line. Despite the fierce competition, Nieuw Amsterdam proved to be one of the few money-making vessels of the day.Picture History of German and Dutch Passenger Ships by William H. Miller, Jr. Wartime service RMS Queen Mary in the background during the two ships' involvement in Operation Pamphlet The Netherlands‚Äô ‚Äúship of peace‚Äù was not to enjoy the praise lavished on her for long. After only seventeen voyages, Nieuw Amsterdam was laid up at Hoboken, New Jersey in 1939 after the German invasion of Poland. She would be idle for only a year, however, and was requisitioned by the British Ministry of Transport after the Netherlands fell to Hitler‚Äôs armies. She would spend the remainder of the war years as a transport for troops and prisoners of war, despite the fact she had been constructed without the consideration of ever being used in a military capacity. Nieuw Amsterdam, with a nominal troop capacity of 6,800 and speed of over 20 knots, was among the British-controlled \\"monsters\\" ‚Äì high-capacity, high-speed troop ships capable of sailing unescorted due to their speed, and thus critical to the build up in Britain for the invasion of the Continent. During the course of the conflict she transported over 350,000 troops and steamed around before being returned to the Holland America Line in 1946. Directly after the war, she spent time repatriating Dutch citizens from the then-Dutch East Indies. Refitting the Nieuw Amsterdam The Nieuw Amsterdam triumphantly returned to her home port of Rotterdam on April 10, 1946. Fifteen weeks were required to remove the troop fittings: the special kitchens, alarm systems, hammocks, and 36 guns. Then 2,000 tons of furniture and decorations were shipped to the Netherlands from wartime storage in San Francisco. The furnishings were for the most part in very poor condition, a result of six years of neglect. About 3,000 chairs and 500 tables were sent back to their original builders for reupholstering and refinishing. One quarter of the furnishings had to be replaced entirely. Factories and warehouses in Europe combed their supplies for materials and fabrics, much of which had been concealed from the Nazis during the occupation. Many smaller parts, such as hinges and clamps, had to be made by hand, since the machinery that once made them had been stolen or destroyed by the enemy. The entire rubber flooring was renewed, as was nearly all of the carpeting. All of the steel work was scaled and preserved and all piping cleaned. All ceilings and floors were removed; all of the liners 374 bathrooms were rebuilt. In the passenger spaces the wood paneling, which had been scratched and mutilated, was sanded down to half its thickness and relacquered. All the cabin's closets and fixtures were replaced. The entire electrical wiring system was renewed. Having been painted over for blackouts and cracked in tropical climates, of glass was refurbished. Even the hand rails had to be repolished to eradicate thousands of carved initials. The project was monumental, because of the material shortages and the decline of the number of skilled craftsmen. On October 29, 1947, after 18 months at the shipyard, the Nieuw Amsterdam reentered transatlantic service. Postwar career and demise The Nieuw Amsterdam as a cruise ship The refit took eighteen months and cost more than her original construction, but on October 29, 1947, the Nieuw Amsterdam was finally back on the transatlantic run. Her passenger accommodations had been slightly altered, and the ship emerged with a gross tonnage some 400 tons larger than before, ending up at 36,667. Rotterdam drydocked in Rotterdam, November 1963 For the next twenty years Nieuw Amsterdam would enjoy a loyal following and financial success. Even when joined by a more contemporary fleet mate in 1959, the SS Rotterdam, the Nieuw Amsterdam still commanded a loyal following and remained one of the most popular ships on the north Atlantic. Her several refits in the 1950s ensured she remained in top condition and continued service despite her being near thirty years of age. In 1967 severe boiler problems seemed to indicate an end to the venerable liner's career, however new US Navy surplus boilers were installed during a sixteen-week shipyard period at Wilton-Fijenoord in Schiedam and her career continued. Painting of the Nieuw Amsterdam In the same decade jet travel had made continued Atlantic passenger runs impractical, so Nieuw Amsterdam was shifted to cruising in the Caribbean. Soon escalating operating cost and competition from newer cruise vessels meant an end to the grand liner's service career. Nieuw Amsterdam had been an enduring icon on the North Atlantic for the better part of three decades‚Äîcertainly her refined interiors and impeccable service added much to her appeal. The ship sailed to the breakers in 1974.

Web. 14 Jan. 2013. was an American journalist, author, editor, and suffragist, now remembered primarily for having edited the first two novels of Sinclair Lewis, and for her relationship with Henry James, especially for recruiting him to participate in the round-robin novel The Whole Family. She was editor of Harper's Bazaar from 1900 to 1913. Life and work Jordan was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to William Frank Jordan and Margaretta Garver, and was the first of their two daughters. She graduated from high school in 1884. After learning shorthand at business school, she began her journalistic career as women's page editor at Peck's Sun. She then worked as a secretary to the Milwaukee superintendent of schools while contributing to the St. Paul Globe and Chicago Tribune. In 1890, Jordan moved to New York City and began working at Joseph Pulitzer's newspaper, the New York World. Her first big break was an interview with the normally reticent First Lady Caroline Scott Harrison, wife of President Benjamin Harrison. At the World she became known for her regular Sunday human interest feature \\"True Stories of the News\\". Major stories she covered included the trial of Carlyle Harris for the murder of his wife Helen Potts and the trial of accused ax murderer Lizzie Borden. She also wrote a series of articles about conditions in New York City tenements that was later published as the book The Submerged Tenth. In 1895, she published a collection of short stories, many of them inspired by her work, called Tales of the City Room. In 1897 she was appointed assistant Sunday editor of the World. From 1901 to 1913, she was editor of the magazine Harper's Bazaar. During those years she published a number of novels and short story collections. These included a popular series of novels featuring the heroine May Iverson. Her play The Lady of Oklahoma premiered on Broadway at the 48th Street Theatre in April 1913. During this period, she is perhaps best remembered for organizing a collaborative novel called The Whole Family, about the middle class Talbert family from New England. Each of her co-authors, some of them novelists of some renown like Henry James and William Dean Howells, penned one of the twelve chapters. The novel was serialized in Harper's from 1907 to 1908. After the sale of Harper's to William Randolph Hearst, she remained at Harper and Brothers as literary advisor until 1918. In that capacity, she edited the first novel by Sinclair Lewis, Our Mr. Wrenn (1914). While his first novel required extensive revision with her assistance, his second, The Trail of the Hawk (1915), required no editorial intervention. She also helped publish novels by a number of female authors, including Zona Gale, Eleanor H. Porter, and Dorothy Canfield Fisher. Jordan was an active suffragist and in 1917 organized another collaborative novel, The Sturdy Oak, with fourteen authors supporting the cause, including Fannie Hurst, Dorothy Canfield Fisher, Mary Heaton Vorse, Alice Duer Miller, Ethel Watts Mumford, Henry Kitchell Webster and William Allen White. The novel was serialized in Collier's Weekly. She also collaborated with minister and women's movement leader Anna Howard Shaw on Shaw's autobiography, The Story of a Pioneer (1915). In 1918, she was briefly editorial director for Goldwyn Pictures. She spent the rest of her career writing. Two of her novels were adapted for film: Daddy and I (1934) as Make Way for a Lady (1936) and The Girl in the Mirror (1919) as The Girl in Number 29 (1920). She published a memoir, Three Rousing Cheers, in 1938. She died at her home in New York City and was buried in Florence, Massachusetts.

Egnatius, the freedman of Soranus, being enamoured of Servilia, conspires against his master and Trasea, and intimates to Servilia that her submission alone will secure their safety. Valerius has mysteriously disappeared, and Servilia, becoming a convert to Christianity, renounces the World. Called before the tribunal, Trasea and Soranus are sentenced to banishment, while Servilia is awarded to Egnatius. Valerius now returns, bearing a proclamation from Nero that the tribunal is dissolved. The sudden reappearance of her lover causes Servilia's death, and Valerius is only prevented from destroying himself by the intervention of his foster-father. Egnatius, in his woe, invokes the Divine Being, and the rest join him in acclaiming the Christian God.Source: \\"The Opera Glass\\", Stanford University, from M.

Founded in February 1969 as the American Board of Family Practice (ABFP), the group was the 20th medical specialty to be recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties and was formed out of a need to encourage medical school graduates to enter general practice. It adopted its current name in 2005. The American Board of Family Medicine is the second largest medical specialty board in the United States. Its purposes include: * Improving the quality of medical care available to the public * Establishing and maintaining standards of excellence in the specialty of family medicine * Improving the standards of medical education for training in family medicine * Determining by evaluation the fitness of specialists in family medicine who apply for and hold certificates Mission The mission of the ABFM is to improve the health of the public through: # Certification: The ABFM certifies family physicians who are highly skilled and effective at improving the health of their patients, their families, and their communities, and assists Diplomates in maintaining high professional standards through professional development and lifelong learning. # Training Standards: The ABFM sets standards for the training that prepares Family Medicine residents for board certification. # Research: The ABFM funds, conducts, and publishes research that is devoted to creating, evaluating, and maintaining cutting-edge certification methods, and to advancing the scientific basis of Family Medicine. # Leadership Development: The ABFM cultivates leaders in Family Medicine to expand the specialty‚Äôs contribution to the health of the public. # Collaboration: The ABFM collaborates with other specialty boards and organizations to promote better health care, drive better outcomes, and manage health care resources responsibly. Certification Candidates seeking certification or recertification must meet the eligibility criteria specified by the American Board of Family Medicine. Candidates must complete all requirements, culminating in the successful completion of the cognitive examination. Certification candidates must have satisfactorily completed three years of training in a Family Medicine residency program accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) subsequent to receipt of the M.D. or D.O. degree from an accredited institution. Additional policies apply to candidates who have completed their medical or residency training outside the United States. The American Board of Family Medicine requires periodic recertification to maintain Diplomate status. Family Medicine Certification (FMC) Family Medicine Certification (FMC) is the process that provides the American Board of Family Medicine (ABFM) with the means to continually assess Diplomates. The American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) determined that ABMS specialists within every discipline should be required to meet the highest standards of accountability. In response, the ABMS designed a process called Maintenance of Certification, and each specialty board within the ABMS has agreed to adhere to a set structure in developing their own individual programs. This structure consists of four components, each designed to assess important physician characteristics: Professionalism, Self-assessment and Lifelong Learning, Cognitive Expertise, and Performance Improvement. Although these elements are similar to and consistent with the ABFM's long-standing recertification program, Family Medicine Certification stresses the importance of ongoing participation in activities that evaluate each of these components between recertification examinations. Family Medicine Certification is a requirement that the ABFM believes encourages clinical excellence and benefits both physicians and their patients. Publications The Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine is the official publication of the board, succeeding The Journal of the American Board of Family Practice which was published 1988‚Äì2005. Reciprocity agreements The American Board of Family Medicine has reciprocity agreements with the College of Family Physicians of Canada, the Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners, and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. Diplomates of the ABFM may be eligible to seek certification by these colleges as well. Members in good standing of these colleges who meet all other requirements of the ABFM and reside in the United States may be eligible to take the Certification Examination. Eligibility to sit for the American Board of Family Medicine Certification Examination through reciprocity is available only to physicians who have satisfactorily completed formal Family Medicine or General Practitioner training accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting organization within Canada, Australia, or New Zealand.

Examination of the sections and iconography of Maya civilization roof-combs indicates that each icon had specific sacred meanings. Typically, the roof combs crowned the summit of pyramids and other structures; they consisted of two pierced framework walls which leaned on one another. This framework was covered by plaster decorated with artist depictions of gods or important rulers. History and significance The Mayans engineered some of the most important monuments in Mesoamerica. Their civilization experienced its ‚Äògolden age‚Äô between 500 and 900 AD. Recent deciphering of Maya hieroglyphs has brought new understanding to their architecture; these pictographic symbols tell historians about when specific structures were built and by whom. In Mayan religious architecture religious architecture there was an emphasis on height, which was often manifested by vertiginous staircases that reached toward the heavens and gods. Oftentimes pyramids were built over existing ones; this embraced ancestral authority while allowing for greater structural height(s). Monumental pyramids, platforms, temples, and sacrificial altars were used in daily religious rituals. The hierarchy of various Mayan cities was made evident by large palace compounds, and kings and rulers used ornate architecture to promote themselves and ensure their immortality. Roof combs provided variety to the limited iterations of Mayan architecture. Symbolically, it is said that a roof comb was the headdress of the building ‚Äì that of which resembles those worn by the kings and rulers. It was not enough to simply design, architects sought to embellish their work ‚Äì to pay tribute to the great gods and Mayan leaders their work was built for. The Mayan people lived and worked in a range of dwellings; many Mayan homes were clustered wood structures covered in thatch, while their rich counterparts enjoyed opulent palaces. Roof combs acted as ‚Äòcurb appeal‚Äô for the homes and buildings of the socially elite. Structural description As mentioned, the cultural importance regarding height was particularly significant when building monuments. Because of the limitations of corbel vaulting many Mayan structures were designed with only a few stories. Architects wrangled about the best ways to magnify their design to memorialize their culture. Almost always a roof comb would serve no structural function, and on these structures the combs acted as an ornate decorative facade. Architects used a lattice of stonework to create the combs, and this method proved to be strong and permanent. ‚ÄúRoof combs often were carved or painted with zoomorphic or anthropomorphic motifs as well as texts‚Äù.Cole, Emily. The Grammar of Architecture. New York: Metro Books, 2005. Print. The best examples of Mayan roof combs can be seen at the great temples of Tikal. These temples serve as funerary monuments for late rulers, and the combs are adorned with intricate and commemorative mosaic portraits.

The vehicle was originally shown as a concept car under the Kia Mesa name at the 2005 North American International Auto Show and went on sale in Korea as the Mohave prior to its release in the United States. In the US, the Borrego went on hiatus for the 2010 model year, with no word on its return or cancellation, after lower than expected sales in 2009. Kia, however, still continued selling the Borrego in Canada, meaning the Borrego was a Canada-only nameplate from 20102011. As of October 28, 2011, the model was discontinued with the Sorento as a successor, except the Middle East, China, Central Asia, Brazil, Chile and Russia. It was later dropped from the Chinese and Brazilian markets.|url=https://www.kia.com/my/util/kia-motors-global.html Technical details The Borrego utilized body-on-frame construction, with adjustable air-suspension, hill-descent control and a high- and low-range automatic transmission. The Borrego has three standard rows of seats in the US. The Borrego is fitted with either the 3.0 L VGT diesel V6 (in 2010), second- generation Lambda II 3.8 L V6 producing or the 4.6 L V8 Hyundai Tau engine.

Aston Martin, encouraged by the car's reception, began to offer alternative wheelbase lengths: 102 inches/2591 mm or 120 inches/3048 mm and a choice of open two-seater or four- seater bodywork. The cars were long, low and immediately recognisable by their unique radiator style and had great character making all the appropriate mechanical noises that characterised Aston Martin. Aston Martin made the cars exclusive; between 1932 and 1933, only 130 were produced. According to the standards of the early 1930s, Aston Le Mans were speedy cars ‚Äì compared to the pace of the MG and Singer- with a top speed in the region of 85 mph (137 km/h) and acceleration from 0‚Äì50 mph (0‚Äì80 km/h) in 16 seconds.

They have released more than 25 albums and singles. History The band rose to fame in 1994 in both the Netherlands and Belgium, with their cover of Gloria Gaynor's hit single, \\"I Will Survive\\"; and as of 2018 over 1.5 million copies of the single has been sold. It was reported that when Gloria Gaynor first heard a crowd sing this version of the cover of her song while performing at a company party in the Netherlands she was \\"not amused\\". In 1998, the single became a hit in Germany, and lead singer Judith Ansems was asked to promote the song there. That year it also reached number one in France, greatly because it became the anthem of the national football team and that year France went on to win the FIFA World Cup. Today, in popular French culture, it is still associated with the 1998 World Cup victory. The band landed a local recording contract with Polydor and alongside Ansems, former singers Jop Wijlacker and Robin Maas, the band was asked to record other covers, including \\"Country Roads\\" and \\"Que Sera Sera\\". These were issued in Germany under HHB International. Several of these singles were also released in the Netherlands. Their biggest hit in the United Kingdom was their cover of \\"Country Roads\\", released shortly before Christmas 2001. It peaked at No. 7 in the UK Singles Chart, and remained in the Top 10 for five weeks. It reached number 1 in the Scottish Singles Chart in December 2001 and again in January 2002. In 2002, the Hermes House Band joined forces with DJ √ñtzi to cover \\"Live Is Life\\", originally by Opus. This single reached No. 2 in the French chart, and No. 50 in the UK. In 2010, the former lead singer of the band, Jaap van Reesema, won the third series of the Dutch version of X Factor. In 2018, the band reached No.1 in France again with their version of \\"I Will Survive\\" after the French football team repeated their winning performance in the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

He played in Major League Baseball from 1907 to 1918 for the Philadelphia Phillies, Cincinnati Reds, Pittsburgh Pirates and Cleveland Indians. In 1907 he set one of the longest-lived records in major league history when he pitched 25 innings before giving up the first earned run of his career. Although others have pitched more consecutive innings without an earned run, until July 2008 no one had gone longer without prior major league experience. The record stood for 101 years before being broken by Oakland Athletics reliever Brad Ziegler, who extended the record to 39 innings. McQuillan's extraordinary success as a rookie was no fluke: he posted a 1.69 ERA in his first four seasons, comprising more than 800 innings pitched; during those years his Adjusted ERA+ (the ratio of the league's ERA, adjusted to the pitcher's ballpark, to that of the pitcher) was a staggering 164. In 1910, he would have led the majors with an Adjusted ERA+ of 195 had he pitched only an additional 1 innings to meet the minimum requirement of 154 innings pitched. McQuillan helped the Phillies win the 1915 National League Pennant. He is still the Philadelphia Phillies Career Leader in ERA (1.79), WHIP (1.02) and Hits Allowed/9IP (6.93). He currently ranks 23rd on the MLB Career ERA List (2.38), 37th on the WHIP List (1.131) and 86th on the Hits Allowed/9IP List (7.89). In 10 seasons he had an 85‚Äì89 Win‚ÄìLoss record, 273 Games (173 Started), 105 Complete Games, 17 Shutouts, 76 Games Finished, 14 Saves, 1,576 ‚Öì Innings Pitched, 1,382 Hits Allowed, 577 Runs Allowed, 417 Earned Runs Allowed, 23 Home Runs Allowed, 401 Walks Allowed, 590 Strikeouts, 30 Hit Batsmen, 16 Wild Pitches, 6,297 Batters Faced, a 2.38 ERA and 1.131 WHIP. McQuillan's major league career was cut short due to his chronic alcoholism and infection by syphilis. However, he continued to play and coach in the minor leagues and semi-pro ball. He died in Columbus, Ohio at the age of 54.

Initially part of the gothic rock and dark wave movement, the band had developed considerably by the time of the release of their debut album, incorporating metal elements and modern electronics, causing the band to be considered part of the gothic metal genre. Dreadful Shadows disbanded in 2000 to work on separate projects. History Formation In 1993, Sven Friedrich, Reiko Jeschke, Franc Hofer, Jens Riediger and Ron Thiele founded Dreadful Shadows in Berlin and recorded their first demo. In the same year, guitarist Reiko was replaced by Stefan Neubauer. The band made some appearances in Germany, England and Denmark. The second demo was published, and was discovered by label Sounds of Delight. In December the band began work on their first full-length album Estrangement, which appeared in April 1994. Dreadful Shadows commenced a European tour (touring with Love Like Blood, Nosferatu and The Eternal Afflict, among others), making a name for themselves in the Netherlands, England and Denmark. There followed in 1994 and 1995 some sampler contributions, further concerts and a festival (with Christian Death, Armageddon Dildos and The Eternal Afflict at the Zillo festival in December 1994) helping to increase Dreadful Shadows' popularity in Germany. In February 1995, the band went back into the studio to record the Homeless EP, which appeared in June 1995. The cover version of the New Order classic True Faith established itself in some clubs as dance hit. Subsequently, the band appeared with Cyan Kills E.Coli, at the Mise Noire festival in Madrid, along with bands Mephisto Walz and Girls Under Glass. 1995‚Äì2000 In December 1995 Dreadful Shadows separated from label Sounds of Delight. The band subsequently signed to Deathwish Office, the band-owned label of Love Like Blood. In March 1996, work began on the second LP Buried Again. During the process, the two guitarists Stefan Neubauer and Franc Hofer left Dreadful Shadows due to internal conflicts. Sven Friedrich and Tom Tony took over the guitar parts. In July 1996 Andr√© Feller left and a temporary guitarist in Sebastian Oliver Lange (In Extremo) was found. The latter was replaced on a long-term basis by Norman Selbig. The new line-up made an appearance at the Wave-Gotik-Treffen, followed by the album Buried Again and a tour of Germany and Europe (including an appearance at the Sacrosanct festival in London with bands such as Rosetta Stone and Vendemmian in August 1996). In 1997, Dreadful Shadows moved to the record company Oblivion, releasing the single Burning the Shrouds. Following a support tour with fellow Gothic metal band Paradise Lost, the band's third studio album, Beyond The Maze, was released in February 1998. The promo tour took the band to Beirut/Lebanon. The release of the Tanita Tikaram cover Twist in My Sobriety concluded a successful year. Their qualities as live band were proved in 1999 when the Dreadful Shadows embarked on an extensive European tour. In July 1999 the band recorded tracks for Gitane Demone's 'Stars of Trash' album at Thommy Hein Tonstudios in Berlin. Dreadful Shadows' last studio album, The Cycle, was released in September 1999. The band embarked on their final tour of Germany in the year 2000. Sven Friedrich and Norman Selbig formed Zeraphine shortly after the split. Andr√© and Ron formed 'Coma 51', whilst Jens formed his own label Andromeda Records and also the band 'Thanateros'. 2000‚Äì2007 (post‚Äìbreak up) During the years that followed, many of the Dreadful Shadows albums were remastered and re-released. First, in 2000 the double CD \\"Estrangement + Homeless\\" was released. It featured edited artwork and remixed sound. And later, in 2003, \\"Buried Again\\" was re-released with similar treatment and bonus tracks; such as cover versions of David Bowie and Marilyn Manson, and remixed versions of \\"Dusk\\" and \\"Paradize\\". Also, in 2001, \\"Beyond The Maze\\" and \\"The Cycle\\" were repackaged and sold as one double CD by the label Oblivion, but they were not remastered. 2007 Live Shows‚Äîsolo project In 2007, several concerts were planned with Dreadful Shadows performing together as a group. The band are keen to stress that this was not a reunion, as no new material was being performed or recorded. Fans could vote for the songs they wanted to hear on the band's website. In related news, Sven Friedrich, the singer of Zeraphine and the Dreadful Shadows, launched his solo project, Solar Fake.Solar Fake signs to Synthetic Symphony/SPV Solar Fake is an electro project and brings what Friedrich describes as \\"pulsating sequencers, driving beats and sometimes wild and aggressive vocals with intensive melodies and melancholic moments.\\" A debut album was planned for release in February 2008 via Synthetic Symphony/SPV.

Originally examining the lives of the wealthy Brooks and the poor Fosters, a series of recasts and departures in the early 1980s turned the focus of The Young and the Restless to the Abbotts and the Newmans, including the corporate rivalry between their two respective companies. However, one basic plot that has run throughout almost all of the program's history is the rivalry between Jill Foster Abbott and Katherine Chancellor, similar to the show's sister show, The Bold and the Beautiful, regarding Brooke Logan and Stephanie Forrester. The Brooks and the Fosters The Young and the Restless co-creator William J. Bell originally conceived the show to center around the class conflict between two core families: the wealthy Brooks and the poor Fosters. Newspaper publisher Stuart Brooks (played by Robert Colbert) and his socialite wife Jennifer (Dorothy Green) had four daughters: Leslie (Janice Lynde), a pianist; Lauralee \\"Lorie\\" (Jaime Lyn Bauer), an author; Christabel \\"Chris\\" (Trish Stewart), a journalist; and Peggy (Pamela Peters Solow), a college student. Meanwhile, Elizabeth \\"Liz\\" Foster (Julianna McCarthy) was a factory worker and single parent who, after being abandoned by her husband William \\"Bill\\" Sr. (Charles H. Gray), was struggling to make ends meet while trying to raise three children: William \\"Snapper\\" Jr. (played at first by William Grey Espy, then by David Hasselhoff), a medical student; Greg (James Houghton), a law student; and Jill (Brenda Dickson; later Bond Gideon, Deborah Adair, and currently Jess Walton), a beautician and aspiring model. In the show's first story there was a love triangle formed between Chris, Snapper, and waitress Sally McGuire (Lee Crawford). Chris and Snapper were a couple, but Chris wanted to not have sex until marriage. Snapper had a sexual relationship with Sally. Desperate to gain an upper hand, Sally threw away her birth control pills and got pregnant by Snapper. Not knowing that he was the father, Snapper proposed to Chris. When they found out he was the father of Sally's child, Chris suffered a miscarriage. Eventually, Sally moved out of town, and Chris and Snapper reconciled. Sisters, Leslie and Lorie fought over first Brad Eliot (Tom Hallick) and then in another love triangle with Lance Prentiss (John McCook). This love triangle stretched into four after Lance's sea captain brother Lucas (Tom Ligon) arrived in town. Although Lorie initially was little more than the bad girl who tormented pure sister Leslie, she became a lead in her own right as she battled her sister over custody of Leslie's son Brooks (Andre Gower), and then battled her psychotic mother-in-law Vanessa (K.T. Stevens) (who even killed herself just to frame Lorie for the crime). Other stories included Bill, dying of cancer, returning to town and remarrying Liz; Jennifer planning to divorce Stuart and marry her former lover and Liz Foster's brother Dr. Bruce Henderson (Paul Stevens), who was revealed to be Lorie's biological father; and Stuart and Liz marrying after Jennifer died of cancer. Jill vs. Kay One of the show's first longest running storylines was the rivalry between a young manicurist Jill Foster Abbott (Brenda Dickson, Jess Walton) and wealthy socialite, Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper). Cooper was introduced by Bell when the ratings were low; the storyline between Jill and Kay became popular, so Bell decided to exploit this popularity by crafting a storyline putting her against Jill. Jill went to work as Kay's manicurist and assistant to help her struggling family pay the bills. Kay was a boozy matron trapped in a loveless marriage to Phillip Chancellor II (John Considine later Donnelly Rhodes). Jill and Phillip fell in love, but in 1976, after he returned from obtaining a divorce in the Dominican Republic, Katherine picked him up at the airport, and in an attempt to kill both Phillip and herself, drove the car off a cliff. On his deathbed, Phillip married Jill and bequeathed her and their love child his fortune. At first, Kay offered Jill $1 million for the baby, but ended up getting a judge to declare that Jill and Phillip's marriage was illegal since Kay was drunk when signing her divorce papers. Since Jill nor her son had any rights to an inheritance, the baby was legally given the name \\"Phillip Foster\\" instead of \\"Phillip Chancellor III\\". As a result of the ruling, an embittered Jill became a vixen and the two ladies began an intense rivalry, blaming each other for the death of Phillip II. First, they fought over beautician Derek Thurston (Joe LaDue) in the late 1970s. In 1982, Jill married tycoon John Abbott (Jerry Douglas), but within a few years later, Kay seized the opportunity to break them up after obtaining photos of Jill's one-night-affair with John's son Jack (Terry Lester; currently Peter Bergman); John suffered a stroke after seeing those images and divorced Jill. The two ladies also fought for custody of Phillip Foster (Thom Bierdz) in the late 1980s, with Kay being awarded temporary custody without the right to adopt. Eventually, Kay arranged for his name to be legally changed to Phillip Chancellor III. In the 1990s, after Phillip III died from a car crash, and after Jill's second marriage to John ended, the two ladies went back to court when some of Phillip II's documents were found in the Chancellor mansion attic; the judge declared that Jill owned half of the Chancellor estate. Jill and Kay fought over this new arrangement as well as Jill's son Billy (David Tom/Ryan Brown/Scott Seymour/Billy Miller) dating Kay's granddaughter Mackenzie \\"Mac\\" Browning (Ashley Bashioum/Kelly Kruger/Rachel Kimsey/Clementine Ford). In 2003, the Jill-Kay rivalry changes forever. Liz Foster, afflicted with a near-terminal illness, informs Jill that she was adopted. After much investigation, it is revealed that Kay is Jill's biological mother. Learning the truth on their wedding night, Billy and Mackenzie have their marriage annulled (since they are biological first cousins). Since then, Kay and Jill have made peace and formed a genuine (though sometimes contentious) mother-daughter bond. Their relationship even managed to survive and grow stronger even after the 2007 revelation that Jill's son with Phillip II was switched at birth by Kay. A series of DNA tests revealed that new Genoa City resident Ethan \\"Cane\\" Ashby (Daniel Goddard) was Jill's son and the mild mannered Aussie helped Jill and Kay come to grips with their feud and the events of the baby switch. Family and friends grew concerned when Katherine began suffering from \\"senior moment\\" and, later in 2008, they began to suspect she was drinking again. In fact, it was Marge Cotrooke (Kay's doppelganger) who was drinking and Katherine's cagey behavior was due in part to protecting Marge's secret while supporting her recovery. Everyone believed Kay died in a serious car accident but Marge was actually killed. Jill was devastated by the loss of her mother, admitting openly that she loved her former rival. The real Kay lost her memory, assumed Marge's life as a waitress and was later kidnapped until she was rescued and reunited with her family. Jill remained suspect of Katherine, even after she returned, thinking that it was really Marge trying to con the family. DNA results proved that the woman claiming to be Katherine was not related to Jill, starting a series of events that dramatically reshaped the Chancellor family. In 2009, the true paternity came to light that Jill was, in fact, not Kay's biological daughter. This reignited the feud and helped Billy and Mac rekindle their love for each other. Kay's senior moments were revealed to be caused by lime disease which also caused her to imagine the whole baby switch. The true Phillip Chancellor III returned, revealing that he sent Cane to Genoa City to heal Jill and Kay's pain. Phillip III revealed that he faked his death to hide the fact that he was gay, a plot that did not make sense, and that was very negatively received by long-term fans. Phillip stayed in Genoa City very briefly, to try and rebuild his relationship with his son (Chance), Nina and mother, and then was immediately written out of the series. Later, Jill helped Katherine track down her real long-lost child. Mogul Tucker McCall was revealed to be Katherine's biological son even though Kay thought she had given birth to a daughter. Tucker had hatched a plan to take over Chancellor Industries while Katherine and Jill were preoccupied with their search for Katherine's daughter. As a result, Katherine lost her company and partially blamed this on Jill who was sleeping with Tucker. Tucker and Katherine have since started to develop a relationship while Jill and Katherine remain at odds. The Abbotts,The Newmans,and The Williams By the early 1980s, most members of the Brooks and Foster families had been recast, and when The Young and the Restless expanded to an hour in 1980, many lead actors said they could not sustain themselves on an hour show and quit. Show creator William J. Bell told himself he would wait for one more major departure before making big changes. When Jaime Lyn Bauer, who played Lorie, quit in 1982 due to exhaustion, Bell took the opportunity to write out all of the Brooks and Fosters, save Jill. Gradually, the focus shifted from the Brooks and Foster families to the Williams, Abbott, and Newman families. The Williams family was introduced in 1978. Police Detective Carl Williams (Brett Hadley) and his wife Mary (Carolyn Conwell) had their hands full with their promiscuous teenage son Paul (Doug Davidson). Paul had a fling with Nikki Reed (Melody Thomas Scott) and gave her a sexually transmitted disease. He then went on to romance prostitute Cindy Lake, as well as April Stevens (Cynthia Eilbacher), who mothered his daughter, Heather, before marrying Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman) and opening a private investigations agency with Andy Richards (Steven Ford). Paul's older brother Steven (David Winn) was a reporter who dated Peggy Brooks and eventually moved to Washington D.C. Meanwhile, Carl and Mary's daughter Patty (Lilibet Stern/Andrea Evans) married Jack, but due to his frequent infidelities, she eventually lost control and shot Jack in the back three times. After being cleared of any charges, Patty divorced Jack and left town to join her brother Steven in Washington. The Williams' oldest son Todd was an unseen character who served as a priest (he eventually made an on- screen appearance in 2004 with Corbin Bernsen playing the role in a cameo appearance). By the late 1980s, most members of the Williams family were phased out, but the Abbott and the Newman families remained. The Young and the Restless is one of the few shows in the history of daytime to eliminate their original core families and benefit from the result. Eric Braeden joined the cast in 1980 as sinister tycoon Victor Newman, in what was originally a short- term role but soon became a permanent fixture. Victor was so menacing to his wife Julia (Meg Bennett) that he locked her boyfriend Michael Scott (Nicholas Benedict) in a bomb shelter constructed in the basement and forced him to watch Victor and Julia's bedroom via closed-circuit camera. Bell saw something in Braeden's performance and since the show had few strong male characters, elevated him to star status. Soon after, Victor went to a strip club and met Nikki, who at the time was working as a stripper. She married Victor in a lavish 1984 wedding and their love-hate relationship has gone through the birth of two children, Victoria (Heather Tom/Sarah Aldrich/Amelia Heinle) and Nicholas (Joshua Morrow), as well as many divorces, affairs, and remarriages since then. Bell also expanded the role of the Abbott family. In addition to John and his son Jack, daughters Ashley (Eileen Davidson) and Traci (Beth Maitland) were introduced. Stories were phased in regarding the corporate rivalry between the Abbott's Jabot Cosmetics and the Newman's Newman Enterprises. The personal lives of both the Abbotts and the Newmans also became a major focus. A four-way quadrangle became a major storyline in the 1980s-90s with Victor marrying Ashley and Jack marrying Nikki. Meanwhile, the insecure Traci became involved in a love triangle with her rival Lauren and rock star Danny Romalotti (Michael Damian), before marrying gardener-turned- business executive Brad Carlton (Don Diamont). The Abbott and Newman family rivalry is further put the test in 2010 after Billy Abbott and Victoria Newman marry. Lauralee Bell A relatively controversial fixture on the show for several decades was Bell's daughter, Lauralee. Lauralee debuted in 1983 in a bit part as Christine \\"Cricket\\" Blair. As Lauralee grew up, her character became more and more prominent, to the point where in 1988 storylines had four different men in love with her. Longtime fan favorite Terry Lester, who played Jack Abbott, left the show in 1989 and blamed her partly, claiming that the excessive airtime given to Cricket drowned out the other performers. Chris originally became the love interest of the character of Danny Romalotti and was involved in a love Quadrangle between him, Phillip Chancellor III and Nina Webster throughout most of 1987 and the first half of 1988. Chris, who was saving herself for marriage, then had an unconsummated romance with Scott Grainger (which ended abruptly when he was revealed to be her half-brother) and was later a victim of a \\"date-rape\\" where Derek raped Christine. Then it seemed as if Chase and Chris would become romantically involved and during the time Cricket was healing from being date-raped, but the story never came to fruition, even though Cricket's mother gave her blessing for the two (Cricket and Chase) of them to marry if that's what the future held for them before she died of AIDS. Christine would later marry Danny and then Paul before becoming an attorney and asking people to refer to her as \\"Chris\\". However, she remained a somewhat saccharine central heroine. At one point in 1996, the show hinted at a romance between Christine and the much older Victor Newman, but negative viewer reaction killed the story. Later, Christine began to work with Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc) who had stalked her years earlier. After a brief engagement to Michael, Christine and Paul reunited but eventually split for good. By 2004 or so, Lauralee Bell's marriage and children, as well as a successful clothing store, diminished her on-screen airtime and paved the way for other characters. In early 2005 she announced her move from contract to recurring status. In May 2007, it was announced that Bell would reprise her character on The Young and the Restlesss sister soap, The Bold and the Beautiful. The Barbers and the Winters The Young and the Restless is also one of the few soaps to have successfully integrated a number of African American actors into its cast. In the mid-1980s The Young and the Restless created a storyline which revolved around Tyrone Jackson (Phil Morris), a young black man, being made up in whiteface to bring down a mafia kingpin, but most of the characters were written out within a few years. In 1989, the program Generations earned critical acclaim for casting an entire African American family from the show's inception. Established hits like The Young and the Restless were criticized as the show had a low number of minorities. As a response, Tonya Lee Williams and Victoria Rowell joined The Young and the Restless in the early 1990s as the Barber sisters, Olivia and Drucilla, nieces of the Abbott's maid Mamie Johnson (Veronica Redd). They proved to be very successful and they interacted fairly well with the established characters. Nathan Hastings (Nathan Purdee/Randy Brooks/Adam Lazarre-White), the only other remaining black character on the show before 1990, was married off to Olivia, before dying in a hit and run car accident in 1996. Two more black characters, Neil Winters, played by former Generations alum Kristoff St. John and his brother Malcolm played by Shemar Moore, would be introduced in 1991 and 1994 respectively. However, the core black characters largely interacted with themselves only; they would most often act as bit parts in scenes with the other characters. In the case of the Winters brothers, and the Barber sisters, they were shown to usually just swap each other's partners when a \\"shake-up\\" was needed in the romantic scheme of the story. This led to a seemingly never-ending love quadrangle between the four characters. Later actions have proven that this choice was due to the supposition that it was ostensibly \\"too controversial\\" to have an interracial pairing. Indeed, a pairing in the late 1990s between Neil Winters and Victoria Newman was axed by CBS executives, who were rumored to have received many angry phone calls and letters by viewers in the South. In 2004, a love affair between Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford) and chemist Damon Porter (Keith Hamilton Cobb) was prominently featured, despite concerns that the interracial pairing would be scrapped just like the one that was written before. While the romance between Phyllis and Damon did eventually come to an end, the writers followed up by having Phyllis' son Daniel (Michael Graziadei) become involved with Drucilla and Malcolm's daughter Lily (Christel Khalil). Daniel and Lily married in 2006. Lily and Daniel's marriage was short-lived. After they divorced, Lily moved on with Cane (the man pretending to be Jill's son). Lily and Cane tried to have a family but complications, including a suffering through an ectopic pregnancy and thinking that Cane had fathered a child with another woman, Chloe. Despite these events, the two married in 2009. Lily was diagnosed with cancer. She and Cane asked Mackenzie to act as a surrogate to help them start a family despite Lily's medical condition. Other minority characters From 1999 to 2004, David Lago played Raul Guittierez, a member of a Cuban family who became part of a circle of friends that included Billy, Mackenzie, J.T. Hellstrom (Thad Luckinbill), Rianna Miner (Rianna Loving/Alexis Thorpe), and Brittany Hodges (Vanessa Lee Evigan/Lauren Woodland). Raul's brother Diego (Diego Serrano/Greg Vaughan) arrived in town in 2001 after running away from the family several years prior. After helping his younger brother during a difficult time, Diego had flings with Nicholas' wife Sharon (Sharon Case) and Victoria. The show has been less successful with incorporating Asian American characters. In 1994, the Vietnamese Volien family was introduced to the show, consisting of Luan (Elizabeth Sung) and her two children, Keemo (Philip Moon) and Mai (Marianne Rees). Jack Abbott had fought in Vietnam, and had gotten a woman named Luan pregnant without knowing, before returning to the U.S.A.. By coincidence, twenty plus years later, Luan end ups working at a Vietnamese restaurant that just happens to be in Genoa City, Wisconsin. Despite Jack Abbot being a very prominent businessman from one of Genoa City's most well- known families, and being in the newspaper constantly for his company and social life, Luan surprisingly does not know Jack is in Genoa City. The character is shown with white hair, appearing to be around 60 years old, however, when Jack and Luan finally reconnect, Luan now has black hair and appears to be around 45. Luan quickly marries Jack Abbott (who tells him he is the father of her son Keemo), even though they barely know each other, and then she is suddenly and mysterious un-disclosed disease, and her two children were written out soon afterward in 1996. Keemo is never heard from again, and Jack Abbot never mentions Keemo as his son. Eric Steinberg played Hong Kong business executive Ji Min Kim with business ties to Jack and as a love interest for Jill. The character was killed off in a contrived murder-mystery plot in 2007. Recasting While heavy recasting is considered to have doomed some series such as Ryan's Hope and Love Is a Many Splendored Thing, The Young and the Restless has been successful at replacing some of its lead characters with other actors. Most often, major characters are played by the same actor for decades; if they left the show, the characters left with them. But in the case of The Young and the Restless, their replacements were often popular and remade the character in their own image. When William Grey Espy left the show in 1975, the role of Snapper Foster was given to then-unknown actor David Hasselhoff. Peter Bergman has won three Emmy Awards after replacing Lester as Jack Abbott. And Jess Walton, who took over the role of Jill Foster Abbott after original cast member Brenda Dickson was fired in 1987 after a fallout with producers, has earned two Emmys. In 2004, Joan Van Ark joined the cast as Gloria Fisher, Michael Baldwin's mother, remaining until early 2005. She was replaced by Judith Chapman. The role of Lily Winters was first made popular by actress Christel Khalil. The Young and the Restless recast Lily with Davetta Sherwood in 2005 but the role was eventually given back to Khalil in 2006. The 2005 the role of Mackenzie Browning was recast from Ashley Bashioum to Rachel Kimsey. Kimsey was released from her contract in May 2006 and the character returned in 2009 played by Clementine Ford. The recasting of Mac took place shortly after the character of Billy Abbott returned, played by Billy Miller. There have been many recasts of the role of Billy Abbott, Phyllis Newman, and Victoria Newman. The role of Colleen Carlton, Brad and Traci's daughter, who had been played by Lyndsy Fonseca for several years was recast in January 2006 with Adrianne Leon. Leon was let go in June 2007 and replaced with former Home and Away actress Tammin Sursok, who left in October 2009 after her character died. In late 2006, The Young and the Restless recast the role of popular daytime villainess, Sheila Carter. Originally played by Kimberlin Brown on both The Young and the Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful, the character was later handed over to Michelle Stafford, who also plays Phyllis. Although this recast was mainly storyline-directed, since Sheila had plastic surgery to look like Phyllis, fans of Sheila have expressed mixed opinions regarding Brown's absence in the role.New Soaps Q&A;: Michelle Stafford (Phyllis/Sheila, Y&R;) - Soaps News TVGuide.com Social issues Unlike other soaps in the 1980s or 1990s, The Young and the Restless avoided preachy social issues. When they did touch on such issues as abortion or the homeless crisis or AIDS, it was only as a plot device with a few facts and statistics thrown in for effect. For example, when Ashley aborted Victor's child in the 1980s, any viewers or scholars who may have looked for a serious story on the pros and cons of abortion would have been disappointed. Ashley only aborted her baby because Victor's wife Nikki was then presumed to be terminally ill, and Ashley did not want to cause her pain. After learning of her abortion, Victor ripped her to shreds, causing a devastated Ashley to lose her mind and wind up in an insane asylum. One social issue which was too hot for The Young and the Restless audience of the mid-'70s was homosexuality. In the mid-1970s, Kay befriended an overweight, unhappy housewife named Joann Curtis. Kay moved Joann into her home and helped her get a better self-image. Soon, Kay's son Brock wondered about all the time the ladies were spending together, as Kay planned a special vacation to Hawaii for herself and Joann. The ratings dropped and outraged fan letters poured in. Bell quickly dropped the relationship, wrote out Joann, and the show stabilized. Glow by Jabot The year 2000 brought forth a new teen scene on The Young and the Restless, including Jill Abbott's now teenage son Billy Abbott, his rich girlfriend Brittany Hodges, his friend Raul Guittierez, Raul's girlfriend Rianna Miner, and the \\"plain Jane\\" oddball Mackenzie Browning. Mac, who was later revealed to be Katherine Chancellor's granddaughter by her son. Mackenzie blossomed from quiet girl into the Prom Queen and, on prom night, shared a kiss with the Prom King, Billy. That summer, as Mac and Billy's relationship grew, the whole group moved into the Glow by Jabot house along with JT, who began dating Brittany. In 2004, Billy and Mac were married but were interrupted on their wedding night by Jill, who revealed that they were first cousins. The marriage was annulled and they each left town. Damaged by their relationship, Billy and Mac returned to Genoa City separately on different occasions. Mac returned and began dating JT; she miscarried his baby and left to work with refugees in Darfur. Billy returned with a gambling problem and left again to work for Jabot in New York and Hong Kong. Brittany Hodges and J.T. broke up after he cheated on her with Brittany's mother. She started dating Raul and, after they were robbed, wound up working for mobster Bobby Marsino at his strip club. She and Raul broke up once he found out about her new job; later Brittany was electrocuted on stage during a performance. Everyone suspected that Kevin Fisher was behind the incident but it was eventually revealed to be part of Bobby's the mob dealings. This made Raul realize that he really loved Brittany, however it was too late. She lived through the ordeal, but soon came to realize that she loved Bobby Marsino. Despite Raul's attempts to get her back, a fully recovered Brittany fell in love with Bobby. The two married and Brittany had a baby girl and left town to be with Bobby who was hiding in witness protection. Raul left town and Bobby was later killed. Kevin Fisher and the Baldwin Family Drucilla returned in 2002 with her daughter, Lily Winters. Neil recovered from his dependency on alcohol thanks to Lily and Dru at the same time Lily began an online \\"relationship\\" with a guy who claimed to be a 17-year-old. Lily met the man from the internet, Kevin Fisher, at his apartment. The two had sex and Lily got Chlamydia. Lily's best friend Colleen Carlton tried to convince Lily to stay away from Kevin but Lily was in love. Kevin's dark side emerged, however, when he grew tired of Colleen's treatment of him. Kevin locked Colleen in the refrigerator and set the building on fire. J.T. rescued Colleen and Lily broke it off with Kevin. The depth of Kevin's darkness was explored after it was revealed he was Michael Baldwin's younger half-brother. Kevin had been abused as a child by his father and locked in closets. He felt that Michael abandoned him and even confronted Michael with a gun. Michael was able to reach out to his misguided brother and heal their relationship. Their mother, trashy Gloria Fisher, moved to Genoa City after Kevin's breakdown. Gloria felt remorse and guilt over letting Kevin's evil father, Tom Fisher, abuse her son. Gloria was a gold digger but soon fell for John Abbott. She lied to John about her family, even going so far as to hire actors to play her sons. Eventually Michael and Kevin were revealed to be her sons and John was furious, especially after what Kevin had done to John's granddaughter Colleen. He forgave Gloria and they married, despite strong warnings from his children Jack and Ashley. Ashley and Gloria sparked up a horrid rivalry with each other. In a misguided attempt to discredit Ashley, Gloria poisoned a sample of a Jabot face cream. The plan backfired when a customer, Emma Gibson, died. The resulting scandal nearly took down Jabot and the entire Abbott family. Gloria kept her role in this a secret despite a judicial order that no Abbott be allowed to run Jabot again. Shortly afterwards, \\"Terrible Tom\\" Fisher came to Genoa City looking for Gloria's new money. Tom's return forced Kevin to confront his demons. Gloria tried to keep Tom at bay but he teamed up with psychopath Sheila Carter, whom he had no idea of how \\"bad\\" she was, to bring down Lauren Fenmore. They kidnapped Lauren but Tom ran away when Sheila went through with her plot to blow up Lauren on the yacht. Michael watched the yacht explode and believed his fianc√© was dead. However, Lauren showed up at the chapel the night before their wedding. Tom's role in this plot was revealed and he was eventually found dead. Although there was no shortage of suspect (or motives), John Abbott was revealed to be the killer and was sent to prison. Ashley and Jack blamed Gloria for all that had happened to their family, including John's arrest. They refused to listen to John when he insisted that he loved Gloria and that his wishes that she be taken care of be honored. John died in prison, but not before Jack was able to convince an ailing John to re-write his will. When a new will surfaced, Gloria was kicked out of the Abbott Mansion. She moved in with Michael and Lauren, who had just given birth to their son Fenmore. Kevin, meanwhile, sought redemption and eventually gained forgiveness from Lily and Colleen. Victor's downfall Victor found himself at odds with his children - Nicholas and Victoria - as well as Nikki and his longtime rival Jack over his unethical business dealings in his life. Victor went to war against Jabot Cosmetics and nearly put Jabot out of business. Nick discovered Victor's corrupt methods and turned Victor over to federal authorities. Victor was nearly sentenced to prison but was given community service and fined twenty million dollars (which was awarded to Jabot). Victoria was disgusted with Victor's action and left for Italy while Nick's relationship with his father remained severely strained. Victor's downfall forced him to explore some of his inner demons, including coming face-to-face with his now elderly father, played by veteran character actor George Kennedy. Nick accompanied Victor on his trip to visit his father, essentially restarting their fragile relationship. With the help of Nikki, Victor managed to regain his children's trust and made them co-CEOs of Newman. Victor then joined forces with Nikki and Phyllis to form NVP. His involvement with the upstart company was short-lived, however. Victor was diagnosed with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, a condition of which Jack took advantage. Victor returned from a spiritual journey he suffered more seizures. He was eventually cured but was touched by how supportive Jack had been during the ordeal. Victor quickly learned of Jack's deception but continued to go along with it, making Jack think that the two rivals had actually grown close and were friends. Victor found out that Jack had secretly obtained control of Jabot, against judicial orders, and set an elaborate plot in motion to bring Jack down - after Victor financed Jack's botched run for State Senate. Later, two new important figures would enter Victor's life. Victoria's close friend Sabrina came to Genoa City and began a relationship with Victor. Also, Victor brought his son, Victor Jr., to Genoa City after the young man's mother died. Victor Jr. preferred to be called Adam and took a strong dislike to his siblings Nick and Victoria, who he thought were over privileged country-club snobs. Despite his inexperience, Victor was impressed by Adam's educational background and work ethic and brought him into the Newman Enterprises Senior Management team. Victoria and Nick repeatedly disagreed with Adam's ideas, creating a lot of tension. Victor was happy with Sabrina but, in a series of horrific events, she was taken from him in a brutal car accident with Nikki's lover, David Chow. Tortured by the death of his lover and their unborn child, Victor fled to Mexico in search of the mobster responsible for the car accident. Adam used Victor's absence to his advantage and ousted Nick and Victoria from Newman Enterprises, appointing himself CEO while the rest of Victor's family searched for their missing father. Victor returned to Genoa City thanks to Nikki's help, even though he blamed her for Sabrina's death. Victor was severely upset with Adam's behavior and blackballed him from Newman Enterprises and all other corporations. Adam was angry and teamed up with Jack to frame Victor for murder. The plan nearly worked, forcing Victor to flee into exile where he was later rescued by Ashley Abbott. Adam was the only one punished for involvement in the crime and sent to prison, where his eyesight began to vanish. 1994 O.J. Simpson trial impact on ratings Along with every other daytime soap, The Young and the Restless has suffered audience erosion, with very noticeable losses during the O.J. Simpson trial. For many months, The Young and the Restless was not shown at its regularly scheduled time during the televised Simpson trial. A trailer sometimes ran at the bottom of the TV screen informing viewers to use their VCRs to tape Y&R; at random hours like 2:27 a.m., 4:26 a.m. There was not a set re-broadcast time after midnight, and this was years before the internet was in homes, which would have allowed viewers to watch online as you can in 2014. Many long-time viewers simply gave up trying to figure out when to set their VCRs, and gave up permanently on the show. Y&R; permanently lost millions of viewers as a result. Every year after the Simpson trial, Y&R; has mostly lost viewers. In the 2000s they took some power away from longtime producer Edward J. Scott and head writer Kay Alden, and started to instead rely on head writer John F. Smith and later (in 2006) head writer/executive producer Lynn Marie Latham. Malcolm Winters controversy Another highly publicized move was the 2004 rehiring of Shemar Moore to reprise his role as Malcolm for a limited run. Moore was extremely popular with all viewers, particularly African-American viewers, and the show lost a healthy chunk of that demographic upon his 2002 departure. Although fans were happy to see him return, Malcolm's new storyline, exposed him as having sex with his brother's wife while under the influence of prescription drugs. Viewers learned that Malcolm, not his brother Neil, was the biological father of Lily. Viewers were outraged by this, commenting that Malcolm basically raped Dru as she was barely cognizant due to medicine. Malcolm returned again in the Fall of 2014, for only two days, trying to help his now blind brother Neil. He returned again in 2019 after receiving news of Neil's death. Cassie/Mariah In another high-profile storyline, Nicholas and Sharon's teenage daughter Cassie was killed off. In spite of rave reviews from the soap press, the ratings remained consistent. In August 2006, the show killed off patriarch John Abbott. These episodes nudged The Young and the Restless to some of its highest ratings (6.4 million viewers in August 2006) in some time. In 2014, it was revealed that Cassie actually had an identical twin sister named Mariah (played by the same actress as Cassie), who was raised by an unloving woman. It was revealed in the Fall of 2014, that Sharon gave birth to twins, and did not realize it, as both babies were immediately taken away and adopted to two different mothers. The writers also created a number of retcon storylines during the 2000s. In 2003, it was revealed that Jill was adopted, and Kay was actually her birth mother; Billy and Mac were told about this moments before they consummated their relationship. In 2004, Jill's birth father Arthur Hendricks (David Hedison) briefly visited, and mother and daughter fought over him while Kay again battled her drinking problem. Then it was revealed that Arthur was not Jill's father, but Lauren Fenmore's father was actually Jill's biological dad, making Jill and Lauren half-sisters. Brad Carlton/Nazi plot Another controversial storyline involving Brad Carlton was his largely unexplained alter ego named George Kaplan in 2006. Fans had a very negative reaction to the introduction of a plot surrounding Nazis and artwork involving Brad's mother during WWII. Brad's mother supposedly was in her early 20s during World War II, which would make Brad's mother in her mid to late 80s in 2006. However, the actress who played Brad's mother appeared to be around 60, far too young for this role. Fans complained that the Nazi artwork plot made no sense at all, along with Brad's age and the age his mother was supposed to be. The plot was completely dropped without mention, Brad then had an affair with Sharon Newman, and then was killed off trying to save Sharon's son Noah when he fell through ice on a frozen lake. The actor Don Diamont then transferred to Y&R;'s \\"sister show\\" The Bold and the Beautiful as a new character named Bill. Out of the Ashes promotional poster In 2007, the show began to reintroduce infamous story plots to draw back some devoted fans. The infamous Jack vs. Victor war began to surface again in November 2006, with Jack secretly manipulating Victor's new company, NVP Retreats (Nikki, Victor, Phyllis), and Victor wanting revenge. Also, with the death of John, the basic \\"estate inheritance\\" storyline, made famous with many characters including Kay and Jill, played out between the Abbott children and Gloria, who was John's wife before he died. Years 2006 and 2007 also saw two murder-mystery plots, as Carmen Mesta (Marisa Ramirez) and Ji Min Kim (Eric Steinberg) were killed off. Out of the Ashes One highly publicised story was the culmination of a months-long storyline involving the construction of a casino and resort at the fictional city of Clear Springs; this story ended in the so-called \\"Clear Springs Explosion.\\" This event was marketed as The Young and the Restless: Out of the Ashes, which aired from October 19 to October 26, 2007, in which a building collapsed due to the aforementioned explosion and many central characters were injured somehow. The Out of the Ashes storyline is notable for being the first time The Young and the Restless has used a special title sequence for a particular storyline. However, the extra budget dollars expended on Out of the Ashes - approximately US$2,000,000 - produced little or no bump upward in the ratings. Victims trapped inside the rubble were: Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), Sharon Abbott (Sharon Case), Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow), a pregnant Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle), Adrian Korbel (Eyal Podell), Noah Newman (Hunter Allan), Amber Moore (Adrienne Frantz), Paul Williams (Doug Davidson), Lauren Fenmore Baldwin (Tracey E. Bregman), Detective Maggie Sullivan (Tammy Lauren), Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper), Cane Ashby (Daniel Goddard) and J.T. Hellstrom (Thad Luckinbill).

It was erected as the Apostolic Vicariate of Japan on May 1, 1846, by Pope Gregory XVI, and its name was later changed by Pope Pius IX to the Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Japan on May 22, 1876. It was elevated to the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Tokyo by Pope Leo XIII on June 15, 1891, with the suffragan sees of Niigata, Saitama, Sapporo, Sendai, and Yokohama. Tarcisio Isao Kikuchi, S.V.D., previously serving as Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Niigata, was appointed Archbishop of the Tokyo Archdiocese on October 25, 2017. History The Evangelization of Japan starts in 1549 with the arrival of Saint Francis Xavier and goes on until 1587 when Toyotomi Hideyoshi issued the edict forbidding Christianity and ordering all missionaries to leave Japan. In the following years of persecution, also in Edo (now Tokyo), there were cases of martyrdom in 1612 and 1623. After the ‚Äúseclusion period‚Äù, the first missionaries of the Paris Mission Society arrived in Japan in 1858 and were stationed in the three ports of Nagasaki, Yokohama and Hakodate. On 1 May 1846, Vicariate Apostolic of Japan was erected. On 22 May 1876, the vicariate apostolic was divided in two: the Apostolic Vicariate of Southern Japan with its center in Nagasaki and Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Japan with its center in Tokyo. Pierre Marie Osouf was the first Ordinary (Catholic Church) of the Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Japan. On April 17, 1891. the Vicariate Apostolic of Northern Japan was divided into the Archdiocese of Tokyo and the Diocese of Hakodate. Pierre Marie Osouf became the first Archbishop of Tokyo. On August 13, 1912, the Archdiocese of Tokyo ceded the prefectures of Toyama, Fukui and Ishikawa to the newly established Prefecture Apostolic of Niigata, and on February 18, 1922, the prefectures of Aichi and Gifu were ceded to the newly established Prefecture Apostolic of Nagoya. In November 1937, Tokyo was entrusted to the Japanese clergy and confined to Tokyo-to and the Chiba Prefecture. The remaining territory was detached to form the Diocese of Yokohama. The first Archbishop selected from among the Japanese clergy was Archbishop Peter Tatsu Doi. List of ordinaries *Th√©odore-Augustin Forcade, MEP (1846 - 1852) *C.

The present Chungnyeolsa was first built in 1605 (the 38th year of the reign under King Seonjo) as Songgongsa, within the South Gate of Dongnae eupseong by Yun Hwon, the Deputy Delegate of Dongnae, enshrining Song Sang-hyeon and performing annual rite to the spirit. Then, in 1624 (the 2nd year of the reign under King Injo), with the suggestion of Lee Min-goo, the name of the temple was changed to Chungnyeolsa, also enshrining the spirit of Jeong Bal, a patriot who died a heroic death at Busanjin Fortress. Then, in 1625 (the 3rd year of the reign under King Injo), Chungnyeolsa was moved to the current location, and named Allak Seowon with the construction of an auditorium and Dongseojae, in order to pass the loyalty and the academic conducts of the ancestors, serving both the functions of a temple house and a library. In 1709 (the 35th year of the reign under King Sukjong), a separate building was built at the original location of Songgongsa, in memory of Jo Yeong-gyu (the Country Governor of Yangsan-gun), No Gae-bang (the Dongnae Kyosoo), Mun Deok-gyeom (a Confucian scholar), Yang Jo-han, Song Bong-su (the Bijang), Kim Hui-soo (the Military Commander), Sin Yeo-ro (a steward), Song Baek (the Hyangni) and Kim Sang (a common man), etc., all of whom dies bravely with Song Sang-hyeon and Jeong Bal. In 1736 (the 12th year of the reign under King Yeongjo), the ones enshrined at the separate buildings were all enshrined together at Chungnyeolsa, and in 1772 (the 48th year of the reign under King Yeongjo), Yun Heung-sin, the Dadaecheomsa, was also enshrined here, while a sanctuary was built outside the East Gate of Chungnyeolsa, in memory of Geumseom and Aehyang, each of whom died after Song Sang-hyeon and Jeong Bal. Chungnyeolsa went through more remodeling and restoration thereafter, and is currently composed of 16 buildings including the main hall in a total area of 93,448„é°.

History Rail line ran along the split west of Eureka; 1942 The timber came from the mountains east of Trinidad Prior to private settlement of the area, the north spit at the entrance to Humboldt Bay was used by a series of Federal government projects including the 1851 to 1892 Humboldt Harbor Light, in 1862, a prisoner of war camp for Native Americans captured in the Bald Hills War, the Humboldt Bay Life-Saving Station in 1878, and the stonemason finishing yard and trans- shipment point for foundation stones for the St. George Reef Light from 1883 to 1891 at Paysonville. The nongovernmental settlement was known as Brownsville, after James Henry Brown a dairy farmer who settled his ranch on the present site of Samoa in 1865. James Brown was the first permanent white settler on the north peninsula of Humboldt Bay. He was born in Quincy, Illinois, in 1830 and came to Humboldt county in 1853, until a group of Eureka businessmen formed the Samoa Land and Improvement Company in 1889.Carranco 1982 p.157 Vance Lumber Company purchased the Humboldt Bay frontage from Samoa Land and Improvement Company for construction of a large sawmill in 1892.Carranco 1982 p.145 Eureka and Klamath River Railroad was chartered in 1893 to connect the Samoa sawmill and associated worker housing facilities to the city of Arcata and timberlands near the Mad River.Carranco 1982 p.117 The Samoa sawmill was the largest in Humboldt County when purchased by Andrew B. Hammond in 1900.Carranco 1982 p.99 The Samoa post office opened in 1894. A sash and door factory was added to the mill complex by 1909, and the company was reorganized as the Hammond Lumber Company in 1912.Carranco 1982 p.159 Hammond Lumber Company built an emergency shipyard during World War I, and seven wooden steam-ships were built at Samoa between 1917 and 1919.Carranco 1982 p.100 The 1921-22 Belcher Atlas of Humboldt County breaks down private and commercial land ownership throughout the county, showing that by 1922, the region of Samoa was parceled into an extractive resource industry. The largest tracts of land belonged to Hammond Lumber Company, while other enterprises included the Little River Redwood Company, the San Francisco Land Company, Big Lagoon Lumber Company, and Dolbeer & Carson Lumber Company, the latter owning the northerly marsh inlets stretching between the modern-day Arcata Bottoms and Mad River. Hammond Lumber Company railroads brought logs and lumber to Samoa from Little River and Big Lagoon until the railway trestles were destroyed by wildfire in 1945. 1947 aerial photo of Hammond Lumber Company in Samoa Georgia-Pacific Corporation purchased the Samoa sawmill complex in 1956 and began operation of a plywood mill in 1958.Carranco 1982 pp.163-164 A modern sawmill replaced the original sawmill facilities in 1964.Carranco 1982 p.164 A pulp mill began operation in 1965.Carranco 1982 p.101 Some of the older worker housing was razed during construction of modern mill facilities, but the Samoa Cookhouse was preserved. The Samoa mill complex was transferred to Louisiana-Pacific Corporation during a Federal Trade Commission action initiated in 1972Carranco 1982 p.166 The last old-growth timber was milled in 1980, and the area was set for sale in 2001. Samoa Peninsula The coastal bar separating Humboldt Bay from the Pacific Ocean has been breached by a dredged channel to allow commercial shipping to enter the bay. The tips of the north and south jetties have unusual concrete breakers known as dolos, which resemble toy jacks. The breakers were built by the United States Army Corps of Engineers to withstand the area's heavy seas, and were featured by Huell Howser On PBS's \\"California's Gold\\" (Episode #803). Samoa peninsula includes the Manila and Samoa Dunes, some of the most ecologically diverse areas in California, and stretches to the Arcata Bottoms. The peninsula is about long by . This area is vulnerable to tsunamis as its average height above sea level is only . It also contains the unincorporated community of Manila and a United States Coast Guard station. Residential expansion is proposed that would double the size of Manila, which currently has neither fire or police services of its own. The ZIP Code is 95564. The community is inside area code 707. USS H-3 Beached at Samoa 6 April 1917 The seaward side of the peninsula is Samoa Beach. The great green combers of winter gales hump and crest about a half- mile offshore where the swell curve parallels the shoreline. During such storms, little can be seen between the breakers and the beach except the smoky spume of crests blown off by the wind. Varying currents and a high incidence of foggy days caused mariners to call the approach to Humboldt Bay a \\"graveyard of the Pacific\\" in days before modern navigational aids were available. Even when the fog bank was no more than a threat on the horizon, landmarks on the higher ground east of Humboldt Bay were obscured by a low overcast of smoke from lumber mills and homes using wood fuel.Haislip, February 1967, pp.35-36 Despite the construction of the Humboldt Harbor Light and the Table Bluff Light at least twenty-seven vessels had gone ashore in this vicinityHaislip, February 1967, p.35 before the cruiser USS Milwaukee (C-21) grounded here on 13 January 1917 and broke up in the pounding surf.Haislip, February 1967, pp.46-48 The cruiser, disregarding recommendations of local mariners, was attempting to salvage the submarine USS H-3 (SS-30).Haislip, February 1967, pp.45-46 The submarine had gone aground on 15 December 1916; and its crew were living in tents on the beach.Haislip, February 1967, p.38 The submarine was later salvaged by the Mercer-Fraser Company building a track of balks across the Samoa peninsula and jacking the submarine up onto rollers to be towed across and relaunched into Humboldt Bay.Haislip, February 1967, p.49 Climate This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 71.6 ¬∞F and cold raining winters that include a fog layer in the mornings.

On 19 May 1963, he scored all the goals in a 3‚Äì0 home win against V√©lez Sarsfield, and also featured in that year's Copa Libertadores final loss against Pel√©'s Santos FC; in his final two years in La Bombonera, he added a further two national championships. Corbatta joined Independiente Medell√≠n in 1965, remaining in Colombia for three years. He returned to his country for spells with lower league sides San Telmo, Italia Unidos and Tiro Federal, retiring from football at the age of 38. During his professional career, he only missed four of 68 penalties. International career Corbatta played a total of 43 games for Argentina in which he scored 18 goals, at one time ranking in joint-13th place with Domingo Tarasconi.Argentina ‚Äì Record International Players; at RSSSF He was part of the South American Championship-winning team in 1957, when he formed a legendary attacking line with Humberto Maschio, Antonio Angelillo, Omar S√≠vori and Osvaldo Cruz.

Festival is one of Europe's biggest hip hop and reggae festivals. It used to take place at the Oberrabenstein reservoir near Chemnitz, Germany until 2006. In 2007 and 2008 the festival was held on the Pouch peninsula in Bitterfeld, Saxony-Anhalt. Since 2009 the Ferropolis in Gr√§fenhainichen has been the site of the Splash! festival. The first Splash! took place in 1998 in the inner city of Chemnitz, in a former powerhouse. From 1999 on, it was located on a hillside of the Oberrabenstein reservoir. In the early years there were two stages, one for hip hop, and one for reggae. In 2006, the festival had extended to six stages and four party tents. The hip hop stage is adjacent to the reservoir, visitors can see the concerts while bathing. In addition to hip hop and drum and bass DJs, the tents also house dancehall and reggae sound systems, a graffiti contest and ITF matches. The name \\"Splash\\" hints at the waterside location of the festival and the phrase \\"to make a splash\\". History * 1998 - The first Splash! took place in 1998, but not as planned as an open air festival, but in the inner city of Chemnitz in a former powerhouse. It was relatively small (and could be more accurately described as a jam) and counted only 1,300 visitors and six performers, among who were Afrob and KC da Rookee. *1999 & 2000 - Being held hillside the Oberrabenstein reservoir from 1999 on, the Splash! had earned its name, attracting 13,000 fans and steadily gaining popularity. In 2000, the festival had 20,000 visitors. * 2001- More than 30,000 tickets were sold in 2001, and the organiser limited the quantity of tickets for sale to 25,000 for the next years, in order to stay true to the basic idea of the festival - party in a relaxing atmosphere and a high quality lineup. * 2005 & 2006 - Heavy rain led to declining visitor numbers, causing severe financial losses. * 2007 - Donations helped to balance the losses of about 70% of 2006, and the festival organisation announced on 11 January 2007 that the festival will take place, not in Chemnitz but on the Pouch peninsula in Bitterfeld. Financial crisis \\"Save Splash!\\" button The meeting of creditors in the insolvency proceedings was held on 9 January 2007. According to a Chemnitz newspaper, the debt amounted to over ‚Ç¨500,000.

It is a member of the Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. Synopsis The poet expresses his complete pleasure in the presence of his beloved, but says that his devotion resembles that of a miser to his money, filled with anxiety combined with pleasure in his wealth. Structure Sonnet 75 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form, ABAB CDCD EFEF GG, and is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 4th line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found. (75.4) The 6th line exhibits two common variations: an initial reversal and a final extrametrical syllable or feminine ending: / √ó √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / (√ó) Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure; (75.6) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. (√ó) = extrametrical syllable. Line 8 necessarily repeats the 6th line's feminine ending. Possible initial reversals also occur in lines 1, 2, 3, 9, 12, and 13; though these can be interpreted in other ways. The meter demands a few variant pronunciations: in the 2nd line, \\"showers\\" functions as 1 syllable, and in the 10th line \\"starv√®d\\" functions as 2.

The proposal also calls for a monthly payment to households of citizens and legal resident aliens (based on family size) as an advance rebate of tax on purchases up to the poverty level. A key question surrounding the FairTax rate is the ability to be revenue-neutral; that is, whether its proposed monetary numbers would result in an increase or reduction in overall federal tax revenues, and if so how large this disparity would be. Economists, advisory groups, and political advocacy groups disagree about the tax rate required for the FairTax to be truly revenue-neutral. Researchers can use a different tax base, time frame, or methodology that make direct comparison among estimates difficult. The choice between static or dynamic scoring further complicates any estimate of revenue-neutral rates. Proponents offer studies that calculate the tax rate consistent with the legislation (23% inclusive), while critics argue that the rate would need to be much higher and offer competing estimates. Supporters argue that if the rate seems too high or is otherwise higher, it brings to light the cost of the federal government and the true tax burden Congress has levied on the American taxpayer. Bruce Bartlett has stated that \\"public opinion polls have long shown that support for flat-rate tax reforms is extremely sensitive to the proposed rate, with support dropping off sharply at a rate higher than 23%.\\" If the FairTax is presented like all real world U.S. sales taxes and foreign VATs (tax-exclusive), the rate would be presented as 30%. Opponents argue the 30% tax-exclusive figure is better understood by the general populace and that the use of the 23% tax-inclusive number is deceptive and misleading. Proponents state that the 23% presentation is easier to compare to the inclusive income tax rates being replaced. Tax rate for revenue neutrality The primary rate presented adheres to the legislative framework of the FairTax bill in rate presentation, which is calculated as a percentage of total spending, sometimes called a tax-inclusive rate. The rate presentation of a traditional sales tax may also be included and is referred to as the tax-exclusive rate (see Presentation of tax rate). Early research Americans For Fair Taxation (AFFT) states that early research at Stanford University, the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, and Fiscal Associates have calculated revenue-neutral rates between 22.3% and 24%. Jim Poterba of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimated a rate of 23.1% and Laurence Kotlikoff of Boston University found a rate of around 24%. Dale Jorgenson, a professor of economics at Harvard University and past President of the American Economic Association, purportedly estimated the revenue- neutral rate to be 22.9% but indicated in his 2002 book that he believes the rate would need to be higher. The research was commissioned by AFFT and they have not made these studies public. The studies are also not published by the economists that conducted those studies. Critics have stated that the early studies failed to properly account for the additional revenue required for the increased government spending needed pay the FairTax on their purchases. Recent studies One of the leading economists supporting the FairTax is Dr. Laurence Kotlikoff of Boston University. A detailed 2006 study published in Tax Notes by Beacon Hill Institute at Suffolk University and Dr. Kotlikoff concluded the FairTax would be revenue-neutral for the tax year 2007 at a rate of 23.82% (31.27% tax-exclusive) assuming full taxpayer compliance. The study states that purchasing power is transferred to state and local taxpayers from state and local governments. To recapture the lost revenue, state and local governments may raise taxes in order to continue collecting the same real revenues from their taxpayers. State and local governments would be able to maintain their real spending levels, despite the requirement that they pay the FairTax on their purchases. The Argus Group and Arduin, Laffer & Moore Econometrics each published an analysis that defended the 23% rate. While proponents of the FairTax concede that the above studies did not explicitly account for tax evasion, they also claim that the studies did not altogether ignore tax evasion under the FairTax. These studies implicitly incorporated some degree of tax evasion in their calculations simply by using National Income and Product Account based figures that presumably understate total household consumption. Moreover, these studies did not account for the expected capital gains that would result from a reduction in the real nominal value of U.S. government debt and the increased economic growth that economists believe would occur. In contrast to the above studies, one of the leading economists opposing the FairTax, William Gale of the Brookings Institution, published a detailed 2005 study in Tax Notes that estimated a rate of 28.2% (39.3% tax-exclusive) for 2007 assuming full taxpayer compliance and an average rate of 31% (44% tax-exclusive) from 2006-2015 (an increase that accounts for the replacement of an additional $3 trillion in revenue collected through the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) impacting the middle class over the 10-year period). The study also concluded that if the tax base were eroded by 10% due to tax evasion, tax avoidance, and/or legislative adjustments, the average rate would be 34% (53% tax-exclusive) for the 10-year period. The study did not take into consideration the increase in economic activity that Gale expects would result from the imposition of the FairTax. Additional sales tax studies Additional studies have been performed on national retail sales tax plans that may not conform to the tax base as defined in the FairTax legislation but are often considered when discussing FairTax rates. These studies are often of prior sales tax legislation, similar tax models, or based on the assumption that the tax base used in the FairTax legislation is illogical or likely to be modified by Congress before passage. The President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform performed a 2006 analysis to replace the individual and corporate income tax (excluding other taxes) with a retail sales tax and found the rate to be 25% (34% tax- exclusive) assuming 15% tax evasion, and 33% (49% tax-exclusive) with 30% tax evasion. The rate would need to be substantially higher to replace the additional taxes replaced by the FairTax (payroll, estate, and gift taxes). The Chairman of the President's Advisory Panel, former U.S. Senator Connie Mack, stated that the panel did not evaluate H.R. 25 (the FairTax). The panel was not allowed to consider reforming regressive payroll taxes and they reduced the tax base by adding large exclusions. In determining the rate, the panel assumed that revenue generated from taxing federal spending would be canceled out by increased government expenditures required to pay such taxes, a factor the panel claims was neglected from early FairTax rate analysis. The Treasury Department has refused to release for peer review the detailed figures and methodology used in the tax panel analysis. FairTax proponents, the Beacon Hill Institute, and Dr. Kotlikoff have criticized the President's Advisory Panel's study as having altered the terms of the FairTax and using unsound methodology. The Treasury Department estimates (prepared for the Tax Panel) excluded government consumption, significantly altering the tax base and therefore the tax rate. Other studies point out that the current system is also counting taxes the government would pay to itself by including matched payroll taxes of government employees, covering the corporate and payroll tax expenses of its contractors and their suppliers, and paying embedded tax costs under the current system (see Theories of retail pricing). The tax panel included large expenditures to local and state governments for the FairTax burden; however, the Beacon Hill Institute suggested a flaw in this logic and showed that the FairTax imposes no additional real fiscal burdens on state and local government. A similar level of taxation is required when shifting from taxing income to consumption in order to maintain the tax burden on government. Proponents assert that government needs to be taxed to keep a level playing field between government enterprises and private enterprises. Dr. Karen Walby, Director of Research for the Americans For Fair Taxation, discussed a recent study by Young & Associates on evasion and enforcement that identifies certain key variables which influence the level of compliance (marginal tax rates, likelihood of audit, severity of penalties, etc.) and concludes the FairTax is superior on most/all of these and would therefore have lower rates of evasion than alternatives. While the FairTax studies did not account for tax evasion, neither did they ignore it. The studies have implicitly incorporated a significant degree of tax evasion in calculations simply by using National Income and Product Account based figures that understate total household consumption. In addition, the studies did not account for the capital gain stemming from the reduction in the real nominal value of U.S. government debt and the increased economic growth that economists and FairTax supporters believe would occur. Congress's bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) evaluated a proposal similar to FairTax that included additional exemptions and estimated a revenue-neutral rate of around 36%. In a 2004 study, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) compensated for factors which artificially enlarge the economic base prior to collection of American sales tax in reality (government transactions, non- financial transactions, tax exemptions, evasion, etc.) to the FairTax's supposed tax base, concluding that either the FairTax would have to be increased to 53%, or its originally proposed 30% rate would fall short of FY2005 federal revenues by 41%. Proponents charge that the Presidential Tax Panel, the JCT, and ITEP are motivated to maintain the \\"status quo\\" and thus modify the tax base from the proposed legislation to achieve higher rates, and conclude that since opponents could not kill the FairTax proposal based on merits or lack thereof; they create their own plan with an exaggerated rate to make it politically not feasible. The FairTax would apply to a purported gross base of $11.467 trillion, theoretically one-third larger than the income tax base of $9.706 trillion. For that reason, the average marginal rate of such a tax base under the FairTax would be, by definition, significantly lower than current law. If the rate is too high, no matter what the rate, it brings to light the cost of the federal government and the true tax burden Congress has levied on the American taxpayer (see Tax burden visibility). The Secretary of the Treasury, Henry M. Paulson, stated in 2006 that he would investigate the FairTax in a very comprehensive way using resources outside the Treasury.

Parsons began his career playing Second XI cricket in 2002, and made his most recent appearance in the competition in August 2006. In between he played occasional limited overs cricket, though he didn't get his debut first-class start until May 2005. While Parsons made little contribution with the bat, his, and the rest of the team's, bowling against opponents Lancashire was expensive, as the match was played out to a draw. Parsons would play County Cricket on one further occasion, against Derbyshire, where once again his performance was marked by his wild bowling and his inability, in the second innings, to attain a partnership long enough to secure the first of three consecutive scores of fifty or above for batting partner and namesake Keith Parsons. Parsons attained one cap for the England Under-19 cricket team, representing the team in a defeat against South Africa Under-19s in August 2003. Since his exit from first-class cricket, Parsons has played one game for Minor Counties side Devon. Career highlights: Playing against a strong New Zealand side in 2004 where Parsons produced an impressive bowling display to finish with figures of 6 for 30 off 10 overs.
