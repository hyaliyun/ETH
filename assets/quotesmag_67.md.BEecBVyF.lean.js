Afterlight can be considered a sequel to Dynamic Stillness: its creation originated immediately upon the completion of the latter album; a quote inside the album artwork reads, \\"after the stillness...comes the afterlight\\"; and both albums feature stark landscape-themed artwork created by Michal Karcz.

In such a network the source and destination cannot communicate to each other directly because the distance between the source and destination is greater than the transmission range of both of them, hence the need for intermediate node(s) to relay. A relay network is a type of network used to send information between two devices, for e.g. server and computer, that are too far away to send the information to each other directly. Thus the network must send or \\"relay\\" the information to different devices, referred to as nodes, that pass on the information to its destination. A well-known example of a relay network is the Internet. A user can view a web page from a server halfway around the world by sending and receiving the information through a series of connected nodes. In many ways, a relay network resembles a chain of people standing together. One person has a note he needs to pass to the girl at the end of the line. He is the sender, she is the recipient, and the people in between them are the messengers, or the nodes. He passes the message to the first node, or person, who passes it to the second and so on until it reaches the girl and she reads it. The people might stand in a circle, however, instead of a line. Each person is close enough to reach the person on either side of him and across from him. Together the people represent a network and several messages can now pass around or through the network in different directions at once, as opposed to the straight line that could only run messages in a specific direction. This concept, the way a network is laid out and how it shares data, is known as network topology. Relay networks can use many different topologies, from a line to a ring to a tree shape, to pass along information in the fastest and most efficient way possible. Often the relay network is complex and branches off in multiple directions to connect many servers and computers. Where two lines from two different computers or servers meet forms the nodes of the relay network. Two computer lines might run into the same router, for example, making this the node. Wireless networks also take advantage of the relay network system. A laptop, for example, might connect to a wireless network which sends and receives information through another network and another until it reaches its destination. Even though not all parts of the network have physical wires, they still connect to other devices that function as the nodes. This type of network holds several advantages. Information can travel long distances, even if the sender and receiver are far apart. It also speeds up data transmission by choosing the best path to travel between nodes to the receiver's computer. If one node is too busy, the information is simply routed to a different one. Without relay networks, sending an email from one computer to another would require the two computers be hooked directly together before it could work.

Development  The IS-5 Kaczka (Duck) was designed by T. Kosti and I. Kaniewska, and built at the Jeżów Glider Workshop, as a research aircraft to investigate tail-first canard aircraft. The all-wood fuselage was formed from a semi-monocoque shell to form a pod under the wing containing the cockpit, with a nose extending forwards to support the canard surfaces. At the rear of the nacelle an airbrake was formed from two halves of the fuselage opening outwards, in similar fashion to the airbrakes on certain jet attack aircraft, like the Hawker-Siddeley Buccaneer (at the rear of the fuselage) and Grumman A-6 Intruder (at the wing-tips). The wings were of conventional construction with a ply-covered torsion box forming the leading edge forward of the mainspar and fabric-covered ribs to the rear of the main-spar. Ovoid-shaped fins with rudders were fitted at the wing-tips; also skids for support when static on the ground. The use of drag rudders was also investigated with the rudders opening in similar fashion to the airbrake, increasing drag on one side and yawing the aircraft. The centre of gravity was also adjustable in flight, with a 7 kg (15 lb) weight, on a fore-aft orientated threaded rod, which could be adjusted by the pilot. The sole prototype SP-821 first flew on 29 Mar 1949 piloted by Eng. P. Mynarski. Trials continued until 1957. The IS-5 was reported to have good flying characteristics and was easy to fly. After completion of tests the aircraft was lodged with the Lodz gliding club where it was destroyed in a hangar fire in 1961.

Adeogun-Phillips MCIArb Background He was the son of Professor Anthony Adeyemi Adeogun, Professor Emeritus of Commercial and Industrial Law and Deputy Vice-Chancellor, University of Lagos, an international labour law expert. His mother, Margaret Amba Ayinke Adeogun (née Williams), is a retired nurse and midwife. He is a grandson of Phillip Bamgbose and Theresa Fatola Adeogun of Ajale Compound Igbajo, Osun State, Federal Republic of Nigeria, and of Henry Isaac Kobina- Badu Williams, of Cape Coast, Republic of Ghana and Joanna Olasumbo Williams of Itesi, Abeokuta, Ogun State, Federal Republic of Nigeria. His name \\"Ayodeji\\" means \\"My joy is doubled\\" in Yoruba Education He was educated at C.M.S Grammar School, Lagos, Nigeria's first secondary school (founded in 1859) and at Repton School in Derbyshire, England. He read law at Warwick University from where he graduated in 1989 and at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London, where he obtained his master's degree in International Commercial Arbitration and ADR in 1994. He was admitted as a Barrister and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Nigeria in 1992 and in 1996, as a Solicitor of the Supreme Court of England and Wales. Legal career International legal career In March 2001 at the age 35, he was appointed senior trial attorney and lead counsel at the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, leading teams of international lawyers in the prosecution of persons involved in the 1994 Rwandan genocide in which an estimated 800,000 civilians were killed.Charles A. Adeogun-Phillips in Rwanda His work on behalf of the victims and survivors of the 1994 Rwandan genocide has been the subject of several books including--\\"Le Tribunal des vaincus: UN Nuremberg pour le Rwanda?\\" (the court of the defeated) by Thierry Cruvellier\\"Guilty pleas in international criminal law\\" by Nancy Amoury Combs, published by Stanford University Press in 2007, Books.google.com and annotated leading cases of international criminal tribunals.André Klip and Goran Sluiter, Intersentia 2005 He also appears in a documentary film entitled Towards Reconciliation, Produced by the United Nations in 2004. The genocide trial which he led between 2001 and 2002 against Pastor Elizaphan Ntakirutimana—the leader of the Seventh Day Adventist Church who was transferred to the UN Court from the United States, was the subject of a book written by the American author Philip Gourevitch entitled \\"we wish to inform you that tomorrow we will be killed with our families\\". He also led the trial against serial rapist Mikaeli Muhimana involving charges of sexual violence and cruelty against women between 2004 and 2005. The Muhimana case clarified and developed the jurisprudence of the international criminal tribunals on the legal elements and definition of the crime of rape in the context of large scale and widespread international crimes. Having led complex plea negotiations in the Vincent Rutaganira – Paul Bisengimana trials between 2004 and 2007—resulting in guilty pleas to serious violations of international humanitarian law, Adeogun-Phillips is one of the few international litigation lawyers in the world who have contributed to the development and practice of guilty plea negotiations in the context of large-scale international crimes. In addition, between 17 June and 2 October 2009, he led a team of international prosecutors the retrial of Tharcisse Muvunyi on the charges of direct and public incitement to commit genocide. He had led the original trial in the said case between 28 February 2005 and 23 June 2006 following which the defendant was convicted. On 29 August 2008, the Appeals Chamber reversed all the convictions against the defendant and ordered a retrial on the charge of direct and public incitement to commit genocide. The retrial in the Muvunyi case in 2009 was the first of its kind before any of the international tribunals. Other notable international genocide trials he has led include that of the former Deputy-Governor, Dominique Ntawukulilyayo, in 2009; that of the former Finance Minister – Emmanuel Ndindabahizi between 2003 and 2004ICTR.org Retrieved 20 October 2009. and that of the former Governor of Kigali-Francois Karera between 2006 and 2007.

Since commencing his practice as an international litigation lawyer over a decade ago, he has to date prosecuted twelve genocide trials before an international court, ten of which he led successfully as senior trial attorney and lead counsel. He has prevailed in trials against some of the world's most reputed litigation lawyers including Ramsey Clarke-–the 66th Attorney-General of the United States (1967–69) and lawyer to controversial figures such as Slobodan Milošević, Radovan Karadžić and Saddam Hussein; Edward Medvene-–who represented Fred Goldman in the civil action against O.

It refers to the conviction of certain Reformed Protestant theologians that the church must continually re-examine itself in order to maintain its purity of doctrine and practice. An early example is Jodocus van Lodenstein, Beschouwinge van Zion (Contemplation of Zion), Amsterdam, 1674–78,Michael Bush, \\"Calvin and the Reformanda Sayings,\\" in Herman J. Selderhuis, ed., Calvinus sacrarum literarum interpres: Papers of the International Congress on Calvin Research (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 2008) p. 286. who claims the \\"truth… that also in the Church there is always much to reform\\" (\\"Sekerlijk de Gereformeerde Waarheyd… leert dat in de Kerke ook altijd veel te herstellen is\\".Cited according to Theodor Mahlmann, p. 423.). A variation of the term, Ecclesia reformata semper reformanda (\\"the reformed church [must] always be reformed\\"), also used by Karl Barth, refers to the desire of an \\"erudite man\\" cited by Jodocus van Lodenstein that the Church should not be called \\"Reformata\\", but \\"Reformanda\\".Cf. Theodor Mahlmann, p. 387. It is widely but informally used in Reformed and Presbyterian churches today (for example, the French Reformed Church use \\"Ecclesia reformata, semper reformanda\\" as motto).

The development comprises 1,350 apartments on eight artificial islands, separated by dug-out canals. On each island is an enclosed block of four-to-seven stories, surrounding a sheltered courtyard with public access. The buildings often stand directly on the canals, while bridges, wharfs and \\"ghats\\" allow direct contact with the water. The development was designed by the Danish firm of architects Arkitema in collaboration with the Dutch architects Sjoerd Soeters, but to ensure a varied cityscape the facades of individual townhouses were designed by 20 different architecture practices. History The Sluseholmen peninsula used to house heavy industry, including a Ford car factory. As industry left the area, a plan was conceived to develop Sluseholmen into a canal district. This was the result of co-operation between Sjoerd Soeters, Arkitema, the Port of Copenhagen and the City of Copenhagen. Construction started in 2004, the first residents arrived in 2007, and by 2008 development of the new canal district had been completed. Architecture The general concept for the area was developed by Sjoerd Soeters and Arkitema, with inspiration from the artificial island residential development in Amsterdam. Arkitema also developed the shell structures. To ensure a varied cityscape, inspired by Copenhagen vernacular architecture from around 1900, the facades of individual townhouses were designed by 20 different Danish architecture firms. Arkitema drew up a list of rules governing the materials used, colours, and the proportions of the facade designs. It was also decided that at least five different firms had to be involved in the design of each island. The result is lively and imaginative block housing, highly diverse in appearance.

Walt Disney Studios has been criticised for including stereotypical portrayal of non-white characters, sexism and allegations of plagiarism. Some of Disney's various business ventures, including television networks, theme parks, and product lines have also sparked controversy among groups of consumers and media outlets. Company officials Michael Eisner In 1977, Roy E. Disney, the son of Disney co- founder Roy O. Disney and nephew of Walt Disney, resigned as an executive due to disagreements with his colleagues' decisions at the time. As he claimed later, \\"I just felt creatively the company was not going anywhere interesting. It was very stifling.\\" However, he retained a seat on the board of directors. His resignation from the board in 1984, which occurred in the midst of a corporate takeover battle, was the beginning of a series of developments that led to the replacement of company president and CEO Ronald William Miller (married to Walt's daughter Diane Marie Disney) by Michael Eisner and Frank Wells. Roy soon returned to the company as vice-chairman of the board of directors and head of the animation department. Michael Eisner has been criticized for his management style. The book DisneyWar by James B. Stewart is an exposé of Eisner's 20-year tenure as Chairman and CEO at The Walt Disney Company. Stewart describes some of the following: * The struggle to get Who Framed Roger Rabbit made in time and on budget despite the ambitions of Robert Zemeckis and Richard Williams to make the film bigger and bolder * Eisner's tension with Frank Wells before Wells' death * Eisner's friendship-turned- rivalry with Jeffrey Katzenberg * Eisner's tension with Michael Ovitz during Ovitz's short-lived presidency * The purchase of the ABC Family channel and its content and the fallout resulting from Disney's inability to revive it * Hilary Duff's decision to quit the Disney Channel because of low salary * Financing of the film Fahrenheit 9/11 * Pixar's decision not to renew its relationship with Disney * The hostile takeover attempt by Comcast. In 2003, Roy resigned from his positions as Disney vice chairman and chairman of Walt Disney Feature Animation, accusing Eisner of micromanagement, flops with the ABC television network, timidity in the theme park business, turning The Walt Disney Company into a \\"rapacious, soul-less\\" company, and refusing to establish a clear succession plan, as well as a string of box-office movie flops starting in the year 2000. On March 3, 2004, at Disney's annual shareholders' meeting, a surprising 43% of Disney's shareholders, predominantly rallied by former board members Roy Disney and Stanley Gold, withheld their proxies to re-elect Eisner to the board. Disney's board then gave the chairmanship position to George J. Mitchell. However, the board did not immediately remove Eisner as chief executive. On March 13, 2005, Eisner announced that he would step down as CEO one year before his contract expired. On September 30, Eisner resigned both as an executive and as a member of the board of directors, and, severing all formal ties with the company, he waived his contractual rights to perks such as the use of a corporate jet and an office at the company's Burbank headquarters. Eisner's replacement was his longtime assistant, Robert Iger. Walt Disney Studios Walt Disney Animation Studios Ethnic and racial stereotyping Over the years many scholars, film critics, and parent groups have been critical of Disney for the stereotypical portrayal of non-white characters, which they attributed to Walt Disney being racist. For example, during a story meeting on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, he referred to the scene when the dwarfs pile on top of each other as a \\"[N-word] pile\\" and during casting of Song of the South he used the term pickaninny. Other examples cited included the short Mickey's Mellerdrammer where Mickey Mouse dresses in blackface, the stereotypical \\"Black\\" Bird in the short Who Killed Cock Robin, Sunflower the half- zebra/half-African servant centaurette in Fantasia, the film Song of the South which depicts an idealized version of the lives of former slaves, the depiction of Native American 'Indians' as savages in Peter Pan, the cunning and manipulative Siamese cats Si and Am in Lady and the Tramp and the poor and uneducated crows in Dumbo. Since its release in 1992, Disney's Aladdin has been accused of perpetuating racial and ethnic stereotypes of Arabs. In July 1993, Disney announced that it would alter a line in the film's opening song, \\"Arabian Nights,\\" written by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken. In the original film, the song featured the lyrics, \\"Where they cut off your ear if they don't like your face/It's barbaric, but hey, it's home.\\" After Arab-American groups complained that the line was derogatory to Middle Easterners, Disney amended the lyrics in later editions of the film to an alternate lyric written by Ashman: \\"Where it's flat and immense and the heat is intense/It's barbaric, but hey, it's home.\\" Menken approved the change before its adoption, as did the estate of Ashman, who had died before the film's completion. The American- Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee further requested that the word \\"barbaric\\" be removed; however, Disney refused this, claiming that the word appeared in all versions of Ashman's text and it referred to the film's desert setting in the altered lyrics. Don Bustany, president of the ADC's Los Angeles chapter, argued that the existing alterations were \\"nowhere near adequate, considering the racism depicted in Aladdin...there still remains the very sleazy, burlesque character in the prologue and the scene where a merchant is going to cut off the hand of Princess Jasmine because she took an apple from his stand to give to a hungry child.\\" A March 1995 article published on the ADC's website further criticized Aladdin for depicting the film's protagonists, Aladdin and Jasmine, with light skin and Anglicized features, in contrast to dark-skinned merchants and palace guards who were cruel, greedy, and vicious while featuring Arab accents and distorted facial features. Shortly after the film's release, Jack Shaheen, a professor of mass communications at Southern Illinois University, said that “Aladdin is not an entertaining Arabian Nights fantasy as film critics would have us believe, but rather a painful reminder to 3 million Americans of Arab heritage, as well as 300 million Arabs and others, that the abhorrent Arab stereotype is as ubiquitous as Aladdin’s lamp.” Sexism In 1938, The Walt Disney Company sent a rejection letter to Mary Ford, stating that \\"girls are not considered\\" for creative positions. The letter was rediscovered in 2009 when Ford's grandson uploaded the image on Flickr. The letter received greater attention on January 7, 2014 when, after congratulating Emma Thompson for her Best Actress win at the National Board of Review Awards, Meryl Streep referenced the letter. Referencing Thompson's film, Saving Mr. Banks, Streep responded \\"It must have killed [Disney] to encounter a woman, an equally disdainful and superior creature, a person dismissive of his own considerable gifts and prodigious output and imagination.\\" In response to Streep's statements, many Disney scholars and artists defended Disney, including Disney Legend Floyd Norman, who said \\"Much has changed, and changed for the better.\\" Other journalists found the speech ironic, noting that Streep just finished filming the then-upcoming Disney film, Into the Woods. The Walt Disney Company has also been criticized for the lack of feminist values seen on the older, original Disney Princesses. Snow White in particular is under constant criticism for her lack of feminist ideals. The film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) features a main protagonist who, at the time, fit the domestic and docile expectations of women in the pre-World War II era. Snow White is displayed on screen covered in a long dress, embellished with a white collar, puffy sleeves, red cape, and a red bow constraining her hair; a traditional, modest look on feminity by revealing minimal skin. Through her actions portrayed in the movie, she draws on the traditional femininity that was encouraged in 1930's American culture. In the midst of the Great Depression, women were encouraged to return to the home and care for the household, a theme that is widely displayed in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). However, with the second resurgence of Disney movies, known as the Disney Renaissance, beginning in 1989 until 1999, Disney transformed the damsel in distress into a strong woman with a desire for adventure. This new approach ushered in a decade of go-getting, proactive heroines, who possessed character traits that coincided with the new era of acceptable sexual roles in a society where women hold the same jobs as men. This is evident in princesses such as Ariel from The Little Mermaid (1989), and Belle from Beauty and the Beast (1991). Plagiarism Several of Disney's animated feature films have been accused of plagiarizing existing works. The most notable and controversial example is The Lion King, which critics allege was plagiarized from Osamu Tezuka's Japanese manga ジャングル大帝 Janguru Taitei i.e. Jungle Emperor and its anime adaptation of the same name (in Japan). This TV series was in turn dubbed and retitled Kimba the White Lion for English-speaking audiences by Titan Productions for NBC from 1965 to 1966, and it premiered on Los Angeles' KHJ-TV in September 1966. After Kimba's original run in the United States ended in the autumn of 1967, the series was shown in syndication on TV stations across the U.S. through September 30, 1978. As a number of media journalists and fans watched The Lion King after its initial release in 1994, they noticed characters and events in the story resembling those of Kimba. Although the two works follow different screenplays, there are strong artistic similarities, and The Lion King contains numerous sequences that closely match up with Kimba′s. Other similarities are thematically deeper and more pronounced, such as that both feature the theme of the circle of life. Alleged similarities in the characters, beginning with the protagonist lion cubs Kimba and Simba, include the evil lions, the one-eyed Claw and Scar, the sage baboons Dan'l Baboon and Rafiki, the animated birds Pauley Cracker and Zazu, and the pair of hyena sidekicks (it was a trio in the Disney film). The Lion King co-director Rob Minkoff deflected criticism of similarities in the characters by stating it was \\"not unusual to have characters like a baboon, a bird or hyenas\\" in films set in Africa. Both films feature the protagonist looking up at cloudbursts in the shape of his father lion, as pointed out by Frederick L. Schodt. The similarity is alluded to in a scene from The Simpsons episode \\"'Round Springfield\\", where a parody of Mufasa (voiced by Harry Shearer) in the clouds tells Lisa Simpson, \\"You must avenge my death, Kimba...dah, I mean Simba!\\"., note 53. (updated Dec 06, 2017) Matthew Broderick has said that when he was hired as the voice of adult Simba in The Lion King, he presumed the project was related to Kimba the White Lion.

C15. \\"I thought he meant Kimba, who was a white lion in a cartoon when I was a little kid,\\" said Broderick. \\"So I kept telling everybody I was going to play Kimba. I didn't really know anything about it, but I didn't really care.\\" In addition, a memo written by Roy E. Disney in July 1993 refers to Simba as \\"Kimba,\\" causing critics to claim that Disney was aware of the similarities. Upon the release of The Lion King in Japan, multiple Japanese cartoonists including Machiko Satonaka signed a letter urging the Walt Disney Company acknowledge due credit to Jungle Emperor Leo in the making of The Lion King. As Tim Hornyak wrote in The Japan Times, \\"The Tezuka–Disney connection extends back decades before the movie. Tezuka met Walt Disney at the 1964 New York World's Fair, and Disney said he hoped to \\"make something just like\\" Tezuka's Astro Boy. The Lion King director Roger Allers claimed he remained unfamiliar with Kimba throughout production until his movie was nearly completed; co-director Rob Minkoff also said he was unfamiliar with Kimba. In March 2014, animator Kelly Wilson sued Disney for plagiarism, alleging that the teaser trailer for Frozen was similar to her short film The Snowman. After four months of legal battling, federal judge Vince Chhabria ruled in Wilson's favor, citing evidence that Disney was aware of The Snowman and \\"the sequence of both works, from start to finish, is too parallel to conclude that no reasonable juror could find the works substantially similar.\\" In April 2015, Chhabria explained that several Pixar employees had attended the 2011 San Francisco International Film Festival, in which The Snowman was screened four times alongside the Pixar short Play by Play. In June 2015, Entertainment Weekly reported that Disney had agreed to settle the case. In March 2017, a year after the release of Disney's animated film Zootopia, screenwriter and producer Gary Goldman sued Disney, claiming that he had pitched a similar idea to the studio in 2000 and again in 2009. According to a story in The Hollywood Reporter, Goldman alleged that Disney had stolen the film's title and various artwork from him after he offered the project. A Disney spokesperson dismissed the accusations, declaring that \\"Mr. Goldman's lawsuit is riddled with patently false allegations. It is an unprincipled attempt to lay claim to a successful film he didn't create, and we will vigorously defend against it in court.\\" Homosexual reference in Disney films Controversy was stirred in the live action remake Beauty and the Beast (2017), when Bill Condon announced that Lefou would come out as a gay character and dance with a man named Stanly. As a result a theater in Henagar, Alabama refused to screen the film.https://www.huffpost.com/entry/beauty-and-the-beast-gay- controversy_n_58cc264ae4b0be71dcf498e5 Pixar's relationship with Disney Pixar and Disney had disagreements after the production of Toy Story 2. Originally intended as a straight-to-video release (and thus not part of Pixar's five-picture deal), the film was eventually upgraded to a theatrical release during production. Pixar demanded that the film then be counted toward the five-picture agreement, but Disney refused. Pixar's first five feature films had collectively grossed more than $2.5 billion, equivalent to the highest per-film average gross in the industry. Though profitable for both, Pixar later complained that the arrangement was not equitable. Pixar was responsible for creation and production, while Disney handled marketing and distribution. Profits and production costs were split 50-50, but Disney exclusively owned all story and sequel rights and also collected a distribution fee. The lack of story and sequel rights was perhaps the most onerous aspect to Pixar and set the stage for a contentious relationship. The two companies attempted to reach a new agreement in early 2004. The new deal would be only for distribution, as Pixar intended to control production and own the resulting film properties themselves. The company also wanted to finance their films on their own and collect 100 percent of the profits, paying Disney only the 10 to 15 percent distribution fee. More importantly, as part of any distribution agreement with Disney, Pixar demanded control over films already in production under their old agreement, including The Incredibles and Cars. Disney considered these conditions unacceptable, but Pixar would not concede. Disagreements between Steve Jobs and then-Disney Chairman and CEO Michael Eisner made the negotiations more difficult than they otherwise might have been. They broke down completely in mid-2004, with Jobs declaring that Pixar was actively seeking partners other than Disney. Pixar did not enter negotiations with other distributors. After a lengthy hiatus, negotiations between the two companies resumed following the departure of Eisner from Disney in September 2005. In preparation for potential fallout between Pixar and Disney, Jobs announced in late 2004 that Pixar would no longer release movies at the Disney-dictated November time frame, but during the more lucrative early summer months. This would also allow Pixar to release DVDs during the Christmas shopping season. An added benefit of delaying Cars was to extend the time frame remaining on the Pixar-Disney contract to see how things would play out between the two companies. Pending the Disney acquisition of Pixar in 2006, the two companies created a distribution deal for the intended 2007 release of Ratatouille, in case the acquisition fell through, to ensure that this one film would still be released through Disney's distribution channels (in contrast to the earlier Pixar deal, Ratatouille was to remain a Pixar property and Disney would have received only a distribution fee). The completion of Disney's Pixar acquisition, however, nullified this distribution arrangement. Miramax and its handling of foreign films Formerly a subsidiary of Disney from 1993 to 2010, Miramax has come under criticism for its editing, dubbing, and replacing the soundtracks of various foreign films that it releases. One notable example is Iron Monkey which, though released subtitled, had its subtitles altered to remove the political context of the story, had scenes trimmed and changed for violence and pacing, and had the soundtrack changed, removing the famous Wong Fei Hung theme. Other films that they have altered in this way include Shaolin Soccer, Farewell My Concubine (theatrical release), The Thief and the Cobbler and Jet Li's Fist of Legend. Peter Biskind's book Down and Dirty Pictures details many of Weinstein's dishonest dealings with filmmakers. Under the Weinsteins, Miramax had a history of buying the rights to Asian films, only to sit on them without releasing them for some years. One example of this is Hero, a 2002 Chinese martial arts film. It languished in Miramax's vaults for two years before it was salvaged with the intervention of Quentin Tarantino. Another example is Tears of the Black Tiger, a Thai film originally released in 2000. After changing the ending of the film, Tears of the Black Tiger sat in Miramax's vaults for five years until its rights were purchased by Magnolia Pictures in 2006. A \\"no cuts\\" policy was highlighted when Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein demanded edits to the Japanese anime film Princess Mononoke to make it more marketable. In response, Toshio Suzuki, a producer at Studio Ghibli, sent an authentic katana with a simple message: \\"No cuts\\". According to promotion manager Steve Alpert, when Weinstein initially found out about this, he flew into a rage threatening Alpert that he would \\"never work in this... industry again\\". He eventually gave in, however, and the film was released uncut. One reason for the delays and non-releases of films was an accounting scheme that the Weinsteins used to shift potential money-losing films to future fiscal years and ensure they would receive annual bonuses from Disney, while trying to bar retailers from legally exporting authentic DVDs of the films. As a result of the Weinsteins' actions, a number of Asian producers who sold their distribution rights to the company refused to do so for their subsequent films. Defenders of the company point out that, prior to Miramax, most of the films purchased by the company would have had little to no chance of achieving U.S. distribution other than by very small distributors with minimal marketing expertise and funds. They also state that the purpose of the company's aggressive re-editing technique was always to try to help the films find a broader American audience than they might otherwise find. \\"I'm not cutting for fun\\", Harvey Weinstein said in an interview. \\"I'm cutting for the shit to work. All my life I served one master: the film. I love movies.\\". Miramax is also accused of ignoring their more artistic, less audience- friendly films, especially when directors refuse to re-cut them to make them less challenging. Dead Man, which director Jim Jarmusch refused to re-cut, got a very limited release and critics have accused the Weinsteins of burying the film. Miramax was parodied in the Kevin Smith film Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001), in which the studio attempted to adapt Jay and Silent Bob's comic book characters, Bluntman and Chronic, into a movie, thus resulting in the duo traveling to Hollywood to stop them from making the movie. According to Kevin Smith, this film is a direct response to the controversy surrounding his previous film Dogma. Walt Disney Television American Broadcasting Company On February 9, 1996, The Walt Disney Company acquired Capital Cities/ABC, and renamed the broadcasting group ABC, Inc., although the network also continues to use American Broadcasting Companies, such as on TV productions it owns. ABC's relationship with Disney dates back to 1953 when Leonard Goldenson pledged enough money so that the \\"Disneyland\\" theme park could be completed. ABC continued to hold Disney notes and stock until 1960, and also had first call on the \\"Disneyland\\" television series in 1954. With this new relationship came an attempt at cross-promotion, with attractions based on ABC, shows at Disney parks and an annual soap festival at Walt Disney World (the former president of ABC, Inc., Robert Iger, now heads Disney). In 1997, ABC aired a Saturday morning block called One Saturday Morning, which changed to ABC Kids in 2002. It featured a five-hour line-up of children's shows (mostly cartoons) for children ages 5–12, but it was changed to a four- hour line-up in 2005. Since then, it was aimed for children more in the age 10–16 range. Despite intense micro-managing on the part of Disney management, the flagship television network was slow to turn around. In 1999, the network was able to experience a brief bolster in ratings with the hit game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. A new national phenomenon, Survivor, on CBS persuaded the schedulers at ABC to change Millionaire's slot over to the Wednesday Time slot at 8:00 to kill Survivor before it got ratings to hold. The first results were promising for CBS; they lost by only a few rating points. ABC tried to keep the strength running, so they tried an unprecedented strategy for Millionaire by airing the show four times a week during the next Fall season, in the process overexposing the show, as it appeared on the network sometimes five or six nights during a week. ABC's ratings fell dramatically as competitors introduced their own game shows and the public grew tired of the format. Alex Wallau took over as president in 2000. Despite the repeated overexposure of Millionaire and its switch to syndication, ABC continued to find some success in dramas such as The Practice (which gave birth to a successful spinoff, Boston Legal, in 2004), Alias, and Once and Again. ABC also had some moderately successful comedies including The Drew Carey Show, Spin City, Dharma & Greg, According to Jim, My Wife and Kids and George Lopez. Still, one asset that ABC lacked in the early 2000s that most other networks had was popularity in reality television. ABC's briefly-lived reality shows Are You Hot? and I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! proved to be an embarrassment for the network. By the end of the 2003–2004 television season, ABC slumped to fourth place, becoming the first of the original \\"Big Three\\" networks to fall into such ratings. ABC Daytime *When Megan McTavish returned as head writer of All My Children in July 2003, she faced criticism for a story that depicted the rape of a lesbian character, Bianca Montgomery. The show also faced opposition to its story of a transgender character in 2006. *ABC Daytime scrapped a storyline on One Life to Live which was to depict a school shooting rampage on the day the Virginia Tech massacre occurred on April 17, 2007. *The Writers Guild of America East filed arbitration suits against ABC Daytime, claiming that they violated the strike- termination agreement by retaining replacement writers (those who choose Financial Core Status) who filled in during the strike on All My Children instead of bringing back the writers who had been on strike. *The ABC Network as a whole has been criticized for the cancellations of both One Life to Live and All My Children as well as the near-cancellation of its one remaining soap opera General Hospital. \\"The strike-termination agreement does not allow the retention of replacement writers in lieu of allowing striking writers to return to their jobs. ABC Daytime are clearly violating this agreement,\\" said Ira Cure, senior counsel for the WGA East, in a statement. \\"They have left us no other option but to file arbitrations to ensure that our members will be afforded their rights outlined under this agreement.\\" Broadcasting & Cable: Arbitration Suit Against ABC-D *In December 2008, Soap Opera Weekly/Soap Opera Digest critic Marlena De Lacroix called ABC Daytime a \\"chauvinistic hellhole\\". In August 2009, Frons announced that the production of All My Children would move from New York City to Los Angeles by the end of the year. ABC News On April 30, 2004, Nightline host Ted Koppel read the names of the members of the United States Armed Forces who were killed in Iraq. This prompted controversy from conservatives, who believed that Koppel was making a political statement, and from Sinclair Broadcasting Group, which felt that ABC was undermining the war effort in Iraq. Others, most notably The Washington Post television columnist, thought it was a ratings stunt for sweeps, and indeed Nightline was the highest-rated program during that time period, and had about 30% more viewers than other Nightline programs that week. Sinclair stations did not air the program. Koppel repeated the format on May 28, 2004, reading the names of service members killed in Afghanistan, and on May 30, 2005, reading the names of all service members killed in Afghanistan or Iraq between the last program and the preparation of the program. This time, Sinclair stations aired the program as scheduled. In the wake of the job cuts, a significant controversy erupted online in May 2010 after it was announced the former VP of news coverage, Mimi Gurbst, was leaving the network to become a guidance counselor. A story in the New York Observer reported that Gurbst was a \\"cherished\\" mentor inside the news division. Reporters who closely follow TV news observed that a large number of current and former ABC News staffers went online to vigorously respond that Gurbst had helped perpetuate a negative culture with ABC News. The Path to 9/11 ABC aired the controversial two-part miniseries The Path to 9/11 in the US on September 10, 2006, at 8 p.m. EDT and September 11, 2006, at 8 p.m. EDT. The extensive pre- broadcast controversy over the film has included disputes over the accuracy of its dramatization of key events, as well as calls by historians and from former Clinton and Bush administration officials for ABC to re-edit part of the film or not broadcast it at all. According to the official statement released by ABC on September 7, 2006, the film is a dramatization, not a documentary, drawn from a variety of sources, including The 9/11 Commission Report, other published materials, and from personal interviews. The main source of the controversy stems from portions of the film concerned with the Clinton administration in the 1990s. Critics say that certain dramatized scenes tend to suggest that blame for the events that took place on September 11, 2001, lies with Clinton and his cabinet. One example cited is a scene in which then-National Security Advisor Sandy Berger does not approve of the order to take out a surrounded Osama bin Laden, tells the squad in Afghanistan that they will have to do the job without official authorization and then hangs up the phone. According to Sandy Berger and others – including conservative author and Clinton critic Richard Miniter – this never happened. Screenwriter Cyrus Nowrasteh has now admitted that the abrupt hang-up was not in the script and was improvised. American Airlines reportedly threatened to pull its advertising from ABC after this program aired. The liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America named ABC its third annual \\"Misinformer of the Year\\" award in 2006, not only for the miniseries, but for the alleged conservative pandering of ABC News director Mark Halperin and for biased claims on news programs such as ABC World News and Good Morning America. Alexis Debat Alexis Debat, a consultant for ABC for years and also a writer for The National Interest, resigned from ABC in June 2007 after the broadcasting company discovered that he did not have a Ph.D. from the Sorbonne as he pretended.Howard Kurtz, Consultant Probed in Bogus Interview, The Washington Post, September 13, 2007 Furthermore, in September 2007, the French news media Rue 89 revealed that he had made at least two bogus interviews, one of Barack Obama and another of Alan Greenspan, both published in the French magazine Politique internationale.Pascal Riché, Une fausse interview d'Obama dans Politique internationale, Rue 89, September 5, 2007 Pascal Riché, Après la fausse interview d'Obama, celle de Greenspan, Rue 89, September 13, 2007 This in turn also led to his resignation from The National Interest. Debat had specialized in reports on terrorism and national security for the past six years (writing, for example, on the Jundallah Balochi and Sunni organization).Alexis Debat, Crackdown on the Secret War Against Iran, ABC News, April 13, 2007 ABC contract dispute affecting WABC-TV and WPVI On March 2, 2010, WABC-TV in New York, along with Philadelphia sister station WPVI (carried in Mercer, Monmouth, and Ocean counties), stated that they would pull their programming from Cablevision on March 7, 2010 (at midnight), unless a new payment structure was implemented for its network programming. Cablevision responded by citing WABC-TV and WPVI's free, over-the-air accessibility. Cablevision spokesman Charles Schueler stated, \\"It is not fair for ABC-Disney to hold Cablevision customers hostage by forcing them to pay what amounts to a new TV tax.\\" The removal of both stations occurred on the weekend of the 82nd Academy Awards, which was scheduled to be one of ABC's largest yearly specials, and was projected to cause a devastating blow to advertisers for the Oscars and to Cablevision itself. On Sunday, March 7, 2010 at 12:01 a.m. ET, both WABC and WPVI were removed from Cablevision, leaving a black screen in their place, confirming the rumors that if a deal with Cablevision and ABC was not reached by midnight, the network and other Disney- owned channels would go off the air. Cablevision began looping a public service announcement on each affected channel and forcing all of its customers' set-top boxes to channel 1999, which was looping the same announcement, much like was done when Scripps Networks pulled their cable channels' programming. Besides providing certain details of the disagreement they stated that ABC shows could be watched online through TV websites such as Hulu. Also that day, Cablevision announced through e-mail that their entire film catalog of on-demand movies would be available without charge until midnight that evening as an apology to their customers. At 8:50 p.m. that day, WABC and WPVI returned to Cablevision's programming, after notification during the 82nd Academy Awards announced progression in \\"Work to complete our negotiations\\", and the return of ABC's programming during the negotiations. Freeform Fox Family Worldwide Inc was sold to Disney for $2.9 billion on October 24, 2001. The sale to Disney also included TV channel Fox Kids and Saban Entertainment (renamed BVS Entertainment). The entire network was officially renamed ABC Family on November 10, 2001.July 23, 2001 Disney buying Fox Family Channel The sale to Disney was considered one of the largest mistakes or problems occurring during the tenure of Michael Eisner. The failure was primarily due to the acquisition being done by the strategic planning department of Disney, without consulting anyone at ABC. The original plan was to use the channel to essentially show re-runs of ABC programming, but this plan was completely impossible since ABC had no syndication rights to the majority of their own programs. During this time, the network did air same-season repeats of Alias, Less Than Perfect, Life with Bonnie, and The Bachelor, almost all of which were Touchstone Television productions (The Bachelor is distributed by Time Warner's Telepictures). But in trying to change the focus of the channel, Disney also canceled several Fox Family series, like State of Grace, and cut back on the network's TV movies, which were among the few programs Fox Family was doing well with. The ratings tumbled further as the network became dependent on syndicated reruns and no original programs (save for original wrap-around segments around Bachelor repeats, and children's programming). The next major plan was to reposition the channel to market it to college students, young women, or to a more hip audience under the name XYZ, a reverse reference to ABC. Disney soon found that the channel could never be renamed as such. The original sale from CBN to Fox/Saban contained a (now disputed) stipulation that the channel contains the word \\"Family\\" in the name forever, no matter who owns the network. To create XYZ, the Family Channel would have had to cease to exist — terminating all existing cable TV contracts — and XYZ would have to be created as a completely new network. Cable companies would not be obligated to put XYZ in the spot vacated by the Family Channel. ABC scrapped the idea after discovering this clause. The name was revisited at one point in 2003, serving as a program block entitled \\"The XYZ\\", showing programs and movies aimed at the above groups. The network was also used as a buffer to burn off failed ABC series, such as All American Girl, which featured former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell. Since 2006, the critics have gone after programming on ABC Family. Most critics of the network feel it has gone from a family friendly to \\"too risqué\\", and shows like Greek and The Secret Life of the American Teenager are far too racy for \\"family viewers\\". Critics feel that the executives at ABC Family are only after viewership numbers and are unconcerned about showing younger generations in questionable scenarios in series and films. The main focus of criticism is on teenage pregnancy or underage drinking. Despite the channel's name including the word \\"Family\\", the channel's programming content standards had changed several years earlier after the sale of the channel by International Family Entertainment, and the channel had been airing even some acquired series and movies that contain profanity, violence and sexual content or dialogue after the sale, particularly since being purchased by The Walt Disney Company. ABC Family did air parental advisory tags at the beginning of some TV-14 rated programs, such as That '70s Show and some episodes of The Secret Life of the American Teenager. In 2015, a survey revealed that viewers who only watched the channel occasionally thought that the channel was entirely family-friendly. As a result, the channel was rebranded as Freeform on January 12, 2016. This change was made in order to establish the network as a general entertainment channel. Despite this, family-oriented shows and movies continue to air on the network. Disney Channel Disney Channel has come under heavy criticism in recent years. Some critics disapprove of the marketing strategy made by Anne Sweeney, the former President of the Disney- ABC Television Group from 2004 to 2014 (1996-2014 as the President of Disney Channel), in which Disney Channel's programming has pulled away from the characters of Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy, that the company founded itself upon, and now mostly consists of programming geared mainly towards preteen and teenage girls. Longtime fans condemned the company for removing almost all Walt-era and pre-1990s material from the channel in 2002 with the removal of the late-night \\"Vault Disney\\" block devoted to this material, which used to make up the majority of the channel's programming since its inception in 1983. After Sweeney stepped down in 2014, Disney Channel's current president, Gary Marsh, has been directing the network to return to its roots from the 1990s and early 2000s, with programming such as the current iteration of Mickey Mouse shorts. ESPN Criticism of ESPN is mostly concerning the journalistic standards of the network vs. the entertainment division. One such event came in 2010 when ESPN gave one hour of time, and the advertising money that goes with it, to NBA superstar LeBron James so he could announce where he would play during the 2010-11 NBA season. This program was called The Decision and received criticism because ESPN ceded control of the hour to an outside source, and the person doing the interview was Jim Gray, who was not an ESPN employee. This is in addition to the hours of hype preceding the special which was in the form of a three-hour SportsCenter telecast. There was a Texas Tech scandal, which involved ESPN College Football analyst Craig James. Through James, ESPN used its power to get head coach Mike Leach fired because of how James's son, Adam, was treated following a concussion. ESPN has also been accused of overpaying for sports broadcasting rights, and that Wall Street analysts have raised concerns that this could be a major drain on Disney as a whole, since the amount of money that can be recuperated from retransmission consent fees and advertising is limited; Disney still profits from the ESPN division but as of 2015 was cutting the network's higher-priced content to ensure long-term profitability.Crum, Rex (June 29, 2015).

You want that relationship to be about trust in the journalist’s expertise.” Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Disneyland Resort Al Lutz's Disneyland reports Al Lutz, who has written about Disney since the 1990s, often writes about a perceived decline in value and quality at Disney's theme parks, chiefly Disneyland and the neighboring park that opened in 2001, Disney California Adventure Park.Dickerson, Marla: \\"Self-Styled Keepers of the Magic Kingdom\\", Los Angeles Times, September 12, 1996 Much of his criticism was directed at Paul Pressler, the one-time president of Disneyland who later was named chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, and Cynthia Harriss, Pressler's successor as Disneyland's president. From 1996-2002, Lutz maintained a set of sarcastic Web pages called Promote Paul Pressler!, whose stated goal was \\"getting current Disneyland Resort President Paul Pressler promoted to a new job somewhere else within The Walt Disney Company!\\" Lutz's July 2006 report on the alleged antics of Lindsay Lohan during a private party held at Disneyland for her 20th birthday drew a rebuke from a representative for the actress, who said that reports of bad behavior were \\"complete bull\\".\\"Lohan Slams Bad Birthday Behavior Reports\\", World Entertainment News Network, July 24, 2006 This report brought Lutz's website, MiceAge, briefly into the spotlight, and established Lutz as a Disney watchdog in the mainstream media. In late 2007, mainstream media outlets including The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, the Associated Press and foreign newspapers referenced claims made in two of Lutz's columns. One was about a planned refurbishment of the \\"it's a small world\\" attraction at Disneyland that would modify the ride's boat and flume trough to accommodate boats capable of carrying heavier park guests, a claim that Disney has consistently denied in subsequent media coverage.\\"Disney's 'Small World' ride set to get supersized retrofit\\", Associated Press, November 9, 2007 Disney California Adventure Park Disney California Adventure, originally named Disney's California Adventure Park until a name change in June 2010, was expected to draw large crowds when opened in 2001. A January 14, 2001 Los Angeles Times article titled \\"The most Jam-Packed Theme Park on Earth?\\" stated \\"Senior Disney officials acknowledge that there will be days when California Adventure will have to turn patrons away, particularly in the first weeks after the park opens, during spring break and again in the summer.\\" The actual attendance was not close to the size that Disney expected for the park back in 2001. The reasons for this has been speculated as: * Bad word-of-mouth from early visitors discouraged future visitors, stating the park was lacking in Disney- quality attractions. * Hollywood Pictures Backlot had lack of focus on the restaurants, shops and attractions. * Lack of rides for young children. * The park's Californian theme was criticized as being redundant, seeing as the park itself was located in the same state that it represented. Various tourist attractions and landmarks such as the Hollywood Sign and the beaches were located less than an hour away from the park. * Fans criticized the Paradise Pier area of the park because many of the attractions in this area were generic rides that guests do not expect to find at a Disney park. This was ironic, because Walt Disney originally created the neighboring Disneyland to provide a theme park experience unlike boardwalk piers and amusement parks of the era, and instead wanted to create a park where the entire family could enjoy themselves. * With an estimated price tag of $600 million, the park was criticized for being built \\"on the cheap\\", with a small number of attractions and minimal theming. * Many guests complained that a single day admission ticket to Disney's California Adventure cost the same as a single day admission ticket to Disneyland, yet contained fewer attractions, shows and entertainment. Disney's chief executive officer, Robert Iger, went on record during the company's annual stockholder meeting on March 10, 2006, when someone asked about a potential third park being built in Anaheim. \\"We're still working to assure the second gate is successful\\", Iger said, referring to California Adventure. \\"In the spirit of candor, we have been challenged.\\" On October 17, 2007, The Walt Disney Company announced a multi-year, $1.1 billion expansion plan for Disney's California Adventure Park. Plans for the renovation and expansion were put on display for park visitors inside the Blue Sky Cellar at the Golden Vine Winery. Disney listened to the public and several of the attractions which drew criticism from the public will be removed in the multi-year, multibillion-dollar redesign and expansion of Disney's California Adventure. Other rides will be redesigned or replaced with a larger focus on Disney characters and stories. On May 28, 2010, it was announced through the Disney Parks Blog that the park would also be receiving a slight name change, to Disney California Adventure, as well as a new logo. The new name took effect on June 11, 2010, appearing on park maps and banners, but it was first used in a commercial promoting Disney's World of Color a few days prior. World of Color premiered on June 11, 2010, as part of Disney's Summer Nighttastic. Walt Disney World Resort Disney's Animal Kingdom Even in the planning stages, various Florida based animal rights groups and PETA did not like the idea of Disney creating a theme park where animals were held in captivity. The groups protested, and PETA tried to convince travel agents not to book trips to the park. A few weeks before the park opened, a number of animals died due to accidents. The United States Department of Agriculture viewed most of the cases and found no violations of animal-welfare regulations. On opening day, the Orange County Sheriff's office sent about 150 deputies in fear that there may be a large protest, but only 24 protesters showed up. The protest lasted two hours, and there were no arrests. One year after the park opened, The Animal Rights Foundation of Florida complained that a New Year's Eve fireworks show could upset the animals. A USDA inspector came to the park to find no problems with launching low-noise fireworks half a mile away. Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex A former baseball umpire and an architect alleged that they approached The Walt Disney Company in 1987 with plans for a sports complex and that Wide World of Sports, which opened 10 years later, was heavily based on their designs. Disney claimed that, while the designs had some similarities, the complex was also similar to numerous other sporting facilities, and the concept of a sports park was too generic for any one group to claim ownership. The two men, represented in part by noted attorney Johnnie Cochran, sued Disney in Orange County civil court. In August 2000, a jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs with damages in the amount of $240 million, a fraction of the $1.5 billion sought. Disney appealed the judgment, and settled out of court in September 2002 for undisclosed terms. Walt Disney World College Program The Walt Disney World College Program is a U.S. national internship program operated by The Walt Disney Company, located at the Walt Disney World Resort. The Walt Disney World College Program recruits students (18 years and older) and all majors for a semester-long paid internship program working at the Walt Disney World Resort. Critics argue that Disney is using the program as a source of cheap labor, as interns do the same work as veteran employees, but at a significantly lower pay rate. In late 2007, a permanent Cast Member ran for president of the local union in Orlando. Part of his platform intended to get rid of the Disney College Program, claiming that the program \\"imports thousands of low-wage earners every year to work for Disney, depressing the local employment market and keeping wages down.\\" Disney responded that the program is beneficial in the recruitment of cast members and that 8,000 workers out of 62,000 do not greatly impact operations. It has been criticized also for its lack of union representation and denial of insurance benefits by the company. Reedy Creek Improvement District The Reedy Creek Improvement District is the immediate governing jurisdiction for the land of the Walt Disney World Resort. When initially planning the resort back in the 1960s, Walt Disney felt that it would be easier to carry out his proposals with more flexibility and independence with his own specialized, personalized government. Among his ideas for his Florida project was his \\"Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow\\", which was to be a real planned city that would have also been used as a test bed for new innovations for city living. After extensive lobbying, the Government of Florida passed legislation establishing this special government district. The District essentially gives the Disney Company the standard powers and autonomy of an incorporated city. After Disney died in 1966 before his vision was realized, the Disney Company board decided that it did not want to be in the business of running a city. Most of Walt's ideas for his planned city were eventually abandoned, and thus the residential areas were never built, causing some to cry foul. Most notably, Richard Foglesong argues in his book Married to the Mouse: Walt Disney World and Orlando that Disney has abused its powers by remaining in complete control of the District, and using its autonomy solely for commercial interests inside its self-contained resort instead of maintaining an actual city. And although Disney built an actual community, Celebration, Florida, on their property in the 1990s, it was later de-annexed from the District and the company's control. Disneyland Paris In May 1992, entertainment magazine The Hollywood Reporter reported that about 25% of Euro Disney's workforce — approximately 3,000 men and women — had resigned their jobs due to unacceptable working conditions. It also reported that the park's attendance was far behind expectations. Euro Disney S.C.A., the company that operates Disneyland Paris, responded in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, in which the company's president, Robert Fitzpatrick, claimed that only 1,000 people had left their jobs. In response to the financial situation, Fitzpatrick ordered that the Disney-MGM Studios Europe project would be put on hiatus until a further decision could be made. Prices at the resort's hotels were also reduced significantly. Despite these efforts, in May 1992 daily park attendance was around 25,000 (some reports give a figure of 30,000) instead of the predicted 60,000. Euro Disney's stock price spiraled downwards and on July 23, 1992, the Resort announced an expected net loss in its first year of operation of approximately 300 million French francs. During Euro Disney's first winter, hotel occupancy was such that it was decided to close Disney's Newport Bay Club hotel for the season. Initial hopes were that each visitor would spend around US$33 per day, but near the end of 1992, analysts reckoned spending to be around 12% lower. Efforts to improve attendance included serving alcoholic beverages with meals inside the Euro Disneyland theme park, in response to a presumed European demand, which began June 12, 1993. In January 1994, Sanford Litvack, an attorney from New York City and former Assistant Attorney General during the Jimmy Carter presidency, was assigned to be Disney's lead negotiator regarding Euro Disney's future. On February 28, Litvack made an offer (without the consent of Eisner or Frank Wells) to split the debts between Euro Disney creditors and Disney. After the banks showed interest, Litvack informed Eisner and Wells. On March 14, the day before the annual shareholders meeting, the banks capitulated to Disney's demands. The creditor banks bought US$500 million worth of Euro Disney shares, forgave 18 months of interest and deferred interest payments for three years. The Walt Disney Company invested US$750 million into Euro Disney and granted a five- year suspension of royalty payments. In June that same year, Saudi Arabian Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud cut a deal whereby The Walt Disney Company bought 51% of a new US$1.1 billion share issue, the rest being offered to existing shareholders at below-market rates, with the Prince buying any that were not taken up by existing shareholders (up to a 24.5% holding). Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal was alleged to be a financier of Al Qaeda by The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, also known as the 9/11 Commission. Walt Disney Studios Park, which was built in a desperate and rushed attempt to increase the resort's attendance, was also criticized for its lackluster theming, lack of quality attractions and bland environment since its opening. It was also Disney's smallest and least attended theme park. Efforts made to improve the park included the addition of several new attractions, a new themed land Toy Story Playland and re-theming of other areas. One of the new attractions, Crush's Coaster, was also criticized for its long lines and wait times reaching up to two hours even on non-crowded days due to its popularity, despite being not capable of handling riders at a fast rate. About one hour before the official opening time of the park, guests were able to enter the park to wait in line for the ride, which had not been done before in any other Disney ride. Attempts to apply a Fastpass line in the ride have been proved to be more inefficient. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort Overcrowding problems Just before the grand opening, the park was criticized for underestimating the daily capacity limit. The problem became apparent on the charity preview day on September 4, 2005, when 30,000 locals visited the park. This event turned out to be a disaster, because there were too many guests for the park to accommodate. Wait times at fast food outlets were at least 45 minutes in length, and wait times at rides were two hours in length. Although the community, and the park's biggest shareholder, the Hong Kong government, put pressure on the park to lower the capacity, the park insisted on keeping the limit and only agreed to relieve the capacity problem by extending the opening time by one hour or introducing more discounts during weekdays. However, the park said that local visitors tend to stay in the park for about nine hours per visit, implying that the mentioned practices would do little to solve the problem. During the Chinese New Year 2006, many visitors arrived at the park in the morning bearing valid tickets but were refused entry, because the park was already at capacity. Disgruntled visitors attempted to force their way into the park or gain access by climbing over the barrier gates. Disneyland management was forced to revise their ticketing policy and designated future periods close to Chinese public holidays as 'special days' during which admission would only be allowed through a date-specific ticket. Food safety panel Officers from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, who were asked by Disney staff to take off their badges and caps in order to enter the park, left park visitors feeling very uneasy. The officers investigated a food-poisoning case in the park's restaurants. The chairman of Legco's food Safety panel, Fred Li, described the incident as shocking and called on the director of the department to take follow-up action against Disney. Hong Kong Disneyland says that what happened was inappropriate and has apologized for the incident. The Secretary for Justice has since said that the government did not have enough evidence to make a prosecution, thus dropping the case. Fingerprinting As at other Disney theme parks, visitors to Hong Kong Disneyland have their finger biometrics scanned at the entry gate. Visitors are not warned of the policy beforehand. Scanning is done of all visitors older than 10 years of age, and is used to associate ticket media with the person using it. The company claims that \\"the 50 sample points from the surface of a guest's finger ... do not contain sufficient information to recreate a fingerprint image.\\" Nonetheless, forensic specialists note that the data collected are more than adequate to establish a positive identification. Shark fin soup controversy Disney originally planned to serve shark fin soup, a traditional Chinese delicacy, at wedding banquets.Yung, Chester. \\"End this 'barbaric and cruel waste'\\" , The Standard, May 31, 2005. Accessed May 5, 2007. Animal rights groups protested in June 2005, citing the declining shark population in global waters and the cruel methods sometimes used of cutting the fin and discarding live sharks back into the sea. At first, Disney removed shark fin soup from its menu, but said that it would still offer the soup if their clients insisted on having it served at their wedding. They said they would distribute leaflets about shark conservation in order to discourage the choice.Hui, Sylvia. \\"Disney takes shark's fin off menu \\" , The Standard, June 10, 2005.

Accessed May 5, 2007. shareholders concerned about the company's image, Disney announced on June 24, 2005 that shark fin soup will not be served at all, because, according to their press release, \\"After careful consideration and a thorough review process, we were not able to identify an environmentally sustainable fishing source, leaving us no alternative except to remove shark fin soup from our wedding banquet menu\\".Under-fire Disney takes shark's fin off menu at Hong Kong park , Monster and Critics, June 24, 2005.

Accessed May 5, 2007. *The official size of the entire development as released by the government was 1.26 km2. Furthermore, the size of the first phase was reported to be only 700,000 m2. However, the area of just the Disneyland theme park portion, is estimated to be between 152,100 and 187,200 m2. If it accommodates a maximum capacity of 34 000 visitors, the area per visitor would be 2.5 m2 . The commercial area is divided into: ** Theme Park: 325,700 m2 ** Hotels: 165,300 m2 ** Parking and Transit Hub: 171,900 m2 ** Inspiration Lake 300,000 m2 Disney's PhotoPass Disney's PhotoPass is a professional photography service offered at Disney theme parks, water parks, and resorts. Photographers positioned at locations in the theme parks, dining events at the resorts, and at the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique at Downtown Disney are linked to a free card containing a unique serial number. Guests can view or purchase PhotoPass pictures at locations in the parks (generally near the park entrance) or online by registering the card's number. Customers have complained about the difference in advertised prices, particularly of Photo CD products, and the actual cost. Disney has responded that advertised specials apply only to products purchased at the parks and do not apply to the website. Disney Consumer Products Disney Princess On December 24, 2006, Peggy Orenstein published, \\"What’s Wrong With Cinderella?\\" in The New York Times. In her article, Orenstein discussed her concerns about the effects of princess figures on young girls. Orenstein used the Disney Princesses specifically to present many of her points. Orenstein also noted the pervasive nature of princess-related merchandise and that every facet of play has its princess equivalent. Other sources have also voiced concern that the franchise could possibly give young girls the wrong message. However, other parents who have young daughters say that they would eventually grow out of this phase. Marvel Comics Page 16 of Captain America #602 (March 2010) depicted an anti-tax protest march in Idaho in which one participant held a sign reading \\"Tea Bag the Libs Before They Tea Bag You\\", with a caption containing the words of an off-screen African-American superhero, the Falcon, telling Captain America, \\"I don't exactly see a black man from Harlem fitting in with a bunch of angry white folks.\\"Captain America #602 (March 2010). Writer Ed Brubaker, penciler Luke Ross, colorist Dean White, letterer Joe Caramagna, editor Tom Brevoort, editor-in-chief Joe Quesada The cartoon drew the condemnation of Michael Johns, a board member of the Nationwide Tea Party Coalition. Marvel Comics Editor-in-Chief Joe Quesada characterized the sign as inadvertent and as \\"something that we need to apologize for and own up to....\\" Quesada explained that with a printing deadline looming, the comic's editor noticed that the protest group's signs on the original art were empty, and the editor \\"asked the letterer on the book to just fudge in some quick signs. The letterer in his rush ... looked on the 'net and started pulling slogans from actual signs\\", including a \\"Tea Bag\\" sign. Following the printing of the issue, Marvel staff \\"caught the mistake\\" and \\"spoke to the letterer, [who] was mortified at his mistake and was truly sorry as he had no political agenda.\\" Quesada said Marvel \\"removed the sign from the art files so that it no longer appears in future reprints of the title or collections. So, while the crowd protesting has nothing to do with the villains in the story, we in no way meant to say they were associated with the Tea Party movement....\\" Acquisition of Marvel Entertainment On August 31, 2009, Disney announced that it would acquire Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion. This led to significant backlash from Marvel fans, fearing Marvel would lose its individuality through Disneyfication. Disney has stated that the acquisition will neither affect any of Marvel's products in any way nor will the nature of any Marvel characters or products be transformed. The acquisition was completed on December 31, 2009. Transition of ownership regarding Star Wars On December 21, 2012, Disney acquired Lucasfilm (and, as a result, the rights to the Star Wars franchise, Skywalker Sound and Industrial Light and Magic) as a subsidiary for the price of $4 billion. Lucasfilm and Star Wars in general were evaluated to decide upon how each area was to be approached. After Dark Horse Comics lost the rights to create Star Wars comics, Marvel Comics gained the rights as a subsidiary in the area of expertise. The way the movies are being handled is still in flux with possible spin-offs in talks as well as the planned new trilogy. The decisions regarding the other sectors like games, books and animated media can be interpreted as anti-consumer. With the elimination of the LucasArts developing arm, EA Games is being entrusted to make Star Wars video games in the future. The well-regarded animated TV series Star Wars: The Clone Wars was cancelled a few seasons from the end of its run, in order to shift the series' team to Star Wars Rebels, a new animated TV series created for Disney XD, set approximately five years before the events of Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope. This was done in the knowledge that many people loved the series and that it was quite profitable. Furthermore, book consumers were not given the option of two universes to read from, the first of which is what many of them have been reading about for over 40 years and have grown to love and the second of which is Disney's attempt to unify things under one controllable banner; as a result, this left fans of these books to only read new entries in the Unified Canon, and if they wish to see the continued growth of the Star Wars universe, the previous universe is now stuck in limbo. On June 20, 2017, Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the directors of the film Solo: A Star Wars Story, left the production of the film five weeks before filming ended. Lord and Miller cited \\"creative differences\\" for their reason to part ways with the film. Many compared this to Edgar Wright stepping down as director of Ant-Man due to creative differences with Marvel Studios. Three months later, Episode IX director Colin Trevorrow stepped down as director under similar circumstances and was replaced with Star Wars: The Force Awakens director J.J. Abrams.  Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney On December 14, 2017, Disney agreed to acquire 21st Century Fox's motion picture business, cable and direct satellite entertainment networks, that was completed on March 20, 2019. Under the terms of the agreement, Disney acquired the 20th Century Fox film and TV studios and related assets; cable and satellite networks including FX Networks, Fox Networks Group; Indian TV broadcasting company Star India; stakes in National Geographic Partners and Hulu, and other assets. Prior to the completion of the deal, Fox spun-off its news and broadcast businesses, including Fox News, Fox Business, FS1, FS2, Fox Deportes, and the Big Ten Network, the Fox Broadcasting Company, and MyNetworkTV into the newly-formed Fox Corporation. This merger was subject to widespread criticism among critics, consumers, and businesses due to antitrust concerns. One of the biggest concerns is that unlike Disney's acquisition of Pixar, Marvel Entertainment, and Lucasfilm, the Disney/Fox deal was a horizontal integration (in which a company owns a direct competitor) in contrast to a vertical integration (in which two companies operate different stages for a specific finished product) like the mergers of AT&T-Time; Warner and Comcast-NBCUniversal. Given Disney's already powerful box market shares, a combined Disney/Fox would give it a 39% theatrical market share and would strengthen Disney's already leveraging power over theater owners in its favor without regard to the negative effects on their businesses. South Park controversy The Jonas Brothers and the Disney Channel are parodied in the South Park episode entitled \\"The Ring\\" and play a prominent role in the episode's plot. In a television column written before \\"The Ring\\" aired, Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post suggested that creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone were using the Jonas Brothers in the 13th season debut as a means of improving the show's ratings; Comedy Central executives, however, insisted that the Jonas Brothers fans do not fit into South Park's demographic of males aged from 18 to 49. The Walt Disney Company, the Disney Channel and the Mickey Mouse cartoon character are also prominently featured, and spoofed, in the episode; even when Mickey Mouse says callous things or physically assaults people, he follows up most statements with the character's trademark high-pitched \\"Ha ha!\\" laugh, which in context comes off like a nervous tic. Reviewers and commentators have described \\"The Ring\\" as not just a parody of the Jonas Brothers, but also of the ethos of The Walt Disney Company. The episode portrays Disney as a corporation using the ruse of family-friendly morals to disguise their primary motive, which is profit; reviewers and articles said this point is further illustrated by the use of Mickey Mouse, a cartoon symbol for the wholesome Disney image, as a foul- mouthed, contemptuous, greedy, all-powerful and violent character. Specifically, the episode targets Disney's marketing tactic of the band members pledging abstinence through purity rings, which the script suggests is used to subliminally sell sex to young girls, while simultaneously appeasing the ethical standards of their parents and taking advantage of their fearful desire to protect their daughters, as Mickey had said. Due to other speculation on the orientation and personal activities of the Jonas brothers, the episode continued to create a running gag on the effect of the Jonas brothers on young girls of the \\"tween\\" period, often provoking the image that they, too, would become like Mickey Mouse, in most unwanted characteristics. The episode further illustrates the greed of corporate culture by portraying Mickey as capitalizing on religion for profit, while secretly mocking it in a particularly cruel tone: \\"Even the Christians are too fucking stupid to figure out I'm selling sex to their daughters! I've made billions off of Christian ignorance for decades now! And do you know why? Because Christians are retarded! They believe in a talking dead guy!\\" Collusion to replace employees with H-1B holders In January 2016, lawsuits were filed against Disney, HCL Technologies and Cognizant alleging the companies colluded to bring in holders of H-1B visas to replace American workers thereby breaking the law. The lawsuits were filed by two former employees who filed a separate but similar complaint both seeking class-action status. This is the first lawsuit filed against both the former employer and the outsourcing companies, alleging that the companies involved collaborated intentionally to displace Americans and replace them with foreign workers. In October 2016, federal Judge Gregory A. Presnell of the United States District Court in Orlando dismissed the lawsuits, stating: \\"none of the allegedly false statements put at issue in the complaint are adequate\\". Copyright extension Since 1990, The Walt Disney Company has lobbied for copyright extension. The Copyright Term Extension Act delayed the entry into the public domain of the earliest Mickey Mouse movies, leading detractors to nickname it \\"The Mickey Mouse Protection Act\\". Opponents of the legislation consider it to be corporate welfare and have tried (but failed) to have it declared unconstitutional, claiming that such an act is not \\"necessary and proper\\" to accomplishing the Constitution's stated purpose of \\"promot[ing] the progress of science and useful arts\\". They argue that most works bring most of the profits during the first few years and are pushed off the market by the publishers thereafter. Thus there is a little economic incentive in extending the terms of copyrights except for the few owners of franchises that are wildly successful, such as Disney.  Miscellaneous criticisms and complaints  *In August 2014, Disney and Disney English were sued in an American court for subjecting workers, young children and infants to highly polluted air in classrooms, resulting in illness. Disney chose to settle out of court. *Religious welfare groups, such as the Catholic League, have spoken out against the release of material which they and others found offensive, including vehement protests of the Miramax Films features Priest (1994) and Dogma (1999). Disney pushed back the release date for Dogma due to the controversy surrounding the movie, and eventually sold the distribution rights to Lions Gate Films. The ABC show Nothing Sacred, about a Jesuit priest, a book called Growing Up Gay (published by Disney-owned Hyperion Press), the (unofficial) annual Gay and Lesbian Days at Disney theme parks, and similar issues spurred boycotts of Disney and its advertisers by the Catholic League, the Assemblies of God, and other conservative Christian groups. *The Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) and the American Family Association voted to boycott Disney over opposition to Disney offering domestic partnership benefits to gay employees and over opposition to the ABC show Ellen, in which the show's star, Ellen DeGeneres, came out as lesbian; Both boycotts were withdrawn in 2005. *The company has been accused of human rights violations regarding the working conditions in factories that produce their merchandise. It has been criticized also by animal welfare groups, for their care of and procedures for wild animals at Disney's Animal Kingdom theme park, and for using purebred dogs in movies such as 101 Dalmatians. Animal rights groups claim movies with purebreds create an artificial demand for purebreds from people who may not be prepared or temperamentally suited for the animals, many of whom end up abandoned or surrendered to animal shelters or rescue groups. *An environmental management plan for a zone of Great Guana Cay, in the Abaco Islands, criticized Disney for poor management of a tract of the island. Disney partially developed but then abandoned the place, which was to have been a cruise ship resort called Treasure Island. The report, by the University of Miami and the College of the Bahamas, blames Disney for leaving hazardous materials, electrical transformers, and fuel tanks, and also for introducing invasive alien plants and insects that threaten the natural flora and fauna of the island. *Disney Publishing Worldwide supported the widely criticized Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA).

The results were astonishing! Our Summer School inspired the children through group activities, celebrations, Bible Study and prayer. Those six days proved to be a real blessing. Over the course of the Summer School, the children talked, perhaps for the first time, about their sense of loss - of home, of family members, their school friends, even toys and other possessions.

We are passionate about equipping communities and individuals to recognise the world- changing power of a living faith. Our videos demonstrate an authentic and relevant Christianity that celebrates diversity and provides an answer to extremism and hatred.\\" * The Awareness Forum, which consists of special events such as dinners, conferences, roundtable exchanges and lectures, focusing on religious and cultural issues of the day. For example, in 2018, an international conference was held in London . * Facing Faith, another programme. This programme is described by the Foundation as \\"A community-based initiative to promote peace and understanding across barriers of faith & culture\\"; it works by \\"bringing together community and faith leaders from different religions and cultures to discuss ideas and share their thoughts on how to promote better understanding and respect among the diverse communities that live alongside each other in cities and towns around Great Britain. Each event helps faith and community leaders to enable local communities to decide upon effective joint activities and programmes for the future.\\" The Awareness Foundation is ecumenical, with board members from the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of England, the Episcopal Church in the US and the Middle East, the Greek Orthodox Church, Presbyterian, Methodist and Baptist Churches, plus several charismatic evangelical churches. Personnel Nadim Nassar is Executive Director. He is co-founder of the Awareness Foundation along with Michael Marshall (President Emeritus of the Awareness Foundation).

They have been identified in different contexts as Hurrians, Elamites, Medes, Cimmerians, and Scythians. The homeland of Umman Manda seems to be somewhere from Central Anatolia to north or northeastern Babylonia in what later came to be known as Mitanni, Mannae and Media, respectively. Zaluti, whose name seems to have an Indo-Iranian etymology, is mentioned as a leader of Ummanda Manda. He is even suggested to be identified with Salitis the founder of the Hyksos, the Fifteenth dynasty of Egypt. The principal literary source is the so-called Cuthaean Legend of Naram-Sin, a composition that deals with the third-millennium BC king of Agade (Akkad) Naram-Sin and his struggles against the Umman-manda. As a literary topos, the Umman-manda represent a socio-cultural phenomenon with a strong theological basis: The Umman-manda are created by the gods and called forth from their homeland on the northeastern frontier of Mesopotamia by the chief god, be it Enlil, Marduk, or Aššur, for some particular work of destruction; since this destruction is divinely ordained, human beings are powerless to stop it, and in fact are enjoined against interfering; when the destruction is completed, the gods themselves will destroy the Umman-manda. In the literary topos, the Umman-manda is the enemy of civilization. The question of who the original Umman-manda were remains a mystery. The Cyrus Cylinder however, states that the Umman-manda were subdued by Cyrus the Great, and therefore made part of the Achaemenid Empire just before he captured Babylon in 539 BC. According to the Cyrus Cylinder: \\"Cyrus, king of Anšan [...] made the land of Gutium and all the Umman-manda bow in submission at his feet.\\" In the first millennium BC, the term denoted Cimmerians and/or Medes.

The museum has four different exhibitions at any given time in which different photographic genres are shown, such as documentary, art and fashion. Next to large exhibitions by well-known photographers, Foam also shows the work of young and upcoming photographers, in shorter running exhibitions. Two notable shows were Henri Cartier-Bresson - A Retrospective, work by Henri Cartier-Bresson, and Richard Avedon - Photographs 1946 -2004, a major retrospective of Richard Avedon. In summer 2016 Foam presented a major Helmut Newton retrospective exhibition. The museum contains a café, a library, a commercial gallery called FoamEditions and a bookshop. The museum also publishes a quarterly photography magazine called Foam Magazine.  Building  Design of Museum Fodor The building on the Keizersgracht canal in which Foam is located has a history dating back to Carel Joseph Fodor (1801–1860). Fodor first bought Keizersgracht 611, and later also bought the adjacent warehouse and residential house at Keizersgracht 609. Fodor destined the warehouse in his testament as the exhibition space that should receive the name Museum Fodor. Between 1863 and 1994, Museum Fodor was open to the public. Between 1994 and 2001 the Nederlands Vormgevingsinstituut was located in these buildings. History Foam received permission in November 2001 from the city council for the start- up. On December 13, 2001, Foam opened its first exhibition Dutch Delight. More than 7000 people visited the exhibition in which Dutch light played a prominent or self-evident role. After the opening exhibition the museum closed for renovation. Architects BenthemCrouwel turned three buildings at the Keizersgracht into a modern museum. The first exhibition in the new museum, was called Regie: Paul Huf, Paul Huf together with Eva Besnyö being the originator of the museum. The official opening took place on June 6, 2002. The exhibition was visited by approximately 8000 people. Exhibition policy Every year Foam organises four large exhibitions by particularly notable photographers, usually running for about three months. In conjunction about 16 shorter running exhibitions are organised by the museum, which can be very different in character: either the work of relatively young photographers, or a specific project, work that is currently relevant, small retrospectives or the presentation of new developments within the medium. Emphasis is generally on documentary photography, street photography, portrait and glamour photography, and young and upcoming talents. Documentary photography exhibitions at Foam have included Avenue Patrice Lumumba by Guy Tillim, The Hyena & Other Men by Pieter Hugo, In the Shadow of Things by Leonie Purchas, and Calais - From Jungle to City by Henk Wildschut. Street photography exhibitions have included Helen Levitt's In the Street, a retrospective by Weegee and Tom Wood’s Photieman. Portrait or glamour exhibitions have included Photographs 1946-2004 by Richard Avedon, Chemises by Malick Sidibé, and People of the 20th Century by August Sander.

Jim Webb SJ, Fr. Tom McKillop, Fr. Bud Smith SFM, Sr. Margaret Ordway IBVM, and Jim Morin who proposed a collective organizational model which began with twelve people. The Catholic New Times was incorporated by letters patent in the Province of Ontario on December 13, 1976, with the objective of promoting the advancement of religion in Canada. For over 30 years, its editors, writers and supporters included many Canadian Catholics interested in social justice. Its editors included Mary Jo Leddy, Janet Somerville, Sr. Frances Ryan OSU, Sr. Anne O'Brien CSIC, Maura Hanrahan, Ted Schmidt and Diane Bisson.\\"Catholic New Times ceases publication\\".

History Catholic New Times was considered a non-profit corporation and was registered as a charitable organization in 1977. The newspaper had no mandate or financial support from any particular diocese or Catholic institution but sought to act as an alternative and independent Catholic voice in Canada. The newspaper focused on local, national and international news and issues of concern to Catholics. The newspaper was published bi-weekly in Toronto from December 2, 1976 until November 26, 2006, when the newspaper had to close as a result of declining financial support. Organizational structure Catholic New Times Inc. initially operated using a \\" collective model \\" that consisted of three main groupings: office staff who ran the paper, a working group (\\"the Collective\\") that met bi-weekly to plan issues and set editorial and general policy, and the editorial group (which included staff) that met weekly to generate stories and determine the details of each issue. By September 1982, committees composed of collective members, staff, and volunteers had emerged to handle particular needs: promotion, finance, personnel, and editorial. In 1989 to 1990, the corporation underwent a structural reorganization to form a Membership Group of 25-30 people who then elected a Publishing Group of about 10 people from among themselves. The Membership Group met twice a year, with the business conducted at the fall meeting; the Publishing Group, which also acted as the Board of Directors, met with the editor 10 times per year. Members also sat on one of four committees (Editorial, Finance, Human resources, and Marketing) that met according to its specific needs. Archive The last editor of the Catholic New Times was Diane Bisson. Bisson donated the records of the magazine to the John M. Kelly Library at the University of St. Michael's College at the University of Toronto in 2007. The Catholic New Times Inc. fonds consists of minutes, reports, proposals and other materials prepared for meetings of committees and groups within Catholic New Times from 1976-2006. Fonds also includes incoming and outgoing correspondence from 1975-1983; documents relating to the incorporation of the Catholic New Times in 1976 and subsequent changes in directors; materials documenting the mission and structure of the corporation and processes and procedures for producing the newspaper; subject files containing clippings and reports from organizations of interest to Catholic New Times members and staff; and audio-visual materials created by and for the Catholic New Times.

Retrieved 27 August 2012 hosted by Jeremy Corbett and created by thedownlowconcept. Paul Ego and Dai Henwood usually appear on each episode, along with other comedians, who form teams and answer questions about stories from the last week. Show format At the start of each show, Jeremy Corbett announces a content warning, saying \\"the following show is for adults only and contains bad language that may offend some people\\". This is often followed by an opening joke based on an event in the past seven days. On some occasions, the content warning became the joke – including being said in a parody of Downfall (following several Auckland schoolboys saluting the Nazi flag), being missed out completely (while the Prime Minister was out of the country), and being texted while driving (two days before the ban on use of mobile phones while driving came into force). While the show is normally screened at 9:30pm and originally 10pm, the episode on 21 October 2011 was screened at the earlier time of 7:30pm and as a result was a PGR rated show. The opening segment mentioned the show was PGR and then replaced a few swear words with cleaner equivalents such as fudge. The show was moved to the earlier time to coincide with the screening of the Rugby World Cup 2011 Bronze Final. After the title card, Corbett introduces the leaders of each team, normally Paul Ego for Team 1 and Dai Henwood for Team 2, although one episode featured an all-Australian team replacing Dai Henwood's team. After the leader of each team is introduced, the leader introduces the rest of their team. Regular team members include Ben Hurley, Josh Thomson, Steve Wrigley, Jeremy Elwood, Urzila Carlson, Jesse Griffin, Madeleine Sami, Michele A'Court and Justine Smith. Special guest comedians appear on some episodes. There are usually 5-7 games in each show, with \\"What's the Story\\" always being the first, and \\"Caption That\\" usually being last. After the teams guess the story, Corbett confirms the actual story before adding a joke of his own. In early episodes, Corbett also intervened if the joke made was in bad taste, or he became the butt of the joke, yelling \\"get out\\" and making the contestant pretend to leave. Teams are allocated \\"points\\" at the end of the round based on numbers in the news. In earlier episodes, Corbett randomly allocated point to the teams based on their performance. The team winning the most rounds wins the episode, but this is not always the case. An MVP was awarded in earlier episodes which was later removed. One of the panellists thanks New Zealand on Air to close the show. Games Charles Chauvel on 7 Days filming \\"Yes Minister\\" in July 2010. Games played include: ;What's the Story? :News footage, usually from 3 News but occasionally from ONE News, with the sound removed is played while team members make humorous comments and then try and work out what the story is about. ;Caption That :A caption contest: a news photograph is shown and the teams are required to invent their own (usually humorous) captions for it. ;My Kid Could Draw That :A primary school child explains a picture he/she has drawn about a recent news story, and the teams must work out what it is before the kid tells them what it is. ;Answers :Teams are given an answer related to a news event in the last 7 days and are required to work out what the question is, in the style of the American quiz Jeopardy!.\\"'Jeopardy!' 10 Most Memorable Moments\\", About.com. Retrieved 27 August 2012 ;History :A video clip of a New Zealand historical event is played, and a person shown in the clip is then brought into the studio together with three look-alikes. The teams are required to guess which one is the person in the video. This is based on a segment in the British pop music quiz Never Mind the Buzzcocks.\\"The Cheeky Girls Line Up - Never Mind the Buzzcocks - BBC Two\\" YouTube/BBC. Retrieved 27 August 2012 The segment was once played with when teams had to guess which one of the group of four was a Lawson quintuplet (New Zealand's only living set of quintuplets), not realising that the four people were four of the five quintuplets. ;Community News : A newspaper headline is given, but with missing words, and the teams are required to work out the missing words. This is based on a round from the UK news quiz Have I Got News for You.Have I Got News For You - the TV Series, BBC h2g2. Retrieved 27 August 2012 ;Slice of Seven : A musician comes on to the show and sings a song about a news story and the teams have to try guess the story. The name of the segment references the 1986 Dave Dobbyn single Slice of Heaven. ;Yes Minister :A political figure (usually an MP, but mayors are also common) makes an appearance, and the teams ask them closed-ended questions which the guest must answer without saying \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" (or saying or gesturing similar). The team who makes the \\"minister\\" say 'yes' or 'no' wins. The segment's concept originated in the \\"Yes-No Interlude\\" in the game show Take Your Pick,\\"Take Your Pick\\", UKGameshows.com. Retrieved 27 August 2012 and its name is a reference to the 1980s British sitcom Yes Minister. ;Quote Me :A photo of a person and an acronym of a quote that person said during the last 7 days are given to each team, and they must come up with the correct full quote. This is based on a round from Mock the Week. ;My Professional Opinion :A video clip is played with people with the same occupation (e.g. butchers, lifeguards etc.), sharing their opinion to a news story from the last 7 days but don't say what the story actually is. The teams must guess what they are talking about. After both teams have guessed another video clip is played with the people telling them \\"that was my professional opinion, on the (news story)\\". This game replaced a similar earlier game called Taxi Driver, in which a taxi driver talks about a story from the last seven days. ;Show and Tell :Used on the live show held at the SkyCity Casino in Auckland on 6 April 2011. Each team has to tell the audience about an interesting news story they have noticed in the last 7 days, an image of the article in a newspaper or webpage is shown to the audience. ;In my opinion/To be honest/On the bright side/All I want for Christmas (used for the 2010 series finale) :A filler at the end of the show if running early, after the final scores have been added and the winner awarded. Team members form a humorous opinion on news stories of the week. ;Guest who? :Introduced in season five, a person involved with a news story from the past week has their head covered with a black cloth, and the teams must ask closed-ended questions and the mystery guest will answer \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\". The teams will continue to ask yes-or-no questions until one team is able to work out who the guest is. ;Yeah Nah :Introduced in season five, this game works very similar to a debate, where the host presents a statement and one team will be the agreeing team and one will be the disagreeing team. The teams will then give reasons as to why they agree or disagree. A winner is picked by the host at the end of the round. ;AV Department :Introduced in season five, as a secondary school equivalent of 'My Kid Could Draw That'. A group of secondary school students must produce a short film based on a news story from the past 7 days, and the panellists are required to work out the story from the clip produced. ;Like Sex :Introduced in season nine, each team has to describe how a thing is like sex. Recurring panelists Although Dai Henwood and Paul Ego are permanent members of each team respectively a number of recurring comedians make up the remaining positions on the panels each night. This group have all been in more than two episodes and includes Ben Hurley, Josh Thomson, Steve Wrigley, Jeremy Elwood, Urzila Carlson, Jesse Grffin, Madeleine Sami, Michele A'Court, Cal Wilson, Claire Hooper, Heath Franklin (as Chopper), James Acaster, Joseph Moore, Jesse Mulligan, Peter Helliar and Jay-Jay Feeney.(http://www.tv3.co.nz/Shows/7Days.aspx), tv3.co.nz.

Born in Enterprise, Alabama, Chalker began playing the lap steel guitar while still in his teens and made his professional debut in the nightclubs of Cincinnati, Ohio.  As a sideman  In the 1950s, Chalker was touring Texas with Lefty Frizzell, replacing C.B. White, and played on the Frizzell cuts, \\"Always Late (With Your Kisses)\\" and \\"Mom and Dad's Waltz\\" (both in 1951). Chalker played dobro on these recordings. Chalker then joined Hank Thompson's Brazos Valley Boys, and was featured on the 1952 cuts, \\"Cryin' in the Deep Blue Sea\\" and \\"The Wild Side of Life\\". After two years in the US armed forces, Chalker joined the Springfield, Missouri-based Ozark Jubilee ABC Radio and TV series for several years, backing Red Foley and Porter Wagoner. During this time Chalker switched from the lap steel to the pedal steel guitar. In 1959, he moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, where he played behind fiddler Wade Ray, and later joined the band of the long-time Golden Nugget fixture Hank Penny. Roy Clark (of Hee Haw fame) also played with Penny and the two became friends. Chalker relocated to Nashville in 1965, and became successful as a session musician.  Solo work  In 1966, he made an instrumental album for Columbia Records entitled Big Hits on Big Steel. This record was produced by fellow steel guitarist Pete Drake. The follow-up release was More Ways to Play released in 1975. In 1976 he released an album consisting exclusively of Gordon Lightfoot covers, entitled Nashville Sundown. Chalker also appeared with the Nashville Symphony Orchestra, recording the album, Counterpoint which was shelved for years after its completion.  Collaborations  A prolific studio musician and sideman, Chalker performed on records and on stage with artists such as Willie Nelson, the Gap Band, Ray Price, Leon Russell, and Bill Haley and the Comets. One of his most notable collaborations was S'Wonderful (Four Giants of Swing) (1976), on which he collaborated with jazz violinist Joe Venuti, guitarist Eldon Shamblin and mandolinist Jethro Burns. On this album, the quartet played classic swing tunes by composers such as George Gershwin and Duke Ellington. Chalker also appeared on work that was outside the country and Western and swing genres, including appearances on Simon and Garfunkel's 1969 hit \\"The Boxer\\" and Marie Osmond's \\"Paper Roses\\". Proving that he had a mind for the unconventional, Chalker also appeared on Chinga Chavin's 1976 album, Country Porn. Chalker was also a member of the house band of the television show Hee Haw for 18 years, with his friend and former bandmate, Roy Clark. In 1973, to meet the demands for low-maintenance and lighter amplifiers, Hartley Peavey sought Chalker's guidance, along with that of Buddy Emmons and other steel guitarists in developing the Session 400 amplifier, which went into production in 1974. In 1985 he was inducted into the Steel Guitar Hall of Fame. Death and legacy Chalker died on April 30, 1998, from a cancer-related brain tumor. In 2009, he was honored by the Wiregrass Festival of Murals in Dothan, Alabama. His likeness is featured next to 16 other country music performers with ties to the Wiregrass Region on a mural in downtown Dothan. He is survived by his son Lee Jarane Chalker  Personality  While Chalker earned a reputation both as an innovator and performer, he was also known for his quick temper and strong personality.

He was Speaker of the House of Assembly of Newfoundland and Labrador from 1843-48. Crowdy served as clerk of the Council and colonial secretary for Cape Breton Island from 1814-20, when it became part of Nova Scotia. In 1831, with his wife Elizabeth, he came to St. John's as clerk of the Council and colonial secretary for Newfoundland. In 1832, he was named to the colony's Council. In 1836, Crowdy failed to ensure that the great seal was attached to the election writs issued in that year, which led to the invalidation of the results of the election and undermined the authority of representative government in the colony. This was viewed with suspicion since Crowdy was opposed to representative government in Newfoundland. Around the same time, he married Caroline Augusta, the daughter of John Dunscombe; his first wife had died in 1836. In 1843, the elected assembly and appointed Council were combined and Crowdy was elected speaker. The assembly and Council became separate bodies again in 1848 and Crowdy was again named to the Council. He served briefly as colonial administrator in 1852. Crowdy resigned from the Council in 1855 and returned to England, where he died in 1867 at Newton Abbot, Devon.

Gasparini (2003) History The speciation and evolution of maize varieties in Italy, by means of man-made adaptive selection, maintained a broad genetic variability for about four centuries. Traditional varieties and ecotypes were sown in the diversified ecological regions of Italy until the introduction of Corn Belt hybrids in the twentieth century presented outstanding ecological adaptation, yield and cooking characteristics. Most Italian agro-ecotypes of maize are from the Indurata and Indentata sections and their combinations, characterized by kernels with flint, semi-dent and dent consistency. A few local varieties from the Everta section (pop-corn) were also grown in Italy. The kernel apex can take different shapes: smooth, horned, cuspidate, rostrum-like or indented. The eco-agronomic characteristics of Italian traditional varieties match the Mediterranean and semi-continental climate of the country, with mostly spring and some summer (post-wheat) sowings; and early (summer) to late (autumn) maturity. Classification Classification, along the plant cropping and grain cooking characteristics, is summed in the following ear types; *Eight- rows (ottofile), *Large conic *Long-ear cylindric, *Polirows-subconic, *Short- cycle dwarf conic. An early description of 12 maize varieties was published by P. Venino in 1916, followed by extensive studies by Tito Vezio Zapparoli between 1920 and 1943. An extensive collection of 562 seed samples of local varieties was collected in 1954-1955 by Aureliano Brandolini. The agronomic, morphological and cytological characterization, and multi-variate analysis, of such and other accessions stored at the germplasm bank of the \\"Maize experimental station\\" in Bergamo, allowed the systematic classification of Italian traditional varieties.Aureliano Brandolini and Andrea Brandolini Il mais in Italia: storia naturale e agricola. CRF Press, Bergamo, 2005 Aureliano Brandolini and Andrea Brandolini. Il mais in Italia: storia naturale e agricola. II. Caratteristiche morfologiche, CRF Press, Bergamo, 2006 According to such classification, Italian traditional maize varieties are: *Sections Indurata and Indentata (9 racial complexes, 35 races & 65 agro-ecotypes) **Eight-rowed flints and derived races: 6 races and 10 agro-ecotypes ***Ottofile puri (true eight-rows) ****Ottofile ****Ottofile tardivo ****Tajolone ***Razze derivate (derivative races) ****Cannellino ****Derivati 12-14 file ****Monachello **Conical flints and derived races: 5 races and 15 agro-ecotypes ***Barbina ***Biancone ***Montano ***Ostesa ***Poliranghi **Late Southern cylindrical flints: 3 races and 4 agro-ecotypes ***Montoro ***Pannaro ***Rodindia **Midseason Southern cylindrical flints: 3 races and 6 agro- ecotypes ***Altosiculo ***Dindico ***Trentinella **Extra-early dwarf flints: 4 races and 6 agro-ecotypes ***Agostinello ***Poliota ***Tirolese ***Trenodi **Microsperma flints: 4 races e 8 agro-ecotypes ***Appenniniche ****Zeppetello ***Subalpine ****Cadore ****Cinquantino Marano ****Quarantino estivo **Padanians: 4 races and 7 agro-ecotypes ***Poliranghi ****Bani-Scaiola ****Pignolo ****Rostrato-Scagliolo ***Longispiga ****Agostano **Pearl white flints: 3 races and 4 agro-ecotypes ***Bianco Perla ***Cimalunga ***Righetta bianco **Dent corn: 2 races and 5 agro-ecotypes ***Dentati bianchi antichi ***Dentati moderni *Section Everta **Pop corn: 3 races and 12 agro-ecotypes ***Bianco tardivo cremonese ***Perla prolifico ***Risiforme precoce Future Genetic erosion is a menace to the basis of further improvement for a monoic, allogamous species, Zea mays L., whose genetic progress is mainly founded on the combination of the structural and physiological traits, contributed by each parental genotype, and a hazard to the specific qualities of different maize varieties, selected throughout the centuries as a major element for each peculiar meal involving maize derivates.

He is known as the director of the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs from 1960 to 1983, professor at the University of Oslo from 1966 to 1983 and chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee from 1979 to 1981. Early career He was born in Leipzig as a son of Stian Sanness (1880–1966) and Hanne Theodora Munthe (1882–1954). The family moved to Kristiania seven years later, and Sanness attended Kristiania Cathedral School. He joined the revolutionary group Mot Dag during this period, and was expelled from his school for protests against the 25-year anniversary of the monarchy in 1930. He later declined an offer to be reentered, and finished his secondary education as a private candidate. In 1940 he chaired the Norwegian Students' Society. In April 1940, Norway was invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany. Sanness learned from a Norwegian official in the government that he was on a list of people who would be arrested by the Gestapo, so he escaped to neutral Sweden. He travelled to London in 1941. Here he worked as a secretary for Arne Ording. Both Sanness and Ording had been Mot Dag members, but were now more mainstream Labour Party members. In addition to working for Ording, Sanness was involved in BBC broadcasts to occupied Norway, and he was a commentator in the illegal press. Post-war career He worked as the foreign affairs editor in the newspaper Arbeiderbladet from 1946 to 1950. He also taught at the University of Oslo, and took his doctorate in 1959 with the thesis Patrioter, intelligens og skandinaver. Norske reaksjoner på skandinavismen før 1848, a work on Scandinavism. He was the director of the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI) from 1960 to 1983, and a professor of history at the University of Oslo from 1966 to 1983. Notable releases include Verden blir én 1850–1914, volume five of Aschehougs verdenshistorie released in 1955. He also published studies on the Soviet Union (Sovjetsamveldet under Khrustsjov, Bergen 1960; Some Problems in the Study of Soviet Foreign Policy, 1978), Norwegian foreign policy (Norsk alliansefri politikk?, 1978) and historiography (Norske historikere og den kalde krigen, 1984). He edited the encyclopedia Tidens leksikon, released in 1975–1976, together with Einar Gerhardsen and Odd Højdahl. He also edited the periodical Samtiden from 1964 to 1967. He sat on the Norwegian Nobel Committee from 1970 to 1981 and was chair from 1979 to 1981. Some of the Nobel Peace Prizes awarded during his time in the committee were controversial, especially the 1973 award to Lê Đức Thọ and Henry Kissinger, which caused two committee members to resign. Sanness was fluent many foreign languages, including German, Russian, French and Spanish. He also spoke some Finnish. Since 1939 he was married to Dagny, née Goa. His wife outlived him as he died in November 1984 in Oslo.

Open versus closed systems are commonly applied in medical devices to maintain the sterility of a fluid pathway. CSTDs work by preventing the uncontrolled inflow and outflow of contaminants and drugs, preserving the quality of solution to be infused into a patient. Theoretically, CSTDs should enable complete protection to healthcare workers in managing hazardous drugs, but possibly due to improper handling or incomplete product design, contaminants can still be detected despite use of CSTDs. Medical use Hazardous drugs are often used for patients suffering from cancer. For example, chemotherapy agents are routinely used in the treatment of cancer. However, chemotherapy can be dangerous to a person even if they don't have cancer, as chemotherapy often indiscriminately affects both healthy and cancerous cells. For the healthcare worker tasked with preparing hazardous medications like chemotherapy, manipulation of these agents presents a substantial risk; for example, it may negatively affect their fertility, increase their risk of developing certain cancers themselves, or have unwelcome effects on fetuses. As an addition to standard safe handling practices, CSTDs are devices that are designed to additionally limit exposure of hazardous drugs to the personnel that manipulate them. Efficacy Investment and interests in CSTDs continue to grow over the past decade as concerns of Occupational Safety and Health (OSH), together with increased awareness of drug risks have pushed the market to explore better options for handling hazardous materials. A Cochrane review found \\"no evidence for or against adding CSTD to safe handling of hazardous medicines\\" based on a review of 23 studies, but acknowledged that the studies did not use randomised controlled trials nor evaluate the value of treatment. CSTDs used in this study include PhaSeal, Tevadaptor and SpikeSwan. It remains that new solutions to increasing safety of handling hazardous drugs have to be developed. Conceptually, through operating in a closed system, CSTDs should significantly reduce risks to nurses. However, the robustness of product design and extent of proper usage by nurses affects the efficacy of the CSTD in achieving OSH. History The first FDA-approved CSTD was in 1998, called PhaSeal. Since that time, many other CSTD products have been developed in the United States. MD Anderson hospital was the first hospital in the United States to widely implement CSTD technology. Definition The definition of a closed system drug transfer device was first published in an alert warning released by the American National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). This warning was issued in relation to studies that showed a correlation between working with or near hazardous drugs in a health care environment and the increased risk of developing skin rashes, infertility, miscarriage and infant birth defects, as well as the possibility of developing leukemia and other forms of cancer. This NIOSH alert recommended that a closed system drug transfer device be used whenever hazardous drugs were to be handled. NIOSH NIOSH, in response to the need for a working model as to what a \\"closed system\\" and what a \\"closed system drug transfer device\\" was, provided the following definition: “A drug transfer device that mechanically prohibits the transfer of environmental contaminants into the system and the escape of the hazardous drug or vapor concentrations outside the system”. CSTDs generally follow one of two design concepts, using either a physical barrier or an air-cleaning technology to prevent the escape of hazardous drugs into the work environment. 1.Physical Barrier - Blocking the unintended release of drug into the surrounding environment or the intake of environment contaminates into a sterile drug pathway. 2.Air Cleaning - Prevents the unintended release of drug into the surrounding environment or the intake of environmental contaminates into the sterile drug pathway. The NIOSH definition is the only definition that includes drug vapors.DHHS (NIOSH) Publication Number 2004–165, September 2004. NIOSH considers the containment of vapor extremely important, such that in September 2015, NIOSH issued a Testing Protocol to assess the effectiveness of closed systems. NIOSH developed and tested 5 CSTDs to assess its \\"closeness.\\" 2 of the 5 CSTDs tested passed. Test Protocol for Closed System Transfer Devices by NIOSH NIOSH (The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, US), recognized the importance of having a universal protocol for evaluating the performance of CSTDs (Closed System Transfer Devices). CSTD performance means preventing the release of hazardous drugs in the form of vapor, aerosol or droplets. NIOSH issued a draft protocol in September 2016. The protocol listed nine proposed surrogates that are chemically and physically similar to hazardous drug molecules. * Chemfort, Tevadaptor, PhaSeal and Equashield reduced the quantity of contamination between 5-60 fold. Relative to the needle and syringe, and results were below limitof quantitation. * The test results for the needle and syringe show the potential risk of drug release and contamination when a CSTD is not used for drug compounding the transfer. * Chemoclave results are similar to those of needle and syringe, showing a significant level of contamination. The importance of this universal protocol is that it compares the safety and efficacy of all CSTDs including tasks that challenge different CSTD components in clinical procedures. The 2-POE used as a surrogate in the protocol, tests effectivity the designs of CSTDs and the capacity of each component to prevent drug vapor, aerosol or droplet release. ISOPP ISOPP, the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners, splits the definition of a closed system into two different categories: # \\"closed\\" in terms of microbiological contamination. This definition deals purely with introducing micro-organisms into a sterile product, and there is no consideration of the sterile product coming out of the vial contaminating the environment.ISOPP Journal of Oncology Pharmacy Practice Volume 13, 2007, pg 28-29. # \\"closed\\" in relation to chemical contamination and refers to drug transfer devices that mechanically prohibit the transfer of environment contaminants into the system and the escape of hazardous drug or vapor concentrations outside the system. ISOPP, however, agree that the NIOSH definition is the most comprehensive and complete. However, the NIOSH definition is the most comprehensive and complete.

Before joining Hertford in 1990, she was a thesis fellow at All Souls College, Oxford. She has also taught at the University of Leeds and Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford. Her teaching covers Old and Middle English literature and the history of the English language. Brewer began her research career as a medievalist, with publications on the late Middle English poem Piers Plowman and its textual and editing history. The poet appears to have produced several versions of Piers Plowman at different times. Brewer's book Piers Plowman: the Z version (edited with A.G. Rigg, Toronto 1983) advanced the view that a disregarded manuscript in Oxford's Bodley Library (Bodley 851) might be an early, or even first, iteration of the poem rather than a conflation of two other versions. In a later book, Piers Plowman: the Evolution of the Poem (Cambridge University Press, 1996; reprinted 2006), Brewer looked at how editors producing single printed texts of the poem over the last five centuries assessed the evidence of the poet's original intent from the numerous and lexically varied scribal manuscripts available for scholarly interpretation. Brewer later shifted her research focus to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED). Brewer's recent research interest has attempted to understand how the OED has chosen quotations. Her 2007 book Treasure House of the Language: the Living OED covered the history of the second Supplement to the OED. In 2009, Brewer held a Leverhulme Research Fellowship to explore the OED's treatment of female-authored quotation sources of the eighteenth century.

He was educated by Dr. Henry Newcome at Newcome's School in Hackney, and matriculated as a pensioner of Queens' College, Cambridge, on 11 July 1741. He proceeded B.A. 1744, M.A. 1748, D.D. 1761, and on 21 March 1745 was elected fellow of his college. In 1752 he was instituted to the rectory of Wimpole, Cambridgeshire, on the presentation of Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke; at the same time he held the vicarage of Whaddon. In 1756 Lord Hardwicke made him prebendary of Norwich Cathedral. In 1760 he was elected president of his college, and in 1769 professor of casuistry. These offices, together with his preferments, he held till his death. He was vice-chancellor 1760-61 and 1777-78. Plumptre interested himself in the history of his college, and left some manuscript collections for it. In the university he supported the movement inaugurated by John Jebb in favour of annual examinations, and was a member of the syndicate appointed on 17 February 1774 to devise a scheme for carrying them out, which was rejected on 19 April in the same year.

The appellant, Stevens, had sold and installed modchips that circumvented the Sony PlayStation's copy protection mechanism. Sony argued that Stevens had knowingly sold or distributed a \\"circumvention device\\" which was capable of circumventing a \\"technological protection measure\\", contrary to s 116A of the Copyright Act. At first instance, the Federal Court (Sackville J) held that the relevant copy protection feature was not a \\"technological protection measure\\" and refused Sony's application for relief under s 116A.. Sony successfully appealed the primary judge's decision in the Full Court of the Federal Court.. The High Court then reversed the Full Court's decision, endorsing Sackville J's construction of the term \\"technological protection measure\\".  Background  The Applicant (Collectively described as “Sony”) manufacture and distribute the Sony PlayStation computer game console and computer games on CD-ROMs for use with the Sony PlayStation console. Sony owns copyright of the computer programs embodied in the CD-ROMs of the games (as literary works under Part III of the Copyright Act 1968) and in the cinematograph films (as subject-matter other than works in Part IV of the Copyright Act 1968).. In the manufacturing process, Sony embedded access control technology in the form of RAC's into all Sony's games. This worked in the way that once a Sony PlayStation game was inserted into a Sony PlayStation console, the console would only play Sony games with the corresponding regional code. If the ROM chip in the game console did not read a RAC or the RAC did not correspond with the console, then it would not play the disk. This worked to block out illegally copied games, as when a game was conventionally copied to another CD (‘burnt’) it would not copy the RAC. However, the RAC also blocked legally copied disksBack-up copies of computer programs allowed in special provision in . and games legally purchased from different regional codes. As a result of this, a market evolved for modifications (‘mod chips’), which could override the RAC scan process in the game console, so that ‘burnt’ games could be used. Mr Stevens sold and installed ‘mod chips’ for use in PlayStation consoles, which overrode Sony's access control technology. Stevens carried out this activity in Sydney. In addition to this, Stevens, on two occasions sold unauthorised copies of Sony PlayStation games.  Federal Court & Appeals  In 2001, Sony commenced action in the Federal Court of Australia against Stevens, alleging inter alia that he breached s 116A of the Copyright Act 1968.. The allegation was that the unlawful sale of devices (the ‘mod chips’) circumvented Technological Protection Measures (TPMs). Sony alleged that Steven's ‘mod chips’ circumvented a measure that protected the applicants’ copyright in literary works (computer programs) and cinematograph films. Whether the ‘mod chips’ were a circumvention device depended on whether Sony's RAC system was defined as a TPM within the meaning of s 10(1) of the Act. This was of particular interest to The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), who successfully applied for amicus curiae because of it. The ACCC thought that Sony's RAC process interfered with imported lawfully sold copyright material in Australia by blocking the use of games purchased from different regional codes. At first instance in the Federal Court of Australia, Sackville J held that Sony's RAC system did not fall within the meaning of a TPM as contained in s 10(1) of the Act. Sackville J focused his attention on the opening words of the definition, and held that Sony's “device” was not, as such, in the ordinary course of its operation, designed “to prevent or inhibit the infringement of copyright”. Sackville J reasoned that Sony's RAC system “merely [had] a general deterrent or discouraging effect on those who might be contemplating infringing copyright... for example, by making unlawful copies of a CD-ROM.” Thus, Sackville J held that by not preventing the act of primary infringement in an immediate sense, Sony's RAC system did not constitute a TPM within the meaning of s 10 (1) of the Act. Sony appealed to the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia, who reversed the decision of Sackville J. The Full Court reached their decision, on 30 July 2003, through a broader interpretation of the meaning of TPM. The Full Court held that Sonys’ RAC system did constitute a TPM, and thus the Respondent was liable for charges based on s 115 of the Act. The Full Court made a declaration as follows: > “ On 8 April 2001, 28 September 2001 and 16 November 2001 [Mr Stevens] sold > circumvention devices, as defined in [ the Act, s 10(1)], for use in > association with ‘PlayStation’ computer consoles and the CD-ROMs for ‘ > PlayStation’ computer games, in contravention of s 116A of [the[ Act.” Stevens appealed to the High Court of Australia. Sony in response, sought to appeal matters on which it did not succeed in the Full Court. The High Court of Australia reversed the decision of the Full Court agreeing with the decision of the primary judge, Sackville. On 6 October 2005, the High Court ruled that Sony PlayStations RAC system could not be defined as a TPM as it did not prevent illegal copying of the games, it merely prevented illegal copies from being played. Thus, Stevens was not liable for this charge.  High Court decision  The key question in the case was whether Sony's device could be defined as a “technological protection measure” (TPM). Sony submitted that its device (comprising either or both the PlayStation Boot ROM and access code) constituted a TPM on three distinct bases, all of which come within the construction of the language in the Copyright Act.  Construction of definition of ‘technological protection measure’  A ‘technological protection measure’ is defined in s10 of the Act as a device that “in the normal course of its operation, prevents, inhibits or restricts the doing of an act comprised in the copyright”.. Sony's first submission was based on the scope of the definition of “inhibit” in determining whether Sony's protective devices constituted a TPM and were thus protected by s 116A of the Act. Stevens argued that Sackville J's narrow interpretation of the term “inhibit” at the first hearing was correct. Sackville J defined a device as “designed…to prevent or inhibit” copyright infringement if “but for the operation of the device or product, there would be no technological or perhaps mechanical barrier to a person… putting himself or herself in a position to infringe copyright in the work.” In response, Sony contended that the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia's interpretation of the term “inhibit”, should be accepted. In this broader definition, a device that is designed to “deter” or “discourage” the infringement of copyright was seen as inhibiting the infringement of copyright. The Full Court found that Sony's PlayStation Boot ROM chip and access code “inhibits” infringement of copyright as the restricted access to the work eliminates the reason for users to infringe copyright in the work. Sony pointed out that “an unplayable copy of a PlayStation game has no market value.” The High Court of Australia found that “Sony’s device of the Boot ROM chip and the access code… does not constitute a “technological protection measure” by virtue of the device's deterrent effect on the copying of computer games. That is because the console's inability to load the software from an infringing copy does not make it impossible or more physically difficult to make an infringing copy.” The High Court further found that protective devices like the PlayStation Boot ROM and access code are not “designed… to prevent… the infringement of copyright,” as they do not render the user unable to “reproduce the work in material form.”  The reproduction in RAM contention  Sony's second submission in the High Court was that the device fell within the terms of the definition of \\"technological protection measure\\" because it prevented PlayStation users from reproducing copyrighted game code “in material form” in the Ram of the PlayStation console. “Material form” was defined, in section 10 (1) the Act, as including “any form (whether visible or not) of storage from which… a substantial part of the work can be reproduced.” In cross-examination, Mr Nabarro from Sony conceded that the game code could not be reproduced “without developing particular hardware to extract [the code] back from RAM.” Sony argued that the dissenting judgment of Finkelstein J in the Full Court of the Federal Court correctly applied the law. His Honour ruled that it is not necessary that \\"the ability to reproduce the work from storage must exist at the time the work is placed into storage\\". It is just important that the work “can be reproduced.” The High Court declined Sony's argument, siding with Stevens- who relied on the precedent of Emmet J's decision in Australian Video Retailers Association v Warner Home Video Pty Ltd.. In which Emmet J ruled, in relation to the RAM of a DVD Player, that: “… In ordinary form, temporary storage of a substantial part of the computer program in the RAM of a DVD Player will not involve a reproduction of the computer program in a material form.” The High Court found, in a majority decision written by Chief Justice Gleeson, that > “ as it is impossible to reproduce the storage of the game code from the RAM > of the PlayStation console unless the console is modified with additional, > reverse-engineered hardware, it is not possible for the code to be > reproduced until that modification occurs. Thus, the definition of “material > form” is not satisfied until the conditions that enable the reproduction of > the work from storage in RAM prevail.” Stevens produced, supplied and installed mod chips for PlayStations that did not have hardware to extract the code from the RAM. Therefore, The High Court of Australia found that the devices that Steven's mod chips circumvented were not a “technological protection measure” to which s 116A of the Act applied, as they were not “designed… to prevent” the act of reproduction of the work in “material form”. All Judges in both the Full Court of the Federal Court and the High Court of Australia, with the exception of Finkelstein J (Full Court), unanimously agreed with the ruling of Sackville J in declining Sony's “Reproduction in RAM” argument.  The Cinematographic Film Contention  Thirdly, Sony alleged that their device prevented PlayStation users from infringing copyright, by not allowing the RAM in the PlayStation to download a “substantial part” of the game's “cinematograph film.” Sony claimed that Steven's mod chips reversed this function, allowing the RAM to download a “substantial part” of the game's “cinematograph film” and thus infringed copyright within the meaning of ss 86(a) and 14(1) of the Copyright Act 1968. Sackville J in the initial hearing found that only a very small proportion of the images and sounds comprising the cinematograph film were \\"embodied\\" in the PlayStation console's RAM at any given time. \\"In the circumstances as they arose at trial, Sony failed to lay the necessary evidentiary basis for a finding in its favour on substantiality\\". The High Court accepted this. The High Court found that although Mr. Nabarro's evidence established that “specific parts of that game console” are transmitted to, and embodied in, the GPU at no point did the “specific parts” form an “aggregate of the visual image.” The majority of the High Court held “ At no point in the process through which the game code is downloaded into the RAM and eventually transmitted to the television is a “cinematograph film” copied into any of the PlayStation console's articles or things.” All Judges in both the Full Court of the Federal Court and the High Court of Australia, with the exception of Finkelstein J (Full Court), unanimously agreed with the ruling of Sackville J in declining Sony’s “Cinematographic Film” argument.  Academic Opinion- Conclusions to be drawn from Steven’s Case.  In academic circles this case is generally seen as an example of the court taking different approaches to statutory interpretation, in relation to a complex Act. Chief Justice Gleeson in The High Court stated; > “Over a long period amendments to copyright law have comprised legislative > solutions to problems created by competing economic and social pressures > associated with the development of new technologies. The issues in the > present appeal indicate that this is very much the case today.… The task of > the Court on this appeal is to construe the particular compromises reflected > in the terms of the Amendment Act.” Gleeson CJ's statement makes sense of the considerable controversy felt in Australia and elsewhere concerning the proper scope of such legislation. Padgett asserts that the overtly complex nature of the Amendments to the Copyright Act, particularly in relation to the copyright infringement exceptions, has made it very difficult to comply with. (2003) 4(1) Digital Technology Law Journal 2 at paras 50-91. Padgett believes that this case indicates that the sui generis nature of computer programs needs to be given further consideration and that possibly an independent legal regime needs to be created for computer programs, disassociated from literary works. Despite claims that the Digital Agenda Act will “replicate the balance that has been struck in the print environment between the rights of owners of copyright and the rights of users,”. this case actually highlights the very fragile nature of copyright in the digital arena. (2003) 4(1) Digital Technology Law Journal 1. Dellit & Kendall imply that possibly a ‘state of panic’ over computer games piracy lead to the increased restrictions of the Digital Agenda Act. This is not surprising with estimations, like Sony's, that Sony games piracy costs the Australian industry $30 million a year. However, as highlighted in Steven's case, the Digital Agenda Act has not yet been able to establish in copyright law the delicate balance between the rights of copyright owners and the interests of copyright users. This delicate balance is reflected in Gleeson CJ's statement referred to above, that “…The task of this Court … is to construe the particular compromises …” Kenyon & Wright suggest that the effect of this case may spread out to decisions regarding media regulation. The major issue in Australia of the treatment of TPMs and their circumvention under copyright law could possibly re-emerge in decisions about media regulation – as illustrated in the proposal for content protection.

Dreams Come True (DCT) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization in Jacksonville, Florida, begun by Tom McGehee and his wife Delia, that grants the dreams (within certain parameters) of children with life-limiting illnesses. In 2009, the organization celebrated a quarter century of service and over 2,500 dreams fulfilled. History In 1984, McGehee, co-founder of Mac Papers, learned about George Lee, a 17-year- old with cystic fibrosis. Lee's dream was to play with golfer Fred Couples, and the McGehees fulfilled George's dream. Lee died less than a year later, but was buried with a driver given to him by Couples. McGehee presented the idea of a charitable group that fulfills the wishes of children with terminal conditions to local business leaders, including Hugh Jones, Chairman of Barnett Bank; Jay Stein and Jack Williams of Stein Mart; and Dr. Roy Baker, Chairman of University Medical Center. They supported the concept, and Dreams Come True was created. At the time, McGehee owned television station channel 47, and the charity began work in an empty office there. Laine Silverfield was the first employee, hired to work part-time in 1988. The budget was $30,000 and in the first four years, they arranged the dreams of about nine children per year. Over 20 years, she was named Executive Director, then later, President of the board of Directors. When Tom McGehee died in 2002, DCT had granted the dreams of 1,275 children. According to Suzanne Crittenden, former DCT Associate Director, \\"His promise to every child was that 'if you have a life-threatening illness, you will have a dream come true.' He left a big void, but he's charged Dreams Come True with quite a mission.\\" In the next seven years, the organization nearly doubled the number of dreams fulfilled in the previous 18 years. A new home built for the organization was dedicated on September 3, 2002 in honor of Tom McGehee. The 4,600 ft² facility at Southpoint Parkway was virtually free of cost to the non-profit. The land, construction material and labor were donated by businesses. Ms. Silverfield, who retired in 2008, had been the first director until she was named President following McGehee's death. Suzanne Crittenden replaced Silverfield as Executive Director and served until Florida Times-Union business writer Karen Brune Mathis replaced Ms. Crittenden in 2008. In 2010, Karen Brune Mathis returned to reporting as the managing editor for the Jacksonville Financial News and Daily Record. Currently Jimmy Kelly serves as Executive Director. Program Dreams Come True is the only locally based nonprofit organization in Jacksonville, FL dedicated to fulfilling the dreams of local children battling life-threatening illnesses. Eligibility The organization serves children from 2½ up to age 18 who have a life-threatening illness such as AIDS, cancer, cystic fibrosis, heart disease, leukemia, muscular dystrophy or kidney dysfunction. They must be referred by their physician and live in or be treated in northeast Florida or southeast Georgia. Dreams The most common dream for young children is going to Disneyworld. Other activities have included swimming with dolphins, meeting celebrities, big game fishing, seeing the volcanoes of Hawaii, a glacier in Alaska, going on a shopping spree, taking a cruise and touring Washington, D.C. or New York City. Today, an average dream costs $4,600. Each child can only be granted one dream, but the organization invites past recipients to special events, such as their \\"Children of Christmas\\" Party. In 2009, the 19th annual celebration was held at a CiCi's Pizza and a large section of the parking lot was blocked off for a display of Jacksonville Sheriff's Office police cars and motorcycles; Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department fire engines, rescue units and a mobile command center; but the highlight was the arrival of Shands Jacksonville's Trauma One helicopter These special events are part of the organizations Special Times Program. Special Times provides the dream child and his or her family a time to momentarily forget the realities of life- threatening illnesses. It may be dinner at a favorite restaurant, tickets to a Jacksonville Jaguars game, a relaxing evening at the movies, a day of beauty, concert or theater tickets, a gift certificate to a store, new release DVDs or even a special holiday or birthday treat. Whatever the opportunity, Special Times reminds the children and their families that they are special and loved. Purpose Having a dream fulfilled gives a child and their family a reprieve from the necessary medical treatment that these children must endure. It can give hope and create memories that help carry them through difficult times. A child's attitude toward treatment can be dramatically impacted by having a dream fulfilled, according to medical professionals. Performance In 2009, Dreams Come True received Charity Navigator's highest 4-star rating for sound fiscal management for the fifth consecutive year. Only 4% of the nonprofits Charity Navigator rates have received at least 5 consecutive 4-star evaluations. Charity Navigator evaluates non-profit performance and rates organizations. Kids Helping Kids Kids Helping Kids is a special program that unites groups of young people with dream recipients.

Meteorological history Early on November 21 the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) reported that an area of convection had persisted within a monsoon trough about 880 km, (545 mi) to the southeast of Guam. At this time the system was moving around the subtropical ridge of pressure, with an anticyclone over the cyclone helping the convection to consolidate over a broad and elongated low level circulation center which was located in an area of minimal vertical wind shear. Later that morning a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was released as deep convection increased in organization with multiple bands of convection starting to wrap into the developing low level circulation center. The system was then declared as a tropical depression by the JMA later that day before the JTWC followed suit early the next day, who assigned the designation of 26W to the depression. During November 22, the depression remained weak, before during the next day both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, with the JMA assigning the international number of 0922 and name of Nida as it started to move along a subtropical ridge. Typhoon Nida as it was going through an eyewall replacement cycle Later on November 23, microwave imagery showed that an eye had developed within a well defined low level circulation center. Early the next day, the JTWC reported that Nida had intensified into a category 1 typhoon as the eye became well defined with deep convection wrapping around most of the eye. However, despite the JTWC reporting 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 160 km/h, (100 mph), the JMA only reported 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 110 km/h, (70 mph) which made Nida a Severe Tropical Storm. Early on November 25 the JMA reported that Nida had intensified into a typhoon before reporting later that day that the typhoon had rapidly intensified under favourable conditions and reached its peak 10-minute wind speeds of 195 km/h (120 mph), with a peak pressure of 905 hPa. During the next day the JTWC also reported that Typhoon Nida had rapidly intensified over the previous 18 hours into a category five super typhoon with winds of 285 km/h (180 mph), as it maintained a well defined symmetrical structure. The JTWC then reported that Nida had intensified a little bit more and reached its peak 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 290 km/h (185 mph). The typhoon later weakened to a category four, before re-strengthening to a category five on November 27, remaining quasi-stationary for more than two days. It weakened to a tropical depression on December 2 due to stronger vertical wind shear associated by the Northeast monsoon, and the storm dissipated on December 4. Preparations and impact Micronesia Early on November 24, the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Tiyan, Guam (NWS Guam) placed the island of Faraulep, before later that morning issuing tropical storm watches for Fais and Ulithi. As Nida was upgraded to a typhoon by the JTWC, the NWS upgraded the tropical storm warning for Faraulep to a typhoon warning. Later that day they reported that the typhoon warning for Faraulep had been cancelled as Nida was moving to the northwest away from Faraulep before early the next day the tropical storm warning for Fais and Ulithi were cancelled.

On 30 December 1990, he was killed by Royal Marines near a checkpoint in Cullyhanna. His brother, Michael Caraher, who was severely wounded in the shooting, later became the shooter of one of the South Armagh sniper squads, which killed seven British soldiers and two Royal Ulster Constabulary members.Gerry Moriarty, \\"'Those people who murdered Paul will have that on their conscience' \\", Irish Times, 15 December 2007 Michael Caraher was imprisoned in 1997, but released in 2000 under the prisoner release terms of the Good Friday Agreement.

Both men, Lance Corporal Richard Elkington, 23, and Private Andrew Callaghan, 21, from 45 Commando RM, denied the charges and were acquitted. Prosecutors outlined that Elkington smashed the driver's window with his rifle and opened fire on the car, ordering Callaghan to do likewise as the brothers attempted to drive from a pub car park. They also stated that the investigation into the shooting had been hampered as British soldiers had removed spent bullet cases instead of preserving the scene for police scenes- of-crime officers and that there was no lawful justification for firing on the car. Elkington told police he had fired nine aimed shots at the driver, believing that a third soldier was being carried away on the bonnet of the car. Callaghan stated that he fired 12 shots because he feared for the life of the third Marine, who was out of sight. Fergal Caraher is one of 24 Provisional IRA volunteers remembered at the South Armagh Memorial Garden in Mullaghbawn, near Slieve Gullion mountain.

Life He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating Bachelor of Arts (BA) in 1706, Cambridge Master of Arts (MA Cantab) in 1710, Bachelor of Divinity (BD) in 1724, and Doctor of Divinity (DD) per regias literas in 1728. He was elected a Fellow of Trinity, but in 1708 left Cambridge to serve a curacy at Upwell in Norfolk. In 1717 Richard Bentley, who had a difference with the junior bursar, John Myers, removed him, and recalled Walker to Cambridge to fill his place. From this time a friendship began between Walker and Bentley, and Walker helped Bentley in his struggle within the college. On 27 April 1734 Bentley was sentenced by the college Visitor, Thomas Green, bishop of Ely, to be deprived of the mastership of Trinity College. On the resignation of John Hacket, the vice-master, on 17 May 1734, Walker was appointed to his place, and refused to carry out the bishop's sentence. On 25 June 1735, at the instance of John Colbatch, a senior fellow, the court of king's bench granted a mandamus addressed to Walker, requiring him to execute the sentence or to show cause for not doing so. Walker, in reply, questioned the title of the bishop to the office of general visitor, and the affair dragged on until 1736, when Green's death put an end to the attempts of Bentley's opponents. Walker was the companion of Bentley's old age, and was introduced by Alexander Pope into the Dunciad' with his patron. In 1744 Walker was appointed professor of moral philosophy at Cambridge, and in 1745 he was nominated rector of Thorpland in Norfolk, a living which he exchanged in 1757 for that of Upwell. He was devoted to horticulture, and had a small garden within the precincts of Trinity College which was famous for exotic plants, including the pineapple, banana, coffee shrub, logwood tree, and torch thistle, which, with the aid of a hothouse, he was able to raise. On 16 July 1760 he purchased land from Richard Whish, a vintner, and on 25 Aug. 1762 conveyed the principal part to the university in trust for the establishment of the Cambridge University Botanic Garden which occupied the site until its move one mile south in 1846. In 1763 he published anonymously A Short Account of the late Donation of a Botanic Garden to the University of Cambridge. He died at Cambridge, unmarried, on 15 December 1764.

It's a slightly kitsch success.\\" Jude Rogers of The Quietus gave the album a positive and lengthy review, citing Shakespears Sister's history and success with \\"Stay\\", and reviewing each individual track and how they worked within the whole album, highlighting \\"A Loaded Gun\\" as \\"terrifying and poppy\\" and going on to lament that \\"Fahey will always be remembered for the song that destroyed her, and not the career that should have followed it, and the drive that should have made her a pioneering artist.

Eidlitz: *1885 - Alexander Graham Bell commissions first Manhattan telephone building Eidlitz & McKenzie (1900-1910) Eidlitz formed a partnership with structural engineer Andrew C. McKenzie, establishing the firm of Eidlitz & McKenzie, to pioneer a new building design. With Andrew McKenzie, he formed one of the first architecture firms that put architects and engineers on equal footing. Eidlitz and McKenzie worked primarily on telephone buildings, a new building type in the period. In 1905, the firm designed The New York Times BuildingNY Times on the site then renamed Times Square in its honor. The task was complicated by the simultaneous construction of a subway at the building's foundation.

Stephen F. Voorhees and Paul Gmelin, already with the firm became partners and Eidlitz and McKenzie was reorganized and renamed as McKenzie, Voorhees and Gmelin. This became a tradition of the firm: partners choosing their successors from within the firm in order to establish a smooth transfer of ownership. Over the next fifteen years, the firm added notable designs for clients in the telephone, banking and R&D; industries, including labs for Western Electric (1922), the South Brooklyn Savings Bank (1924) and the Brooklyn Municipal Building (1924).

Notable structures such as the Barclay-Vesey Building, the Western Union Building (at 60 Hudson Street (New York City) in Manhattan and is today a central technical facility for over 100 telecom companies); Salvation Army Headquarters (New York City) (completed in 1930 and remaining as the Salvation Army's headquarters today) and, in 1931, the 50-story Irving Trust Headquarters Building at One Wall Street in Lower Manhattan were all completed. During the Great Depression Walker and Voorhees worked on the 1933 Century of Progress International Exposition in Chicago and the 1939 New York World's Fair.

The offices were recorded as being located at 101 Park Avenue, New York City. During World War II, the firm's contribution to the war effort began with a commission to design Army Air Corps bases in Trinidad. Laboratories geared to defense follow, along with structures at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and facilities necessary for the transport of heavy military equipment. In 1941, the first phase of the new Bell Telephone Laboratories was completed on at Murray Hill, New Jersey. The project introduced the flexible-modular approach to laboratory design, demonstrating an efficient use of space and accommodating 6,000 scientists, engineers, and administrators dedicated to the study of sound and sound transmission. Bell Labs foreshadowed the subsequent postwar movement of research labs from converted manufacturing plants to separate facilities in suburban locations. During this period, Benjamin Lane Smith, one of the firm's chief designers, became a partner; however the firm's name remained Voorhees, Walker, Foley & Smith. Projects of note during this period included Argonne National Laboratory (the research center for the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission in Lemont, Illinois) and the Savannah River Plant in Aiken, South Carolina which was built on a site larger than the entire island of Manhattan.

With the celebration of its seventy-fifth anniversary in the early 1960s the firm began to expand its operations internationally. At the same time, the office continued to design extensive testing and research facilities for both private and government clients within the United States. One notable example of this work was the Goddard Space Flight Center, a multi-building project for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, was completed in 1965 to implement President John F. Kennedy’s commitment to put a man on the moon. With the retirements of Benjamin Lane Smith in 1966 and Perry Coke Smith in 1968, the Smith names were dropped from the firm of Haines, Lundberg Waehler.

International projects allowed the firm to bring their designs outside the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s, including the Centro Sperimentale Metallurgico, a research center for the development of steel projects was completed on a site outside Rome and the International Institute Of Tropical Agriculture, a research and housing facility on a site in Ibadan, Nigeria. In order to accommodate growth in its overseas practice, the firm created a new division of operations, HLW International, with its first offices in Beirut and then in Athens with projects extending to Lebanon and Saudi Arabia. In 1982, the first Midtown Manhattan office of the U.S. Trust Corporation was restored by the firm to the original 1896 design by McKim Mead and White, while accommodating the requirements of a 1980s office. HLW won awards from the New York Landmarks Conservancy, the Building Owners and Managers Association, and the Metropolitan Chapter of the Victorian Society in America.http://www.metrovsa.org/pastawards.htm In 1983, significant modifications were made for the existing Chemical Bank World Headquarters at 277 Park Avenue in Manhattan. This design included the enclosure of an existing plaza to create Chemcourt, which provided the city with a park-like enclosed space. Exactly 100 years after the firm's beginning with a commission to design the first telephone building in New York, a new project for NYNEX Corporation was initiated, as was a training center for The Travelers Insurance Companies in Hartford, Connecticut. In the decades since HLW's 100th anniversary, the firm has extended to broadcast, film and television industries. For Fox Studios in Los Angeles, HLW created a campus that housed the first fully digital network broadcast center. The project incorporated several buildings, creative site/landscape design and over of historical renovations. When Avon Products hired the firm to design a new global research and design center, HLW relocated the company from its old space into its new facility in New York.

In his last 10 years at the office prior to being elected to the Assembly, Pacheco won every single case that he tried which included 5 death penalty cases. His skill as a prosecutor was acknowledged his first year in the office when he was named \\"Prosecutor of the Year\\" in the Juvenile Crime Division. In 1987 Pacheo received the \\"Outstanding Achievement Award\\" and in 1994 he received the \\"Special Achievement Award\\" for his work in the District Attorney's Criminal Division. Assembly career Pacheco ran for the California State Assembly in 1996. With his victory, he became the first Latino Republican elected in more than a century. He was elected Leader of the Republican caucus, marking the first time in the state's history that a Latino has served in that capacity. Pacheco sought greater protections for the men and women of law enforcement. During his first term in office, he authored the successful Proposition 222 – \\"The Peace Officer's Safety Initiative\\" – which prohibited the possibility of parole for the murder of a peace officer. Proposition 222 garnered nearly 80% of California voters' support on the June 1998 ballot. In honor of Pacheco's commitment to victims and the criminal justice system, numerous public safety associations named him \\"Legislator of the Year\\". They included Crime Victims United of California, the California Correctional Peace Officers Association, the California Department of Forestry Firefighters Association, the California District Attorney's Association and the California Highway Patrol. On a local level, the Riverside Sheriffs' Association and the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Riverside County also honored him.

His efforts resulted in numerous advances for California's schools, most notable was an investment in textbooks and push for stronger school accountability, increased safety measures in schoolyards, and the implementation of statewide testing standards. As an Assemblyman, the California School Boards Association and the University of California Alumni Association recognized his commitment to education at all levels when both groups named Rod Pacheco their \\"Legislator of the Year.\\" In 2000, Pacheco formed a bipartisan legislative coalition aimed at reforming the Cal Grant system to ensure that all eligible students would be provided the resources they need to attend college. The legislation passed both houses of the State Legislature and was signed into law. John Mockler, then California Secretary of Child Development, hailed its passage as \\"…the most significant educational reform since the G.I. bill.\\" Pacheco was honored by the California State University Students Association as their \\"Legislator of the Year\\" for this achievement. Back to the DA's office In 2002, Pacheco concluded his legislative service and returned to the Riverside County District Attorney's Office as a Chief Deputy District Attorney. In 2003, he was promoted to Assistant District Attorney for the Western Division. Career as District Attorney In 2006, Pacheco was elected the Riverside County District Attorney without any opposition. He was sworn in as District Attorney on the steps of Riverside County's Historic Courthouse by California Supreme Court Chief Justice Ronald M. George. Speaking at Pacheco's inauguration were former California Governor Pete Wilson and renowned attorney Tino Garza. Pacheco in his remarks promised that he would continue the tradition set by his predecessor, Grover Trask, of having a highly professional office of attorneys that aggressively prosecute crime. Pacheco also stated that he would concentrate on four important areas as the District Attorney: gangs, crime victim rights, public integrity, and environmental justice. Pacheco led \\"Operation Falling Sun\\" which was the largest gang raid in Riverside County's history. 700 law enforcement officers of numerous agencies went into the community of Desert Hot Springs and made numerous arrests and even demolished a drug house. Because of Pacheco's efforts, the number of gang members in Riverside County fell by 40%. Since Pacheco was sworn in as District Attorney, Riverside County's violent crime rate decreased by 26% according to the California Department of Justice. Additionally, Riverside County has the second highest conviction rate among mid to large counties in California at 93%. According to the California Department of Justice, Riverside County is rated as the third safest mid-to-large county in California. Gangs Pacheco is credited with developing and pushing a plan to create a gang task force designated to cover all of Riverside County. After gathering a coalition of law enforcement officials, Riverside County developed a countywide regional strategy for combating the increased gang activity occurring in Riverside County communities. The Riverside County Gang Task Force (GTF) was created in late 2006 and fully staffed with roughly 70 sworn law enforcement officers from 22 different law enforcement agencies by early 2007. The GTF strategy is to combine resources from local, state and federal law enforcement agencies to create eight (8) separate gang task force units across the county. The strategy involves a three-prong approach involving prevention, intervention and suppression. Pacheco issued the first ever gang injunction in Riverside County history in August 2007 against the largest Riverside County criminal street gang, East Side Riva. In response, an East Side Riva gang member who was an employee of the Press-Enterprise newspaper threatened to kill Pacheco. The newspaper employee took out a classified advertisement in the Press- Enterprise newspaper with the threat, and Pacheco's personal address and cellular phone number, which was obtained through the Pacheco's newspaper subscription records. The employee, Chandler W. Cardwell, was prosecuted by the California Attorney General and convicted of threatening a public official. Pacheco announced a second gang injunction against the Barrio Dream Homes criminal street gang in Cathedral City, CA on June 12, 2008. The third and fourth gang injunctions were announced in accordance with Operation Falling Sun on March 27, 2009 in the city of Desert Hot Springs against the True Crime Boys and West Drive Locos criminal street gangs. Beginning in December 2009, there were numerous attempts to kill gang task force law enforcement officers in the city of Hemet. On July 7, 2010, Pacheco announced the filing of charges against two men involved in those attacks. Nicholas John Smit, 39, of Hemet was charged with nine counts while co-conspirator Steven William Hansen, 36, of Homeland was charged with three counts involving attempted murder of a peace officer. Sex predators Pacheco is credited with coming up with the idea for the Riverside County Sexual Assault Felony Enforcement (SAFE) task force. The team was created in November 2006. When the team was created, it was estimated that 25% of all registered sex offenders were out of compliance with the terms of their registration under California penal code 290. As of May 2010, the non-compliance rate for sex offenders was at 3%. The Riverside County SAFE Task Force is a multi-agency Task Force that uses the combined expertise and resources of various law enforcement agencies to create five regional teams throughout Riverside County. The five regional teams are the Indio Region, Corona Region, Cabazon Region, Temecula Region, and Riverside and Moreno Valley Region. The mission of the Sexual Assault Felony Enforcement (SAFE) Task Force, through the collaborative effort of multi-disciplined Riverside County law enforcement agencies, is to increase public awareness of sexual predators and significantly decrease sexually motivated crimes in the County of Riverside through monitoring, investigating, and prosecuting sex registrants pursuant to California Penal Code Section 290. Public integrity On June 16, 2008, Pacheco along with the Attorney General obtained an indictment on four people on a combined 11 felony and 26 misdemeanor counts for their roles in a money-laundering conspiracy involving six different political campaigns for state office. The defendants were Mark Leggio, Nicola Cacucciolo, Nick Vito Cacucciolo and James Lloyd Deremiah. The charges stemmed from illegal monetary contributions made by the defendants to at least six different political campaigns for state office. The timing and pattern of these contributions demonstrated that defendant Leggio had reimbursed employees and friends for making those political contributions. Environmental crimes On May 3, 2010, Pacheco, along with then Attorney General Jerry Brown and 18 other California District Attorneys announced they had reached a $27.6 million settlement with Wal-mart Stores Inc. for various violations of environmental laws and regulations. As part of the settlement, Wal-mart instituted policies and procedures throughout their company in California to assure that environmental law and regulations are followed. There were 22 Wal-mart stores in Riverside County in violation of environmental regulations. On July 10, 2008, Pacheco filed legal action seeking an injunction against TravelCenters of America for violating the laws governing the management and handling of underground storage tanks of hazardous materials. At the request of Pacheco, Attorney General Brown joined the case to enforce California's health and safety laws, which Travelcenters had consistently violated and ignored. Over a number of years, the Riverside Department of Environmental Health conducted inspections at the TravelCenters facility in Riverside County, which revealed numerous, longstanding violations of California's underground storage tank law. TravelCenters of America had failed to correct many of the deficiencies, even after repeated warnings. Operation Falling Sun Pacheco launched an 8-month investigation that resulted in 700 police officers from 35 different law enforcement agencies conducting the largest gang suppression operation in the history of Riverside County on March 27, 2009. The operation was conducted in conjunction with the service of two gang injunction lawsuits against two of the most violent Desert Hot Springs criminal street gangs. Pacheco's operation resulted in the arrest of 126 known gang members and other violent criminals, the removal of 50 firearms from the streets, and the seizure of drugs. Pacheco told The Desert Sun regarding the Operation Falling Sun: \\"I want the gangs to feel like the sun has fallen on them.\\" Three months after Operation Falling Sun, Pacheco announced along with Thomas P. O'Brien \\"Operation Falling Sun Phase II.\\" During an 11-month investigation, the preeminent drug distributors in Desert Hot Springs were uncovered and arrested and charged with federal drug charges. The investigation uncovered the details of the drug dealers' connection to the Mexican drug cartels. DEA Investigators, FBI agents, an ICE agent, and an IRS investigator have developed cases against the major distributors and followed the trail of ill-gained drug money. Early release In August 2007, Pacheco gathered support from 19 other elected District Attorneys in California and filed a motion in federal court seeking to prevent the early release of 56,000 criminals from California State Prisons on behalf of the citizens of Riverside County. Pacheco dedicated Riverside County Assistant District Attorney Bill Mitchell to be lead counsel in the lawsuit to represent himself and the elected District Attorneys from San Diego, Santa Barbara, Orange, Sacramento, San Bernardino, Placer, Colusa, Amador, Contra Costa, Solano, Tehama, Butte, Kern, San Luis Obispo, Ventura, El Dorado, Nevada, Kings and Tuolumne Counties. In the motion, the 20 District Attorneys have intervened in a federal lawsuit filed against Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and the State of California by two California prison inmates, Ralph Coleman and Marciano Plata. The Coleman/Plata lawsuit asks the state to address the prison overcrowding issue. The 20 District Attorneys filed the motion in opposition to the Coleman/Plata lawsuit after the United States District Court for the Eastern and Northern District of California appointed a three judge panel to recommend solutions to the overcrowding issues which included implementing a prison population cap and ordering the early release of prisoners. On December 12, 2008, Pacheco testified in the lawsuit against the early release of prisoners in the San Francisco federal court. In his testimony, Pacheco offered evidence that the early release of prisoners would jeopardize public safety and further harm our fragile local criminal justice system. United States Code section 3626 requires the court to give substantial weight to any adverse effect on public safety or the operation of the criminal justice system caused by the early release of state prisoners. Judicial response On October 25, 2010, the Supreme Court of California directly repudiated some of Pacheco's more controversial positions in a unanimous decision signed by Chief Justice Ronald M. George. In the court's words: \\"Notwithstanding the considerable preference that the Riverside Superior Court generally afforded the trial of criminal cases over civil cases, the District Attorney of Riverside County consistently has taken the position that a California statutory provision required the Riverside court to extend its efforts even further and make every superior court judge and courtroom – including the specialized superior court departments devoted to hearing and resolving family law, probate, and juvenile matters (as well as the judges from outside the county who had been assigned to that court specifically to assist with the backlog of long-delayed civil trials) – potentially available for the trial of any criminal case that was facing dismissal under the applicable California speedy-trial statutes.\\" The court held that Pacheco's position was meritless. The court then also held that the failure of the state legislature to provide enough judges to Riverside County constituted good cause for dismissing severely delayed criminal cases under the relevant state statute implementing the constitutional right to a speedy trial.People v. Engram, 50 Cal. 4th 1131 (2010). 2010 Election Pacheco was defeated on June 8, 2010, in his bid for reelection as District Attorney by Riverside County Superior Court Judge Paul Zellerbach.http://www.voteinfo.net/eresults/56/Election%20Result.htm After the election, Pacheco said in a statement to the Press Enterprise, \\"It has been my honor to serve the citizens of Riverside County in a variety of capacities for many years. I look forward to my entrance into private life.\\" Richard K. DeAtley. Pacheco: Looking forward to private life. The Press Enterprise. June 10, 2010. According to the Daily Journal, Pacheco was honored for \\"standing by his convictions even if it meant ruffling the feathers of the local legal community. He received heat from judges who said his tough stance against most pre-trial plea-bargaining pushed too many cases onto the court's packed calendar. Pacheco refused to bend, vowing not to 'surrender justice' to expediency or cave 'in the face of criticism.'\\" He quickly became a defense attorney and began defending individuals accused of crime. Top lawyer On September 18, 2007, Pacheco was named one of California's Top 100 Lawyers by the Los Angeles and San Francisco Daily Journals. It was The Daily Journal Corporation's tenth anniversary honoring California's most influential lawyers. During his legal career, Pacheco has tried well over 100 cases to verdict and has not lost a trial since 1986, shortly after he became an attorney in 1983. After Pacheco left the Riverside County District Attorneys Office and went into private practice and was awarded the highest rating for lawyers: AV Preeminent by Martindale-Hubbell, an independent lawyer evaluation organization. Pacheco has also been selected as a California Super Lawyer for every year since he has been in private practice. Pacheco's current practice areas include: fraud and enforcement issues, commercial and public law litigation, internal investigations, and white collar defense at Theodora Oringher, which he joined in November 2014.

Current legal subdivisions of Portugal do not coincide with the provinces, but several provinces, in their 19th- and 20th-century versions, still correspond to culturally relevant, strongly self-identifying categories. They include: *Alentejo *Algarve *Beira *Douro Litoral *Estremadura *Minho *Ribatejo *Trás- os-Montes The islands of Azores and Madeira were never called \\"provinces\\". History The first provinces, instituted during the Roman occupation of the Iberian peninsula, divided the peninsula into three areas: Tarraconensis, Lusitania and Baetica, established by Roman Emperor Augustus between 27–13 B.C.José António Costa Ferreira (2005), p.21 Emperor Diocletian reordered these territories in the third century, dividing Tarraconesis into three separate territories: Tarraconensis, Carthaginensis and Gallaecia. At that time Tarraconesis included northern Portugal, Gallaecia and Asturias.José António Costa Ferreira (2005), p.22 What would develop into the Kingdom of Portugal, was itself a province of the Kingdom of León. During the Reconquista, the Iberian kingdoms established an administrative system, based on the older Visigothic lines, which were themselves just a carry-over from the Romans. The kingdoms were divided into provinces or counties, headed by a local governors (referred to as a count, duke or prince), who also subdivided the land administratively into smaller parcels, headed by lieutenants.José J.X. Sobral (11 August 2008) The first County of Portugal, or Portucale, was a fiefdom of León, under Alfonso III of León, which was succeeded in the 12th Century by the Second County of Portugal, paving the way for the independent Kingdom of Portugal. Comarcas The six medieval provinces of the Kingdom of Portugal After the 15th Century, the new Kingdom of Portugal was divided into six great administrative units, referred to as comarcas. From north to south, they were: * Comarca of Trás-os-Montes – delimited in the west by the Tâmega River and south by the Douro River; * Comarca of Entre-Douro-e-Minho – delimited in the south by the Douro River and east by the Tâmega River; * Comarca of Beira – initially an extense band within the interior of the country, between the Douro River and the Tagus River, in the 16th century it was expanded to the coast, to include the areas of Estremadura; * Comarca of Estremadura – initial a coastal area, between Douro and Tagus Rivers, in the 16th century, the northern border was limited to south of the Mondego River, while its southern limit expanded towards the Tagus, encompassing the peninsula of Setúbal; * Comarca of Entre-Tejo-e-Odiana – delimited to the north by the Tagus River and south by the Serra do Caldeirão; * Kingdom of the Algarve – includes the southern coast until the Serra do Caldeirão. The comarca of Entre-Tejo-e-Odiana would later be renamed as Comarca of Alentejo, while by the late 16th Century, the comarcas would start to be referred to as províncias (). Each comarca was headed by an administrative and judicial magistrate, which represented Royal power in each jurisdiction of the country. These magistrates were, initially, called tenents (), later meirinhos-mores and finally, corregedores. These six comarcas, with some changes, would be maintained as the principal administrative division of country until the 19th century. Provinces Around the 17th Century, the provinces were subdivided into individual comarcas or correições (), with their own corregedor (), and the provinces, as an administrative and civic role, began to be used as a statistical unit. Meanwhile, at the same time that its administrative role ceased, the Kingdom instituted a system of governadores das armas (), whose jurisdiction coincided with the provincial territories. This division between military and civic authorities were maintained until the administrative reforms of 1832. Until the end of the 18th century, feudal territories of the clergy or nobility, were referred to as ouvidorias, whose function was similar to the comarca, but which were governed/administered by nominated feudal regents. In 1790, these ouvidorias were transformed into comarcas, with corregedores nominated directly by the Crown. By 1801, the provinces included the following administrative divisions: * Province of Entre-Douro-e-Minho – Valença, Viana, Braga, Barcelos, Guimarães, Porto, Penafiel; * Province of Trás-os-Montes – Bragança, Miranda, Moncorvo, Vila Real; * Province of Beira – Feira, Aveiro, Lamego, Trancoso, Pinhel, Guarda, Linhares, Viseu, Castelo Branco, Arganil, Coimbra, Leiria, Ourém, Cinco Vilas (Chão de Couce), Tomar; * Province of Estremadura – Santarém, Alcobaça, Alenquer, Torres Vedras, Ribatejo (Vila Franca de Xira), Lisboa, Setúbal; * Province of Alentejo – Crato, Portalegre, Vila Viçosa, Avis, Elvas, Évora, Beja, Ourique; * Kingdom of the Algarve – Lagos, Faro, Tavira; In parallel with these comarcas (the administrative and judicial regions), the provinces began to be subdivided into almoxarifados, () and emprovedorias (), in order to manage imports/exports and finances, as well as health and social issues, respectively. Similarly, in 1758, the Partido do Porto, a military division, under the responsibility of the military governor was instituted to include areas of the Provinces of Entre-Douro-e-Minho and Beira in order to connect these provinces. Prefectures After the Liberal Revolution of 1820, there were many proposals to reform the administrative divisions of the country. But, due to Miguelist counter-revolutions, these reforms were delayed. In 1832, the Liberal government-in-exile in the Azores, decreed the establishment of a new system for Portugal, which would approximate the already existing Provinces of Portugal. In actuality, one new province was established Douro, based on the territory of Partido do Porto, and which began to function with all the rights and privileges. In addition, the Provinces would begin to function throughout the national territory, including the archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira, as well as the overseas territories (the Portuguese colonies in Africa, India and Southeast Asia). In comparison with the period before the 17th century, the Provinces of 1832, or prefeituras (), began to operate as administrative units, led by a prefeito () who was a representative of the central government. These prefects were assisted by a junta geral, that acted as an organ of the local government, elected by the citizens of the province. The provinces continued to be divided into comarcas or subprefeituras (), which functioned as an area of jurisdiction of sub- prefects, who represented the prefect. Parallel with this system, the territory is divided into concelhos (), each led by a provedor (or representative of the prefect) and assisted by the câmara municipal ( or municipal council), which were elected by its citizens. These reforms resulted in the extinction of a number of smaller municipalities (due to lack of population or finances). The elimination of these municipalities were complemented by the appearance of the administrative parish, a subdivision of the latter, which was administered by the comissário de paróquia (), and assisted by the junta de paróquia (). The eight prefectures (provinces) were: * Prefecture of Minho – Ponte de Lima, Monção, Braga, Barcelos, Guimarães * Prefecture of Trás-os-Montes – Bragança, Chaves, Moncorvo, Vila Real * Prefecture of Douro – Porto, Penafiel, Feira, Aveiro * Prefecture of Beira Alta – Viseu, Lamego, Trancoso, Guarda * Prefecture of Beira Baixa – Coimbra, Castelo Branco, Seia, Tomar, Leiria * Prefecture of Estremadura – Santarém, Alenquer, Torres Vedras, Lisboa * Prefecture of Alentejo – Setúbal, Portalegre, Elvas, Beja, Évora, Beja, Ourique * Prefecture of Algarve – Lagos, Faro, Tavira Meanwhile, each of the archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores were constituted as individual provinces: Prefecture of Madeira and the Prefecture of the Azores (which was itself subdivided into Angra and Ponta Delgada sub-prefectures, known as Prefecture Ocidental and Oriental in 1833). In addition the colonies were reorganized into provinces of Cabo Verde and Guiné, Angola, Mozambique, Índia, São Tomé and Príncipe and Macau and Timor, each with their own prefect and junta geral, equivalent to the national division of provinces. The 1832 system lasted a short time, and were replaced by the 1835 reforms heralded by the Liberal victory of 1834. The prefectures and junta gerais of the provinces were abolished, the comarcas/sub-prefectures were transformed into districts, while the sub-prefectures were retooled as governadores civis, assisted by a district junta geral. The debate over the importance of provinces only arose from fears that there would be an excessive concentration of power in the hands of governmental officers (). The adoption of the 17 districts (1835) instead of eight provinces was an attempt to dissolve such power.Luís Silveira (May 2000) The older provedores begin to act as the municipal administrators, and parish commissioners become regedores (removing the ecclesiastical reference from their use). The provinces continue to appear in the lexicon, but only as a grouping of districts, without any administrative or military significance, and like 1832, they continued to function as a statistical and referential units of geography.  New Provinces  11 provinces established 1936 The Estado Novo adopted, from its beginning, a policy of regionalisation of the country, which was written into the 1933 Constitution, creating new provinces, within an executive body, the juntas de provincia () and a deliberative body, the conselhos provinciais (). Created in 1936, the new provinces did not correspond to the traditional comarcas or provinícias. The new territories were based on studies made by Amorim Girão, a geographer, who divided continental Portugal into 13 \\"regiões naturais\\" ().Lourdes Poeira (2011) The provinces were: *Algarve – which included the totality of the district of Faro; *Alto Alentejo – including Évora and Portalegre Districts (except the municipality of Ponte de Sor); *Baixo Alentejo – which included Beja District and the southern half of Setúbal District; *Beira Alta – the \\"natural regions\\" of Beira Alta and Beira Transmontana, that included Guarda District (except for the municipality of Vila Nova de Foz Côa), Viseu District (except for the municipalities of Cinfães, Resende, Armamar, Lamego, São João da Pesqueira and Tabuaço), and the municipalities of Oliveira do Hospital and Tábua (in Coimbra District); *Beira Baixa – that included Castelo Branco District, the municipality of Mação (in Santarém District) and the municipality of Pampilhosa da Serra (in the district of Coimbra); *Beira Litoral – in the south containing parts of Beira Baixa Province, including Coimbra District (except for the municipalities of Pampilhosa da Serra, Oliveira do Hospital and Tábua), the northern half of Leiria District, Aveiro District (except for the municipalities of Arouca, Castelo de Paiva, Espinho and Santa Maria da Feira) and the municipality of Ourém (in Santarém District); *Douro Litoral – including Porto District, the municipalities of Arouca, Castelo de Paiva, Espinho and Santa Maria da Feira (in Aveiro District), and the municipalities of Cinfães and Resende (in Viseu District); *Estremadura – Lisboa District, that included most of Lisbon, except for the municipalities of Azambuja and Vila Franca de Xira, the northern half or Setúbal District, and the southern half of Leiria District; *Minho – that included Braga District and Viana do Castelo District; *Ribatejo – the just the municipalities of Azambuja and Vila Franca de Xira (in Lisboa District); the municipalities of Ourém and Mação (in Santarém District) and just Ponte de Sôr Municipality (in Portalegre District); *Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro – the natural regions of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro, that included Vila Real District, Bragança District, the municipality of Vila Nova de Foz Côa (in Guarda District) and the municipalities of Armamar, Lamego, São João da Pesqueira and Tabuaço (in the district of Viseu). These eleven provinces corresponded each to one of the natural regions developed by Amorim Girão, with two exceptions: the natural regions of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro and the natural regions of Beira Alta and Beira Transmontana were united respectively into the Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro Province and the Beira Alta Province. In comparison with the 1835 provinces, the limits of these new provinces did not correspond with the district borders, which were maintained under the jurisdiction of the civil governors. In 1959, as local governments, the provinces were extinguished. They were only referred to as regional references, while the districts, once again, became the local reference, the juntas distritais and conselhos distritais inheriting the functions of the former provinces.

He was from the influential Bal'ami family.  Biography  The Tarikh-i Bal'ami, a Persian translation of al-Tabari's History of the Prophets and Kings by Muhammad Bal'ami. He was born in Lashjerd in the district of Merv, then part of the Samanid Empire. He was the son of Abu'l-Fadl al-Bal'ami (also called Bal'ami-i Buzurg; \\"Bal'ami the Elder\\"). Muhammad Bal'ami was appointed vizier during the late reign of Abd al-Malik I (r. 954-961) and kept holding the office under Abd al-Malik's successor Mansur I (r. 961-976). According to Gardizi, Bal'ami died in March 974 while serving in office, but according to the Persian historian al-Utbi, he was later from removed the vizierate office, and was reappointed later as the vizier of Nuh II (r. 976-997), but chose to retire in 992, dying in an unknown date before 997.  Work  Bal'ami most famous work is Tarikhnama, a historical text that spans a period beginning with the dawn of creation through to the Islamic age. The book was translated into Turkish and Arabic and remained in circulation for a thousand years. It is among the most influential books of Islamic historical literature and contains supplementary material, some of which is found nowhere else. Though Bal'ami claims the Tarikhnama is a translation of al-Tabari's History of the Prophets and Kings, it is actually an independent work. Bal'ami himself states several times in the book that he has corrected al-Tabari's version. Contrary to al-Tabari, Bal'ami's version is presented from a Persian (mainly Khorasanian) point of view. Having been written in 963, the Tarikh-i Bal'ami is the oldest New Persian prose work after the preface of the Shahnama-yi Abu Mansuri by Abu Mansur Muhammad. The 12th-century poet Nizami Aruzi makes mention of a book composed by Bal'ami named Tawqi'at, and two lines by Bal'ami are cited in the Farhang-e Jahangiri by Jamal al-Din Hosayn Enju Shirazi. However, it is not known if this refers to Bal'ami or his father, Bal'ami the Elder.

Baxley, based on the novel Sudden Fury: A True Story of Adoption and Murder by Leslie Walker, which itself is based on a true story. Plot The film begins with an unknown person hiding an axe covered with blood in the woods. It then focuses on Brian Hannigan, a teenager who contacts the police after the death of his adoptive parents, a double homicide. The investigators immediately see Brian as a suspect, because he was in the house when the murders occurred, is thought to have been too calm considering the circumstances, while also claiming to have heard nothing during the night his parents were murdered. Chris Hannigan, Brian's 7-year-old adoptive brother, tells the police that he saw his other adoptive brother, 17-year-old Daniel, an aggressive patient at a mental hospital, walking away from the house only seconds after the tragedy. Although Daniel denies having been at the house around the time of the murder, he becomes the prime suspect. Tom Kelley is an attorney who believes in the sons' innocence and starts to collect information himself. Brian tells him that he was adopted at age six, shortly before Daniel was adopted as well. He reveals that although they seemed to be the perfect family, their parents were abusive towards Daniel because he was always getting into trouble. When blood is found on Brian's shoes, the court orders him to be separated from his brothers. He is taken into the Kelley home, much to the fear of Tom's wife Liz. Brian admits that he was always too afraid to speak his mind and describes a conversation between his adoptive mother Maureen and her best friend Barbara, in which Maureen expressed her anger when things do not go the way she wants them to, referring to Daniel's behavior. Brian describes that Daniel came to him later that day, expressing the hatred he feels towards his parents. He was kicked out of the house shortly after and sent back to foster care. Three months later, Daniel was caught while breaking into a house and ended up in a reform school. Although Maureen became very overprotective of him and her recently adopted son Chris, Brian found a way to secretly contact Daniel. Back in present life, Chris tells the police that the guy walking away from the home after the murder wasn't Daniel, but Brian. Criminal attorney, Ken Pierson, also discovered that according to the phone records from the last three months, a dozen calls were made to Daniel including the night of the murders. Investigators start to think that Brian and Daniel were both responsible for their parents' death. Kelley then meets Barbara, who took Brian to church, and tells him that Brian's birth mother abandoned Brian for days until the state took custody of him putting him into a foster care system like Daniel. Barbara then said that Daniel had five different families and Brian had six. When Kelley tells Brian that the police are going to ask him a lot of questions, he finally reveals what really happened that night. On the evening before the murder, Brian arrived home late after going out with Lisa Kensington, a girl who is known at school for being promiscuous. His parents found out and reacted furiously, blaming him for becoming just like Daniel. Brian then calls up Daniel who tells Brian to leave the house, but Brian refuses fearing that Maureen and Joe will do the same thing to Chris. Later that night he overheard his parents agreeing about sending him away too. Upset and enraged, he stabbed both his parents in the basement with a butcher knife. Maureen was almost able to get away, but he followed her in the backyard and killed her with an axe without noticing that Chris was watching him from his window. After his confession, Brian stated he never told Daniel about this and that he never told anyone what was happening in the house because whenever he spoke up when he was little, he would get moved. Brian is then arrested and Kelley returns home disappointed. In the epilogue, it is stated that Brian served eight years in the Patuxent Institution in Maryland and that Daniel remained having trouble with the law several times and is sent to prison and that Chris got adopted by a loving family.

She works for the Daily Mail and several of her articles have provoked widespread criticism, such as an article about Stephen Gately that disputed his official cause of death and linked his death to his sexuality. Career Moir currently works for the Daily Mail, having previously worked for The Daily Telegraph and The Observer newspapers. While at The Daily Telegraph she wrote the restaurant column \\"Are You Ready To Order?\\". Moir has won several newspaper awards including the Society of Women Writers' \\"Lynda Lee-Potter award\\" for the outstanding woman journalist of the year, the British Press Awards 'Interviewer of the Year', and What The Papers Say Feature Writer of the Year. Stephen Gately article In October 2009, Moir wrote an article about Boyzone singer Stephen Gately's death, arguing that his death was not of natural causes, despite this being the conclusion of the coroner's report, and linking his death to his sexuality and same-sex civil partnership. The article was published in the Daily Mail six days after the singer's death, before his funeral. The article provoked much criticism, with Guardian columnist Charlie Brooker, for example, describing her article as \\"a gratuitous piece of gay- bashing\\" and urging readers to contact the Press Complaints Commission, albeit somewhat ironically. After receiving a record number of complaints, the PCC announced that it would investigate. On 6 November 2009, Moir was awarded the Stonewall Bigot of the Year Award jointly with Father John Owen. On 17 February 2010, the Press Complaints Commission, whose chairman at the time was Paul Dacre, the editor of the Daily Mail, confirmed that although it was \\"uncomfortable with the tenor of the columnist's remarks\\", it would not uphold the complaints made. The Crown Prosecution Service also concluded that there was insufficient evidence that the article had breached the law.The Guardian, 18 February 2010 In an interview on the BBC Radio's Today programme, PCC chairwoman Baroness Buscombe said the commission found the article \\"in many areas extremely distasteful\\" but that the Daily Mail had escaped censure because it \\"just failed to cross the line\\". Later incidents On 30 July 2012, Moir made headlines in the Netherlands when she called Dutch cyclist Marianne Vos \\"some bitch from Holland\\" after she defeated Lizzy Armitstead in the Olympic Women's road race and won the gold medal. On 23 April 2013, Moir accused Welsh mezzo-soprano singer Katherine Jenkins of being \\"fame-hungry\\" when she ran the London Marathon whilst wearing make-up, designer sunglasses, and diamond earrings. Jenkins tweeted in response, \\"I adore and support other women [and] wish you could do the same.\\"The Times, Wednesday 24 April 2013 Katy Brand in The Daily Telegraph reported that Jenkins' comments about Moir's article had been \\"retweeted hundreds, even thousands of times.\\"Katy Brand \\"Katherine Jenkins v Jan Moir: Twitter wins the first round\\", Daily Telegraph, 24 April 2013 References Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century women writers Category:Daily Mail journalists Category:Date of birth missing (living people) Category:English journalists Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Jan Moir"},{"id":"24713133","text":"Resource Oriented Computing (ROC) is a simple abstract computing model used for describing, designing, and implementing software and software systems. The fundamental idea behind ROC is derived from the World Wide Web, Unix, and other sources as well as original research conducted at HP Laboratories. Fundamental concepts Resource-oriented computing describes an abstract computing model. The fundamental idea is that sets of information known as resources are treated as abstracts; that is, a resource is a Platonic concept of the information that is the subject of a computation process. Resources are identified by logical addresses (typically a URI) and processing is defined using compositions and sequences of resource requests. At the physical level, a ROC system processes resource-representations, executes transformations and, in so doing, computes new resources. In this respect ROC is no different from any other computational model - computation is performed to collate and reveal new information. The fundamental principles of ROC include: ; Resource : A resource is an abstract set of information. ; Identity: Each resource may be identified by one or more logical identifiers. ; Resolution: A logical identifier may be resolved within an information-context to obtain a physical resource-representation. ; Computation: Computation is the reification of a resource to a physical resource-representation. ; Immutability: Resource representations are immutable. ; Transreption: Transreption (short for transrepresentation) is the isomorphic lossless transformation of one physical resource-representation to another.

There is no legal distinction between a guide rail and a guard rail. Several types of roadway guide rail exist; all are engineered to guide vehicular traffic on roads or bridges. Such systems include W-beam, box beam, cable, and concrete barrier.

The fortress was notable for never being conquered by an army.  History  The fortress complex is dated to medieval Serbia, however the original fort was built by the Byzantine emperor Justinian I, much like Soko Grad in Sokobanja. It was first recorded in 1176 as a fort of Stefan Nemanja. The cross, located at the remains of the upper town During the Ottoman occupation, the town became infamous for the notorious torture, persecution and conversion policy of the local orthodox population. There are documents from 1476 that mention that the administrator Sokol Kemal refortified and expanded the town's walls. For a long time, Sokol was a synonym for the Sultan's invincibility in the region; just like before, the fortress was never taken by an enemy army, getting the nickname Sultan's Bride. It was one of the last bastions of the Turkish dominance in the region, and was one of the last fortifications in Serbia to remain in Ottoman possession. The Ottomans handed the city to Prince Mihailo Obrenović in 1862. In return, the Serbs were asked to demolish Sokol, and many other major fortresses that were returned to the Serbs. Captain Petar Radojlović mined it. The Soko monastery (dedicated to St. Nicholas) was built at the foot of the town in 1994. In 2000, a large 13,6 metre cross was put on the highest point of Soko Grad with a helicopter of the Army of FR Yugoslavia (SCG).http://arhiva.glas- javnosti.rs/arhiva/2000/03/26/srpski/R00032502.shtm  Characteristics  Sokol is built on tall and steep rock. The fortification system consists of the citadel - the upper town. The citadel itself consists of two fortified wholes. On the tallest ridge, there is an irregular shaped wall built partly around the rock, with two towers. One tower was protruded on the south side, and the other - main tower was facing the lower town (where the monastery is today). Under this tower, there is a remain of a water cistern. The entire side of the cliff under the main tower was walled by a 35–40 meters tall walls. In the lower part of the citadel there was one rectangle-based tower, which was the access point to the upper part of upper Soko. Under this gate tower, there were two more similar towers, facing the lower town. Inside the lower part of upper town, there are still visible traces of more fortification objects.

Only one was built, flying and crashing in late 1927. The similar Latécoère 32 was its immediate successor. Design and development The Latécoère 23 was a development of the Latécoère 21, the latter Latécoère's first flying boat to leave the water. It kept the same general arrangement, a parasol winged machine with a centrally mounted push- pull pair of engines and sponsons for stability on the water. Its wing, like that of the earlier aircraft was very rectangular and of mixed wood and metal construction. The span was increased by 27% and the wing area by about the same. The sharply cropped wingtips of the Latécoère 21 were replaced by bevelled ends of decreasing thickness. The Latécoère 23 carried full span ailerons in three sections per wing, fitted with trim tabs. The wings were not attached directly to the fuselage, but to the sponsons: on each side a parallel pair of streamlined struts leaned outwards from near the tip of the sponson to mid-wing, and a second pair ran inwards to the wing centreline below the engines. On the Latécoère 21 the engines were mounted on the chord line, but the two 500 hp (373 kW) Farman 12 Wes of the later aircraft were mounted on the upper surface of the wing. Propellers were four bladed and wooden. The fuselage of the Latécoère 23 was 1.30 m (2 ft) shorter than that of its predecessor and the major hydrodynamic alteration was the inclusion of two steps rather than one. It was built of wood. The broad sponsons of airfoil section and almost rectangular plan were also mostly made of wood apart from four duralumin longerons. They were set at an appropriate angle of incidence to provide extra lift. There was a mooring position in the nose, an open cockpit for pilot and mechanic. Two internal cabins, one ahead of the cockpit and one aft could each accommodate four passengers. The tail unit of the Latécoère 23 was much cleaner than that of its predecessor, with control surfaces merging smoothly into the lines of tailplane and fin. The former was unbraced and mounted about halfway up the fin, with a large cut-out for rudder movement. Achille Enderlin, Latécoère's test pilot was in charge of trials during the autumn of 1927. These passed without incident, but on 31 December 1927, with Enderlin and four others on board spun in during landing approach, killing everyone. No more Latécoère 23s were built, but by the time of the crash the first examples of its rather similar successor, the Latécoère 32 were in service.

It was most popular in Moravia (especially Brno), Prague and Bratislava Governing body Czechoslovakia was a founder member of FIRA in 1934, and joined the IRB in 1988. Traditionally, Czech rugby has centred on a \\"section of the middle class\\" in and around Prague, which has been fairly small but fairly loyal to the sport.Bath, Richard (ed.) The Complete Book of Rugby (Seven Oaks Ltd, 1997 ) p66 History Moravia in relation to the current regions of the Czech Republic. Rugby union was a moderately popular sport in Czechoslovakia Josef Rössler-Ořovský, who introduced a number of sports in the then Czechoslovakia, among others skiing and tennis, was originally credited with starting rugby as well back in 1895. Rugby Club Bystrc - Historie He went to England and brought back a rugby ball with him. Efforts were made to play the game at the Czech Yacht Club, but a public struggle ensued, and rugby subsequently never really caught on. Rugby union was only properly introduced to the country by the writer Ondřej Sekora, when he returned from living in France in 1926, with a rugby ball and set of rules; he also coined Czech language rugby terminology.Richards p129 Brno, the Moravian capital is considered the cradle of rugby in Czechoslovakia, and is where the first match took place, between SK Moravská Slávie and AFK Žižka Brno, with the former winning 31–17. Both of these teams were trained by Sekora. :\\"Much to everyone's surprise, Eastern Bloc countries are among the game's vigorous participants, seemingly oblivious to rugby's capitalist class-ridden origins... Rumania, Poland and Czechoslovakia are members of the Federation Internationale de Rugby Amateur, the governing body for those countries not in the IB.\\"Hopkins, John (ed) Rugby (1979 ), p8 1950s 1970s, 1980s and 1990s Czechoslovakia was not invited to the first Rugby World Cup in 1987, and did not qualify for the second in 1991. Rugby union like many other sports, was long to be connected in the public mind with the less savoury aspects of Communism: :\\"In fact, since the end of the Second World War, the East European (and world communist) sports system was dominated by clubs of the security forces (often in Eastern Europe bearing the Soviet name Dinamo) and the armed forces. Most sports heroes, therefore, have officially been soldiers or police officers, guardians of public order and role models for a disciplined, obedient and patriotic citizenry. So to many people, élite sport was identified with paramilitary coercion.\\"ed. Brown, Archie; Kaser, Michael & Smith, Gerald S.

Meurisse was noted for the elegance of his acting style, and for his versatility. He was equally able to play comedic and serious dramatic roles. His screen roles ranged from the droll and drily humorous to the menacing and disturbing. His most celebrated role was that of the sadistic and vindictive headmaster in the 1955 film Les Diaboliques.  Early life and career  Meurisse was born in Dunkirk, on the north-east coast of France. He grew up on the island of Corsica, to where his bank manager father had been transferred when Meurisse was a small child. After leaving school, Meurisse moved to Aix-en-Provence, where he became a solicitor's clerk. But his passion was for the stage, and he acquired evening work in the chorus of music hall revues. In 1936, Meurisse moved to Paris, where he found work in musical theatres and nightclubs, and appeared with performers such as Marie Dubas. He specialised in taking cheerful, upbeat songs and singing them in a comically downbeat, lugubrious fashion. In 1939, Meurisse met singer Edith Piaf, and the two became lovers for two years. Piaf, however, did not see a future for Meurisse as a singer, and encouraged him to try acting instead.Biography at Du Temps des cerises (in French) Film career  Meurisse first performed in film in Vingt-quatre heures de perm, which was filmed in 1940 but not released until 1945. Ne bougez plus (1941) was the first of his films to be released. Thereafter he was in steady demand as an actor (in 1948, for example, he was credited in seven films). Meurisse played a wide range of roles, from gangsters (Macadam, Impasse des Deux-Anges) and policemen (Inspecteur Sergil, Le Dessous des cartes), to comedy (the Monocle films) and historical (La Castiglione, L'Affaire des poisons). The quality of the films was varied, but Meurisse's versatility brought him recognition, with his performance often considered the best part of an otherwise mediocre effort.Paul Meurisse, humour et élégance, Andre Pousse (in French) Meurisse's most famous role was that of Michel Delasalle in Henri-Georges Clouzot's 1955 thriller Les Diaboliques, with Simone Signoret and Véra Clouzot. In a thoroughly unsympathetic part, Meurisse was compelling. The film, with its dark, claustrophobic atmosphere and celebrated twist ending, became an international success. It was among the earliest foreign-language films to be widely distributed in English-speaking markets and is the film for which Meurisse is best known.[http://filmsdefrance.com/FDF_Les_diaboliques_rev.html Les Diaboliques, at filmsdefrance.com Other of his notable films include Julien Duvivier's inquisitorial and oppressive Marie-Octobre (1959), Jean Renoir's Le Dejeuner sur l'herbe (1959), Clouzot's courtroom drama La Vérité (1960) and Melville's crime thriller Le deuxième souffle (1966). Meurisse made three appearances as Commandant Théobald Dromard, aka \\"The Monocle\\", in the Eurospy comedies Le monocle noir (1961), L'oeil du monocle (1962), and Le monocle rit jaune (1964). The 1969 film L'Armée des ombres, in which Meurisse had a leading role, was released in 2006 on DVD, under the title Army of Shadows, in the UK and US, to critical acclaim.  Stage career  Meurisse appeared in many stage productions, in plays by both contemporary French authors such as Marcel Achard and Jean Anouilh to classical English playwrights Shakespeare and George Bernard Shaw. In the mid-1950s he was a sociétaire of the Comédie- Française.  Private life  His grave. Meurisse married three times: to Michèle Alfa (1942, divorced); Micheline Cheirel (1951, divorced; she was previously married to British actor John Loder); and Micheline Gary (1960 to his death).  Death  Meurisse suffered from asthma for much of his life. He was taken ill following a performance at the Théâtre Hébertot in Paris. He died at age 66 on 19 January 1979 of an asthma-related heart attack.  Filmography  * 1941: Ne bougez plus (dir. Pierre Caron) - Hector * 1941: Montmartre-sur-Seine (dir.

Retrieved on 2009-10-16. because the influential Cambridge University philosophers Bertrand Russell and J. M. E. McTaggart used examples of such changes in their work. Example Last year Mary, who stands five-foot-four, was taller than her five-foot tall, 13-year-old son John; today Mary is shorter than her now five- foot-six, 14-year-old son. Mary has undergone a Cambridge change. The Cambridge change that Mary has undergone consists in the fact that a predicate true of her last year (taller than John) is not true now, and a predicate not true of her last year (shorter than John) is now true; but the change in the predicates’ truth values is not grounded in any change in her height. By contrast, the change in the truth value of last year's and this year's statement about John's height reflects his growth. Some philosophers have proposed that a Cambridge change is a change in an individual's extrinsic or relational properties; genuine changes involve intrinsic ones.

Early life Osvaldo Andrés Cacciatore was born in Buenos Aires in 1924. He enrolled at the School of Military Aviation in 1946 and on September 28, 1951, joined an attempted coup d'état against populist President Juan Perón. The putsch, led by retired General Benjamín Menéndez, was a bid to thwart the upcoming 1951 general elections (in which Perón was re-elected). It quickly failed, however, and Menéndez, Cacciatore and a number of others escaped to neighboring Montevideo, Uruguay, whose government was at odds with Perón's.La Nación: Cacciatore, el militar que cambió la ciudad Cacciatore returned to Argentina and was reinstated into the Air Force. Following a collapse in Church-state relations in Argentina in late 1954, Cacciatore joined a second mutiny against the President, led by Rear Admiral Samuel Toranzo Calderón. On the eve of the planned, June 16, 1955, attack, Toranzo had decided to postpone the move; but unaware of the decision, an Air Force detachment, which included Cacciatore, carried out the brutal bombing of Plaza de Mayo (the public square facing the presidential offices, the Casa Rosada) as scheduled, and during a Peronist rally. Piloting one of the Gloster Meteor jets deployed for the raid, Cacciatore was among the pilots whose attack took over 300 civilian lives, after which the pilots flew to safety in Uruguay.Clarín: Scheina, Robert. Latin America's Wars. Brassey's, 2003. An Army revolt led by General Eduardo Lonardi in September 1955 ultimately succeeded in deposing Perón, and following the September 23 installation of the Revolución Libertadora regime, Cacciatore returned. An uneventful career in subsequent years was capped by his appointment in 1972 as Acting Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff by President Alejandro Lanusse, whose military regime was in its final days. Elections called by Lanusse for March 1973, would include, for the first time since Perón's ouster, a lifting of the ban on Peronism, and Cacciatore chaired the government delegation to negotiate terms for Perón's preliminary November 17, 1972, Argentine visit.Potash, Robert. The Army and Politics in Argentina. Stanford University Press, 1996. The return of Peronism to power in 1973 exacerbated political frictions in Argentina, however, and was ultimately followed by a March 1976 coup and the installation of the National Reorganization Process, the last Argentine dictatorship. Replacing nearly all elected officials, the new regime named Cacciatore to the post of Mayor of Buenos Aires, whose economy is nearly a fourth of the nation's total. Mayor of Buenos Aires The planned network of freeways approved by Cacciatore in 1976 - five were ultimately built. Plaza Houssay, along Córdoba Avenue, was one of numerous such public squares developed or remodeled during Cacciatore's tenure. At the helm of what was then still South America's largest city, Cacciatore inherited an agenda topped by wave of political violence and concerns over readiness for the 1978 FIFA World Cup, for which two football stadia in the Buenos Aires (José Amalfitani Stadium and River Plate) were to be made available as part of the schedule of matches. The city, however, suffered from a number of serious logistical problems, as well: the rapid growth in automobile traffic since the 1950s, which by 1976 totaled 1.5 million vehicles daily, had not been met by appropriate infrastructure improvements,AUSA: Historia ' and the unrelenting flow of migrants from both the less developed Argentine north and neighboring countries such as Bolivia and Paraguay had resulted in the formation of over 30 villas miseria (shantytowns, with varying levels of squalor, illegally built on empty lots); these latter were, by 1976, believed to be home to around 200,000 people (6% of the city's population).Pagina/12: Militares vs. villeros The mayor moved quickly, and appointed a local civil engineer, Dr. Guillermo Laura, to design a new city transport master plan. Dr. Laura's ambitious project, originally published in 1970, called for the eventual construction of a network of nine city freeways (two were already in use), which would total 74 km (46 mi). Preparation for the plan resulted in the expropriation and demolition of over 3,000 homes during 1977-78, and construction on the first two freeways began in November 1978. Totaling 14 km (9 mi) and opened in December 1980, they were granted to the Spanish-Argentine AUSA consortium as toll roads with a concession until 2006. Slum clearance was addressed with the mayor's July 13, 1977, ordinance, which mandated the eradication of all shantytowns, as well as of public housing for around 16,000 people, whose inhabitants would be relocated to the Greater Buenos Aires area (mainly La Matanza and Esteban Echeverría Counties, west of the city). Following a census of these communities and a spate of restrictions, such as those on new edifications, on the dwellings' sale, and on cottage industry therein, the Department of Internal Vigilance began their demolition; as many slum inhabitants were unwilling to relocate, these were often violent and resulted in numerous injuries and deaths. These incidents and the Housing Commission's own stipulation that slum clearance could only legally occur after suitable housing had been arranged for those affected helped result in a December 1979 injunction against further removals by a court of appeals, curbing the worst abuses.Schuurman, Franz Johan. Urban Social Movements in the 3rd World. Taylor & Francis, 1989. The 1980 Census revealed that the city's slums were home to no more than 30,000 people, prompting Cacciatore's Housing Commissioner (and successor as mayor), Guillermo del Cioppo, to declare that living in Buenos Aires is not for just anyone, but for those who deserve it and are willing to accept life in a proper community - a better city for the best people. These controversial accomplishments were complemented by the opening 64 public schools and of numerous public parks, as well as by the successful World Cup event (won by Argentina) and the closure of the city's tens of thousands of apartment building incinerators, whose noxious disposal of the city's 3,000 daily tons of refuse was replaced by curbside pickup service operated by Manliba, a consortium between Waste Management, Inc. and local businessman Francisco Macri.Clarín: Un contrato enorme y codiciado Cacciatore's dynamic record was clouded, however, by the dictatorship's own Dirty War against dissidents and its resulting 30,000 deaths and disappearances (most of which were known by the regime to be non-violent dissidents, and for which 15 detention centers were opened in Buenos Aires, alone),Andersen, Martin.

The two completed freeways, budgeted at US$222 million, cost nearly a billion dollars, and their less-than-projected use by toll-paying motorists helped lead to the suspension of work on the other five in 1981; one planned freeway was cancelled only after the demolition of a several block-long swath in a residential area, and its effects on the residential Saavedra neighborhood were only remedied in the late 1990s (three other freeways were ultimately completed).La Nación: La autopista que no fue Cacciatore's deal with Manliba also came under fire for its cost and for the consortium's failure to adequately maintain new landfills.

The mayor handed over reins of the city to Housing Commissioner Guillermo del Cioppo on April 1, 1982, and the latter served as caretaker until elections in late 1983. Cacciatore became a partner in Juncadella, an armored transport firm, and was a defendant in numerous lawsuits stemming from the lucrative deals he sponsored as mayor. Following the return of democracy in 1983, many of the slum-dwellers expelled by Cacciatore returned. This in part prompted him to enter politics as a candidate for Congress on the conservative UCeDé ticket in 1993 and for a seat in the Buenos Aires City Legislature in 1997, though he was unsuccessful both times. He died in Buenos Aires on July 28, 2007, at age 83.

Development  From 1946 the IS (Gliding Institute) started work on designing gliders to rebuild the shattered by the war Polish gliding movement. Four types were required: *1. School (IS-3 ABC) *2. Transition (IS-A Salamandra) *3. Training and intermediate performance (IS-2 Mucha) *4. High performance / advanced (IS-1 Sęp) To fulfil the 'School' requirement the IS-3 ABC primary glider was designed by Rudolf Matz and Roman Zatwarnicki, and built at the workshops in Bielsko. Using the sole remaining W.W.S.1 Salamandra as a starting point, the IS-3 ABC emerged looking similar to most primary gliders, with a high set rectangular low aspect ratio wing, wire-braced to an open structure wire- braced fuselage, which did nothing more than connect the seat, skid and tail unit to the wings. The IS-3 ABC prototype first flew on New Year's Eve of 1948 by Peter Mynarski and after successful trials, a production commenced as the IS-3 ABC-bis. Further improvements resulted in the IS-3 ABC-ter, with a cabin and windscreen for the pilot. Last and most numerous variant was ABC-A of 1955, produced in 1956-57. 256 of all variants were manufactured in workshops in Bielsko (of IS, later SZD), Krosno and Lubawka (according to other publications, 280, including 74 bis, 30 ter and 176 ABabiejczuk, Janusz and Grzegorzewski, Jerzy. Polski Przemysł Lotniczy 1945-1973 (in Polish). Warsaw: Wydawnictwo MON, 1974. No ISBN, p. 118). Polish instructors were also instrumental in boosting the gliding movement in the People's Republic of China, providing instruction and advice with the 50 IS-3 ABC A's exported there. This variant was modified with less dihedral (1°),IS-3 ABC to allow the generally shorter Chinese students to hold the wings level for take-off. After flight trials in Poland it was confirmed that the it did not appreciably affect the handling. The Chinese also manufactured these gliders on the licence. The IS-3 ABC series was in use at Polish state gliding clubs up to 1961, when the dual training syllabus was finally introduced. Many of the IS-3 primary gliders were dispersed to schools and clubs for use as training aids, some of which survive as exhibits in museums today.  Variants  * IS-3 ABC – The sole prototype aircraft without folding wings. * IS-3 ABC bis – production aircraft with reduced wing incidence, increased aileron movement and with folding wings and tail-unit (24 made in IS and 50 in Lubawka). * IS-3 ABC ter – version equipped with a removable cockpit nacelle and windscreen as well as fixed wings and tail-unit (30 made in Lubawka) * IS-3 ABC-A – last production version, with less wing dihedral, produced in 1956-57 (most in Krosno).

Jura: Island of Deer (Birlinn, 2001) The house was rented by the essayist and novelist George Orwell (Eric Arthur Blair), who lived there intermittently from 1946 until January 1949; he completed the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four at Barnhill. According to a BBC report, he was spending months on the island \\"to escape the daily grind of journalism and to find a clean environment which doctors thought would help him recover from a dangerous bout of tuberculosis\\". Orwell left Jura in January 1949 to get treatment at a sanatorium at Cranham, Gloucestershire and never returned to the island.  After 1950  Since Orwell's death in 1950, Barnhill has been a site of interest for many who are familiar with the life and writing of George Orwell. The cottage is still owned by the family that rented it to Orwell.

Circus Roncalli is a German circus founded in 1976 by and André Heller. According to Bernhard Paul, the name was inspired by a film script of his fellow Austrian , \\"Sarah Roncalli, Tochter des Mondes\\" (\\"Sarah Roncalli, daughter of the moon\\", sometimes also cited as \\"widow of the moon\\"). The reminiscence to the popular Pope John XXIII (1881–1963), whose legal name was Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, served as a key to the success. History The first performance of the circus was on 18 May 1976 on the Hofgartenwiese in Bonn, and the tour finished on 16 August 1976 in Munich. After the first season, Paul and Heller disagreed about the concept and rights, so that at a future performance on 4 June 1980 in Cologne, Bernhard Paul directed the circus on his own. (In September 1976 there were already performances without Heller in Vienna, but the show closed after a short run owing to a dwindling audience.) Since then, the circus has toured in Germany and abroad, including the first appearance of a West German circus in the Soviet Union in 1986. Model-turned-photographer Ellen von Unwerth worked as an assistant at Circus Roncalli in Munich for around a month when she was eighteen years old. Winter quarters The winter quarters of the circus have been at Neurather Weg 7 in Mülheim, Cologne since 1984. The building belonged to Circus Williams previously, and was rebuilt to accommodate Circus Roncalli, and then was officially opened on 27 April 1986. Roncalli Museum Bernhard Paul owns one of the largest circus collections in Europe, including old costumes, circus books and posters, which he plans to display in a museum. Projects Circus Roncalli has taken part in a number of projects: * The \\"Höhner rockin Roncalli Show\\" – Tours with the musical group De Höhner. * \\"Circus meets Classic\\" – Performances by artists based on classical music performed by various symphony orchestras. * Performances with the musical group the Kelly Family in 2003 and 2004 (Phantasie verboten), and in 2005 and 2006 (\\"Music meets Circus – Circus meets Music\\"). * A Christmas circus (Roncalli Weihnachtscircus), which has been held in the Tempodrom in Berlin from December to January since 2004 * The dinner show \\"Witzigmann & Roncalli Bajazzo\\", together with Eckart Witzigmann since autumn 2006 * Historical Christmas market in front of the Hamburg Rathaus.

It coincides with the National Day of Mourning held in Massachusetts. The Alcatraz ceremony has been held annually since 1975 to commemorate the protest event of 1969, where the Alcatraz-Red Power Movement (ARPM) occupied the island. It is organized by the International Indian Treaty Council and American Indian Contemporary Arts. The event is designed to commemorate the survival of Indian tribes following the European colonization of the Americas. Organizers want it to serve in contrast and counter-celebration to the traditional American Thanksgiving in which the Pilgrims shared a meal with the Wampanoag tribe. Background Graffiti still visible in 2010 on Alcatraz Island from the 1975 IAT occupation. In 1969, a number of Native American members of the Alcatraz-Red Power Movement group Indians of All Tribes (IAT) occupied the island of Alcatraz, under the terms of the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie that allocated surplus government land to Native Americans. The occupation lasted for 19 months, from November 20, 1969 to June 11, 1971. They were visited by members of the American Indian Movement (AIM) who, inspired by the occupation, led other protests, the first on Thanksgiving in 1970 when they painted Plymouth Rock red. The latter protest continued as the National Day of Mourning. The US government ended the Alcatraz occupation with force. During the occupation, hundreds of Native Americans joined the movement to speak out for their rights. This was part of a heavy period of Indian activism and protest at a time when the civil rights movement in the United States amongst minorities was at a height. Contemporary observance Every year on the date of the United States Thanksgiving holiday in November, several thousand indigenous people and spectators travel to Alcatraz Island. Groups dance before sunrise, to honor their ancestors, while other groups demonstrate other aspects of their cultures and heritage and speak out for the rights of their people. The celebration is open to the public. A similar sunrise ceremony at Alcatraz Island is also held on Indigenous Peoples' Day.

It was established by Edward Heath in February 1971 but was later disbanded by Margaret Thatcher following the 1983 general election. The CPRS was created in response to The Reorganisation of Central Government white paper published in October 1970. It had four directors over its 12-year lifetime; Lord Rothschild (1971–1974), Sir Kenneth Berrill (1974–1980), Sir Robin Ibbs (1980–1982) and John Sparrow (1982–1983). Three of the Directors worked in the commercial sector; Rothschild was head of research at Shell, Ibbs was a director of Imperial Chemical Industries and Sparrow was a banker at Morgan Grenfell. Berrill had spent twenty years as an academic economist at Cambridge University before working for the Treasury.Tessa Blackstone and William Plowden (1988) Inside The Think Tank – Advising the Cabinet 1971–1983 Preface The unit was always small, intentionally, never being more than 20 in number plus support staff. The average secondment was two years although a small number stayed longer. Its composition was a mix of academic, Whitehall civil servants and business (particularly the oil business, all from Shell or BP)Tessa Blackstone and William Plowden (1988) Inside The Think Tank – Advising the Cabinet 1971–1983 p27 Three of the four Prime Ministers served by the CPRS felt it did a worthwhile job. Edward Heath believed the CPRS was an important part of his government. \\"Their work was invariably thoroughly researched and well presented. I regard the CPRS as one of the best innovations of my years at No. 10. As a group which advised ministers collectively, it helped to maintain the cohesion of the government.\\"Edward Heath (1998) The Course of My Life p316 Harold Wilson had a positive view of the CPRS and he commented in his book The Governance of Britain \\"It was set up by our predecessors but we have found it very valuable and have continued it.\\"Harold Wilson (1976) The Governance of Britain Appendix V p.203 Equally James Callaghan thought well of the unit saying in his autobiography; \\"To my regret, and I believe to her loss, the unit was disbanded by Mrs Thatcher.\\"James Callaghan (1987) Time and Change p.404 Margaret Thatcher had a rather different view of the CPRS by 1983. \\"The CPRS had originally been set up by Ted Heath as a source of long-term policy advice for the Government at a time when there were fewer private think-tanks, fewer special advisers in government and a widespread belief that the great questions of the day could be resolved by specialized technical analysis. But a government with a firm philosophical direction was inevitably a less comfortable environment for a body with a technocratic outlook.\\"Margaret Thatcher (1993) Margaret Thatcher The Downing Street Years p.30 Upon its abolition, some of the functions of the CPRS were transferred to the Downing Street policy unit. The Review of Overseas Representation The most controversial report by the CPRS was The Review of Overseas Representation published in August 1977. The concept of the review was initiated by the CPRS in late 1975 and was taken up by the Foreign Secretary, James Callaghan, who asked for the review to be extended to the BBC and the British Council. Callaghan also asked the CPRS to undertake the review. However, according to Joe Haines (Press Secretary to Prime Minister Harold Wilson) even before the proposals were shown to Callaghan the Foreign Office intervened: \\"the document he eventually saw, and approved, was modified – or doctored – on the way to his desk. The original proposals were not acceptable to senior F.C.O. officials, and the head of the C.P.R.S., Sir Kenneth Berrill, was asked to make deletions before it was put to the Secretary of State. That was agreed. The document placed before Jim Callaghan was not the original one.\\" Joe Haines (1977) The Politics of Power p37 The report was written by June 1977, shown to Ministers and published in August. There had been a mixed response from the Foreign Office during the review, the most notable and possibly most critical came from Sir Nicholas Henderson the Ambassador to France, although Anthony Parsons in Tehran was more supportive of the CPRS's work.Tessa Blackstone and William Plowden (1988) Inside The Think Tank – Advising the Cabinet 1971–1983 Ch. 8 Its conclusions and recommendations were radical and on publication met with a barrage of criticism from supporters of the various organisations being reviewed. There was a debate in the House of Lords in November 1977 with contributions from members with connections to the British Council, the BBC as well as the Foreign Office. A House of Commons Select Committee also investigated the review and published their findings.Tessa Blackstone and William Plowden (1988) Inside The Think Tank – Advising the Cabinet 1971–1983 p168-9 The orchestration of a critical campaign against the Review and the CPRS by the Foreign Office had started before its publication and is indicated by Bernard Donoughue in his diary entry for 7 February 1977: \\"Had lunch with The Economist journalist Richard Leonard – who told me that somebody from the FCO (Foreign and Commonwealth Office) had got the editor (Andrew Knight) of The Economist to 'doctor' an article so it was savagely critical of the (still unfinished!)

Originally called Coffee Creek and located a little to the south of the current downtown, the name was changed some time after the post office was established in 1833 to Calumet, the river to the north. When the Lake Shore and Michigan Railroad came through the area in 1852, the town moved north to the current location and began to develop. The town's name was not changed to Chesterton until after the Civil War. There appears to have been confusion with Calumet, Illinois, further up the track.Porter County Interim Report, Indiana Historic Sites and Structures Inventory; Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana; 1996 The town's location along the railroad helped industry to grow. Soon, there was a cooperage, sawmills, a washing machine factory, and an organ company. Among the better examples of the towns growth are the commercial building on the southwest corner of Broadway and Calumet Rd, and the old Chesterton Tribune Building. Key buildings All structures are historically contributing towards the Historic District Status, unless otherwise noted. An 'O’ rating signifies that the structure had enough historic or architectural significance to be considered for individual listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The 'N’ rating signifies that the structure is above average and may, with further investigation be eligible for an individual listing. The 'C’ or contributing rating signifies that the structure meet the basic inventory qualifications, but fails to meet individual merit, but in combination with other closely placed similar structures warrants inclusion in an historic district. *No. 1. 132–134 North Calumet Road, c. 1905, I.O.O.F Lodge – The International Order of Odd Fellows Lodge was built c. 1905, shortly after the devastating fire of 1902. The local chapter purchased this site in 1910, removed the original wood frame building, and built this brick and stone trimmed building. While of no particular style, the oriel bay, cornice work, and heavy window lintels give the building a modest Neo-Classical Revival influence. Note: This includes , site map, and Accompanying photographs. The building is a rhomboid to fit the irregular block layout of the downtown.. The lodge used the upper floors of the building and rented the ground floor to shopkeepers. The wooden storefront configuration of large windows with wood frames and a recessed entry with wood single light door seems to be the original layout. The central and corner piers of brick banded with stone divide the storefront in halves. The south entry leads to a stairs to the upper floor. Taking advantage of the unusual lot, the storefront wraps around to the north side of the building with a single window to catch the eye of pedestrians up the street. The upper floor is hard fired dark brown face brick. The upper floor windows are one-over-one double hung windows with stone sills and lintels. Over the north half storefront, the second floor has a rectangular oriel window with simple classical ornamentation, and a double window to the front and narrow windows on the sides. The cornice has brick corbels at two points and a table of alternately recessed bricks, creating the impression of dentils. A stone coping caps the parapet, which crow steps down to the west or rear of the building. Datagraphic Printing is housed in the building. Based on map provided in the National Register of Historic Places Registration Application. *No. 2. 130 North Calumet Road or 101 Broadway, c.1895, The Queen Anne commercial building on the southwest corner of Broadway and Calumet Road was built c. 1895. In 1888, Elias Thomas built a brick building here. In 1898, the store was rebuilt by Myron and Harry Smith who operated a general dry goods store called M. Smith and Son. His son Harry operated the store until his death in 1961. Harry's son Richard continued the business until 1973. This building has a flat-iron shape and the entry bay wall and second floor above is chambered. The chambered face of the storefront has double leaf wood doors with a wood transom above. The lintel over the doorway is sentimental arch shaped and has scroll shaped corner blocks supporting it. The brick corner piers flanking the door have stone banding. Steel or iron I-beam lintels with rosettes span the tops of the side storefronts, which have wood framed large windows and transoms. The flank of the building along Calumet Road has a row of small multi-pane windows set high on the wall. Each has a stone sill and sentimental arched, multi-coursed arches top each square headed window. A double row of saw tooth-laid brick link the window arches. On the second floor, full size one-over-one double hungs march along the Calumet Road side, each with a stone sill and sawtooth coursing linking the sills and arches. The arches on the second floor are header multi-coursed with a projecting extrados course forming a hood. The north elevation facing Broadway has a double window on the second floor with a single broad arch over both windows. Decorative balusters with finials stand atop the entrance chambered bay and the end of the building facing Calumet. The bulk of the historic district in on the east side of Calumet Road. The southern end of the district starts across from Indiana Ave. It runs north to the tracks. * No. 3. 193 North Calumet Road, c.1905, The Chesterton Tribune Building is the most southern building and was built c. 1905 after the great fire of 1902. It is considered a Twentieth Century function style, similar to most of the buildings in the district. The Chesterton Tribune commissioned construction of this building in 1904 and it continues to serve as the paper's headquarters. Arthur Bowser first published the paper in 1884 *Images of America, Westchester Township; Westchester Public Library; Arcadia Publishing; Charleston, S.C.; 1999 and he owned the paper when the decision was made to build this structure. It is a two-story brick commercial building. The ground floor storefront has been altered; stucco covers the kick panels and piers. An old-fashioned style simple cloth awning covers the storefront. The original steel or iron I-beam spanning the ground floor remains intact along with the decorative rosettes. The red brick walls rise above the I-beam and three windows puncture the wall, each with dressed stone sills and lintels. Centered over the windows, a stone tablet reads \\"The Chesterton Tribune\\". The elaborate parapet gives the building a slight Romanesque Revival style flavor. First, a beltcourse of sawtooth-laid brick runs across, then a frieze of alternating recessed single bricks. The raised brick corbels dividing the upper parapet into four panels mimic machicolations, with infilling of progressively corbeled courses of brick. J.G. Graessle bought the paper from Bowser in 1923, Warren Canright purchased it in 1928, and held the paper until his death in 1975. His son Warren and grandson David continue to publish the Tribune out of the building. The Tribune is the oldest existing business in Chesterton, and still publishes daily except for Sundays., * No. 4. 139–141 North Calumet Road, 1903, The Smith Block was also built c.1905.[2] The Smith Block was constructed in 1903. The first floor housed various businesses while the Knights of Pythias Lodge used the second floor as their meeting hall from 1903 until 1968. The local Knights of Columbus lodge has occupied the space since 1969. The first floor storefront seems to be a c. 1950 remodeling, utilizing aluminum and glass doors and muntins to hold the large plate glass shop windows. It seems that the recessed central entry configuration was retained from the original storefront design, due to the placement of the structural columns. The storefront end piers of brick and stone are original. The second floor tan face brick walls have an Arts and Crafts feeling, especially in the use of the central Chicago window. The parapet area has three recessed brick panels with stone corner tabs, the center panel has a stone tablet with raised letters spelling \\"SMITH BLOCK\\" in a simple sans-serif typeface. A table of stone corbels runs across above the panels. The rest of the parapet is plain brick. * No. 5. 137A North Calumet Road, c.1905, This building was constructed to replace one of those lost in the 1902 fire. The ground floor has been altered with residential style windows and wood siding. The upper floor has three windows, each having rock-faced stone lintels and sills. The cornice has a few simple flourishes; first comes a belt course of red terra cotta blocks with bulls-eyes cast into them, then a course of cyma reverse-molded brick topped by a rock-faced coping. * No. 6. 137B North Calumet Road, c. 1905, This small story shop was home to a barber shop until the 1960s. The wooden storefront seems to be original, with recessed kick panels below a large wood framed window, and the recessed entrance set to the north with single light wood door. The metal awning is from the 1950s. The face brick walls have two double recessed panels on the parapet and a stone coping. * No. 7. 135 North Calumet Road, c.1900, The Hoham Block is two buildings to the north and is also a c.1905 Twentieth Century Functional style. The Hoham Block is a two-story brick and stone commercial building. In 1903, Bennett Morgan constructed this building as a hardware store. He and his son Robert operated the store until Bennett died in 1974. The double recessed entrance storefront seems to have some original features and others dating from perhaps the 1930s. The iron corner piers are original, the doorways appear to be original, but the metal framing and edging for the shop windows seems to be a Moderne style replacement. The upper floor face brick walls have two bays, one wood double hung window with stone sill and lintel, and an oriel window. The semihexagonal bay has pressed metal kick panels and entablature, both have Classical swag and floral motifs. A stone tablet with raised letters spelling \\"HOHAM BLOCK\\" is centered over the window and oriel. The cornice has a lower sawtooth course of brick, a run of alternately recessed brick, fake machicolations, and a three course corbel table with stone coping. The sides of the building always stood above its neighbors and have several operable windows. Country Loft Crafts occupies this store currently. * No. 8. 133 North Calumet Road, c.1940, this one story shop was once used by neighboring Morgan Hardware. It has a c. 1940 inwardly angled shop front with aluminum and glass central door framed by brick end piers. The parapet wall is plain face brick with dressed stone coping. * No. 9. Non-contributing – 131 North Calumet Road, c.1935, After the 1902 fire, this site lay vacant until 1935, when Walter Baur built this store. The building is covered in wood siding and considered non-contributing. It may still have the original brick detailing beneath the siding * No. 10. 129 North Calumet Road, 1903, A local butcher rebuilt on this site after the 1902 fire, and used this building until the 1940s. In its craft details and original intent, this building is virtually the same as 137 A North Calumet (#5). Only the alterations make it significantly different. * No. 11. 127 North Calumet Road, 1902, Hess Restaurant and Hotel used this building from 1902 until 1920. From 1920 until recent years, Johnson Grocery Store occupied the building. Anton Insurance Company now utilizes this building and the neighboring block at 129 Calumet. 127 is a two-story, three bay commercial block. The first story shop front was remodeled in c.1950. The front is angled inward in a single plane, with two shop windows to the south and a double entry to the north. The kick panel area is brick and the doors and windows are framed in brushed natural metal (likely aluminum). The second floor has three windows with stone sills and lintels. The cornice has false machicolations and corbeled brick courses. * No. 12. 125 North Calumet Road, 1903, The same craftsman responsible for the masonry work on 129 and 137 Calumet may have built the cornice treatment for 125, since the same bulls-eye terra cotta block and cyma-reversa molded brick work links all three buildings visually. The building at 125 is different from the other two in that it is only a one- story building. The owners of Flannery's Tavern remodeled the storefront significantly in the 1940s or 50s with large banks of glass block, fixed picture windows and a metal awning. The upper parapet section of brick has been painted, and the neon sign is likely from the 1950s. The cornice has been painted also. A saloon stood here as early as the 1880s. After the fire of 1902, the owners rebuilt a saloon on this site. From 1910 to 1915, Jeffrey's Motion Pictures (only silent films at the time) was located here. A pool hall used the building from about 1915 until the mid 1930s, when Flannery's Tavern opened. * No. 13. 123 North Calumet Road, This one story brick building was one of few to withstand the devastating fire of 1902. It was built as Lowenstine Clothing Store in 1898 and purchased by Charles A. Smith about 1908, when Lowenstine moved to Valparaiso. Smith operated the store until the early 1960s when it was sold to Falvey's Men's Store.

It is slightly different from strategic objectives, which are longer term goals of a business, but they are closely related, as a business will only be able to achieve strategic objectives when operational objectives have been met. Operational objectives are usually set by middle managers for the next six to twelve months based on an organisation's aim. They should be attainable and specific so that they can provide a clear guidance for daily functioning of certain operations. This business term is typically used in the context of strategic management and operational planning.  Developing operational objectives  Peter Drucker suggested that operational objectives should be SMART, which means specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time constrained. First, an operational objective should be specific, focused, well defined and clear enough rather than vague so that employees know what to achieve via the work. A specific objective should state the expected actions and outcomes. This would help to prevent the possibility of employees working for different goals. Secondly, an operational objective should be measurable and quantifiable so that people can know whether it has been met or not. For example, an objective might be increasing sales revenue by ten percent. This would prevent the confusions and conflicts on whether it has been met between different stakeholders. Thirdly, an objective should be achievable and feasible. It also should be agreed by stakeholders, especially by employees. If they think it is un-achievable, it might demotivate them. Fourthly, an objective should be realistic as well as challenging. It should be reasonable given their limited resources. Lastly, it should have a specified deadline (time frame) for its achievement. This would prevent the work from dragged on, and would help to increase productivity. It is also good to determine priorities. For example, operational objectives that would have greater influence on customer satisfaction should be completed in a faster time frame than those have less influence. It might be difficult to set operational objectives that are understood and accepted by all employees, as they might see different priorities and values. Therefore, it is important to let employees to participate in the determining of the objectives and to state them as clearly as possible. After setting appropriate operational objectives for each department, business plans can then be made to achieve them.  Factors that affect operational objectives of an organization  According to Drucker P.F., objectives must be reviewed and changed constantly. This is because operational objectives can be influenced by many internal and external factors. Organisations may need to change their objectives over time in response to changes in their environment.  Internal influences  One of the key internal influences is the amount of available finance. A number of operational decisions would involve considerable investment. Another internal influence can be the type and size of an organisation. For example, if a business changes its legal structure, its aim might be changed and its operational objectives should be revised as well. In addition, key stakeholders such as managers, owners, and customers can influence the objectives. For example, if they have a high willingness and ability to take a risk, then more ambitious objectives might be set.  External influences  One of the external factors is economic influences. If the state of economy gets worse, a firm would like to change its objectives so that it can mainly focuses on survival of the business. Another external factor can be technological development. As technology can affect both the process of production and distribution, it is likely to change operational objectives of an organisation. A business should adapt to change and strive to innovate. By maintaining innovative, a business can obtain competitive advantages that makes it distinguish to its competitors. Lastly, government regulations and constraints can also affect objectives of a business, as they can limit what a business want to achieve.  Examples of operational objectives   Survival  One of the most common operational objective for businesses is survival. For new businesses, survival would be their main priority, as they are likely to face a number of problems, such as negative cash flows and intense competition. Survival can also be an important priority for established firms, as facing an economic recession and becoming a takeover target can be a significant threat to its survival.  Increasing sales revenue  Another common operational objective can be increasing sales revenue. This is very important for all businesses, as it is directly related to their survival. However, firms with a high sales revenue might struggle to survive, as it is not profit.  Raising market share  Many businesses set raising market share as their operational objective. By increasing sales, this will be also improved. For many businesses, each department tends to set its own operational objectives. Examples of SMART operational objectives that a business might have are: * For the human resource department - to maintain employee turnover rate below ten percent for next six months * For the sales department - to increase sales revenue by ten percent over the next six months * For the marketing department - to increase the market share by seven percent over the next one year and taking risk to stake holder  Importance of operational objectives   Motivation  If an organisation has SMART operational objectives, employees can be inspired and motivated to work harder to meet common objectives, as they are measured. By achieving short term goals, employees might feel a great sense of accomplishment and this would help to improve their motivation. According to a research conducted by Rodgers, R. and Je Hunter, management by objectives (MBO) has been shown to increase productivity. Operational objectives also encourage managers to think strategically. In oder to set objectives and plan for the next 6 to 12 months, they need to have a deep understanding of business's current position. According to Peter Drucker, rewards such as recognition, appreciation and performance-related pay need to be provided for achieving objectives to motivate employees and raise efficiency.  Measure and control  Operational objectives help to control and unify an organisation, as they are short-term goals, which are consistent with its aim. In addition, they enable managers not only to track the performance of the workforce against targets, but also to measure and evaluate their performance so that managers can provide feedback and rewards. This would help to identify the areas they have problems and need improvements in order to attain their aims.  Guidance and direction  By stating an organisation's operational objectives specifically, they would provide employees a guidance and direction. Operational objectives tend to be specific and measurable, so that they can help an organisation to achieve its long term goals. It can also help to improve budgeting. For example, the sales department might set an operational objective, which targets to raise sales revenue for the next several months. This encourages managers to predict what level of sales revenue will be in the future, and help them to budget better.

As a composer, Spiegelman has been widely known for his blending of techniques from traditional classical music, dodecaphonic music, aleatoric music, gospel, Russian folk, and electronic idioms. He has written original music for string quartet, piano trio, piano quintet, chamber music with percussion, solo instruments, wind ensembles, symphony orchestra, ballet, film, choral and vocal music.  Personal life  Joel Spiegelman was born in Buffalo, New York on January 23, 1933 to Jenny Simon Spiegelman and Dr. Harry Spiegelman (b. Zhitomir). Both were immigrants from Russia, arriving in the United States as small children during the early years of the 20th century. Joel Spiegelman has been legally married four times with one long-term partnership. His first marriage was to Gail Voelker. Their marriage lasted 19 years and produced three children. He has three grandchildren.  Musical Activities  Joel Spiegelman’s career has encompassed a variety of musical activities as composer, conductor, pianist, harpsichordist, teacher, and author. In 1946, he made his debut with the Buffalo Philharmonic. His performance as piano soloist was reviewed in Musical America, giving him national attention. In the Spring of 1967, Spiegelman was harpsichord soloist with Leonard Bernstein, as the New York Philharmonic performed Edison Denisov’s “Crescendo e Diminuendo”. He has conducted and recorded with the Saint-Petersburg Philharmonic, the Moscow Philharmonic, the Saint-Petersburg Classical Symphony, the State Symphony of Russia, the Moussorgsky Opera Company of Saint-Petersburg, the Tchaikovsky Orchestra, the Moscow Radio TV Orchestra, and the Metro Philharmonic. In addition, he assembled a group of gifted young professional musicians, to form an international youth symphony (in Moscow). During June 2010, Spiegelman conducted a requiem concert with the Kyrgyz National Symphony in memory of the victims of the April 7, 2010 uprising in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. In honor of this event, he composed a new work inspired by the great Kyrgyz author, Chengiz Aitmatov, entitled The Cry of the Bird of Passage. Two years later, he created the International Festival of Music and the Visual Arts in Bishkek which took place during May 2012 in Bishkek and at Lake Issyk-Kul starring artists from Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Mexico, Denmark, Greenland, and the United States. Retrospective concerts of Spiegelman's works were presented Carnegie Hall, Saint-Petersburg (Russia), Vilnius, the Moscow Conservatory, the Kremlin and Bishkek. Since the late 1970s, Spiegelman has actively pursued the possibilities of electronic media. This interest was first demonstrated in New Age Bach (Atlantic, 1988), which featured his transcription of Bach’s Goldberg Variations. For this album, he played the then-revolutionary Kurzweil 250 keyboard.

It lies in the parish of Louth, 10 kilometres from Dundalk, County Louth, and 11 kilometres from Carrickmacross, County Monaghan. The community consists of a small chapel, a primary school, a football field and a community centre. History Stonetown is traditionally associated with the legend of Cúchulainn, the hero of the Táin Bó Cúailnge and son of Lugh who engaged one of Queen Maeve's warriors, Fergus, in battle at Áth dá Ferta in the townland of Oaktate near Stonetown. According to the story, Cúchulainn agreed to make a mock flight from Fergus, in return for a promise that Fergus would fly from him at another time. That promise, redeemed in the last battle, ensured victory for the Ulstermen. The story also tells that Fergus Loingsech from Connaught, and twelve others who sought Queen Maeve's admiration, engaged Cúchulainn in battle in this same location. Cúchulainn struck off their heads, placed twelve stones in the ground and set a head on each stone, hence the name \\"Stonetown\\". Most annals report that Aed Oirdnide Mac Neill, King of Tara, died in 819 at Áth dá Ferta in the territory of Conaille Muirtheimne. In 1924 a number of pre-historic urns were discovered in the townland of Oaktate (near the claimed site of the battle at Áth dá Ferta). Other sites include holy wells associated with Saint Ultan and Saint Patrick. Religion The area's Catholic community is served by Saint Mary's (Our Lady of the Snows) Chapel in Stonetown Upper. The chapel was built by Rev. P Banan in 1837. The plan of the chapel is in the shape of a cross. In 1987 renovation work was completed by P.P Rev. J.Finn and rededicated by Tomas O'Fiach. In 1816 Patrick Devan, a hedge schoolteacher and the sexton of the chapel held a gathering which culminated in the Wildgoose Lodge Murders. He fled to Dublin, where he was arrested. Despite promises of money and freedom from prosecution, he did not cooperate with the authorities. He pleaded not guilty and conducted his own defence, but was found guilty, hanged and gibbetted. Education St Oliver's National School Stonetown's national (primary) school, Saint Oliver's National School, was built in 1952 and is a detached nine-bay single-storey building. It has a pitched slate roof, clay ridge tiles, painted roughcast rendered chimney stacks, smooth rendered corbelled caps, and circular cast- iron downpipes and vent pipes. The school is surrounded by painted stone walls, wrought-iron gates, v-shaped stiles with stone steps. As of early 2020, the school had an enrollment of 26 pupils. An older school, which predates Saint Oliver's National School, stands opposite Pairc Annachminnon. Locally known as \\"Old Stonetown Hall\\", this building hasn't been in use for many years. Sport Stonetown's local Gaelic Athletic Association club is Annaghminnon Rovers GFC. Founded in 1959 in the townland of Annaghminnon, the club football field, dressing rooms and community hall are situated near Stonetown's national school.

The Petrobelli Altarpiece is a painting of c. 1563 by Paolo Veronese, the remaining fragments of which are now divided between four museums. History The picture is generally assumed to be the altarpiece commissioned by the cousins Girolamo (d. 1569) and Antonio (d. 1587) Petrobelli for the church of San Francis in the small town of Lendinara, near Venice. It is also agreed to be by the leading Venetian painter Paolo Veronese, who had strong ties to the region, although the commission is not documented, nor was the work engraved nor mentioned by contemporary works on art. The date is either 1563, which was mentioned in an inscription on a frieze with the names of the Petrobellis in the church, or if this is ignored and the work is judged only on stylistic grounds, considerably later in the view of most art historians. The cousins had inherited their uncle's large estate and had no legitimate heirs; in the end Petrobello Petrobelli, illegitimate son of Girolamo, inherited the estates of both men. Presumably the cousins hoped that the spectacular work would seal their status as one of the leading families in the town.Ottawa, \\"Commission; Brigstocke, 199 Saint Anthony Abbot and Antonio Petrobelli, National Gallery of Scotland Set above the altar in their burial chapel, Veronese’s painting shows donor portraits of the two men protected and presented to Christ by their name saints. The cousins are privileged to witness a miraculous apparition, a foretaste of the future: the archangel Saint Michael, who will weigh the souls of the dead at the Last Judgment. Above, we see the dead Christ, who died to redeem mankind. Veronese offered his patrons a compellingly realistic depiction of a visionary scene, and captured the hope of the faithful Christian for salvation. The angels carry three of the Instruments of the Passion.Dulwich; Ottawa, \\"Iconography\\", which has much more information. Head of the Archangel Michael, Blanton Museum of Art In the 1770s the church was disestablished after the suppression of its order by the Venetian government. In 1785 the church was finally demolished, and by 1789 the altarpiece was with a Venetian art dealer. It was at this stage it was divided, and in 1795 the Dulwich fragment was sold by the London art dealer to his friend Sir Francis Bourgeois, who bequeathed it to Dulwich in 1811.Murray, 29 The fragments all eventually came to rest in public collections in England (Dulwich Picture Gallery, London), Scotland (National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh), Canada (National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa), and the United States (Blanton Museum of Art, Austin, Texas).Dulwich Re-emergence of the Archangel Michael Close examination of the fragments, years of study, and careful restoration were needed to reconstruct the altarpiece’s original form. As reconstructed, the position of the two donor and patron fragments at each side of the painting can be seen by the columns, which match up to those in the top fragment. However the left hand Edinburgh fragment has been slightly trimmed at the bottom and left side, and only the Dulwich fragment on the right contains part of the original bottom and right hand edges. The wing, spear and arm of Michael can be seen at the top right corner of the left-hand fragment in Edinburgh, just as his hand holding scales, and the tip of his mantle floating off his shoulder, appear at the left of the Dulwich piece. These elements were overpainted in both these fragments until restorations in recent decades, and a series of proposed reconstructions in 1932-33 had an empty centre, which it was suggested might have been occupied by a Madonna, a crucifix (real or painted), or a real reliquary,Ottawa, \\"Reconstruction\\" although a Saint Michael was recognised as a possibility, and the 1914 Edinburgh Catalogue claimed, completely wrongly, that the missing figure was at Castle Howard.Brigstocke, 198 Parts of Michael were first identified at Dulwich around 1950; the Edinburgh parts were revealed in 1958, the attribute of the scales making it clear that it was a figure of Michael that had occupied the centre of the painting. The Blanton fragment was only identified as part of the work in 2008, by a Dulwich curator. Michael's body is missing, and the dragon or serpent he was standing on and piercing with his spear. Other than that the figures of the original work appear to be complete. The missing areas are a strip across the whole width of the painting under the top portion in Ottawa, as well as the right side of the Ottawa fragment, and a strip down the centre of the lower half of the work, except for the Blanton head.Dulwich; Brigstocke, 198; Ottawa, \\"Restoration\\" and \\"Reconstruction\\" It is rather odd that Michael's body was entirely disposed of; it may have been damaged.Brigstocke, 198 In 2009, an exhibition at the Dulwich Gallery temporarily reunited the fragments for the first time in over two hundred years.Dulwich The restored picture travelled to Canada and the USA later the same year.

History Origins The ancestral units to the regiment were created mainly as means of defending the Polish interest and the interest of the ethnic Poles living in Kresy at the end of World War I. Russians, Poles, Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Belarusians, and even Anarchists competed for the sovereignty over the area. The 13th Regiment was formed out of the cavalry units of the Lithuanian and Belarusian Self-DefenceThe name that the ethnic Lithuanians and Belarusians could never agree with, since the majority of the men serving in them were ethnic Poles. on December 27, 1918, on the estate of a Mr. Pośpieszek. On December 28, the regiment was moved to the garrison at Vilnius (Wilno) and was stationed in the barracks in the Antokol district. Władysław Dąbrowski, whose nom-de-guerre was \\"Dąb\\" or \\"Oak\\", was the first commander of the regiment. The regiment became the first in newly independent Poland, it was originally called the 1st Regiment of Wilno Uhlans. It officially became part of the Polish Armed Forces in June 1919, receiving its pre-World War II name and number. The regiment was nationally famous because of the so-called \\"\\"Zagonczyk was a soldier using horses mobility in hit—and—run attacks deep behind the enemy lines. or \\"brave raiders\\", of which its first commander, Major Władysław Dąbrowski, was a member. In the official documents of the Polish Armed Forces, the phrase \\"Wilenskich\\" (\\"of Vilnius\\") was omitted; the official name was the 13th Regiment. In spite of this, the officers, soldiers and public persisted in calling it the \\"13th Wilno Regiment\\". Polish-Soviet War: 1919–1920 The 13th Regiment participated in the Polish–Soviet War of 1919–1920 and became known for many flanking manoeuvres and raids behind Soviet lines. It protected the retreat of general Żeligowski troops. On June 29, 1919, in Vilnius, General Edward Rydz-Śmigły handed over the regiment's new banner to a small delegation from a combat area. After a failed attempt at seizing territory in the Ukraine beyond Kiev, many soldiers from the disbanded Tatar Uhlan Regiment, (named after Colonel Mustafa Achmatowicz, a renowned eighteenth- century Lithuanian Tatar cavalryman), joined the \\"Wilno Regiment\\". Lipka Tatar Tradition Since the joining, the regiment had been following dual tradition of the before—mentioned Lithuanian and Belarusian Self-Defence and of the 7th Tatar Regiment of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania formed in 1792 and stationed in Janow, the same place where over century later, the 13th regiment fought its very first battle. The 18th-century unit was under command of the legendary Colonel Aleksander Mustafa Ulan.Islam in the Baltic: Europe's Early Muslim Community (International Library of Historical Studies) , Harry Norris, Tauris Academic Studies; .1 edition (April 14, 2009) Interwar period: 1921–1939 In late 1921, the regiment patrolled the Polish border with Lithuania and was stationed for a brief period in Głębokie, at present Hlybokaye in Belarus. The regiment was moved to Nowa Wilejka near Vilnius in 1922, where it stayed until the Invasion of Poland in 1939. In 1936, a Tatar unit was created within the 13th Regiment of Wilno Uhlans. By the order of the Polish Minister of Defence, issued on June 9, a troop within the regiment was renamed the 1st Tatar Squadron, to which all new recruits of Tatar ethnicity were directed. Captain Michał Bohdanowicz was the original commander. The unit was led for a short time by Captain Bazyli Marcisz and LTC Jan Tarnowski. Captain Aleksander Jeljaszewicz became its final pre-war commander from November 25, 1938. During the Regiment's Holiday on July 25, 1937, the squadron (or mounted infantry battalion) received buńczuk which was made according to the old Tatar ways and funded by the entire Tatar community of Poland. During the symbolic ceremony of the burial of the heart of Marshal Józef Piłsudski in the Rasos cemetery in Vilnius, a detail from the 1st Tatar Squadron fired a three-volley salute. Invasion of Poland In 1939, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Józef Szostak, the 13th Regiment of Wilno Uhlans fought as a part of the Wileńska Cavalry Brigade under the command of Colonel Konstanty Drucki-Lubecki. Between September 2 and 5, the brigade took part in heavy fighting near Piotrków Trybunalski. On September 9 and 10, the brigade lost many men and much equipment while retreating across the Vistula river near Maciejowice. The brigade fought in Lubelszczyzna near the city of Lublin, before being crushed near Tomaszow Lubelski. The largest remnant of the regiment became part of the Independent Operational Group Polesie under the command of Major General Franciszek Kleeberg. Home Army Subdivisions of the 13th Regiment of Wilno Uhlans AK were recreated in 1944 in the Wilno District of the Home Army as a mounted infantry division in Rudnicka Forest, a mounted infantry battalion attached to the Home Army 3rd Wilno Brigade, a mounted infantry platoon attached to the 4th Home Army Brigade and a mounted infantry platoon operating within Kampinos Forest. Banners and markings The regiment's lances initially bore pennons, but after 1936 these were only issued by personal request, when all cavalry units were transformed into mounted infantry units and were in the process of becoming fully mechanized divisions. However, progress was slow, only two fully mechanized units fought in the Invasion of Poland in 1939 besides armoured units, heavy artillery units, AA artillery units, Polish Air Force's ground units, and most of the tabors. Uniforms were adorned with miniature banners, pink in colour, with a slim cornflower-coloured stripe in the middle. Each trooper's rogatywka (hat) was adorned with a pink stripe running around the crown. The 1st Tatar Squadron also wore on the small banners, a golden Crescent Moon and star. The regiment's holiday was July 25 (in memory of the Battle of Janow in 1920).

The play is a fictional account of an event that happened in the Forest of Dean in the 1890s when four Frenchmen came over the border from Gloucester with dancing bears, who were subsequently killed by miners coming off the late shift in retaliation for an unrelated attack on a young local girl. Synopsis In the 1890s, Joe - a travelling Italian showman - and his dancing bear Gina make their way over the border from Gloucester to the Forest of Dean; hungry and penniless from their poor reception in the last town, Joe hopes to drum up more business. As they make their way to Berry Hill, a group of schoolchildren racially abuse Joe. After Joe threatens to set Gina on them, the children disperse. Watching from the undergrowth are miner Mickey Teague and his mistress Rebecca. Mickey is reluctant to leave his wife to be with Rebecca, but Rebecca is pregnant and threatens to reveal him as her unborn child's father unless he comply with her wishes. As she rushes towards the town, Mickey brains Rebecca with a rock and leaves her to die in the woods. In Berry Hill, the townsfolk enjoy the revelry of a Sunday afternoon at the local tavern. Amongst them is Rufus, the village 'simpleton', who once again is dancing on tables to the amusement and goading of the villagers. The local preacher Ebeneezer, Rufus' guardian, arrives and removes him. Rufus is beaten severely by Ebeneezer, and flees into the woods where he discovers Rebecca. Ebeneezer follows and upon seeing Rebecca's body assumes Rufus has attempted to kill her. As Rebecca is still alive, the preacher fears that she will implicate Rufus and kills her. Later that day, Joe and Gina arrive in Berry Hill and entertain the townsfolk. False rumours are circulating that Gina had mauled one of the schoolchildren the pair had encountered on their arrival over the border. The townsfolk pelt Joe and Gina with stones and force them to flee the village. Back in the forest, Rebecca's body has been discovered and the local constabulary set to work interviewing the residents of the nearby towns. As the shocked villagers gather together back at the tavern, a desperate Mickey convinces the townsfolk that the bear was responsible. The townsfolk gather at the chapel for evening prayers where a guilt-stricken Ebeneezer delivers a sermon on 'the beast within'. As the preacher calls on the congregation to vanquish the beast in their midst, the villagers choose to see this as a reference to Joe and Gina and a group of miners head off in pursuit of their quarry. Ebeneezer hangs himself and Rufus, upon discovering the body, flees towards the forest. Arriving at the clearing where Joe and Gina have settled down for the evening, the miners throw stones and heavy rocks at the bear before advancing on Gina and beating her to death. Moved by Joe's tears, the men offer him recompense; Joe declines and asks to be left alone with his dead friend. As the miners return to the village they pass a frightened Rufus, and pause to consider his terror.

He lost to Republican Assemblyman Pierce H. Deamer, Jr., 160,125 (55.8%) to 124,492 (43.4%). Prosecutor He served as a Bergen County, New Jersey prosecutor in the trial of Thomas Trantino, charged with the execution-style murder of two police officers at a bar on U.S. Route 46 in Lodi, New Jersey in 1963. Trantino was convicted and sentenced to death, but his death sentence was commuted to a single life term after the death penalty was abolished in the state in 1972. Trantino would face a battle to be released on parole, and was not paroled until 2002. Judge He was appointed as a judge on the New Jersey Superior Court in 1967 by Governor of New Jersey Richard J. Hughes, and served in that post until 1983, when he stepped down from the bench, having been the presiding judge of the criminal court division.

Early life Jack was born on December 29, 1906, in Saint Lucia, and spent his early years in British Guiana before emigrating to the United States.Biography at BlackPast.org His father was a minister in the African Orthodox Church. The young Hulan worked as a janitor at a paper box factory, eventually rising to become a vice president of the firm. He went on to become active in politics with Tammany Hall, winning several elections to the New York State Assembly, representing parts of Harlem in the 163rd, 164th, 165th, 166th, 167th, 168th and 169th New York State Legislatures from 1941 to 1953. As a legislator, he attempted unsuccessfully to pass legislation that would block the racial segregation in New York State public schools and in the sale of property.Biondi, Martha, To Stand And Fight: The Struggle for Civil Rights in Postwar New York City, Harvard University Press, 2003, pp. 117, 242 Borough President In November 1953, Jack was elected Borough President of Manhattan, making him one of the nation's most important African-American elected officials. In 1956, Jack was the featured speaker at an event called \\"Interracial Sunday\\" at Loyola University New Orleans. This caused a major controversy, and Emile Wagner, one of the founders of the New Orleans White Citizens Council, obtained material from the House Unamerican Activities Committee which suggested that Jack was a former member of subversive organizations. Jack denied the charges, accusing the White Citizens Council of a \\"rearguard action to disobey the decision handed- down by the Supreme Court on desegregation in schools.\\" New York City Mayor Robert F.

It was charged that Ungar, a real estate developer, hoped to obtain a contract from the city in return for the favor, even though Jack voted against granting Ungar the contract. Jack was tried twice; the first trial ended with a hung jury, and in the second trial, the jury found him guilty of accepting the gift and of then conspiring to hide it. On January 16, 1961, Jack was sentenced to a suspended one-year term in prison, which had the effect of automatically removing him from the office of Borough President. Return to Assembly Jack was elected a member of the State Assembly from 1968 to 1972, representing the 70th District in the 177th, 178th and 179th New York State Legislatures. In 1972, Jack was convicted of extortion, along with five others. They were trying to force shop owners to carry a line of products manufactured by a company owned by Jack. He received a three-month prison term and a $5,000 fine. He appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which denied his appeal. He was later pardoned by President Jimmy Carter according to his daughter.

Located along a route of the Oregon Trail, Chesterfield was founded by Mormon settlers in 1881. After a railroad line was built through Bancroft to the south, the community lost some of its momentum, and agricultural difficulties led to its desertion by the end of the 1930s. Today, the community is operated as a tourist attraction, with guided tours and a museum.Bear River Heritage Area , Bear River Heritage Area Council. Accessed 2009-10-17.

The historic district includes 41 buildings and eight sites, spread out over an area of . Some buildings in the district are examples of the Greek Revival and Queen Anne architectural styles. History Chesterfield LDS Meetinghouse In 1879, Chester Call and his niece's husband, Christian Nelson, established a horse ranch in the area. Thinking this might be a good area in which to live, Chester Call told his family and friends about the area and they decided to come and settle in 1881 and 1882. Chesterfield's first settlers built their homes in the river bottom of the Portneuf River, west of present-day Chesterfield. Unlike typical Mormon settlements, which were founded by settlers sent by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (hereafter referred to as LDS) authorities, the community was founded spontaneously by its first settlers and not set up in the typical compact, grid patterned townsite. Also in 1881, the Union Pacific Railroad started to construct the Oregon Short Line Railroad to the south of Chesterfield, running through present-day Bancroft. The new settlers sold logs and railroad ties to the railroad, raising much needed cash. In 1883, LDS Church authorities visited the area to establish a branch. While there, the visiting leaders asked their members to organize into a central village, away from the Portneuf River flood plain. The current Chesterfield townsite was chosen up along the foothills. As in traditional Mormon towns, Chesterfield was laid out in a grid pattern, consisting of thirty-five ten-acre blocks. By 1890, the LDS meetinghouse and a store were the only buildings on the townsite as a mistake in the government survey kept the land off the market for a time. The LDS Chesterfield Ward was established in 1884 consisting of 136 people in 24 families. By 1900, the population had steadily grown to 73 families containing 418 people in the Chesterfield Ward and 150 people in the recently split off Hatch Ward. Between the years of 1898 and 1900, the area suffered through very cold winters and a drought. This caused a considerable exodus to occur in 1901. The 1907 Panic, and another bad winter, caused another exodus. By 1908, fewer than 400 people were left in the area and only 208 people in the Chesterfield Ward. The population then steadily grew with a peak of just under 700 people in the Chesterfield area by 1920. The series of recessions in the 1920s and nationwide agricultural problems started the death knell for Chesterfield. Just over 425 people were left in the area by 1928, and the buildings of the Chesterfield town site were mostly deserted before 1941 when the school closed. The general store closed in 1958. By 1970, less than 200 people lived in the area and only 20 people lived in historic Chesterfield. Historical buildings The LDS Meetinghouse is the most prominent and best preserved building in Chesterfield. It was built between 1887 and 1892. Denmark Jensen Cabin The original Amusement Hall was erected in 1895, next door to the LDS Meetinghouse. The building was the center for social activities for Chesterfield. It consisted of a large room with a hardwood dance floor and a stage. Over time, the building was reduced to ruins. The Amusement Hall was restored between 1999 and 2003. LDS members pay tithing to the Church. Few members could pay cash around 1900, so grains, vegetables, eggs and farm animals were instead paid \\"in kind\\". The Tithing Office and the Tithing Granary were constructed in 1900. Grain donations were stored in the Tithing Granary. The Tithing Office was where members came to pay their tithing and the goods were dispensed to those in need; the facility acted as a sort of a warehouse and general store. The Nathan Barlow House, built about 1900, was the home of the postmaster and owner of the general store. After the Panic of 1907 and the harsh winter of 1907-1908, Nathan Barlow lost all of his money and moved out of the community. The home was restored in 2009, with descendants of Nathan Barlow contributing the furnishings. The Ira Call cabin is a saltbox style home. It contained two polygamous families for a short time. Aunt Ruth Call David's cabin built of red pine logs with a dirt floor in 1881 and 1882. Aunt Ruth was a Native American who was adopted by Chester Call's parents in the 1860s. As the town's midwife, she delivered most of the babies. Notable residents *Frank Chester Robertson, Western author References Further reading *Anderson, Lavina Fielding (ed.) (1993).

Life Győző Zemplén was born in the town of Nagykanizsa, Hungary. He grew up in Fiume. In 1896, he began his studies at the University of Budapest and, at 19 years age, won an award with an essay on the viscosity of gases. After that he began theoretical and experimental studies. In 1900 he published the essay \\"On the basic assumptions of the kinetic theory of gases\\" in the Annalen der Physik, but had been previously published mathematical works. In the same year he graduated from the University, but remained as a research assistant. In 1902 he became the assistant of Loránd Eötvös, who sent him in 1904-1905 to study abroad in Göttingen and Paris. In Göttingen he developed a mathematical treatment of the theory of shock waves, which gave him the attention of Felix Klein, who invited him to write a corresponding article in the Encyclopaedia of mathematical sciences. By applying entropy considerations (rather than only the energy theorem), he solved an open problem in the theory of shock waves in an essay \\"Sur l'impossibilité des ondes de choc négatives dans les gaz\\" in the Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences (1905). He showed that shock waves propagate only towards rarer gas layers. On his return from Paris, and his Habilitation in 1905, he became a lecturer at the University of Budapest (1905) and at the Technical University of Budapest (1907). In 1912, he became a professor at the Technical University in theoretical physics. He was also a professor at Teachers' Training College in 1908 and was active in the reform of physics teaching in Hungary. Zemplen also dealt with the then new theory of relativity, wrote a textbook on Electrodynamics (The electricity and its practical applications in 1910) and translated a book by Marie Curie on radioactivity and in 1905 wrote a book himself on this issue. In 1908 he became a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, whose Rozsay price he received in 1911. Since 1898 he was a member of the Hungarian Society of Natural Sciences. In 1914 he became secretary of the society founded by Eötvös for the mathematical and physical sciences section and editor of its magazine. He was active also in several other societies and committees and a founding member of the football club of the University. In World War I, he volunteered and carried a battery of mortars on the Serbian front. For some time he lay with typhoid fever in a hospital in Klagenfurt. He fought again at the front in an offensive against the Italians at Monte Dorole in the Battle of Asiago in June 1916. At a forward observation post, he was hit by shrapnel and died shortly afterwards. External links * Zemplén, The Scientist and the Teacher (2004).

The 2001 census counted a resident population of 193 (93 males, 100 females) living in 97 family units. It is a seaside village of rare beauty that unfolds between Rodi Garganico and Peschici, 6 km north of Vico del Gargano along the coastal route of SS89 freeway. Known for its long sandy beach and for the forests of Aleppo Pines— among the oldest and largest in Italy— which cover the territory and penetrate the village up to the fringes of the beach, it owes its fame in great measure to the early 20th-century writings of Nicola Serena di Lapigio. History The huge pinewood \\"Pineta Marzini\\" between the Calenella Plain and San MenaioThe history of San Menaio is mixed with the mythology that characterizes the folk tradition for centuries in the Gargano area. In ancient age here had spread the cult of Cassandra and of the goddess Mena (from which San Menaio). Tradition tells that it took so much effort by Benedictines first settlements in the area of San Menaio to wipe out idolatry and to change old temples in churches, enlivened with the names of saints and Christian martyrs. The name of the place is, according to another historical tradition, more widespread and remembered by Giuseppe D'Addetta, to be traced back to the story about the apparition of Saint Menas, an Arab warrior, who saved the inhabitants from Saracens attacks. In the contemporary era San Menaio saw its popularity rapidly increased, especially in the 1960s and 1970s, becoming a place of elegant and exclusive resort and holidays, and passing, unfortunately not without exceptions, through innumerable attempts development abuses that have undermined the sobriety of urban plan, which consists mainly of villas with gardens blend perfectly in the orography of the coast. In those years Italian artist Andrea Pazienza stays here and finds inspiration from the beauty of this places. San Menaio Eastern Waterfront was recently named in his honour. Geography Beach of Sospetto (aerial view)Rocks separating the two beaches of Tufare (also Cento Scalini) and of Sospetto; on background Montepucci promontory. The town of San Menaio occupies an area nearly three kilometers long and 900 meters wide, developed mainly along the coast from the historical center, built around the river and the medieval tower. The hilly terrain offers a more linear profile nearby the town and moving along the coast towards East terrain becomes more rough near the district called Valazzo, which marks the eastern boundary of the country. Continuing to east coast rises up to tens of meters and then suddenly become flat at floodplain of Calenella. The geology of the sites is typically Karst, with sediments fossil dating from Cretaccio and more recent flood plains and beaches at.cf. Geological Map of Italy (Online) Hydrography, although minimal in the rest of the Gargano, consists of two short seasonal torrents crossing the country. Even the flora is not uniform: the coast near the town border with Rodi Garganico presents almost exclusively orange trees (infiltrated by olive inwards); on western side hills are covered by an extensive forest of conifers (Aleppo pine), the Foresta Marzini.  Beaches  There are four beaches along the coast of San Menaio. All face north-northwest, they are characterized by a fine sandy bottom that has a grain very light and golden color.See'Sand, Gravel, Pebbles - beaches of Gargano\\" Department and Tourism Promotion of the Region Apulia PDF download  San Menaio Beach  It is a long, typically fine sandy beach, which stretches from west to east for more than 2.5 kilometers from Murge Nere to Valazzo. Wide in some places more than 60 m, is largely equipped and bordered by waterfront.  Monuments and places of interest  The Torre dei Preposti Worthy of note is the 14th-century tower called \\"Torre dei Preposti\\" (Tower of the Supervisors), a fortress overlooking the sea with functions of defense and customs, which breaks the linearity of the promenade between the old town of San Menaio and the recent residential neighbourhood called \\"Murge Nere\\" (Black Rocks) because of the presence of two huge monoliths of dark rock outcropping from shore. The Church of St. Anthony of San Menaio, simple and austere, dates back to 1600. Situated in a panoramic position, it was converted from a chapel in a parish only in 1894.  Economy  Tourism, the main economic source of the site, has seasonal characteristics, and an international medium-high level target. The sector has received an incentive in 2009 with the opening of the nearby port \\"Marina di Rodi Garganico\\". San Menaio is also known for fervent trade citrus DOP \\"Blonde Orange of Gargano\\" and \\"Lemon Femminello of Gargano\\" with America and European Union.

Keep in mind that the SADS does not map as precisely onto current nosology, i.e., DSM-5, compared to diagnostic structured interviews such as the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. is a collection of psychiatric diagnostic criteria and symptom rating scales originally published in 1978. It is organized as a semi-structured diagnostic interview. The structured aspect is that every interview asks screening questions about the same set of disorders regardless of the presenting problem; and positive screens get explored with a consistent set of symptoms. These features increase the sensitivity of the interview and the inter-rater reliability (or reproducibility) of the resulting diagnoses. The SADS also allows more flexibility than fully structured interviews: Interviewers can use their own words and rephrase questions, and some clinical judgment is used to score responses. There are three versions of the schedule, the regular SADS, the lifetime version (SADS-L) and a version for measuring the change in symptomology (SADS-C). Although largely replaced by more structured interviews that follow diagnostic criteria such as DSM-IV and DSM-5, and specific mood rating scales, versions of the SADS are still used in some research papers today. Diagnoses covered The diagnoses covered by the interview include schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders and a limited number of other fairly common diagnoses. Relationship with the Research Diagnostic Criteria The SADS was developed by the same group of rearchers as the Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC). While the RDC is a list of diagnostic criteria for psychiatric disorders, the SADS interview allows diagnoses based on RDC criteria to be made, and also rates subject's symptoms and level of functioning. K-SADS The K-SADS (or Kiddie-SADS) is a version of the SADS adapted for school-aged children of 6–18 years. There are various different versions of the K-SADS, each varying slightly in terms of disorders and specific symptoms covered, as well as the scale range used. All of the variations are still semi-structured interviews, giving the interviewer more flexibility about how to phrase and probe items, while still covering a consistent set of disorders. The K-SADS-E (Epidemiological version) was developed for epidemiological research. It focused on current issues and episodes only. Most of the items used a four point rating scale. The K-SADS-PL (Present and Lifetime version) is administered by interviewing the parent(s), the child, and integrating them into a summary rating that includes parent report, child report, and clinical observations during the interview. The interview covers both present issues (i.e., the reason the family is seeking an evaluation) as well as past episodes of the disorders. Most items use a three point rating scale for severity (not present, subthreshold, and threshold—which combines both moderate and severe presentations). It has been used with preschool as well as school-aged children. A 2009 working draft removed all reference to the DSM-III-R criteria (which were replaced with the publication of the DSM-IV in 1994) and made some other modifications. A DSM-5 version is being prepared and validated. The WASH-U K-SADS (Washington University version) added items to the depression and mania modules and used a six point severity rating for severity.

Early life and education Duncan and Mary Wallace in Milton ON, 1976 Born in Kitchener, Ontario in 1938, Wallace was raised and educated in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Winnipeg and a Master of Divinity degree from St. John's College, Winnipeg. He was ordained a deacon in 1964 and priest in 1965.André Forget, \\"Bishop Duncan Douglas Wallace, 1938-2015,\\" Anglican Journal, June 29, 2015. Wallace married Mary Emily Warriner, a teacher and eventually a principal with the Regina Public School Division. They had two children, Lisa and Andrew. Pastoral Service Wallace's first ministry was at Fairford First Nations Mission, from 1965 to 1969, followed by St. Anne's, Winnipeg, from 1969 to 1974, both in the Diocese of Rupert's Land.Barbara-Lynn Dixon, \\"Bishop Duncan Wallace retires\\", Saskatchewan Anglican, September 2005. From 1974 to 1978 he served at Grace Church, Milton, Ontario, in the Diocese of Niagara.Bishop Duncan Wallace Obituary, Archdiocese of Regina, July 3, 2015. Wallace was known for his impish sense of humour. In 1977, when his friend Michael Peers was elected Bishop of Qu'Appelle—having become Rector and Dean in Regina and the Wallaces having attended a celebrating party—Wallace sent him a note quoting the biblical text: \\"Oh lord remember me when you come into your kingdom.\\" A year later, in 1978, he was appointed the Rector of St. Paul's Cathedral (Regina) and Dean of Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan, a position he held for nineteen years until his election to the episcopacy. Bishop of Qu'Appelle In 1997 he was elected tenth Bishop of Qu'Appelle. Residential Schools Settlement The defining feature of Wallace's tenure as bishop was the residential schools litigation, which put at risk the continued existence of the Diocese of Qu'Appelle. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the federal government had a policy of encouraging residential schools for children of Canadian First Nations, which were administered primarily by the Roman Catholic, Anglican and United Churches. While the purpose of the schools was to assist children of First Nations to integrate in Canada, in actuality, there was a large amount of child abuse, including sexual abuse. In the 1990s, survivors of the residential schools began lawsuits against the federal government and the churches, including the Diocese of Qu'Appelle, which had been responsible for operating some residential schools. The magnitude of the claims by the former students came near to bankrupting the Diocese of Qu'Appelle, as occurred to the former Anglican Diocese of Cariboo in the Ecclesiastical Province of British Columbia and Yukon, which ceased operations on December 31, 2001 after being forced into bankruptcy.Kathy Blair, \\"Diocese of Cariboo plans own shutdown\\", Anglican Journal, September 1, 2000 Under Wallace's leadership, the Diocese of Qu'Appelle was able to reach a settlement, as part of a national settlement made by the Anglican Church of Canada as a whole. The Primate of the Anglican Church, Michael Peers, made a formal apology to the survivors of the residential schools, on behalf of the Anglican Church of Canada. Two of Wallace's colleagues commented on the significant role he played in the settlement of the residential schools claims. Deacon Michael Jackson of St. Paul's Cathedral stated that \\"Duncan's inner courage and strength got us through it.\\" Tom Morgan, Archbishop of Saskatoon, noted that \\"Nowhere have his skills and his non-anxious presence been more tested and appreciated than in matters concerning litigation arising from residential schools.\\" Later life and death He retired in 2005. Although retired, he stayed active in church matters. As recently as the spring of 2015, he filled in as incumbent priest for a Regina parish which was searching for a new priest.Bishop Rob Hardwick, \\"Pastoral letter to the Parishes of the Diocese,\\" May 8, 2015.

The book has been translated into German. Plot summary The story takes the form of a quest exploring in allegorical fashion the qualities of youth, duty, self and heritage. Ywain, a knight bored with his administrative duties, abandons his estate to his younger brother and goes on a pilgrimage to seek his heart's desire. Following a will-o'-the-wisp resembling a child, he is led to a hermit dwelling in the wilderness, under whose instruction he lives for a time. Afterwards his quest takes him to the city of Paladore (also the subject of a separate poem by Newbolt) and the lady Aithne, half-fae enchantress and daughter to Sir Ogier of Kerioc and the Sidhe-descended Lady Ailinn of Ireland, whom he woos and encounters on various occasions. In the course of his adventures he intervenes in the strife of the two warring Companies of the Tower and of the Eagle, afterward feasting with both in Paladore; he undertakes the Three Adventures, of the Chess, the Castle of Maidens, and the Howling Beast; visits the City of the Saints and the Lost Lands of the South; sojourns with Fauns; and has a vision of Paladore’s counterpart, the city of Aladore, which he afterwards seeks. After revisiting the hermit and Paladore, he achieves his objective, and he and Aithne are wed there. In a subsequent return to Paladore Ywain finds he has wearied of it, is mishandled by the Great Ones of the city, and is “excommunicate after the Custom of Paladore.” Wondering at the likeness and contrast of the two cities, he and Aithne wonder which is the more enduring, and test the question by building two sand castles on the shore. Ywain’s, built with his hands as a stand-in for Paladore, is swept away by the tide, while Aithne’s, created from a song in representation of Aladore, is preserved. They then return to the mortal city, and appear to perish in a final battle.

It was closely associated with Assumption College: both trace their beginnings to 1904, when they were founded by French clergymen with the assistance of French-speaking Americans. The school shared its campus with Assumption College, and grew in size, reaching 400 students at one point, and reputation, benefiting intellectually from its co-location with the college. Instruction was French-oriented and often given in the French language, with class groupings referred to as \\"Eléments\\" and great importance given to the learning of French, Franco-American culture, and French Canadian culture, in addition to Catholic teachings. Following French custom, classes were held on Saturday mornings, but not on Wednesday or Saturday afternoons. Philosophically, the priests at the school emphasized using rational analysis in the pursuit of truth. School authorities behaved in a firm but fairly reasonable manner. Basketball was the most popular sport at the school. Among the graduates of Assumption Preparatory School was the future U.S. Senator from Alaska and 2008 presidential candidate Mike Gravel in 1949. In 1953, a tornado destroyed the campus. The College was moved to a different site within Worcester, but the Preparatory School was rebuilt on the same spot. The 1960s saw financial troubles, dwindling enrollment, and an aging staff. Assumption Preparatory School was as a result closed in June 1970. The physical campus of the school subsequently became part of Quinsigamond Community College. Assumption Preparatory School graduates are included in the alumni activities of Assumption College, which is still in operation.

He is a former National Wrestling Alliance North American Heavyweight champion and participated in the first televised match of Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. Professional wrestling career Moraza was trained by Dusty Rhodes and debuted in 1999 as Jorge Estrada. He wrestled in Georgia's NWA Wildside as well as Rhodes's Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling, winning the TCW Tag Team Championship with Glacier (Ray Lloyd). Estrada also wrestled for Extreme Championship Wrestling during 2000, including a match against Simon Diamond and Johnny Swinger in their first appearance as a team. Moraza's biggest exposure came in the early days of the Total Nonstop Action (TNA) wrestling promotion. From the first TNA event in June 2002, he wrestled with the gimmick of an Elvis impersonator as part of The Flying Elvises trio until that group disbanded in October. Estrada continued to wear the Elvis jumpsuit as a solo wrestler, and took a valet named Priscilla. During this time, he won the NWA North American Championship from Paul Atlas at the National Wrestling Alliance 54th Anniversary Show on October 26 in Texas. Curiously, his status as champion was never mentioned on TNA programming, even though TNA was the flagship promotion of the NWA at the time and the North American Championship was ostensibly the second-highest in status behind the World Heavyweight Championship. Estrada never appeared on-camera with the belt, as TNA's agreement with NWA only extended to the World Heavyweight and Tag Team championships. Instead, Estrada was booked as an underdog face against the heel group Sports Entertainment Xtreme (SEX). After he rejected their offer to join them, members of the group physically stripped Estrada of his costume during an assault. The leaders of SEX then debuted an overweight wrestler with the name Disgraceland to taunt Estrada, wearing his costume. Estrada defeated Disgraceland on the March 5, 2003 TNA pay-per-view and disappeared from TNA shortly after. He returned to the independent circuit, including some matches with IWA Mid-South. Estrada lost the North American Championship on May 3, 2003 to Hotstuff Hernandez in NWA Wildside. Personal life Moraza has a university degree in Criminal Justice Administration.

History The Los Angeles Basin was the ancestral land of the Tongva-Gabrieleño Native Americans for thousands of years. In other areas of the Los Angeles Basin archeological sites date back 8,000 to 15,000 years.[4] [5] Their first contact with Europeans was in 1542 with João Cabrilho (Juan Cabrillo), the Portuguese explorer who also was the first to write of them. Shwaanga, a very large Tongva settlement in the Harbor area, was also a departure point for rancherias on the Channel Islands. The water at Machado Lake was so clean that it used to be called \\"Sweet Water.\\" The Tongva lived in a virtual paradise for thousands of years, with good weather, an abundance of food and water, and plenty of resources. In 1542, the Spanish arrived in the Catalina (Pimu’nga) and San Pedro (Chaawenga, Palos Verdes- Chowiinga) harbor areas. Harbor City was originally part of the Rancho San Pedro, granted by the Spanish Empire in 1784 by King Carlos III to Juan Jose Dominguez. The rancho was divided and sold by Californios during the Spanish and Mexican periods of Alta California. After the Mexican-American war ended in 1848, many of the rancho lands were acquired by American settlers. Harbor City stands as a testament to the ambitious designs of the Anglo-American creators of the modern metropolis of Los Angeles. By around the start of the 20th century, city leaders had decided that it would be in the best interests of the city if the port and harbor areas were directly annexed. The independent cities of San Pedro (founded in the late 18th century) and Wilmington (founded in 1858 by Phineas Banning) were then-independent establishments of what would become the Port of Los Angeles. Following the establishment of San Pedro as the main source for the port in Santa Monica in 1897, Los Angeles city leaders argued that direct control over the port areas would be mutually beneficial by providing San Pedro and Wilmington with larger funding and in turn allowing the city to garner more revenue via the increasing port trade. The two cities were initially reluctant to join, but in 1906, frustrated by the indecision of San Pedro and Wilmington leaders, the city of Los Angeles purchased a long and narrow swath of land that connected then-South Los Angeles to San Pedro, naming the two regions Harbor Gateway and Harbor City. City leaders then threatened to build a new port in Harbor City if the recalcitrant towns would not acquiesce to annexation. Both agreed by 1909. In return, the city of Los Angeles elected to keep Harbor City as a land-locked part of the main city, linking the metropolis to its newly-won ocean trading centers. Landmarks Harbor City hosts a hospital and various medical buildings in the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, located along Pacific Coast Highway, between Normandie Ave. and Vermont Ave. The hospital is across from Ken Malloy Memorial Park. Education 18.1% of Harbor City's residents aged 25 or older had completed a four-year degree by 2000, an average figure when compared with the city and the county at large.

In its simplest form, it was the search for above-ground indications of oil, such as natural seeps. Creekologists also placed wells on singular points of a territory in accordance with landscape features. The placing of wells often occurred near, or on, linear objects - erosion relief forms (valleys, creeks, etc.) - giving rise to the term creekology. The success rates of some creekologists in the 19th century were very high - 80-90% of their wells gave production and more recent petroleum firms can only dream about such results. New creekology In the middle of the 20th century some geologists formed an idea about existing fault-fold systems in the earth's crust, in sediment cover, and this gave creekology a \\"scientific base\\". Linear forms in earth landscape connect with fault tectonics, and some folds near faults can be reservoirs of hydrocarbons. The non-fold types of traps mark by lineation too (paleo-rivers formed on faults). Now some geologists mark probable gas-oil areas with the help of space image lineation interpreting.

It is the sequel to the freeware game Ben There, Dan That! and was commercially released on June 22, 2009. As with the first game, Time Gentlemen, Please! was created using the Adventure Game Studio engine. The game features a darkly humorous, at points surrealistic setting. Of note is the consistent referencing of other classic adventure games: posters from Sam & Max and Full Throttle were seen in the first episode, the characters often quote dialog from e.g. Monkey Island or Day of the Tentacle, Ben refers to Dan as \\"the Glottis to my Manny!\\", and the first episode features a zombie child called Gilbert. The game also satirizes the \\"adventure game logic\\" (i.e. carrying around a variety of useless items in hopes of combining them to be useful), with Ben and Dan often breaking the fourth wall and directly referring to not needing certain items in their inventory. A sequel, Lair of the Clockwork God, was released in 2020. Plot In-game screenshot The events of Time Gentlemen, Please! continue from Ben There, Dan That!; in the first game, while attempting to rig a makeshift television antenna made out of a coathanger to watch a Magnum, P.I. marathon, Ben and Dan find themselves transported aboard an alien spacecraft. Eventually, they discover the spacecraft was simply a mockup built in a warehouse, designed to keep them busy. The plan was crafted by the future selves of Ben and Dan, who had traveled back in time to install their earlier selves as leaders of a mind- washed world. Time Gentlemen, Please! continues from this point; Ben and Dan accidentally convince the world to simply watch the Magnum, P.I. marathon, eventually killing off the entire world population. Realizing this was a mistake, they decide they must go back in time and prevent the creation of the coathanger such that their future selves would have never been able to teleport them to the fake alien craft. After discovering the time device their future selves used, they spend two weeks (relative to themselves) travelling through time to attempt to correct their error, but instead find themselves having made things worse, as in 1945, Adolf Hitler has come to rule the world with his army of anthropomorphic dinosaurs due to the power of the Golden Coathanger. Hitler captures the two and takes the time device away, using it to further assure his power but further damaging the time stream. Ben and Dan work through the time paradoxes in order to defeat Hitler and recover the time device. Realizing now that preventing the creation of the coathanger is disastrous, the two go back in time and stop their earlier selves before the coathanger is invented. However, this creates yet another paradox and causes the universe to disappear. God appears to the two, noting how they have mucked about too much in the timelines and that he will have to reset the universe for them. The two find themselves back at their flat and their world returned to normal.  Development  The game was designed by Dan Marshall and Ben Ward.  Reception  Critics mostly praised the game for its humour and writing, while its scatalogical humour and swearing were \\"not for everybody\\". IGN named the game one of the \\"best of 2009 so far\\" in August 2009. PC Zone magazine in the UK said: “It's one of the most outrageous games I've ever played and for that alone I love it.” IT Reviews gave it a Recommended award, and commented that “the puzzles are pitched so adeptly that they're almost always satisfying to solve with nary a hint of frustration. This fact, plus all the laughs, the slabs of layered-on sarcasm and the wonderfully off-the- wall plot, makes Time Gentlemen Please a joy to meander through.”  References   External links  * Game entry on the Adventure Game Studio database Category:2009 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Adventure Game Studio games Category:AGS Award winners Category:Indie video games Category:Point-and-click adventure games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games about time travel Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ","title":"Time Gentlemen, Please!

Drawn into the long legal struggle between Richard Bentley and the fellowship of Trinity College, Cambridge, he became a chief opponent and spent a short time in prison for a tactless court appearance. Early life and career Colbatch was the son of John Colbatch of Ludlow, Shropshire. He was educated at St. Peter's, Westminster, and was admitted as a scholar in 1680. He then proceeded to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1683. He became Fellow of his college, proceeding B.A. in 1686. On first taking orders he was appointed chaplain to the British factory at Lisbon, where he remained around seven years, and wrote, at the request of Gilbert Burnet, an Account of the State of Religion and Literature in Portugal for which he received promises of preferment from the bishop and from Queen Mary. He returned to England to prepare for Trinity College Gilbert Burnet the younger, the bishop's second son, and in 1701, by the good offices of Bentley, was selected by the Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset, chancellor of Cambridge University, as tutor to his eldest son, the Earl of Hertford. After two years at Cambridge Colbatch was persuaded by the duke to travel on the Grand Tour two years more with his pupil, but in the end of the tour the duke suddenly quarrelled with him and dismissed him from his post, allowing him only his bare salary less expenses, and passing harsh reflections on his character. These reflections the duke was persuaded by Bentley to retract, but he did not fulfil promises of preferment. Burnet's patronage resulted only in a prebend's stall at Salisbury worth £20 yearly, and Colbatch returned to Cambridge at the age of forty disappointed. His university, however, elected him Professor of Casuistical Divinity in 1707, and his lectures on moral philosophy brought him a reputation. Feud with Bentley Residence at Cambridge as fellow of Trinity involved him in the feud between the master and fellows of Trinity College. Colbatch at first was a moderate, and published a pamphlet in defence of Bentley's contention that any B.D. or D.D. should, for college rooms or a college living, have priority over a master of arts. After the death of John Moore, bishop of Ely and Visitor, in 1714, he felt it impossible to remain neutral in the quarrel, and his refusal in that year of Bentley's offer of the vice-mastership of the college began his long contest with the master. He took the lead of the fellows in the efforts made to cause William Fleetwood, Moore's successor, to move against Bentley, and in 1716 came to an open rupture with the master, because he refused to accede to his claim to the vice-mastership. In 1720 there was another public quarrel between them, in which Colbatch had the best of it, and forced Bentley to agree to appointing him to the college living of Orwell, Cambridgeshire, which he held till his death. In 1720 also Bentley published a pamphlet violently abusing Colbatch, to whom he erroneously attributed Conyers Middleton's attack on his proposals for a new edition of the Greek Testament. Colbatch endeavoured to get damages in the courts for this libel. In 1722 he issued a tract entitled Jus Academicum, in which his irritation at the failure to bring Bentley to justice led him to use certain expressions questioning the authority of the court of king's bench over the university. For this Bentley brought an action. Unfortunately for Colbatch the judge imagined that certain barbs intended for Bentley were aspersions on the court of king's bench, and Colbatch, owing partly to his own want of tact at the trial in 1723, was fined £50 and imprisoned for a week. In 1727 Bentley presented him with the old college clock for his church at Orwell, the one instance of a soothing effort during the quarrel. In 1729 Colbatch published, and in 1732 republished, a tract which finally was entitled A Defence of the Lord Bishop of Ely's Visitatorial Jurisdiction over Trinity College in general, and over the Master thereof in particular. In 1738 he was prosecuted by Bentley as archdeacon of Ely, because he refused fees due to the archdeacon at his visitation. The archdeacon had ceased to visit, but the fees nevertheless were usually paid. Colbatch was defeated in the courts, but argued for his course of action in a pamphlet entitled The Case of Proxies payable to Ecclesiastical Visitors. Death and legacy In 1733 he wrote An Examination of the late Archdeacon Echard's Account of the Marriage Treaty between King Charles II and Queen Catharine, Infanta of Portugal, defending Laurence Echard against Lord Lansdowne's criticisms. He died in Cambridge on 11 February 1748. He left £30 a year to a charity school at Orwell, and was during his lifetime a considerable benefactor to the church.

It is freeware and was released on July 14, 2008 for Windows. The game was positively received by critics, who enjoyed the game's humor but criticized its short length and lack of music. Two sequels have been released: Time Gentlemen, Please! in 2009 and Lair of the Clockwork God in 2020.  Gameplay  The game puts players in control of two characters named Ben and Dan, styled after the game's creators. They must complete inventory-based puzzles in order to unlock doors to various dimensions aboard an alien spaceship and return home. Players can swap between the characters in order to have them work together.  Plot  The game begins in a London flat, where the roommates Ben and Dan are unable to get television reception to watch Magnum, P.I., having broke their antenna in a previous adventure. Their attempt to assemble a replacement results in an inadvertent alien abduction. Trapped on the alien spaceship, they realize that the only way to return home is by opening doors to various universes and finding the key to the next door from within that universe. These include Zombie London, Dinosaur London, and a London which has become the 51st State. At the end of the game, they realize that the spaceship was actually just a fake and that it is located in a warehouse. It was a trick created by their time-traveling future selves, who had disguised themselves as aliens, to keep them from interrupting their plans for world domination.  Development  The game was designed by Dan Marshall and Ben Ward. They were roommates at the time of the game's development, with the game being designed in a pub.  Reception  Jim Squires of Gamezebo rated the game 4/5 stars, calling the dialogue \\"brilliantly written\\" and saying that it \\"keep[s] you laughing the whole time\\". He criticized the lack of puzzle difficulty, as well as its short length and lack of music. He called the writing \\"distinctly British\\" and said that despite being inspired by family-friendly games, the game was \\"best left to adults\\" due to its \\"racy\\" humor. Luke Jensen of Adventure Gamers called the game \\"unique and hilarious\\".

It was built in 1724 to the designs of the architect François Debias- Aubry for François Duret, a real estate entrepreneur, who was also president of the Grand Conseil. In 1726 Duret sold it to Françoise de Mailly (widow of Louis Phélypeaux, Marquis de La Vrillière), who allowed her son, Louis Phélypeaux, Count of Saint-Florentin to stay on the upper floor (premier étage). Françoise sold it to Louise-Elisabeth de Bourbon, Princesse de Conti in 1733, and it became known as the Hôtel de Conti. It was sold to Louis- Marie-Athanase of Loménie, Count of Brienne in 1776, when it acquired its current name. Laetizia Bonaparte, Napoleon's mother (Madame Mère), lived here during the First French Empire, and Charles de Gaulle used it as his office at various times during the Second World War. It is currently occupied by the French Ministry of the Armed Forces.Gallet 1995, p. 172; Lehrer 2013, pp. 85–87; Gady 2008, p. 207. Gady states it was constructed in 1718. History Louise Élisabeth de Bourbon, princesse de Conti, Pierre Gobert. The Hôtel de Brienne was constructed during the reign of Louis XV of France, in 1724; it was built by François Debias-Aubry for François Duret, the President of the Grand Conseil. Duret was a friend of the Marquise de Prie, mistress of Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon (Prime minister of France and another Prince of the Blood). Duret had been ordered to construct it by Madame de Prie who was looking for a suitable residence in Paris. In 1726, the Duke of Bourbon lost favour at Versailles and was exiled to his residence at Chantilly. Following this change of events, the hotel was sold to the widowed Françoise de Mailly, wife of the dead marquis de La Vrillière. Madame de La Vrillière lived at Brienne till 1733 when it was sold to the sister of the disgraced Duke of Bourbon. The Hôtel de Conti on the 1739 Turgot map of Paris Louise Élisabeth de Bourbon, Dowager Princess of Conti bought the hôtel and had the interior designed by the then fashionable interior designer Nicolas Simonnet. The new hôtel was near the Palais Bourbon, built by Louise Élisabeth's mother known as Madame la Duchesse Douairière. The hotel would be named after the Conti family till 1776, following death of the Dowager Princess in the previous year, when it was sold to the Comte de Briene. It was from him that the present building takes its name. Monsieur de Brienne had bought the property from Louise Élisabeth's grandson Louis François I de Bourbon in late 1775, moving in the next year. Monsieur de Brienne was executed during The Terror and the building was seized by revolutionaries making the building one of the central places of administration. Under that period it was known as the Commission du commerce et de l'approvisionnement. In 1795, the property was returned to the widowed Comtesse de Brienne. It was then sold to the wife of François Séguy, a businessman related to the military. The building then underwent many changes under the direction of the architect Lavoyepierre. Victims of financial difficulties, the Séguy couple quickly separated from their new acquisition. In 1800, the hôtel awarded by a court to Joseph Lanfrey, who rent it to Lucien Bonaparte, then Minister of the Interior, and Napoléon's brother. In 1802, Lucien Bonaparte, acquired the property and again had it redesigned. Three years later in 1805 he sold it to his mother Maria Letizia Ramolino. That is why during the reign of Napoléon, the edifice became known as the le Palais de Madame, Mère de l'Empereur (the Palace of Madame, Emperor's Mother). Bought from Madame Mère by the state in 1817, the hôtel de Brienne became the home of the Ministry of War. In 1917, during the First World War, Clémenceau then head of the French government, worked on the final victory within its walls. Charles de Gaulle, also worked in the hôtel. First as the secretary of State in June 1940, then as the chief of the provisional government in August 1944 till January 1946. The building is still the home of the Minister of the Armed Forces.

The episode aired on February 23, 2010, on ABC in the United States and 2 hours earlier on A in Canada due to the 2010 Winter Olympics. The episode was written by showrunners and executive producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse and was directed by Jack Bender. Jack Shephard is the character centered on this episode. In 2007, the ghost of Jacob (Mark Pellegrino) instructs Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) to bring Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) to an unspecified place. Meanwhile, Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) finds Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) after 3 years of disappearance, but begins to question her sanity. In the \\"flash-sideways\\", Jack deals with the issues of parenthood. Plot 2004 (flash-sideways timeline) Following the events of the season premiere, \\"LA X\\", Jack Shephard arrives late to pick up his son, David (Dylan Minnette), from school. David is shown to be distant from his father. Jack visits his mother (Veronica Hamel) to help find Jack's father's will, leaving David alone. Jack and his mother discuss David; his mother reveals that David was quite upset at his grandfather's funeral, but he never showed it to Jack. She suggests that perhaps David is \\"terrified\\" of Jack, just as Jack was afraid of his father as a child, and recommends Jack ask David about this. Finally, they find the will, but are confused to see Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) included in it; unbeknownst to them, Claire is Jack's half-sister. Jack returns home to find that David has snuck out. Jack goes to David's mother's house; his mother is absent but Jack learns that David is at an important piano recital. Jack goes to the conservatory where David is performing a stunning interpretation of Chopin's Fantaisie-Impromptu on the piano. Jack also runs into Dogen (Hiroyuki Sanada), another parent at the event, who praises David's skill and believes he has a gift. Afterward, David admits that he didn't tell Jack about the recital for fear of disappointing him. Jack explains his complicated relationship with his father and reassures his son that he can never be a disappointment to him; David appears to warm up to his father now. 2007 (original timeline) Following the events of the episode \\"What Kate Does\\", at the Others' temple, Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) is approached by the ghost of the deceased Jacob (Mark Pellegrino), who tasks Hurley on a mission to lead Jack to an unspecified location on the island in order to aid the arrival of someone en route to the island. Hurley has free rein to complete the mission because he is a candidate and even Dogen cannot stop him. Hurley uses the phrase \\"you have what it takes\\" to recruit Jack. Along the way, Jack and Hurley encounter Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), who tells them that she will neither return to the temple nor go with them, but continue her search for Claire. Jack and Hurley eventually pass through the caves, encountering the \\"Adam & Eve\\" skeletons and Jack's father's coffin. Hurley speculates that due to time travel, the skeletons could be someone they know in the present. Jack and Hurley arrive at a lighthouse, at the top of which is a large dial and a series of mirrors lined up. Each notch on the dial has a name listed next to it, corresponding to the surnames and numbers seen in \\"The Substitute\\". Hurley begins to move the dial to 108 degrees as instructed by Jacob, but Jack turns the dial to the 23 mark, where his own surname is listed, revealing Jack's childhood home in the reflection; Jack realizes that Jacob has been watching all of them for a long time, and becomes extremely upset. He angrily interrogates Hurley, who is unable to answer any of his questions since he cannot control when Jacob appears to him, leading Jack to destroy the mirrors. Outside, Jacob reappears to Hurley, congratulating him on bringing Jack to the lighthouse. Hurley realizes that Jacob did not want them to send a signal from the lighthouse, but instead needed Jack to see into the mirror and realize that he is important to the Island. Jacob also divulges that he needed to get Jack and Hurley away from the temple because \\"someone bad\\" was coming there. At the same time, Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) is rescued by Claire from her trap, taking him and an injured Other, Justin, to her hideout. Claire reveals she's been living on the island in the 3 years since Jin and everyone else's departure. She treats Jin's leg injury and then threatens to kill Justin (whom she captures after he pretended to be dead) unless he tells her the location of her son Aaron. Justin helplessly says that he has no idea where Aaron is and the Others never kidnapped him. Claire believes that the Others have her baby because both her father and \\"her friend\\" told her so. Jin informs her that Kate has been raising Aaron off the island. Claire murders Justin, regardless, claiming he would do the same to her given the chance. Jin then claims that he was lying about Aaron earlier, leading Claire to say she would have killed Kate if it were true (Kate really did take Aaron, Jin lied saying that he lied). Later, Claire's \\"friend\\", who turns out to be the Man in Black impersonating John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), shows up as Jin and Claire discuss how to return to the temple.

Noel Murray of The A.V. Club praised the episode, and gave the episode a grade of A-. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a positive review as well, stating \\"tonight's episode, “Lighthouse,” was not as awesome as last week's episode, “The Substitute,” nor was it as mind-melting as the season premiere, “LA X.” But it was certainly better than “What Kate Does\\" ...

Also, Eric Deggans of St. Petersburg Times gave the episode a negative review, criticizing Jack's storylines while praising Claire's, \\"this is the new rhythm for Lost's final season; one groundbreaking episode filled with revelations and amazing characterizations, followed by an episode so static it feels as if the show is running in place … interesting moments came when it turned to the story of Claire in the post-crash timeline.\\" IGN ranked the episode 41st out of the 115 Lost episodes, noting that \\"the answers still weren't coming this early in Season 6, much to the confusion of fans everywhere\\", while the Los Angeles Times ranked \\"Lighthouse\\" as the 91st, saying it was \\"a hotly divisive episode\\" but \\"improves the more the show fills in the gaps around it and the more the show makes Jack the center of its final season.\\" References External links *\\"Lighthouse\\" at ABC  Category:Lost (season 6) episodes Category:2010 American television episodes Category:Television episodes written by Damon Lindelof Category:Works set in lighthouses ","title":"Lighthouse (Lost)"},{"id":"24715213","text":"Naila or Na'ila (ِArabic: نائلة) is female given name of Arabic origin meaning The attainer, the achiever and the successful one.

It is a member of the Leigh deanery in the archdeaconry of Salford, diocese of Manchester. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. Leigh was in the Diocese of Lichfield and Coventry until 1541 when it was transferred to the Diocese of Chester. In 1847 Leigh became the only parish in the Hundred of West Derby to be part of the new Diocese of Manchester. Leigh has had its own deanery since 1933. Before that it was part of the deanery of Eccles and prior to that Warrington.A Guide to Leigh Parish Church, page 2 History St. Mary's is in the centre of Leigh by the Civic Square, which was originally the market place, next to the library and opposite the town hall. The church was mentioned in documents in the 13th century but the date of its foundation is uncertain. The first church on the site, dedicated to St Peter, was described as the Church of Westleigh in Leigh. Its dedication was changed to St Mary the Virgin at the end of the 14th century. The church straddled the ancient boundary between the townships of Westleigh and Pennington, the nave and churchyard in Westleigh and the chancel in Pennington.Farrer, Brownbill, 1907, pages 413–421 For several hundred years it was the mother church for the six townships, Westleigh, Pennington, Bedford, Astley, Atherton and Tyldesley, that made up the ancient ecclesiastical parish. For baptisms, marriages and funerals the population of the townships had to travel to St Mary's or else churches that lay outside the parish boundaries, such as St Mary's Deane, All Saint's Church in Wigan or St Mary the Virgin Eccles. The first Astley Chapel was built as a chapel of ease and consecrated in 1631. A second chapel of ease dedicated to St John the Baptist at Chowbent was built in 1645 by John Atherton but not consecrated until 1723. A third daughter church, St George's Church, Tyldesley, was consecrated in 1825, St Thomas in Bedford was built in 1840 and Christ Church, Pennington in 1854. The early history of the church was linked with the Westleigh family who were Lords of the Manor of Westleigh. John de Westleigh was parish priest in the reign of King John (1199–1216). The church was probably rebuilt during the 15th century. The tower dates from about 1500. A chantry chapel dedicated to St Nicholas, known as the Tyldesley Chapel occupied the east end of the north aisle and the Atherton Chapel, dedicated to St Mary the eastern end of the south aisle. The tower was restored twice, once in 1721 and again in 1849. By the late-1860s the church had become unsafe. In 1871–73 the church, apart from the tower, was rebuilt by the Lancaster architects Paley and Austin at a cost of £8,738 (), providing seating for 710 people. James Fraser, Bishop of Manchester reconsecrated the building in February 1873. In 1890, the successors on the Lancaster practice, Paley, Austin and Paley, refitted the chancel, including the provision of an altar and reredos. In 1909–10 the same practice, then known as Austin and Paley, added a choir vestry to the north of the church, and recased the tower. During the 1871–73 reconstruction the date 1616 was found on a roof beam but it is thought the roof of the St Nicholas or Tyldesley Chapel which was restored and reused dates from about 1500. Sir Thomas Tyldesley was buried here after his death in the Battle of Wigan Lane. James Irvine, vicar, was so anti \\"non- conformist\\" that he refused burial or blessing of those, including children, that had died and required a final resting place. Structure 18th century brass candelabra The church was rebuilt on the foundations of the original church in hammer-dressed sandstone in the Gothic Revival Perpendicular style. The church has a six-bay nave and two-bay chancel under a continuous roof with a clerestory and crenellated parapet. The bays have three-light aisle windows with rectilinear tracery and hoodmoulds, the clerestory windows have two-light flat-headed arches. There are octagonal pinnacled piers at the east corners of the chancel, either side of the five-light east window. The tower, is also castellated retaining the 16th century studded oak west doors beneath an elliptical arch. The tower has weathered diagonal buttresses and a three-light west window. There are two-light belfry openings on all sides below the clock faces. The north vestry dates from 1910 by the same architects. Nikolaus Pevsner describes the six bay interior with octagonal piers as being \\"impressive in scale\\". The roofline of the previous church is visible on the wall of the tower inside the church. Fittings and furniture The Speakman Window The tower has a ring of eight bells. Six were cast in 1740 by Abel Rudhall of Gloucester and the treble and second were cast in 1761, also by Rudhall's. These bells replace four bells reputed to have been given by Queen Elizabeth I. Two of the earlier bells were cast in Leigh in 1692 and 1705.A Guide to Leigh Parish Church, page 7 In March 2010 the bells were taken down for transportation to Dorset where they were restored at a cost of £30,000. The north aisle roof is re-used from the old church whilst the nave has a hammer beam roof. Pevsner describes the reredos and altar designed by Austin and Paley as \\"extremely handsome\\" and \\"gorgeously painted\\" in gold, red and green by Shrigley and Hunt. Stained glass windows installed between 1887 and 1933 in the Lady chapel, south aisle and several in north aisle are also by Shrigley and Hunt while others including the east window are by Charles Eamer Kempe. The Speakman window is of interest as it depicts scenes from the industries on which Leigh was built, panels include weavers, engineers and colliers.A Guide to Leigh Parish Church, page 5 The organ case of 1910 is by Austin and Paley and from the old church there is a 1777 organ case by Samuel Green of London preserved on the vestry side of the church. The three manual organ was made in 1776–78 by Samuel Green, and repaired between 1807 and 1877 by Vincent of Liverpool. It was rebuilt in 1911 by Harrison & Harrison, using some of the original stops. In 1964 the pedal division was enlarged by the same company. The organ has been granted a Historic Organ Certificate Grade II*. Wooden fittings also saved from the earlier church include an altar table of 1705 by Thomas Naylor in the Lady Chapel and oak canopies from the churchwardens seats of 1686. Over the nave near the tower is an 18th-century brass chandelier, \\"a cut above the norm\\" according to Pevsner, which was retained from the old church and converted to electricity. External features The 18th-century boundary wall, gates and gate piers of the churchyard are designated as a Grade II listed building.

IN THE ADJOINING BUILDING LIVED OLIVER STARKEY LATIN SECRETARY TO GRAND MASTER VILETTE AND TURCOPILIER OF THE ORDER AT THE TIME OF THE GREAT SIEGE IN 1565 Sir Oliver Starkey (c.1523-83/86), was an English knight who lived in the 16th century. He was the only English knight present at the siege of Malta,. It was wrongly assumed that he was buried in the crypt of St. John's Co-Cathedral in Valletta. The tombstone with his name on it contains only a poem written by Oliver Starkey for Grand Master Jean de Valette. The Poem reads, in translation:'To God, Supreme, Almighty, Sacrosanct. He [De Valette] was the dread of Asia and Libya and once the guardian of Europe, after he had subdued the Turks by means of his Sacred Arms, the first one to lie buried in the grave, here in this propitious city of Valletta which he founded, worthy of eternal honour. Fra. Oliver Starkey, Pro-Turcopolier, wrote [this] poem.' He was MP for St Alban's in April and November 1554. Biography Oliver Starkey’s' parentage is set out in the depositions of witnesses in a chancery case begun by him in 1546, soon after his father’s death. He was born in Antwerp, where his father was in the service of Sir Thomas Baldry, ‘at which time the said Roger kept the mother of the said Oliver as his harlot not being at any time married together'. Although there are other possibilities the strongest evidence is that he was the illegitimate son of Hugh Starkey of the township of Oulton Lowe in the ancient Cheshire parish of Over and that he was born in the 1520s. Hugh Starkey had fought at the battle of Flodden and subsequently had connections with the court of Henry VIII. In about 1550 Oliver Starkey was admitted to the Order of the Knights of Malta. In 1558 he was involved in the establishment of the English Langue of the Order and in November of that year was appointed as a joint proctor of the Langue. In 1560 he was elected to be Lieutenant Turcopolier of the Order. The following year he was authorised to establish an English Auberge in Birgu, and he lived in the house next door. Starkey was involved in the siege of Malta which lasted from May to September 1565, and was the only English knight to have played a part in it. As Lieutenant Turcopolier he was responsible for a section of the coastal defences around Birgu. At the same time he was Latin Secretary to the contemporary Grand Master, Jean Parisot de la Valette. Valette died in 1568 and ten years later his remains were moved to a tomb in the crypt of the newly completed co- cathedral of St John. Starkey composed the Latin inscription on his tomb. In 1569 he was appointed Bailiff of Eagle, the fourth highest dignity in the English Langue and in 1578 he was made Grand Prior of the Order of St. John in England. He continued to carry out further duties for the Order, serving under a total of four Grand Masters, until he died in the spring of 1588. He was also commander of Quenington, Gloucestershire which the position was given to him by Cardinal Pole.

Compared to other allosauroids, neovenatorids had short, wide shoulder blades, and their ilia (upper hip bones) had many cavities. They lived in Africa, Asia, Europe, South America and North America. Classification Phylogenetic studies conducted by Benson, Carrano and Brusatte (2010) and Carrano, Benson and Sampson (2012) recovered the group Megaraptora as members of the Neovenatoridae. This would make neovenatorids the latest-surviving allosauroids; at least one megaraptoran, Orkoraptor, lived near the end of the Mesozoic era, dating to the early Maastrichtian stage of the latest Cretaceous period, about 70 million years ago. On the other hand, Novas et al. (2012), while confirming that Neovenator was closely related to carcharodontosaurids, simultaneously found Megaraptor and related genera to be coelurosaurs closely related to tyrannosaurids. However, Novas et al. subsequently found that megaraptorans lacked most of the key features in the hands of derived coelurosaurs including Guanlong and Deinonychus. Instead, their hands retain a number of primitive characteristics seen in basal tetanurans such as Allosaurus. Nevertheless, there are still a number of traits that support megaraptorans as members of the Coelurosauria. The cladogram below follows a 2016 analysis by Sebastián Apesteguía, Nathan D.

Early life  Krishna Sastry was born on 23 October 1934, Chirivada, Krishna District, Andhra Pradesh, India to Veluri Partha Sarathi and Veluri Anasuya. He graduated from Gudivada College in Krishna District, Andhra Pradesh, and received his master's degree from Osmania University, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India. He received his PhD from Karnataka University, Dharvar, Karnataka, India. Sastry's name is associated with almost all the developments and achievements in the archaeology of Andhra Pradesh that happened from the 1970s to the 1990s. He is credited with the identification of a large number of prehistoric, historic and Buddhist sites in Andhra Pradesh. He is also considered the Grand Father of Nizam-Telangana History or Nizam-Telangana Charithra Pitamahudu.http://namasthetelangaana.com/columnists/MALLESHAM- CHILLA.aspx?category=1&subCategory;=7&ContentId;=143077#.VKliDcl8cRI He is remembered for his scholarly works on Telugu history,both in his birth state of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana State. The man was a legend for his unmatchable contributions to the history of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Sastry wrote over one-hundred papers in numerous research journals, and has also published ten books in his field. A festschrift in his honour was edited by P. Chenna Reddy.  Career as an archaeologist  Sastry started his career as a scholar trainee at Nagarjunakonda with the Archaeological Survey of India, in 1959. 1961–68 he worked as a technical assistant for the State Department of Archaeology and Museums, Andhra Pradesh. 1968–79 Sastry worked as assistant director of archaeological excavations at the Department of Archaeology and Museums and as chief technical officer at the Department of Archaeology and Museums, from 1979–81. From 1981–92 he worked as director of the Department of Archaeology and Museums. From 1989 to 1991 he also officiated as director of State Archives and Oriental Manuscripts Library. Sastry unraveled the mysteries in some of the most important Buddhist sites at Chandavaram in Prakasam District, Kesanapalli in Guntur District, Dhulikatta and Kotilingala in Karimnagar district. Sastry proved through his excavation that Keesaragutta in Medchal Taluq of Rangareddy District was ruled by Chalukyas during the post-Satavahana times of 4th–5th centuries AD. The Buddhist sites excavated by Sastry on the hilltops of Totlakonda and Bavikonda are now developed as tourist centers by the Indian Government. Some of the ancient temples once situated in the submerged area of Srisailam have been reconstructed in the newly built villages Somasila, Erladinne, Siddheswaram, Bhujangeswaram, and Kyatur. They stand as testimonies to the planning and execution skills of Sastry. Sastry's efforts in establishing museums resulted in the construction and opening up of district museums at Anantapur, Warangal, Nalgonda, Kurnool and the site museums at Chandavaram. The district museum of Nalgonda built adjacent to Pachchala Someswara temple at Panugal has now grown to be an important tourist attraction.

She made her first appearance in 2010's Super Street Fighter IV. In the series, she is a South Korean Taekwondo fighter employed by S.I.N. and an underling to the main antagonist of Street Fighter IV, Seth. Juri originated as a suggestion to introduce a female Korean character in the Street Fighter series and the development team went through 400–500 ideas before they decided on Juri. She is the first practitioner of Taekwondo and the first Korean character in the series. Juri has been described as \\"sultry\\", \\"provocative\\" and \\"sex-crazed\\", and she is unique within the series due to her practice of Taekwondo. Character design Juri's character concept was created from a suggestion by Yoshinori Ono to introduce a female Korean character into the Street Fighter series, with the initial design selected from 400-500 ideas, amongst which included an old woman and an ice skater. The final concept was intended to be someone \\"bad and somewhat erotic,\\" with Taekwondo selected as her martial art over suggestions such as a sports-themed style, due to its lack of representation in the series and feeling that a character that used primarily kicks could be interesting. A mixed martial arts style was also considered, but the team chose to focus on a more iconic fighting style. Ono stated that they were planning on adding a Korean character since soon after Street Fighter II became popular in Korea. However, the Korean government had a strict limitation against the Japanese language and culture, preventing them from including such a character. Tekken has had Korean characters since 1995, Fatal Fury has had Korean characters since 1992, so this excuse of the Korean government limitations might not be accurate. After the release of Street Fighter IV, Capcom Korea demanded to Ono that should another Street Fighter game be released, that it include a Korean character. While other fighting games had Korean characters already, Capcom Korea and Korean fighting game fans held the sentiment that it didn't matter \\"unless there was one in the series that started it all.\\" Ono commented that when a new character is introduced, \\"you want to make them a good guy, you know a 'fighter for justice' or a 'friend of good' so to speak, but this time we decided to go kind of a different route with this character.\\" He went on to describe her as \\"kind of nasty, she's kind of mean—somewhat twisted in fact.\\" The developers debated which of the game's villains to align her with, M. Bison or Seth, before settling on the latter due to her being a new addition to the series. Juri's shirt was modeled after a spider, and left the sides of her breasts exposed at Ono's suggestion. Her pants were designed to give a \\"silhouette that looks like a Taekwondo uniform.\\" The black trim on her pants was added to set her apart from other Street Fighter characters who wear similar uniforms. Her colour scheme was originally plain. However, when lined up with other characters, she didn't stand out; as a result, they employed hot pink, a colour not used in any other female character in the game. They added black details to her outfit to make it less \\"frivolous.\\" A pink crystal, known as the Feng Shui Engine, was added as a replacement inside her left eye after deciding to align her with Seth, in order to more closely tie her character to the organization. The crystal was originally in her stomach, similar to Seth. Other ideas were considered, including having it in one of her palms, one of her legs, or one of her ankles. They eventually settled on putting it in her eye, with design director Kamei commenting that a \\"big globe in the stomach of a female character wasn't going to look very attractive.\\" He also commented that an eye is a logical place to have an artificial replacement, as well as already being spherical. Initially, Juri was designed to be chubbier and cuter. Gradually the design was made slimmer, though the team noted at some point they had realized they had overdone it and reversed the changes slightly. She was given full legs, and a slender upper body in order to show the contrast. Kamei wanted to make her even more slender, but decided that if she was too small, her kicks would lack impact. Several designs were considered for her face, going through about seven versions before settling on her current appearance, though time constraints played a part in the decision. Attention was paid to Taekwondo users in other fighting games in an attempt to keep the character fresh and original, implementing several actual techniques as a result but altering their appearance to make them different but recognizable, describing it as \\"her style.\\" Her projectile attacks were modeled after the concept of using ki from one's surroundings, which the developers joking compared to Dragon Balls Goku's \\"spirit bomb\\" attack. However, it was noted that her use of ki was different from that by the developers due to coming from a man-made device. Developer Tamamura suggested that in order to make it look unique, they should make it \\"cotton candy-like.\\" He explained that as opposed to using energy from nature, Juri would \\"forcibly taking nature’s power, twining it around, and throwing it out.\\" During the development of the game, several developers became fans of hers', with writer Kawasaki describing their fandom as being \\"I'm gonna use this character! She's so cool!\\" rather than them liking her just because they made the game. In response to fan complaints that Juri seemed too similar to previous character Chun-Li, Capcom responded by stating the two were nothing alike, and added that it would be like comparing two other male characters to one another simply because they utilized punches. Personality and attributes Juri's personality was proposed by Ono to be a strong character, and while laughing compared it to that of a protester. She was originally designed to be a nice person who happens to be consorting with bad characters, but Ono went against this, stating \\"she can't be a good girl. Surprise everyone and make her a really evil chick.\\" Her quotes were designed to have a lot of double entendres, with writer Kawasaki, citing one quote that while it appears as a compliment of their physique, her opponent may take offense to it. Initially, she was designed to be always smiling, similar to other female characters according to developer Kamei. However, it did not fit, resulting in the team working on other faces, some he describes as \\"scary.\\" The team eventually settled on a \\"cool-headed\\" look. Kamei commented that one of his favourite expressions of Juri's is the one she makes when she appears to be having fun; he adds that this look made him feel like the animators had finally began to understand the character. In designing her eyes, Kamei wanted her eyes to have more expression to them than other characters, commenting that the team \\"wanted her to tell a story with her eyes.\\" Because of the anger from Korean fans over the lack of a Korean character in Street Fighter, the team decided to make her a strong character. Juri is said to have a warlike and provocative character and enjoys playing around with her opponent while beating them. She has also been described in a similar fashion, including \\"sex-crazed\\" and \\"sultry.\\" Developer Tamamura describes her as a \\"pleasure-seeker\\" and a \\"character who would enjoy fighting.\\" Appearances Juri's first appearance in a video game has been in Super Street Fighter IV. At an early age, her parents were killed by Shadaloo agents, during which her left eye was damaged. Years later, she has become an agent of S.I.N. known as \\"Spider\\". She has a ki booster implanted inside her left eye called the . An anime centering on Juri, produced by Studio Gonzo and Afro Samurai director Fuminori Kizaki, was included in the Japanese Xbox 360 version of Super Street Fighter IV. Although having been fully dubbed in English, the film was not released outside of Asia until its inclusion as part of the Street Fighter 25th Anniversary Collector's Set in 2012. Juri appears as a playable character in the crossover fighting game Street Fighter X Tekken with her official tag partner, M. Bison. Juri also appears in the crossover tactical role-playing game Project X Zone, its sequel Project X Zone 2 and in the mobile puzzle game Street Fighter: Puzzle Spirits. Juri appears as a playable character in Street Fighter V; she was released via downloadable content in July 2016. She appears as part of the game's story mode, \\"A Shadow Falls\\", working with Helen's team to stop the Black Moons and foil Shadaloo's plans. In 2017, Juri appeared along with Bison and Cammy in Shadowverse. Gameplay Juri using her Feng Shui Engine technique. Juri's fighting style focuses on the \\"power and range\\" of kicks. As a practitioner of Taekwondo, she fights almost exclusively with her feet and rarely strikes with her hands. She has been described as \\"agile and quick, but with low stamina.\\" Street Fighter player Justin Wong described her as a unique character, comparing her to a \\"Guilty Gear type of character,\\" citing her dive kicks in part for this. GamePro editor Heidi Kemps commented that she is a character who is \\"geared towards competitive players who enjoy screwing with their opponents' minds just as much as they enjoy slugging them in the face.\\" GamesRadar also described her as a character who \\"functions best when she’s on the offensive and shutting down opponents before they can even get into position.\\" Developer Okada described her as a \\"hectic character,\\" a quality that the developers had decided on from the beginning. She was created with the intention of making players see her as a character with potential; Okada commented that he wanted to instill a feeling of \\"If I keep playing with this character, I bet I could do some really cool stuff\\" in players. Developer Tamamura commented that players of Yun and Yang from Street Fighter III would enjoy playing with her. Seth Killian, Capcom Special Advisor to Super Street Fighter IV, described Juri as \\"one of the most versatile characters.\\" He commented that she is a threat from mid-range as well as further away because of her dive kick, but theorized that characters like Zangief, Ryu, and Sagat would give Juri trouble due to their mobility and hard-hitting attacks. Juri has a number of special techniques; all of which utilize quarter-circle, shoryuken, and similar motions. These include a quick flip kick, a dive kick, and a technique called Fuhajin kick, which allows fireballs to be fired from her feet. These fireballs can be controlled by the strength of the kick input; depending on it, the fireballs will travel at different angles. Players may also store fireballs by holding down the kick button. 1UP.com editor Richard Li compared this mechanic to Gilgamesh's from Fate/Unlimited codes. Players may store three sets of fireballs by holding three buttons to charge them, choosing to release them in tandem or one-by-one. GamesRadar editor Brett Elston commented that while her dive kick was \\"so much fun that it’s almost irresistible,\\" it \\"shouldn't be your first choice every time you get into the air.\\" He adds that the move is so overused by Juri players that players can beat them without attacking. Juri's special attacks include the Senpusha wheel kick and the Shikusen triple air kick. Her ultra attacks include the Feng Shui Engine, which allows her normal attacks to chain upwards for a short time; and the Kaisen Dankairaku. In one of her ultra moves, she was intended to kiss the opponent's cheek, but this was toned down. Okada commented that other ideas were so extreme that the game would have needed a higher content rating. She also has a pinwheel kick attack, which acts as an \\"offensive chip damage\\" attack. In discussing the pinwheel kick, developer Tamamura commented that females in fighting games typically have attacks with several hits to them, describing this move as an example of how she likes to show off. A dodge technique was implemented as a means of reflecting her personality, with developer Okada stating that it is a move that \\"puts her opponent off balance.\\" He goes on to describe her as \\"one of the fastest and trickiest characters in Street Fighter history.\\" Merchandise and reception A resin statue of Juri was created by SOTA Toys and made available for the release of Super Street Fighter IV. Since appearing in Super Street Fighter IV, Juri was well received by critics. The Escapist described Juri as \\"jarring\\", praising Capcom for trying to take risks with the character design but at the same time questioning how well the character meshes with Street Fighter IVs main cast. In describing Juri, IGN editor Martin Robinson called her \\"quite awesome\\" and \\"SSFIVs best. IGN editor Ryan Clements stated that he was most excited to try out Juri, attributing this to his \\"recent fascination with K-pop.\\" He called her an \\"excellent addition to the roster\\" after playing a few rounds with her. Street Fighter player Justin Wong described her as \\"very unique\\", comparing her to Fatal Fury character Kim Kaphwan. GameSpot editor Ricardo Torres similarly compared her to Kim Kaphwan, also comparing her to fellow Street Fighter characters Rose and M. Bison. He also described her as an \\"amazingly flexible and sensibly dressed vixen.\\" G4TV editor Matt Keil called her Taekwondo-inspired play style \\"fascinating,\\" calling it \\"almost reminiscent of a King of Fighters character.\\" Game Informer editor Dan Ryckert called Juri his \\"personal favorite,\\" citing her fighting style. GamesRadar Michael Grimm chose Alisa Bosconovitch from the Tekken series as an opponent he would like to see Juri battle, commenting that Juri may be at a disadvantage since Alisa is an android and Juri a human. On the other hand, Dave Cook from Now Gamer listed Hwoarang as the opponent he wanted Juri to face as both have similar traits such as being Tae Kwon Do kickboxers. GamePro editor Heidi Kemps commented that \\"after spending time with her, I think I've found my new favorite Street Fighter IV character.\\" GameDaily editor Chris Buffa described Juri as a \\"wonderful addition.\\" Similarly, GameZone editor Dakota Grabowski gave \\"much love\\" to the addition of Juri to the Street Fighter universe. Hardcore Gamer editor Nicholas J. Martin praised Juri for bringing a \\"unique mix\\" to the series. UGO Networks placed Juri at #13 on their list of Top 50 Street Fighter Characters\\", stating \\"Juri is a fast and agile cyberneticaly enhanced fighter and during the course of Super Street Fighter IV\\". 1UP.com listed Juri as one of the characters they wanted to see in Street Fighter X Tekken, adding \\"Juri is arguably one of Capcom's best fighting games character designs to date and I'm sure I'm not the only one who wants to see her in more games\\". Complex ranked Juri as the \\"31st-most dominant fighting game character\\", stating \\"The Juri equation is simply Taekwondo + extra perverted creepiness + dat eye = Purple Swag Madness!\\" WhatCulture ranked Juri as the \\"10th-greatest female fighting game character of all time\\", commenting, \\"Arguably the greatest new addition to the Street Fighter family with the release of IV, Juri's leg-centric combat style fused with some handy psycho powers courtesy of M. Bison make her a joy to play.\\" While she is popular in North America and Japan, she has not proven to be \\"that popular\\" in Korea; Street Fighter developer Yoshinori Ono commented that he had received angry mail reading \\"Koreans don’t have hair like that!\\" He responded by saying that Street Fighter characters are generally not accurate to their respective origins, such as Blanka and Dhalsim. In GamesRadar article for Street Fighter X Tekken, they stated \\"Quite the femme fatale, Juri is a sensual villain who uses her augmented power to make herself the most evil woman in the Street Fighter universe.\\" Additionally, GamesRadar named Juri as one of the best new characters of 2010, stating \\"Juri's overall aesthetic appeal is quite strong even if you don’t spend hours a day honing mixups and perfecting your FADCs. Her bare stomach is an obvious center of attention, but we're more taken in by the violet colors, lens-flaring robo-eyeball and her spiderlike top that slithers across her shoulders.\\" A Character Popularity Poll made by Capcom in late 2017 revealed that Juri is the third most popular character in the Street Fighter franchise, only beaten by Sakura and Makoto.

18th-century English round game of cards for three to eight players derived from the French game of Matrimony and CometeDiagram Group The Little Giant Encyclopedia of Card Games pg. 130 Sterling (1995) and ancestor to Spinado and the less elaborate Newmarket.David Parlett, Oxford Dictionary of Card Games, pg. 221-222 Oxford University Press (1996) The game is related to the German Poch and French Nain Jaune. Although its first published rules appeared in Hoyle's Games edition of 1814, an earlier reference to the game, originally called Pope Julius,George Henry Townsend A manual of dates: A Dictionary of Reference Frederick Warne & Co. London (1867) appeared in The Oxford English Dictionary in 1732. Etymology The name is a corruption of \\"nain jaune\\" (yellow dwarf), the name of in France where the game originated.\\"Pope Joan\\", accessed 2017-11-09, http://www.parlettgames.uk/histocs/popejoan.html Pope Joan refers to the legend that Pope John VIII was actually a woman. As the Catholic Church denies a female pope, the legend was used as Protestant propaganda in the Victorian-Era, which also explains the popularity of the game in Scotland. The is sometimes called the Curse of Scotland. Setup A Pope Joan staking board A staking board is required, with eight compartments labelled Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Game, Pope (), Matrimony (K Q of trumps) and Intrigue (Q J of trumps). Each player receives a number of counters, or chips, whose value is determined by the players involved in the game. The is then removed from the pack to form a stop sequence, which classifies the game as a sub-group of the stop family of games. The aim of the game is to run out of cards before anyone else. Gameplay The dealer \\"dresses the board\\" by placing a stake of six counters in the compartment labelled Pope, two each to Matrimony and Intrigue, and one to each of the others. He then deals the 51 cards among the players as far as they go, but to one more hand than there are players, with the last card dealt to the dead hand turned for trumps. Cards in excess may be dealt to \\"stops,\\" or an agreed number may be left for that purpose, so that all players have an equal number of cards. If it is Pope (), or the Ace, King, Queen or Jack, the dealer wins the contents of the appropriate compartment outright. Eldest leads first playing a card face up to the table. It may be of any suit, as long as it is his lowest card. For this purpose, cards rank A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K. If he has the next higher card of the same suit, he plays it too, and so on until he can go no further. The sequence is then continued by the player who holds the next card up, and if no one can play the next card up because it is in the dead hand, or because a King has been reached, a new sequence is started by the player who played the last card (\\"stop card\\"). As before, it may be of any suit, but must be the lowest he has of it. All Kings are of course stops, also the seven of diamonds; also the cards next below the dealt stops, and the cards next below the played cards. The content (if any) staked to the Ace, King, Queen and Jack compartment goes to the player playing the said trump card, as does that for Pope. That for Intrigue can only be won if the same player is able to play Queen and Jack, as does Matrimony for King and Queen, if all three, those in the two compartments, and if they are in different hands these counters are sometimes divided. If any stake is not won, it is then carried forward to the next deal. The first to play out all of his cards wins the stake for Game, plus one counter from each other player for each card remaining in his hand, except the player holding the Pope who is excused payment. Strategy The game only requires minimal attention in order to know what stops have been made in the course of play. The Pope card is sometimes considered a universal \\"stop.\\" References External links *Pope-Joan at Trussel.com Category:18th-century card games Category:Stops group Category:English card games ","title":"Pope Joan (card game)"},{"id":"24715395","text":"Extent of Glasinac culture The Glasinac culture () or Glasinac group (Glasinačka grupa, Гласиначка група), was an Iron Age archaeological culture named after the Glasinac locality in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The southernmost point of these roadways is Kosckiuszko Circle. The roadways were added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 24, 2008. History Moakley Park, Day Boulevard, and the McCormack Bath House When Frederick Law Olmsted drafted his plans for Boston's Emerald Necklace of parks in the 1870s, it included the notion of a connection between Franklin Park and the coastline of South Boston and Dorchester, with a waterfront park area. The first formal proposal for the parkland that is now Joe Moakley Park and the causeway connecting Castle Island to the mainland were submitted by Olmsted in the 1880s. Implementation of these plans was delayed in part because Castle Island was still under federal military jurisdiction. Because of this, the causeway that opened in 1892 was separated from Castle Island by a drawbridge, and it was on that that the oldest of the parkways (originally Gardner Way, now the eastern half of Day Boulevard) was opened. The island would not be fully connected until the 1930s. The development of Joe Moakley Park and the surrounding parkways was planned as part of the connection between Franklin Park and Marine Park (the eastern end of Day Boulevard), with land takings beginning in the 1890s. Old Colony Avenue was laid out in 1898 on a former railroad right-of-way, but the Strandway (now the southern part of Day Boulevard) was not completed until the 1920s. Later aspects of this work were designed by Olmsted protege Arthur Shurcliff.

It offers many services to help hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers in need. History The Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty, also known as Met Council, was founded in 1972 after two studies reported 300,000 Jewish New Yorkers were living in poverty. The organization, whose original full name was Metropolitan New York Coordinating Council on Jewish Poverty, was formed with the cooperation of \\"36 national and grass-roots Jewish organizations,\\" including the American Jewish Congress and the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York. Although founded to help the Jewish poor, today Met Council's services help all New Yorkers, regardless of age, sex, religion, race or ethnicity. Mission and services The Federal poverty guidelines, based on a standard developed in the 1960s, do not consider regional differences in the cost of housing, transportation, and taxes. Even so, New York City has a poverty rate of 20%, well above the 12% national average. Met Council works to assist New Yorkers in need and raise awareness about the growing problem of Jewish poverty. The organization has eight main departments, each providing services that help New Yorkers who are struggling financially. Examples include the crisis intervention department which aids clients going through job loss, eviction, utility turn-off, medical needs and other emergencies. Career services leads workshops on job searches, resume skills, and interview preparation and has training programs for careers in healthcare. Met Council has the largest kosher food pantry in the United States, and it opened three kosher soup kitchens in partnership with Masbia. Partner organizations The Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty works with 25 local Jewish Community Councils and is affiliated with the UJA-Federation of New York. Met Council also partners with Food Bank For New York City, City Harvest and Masbia. Budgets and leadership Both the budgets and the leadership of the organization have seen downturns and recoveries,The number of non-key employees was 375 in 2014, vs. 236 in 2016 yet funding for Passover meals (verified with photo ID) has been relatively constant.Form 990 data: 2014: 2,794; 2017: 2,736; 2018: 2,591 88% - 92% of the money they distributed 2012 - 2018 was from grants and contributions. Jack Simcha Cohen was their first executive director. Controversies Former New York State Assembly speaker Sheldon Silver's chief of staff was the wife of former Met Council CEO William Rapfogel; the latter was arrested on charges of receiving $7 million in kickbacks over 21 years from the Met Council's insurance broker. Rapfogel was jailed, and Met Council was awarded restitution. Earlier that year former Met Council Executive Director David Cohen and Herbert Friedman, Chief Financial Officer, were arraigned in Manhattan Criminal Court on charges of grand larceny, money laundering, and conspiracy. They too were jailed. To ensure that this never happens again, in 2015 the Met Council hired a former federal prosecutor as their Chief Compliance Officer and General Counsel. New Leadership 2018 One of New York's highest-profile Jewish leaders, Councilman David Greenfield, announced in July 2017 that he would not run for re-election in order to assume the leadership of the Met Council and restore its role as the central Jewish charity in New York. Greenfield joined the organization as CEO on January 1, 2018 and has already instituted new initiatives including a new digital food pantry initiative to serve the more than 200,000 New Yorkers that rely on Met Council's food distribution network. After Greenfield joined, the UJA-Federation announced that they were partnering with the Met Council on their newly announced $35 million initiative to combat poverty. During the post-Passover CoronaVirus pandemic, more than one thousand Holocaust survivors benefited from a special program that focused on their specific needs.

The small Church of England parish church, begun in the 13th century, is dedicated to Saint Martin and is a Grade II* listed building.Church web page (Broad Chalke website) The population is now about 20,Fifield Bavant at pbase.com although it was 49 in 1831.Fifield Bavant at genuki.org.uk History Fragmentary records from Saxon times indicate that the Ebble valley was a thriving area. The Domesday Book in 1086 records the Chalke Valley as divided into eight manors, Chelke (Chalke - Broad Chalke and Bowerchalke), Eblesborne (Ebbesbourne Wake), Fifehide (Fifield Bavant), Cumbe (Coombe Bissett), Humitone (Homington), Odestoche (Odstock), Stradford (Stratford Tony and Bishopstone) and Trow (circa Alvediston).Ebbesbourne Wake through the Ages by Peter Meers The name of Fifield Bavant has evolved over the centuries. The Domesday Book records the manor as Fifehide (probably representing Five Hides). By 1264 it was called Fifield Scudamore because Peter de Scudamore was lord of the manor. By 1463 it was recorded as Fiffehyde Beaufaunt when ownership had passed to the Beaufaunt family, later usually spelt Bavant. The name Fifehide probably derives from 'five hides'. A hide was once an area of land which would support a household, varying according to time and place and land quality, but typically ranging from 40 to 160 acres, or 16 to 65 hectares. Later in Anglo-Saxon England it was a unit used for assessing land tax. Peter Meers, in his book Ebbesbourne Wake through the Ages, translates Fifield's Domesday entry as: > Alvred [of Marleborough] holds Fifehide, Ralph from him. TRE it paid tax for > five hides. Land for four ploughs. In lordship three hides, there one plough > and three slaves. Nine villagers (villeins) and six smallholders (bordars) > with two ploughs. Two acres of meadow, pasture half a league long and half a > furlong wide. Value £4, now £5. One forge pays 12d a year and two Wilton > burgesses pay 18d. Woolmaer holds one hide from Alvred, the same person held > it TRE, it was and is worth 10s. In 1840, Samuel Lewis's Topographical Dictionary said of the parish: Fifield Bavant was a separate civil parish for eight centuries. In 1885, it lost its southern area of some 283 acres to Bowerchalke, and in 1894 the parish was extinguished, when the remaining 870 acres of the northern part were annexed to Ebbesbourne Wake. In 1923 the separate ecclesiastical parish also came to an end, when the benefice of St Martin's was united with that of St John the Baptist in Ebbesbourne. The parish registers, held in the Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre, record christenings from 1696 to 1991, marriages from 1699 to 1922, and burials from 1696 to 1913. A detailed parish history was published by the Wiltshire Victoria County History in 1987, as part of its Volume XIII: Chalke hundred.

Eberhard von Tanne-Waldburg (? - 1234) was the steward, or seneschal, and adviser of the Staufen dukes of Swabia, and later the adviser of the Emperor Friedrich II. During the anti-Staufen uprising, he and his brother Friedrich von Tanne took opposing sides. Friedrich was killed in 1197 in Montefiascone and Eberhard became the guardian of his nephew, Heinrich, until 1220. Subsequently, he and his nephew administered Swabia during the absence of the emperors. He was entrusted with the imperial regalia that was kept at Waldburg from 1220–1225, hence the name \\"seneshal,\\" or steward. Eberhard was the founding \\"father\\" of the Waldburg lines, and from him the medieval, early modern, and modern lines descend.Rene Waldburg, Walburg lineage . Accessed 15 October 2009.  Geographic origin  History Waldburg Castle in the eastern Bodensee region Ruins of Alttrauchburg castle  Alttrauchburg  In 1258 the fief of Alttrauchburg had been given to the stewards of Waldburg, who purchased it outright in 1306 from the count, who had run into debt. The tower-like core structure was now extended and built on. To the south, the large outer bailey was laid out together with its strong, rectangular, advanced tower. As a result, the Waldburgs mostly lived in the castle by themselves or let had it managed by vogts (1418 Hans von Mühlegg). In 1429, the Trauchburg went to the Jacobian line of the family. Some lords are referred to in the sources as \\"bad stewards\\", i.e. were in constant financial difficulties. As a result of suffering capture and damage in various conflicts, the castle of Alttrauchburg was expanded and strengthened in the 16th century and upgraded into a representative seat of territorial lordship and government. In 1628, the Waldburgs became imperial counts and moved in 1690 to their schloss at Kißlegg, abandoning their seat at Trauchburg and using it as a quarry for the new schloss at Kißlegg. In 1772 the Jacobian line of the Waldburgs died out with Count Francis Charles Eusebius. The estate went to the line of the counts of Waldburg-Zeil and the castle is still owned by this family today.

Dilks (December 16, 1816 - October 24, 1901) was an American law enforcement officer and police inspector with the New York City Police Department during the mid-to late 19th century. He was a prominent police official during the early years of the Metropolitan Police Department and was one of the senior officers who participated in the Draft Riot of 1863, most notably, by recapturing the Union Steam Works after fierce hand-to-hand fighting. Dilks was also actively involved in cases concerning counterfeiting, prostitution and missing children. He was an investigating officer during the Cunningham-Burdell \\"bogus baby\\" case in 1857, later serving as witness for the prosecution, and the Alexander T. Stewart bodysnatching case in 1878. Biography Early life and marriage George W. Dilks was born to English immigrant James Dilks in New York City, New York on December 26, 1816. He was descended from a prominent Revolutionary War family, his grandfather being a British Army colonel who later settled in the United States following the war. He was also a relative of English nobleman Sir Charles Dilks and Admiral Sir Thomas Dilks.\\"Obituary. George Wright Dilks.\\" _New York Tribune._ 25 Oct. 1901. He was educated in New Brunswick, New Jersey and returned to New York with his family at age 14. They settled in Manhattan, New York and Dilks worked as a printer during his teenage years. His workplace was located on Duane Street, near Broadway, in the same building where the law office of Aaron Burr was, and the two became close friends. He was also personal friends with actor Edwin L. Davenport and later brother-in-law Rev. Dr. Samuel D. Burchard. On July 11, 1843, he married Carolina Williams, the daughter of Robert Williams, at the Thirteenth Street Presbyterian Church by Rev. Dr. Burchard. They would eventually have five children, however only two daughters survived into adulthood. Police career with the NYPD In 1848, Dilks joined the police force under the administration of then Mayor Fernando Wood and appointed as an assistant captain. The next year, he commanded a squad of officers during the Astor Place Riot. He was made a full captain \\"for bravery and vigilance\\" in 1853 and given command of the Fifteenth Ward. In 1857, he won praise for his actions against rioting longshoremen, armed with hay- sticks, cart-rungs and clubs, whom he and his men fought in a four-day battle.Wheatley, Richard. \\"The New York Police Department.\\" Harper's New Monthly Magazine. 74.442 (March 1887): 499+. In 1860, he was appointed a police inspector. During the Draft Riot of 1863, Dilks led a force of two hundred officers into Second Avenue and recaptured the Union Steam Works, then being used as a headquarters and rallying point for rioters along East Side Manhattan, after fierce hand-to-hand fighting. His force, which included all the reserves of the Eighteenth Precinct, was outnumbered against the nearly five hundred rioters inside.Asbury, Herbert.

(pg. 142-143) Shortly after the riots, he was offered the position of Police Superintendent but declined not wanting to take the position from then superintendent John Alexander Kennedy. Remaining an inspector, he held this rank until his retirement in 1888.

He died from natural causes at his West Ninth Street residence on October 24, 1901. A funeral service was held for him three days later at the Church of the Ascension, at Tenth Street and Fifth Avenue, and conducted by members of the Mutual Lodge, Palestine Encampment and Independent Order of Odd Fellows. Reverend Percy S. Grant of the Church of the Ascension and Reverend Walter Buchanan of the Fourth Avenue Presbyterian Church, the Dilks family pastor, also assisted in the ceremony.

Common names include Rio Grande palmetto, Mexican palmetto, Texas palmetto, Texas sabal palm, palmmetto cabbage and palma de mícharos. The specific epithet, \\"mexicana\\", is Latin for \\"of Mexico.\\" Description Mexican palmetto reaches a height of , with a spread of . The trunk reaches in length and in diameter. The fan-shaped fronds are wide and attach to spineless petioles. Spikes in length yield small bisexual flowers. The drupes are black when ripe and in diameter. Range The current range of S. mexicana extends from South Texas on the Gulf Coast of the United States and Nayarit on the Pacific Coast, south along both seashores to Nicaragua. It is one of the most widespread and common palm trees in Mexico, where it is found in the drier lowlands. Some believe that the species may have ranged much further north along the Texas Gulf Coast and as far inland as San Antonio at one time. This is supported by observations recorded in the 17th to 19th centuries, the presence of a small, disjunct population north of the Lower Rio Grande Valley, and the ease with which cultivated trees have become naturalized in parts of Central Texas. S. mexicana should not be confused with the related and somewhat shorter \\"Brazoria Palm\\", a small population of which occurs in southeast Texas, and which is a natural hybrid of S. palmetto and S. minor. Naturally occurring S. mexicana in Texas may be difficult to discern, because this palm is widely planted as an ornamental, and because feral specimens easily become established. However, at least two populations in Texas have been reported to be purely natural. The most prominent is found in the 557-acre Sabal Palm Sanctuary located outside of Brownsville, Texas, along the banks of the Rio Grande. The second is on a much smaller tract located along the banks of Garcitas Creek, near Vanderbilt, Texas. Uses Mexican palmetto is grown as an ornamental for its robust, stately form, drought tolerance, and hardiness to USDA Zone 8. The wood is resistant to decomposition and shipworms, making it desirable for use in wharf pilings and fence posts. The leaves are used for thatching and making straw hats.

These tests were primarily photo-data runs, with actual aircraft (usually executing ordered manoeuvres) as targets; firing tests were not practicable at North Beach. These tests indicated that the two machines were comparable in the accuracy of the gun orders delivered, except in regions where mathematical approximations inherent in the design of the Mark1 sometimes resulted in substantial errors. (The Mark 8 geometry was substantially free of such errors.) It was also found that the Mark 8 reached solution much faster than the Mark 1. Since one of the drawbacks observed in fleet experience with the Mark 1 was its sluggishness, it was decided to attempt to modify the Mark 1 in accordance with the principles of the Mark 8 to obtain a faster solution time...\\"p232 but by the time it was developed and tested in 1944, supplies of the Mk 1 were found to be sufficient in quantity. The USN extensively tested the Mk 8 and may have incorporated some of its technology into the post war Ford Instruments Mk1A computer. The Mk 8 technology was similar to that used in the M9 gun data computer used by the US Army for coast defence fire control and in the SCR-584 radar system computer.

Since the Faroe Islands have no predator that can kill the geese, a special \\"goose culture\\" has developed in the Faroe Islands, which has no equivalent in neighboring countries. From May to October one can see flocks of geese walking freely in the outfields, where they feed on the short summer grass without any supplementary feeding. In winter the geese move freely in the cultivated infields of the villages, which in some cases is of such good quality that earlier the geese did not need complementary feed in the winter. In most places, however, caretakers provide supplementary food just before and during egg laying and when snow is on the ground. The properties of today's Faroese geese result from natural selection over centuries, where only the most well-adapted birds reproduced.  Properties  In Nordisk Genbank Husdyr, the breed is described as a \\"not too large and not at all rough built, but otherwise it must not be refined and neat. Is very hardy and resistant to weather and disease and tolerates a harsh climate. It is hardy, very food-seeking and it has good juicy meat. Is somewhat temperamental, awake and guarding and will preferably be left alone during the breeding season.\\" Further descriptions of the breed's phenotypic court detail: Gase 5–5,5 kg, (11-12 lbs) Goose: 4–4,5 kg, (8.8-9.9 lbs) Egg weight: 130 grams or 4.5 ounces. Most of the Faroese geese are slaughtered in December at a weight of 4–5 kg or 9-11 pounds. After three to four weeks of fattening the chicks are slaughtered. Earlier, most got lightly salted or wind-dried for winter supplies, and the goose is a Christmas table favorite.

It is the largest cemetery in Seattle. History At the time of its inception, the area was known as Oak Lake, a full day's carriage ride from downtown via Ballard, Seattle, Washington. David Denny owned land by the lake, and when the old Seattle Cemetery was to become Denny Park he moved the remains of his infant son from there to his property at Oak Lake. David Denny, one of the founders of Seattle In 1887, David Denny’s cousin Henry Levi Denny moved his family's plot from Capitol Hill to the new burial ground, and over time the number of burials increased, usually by family members and associates of the Denny Party. In 1903, the property, known as Oaklake Cemetery,\\"Historylink.org : Evergreen Washelli Cemetery\\" was inherited by David's son, Victor Denny. Victor sold the property in 1914 to the American Necropolis Association, a St. Louis-based company that owned cemetery properties in several states. The ANA gave the cemetery the name \\"Washelli\\" (a Makah word meaning \\"westerly wind\\"), which had been the name of a central Seattle cemetery disestablished in 1887. In 1919, the Evergreen Cemetery Company started a competing cemetery on the western side of Aurora Avenue, directly opposite Washelli Cemetery. In 1922, Evergreen Cemetery purchased Washelli from the ANA, although the merger did not become final until 1928. By 1952, Evergreen had taken over the mausolea, crematory and columbarium. The cemetery changed its name to Evergreen Washelli in 1962. The Evergreen Washelli cemetery was started as an \\"endowment care\\" cemetery, therefore a portion of the cost of a grave is designated into a trust fund for maintenance of the grounds. This allows for a cemetery to remain as a perpetual landmark. The Evergreen Washelli funeral home was started in 1972 in response to public demand. It quickly outgrew its offices on the eastern side of Washelli, and in 1994, moved into larger premises on the Evergreen side of the property, west of Aurora Avenue. Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park consists of the Evergreen-Washelli Cemetery, Evergreen Washelli Funeral Home, Crematory, and Cemetery, Veterans Memorial Cemetery, Bothell Funeral Home, and Abbey View Cemetery in Brier, Washington. Veterans Memorial Cemetery Veterans Memorial CemeteryThe Veterans Memorial Cemetery was started in 1927, and contains over 5,000 white marble headstones. It also hosts two carronades from the frigate (known as \\"Old Ironsides\\"), and a Chimes Tower. Construction of the Chimes Tower began in 1950 and the tower was built in part with contributions from local veterans groups. The octagonal tower of amber glass and concrete bears the emblems of the contributing veterans organizations on many of its windows. The chimes carillon, which was installed in 1965, used to play patriotic tunes every hour, but was later silenced and remained still for many years. Today, the chimes sound at noon and 4:30 p.m. daily, in addition to special occasions such as Memorial Day and Veterans Day. It stands as a permanent memorial to veterans who were buried elsewhere, but who are remembered by friends and relatives. Buried here are several Medal of Honor recipients. Doughboy statue The Doughboy Statue at the Veterans Memorial CemeteryIn 1921, famous Seattle sculptor Alonzo Victor Lewis was commissioned to create a temporary plaster figure to commemorate the Seattle reunion of the 91st Division. Working mainly from his modest studio on Eastlake Avenue, Lewis used three soldiers from Fort Lawton as models and cast his plaster soldier to portray American patriotism, later stating that he envisioned the young soldier as \\"just returning from a victory — mud-covered and with a grim smile on his face.\\" In 1998, the \\"Doughboy\\" statue (cast in 1928) was moved from the Seattle Center to the Veterans Cemetery, and was re-dedicated there on November 11, 1998. Memorial Day Services have been held in the cemetery annually since 1927. Despite the record in the Smithsonian Inventory of American Sculpture listing other titles of this statue as Spirit of the American Doughboy, this work has nothing to do with E. M. Viquesney's creation bearing that title, and is of a completely different design and pose. Washelli Columbarium East of Aurora Avenue stands the Washelli columbarium, which holds the cremated remains of approximately 30,000 persons. Among these persons are the notable individuals Ben Fey, Leo Lassen, Ben Paris, and Stephen B. Packard. Totem pole The totem pole which weighs and stands high, had been carved in the Queen Charlotte Islands in British Columbia and was shipped across Puget Sound to Thomas Kelley on Bainbridge Island. In the early 1930s, Kelley gave the pole to his next-door neighbor Clinton S. Harley, then General Manager of Evergreen Washelli, who had the indigenous art erected in the cemetery. Haida Totem Pole According to Haida legend, the totem tells the story of Genanasimgat\\"Genanasimgat Legend\\" and his wife, who was the daughter of a powerful chief. Having heard that some hunters had spotted a rare white sea-otter, the mother of his bride asked Genanasimgat to kill the otter for its beautiful white fur, which he did. While the mother was skinning the otter, some blood got on the fur, so she asked her daughter to wash it in the sea, which her dutiful daughter did, but somehow the fur escaped her grasp and drifted into deeper water. During her pursuit of the fur, two orca whales kidnapped her. Genanasimgat, who loved his wife with all his heart, followed her to the bottom of the sea, where he met a crane, who hid him from the orcas under her breast feathers. After a number of other suspenseful adventures, Genanasimgat finally rescued his beloved wife and escaped home with her. Bothell Funeral Home and Abbey View Memorial Park Abbey View Memorial Park in Brier, Washington was founded by the Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park in 1953 and covers . The Evergreen Washelli Funeral Home at Bothell, Washington was purchased in 1999, and provides preparation, cremation, memorialization, as well as chapel services.

It aired on November 16, 2009. This episode marks the departure of Jennifer Morrison from the series, since it was stated by Fox that Morrison's character would be written out of the series by the middle of season six. Plot After House's medical license is reinstated, he reclaims his role as Head of Diagnostics in time to treat Hank Hardwick (guest star Troy Garity), an adult film star admitted to Princeton Plainsboro for pulsating eye pain. Cameron and Chase decide to leave Princeton Plainsboro in order to save their relationship after Dibala's death. Throughout the episode, House tries to reassemble his old team of Foreman, Cameron, Chase, Thirteen, and Taub. Taub and Thirteen initially ignore House's attempts to get them to come back. The patient's and his wife's jobs in porn make the team confront him about how dedicated they really are to each other. House orders an STD panel, a tox screen, an ANA to look for autoimmune, a patient history, a lumbar puncture to rule out viral encephalitis, and asks to have a c-reactive protein sent to the lab to look for inflammation. Foreman has to do all this himself. During the lumbar puncture, the patient has tetany - his arm muscles contract. House goes to Taub, who says the only link between the eye and muscle is the brain, and suggests a tumor or a seizure. House then asks Thirteen who states she has an interview with a community health clinic and doesn't give an opinion. House takes her comment on her trip to Thailand as a suggestion that the patient's condition is multifocal. Foreman says cerebral vasculitis would explain the eye and arms, so House tells him to start the patient on steroids, to do a brain angiogram to confirm, and to get an EMG and nerve biopsy as well. When Foreman convinces Chase to remain on the team for the remainder of the case by telling him \\"you owe me this\\", he and Cameron agree to finish the case. Foreman gets Chase to do the brain angio. Cameron thinks it could be a severe vitamin D deficiency, since the patient has a restrictive diet and works long hours indoors. This would explain all the patient's symptoms. Chase decides to take Hank to the phototherapy suite, blast him with ultra-violet light and give him IV vitamins as well as do the brain angio. During the UV light session, the patient gets a nosebleed and petechial hemorrhages - bleeds in his leg. This new symptom rules out both Cameron and Foreman's diagnoses. The patient's blood won't clot. Foreman notes that the UV rays made his capillaries more fragile, which sped up the onset of DIC. Cameron thinks a widespread petechial rash and nervous system involvement indicates a blood infection. She suggests meningococcemia. The team starts him on heparin for the DIC and broad-spectrum antibiotics for the infection. However, the patient soon gets a fever, meaning the antibiotics aren't working. House goes to Taub again, who tells him he's happy at home and work. He berates House for his addiction to addictions and how he's trying to avoid his problem by solving a different problem, which won't work. He says his work helps people, and gives an example of a patient who got a nose job when he couldn't breathe with his nose after a car-crash, and has an idea. He says the antibiotics wouldn't work if the patient's sinuses were infected and clogged, if there was a pocket of bacteria his blood vessels couldn't reach. He says the antibiotics will work if they surgically drain the patient's sinuses. Foreman asks Thirteen to come back, but she resolutely turns him down. Soon, the patient's liver begins to fail, and his abdomen fills with fluid. Cameron suggests a klatskin tumor obstructing his bile ducts. Foreman says he's not jaundiced and there wouldn't be ocular effects, but Chase states that inflammation inside the bile channels would mean sclerosing cholangitis, which would explain all the symptoms. This would stop him producing clotting proteins and damage his blood cells causing small strokes. The team preps the patient for an ERCP to open his bile channels. During the ERCP, Chase and Foreman find the patient's liver is filled with worms. The patient has strongyloides - threadworms. The worms spread throughout the patient's body causing all his symptoms. He most likely got the worms from his sexual activity. The patient gets two mebendazole pills. However, the patient's lungs fill with fluid and become severely compromised. Foreman suggests lymphoma. Peritoneal carcinomatosis explains the liver failure and paraneoplastic syndrome explains everything else. House orders chemotherapy. He also tells them to fax the latest update to Taub and Thirteen. The patient suddenly starts to pee blood, and he goes into cardiac arrest. They manage to stabilize him, but he has no red or white cells and almost no platelets either. Foreman suggests aleukemic leukemia meaning the marrow wouldn't be making normal cells. House tells them to ablate the patient's bone marrow, despite the team's arguments that this could kill the patient. He faxes this information and information on the patient's condition to Taub and Thirteen for their opinions. They both are shown to ignore the fax. However, as Thirteen receives a message from the community clinic she applied to, she ignores it and looks at House's fax. Taub looks at the fax as he talks to a rather silly patient. They both call House as the team is about to ablate the patient's marrow. They reason that the patient's body went to hell hours after the worms were gone because the worms were helping him. They diagnose extra-intestinal Crohn's. The patient lived in a super-clean environment as a kid. It's the hygiene - why there's so much autoimmune disease in developed places and almost none in developing places. The worms were keeping the Crohn's in check and \\"teaching his immune system what it should've learned eating dirt growing up\\", but once they were gone, the Crohn's started to run rampant. The team starts the patient on methylprednisolone and helminths. Meanwhile, Wilson scolds Cuddy for thinking her dating Lucas wouldn't affect House. He says she at least should have told him, so he wouldn't have coached House on how to win Cuddy's affection. Cuddy tells Wilson she's not going to let House affect her relationships, but goes home to Lucas and panics. Lucas says that either she thought they could go on happily with their relationship and not be found out by House, or she thought they wouldn't be together for long. He notes that the former would be Cuddy was delusional, and the latter would mean he was. He also says the only other option would be that Cuddy thought House had matured, which would bring them back to Cuddy being delusional. Lucas goes to the doctor's lounge and looks through the team's files, looking for anything on them to help keep them to prevent House from being miserable so Cuddy won't be miserable. Wilson thinks House just wants his old team members back as he feels abandoned by Cuddy and wants people he knows. He tells House he can't solve a deeper problem with a surface solution. During the episode, House talks to Cameron about her leaving the hospital. He says her human-loving nature contradicts the way she's simply forgiving Chase for what he did. Cameron thinks House is simply trying to blow her marriage. House however, gives three reasons for why she's acting weird: his firing Chase is what made her leave the team two years ago, when what Chase did finally hits Cameron their marriage will 'blow up', and finally, the only thing stopping Cameron working at the hospital will be gone. He also suggests to Chase that Cameron might be forgiving him because she loves him, but that there could be another explanation. This stirs doubt in Chases mind, and he asks Cameron her reason for forgiving him, noting she's been harder on the patient than on him. She explains that Chase feels shame and guilt for what he's done, unlike Hank. House tells Chase his theory on Cameron's reaction. He thinks Cameron feels it was House's fault that Chase did what he did, saying he created the foul climate for it to happen. Cameron tells House to stop his game of trying to hire Thirteen and Taub. This outburst makes Chase realize she's mad at House but not him. He says he did it, and he won't leave the hospital just because Cameron wants to pretend he didn't do it. Chase eventually meets House at his front door and tells him he wants to remain on the team. At the end of the episode Cameron confirms that her anger was directed towards House as the source of the atmosphere leading to Dibala's murder. She confronts House by saying he ruined Chase's life making him \\"unable to see right or wrong and not to see the sanctity of human life\\". Cameron admits her former love for Dr. House – which has disappeared as a result of recent events, along with her love for Chase (as he was when she first met him). She puts her hand out to shake House's hand and he does not accept – much like the end of season three – and she kisses him on the cheek, signaling she is leaving the diagnostic team. Cameron leaves the team but Chase continues working with House, along with Foreman, Thirteen, and Taub. In the closing scenes, Thirteen is shown treating the patient and she and Foreman look at each other until Foreman leaves. Taub talks to his wife, who is upset with him returning to diagnostics. Cameron is shown walking out on Chase with her bags packed and giving him a tearful hug. Lucas and Cuddy also walk through the lobby of Princeton-Plainsboro with House watching them from above.

It aired on November 23, 2009.  Plot  On the eve of Thanksgiving, House and the team take on the case of James Sidas (Esteban Powell), an exceptionally brilliant physicist (IQ 178), in fact the youngest person to ever graduate MIT, who traded his successful career for a job as a courier to be with his intellectually inferior wife (IQ 87). For the ailing patient, intelligence is a miserable burden that alienates him from others. The team eventually suspects he suffers from TTP, but the splenectomy they perform does not improve his situation, ruling that condition out. However, it is later revealed that a depression as a teenager due to his loneliness as a child prodigy led him to attempt suicide, and House realizes that the ribs he broke back then made his spleen split into several parts, which is why the procedure had no effect – it was TTP all along. The remaining symptoms are explained after the discovery of his use of DXM (mixed with alcohol to prevent brain damage), which he used to reduce his intellect. As Sidas regains his status of intellectual genius by not abusing the addictive medicine, he begins work in applied physics, drawing a schematic for a toroidal helicon plasma device, and is reassured that he cannot relate to his wife with his original intellect. House, relating to his situation, essentially helps \\"lobotomize Einstein\\" by giving him back his meds, as the patient wishes to be dumb and happy rather than smart and miserable. House tries to break up Lucas and Cuddy at Thanksgiving dinner. However, Cuddy gives him the wrong address on purpose to stop him from messing up the evening. Afterwards, House breaks into Lucas' home, faking a drunken stupor, tells Lucas about how much he wants to be with Cuddy. Cuddy arrives the next morning at House's apartment, lying about how she and Lucas had split up. Later in the episode, House finds out she lied after she did not accept free tickets he offered her. Meanwhile, Chase wants to deal alone with the fact that Cameron left, but everybody keeps on wanting to comfort him. As a result, Chase ends up punching House in the face. He later apologizes and tells House it was a way of keeping the others away. Taub has problems with his wife, because she thinks that even at the age of 40 he's still doing an intern's job, instead of having his own private practice. Taub convinces her that he confronted House for keeping him from Thanksgiving dinner by showing her a picture of House's beaten-up face (by Chase), claiming he was responsible, which soothes her. Reception Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club graded the episode a B.

In 1965, he co- founded The Great Society with his brother Jerry Slick, Jenn Piersol, and his sister-in-law Grace Slick (David Miner and Bard Du Pont joined shortly afterward). Darby played lead guitar and occasionally performed backup vocals early on and less often towards the disbanding. He wrote some other songs for The Great Society, including \\"Free Advice\\" and \\"Darkly Smiling\\". \\"Somebody to Love\\" Originally under the title \\"Mind Full of Bread\\", the composition was created during Slick's process of creating a novel, which started in 1962. Slick spent time writing and playing jam sessions with his guitar. Periodically, he spent less time writing a novel and more time writing the composition. The song was complete in 1965 after Slick ended a relationship. His intent for the piece was to go against the cliche of wanting love as a theme for a song and instead giving love. The song was released as a single under the North Beach label. It was released as \\"Someone to Love\\" with the B-side \\"Free Advice\\" but the single's distribution was limited and made little impact at the time. When Grace Slick and Jefferson Airplane recorded the song, it became a top 10 hit on the national charts. Darby Slick wrote other compositions like \\"Free Advice\\" that largely were influenced by Indian music that he studied after the band broke up. After The Great Society After Slick's time with the band, he took an interest in Indian music. He took several trips to India to learn more about the genre. Slick published an autobiography in 1991 titled Don't You Want Somebody to Love detailing his time with the band and lessons while on trips to India.

It is designated as a scheduled monument. Collegiate Church at Dunglass History The date of building the Chapel, dedicated to St. Mary of Dunglass, is unclear but when Sir Alexander Home of that Ilk was granted a charter, in 1421, to the lands of Dunglass the chapel was in existence, adjacent to Dunglass Castle, now demolished. In 1423, Sir Alexander of Dunglass employed priests (a college) to pray for the family's souls and the chapel was raised to collegiate status. This was confirmed by King James II of Scots in 1450 and confirmed by Pope Nicholas V. The college was composed of a provost, three chaplains and four boy choristers. Originally, the church consisted of a nave and a choir and the Home or Hume burial vault. In the 16th century transepts were added and a new tower. In 1544 the church was attacked by the Earl of Hertford's army during the wars of the Rough Wooing but the locals managed to repel the insurgents. In 1560, the church closed at the onset of the Scottish Reformation. An Act of the Scottish Parliament in 1563 abolished mass forever and the church's days as a Roman Catholic Chapel were over. In the early days of the church, a hospital, to offer solace and aid to the sick, was built nearby and dedicated to St. Mary and John the Baptist. The building is built of ashlar sandstone and roofed by stone slabs though the tower in now unroofed. Dunglass interior looking west Later years After the Reformation the church continued to be used as a parish church until the 18th century before it was sold to a farmer. The widow of Alexander Home, 1st Earl of Home (d. 1619), the Countess of Home discussed erecting a marble tomb for her husband with the London sculptor Nicholas Stone, but nothing was done. The holy building was desecrated when the farmer bulldozed the east window to make way for his vehicles and the church including the burial aisle was used as a barn. In 1807 some dignity was restored when Sir John Hall bought Dunglass; the family later used the south transept as a burial aisle. In 1919 the estate was purchased by the Usher family. The present day Dunglass Church is now in the care of Historic Scotland and is situated in an idyllic situation surrounded by well manicured lawns and thick woodland. An interesting sundial stands on a mound adjacent to the ancient edifice. Dunglass Collegiate Church is one of the top attractions in East Lothian.

The three-day-long training exercise was held from 6 October to 8 October 2009. Training exercises between the two countries had been held annually, but this had been delayed because of the Sri Lankan Civil War. It was also the first training exercise between the two navies since the end of the war. The Indian vessels that participated in the Cadex 2009 exercises were INS Shardul, a landing ship tank of the India Navy and INCGS Varuna, an offshore patrol vessel of the Indian Coast Guard. The offshore patrol vessels SLNS Sayura and SLNS Samudura, along with the transport vessel A521 were the participating vessels from the Sri Lanka Navy. Preparations The Indian Navy was invited for the exercises by Vice Admiral Thisara Samarasinghe, the Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy. Cadex 2009 was initiated despite accusations from some Indian media that the Sri Lanka Navy had killed more than 50 South Indian fishermen. The plans for the exercise were not revealed until the day the Indian cadets arrived in Sri Lanka. The Indian cadets who participated in the exercise were from the 1st Training Squadron, based in Kochi. They arrived at the Colombo Harbour on 5 October 2009 aboard the INS Krishna and the two vessels that participated in the exercise, Shardul and Varuna. Cadex 2009 was intended to provide an opportunity for the Sri Lankan cadets to train on board Indian ships and to \\"enhance and exchange knowledge\\". The Indian cadets, in turn, were to \\"familiarize themselves with (Sri Lankan) tri-forces military training institutions\\" and also to visit places of historical and cultural value in order to \\"strengthen the ties between the two countries\\". Training exercise 100 Sri Lankan cadets from the Naval and Maritime Academy at Trincomalee, and 141 Indian cadets took part in the exercises. The vessels set out from the Colombo harbour at 9.00 am (local time, UTC+5:30) and sailed for five hours before arriving at the planned location for the exercises, south west of the Colombo harbour. The Sri Lanka Navy also took media personnel aboard the SLNS Hansaya to report the exercise. A cordon was set up around the area by Fast Attack Craft of the Sri Lanka Navy. Live fire exercises were started on the night of 6 October. The exercises included a visit, board, search, and seizure (VBSS) training for the Sri Lanka Navy's Special Boat Squadron, and helicopter landings aboard the Shardul and Sayura. The ships returned to the Colombo harbour on 8 October. The Indian cadets also visited the Sri Lanka Military Academy in Diyatalawa, the Naval and Maritime Academy in Trincomalee and the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University in Kandawala. They also visited places of \\"cultural and historical value\\" in the country. Reception According to the Sri Lanka Navy, the training exercise reflects the \\"mutual cooperation of the two friendly navies and the long standing bilateral relations of the two neighbouring nations\\". However, some Tamil Nadu politicians had expressed dissatisfaction at the Indian Navy agreeing to hold Cadex 2009 with the Sri Lanka Navy. This friction is even stronger after alleged attacks on Indian fishermen by Sri Lanka Navy on January 12, 2011 near Tamil Nadu.

It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival. It was adapted from the novel La maison d’Esther by Yves Dangerfield. Plot In March 1685, Louis XIV’s final wife Madame de Maintenon wishes to set up a boarding school for young daughters of noble families that have fallen on hard times, the Maison royale de Saint-Louis, a school where girls receive a pious but liberal education. The first difficulty is that the students from the provinces all speak different regional languages and dialects and the first task is to teach them all to speak a standardised Parisian French. After a few years of indifference, the school’s first aims prove impossible to attain. An important crisis arises from a performance by the students of an extract from Iphigenie by Racine. This provokes too much passion among the actors and so Madame de Maintenon asks Racine to write her a play for her students that praises virtue – this proves to be Esther. The students put on the new play and, when the king and his court attend the production, Madame de Maintenon realises that this had made the nobles of the court view her protégées as targets for seduction and marriage. Marriage proposals mount up and one nobleman even manages to break into the school. Madame de Maintenon decides to impose stricter rules and plunges into religion in an attempt to expiate her past. She asks an abbot to help her keep students on the right Christian moral path and keep them safe from the world. Instead of turning its students into an elite for the world outside, the school falls prey to realities, cuts itself off from reality and falls apart – the film ends with its final failure and closure.

He is the State Minister of Finance for Planning in the Cabinet of Uganda. He was appointed to that position in a cabinet reshuffle on 1 March 2015, replacing Matia Kasaija. He is a Member of Parliament for the constituency of Ndorwa West in the Parliament of Uganda and is a member of the National Resistance Movement, the ruling party. He is chief of the Scout Board of Uganda. Education Bahati received a Bachelor of Commerce degree from Makerere University, a Master of Business Administration degree from Cardiff University, an executive certificate in strategic management from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, an executive certificate in campaign leadership from the Leadership Institute, and a diploma in business English from the Manchester Business School. Carl Cooper, former bishop of St. Davids, said, \\"It was wonderful to discover that the local MP, Mr David Bahati, also had a Master's degree from the University of Wales and had spent time studying in Cardiff. Wales’ influence often stretches further than we realise.\\" Before entering politics, Bahati was head of finance and administration at Uganda's Population Secretariat. Introduction of Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill Bahati came to international attention in October 2009 after introducing the Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill as a Private Member's Bill on 13 October proposing that a new offence be created in Uganda named \\"aggravated homosexuality\\" which would be punishable as a capital offence. The proposals included plans to introduce the death penalty for gay adults who had sex with those of the same sex under 18, with disabled people, or when the accused party is HIV-positive, or for those previously convicted of homosexuality- related offences. Journalist and gay rights activist Jeff Sharlet (winner of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission's Outspoken Award) claims that in a private conversation Bahati expressed a desire to \\"kill every last gay person.\\" Sharlet suggested that the bill came about as a result of Bahati's membership in the Christian group The Family. Transcript available at: He revealed that Bahati reportedly first floated the idea of the bill (which at that time included the death penalty for homosexual assaults on minors, disabled people, or by knowingly HIV positive men) during The Family's Uganda National Prayer Breakfast in 2008. Bob Hunter, a member of The Family, gave an interview to NPR in December 2009 in which he acknowledged Bahati's connection but argued that no American associates support the bill. After news of the gay execution law broke, Bahati was disinvited from the 2010 U.S. National Prayer Breakfast. Bahati was interviewed by Rachel Maddow in December 2010. Bahati asserted that $15 million had been invested in Uganda to recruit children.On 'Rachel Maddow,' Uganda's David Bahati Says He Loves Gays, retrieved 10 December 2010 When pressed by Maddow for \\"recruitment\\" tactics, he stated that \\"They go to a school, teach them, entice them with money, to lure them into this practice\\". Bahati asserted that videos are being circulated in Uganda that state that \\"a man sleeping with a man is okay,\\" which were being used for \\"recruitment\\". Maddow challenged this assertion, stating that \\"recruitment of children by gays is a common myth in any and all countries that have debated laws like that proposed in Uganda.\\" Bahati made clear in the interview that the law he is proposing will go through the democratic process of Uganda and be debated upon. In addition to this, Bahati believes that America should respect its sovereignty as well as the fact that Ugandan law will have jurisdiction on Ugandans only.Rachel Maddow/David Bahati -- full interview , The Maddow Blog, 9 December 2010 On 20 December 2013 the Parliament of Uganda passed the Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Act, 2014 with the death penalty proposal dropped in favour of life in prison. The bill was signed into law by the President of Uganda on 24 February 2014. On 1 August 2014, however, the Constitutional Court of Uganda ruled the Act invalid on procedural grounds.

There are two types of incorporated municipalities in Maine, towns and cities. The tables below differentiate between towns and cities. Most areas of New England are entirely divided into incorporated municipalities, with no unincorporated territory. In the three northern New England states, however, some unincorporated territory does exist, generally in areas that are very sparsely populated. Maine contains significantly more unincorporated territory than the other states, with the bulk of it in interior and northern counties, including Penobscot County. Some unincorporated territory in Maine is organized into a third type of town-level municipality unique to Maine, called a plantation (considered to be “organized”, but not incorporated), while some is entirely unorganized. Penobscot County also contains an Indian reservation, which is considered to be a distinct entity independent from any municipality, although this has not always been the case in the past. Due to the large extent of unincorporated territory in Penobscot County, separate sections with detailed historical census totals for such areas follow the main tables below. For any census, adding up the totals for each town-level municipality, including any plantations, unorganized entities and Indian reservations (when recognized as independent entities), should yield the county total. For more information on the New England municipal system, see New England town.

This consisted of 324 residents in organized plantations, and 1,449 residents in unorganized territory. An additional 562 residents lived on an Indian reservation. Plantations As of 1900, Penobscot County contained seven plantations: Drew, Grand Falls, Lakeville, Seboeis, Stacyville, Summit, and Webster. By the 1920s, the number had dropped to five, as Summit apparently surrendered its organization sometime between 1910 and 1920 (see notes to the 1910 Census below), and Drew incorporated as a town in 1921. The number would increase again between 1934 and 1940, as five of the six towns in Penobscot County that disincorporated during that period subsequently became plantations: Drew (1934), Kingman (1935), Mount Chase (1936), Carroll (1937), and Prentiss (1940). This brought the number of plantations in the county to ten. In Drew's case, this marked a return to plantation status after a short time as a town. Of the ten plantations that existed in 1940, four remain today – Drew, Carroll, Seboeis and Webster. Three have incorporated as towns (Stacyville and Lakeville for the first time, Mount Chase as a re- incorporation). The remaining three have surrendered their organization and reverted to unorganized territory: Kingman (1945), Grand Falls (1981), and Prentiss (1990). In addition to the above, there is also some evidence suggesting that the former town of Mattamiscontis may have been briefly organized as plantation around 1907, following its disincorporation as a town. If it was, however, it did not last long enough in this status to be tabulated as a plantation in any decennial census (see notes to the 1900 Census below). 1900 *Stacyville 347 *Lakeville 129 *Webster 124 *Drew 120 *Seboeis 96 *Grand Falls 52 *Summit 37 1910 *Stacyville 577 *Drew 247 *Webster 103 *Lakeville 96 *Seboeis 86 *Grand Falls 50 *Summit 14 1920 *Stacyville 583 *Drew 286 *Webster 87 *Lakeville 84 *Seboeis 83 *Grand Falls 36 1930 *Stacyville 600 *Webster 90 *Lakeville 60 *Seboeis 41 *Grand Falls 53 1940 *Stacyville 717 *Kingman 367 *Prentiss 337 *Carroll 304 *Mount Chase 198 *Drew 93 *Webster 89 *Seboeis 80 *Lakeville 71 *Grand Falls 55 1950 *Stacyville 679 *Prentiss 315 *Carroll 288 *Mount Chase 250 *Webster 92 *Drew 72 *Seboeis 70 *Lakeville 50 *Grand Falls 22 1960 *Prentiss 227 *Mount Chase 179 *Carroll 147 *Webster 79 *Seboeis 77 *Drew 43 *Lakeville 21 *Grand Falls 7 1970 *Mount Chase 197 *Prentiss 159 *Carroll 132 *Seboeis 63 *Webster 56 *Drew 32 *Lakeville 15 *Grand Falls 6 1980 *Prentiss 205 *Carroll 175 *Webster 82 *Drew 57 *Seboeis 53 *Lakeville 32 *Grand Falls 1 1990 *Prentiss 245 *Carroll 185 *Webster 95 *Drew 43 *Seboeis 40 2000 *Carroll 144 *Webster 82 *Drew 57 *Seboeis 41 Unorganized territory Like all of Maine's interior counties, Penobscot County contains a significant amount of unorganized territory. Most of it is in the northern part of the county, an area which has historically been very sparsely populated. There are also some unorganized areas in the east central part of the county along the border with Hancock and Washington counties, another sparsely populated area. Historically, about two-thirds of the county's land area was incorporated or organized, leaving the remaining one-third unorganized. There are at least twenty-five townships in the county which have never been organized, along with a few additional gore-like entities. The general divider between the organized and unorganized portions of the county historically followed the northern or interior boundaries of Seboeis, Mattamiscontis, Chester, Woodville, East Millinocket and Medway, and the border with Aroostook County north of Mattawamkeag, Kingman and Drew. With the exception of two townships along the border with Hancock and Washington counties, all territory to the south and east of that line was historically organized, although several municipalities had not advanced beyond the plantation stage. The two townships that were never organized at all are T3R1 NBPP, also known as Twombly Twp. (along the Hancock County line between Burlington and Lakeville), and T5R1 NBPP, also known as Whitney Twp. (in the corner east of Lakeville and south of Carroll, along the border with Washington County). Communities which were historically plantations rather than towns include Seboeis, Webster, Grand Falls, Drew (was a town only for a short period in the early 20th century), Lakeville (did not incorporate as a town until 1981) and Summit. All of these communities are in the area to the immediate south of the above line, and/or along the border with Hancock and Washington counties. The former town of Mattamiscontis and the former Summit plantation both dissolved early in the 20th century, reverting to unorganized territory. North or to the interior of the line described in the previous paragraph, the only areas that have ever been organized are the town of Millinocket, and three municipalities in the northeast part of the county along the border with Aroostook County (Mount Chase, Patten and Stacyville). Millinocket does not border any other municipality which has ever been organized; it nearly touches East Millinocket, but the two are separated by a narrow strip of territory, most of which is water. Mount Chase, Patten and Stacyville are isolated from any other organized municipalities in Penobscot County, but all three border towns across the county line in Aroostook County. Stacyville was a plantation until the 1950s, and Mount Chase also operated as a plantation between the 1930s and 1970s, but all three are currently incorporated towns. Between 1935 and 1945, a large number of municipalities in Maine dissolved and reverted to unorganized townships. While six towns in Penobscot County disincorporated around this time period, most of these communities adopted plantation forms of government rather than dissolve entirely, and no municipalities which had historically been plantations dissolved. As a result, only two former municipalities reverted to unorganized territory during this time: Argyle (a town until 1938, when it disincorporated and reverted to unorganized territory) and Kingman (a town until 1935, then became a plantation; surrendered its organization in 1945). A few additional communities have joined them more recently, including Grand Falls (a plantation which surrendered its organization in 1981), Prentiss (once a town, later a plantation, surrendered its organization in 1990), and Greenfield (a town which disincorporated in 1993). The areas of Penobscot County that are entirely unorganized cover about , with a population of about 1,450 people. This covers about 38% of the county's land area, but includes only about 1% of its population. Two unorganized townships, the former municipalities of Kingman and Prentiss, have a large enough population to maintain a registrar and clerk to conduct elections for state and federal offices, although they do not have true organized municipal governments. There is also a similar entity called Indian Purchase Township, apparently consisting of one or both of the Indian Purchase townships adjacent to Millinocket. Over the years, the U.S. Census Bureau has used different methods to compile data for unorganized territory in Maine. From 1900 to 1950, data was tabulated for each individual unorganized entity. In 1960, a single catch-all “Unorganized Territory” listing was provided for each Maine county, generally with no further breakdown. Since 1970, the Census has grouped contiguous areas in each county into one or more “unorganized territories”. As of the 2000 Census, seven such areas are recognized within Penobscot County: *North Penobscot Unorganized Territory: the unorganized area north or to the interior of Seboeis, Maxfield, Howland, Enfield, Chester, Lincoln, Woodville, Medway and East Millinocket. It encompasses all territory to the north or interior of those communities except for the towns of Millinocket, Stacyville, Patten and Mount Chase. This covers the bulk of the historically unorganized territory in Penobscot County, as well as the former town of Mattamiscontis. *East Central Penobscot Unorganized Territory: the former town of Greenfield, and the former Grand Falls and Summit plantations. *Argyle Unorganized Territory: the former town of Argyle, which is its own Unorganized Territory because it does not border any other land that is unorganized. *Kingman Unorganized Territory: the former town (later plantation) of Kingman, which is its own Unorganized Territory because it does not border any other land that is unorganized. *Prentiss Unorganized Territory: the former town (later plantation) of Prentiss, which is its own Unorganized Territory because it does not border any other land that is both unorganized and within Penobscot County. *Twombly Unorganized Territory: Twombly Twp. (T3R1 NBPP), which is its own Unorganized Territory because it does not border any other land that is both unorganized and within Penobscot County. *Whitney Unorganized Territory: Whitney Twp. (T5R1 NBPP), which is its own Unorganized Territory because it does not border any other land that is both unorganized and within Penobscot County. When the Unorganized Territories were first created for the 1970 Census, there were six in Penobscot County. North Penobscot, Argyle, Kingman, Twombly and Whitney were similar to their present-day state. The sixth Unorganized Territory, Summit, consisted of the former Summit Plantation (T1 ND). For the 1990 Census, with Grand Falls having surrendered its organization and reverted to unorganized territory, the adjacent Grand Falls and Summit were combined to form East Central Penobscot Unorganized Territory. For the 2000 Census, East Central Penobscot Unorganized Territory was expanded to include the former town of Greenfield, which had disincorporated. A new Prentiss Unorganized Territory was also added for the 2000 Census, reflecting the former Prentiss Plantation having surrendered its organization. The listings below provide population figures for 1) all unincorporated territory, including plantations; 2) organized plantations, for which breakouts are available in the main tables above; and 3) unorganized territory, with any available breakouts provided. 1900 All unincorporated territory 2,206 Organized plantations 905 Unorganized territory 1,301 *T3 Indian Purchase 1,144 *Long A Twp.

No breakdown is available. 1970 All unincorporated territory 1,254 Organized plantations 660 Unorganized territory 594 Starting with the 1970 Census, the unorganized territory in Penobscot County was broken into groups of contiguous territory. Six such entities were recognized in 1970. *Kingman Unorganized Territory 264 *North Penobscot Unorganized Territory 175 *Argyle Unorganized Territory 155 *Summit Unorganized Territory 0 *Twombly Unorganized Territory 0 *Whitney Unorganized Territory 0 1980 All unincorporated territory 1,364 Organized plantations 605 Unorganized territory 759 *Kingman Unorganized Territory 281 *North Penobscot Unorganized Territory 246 *Argyle Unorganized Territory 225 *Summit Unorganized Territory 7 *Twombly Unorganized Territory 0 *Whitney Unorganized Territory 0 1990 All unincorporated territory 1,471 Organized plantations 608 Unorganized territory 863 For the 1990 Census, the former Summit Unorganized Territory was combined with the former Grand Falls Plantation to form East Central Penobscot Unorganized territory. *North Penobscot Unorganized Territory 403 *Kingman Unorganized Territory 246 *Argyle Unorganized Territory 202 *East Central Penobscot Unorganized Territory 12 *Twombly Unorganized Territory 0 *Whitney Unorganized Territory 0 2000 All unincorporated territory 1,773 Organized plantations 324 Unorganized territory 1,449 For the 2000 Census, the new Prentiss Unorganized Territory was added, reflecting the former Prentiss Plantation having surrendered its organization and reverted to unorganized territory. *North Penobscot Unorganized Territory 443 *East Central Penobscot Unorganized Territory 324 *Argyle Unorganized Territory 253 *Prentiss Unorganized Territory 214 *Kingman Unorganized Territory 213 *Twombly Unorganized Territory 2 *Whitney Unorganized Territory 0 Note: the unorganized townships in Penobscot County are on several different grids: *WELS (west of the Easterly Line of the State): as its name suggests, the baseline for this grid is the boundary between Maine and New Brunswick in Aroostook County. In places, it has up to 20 numbered rows, arranged from north to south. The upper rows exist only in Aroostook County, however, so that only rows 1 through 8 enter the modern borders of Penobscot County. A row “A” and “B” also exist in some areas to the south of row 1; west of the Penobscot River, the boundary between this grid and the one to the south of it (NWP) is irregular. The townships on this grid in Penobscot County are generally in ranges 6 through 8, although rows A and B do not exist in all ranges. The towns of Mount Chase, Patten and Stacyville were originally part of this grid. With the notable exception of the territory along the eastern edge, most of the area of Penobscot County covered by the WELS system is remote and very sparsely populated. Many of the townships are identified only by their row and range numbers and have never developed informal township names. *NWP (North of Waldo Patent): located in the area to the south of the WELS grid, west of the Penobscot River. Most of the townships in Penobscot County that were originally on this grid are now organized municipalities, but a few remain unorganized. These include T2R8, T2R9, and T3R9; the former town of Mattamiscontis is also sometimes referred to by its designation of T1R7. Ranges are numbered south to north, rows east to west. The northernmost range is generally range 9, although there is a range 10 in some places, as the boundary between this grid and the one to the north of it (WELS) is irregular. All of the never-organized townships on this grid in Piscataquis County are in ranges 8 or 9, and in rows 1 through 3. (Higher-numbered rows are further west, in Piscataquis County). *In the area where the WELS and NWP grids meet, there were originally some townships that were numbered sequentially as part of the “Indian Purchase”. Two of these townships remain as unorganized entities, numbers 3 and 4. The town of Millinocket was originally formed from part of T3. The area where the WELS and NWP grids meets also contains a few additional unorganized entities not part of any grid, including Hopkins Academy Grant and Veazie Gore. *NBPP (North of Bingham's Penobscot Purchase): the area to the south of the WELS grid east of the Penobscot River was originally on this grid, which also extended into Washington County. Most of the original townships on this grid are now organized municipalities, but a few have never organized. These include Twombly Twp. (T3R1) and Whitney Twp. (T5R1). Much of Hancock and Washington counties was originally laid out as a series of sequentially numbered townships designated ND (North Division), MD (Middle Division), SD (South Division) and ED (East Division). This area was originally part of Bingham's Penobscot Purchase. Some of the area covered by this numbering scheme extended into the modern boundaries of Penobscot County. All of the townships within Penobscot County that were originally on it were organized municipalities at one point, but a few have dissolved over the years and may sometimes be referred to today by their original grid designations. Summit Township, also known as T1 ND, is the most notable example. Indian Reservations Maine contains three federally recognized Indian reservations. One of these, the Penobscot Indian Island Reservation, is located in Penobscot County. Maine currently treats Indian reservations as distinct entities, not part of any organized municipality or unorganized entity. This has not always been the case in the past; at one time, present-day reservation land was regarded as part of the municipalities or unorganized entities within which it is geographically located. The main body of the reservation is adjacent to the Penobscot River at Old Town. The reservation also has jurisdiction over the channel of the Penobscot River for some distance to the north, including portions of both the East and West branches beyond the point where they diverge in Medway. Jurisdiction over the East Branch continues as far as the Medway-East Millinocket line, while jurisdiction over the West Branch continues to the Dolby Pond Dam, along the southern boundary of East Millinocket. In most areas, these channels run along town boundaries, but all three pass through the interior of the town of Medway. As a result, Medway's territory is technically in three major discontinuous pieces separated by river channels under the jurisdiction of the reservation. Medway controls some islands within the channels, however, creating exclaves within reservation territory. Overall, the reservation has jurisdiction over an area measuring about . Fewer than are land, however. For a short distance along the northeast edge of Woodville, the Penobscot River forms the boundary between Penobscot and Aroostook counties. There is a very small portion of river channel at this location, under the jurisdiction of the reservation, which lies within Aroostook County. The portion of the reservation that extends into Aroostook County measures less than , all of it water, with no population. Treatment of the reservation by the State of Maine, and by the Census Bureau, has varied over time. Prior to 1900, the main body of the present-day reservation appears to have been part of Old Town, and its population was included with Old Town's, not broken out separately. In 1900 and 1910, the Census provided a separate breakout within Penobscot County for what was labeled “Indian Island”, apart from any town. The 1920, 1930 and 1940 censuses reverted to the pre-1900 convention of including the reservation's population largely or entirely with Old Town. Since the 1950 Census, the reservation has been considered a distinct entity, independent of any regular municipality, and has been given its own population breakout in each census. It is unclear how long the river channel has been considered part of the reservation; the portion of the reservation within Aroostook County first appeared in the 2000 Census. The population of the reservation has been recorded as follows: 1900: 269 1910: 320 1920: not reported separately 1930: not reported separately 1940: not reported separately 1950: 323 1960: 383 1970: 317 1980: 458 1990: 476 2000: 562 Notes 1900 Census Various sources contain conflicting information on the status of Mattamiscontis at different points in time. The Census reported Mattamiscontis as a town in 1900, but not in any later Censuses. One source indicates that Mattamiscontis was organized as a plantation in 1907. No subsequent mention of Mattamiscontis as a plantation has been found, however, and the Census listed it as an unorganized township in all censuses from 1910 on. This article shows Mattamiscontis as a town in 1900; assumes that it disincorporated in 1907 (based on the above source showing it organizing as a plantation in that year, as no other date of disincorporation has been found); assumes that if it in fact operated as a plantation after 1907, it could not have held this status for long; and shows it as an unorganized township in all censuses since 1910. 1910 Census Summit appears to have been organized as a plantation for a time in the late 19th century and early 20th century, but the author of this article has been unable to locate a date for its surrender of organization. One source shows it as a plantation as of 1895, and the Census listed it as a plantation in the 1890 through 1910 censuses. From the 1920 Census onward, Summit is shown as an unorganized township. Based on this information, this article shows it as a plantation in 1900 and 1910, and as an unorganized township from 1920 on. 1970 Census The Census Bureau made a number of revisions to 1970 census totals subsequent to their initial release. The 1970 total for the city of Old Town was originally reported as 9,057; and for the Penobscot Indian Island Reservation, 1. The totals were later revised to those shown in the lists above. This was apparently done to correct an assignment error between these entities; the collective population of the two is the same using either set of figures, so the county total was not affected.

It takes its name from Slusen, a lock immediately to the south, regulating water levels in the harbor. Previously the site of heavy industry and part of the Southern Docklands of Port of Copenhagen, Sluseholmen has, since the turn of the millennium, undergone massive redevelopment, transforming it into a mainly residential district known for its canals and maritime atmosphere. It is connected to Teglholmen by the Teglværk Bridge. History Sluseholmen viewed from the Lock House in the 1930s Sluseholmen used to be dominated by heavy industry, including a Ford car factory. As industry left the area, a plan was conceived to develop Sluseholmen into a canal district. This was the result of co-operation between the Dutch architect Sjoerd Soeters, Arkitema, the Port of Copenhagen and the City of Copenhagen. Construction started in 2004, the first residents arrived in 2007, and by 2008 development of the new canal district had been completed. Sluseholmen today Canal District Canal District Sluseholmen today is dominated by the Sluseholmen Canal District development of 1,150 apartments, located on artificial islands and separated by dug-out canals. Metropolis Next to the canal district at the end of a pier extending from the tip of the peninsula, stands the Metropolis, a residential high-rise development designed by the experimental British architectural firm Future Systems. Its design has been inspired by the control tower on Langebro. Valby Boat Club Along the eastern waterfront of the canal district lies a row of old, brightly painted wooden sheds, belonging to Valby Boat Club. When the canal district was planned, the initial intention was to relocate the boat club and demolish the sheds. Ultimately it was decided to spare the boat club and its premises to preserve the maritime atmosphere, create an appealing juxtaposition of old and new, and strengthen the sense of place. The boat club also has a restaurant open to the public. Harbour Bath In late 2011, the third Copenhagen Harbour Bath opened at Sluseholmen. It was designed by Kasper Danielsen Arkitekter. Others The Teglværksbroen Bridge connecting Sluseholmen to Teglholmen opened in January 2011. The bridge was designed by the Danish architectural firm Hvidt & Mølgaard. Future projects Transport Sluseholmen had a reputation for poor public transport serving the area. This was due to the long delay in building a bridge to Teglholmen, originally planned to open in 2007. After the inauguration of Teglværksbroen Bridge in January 2011, bus line 30 (which previously by-passed the area) was diverted to Sluseholmen, connecting the neighborhood to the Copenhagen Metro (Bella Center Station - 5 minute ride) and Copenhagen Central Station - Vesterport S-train Station, a 10-15 minute ride depending on traffic. Since September 2009, Sluseholmen has been served by Route 901/902 of the Copenhagen Harbour Buses.

Active until 1980, Challenge for Change used film and video production to illuminate the social concerns of various communities within Canada, with funding from eight different departments of the Canadian government. The impetus for the program was the belief that film and video were useful tools for initiating social change and eliminating poverty. In total, the program would lead to the creation of over 200 films and videos: approximately 145 works in English and more than 60 in French. The collection notably included 27 films by Colin Low about life on Fogo Island, Newfoundland, produced in 1967. Known collectively as The Fogo Process, these Fogo Island films had an enormous impact on the future direction of the program, and were created thanks to the vision of Newfoundland academic Donald Snowden, who saw a need for a community media project as early as 1965. Started by John Kemeny, Colin Low, Fernand Dansereau and Robert Forget, and later run by George C. Stoney, the Challenge for Change program was designed to give voice to the \\"voiceless.\\" A key aspect of Challenge for Change was the transfer of control over the filmmaking process from professional filmmakers to community members, so that ordinary Canadians in underrepresented communities could tell their own stories on screen. Community dialogue and government responses to the issues were crucial to the program and took precedence over the \\"quality\\" of the films produced. The French-language Societé Nouvelle program was established under the direction of executive producer Léonard Forest. As the program developed, responsibility for the film production was put increasingly into the hands of community members, who both filmed events and had a say in the editing of the films, through advance screenings open only to those who were the subjects of the films. The program was the subject of a 1968 NFB documentary. It was also explored in an episode of the NFB Pioneers series on the Documentary Channel. It is the focus of a collection of essays and archival documents edited by Thomas Waugh, Michael Brendan Baker, and Ezra Winton, Challenge for Change: Activist Documentary at the National Film Board of Canada (McGill-Queen's University Press, 2010). The Fogo Process Fogo Island was a watershed moment for Challenge for Change with the \\"Fogo Process,\\" as it came to be known, becoming a model for using media as a tool for participatory community development. The idea for the Fogo Process originated in 1965, prior to the start of Challenge for Change, when Donald Snowden, then Director of the Extension Department at Memorial University of Newfoundland was dismayed by the urban focus of the Economic Council of Canada's \\"Report on Poverty in Canada.\\" Snowden wanted to produce a series of films to present how the people of Newfoundland felt about poverty and other issues. In 1967, with Challenge for Change already underway, Snowden discussed his ideas with Low and introduced him to the university's Fogo Island field officer Fred Earle. Low credited Earle with sparking his interest in the project: \\"I went to Fogo Island mainly because I was impressed by Fred Earle. I had an idea if nothing more happened I could make a film about a fine community development worker who would help justify our involvement.\\" The opening voiceover narration to Introduction to Fogo Island also testifies to his key role, stating that Earle \\"was born and raised in Fogo Island. He knows, and is known, by all its people.... we, as outsiders, felt that we could never go into such a community without the help of such a person.\\" In the films, Fogo Islanders identified a number of key issues: the inability to organize, the need for communication, the resentment felt towards resettlement and the anger that the government seemed to be making decisions about their future with no consultation. Low decided to show the films to the people of Fogo and thirty-five separate screenings were held with the total number of viewers reaching 3,000. It became clear that while people were not always comfortable discussing issues with each other face-to-face, they were comfortable explaining their views on film. By watching themselves and their neighbours on screen, islanders began to realize that they were all experiencing the same problems. There were concerns at Memorial University over the political consequences of criticisms of the government expressed in the films. It was decided that the Premier of Newfoundland and his cabinet should view the films. This had the effect of allowing fishermen to talk to their cabinet ministers. The Minister of Fisheries, Aidan Maloney, also asked to respond to criticisms on film. This facilitated a two-way communication between community members and decision makers. The films contributed to an island-wide sense of community and assisted people in looking for alternatives to resettlement. Projects Indian Film Crew The Indian Film Crew was a pioneering First Nations film program in Challenge for Change. Their credits include the 1969 documentary These Are My People. Working Mothers Series A collection of eleven films from 1974-1975 produced and directed by NFB icon Kathleen Shannon. The films focus on ordinary women and capture the contradictions and frustrations of their daily lives. The series laid the foundation for the launch of the National Film Board's women's unit, known colloquially as Studio D. Shannon was the founder and first Executive Producer. Montreal VTR St-Jacques, directed by Bonnie Sherr Klein, chronicles the efforts of Dorothy Todd Hénaut as she trains community members in video production as they organize themselves to fight the city of Montreal for affordable and accessible medical care. VTR St-Jacques was the first Canadian community-made video and numerous showings across Canada and the U.S. inspired a wealth of similar projects.

In 2007, the NFB launched Filmmaker-in-Residence a cross-media project based on the Challenge for Change model, with frontline health care workers, in partnership with St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto.

Also known by the alternative title Treason, it is an anti-communist and anti-Soviet film about the story of József Mindszenty, a Roman Catholic cardinal from Hungary.Shaw p.110 Mindszenty spoke out against the Nazi occupation of his country during World War II, as well as the later Communist regime. Because of his opposition to the Soviet regime, Mindszenty was arrested and tortured. After his release, he took refuge in the US Embassy in Budapest for many years, maintaining his support for the Hungarians who wanted an end to the Russian occupation. Synopsis The film uses the framing device of a speech to members of the Overseas Press Club of America by a journalist who has just returned from Budapest where he witnessed the treason trial of Mindszenty. He also tells the story of Stephanie Varna, a young teacher who decides to stake a moral stand against Communism despite her love for a Russian officer. Production The film was inspired by the book As We See Russia written by members of the Overseas Press Club. It was produced by the Anglo-American company Eagle-Lion. Art Direction was by the German emigre Rudi Feld. It was part of a cycle of anti-communist British and American films released in the late 1940s and early 1950s as the Cold War intensified.

Tsuzuki gets along with most of the employees of Meifu, with the notable exceptions of Hakushaku, who constantly hits on him, and Terazuma, with whom he has a fierce rivalry. Tsuzuki's relationship with Muraki is very tumultuous; although Tsuzuki hates him for his cruelty towards other people, Tsuzuki's desire to sacrifice himself rather than hurt anyone else prevents him from outright killing Muraki. :Though he is easily one of the most cheerful members of the cast, he hides a dark secret from his past. Both manga and anime reference terrible deeds he committed in life. It is suggested that Tsuzuki murdered many people, whether intentionally or not; this is brought to Tsuzuki's attention during his demonic possession by Sargantanas, a powerful demon who appears in the Devil's Trill Arc. Doctor Muraki reveals to him from his grandfather's research that Tsuzuki was a patient of the elder Muraki and that Tsuzuki is, in fact, not quite human. During that time, he stayed alive without food, water, or sleep for eight years, and was incapable of dying from wounds, as shown by the many times he tried to commit suicide but failed but for one last time. Muraki suggested that Tsuzuki may possess demon blood [shown by the fact that he has purple eyes], and Tsuzuki found this incredibly hard to deal with. :Tsuzuki wields the power of 12 Shikigami as well as o-fuda magic. He also has an incredibly high stamina, able to take massive damage to his body without being killed and healing almost immediately. Though this is later shown to be a trait for all Shinigami, he was the first one shown to have this ability, which appears to be tied to his pre-death abilities. Hisoka Kurosaki :, voiced by Liam O'Brien (English), and Mayumi Asano (Japanese) is a 16-year-old Shinigami and Tsuzuki's current partner. He possesses strong empathy, which allows him to feel the emotions of others, read thoughts, see memories, and pick up imprints of clairvoyance off inanimate objects. :He came from a tradition-oriented family, and he was trained in traditional Japanese martial arts. His parents were afraid of his spiritual powers, which they considered unfit for their heir as well as something that could unfurl the familiar secret; so as a child he was often locked in a cellar when caught using his empathy. :When he was 13 years old he went out under the sakura trees near his home and stumbled across Muraki in the process of murdering an unknown woman. In order to keep him from exposing the crime, Muraki tortured Hisoka (the anime shows non-graphic rape) and cursed him to a slow death that gradually drained his life over three years. The curse is still active after his death, and visible in the form of red marks all over Hisoka's body, which reappear during encounters with Muraki, particularly in dreams. It is implied that they will disappear with Muraki's death, and only then will the curse be lifted. After Hisoka died, he became a shinigiami in order to discover the cause of his death since the doctor erased his memories of it. :Hisoka enjoys reading, and spends much of his time at the library by himself. His health even in the afterlife does not seem to be particularly well, and he has a tendency to faint. His lack of training and strength in comparison to Tsuzuki is also painfully apparent to him. However, he is a capable detective, and clever in subterfuge. It's also revealed that Hisoka has a fear of the dark. :Although extremely reserved to the point of coldness, Hisoka deeply cares for other people. When Tsuzuki regains his suicidal tendencies, Hisoka comforts him and ends up preventing him from committing suicide once again. Hisoka also has a strong urge to take care of Tsuzuki, even though Tsuzuki drives him crazy sometimes. He maintains comfortable relationships with the rest of his co-workers, with the noticeable exception of Saya and Yuma, who constantly try to play with him like a doll. :Besides his empathy, Hisoka has also been trained in basic ofuda and defensive magic by Chief Konoe. Later in the series, he goes to seek out a Shikigami for himself in order to increase his power. Hisoka's first Shikigami is a Spanish-speaking potted cactus named Riko, a defensive and water-type Shiki. Hisoka is also adept in traditional martial arts, particularly archery, and kendo. His favorite color is blue, his favorite hobby is reading and his motto is \\"save money\\". Kazutaka Muraki :, voiced by Edward MacLeod in English, and by Sho Hayami in Japanese, is the primary antagonist in Yami no Matsuei. His angelic appearance and characteristics serve to contrast with his brutal nature. :Muraki's psychological troubles appear to have begun in childhood with his mother and his half-brother Saki. Muraki's mother collected dolls, and she is shown as treating him as though he were a doll as well. Muraki's love of dolls and his collecting of dolls is a motif throughout the manga and anime, paralleling what he does with real people. In the anime, it is suggested that Saki killed Muraki's parents when they were still children (in the Kyoto arc, Muraki has a flashback of his mother's funeral and sees Saki smirking during the procession) and later tried to kill him in a craze. However, in the manga, it is not clear what Saki's role was other than disrupting Muraki's childhood, and Muraki describes himself as his mother's murderer. Whatever the circumstances, Saki was shot by one of the family's guards, and Muraki became obsessed with bringing back Saki in order to kill him himself. Thus, Muraki learned of Tsuzuki while researching his grandfather's notes, becoming obsessed with Tsuzuki's body; both carnally and scientifically. In the manga it is clear what Muraki desires, but the anime had to censor such extremes, and so Muraki's advances toward Tsuzuki were shown as hints of sexual harassment. :Throughout the story, Muraki manipulates souls of the dead, often killing the people himself, in hopes of drawing the attention of the Shinigami, in particular, Tsuzuki. :Muraki is an expert manipulator, fronting as a good doctor who laments over his inability to save lives, while hiding his private life as a serial killer. As a respected physician, Muraki has many connections throughout Japan among powerful patrons, but in the anime and manga, he is mostly seen in the company of his close friend Oriya and his old teacher, Professor Satomi. Muraki also has a childhood sweetheart by the name of Ukyou, but very little is known about her, other than that she appears to draw evil spirits to her and that her health is poor. During the Kyoto Arc, Muraki discredits his good persona, contrasting himself to Professor Satomi before silencing him.SATOMI: My research is to benefit humankind! MURAKI: Benefit humankind, you say? That is what makes our two missions different. You research in order to give life to others. My research is to kill. Being a serial killer, Muraki has numerous victims, the most significant of which is Hisoka Kurosaki, whom he raped before placing a curse on him that wiped Hisoka's memory of the event and eventually killed him in the form of a terminal illness. Later, when Hisoka is a shinigami, Muraki forces the boy to recall the night that he cursed him. Throughout both the anime and manga, it's shown that Muraki often refers to Hisoka as a doll. :Some readers believed that because of his different colored eyes, he may be a guardian of one of the four gates of GenSouKai (see Wakaba Kannuki). However, in the King of Swords arc (volume three in the manga), a scene where Tsuzuki knocks out the fake eye reveals that Muraki's right eye is not real and that it is mechanical. The origin and nature of Muraki's supernatural abilities remain an enigma: he is human (with certain vampiric traits, such as feeding off peoples' life energy [it is theorized that he is an energy vampire]), he is alive (not a Shinigami), yet he raises a dead girl to be a zombie, seals and opens Hisoka's memory by mere touch, controls creature spirits similar to Shikigami, enters Meifu by himself and teleports Tsuzuki to another location. In the finale, Muraki refers to himself as a Descendant of Darkness like Tsuzuki. It is hinted that Muraki is bisexual which shown quite often in the series when he also made some sexual advances towards Tsuzuki even to a point where he almost tries to kiss him. Supporting Shinigami and supernatural characters Chief Konoe :Konoe is the boss of the Shokan Division of EnmaCho, and is Tsuzuki's superior. He has known Tsuzuki for all of the latter's career, and is one of the few characters who knows Tsuzuki's mysterious past before he became a shinigami. Konoe uses his influence to protect Tsuzuki from other higher-ups in Meifu. Konoe is an older man who is often gruff with his employees. He is known for having a sweet tooth and according to an author's note in volume 2 is a black belt in an unknown martial art. He is voiced by Chunky Mon in English, and Tomomichi Nishimura in Japanese. Seiichiro Tatsumi :, voiced by Walter Pagen in English, and Toshiyuki Morikawa in Japanese, is the secretary of the Shokan division. In addition to this position, which allows him control over department finances and thus substantial influence over Chief Konoe, he is seen to partner with Watari when working on a case. He also assists Tsuzuki and Hisoka on multiple cases. :In volume 5 of the manga, it is revealed that Tatsumi was Tsuzuki's third partner. This only lasted for three months until Tatsumi quit, unable to handle Tsuzuki's emotional breakdowns which paralleled those of his mother, a well-born woman whose death he blames himself for. His relationship with Tsuzuki, though partially resolved in volume 5, remains uncertain and often underlaced by guilt (on Tatsumi's part) over their past partnership and protectiveness. However, petty conflicts often arise over issues with department finances, most particularly in the cost of rebuilding the library after Tsuzuki destroys it (twice). :In addition to the standard abilities of shinigami, he also has the ability to manipulate shadows both as weapons and as a means of transport. Yutaka Watari :, voiced by Eric Stuart in English, and Toshihiko Seki in Japanese, is 24 years old and a close friend of Tsuzuki's who works for the sixth sector, Henjoucho (which includes Osaka and Kyoto). Nevertheless, he is most often seen in the lab and he is accompanied by Tatsumi when he works in the field. Though technically a mechanical engineer (he has a PhD in engineering), he is basically a scientist who invents whatever comes to mind, most often a sex change potion. He is also in charge of computer maintenance & repair. Though sharing a cheery demeanor similar to Tsuzuki's, whenever something befalls one of his friends he becomes very and suddenly angry. :One of his near-constant companions is an owlet named \\"003\\" (001 is a toucan and 002 is a penguin, they stay in Watari's lab). Watari's dream is to create a sex change potion, his self-declared motives being to understand the female mind. He often experimentally tests his creations on both himself and on Tsuzuki, relying on the latter's fondness for sweets to ensure his cooperation. Aside from his apparent familiarity in the laboratory, Watari also has the ability to bring his drawings to life despite the fact that he is a poor artist. According to the author, his hair was bleached blonde by excessive chlorine in a swimming pool. :Late volumes of the manga reveal his past employment with the Five Generals, who were involved in the Mother Project, the supercomputer of Meifu. Saya Torii and Yuma Fukiya :As the acting Shinigami for Hokkaidō, the Ninth District, Saya and Yuma are often snowed in, thus limiting their interaction with the rest of the cast. They are bubbly, very affectionate girls, often throwing themselves at Tsuzuki and Hisoka in overly enthusiastic embraces, though they hold a particular fondness for Hisoka and his attractive, feminine appearance. However, they are sincere in their wanting everyone to be good friends. :Both have the same light-brown hair and petite form; Saya is generally seen as the quieter of the two, although she has her moments of manic energy like her partner Yuma. Hajime Terazuma :Terazuma is not mentioned in the anime version (though he is seen briefly in the opening, the first episode, and the last). However, in the manga, he serves as Tsuzuki's rival. He is first introduced in volume 4 of the manga, and states that he is from the EnMaCho ShoKan Division, and is the junior partner of the fourth district Chūgoku. Terazuma was a policeman from Hiroshima in life, which gave him a rough and pessimistic demeanor, as well as a strong sense of duty. He has a parasitic Shikigami (Kagan Kuroshuki), which altered elements of his face to appear more feral. Though he can transform at will into his Shikigami, when touched by a female or exposed to water Terazuma involuntarily becomes a raging beast. In volume four of the manga, he had an embarrassing experience of transforming after touching Hisoka, which causes him humiliation whenever brought up by other characters. :Terazuma and Tsuzuki fight frequently, mostly because Terazuma hates the fact Tsuzuki controls 12 Shikigami, when he was forced to get his own Shikigami and cannot control it, and because he thinks Tsuzuki might steal Wakaba away from him. The rivalry between Tsuzuki and Terazuma has gone far enough to destroy the newly built library in Meifu, of which the damage costs were taken out of both their paychecks. Wakaba Kannuki :Wakaba appears only twice briefly in the anime including the opening, and not particularly often in the manga. She first appears in volume 4 in the manga and is revealed as Terazuma's partner. Wakaba is a miko or priestess of sorts; a job that ran in her family. As such, she has strong spiritual powers, which she uses to return Terazuma to his human form on the frequent occasions where he is provoked into transforming. She is also often the cause of these changes thanks to the possibly mutual crush they share, though Terazuma's condition has significantly limited this. She is also the guardian of one of the four gates into Gensoukai, the south or Suzaku Gate. This role is the cause of her heterochromia. She also a high school student when she's not working with her partner. Gushoshin :The Gushoshin are based upon twin mythological Japanese figures who dwell in the underworld and record the deeds of human lives in preparation for final judgment. One is known to record the good deeds; the other, the bad deeds. In Yami no Matsuei, they are depicted as small, bird-like creatures that talk. They work in the library, protect its contents which include a database of deaths, and often provide research support to the main characters. Hakushaku :The Hakushaku is variously translated as 'Count' or 'Earl.' He has no other given name. He is the keeper of the Castle of Candles, a great manor filled with candles whose flames represent every human life. He is invisible when he wants to be (as we see part of him in human form in book 9), using a mask and gloves so people can tell where he is when he's not wearing one of his costumes. His main duty is snuffing out the candles and recording the deceased, but he seems to spend much of his free time entertaining or looking at pictures of Tsuzuki, with whom he is obsessed with and cares deeply about. The Hakushaku has done favors of extending the lives of several people for Tsuzuki over the years, and this debt makes Tsuzuki very nervous, on account of the nature of the favors he may have to return. The Hakushaku features most prominently in the manga, in which readers learn he has a book that writes stories using characters based on the rest of the Yami no Matsuei cast. In the book, Tsuzuki's feminine form [whom Tsuzuki meets and calls \\"Ruka\\" after his sister] is to be wed to the Hakushaku's character (though in the end she falls in love with Butler, the book version of Tatsumi, representing the past relationship between Tsuzuki and Tatsumi). The Hakushaku also hosts many parties in the manga, ranging from a cherry blossom viewing party to more formal evening balls. Hakushaku's main servant is a zombie-like creature in a pink apron, named \\"Watson\\". Enma- Daioh :The Great King Enma is the ruler of Meifu. In Yami no Matsuei, the Shokan/Summons division reports directly to him. Though obviously powerful, he is a mysterious character about which little is known. He has a particular interest in the work of shinigami Tsuzuki. Enma seems intent on Tsuzuki remaining in his afterlife, but the true motivations behind his attitude towards him have yet to be revealed. Absent from the anime, Enma-Daioh is rarely seen in the manga, but appears to have a dragon-like form in the second manga. In the later chapters of the Kamakura/GenSouKai Arcs, it is shown that Enma-Daioh has a human form. He is a mysterious character with long black hair whose eyes are never shown, adding to the mystery of his character. Supporting human characters ; Hijiri Minase : A brilliant teenage violinist who is the star pupil and a possible genius in his music school, he appears in the \\"Devil's Trill arc\\". His appearance is based on one of the original designs for Hisoka, resulting in the pair being nearly identical. An incident involving his accidental contract with a demon (due to a cornea transplant) forces the shinigami to step in the Devil's Trill arc. : He is voiced by Jack Lingo in English and Minami Takayama in Japanese. ;Kazusa Otonashi :Kazusa Otonashi is a young girl whom Hijiri befriends in the Devil's Trill arc. Her father was a violinist before he died and his corneas were donated to Hijiri. Kazusa gives Hijiri her father's violin after he loses his own, unaware that it is possessed by a demon. Kazusa begins avoiding Hijiri later, but it turns out that she had seen the demon hiding in the violin. Her father, as it turns out had sold her life to the devil in exchange for becoming a famous violinist. The devil knew that, through Hijiri's cornea Kazusa's father is still alive and so he tries to kill Hijiri and take Kazusa. :Despite efforts to protect Kazusa, she ultimately dies when she pushes Hijiri away from falling debris caused by the demon's battle with Byakko and Suzaku, getting crushed by a collapsing pillar in the process. In the manga, she is a shinigami after she dies but in the anime this is never stated, causing some confusion when she is seen, alive and well, with Tsuzuki and Hisoka at the end of the arc. She makes no further appearances afterward. :She is voiced by Tomoko Kawakami in Japanese and Beth McGowan in English. ; Tsubaki Kakyouin : A very frail girl nicknamed \\"Tsubaki-hime\\" (Princess Tsubaki) in the anime, but nicknamed Camille in the manga (after the prostitute in the novel The Lady of the Camellias by Alexandre Dumas, fils), and daughter of a millionaire. She appears in the \\"King of Swords arc\\". She was born with a heart defect that Muraki corrected with a transplant during her childhood; after learning this, Tsubaki acquired a crush on Muraki, not knowing that the heart she received was the one of her old friend Eileen, a flower girl who kept her company and whom Muraki killed (along with other people who were involved in human organs traffic) in order to harvest her heart for Tsubaki. : Not long after this surgery, Muraki told her where her heart had come from and proceeded to manipulate her newly found knowledge into an alternate personality who, calling herself Eileen and claiming to be the flower girl's spirit, murdered the other passengers aboard the Queen Camelia for revenge. Tsubaki appears to have been minimally aware of this and attempts to fall for Hisoka in order to detach herself from the doctor. This fails, and so Hisoka goes through with her request to kill her. In the end, he is shown very deeply disturbed after the cruise liner sinks, showing he might have harbored feelings for her as well. : She is voiced by Tara Jayne in English, and Machiko Toyashima and Kumi Sakuma in Japanese, the former playing Tsubaki, and the other playing Eileen. ; Oriya Mibu : Very little is known about Oriya. He owns Kou Kaku Rou, an elegant traditional restaurant that is secretly a brothel for the rich and powerful. He inherited this from his family, who held Kou Kaku Rou for many generations (it is described in the manga as one of the oldest, if not the oldest restaurant in Kyoto). He is a friend of Muraki's from college, and Muraki's only known friend. He wears a very distinctive and ornate kimono and is often seen smoking a traditional Japanese kiseru pipe; he practices kendo and is an expert with the katana. He has very strong, somewhat ambiguous feelings toward Muraki. In the most recent continuation of the series, he is shown to be hosting and caring for Ukyou, Muraki's childhood sweetheart. : Though he is usually seen as a neutral or sympathetic figure in the story, he is also an active collaborator of Muraki's. He has helped Muraki cover up his murders through his network of high-ranking officials, and in return, Muraki has disposed of troublesome elements among the women of his brothel. : He is voiced by Kazuhiko Inoue in Japanese and Jack Lingo in the English. ; Saki Shidou : Muraki's older, half-brother. They are nearly the same age and look very similar, though Saki has blond-brown hair. Saki was the result of his father's philandering with one of his patients. At about the age of 16, Saki was brought to live with Muraki in their household. Muraki credits this as having ruined his life by destroying his family. In the anime, Saki is directly responsible for the deaths of Muraki's parents, though in the manga Muraki says he killed his own mother. ; Ukyou Sakuraiji : Muraki's fianceé and Oriya's friend, who works for Sakura Pharmaceuticals. She has the appearance of a high-school girl, despite being in her thirties. She is two years younger than Muraki and Oriya, and went to school with them. After Muraki's disappearance following the events in Kyoto, Ukyou began visiting Oriya every year in his place. She seems to be a relatively good person with rather poor health. ;Hisae Tojyo :Hisae Tojyo is a nineteen-year-old dancer who has a small part in the first story from the second book, though she does not appear in the anime series. Her mother died when she was very young; following the event, she and her brother raised themselves. Later in her life she grew very ill from an unspecified disease, and on the way to visit her at the hospital, her brother died in a car accident; as such, she blames herself for his death. Afterward she checked out of the hospital despite her failing health in order to carry out her and her brother's dream to make their dance academy successful. However, her name was on the Kiseki, and a few months later Tsuzuki shows up to deliver the summons and ultimately becomes involved. She has also been in love with Tsuzuki later in the short story but died. :Hisae is often found wearing dresses, has dark hair, and is much notably shorter than Tsuzuki. She can have a temper, and jumps to conclusions most of the time without waiting for further explanation. ;Nagare Kurosaki :Nagare Kurosaki is Hisoka's father, and appears only later in the manga series, though never in the anime. Strict and traditional, he will seem to do anything to keep his family's secret under control. He appears ill to Watari and Tatsumi, but his poor physical condition is probably due to the swamp god Yatonokami possessing him. It is also noted that Hisoka gets much of his looks from his father, and they do, indeed, appear almost identical in hair and eye colour. The Shikigami The shikigami in Yami no Matsuei are guardian spirits; creatures which can be summoned by shinigami. When in battle in the living world, shikigami appear as various types of mythological creatures. There are different kinds of shikigami, roughly divided by the four elements, earth, wind, fire, and water. The majority of shinigami can only summon two or three shikigami. The single exception is Asato Tsuzuki, who commands the power of twelve high-ranked shikigami. They include the following: * Byakko: a white tiger : The guardian of the West. As a human (though complete with a striped tail), Byakko is similar to Tsuzuki in his habit of skipping work to have a nap, and being very lively and exuberant. * Suzaku: a red \\"firebird\\" or phoenix, the first we see in the anime. She is the guardian of the South. : In GensouKai, Suzaku is a dark-haired, fierce-tempered woman. Since Kyoto, she has born a grudge against her fellow fire-type Touda for the part he played in assisting Tsuzuki in his latest attempt of suicide. She is devoted to Tsuzuki, as shown by her misguided attempt to protect him in Kyoto. She also loves to drink and eat just like Tsuzuki, who affectionately calls her \\"Nee-san\\". * Souryuu: a blue dragon, the representative of the Emperor of GensouKai (see below) : The guardian of the East. Souryuu is one of the strongest and most highly ranked of the Shikigami, other than Kurikara. He is suspicious of newcomers to his realm, and perceives Hisoka as a threat to its stability to the point of attacking him. Despite once being close to Kurikara, after the civil war he used the power granted to him by the Golden Emperor in order to seal Kurikara away. He has two children: Koujin and Tenko, thunder and water shikigami respectively who also serve Tsuzuki. * Genbu: the black tortoise/snake, the guardian of the North. : Genbu appears in human form as a tiny old man who is generally held in contempt by servants for his strange behavior. Nevertheless, he has on occasion offered advice to both Tsuzuki and Hisoka. * Kouchin: A court musician who spends her time flirting and playing music, though she displays some knowledge of the civil war in Gensoukai. * Rikujo: An astrologer shikigami and Genbu's student with several pairs of eyes on his hands and face. He appears to have a confrontational relationship with Souryuu. * Taimo: A spellbreaker with a completely blank face who occasionally offers advice to Tsuzuki. *Tenko: The daughter of Souryuu, and Kijin's younger sister. She is a water shiki. *Kijin: The son of Souryuu, and Tenko's older brother. He is a thunder shiki. * Daion: A gag shikigami who lives in a pot that has a mouth and eyes cut into it. * Tenku: A large shrine that the others dwell in who also served as Touda's prison prior to Tsuzuki's arrival. He is shown to bear a grudge towards the former. * Touda: a huge, black, winged serpent. The only shikigami capable of destroying a shinigami. : When in human form, Touda wears a visor over his eyes to inhibit his powers. He does as Tsuzuki asks, but only exactly as he asks. Nonetheless, he is devoted in his own way to Tsuzuki, who freed him from eternal imprisonment within Tenku for unknown crimes. It is suggested that his crimes were actually missions the Golden Emperor assigned him privately, then punished him for publicly. He vowed to help Tsuzuki since it was the only way out of his imprisonment and agreed to wear the visor that also seems to alter his memories as well as limit his strength. * Kurikara: a fire dragon type. Thought to be the most powerful shikigami in all of Gensoukai. : In his human form he a very short male with the typical long ears of the dragon types and a scar that runs down the center of his forehead, and a second one that runs over his right eye from wounds that Souryuu inflicted on him. He and Souryuu used to be very close friends until after the civil war when the latter sealed him away. It is later revealed that he chose to defend humans against the Golden Emperor during the war, though he tells Hisoka that he hates them. The latter is currently attempting to gain him as one of his own shikigami. It is thought that Kurikara is a large black steel dragon. There are two other characters who have shikigami: Hisoka Kurosaki and Hajime Terazuma. -Hisoka is in control of a small, first level water Shiki named Riko. He can contain water in his body and spray it at will, and enjoys singing into a microphone and speaking bits of Spanish and English. He died protecting Hisoka from an enraged Kurikara. Hisoka then tried to attack Kurikara, but was stopped by Kotaro. -Terazuma carries the only known example of a parasitic type of shikigami, KaGanKokuShunGei. It roughly translates to 'Red-Eyed Black Lion'. When he is touched by a girl or a boy who looks girly (Hisoka), he transforms into a raging black beast that breathes fire. The beast is only contained by Wakaba's quick action slapping sealing fudas on its forehead, and she has admitted that she can only seal 'Kuro-chan'two times in a row per day. Because of Terazuma's practical non-existence in the anime, its form is never seen on screen. Tsuzuki stated that a bad match between a parasitic type and its host results in markings and other irregular deformities of the face, eyes, or teeth. This leads one to presume that Terazuma is a prime example of a 'bad match'. GensouKai The later manga volumes explain how the shikigami live an independent existence in a dimension separate from but connected to Meifu. This \\"imaginary world\\", GensouKai, is populated by many shikigamis. Like the Meifu, GensouKai appears to be an individual realm and society in its own right. The shikigamis inhabit the world in their human forms (avatars). When he visits, this causes much confusion for Hisoka, who searches for a \\"tiger, or a red bird\\", ignorant of the fact that the shikigamis in their own world do, in most cases, resemble humans. GensouKai is allegedly ruled over by an Emperor. However, the \\"Golden Emperor\\" as he is known, has not been seen for many years. It is thought by some that he is dead. The Emperor's representative is Souryuu, the Protector of the East.

It was originally proposed in 1665 by the commission created by Louis XIV of France to evaluate Pierre- Paul Riquet's plan for the canal enterprise. The original reservoir in support of the canal was at Bassin de St. Ferréol. In 1776 a link was provided between the canal and the Aude and the Canal de la Robine at Narbonne. This connection and an increase in barge traffic led to a requirement for more water. A short time after the dam was complete, leaks were found. They were stopped by pouring a large quantity of quick lime into the reservoir. The particles of lime thus suspended and were carried into the leaking areas and filled all the openings in the joints of masonry and even into the stone. The feeder canal from the basin to the canal is 52,552m. The basin covers some 24 hectares and contains some 1,600,000 cubic metres of water. It flows into the Bassin de St. Ferréol.

Like many post offices in small towns from that era designed by Treasury Department Supervising Architect Louis Simon, it uses the Colonial Revival architectural style. Within that style of post office in New York, it is distinguished by the raised parapet on its roofline, found on only two other post offices in the state, and the asymmetrical arrangement of its front facade, very unusual on a post office of that size erected at that time. In 1989 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the only building in the village of Granville yet listed. Building The post office is situated on a narrow lot on the south side of Main Street. The surrounding neighborhood is entirely composed of two-story commercial buildings. There is a narrow alley between the post office and the building to its east, and a driveway on the west leading to a parking lot in the rear. It is set back from the street slightly more than its neighbors, with plantings and a flagpole in front. It is a five-by-six-bay one-and-a- half–story steel frame structure on a raised foundation of slate on the front and cast stone on the rear and sides. The upper floors are faced in brick laid in common bond. The gabled roof is shingled in slate with raised parapets topped by stone coping at the gable ends. The bricks of the parapets are stacked to appear as a false chimney. The four-bay rear wing has a flat roof with stone coping; a loading dock projects from it. The northern (front) facade has the recessed, arched entryway placed asymmetrically, in the westernmost bay. It is decorated with a marble scrolled keystone and end blocks. The entryway itself, level with the sidewalk, has a coffered ceiling and paneled reveal. It is topped with a fanlight. Marble piers 9 feet (3 m) high are at either corner of the front. The window on the easternmost bay is smaller than the middle three. All have splayed brick lintels, marble keystones and sills. Above them are bronze letters reading \\"UNITED STATES POST OFFICE GRANVILLE, NEW YORK\\" and a marble beltcourse setting off the mezzanine- level eyebrow windows with metal screens. Those windows, in turn, are topped with a bracketed box cornice. The entrance leads to a vestibule with stairs and another set of double wood doors to the lobby, which runs perpendicular to the main facade. It has flagstone floors and a similar dado around the walls to counter height. The ceiling is plaster with a molded cornice. The wooden tables and bulletin board are original. History Granville's first post office was established in 1797, after the village's location in New York (rather than Vermont, which it borders on the east) was settled. Like many other post offices in small towns, it was located in rented space in other buildings throughout most of the 19th century, and the first quarter of the 20th. In 1931, Congress authorized the construction of 136 new post offices in New York as an early relief measure against the onset of the Great Depression. Granville's was among them. Construction began in 1935 following the demolition of a row of stores that had occupied the site. A Maryland-based contractor did the work for the $75,000 ($ in contemporary dollars) that had been budgeted. It was completed and opened the following year. Louis A. Simon, supervising architect for the Treasury Department, designed the building in the Colonial Revival mode, standard for post offices in small communities since the early years of the 20th century. For Granville, Simon applied the style in an unusually ornate, atypical way. In addition to features like the entry arch and the cornice, its raised parapet at the gable is found on only two other post offices in the state, Dobbs Ferry downstate and Hudson Falls nearby. And while he or other Treasury postal architects sometimes used asymmetrical facades on smaller, three-bay structures like that at Whitehall to the north, Granville's is the only Depression-era five-bay post office in New York with one.

Motoyama emphasized the meditative practices of Samkhya/Yoga, karma, reincarnation and Hindu theories of the chakras. Motoyama died in September 2015 at the age of 89. Theory and Method Dr. Motoyama's philosophical system was based on his experiences of meditation. His philosophy was based on the idea that no individual philosophical system is without its faults. Because of this, his philosophy appears to be an eclectic blend of seemingly disparate philosophies, but this is far from the case. His system is centralized upon Samkhya philosophy due to its explanatory efficacy, but primarily because of its utilization by Patañjali.Awakening of the Chakras and Emancipation, p. 27. Because of the attention to detail found in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, Dr. Motoyama emphasizes the eight steps of yogic training.Toward a Superconsciousness: Meditational Theory and Practice. However, he broadens the scope of samkhya here, extending the ultimate (the isolated Purusha) beyond the limitations of being. Borrowing from Kitaro Nishida, Dr. Motoyama uses the term to define the field that sustains being itself.Being and the Logic of Interactive Function This basho is beyond the categories of being/non-being and birth/death. One who abandons individuality itself becomes a basho-being by completely annihilating themselves. This is very much in line with the Buddhist Jhānas and the Mahayana notion of Śūnyatā. Thus, basho-being is roughly synonymous with \\"buddha.\\" The basho is the limit of and that which sustains our universe, beyond which, Dr. Motoyama states, is God. In brief, Dr. Motoyama's system is a synthesis of Samkhya (atheistic), Buddhism (non-theistic) and Shinto (theism) that incorporates yogic cultivation, the energy systems of the body-mind as well as faith in God.

M. W. Turner's boatman. Greaves and one of his brothers, Henry Greaves (1844–1904), met James McNeill Whistler in 1863, introducing him to the sights of the River Thames, and becoming his studio assistants, pupils and close friends for over 20 years.Greaves biography on Answers.com The American painter later used these Thames expeditions for inspiration when painting his ‘nocturne’ views of the river at night. \\"He taught us to paint\\", Walter Greaves said, \\"and we taught him the waterman's jerk\\".E. Robins Pennell and J. Pennell, The Life of James McNeill Whistler, 2 vols. (1908); 5th edn in 1 vol. (1911) Walter Greaves had initially trained as a shipwright and boatman. The most famous of Greaves' paintings is Hammersmith Bridge on Boat-Race Day, a naïve masterpiece which he claimed to have painted when he was aged sixteen in 1862; however, since he was unreliable over dates, its history has never been settled. The Greaves brothers accompanied Whistler to life class and Walter Greaves attempted to paint portraits, some of his most successful being of their neighbour Thomas Carlyle, whom Whistler also painted. Greaves also drew and painted Whistler, sometimes in caricature, in Chelsea settings and in characteristic moods. In 1876 the Greaves brothers helped Whistler decorate The Peacock Room (now in the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.), for the shipowner Frederick Leyland. During the late 1870s Whistler began to gather a more sophisticated group of friends about himself, including Walter Sickert and Mortimer Menpes. Excluded from this distinguished circle, Greaves suffered years of neglect, misfortune and poverty before his discovery by William Marchant, proprietor of the Goupil Galleries, who exhibited Greaves's work in his London gallery in 1911.Greaves in The New York Times May 7, 1911 Greaves's new-found glory was short-lived, however: three weeks after the exhibition opened, Whistler's self-appointed biographers, Joseph Pennell and Elizabeth Pennell, damaged Greaves's reputation by claiming that he had plagiarized Whistler's work. In May 1911, Greaves sold eight letters from Whistler to his father and himself at auction.'Letter to be Sold To-day Tells the Pupil Not to Imitate the Master's Inventions' The New York Times May 25, 1911 Another exhibition of his work was held in 1922 at the Grosvenor Gallery arranged by Augustus John, William Nicholson and William Rothenstein. He was elected an honorary member of the Chelsea Arts Club. Despite the support of a few fellow painters, including Sickert, The AMICA Library Greaves again fell into obscurity and spent his last eight years as a Poor Brother of the London Charterhouse. Greaves died, unmarried, of pneumonia in the West London Hospital, Hammersmith, on 23 November 1930. He was buried in the Charterhouse graveyard at Little Hallingbury in Essex. The Tate Gallery holds examples of his work, including two self-portraits.

The term moiety should be reserved to describe the larger characteristic parts of molecules and not used to describe smaller functional groups, which are made up of atoms that participate in similar chemical reactions in most molecules that contain them. In some instances moieties may be composed of yet smaller moieties and functional groups. Moieties that constitute branches extending from the backbone of a hydrocarbon molecule, which can often be broken off and substituted with others, are called substituents or side chains. Active moiety In pharmacology, an active moiety is the part of a molecule or ion – excluding appended inactive portions – that is responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of a drug substance. Inactive appended portions of the drug substance may include either the alcohol or acid moiety of an ester, a salt (including a salt with hydrogen or coordination bonds), or other noncovalent derivative (such as a complex, chelate, or clathrate).

According to Green, \\"this was a faithful little boat\\". Born in Mississippi, Joshua came with his family to the Puget Sound region of Washington in 1886 at the age of 17. The family formed a connection with Seattle mayor Bailey Gatzert, who helped Green begin his career. He worked as a chainman, surveying for the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway, then on the sternwheeler Henry Bailey, a Puget Sound Mosquito Fleet vessel that also went up the Skagit River. In late 1889, using a $5,000 loan from Seattle banker Jacob Furth, an associate of Gatzert's, Green and three fellow officers of the Henry Bailey purchased their own sternwheeler, the Fanny Lake (or Fannie Lake).

The company survived several ship fires, as well as the Depression that followed the Panic of 1893, then prospered greatly in the Klondike Gold Rush, transporting miners and their gear to Alaska. Green continued to invest his profits. In 1903 he merged his firm with Charles E. Peabody's Alaska Steamship/Puget Sound Navigation Company, which soon brought the Mosquito Fleet to a new level.

Life and music No details are available regarding the early part of his life, but he must have been born in the late sixteenth century. Records show that he was appointed as organist at the Scuola di San Giovanni Evangelista, Venice, in 1609, when he was the preferred choice over Gabriel Sponga (a nephew of Francesco Usper).Selfridge-Field, pp 110–111 He was probably also a violinist.Dickey, p 3 Riccio is known to have published three books of vocal and instrumental music in Venice. These books include his instrumental works for recorderunusual for Venetian music at the time, although Giovanni Picchi also wrote for the instrument. The initial publication date of Riccio's Primo Libro is unknown, but the reprint dating from 1612 survives. The majority of the first book is allotted to vocal works, but in the revised edition two new instrumental canzonas are appended. One is his first known piece for recordera canzone for two flautini. His Secondo Libro, also published in Venice, appeared in 1614. His Terzo libro delle Divine Lodi published in 1620 and 1621 is the most widely known today. It comprises thirty-six vocal works and a further twelve instrumental pieces mostly described as canzonas. Most feature two main instruments (such as recorder, cornetto, violin, trombone or sometimes contemporary bassoon or dulcian). One canzona entitled La Grimantea con il tremolo is one of the first pieces to make use of the tremolo technique for the 'Flautin e Fagoto' (recorder and bassoon).Selfridge-Field, p 112 Dedications in his works suggest Riccio knew other composers such as Giovanni Picchi, Alessandro Grandi, Giovanni Battista Grillo and Giacomo Finetti.Selfridge-Field, p 111 Some of his canzonas quote from larger-scale works by Giovanni Gabrieli.

When he was about be slain, he appealed to the Lord to accept him as his vehicle, and he would serve him with fidelity.

Career   Education and academic career  He was born on via Napoleone III, on the Esquiline Hill, in the same apartment where he lived almost his entire life.Alessandra Capanna. MORETTI, Luigi Walter. Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 76 (2012), Enciclopedia Italiana di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti/Istituto della Enciclopedia italiana (Treccani) (in Italian)Luigi Walter Moretti. Biography on the website of the Polytechnic University of Bari (in Italian) He was the natural son of Luigi Rolland (1852-1921), engineer and architect, born in Rome in a Belgian family, whose most important work is Teatro Adriano, and Maria Giuseppina Moretti. He attended primary and secondary school at Collegio San Giuseppe - Istituto De Merode and from 1925 he studied at the Royal School of Architecture in Rome. In 1929, Moretti graduated with honors, with a project for a college of higher education Rocca di Papa, where he won the Giuseppe Valadier award. After degree, in 1931 he won a three-year scholarship for Roman Studies, established by the Governorate of Rome and the Royal School of Architecture. With this grant he worked with archeologist an art historian Corrado Ricci, in the arrangement of the areas east and north of Trajan's Market. In these years he also worked as assistant for the professorships of Vincenzo Fasolo (architect of Mamiani Lyceum and Duca d'Aosta Bridge, both in Rome) and Gustavo Giovannoni, at the restoration chair.  Activity in building and urban development  Gioventù Italiana del Littorio (GIL, fascist youth organization) building in Trastevere, Rome, one of the firsts Moretti's notable works Foro Mussolini, Rome (1936) In 1932, Moretti entered in competitions for the town planning of Verona, Perugia, and Faenza, for which he obtained the second place. He also entered in a competition for a council house complex in Naples. The next year, after ending the university career, with Giulio Pediconi, Mario Paniconi e Mario Tufaroli, attended at the fifth Triennale di Milano with a project for a country house designed for a scholar. In this year he also met Renato Ricci, at that time president of the Opera Nazionale Balilla (ONB), that, the following year, appointed Moretti ONB technical director, succeeding to Enrico Del Debbio. In this role Moretti designed some of the youth centres of ONB and Gioventù Italiana del Littorio: in 1933 in Piacenza and in Rome, Trastevere, in 1934 in Trecate, in 1935 a women centre in Piacenza and in 1937 another youth centre in Urbino. His work was also part of the architecture event in the art competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics. In 1937 he took over, the design of the regulatory plan of the Foro Mussolini (renamed Foro Italico after the war), where he created some of his masterpieces, such as the Academy of fencing and the Duce's Gym (both 1936) and the commemoration cell (of 1940). His are also the major planner of the Forum, enriched in the 1937 with the square of the Empire and the Stadium of Cypresses (expanded in 1953 and 1990 of other architects to become the Stadio Olimpico). Moretti's works were published in the journal Architecture. In those years he participated in the competition for the construction of the Palazzo Littorio (Casa del Fascio), a project harshly criticized by the magazine Casabella and progressive Italian architectural culture in general. In 1938 he participated in the design of the E42 (Esposizione 1942) later changed to EUR (Esposizione Universale Romana) standing for Rome World's fair. Moretti(with Fariello, Muratori and Quaroni) won the competition for the design of the Imperial Square (now Piazza Guglielmo Marconi). The large building fronting the square was never finished, but after the war the structures already constructed were used for the \\"Skyscraper Italy (Grattacielo Italia)\\" by Luigi Mattioni. He served in that period, in private practice, thanks mainly to his friendships with members of the Fascism and journalists. In the period between 1942 and 1945 Moretti disappeared from public view, to reappear in 1945, when arrested for his collaboration with fascism, was briefly imprisoned in the prison of San Victor, where he met count Adolfo Fossataro. After release, with him in November of the same year, founded Cofimprese company.  The postwar period  House \\"Il Girasole\\", Rome, 1948. Photo by Paolo Monti, 1951 (Paolo Monti Archive, BEIC) Complex between corso Italia and via Rugabella, Milan With Cofimprese, he worked to develop house-hotel buildings. The original plan was for 20 hotels which only three were built and made, before breaking up in 1949. Also in Milan for Cofimprese, designed the complex between Corso Italia and Via Rugabella The house Il Girasole (\\"The Sunflower\\") designed in 1949, and built in Rome in viale Bruno Buozzi (near via Parioli) in 1950, is one of the best known projects of the period, and is considered an early example of postmodern architecture. The building is also mentioned in the essay by Robert Venturi, Complexity and Contradiction in architecture, as an example of ambiguous architecture, poised between tradition and innovation.Robert Venturi, Complexity and contradiction in architecture, The Museum of Modern Art, 1977; p.22 According to Swiss architectural theorist Stanislaus von Moos, the Vanna Venturi House, one of Venturi's masterpiece, in its broken pediments recalls the 'duality' of the facade of Luigi Moretti's apartment house on the Via Parioli in Rome.Stanislaus von Moos, Venturi, Rauch, & Scott Brown buildings and projects, Rizzoli, 1987, p.244-246 Then Moretti designed villas for illustrious patrons, including La Villa Saracena (1954)Gio Ponti.

The journal was managed and written almost entirely by the Roman architect who made it come together in the results of his research and study on it wise public key, such abstract forms in the sculpture Baroque, discontinuity of space in Caravaggio and structures and sequences of spaces. Moretti was editorial director and editor. The magazine, printed in Milan, first by the printers E. Barigazzi, then by Lucini, was short-lived, with limited output of only seven numbers. In the decades after he released sporadically Moretti numbers, mostly monographs, in the magazine. In 1959, he released an issue dedicated to the sculptor Pietro De Laurentiis. In April 1963 published on the Space Structure of the essay collections and 1964 contemporary meaning of the wise words \\"architecture\\". And July 1968, an issue appeared in the essay Capogrossi dedicated to the famous Roman painter. It was in 1954, when Moretti decided to found an art gallery, also known as space, in Rome. Moretti was also a close associate of the French art critic and theorist Michel Tapié, with whom in 1960 Moretti co-founded the International Center of Aesthetic Research in Turin, Italy, an institution that lasted until 1987, after the death of Tapié.https://books.google.com/books?id=UZ4Gu7a7V9UC&pg;=PA591&dq;=michel+tapie+luigi+moretti&cd;=3#v=onepage&q;=michel%20tapie%20luigi%20moretti&f;=false Herschel Browning Chipp: Theories of Modern Art (1968), page 591; retrieved via Google Books, 1 April 2010 Moretti's interest in art is also evident from the tendency to collect works, particularly of the 17th century (Seicento) and antiquity.  The SGI and IRMOU  In 1957, he became a consultant of the Società Generale Immobiliare (SGI) for which he designed, among other things, the buildings at the head of the EUR. In the same year he collaborated with the Municipality of Rome and the Ministry of Public Works, working on projects for inter-municipal plan of Rome (never adopted) and the Archaeological Park, from which arose the controversy with Bruno Zevi and L'Espresso on the devastation of Appia. Also in 1957, he founded the Institute for Operations Research and Applied Mathematics Urbanism (IRMOU) with the express purpose of continuing studies on the so-called \\"parametric\\" architecture, a doctrine which drew on the application of mathematical theories in the design planning. He studied new dimensional relationships in architectural space and urban area, relating to the design of the Built Environment, with mathematical analysis, like Le Corbusier had studied the Modulor and the golden ratio. These studies were represented in 1960 with huge éclat in the press, at the XIII Triennale di Milano. In 1958, he later went on to design major residential neighborhoods, including the CEP of Livorno. In 1958 Moretti participated with Adalberto Libera, Vittorio Cafiero, Amedeo Luccichenti and Vincenzo Monaco in the project of the Olympic Village in Rome designed for the XVII Olympiad scheduled in 1960. The design of the village won in 1961 the Prix IN/ARCH 1961 for the best achievement in the region of Lacio. Moretti was also general project coordinator for urban planning and design of the residential district \\"Quartiere INCIS Decima\\" in Zona Z. XXVII Torrino of Rome. Design team included Vittorio Cafiero, Ignazio Guidi, Adalberto Libera. This housing compound on behalf of INCIS (Istituto nazionale per le case degli impiegati statali - National Institute for Housing of State Employees) was partly realized between 1960 and 1966. In this period Moretti had a significant influence on the work of the urban plan of Rome, which will be adopted by the City Council on 18 December 1962.  The latest works  Stock Exchange Tower, Tour de la Bourse, Montreal In 1962, on behalf of General Real Estate, he designed the Watergate complex (that gave its name to the 1972 political scandal of the same name, in the United States) in Washington, and also the Stock Exchange Tower (Tour de la Bourse) in Montreal, Quebec. In 1963, he again won the award IN/ARCH 1963 for best achievement in the Lazio region with the study design of two twin buildings for Esso (Exxon) in the EUR in Rome. In 1964, he was awarded the Medal for meritorious school, culture and art by President Antonio Segni. In 1965, he began a fruitful relationship with the Consulting Group Le Condotte (later merged with Italstat), taking care of the design and implementation of resettlement Thermal Boniface VIII Fiuggi, the Metropolitana di Roma in the trunk by the Termini station to Via Ottaviano in Prati, opened in 1980. As part of the work on the underground in Rome, designed the current automobile and underground bridge open in 1972, named Ponte Pietro Nenni. Another work is the underground parking for two thousand places in Villa Borghese, which opened in 1973. Participation at the International Conference on Michelangelo's Studies (1964) with the essay \\"The ideal structures of Michelangelo's architecture and of Baroque\\" led him to try a different creative experience - creating in 1964 an hour‐long biopic film about Michelangelo Buonarroti, \\"Michelangelo: The Man With Four Fouls\\", written and directed by Charles Conrad, subsidized by the Italian Government. The movie received the Lion of St. Mark's Art Film Prize at the Venice Film Festival the same year.Museum of Modern Art To Resume Flim Series. The New York Times Archives 1964, 31 December 1964Luigi Moretti Dead at 66; Designed Watergate Complex. The New York Times Archives 1973, 17 July 1973 Watergate complex, Washington In 1967–1968, he won the Antonio Feltrinelli Prize's Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei and got the task of designing a Tabgha sanctuary on Lake Tiberias on the Holy Land. The project was approved by the Holy See but the work was not started because of the delicate situation between Israel and Palestinians which soon erupted into war. In 1968 he married Maria Teresa Albani. The following year, in 1969 found a fertile market for jobs in Arab countries, especially in Kuwait (where he designed the headquarters Bedouin Engineering Club and Houses) and in Algeria (Hotel El-Aurassi and Complex Club des Pins, in addition to a number of schools and residential neighborhoods). In 1971, he designed new buildings (with Vosbeck, Vosbeck, Kendrick & Redinger), for projects of General Real Estate, including the residential center in Alexandria, Virginia on the Potomac River, a residential center in Rocquencourt by Paris, in Montreal a new skyscraper as attachment to his previous 1961 realization of the Stock Exchange Tower (Tour de la Bourse). The same year at request of the Spanish Ministry of Information and Tourism, Moretti arranged a monographic exhibition of his works in Madrid in the framework of the International exhibition of construction and public works: he presented 21 works by means of photographs, models and personally selection of materials and their fitting. He died in 1973, due to heart failure while he was in the midst of his work.

He released his debut album and film, Transcendence, on 8 July 2018. In addition to being a solo artist, he is also involved in the pop songwriting and production duo SNKM as well as various other musical projects. Biography and early life Omar was born in London, England, but grew up in Islamabad. He lost his father at the age of 10 due to alcoholism and saved his mother's life at 11. In 1998, Omar's father was falsely imprisoned which was revealed in a series of prison letters posted to Omar's social media. He had a stutter which he learnt to manage through rapping. He was in and out of multiple schools and eventually dropped out at 17 to pursue a career in music. Music career Career beginnings Omar was raised on Pink Floyd and other classic rock from birth, got introduced to hip-hop at age 5 with Tupac Shakur, was then inspired by Dr. Dre to become a hip hop artist at the age of 8 after watching \\"Keep Their Heads Ringin'\\" then started writing lyrics and rapping at the age of 9 after listening to Wu-Tang Clan's The W album. He began recording and producing music by 13. In 2008, Omar caught the attention of B-Real of Cypress Hill who invited him to visit Los Angeles, helping launch his music career. Between 2010 and 2012, Omar put together The Mushroom Cloud Effect, a street album consisting of compiled tracks and unheard demos of Omar's early rapping and non-production work with Soul Assassins affiliated producers such as Fredwreck, DJ Solo and DJ Lethal handling the music. The most notable song was \\"Paki Rambo\\". This was during press coverage on BBC, CNN, The Associated Press and many other news outlets which brought Omar considerable attention, but which he also felt was \\"heavily politicized\\", an angle which he wanted to avoid. This was also followed by a near death experience, professional mismanagement and a government imposed YouTube ban which momentarily affected the distribution and exposure of not only Omar but all independent musicians in the country. 2015–2017: Margalla King and SNKM In early 2015, Omar and longtime friend, Pakistani electronic musician Talal Qureshi, formed the super-group, songwriting and production duo SNKM which came out with Omar's directorial debut for \\"Nighat & Paras\\" and was followed by their first showcase at SXSW. In early 2016, SNKM collaborated and performed with Diplo and Elliphant for their first Pakistan show. This was followed by the duo's second appearance at SXSW and Omar's solo EP Margalla King. The EP also featured a collaboration with Bun B. SNKM joined the roster for multiple Mad Decent Block Party 2016 shows alongside Diplo, Kesha, Marshmello, Rae Sremmurd and others. The duo continued performing and touring with Diplo, Major Lazer, Skrillex, Valentino Khan and other artists throughout 2017 up until early 2018 when Omar and Qureshi returned to their solo efforts. 2017–2019: Transcendence Omar announced in late 2017 that his self- produced debut studio album Transcendence will be released in 2018. Transcendence was released as a 10-song visual album on 8 July 2018. The lead single was \\"We Need to Talk About Adil\\" and guests on the album included Elliphant, Tim Armstrong of Rancid, Shaman Durek, Talal Qureshi, SNKM and others. The album also included recreations of 1970's and 80's era Lollywood soundtracks, but rather than relying on sampling, Omar reached out to some of the original creators such as Ustad Tafu and M. Arshad and hosted live sessions in his home studio Bisonopolis, Islamabad. The instrumental version of the album was released on 8 October 2018. Shortly after the release of Transcendence, Omar announced that he was working on his second album, Mastery, for a 2020 release. 2019–present: Mastery The announcement track for Mastery was released on 7 February 2019 in which Omar channels Street Fighter villain M. Bison. A second single titled \\"Mission\\" was released with a lyric video on 28 April 2019 with cover art paying homage to Timecop and has been described as a \\"futuristic song that can’t be put in any one genre\\". On 30 November 2019, Omar headlined Pepsi's first ever hip-hop show in Pakistan for Pepsi Black to positive reviews from attendees and reporters for a \\"surprising, unconventional and animated\\" performance. On 12 January 2020 Omar released \\"The Great Unraveling\\" which featured Dave Sitek of TV on the Radio on guitars and a music video set in Jungle World, Rawalpindi to mostly positive reviews. Omar released \\"Alien\\" on 22 March 2020 which has been described as \\"(not hiding) from the inner rage that we all can experience from time to time; the alienation or standing at the precipice. Much more importantly, Adil Omar has started showcasing the man he has become and his progression as a singer-songwriter, rapper, lyricist and producer; it’s been a long journey from ‘Paki Rambo’. Some find his work a narcissism manifesto but Adil is building his own narrative, which is not always about him but the world around him and his interpretation of it\\" while \\"the adventurous production is what takes the cake.\\" On 15 May 2020 Omar announced that the release of Mastery was pushed to 2021 in favor of it being a double album, and that the only released song that will appear on the album is \\"The Great Unraveling\\", with all the others being brand new. https://twitter.com/Adil_Omar/status/1262471430551330818 Musical style and influences Omar has musical and stylistic influences stemming from a wide range of genres such as hip-hop, pop, psychedelic and industrial rock, as well as world music, electronica, dance and even classical. Differing from the shock value, braggadocio and politics of his earlier underground and teenage work, his lyrical themes and artistic evolution highlight autobiographical experiences and touch on spirituality, mental health, self confidence and awareness, empowerment, philosophy, human nature, absurdity, humor and a general stream of consciousness. Omar has cited Tupac Shakur, Dr. Dre, N.W.A, Trent Reznor, Nine Inch Nails, RZA, Wu-Tang Clan, Big Pun, Eminem, Nas, Gang Starr, Michael Jackson, Method Man, Redman, Rakim, Busta Rhymes, Björk, Pink Floyd, Monster Magnet, Marilyn Manson, David Bowie, Fiona Apple, 50 Cent, Johnny Cash, Prince, The Rolling Stones, Motörhead, Rammstein, Cypress Hill, Freddie Mercury, Snoop Dogg, LL Cool J, George Michael, Waylon Jennings, Everlast, House of Pain, Scarface, Kool G Rap, The Afghan Whigs, Chino XL and Ludacris among others as influences. Personal life Omar was born with multiple forms of synesthesia, the most powerful being sound-color, a neurological condition in which the person afflicted sees colors when tones are sounded. In a 2018 interview, he is quoted to have said \\"Everything I make and produce is based on how it looks to me. I look at my songs as audio paintings. My production is as visual as it is sonic. I can’t comprehend sound as a solely auditory experience. It’s an alien concept to me. I guess it’s cool seeing every sound I hear but it makes driving distracting. I know how to drive but I generally don’t drive because of this.\\" In 2012, Omar was nearly electrocuted to death in the shower, an incident he talks about on Transcendence which left him with years of post-traumatic stress disorder to rehabilitate from before releasing the album in 2018.https://twitter.com/Adil_Omar/status/1280878113858170880 Discography For SNKM, see the SNKM article Albums *2018: Transcendence *2021: Mastery Mixtapes/EPs *2013: The Mushroom Cloud Effect *2016: Margalla King References  External links  * Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:Musicians from Islamabad Category:Pakistani record producers Category:Pakistani rappers Category:British hip hop singers Category:English-language singers from Pakistan Category:Alternative hip hop musicians Category:Desi musicians Category:English people of Pakistani descent Category:Pakistani music video directors Category:Hip hop record producers Category:People with synesthesia ","title":"Adil Omar"},{"id":"24716759","text":"Monica Seles was the defending champion but lost in the quarterfinals to Brenda Schultz-McCarthy.

Most of the Macedonians of Poland originate from the Child Refugees of the Greek Civil War. Estimates put the number of Macedonian refugees settled in Poland at 11,458. Many Macedonians immigrated to Poland after the Breakup of Yugoslavia. History A large group of refugees of around 10,000 found their way to the Lower Silesia area in Poland after the Greek Civil War. This group included both Greeks and Macedonians. In 1970, there were an estimated 5,000 Macedonian speakers in Poland.in: Harald Haarmann, Soziologie und Politik der Sprachen Europa, Munich, Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag, wissenschaftliche Reihe 4161, 1975, 436 p. The refugees from Greece after the Greek Civil War belonged to different ethnicities, including half reportedly of Macedonian ethnicity and speaking the Macedonian language. According to Alfred F. Majewicz and Tomasz Wicherkiewicz: > Polish administration supported the Greek refugees in Poland in forcible > Hellenization of personal names of Aegean Macedonians, representatives of > whom came to Poland together with the Greeks. (...) Polish authorities in > close cooperation with the Organization of Political Refugees from Greece > imposed limitations upon the schooling for Macedonians and successfully > prevented them from creating their own organization which could be finally > founded and officially recognized as late as 1989.

Many Greeks decided to return to Greece after the 1982 Amnesty Law allowed their return, whereas a large proportion of Macedonians ended up leaving Poland, for the Socialist Republic of Macedonia. A book entitled \\"Macedonian Children in Poland\\" () was published in Skopje in 1987. Another book, \\"The Political refugees from Greece in Poland 1948 - 1975\\" () has also been published.

Controversy The Non-GMO Project has been known to put its labels on products containing inputs it considers \\"low-risk\\", including foods with inputs that could not be derived from GMOs. The Project maintains this is because many products that appear to be inherently non-GMO (such as orange juice) often contain GMO-derived additives (such as citric acid).

However, he used the plans for a previous church, in Townsend Street, which had been designed by James Leeson.Casey, p. 9 Assistance was received from Francis Johnston and James Lever. The roof was by Richard Turner. The exterior of the church has a Doric portico with a statue of St. Andrew, sculpted by John Smyth (1776-1840), son of Edward Smyth (d.1812), sculptor of the Riverine heads at the Custom House. On 7 January 1940 ornamentation fell from the ceiling, which prompted an investigation and refurbishment. This started in 1942 when the interior was renovated and painted. All sculptures were restored at the same time.Watson, p. 31 Dominic Corrigan (1802-1880), a noted physician, is buried in the crypt of the church. Organ The organ of St. Andrew's was built by John White of Dublin in 1872. It is a large three manual instrument which originally contained many ranks of orchestral Cavaille-Coll pipework. This is no surprise as John White learned his trade in France. However, during the 1976 rebuild a large number of these were lost in favor of more neo-classical stops. If it were to be restored, the organ would be one of the finest in Dublin. The organist of St. Andrew's since October 2011 is Aleksandre Nisse.

It is the largest city in Brazil with a population defined by a long history of international immigration. São Paulo City is home to more than 11 million people, accounting for about 25% of the population of São Paulo State. Portuguese remains the most widely spoken language and São Paulo is the largest city in the Portuguese speaking world.  Ethnic demographics  São Paulo demography shows a conglomeration of a large number of ethnic communities. There are European, Arab, Asian, African, Jewish, North American population in the city. The diversity in the São Paulo demography is due to high scale immigration of people from various corners of the world during the 19th and 20th century. The early settlers were people from the southern part of Portugal. The diversity in the demography of São Paulo has led to a variety in its culture, food habits and attire. Its residents are referred to as Paulistanos, while those who reside outside the city, but in the surrounding State of São Paulo, are called Paulistas. The main ethnic group in São Paulo are the Portuguese followed closely by the Italians. The Metropolitan Region of São Paulo has more people of Italian descent than Rome. São Paulo has had a huge Portuguese (original settlers) population since the 16th century, though most Portuguese arrived in the city and state in the early 20th century. The population of Afro-Brazilian descent in São Paulo grew in the last decades, due to strong migration of people from Northeastern Brazil, which has the highest concentration of Brazilians of African descent. The city has the largest Spanish, Arab (mainly Christians of Lebanese or Syrian descent) and Japanese population of the country.Ethnic Groups – São Paulo The Immigrant Memorial is a museum that preserves the history and heritage of immigrants in São Paulo. Located in Brás, a neighborhood whose history is closely associated to the arrival of Italian workers and their families in the late nineteenth century, the museum headquarters is the old Immigrants' Lodge, built between 1886 and 1888, where newly arrived immigrants could stay for up to eight days before moving on to their final destination in Brazil. The exhibits at the Immigrant Memorial help tell the story of immigration in São Paulo State and in São Paulo, capital, through photographs and objects. Every year in June, the Immigrant Memorial hosts the Immigrant Festival. More than 30 nationalities participate in the festival, which is held on the Immigrant Memorial patio.Immigrant Memorial After the first decades of the 20th century, foreigner immigration slowed down, but another phenomenon became more and more clear: that of internal migration. Attracted by the prosperity, millions of Brazilians (mostly from the Northeastern States) migrated to the city of São Paulo, lacking education and other skills, the absolute majority ended up working in lower employments, such as civil construction. São Paulo (known, during the 1980s, as the fastest growing city in the world) had many of their sky-scrapers built by the \\"nordestinos.\\" The internal migration had cultural impacts. Recent census show that São Paulo has more northeasterns than most capital cities in the Northeast.People from Northeast in São Paulo  Population growth  São Paulo's population has grown rapidly. By 1960 it had surpassed that of Rio de Janeiro, making it Brazil's most populous city. By this time, the urbanized area of São Paulo had extended beyond the boundaries of the municipality proper into neighboring municipalities, making it a metropolitan area with a population of 4.6 million. Population growth has continued since 1960, although the rate of growth has slowed. In 2007 the city's population stood at 10,886,518 and it was estimated that 18.8 million people lived in the urban agglomeration.  Religious demographics  According to data from 2000, more than half of city residents were identified as Christian; 68.11% of residents are Catholic and 15.94% are Protestant.

Mumbere was arrested in December 2016 after the clashes in the kingdom's capital of Kasese, and has since been in prison awaiting trial.  Biography  Rwenzururu was established in 1962 as the result of the secessionist Rwenzururu movement by the Bakonjo people in the mountainous region of western Uganda. The revolt was led by Mumbere's father, Isaya Mukirane, who was recognized as the region's king. Mumbere inherited the title at age 13 and assumed the position of king at age 18. When he was 30, he made an agreement with the government of Uganda by which the government sent him to the United States for an education. In 1984, at age 30, he enrolled in business school, but his government stipend was cut off. He obtained political asylum in the United States in 1987, received nurse's aide training, and began working in a nursing home in suburban Maryland near Washington, D. C. He later moved to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania where he continued as a nurse's aide. He kept his royal title secret during most of his 25 years in the United States. In July 2009, Mumbere mentioned his kingship in an interview with The Patriot- News, the primary newspaper of Harrisburg, and said that he was considering returning to Uganda, which had recently recognized Rwenzururu and designated Mumbere as \\"Omusinga\\", or king.\\"Bakonzo contestants attack govt over Mumbere's kingship\\" by Ephraim Kasozi & Joseph Miti, The Monitor, 7 April 2008 (accessed 6 June 2009) In October 2009, Mumbere returned to his homeland, where he was crowned on 19 October.

It was located on the site of present Berta A. Dreyfus Intermediate School 49 and the Stapleton Houses. The stadium was built in the early 1920s by the wealthy owner of the local Thompson's Lumber Company. It was built against a hill in Staten Island's Stapleton neighborhood and doubled in summer as a home for semi-pro baseball. Inside its stockade fence, about 8,000 uncovered bleacher seats encircled the field. The field's locker rooms consisted of sheds standing just outside the fence. Stapletons owner, Dan Blaine, owned a restaurant which was located next door to the stadium, and after games and practices players and fans would meet up for beers. While an average of 3,000 fans normally paid their way into each game, hundreds of others would usually watch the game for free from the hill behind the south end zone.

Biography Nikolay Dobrokhotov was born on March 27, 1889 in Arzamas in Nizhny Novgorod Guberniya in the Russian Empire. His father Nikolay Nikanorovich Dobrokhotov was a telegraphist. His mother — Maria Fedorovna Vladimirskaya, graduate of Smolny Institute — was from the Vladimirskie family, many of whose members were engaged in social activities (maternal uncle — Mikhail Fyodorovich Vladimirsky — one of the oldest figures of the communist party, companion in arms of Vladimir Lenin), were friends of Maxim Gorky. Nikolay Dobrokhotov was the eldest son in a family of 12 children. There was no secondary school in Arzamas at that time and Dobrokhotov was sent to Nizhny Novgorod, where in 1900 he entered the Realschule. N.N. Dobrokhotov(leftmost) with classmates in the institute. 1912 year N.N. Dobrokhotov\`s Diploma of graduation from Mining Institute In 1907 he graduated from the Realschule and successfully passed the competitive examination in the metallurgical department of the Saint Petersburg Mining Institute. Here many famous professors and lecturers taught: E.S. Fyodorov on crystallography, N.S. Kurnakov on chemistry, I.A. Time on metallurgical engineering, A.F. Ioffe on thermodynamics, A.L. Baboshin on metallography and others. During his student years Nikolay Dobrokhotov actively collaborated in the student metallurgical study group, many times underwent practical training on metallurgical plants, worked as a designer, as a Martin foreman and held some other posts. In December 1914 he graduates from the institute. In 1914–1917 years Nikolay Dobrokhotov works on Perm Ordnance Factory, where he was engaged on mastering and improving the technology of artillery steel production. On May 11, 1915 Nikolay Dobrokhotov marries Elizaveta Ivanovna Zventsova (1891-1978) - daughter of Ivan Vasilievich Zventsov, a member of Zemsky Court in Kashin. Nikolay Dobrokhotov had 6 children, two of them died at an early age. In 1920 Nikolay Dobrokhotov joined as an Assistant Lecturer the Metallurgy Department of the Saint Petersburg Mining Institute, which was headed by Prof. V.N. Lipin. Here he worked till 1924. In these years Nikolay Dobrokhotov is formed as an independent young scientist - he explores some of the issues of gas-furnace heating engineering and publish many works in this area. N.N.

Dobrokhotov on the building of Institute of Gas in Kiev In November 1924 Nikolay Dobrokhotov was appointed head of the Department of steel metallurgy and theory of furnaces of Ural Polytechnic Institute (which until then was headed by prof. V.E.Grum-Grzhimailo) and according to the decision of the State Academic Council of Narkompros of RSFSR of June 4, 1926 was approved in the academic rank of professor in the Department of steel metallurgy. The fall of 1929 Nikolay Dobrokhotov leaving on a business trip to metallurgical plants in Germany and the U.S. In 1930 in Sverdlovsk was arrested on charges of subversive activities. Then was arrested almost the entire management team of scientists and teachers of Ural Polytechnic Institute. On August 20, 1931 Sverdlovsk OGPU released Nikolay Dobrokhotov from custody by order of Moscow OGPU. To the release of Nikolay Dobrokhotov contributed Ekaterina Pavlovna Peshkova, wife of Gorky. In 1931, Nikolay Dobrokhotov moved to Moscow, started working the head of the furnace laboratory of the Central Research Institute of Machine Building and performed together with his staff research in gas- furnace heating engineering. Since January 1935 he was again working on his main speciality as a professor, head of the Department of steel metallurgy of Dnepropetrovsk Metallurgical Institute. By decision of the Higher Attestation Commission on April 11, 1938 Nikolay Dobrokhotov was approved in the degree of Doctor of Technical Sciences. By General Meeting of the Ukrainian SSR Academy of Sciences on February 22, 1939 Nikolay Dobrokhotov was elected an Academician of the Ukrainian SSR Academy of Sciences. On April 9, 1939 for his successful work in the ferrous metallurgy Nikolay Dobrokhotov was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour. In the same year Nikolay Dobrokhotov was elected to the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Council of People's Deputies. In August 1941 Nikolay Dobrokhotov evacuated to the Urals. During the German-Soviet War, he was associated with 16 plants, providing them with scientific and technical assistance in gas-furnace heating engineering and steel metallurgy, for which he was awarded a Medal for Valiant Labor in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945 and decorations as an eminent person in Tank and Metallurgical Industry. In December 1944 Nikolay Dobrokhotov moved to Kiev, worked as head of steel-smelting department of Ferrous Metallurgy Institute of the Ukrainian SSR Academy of Sciences and the head of the Department of steel metallurgy and industrial furnaces of Kiev Polytechnic Institute. On December 14, 1948 by General Meeting of the Ukrainian SSR Academy of Sciences Nikolay Dobrokhotov was elected a Chairman of the Bureau of the Department of technical sciences of the Ukrainian SSR Academy of Sciences. On initiative of Nikolay Dobrokhotov was created the Gas Institute of the Ukrainian SSR Academy of Sciences and he was appointed its director from September 1, 1949. By decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR dated February 3, 1951 Nikolay Dobrokhotov was given the rank of Honored Worker of Science and Technology of the Ukrainian SSR. By decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR dated May 3, 1954 Nikolay Dobrokhotov was awarded the Order of Lenin and by decree dated July 19, 1958 he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour. October 15, 1963 in Kiev, Nikolay Dobrokhotov died. He was buried in the Baykove cemetery of Kiev. In the name of Nikolay Dobrokhotov in Kiev was called street (Academic Dobrokhotov Street). Scientific and applied activities In 1921 was published the first scientific paper of Nikolay Dobrokhotov \\"About burning of oil shale in the gas generators\\". Nikolay Dobrokhotov created a new theory of furnaces, which was fundamentally different from the hydraulic (prevalent in the 1930s) in the substantive provisions and practical conclusions. He first showed that the movement of gases in furnaces is turbulent and not laminar in nature, and therefore the processes of mixing gas and combustion of fuel run through the laws of the turbulent and not laminar flow. Its essence is as follows: to improve heat transfer by convection and radiation, gases must move in the working space of the furnace as close to the surface of the heated subjects with the greatest possible speed; combustion of fuel at high temperatures is determined by the conditions of mixing it with oxygen. The chemical reaction of combustion occurs very quickly and does not limit the rate of fuel combustion process; length of the turbulent flame is proportional to the diameter of the fuel jet and does not increase with increasing of heat load at a constant ratio of fuel and air; geometric pressure of gases in furnaces is small in comparison with the kinetic energy of gases. Effect of geometric pressure can be neglected, considering only the forces of inertia and kinetic energy of gas flows. capacity of the furnace is necessary to determine not only by the quantity of supplied fuel in it, but the oxygen consumed by the furnace for combustion of fuel; the choice of transporting system of processed and received materials in the furnace, which determines the type of the furnace and is its main feature, is very important. This theory has opened new directions in the design of compact furnaces with forced movement of gases. In 1931-1935, he developed a new theory of metal heating and experimentally proved that the steel can be heated very quickly, ensuring high performance of furnaces with a perfect metal quality and its low waste. He also suggested a method of calculating the thermal and structural stresses arising during heating of steel products, that was the basis for the development of heating conditions, radically improved the process. Nikolay Dobrokhotov shown theoretically and in practice has proved the possibility and desirability of a sharp acceleration in the heating of steel products without deterioration, that completely changed the prevailing views on the permissible rate of their heating. Nikolay Dobrokhotov designed the heating furnaces and their equipment more than 35 years. According to his projects in 1929-1930 were built heating furnaces in rolling mills of Nizhneserginski and Nizhny Tagil metallurgical plants. Document of registration of scientific work by N.N. Dobrokhotov N. Dobrokhotov proposed to increase the capacity of open-hearth furnaces to increase their productivity and reduce fuel consumption in steel smelting and later formulated the basic theses of the theory of intensification of heat work of open-hearth furnaces. With the use of the provisions made by him in the mid 1930s were upgraded 90-ton open-hearth furnaces of Nizhnedneprovsk metallurgical plant in the name of Comintern. Increased heat output of the furnaces made it possible to dramatically raise their productivity and exceed all previously known records of high-speed steelification. Later was improved design of open-hearth furnaces of many metallurgical plants. N. Dobrokhotov proposed to equip open- hearth furnaces with fans for air supply, with smoke exhausters for removal of combustion products, with front wall without arch and improved refrigerators. During the German-Soviet War, N. Dobrokhotov offers to hold ferromanganese deoxidation of boiling steel in the ladle, that was implemented in 1942 in one of the Ural plants. This method saved a large amount of ferromanganese, since when steel is deoxidized in the furnace of about 50% of it oxidized and was lost with the slag. For that time when as a result of military actions was lost main extraction base of manganese ore, this fact was of great importance. After World War II, N. Dobrokhotov, together with his disciples developed a theory of drying and firing of ceramic products based on a fundamentally new method. He scientifically substantiated, fast drying and firing modes of production, identified ways to improve the quality of ceramics. Under his guidance and direct participation was designed and put into operation at the Kiev factory of ceramic blocks first in Ukraine a strong tunnel kiln for firing of building and ceramic products. Technology and technique of using of natural gas in open-hearth production of the Soviet Union created mainly through the works of N. Dobrokhotov. Before him, the natural gas was used in a mixture with fuel oil. In 1959, N. Dobrokhotov with students suggested to heat three-way open-hearth furnaces with natural gas instead of a mixture of coke oven and blast-furnace gas. The method was first introduced at several furnaces of Zaporizhstal and K. Liebknecht plants, and then - in many plants of the country. N. Dobrokhotov develops basic theory and practice of deoxidation and alloying of finished steel in ladle with solid ferroalloys, use of which radically improved steelmaking process. It was first tested at the Volgograd metallurgical plant \\"Red October\\", and later - at the Izhevsk metallurgical plant in the name of 50 years of the USSR, at Kuznetsk metallurgical plant in the name of Lenin and at other plants. Implementing of it made it possible to increase the productivity of smelting furnaces, reduce haze of alloy additions and deoxidants, reduce the cost of steel and improve the quality of the material. N. Dobrokhotov developed a scientific basis for steel pouring at high temperatures to improve the quality, that gave rise to a new direction in the field of steel pouring to ingots and obtaining shaped steel casts, thereby improving their quality at all indicators. Before him there was an erroneous opinion that it was necessary to pour steel as slowly as possible. He laid the scientific basis for high-speed pouring of steel and has proved, that steel can be poured in three to four times faster without compromising quality of ingots. This increased the productivity of pouring bays of open-hearth workshops and twice reduced the employment of pouring spaces and equipment. N. Dobrokhotov proposed a new technology of direct receipt of iron from ore. By his instructions on metallurgical plant \\"Zaporizhstal\\" in the name of S. Ordzhonikidze were constructed semi- industrial devices - shaft furnace and the boiling bed reactor for direct reduction of iron by products of conversion of natural gas, by which were obtained necessary basic data for designing industrial units of this type.

In 1915 he, along with three other players, formed the team to play other semi-pro teams from New York and New Jersey. He suspended his football career in 1918 to serve in the United States military during World War I. Once the war ended, Blaine took over sole ownership of the Stapletons. He stayed in the Stapleton lineup at halfback until ending his playing career in 1924 at age 33. After his retirement from football, Blaine focused solely on owning and managing the team. After a November 14, 1926 33–0 loss to the Newark Bears, Blaine promptly hired most of the Newark players, including star rookie Doug Wycoff, who were still owed money by the Bears due to the team's financial problems. As a result, the Bears went out of business, while the Stapletons benefited from Newark's folding. In 1929, the Stapletons became members of the National Football League after the New York Yankees folded. This resulted in a rivalry between the Stapletons and the New York Giants. While the Stapletons never had a winning season in the NFL, they did manage to defeat, or tie some of the teams that are still in existence today. A combination of the Great Depression and having too small of a stadium that could have never accommodated enough fans to make the team profitable caused great financial difficulties for the team. Many of the Stapletons' fans couldn't afford tickets to make a team possible. Blaine went through the formality of getting NFL permission to suspend league operations for the 1934 season. The team played one more season of semi-pro football in 1934 before quietly folding. In June 1935, Blaine's franchise was finally declared forfeit. Restaurants Blaine also owned several restaurants on Staten Island. However, it is rumored that some, if not all, of these restaurants were really speakeasies, that illegally served alcohol during the period of United States history known as Prohibition in the United States. One of Blaine's restaurants was located next to the Stapletons' home field, Thompson Stadium.

The gallery has occupied its present building at 1 Lyuben Karavelov Street since 1944. It was named the Boris Georgiev City Art Gallery in 1999, in honour of Varna-born artist Boris Georgiev Boris Georgiev (1888–1962). The edifice of the Boris Georgiev City Art Gallery was opened in September 1885 as the building of the Varna Men's High School. Designed in the Gothic Revival style, the building draws inspiration from medieval Northern European Brick Gothic. According to some researchers, Bulgarian National Revival master architect Gencho Kanev played an important part in the design of the edifice. Between 1912 and 1928, the building of the Varna Men's High School was used as a hospital, only to resume its operation as a school after 1928. A general meeting of Varna artists decided on 12 January 1944 to make the building the home of the Varna City Art Gallery. The north wing of the building was demolished in 1952 to make way for the Nakhimov Navy School, the modern Saints Cyril and Methodius School. Under architects Goranov and Kamenov in 1982–1987, the building was reorganized to better serve the purpose of a gallery. The Boris Georgiev City Art Gallery owns a significant collection of Bulgarian art from the early 20th century onwards, and most notably the largest collection of works by gallery patron Boris Georgiev. Other Bulgarian artists represented in the gallery's permanent exhibition are Vladimir Dimitrov, Ivan Milev, Sirak Skitnik , Zlatyu Boyadzhiev, Tsanko Lavrenov, Nayden Petkov,David Peretz, Svetlin Rusev, Daria Vassilaynska. Displayed on the second floor are examples of portrait art from the Dutch Golden Age. The gallery's third floor regularly accommodates concerts, plays and readings. In total, the gallery has an area of spread over eight exhibition halls.

Early life Vajna was born into a Transylvanian Calvinist family in Kézdivásárhely (today Târgu Secuiesc, Romania), then part of the Kingdom of Hungary on 4 November 1891. He participated in World War I as an officer in the 29th Feldjäger Battalion of the Austro-Hungarian Army and received many honors during his forty-three months of military service. Following the war, Vajna took service in the Hungarian Embassy at Vienna, and later worked for the Ministry of Defence. He retired from the Royal Hungarian Army as a Major in 1924. After that he was appointed director of the gunpowder factory in Balatonfűzfő. When his far- right sympathy was revealed, Vajna was dismissed from that position. Political career Arrow Cross Party government. Gábor Vajna is in the third from left of the upper row. Vajna was a confidant of Prime Minister Ferenc Szálasi, the Hungarian fascist party leader and founder of the extreme right \\"Party of National Will\\", which later became the Arrow Cross Party. Vajna was elected Member of Parliament from the regional list of Veszprém County during the 1939 parliamentary election. After the German occupation of Hungary in March 1944, he maintained a good relationship between the Hungarian authorities and the arriving Gestapo and Schutzstaffel officials. He helped to overcoming the resistance fighters and prevent sabotage activities. Following the Arrow Cross Party's coup, Vajna took office as Interior Minister in October 1944 and served until March 1945.Bölöny, József – Hubai, László: Magyarország kormányai 1848–2004 [Cabinets of Hungary 1848–2004], Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, 2004 (5th edition). p. 218. While responsible for internal affairs, Vajna took a number of actions against Hungarian Jews. In cooperation with requests from German officials such as SS officer Edmund Veesenmayer, Vajna moved quickly to deport Jews in areas under Hungarian control to the Third Reich, where they were used as slaves and many were ultimately killed. As many as 76,000 Jews were delivered into Nazi hands through the end of 1944. During his ministership, the Budapest Ghetto was established on 29 November 1944 which lasted for less than three months.Decree On the Establishment of the Budapest Ghetto at the Jewish Virtual Library. Following the fall of Budapest, Vajna attempted to escape to Western Europe but was captured by units of the United States Army along with other members of the government. He was later tried in Budapest by a so-called people's tribunal and sentenced to death for war crimes, crimes against humanity and treason. He was hanged in 1946 in Budapest on the same day as Ferenc Szálasi, Károly Beregfy and József Gera.

On 14 February 1927, on the approaches to Hull Paragon station, the incoming 08:22 from Withernsea to Hull collided head-on with the 09:05 from Hull to Scarborough. Twelve passengers were killed and 24 were seriously injured. This happened despite the tracks having the latest safety features available at the time: a system of interlocking should have made it impossible to give clear signals to trains unless the route to be used is proved to be safe. Three signalmen were present in the signalbox, the enquiry found that one of them had pulled the wrong lever; he had intended to set the points for the incoming train but instead set the points ahead of the Scarborough. Locking bars should have prevented these points from being changed as the signal ahead of the Scarborough was set to clear. Unfortunately one of the other signalmen was setting the signals behind the Scarborough train to danger, in contravention of the rules this was done whilst the train was still passing. This therefore disengaged the locking bar on the points for a few seconds before the Scarborough train reached it, allowing them to be changed by the application of the wrong lever. A combination of these two failings led to the disaster.

He was in New England as early as 1644 when he had a five-acre lot assigned to him in Providence. He had been in the printing business in London, and still operated that business in 1643 when his establishment printed Roger Williams's translation of the Narragansett language. As an experienced stationer, he offered his expertise to the printing operation in Boston in 1646, asking for no compensation other than an annual almanac. Dexter became active in colonial affairs in 1647, as the four towns of Rhode Island Colony were consolidating into a unified government. He became a commissioner from Providence during the early 1650s, after William Coddington had received a commission to remove the two island towns of Portsmouth and Newport from the unified government. Dexter became the President of the combined towns of Providence and Warwick during the final year of the split government, and the four towns were reunited with his successor. Dexter was a Baptist and, following his presidency, he renewed his association with the Baptist church in Providence, becoming the pastor of the congregation in 1669. He was considered to be very pious, seldom smiling, and in social interaction was always ready to engage his company with a sermon.  Early life  Dexter may have been born in the village of Northamptonshire, England, where his father Gregory Dexter was baptized in 1581 and continued to live with his family until his death. Young Gregory Dexter is found in London, apprenticed to Elizabeth Aldee on 3 December 1632 for a term of eight years, and admitted to freedom in the Stationer's Guild on 18 December 1639.Records of the Company of Stationers of London, Freeman’s Register, 1605-1703, on FHL microfilm 1482675, and Apprentices Register, 1605-1666, folio 123, on FHL microfilm 142671 Even before he completed his apprenticeship, he became involved in secret printing on behalf of Puritan authors, and he was questioned in 1637 for printing pamphlets written by imprisoned Puritan William Prynne.David R. Como, Radical Parliamentarians and the English Civil War (Oxford University Press, 2018), pp. 36-37. After he was made free of the Stationers, Dexter gained a reputation for printing controversial tracts often critical of the crown and church, including The Protestation Protested by Henry Burton and King James his Judgement of a King and of a Tyrant.Como, Radical Parliamentarians, 94–97, 134–137. He printed a pamphlet on \\"Prelatical Episcopacy\\" for John Milton. Dexter and his wife Abigail were both imprisoned for printing pamphlets deemed subversive by the House of Lords and the House of Commons. His presses and printing equipment were seized in a raid by the Crown's Stationer's Company on 5 February 1644 which left the Dexters without the means to continue their business in London.Como, David R. \\"Print, Censorship, and Ideological Escalation in the English Civil War.\\" Journal of British Studies, vol. 51, no. 4, 2012, pp. 820–857. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/41999120 Dexter traveled to New England later that year, where he joined Roger Williams and was given a five-acre lot at Providence Plantations, and he and 38 others signed an agreement in July 1640 to form a government there. This agreement gave authority to five selectmen to handle the business of the town, leaving difficult matters to arbitration. He possibly returned to England, as his printing establishment in London published Williams' book A Key into the Language of America in 1643, the first English translation of an American Indian language. He was in New England in 1644 with Williams in Providence, as he joined the Baptist church there. He continued to work as a printer, and he was asked in 1646 to get a printing operation running in Boston. He requested no remuneration for his services; he only asked that they send him their almanac once a year.  Rhode Island  Roger Williams had obtained a patent for the Rhode Island colony in 1644, yet the island towns of Portsmouth and Newport continued to be governed separately from Providence and Warwick. In 1647, the town of Providence elected Dexter as chairman of a committee to meet with similar committees from the three other towns to organize a united government of the four towns. The unification was accomplished, and Dexter was a member of the General Court of Trial under the new government in 1648. In 1651, William Coddington was successful in getting a commission in England making him the governor of the two island towns of Portsmouth and Newport, leaving Providence and Warwick with a separate government for three years from 1651 to 1654. During these years, Dexter was a commissioner from Providence, then the town clerk of Providence from 1653 to 1654, and also President of the two towns of Providence and Warwick from 1653 to 1654. Dexter family monument, North Burial Ground, Providence One of the first acts of his administration was to order his predecessors John Smith and Samuel Gorton to appear before the General Assembly and answer charges of misdemeanors occurring during their terms. Another act of Dexter's was to enter a remonstrance against the two island towns for their warlike stance against the Dutch, for fear that this would \\"set all New England on fire, for the event of war is various and uncertain.\\" At the conclusion of his term as president, Dexter reinvigorated his association with the Baptist church in Providence, and he became pastor of the congregation about 15 years later, upon the death of Rev. William Wickenden. In the Royal Charter of 1663, Dexter was one of several prominent citizens named in the document which brought broad freedoms to the inhabitants of the colony. Dexter was at Long Island for part of King Phillips War from 1675 to 1677. This was the greatest crisis that had yet visited the Rhode Island colony, and the General Assembly desired to have the \\"advice and concurence of the most judicial inhabitants\\". They voted, therefore, that they should have the company and counsel of 16 persons in their next sitting, one of whom was Dexter. Dexter continued his association with the Baptist Church late into his long life. He died at an advanced age in Providence, and is documented through numerous sources of being buried on his own private property there. He has a Cenotaph (tribute) to him on the Dexter Family Vault stone at North Burial Ground. Baptist historian Morgan Edwards writes, \\"Mr. Dexter was not only a well bred man, but remarkably pious. He was never observed to laugh, seldom to smile. So earnest was he in his ministry that he could hardly forbear preaching when he came into a house or met with a concourse of people out of doors. His religious sentiments were those of the Particular Baptists.\\" See also * List of colonial governors of Rhode Island * Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations  Images  File:Original Providence Rhode Island town layout of homesteads.jpg|Town layout of Providence with Dexter's name at the top File:Prov Home Lots.1.jpg|Detail showing Dexter's lot overlaid on current streets References  Bibliography     Further reading  * External links *Chronological list of Rhode Island leaders Category:1610 births Category:1700 deaths Category:17th-century Baptist ministers Category:Baptist ministers from the United States Category:Colonial governors of Rhode Island Category:Governors of Rhode Island Category:Kingdom of England emigrants to the Thirteen Colonies Category:Politicians from Providence, Rhode Island Category:People of colonial Rhode Island Category:Burials in Rhode Island ","title":"Gregory Dexter"},{"id":"24717570","text":"Lau Mei Gwan (Chinese 劉美君 Prudence Liew) is the self-titled debut album of cantopop singer Prudence Liew, released on December 23, 1986.

Informal trade relations between the colonies of Atlantic Canada, and the Captaincy General of Cuba has existed since the 18th century. However, diplomatic relations between Canada and Cuba was not formally established until 1945. Diplomatic relations between the two countries remains uninterrupted since it establishment in 1945, with Canada being one of the only two countries in the Americas to maintain relations with Cuba after the Cuban Revolution in 1959. Relations between Canada and Cuba have occasionally been a source of contention for Canada-United States relations. Both countries maintain embassies in the other's respective capital city, in addition to consulates in other cities. Canada is Cuba's largest source for tourists, with Canadians accounting for 30 per cent of tourists who visit the country. Conversely Cuba is Canada's second largest export partner in the Caribbean/Central American region. History Trade relations between Canada and Cuba dates back to the 18th century, with vessels from Atlantic Canada trading cod and beer for rum and sugar in Cuba. Diplomatic relations was formally established between the two countries in 1945. Cuba was the first country in the Caribbean selected by Canada for a diplomatic mission. Post- Cuban Revolution John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister of Canada, decided to maintain relations with Cuba in the aftermath of the Cuban Revolution. Diplomatic relations between the Canada and Cuba remained uninterrupted in the aftermath of the Cuban Revolution. Canada, in addition to Mexico, remained one of only two countries in the Americas that maintained uninterrupted relations with Cuba after the revolution. Although John Diefenbaker, the Prime Minister of Canada, was a staunch anti-communist, he reasoned that relations should be continued \\"despite the philosophical differences between [Cuba's] communist regime and the West..., and that Canada should hardly be required to tighten its trade restrictions above and beyond those of other Latin American nations.\\" On 26 April 1959, the Prime Minister of Cuba, Fidel Castro, visited Montreal to participate in a toy drive for Cuban children. In addition to inviting Castro, the event's organizers, the Junior Chamber of Commerce of Montreal, also invited several members of Canadian government to greet Castro, although those contacted refused to do so. The choice to maintain relations with the revolutionary Cuban government served as a point of contention for Canada-U.S. relations in the decades following the Cuban Revolution. During John F. Kennedy's tenure as the President of the United States, Diefenbaker used Canadian-Cuban relations to showcase that Canada was not mirroring the foreign policy of the United States. Cuban Missile Crisis Canada played a minor role in the Cuban Missile Crisis, with the Royal Canadian Navy assisting the United States, and other NATO allies in searching the North Atlantic Ocean for Soviet vessels from the 24 October to the end of the crisis. However, Diefenbaker's desire to maintain an independent foreign policy from the United States during the Cuban Missile Crisis, contributed towards his defeat 1963 Canadian federal election. Prior to making a public televised announcement regarding the Cuban quarantine on 22 October 1962, Kennedy had called Diefenbaker to inform him about the plan, and to request Canadian Forces be placed on DEFCON-3. Diefenbaker in turn was angered that his government was not consulted earlier; and questioned Kennedy for further proof, and to first send a United Nations team to confirm it. The issue led to a two-day debate in Diefenbaker's cabinet, with Minister of National Defence Douglas Harkness advocating that Canada follow the United States in raising its military readiness, given their \\"obligations\\" as members of NATO, and NORAD. Harkness's position eventually gained the support from Diefenbaker's cabinet as Soviet ships approached the American quarantine zone, and other NATO members began to voice their support for the United States. DEFCON-3 was formally authorized by Diefenbaker on 24 October. Diefenbaker's public perception in Canada suffered from the crisis, with the Canadian public viewing Diefenbaker as indecisive. The perception as an indecisive leader, and his refusal to accept nuclear-armed CIM-10 Bomarc missiles, led to his eventual defeat to Lester B. Pearson's Liberal Party of Canada in the 1963 election. Post Cuban Missile Crisis Although Diefenbaker was defeated in the 1963 election, his policy with Cuba was continued by the Liberal Party most notably under the tenure of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, who long held the opinion that Canada needed to establish a foreign policy, \\"independent of American influence\\". The Canadian government was critical of the United States embargo against Cuba during the 1960s and 1970s, objecting to American attempts to block trade to Cuba by Canadian-based American subsidiaries. In 1975, the United States passed legislation, loosening the restrictions in its embargo, formally permitting foreign subsidiaries of American-based companies to conduct trade with Cuba. In 1976, Trudeau spent three days in Cuba, and sparked a personal friendship with Castro. The visit was also the first by a Western nation to Cuba since 1960. Trudeau's trip to Canada was criticized by Diefenbaker, given Cuba's involvement in the Angolan Civil War. Remarks made by Trudeau in Cuba, notably \\"Viva Cuba! Viva Fidel Castro,\\" were also criticized by Diefenbaker, and Thomas Cossitt, a Canadian Member of Parliament. In his memoirs, Trudeau noted that Castro downplayed Cuba's involvement in Angola during his visit, and he had only realized the extent of Cuba's involvement after returning to Ottawa. Shortly after his visit to Cuba, Trudeau cut foreign aid to Cuba. In January 1977, Canadian-Cuban relations was strained after details were made public that the Cuban government used a consular mission in Montreal for the purposes of information-gathering. Five Cuban nationals were expelled from Canada, including three diplomats. Canadian law enforcement was already aware of the espionage activities within the consulate, and placed the building under surveillance as early as 1972. Although Canadian authorities monitored of the Cuban consulate, they had no intention to move against consulate officials until after details of Cuban espionage were made public; which forced authorities to proceed with their expulsion. In a statement of admission, the Cuban government stated it used the consulate for intelligence gathering, although noted its activities were directed against the United States government and the Central Intelligence Agency. In 1984, the Canadian government passed the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act, a law designed to dissuade Canadian-based American subsidiaries from taking part in the American economic embargo of Cuba. 1990s–present In 1994, a joint venture was formed between the Cuban Nickel Union and the Canadian firm Sherritt International, which operates a mining and processing plant on the island in Moa. A second enterprise, Cobalt Refinery Co. Inc., was created in Alberta for nickel refining. Canada, in addition to the European Union, objected to the passage of the Helms-Burton Act in the U.S. Congress in 1996, specifically Title III, a provision that permitted Americans whose properties were nationalized by the Cuban government, to sue individuals that are presently using it. The Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Lloyd Axworthy stated \\"Canada shares the U.S. objectives of improving human rights standards and moving to more representative government in Cuba. But we are concerned that the Helms-Burton Act takes the wrong approach. That is why we have been working with other countries to uphold the principles of international law\\". In response to the Helms-Burton Act, the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act was amended to permit Canadians sued under the Helms-Burton Act, to counter-sue in Canadian courts. The resulting amendment also found those that paid damages under the Helms-Burton Act to be liable to fines and imprisonment in Canada. In a satirical response to the Helms-Burton Act, a private member's bill known as the Godfrey-Milliken Bill was introduced in the House of Commons of Canada in response to the extraterritoriality of the Helms-Burton Act. The proposed bill would have allowed descendants of United Empire Loyalists who fled the American Revolution to be able to reclaim land and property that was confiscated by the American government in the 1700s. Although the Helms-Burton Act went into effect in 1996, enactment of Title III was postponed until April 2019. During the mid-1990s, Canada and Cuba reached an agreement that saw the Cuban government compensate Canadians whose properties were expropriated after the Cuban Revolution. Emergency economic reforms made during the Special Period in Cuba, allowed for a significant number of Canadian businesses to invest in Cuba. Increased economic activity between the two countries prompted a 41-hour official visit to Havana by Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien in November 1998. Chrétien faced some criticism in Canada for not publicly voicing his concerns over human rights in Cuba, although he privately discussed the issue with Castro, as well as demanded the release of four specific political dissidents. The visit saw no critique levied at Canada from the United States government; with U.S. President Bill Clinton having urged Chrétien at the 24th G8 summit months earlier, to raise concerns about human rights to Castro during his planned visit. Castro travelled to Montreal in 2000 to serve as one of Trudeau's pallbearers at his funeral. 21st century In 2001, the Canadian government protested American preclearance customs agents in Canadian airports who tried to catch American citizens travelling to Cuba in defiance of U.S. law. During the 2010 United Nations Security Council election, Cuban diplomats to the United Nations lobbied Latin American ambassadors to the United Nations General Assembly to vote for Canada. In 2013, the Canadian government hosted bilateral talks between the governments of Cuba and the United States. Seven negotiation sessions were held between the American and Cuban governments in Ottawa and Toronto. The following negotiations led to the normalization of relations between the American and Cuban governments. In November 2016, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, made a 30-hour official visit to Cuba. Economic relations As of May 2018, Cuba is presently Canada's second largest export market in the Caribbean/Central American region; with bilateral trade between the two countries averaging approximately C$1 billion annually. There are in total 85 Canadian companies and subsidiaries operating in Cuba, including brewer Labatt Breweries. Canadian businesses in Cuba are largely invested in mining, power, oil and gas, agri-food, and the tourism industry. Approximately 1.2 million Canadians visit Cuba annually. With Canadian tourists account for 30 per cent of all tourists who visit Cuba per year, Canada is the largest source of tourists for Cuba. Cuba is the fifth most- popular overseas destination for Canadian tourists. In addition to its bilateral trade relationship, Canada also funds international development programs to strengthen Cuba's agricultural sector, and improve food security in the country. In addition to the agricultural sector, the Canadian assistance program includes funding for technical training and certification for workers in oil and gas, petrochemical exploration, power engineering, pipefitting, and renewable energy industries. Funding was also provided for the training of auditors to solidify \\"greater transparency and accountability,\\" in Cuban government agencies and state-run enterprises. Diplomatic representation Cuban embassy in Ottawa. Canada has had an embassy in Havana since 1945. The current building was built in 1929 and used by Canada since 1961. It also provides consular assistance to Australian and Israeli nationals. The embassy is located in the upscale district of Miramar in municipal area of Playa in Havana. Canadian consulates are also found in Varadero and Holguin. due to these two locations being key destinations for Canadian tourists. Although Canada maintains diplomatic representation in Cuba, its embassy does not directly fund or facilitate any cultural or interpersonal exchange programs between the two countries. Cuba has an embassy in Ottawa and consulates in Montreal, and Toronto.

Only five were made and it was the Civilian Aircraft Company's only product, but one still flies in the UK. Design and development In 1928 Harold Boultbee left Handley Page to form the Civilian Aircraft Company. The Coupé was its only product, an aircraft of mixed metal and wood construction. It was aimed at the private market and was quite advanced for its day. The Coupé is a high-winged monoplane, the wing vee-strut braced to the lower fuselage longerons. The wings fold for transport and storage. They have almost constant chord, with slight taper outboard and a gentle reduction in chord at the trailing edge to help rearward visibility. There is glazing at the centre section for an upward view from the enclosed cabin where pilot and passenger sit in seats not quite side by side. The fuselage has a square cross-section, decreasing in depth towards the tail and is plywood-covered. Tail surfaces are nearly rectangular, though the rudder extends below the tailplane and elevators to the bottom of the fuselage, where it curves in smoothly. A split-axle undercarriage is mounted from the lower fuselage with the main legs fixed to the upper longerons; there is a tailskid. Unusually for its time, the wheels have brakes and the flying controls are pushrod-operated. The Coupé first flew in July 1929, powered by a 75 hp (56 kW) A.B.C. Hornet air-cooled flat four engine driving a two-bladed propeller. The sole aircraft with this engine became known as the Mk.I and all later Coupés, which used the 100 hp (75 kW) Armstrong Siddeley Genet Major I five- cylinder radial, as Mk.IIs. In both engine installations, cylinder heads are exposed for cooling. It took about 18 months before teething problems, chiefly vibration transmitted by the engine mounting, were cured. Operational history In all, five Coupés were probably builtthough Simpson 2001 suggests there were six and certainly five are recorded by UK Civil Aviation Authority, one of which, G-ABNT, still flies in 2010 though no others survive. The last Mk.II built went immediately to a German owner and crashed during the war but the other three Coupés were raced in the UK between 1931 and 1933, though without great success. Later one of them was sold to a Dutch owner and the prototype also went abroad. By 1934 the Civilian Aircraft Company had closed down and only two Coupés were active.

Stade Montois Football was formed in 1921 as the association football section of Stade Montois Club Omnisports, a 28 section multi-sport club which is best known for its rugby team. The club was four-times consecutive champion of the Division d'Honneur South-West between 1945 and 1948, and as a result were qualified to play the first season of the national Championnat de France Amateur, the top level of amateur football in France, in the 1948–49 season. They finished top of the west group, and participated in the four-team final playoff, eventually finishing third. The club were regular participants at this level until the division was integrated into the French football pyramid at level 3 in 1971. They were relegated from the then Division 3 in 1973. In 1978 they were granted access to the newly created fourth level of French football, where they stayed until gaining promotion in 1982. They remained at the third level until the FFF reorganised the league again in 1993, when they were placed in the fourth level Championnat de France Amateur. In 1996 the club finished top of group B of the National 2 and won promotion to the third tier once again. However another league reorganisation caused them to be returned to the fourth level, as the Championnat National restructured from two groups to one. A season later they were relegated to the fifth tier, Championnat de France Amateur 2. They won promotion as champions of their group in 2011 and have played at the fourth level since.

Achievements  Other than being a quite senior member of the Indian National Congress, Kamla Beniwal is famous as a minister of good quality, honesty, and excellent performance. She had managed all the operations of her departments with comprehensive learning and diligence. She has lucid ideas about her task and was quite energetic to muster her officials to keep high standards of operation. As Agriculture Minister of the state, she was a key functionary in the setting up of Rajasthan Agriculture University in Bikaner. As an Irrigation Minister, she completed the fabulous task of making district programmes of approximately 48,000 water harvesting plants in Rajasthan. As a result, a huge number of small, medium, and big projects are underway. This is certainly good news for farmers who suffer from drought. She had a key role in setting up the National Institute of Ayurved, at Jaipur. With her firm endeavour, she has also set up a Sanskrit University at Jaipur. Kamla Beniwal is one of the most committed and senior co-operators in India. She has served as the representative of the Rajasthan unit in National Co- operative Union of India in different ranks for nearly 20 years. As one of the limited and leading co-operators in India, Beniwal has been linked with the primary association of the All India Co-operative Union, Jorbagh, New Delhi, which is currently named as the National Co-operative Union of India (NCUI). From the very start of Co-operative Union, Beniwal was dynamically involved in the campaign to turn it into a real spokesperson establishment of the countrywide co-operative campaign. She received the Best Co-operator of India Award conferred by IFFCO in 1994 – 95. Controversies Jaipur land scam Beniwal and many former Congress Ministers and political leaders from Rajasthan were accused by opposition leaders that they were allocated expensive land at low prices in Jaipur Development Authority area. Beniwal communicated that the land was allotted to Kisan Saamrik Sahkarita Samiti for agricultural related activities.After the event Registrar of Kisan Sahkarita Samiti took strict action and set up a committee for investigation and found that Samiti presented a false report for land acquisition from government. This issue was discussed in Rajyasabha with lot of hot debates and speaker suspended the Rajyasabha for 15 minutes. Appointment of Gujarat Lokayukta The Lokayukta is a state-level body for monitoring the government, particularly for corruption. In August 2011, Beniwal appointed Justice R A Mehta as the Lokayukta. She did this under Section 3 of the Gujarat Lokayukta Act, 1986, which gives the governor the right to appoint Lokayukta without consulting the government, when there has been a long delay in making the appointment. In so doing, Beniwal bypassed the Narendra Modi government of Gujarat, which had been sitting on the matter since 2004. Justice Mehta had been recommended by the Chief Justice of the Gujarat High Court in June 2011, but the government did not act on the suggestion. In August, the father of murdered RTI activist Amit Jethwa filed a Public Interest Litigation in the High Court, which then served a show cause notice on the government for the delay in the appointment of Lokayukta. In response, the Gujarat state cabinet set up another committee of five ministers to look into the matter. The unilateral action of the governor was challenged in Gujarat High Court by government of Gujarat. On 18 January 2012, Lokyukta's appointment was upheld by court. Next day, government of Gujarat further appealed in Supreme Court by filing a special leave petition. On 2 January 2013, Supreme court too upheld the appointment while noting that the Lokayukta post lying vacant for nine years reflected a \\"very sorry state of affairs\\". The bench said \\"the process of consultation by the Governor with the then Chief Justice stood complete, and in such a situation, the appointment of Justice Mehta cannot be held illegal\\". It noted that the Governor is bound to act under the advice of the Council of Ministers, but the appointment of Justice Mehta is right as it was done in consultation with the Chief Justice of the Gujarat High Court. It also observed that the Governor \\"has misjudged her role and has insisted that under the Lokayukta Act, the Council of Ministers has no role to play in the appointment of the Lokayukta\\". Later on, on 6 July 2014, she has been transferred to Mizoram as Governor.

His repeated attempts to assert his authority in Limerick and the surrounding region and possibly over even the greater province of Munster itself earned him the most prominent role as antagonist in the first part of the early 12th century saga and political tract Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib, as an enemy of Mathgamain mac Cennétig, claimant to the title King of Munster, and his more famous younger brother and successor Brian Bóruma.Todd, Cogadh, pp. 48–103 According to the author of the Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib, Ivar succeeded in establishing himself as King of Munster for a period in the 960s,Todd, Cogadh, pp. 48–9 until routed in the Battle of Sulcoit in 968, but this claim has long been doubted by scholars. He then appears to have returned only a year or two later and established himself in the region again in some capacity. The sources The two main sources for the career of Ivar are the early 12th century Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib itself and what support it receives from the Annals of Inisfallen. Both are believed to have used as their primary source a now lost collection of annals of ultimately Chronicle of Ireland descent to which were added material of Munster concern.Ní Mhaonaigh Unfortunately, however, though the Cogad author made extensive use of these annals, as well as local sources also now lost, and also some contemporary poetry, his purpose was political and intended to glorify Brian Boru and the Dál gCais for the benefit of his descendant Muirchertach Ua Briain, so although in part annalistic it is also full of exaggerations, flowery language, and dubious passages of various origin. The major problem with the Annals of Inisfallen, on the other hand, is that they are a substantially abbreviated and otherwise edited redaction of the original and so actually preserve less ultimately reliable or contemporary coverage of Ivar in total than does the Cogad, with all its faults. The Annals of Inisfallen also suffer from a considerable lacuna or simply an empty gap containing no entries at all, for whatever reason, of two and a half critical years in Ivar's career, from mid-969 to the beginning of 972. The third most important source for this period of Munster history are the Annals of the Four Masters, but they were compiled much later and are occasionally of doubtful reliability, suffering in some cases from interpolations, misplaced entries, and so on. They also cover little of Ivar himself and serve mostly for the major sources above to be checked against in places. A few other sources briefly mentioning Ivar survive but altogether these do not contribute much if anything to our knowledge of him. The Annals of Tigernach might have been of assistance but they no longer survive for over two centuries between 766 and 974. Pedigree Ivar's patronym is not given in the Irish annals,Downham, p. 190 which as mentioned above have survived very incomplete, but he is generally accepted as a member of the prolific Norse dynasty known to historians as the Uí Ímair or House of Ivar. In the Cogad and related texts he is called Ímar ua (h)Ímair or Ímar, grandson of Ímar, but this can also be read Ímar Ua hÍmair,A correction silently made by Ní Mhaonaigh, p. 104. the capitalization producing the surname meaning \\"Descendant of Ímar\\", not unique to him and apparently used by other members of the dynasty as well. His precise relation to the previous rulers of Limerick is uncertain, the last member of the dynasty in the city state and its last known king before him being Aralt mac Sitric, who died in 940 and is generally believed to have been a third son of the great Sihtric Cáech (died 927), king of Dublin and later king of Northumbria. The problem with Ivar being a literal grandson of Ímar I (died 873) is that he would simply have been incredibly old by the time of his death in 977. A previous namesake of Ímar I, namely Ímar ua Ímair, killed in Scotland in 904, might be an alternative grandfather, in which case no correction of the form ua Ímair in the Cogad would be needed. At least two generations between the king of Limerick and the founder of the dynasty are required regardless. These assumptions made, Ivar of Limerick can be placed in the pedigree below. The following list contains only members mentioned in the Irish annals and other reliable and semi-reliable sources, and among those only the ones who can be placed in the pedigree with relative confidence. Thus it is by no means complete. After various authors.

The author goes on to describe the system of government which Ivar imposed on Munster, but doing so in a way which reflects the \\"structure of assessment and control in the territories of the Uí Briain at the time of composition of the text\\":Doherty, pp. 319–20. There does, however, survive a very similar passage, found not in any surviving version of the Cogad but in another tract entirely, preserved by Duald Mac Firbis in the 17th century. Its date is uncertain, and it may or may not come from a lost version of the Cogad. Most of the following is also mentioned in the epic, following the above passages, but there is much expanded. The following account at least gives the appearance of being a summary, but this is probably not what it is:Bugge, ed. & tr. of Mac Firbis, On the Fomorians and the Norsemen, pp. 9, 3, and see Bugge's introduction. Viking helmet, Norwegian. That Ivar or the Norse in general may have been attempting the actual takeover of some part of Munster possibly finds support in the Annals of Inisfallen: The term used here for the Norse soldiers is súaitrech \\"mercenary\\" and so the passage has been taken by Charles Doherty to refer to the practice of billetting the hired contingents of a standing army, as was common in later times.Doherty, p. 319. What is peculiar about this passage is the extent of cooperation between the Gaelic kings. Here the sworn rivals Mathgamain and Máel Muad (the son of Bran) are actually found working together, the only known occasion in their careers. They are joined by one Faelán of uncertain identity, whose mention may either refer to a king of the Déisi Muman who actually died in 966,Annals of Inisfallen 966.1; Annals of the Four Masters 964.10[966] and who the Cogad alleges Ivar actually killed,Todd, p. 73 or to an abbot of Emly later mentioned dying in 980.Annals of Inisfallen 980.5 Notably Emly was attacked by Ivar or his relations in 968 not long after the Norse loss in the Battle of Sulcoit in 967,Annals of Inisfallen 968.2 and possibly in retaliation for the Dál gCais plundering of Limerick.Downham, p. 53 The above account, however, is dated five years after Sulcoit in the Annals of Inisfallen, and is in fact the first entry following the lacuna beginning in mid 969, so we do not know what events have preceded it in the past two and a half years, assuming it is correctly placed. Ivar is first mentioned by name in the surviving annals in early-mid 969, which record that \\"Beólán Litil and his son were killed by Ímar of Luimnech.\\"AI969.3: Beolán Lítil & a macc do marbad la Ímar Luimnich. The identity of this person is not completely certain but he is assumed to be identical with the Uí Néill king of Lagore (Loch Gabor) or Southern Brega whose death, without cause given, is recorded in several other annals in the same year.AU969.3; CS969; AFM967.9[969] Clare Downham notes that this puts Ivar and the Limerick Norse active all the way out in the neighborhood of Dublin and says that Beolán was an ally of the King of Dublin, namely Olaf Cuaran.Downham, p. 54 The Cogad also records this killing but provides no motive, simply mentioning it immediately after Ivar's return to Limerick, allegedly from Britain, with a second great fleet.Todd, Cogadh, pp. 84–5 After his alleged expulsion sometime following Sulcoit the author of the Cogad states Ivar and a certain \\"Amlaíb, son of Amlaíb\\" attempted the conquest of Britain, but without success, with Amlaib being killed by the king of Britain (unnamed). Having returned to Limerick and killed Beolán (or vice versa), Ivar is said to have then \\"made many spoils and battles.\\" No other record of these survives, if this properly counts as one, and we must wait til 972 for the Annals of Inisfallen to pick up again.

Limerick would have featured hundreds for various craft. The sources have recently been reexamined by the scholar Mary Valante, who has taken an economic approach. Accepting Mac Airt's translation of súaitrech not as soldiers but officials, she interprets this as Ivar and Norse Limerick's dominance of international trade within its region, sphere of influence, or \\"periphery\\" in Ireland.Valante 1998, elaborated in greater context 2008. She notes that the poll tax described in the Cogad \\"is very similar to that listed in the Book of Rights and the Book of the Uí Maine from Dublin [sic]\\",Valante 1998, p. 254 referring to that collected for the Kings of Dublin, and furthermore finds a possible reference to Norse Limerick's royal \\"officials\\" in two versions of the Book of Rights itself.Valante: Dillon, Book of Rights (Lebor na Cert), 2122–25, especially note However, whether this tribute from Limerick's hinterland (as with Dublin's) was extracted in \\"a sort of protectionism racket, or as tolls on trade, or as something else entirely is unclear.\\"Valante 2008, p. 149 In any case the Norse economy in Munster, judging from silver finds, appears to have operated somewhat differently from that of the Dublin region.Valante 2008, pp. 109, 148 Trade with France, and from there southern Europe and the Mediterranean, can be assumed,Valante 2008, p. 134 but that with elsewhere in the Anglo-Celtic Isles and the wider Norse world may have been more limited by Limerick's location. Poul Holm has recently argued that Norse Dublin, Limerick, and Waterford, can all three be classed as genuine city-states as such an entity is defined by Mogens Herman Hansen and the Copenhagen Polis Centre.Holm, passim, and p. 261 However only Dublin and Limerick can be considered major \\"central places\\" and all the remaining Norse settlements and bases were related to one or the other of these two.Holm, p. 257 Limerick had streets in Ivar's time, as reported in the Cogad when Mathgamain and the Dál gCais storm the great fortress or dún following their victory at Sulcoit.Todd, Cogadh, pp. 78–9 Scattery Island, or Inis Cathaig, is believed to have been a part of the kingdom of Limerick.Sheehan, Hansen, Ó Corráin, pp. 112–3, citing also Grosjean (ed.) Poems on St Senán, pp. 80–1 Its Norse name has been suggested by Donnchadh Ó Corráin to be composed of the elements skattar + øy to mean \\"tribute island\\".Valante 1998, p. 255, citing Donnchadh Ó Corráin, \\"Onomastics with Variety: Problems in Irish Names\\", presented on April 17, 1998 at the seventh annual conference of the Society for Name Studies in Britain and Ireland. Compare Sheehan, Hansen, Ó Corráin, p. 113. Ivar is reported here twice in the annals, for which read below. Maccus Viking silver, the Cuerdale Hoard. Depending on whether or not Mathgamain and Máel Muad were successful in achieving anything following their resolution in 972, Ivar may or may not have found himself in a very weakened position. Curiously neither of our major primary sources has anything clear to say about the state of affairs at this time. But in 974 Ivar met with misforture, the Annals of Inisfallen reporting that \\"The son of Aralt made a circuit of Ireland with a great company, and plundered Inis Cathaig, and brought Ímar from it into captivity.\\",Annals of Inisfallen 974.2 and the Annals of the Four Masters \\"The plundering of Inis- Cathaigh by Maghnus [Maccus], son of Aralt, with the Lag-manns [lawmen] of the islands along with him; and Imhar, lord of the foreigners of Luimneach, was carried off from the island, and the violation of Seanan thereby.\\"Annals of the Four Masters 972.13[974] His captor is easily identified as Maccus mac Arailt, King of Mann and the Isles, but what are unknown are the circumstances. Ivar may have gone to Scattery because he had been driven out of Limerick proper, or it could have been for some other reason, and whether or not he and Maccus were already associated is unknown. Benjamin Hudson has offered the explanation that this event can be related to Ivar's earlier adventure in Britain as reported in the Cogad, arguing that the \\"King of Britain\\" reported slaying his comrade Amlaíb mac Amlaíb should be understood as either Maccus or his brother Gofraid mac Arailt and not some king of the Welsh, otherwise \\"it probably would have been mentioned in the insular records\\".Hudson, p. 59 (Assuming Hudson is referring only to the Welsh and English records.) Elaborating, he reads this sequence beginning with \\"a battle over the exploitation of the Welsh\\" which the sons of Aralt won, and eventually ending with Maccus following Ivar all the way around Ireland to finish it.Hudson does not mention that this would have been around six years later. The Cogad reports Ivar in Britain c. 968. However, Maccus and Gofraid are usually assumed to be sons of the Aralt mac Sitric (died 940) mentioned above, the last known king of Limerick before Ivar, thus easily explaining Maccus' interest in the kingdom. Hence dynastic ties and rivalry could have existed.Etchingham, passim Uniquely Maccus brings the \\"lawmen\\" of the Isles with him and instead of being slain Ivar is captured, presumably for some offence in the opinion of Colmán Etchingham,Etchingham, p. 172 and perhaps related to his earlier expedition to Britain as argued by Hudson for another context. A year later in 975 the Annals of Inisfallen report \\"Ímar escaped over sea, and Inis Ubdan was captured again.\\",Annals of Inisfallen 975.2 which has also been variously read as him simply being \\"released\\" somewhere in the Isles by Maccus. Alternatively, Alex Woolf suggests Ivar may have been ransomed for a sum, noting that the Norse cities \\"were rapidly becoming the repositories of silver bullion in the western world.\\"Woolf, p. 214 In any event who was doing the capturing of Inis Ubdan again, whether Ivar or Mathgamain, is uncertain. This was one of the islands of the Hiberno-Norse city-state but not the one, Inis Sibtonn, on which the capital was located. Mathgamain is earlier reported driving the Norse from it c. 971 in the not entirely reliable Annals of the Four Masters,Annals of the Four Masters 969.9[circa 971] but this still assumes the Norse has previously captured it themselves. Notably none of the above, Maccus' capture of Ivar in 974 or his return from anywhere in 975, is reported in the Cogad. The author had the Annals of Inisfallen entries available to him because they come from the same sources he used. Instigator In a debated passage, the author of the Cogad reports Ivar instigating his ally Donnubán mac Cathail (Donovan, the son of Cathal) to meet in his house (commonly said to be hosting a conference or feast) and betray Mathgamain up to Máel Muad mac Brain in 976.Todd, Cogadh, pp. 86–9 Said by the author to be after the confederates, with the addition of Ivar's son Dubcenn, had gone into revolt against Mathgamain, the Dalcassian prince was regardless in a precarious situation, and according to Alice Stopford Green this act of going into an enemy's house was \\"the formal sign of submission and renouncing supremacy\\", from where he soon might have proceeded to submit to Máel Muad,Green. p. 365 although Mathgamain alternatively may have been attempting to detach Donnubán from the alliance.O'Mahony, p. 35 But it has also been argued that this was entirely the product of Ivar's interference with Donnubán and that Máel Muad, a considerably distance away at the time, was in essence the natural and convenient beneficiary, a theory supported by the account in the Cogad.O'Mahony, pp. 34–6 The annals make no mention of Ivar's involvement, simply reporting Mathgamain's seizure in treachery by Donnubán and the killing of the live prisoner by Máel Muad,Annals of Inisfallen 972.3[976]; Annals of Tigernach 976.2 but at the same time do not exclude it. Death, sons and descendants Ruins of the Scattery Island Cathedral, the exact place of Ivar's death. Possibly in retaliation for instigating the betrayal and killing of Mathgamain the year before, Ivar and two of his sons, Amlaíb/Olaf (Cuallaid or \\"Wild Dog\\") and Dubcenn (\\"Dark Head\\"), were killed, apparently after being surprised, by Brian in 977 on Scattery Island,Annals of Inisfallen 977.2: Imar, rí Gall, & a da mc. do marbad i n-Inis Cathaig la Brian mc. Cennetich. / Ímar, king of the foreigners, and his two sons, were killed on Inis Cathaig by Brian, son of Cennétig.Annals of Tigernach 977.2: Inis Cathaigh do sarughudh do Brian mac Cendéidigh for Gallaib Luimnigh .i. Imar & Amlaim a mac & Duibcenn a mac aile. / Inis Cathaigh was profaned by Brian son of Cennétig, who attacked therein the Foreigners of Limerick, namely, Imar, and Olaf, one of his sons, and Dubchenn, his other son.Annals of the Four Masters 975.8: Inis-Cathaigh was violated by Brian, son of Ceinneidigh, against the foreigners of Luimneach, with Imhar and his two sons, namely, Amhlaeibh and Duibhchenn. Brian was fifty years of age at that time.Downham, p. 55, 260Dublin Annals of Inisfallen DCCCLXXVII: Iniscatha vastata a Briano filio Cennethi, et a Donaldo filio Regis Corcovasconiae contra Danos Limericenses, i.e. Imarum, et Amlafum, et Duffcannum, ubi occisus est filius Haroldi cum duobus filiis suis, qui latebant ibi, et 800 Dani simul cum eis. marking the end of an independent Norse Limerick, which lasted only a surprising fifty five years from the arrival of Tomrair mac Ailchi in 922. At his death in 977, the generally reliable Annals of Inisfallen actually style Ivar rí Gall or simply King of the Foreigners, a fairly rare style otherwise reserved for the Kings of Dublin, thus perhaps lending at least some weight to the claims of the author of the Cogad that this was a person of special authority in some domain. This political saga gives him another son, Aralt, elected King of the Foreigners of Munster soon after Ivar's slaying.Todd, Cogadh, pp. 49, 103 He is said to have perished, slain by Brian's army, along with Donnubán in the Battle of Cathair Cuan, probably somewhere in Uí Fidgenti. A son of Dubcenn, namely Osli (Auisle < Ásl/Auðgísl), is named later in the saga actually as a \\"high steward\\" of Brian, who possibly placed him in control of Mide, when killed by Flaithbertach Ua Néill c. 1012.Todd, Cogadh, pp. 147, 275, intro. clxv Another son of Dubcenn may have been Amond, possibly killed fighting on Brian's side in the Battle of Clontarf in 1014.Todd, Cogadh, pp. 207, 275 Ivar is claimed to be survived, through a daughter, by the modern O'Donovan family.O'Hart, p. 197 This daughter, whose name may or may not survive,The O'Donovan pedigree printed by O'Hart in the 19th century is a synthetic one based in part on much older materials, historical as well as genealogical. Some of O'Hart's sources, including detailed O'Donovan pedigrees in MS, can still be found in the National Library of Ireland, and so it is possible that the name of this daughter is somewhere preserved. is said to have married his ally Donnubán, their eponymous ancestor, although alternatively she may actually have been the daughter of Ivar's son Olaf, a possibility allowed by the pedigrees. But in any case a daughter of this princess and Donnubán is believed to have married Ivar of Waterford and had by him several children.

Biography  Born in Lier, Belgium, Louis was the son of Joannes Berckmans and Carolina van Ravels. He came of a family of great proprietors who had estates in Belgium. In 1829, his first wife Marie Gaudens died when their son Prosper was born, and he subsequently married Marie Rubens in 1834. After the Belgian Revolution was fought over the Berckman's family land, there were serious feuds between the family and strong political factions in the country. In 1851, Louis Berckmans came to the United States with his family and settled in Plainfield, New Jersey. In Plainfield he started a nursery with his son Prosper Berckmans where they grew over a thousand varieties of pears and experimented with a variety of other fruit trees. In 1857, they moved to Augusta, Georgia, and purchased of land, where they established Fruitland Nurseries, one of the first large, successful commercial nurseries in the South. Fruitland Nurseries also operated as an experimental station and botanical garden, growing numerous varieties of fruit trees and ornamentals and disseminating them throughout the United States. They imported many trees and plants from countries all over the world. Today the Augusta National Golf Club, home of the Masters Tournament, occupies the former property of Fruitland Nurseries. In 1931, when golf champion Bobby Jones and his business partners created the club and golf course, two sons of Prosper Berckmans, Prosper J. A. Berckmans Jr. and Louis A. Berckmans, assisted in the landscape design of the course. In addition, the Berckmans' home, Fruitland Manor, became the Augusta National Clubhouse. Many of the plant varieties developed and improved by the Berckmans family still grow at Augusta National as part of its designed landscape.
