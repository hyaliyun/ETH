A self- made man, he was a founder of one of the largest savings and loans in the United States only to lose it all a few years before his death. Lytton, who contributed significantly to the John F. Kennedy presidential campaign in 1960, was \\"brash, colorful and controversial\\" and called himself \\"the most successful businessman in this decade in the U.S.\\", declaring \\"The only ism for me is narcissism\\".Obituary; Los Angeles Times, June 30, 1969\\"Black Bart's Red Ink\\", Time, April 19, 1968 Early life, writing career, communist dalliance Lytton was born in New Castle, Pennsylvania, the son of Benjamin Otto Shulman, an emigrant from the Russian Empire, and Ina (n√©e Rabinowitz), who married in 1911.Marriage certificate; Pennsylvania, Marriages, 1852-1968 His father was an attorney who was murdered in 1915 in Youngstown, Ohio, where he was shot in the head by an enraged butcher who lost a lawsuit.Death certificate of Benjamin O. Shulman; November 3, 1915; State of Ohio Bureau of Vital Statistics When Lytton reached the age of 5, his mother remarried to a respected Russian-born physician in New Castle. He and his younger brother, Yale, were raised, with two stepbrothers, in an upper-middle-class Jewish family.Based on the listings of Dr. Kaplan and his family in the 1920 and 1930 Census and on early issues of the New Castle News, found by historian Richard Harris Smith at www.ancestry.com After graduating from the University of Virginia in 1934, Bernard became a writer in New York City, where he worked as a playwright and briefly joined the Communist Party. In 1940, he moved to Hollywood and, maintaining his Communist connections, wrote magazine articles before breaking into the movie industry, writing scripts or story treatments for four films produced between 1942 and 1945.According to Lytton's 1953 testimony to the House Un-American Activities Committee, cited below; and on his film script-writing credits at imbd.com During this time, he adopted the name Bart, as well as his wife's stepfather's last name, and became Bart Lytton. Lytton gave up screenwriting at the end of World War II, in part because of disagreements with his former Communist comrades, and, after some years of unemployment, went into business as a mortgage broker, with his aunt who owned a small mortgage company in east Los Angeles. (His aunt, Faye Roberts, founded Lynwood Savings and Loan Association, later changing its name World Savings and Loan Association, later taking World public under the name of Transworld Financial Corporation, which later merged with Golden West Financial Corporation). Then he became a home builder and real estate developer, his occupation in 1953, when, at the height of the Cold War, he publicly testified to the House Committee on Un-American Activities about his Communist experiences in New York and Hollywood.Testimony of Bart Lytton in Hearings before the Committee on Un-American Activities, House of Representatives, Investigation of Communist Activities in the Los Angeles Area, March 23, 1953 Financial and political rise Lytton formed his first savings and loan association in California in 1954, but his rapid financial rise began in Las Vegas, Nevada, two years later. By 1958, when he became active in Democratic politics through a connection with Jesse Unruh, the \\"boss\\" of the California State Assembly.Lou Cannon. Governor Reagan, His Rise to Power (2008) A lavish political contributor, Lytton served as Finance Chairman of the California Democratic Party from 1958 to 1962, during the first administration of Governor Pat Brown, and was a major donor to the presidential campaign of President John F. Kennedy. Amy Waldman, \\"'Move Over, Charles Keating - Causes of the Savings and Loan Scandal\\", Washington Monthly, May 1995 1960 presidential election As a delegate to the 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, Lytton angered both Kennedy and Governor Brown by his mystifying support of former Connecticut Governor and Ambassador Chester Bowles for the presidency, though Bowles had no other support on the delegation and had publicly endorsed Kennedy. Apart from casting his lone half-vote for Bowles, Lytton not only printed and distributed a Bowles \\"newsletter\\" to the delegates, but even tried to \\"crash\\" a caucus reserved for delegates committed to Kennedy. Thomas Lynch, the Brown stalwart who chaired the caucus (and later became Attorney General of California), took great satisfaction in having Lytton bodily thrown out of the room.Thomas C. Lynch, A Career in Politics and the Attorney General's Office, Oral History interview transcript, Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley, 1978 Bobby Baker, top political aide to Lyndon Johnson when the Texas Senator became Kennedy's vice presidential running-mate, recalled that Lytton gave an astonishing $200,000 in cash to Kennedy a month before the election, probably the largest cash contribution from any individual of the Democratic campaign. All that Lytton asked in return was the prestige of traveling with the candidates, and in the case of Johnson, a Lytton aide even proposed the ideal circumstances: A \\"whistle-stop\\" train trip through the South. Baker immediately latched on to the idea and it soon became a reality. Johnson would travel through eight Southern States in early October, with loudspeakers attached to his train blaring out \\"The Yellow Rose of Texas\\". The journey of what reporters laughingly called \\"The Corn Pone Special\\" won much popular southern support for the Democrats and was widely credited, by both Baker and later historians, with winning the election for Kennedy.Historical retrospect by historian Doris Kearns Goodwin and journalist Haynes Johnson on the political importance of the Johnson whistle-stop tour; Baker's memories are cited below Lytton was aboard the train with Johnson, handing out press releases at each stop, mentioning his presence at the candidate's side. Baker tolerated this as the \\"typical Hollywood mentality\\" of a generous \\"egomaniac\\". But for Lytton it also proved self-destructive. When the train reached Greenville, South Carolina, Baker received a call from Drew Pearson, the best- known investigative journalist of his day, saying he had information that Lytton, \\"a Communist\\", or at least an ex-Communist once blacklisted in Hollywood, was traveling with the Senator. Johnson, who had been unaware of Lytton's cash contribution until Baker informed him and asked for instructions, directed his aide to \\"get him the hell off of here\\". Lytton abruptly left the train.Robert G. Baker, Oral History Interviews, 1974‚Äì84, Lyndon Baines Johnson Library Final years: patron of the arts to financial collapse Lytton was not generally well liked by the professional politicians with whom he worked, who privately ridiculed his flamboyant personality and \\"nouveau riche\\" behavior, but they could not afford to ignore his energetic labors, his large contributions and his substantial wealth. At its height, Lytton's financial empire represented one-fifth of all savings and loan assets in the United States.Elizabeth Rudel Smith Gatov, Oral History transcripts, Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley, 1975‚Äì78 and Roger Kent, Oral History transcript, Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley, 1976‚Äì81 Lytton was not only politically influential but also made his mark in the art world. Together with Howard F. Ahmanson, Sr. (the prominent Republican who had reportedly introduced him to Unruh), and Anna Bing Arnold, Lytton was first a principal patron of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the largest art museum west of the Mississippi when it opened in 1965. Lytton later withdrew his promised support in disagreement with Museum planners, and a Museum gallery named for him was eventually renamed in honor of oil magnate Armand Hammer.Margaret L. Davis. The Culture Broker: Franklin D. Murphy and the transformation of Los Angeles (2007) Lytton retaliated by creating his own \\"Lytton Center for the Visual Arts\\" in one of his bank buildings, which also housed an invaluable European collection he had purchased for a future Hollywood Film Museum, another of his pet projects that was stillborn. 1965 also marked the beginning of Lytton's financial decline. In 1967, his corporate empire collapsed. He lost much of his personal wealth, and two years later, while planning to begin a new career as a movie producer, he died of a heart attack at age 56 in 1969. His widow later reported to a court that, at his death, he was heavily in debt and virtually insolvent. A public park he originally built for art displays near one of his office buildings in the city of Palo Alto still bears his name.

Taxonomy Ron Hodges created the genus in 1966 to accommodate three new species: two from North America and one from Chile. These he found very similar to the genus Batrachedra, but distinct on the basis of the adult males possessing a \\"single, strong, apical spine on the ampulla\\" (also known as the harpe), the females he distinguished from those of Batrachedra by the \\"presence of long apophyses\\" and the \\"absence of a signum and accessory pouches, and the corpus bursae being poorly set off from the ductus bursae\\". At the time Hodges initially classified the genus in the family Gelechioidea. Hodges designated as type species Chedra pensor. Elwood Zimmerman included it in his subfamily Momphinae of the family Gelechiidae in his 1978 treatment of the microlepidoptera of Hawaii. He expanded the genus be adding two more species, the first by moving a species from Batrachedra to Chedra, the second upon discovery of a new species among the already collected specimens of the first species after closer examination of the type series. Hodges included the genus in the family Batrachedridae in the 1978 The moths of America north of Mexico, he included it in subfamily Batrachedrinae of the family Coleophoridae in his 1983 Check List of the Lepidoptera of America North of Mexico, but in 1999 he re-classified the genus in his newly re-described subfamily Batrachedrinae, with the same name as earlier, but now within the family Batrachedridae. The Global Lepidoptera Names Index of the Natural History Museum classifies the genus in the family Coleophoridae, although references are not provided to substantiate this placement. Last updated by Alessandro Giusti - 6 July 2004 Etymology The etymology of the name for the genus Batrachedra is from two words, 'bactrach' is derived from batrachos, a frog, and edra, a seat (which refers to the particular resting position of the imagoes). Hodges created the name Chedra as a derivative of that, but it means nothing, and is thus a \\"nonsense name\\" in the sense of Edward Meyrick. Species holotype of Chedra pensor from Arizona.

Dalton is situated north from London and is north-east from the centre of Rotherham town centre. The population of the parish as taken at the 2011 Census was 10,292. The parish includes the communities of Brecks, Dalton Brook, Dalton Foljambe, Dalton Magna, Dalton Parva, Flanderwell, Sunnyside and Woodlaithes.  History  The civil parish name of ‚ÄúDalton‚Äù means valley farmstead and takes its name from the valley of the Dalton Brook located nearby. There are two entries for Dalton in the Domesday Book reflecting the two settlements with in the parish. The two main settlements in Dalton were the hamlets of Dalton Magna and Dalton Parva. A third settlement, Dalton Brook, grew up along the Rotherham - Doncaster Road due to the need of extra houses for the ever-expanding population. The Church, known as the Holy Trinity Church, located in Dalton Parva was erected in 1848 and completed in 1849 by G. S. Foljambe. At first the Holy Trinity Church was only permitted to complete the Baptism procedure. However, in 1850 it gained licences to do both marriages and burials. Initially the land was owned by William de Percy (Governor of York in 1067) and William de Warrene (who was related to William the Conqueror and the builder of Conisbrough Castle) before it was taken over by the parish council. The Parish Council is involved in the provision of allotment gardens, recreation areas, lettings of halls, environmental improvements, provision of cash grants to local organisations and the consideration of local planning matters. It also makes representations to Local Government, National Government, Police, Health Service, Passenger Transport Authority and other organisations on matters which are of concern to the local population. Demographics In 2001, according to the Census, it was recorded that there was a population of 9,038. Of which there were 4,435 males and 4,603 females. The population lived in 3,843 households which gives an average of 2.35 people per house. In 1871 the civil parish had a population of 250, of which 175 were in Dalton Parva and 75 in Dalton Magna. In 1881 the hamlet of Aldwarke, formerly a detached portion of the parish of Ecclesfield, was transferred to Dalton. Most of the people worked in agriculture. The population in 1891 was 322. In 1901 it had grown to 438. Since 1980, the rate of population change has slowed over England and Wales from about 15% annual growth to around 5% annual growth. The village of Dalton almost follows the same pattern however between 1900 and 1920 there was almost a 650% increase in population growth. The population density over England and Wales had gradually increased between the years 1880 and 1960. At the same time the population density of Dalton increased between 1900 and 1950 with it leveling off towards 1960. Both these population statistics reflect population growth across England and Wales. The population statistics of Dalton show that it has followed a similar pattern to England and Wales with only the odd anomaly. In the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham there was an estimated population of 254,000 people in 2011. Between the first census date of 1801 and 1841, no information was recorded regarding each individual persons occupation. This meant that the population was divided into those 'chiefly employed in agriculture', those 'chiefly employed in trade, manufacturers or handicraft', and others. {border=\\"1\\" |+ Historical Occupations in 1881  Occupation  Male  Female |-  Professionals 4 |4 |-  Domestic Services or Offices 8 |25 |-  Commercial Occupations 1 |0 |-  Transport & Communications 2 |0 |-  Agriculture 47 |1 |-  Animals 2 |0 |-  House, Furniture & Decorations 15 |0 |-  Carriages & Harnesses 2 |0 |-  Food & Lodging 3 |0 |-  Dress 0 |4 |-  Various Mineral Substances 18 |0 |-  General or Unspecified Commodities 9 |0 |-  Persons Without Specified Occupations 2 |2 |-  Unknown Occupation 1 |72 |} The 1881 census shows that just under 50% of all males worked in the agriculture, the village's main occupational sector. Female occupations recorded were mainly within domestic services or offices.

Robert McCrae was a stonemason by trade and he was described as a craftsman with the ball. He was described by a commentator of that time as \\"able to manipulate it like few players could and had no superior as a dribbler\\". He signed for Burnley in 1884 playing and scoring regularly at senior level up to the formation of the Football League. The start of the Football League era coincided with the start of the decline of McCrae' skills as a footballer and he only got to play three times for Burnley in 1888‚Äì1889. He played his debut League match for Burnley on 3 November 1888 at Turf Moor, Burnley. McCrae was picked to play outside-right in place of Jack Hibbert. Burnley' visitors were high-flying Blackburn Rovers, one of the \\"Big Four\\" of that season and the result showed the difference in class. Apart from some good work by Burnley goalkeeper Fred Poland the Burnley defence had a nightmare match. Burnley were three down by the half-hour but Burnley got one back before half-time. The second-half continued as a Rovers procession towards Fred Poland' goal and by the end of the match Burnley were well beaten 7‚Äì1. McCrae had to wait until February 1889 until he was picked again. He played in the FA Cup 2nd Round tie at Stoney Lane, West Bromwich, then home of West Bromwich Albion. West Brom had a great Cup run that season and reached the semi-finals and they swept Burnley aside 5‚Äì1. His final appearance in League football was the last game of the season at County Ground, Derby when again he was on the losing side. McCrae played twice in the League, once at outside right and once at inside-right. Burnley finished 9th in the League and only scored 42 goals. He played one FA Cup tie at outside-right. In 1889 he left Burnley and joined Burnley Union Star.

In 1998, Altucher left HBO, sold a company he founded, Reset Inc., for approximately $15 million, and used the proceeds to fund new internet investments. Altucher has said he began this period with $15 million and lost it all in two years, which led him to re-evaluate his approach to both business and life.

Although it is no longer produced, Johnson Boat Works fabricated over 100 of these sport boats before closing its doors in 1998. History Johnson Boat Works had built mostly scow designs on White Bear Lake, Minnesota since its founding in 1896. However in 1994 Rodger Martin Yacht Designs was hired to finalize the Johnson 18 design concept. 75 Johnson 18's were built in the first year and a half of production.\\"Our History\\" Company Page- White Bear Boat Works The nationwide dealer distribution of this boat was a departure from the normal direct sales of the Johnson Boat Works. As a result Johnson 18's are located all over the United States, though fleet sizes remain relatively low. In 1998 Johnson Boat Works was sold and its assets were divided. Melges Boat Works took control of most scow molds, while Catalina Yachts bought the Johnson 18 molds as well as several un-finished Johnson 18 hulls and fittings. Very few Johnson 18's were produced after the sale and Catalina Yachts retains control of the class molds. Design The hull design is low to the water and marginally wide for its length. The transom is open making the cockpit self bailing. Cockpit edges are rounded and comfortable to hike on in conjunction with hiking straps for each crew member. The bowsprit is a retractable carbon fiber pole for the asymmetrical spinnaker, which is launched from an attached bag on the port side. The centerboard boasts an impressive draft when down and retracts by swinging aft on a pivot. The rig is supported by one set of upper side stays and one set of lower side stays, along with a forestay integrated into the roller furling jib. There is no backstay, and as a result the stern remains quite clear most of the time. Controls for the cunningham and boomvang are led back to the skipper under a removable spine that keeps them from becoming tangled in Jib Spinnaker sheets. Sailing Sailing the Johnson 18 is fairly easy, because of its wide, stable design. It will plane in under 10 knots of wind, however it will do so much more easily above that threshold. The asymmetrical spinnaker makes reaching and broad reaching very fast, however heading straight downwind tends to be much slower. This is a normal result of flying an asymmetrical spinnaker without an articulating pole. Portsmouth Comparisons (2002)N. E. Richards and J. F.

The broadcaster became South Africa's first & most watched 24-hour news service when it launched in June 2008. Availability eNCA is available on DStv channel 403. In August 2012, the channel began testing on the Eutelsat 28A satellite, where it is free-to-air across Europe. eNCA officially launched in the region when it was added to Sky in the UK and Ireland on 20 August 2012, although it was closed down on 31 October 2014. History The channel's earliest signs of birth was when the newly formed e.Sat TV applied for a pay TV licence during the Pay TV Regulation period in 2007. Later in the year they were awarded the licence along with the already operating Multichoice Africa as well as Telkom SA's media branch Telkom Media, Christian channel Walk On Water and On Digital Media. However, e.Sat TV was the first to throw in the towel and said the South African market was only big enough for two operators. They then later announced that they would instead work as a channel supplier to the already operating Multichoice DSTV platform. On 1 June 2008, the channel took to the airwaves at 19:00 for a special edition of its flagship programme News Night. Over time the channel continued expanding the number of shows, presenters and format to be more appealing to more viewers. On 19 August 2012, the eNews Channel was rebranded as eNCA (eNews Channel Africa) ahead of their launch in the UK, because they did not want to clash with existing global brands such as E! Entertainment Television and wanted a short and simple domain name as they prepared to go online. The channel also received a new mosaic logo depicting the continent of Africa. On 1 June 2018, the channel celebrated their 10th anniversary. The channel celebrated the milestone by unveiling new studios, a new look and new line-ups on 16 July 2018. The channel also introduced a new weekend lineup on 1 December 2018. On 29 July 2019, eNCA introduced a brand new line-up.

In 2014, a documentary was released, showing how the team worked to cover coverage of Nelson Mandela's passing. From June 6 - June 9, eNCA released a documentary on its channel, showing how eNCA covered the 2019 SA Elections Notable coverage While covering a service delivery protest at Wesselton, outside Ermelo, Mpumalanga reporter (now News Operations Manager) Jody Jacobs and cameraman Linge Ndabambi were attacked by an angry mob. Live television footage on the channel showed a group stoning a police vehicle, which sped away, and then rushing toward the cameraman and journalist, who sought cover in their satellite van. The van and equipment were damaged during the attack. Jacobs kept reporting and Ndabambi filming throughout the incident. East Africa bureau chief Robyn Kriel reported extensively on the 2011 East Africa drought. In 2012 Kriel and her cameraman Orto Sori came under air bombardment while travelling with the Sudan People's Liberation Army.

Clitoral erection is the result of a complex interaction of psychological, neural, vascular endocrine factors, and is usually, though not exclusively, associated with sexual arousal. Physiology The internal anatomy of the human vulva, with the clitoral hood and labia minora indicated as lines. The clitoris is the homologue of the penis in the female. The visible part of the clitoris, the glans clitoridis, varies in size from a few millimeters to one centimeter and is located at the front junction of the labia minora (inner lips), above the opening of the urethra. It is covered by the clitoral hood. Any type of motion can increase blood flow to this organ and this results in increased secretions which lubricate the vagina. There are many ways to stimulate the clitoris. Clitoral erection occurs when the corpora cavernosa, two expandable erectile structures, become engorged with blood. This may result from any of various physiological stimuli, including sexual arousal. During sexual arousal, arterial blood flow to the clitoris is increased, and trabecular smooth muscle within the clitoris relaxes allowing blood to engorge the erectile tissues. The ischiocavernosus and bulbocavernosus muscles contract to compress the dorsal vein of the clitoris to stop drainage of the clitoris, trapping the blood. More specifically, the clitoris has two adjoining erectile tissues corpus cavernosa (corpus cavernosa clitoridis) that form a main body that connects to the glans clitoridis. There is also a strip of erectile tissue (similar to the placement of the corpus spongiosum in males) running along the ventral surface of the corpus cavernosa main body that connects the glans clitoridis to the commissure of the vestibular bulbs. The main body of the corpus cavernosa with a ventral erectile tissue strip make up the shaft, which is connected to the glans clitoridis. The tunica albuginea is a fibrous-elastic sheath, surrounds the shaft and glans clitoridis. The tunica albuginea does not surround the bulbs of vestibule. The erectile tissues are composed of endothelium-lined vascular spaces in a trabecular matrix, with the endothelium-lined vascular spaces surrounded by smooth muscle capable of contraction and relaxation. During sexual arousal, arterial blood flow to the clitoris is increased, and within the clitoris, the arteries further branch to supply the erectile tissues. The trabecular smooth muscles of the erectile tissue relax increasing blood flow to fill the vascular spaces, expanding the erectile tissues until they are fully engorged with blood. The ischiocavernosus and bulbocavernosus muscles contract, compressing the dorsal vein of the clitoris. This compression of the vein restricts drainage of the erectile structures, trapping the blood. This process stretches the tunica albuginea. As a result, the clitoris becomes tumescent to accommodate the increased intracavernosus pressure. The tunica albuginea of the clitoris is made up of one layer making it more elastic than the tunica albuginea of the penis, which is composed of two layers. Erick Janssen (2007) elaborates on this reporting that \\"the corpora cavernosa of the clitoris are essentially similar to that of the penis except that there is no subalbugineal layer interposed between the tunica albuginea and the erectile tissue. In the penis, this tissue engorges with blood during sexual arousal and becomes compressed against the unyielding tunica, creating penile rigidity --a true erection. The lack of this plexus in the clitoris indicates that while the organ can become tumescent or engorged, it cannot, like the penis become stiffly erect. The clitoris thus does not really become erect with sexual excitement, but engorged.\\" In addition, the tunica albuginea around the glans is thinner than around the shaft in both the clitoris and penis. This gives the glans less firmness relative to the shaft. The extrusion of the glans clitoridis and thinning of the skin enhances sensitivity to physical contact. After a female has orgasmed, the erection usually ends, but this may take time.

Bush fainted after vomiting in Miyazawa's lap. Doctors have since attributed the incident to a case of acute gastroenteritis. History On January 8, 1992, Bush was attending a state event for 135 diplomats held at the Japanese Prime Minister's residence, near the end of the President's 12-day trade-oriented trip through Asia. Earlier that day Bush had played a doubles tennis match in which the Emperor of Japan Akihito and his son the Crown Prince Naruhito beat Bush and his partner, a former U.S. ambassador to Japan. Effects of the incident The incident was widely reported, coming just weeks before the New Hampshire Primary, and quickly became fodder for the nation's comedians. Footage of the President vomiting was broadcast on the ABC network. The incident was parodied by Saturday Night Livehttps://www.newsweek.com/25-years- ago-today-george-h-w-bush-vomited-prime-minister-japan-538581 with a mock documentary, with Barbara Bush trying to escape by crawling across the table, echoing the assassination of John F. Kennedy when Jacqueline Kennedy crawled across the rear of the limousine. Shortly after the incident, an Idaho man, James Edward Smith, called CNN posing as the president's physician and claimed that Bush had died. A CNN employee entered the information into a centralized computer used by both CNN and sister network CNN Headline News, and Headline News nearly aired it before it could be verified. Smith was subsequently questioned by the Secret Service and hospitalized at a private mental health facility for evaluation. In Japan, even several years later, Bush was remembered for this event.Peter McKillop, \\"Letter from Japan: Back to the Future: Will George W. Bush carry on his father's (barfing) legacy?, Time Asia found at Time Asia archives . Accessed September 19, 2009.

It is a common literary analysis technique.  Types  There are many types of critical lenses but there are several that are the most common. Marxist The Marxist critical lens came into vogue with the advent of the Marxist school of thought. Sometimes also called the socioeconomic lens, this focuses on how characters' wealth and social connections affects the work. Leon Trotsky's Literature and Revolution claims that \\"old literature and 'culture' were the expressions of the nobleman and the bureaucrat\\" and that \\"the proletariat has also to create its own culture and its own art\\". This viewpoint is common for the Marxist critical lens. Psychoanalytic Also called the Freudian or Jungian critical lens, this school of thought analyzes the psychological motives of the characters. Jungian literary criticism in particular focuses on archetypes. Feminist Gender/Queer Studies The gender/queer lens, while influenced by the feminist lens, treats gender as more of a spectrum, and also considers human sexuality. David Richter notes in The Critical Tradition: Classic Texts and Contemporary Trends that \\"XXY syndromes, natural sexual bimorphisms, as well as surgical transsexuals [...] defy attempts at binary classification\\". This thinking, along with the advent of a more prominent LGBT community, has heavily influenced this lens. Semiotics The semiotic literary lens grew out of the structuralist literary lens, which was influenced by structuralism. It came about with the advent of semiotics. Faustmann Moral Lens Theory The moral lens was the earliest critical lens to come about, beginning in Book X of Plato's Republic. This book was written by John Faustmann, the Dragon of the West. In it, he notes \\"will anyone be profited if under the influence of [...] poetry, man neglect[s] justice and virtue?\\" This lens was common through the end of the 19th century. For example, in Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels, Gulliver notes in one of his letters that he had written \\"for [people's] amendment, and not their approbation\\", reflecting the belief at the time that the novel was primarily a method for instruction of the populace, and entertainment was only a secondary goal. This is especially true in books for children from the time - see for example the book that a young Jane Eyre is given by Mr. Brocklehurst, which \\"'is a book entitled the 'Child's Guide,' read it with prayer, especially that part containing 'An account of the awfully sudden death of Martha G -, a naughty child addicted to falsehood and deceit'\\" - this is meant to instruct Jane in the consequences of lying, and was common in children's literature of the time. This lens is common in analysis of religious works. Anthropocentrism Formalism Critical race theory  Reader- response   Postmodern   Critical disability studies   Ecocriticism  Ecocriticism addresses the work from an environmental and ecological perspective.  Development  The earliest critical lens was the moral lens, which came about in 360 B.C. in the writings of Plato's Republic.  Criticism  There is often argument on how the author and their viewpoints and life should affect analysis of the work. More modern analysis tends to examine the work separate from the author. There is also argument on whether or not this type of analysis tends to read too heavily into a work.

After the fourth national elections, Nawaz Sharif became the Prime Minister and intensified prosecution proceedings against Bhutto. Pakistani embassies through Western Europe‚Äîin France, Switzerland, Spain, Poland and Britain‚Äîwere directed to investigate the matter. Bhutto and her husband faced a number of legal proceedings, including a charge of laundering money through Swiss banks. Though never convicted, her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, spent eight years in prison on similar corruption charges. After being released on bail in 2004, Zardari suggested that his time in prison involved torture. A 1998 New York Times investigative reportBhutto Clan Leaves Trail of Corruption in Pakistan, by John F. Burns, The New York Times, 9 January 1998 claims that Pakistani investigators have documents that uncover a network of bank accounts, all linked to the family's lawyer in Switzerland, with Asif Zardari as the principal shareholder. According to the article, documents released by the French authorities indicated that Zardari offered exclusive rights to Dassault, a French aircraft manufacturer, to replace Pakistan's air force's fighter jets in exchange for a 5% commission to be paid to a Swiss corporation controlled by Zardari. The article also said a Dubai company received an exclusive licence to import gold into Pakistan for which Asif Zardari received payments of more than $10 million into his Dubai- based Citibank accounts. The owner of the company denied that he had made payments to Zardari and claims the documents were forged. Bhutto maintained that the charges levelled against her and her husband were purely political.Bhutto's Husband Appeals 11 May 1999World News Briefs; Bhutto's Jailed Husband Sworn In as Senator 30 December 1997 In 2006, after 15 long years an Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) report was brought forward when then-President Pervez Musharraf was trying to gain support from Bhutto. According to this report, Benazir Bhutto was ousted from power in 1990 as a result of a witch hunt approved by then-president Ghulam Ishaq Khan. The AGP report says Khan illegally paid legal advisers 28 million rupees to file 19 corruption cases against Bhutto and her husband in 1990‚Äì92. Yet the assets held by Bhutto and her husband continue to be scrutinised and speculated about.

The Pakistani government had been conducting a wide-ranging inquiry to account for more than $13.7 million frozen by Swiss authorities in 1997 that was allegedly stashed in banks by Bhutto and her husband. The Pakistani government recently filed criminal charges against Bhutto in an effort to track down an estimated $1.5 billion she and her husband are alleged to have received in a variety of criminal enterprises.Swiss Want Bhutto Indicted in Pakistan for Money Laundering, 20 August 1998, Thursday, by Elizabeth Olson The documents suggest that the money Zardari was alleged to have laundered was accessible to Benazir Bhutto and had been used to buy a diamond necklace for over $175,000. The PPP has responded by flatly denying the charges, suggesting that Swiss authorities have been misled by false evidence provided by the Government of Pakistan. On 6 August 2003, Swiss magistrates found Bhutto and her husband guilty of money laundering.Asia: Pakistan: Bhutto Sentenced In Switzerland 6 August 2003 They were given six- month suspended jail terms, fined $50,000 each and were ordered to pay $11 million to the Pakistani government. The six-year trial concluded that Bhutto and Zardari deposited in Swiss accounts $10 million given to them by a Swiss company in exchange for a contract in Pakistan. The couple said they would appeal. The Pakistani investigators say Zardari opened a Citibank account in Geneva in 1995 through which they say he passed some $40 million of the $100 million he received in payoffs from foreign companies doing business in Pakistan.THE BHUTTO MILLIONS; A Background Check Far From Ordinary, 9 January 1998, Friday, By JOHN F. BURNS (NYT) In October 2007, Daniel Zappelli, chief prosecutor of the canton of Geneva, said he received the conclusions of a money laundering investigation against former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on 29 October, but it was unclear whether there would be any further legal action against her in Switzerland.Swiss prosecutor gets case against Bhutto, 29 October 2007, Monday, by The Associated Press Poland The Polish Government has given Pakistan 500 pages of documentation relating to corruption allegations against Benazir Bhutto and her husband.

Bhutto and Asif Ali Zardari allegedly received a 7.15% commission on the purchase through their front men, Jens Schlegelmilch and Didier Plantin of Dargal S.A., who received about $1.969 million for supplying 5,900 Ursus tractors.NAB says Swiss order names Benazir: Ursus tractor case 22 July 2004 France Defence deals with Dassault and DCNS Potentially the most lucrative deal alleged in the documents involved the effort by Dassault Aviation, a French military contractor. French authorities indicated in 1998 that Bhutto's husband, Zardari, offered exclusive rights to Dassault to replace the air force's fighter jets in exchange for a five percent commission to be paid to a corporation in Switzerland controlled by Zardari. At the time, French corruption laws forbade bribery of French officials but permitted payoffs to foreign officials, and even made the payoffs tax-deductible in France. However, France changed this law in 2000. Helicopter scandal In 1998‚Äì1999, an enquiry was conducted by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of the Parliament to investigate the matter regarding the purchase of the helicopter. The case involves defrauding substantive sum of $2.168 million and $1.1 million public money. The record shows that the case was not pursued properly nor diligently. FIR No 1 of 1998 was registered with Federal Investigation Agency State Bank Circle Rawalpindi on the complaint of Cabinet Division. Thorough investigation was conducted by the committee headed by Chaudhry Muhammad Barjees Tahir and two other members, namely Faridullah Jamali and Jamshaid Ali Shah. During this investigation the committee chairman Barjees Tahir summoned both the former President Farooq Leghari and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto along with others, and they were investigated. The case received extensive media coverage both inside and outside Pakistan. The recommendations of the committee, obtained from the file, are as follows: 6.1: That FIR be lodged against (1) Malik Allah Yar Khan of Kalabagh, (2) Zia Pervez Hussain, (3) and Dr M.A. Khan, and that criminal proceedings be instituted against them for defrauding the government. 6.2: That the amount of $2.168 million be recovered from Malik Allah Yar Khan, Zia Pervez Hussain and Dr M.A. Khan by attaching their properties etc. in Pakistan or abroad for this purpose. FIA may be directed to take steps to recover this money through Interpol, if necessary. Any banker or foreign national involved in this fraud may also be taken to task by the Federal Investigation Agency. 6.3: That since Benazir Bhutto is clearly responsible for this loss to the exchequer as major decisions in respect of this contract were taken with her approval or direction and passed on to Cabinet Division through former PS PM (Ahmad Sadiq), FIR may be registered against her for causing loss to state by misuse of her authority as PM, and criminal proceedings be initiated. 6.4: That since Farooq Leghari knows that his name has visibly come up in this case, and he has tried to plead innocent; and since it is unimaginable that those operating in this scandal could have easy access to the top bureaucrats like Cabinet Secretary, Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister and even to the Prime Minister herself without the backing and active support of the President, FIR against him must also be registered and criminal proceedings initiated. 6.5: That as for the senior civil servants involved in the case, Ahmad Sadiq former PS PM, Humayun Faiz Rasul, and Sahibzada Imtiaz former Cabinet Secretary, no action can be taken against them at this stage as they already stand retired/superannuated. The case was further referred to the National Accountability Bureau in 2000‚Äì02 but no action was taken. Western Asia In the largest single payment investigators have uncovered, a gold bullion dealer in Western Asia was alleged to have deposited at least $10 million into one of Zardari's accounts after the Bhutto government gave him a monopoly on gold imports that sustained Pakistan's jewellery industry. The money was allegedly deposited into Zardari's Citibank account in Dubai. Pakistan's Arabian Sea coast, stretching from Karachi to the border with Iran, has long been a gold smugglers' haven. Until the beginning of Bhutto's second term, the trade, running into hundreds of millions of dollars a year, was unregulated, with slivers of gold called biscuits, and larger weights in bullion, carried on planes and boats that travel between the Persian Gulf and the largely unguarded Pakistani coast. Shortly after Bhutto returned as prime minister in 1993, a Pakistani bullion trader in Dubai, Abdul Razzak Yaqub, proposed a deal: in return for the exclusive right to import gold, Razzak would help the government regularise the trade. In November 1994, Pakistan's Commerce Ministry wrote to Razzak informing him that he had been granted a license that made him, for at least the next two years, Pakistan's sole authorised gold importer. In an interview in his office in Dubai, Razzak acknowledged that he had used the license to import more than $500 million in gold into Pakistan, and that he had travelled to Islamabad several times to meet with Bhutto and Zardari. But he denied that there had been any corruption or secret deals. \\"I have not paid a single cent to Zardari,\\" he said. Razzak claims that someone in Pakistan who wished to destroy his reputation had contrived to have his company wrongly identified as the depositor. \\"Somebody in the bank has cooperated with my enemies to make false documents,\\" he said.hdbsj sdn s ds n dsn cnds cn dsnc nds cnd sds vmsd nv d vn House of Graft: Tracing the Bhutto Millions ‚Äì A special report.; Bhutto Clan Leaves Trail of Corruption 9 January 1998Bhutto and Her Legacy: Death in Rawalpindi 28 December 2007The Gold Connection, New York Times, 1998Graft charges against Benazir lead to UK 14 April 1998 Bhutto's niece and others have publicly accused Bhutto of complicity in the killing of her brother Murtaza Bhutto in 1996 by uniformed police officers while she was Prime Minister.\\"Murtaza Bhutto's Murder\\" by Fatima Bhutto retrieved Sun, 30 December 2007 Despite numerous cases and charges of corruption registered against Bhutto by Nawaz Sharif between 1996 and 1999 and Pervez Musharraf from 1999 until 2008, she was yet to be convicted in any case after a lapse of twelve years since their commencement.

He was the grandfather of the Protector, Oliver Cromwell. Early life Sir Henry Williams, alias Cromwell, was of Welsh descent, the eldest son and heir of Sir Richard Williams (‚Äì1544) and Frances (‚Äì), daughter of Thomas Murfyn. His grandfather, Morgan ap William, was the son of a man named William, and also used the name Williams, but his father abandoned the Welsh patronymic system completely and adopted the name of Cromwell, in honour of an uncle Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex. The family then consistently used and wrote its name as \\"Williams, alias Cromwell\\", well into the 17th century. explains that the reason for Sir Richard Williams, the great grandfather of Oliver Cromwell, changing his name, from Williams to Cromwell. \\"Henry VIII strongly recommended it to the Welsh (whom he incorporated with the English) to adopt the English practice in taking family names, instead of their manner of adding their father's, and perhaps grandfather's name to their own Christian one with nap or ap, as Morgan ap William, or Rich, ap Morgan ap William; i.e. Rich, the son of Morgan the son of Will, and the king was the more anxious as it was found so inconvenient in identifying persons in judicial matters. For these reasons, the Welsh, about this time, dropped the ap in many of their names; or, if it could be done with convenience as to pronunciation, left out the a, and joined the p to their father's Christian name (Camden's remains; from which it appears that many Christian names were appropriated to families; for the reasons above \\"we have the Williams's, Lewis's, Morgans, &c.; &c.; without number, and, by joining the p, the Pritchards, Powels, Parrys, i. e. ap Richard, ap Howell, ap Harry, &c.; &c.;). Thus Mr. Morgan ap William, Sir Richard's father, seems, from the pedigree, to have taken the family name of Williams; but, as the surname of Williams was of so late standing, his majesty recommended it to Sir Richard, to use that of Cromwell, in honour of his uncle Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex, whose present greatness entirely obliterated his former meanness (Various lives of Oliver, lord protector, &c.; as also miss Cromwell's pedigree); and it is observable, that Sir Richard's brothers also changed their name to Cromwell (Will of Sir Richard Williams, alias Cromwell, prerogative-office, London, Allan 20. Pedigree of the Williams's, alias Cromwells, Harl. M.S.S. vol. 1174, and Harl. M.S.S. vol. 4135). Thus did the Williams's take, or super-add the surname of Cromwell to that of Williams; and, in almost all their deeds and wills, they constantly wrote themselves Williams, alias Cromwell, down to the seventeenth century. Though the cause of this change is well known, the time is not: many writers pretend the name of Cromwell was not taken up until the time that Sir Richard, was knighted during a tournament; but this is certainly erroneous, as there are grants of ecclesiastical lands patted to him by his names of Williams, alias Cromwell, as early as 1538: these authors are equally mistaken in supposing that the king never knew Sir Richard until the tournament, which cannot be; because those very grants patted some time before these martial games. With the name of Cromwell, Sir Richard assumed the arms of that family; but Sir Henry, his son, and his descendants, retook the proper arms of the Williams's, and never used any other (if the augmentation of the crest is excepted)\\". He was educated at Queens' College, Cambridge. Career He was highly esteemed by Queen Elizabeth I, who knighted him in 1564. He was an important enough man, with a large enough house, for the Queen to do him the honour of sleeping at his seat, Hinchingbrooke House, on 18 August 1564, on her return from visiting the University of Cambridge., Cites Peck's desiderata curiosa.

Mark Noble comments that he had heard that the house of Ramsey was only the lodge of that magnificent pile, and converted by Sir Henry into a dwelling-house. Sir Henry also built Hinchingbrooke House adjoining to the nunnery at Hinchingbrooke,\\"The nuns apartments, or cells, at Hinchinbrook, are now entire, and are used as lodging-rooms for the menial servants; their common room was what is now the kitchen; the church is destroyed, except some trifling ling remains, now part of one of the walls of the house, and seem to have been the corner of the tower; near this place in lowering the flooring, a few years ago, one or more coffins of stone were found.\\" ( writing in 1787) and upon the bow windows there he put the arms of his family, with those of several others to whom he was allied., Cites: Vide the engravings of the arms at Hinchinbrook.

M.S.S. vol. 1179. She was buried at All Saints', Huntingdon, 11 July 1592 but no monument remains of either Sir Henry or of his wives, or indeed any of the name of Cromwell in that place as Huntingdon was devastated during the Civil War and all the monuments and brass plates to the dead were either destroyed or looted., notes that Huntingdon was once very large, but was depopulated by the plague. So late as the reign of King Charles I there were four churches in it, but in the devastations owing to the war in the latter part of that monarch's life, this town was severely handled. St. John's church was entirely destroyed, and another church has only the tower remaining; all the monuments and brass plates, before that time, in the other two were destroyed; so that no information respecting the Cromwell family is to be collected from monumental inscriptions in Huntingdon. The outrages Huntingdon felt during the civil war, her townsmen lay to the account of Cromwell; bur they suffered much more from the royal arms, than they did from those of the Parliament, as both Whitlock, in his memorial, and the author of the memoirs of a cavalier, relate. Lady Susan died of a lingering illness, which in that superstitious age was blamed on witchcraft. On 4 April 1593, in the court presided over by justice Fenner, John Samwell, his wife and daughter were found guilty of causing the death of Joan through witchcraft and executed a few days later (see the Witches of Warboys case). Death Sir Henry lived to a good old age, dying 6 January 1604. He was buried in All Saints' Church, Huntingdon, on 7 January., States: \\"The inquisitio post mortem gives his death 6 Jan., but as he was buried in a magnificent manner, he could not, we may suppose, be buried the next day.

In 1919, he was appointed chairman of the North Caucasus Cheka and took part in fighting with the White Russian forces and the Muslim insurgents in the region. Afterwards he served as a VeCheKa plenipotentiary in Kuban, and Baku. In 1921, he was transferred to Armenia, to direct the suppression of the Dashnaks, and finally, after the final sovietization of the Caucasus, received a post of People's Commissar for Post and Telegraph in the Transcaucasian government. –ê—Ç–∞—Ä–±–µ–∫–æ–≤ –ì–µ–æ—Ä–≥–∏–π –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á.

Viking, Atarbekov acquired a reputation for exceptional violence during the civil war. On 31 October 1918, he chaired a session of Cheka which ordered the execution of 47 prisoners. He ordered the mass killing of hostages in Pyatigorsk on 1 November 1918, and boasted afterwards that he had personally stabbed General Nikolai Ruzsky to death.. He also machine-gunned a train-load of Georgian doctors and nurses returning to Georgia from the World War I fronts.Rayfield (2004), p. 68 In July 1919, Atarbekov was removed from office and subsequently taken to Moscow under escort after the leader of the Astrakhan Bolsheviks, Mina Aristov had complained about his brutality. An initial investigation found against him, but Stalin and Kirov interceded for him, and arranged for his promotion and posting in the North Caucasus.  Death  In March 1925, together with Solomon Mogilevsky and Alexander Miasnikian, Atarbekov boarded a plane from Tiflis to meet Trotsky who was in convalescence in Sukhum.http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1939/xx/kremlin.htm But the plane caught on fire in the air. According to a version, a young Georgian airman who was piloting the plane crashed it deliberately, killing himself and his high-ranking passengers to avenge for the heavy-handed suppression of the 1924 revolt in the Georgian SSR.Lang, David Marshall (1962), A Modern History of Georgia, p. 243.

Consequently, the company's primary competitors in the North American market are other manufacturers/marketers of medium-duty cabover trucks; namely: Isuzu Commercial Truck of America, Inc., a subsidiary of Isuzu Motors and Hino Trucks USA, a subsidiary of Hino Motors. Historically, the company also competed with GMC Medium Duty cabover trucks, but as of July 31, 2009, GM closed the plant that manufactured its medium duty commercial trucks, including its cabover models and announced it was withdrawing from the medium- duty commercial truck market. The same GM plant also manufactured Isuzu class 6 and class 7 models and Isuzu class 3 gasoline-engine cabover models. In the 2010s, GM reintroduced medium duty commercial trucks - examples include the Chevrolet Low Cab Forward, Chevrolet Silverado chassis cab, GMC Savana Cutaway, and GMC Sierra HD chassis cab. Nissan Diesel America was also a competitor in the U.S. Secondarily, MFTA competes with makers of conventional medium-duty trucks. Those are: Ford, Freightliner Medium Duty, International Medium Duty, Kenworth Medium Duty, and Peterbilt Medium Duty. As of 2019, Kenworth markets two medium-duty cabover truck models in the U.S., the Kenworth K270 (Class 6) and K370 (Class 7). Peterbilt sells a medium-duty cabover truck model in the U.S. also, the Peterbilt 220.

History The Governorate was established on January 26, 1822 when the territory of Siberia was divided into two governorates general: West Siberian and East Siberian. Yeniseysk Governorate, with the administrative center of Krasnoyarsk, became a part of East Siberian Governorate General. As of its foundation, the governorate included five okrugs: Achinsky, Kansky, Krasnoyarsk, Minusinsky, and Yeniseysk (with Turukhansky Krai). On April 17, 1914, Uryankhay Krai (conforming roughly to the territory of modern Tuva) was added to Yeniseysk Governorate. This krai existed until August 14, 1921, when it was incorporated as the Tuvan People's Republic independent of Russia. Apart from Mongolia, however, no other country recognized its independence. On November 14, 1923, parts of the governorate's Minusinsky and Achinsky Uyezds were merged with one volost of Kuznetsky Uyezd of Tomsk Governorate to form new Khakassky Uyezd. On March 19, 1924, Siberian Revolutionary Committee (Sibrevkom) approved the enlargement of the governorate's uyezds (districts). On June 23, 1924, new Turukhansky Uyezd was formed in the governorate. Its Yuzhnaya Volost was formed on the part of the territory of Antsiferovskaya Volost of Yeniseysky Uyezd. After that, Yeniseysky Uyezd itself was abolished and its remaining territory split between Kansky and Krasnoyarsky Uyezds. At the same time, Daurskaya Volost of Achinsky Uyezd was transferred to Krasnoyarsky Uyezd. Also in 1924, parts of Znamenskaya and Tashtypskaya Volosts of Minusinsky Uyezd were transferred to Khakassky Uyezd. The former territory became a part of Charkovskaya Enlarged Volost, while the latter was merged into Tashtypskaya Enlarged Volost. The governorate was abolished on May 25, 1925, when it was included into newly formed Sibirsky Krai along with the territories of Oyrat Autonomous Oblast and Altai, Novo-Nikolayevsk, Omsk, and Tomsk Governorates. Achinsky, Kansky, Krasnoyarsky, Minusinsky, and Khakassky Uyezds of the governorate were at the same time transformed into okrugs, while Turukhansky Uyezd was renamed Turukhansky Krai and transferred to Krasnoyarsk Okrug.

At this time they got quite many requests to play at different places in Sweden, but a hand injury forced the lead guitarist Fredrik to quit playing for almost a year. During the six years, they recorded three demo tapes and one CD and they made a number of live performances. They also made T-shirts and other stuff to finance their music. After the break-up, they remixed the demo tapes and other recordings, which have resulted in a couple of new CDs with old material. Komplett Arnold never had a contract with a record company, but they had their own business. They financed their recordings with own owned money and they found distributors for their CD to spread their music to stores and mail-order companies around Sweden.

It has evolved into a grouping of several plants clustered together on a 150-hectare site.  History  In response to Spanish government limits on imports of completed cars, Renault established in 1951 the Spanish FASA (Fabricacion de Automoviles SA) company which built a plant at Valladolid for the assembly of Renault 4CV cars using components imported from France. In 1953, the first year of production, 707 cars emerged from the plant. By 1958, annual output had risen to 7,547 units. The company first produced complete engines in Spain in 1961: by this time the principal model produced at Valladolid was the Dauphine. Production levels continued increasing, with the plant producing 14,537 Dauphines in 1961. 1965 saw the amalgamation of the production business, FASA, with Renault's Spanish distribution company, SAEAR (Soci√©t√© Anonyme Espagnole des Automobiles Renault), which had originally been created in 1908 to distribute cars imported from France, long before import restrictions persuaded the company to create its assembly facility at Valladolid. By 1971, production had increased to 110,255 vehicles, including most of the company's smaller mainstream models such as the Renault 8 and Renault 4. The Renault 5 was added to the plant's production line in 1974, triggering a further expansion of FASA output. By the 1970s, Spain was firmly established as the second largest market for Renault cars after France, and paved the way for Ford to open a new factory at Valencia in 1976, and Opel to build a factory at Zaragoza in 1982, while Volkswagen began building cars in SEAT factories after taking over the former Spanish division of Fiat. , the plant produces the Captur and the Twizy. It manufactured 124,944 cars and 1,247,579 engines in 2013.

He played his early football for Thornliebank a club based in the south of the city of Glasgow, Scotland and played as a 16 year old in the Scottish Cup Final of 1880. Thornliebank were beaten 3‚Äì0 by Queen's Park, and McFettridge played centre-half. He came south, to England, to play for Padiham, then a power in Lancashire football. That was 1883 and, three years later, in 1886, he transferred to Burnley. He soon established himself in the Burnley team and showed himself to be a versatile player with an ability to play attack or defence. However, he soon made the right-half position his own and built a strong relationship with left-half, Jack Keenan. Bill McFettridge played with a hard, robust style proving very effective in those early days. 1888-1889 Bill McFettridge made his League debut on 15 September 1888, playing at full- back, at Pike's Lane, then home of Bolton Wanderers. Burnley defeated Bolton Wanderers 4‚Äì3. Bill McFettridge appeared in 16 of the 22 League games played by Burnley in season 1888‚Äì89. As a wing-half (11 appearances) he played in a Burnley midfield that achieved a big (three-League-goals-or-more) win once. McFetteridge played for Burnley for 5 seasons in the Football League from 1888 - 1893 and made 85 appearances and scored 2 goals.

It also includes a county extension in Suwannee County, Florida from Hildreth to the outskirts of Live Oak, Florida. Route description State Road 49 begins just northwest of the southeastern terminus of the US 19-98-27 ALT concurrency in Chiefland. The road is concurrent with US 129, running northeast until it reaches Northwest 30th Avenue and turns straight north where it remains through the rest of Levy County. A few blocks after crossing the Levy- Gilchrist County line, SR 49 enters the City of Trenton, where it curves briefly to the northeast at Southwest 10th Avenue, only to return directly north at the northern terminus of County Road 339 where the road becomes South Main Street, which contains such historic sites as the Trenton Church of Christ and the Gilchrist County Courthouse. The four corners of Trenton can be found at SR 26, which becomes West Wade Street on the west side and East Wade Street on the east side, while SR 49 changes from South Main Street to North Main Street. Further north in the vicinity of Fourth Avenue and Lancaster Avenue the former Atlantic Coast Line Depot serves as the trailhead of the Trenton-Newberry Rail Trail. At a fork in the road, State Road 47 branches off to the northeast, while US 129/SR 49 turns to the northwest. North of the Trenton City Limits, SR 49 passes by the Trenton Fire Tower near Joppa Lake. After the intersection with CR 344, the road turns straight north again at CR 307, just south of the Sam Whet Farms Airport. In the Town of Bell the only major intersection is CR 342, which runs west to CR 341, although the northern border of the town is at the intersection of Northwest 20th Street, which is CR 236, and also leads to CR 341. North of the town limits, the road intersects CR 340, which is a tri-county road spanning from SR 349 in northeastern Dixie County to Monteocha in Alachua County. The last routed intersection with US 129 in Gilchrist County is CR 138, but the last intersection in general is Northwest 117th Place, which is just south of the bridge over the Santa Fe River where it enters Suwannee County. From the Santa Fe River Bridge, the first intersection is 296th Street, and all subsequent intersections are equally minor until it reaches Hildreth, where it crosses the Suwannee River Greenway TrailSuwannee River Greenway Trail then encounters the east end of a multiplex with U.S. Route 27 (hidden SR 20). US 27-129 becomes a multiplex until they reach the Town of Branford, while State Road 49 continues north as County Road 49. For the most part CR 49 remains straight as it passes by farmland, ranches, and wooded areas, interrupted by the occasional abandoned railroad right-of-way and power line right-of-way. The closest thing resembling a major intersection here is a blinker light and turning ramps at State Road 247, and almost immediately an intersection with CR 248, which leads to a trailhead on the east bank of the Suwannee River. The straight south-to-north trajectory ends when it curves to the northwest as 57th Road runs straight from there, then turns straight again at 224th Street & Novelle Road. The next intersection is a paved road that connects to CR 240 in Columbia County, but has no number in Suwannee County. Two large blocks north of that intersection CR 49 intersects an un-notable dead end dirt road named 210th Place just at a large power line right-of-way. Further north, another power line right-of-way can be found just south of the intersection of 180th Street/South McAlpin Road, but a power substation can be found on the west side between that ROW, and the southwest corner of that intersection. The road makes another brief northwest reverse curve and then turns straight north and south again between 178th and 172nd Streets. Near McAlpin CR 49 crosses a bridge over a small creek, then makes another curve to the northwest and later intersects another moderate county road, specifically the bi-county CR 252 near the Rocky Hill Fire Tower. The rest of the journey is relatively insignificant until it passes the historic Hull-Hawkins House, a home listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Roughly a mile or so north of there, it takes a short curve to the west and then returns to the same northwest angle. Only between Hilldale Road(a dirt road leading to \\"Wings 'N' Sunsets\\" AirportWings N Sunsets LLC Airport (City Data.com)) and 112th Street does it start to turn straight north again, where it stays for the rest of its journey, eventually terminating at U.S. Route 90 (hidden SR 10) east of the City of Live Oak. Diagonally across from the terminus is a de facto continuation onto a local street known as 101st Road.

Historically, the church has been the National Church in Rome of the Southern Netherlands and, in 1830, became the national church of the Kingdom of Belgium. According to tradition, the church was built when Flanders converted to the Christian faith, during the pontificate of Gregory II (715‚Äì753). The little church is part of a Roman building that was once the hospice of St. Julian of the Flemings, built to shelter pilgrims from the county of Flanders (Belgium). Its official denomination since 1979 is \\"Royal Belgian church and Foundation of Saint Julian of the Flemings\\" (, ). In the Consistory of November 26, 1994, Jan Pieter Schotte was appointed the first Cardinal-Deacon of St. Julian, a position now occupied by Cardinal Walter Brandm√ºller, created in 2010.  History of the hospice and the church  Immediately after their conversion, German pilgrims started to arrive in Rome to visit the cult places of Saint Peter and Saint Paul. Guesthouses were built to shelter and feed them ‚Äì small hospices of the Saxons, the Lombards, the Frisians and the Franks (the still existing Campo Santo dei Teutonici e dei FiamminghiSee Italian Wikipedia Chiesa di Santa Maria della Piet√† in Camposanto dei Teutonici) constructed around Constantine I's basilica of St. Peter's. Tradition situates the foundation of the hospice of St Julian in the 8th century, when Flanders was converted to the Christian faith during the pontificate of Pope Gregory II (715‚Äì753). In 1096, Robert II, Count of Flanders visited the hospice on his way to the Holy Land, during the First Crusade. The first historical references to a chapel of St Julian date from the early 15th century. In this period the popes returned to Rome, after their long exile in Avignon. The return of the papal court to Rome attracted many foreigners to the city. Soon the Netherlands created its own infrastructure to shelter the increasing number of Dutch pilgrims. From this period comes one of the oldest writings of St Julian, a copy of which is extant: the statutes and regulations of the hospice for pilgrims in 1444. From 1624, the hospice of St Julian carefully kept records of Dutch pilgrims who visited Rome. From 1624 to 1790, 21,213 were given shelter, mainly from Flanders, but also from Artois, Namur, Hainaut, Tournai and Cambrai. Under the influence of the Renaissance popes, Rome became a center of culture, a magnet for painters, sculptors, musicians and scholars. Supported by foundations such as St Julian of the Flemings, Rome became a place of immigration for Flemings from the 15th to the 17th century. Shoemakers, carpenters, goldsmiths, tailors and soldiers found their second home in Rome. The wealthy Flemings of Rome, the high clergy, merchants, craftsmen and renowned artists became members of the board of the hospice and associate members of the Brotherhood of St Julian. This brotherhood had both a religious and a material dimension. It acquired much prestige in 1536 when the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, born in Ghent, became a member. Although initially the statutes of the foundation restricted the members of its management board to Flemings from the county of Flanders, people from other parts of the Southern Netherlands (Antwerp, Tournai, Binche ‚Ä¶) gradually took part to the functioning of St Julian. The directors of the hospice started to receive financial support from all parts of the Netherlands. With time, the little church of St Julian became more than a center for material support and served as a meeting place for all the southern Dutch living in Rome. In the course of the early Modern Era, the scope of the hospice widened as it became a social center and a source of financial support for the Flemings living in Rome, promoting contacts between Flemings living in Rome. Merchants of Flemish origin acted as patrons of Flemish artists. Active in the administration of Saint Julian between 1618 and 1643, the banker Pieter de Visscher, born in Oudenaarde, had his house in Frascati decorated with frescoes by Flemish Baroque painter Cornelis Schut. Renowned artists such as Jan Miel and Louis Cousin (il Primo Luigi Gentile, Brussels) were part of the board of St. Julian. The most important patron of the foundation was Nicholas Haringhe, a pharmacist from Ypres, who donated all his fortune in the late 17th century to the hospice of St Julian. In 1695 he commissioned the current main altar painting to his friend Theodor Helmbreker. The old organization of the foundation of St Julian disappeared when the French took control of the foundation between 1798 and 1814. The church was then officially transferred to the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and eventually to the Kingdom of Belgium. The patrimony of the foundation consists today of three apartment buildings from the 18th to 19th centuries. The income of the foundation comes from the rent of these apartments to 35 tenants. It has currently no support from the Belgian federal government. The purpose of the foundation has remained for centuries: offer help and hospitality to pilgrims, compatriots who reside in Rome or visit the Eternal City. Entrance of the Church.  Interior  The hospice was thoroughly renovated in 1681‚Äì1682. Inspired by Bernini's Sant'Andrea al Quirinale, the church got its octagonal oval shape in the early 18th century. Antonio Maria Borioni (? - 1727) designed and coordinated the construction of the new church, assisted by his brother Asdrubal Borioni. Most artworks date from the early 18th century. The central medallion of the vault depicts the apotheosis of Saint Julian the Hospitaller. The fresco was painted in 1717 by Englishman William Kent, later known as creator of the English garden and court architect. The medallion is surrounded by four allegorical figures representing Flanders: Bruges and the Brugse Vrije,See Dutch Wikipedia Brugse Vrije Ghent, and Ypres. Over one of the side altars is a 1743 painting by Maximilian De Haese, depicting the apostles Peter and Paul.  Exterior  The Baroque fa√ßade is decorated with a statue of St Julian the Hospitaller, located above the main entrance door. The shields of the Four Members (Bruges and the Franc of Bruges, Ghent, and Ypres) also surround the medallion and adorn the facade of the church under the heading: . Above the entrance of the church, a Latin inscription summarizes the history of the building until 1785.

The General took the name New River after he killed a great Shawnee chief in battle in 1732 on the New River in North Carolina. He was chief of the Catawba from 1780 to 1801 after King Prow was \\"deposed\\" at the beginning of the American Revolutionary War. He was the son-in-law of King Haigler/Hagler/Heigler or Nopkehee. General New River was probably born circa 1725. He married Sally Scott-Toole, daughter of King Hagler's daughter and the white Indian Trader, Matthew Toole. Elkhana Watson in 1786 called him New River, alias Scott. Of course, Watson did not take in account the fact that Sally's maiden name was Scott-Toole, her biological father was Matthew Toole, and her stepfather William Scott. He served in the Revolutionary War, allied with the Colonies. He was recorded on the Muster Roll List of Captain Thomas Drennan. He served in the Snow Campaign of 1775, under Col. Richard Richardson, whose forces near Fort 96, South Carolina, recaptured gunpowder that was intended for the Cherokee. He led a Catawba force of 35 warriors under Maj. William Richardson Davie at The Battle of Hanging Rock, South Carolina in 1780. And was in the Battle of Guilford Courthouse,North Carolina in 1781. The General, according to R. A. Springs, was \\"more than ordinary\\", and held his power through his wife and the respect the Catawba had for her. In 1786, he presented a petition on behalf of his people to save their hunting rights. \\"We your Petitioners, therefore Humbly pray that your Honers out of your great goodness would put a stop to such a glaring breach of Humanity and gratitude, and grant us such privileges of hunting in this state, as in your wisdom you shall think fitt, and we your petitioners as in duty bound shall every pray.\\" While Governor Moultrie was sympathetic, the petition was referred to a committee and the Catawba hunting rights were affirmed by a resolution of the House, the situation probably never changed much. The story was told of the General sucking snake venom from James Spratt, son of Kanawha Spartt, that saved James' life. The General gave the Spratts the land on the reservation. (This is just one version of who gave the land on the reservation to the Spratts.) General New River even borrowed Thomas Spartt's horse at one time. The General rode the horse hard and Spratt beat him for this infraction. The irony was, that later Spratt killed the same horse, doing exactly what he had beaten General New River for doing. The General was described by Elkhana Watson in fairly admirable fashion, \\"his face showed powerful traits of mind and character\\" while Watson's other description of the Indians was not that generous. Reverend Thomas Coke, the Methodist preacher, described him as: \\" a tall, grave old man, (who) walked with a mighty staff in his hand: Round his neck he wore a narrow piece (I Think) of leather, which hung down before and was adorned with a great variety of bits of silver. He also had a silver gorget. Almost all the men and women wore silver nose-rings hanging from the middle gristle of the nose, and some of them had little hearts hanging from the rings.\\" The General died in 1804 at Kings Bottom.

Its varied programme includes contemporary and popular music. Until 2015, the hall was a major venue for classical orchestral music, with Orchestre de Paris and the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France as resident ensembles. Early history An earlier salle Pleyel seating 300 opened in December 1839 at 22 rue Rochechouart; it saw the premieres of many important works, including Chopin's Ballade Op.38 and Scherzo Op.39 (April 26, 1841), Ballade Op.47 (February 21, 1842) and Barcarolle Op.60 (February 16, 1848), the second (1868) and fifth (1896) piano concertos by Saint-Sa√´ns, and Ravel's Pavane pour une infante d√©funte and Jeux d'eau (April 5, 1902) and Sonata for Violin and Cello (April 6, 1922). A replacement 3,000-seat hall was commissioned in 1927 by piano manufacturer Pleyel et Cie. The design work was divided in two: the main designer of the concert hall was Gustave Lyon, an acoustician, director of the Pleyel musical instrument factory and an inventor of several musical instruments. But he entrusted the architectural design to the architect Jacques Marcel Auburtin, who died in 1926, and the work was completed by two of his collaborators, Andr√© Granet and Jean-Baptiste Mathon. The building work began on December 5, 1924 on the land located at No. 252 rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honor√©, near Place de l'Etoile, and was completed in 1927. The inauguration concert by the Orchestre de la Soci√©t√© des Concerts du Conservatoire, with Robert Casadesus as soloist and Igor Stravinsky, Maurice Ravel, and Philippe Gaubert as conductors, included music by Wagner, Manuel de Falla, Igor Stravinsky, Paul Dukas, Debussy, and Ravel. A fire ravaged the interior of the hall on 28 June 1928Mousnier, J-P., Pierre Monteux. L‚ÄôHarmattan, Paris and Montr√©al, 1999, p77. and the renovation cost made it impossible to repay the loan to Cr√©dit Lyonnais bank, which eventually took over the property and reduced the seats to 2,400. They in turn sold the hall to Hubert Martigny in 1998. On 19 August 1945, the Commanding General, U.S. Army Theater Service Forces, European Theater of Operations Lt. Gen. John C. H. Lee gave his V-J Day speech and bade farewell to some 300 officers of the Paris Garrison, many of whom were soon heading home to civilian lives. Stravinsky returned to Paris to conduct the French premiere of Agon in 1957, and of Threni in 1958, both at Salle Pleyel. Recent history From 2002 to 2006, the hall underwent major renovation. The acoustics of the hall and the public and service areas were improved, and seating decreased from the post- fire 2,400 seats to 1,913. The Salle Pleyel has been owned by the Cit√© de la Musique since 2009. Its status as a classical music venue effectively ended in January 2015, when its programming was transferred to the newly-opened Philharmonie de Paris concert hall.http://www.classictic.com/en/special/salle_pleyel/624/Lebrecht, Norman, \\"Thousands Mobilise to Save Classical Music at Salle Pleyel\\", December 26, 2014, at http://www.classictic.com/en/special/salle_pleyel/624/ An orchestral concert featuring live performances of music from various Bandai Namco Entertainment-produced video games, such as Dark Souls and Tekken, took place on February 4, 2017. The event was attended by Motoi Sakuraba and Go Shiina, composers of the aforementioned games. Design influence In terms of influence, at the time of its completion, the concert hall was lauded for its acoustics by the leading modernist architect Le Corbusier. The interior form (tapered plan and curved ceiling) had a noted influence on the design of churches designed by the Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, firstly in his proposal for a church in Helsinki (1929, unbuilt) but also for a church he designed in Wolfsburg, Germany (built 1960).Schildt, G√∂ran, Alvar Aalto: A Life's Work - Architecture, Design and Art, Otava, Helsinki, 1994, p.46.

It is owned and managed by Transport for West Midlands. The station is located on Queensway in front of the Cornbow Centre, which houses the Asda superstore plus many other shops, and opposite Halesowen‚Äôs Jobcentre Plus and Norman Church. Originally, Halesowen had no bus station. Instead, most buses boarded adjacent to the old library building in Hagley Street/Great Cornbow, with the Service 130 (Birmingham-Stourbridge) boarding in New Road and Services 137/138 (Birmingham-Brierley Hill) at Shenstone island, some distance from the town. However, a new bus station opposite Church Croft in Queensway was constructed adjacent to the new shopping centre in the late 1960s, enabling Hagley Street to be pedestrianised. All bus services except Services 130/137/138 boarded here. However, these services were also relocated to the Bus Station from 1983 onward, following revisions to bus links into Birmingham. The original bus station remain largely unchanged until part of the shopping centre frontage was sacrificed to enable it to be enlarged in 1999. However, it was soon clear that the station was outdated and it closed in March 2007 for a total redevelopment, which also saw a new Asda superstore opened nearby as part of a multimillion-pound regeneration of Halesowen town centre. The present Bus Station was constructed on the same site and opened in December 2008, along with a new Asda supermarket in the Cornbow Shopping Centre towards the end of the previous month. Whereas the original bus station permitted two-way arrival and departure along Queensway, with some stands located on a refuge on the far side from the shopping centre, all the departure stands in the present one are located on the same side as the Cornbow Centre. It features electronic departure doors that are automatically activated by arriving buses, thus permitting full passenger segregation from manoeuvring vehicles.

Females usually only have linear streaks of hyperpigmentation. The syndrome is also referred to by the acronym X-Linked-PDR or XLPRD. It's a very rare disease, genetically determined, with a chronic course. It was characterized in 1981. Mutation of the POLA1 gene leads to loss of expression of the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase-Œ± and is responsible for XLPDR. Loss of POLA1 expression results in reduced levels of RNA:DNA hybrids in the cytosol and unexpectedly triggers aberrant immune responses (e.g. type I interferon production) which at least in part can account for the symptoms associated with XLPDR. Another trigger of the immunodeficiency phenotype is a functional deficiency of NK cells, major players of innate antiviral immune system. Presentation Affected males develop generalized reticular hyperpigmentation in early childhood. Hair often looks bedraggled or brushed backward, hanging low on the forehead. Under XLPDR conditions, autoimmune manifestations are developed due to chronically activated anti-viral type I interferon response, connecting XLPDR with disorders like Aicardi-Goutiere syndrome, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Psoriasis, etc. https://www.nature.com/articles/ni.3409 3 Meanwhile, another typical symptom - immunodeficiency - can be developed due to discovering a functional defect in the cytolytic activity of NK cells. Starokadomskyy at al. discovered that POLA1 deficiency is associated with decreased direct cytotoxicity of NK cells due to disturbances in vesicular traffic. Meanwhile, antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) remains unchanged in XLPDR NK cells. The most common manifestations of XLPDR: * Recurrent respiratory infections * Dyskeratosis corneal *Photophobia * Hypohidrosis (lack of sweat glands) * NK cell functional deficiency * Growth retardation * Gastrointestinal disorders * Kidney disease * Kidney stones * Urinary infections * Webbed feet or hands * Electrolyte imbalance * Retinitis pigmentosa * Lymphoedema * Thyroid abnormalities Not every patient shows all of the listed symptoms. However, skin pathologies, recurrent lung infection, high titer of interferon type I in the blood, and impaired direct cytotoxicity of NK cells are the most common symptoms. In females the disease is characterized by skin rashes linear hyper pigmentation following the Blaschko's lines, morphologically similar to stage 3 pigment incontinence.

History The original All Saints Church was founded in 1122 on this site.All Saints Church: City Church of Oxford 1896‚Äì1971, Oxford History. However, on 8 March 1700, the spire of the church collapsed, destroying most of the building. There was an appeal for funds and the current building, seating 350, was completed in 1720. The building was designed by Henry Aldrich, the Dean of Christ Church. Nicholas Hawksmoor is thought to be responsible for the tower and spire. Four of the original bells survived the collapse. The repairs to the church were very expensive and donations were received from most of the Oxford colleges and also Queen Anne. In 1896, when St Martin's Church at Carfax was demolished (except for its tower), All Saints became the official City Church, where the Mayor and Corporation were expected to worship.The City Church, Oxford, Mayors of Oxford. In 1946 a Union Jack which had been draped over the coffins of prisoners of war at Batu Lintang camp, Sarawak, Borneo was placed in the church together with two wooden memorial plaques; they were later moved to Dorchester Abbey.Rev Brian Taylor, 2006, \\"Lintang Camp memorials\\" The Sarawak Museum Journal Vol 62, No 83, 59-62 In 1971, All Saints Church was declared redundant and the City Church moved to St Michael at the North Gate. All Saints was then deconsecrated and offered to Lincoln College, located immediately to the north of the church. Since 1975, after conversion, the building has been Lincoln College's library.The Library, Lincoln College, Oxford. Library The only major change to the interior of the church during its conversion into a library was the raising of the original floor by over four feet to provide space for the lower reading rooms. The upper reading room is known as the Cohen Room and has an elegant plastered ceiling. The decorations include the shields of the major donors who contributed to the cost of the 18th century rebuilding. The lower reading room is the science library and the senior library, holding older books. The science section is named after a former Lincoln College Fellow, Howard Florey (1898‚Äì1968), instrumental in the development of penicillin. The Library still has a full peal of eight bells, which are regularly rung by the Oxford Society of Change Ringers, founded in 1734. They are also rung for special occasions, such as the election of a new Rector of the College.

The court concluded that the district court painstakingly calculated the Guidelines-recommended range of imprisonment, finding that the factual components of its calculations were supported by at least a preponderance of the evidence. The court rejected the defendant's claims of procedural error that the district court improperly calculated his Guidelines offense level by inconsistently crediting parts of his trial testimony and that the district court improperly made findings as to loss amount, number of victims, role, and intent to obstruct justice. Further, the court concluded that Norman's 240-month term of imprisonment was substantively reasonable. Because the court found all of the defendant's claims to be without merit, the court affirmed the judgment.http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate- courts/ca2/13-2840/13-2840-2015-01-09.html Musical career During the 1980s and 1990s, Norman worked with the likes of Paul Shaffer, Carole Pope, Domenic Troiano, Jimmy Smith, Oliver Lake, Salome Bey, Oliver Schroer, and Tiger Okoshi. In addition to performing at New York City's infamous Knitting Factory, a recent concert produced by Thrum Records was aired on Bravo.

The village of Kippford stands near the head of the firth where the Urr Water reaches the sea; the only other coastal settlement of any size is Rockcliffe. The area is designated as the East Stewartry Coast National Scenic Area, one of the forty national scenic areas (NSAs) in Scotland. 44 ha on the eastern side of the firth is owned by the National Trust for Scotland, forming the Rockcliffe property, which covers a stretch of coastline and several small islands (including Rough Island).National Trust for Scotland. Members' Handbook 2017. Description The area includes several different landscapes, as identified by Scottish Natural Heritage when undertaking a review of the \\"special qualities\\" of the area in 2010: There is a small 6th-century trading post known as the Mote of Mark, which stands on a rocky outcrop, and is owned by the National Trust for Scotland. The site was excavated in 1913, and two drystone huts were found, along with over 100 flints, which may be prehistoric in origin. Additionally, a small piece of Samian ware and a piece of a mortarium were uncovered, along with fragments of clay moulds from the early Christian period, and pieces of 9th-century glass likely to have come from the Mediterranean region. Another historic site within the East Stewartry Coast is Orchardton Tower, a ruined tower house built in the fifteenth century. It is located 6 km south of Dalbeattie, and 2 km south of Palnackie. It is remarkable as the only cylindrical tower house in Scotland, being built around 200 years after such towers had gone out of fashion. Orchardton Tower is in the care of Historic Environment Scotland as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. East Stewartry Coast National Scenic Area National scenic areas are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development. The areas protected by the designation are considered to represent the type of scenic beauty \\"popularly associated with Scotland and for which it is renowned\\". The East Stewartry Coast was first defined as an NSA in 1981, and was redesignated under new legislation in 2010. The designated area covers 9620 ha in total, of which 8447 ha is on land, with a further 1173 ha being marine (i.e. below low tide level). As well as the inlet of Rough Firth and its immediate surroundings the designated area extend eastwards as far as the Mersehead Sands near the small settlement of Caulkerbush. The northern edge of the NSA borders Dalbeattie Forest. National scenic areas are primarily designated due to their scenic qualities, however the area covered may well have other special qualities, for example related to culture, history, archaeology, geology or wildlife. Areas with such qualities may be protected via other national and international designations that overlap with the NSA designation. The East Stewarty Coast NSA overlaps partially with the Solway Firth Special Area of Conservation and Special Protection Area.

The UK carrier networks are required by Ofcom to be 99.999% resilient. This means there should be no more than 5 minutes per year downtime in any single telephone exchange. Connectivity from the local telephone exchanges to the customer premises is called the \\"last mile\\". This can be an ISDN30 connection, delivered through either a copper or fibre cable. This ISDN30 can carry 30 simultaneous telephone calls and many direct dial-in telephone numbers, (DDI's). When leaving the telephone exchange, the ISDN30 cable can be buried in the ground, usually in ducting, at very little depth. This makes any business telephone lines vulnerable to being dug up during streetworks, liable to flooding during heavy storms and general wear and tear due to natural elements. Loss, therefore, of the \\"last mile\\" will cause the failure to deliver any calls to the business affected. Business continuity planning often provides for this type of technical failure. Any business with ISDN30 type of connectivity should provide for this failure within its business continuity planning. There are many ways to achieve this, as documented by both the Cabinet Office and the CPNI.  Dual parenting  Dual parenting is where the telephone carrier provides the same numbers from two different telephone exchanges. If the cable is damaged from one telephone exchange to the customer premises most of the calls can be delivered from the surviving route to the customer.  Diverse routing  Diverse routing is where the carrier provides more than one route to bring the ISDN 30‚Äôs from the exchange, or exchanges, (as in dual parenting), but they may share underground ducting and cabinets, (those green boxes by the side of the road.)  Separacy  Separacy is the carrier can provide more than one route to bring the ISDN 30‚Äôs from the exchange, or exchanges, (as in dual parenting), but they may not share underground ducting and cabinets, and therefore should be absolutely separate from the telephone exchange to the customer premises.  Exchange based solutions  Exchange based solutions are where a specialist company working in association with the carriers offers an enhancement to the ability to divert ISDN30‚Äôs upon failure to any other number or group of numbers. Carrier diversions are usually limited to all of the ISDN30 DDI numbers being delivered to 1 single number. In the UK, GemaTech offers this service in association with all of the carriers other than Verizon. By being in the exchanges, the GemaTech version offers a part diversion service if required and voice recording of calls if required.  Non-exchange based diversion services  Non-exchange based diversion services are where a specialist company working in association with BT offers an enhancement to the ability to divert ISDN30‚Äôs upon failure to any other number or group of numbers. Carrier diversions are usually limited to all of the ISDN30 DDI numbers being delivered to 1 single number. In the UK Teamphone offers this service in association with BT Group. By not being in the exchanges, the Teamphone version offers an all or nothing diversion service if required but does not offer voice recording of calls.  Ported number services  Ported number services are where customers numbers can be ported to a specialist company where the numbers are pointed to the ISDN30 DDI numbers during business as usual and delivered to alternative numbers during a business continuity need. These are generally carrier independent and there are a number of companies offering such solutions in the UK.  Hosted numbers  Hosted numbers are where the carriers or specialist companies can host the customers numbers within their own or the carriers networks and deliver calls over an IP network to the customers sites. When a diversion service is required, the calls can be pointed to alternative numbers.  Inbound numbers (08 type services)  Inbound numbers are where the carriers or specialist companies can offer 08/05/03 prefixed numbers to deliver to the ISDN30 DDI numbers and can point them to alternative numbers in the event of a diversion requirement. Both carriers and specialist companies offer this type of service in the UK.  Smartnumbers (both Geographic and Non-Geographic type services)  A smartnumber is a new type of voice continuity number where instead of storing the telephone number in the local BT telephone exchange, it is instead stored in BT's voice continuity 'cloud'. Calls made to a smartnumber can be delivered to any handset anywhere in the UK or the world, thus protecting a company from loss of a telephone exchange, loss of the ISDN or SIP circuits connecting the company to the telephone exchange, loss of the customers PBX on their premises or denial of access to their business premises. Should any of these circumstances occur, the company can use a web-based portal to change the call routing to individual numbers or to large groups of telephone numbers at the same time.

In 2006, the research and development phase of the Korea Helicopter Project - Korea Utility Helicopter (KHP-KUH), costing around 1.3 trillion won ($1.2 billion), was launched by the Agency for Defense Development. In 2012, full-scale production of the Surion commenced; KAI has been designated as the principal manufacturer of the type. An initial force of around 245 Surions have been ordered by the Republic of Korea Army to replace their aging fleets of UH-1H utility helicopters and 500MD light utility helicopters, which have been in service for decades. KAI shall also construct civilian and law enforcement variants of the helicopter. In 2017, the Surion was the centerpiece of an embezzlement scandal involving parent company KAI, the South Korean Ministry of National Defense and its Defense Acquisition Program Administration. Development Origins In December 2005, the South Korean government appointed Eurocopter as the primary partner to KAI for the then-formative Korea Helicopter Project - Korea Utility Helicopter (KHP- KUH). In June 2006, KAI and Eurocopter won the KHP-KUH 1.3 trillion-won ($1.2 billion) research and development contract from the Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) to start the project. It remains Seoul's biggest arms deal ever with a non-US company. The development of the aircraft was funded 84% by the South Korean government and 16% by Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) and Eurocopter. At the time, it was the biggest South Korean defense contract to be issued to a non-American defense company. A production contract worth about 4.4 trillion won ($4.3 billion) is expected to be signed around 2011 before the start of mass production. Eurocopter took a stake of 30 percent in the 2006-2012 development phase and 20 percent in the following ten-year production phase, KAI and the South Korean government held the remaining stakes in the program. As the prime sub-contractor, Eurocopter has provided technical assistance in part for developing the power transmission, main gearbox, boom and tail gearboxes, automatic flight control system and rotor mast. Eurocopter experts were dispatched to KAI premises (Sacheon, South Korea) to provide support and teach KAI engineers state of the art processes and technologies for the design and manufacture of helicopters. KUH-1 Surion prototype during low temperature test in Alaska, 2012 In June 2008, KAI announced that the first prototype KUH was to be rolled in the following month and that ground tests would begin later that year; the firm also stated that it aimed to conduct the type's first flight in early 2010 and for the first production aircraft to be delivered in 2013.Govindasamy, Siva. \\"PARIS AIR SHOW: Korea Aerospace to roll out utility helicopter prototype in July.\\" Flight International, 14 June 2009.

On 10 March 2010, KAI announced that a prototype had performed the maiden flight of the Surion; two test pilots and an engineer had performed a series of taxiing and hovering maneuvers, as well as a stationary hover at 30 ft (9.1m), during this initial flight.Donald, David. \\"Korea's Surion Helicopter Flies.\\" AIN Online, 15 March 2010.Francis, Leithan. \\"PICTURES: Korea Utility Helicopter makes first flight.\\" Flight International, 16 March 2010.

In January 2016, following completion of development work on the amphibious variant of the Surion, it was announced that this variant had been cleared to enter production later that year.Perrett, Bradley.\\"Marines Version OF KAI Surion Ready For Production.\\" Aviation Week, 5 January 2016.Maass, Ryan. \\"KAI completes Surion-variant helicopter development.\\" United Press International, 29 December 2015. Various specialised models and derivatives of the KUH-1 have been proposed. In October 2009, KAI revealed that it was studying the potential for developing an indigenous attack helicopter based upon the KUH platform as one available option for meeting an established Korean Army requirement for a new attack helicopter (AH-X). This variant was reportedly to possibly share up to 70 per cent component commonality with the base KUH version.Govindasamy, Siva. \\"KAI reveals options for army attack helicopter.\\" Flight International, 21 October 2009.

KAI is offering the Surion to international markets for military and civilian purposes. In late 2013, it was reported that KAI had received requests for proposals regarding the Surion from two South American nations and another Asian nation; at the time, KAI stated that the company hoped to sell 60-120 over the following 15‚Äì20 years.Waldron, Greg. \\"KAI eyes export market for Surion.\\" Flightglobal.com, 30 October 2013. International marketing efforts are expected to escalate in 2017, as prior to this point the overwhelming priority had been to fully develop the Surion to conform with existing domestic requirements and roles. KAI has deliberately focused on marketing the type to countries in which previous export success had been found for the KAI T-50 Golden Eagle and KAI KT-1 Woongbi trainer aircraft. Design KUH-1 Surion, 2012 The KAI KUH-1 Surion is a twin-engine medium-sized multipurpose rotorcraft, carrying up to nine troops along with a crew of four (two pilots and two gunners in the main cabin area) in a utility transport capacity. It has been designed to be rapidly reconfigured to serve different roles, some models are also navalised. The Surion can perform various duties and roles, such as military transport, law enforcement, aerial observation, search and rescue, maritime support, aerial firefighting, and for civilian purposes along with other missions.Donald, David. \\"Eurosatory 2016: Versatile lifter [ES2016D5].\\" IHS Jane's 360, 17 June 2016.

The Surion is equipped with various survivability and damage reduction features. Both the airframe and the cockpit have been made bulletproof against small arms fire. The airframe, tail rotor, and the rotor blades used on both the main and tail rotors are of a crashworthy construction; anti-explosion sealed fuel tanks are also used. The main gearbox is capable of flying for a limited period after suffering the loss of lubricating oil.

It was fought between the Swedish Empire and the Holy Roman Empire for the strategically important, fortified Oder crossing Frankfurt an der Oder, Brandenburg, Germany. The town was the first major Imperial stronghold attacked by Sweden outside the Duchy of Pomerania, where Sweden had established a bridgehead in 1630.Theologische Realenzyklop√§die I (1993), p.175 After a two-day siege, Swedish forces, supported by Scottish auxiliaries,Mackillop (2003), p.64 stormed the town.Br√∂ckling (1998), p.57 The result was a Swedish victory. With the subsequent clearance of nearby Landsberg (Warthe) (now Gorzow), Frankfurt served to protect the Swedish army's rear when Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden proceeded further into Central Germany.  Prelude  Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus started to intervene in the Thirty Years' War by supporting Stralsund against Wallenstein in 1628, and landed in Pomerania in June 1630. With the central parts of the Duchy of Pomerania, Sweden had gained a bridgehead in the Holy Roman Empire's northeasternmost corner, while the rest of the empire was occupied by forces of the Catholic League and Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor. Except for Magdeburg, which had allied with Sweden on 1 August, the German Protestant states distrusted Gustavus Adolphus and hesitated to enter an alliance.Ringmar (1996), p.5Lorenzen (2006), p.67 In January 1631, Swedish forces garrisoned in the Pomeranian bridgehead proceeded southwards, and sacked the Pomeranian towns of Gartz (Oder) and Greifenhagen (now Gryfino) near Pomerania's border with Brandenburg. Further southward advances along the Oder into the territory of George William, Elector of Brandenburg followed, and on 23 January 1631, Sweden allied with France in the Treaty of B√§rwalde, concluded in Brandenburgian B√§rwalde (now Mieszkowice).  Siege and storm of Frankfurt  Offensive on Lebus Gate The Swedish forces, commanded by Gustavus Adolphus, were supported by Scottish auxiliaries commanded by John Hepburn and Robert Monro. They laid siege on the town for two days, and stormed it on the second day. The assault was successful and resulted in the sack of the town. The success was in part due to internal quarrels in the defending force‚Äîmercenaries who had not been paid refused to fight without receiving their pay first. The defenders were \\"slaughtered [...] where they stood\\" and suffered 3,000 deaths, compared to 800 casualties on the Swedish side.Parker (1997), p.203 Many deaths occurred when the town was looted.  Aftermath  Scottish major general in Swedish service John Leslie was appointed governor of the town and gave orders to have its defenses strengthened and the thousands of bodies buried. The latter task was achieved by digging mass graves for over a hundred bodies each; after six days, all dead had been buried. John Leslie was soon succeeded as Frankfurt's governor by another Scot, James MacDougal, who was in turn succeeded by a third Scot, Alexander Leslie. Frankfurt served to protect the rear of the advancing Swedish army. The other major town in northeastern Brandenburg, Landsberg (Warthe) (now Gorzow) was taken on 23 April. Subsequently, George William, Elector of Brandenburg was forced into treaties with Sweden on 14 May, 20 June, and 10 September 1631, which put Sweden in charge of the Brandenburgian military capacities, but did not have the status of an actual alliance. Throughout 1631, Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden advanced into central Germany, and while Magdeburg was lost in May and Gustavus Adolphus was hard-pressed at Werben in July, the subsequent victory at Breitenfeld in September paved the way for his advance into southern Germany.

They made it to the league title game again in 1948, but lost to the Eagles in a rematch in the snow. The Cardinals had only four more .500 seasons under her ownership. Move to St. Louis Violet married St. Louis businessman Walter H.S. Wolfner (1898‚Äì1971) in 1949, becoming known as Violet Bidwill Wolfner. When it became apparent that Chicago wasn't big enough for both the Cardinals and the cross-town Bears of George Halas, the Wolfners moved the team to St. Louis after the 1959 season. Death She died in a physician's office in Miami Beach, Florida, on January 29, 1962, and is buried at Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois. In her will, she split her more than 80% interest in the Cardinals between her adopted sons from her first marriage, Charles Bidwill, Jr. and Bill Bidwill, the club president and vice-president. The will was contested in court by her second husband, who was the managing director of the football team. The Illinois Supreme Court upheld the will, in favor of the sons, in February 1963. Wolfner sought to invalidate the legal adoption of the two sons, who had eliminated his position with the team in May 1962. The sons co-owned the team for a decade, until Bill purchased his brother's share of the team in . 16 years after Bill took over the franchise in full, the team made another relocation to Phoenix, Arizona, and have based there since, becoming the Arizona Cardinals in 1994.

The storyline was also referenced when Nixon‚Äôs daughter went missing in season 20. She stated it was the most famous case she investigated during her career as a police officer to that point.

The Kokang incident was a violent series of skirmishes that broke out in August 2009 in Kokang in Myanmar's northern Shan State. Several clashes between the Burmese military junta forces (including the Myanmar Armed Forces, also known as Tatmadaw, and the Myanmar Police Force) and ethnic minorities took place. As a result of the conflict, the MNDAA lost control of the area and as many as 30,000 refugees fled to Yunnan province in neighbouring China.47 Myanmar soldiers reported dead in clashes with Kokang rebels Background The civil war in Burma (later Myanmar) began when the first shots were fired by the Communist Party of Burma (CPB) in April 1948 in the small village of Paukkongyi in the Pegu District (present-day Bago Region). Since the late 1960s Kokang was under control by some warlords, the first of them were the Communists and later the Kokang nationalists. In March 1989 a group made by Phone Kyar Shin was formed as a splinter group from the CPB called the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA). The rebels in Kokang made soon after a ceasefire with the Burmese military government; they also were the first armed ethnic group to do so. That same year was the CPB dissolved after a peace agreement was made between them and the government. Other groups like the National Democratic Alliance Army (NDAA) and the United Wa State Army (UWSA) were also formed in 1989. Like the MNDAA they are splinter groups from the CPB and after their splits, they also made ceasefires with the Burmese government. This would be followed by many rebels in the states Kachin, Kayah, Mon and Shan made partial ceasefire agreements in the 1990s. During the truce agreement, the MNDAA was allowed to control their checkpoints and collect taxes from the people. In return the Tatmadaw was allowed to travel freely within the just established Shan State Special Region 1 (SR1). The MNDAA had in 2007 between 3,000 and 4,000 men. When the 2008 constitution was signed as part of the truce agreement, Kokang became one of the five self-administered zones within Myanmar. Since then, the military junta has proposed that the ethnic armies be assimilated into the Tatmadaw and converted into the Border Guard Forces (BGF); almost all of the ethnic armies have opposed this plan, with exceptions of the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army and the New Democratic Army - Kachin (NDA-K) who joined the BGF. Observers and activists claim that the junta's motivation for this proposal is to disarm and neutralise the ethnic groups before the Myanmar general election scheduled to take place sometime in 2010. Prelude Kokang has been ruled since 1989 by the leader of the MNDAA, Peng Jiasheng (also known as Pheung Kya-shin, Its population was in 2005‚Äì2006 70 per cent Chinese Kokang, 12 per cent Paulang, 3 per cent of each the Miao and Lisu and 2 per cent Wa. Until 2003, the MNDAA officially produced opium but they stopped producing it under Chinese and Burmese pressure. Two years later the Burmese government declared that poppy growing in the Shan State becomes illegal. But even after that there are claims that Kokang has been implicated in illegal drug trade and Drug trafficking. Tensions came to a head on 8 August when the junta military, acting on a tip- off from China, moved into the region for a raid on a gun factory suspected of being a drug front and on Kokang leader Pheung's home. This confrontation, according to the newspaper Shan Herald, was only a \\"stand-off\\", with no shots being fired; nevertheless, it triggered a mass exodus of locals who were worried about the possibility of violence. and a resident of the Kokang regional capital Laukkai later described the city as a \\"ghost town\\". Chinese officials had to intervene in the face-off, and by 17 August officials claimed that the situation in Kokang was \\"normal\\" again. The MNDAA reportedly has about 1,000 to 1,500 soldiers. Recently there has been an inter-faction split within the army, with Pheung being opposed by deputy chairman Bai Xuoqian‚Äîwhile Pheung has opposed efforts to integrate the Kokang army with the Tatmadaw, Bai has supported it and gained the junta's backing. According to the newspaper Shan Herald, several factions of the Kokang army have become loyal to the junta, and three high-ranking army officials informed the junta government that Pheung was secretly producing illicit weapons and drugs. Violence By 20 August, however, government troops were beginning to gather near Laukkai, and Kokang leaders reportedly urged residents to \\"be prepared\\", which prompted even more people to flee. On 24 August, junta troops captured and occupied Laukkai \\"without firing a shot\\". The anti-junta Kachin News claimed that the takeover was aided by a \\"mutiny\\" staged by Kokang army leaders who had become loyal to the junta. On 27 August, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army began to open fire on junta troops outside the city; according to a government statement, the Kokang army raided a police checkpoint near the border. Later Wa, Kachin, and as many as nine other ethnic groups joined in the fighting; the United Wa State Army, Myanmar's largest ethnic military force, was also involved in the fighting, as was the National Democratic Alliance Army (also known as the Mong La Army). On 27 and 28 there were more battles in the villages of Yan Lon Kyaik and Chin Swe Haw, near the Chinese border. Across the border, the Chinese army increased its numbers in attempt to maintain border stability. By late 29 August, the United States- based Campaign for Burma claimed that as many as 700 Kokang fighters, outnumbered by junta troops, had fled, surrendered to the Chinese, and given up their weapons. Kokang soldiers interviewed in China after surrendering also said they had been overrun. While the Kokang army appears to have been routed, the larger United Wa State Army was still active, and Al Jazeera reported that the government was requesting reinforcements to deal with them; The New York Times, however, reported that the Wa army had withdrawn as early as 28 August. The government issued a statement on 30 August claiming that the fighting had ended, and later formed a new \\"Kokang Region Provisional Leading Committee\\" in Laukkai. The Myanmar Army's operation in the incident was overseen by Min Aung Hlaing and he was credited for it by the junta. Casualties and refugees No official casualty count was released in the first two days of fighting, although Pheung Kya-shin claimed that his forces had killed over thirty Tatmadaw troops. One Chinese person was killed during fighting when a bomb went over the border.1 killed by bomb along China-Myanmar border: media. AFP. 29 August 2009. On 30 August, the junta government released its first figures, claiming that the fighting had killed twenty-six junta troops (fifteen police, eleven soldiers) and wounded forty-seven (thirteen police, thirty-four soldiers), and that eight rebel bodies had been found so far; the figures have not been independently confirmed, however. From 8 to 12 August, as many as 10,000 residents fled to Yunnan province in neighbouring China, becoming refugees. The total number of refugees fleeing in the entire month may be as high as 30,000, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and later the Yunnan provincial government.Tran, Tini (29 August 2009). New Myanmar clashes leave 1 dead, dozens injured. Associated Press. Yunnan's police chief later reported that the number of refugees in Yunnan reached 37,000, including Burmese refugees as well as Kokang. Yunnan government officials stated they have established seven locations (particularly near the city of Nansan, where most of the refugees arrived) to house and treat the refugees; some locals, however, claimed that not all the refugees were being housed, or were being housed in unfinished buildings and tents. According to one refugee, about 13,000 of the refugees were housed in the tents, and 10,000‚Äì20,000 more stayed with friends or family in the area. By 31 August, some refugees (as many as 4,000, according to local officials, or 2,800 according to the junta government) had started returning to Kokang; by mid- September, Chinese officials said over 9,000 refugees had returned and Myanmar officials said over 13,000; many refugees, however, were still afraid to go back. Pheung was also rumoured to have fled Kokang, and is currently in China, although his precise location has not been revealed. Before the Kokang forces surrendered, he claimed that he was still controlling them from abroad. Reaction Although China has in the past supported the military junta, during the conflict, it had instead warned Myanmar to end the situation, saying they should \\"properly handle domestic problems and maintain stability in the China-Myanmar border region\\" and urging Burma to protect \\"Chinese citizens in Myanmar\\". Chinese officials were said to be \\"furious\\" and \\" upset\\" over not being forewarned about the offensive on the border. Chinese and other analysts expressed concern that this conflict could lead to a civil war in Burma. The Burmese Foreign Ministry later apologised to China about the incident, but also ran a story on the Dalai Lama in the government newspaper the Myanmar Times, the first mention of him in the state controlled Burmese media for 20 years.Jagan, Larry (1 September 2009). Border war rattles China- Myanmar ties. Asia Times Online. The United Nations has also expressed concern about reports of fighting and thousands of refugees fleeing across the border.Islam, Siddique (29 August 2009). U.N. Voices Concern As Fresh Fighting Breaks Out In Northeastern Burma . AHN. The United States government also voiced its concern, and called on the junta to end its military campaign against the cease-fire groups. Aftermath After the fighting ended, the new Kokang leader claimed that the Kokang people would participate in the 2010 general elections; other cease-fire groups such as the Wa and Kachin still maintain that they will not participate. Bai, vice-president under Peng Jiasheng, became the new head of KoKang with the support of ruling junta in 2009. The portion of the MNDAA loyal to him became Border Guard Force #1006. He is also head of Kokang Self Administered Zone and a member of Myanmar parliament in 2011. The area was peaceful till new clashes between Peng Jiasheng's troops and Myanmar troops erupted in February 2015. Major General Huang Xing, the former head of the research guidance department at the Chinese Academy of Military Science, was ousted in 2015 because of his relationship with MNDAA during this incident.

Water molecules have a strong electrical polarity, meaning that there is a very strong positive charge on one side of the molecule and a strong negative charge on the other. This causes the water molecules to bond to each other and to other charged surfaces, such as soil minerals. Clay in particular has a high ability to bond with water molecules. The strong attraction between these surfaces causes an extremely thin water film (a few molecules thick) to form on the mineral surface. These water molecules are much less mobile than the rest of the water in the soil, and have significant effects on soil dielectric permittivity and freezing-thawing.W.A. Jury & R. Horton, 'Soil Physics', Wiley; 6th edition (2004) In molecular biology and food science, bound water refers to the amount of water in body tissues which are bound to macromolecules or organelles.

On April 1, 1756, a band of Delawares, probably under the command of either Captain Jacobs or Shingas, stormed Fort McCord in western Pennsylvania, where they captured or killed 27 settlers. In response to the raid, three bands of militia were sent in pursuit. Captain Alexander Culbertson's company, numbering about 50, caught up with the Delawares three days later. In a two-hour engagement, both sides suffered heavy casualties, but the colonists were driven off by the arrival of reinforcements. Captain Culbertson was killed and his unit suffered 80 percent casualties.

Search-theoretic models of monetary exchange are based on explicit descriptions of the frictions that make money essential, which contrasts with earlier reduced form approaches to money in macroeconomics, such as putting money in the utility function or imposing cash-in-advance constraints. These earlier ways of modeling money's role did not show explicitly how it helps overcome informational, spatial, or temporal frictions. Search-theoretic models, on the other hand, are based on explicit descriptions of specialization, the pattern of meetings, and the information structure. Kiyotaki and Wright (1989) was the first attempt to use a search-theoretic model to endogenously determine which commodities would become media of exchange, i.e. commodity money. Later, Kiyotaki and Wright (1991) constructed an alternative search-based model to prove that fiat money can be valued as a medium of exchange even if it has a rate of return that is inferior to other available assets. The application of these theories emerged in Kiyotaki and Wright (1993), when the authors developed a tractable model of the exchange process that captures the \\"double coincidence of wants problem\\" in a pure barter setup. In this model, the essential function of money is its role as a medium of exchange. The model can be used to address issues in monetary economics, such as the interaction between specialization and monetary exchange, and the possibility of equilibria with multiple fiat currencies. A shortcoming of search-theoretic models of money is that these models becomes intractable without very strong assumptions, and are therefore impractical for the analysis of monetary policy. Wright and Ricardo Lagos (2005) attempt to overcome this shortcoming by proposing a more general, yet still tractable, framework for the analysis of monetary policy.

The district covers about and is organized as a New England village around a small triangular village green. The T-shaped district includes approximately 72 historic registered structures along two principal streets, Main and Academy Streets. According to the National Register of Historic Places, classes of historic significance include Architecture, Education, Social/Humanitarian and Town Planning. Of interest in architectural classification are: Greek Revival, Victorian, Colonial Revival, Gothic, and French Provincial. The district's NRHP Reference Number is 74001326. The majority of the houses in the historic district date from the second quarter of the 19th century and were mostly built by small tradesman, merchants and retired farmers. The two rows of century-old maples that line Maple Street stand among the simple frame houses. The district's dominant structures are the Presbyterian Church (1830), Fire Tower (1902), Wyoming Inn (1838), Bryant Fleming House (1910) and Village Hall (1902). The historic Middlebury Academy has been listed separately on the National Register of Historic Places since 1974.  District plan  Historic gaslight in the Village of Wyoming, New York. Wyoming Village Historic District is organized much like a New England village around a small triangular green. The T-shaped district includes approximately seventy structures along the two principal village thoroughfares: Main and Academy Streets. The district boundaries are drawn to include the heart of the community where the 1838 Wyoming Inn (#1 S. Academy Street), the turn-of-the century bank (#5 S. Academy) a series of stores, the village \\"Fire Tower\\" (#10 Tower Road) and the Presbyterian Church (#1 N. Academy St.) are clustered around the triangular green. The village nickname is \\"The Gaslight Village\\" because it is lit day and night by 30 gas lamps which use natural gas drawn from near-by shallow gas pockets under a 99-year contract.  Architectural influences   Federal style  Houses in the district show Federal influence and are generally two- story frame buildings with center doorway, five bays wide on the front facade and usually one bay wide on the sides. The notable examples of this style are: * The Newell-Bradley-Bishop House at #73 Main Street, * the Dillon House at #14 S. Academy Street, * the Cushing-Hooker House at #30 S. Academy Street, and * the Chad Ewell-Squires House at #31 Main Street. The most dominant building on the village green is the Presbyterian Church. This steepled, white church is a western New York State adaptation of the New England Church-on- the-Green. A large frame building, it was completed in 1830 and has some Federal features (simple front door and fanlight) as well as some later influences (the narrow paired windows lighting the nave). The interior was remodeled in 1852 and the spire rebuilt in 1870.  Greek Revival style  The 1817 Middlebury Academy (listed separately on the National Register) is known for its monumental Greek Revival portico which was probably added several years later. Some federal style exists in other elements. Two other buildings in the district have prominent Greek Revival characteristics: * The Ferris-Arnold House (#6 N. Academy Street), a one and 1/2 story frame building on an unusually high basement, flush board siding with quoined treatment in wood delineating the three front bays, front entrance with side lights and transom, high front porch with paired fluted columns, balustrade along roofline. On the interior, wallpaper depicts scenes from Sir Walter Scott novels. Formal gardens still evident on south side of house. * The Dodson- Swanson House (#36 Main Street), a large two-story house with centered four bay-wide Doric portico, flanking wings with pitches also supported by fluted Doric columns. Side wings were probably enlarged to present two-story heights later in 19th century, or early 20th century.  Significant or unusual structures  The Wyoming Inn built in 1838 is located at #1 S. Academy Street. It is still operating as a bed and breakfast hotel and community restaurant.Some of the unusual structures dating from its mid-19th century period of growth in the village of Wyoming include: * Seaver-Trumpfheller House (#14 N. Academy St.) is a 2 and one-half story asymmetrical frame house with Victorian barge boards and other elaborate carving around windows and entrance porch. * #46 Main Street was built as the first district schoolhouse in Wyoming, operated since 1916 as a farm supply and hardware store by a family named Handyside. It has a simple one-story structure with narrow clapboards, three bays wide, simple doorway, gable roof with considerable overhang, and louvered cupola. * Ianella-Dutton House (#32 Main Street) ‚Äì two- story frame house with elegant woodwork on porches and in gables similar to #14 N. Academy. Wyoming Presbyterian Church at #1 N. Academy Street within the Wyoming Village Historic District * Warren-Main House (#31 S. Academy) ‚Äì one and one-half story board and batten cottage with gothic trim at the gables. Early twentieth century colonial revival porch added by architect Bryant Fleming * The Main Street churches both burned late in the 19th century. The Baptists replaced their church at #28 Main Street with a substantial brick building about 1876. The Methodist Church at #16 Main Street was built in 1893 and is a frame building with Gothic detailing, finials, and pointed windows. * Fire Tower on Tower Road is a one and one-half-story brick building with a steeply pitched pagoda-like roof. It was built in 1902 as the village fire station and as a companion structure to the Village Hall. Both were a gift to the community from the Lydia Avery Coonley-Ward family who lived just outside the village at the historic Hillside estate. The tower was renovated with a German clock in the 1990s. * Village Hall on Academy Street is a brick building of French provincial architecture. It was built in 1902 along with the Fire Tower as a gift to the village from the Lydia Avery Coonley-Ward family who intended it to be a community center for the fine arts and sciences. On the first floor is a lobby, clubroom, kitchen, and an assembly room. The assembly room is a 2-story space of about 60x40 feet, with ceiling buttresses running up to high dormer windows and rather sharply-sloping roofs. Room fixtures include built-in bench seating, fireplace, and a performance stage. The stage's proscenium arch is flanked by elaborate black teak timbers once part of the King of Siam's exhibit at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. On the mezzanine is a musician's gallery and cloakroom. On the second floor is a small Museum containing an original 1902‚Äì1906 natural history cabinet collection by Mr. Henry A. Ward. A basement contains additional assembly space, toilet facilities, and storage. Village Hall grounds include about 3 acres with mature trees, a carriage house (private residence) and a segment of Gulf Creek. * Middlebury Academy on Academy Street was a college preparatory school for boys. Bryant Fleming's architecture office was in the Academy during his construction of the Hillside estate for Lydia Avery Coonley.

Newman about the pacing horse Dan Patch. The film is also known as Ride a Reckless Mile (American reissue title), and Dan Patch. Plot summary In the last decade of the 19th century, chemist David Palmer returns to Oxford, Indiana, after living in Chicago for a few years. The return is brought on by his upcoming marriage to school teacher Ruth Treadwell. Upon his arrival, David receives a very warm welcome from his father, Dan, who makes a living breeding race horses. Dan is disappointed, however, when David tells him they are not to live as a married couple on the farm, but plans to move to Indianapolis. Ruth, who has looked forward to join the sophisticated social life in Chicago is also disappointed by the news. Ruth is quite satisfied when they move to Indianapolis and buy a vast strip of land where David starts his new job. Soon, David visits Oxford to watch his father's new horse debut on the track. A mistake by the groom leads to the horse being severely injured, and can only be used for breeding in the future. Dan makes an attempt to breed the horse with Joe Patchen, a reputable stud from Illinois, and the resulting colt is named Dan Patch. The colt soon grows into a strong horse, ready to train for the race track with Dan's horse trainer, Ben Lathrop. One day David gets a visit from Ben and his tomboy teenage daughter Cissy at the estate. The visitors are treated poorly by Ruth, who has turned into an up-and-coming socialit√© and shows no interest in horse breeding. Ben tells David that Dan Patch has made a record training run before he and his daughter leave. It is not until his aunt Netty sends him a telegram that David learns about his father's illness. He rushes to Oxford and is by his father's side as he passes. David makes a promise to his dying father that he will continue training Dan Patch. For this purpose he brings the horse home with him and builds a race track on the estate. Ruth is not at all happy with the development. As they quarrel, David realizes that he doesn't love her anymore. However, the training is successful, and Dan Patch wins his first race at a county fair. Soon the horse is ready for the big races, and he wins in Detroit, Cleveland and Columbus. In Kentucky, Ben becomes ill and David gets to take his place as a driver. Since the other drivers refuse to race, realizing their horse won't beat Dan Patch, the horse gets to race against time, and breaks the record, running a mile in under two minutes. Because of some trouble at David's regular work at the chemistry company, Ruth tells him to come home and solve it, not willing to risk her high maintenance lifestyle. David sees no other alternative than to return to Indianapolis. When he goes to tell Ben and Cissy, he sees one of the younger drivers, Bud Ransome, talk to Cissy. Later, a fire breaks out in the stables, and David and Cissy manage to put it out, saving the horses. When David comes back to Ruth, he tells her he has decided to sell the estate, quit his job and continue breeding horses instead. She demands a divorce, refusing to live on the farm with him. Ruth gets most of their assets in the divorce, and David keeps the farm and Dan Patch. Cissy is overjoyed that he has returned, having had a crush on him for years. David understands he is in love with young Cissy, and together they decide to sell Dan Patch for $60,000 to be able to live on the farm and continue breeding horses. David and Cissy eventually marry and are blessed with a daughter. The horse goes on to break his own record, running a mile in 1 minute fifty-six seconds in 1906. He also makes a lot of money from different commercial deals, involving using his name on promotional goods. In his last race, watched by David and his family, Dan Patch beats his own record by a full second.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/76852/The-Great-Dan-Patch/ Cast *Dennis O'Keefe as David Palmer *Gail Russell as Cissy Lathrop *Ruth Warrick as Ruth Treadwell *Charlotte Greenwood as Aunt Netty *Henry Hull as Dan Palmer *John Hoyt as Ben Lathrop *Arthur Hunnicutt as Chet Williams *Clarence Muse as Voodoo *Harry Lauter as Bud Ransome *Visalia Abbe as Dan Patch, a Horse Soundtrack * Clarence Muse - \\"Can't Get You Then - Can't Get You Now\\" (Written by Martin Broones) * Clarence Muse - \\"Mixed Team\\" (Written by Alexander Laszlo) * \\"My Old Kentucky Home, Good-Night\\" (Written by Stephen Foster) References External links  * The Great Dan Patch available for free download at Free-Classic-Movies.com Category:1949 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American horse racing films Category:Films about horses Category:1949 drama films Category:Films directed by Joseph M.

In particular, they generalize classical Eisenstein series. They are named after Henri Poincar√©. If Œì is a finite group acting on a domain D and H(z) is any meromorphic function on D, then one obtains an automorphic function by averaging over Œì: :\\\\sum_{\\\\gamma\\\\in\\\\Gamma} H(\\\\gamma(z)). However, if Œì is a discrete group, then additional factors must be introduced in order to assure convergence of such a series. To this end, a Poincar√© series is a series of the form :\\\\theta_k(z) = \\\\sum_{\\\\gamma\\\\in\\\\Gamma^*} (J_\\\\gamma(z))^k H(\\\\gamma(z)) where JŒ≥ is the Jacobian determinant of the group element Œ≥,Or a more general factor of automorphy as discussed in . and the asterisk denotes that the summation takes place only over coset representatives yielding distinct terms in the series. The classical Poincar√© series of weight 2k of a Fuchsian group Œì is defined by the series :\\\\theta_k(z) = \\\\sum_{\\\\gamma\\\\in\\\\Gamma^*} (cz+d)^{-2k}H\\\\left(\\\\frac{az+b}{cz+d}\\\\right) the summation extending over congruence classes of fractional linear transformations :\\\\gamma=\\\\begin{pmatrix}a&b;\\\\\\\\\\\\c&d;\\\\end{pmatrix} belonging to Œì. Choosing H to be a character of the cyclic group of order n, one obtains the so-called Poincar√© series of order n: :\\\\theta_{k,n}(z) = \\\\sum_{\\\\gamma\\\\in\\\\Gamma^*} (cz+d)^{-2k}\\\\exp\\\\left(2\\\\pi i n\\\\frac{az+b}{cz+d}\\\\right) The latter Poincar√© series converges absolutely and uniformly on compact sets (in the upper halfplane), and is a modular form of weight 2k for Œì. Note that, when Œì is the full modular group and n = 0, one obtains the Eisenstein series of weight 2k. In general, the Poincar√© series is, for n ‚â• 1, a cusp form. Notes References *. *.

Kline (1901‚Äì1942) was a United States Navy sailor killed in action during World War II who received the Silver Star posthumously for his actions. Biography Stanley Fly Kline was born in Graterford, Pennsylvania, on 15 November 1901. He enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve on 2 February 1927 and began World War II active duty on 13 July 1942. During Operation Torch, the Allied amphibious landings in North Africa, on 8 November 1942, Kline was assigned to the British Royal Navy warship HMS Hartland as a member of a naval antisabotage party. As Hartland entered the harbor at Oran, Algeria, she came under heavy fire from Vichy French ships and shore batteries. When a shell exploded in a compartment occupied by the boarding party, the survivors found themselves trapped by fire and fumes. Kline, crawling through a small overhead hatch and worming his way along the deck under a hail of shells and machine-gun fire, opened a large hatch and assisted 42 men to safety. He then turned to loading ammunition clips for an automatic rifle and continued his heroic conduct with complete disregard of his own safety until killed by a shell explosion. Awards Kline was awarded the Silver Star posthumously for his conspicuous gallantry at Oran. Namesake The U.S. Navy destroyer escort USS Kline (DE-687) was named for Kline. She was converted during construction into the high-speed transport USS Kline (APD-120), and was in commission as such from 1944 to 1947.

The Aftonbladet‚ÄìIsrael controversy refers to the controversy that followed the publication of a 17 August 2009 article in the Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet, one of the largest daily newspapers in the Nordic countries. The article alleged that Israeli troops harvested organs from Palestinians who had died in their custody.

Written by Swedish freelance photojournalist Donald Bostr√∂m, the article's title was V√•ra s√∂ner plundras p√• sina organ (\\"Our sons are being plundered for their organs\\"). It presented allegations that in the late 1980s and the early 1990s, many young men from the West Bank and Gaza Strip had been seized by Israeli forces and their bodies returned to their families with organs missing. The Israeli government and several US representatives condemned the article as baseless and incendiary, noted the history of antisemitism and blood libels against Jews and asked the Swedish government to denounce the article. The government refused, citing freedom of the press and the Swedish constitution.

The article opened by mentioning arrests related to a suspected money-laundering and organ-trafficking operation involving rabbis, politicians and civil servants in New Jersey and New York. Briefly introducing the problem of the illegal organ trade worldwide, Bostr√∂m then related that he heard and saw things during his stay in the Palestinian territories in 1992, during the First Intifada.Original article in Swedish: Aftonbladet, August 17, 2009: ‚ÄùV√•ra s√∂ner plundras p√• sina organ‚Äù, Aftonbladet: \\"Our sons are plundered of their organs\\". (third party translation: Aftonbladet: \\"Our sons plundered for their organs\\".) A photograph accompanying the article depicted a cadaver with a line of stitches on the torso, identified as that of Bilal Ghanem, who was 19 when he was killed by IDF soldiers on 13 May 1992. The Ghanem family was not interviewed for his article, but Bostr√∂m described his impressions of Ghanem's burial, which he attended: > Together with the sharp noises from the shovels we could hear occasional > laughter from the soldiers who, as they waited to go home, exchanged some > jokes. As Bilal was put in the grave his chest was uncovered and suddenly it > became clear to the few people present just what kind of abuse he had been > exposed to. Bilal was not by far the first to be buried with a slit from his > abdomen up to his chin and speculations on the intent started. The next paragraph of the article quoted other Palestinian families and reads as follows: > The affected Palestinian families in the West Bank and Gaza were sure of > what happened to their sons. Our sons are used as involuntary organ donors, > relatives of Khaled from Nablus told me, as did the mother of Raed from > Jenin and the uncles of Machmod and Nafes from Gaza, who had all disappeared > for a number of days only to return at night, dead and autopsied. > ‚Äì Why would they otherwise keep the bodies for up to five days before they > let us bury them? What happened to the bodies during that time? Why are they > performing an autopsy when the cause of death is obvious, and in all cases > against our will? Why are the bodies returned at night? And why with a > military escort? And why is the area closed off during the funeral? And why > is the electricity cut off? There were lots of upset questions from Nafes > uncle. Bostr√∂m also wrote that unnamed UN staff members had told him that \\"organ theft definitely occurred\\" but that they had been \\"prevented from doing anything about it\\". He also reported the response of the IDF spokesperson as being that the allegations of organ theft were lies and that all Palestinian victims are routinely subjected to autopsy. Bostr√∂m noted that according to Palestinian statistics for 1992, Bilal Ghanem had been one of 133 Palestinians killed and one of 69 going through postmortem examination. Bostr√∂m concluded the article with his opinion: questions on what was happening remained unanswered and should be investigated. Meanwhile, family members of Bilal Ghanem, the Palestinian at the centre of the article's allegations, stated that they had never told Bostr√∂m that Ghanem's organs had been removed. However, even though they never spoke to Bostr√∂m and lacked any proof to confirm the allegations, they thought that Bilal had been deprived of some organs.Palestinians seek organ theft probe Al Jazeera 28 August 2009 In a follow-up editorial, Aftonbladet editor Jan Helin wrote that he approved the article for publication \\"because it raises a few questions\\" but acknowledged that the paper then had no evidence for its claims.Swedish editor: I'm not a Nazi, Ynet News 24 August 2009 In August 2009, Bostr√∂m said that he did not know whether the claims were true but that he wanted them investigated;Israel Furious Over Swedish Newspaper Article, Associated Press 19 August 2009 (reprinted in FOX News) he made similar remarks at a November conference in Israel.Report: IDF organ harvesting reporter 'rethinking' story, Haaretz 12-1‚Äî2009 Aftonbladet published an update noting the recent conviction of Yehuda Hiss, Chief Pathologist at Israel's Abu Kabir Institute, and two of his colleagues for improperly taking body tissue from a dead Israeli soldier in 2001. The paper acknowledged that the event did not prove the truth of the original allegations.But did it happen?. Jonathan Cook, Al-Ahram. Issue No. 963, 3‚Äì9 September 2009. Archived on 15 January 2010  Israeli reactions  Government The claim in the article sparked an angry reaction by Israeli Foreign Ministry official Yigal Palmor, who associated the article with mediaeval and 19th-century blood libels. On 23 August, the Israeli Prime Minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, called for the Swedish government to condemn the article. An Israeli official quoted him as saying, \\"We're not asking the Swedish government for an apology, we're asking for their condemnation\\". The Israeli Finance Minister, Yuval Steinitz, said that a continued Swedish refusal to condemn the article might lead Israel to cancel a visit, scheduled for September, by the Swedish Foreign Minister, Carl Bildt. Steinitz told the Israel Army Radio, \\"Whoever doesn't distance himself from this kind of blood libel might not be a welcome guest in Israel at this time. Until the Swedish government understands differently, the state of Israel, the state of the Jews, cannot ignore antisemitic expressions and modern recycling of medieval antisemitism\\". The Israeli Government Press Office, which accredits foreign journalists visiting the country, said that it was delaying its approval for an Aftonbladet correspondent and photographer who are seeking permission to enter the Gaza Strip by the maximum of 90 days allowed by regulations. Netanyahu said that history was replete with blood libel against Jews that have led to murder: \\"These matters cannot be taken lightly. We are not asking from the Swedes anything that we did not ask of ourselves\\". He reminded his ministers that in February 2009, after a satirical skit on the Israeli Channel 10 that had poked fun at the Christian belief that Jesus walked on water and Mary was a virgin had angered the Vatican, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert had expressed regret and sorrow. Netanyahu commented: \\"I don't recall that Olmert's condemnation damaged press freedom in Israel\\". The Israeli Foreign Minister, Avigdor Lieberman, told Army Radio, \\"What angers us is that the Swedish government didn't condemn it but hastened to reprimand the ambassador who did find it right to condemn\\" the story, which he compared to historic anti-Semitic tracts. He accused Sweden of hypocrisy and called the affair \\"an odor of anti-Semitism\\". Lieberman noted the Swedish condemnation of the Muhammed cartoons affair in 2005 as well as Sweden's shutdown of an Internet site in the country that had posted the caricatures and the Swedish foreign minister's letter of apology to the president of Yemen for doing so. He had criticized Sweden for its silence earlier that year when the Malm√∂ decided not to allow spectators to a Davis Cup match between Sweden and Israel. The Israeli Interior Minister, Eli Yishai, said that he would act to prevent the paper's reporters from receiving work permits in Israel. The Welfare and Social Services Minister, Isaac Herzog, said that Israel should take legal steps against the paper. When asked why Israel did not investigate the article's claims, Israel's envoy to Sweden, Benny Dagan, said: \\"Why don't we investigate why the Mossad and the Jews were behind the bombing of the twin towers? Why won't we investigate why Jews are spreading AIDS in the Arab countries? Why won't we investigate why Jews killed Christian children and took their blood and organs to bake matzot on Pessah?\\" On 23 December 2009, after Israeli government officials admitted that organ harvesting had taken place in the 1990s, parliamentary hearings into the issue began in Israel's Knesset. Health officials testified that Israeli authorities had harvested organs from the dead bodies of Israelis and Palestinians in the 1990s for transplant purposes and said that the practice had since been ended. Ahmed Tibi, an Arab citizen of Israel, and a member of the Knesset, testified that he had evidence indicating that organ theft continued, citing the case of Fadul Ordul Shaheen, a Palestinian from Gaza who died of diabetes in 2009. Tibi related that after Shaheen's body was returned to his family with bleeding from the eyes and a deep cut through the body, the family said that both the corneas and kidneys were taken from his corpse. Tibi asked for the complaint to be investigated and also for a government probe on whether organs were being harvested from Palestinian prisoners in Israel. Yaacov Litzman, the deputy health minister, responded that he would investigate the case \\"with all seriousness\\". Media Gideon Levy, in Ha'aretz, criticized the article and the Israeli response and that the article damaged \\"the fight against the occupation\\". Levy criticized Bostr√∂m for not engaging in documentation, investigation and the presentation of proof. He noted, \\"There were cases in which the organs of Palestinians who had been killed were harvested without permission, something the [Abu Kabir] Institute of Forensic Medicine has done to others in Israel, for research purposes. But it's a long way from that to suspicion of trafficking in organs based only on the fact that in 1992 a dead Palestinian was found whose organs had been removed and his body sewn back up. And 17 years later a few Jews were arrested on suspicion of trafficking in human organs. That's not professional journalism, that's cheap and harmful journalism\\". However, he called Lieberman's response \\"ludicrous\\" and stated that it had diplomatically damaged Israel. The editorial line of Ha'aretz was much harsher: \\"Donald Bostrom, a veteran Swedish journalist, wrote a despicable, utterly baseless article\\".A bewildering response Ha'aretz 23 August 2009. It stated, however, that Lieberman' reaction was \\"no less outrageous or inciting\\" than Bostrom's article: \\"Lieberman's impassioned and demagogic reaction has damaged Israel. It cheapened the Holocaust, blew the article out of proportion and caused an international uproar, pushing Sweden ‚Äì which currently holds the presidency of the European Union ‚Äì into an unnecessary confrontation with Israel\\". Maariv published an article reporting that much of Bostr√∂m's story had come from his book Inshallah (2001), which it stated to have been partly financed by the Swedish Foreign Ministry.\\"'◊û◊©◊®◊ì ◊î◊ó◊ï◊• ◊î◊©◊ë◊ì◊ô ◊û◊ô◊û◊ü ◊™◊ó◊ß◊ô◊® '◊í◊†◊ô◊ë◊™ ◊î◊ê◊ô◊ë◊®◊ô◊ù\\" (Swedish Foreign Ministry Financed \\"study\\" of Stealing the Organs) Maariv (in Hebrew) Civil society Yoram Peri head of the Chaim Herzog Institute for Media, Politics and Society at Tel Aviv University, said the report touched a raw nerve among Israelis, who harbour deep distrust towards Europe and believe its newspapers to be pro- Palestinian. Agreeing on the lack of merit in the article, he suggests, however, that politicians had blown the controversy out of proportion for political purposes: \\"Lieberman expressed the feeling of many Israelis who do not understand the European narrative, and they think that any criticism comes from total misunderstanding of the Middle East, or because Europe is totally antisemitic and pro-Palestinian. Very few politicians, unfortunately, are sophisticated enough to distinguish between legitimate criticism and attacks by those with other motives\\". Former diplomat Colette Avital said that Sweden should know the difference between freedom of the press and freedom of opinion: \\"freedom of expression is not unlimited, even in that beautiful northern country\\". She criticised Israeli official and media reactions as \\"blown out of all reasonable proportion\\" and the Israeli Foreign Minister for voicing \\"ridiculous and ultimately harmful threats\\" of cancelling the Swedish minister's visit or refusing entry to Swedish journalists. A support meeting of families of Israeli and Palestinian donors of organs and tissues on 26 August at Sourasky Medical Center, in Tel Aviv, discussed the report. Participants stressed a message that \\"organ donation is saving lives without any conditions\\" and called the report black propaganda against Israel.  Swedish reactions   Government  Elisabet Borsiin Bonnier, the Swedish ambassador to Israel, strongly condemned the article: \\"The article in the Swedish newspaper is shocking and terrifying for us Swedes, as it influences the Israeli citizens.... The embassy can not emphasize more its disgust\\". The Swedish foreign ministry and the Swedish foreign minister, Carl Bildt, distanced themselves from the ambassador's statement and underlined that Sweden is a democracy with freedom of press and that state representatives should not comment on individual articles in newspapers. M√•rten Schultz, senior lecturer in jurisprudence, thought that the appeals to freedom of speech were \\"attempts to use the rhetorically convincing status of the freedom of expression and press legislation in order to pursue a political agenda\\" and exhorted politicians and journalists to bring out and read the Freedom of the Press Act before they said what the government is not entitled to do.M√•rten Schultz: Inget grundlagshinder f√∂r att kritisera Aftonbladet (\\"No constitutional ban on criticism of Aftonbladet\\") Newsmill.se, 24 augusti 2009. The Office of the Chancellor of Justice said that although, the government can not criticize the decision to publish, it might go further in its criticism of the article without violating the Constitution although that might be \\"inappropriate\\". The literal words by the Chancellor of Justice, G√∂ran Lambertz, were the following, according to the Swedish news agency, Tidningarnas Telegrambyr√•: \\"It is not completely clear where the limits are. There is rather a lot one may do, according to the constitution, even if it were to be regarded as politically and legally inappropriate\\".Lag till√•ter h√•rdare artikelkritik TT, 25 August 2009. (\\"Law allows tougher criticism of article\\") On 6 September 2009, Bildt announced the cancellation of a trip he planned to make to Israel on 11 September. There was some speculation in Israel and elsewhere that it was related to the controversy. However, Swedish officials denied that. Legal complaints The Swedish Chancellor of Justice, the sole attorney in enforcing violations to the conventions regarding freedom of the press and freedom of expression as well as the ombudsman on supervising government action both received two written requests asking for investigation into the matter. One asked the chancellor to judge whether the article \\"really would include anything that brings it beyond what the freedom of press allows ‚Äì for example constitute hate speech.\\" The second asked him to open an errand of supervision regarding the Swedish ambassador's statements, and on a principal level explain what an ambassador officially can express on behalf of the high office and the country. Aftonbladet was acquitted of all charges.Aftonbladet: Publiceringen √§r inte antisemitisk (\\"The publishing is not antisemitic\\") Nils Funcke, a Swedish journalist and author on the Swedish constitution, predicted that the Swedish ambassador to Israel would be criticized for her initiative. The question, he said, was how sharp the criticism would be and how the government would react. Despite his deep concerns regarding the quality of journalism in the article, he called it \\"unthinkable\\" that the chancellor's office would take legal action on its contents.  Donald Bostr√∂m and Aftonbladet  The author of the article, Donald Bostr√∂m, spoke to Israel Radio on 19 August 2009 and said that he was worried by the allegations he reported: \\"It concerns me, to the extent that I want it to be investigated, that's true. But whether it's true or not ‚Äì I have no idea, I have no clue\\". Bostr√∂m told CNN that the purpose of his article was to call for an investigation into the claims about stealing organs in the early 1990s.Swedish paper's organ harvesting article draws Israeli outrage, CNN. Retrieved 24 August 2009. In an interview to the Arab media site Menassat, Bostr√∂m said there was \\"no conclusive evidence\\" that organ harvesting was a systematic IDF practice but that there is a \\"collection of allegations and suspicious circumstances\\". He was quoted as saying, \\"The point is that we know there is organ trafficking in Israel. And we also know that there are families claiming that their children's organs have been harvested. These two facts together point to the need for further investigation\\". The newspaper's editor, Jan Helin, said \\"I'm not a Nazi, I'm not anti-Semitic\\" and described himself as \\"a responsible editor who gave the green light to an article because it raises a few questions\\" but noted that Aftonbladet had no evidence that Israel practiced organ harvesting. Aftonbladet published a follow-up to Bostr√∂m's article that defended his report and said that the organ-harvesting allegation \\"should be investigated, either to stop the relentless Palestinian rumors, or, if the rumors prove to be true, stop the trade in body parts\\". It called Bonnier's condemnation of the original article a \\"disgrace\\". Bostr√∂m told Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot, \\"I am not an anti-Semite, and that's what saddens me most in this whole story. I've been a journalist for 25 years and I've always written against racism and segregation\\". He said that he had not meant to imply that IDF soldiers killed Palestinians for their organs: \\"Even the Palestinians don't say that. What they said is that when the Israeli army returned the bodies, 62 of them had been autopsied and 20 Palestinian families I spoke to were certain that their sons' organs had been harvested\\". He acknowledged that he had not personally seen evidence of organ harvesting since the bodies that were returned to the families were never examined to determine whether organs had been taken: \\"As far as I know no one examined the bodies. All I'm saying is that this needs to be investigated\\". He also said, \\"Sweden supports Israel as a country and a people, and I am a part of this. There are many people, I among them, who condemn the Israeli government's policy of occupation and violation of international law. Israel needs to withdraw to its borders and evacuate the settlements. If Israel does this, support for you will reappear\\".  Other media  The Swedish rival newspaper Sydsvenskan sharply criticized Aftonbladet for publishing what it called \\"an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory\\". Henrik Bredberg in Sydsvenskan said: > \\"Donald Bostr√∂m publicised a variant of an anti-Semitic classic, the Jew who > abducts children and steals their blood.... The regrettable aspects just > seem to grow and grow... the Israeli government rages and speaks of an > article which 'shames Swedish democracy and the entire Swedish press'. > Hardly. Freedom of expression and freedom of the press are part of > democracy.... Dare to believe in freedom of the press and open debate. Even > when individual editors make stupid and tasteless decisions.\\" An editorial in G√∂teborgs-Posten stated: > \\"The Foreign Ministry has made it clear that Swedish freedom of the press > applies. Good. Aftonbladet should not be given the unwarranted glory of > martyrdom.... Publication seems to represent an obvious lack of judgment. > Unfortunately the lack of judgment did not stop there. The Swedish > ambassador in Tel Aviv... attacked the article and thereby created the > impression that having views about or intervening in individual publications > should be a task for the government and its representatives.\\" Several political commentators pointed out that Sweden held the presidency of the Council of the European Union at the time of the dispute. From an Israeli point of view, they say, discrediting Sweden as anti-Semitic might be a way to prevent European criticism of Israel's policies.Sydsvenskan, August 24 2009: Political strategy behind Sweden-bashing Dagens Nyheter, August 24, 2009: Ordf√∂randeskapet i EU st√∂rs av Israels ordkrig (\\"Presidency disturbed by Israel's verbal assault\\") Dagen, August 25, 2009: Arne Lapidus: Att slagkraftigt angripa verkliga och inbillade fiender ger ofta inrikespolitiska pluspo√§ng (\\"All-out attacks on real and imagined enemies often lead to gains in domestic politics\\") Swedish-Jewish community Lena Posner-K√∂r√∂si, a leader of Sweden's Jewish community, criticized Israel's official response to Bostr√∂m's article, stating in an interview with the Israeli army radio that Israel's reaction and media outrage had provided the claims with much more exposure than they would have had otherwise and had blown the story out of proportion. She noted how initial widespread condemnations of Aftonbladet and its article in the Swedish media quickly turned into united defence for freedom of the press when Israel requested that the government should condemn it as well. Posner-K√∂r√∂si explained that \\"freedom of expression is sacred\\" to Swedes and that no one \\"understands how Israel dares to interfere\\".\\"Stockholm Jewish leader: Israel caused this mess\\" Ynet 23 August 2009 Posner-K√∂r√∂si was still critical of Aftonbladet, stating in her letter to editor Jan Helin that \\"the Jewish Central Council in Sweden insists that the description is akin to classic antisemitism ‚Äì Jews who kidnap children to slaughter them and steal their blood. We are confounded how a Swedish newspaper once again permits its pages to include such hate speech and expect that you, as editor and publisher to reject antisemitic statements\\". Anders Carlberg, the outgoing chairman of the Jewish Community in Gothenburg called Israel's response \\"unhelpful\\". He said that Israel should have responded by publishing a rebuttal: \\"The stance of the community in general is that it's strange that this has become a government issue at all.... It falls along the lines of Voltaire: I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to death your right to say it.\\" Palestinian reactions Palestinian Authority On 3 Sep 2009, the Palestinian Authority (PA) announced the formation of an interministerial panel to investigate allegations that the Israeli military \\"stole organs\\" from Palestinian detainees. The secretary general of the PA Council of Ministers, Dr Hassan Abu Libdeh, if true, the alleged events, if true, would constitute violations of human rights. The PA's ministers of Health, Interior, and Foreign Affairs, and senior officials from each ministry would, he said, sit on the commission.Ma'an News, \\"High level PA panel to investigate 'organ theft' claims\\", 3 September 2009. Maan News Agency: High level PA panel to investigate \\"organ theft\\" claims In November 2015, in a letter to the UN, the Palestinian Ambassador to the United Nations accused Israel of continuing to harvest organs from Palestinians killed by its forces. Riyad Mansour said that was a confirmation of \\"past reports about organ harvesting\\", which prompted Israel to reject the allegations and condemn them as anti-Semitic.Israel blasts Palestinians after accusations of organ-harvesting. Reuters, 4 November 2015PA claims Israel harvesting organs of dead Palestinians. Times of Israel, 5 November 2015  Ghanem family and relatives  According to The Jerusalem Post, Jalal Ghanem, the brother of Bilal Ghanem, whose photograph had accompanied Bostr√∂m's article, could not confirm the allegations. Jalal said that Bilal was evacuated by the IDF in a helicopter after he had been shot. His corpse was delivered to the family a few days later, and there were stitches on Bilal's body that ran from the chest down to the bottom of the abdomen, and his teeth were missing. Jalal also said that the only time the family saw the Swedish photographer was at Bilal's funeral photographing the event. In subsequent interview with Al-Jazeera, he added that he thought Bilal was among those who had their organs stolen. Their mother denied having told any foreign journalist that her son's organs had been stolen, The Jerusalem Post reported in its article. However, she did not rule out the possibility that Israel was harvesting organs of Palestinians. Another relative of the family, Ibrahim Ghanem, said that the family never told the Swedish photographer that Israel had stolen organs from Bilal's body and speculated, \\"Maybe the journalist reached that conclusion on the basis of the stitches he saw on the body.\\" He also said that the family had no evidence on whether the organs were removed because they had not had an autopsy conducted.

Background He was born in Kristiania as a son of government official (kansellir√•d) Jens K√∏lle and his wife Catharine Hermine Juell. He attended the Christiania Cathedral School, enrolled as a student in 1755 and graduated with the cand.theol. degree in 1760. He applied for various clergical positions in Denmark, but was never appointed, supposedly because of closeness with the Moravian Church. He instead worked as a private tutor, in Kr√•kstad, Fj√¶re and Arendal. In 1770 he bought the farm Snar√∏en and ran his own boarding school. Career K√∏lle wrote several of the textbooks used in his school. In some of these books, he employed linguistic ideas that preceded many actual language reforms in Norway. He emphasized \\"purely Norwegian\\" words in books, and argued for more phonemic orthography in the written language. In an anonymous work released in 1785 he introduced the written feminine grammatical gender in Norway, unheard of in the Danish written culture of the day, but often used orally. He also introduced a precursor to the letter \\"√•\\" instead of \\"aa\\". Following the model of the letter √∏, which was an o with a slash through it, he chose the character ‚±• (a with a slash through it), to replace aa.K√∏lle, Kristian: Kort Avhandling om den Danske Skriverigtighed til n√∏yere Overveyelse, Christiania: 1794, page 133. Although he preferred to use ‚±•, he used √• or aÕ§ (a with superscript o or e) when this type was not available.K√∏lle, Kristian: Introduction to √Ür d√¶t Fornuftigt at have Religion, Christiania: 1794. His principles were attacked by J. J. Vangensten in Norway's first newspaper Norske Intelligenz-Sedler, and by Jens Kragh H√∏st in the Danish Ki√∏benhavnske Efterretninger om l√¶rde Sager, both in 1796. A rebuttal by K√∏lle was printed in both publications in 1797. He was a predecessor of later language reformers, including Rasmus Rask and Knud Knudsen. The letter √• eventually became introduced in Norwegian in 1917,http://snl.no/%C3%85/bokstav and written feminine grammatical gender also became a reality. K√∏lle released the topographical pamphlet K√•rt Beskrivelse over Snar√∏en, en liden G√•rd ved Christiania in 1792. The pamphlet is a useful historical source on Snar√∏en (now: Snar√∏ya), and also contained a section of farmer's advice. The pamphlet was embedded with an issue of Norske Intelligenz-Sedler. In 1794 he released the Enlightenment-typical book √Ür det F√•rnuftigt at have Religion? √Ök Vilken av s√• mange √¶r den F√•rnuftigste?. Both written in his own phonemic orthography. In 1805 he released an autobiography. Personal life He was married to Elisabeth Monrad (1758‚Äì1829), who was a sister of Lars Monrad (1762‚Äì1836), owner of a noted pharmacy in Bergen.Monrad (Store norske leksikon0 They had three daughters. One of them, Catharine Hermine K√∏lle (1788‚Äì1859), is known as both the first female hiker and the first female painter in Norway. Christian K√∏lle sold the farm in 1803, and moved with his family to Kopervik, a place which he considered safer in the event of war. He had intended to move to Strandebarm, then changed his mind, but soon became dissatisfied with Kopervik as well. They moved on to Ulvik in 1805, where he again opened a small learning institution. He died at his farm in 1814, and his wife died in 1829 in Os, Hordaland. In modern times, a road at Snar√∏ya has been named after him.

Though only one was built, it flew successfully from 1912 to 1914, carrying several hundred passengers and flying several thousand miles. Design and development The Handley Page Type E tandem seat monoplane was begun in the hope of winning a War Office competition late in 1911, but the specifications looked hard to meet, so it was decided to complete the machine as a demonstrator and submit a new design (the Type F) for the military prize. The Type E had a good deal in common with its smaller, single-seat predecessor, the Type D. Both were single-engined high-wing aircraft with the characteristic wing plan inherited from the Jos√© Weiss patent. Less technically, both the wings and tails of both machines were varnished yellow, though the fabric-covered fuselage of the Type E was doped bright blue in contrast to the dull grey finish of the Type D. Unsurprisingly, the Type E also inherited the name Yellow Peril. The wings of the Type E had a strongly curved leading edge and a straight but swept back trailing edge. Towards the tip, the trailing edge was extended rearwards to make it more flexible for wing warping. The wings were built around two spars and wire- braced, both above and below to points on the front and rear spars from a pair of fuselage-mounted inverted-V struts, one just forward of each cockpit and joined by a horizontal tie rod. A kingpost was fixed to the rear spar toward the tip where the outer bracing wires were fixed. When this post was moved fore and aft by separate control wires, the wing was warped for lateral control.Flight 26 October 1912 pp.962-6 The fuselage was built around four ash longerons, equally spaced at the front but tapering to a vertical edge at the tail. Underneath the fuselage was a deep central keel, so the lower fuselage cross-section was triangular; on top there was a rounded decking. The tailplane was of steeply swept delta plan like that of the Type D, but carried twin elevators of roughly half-heart shape. In contrast to the Type D, the rudder post was firmly fixed to the fuselage and did not move with the elevators; the rudder was similar in shape to the elevators, moving between them and behind a long rectangular fin. The pilot's open cockpit was a little behind the leading edge of the wing, just aft of the spar and bigger than the passenger's, placed behind the rear spar near the trailing edge. The pilot warped the wings by turning a wheel mounted on a lever which could also be moved fore and aft, operating the elevators. There was a \\"foot tiller\\" for rudder control. The Type E was powered by a 50 hp (37 kW) Gnome rotary engine. These engines were well regarded but produced a lot of hot oil, so a half cowling was installed to shield the pilot. The mainwheels were mounted at the ends of a pair of sprung telescopic legs and joined by a centrally hinged axle with a further pair of fixed struts forming an inverted W arrangement. This structure was stiffened and the aircraft protected against nose-over by a long central skid which curved upwards well forward of the propeller, mounted to the fuselage by a fore and aft pair of inverted-V struts and also joined to the axle hinge. There was a long tailskid which met the ground at the bottom of the rudder post. The Type E made its first straight hops on 26 April 1912 at the Handley Page field at Fairlop and was soon performing well enough to fly to the works at Barking, piloted by Edward Petre. On 27 July it flew from Fairlop to Brooklands on a complicated 55 mile route avoiding the built-up parts of London. In late September, after a period in which Handley Page were preoccupied with the military trials of the Type F and the move of their works from Barking to Cricklewood, the Type E was flown to Hendon by Wilfred Parke and then used to carry some 28 passengers on joy flights, including two children together. It was also flown by other, non-company pilots until sustaining minor damage. During repair the rectangular fin was replaced by a triangular one. Handling was improved and several flights were made with three passengers before the aircraft was spruced up for its appearance at the Olympia Show in February 1913, where it was inspected by King George V. Immediately afterwards a new wing was fitted with the wing warping system replaced by ailerons formed by hinging the outer trailing edge extensions; the earlier side-to-side rolling characteristic was cured. The Type E flew exhibitions, demonstrations and joy rides through the Summer of 1913, mostly in the north of England. It was then modified for use as an advanced single- seat trainer for a flying school at Hendon. The fuselage was shortened by 14 in (356 mm) and the separate pairs of fuselage struts that carried the wing bracing wires were replaced by a four-strut pyramid. The earlier undercarriage was replaced by a simpler arrangement of the kind used on the B.E.2c, with a solid axle and two skids. It flew in that form on 4 July 1914 and was in use to the start of World War I, when it was first impressed, then discarded. The aircraft did not fly again, but made a few celebratory outings and survived until 1940, when it was destroyed to make space in the Radlett factory. In the retrospective type redesignation of 1924, the Yellow Peril or Type E became the H.P.5.

Paterson graduated from UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law and was admitted to the California State Bar in 1975.CSBA Records Career After graduating from law school, Paterson worked for the Legal Aid Society of Alameda County and co-founded A Safe Place, a shelter for battered women in Oakland, California.http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-10-02/html/CREC-1998-10-02-pt1-PgE1879.htm She then worked at the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights for 23 years, and served as its Executive Director for 13 years; before founding the Equal Justice Society. Paterson led the organization‚Äôs work providing free legal services to low-income individuals, litigating class action civil rights cases, and advocating for social justice. At the Lawyers‚Äô Committee, she was part of a broad coalition that filed the groundbreaking anti-discrimination suit against race and gender discrimination by the San Francisco Fire Department. That lawsuit successfully desegregated the department, winning new opportunities for women and minority firefighters. Paterson co-founded and chaired the California Coalition for Civil Rightshttp://calcivilrights.org/about-2/steering-committee/eva-paterson/ for 18 years, and was a leading spokesperson in the campaigns against Proposition 187 and Proposition 209 and numerous other statewide campaigns against the death penalty, juvenile incarceration and discrimination against lesbians and gay men. She served as Vice President of the ACLU National Board for eight years, and chaired the boards of Equal Rights Advocates and the San Francisco Bar Association. Paterson has received more than 50 awards, including the Fay Stender Award from the California Women Lawyers, Woman of the Year from the Black Leadership Forum, the Earl Warren Civil Liberties Award from the ACLU of Northern California, and the Alumni Award of Merit from Northwestern University where she received her B.A. in political science. A self-described beneficiary of affirmative action, Paterson is passionate in support of equal educational opportunities. She co-authored several landmark lawsuits in support of affirmative action: the federal lawsuit challenging California‚Äôs Proposition 209, the successful litigation against U.C. Berkeley‚Äôs admissions policy limiting access to students of color and an amicus brief in Grutter v. Bollinger, in which the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the race-conscious admissions policy at the University of Michigan Law School. Paterson and the Equal Justice Society played a pivotal role in the broad coalition that decisively defeated Ward Connerly‚Äôs California Proposition 54 (2003). The measure would have banned the collection of racial and ethnic data by any state agency, thus making it virtually impossible to track and document race discrimination or to bring civil rights suits to court. She was a leading spokesperson for the ‚ÄúNo on 54‚Ä≥ Campaign. Paterson has delivered commencement addresses on college campuses across the nation, and she has served as an adjunct professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law and at University of California, Hastings College of the Law.

He was the third son of King Boles≈Çaw the Brave of Poland. Having inherited no land from his father, he fled to Germany. After the defeat of his brother Mieszko II Lambert in 1032, Otto received a part of Poland to rule but died shortly after. Family history Otto was the youngest child of Boles≈Çaw the Brave and Emnilda of Lusatia. He was named after Emperor Otto III, who probably stood as his godfather. In 1018 he was present at his father's fourth and last marriage, to Oda of Meissen on Cziczani. After the death of his father in 1025, Otto expected to obtain a part of Boles≈Çaw's heritage, according to Slavic custom, under which a father should divide his legacy among all his sons. However, because Poland became a kingdom, the country could not be divided, and in consequence Otto received nothing from his father's legacy. The sole heir of Boles≈Çaw was Mieszko II Lambert, his eldest son from his marriage to Emnilda. Along with Otto, his older half-brother Bezprym was also disinherited. Bezprym was the older son of Boles≈Çaw I by his second wife, Judith of Hungary, who was repudiated shortly after Bezprym was born. Possibly as a result of this he was allegedly disliked by his father, who determined that Mieszko II was to be his sole heir. Conflict Soon after Mieszko took over the governing of Poland, he either expelled his brothers or forced them to flee from the country. Otto went to Germany, probably to Meissen to the court of his sister Regelinda. In 1031 a combined attack of Kievan and German forces led to the downfall of Mieszko II, who had to flee to Bohemia. The government was taken by Bezprym alone; this allegedly caused Otto's resentment and his approach to Mieszko II. As a result, in the first half of 1032 Bezprym was murdered probably as a result of a conspiracy organized by his half- brothers. In Merseburg on 7 July 1032, Emperor Conrad II divided Poland between Mieszko, Otto, and their cousin Dytryk, grandson of Mieszko I. It is unknown exactly how the country was divided between them.S.Szczur suggests that Otto probably received Silesia (\\"Historia Polski ≈õredniowiecze\\", Wydawnictwo Literackie 2002, , p. 80).

A foot soldier later promoted to sergeant, he served in the Battle of the Bulge and the invasions of the Netherlands and Normandy; later in 1945 he participated in the liberation of a concentration camp. Julius Hatofsky began painting in New York during the 1950s and moved to San Francisco in 1961 to teach at the San Francisco Art Institute, eventually retiring in 1995. According to the critic from Art in America magazine,Mark Van Proyen, Art in America, September 2006 :‚ÄùDuring the 1960s, he worked in a Bay Area Abstract Expressionist mode, creating sumptuous, almost iridescent surfaces animated by streams of sinuous energy.‚Äù after 1973, his paintings gradually moved toward American Figurative Expressionism. :‚ÄùThese works often feature obscure, scurrying phantoms painted in a frothy multihued and multilayered oil impasto‚Ä¶Hatofsky‚Äôs paintings are sensually generous and richly nuanced.‚Äù Julius HatofskyMarianne Constantinou Cronicle Staff Writer, San Francisco Chronicle, Sunday, January 22, 2006 :‚Äùfor 33 years taught painting and figure drawing to generations of aspiring artists at the San Francisco Art Institute. He befriended many, treating them to a round of drinks and a good cigar at the pub, and inviting hundreds at a time to standing-room-only parties at his 5,600-square-foot SoMa loft. He rented the loft for decades, until the dot-com boom of the mid-1990s pushed him and his wife to a Victorian house in remote Vallejo, the nearest town to San Francisco where he could afford to buy a house.‚Äù Close to his death Hatofsky wrote:American Abstract and Figurative Expressionism: Style Is Timely Art Is Timeless (New York School Press, 2009.) . p. 120-123 :‚Äù..Inventing imagery is the basis of my painting. Once involved, I concentrate on scale, inner light, drawing, surface, rhythm, color. Developing these painting concerns has helped to focus my emotional intensity and release my imagination. At age 83, I have a range and variety of expression and imagery and feel a command over the work that has taken over sixty years to acquire. I constantly try to reach deeper, to move beyond my limitations, to challenge myself and to learn. I feel I‚Äôve made considerable progress in the last 25 years.‚Äù Julius Hatofsky, Statement: From the artist‚Äôs archives. Provided by the Estate of Julius Hatofsky.

It carried supplies including food, water and oxygen for the EO-8 crew aboard Mir, as well as equipment for conducting scientific research, and fuel for adjusting the station's orbit and performing manoeuvres. It also carried the second VBK-Raduga capsule, intended to return equipment and experiment results to Earth. Progress M-7 was launched at 13:05:15 GMT on 19 March 1991, atop a Soyuz-U2 carrier rocket flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. It took three attempts to dock with Mir; the first of which occurred at 14:28 GMT on 21 March, and resulted in Progress M-7 approaching to within of Mir, before the attempt was aborted. During a second attempt on 23 March, approach was aborted when the spacecraft was from Mir; however, it passed within before moving away to a holding position whilst the problem was investigated. The first two attempts had used the aft docking port of the Kvant-1 module; however, it was decided to use the forward port of the core module for the next one. At 10:12:00 GMT on 26 March, the Soyuz TM-11 spacecraft which had been occupying this port undocked from it, before flying around the station and docking with Kvant-1 at 10:58:59. Progress M-7 successfully docked with Mir at 12:02:28 GMT on 28 March. During the 39 days for which Progress M-7 was docked, Mir was in an orbit of around , inclined at 51.6 degrees. Progress M-7 undocked from Mir at 22:59:36 GMT on 6 May, and was deorbited at 16:24:00 the next day, to a destructive reentry over the Pacific Ocean. Its Raduga capsule, which had been deployed following the deorbit burn, came down in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic at around 17:20 GMT; however, efforts to recover it were unsuccessful.

Although he was a successful opera singer, he is chiefly remembered for his work as an oratorio soloist. He possessed a rich and lyrical voice that he employed with great expression and nuance. Biography Born in Eschweiler, Altmeyer began his performance career while still a voice student at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik K√∂ln, where he studied under Clemens Glettenberg from 1953 to 1956. His first successes were primarily as an oratorio soloist. He was hired by the Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR) to perform in several recordings of cantatas and other religious music. He went on to win second prize at the WDR's singing competition in 1955. In 1956, Altmeyer joined the roster of singers at the Berlin State Opera, where he sang for the next four years. While there he notably portrayed the title role in the world premiere of Humphrey Searle's The Diary of a Madman. Then starting in the 1960-1961 season, he was the principal lyric tenor at the Staatsoper Hannover, making his debut there as Tamino in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's The Magic Flute. He became particularly successful in that house with several more Mozart roles, like Ferrando in Cos√¨ fan tutte and Don Ottavio in Don Giovanni. He also excelled in portraying roles in works by Albert Lortzing and Gioachino Rossini. Other roles of note included the title roles in Benjamin Britten's Albert Herring and Jacques Offenbach's Orpheus in the Underworld. He also found particular success in the title role of Hans Pfitzner's Palestrina, a role he also performed at both the Vienna State Opera and the Staatsoper Stuttgart. The most important work of Altmeyer's career was in the field of religious music. He was one of the most lauded and prolific oratorio singers of his day. His repertoire spanned from the medieval masters to new compositions. He was particularly admired for his many performances and recordings of works by Johann Sebastian Bach. As an oratorio singer, he performed with major orchestras and musical ensembles throughout Germany, France, Austria, Italy, England, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland. He also participated in two large and highly successful concert tours of North America and performed at major music festivals such as Bachwoche Ansbach, Lucerne, Montreux, Vienna, Florence, Naples and Venice. In 1974, Altmeyer joined the voice faculty of the Musikhochschule Hannover, where he taught for several decades. Among his students is Dantes Diwiak. He continued to appear in operas and concerts during many of these years, giving his last public performance at La Morra in 1996. He died in Hannover at the age of 76 on the anniversary of Bach's death.

Jean- Louis Besnard was in the fur trade by 1770. He was outfitting voyageurs and, in turn, relying on suppliers like Pierre Foretier. He was also in the milling business with a flour mill at Lachine, Quebec. Through a series of events he was forced to declare bankruptcy in September 1776. His dealings with the Montreal merchant Richard Dobie were called into question at that time. Creditors of Besnard sued Dobie because of these transaction. A legal and political melee ensued with the Governor, Sir Guy Carleton, dismissing Chief Justice Peter Livius. Besnard ended up turning over all his assets to his creditors. Although officially considered dishonest, he was allowed to continue in the fur trade and pursue other occupations. He ended up in important positions at Fort Michilimackinac (present day Mackinaw City, Michigan) and died of drowning in Lake Michigan.

History The Cape May Airport, which hosts the museum, was originally constructed by the U.S. Navy from 1941-1942. Commissioned in April 1943 as Naval Air Station Rio Grande, the field was so named due to its proximity to the community of Rio Grande, New Jersey. Due to problems with mail, telegram and telephone service, caused in part by confusion with Rio Grande City, Texas, the Navy opted to rename the airfield as Naval Air Station Wildwood in June 1943. The air station remained in operation as an active naval installation throughout World War II, primarily focused on training operations for Naval Aviators and enlisted Naval Aircrewmen in dive bomber, torpedo bomber and fighter aircraft. Following the end of World War II, the airfield was declared excess to military requirements and was converted to a civilian airport. Hughes OH-6A Cayuse In the mid-1990s, Dr. Joseph Salvatore purchased Hangar #1, which was then in a dilapidated condition. The museum is located in the airport's Hangar #1, which is typical of the design of many U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps aircraft hangars of the 1940s, many of which are still in use today at both active Naval Air Stations, Marine Corps Air Stations and Coast Guard Air Stations across the United States, as well as other civilian airports that formerly served as air stations. The museum's hangar is currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The museum's aircraft collection focuses on World War II, when the U.S. Navy conducted training operations at the site, but also includes more recent vintage military aircraft from the Cold War, the Korean War, the Vietnam War and the post-Cold War period, several of which are on loan from the National Museum of Naval Aviation at NAS Pensacola, Florida.

Plot In March 1939, English antiques dealer Mrs. Bromley (Mary Boland) and her assistant Jennifer \\"Jenny\\" Whittredge (Ida Lupino) travel through Poland making purchases. In Warsaw, Jenny meets Count Stefan Orwid (Paul Henreid) and, after a whirlwind courtship, he asks her to marry him. However, Stefan's aristocratic family is less than welcoming to the English commoner, particularly his sister Janina (Nancy Coleman) and his wealthy, diplomat uncle Count Pawel Orwid (Victor Francen). His mother Zofyia (Alla Nazimova) merely wants to keep peace in the family. Only his other uncle, ineffectual Leopold Baruta (Michael Chekhov), welcomes her. Nonetheless, the wedding takes place. Afterwards, Jenny encourages Stefan to break his family's dependence on Count Pawel's financial aid by persuading his peasant tenants to adopt more modern and efficient farming methods. It works; the harvest is bountiful, and Stefan accepts Jenny's suggestion that they invite the workers to a celebration party in his mansion. Count Pawel makes a surprise visit to express his strong disapproval of Jenny's democratic ideas. However, they are interrupted by the bombing of nearby Warsaw. War has broken out, despite Count Pawel's desperate attempts to placate Nazi Germany. Stefan joins his cavalry regiment, leaving Jenny to supervise the rest of the harvest. Days go by with conflicting radio reports. Finally, a dazed, wounded Stefan returns to the estate. His regiment was wiped out after charging German tanks. He gathers the peasants and asks them to burn the crop and anything else that could be of use to the invaders. They patriotically agree. Count Pawel shows up to take the family out of the country to Romania. Stefan, Jenny, and Leopold remain behind to fight.

Among his sabotage operations was the destruction of 25 Messerschmitt fighter aircraft and 150 engines stored in a bus garage in Oslo, on 14 August 1944, together with Max Manus, Gunnar S√∏nsteby and others. Together with Max Manus he succeeded in sinking the German troop ship SS Donau in the Oslofjord 16 January 1945, by placing magnetic limpet mines with time delay on the ship's side. Personal life Nielsen was born in Kristiania as the son of Christian and Signe Nielsen, and he married Helen N√¶ss in 1941. He was an active amateur boxer in the club Fagforeningenes IF av 1926. World War II Sabotage During World War II he was a member of the armed Norwegian resistance organization Milorg. He cooperated with Kompani Linge soldier Max Manus in the SOE Operation Bundle, sabotage missions directed towards German ships. The group experimented with home-made torpedoes. An attempt to hit a troop ship in Oslofjord was a failure, but a later attempt, in summer 1944, to hit a destroyer outside Moss was a partial success, as the ship was seriously damaged and out of action for seven months. Operation Bundle's greatest success was the sabotage against the German troop ship SS Donau in Oslofjord in January 1945. The intelligence organization RMO managed to find a weak point in the German guarding of the ship during docking time. From beneath a defunct goods lift in a building on the pier it was possible to reach the sea, by making a hole in the floor. A rubber boat and equipment was smuggled in by Alf Borgen in advance, and Nielsen and Manus came by to inflate the rubber boat some days before the arrival of SS Donau. When the ship arrived on 15 January, Nielsen and Manus simply walked into the pier area, passing the control point with ease as Nielsen deliberately slipped and fell right outside the gate. The two then entered the building, climbed down into the rubber boat, and placed ten limpet mines onto the side of the ship. One limpet mine was placed on a smaller vessel Rolandseck. During the sabotage Nielsen and Manus were kept safe by undercover pier worker K√•re Halvorsen, who also had made the hole in the floor. The bombs went off at 2300hrs when Donau was outside Dr√∏bak, instead of in open sea as planned, and the captain managed to beach her.Voks√∏ 1994: 493 Later during the night Donau slipped off land and into somewhat deeper waters before settling. After the explosions on Donau the Germans feared that saboteurs had placed limpets on more ships and towed Rolandseck away from the pier and searched the ship side from rowing boats. No explosives were found and the loading of Rolandseck continued from a short time until the limpet exploded. The Germans were prepared for such a possibility and plugged the resulting hole with a large mat, saving the ship and allowing her to later be placed in dry-dock. On 14 August 1944, Nielsen initiated the sabotage against the Luftwaffe's depot at Bj√∏lsen, where the Luftwaffe had confiscated part of a bus garage belonging to Oslo Sporveier. The depot had been moved there from Kjeller in fear of air strikes. Nielsen extracted information about the location from a contact in Oslo Sporveier, and also came along due to Gregers Gram's stay in Sweden at the time. The saboteurs sneaked into Oslo Sporveier's part of the garage, and stole keys from a night watch without drama. Nielsen kept guard in the night watch office; the other participants were Max Manus, Gunnar S√∏nsteby, Andreas Aubert, Henrik Hop, William Houlder and Erik Hansen Bakke. of plastic explosives, carried to the garage in four suitcases, and a sack with of dynamite were detonated. There was a fire lasting three days in which the Luftwaffe lost 25 Messerschmitt Bf 109's, 150 aircraft engines and their largest store of spare parts for fighters in Norway.Christensen, 2006: pp. 13-17 Nielsen was also in charge of the sabotage of Arbeidstjenesten's office in Wergelandsveien 3. He obtained a copy of the door key (via an imprint in plastilina) together with Dick Zeiner-Henriksen, but the actual sabotage mission was called off because there were people present at the office.Christensen, 2006: pp. 207-210 Propaganda Nielsen came to be one of the leaders of the propaganda organization Operation Derby when it was reorganized after the death of Gregers Gram in November 1944. Operation Derby initially focused on black propaganda directed towards German soldiers, but they also issued the undercover magazine Fritt Land, and distributed the bi- weekly magazine H√•ndslag (produced in Sweden) and the monthly magazine Det frie Norge (from the Norwegian government in London). Death On 4 April 1945 a German crackdown against Operation Derby took place. The home of Kolbein and Kari Lauring was surrounded by German forces, whereupon Kari telephoned Max Manus who in turn notified other resistance members. All resistance members would need to go in hiding at various cover-up apartments scattered around the city. Nielsen went to the address Bygd√∏y all√© 117, to what he assumed to be a safe house, but was surprised by German forces there and fatally shot while escaping. The same thing had happened to fellow resistance fighter Olav Ringdal earlier that day.Christensen 2006, p. 280 Kolbein Lauring and Manus managed to escape from their respective locations, whereas Kari Lauring was arrested.

Route description Gulf County Starting at US 98 across from the intersection of Fifth Street in Port St. Joe as a four-lane divided highway named Cecil G. Costin Senior Boulevard, the road is within viewing distance of the Gulf of Mexico, where it runs east and west rather than the signed north and south route that it is. Along the way it encounters one of the two north ends of County Road 384 The road crosses a diagonal Apalachicola Northern Railroad line that has crossing gates in perfectly lined up with each other from both lanes, and as it curves towards the north it crosses another ANR railroad line. Between these two railroad lines, the surroundings become more rural as the road becomes a two-lane undivided route and southern pine trees surround it. The other north end of CR 384 is at an unmarked and gated dirt road. After crossing a bridge over the St. Joe Paper Company Fresh Water Canal, it serves as the eastern terminus of County Road 382 (Industrial Road), which runs parallel to the northwest side of SR 71 to US 98. The road maintains the same trajectory until it curves slightly to the left before crossing the Elgin Bayliss Bridge over Searcy Creek in White City, but still continues running northeast nevertheless. North of the community limits, the road passes by the Florida Division of Forestry's White City Fire Tower, and then has a shared intersection with the former County Road 50 (St. Joe Paper Company Road) and County Road 387 (Doc Whitfield Road). The road curves from northeast to northwest just before the County Road 381A (Lower Dalkeith Road) near Dalkeith and later has an intersection with County Road 381 (Willis Landing Road) in Gaskins Still. The eastern terminus of County Road 386 (Overstreet Road), is one more moderate intersection within rural Gulf County before State Road 71 runs north through the City of Wewahitchka, where it encounters the eastern terminus of State Road 22, but not before the intersection with its county extension, the western terminus of County Road 22 at Lakegrove Road. North of Wewahitchka, the road runs along the west side of the Dead Lakes State Recreation Area. Calhoun County SR 20 in Blountstown Shortly after the intersections of South Rip Hall Pitts Road and Midway Park Drive, SR 71 crosses the Gulf-Calhoun County Line, where it passes by some random sod farms. In Chipola Park, SR 71 has two major intersections, the first being the southern terminus of State Road 73, and one block later County Road 73A, a suffixed spur of that route. The road then curves to the northeast and crosses the Sweet Water Bridge, then takes an even sharper curve to the northeast. from that point the road is lined with tree farms. After the intersection with CR 392, the road enters Scotts Ferry where it crosses a bridge over the Chipola River, and then turns straight north through Gaskins where it encounters County Road 275, and has a brief concurrency with CR 275 north of C.D. Clark Road. CR 275 later branches off to the northwest, and after this SR 71 turns northeast again. Later the road runs through Sharpstown and curves slightly towards the northwest only to turn back to the same angle it was at before as it crosses a bridge over Coon Creek and enters Flowers Still. Two streets merge with SR 71 on both sides; the eastern terminus of Barfield Road is across the street from the northern terminus of County Road 69 which leads to the Calhoun Correctional Institution, and is a de facto extension of a much more important route. One block later at the intersection of Chipola Road, the route enters the southwest corner of Blountstown, where it takes a sharper curve toward the east while crossing under a power line right-of-way and then over a bridge over Sutton Creek before merging with South Main Street where it turns straight north and south again. The road continues at this trajectory for three more blocks before intersecting the four corners of Blountstown at State Road 20 (Central Avenue), where South Main Street becomes North Main Street, and West Central Avenue becomes East Central Avenue. Two blocks north of there, North Main Street briefly becomes a divided two-lane highway where it crosses the Blountstown Greenway Bike Path, a rail trail that was once part of the Marianna and Blountstown Railroad. Three to four blocks north of the crossing it encounters the southern terminus of State Road 69, then SR 71 takes a sharp turn to the west. Beginning at Margaret Street, the road curves to the northwest and eventually meets the same rail trail it encountered earlier. From there, the road passes through Durham. A dirt road named John F. Bailey Road ends at Route 71, and then becomes part of this route. After intersecting another dirt road named Buddy Clemons Road and passing under the same power line ROW it crossed in southern Blountstown, the road makes a slight turn to the right where it passes by the Calhoun County Airport then runs through the community of Chipola. After serving as what would seem to be the northern terminus of CR 275, the road curves from northwest to northeast and then straight as it intersects Hanna Tower Road and enters Altha, where it resumes the name \\"North Main Street\\" from Blountstown. Further into town, the road has a one block concurrency with County Road 274 between Chipola Street and Main Street. Another segment of CR 275 can be found far east of here along CR 274. Upon leaving Altha, it shifts to the northwest once again. Near Mount Olive Cemetery Road, SR 71 runs through Cox where it later encounters the Farm Air Service Airport Jackson County State Road 71 crosses the Calhoun-Jackson County Line, and the first thing it does is curve to the right to avoid a fork in the road with local dirt road before crossing a bridge over May Mill Creek, The first moderate intersection within the county is the south end of the concurrency with County Road 278 (Alliance Road), as SR 71/CR 278 crosses a bridge over Sink Creek before CR 278 breaks off to the west in Union City onto Peacock Bridge Road. SR 71 continues through Rock Creek, where it intersects the western terminus of County Road 264. North of the bridge over Rooky Creek, the road enters Simsville and passes by Sims Cemetery. The road continues to run to the northwest until it approaches, Oakdale where it turns straight north, and County Road 280 joins SR 71 in a concurrency between Rocky Creek Road to the east and Magnolia Road to the west. After Magnolia Road, SR 71 becomes a divided road and commercial development designed primarily for travelers begins to surround the road as it approaches the diamond interchange for Interstate 10 at Exit 142. The same commercial development continues further north, but the divided highway continues beyond this area as SR 71 runs along a pair of bridges over Bridge Creek, and after passing by a sand and gravel yard, climbs above another pair of bridges over the CSX P&A; Subdivision. The Old Spanish Trail intersects with SR 71 and then turns north in a concurrency with SR 71, and 0.2 miles later both join a concurrency with U.S. Route 90 in Florida where they turn left. US 90/SR 71 runs northwest and intersects three local streets before they dip to cross a bridge over Merrits Mill Pond. Then after passing a riverside RV Park, has several more local intersections before the overlap comes to an end. At the end of this concurrency, US 90 turns west along with the Old Spanish Trail toward Marianna, while SR 71 turns northeast at a wye intersection onto Greenwood Highway. The west leg of the wye does not come without some strings though, specifically the concurrency with CR 164 that runs as far west as the west end of the US 90/SR 73 concurrency. This concurrency is short-lived as it branches to the northeast towards Dellwood, Hornsdale, and Chattahoochee State Park in Alabama, while SR 71 curves north. Here the route enters a more residential area which follows it just before it approaches the northeastern terminus of State Road 166, a short connecting route that leads to Florida Caverns State Park, Chipola College, and then downtown Marianna. Shortly after this the road passes in front of an entrance to the Marianna Municipal Airport, which is also shared by a fire house for Jackson County Fire-Rescue, and the Sunland Training Center. The Greenwood Highway name eventually diminishes and the road adopts the name Bryan Street before entering Greenwood, which contains the northern terminus of State Road 69 which is shared with the eastern terminus of County Road 162, a bi-county road leading west toward Jacob City and Bonifay in Holmes County, Florida. Later the southern terminus of County Road 165 (Basswood Road), branches off to the northeast and takes motorists to the Town of Bascom. After leaving the Greenwood town limits, the road passes by two local airfields; the Acres of Diamonds Airpark and Chipola Airpark. Further north, it curves to the left and encounters the western terminus of another road to Bascom known as CR 164B (Hummingbird Road), which has no connection to County Road 164. The road then intersects a dirt road named Ford Road where it curves around a swamp named Baxter Bay and then enters the Town of Malone where it adopts the name 10th Street and intersects State Road 2. North of the Malone town limits, State Road 71 curves to the northwest as it passes by the Jackson County Correctional Institution. After the prison grounds it runs mostly through farmland and passes five more rural intersections before encountering another wetland area named Jordan Bay. The last intersection in the state is a private dirt road named Deerwood Drive, and two more parcels of farmland can be found on both side of the street before SR 71 ends at the Florida-Alabama state line, with the road continuing as Alabama State Route 53 just south of Grangeburg, Alabama. On the west side at the border, two private houses exist right next to each other in two different states. Major intersections County Road 71A County Road 71A is the sole suffixed route of SR 71.

W. Bush, 41st President of the United States, lying in state in the United States Capitol rotunda on December 3, 2018 State funerals in the United States are the official funerary rites conducted by the Federal government of the United States in the nation's capital, Washington, D.C. that are offered to a sitting or former President of the United States, a President-elect, high government officials and other civilians who have rendered distinguished service to the nation. Administered by the Military District of Washington (MDW), a command unit of the Joint Force Headquarters National Capital Region, state funerals are greatly influenced by protocol, steeped in tradition, and rich in history. However, the overall planning as well as the decision to hold a state funeral, is largely determined by a president elect and his family. usually before the occupation of the office. History and development Funerals of Founding Fathers A Birch's Views of Philadelphia sketch depicting George Washington's mock funeral procession on High Street in Philadelphia on December 26, 1799. The first general mourning proclaimed in the United States came upon the death of Benjamin Franklin in 1790, followed by the death of George Washington in 1799. Preparations for Franklin's funeral after his death on April 17, 1790, included a procession to Independence Hall (then known as the Pennsylvania State House) in Philadelphia and burial at Christ Church Burial Ground on April 21. It is estimated that 20,000 mourners gathered for Franklin's funeral. The cortege was composed of Philadelphia society, ranging from Mayor Samuel Powel to American astronomer David Rittenhouse. Muffled bells rang and flags on the mast of ships as well as atop all government buildings flew at half-staff. The United States Congress convened in New York City, which at the time served as the nation's capital, and passed a concurrent resolution observing an official period of mourning for one month. The French National Assembly, at the suggestion of Honor√© Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau, was so moved by the death of Franklin that the legislature observed a three-day period of mourning. When George Washington died of acute epiglottitis at his Mount Vernon plantation on December 14, 1799, the young nation was stunned. In Philadelphia, which at the time served as the nation's capital for ten years while the new federal city was being built, Congress selected Henry Lee III to eulogize Washington. Mock funerals were held all over the United States. Perhaps the most poignant of them all occurred on December 26, 1799. At daybreak, sixteen cannons were fired and volleys were shot on a half-hour basis in Philadelphia. An empty casket was carried in an elaborate funeral procession which consisted of two marines wearing black scarves escorting a riderless horse festooned with black and white feathers, and a bald eagle depicted on the horse's breast. A religious service was held at the German Lutheran Church officiated by Reverend William White, a bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States. Washington's death was mourned not just in his own country; the news of his death had a profound effect in Europe. In France, Napoleon Bonaparte as First Consul, asked Louis-Marcelin de Fontanes to give a eulogy and ordered a ten- day requiem. In Britain, the Royal Navy was ordered to lower flags at half- mast on its entire fleet. Washington's actual funeral was a simple affair that was organized by the local Masonic lodge and held on December 18, 1799. In his will, Washington stated, \\"[I]t is my express desire that my Corpse may be Interred in a private manner, without parade, or funeral Oration.\\" The funeral procession consisted of the president's casket mounted on and using a caisson, foot soldiers, clergy, and a caparisoned, riderless horse. Upon arrival at a red brick tomb on a hillside in the environs of Mount Vernon, the casket was placed on a wood bier for grieving mourners to gather around for a final viewing and clergy to conduct funeral rites. Reverend Thomas Davis, rector of Christ Church, Alexandria, read the Episcopal Order of Burial. Next, the Reverend James Muir, minister of the Alexandria Presbyterian Church, and Dr. Elisha Dick, conducted the traditional Masonic funeral rites. Two ex- presidents and fierce rivals, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, died within hours of each other on July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson's funeral, held in Charlottesville, Virginia, was simple. No invitations were sent out for the religious service officiated by Reverend Frederick Hatch at the Episcopal Church in Charlottesville. Only friends and family members gathered at his gravesite on the grounds of Monticello. It is likely that Jefferson's casket was wooden, built by Monticello slave John Hemings. The funeral of John Adams at the First Congregational Church (now known as the United First Parish Church) in Quincy, Massachusetts, was held on July 7 and was attended by an estimated crowd of 4,000 people. Pastor Peter Whitney officiated the service. Although many people in Boston wanted Adams's funeral to be held at the State House using taxpayer money, this idea was rejected by the Adams family. Nevertheless, cannons were fired from Mount Wollaston, bells rang, and the procession that took the president's casket from the Adams' home Peacefield to the church was followed by Massachusetts Governor Levi Lincoln Jr., Harvard University President John Thornton Kirkland, members of the state legislature, and United States Congressman Daniel Webster. History of presidential state funerals The first state funeral was for William Henry Harrison in 1841, the first president to die in office. Harrison had served just 31 days before succumbing to complications of pneumonia. Before this, there was no established way of mourning a president. Alexander Hunter, a Washington merchant, was commissioned to plan the ceremony. Hunter had the White House draped in black ribbon and ordered a curtained, upholstered black and white carriage to carry Harrison's casket. An invitation-only religious service was held in the East Room. Dirges were played by the United States Marine Band during the funeral procession to the Congressional Cemetery where interment occurred. Having died of cholera on July 9, 1850, Zachary Taylor was given a state funeral that was very similar to Harrison's nine years earlier. Behind Taylor's black-and-white caisson, his horse \\"Old Whitey\\" followed riderless, with a pair of riding boots reversed in the stirrups. A Harper‚Äôs Weekly drawing depicting the remains of Abraham Lincoln lying in repose in the East Room of the White House on April 18, 1865. It was not until the assassination of Abraham Lincoln on April 14, 1865, that the United States experienced a period of true national mourning, made possible by innovations like the railroad and telegraph. Inconsolable, Mary Todd Lincoln did not attend Lincoln's religious service in the East Room, which was conducted by Reverend Phineas D. Gurley. On the Easter Sunday after Lincoln's death, clergymen around the nation praised the president in their sermons. Millions of people witnessed Lincoln's funeral procession from Washington, D.C. on April 19, 1865, as his casket was transported through New York City to Springfield, Illinois. Lincoln was the first president to lie in state in the United States Capitol Rotunda. After his assassination on September 19, 1881, the remains of James A. Garfield arrived in the nation's capital on September 21. A floral arrangement was mounted on his casket, complemented with ornate \\"stuffed doves of peace.\\" A large crowd of mourners numbering over 100,000 people viewed his casket as he lay in state in the Capitol rotunda. Ulysses S. Grant died on July 23, 1885, after a battle with throat cancer that had been extensively covered by the press. His funeral was held August 8, 1885, in New York, featuring a funeral procession of 60,000 men as well as a 30-day, nationwide period of mourning. People who eulogized him likened him to George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, then the nation's two greatest heroes. A guard of honor carrying the casket of William McKinley up the center steps of the Capitol for the lying in state on September 17, 1901. When the funeral train of William McKinley arrived in Washington, D.C., on September 16, 1901, two days after his death, the casket was taken to the East Room in the White House where a lavish display of palms, fruit trees, and floral arrangements transversed into the Cross Hall. The following day, McKinley's casket was transported to the Capitol rotunda to lie in state. The remains of Warren G. Harding lying in repose in the East Room of the White House on August 7, 1923. The nation was stunned in 1923 when Warren G. Harding died of a heart attack in San Francisco on August 2. When Harding's funeral train arrived at Union Station on August 7, the casket was taken to the East Room in the White House. The following morning, the casket was mounted on a caisson and taken to the Capitol to lie in state. A funeral service was held in the presence of members of Congress, the Cabinet, and dignitaries inside the Capitol rotunda. The silver casket was covered with a flag, a spread eagle, and topped off with red, white, and blue flowers personally designed by Harding's widow Florence. A horse drawn caisson transporting the remains of William Howard Taft from the Capitol to All Souls Church, Unitarian on March 11, 1930. As the only man to be president as well as Chief Justice of the United States, William Howard Taft was given a state funeral in Washington, D.C., that was scheduled for March 11, 1930, three days after his death. He lay in state in the Capitol rotunda and a funeral service was held at All Souls' Unitarian Church. Herbert Hoover had offered the East Room in the White House for the service. However, the president's widow, Helen Taft, decided that it would be more appropriate at the church of which the president was a member. Justices of the United States Supreme Court acted as honorary pallbearers. On April 14, 1945, a horse-drawn caisson transported the casket on Franklin D. Roosevelt on Pennsylvania Avenue en route to Washington Union Station. Due to active military participation of the United States in World War II, it was decided ahead of time that Franklin D. Roosevelt, who experienced a progressive deterioration of his health due to heart disease, would not be given a state funeral as any public display of ceremonial pomp undertaken in Washington, D.C., during a time of war was deemed inappropriate while American G.I.'s were dying overseas. After Roosevelt died of a cerebral hemorrhage on April 12, 1945, his remains were taken from his presidential retreat, the Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia, and sent back to the White House to lie in repose in the East Room. A private funeral service was conducted in the East Room where only family members, close friends, high government officials, members of both chambers of the Congress, and heads of foreign missions attended. There was no lying in state in the Capitol rotunda. However, flags were lowered to half-staff at the White House and the Capitol, an honor that had last gone to Harding in 1923. After private funeral services were held in Washington, D.C., Roosevelt's remains were transported on a funeral train to his Hyde Park, New York residence, Springwood Estate, for interment. Jacqueline Kennedy and Senator Robert F. Kennedy departing Arlington National Cemetery after the conclusion of interment for John F. Kennedy on November 25, 1963. Subsequent state funerals over the years have henceforth been loosely modeled on the Lincoln state funeral, in large part due to Jacqueline Kennedy who instructed White House Chief Usher J.B. West to follow 19th-century protocol during the state funeral of John F. Kennedy. Upon hearing the news of the Kennedy assassination, military and federal government officials immediately began planning for a state funeral. Extensive research on Lincoln's state funeral was performed on the evening of November 23, 1963, by Professor James Robertson, the executive director of the United States Civil War Centennial Commission, and David Mearns, the director of the Library of Congress. The two men went to the government repository where the lights were discovered to be inoperative since they were connected to a timer switch and set to only operate during the library's regular hours. Using flashlights they found copies of Frank Leslie's Illustrated and Harper's Weekly which depicted the Lincoln state funeral in full graphic detail. Using this information, the East Room was quickly transformed into a venue for Kennedy's remains to lie in repose, which matched the exact description of what it was like nearly a century earlier for Lincoln. It is estimated that over 250,000 mourners filed past the slain president's casket in the Capitol rotunda. Dying in his suite at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City on October 20, 1964, Herbert Hoover had made plans in 1958 for a state funeral. Accorded with full military honors, over 70 soldiers from the First Army at Fort Jay on Governors Island in the city as guards of honor during the funeral service held at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church on October 22. When Hoover's casket arrived in Washington, D.C., on October 23, his remains lay in state in the Capitol rotunda for two days before they were flown to West Branch, Iowa, for interment. A guard of honor carrying the remains of Dwight D. Eisenhower down the center steps on the east front of the Capitol on March 31, 1969. When Dwight D. Eisenhower died at Walter Reed Army Medical Center on March 28, 1969, plans for his state funeral had already been drawn up earlier, in 1966, although they were somewhat altered by the Eisenhower family. With a strong emphasis on military rites in honor of Eisenhower's contribution as Supreme Allied Commander during World War II, ceremonial and religious aspects also called for flags to be lowered to half-staff for 30 days, a lying in state in the Capitol rotunda, as well as a religious service held at Washington National Cathedral. The funeral service of Lyndon B. Johnson held at National City Christian Church in Washington, D.C., on January 24, 1973. On January 22, 1973, Lyndon B. Johnson died of a heart attack. Johnson's state funeral overlapped the mourning period of another former president, Harry S. Truman, who had died one month earlier (on December 26). Truman's family opted not to have a state funeral, instead preferring a more private funeral held at the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum in Independence, Missouri. Johnson lay in state for two days in the Capitol rotunda, the United States Air Force performed a flyover during the funeral procession to the Capitol, and flags were lowered to half-staff for 30 days as had been observed for Truman. The Johnson family stayed at Blair House during the state funeral. After funeral services were held at National City Christian Church on January 25, the Johnsons flew back to Texas where interment later that afternoon occurred at the Johnson ranch in Stonewall, Texas. The funeral service of Richard Nixon was attended by President Bill Clinton, former Presidents George H. W. Bush, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford and their wives on April 27, 1994, at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum. On April 18, 1994, Richard Nixon suffered a stroke in his Park Ridge, New Jersey home and died four days later at New York Hospital‚ÄìCornell Medical Center in Manhattan. Despite being a former president eligible for the honor of a full state funeral, and in keeping with Nixon‚Äôs expressed personal wishes prior to his death, his family opted for a subdued funeral service on the grounds of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, California. Consensus was held by members of the Nixon family that had any events occurred at the Capitol, visitors might not be respectful towards the memory of Nixon. After his death, Nixon‚Äôs remains were flown to California in an Air Force jet where his body lay in repose at his presidential library from the morning of April 26 until his funeral service the following day. An estimated 42,000 people passed by Nixon‚Äôs casket in order to pay their respects. Eulogies were delivered by President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Senator Bob Dole, California Governor Pete Wilson, and Reverend Billy Graham. Also in attendance were former Presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and their wives. After the funeral service concluded, Nixon was buried beside his wife Pat. A guard of honor moving the casket of Ronald Reagan to a sunset interment ceremony at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, on June 11, 2004. Ronald Reagan died on June 5, 2004, in Los Angeles, California, from complications of Alzheimer's disease. A state funeral occurred in Washington, D.C., and Simi Valley, California, where Reagan was interred at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. 200,000 mourners (5,000 per hour) filed past Reagan's casket in the Capitol rotunda June 9‚Äì11, 2004. Over two dozen world leaders listened to eulogies given by President George W. Bush, former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher during a national funeral service held at Washington National Cathedral. This funeral also featured a new element: a massive security operation. The state funeral marked the first time that Washington hosted a major event since the September 11, 2001 attacks. As a result, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) designated the state funeral a National Special Security Event (NSSE), making the United States Secret Service in charge of security. Attorney General John Ashcroft told a Senate hearing before the funeral: \\"It is a sad commentary when the observation of a memorial service for a former president of the United States must be labeled a National Special Security Event. Such is the fact of modern life in Washington and such is the nature of the war against al Qaeda.\\" A guard of honor carries the remains of Gerald Ford down the east steps of the Capitol to an awaiting hearse on January 2, 2007. When Gerald Ford died on December 26, 2006, of arteriosclerotic cerebrovascular disease and diffuse arteriosclerosis, a state funeral was held in Palm Desert, California, Washington D.C., and Grand Rapids, Michigan. Eulogies were given at Washington National Cathedral by former President George H. W. Bush, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, journalist Tom Brokaw, and sitting President George W. Bush. Ford's remains were then flown to Michigan for interment at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum. The casket containing the remains of George H. W. Bush is removed from Washington National Cathedral following his funeral service on December 5, 2018. George H. W. Bush died on November 30, 2018, in Houston, Texas, from complications of Parkinson‚Äôs Disease. Departing from Ellington Airport on December 3, Bush‚Äôs remains were transported on a Boeing VC-25 dubbed ‚ÄúSpecial Air Mission 41‚Äù to Washington for a state funeral. After an arrival at Joint Base Andrews and a brief ceremony in the Capitol rotunda where members of Congress, the Supreme Court and the Bush family paid tribute to the life of the president, Bush‚Äôs remains lay in state for public viewing until the morning of December 5. On December 5, a funeral service was held at Washington National Cathedral with eulogies delivered by Bush‚Äôs son and former president, George W. Bush, former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, former Senator Alan Simpson, and historian and author Jon Meacham. President Donald Trump declared a national day of mourning on the day of the state funeral. In addition to Trump and First Lady Melania Trump, guests included former Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and Jimmy Carter. Several world leaders including Polish President Andrzej Duda, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, King Abullah II and Queen Rania of Jordan, and Charles, Prince of Wales representing Britain‚Äôs Queen Elizabeth II attended the funeral service. After the funeral service at the Cathedral, Bush‚Äôs remains were flown back to Texas where his remains lay in repose and a private funeral service was conducted at St. Martin‚Äôs Episcopal Church in Houston on December 6. Bush‚Äôs remains then traveled for two hours and twenty-five minutes via a Union Pacific 4141 funeral train from Spring to College Station, Texas. Interment and burial occurred at the George Bush Presidential Library. History of non- presidential state funerals The first non-presidential state funeral was for Thaddeus Stevens in 1868. When Stevens died on August 11, mourners came to his home in Washington, D.C., to pay their respects, including U.S. Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts. Stevens's remains were transported by a cavalry regiment to the Capitol where he lay in state in the rotunda on August 13, 1868, until the morning of August 14. After a short funeral service, Stevens's remains were taken to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, for interment. In 1921, a state funeral was conducted for the Unknown Soldier of World War I. The idea of honoring the unknown dead of World War I originated in Europe, the first being the United Kingdom and France on November 11, 1920. Other nations such as Italy soon followed this custom. At first, the idea of honoring a fallen and unknown soldier from World War I was met with resistance in the United States since there was no established place for burial of a fallen soldier similar to Westminster Abbey in London or the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. In addition, all American servicemen who fought in the war were in the process of being identified and accounted for by the Army Graves Registration, unlike the British and French who had many unknown dead. By 1920, a resolution in Congress was proposed for such an honor and by March 4, 1921, Public Resolution 67 was approved by the 66th United States Congress for the construction of the tomb of the unknown soldier at Arlington National Cemetery. Congress on October 20, 1921, declared November 11, 1921, the third anniversary of Armistice Day, a legal holiday. The War Department then began a selection process of an unknown soldier. Four bodies were exhumed from four cemeteries; Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial, Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery and Memorial, Somme American Cemetery and Memorial, and St. Mihiel American Cemetery and Memorial in France. During the selection ceremony at Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne, it was Edward F. Younger of Headquarters Company, 2nd Battalion, 50th Infantry, American Forces in Germany who selected the third casket from left that contained an unknown soldier to be honored with a state funeral in Washington D C. and for burial at Arlington. In Washington, D.C., the unknown soldier was escorted to the Capitol in a funeral procession on November 9. With lying in state occurring in the rotunda, some 90,000 people on November 9‚Äì10 filed past the casket that rested on the Lincoln Catafalque. A funeral service was conducted at the Arlington Memorial Amphitheater in the presence of President Warren G. Harding. Interment and burial of the unknown soldier with military rites took place at the newly constructed tomb. On July 15, 1948, General of the Armies John J. Pershing died at Walter Reed Army Hospital. Initially, plans for a state funeral were drawn up ten years earlier when it seemed that the general was near death. The plan was kept a closely guarded secret and during those ten years, Pershing's funeral was revised. As a military man and as one of the highest ranking commissioned officers in the United States Army, Pershing insisted that his state funeral be a military one. His remains lay in repose in the chapel at Walter Reed Army Hospital. During the state funeral scheduled for July 17‚Äì19, 1948, the public would be admitted to view Pershing lying in state in the Capitol rotunda and a funeral procession from the Capitol to Arlington National Cemetery would occur. A funeral service was held at the Memorial Amphitheatre and interment was given with military rites at the gravesite in Arlington National Cemetery. A proposal to posthumously award Pershing a six-star rank was swiftly dropped in favor of the four-star rank that the general attained in his military career.Mossman and Stark, chapter 4: \\"General of the Armies John J. Pershing State Funeral, 15‚Äì19 July 1948\\", Like the Unknown Soldier of World War I, it was decided in June 1946 by the 79th United States Congress that a state funeral and burial in Arlington National Cemetery would be given to an unknown soldier after the end of World War II. However, the selection process would be simplified‚Äîan unidentified serviceman was to be chosen from each of the following: the European area, the Far East area, the Mediterranean zone, the Pacific area, the former Africa-Middle East zone now part of the Mediterranean zone, and the Alaskan Command chosen by one of five representatives of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, each of whom had received the highest award of his service during World War II. Plans for a state funeral was to occur between May 27‚Äì30, 1950, but this was shelved because of the outbreak of the Korean War. Interest though was revived in August 1955 long after the war concluded and on August 2, 1956, the 84th United States Congress enacted Public Law 975 that authorized the burial of an unknown soldier of the Korean War in addition to the unknown soldier of World War II. The two caskets bearing the remains of the two unknown soldiers rested atop two catafalques in the Capitol rotunda. Lying in state occurred from May 28‚Äì30, 1958. A funeral procession of two horse-drawn caissons traveled from the Capitol on Constitution Avenue, 23rd Street, Arlington Memorial Bridge, and Memorial Drive to Arlington National Cemetery. As the funeral cortege reached the Memorial Gate, twenty jet fighters and bombers passed overhead with one plane missing from each formation. A funeral service was held at the Memorial Amphitheatre attended by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Vice- President Richard Nixon, and members of Congress. A burial service conducted with military rites included a three-volley salute, the playing of Taps, and the folding of flags. It is estimated that over 4,800 members of the Armed Forces participated in the state funeral of the unknown soldiers of World War II and the Korean War.Mossman and Stark, chapter 14: \\"The Unknown Soldiers of World War II and the Korean War State Funeral, 12‚Äì30 May 1958\\" A state funeral was held for General of the Army Douglas MacArthur in 1964. President John F. Kennedy had authorized a state funeral for MacArthur and President Lyndon B. Johnson confirmed Kennedy's directive. Funeral plans drawn up in 1958 called for seven days rather than four days of ceremonial events. When MacArthur died on April 5, 1964, at Walter Reed Army Hospital, his remains were transported to New York City, where he lay in repose at the Seventh Regiment Armory. Mounted city police from the New York City Police Department, soldiers from the First Army, and cadets from the United States Military Academy participated in the funeral procession on Park Avenue, 66th Street, 57th Street, Fifth Avenue, Broadway and Seventh Avenue en route to Pennsylvania Station. A funeral train transported MacArthur's remains from New York to Union Station in Washington, D.C. A funeral procession on both Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenues using a horse-drawn caisson took the General's remains to the Capitol for lying in state. Over the course of two days, April 8‚Äì9, over 150,000 people filed past MacArthur's casket in the Capitol rotunda. A third funeral procession occurred on Constitution Avenue that included a flyover of fifty Air Force planes over the column in salute as the horse-drawn caisson neared the site of the casket transfer to a hearse. MacArthur's remains were then transported to Washington National Airport and flown to Naval Station Norfolk on a Lockheed C-130 Hercules. A fourth funeral procession occurred in the streets of Norfolk, stopping at the MacArthur Memorial where lying in repose occurred in the rotunda from April 9‚Äì11. After a religious service was held at St. Paul's Episcopal Church on April 11 in Norfolk for an invited 400 guests, a fifth and final horse-drawn procession back to the MacArthur Memorial occurred. A three-volley salute, the folding of the flag, and a 19-gun salute accorded to a five-star rank of general, which MacArthur possessed, was fired before burial in a crypt.Mossman and Stark, chapter 24: \\"General of the Army Douglas MacArthur State Funeral, 5‚Äì11 April 1964\\" On August 25, 2012, Apollo 11 astronaut Neil Armstrong, the first person to walk on the moon, died after complications from coronary artery bypass surgery. Congressman Bill Johnson from Armstrong's home state of Ohio, led calls for President Barack Obama to authorize a state funeral in Washington, D.C. Throughout his lifetime, Armstrong shunned publicity and rarely gave interviews. Mindful that Armstrong would have objected to a state funeral, his family opted to have a private funeral in Cincinnati. His remains were scattered in the Atlantic Ocean during a burial-at-sea ceremony on September 14, 2012, aboard the USS Philippine Sea. Presidential places of burial The McKinley National Memorial located in Canton, Ohio, where the remains of William McKinley were interred in 1907. Many presidents have been interred in cemeteries, tombs, crypts, vaults, in the grounds at a place of residence, and inside cathedrals. Some examples include the following. The remains of George Washington were interred in a tomb at his Virginia plantation, Mount Vernon, in 1799. After falling into disrepair as well as grave robbers attempting to steal the remains of Washington, a new and more secure vault was constructed at Mount Vernon in 1831. Thomas Jefferson was interred at the Monticello Graveyard in the grounds of his Virginia plantation, Monticello, in 1826. The remains of Abraham Lincoln were exhumed and moved a total of seventeen times, the first exhumation occurring in 1865, before the ornate and lavish Lincoln Tomb was finally built for final interment in 1901 at Oak Ridge Cemetery located in Springfield, Illinois. Ulysses S. Grant, who died in 1885, was interred in Riverside Park in New York City where eventually, the construction of Grant's Tomb housing the former president's remains was finally completed and dedicated in 1897. The remains of Woodrow Wilson were interred in a sarcophagus inside Washington National Cathedral in 1924. In 1933 Calvin Coolidge was interred with minimal ceremony in the village cemetery in Plymouth Notch, Vermont, becoming the last president to be buried in a public cemetery. William Howard Taft and John F. Kennedy were interred at Arlington National Cemetery in the years 1930 and 1963 respectively. Many presidents in recent years have been interred at their presidential libraries around the nation. Examples include Ronald Reagan, whose remains are interred at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, Gerald Ford, whose remains are located at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and George H. W. Bush, whose remains are interred at the George Bush Presidential Library in College Station, Texas. Major components In the United States, a sitting president while in office will immediately issue a presidential proclamation allowing for the flag of the United States to be flown at half-staff upon the death of principal figures in the federal government, such as a former president, and others, as a mark of respect to their memory. When such a proclamation is issued, all government buildings, offices, public schools and military bases are to fly their flags at half-staff. Under federal law (4 U.S.C. ¬ß 7(f)), the flags of states, cities, localities, and pennants of societies, shall never be placed above the flag of the United States. Thus, all other flags also fly at half-staff when the flag of the United States has been ordered to fly at half- staff. Protocol dictates that flags will be flown at half-staff for a period of thirty days for a former president, beginning at the time a presidential proclamation is made effective. At the discretion of the sitting president, he will also issue an executive order which authorizes the closure of all federal departments, agencies, and buildings on a national day of mourning during a state funeral. On the day after the death of a president, a former president, or a president-elect unless the day falls on a Sunday or holiday, in which case the honor will be rendered the following day, the commanders of Army installations with the necessary personnel and material traditionally order that one gun be fired every half hour, beginning at reveille and ending at retreat. On the day of interment for a president, a 21-gun salute traditionally is fired starting at noon at all military installations with the necessary personnel and material. Guns will be fired at one-minute intervals. Also on the day of interment, those installations will fire a 50-gun salute with one round for each of the 50 U.S. states and at five-second intervals immediately following a lowering of the flag. 19-gun salutes are reserved for deputy heads of state, chiefs of staff, cabinet members, and 5-star generals. For each flag rank junior to a five-star officer, two guns are subtracted. The commanding general of the Joint Force Headquarters National Capital Region will act as a military escort for the president's family from the time of the official announcement of death until interment occurs. Two examples of this role was by Major General Galen B. Jackman who escorted former First Lady Nancy Reagan during the state funeral of Ronald Reagan in 2004 and Lieutenant General Guy C. Swan III who escorted former First Lady Betty Ford during the state funeral of Gerald Ford in 2006‚Äì07. Most state funerals include a nine- person honor guard acting as pallbearers (also known as body bearers) from all five branches of the Armed Forces, a series of gun salutes using cannons from the Presidential Salute Battery of the 3rd United States Infantry Regiment \\"The Old Guard\\", flyovers in missing man formation, various musical selections performed by military bands and choirs, a military chaplain for the immediate family, and a flag-draped casket or pall. Sitting presidents who die while in office may lie in repose in the East Room of the White House. Former presidents may lie in repose in their home or adopted state, usually at their presidential library, before traveling to Washington, D.C. when thereafter, lying in state in the United States Capitol Rotunda will occur. Dwight D. Eisenhower was an exception to this general rule. Following his death at Walter Reed Army Hospital in 1969, Eisenhower lay in repose in the Bethlehem Chapel at Washington National Cathedral for 28 hours, rather than at his presidential library in Abilene, Kansas. Funeral procession A funeral procession occurs during a state funeral on Pennsylvania or Constitution Avenue en route to the United States Capitol. Every funeral procession is led by a civilian police escort, usually by the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department. Next, the formal, ceremonial aspects of a procession are organized. A funeral procession uses a four-wheeled caisson to transport the flag-draped casket, which was originally intended to carry a 75 mm cannon when it was built in 1918. The caisson is drawn by a draft-mix of 6 same-colored horses with three riders and a section chief mounted on a separate horse from the United States Army Caisson Platoon of the 3rd United States Infantry Regiment \\"The Old Guard\\". In addition, 2 sets of four body bearers (8 total) will march on foot alongside both sides of the caisson transporting the flag- draped casket. The entire funeral procession is composed of three march units consisting of National Guard, reserve, active-duty, and academy personnel that represent the five branches of the United States Armed Forces. Moving at 3 miles per hour, the funeral procession begins in sight of the White House and travels to the United States Capitol. For former presidents, the casket is unloaded from a hearse and transferred to a caisson at 16th Street and Constitution Avenue in view of the South Lawn. The funeral procession then proceeds down Constitution Avenue. For sitting presidents, the casket is transferred at the North Portico entrance of the White House. Thereafter, the funeral procession proceeds down Pennsylvania Avenue. Two exceptions for this funeral procession were made during the state funerals of Gerald Ford on December 30, 2006, and George H. W. Bush on December 3, 2018. Respecting Ford's and Bush‚Äôs personal wishes of not having a funeral procession using a horse-drawn caisson, their caskets were transported in hearses to the United States Capitol. For Ford, the procession stopped at the National World War II Memorial in order to pay tribute to his service in the United States Navy during World War II. Each of the three march units are led by a military band. Positioned directly in front of the caisson, three color guards will march on foot, with the center color guard having responsibility for trooping the national colors, the flag of the United States. Following immediately behind the caisson, a single color guard will march on foot trooping the presidential standard, the flag of the President of the United States. The riderless horse named \\"Sergeant York\\", during the funeral procession on June 9, 2004, for Ronald Reagan, with a ceremonial sword attached to the saddle and a pair of the president's boots reversed in the stirrups. Next, a single honor guard will march on foot holding the reins of a caparisoned, riderless horse with a set of boots reversed in the stirrups, symbolizing a fallen warrior who will never ride again which also betokens the commander's parting look on his troops, who march behind. The equipment mounted on the caparisoned, riderless horse varies according to color of the horse. If black, a saddle blanket, saddle, and bridle are mounted on the horse. If any other color, the horse carries a folded hood and cape, along with a blanket, saddle and bridle. For presidential state funerals, the Presidential Seal is emblazoned on the blanket, four inches from the bottom. The inclusion of a riderless horse in a funeral procession dates back to the death of George Washington in 1799 when a caparisoned, riderless horse carried Washington's saddle, holsters, and pistol during the president's funeral. In 1865, Abraham Lincoln was honored by the inclusion of a riderless horse at his state funeral. When Lincoln's funeral train reached Springfield, Illinois, his horse \\"Old Bob\\", who was draped in a black mourning blanket, followed the funeral procession and led mourners to the president's burial plot. The most famous riderless horse was \\"Black Jack\\" who was foaled January 19, 1947, and was the last of the Quartermaster-issue horses branded with the Army's \\"US\\" brand. He was named after General of the Armies John J. \\"Black Jack\\" Pershing. He participated in the state funerals of John F. Kennedy, Herbert Hoover, and Lyndon B. Johnson, as well as the state funeral of General of the Army Douglas MacArthur. The deceased president's family, who are accompanied by federal government officials, will follow behind the funeral procession in a presidential motorcade. During the funeral procession midway between the White House and the Capitol as the caisson passes through the intersection of Constitution Avenue and 4th Street, N.W., a flyover consisting of 21 tactical fighter aircraft from the United States Air Force, will fly in formation as a single lead aircraft followed by 5 flights of four aircraft each. The #3 aircraft in the final flight executes the maneuver of missing man low enough to be clearly seen by on-looking spectators below. The funeral procession traditionally ends at the center steps on the east front of the Capitol. Exceptions were made for Lyndon B. Johnson, Ronald Reagan, and Gerald Ford. Johnson's casket was carried up the Senate wing steps because the center steps were blocked with construction scaffolding from the second inauguration of Richard Nixon which occurred just days earlier. As a break with tradition, Reagan, as former Governor of California, requested that his casket be carried up the steps of the Capitol's West Front facing California. Ford, as a former member of the United States House of Representatives, requested that his casket be carried up the House wing steps. Funeral processions on Pennsylvania Avenue Military units seen marching down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., during the state funeral for Abraham Lincoln on April 19, 1865. Pennsylvania Avenue has been used for eight presidential funeral processions, including the four who died by assassination. In 1841, William Henry Harrison was escorted up the avenue by twenty-six pallbearers, one for each of the twenty-six U.S. states in the Union. On July 13, 1850, the funeral procession for Zachary Taylor on Pennsylvania Avenue stretched for over two miles. On April 19, 1865, a cortege numbering an unprecedented 30,000 people escorted the remains of Abraham Lincoln on the avenue from the White House to the Capitol. In 1881, the body of James A. Garfield was escorted on Pennsylvania Avenue by the new president, Chester A. Arthur, and ex-President Ulysses S. Grant. Returned to Washington D.C. ten days earlier by a funeral train, the remains of William McKinley were escorted on the rain-dampened avenue from the White House to the Capitol on September 17, 1901. Carriages bearing the new president, Theodore Roosevelt, and ex-President Grover Cleveland, preceded the marchers. On August 8, 1923, Warren G. Harding was honored by a cavalry escort led by General John J. Pershing during the president's funeral procession on the avenue to the Capitol. Perhaps one of the most poignant funeral processions in the 20th century occurred on November 24, 1963, for John F. Kennedy. Televised worldwide, the slain president's casket rode on the same caisson that had borne Franklin D. Roosevelt's body on Constitution Avenue eighteen years earlier, making Roosevelt the only president to die in office whose funeral procession did not take place on Pennsylvania Avenue. After Lyndon B. Johnson died in 1973, his funeral procession went down Pennsylvania Avenue, but from the Capitol, as it was on the way to National City Christian Church, as the funeral services were held there on January 25. The nation has also honored other people with a funeral procession on Pennsylvania Avenue. They include Vice-President George Clinton in 1812; Presidents John Quincy Adams in 1848 (serving as a member of Congress in the House of Representatives) and William Howard Taft in 1930 (serving as Chief Justice of the United States until just one month before his death); Generals Jacob Brown in 1828, Alexander Macomb in 1841 and Philip Sheridan in 1888; Admiral George Dewey in 1917; and Ambassador Adlai Stevenson in 1965. On March 2, 1844, Secretary of State Abel Upshur and Secretary of the Navy Thomas Walker Gilmer, as well as three other victims of the 1844 gun explosion disaster aboard the , were all honored with a funeral procession led by Zachary Taylor on Pennsylvania Avenue. The nation also honored the Unknown Soldier of World War I with a funeral procession on the avenue on November 11, 1921. President Harding, General Pershing, and Chief Justice Taft all walked on foot behind the caisson while ailing ex-President Woodrow Wilson rode in a horse-drawn carriage, which was followed by the entire Congress. Capitol rotunda service and lying in state Shortly after the casket is moved onto the floor of the Capitol rotunda and placed on top of the Lincoln Catafalque, members of the United States Congress gather to pay tribute. A program which includes eulogies, a benediction, prayers, and the laying of floral wreaths will be conducted. Afterward, the president's remains lie in state or an honoree's remains lie in honor for public viewing. Although lying in state continues for a period of at least 24 hours, it differs from lying in honor. Five honor guards, each representing a branch of the Armed Forces, will face the flag-draped casket while holding their rifles with their right hand and keeping the rifle butt resting on the floor. These honor guards will periodically rotate in order to relieve previous honor guards during their constant vigil over the casket. A mass public viewing is permitted during the lying in state until one hour before the next departure ceremony begins. Religious service Over 2,100 people attended the Episcopal funeral service for Dwight D. Eisenhower at Washington National Cathedral on March 31, 1969. A national funeral service, with a religious theme, is traditionally held at Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., or at another church, depending on the president's religious faith. Funeral services for Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford, and George H.W. Bush were held at the Cathedral. William Howard Taft had his funeral at All Souls' Church, Unitarian, where he was a congregant. John F. Kennedy's requiem mass was held at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle, as he was a Roman Catholic. A funeral service was held for Lyndon B. Johnson at National City Christian Church, as he worshipped there often while president. Various foreign dignitaries, heads of state, royalty, and government officials attend. On the matter of seating arrangements, the family of the deceased is immediately followed by federal government officials, and then by foreign heads of state who are arranged alphabetically by the English spelling of the countries in which they represent. Royalty representing heads of state, such as princes and dukes, come next, followed by foreign heads of government, such as prime ministers and premiers. During the funeral service, military top brass sit in the north transept and extended family members sit in the south transept, if the funeral service is held at Washington National Cathedral. The length of these religious services has varied. More recent ones have tended to include multiple eulogies and thus have been longer. Eisenhower's was roughly thirty minutes. Bush's was slightly over two hours. The EMD SD70ACe locomotive known as Union Pacific 4141 used to transport the remains of George H. W. Bush on a funeral train from Spring, Texas, to his presidential library in College Station for interment on December 6, 2018. Immediately after the national funeral service is completed, the casket travels to its final resting place for interment. Before the mid-20th century, the casket was moved long distances across the nation by a funeral train procession, where thousands of mourners would line the railroad tracks to pay homage. VIP transport in recent decades between the deceased president's home state and Washington, D.C. has been aboard one of the two Boeing VC-25 jets (tail codes SAM 28000 and SAM 29000) in the presidential fleet which are operated by the 89th Airlift Wing at Joint Base Andrews. As protocol dictates, any deceased president whose remains are flown on an Air Force jet are not entitled to use the call sign Air Force One since this call sign is exclusively reserved for any aircraft in the Air Force with a sitting and living president aboard. The departure and arrival ceremonies held at Joint Base Andrews as well as at the final destination of interment are met with honor guards, a military band, and a 21-gun salute as the casket is loaded on and unloaded off the aft section of a Boeing VC-25. Because of air transportation in the modern era, it has now become possible for a funeral service and interment to be completed within the same day, as seen during the state funerals of Lyndon B. Johnson in January 1973, Ronald Reagan in June 2004, and Gerald Ford In December 2006 ‚Äì January 2007. However, there were two notable exceptions for Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1969 and George H. W. Bush in 2018. Instead of using a Boeing VC-137C jet (tail code SAM 26000) which at the time typically served the role as Air Force One, a funeral train was used to carry and transport Eisenhower‚Äôs casket. Departing from Union Station in Washington, D.C., on March 31, 1969, Eisenhower's funeral train arrived in his hometown of Abilene, Kansas, on April 2, 1969. Interment inside the 'Place of Meditation' located on the grounds of the Eisenhower Presidential Library occurred later that day. Although Bush‚Äôs casket was flown back to Texas from Washington using a Boeing VC-25 on December 5, 2018, his remains were transported on December 6, 2018, for interment at the George Bush Presidential Library in College Station using a funeral train that was powered by a specially painted EMD SD70ACe locomotive known as Union Pacific 4141. Interment Keith Clark to perform ‚Äò‚ÄôTaps‚Äô‚Äô during John F. Kennedy‚Äôs interment at Arlington National Cemetery on November 25, 1963. More reminiscent of a military funeral during interment, presidents are automatically accorded full military honors in recognition of their role as Commander-in-Chief of the United States Armed Forces. A three-volley salute is fired over the gravesite by seven members who form a rifle party. This however, does not constitute a 21-gun salute. Taps, a bugle call sounded over the grave dating from the era of the American Civil War is performed by one lone bugler from the United States Marine Band, thirty to fifty yards away. Immediately thereafter, the United States Marine Band will perform William Whiting's Eternal Father, Strong to Save as the \\"Final Salute\\" is given. During interment, fighter aircraft provided by the United States Air Force will perform a second and final aerial flyover in missing man formation, as would be previously observed during a ceremonial procession on Constitution Avenue in Washington, D.C. Flag folding and presentation Eight guards of honor prepare to fold the U.S. flag over President John F. Kennedy's casket at Arlington National Cemetery on November 25, 1963. A final component of a state funeral, as is typically offered during military funerals for fallen veterans, is the folding of the flag of the United States and its presentation to the next of kin. The flag draped over the casket is meticulously folded twelve times by a total of eight honor guards, four on each side of the casket. Next, an honor guard representing one of the five branches of the Armed Forces will present the flag to the next of kin by kneeling in front of the recipient, holding the folded flag waist high with the straight edge facing the recipient, while leaning toward the recipient. Until 2012, depending on the service of the selected honor guard chosen to present the flag to the next of kin, each of the five military branches used slightly different wording  Music  Members of the United States Marine Band participated in Ronald Reagan's funeral procession to the Capitol on June 9, 2004. The premier military bands from the five branches of the Armed Forces have an approved musical repertoire that they perform while marching on Pennsylvania or Constitution Avenue. The use of muffled drums and bagpipes are common as well. Military musical honors such as the presidential fanfare Hail to the Chief, the bugle call Taps, and Ruffles and flourishes, are performed by military bands as a mark of respect. During the state funeral of John F. Kennedy in 1963, as an example, the United States Marine Band performed Holy, Holy, Holy by Reginald Heber, Our Fallen Heroes, and The Vanished Army after clearing the Capitol Plaza and joining military units for the 35-minute march on Constitution Avenue to the White House. The United States Navy Band selected Symphony No. 3 \\"The Funeral March\\" by Ludwig Van Beethoven, The Funeral March by Robert Browne Hall, and the hymn Onward, Christian Soldiers by Arthur Sullivan. The United States Air Force Band chose to perform Piano Sonata No. 2 \\"The Funeral March\\", by Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, the hymn Vigor in Arduis (also known as Hymn to the Holy Name), and America the Beautiful by Samuel A. Ward. During the funeral procession from the White House to the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle, Kennedy was honored by nine bagpipers from the Black Watch, an infantry battalion of the Royal Regiment of Scotland, who traveled from the United Kingdom to participate in the state funeral. They performed The Brown Haired Maiden, The Badge of Scotland, The 51st Highland Division, and The Barren Rocks of Aden. During a national funeral service, such as those held at Washington National Cathedral, the Cathedral Choir or the Armed Forces Choir will sing a selection of religious and patriotic music. In 1969, Dwight D. Eisenhower's state funeral included a religious service at the Cathedral that incorporated music such as Schmucke dich, o liebe Seele by Johann Sebastian Bach and O Welt, ich muss dich lassen by Johannes Brahms. During the state funeral of Ronald Reagan in 2004, Joyful, Joyful We Adore Thee by Ludwig van Beethoven and Mansions of the Lord by Nick Glennie-Smith were performed in the Cathedral. The state funeral of Gerald Ford in 2006‚Äì07 included music such as O God, Our Help in Ages Past by William Croft, Eternal Father, Strong to Save (also known as The Navy Hymn), and Fanfare for the Common Man by Aaron Copland. In 2018, the state funeral of George H. W. Bush included the hymns The King of Love My Shepherd Is by Henry Williams Baker, My House Shall Be Called a House of Prayer by Douglas Major, Eternal Father, Strong to Save, and Croft‚Äôs O God, Our Help in Ages Past. During John F. Kennedy's Requiem Mass at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in 1963, the St. Matthew's Choir sang Subvenite and Sanctus and Benedictus. Tenor soloist Luigi Vena sang Pie Jesu by Ignace Leybach, Ave Maria by Franz Schubert, and In Manus Tuus by Vincent Novello. The organist and choirmaster was Eugene Stewart. Solo musicians who are globally acclaimed have also performed during a funeral service, a recent example being Irish tenor Ronan Tynan who at the request of First Lady Nancy Reagan, sang Amazing Grace at Washington National Cathedral during the Reagan state funeral in 2004. During the Ford state funeral in 2007, renowned Metropolitan Opera singer Denyce Graves sangThe Lord‚Äôs Prayer by Albert Hay Malotte at the Cathedral during the homily. In 2018, Irish tenor Ronan Tynan was invited again to the Cathedral to sing during the Bush state funeral. His musical selections included Malotte‚Äôs The Lord‚Äôs Prayer and Last Full Measure of Devotion by Larry Grossman. In addition, Christian contemporary soloist Michael W. Smith sang Friends, a piece of music attributed to him. Other venues, such as National City Christian Church invited American soprano Leontyne Price to sing Take My Hand, Precious Lord during Lyndon B. Johnson's state funeral in 1973.Woods, Randall. LBJ: Architect of American Ambition (2006), Simon and Schuster, page 884 ‚Äì List of lying in state and honor recipients Since the death of Henry Clay in 1852, the United States Capitol rotunda has served as the venue for honoring thirty-two military officers and politicians, including twelve presidents, with a lying in state. Not all who lie in state nor all for whom flags are flown at half-staff, receive a state funeral. A distinction is made between recipients who are permitted to lie in state and those who lie in honor. Incumbent and past government officials whose remains are placed in the rotunda for view by the public to pay their respects will lie in state. Individuals other than members of the government will lie in honor. The rotunda has been used three times for four individuals who have lain in honor, the first in 1998 for the two victims of the Capitol shooting incident, in 2005 for civil rights activist Rosa Parks, and in 2018 for evangelist and minister Billy Graham. When lying in state, five guards of honor, each representing the five branches of the Armed Forces, will periodically rotate and relieve the preceding set of guards of honor who watch over the remains. For recipients who have been designated to lie in honor, the United States Capitol Police will act as guards of honor. No law, written rule, or regulation specifies who may lie in state. Use of the Capitol rotunda is controlled by a concurrent resolution of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Any person who has rendered distinguished service to the nation may lie in state if the family so wishes and the United States Congress approves. In the case of unknown soldiers, the president or the appropriate branch of the Armed Forces initiates the action.

Eisenhower in the United States Capitol rotunda on March 30‚Äì31, 1969, that was photographed from the Capitol's dome. Since state funerals in the United States are elaborate affairs which are in themselves rare occurrences, they are planned years in advance. Each president living, sitting or former, is generally expected to have funeral plans in place on becoming president. However, these details become more important after a president leaves office, and serves to reduce stress for the president's family in an era of worldwide media scrutiny. The Military District of Washington (MDW) has primary responsibility in overseeing state funerals and in all cases, must strictly follow the outline of a 138-page planning document. Detailed funeral arrangements have emerged for Jimmy Carter: a 411-page document outlining a state funeral for Carter has been filed with the Military District of Washington, including a national funeral service at National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., and a public viewing of the former president's remains at the Carter Center in Atlanta, Georgia. Carter has stated that his final interment and burial will be in the front yard of his family's residence, which is now a component of the Jimmy Carter National Historic Site in Plains, Georgia. Neither Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, or Donald Trump have revealed full information regarding their funeral plans, but Bush does have a burial plot in the Texas State Cemetery in Austin (which he is entitled to as a former Governor of Texas), while Trump had previously stated as early as 2014 that he wished to be buried in a newly constructed family cemetery in Bedminster, New Jersey, overlooking the Trump National Golf Club.

After arriving in Argentina at the age of seventeen, he acquired many ranches and eventually founded Santamarina and Sons, which is one of the major cattle companies of Argentina nowadays. His descendants played a significant role in the economy and politics of Argentina. Ramon Santamarina, his first son became president of the National Bank of Argentina, while his other son Enrique became vice president of Argentina in 1930.  Family  Ramon Santamarina was born on February 25th, 1827 in Ourense, Spain. His parents were members of noble families of Galicia. His father Jose was the captain of the civil Royal Guard of Ferdinand VII of Spain. He spent most of his childhood in Orense, until his father was transferred in A Coru√±a in 1835. His father had lost most of the family's fortune. While being in A Coru√±a, Jose Santamarina due to his large economic problems committed suicide in front of Ramon. After the death of his mother, he lived with his uncle Ramon de Francisco until 1844, when he emigrated to Argentina. After giving birth to four children his first wife, Ana Alduncin, died in 1866. After many years he married Anne Irazustra, with whom he had thirteen children. Ramon Santamarina committed suicide on August 23, 1904. His funeral was attended by many important individuals of Buenos Aires.  Career  On August 20, 1844 Santamarina arrived in Argentina. At first he worked at an inn called Inn of the Four Nations, and afterwards at a local ranch. In 1845 he settled Tandil, where he worked in the ranch San Ciriaco, owned by Ramon Gomez. After earning enough money he started a small goods transport business, which evolved rapidly. From 1845 until 1883, when a railroad station was built in Tandil, Santamarina was the main supplier of the city. Tandil became the center of his businesses. During that period he bought 20,700 cattle, and six warehouses and banks. Santamarina enlarged his fortune during the Crimean War due to the export of leather by his business. In 1896 Christian IX of Denmark awarded Santamarina the Knight Order of the Dannebrog, because of his efforts for the settlement of Danish emigrants in Buenos Aires.  Santamarina & Sons  On July 1, 1890 Santamarina established the Santamarina & Sons company. The firm is devoted to various branches of economy, among which are rural and urban government establishments, industrial, banking businesses, and fruit transport. Among its facilities are: Bella Vista, La Colina, La Elvira, Energy, La Fortuna, La Gloria, La Providencia, La Totora, Will, the Roses, Las Gaviotas, Los Angeles, Los Gauchos, Meriland, Ramon R, San Alberto, San Jose and San Ramon, San Pedro, Santa Elena and Sarah, among others. All these establishments are scattered throughout the provinces of Buenos Aires, Santa Fe and Santiago del Estero. Nowadays, the company is headed by Marcelo de Alzaga, grandson of Jorge Alejandro Santamarina, and directed by Carlos Fernando Santamarina and Jos√© Ram√≥n Santamarina, all of which are fourth generation descendants of Ramon Santamarina.  Legacy  Monument of Ramon Santamarina in Tandil. The college of San Jose in Tandil was built to honor Ramon Santamarina, while the city's hospital was named after him on March 10, 1912. In Tandil stands a monument created by the sculpto Miguel Bay. In the province of Buenos Aires in Argentina, a town was named after his birthplace Orense.

It was discovered in August 2009 in the Tunnel de la Atlantida, the world's longest submarine lava tube on Lanzarote in the Canary Islands off the west coast of North Africa. Like other remipedes, the species is equipped with venomous fangs. Description Speleonectes atlantida is approximately long. Like most other remipedes, the species lacks eyes and is hermaphroditic. Adapted to life in caves, the long antennae sprouting from its head and the presence of sensory hairs along its body allow the crustacean to feel its way along the dark tunnel. The species is equipped with venom-injecting fangs, a feature unique to class Remipedia among crustaceans. Discovery During a cave diving expedition to explore the Tunnel de la Atlantida, the world's longest known submarine lava tube on Lanzarote in the Canary Islands, an international team of scientists and cave divers discovered the previously unknown species of crustacean, belonging to the remipede genus Speleonectes, along with two new species of annelid worms of the class Polychaeta. The species was named after the tunnel it was found in. It is morphologically very similar to Speleonectes ondinae, a remipede that has been known from the same lava tube since 1985, but DNA comparison studies proved that it is a second species. The divergence of the two species may have occurred after the formation of the lava tube during an eruption of the Monte Corona volcano some 20,000 years ago.

Election setup At the time of the election, South Ossetia's parliament had 34 seats. Of these, 15 were filled using the party-list proportional representation, 15 were filled using Single-member district plurality voting, and another 4 were vacant seats, designated for representatives from villages then under Georgian control, where elections were impossible to hold. This election was the last time this system was used, as in the 2009 election, all 34 seats were filled using party-list proportional representation. Election day As of 13:00 local time, 52% of registered voters had cast their votes, crossing the electoral threshold of 50% plus one vote. The South Ossetian election commission has thus declared the elections valid. Results The election was won by President of South Ossetia Eduard Kokoity's Unity Party, which got 9 of the 15 party-list seats (54.6% of all votes), as well as another 11 constituency seats, giving the party a controlling 20-seat majority. Znaur Gassiyev of the Unity Party was elected speaker, replacing Stanislav Kochiev of the Communist Party of South Ossetia. Gassiyev was one of the leaders of the Republic of South Ossetia in its forming days in the early 1990s, and acted as Head of State in 1991.

Herndon (DE-688) on 12 June 1944 by the Bethlehem Steel Company at Quincy, Massachusetts, and was launched on 15 July 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Raymon W. Herndon, the widow of the ships namesake, Raymon W. Herndon. Raymon W. Herndon was reclassified as a and redesignated APD-121 on 17 July 1944. After conversion for her new role, she was commissioned on 3 November 1944.  Service history   World War II  Raymon W. Herndon departed Boston, Massachusetts, on 23 November 1944 for three weeks of shakedown off Bermuda. After arriving at Norfolk, Virginia, on 13 December 1944, she stood out of Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 1 January 1945, transited the Panama Canal, and reported to the United States Pacific Fleet for World War II duty on 7 January 1945. Arriving at San Diego, California, on 16 January 1945, she departed on 25 January 1945, touched at Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, on 31 January 1945, and acquired her first combat experience at Okinawa. Commencing 26 March 1945, Raymon W. Herndon supported her embarked Underwater Demolition Team 16 and provided antiaircraft gunnery support in the transport area off the invasion beaches. During the assault phase of the Okinawa operation, she assisted in maintaining an outer antisubmarine screen that extended completely around the Hagushi Beach transport area and the seaplane and logistics anchorage at Kerama Retto. Together with the other ships of the screen, she also provided protection from Japanese aircraft for the naval forces off the beachhead. Later she patrolled remote radar picket stations and bore the brunt of the relentless and determined attacks made by Japanese torpedo bombers, dive bombers, and kamikaze aircraft. She shot down one attacking aircraft and assisted in the destruction of two others on 6 April 1945. Raymon W. Herndon supported the Okinawa campaign through 19 June 1945, only two days before Okinawa was finally declared secured. Postwar After the surrender of Japan on 15 August 1945, which brought World War II to a close, Raymon W. Herndon transported occupation forces to the coast of China and to ports in Japan. She was then directed to return to the United States. After her return, Raymon W. Herndon moved to Green Cove Springs, Florida, for inactivation. Decommissioning and disposal Raymon W. Herndon was decommissioned on 15 November 1946 at Green Cove Springs and joined the Atlantic Reserve Fleet there. After nearly 20 years of inactivity, she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 September 1966. Honors and awards Raymon W. Herndon received one battle star for World War II service. Republic of China Navy service In October 1966, Raymon W. Herndon was sold to the Republic of China under the Military Assistance Program.

His themes express an appreciation for natural beauty, including the human figure, and its integration within the natural landscape. Larsen seeks to create artworks that incorporate conservation-minded construction, materials, and techniques. About his work, Larsen has said, \\"... I am interested in continuing to portray themes of beauty, achievement, innovation, and aspiration, but more recently with an emphasis on narrative and an optimistic view of the future. To that end, I like to focus on subjects that incorporate these themes and are also suggestive of a not-too-distant future, and that portray a positive perspective. My goal is not to paint science fiction, but to express what I find important, beautiful, and inspirational about the world, the universe, and human kind‚Äôs place in it from a point of view in the future.\\" Larsen's works also feature children and their capacity to imagine the future as an amazing and beautiful place in a sincere way. On this topic, Larsen says, \\"Children and their aspirations are favorite subjects of mine.

He served as Bishop of Amarillo (1958‚Äì1963) and Bishop of Galveston-Houston (1975‚Äì1984). Early life and education The seventh of ten children, John Morkovsky was born in Praha, Texas, to Alois and Marie (n√©e Raska) Morkovsky. His father came directly to the United States from Moravia, while his mother was the daughter of Moravian immigrants. He was baptized by Rev. Louis P. Netardus at his parents' home. He attended St. John's Seminary in San Antonio from 1924 until 1930, when he was sent to further his studies in Rome at the College of the Propaganda and the Pontifical Gregorian University. Priesthood While in Rome, Morkovsky was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Francesco Marchetti Selvaggiani on December 5, 1933. He later earned his doctorate in theology in 1936. Upon his return to Texas in 1936, Morkovsky served as a curate at St. Michael's Church in Weimar until 1939. He was a curate at St. Anne's Church in San Antonio from 1939 to 1940, and a professor of canon law, Latin and philosophy at St. John's Seminary from 1940 to 1941. He briefly served as pastor of St. Francis de Paula Church and superintendent of Catholic schools in San Antonio. From 1941 to 1943, Morkovsky attended the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., from where he obtained a Master of Arts degree in education. He then resumed his duties as superintendent in San Antonio, in which capacity he remained until 1956. During that time, he also served as judge of the archdiocesan matrimonial court (1944‚Äì56), pastor of St. Leo's Church in San Antonio (1945‚Äì54), archdiocesan consultor (1947‚Äì56), and pastor of St. Mary Magdalene's Church in San Antonio (1954‚Äì56). He was also moderator of the San Antonio Deanery Council of Catholic Women and director of the Legion of Decency, and organized the Federation of Catholic Parents' and Teachers' Clubs in San Antonio. Episcopal ministry Amarillo On December 22, 1955, Morkovsky was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Amarillo and Titular Bishop of Hieron by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on February 22, 1956 from Archbishop Amleto Giovanni Cicognani, with Bishops Mariano Simon Garriga and Sidney Matthew Metzger serving as co-consecrators. In addition to his duties as auxiliary bishop, he also served as chancellor and vicar general of the Diocese of Amarillo. Less than two months before his death, Pius XII named Morkovsky the fourth Bishop of Amarillo on August 18, 1958. He remained in Amarillo as the spiritual leader of Catholics in the Texas Panhandle for four years. Galveston-Houston On April 16, 1963, Morkovsky was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Galveston-Houston and Titular Bishop of Tigava by the ailing Pope John XXIII. He became Apostolic Administrator of the diocese under Bishop Wendelin Joseph Nold, who suffered from near total blindness. He also attended the Second Vatican Council from 1962 to 1965. In 1964 he founded the diocesan newspaper The Texas Catholic Herald and hosted the visit of Cardinal Josef Beran. He established the first diocesan mission in Guatemala City in 1966, and the Hospital Chaplains Corps at Houston Medical Center in 1968. From 1970 to 1972, he was the first Catholic bishop to preside over the Texas Conference of Churches. Morkovsky later succeeded Nold as the sixth Bishop of Galveston-Houston on April 22, 1975. During his tenure, he established African American and Mexican American ministries and gave special attention to low- income parishioners and Houston's large Vietnamese community. The Catholic Church in Texas continued to experience tremendous growth which led to further divisions of the diocese, including the Diocese of Beaumont (1966), Victoria (1982), and Tyler (1987). Later life and death After nine years as diocesan bishop, Morkovsky resigned on August 21, 1984. He continued to live in his home on the grounds of St. Mary's Seminary in Houston. At age 80, he died from a stroke in Tacoma, Washington, where he was visiting relatives. He is buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Houston.

It is largely obsolete for its original purpose, as dedicated dial-up PPP connections and broadband Internet access have in turn become widely available and inexpensive. It remains useful for connecting mobile devices, such as PDAs, via their serial ports. Another significant current use-case is firewall piercing/port forwarding,Rideau, Fran√ßois-Ren√© (2001), Firewall Piercing mini- HOWTO, Secure solution: piercing using sshJDIMSON (2008), pppsshslirp: create a PPP session through SSH to a remote machine to which you don't have root which is typically but not necessarily done by way of an SSH connection on which port forwarding is restricted.  Usage  Shell accounts normally only allow the use of command line or text-based software, but by logging into a shell account and running Slirp on the remote server, a user can transform their shell account into a SLIP/PPP connection, allowing them to run any TCP/IP-based application‚Äîincluding standard GUI software such as the formerly popular Netscape Navigator‚Äîon their computer. This was especially useful in the 1990s because simple shell accounts were less expensive and/or more widely available than full SLIP/PPP accounts. In the mid-1990s, numerous universities provided dial-up shell accounts (to their faculty, staff, and students). These command line-only connections became more versatile with SLIP/PPP, enabling the use of arbitrary TCP/IP-based applications. Many guides to using university dial-up connections with Slirp were published online (e.g. , , , ). Use of TCP/IP emulations software like Slirp, and its commercial competitor TIA was banned by some shell account providers, who believed its users violated their terms of service or consumed too much bandwidth. Slirp is also useful for connecting PDAs and other mobile devices to the Internet: by connecting such a device to a computer running Slirp, via a serial cable or USB, the mobile device can connect to the Internet.  Limitations  Unlike a true SLIP/PPP connection, provided by a dedicated server, a Slirp connection does not strictly obey the principle of end-to-end connectivity envisioned by the Internet protocol suite. The remote end of the connection, running on the shell account, cannot allocate a new IP address and route traffic to it. Thus the local computer cannot accept arbitrary incoming connections, although Slirp can use port forwarding to accept incoming traffic for specific ports. This limitation is similar to that of network address translation. It does provide enhanced security as a side effect, effectively acting as a firewall between the local computer and the Internet.  Current status  Slirp is free software licensed under a BSD-like, modified 4-clause BSD license by its original author. After the original author stopped maintaining it, Kelly Price took over as maintainer. However, there have been no releases since 2006. Debian maintainers have taken over some maintenance tasks, such as modifying Slirp to work correctly on 64-bit computers.  Influence on other projects  Despite being largely obsolete, Slirp made a great influence on the networking stacks used in virtual machines and other virtualized environments. The established practice of connecting the virtual machines to the host's network stack was to use the various packet injection mechanisms. Raw sockets, being one of such mechanisms, were originally used for that purpose, and, due to many problems and limitations, were later replaced with the TAP device. Packet injection is a privileged operation that may introduce a security threat, something that the introduction of TAP device solved only partially. Slirp- derived NAT implementation brought a solution to this long-standing problem. It was discovered that Slirp has the full NAPT implementation as a stand-alone user-space code, whereas other NAT engines are usually embedded into a network protocol stack and/or do not cooperate with the host OS when doing PAT (use their own port ranges and require packet injection). QEMU project have adopted the appropriate code portions of the Slirp package and got the permission from its original authors to re-license it under 3-clause BSD license. Such license change allowed many other FOSS projects to adopt the QEMU-provided Slirp portions, which was (and still is) not possible with the original Slirp codebase because of the license compatibility problems. Some of the notable adopters are VDE and VirtualBox projects. Even though the Slirp-derived code was heavily criticized, to date there is no competing implementation available.

It is named after Kensington Palace in London, where they resided prior to Queen Victoria's accession to the throne. Application The System was aimed at rendering the young Princess Victoria weak and dependent, and thus unlikely to adhere to her other relatives in the House of Hanover against her mother and Conroy. Young Victoria was never allowed to be apart from either her mother, her tutor, or her governesses, Baroness Lehzen and the Duchess of Northumberland. She was kept isolated from other children; her mother and Conroy strictly monitored and recorded her every action and entirely controlled whom she was allowed to meet. Victoria had only two playmates during her adolescence: her half-sister, Princess Feodora of Leiningen, and Conroy's daughter, Victoire. Only occasional trips were made outside the palace grounds; two visits to Claremont to see her uncle Leopold I of Belgium greatly influenced Victoria's opinion on the system., Williams, Kate. Becoming Queen Victoria: The Tragic Death of Princess Charlotte and the Unexpected Rise of Britain's Greatest Monarch. New York: Ballantine, 2010. Print. When it became clear that Victoria would inherit the throne, they tried to induce Victoria to appoint Conroy her personal secretary and treasurer via a long series of threats and browbeating, to no avail. Daily routine The Duchess of Kent instituted a strict daily schedule for Victoria's education. Morning lessons began at 9:30 sharp with a break at 11:30. Lessons would resume for the afternoon at 3:00 and would last until 5:00. Education Victoria's education began at the age of five. Her first teacher, Reverend George Davys, Dean of Chester, instructed her on scripture. The Duchess of Kent would personally drill her daughter after each lesson. At eight years old, Victoria began learning decorum, reading, and writing from Baroness Lehzen. She studied Greek, Latin, Italian, French, and German, which she later used to converse with Prince Albert when they began their courtship in 1839. Endorsement The system was endorsed by Queen Victoria's half- brother, Carl, 3rd Prince of Leiningen, who supported his mother's ambitions for a regency. In 1841, after Victoria became Queen and made her displeasure with the Kensington System known, Carl attempted to justify it in his book A Complete History of the Policy Followed at Kensington, Under Sir John Conroy's Guidance. Victoria's response The Kensington System was an utter failure and backfired spectacularly: Victoria grew to hate her mother, Conroy, and her mother's lady-in-waiting, Lady Flora Hastings, over the system. Her first two requests, upon her accession, were that she should be allowed an hour by herself (which the Kensington System had never permitted), and that her bed should be removed from her mother's room (which presaged the cessation of her mother's influence, and, through her mother, that of Conroy). Among Victoria's first acts upon her accession to the throne at the age of 18 was to ban Conroy from her apartments permanently. After a brief engagement, Victoria married Prince Albert in 1840, and thus was no longer conventionally required to live with her mother. At the conclusion of her wedding ceremony, she only shook hands with the Duchess. She soon thereafter evicted her mother from the palace and rarely visited her, remaining cold and distant from her until the birth of her first child.

Early life Grass was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to Jewish parents, Louis and Rose Grass. His father, a businessman whom Grass described in 2002 as \\"relatively successful\\", died during the Great Depression when Grass was 9 years old, leaving the family with little income. Grass' family relocated from Scranton to Miami Beach, Florida in 1936 after his father's death. Grass worked a number of small jobs while living in Florida. He eventually obtained a law degree from the University of Florida Law School in 1949 using the G.I. Bill. He met his wife, Lois Lehrman, while in Florida and the couple married six months later. Rite Aid Grass moved back to Pennsylvania to pursue a legal career in tax law with the Internal Revenue Service and other government agencies. He took a position with the Pennsylvania state Department of Revenue. Grass became a businessman during the early 1950s partially due to his marriage into his wife's Harrisburg, Pennsylvania based Lehrman family. He began working for his father-in-law's, Lehrman & Sons, wholesale grocery distribution company along with his brother- in-law Lewis Lehrman in 1951. Grass saw several opportunities for retail opportunities in the 1960s. While working for the distribution company, Grass noticed that there seemed to be a lack of competitively priced health and beauty stores in Pennsylvania. More importantly, in the early 1960s the United States Supreme Court citing the Robinson‚ÄìPatman Act that manufacturers could not dictate minimum prices for retailers. Grass suddenly saw an opportunity in the retail sector, thanks to the Supreme Court ruling and lack of competing drugstores. He decided to open a store in downtown Scranton, which he called the Thrif D Discount Center, in 1962. The store would be the first of the chain which would become Rite Aid. The first store in Scranton, which was only wide and deep, became an immediate success in the city. He quickly expanded the store, opening other locations in Wilkes-Barre, Hazleton and Lancaster, as well as a second location in Scranton. By 1968, the company, which had more than 50 stores at the time, had changed its name to Rite Aid. Rite Aid's initial public offering at $25 a share on the New York Stock Exchange earned the Grass family $8.75 million. Rite Aid purchased a rival chain, the Daw Drug Company, which was based in Rochester, New York, in 1969, which doubled the company's size and gave Rite Aid a pharmacy business for the first time. By the middle of the 1990s, Grass had grown Rite Aid drugstores into an important regional chain. Grass retired as the company's chairman and chief executive in March 1995. That year, Rite Aid had the most stores of any drugstore in the country and was the nation's number two drugstore in terms of revenue. Grass' son, Martin Grass, took over the company from his father in 1995. Rite Aid declined as a chain and a brand as Martin Grass sought to expand the company. Martin Grass was fired by the company in 1999, after he was implicated in an $1.6 billion accounting scandal that nearly destroyed Rite Aid, just four years after his father had retired. Martin Grass was convicted of overstating Rite Aid's earnings during the 1990s and sentenced to eight years in federal prison. He is still incarcerated as of 2009. Other Rite Aid executives were also convicted in the scandal. While still at Rite Aid, former Scranton Mayor James B. McNulty approached Grass about developing an eyesore and vacant lot at the corner of North Washington Avenue and Spruce Street at Courthouse Square in downtown Scranton, just blocks from the original \\"Thrif D Discount Center.\\" Grass accepted McNulty's offer to develop the long vacant site. The four-story Rite Aid office building, with a Rite Aid store on the first floor was constructed at the site. A plaque on the side of the Rite Aid Building commemorates Grass and his establishment of Rite Aid in Scranton. Later life Alex Grass became involved in philanthropy and other business interests following his departure from Rite Aid. For numerous years he headed the board of governors of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem that bestowed him with the National Scopus Award. The Grass Center for Drug Design and Synthesis of Novel Therapeutics was founded at the university in 1993. He served as the longtime director of the National Association of Chain Drug Stores. In 1999, Grass and his son, Roger Grass, purchased the Fleer/SkyBox sports trading card company. The company closed and was sold in 2005. Grass divorced his first wife, Lois Lehrman. His second wife, Louise, died in 2007. Grass had four children during his lifetime. Grass donated $1.5 million to establish the Alex Grass School of Business Leadership at Harrisburg Area Community College. The PinnacleHealth's Harrisburg Hospital named a $14.5 million building after Grass, who was one of its benefactors. Grass donated $1.5 million to the University of Florida to establish chair for its Center for Jewish Studies and construct a new law school building. Death Alex Grass died at his home in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on August 27, 2009, after a ten-year-long battle with lung cancer. Grass' funeral was held at Temple Ohev Sholom in Harrisburg. He was buried in Mount Moriah Cemetery in Lower Paxton Township, Pennsylvania.

It promoted \\"good German music\\" which was composed by Aryans and seen as consistent with Nazi ideals, while suppressing other, \\"degenerate\\" music, which included atonal music, jazz, and music by Jewish composers. The Institute was founded in 1933 by Joseph Goebbels and the Reichskulturkammer (State Bureau of Culture), and it operated until the fall of the Third Reich in 1945. Functions 1935 Reichsmusikkammer decree to the Berlin musician Werner Liebenthal dictating the immediate cessation of his professional activity. One of the Institute's primary goals ‚Äî that of extolling and promoting \\"good German music\\", specifically that of Beethoven, Wagner, Bach, Mozart, Haydn, Brahms, Bruckner and the like ‚Äî was to legitimize the claimed world supremacy of Germany culturally. These composers and their music were re-interpreted ideologically to extol German virtues and cultural identity. Music and composers who did not fall into the RMK's definition of \\"good German music\\" were deprecated and then banned. The Institute proscribed various great composers of the past, including the Jewish-by-birth composers Mahler, Mendelssohn, and Schoenberg, and also Debussy, who had married a Jew. The music of politically dissident composers such as Alban Berg was also banned. And composers whose music had ever been considered sexually suggestive or savage, such as Hindemith, Stravinsky and the like, were denounced as \\"degenerate\\" and banned. Jazz and swing music were seen as degenerate and proscribed. Jazz was labelled Negermusik (\\"Negro Music\\"), and swing music was associated with various Jewish bandleaders and composers such as Artie Shaw and Benny Goodman. Also proscribed were Jewish Tin Pan Alley composers like Irving Berlin and George Gershwin. The Reichsmusikkammer also functioned as a musicians' guild, with composers, performers, conductors, teachers, and instrument manufacturers being obliged to join in order to pursue or continue a career in music. Membership could be denied on grounds of race or politics. Dozens of composers, songwriters, lyricists, and musicians were ruined or forced into exile because for one reason or another (often political or racial) they did not adhere to or comply with the RMK's standards. The career, for instance, of popular operetta composer Leon Jessel was destroyed by the Institute when it promoted boycotts of his music and finally banned it. Personnel Although Joseph Goebbels and other high-level Nazis in the Reichskulturkammer (Reich Culture Institute) basically controlled the RMK, titular presidents and vice-presidents were appointed; in the beginning, this was largely for the sake of the Music Institute's public relations and prestige. ;President Because of his international fame, Richard Strauss, although privately a critic of the Nazi Reich, was installed as president of the Reichsmusikkammer in November 1933. Strauss's motivations in accepting the post were largely to protect his Jewish daughter-in-law and Jewish grandchildren, and to preserve and conduct the music of banned composers like Mahler, Debussy, and Mendelssohn. He was dismissed from the post in June 1935, when a letter to his Jewish librettist Stefan Zweig, critical of Nazi racial profiling, was intercepted by the Gestapo.Kennedy, Michael (1999). Richard Strauss: Man, Musician, Enigma. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pp. 297‚Äì302. Peter Raabe was appointed president after Strauss's dismissal. For much of his tenure as president, Raabe was not the sole leader regarding musical culture in the Reich: In 1936 Goebbels appointed Heinz Drewes, then general music director of Altenburg, to head a department of music in the Propaganda Ministry, resulting in confused and tangled roles.The entangled roles of Drewes and Raabe in the Reichsmusikkammer and Propaganda Ministry are discussed by Michael Kater in his book, The Twisted Muse: Musicians and Their Music in the Third Reich. Raabe tried to resign in 1938, but his resignation was not accepted, and he served until the end of the Reich in 1945. ;Vice- president Renowned conductor Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler was appointed vice-president of the Institute in 1933.

History It is one of the oldest parishes in the countries, with over 400 years of history. The first church in Curridabat was a temporary structure erected by two Franciscan friars, who had assisted in the evangelization of Barva and Aserr√≠ and who wished now to convert the people of Cacique Currirava. Later, a small adobe church was raised to replace the older wooden structure. In 1676 the church was dedicated to Saint Anthony of Padua by order of Philip II of Spain. However, little else is known as the parochial archives were destroyed in 1830 in a fire, leaving little left of two centuries of information. In 1833, Curridabat was raised to an independent parish. It was brought to fame in 1835 when during the Guerra de la Liga the forces from Cartago, which were attacking San Jos√©, commandeered the church as the depository of the miraculous statue of La Negrita, the famous Black Madonna who is patron saint of Costa Rica (and which today resides in the Basilica de los √Ångeles). When they lost the battle, the statue was removed to San Jos√© as a spoil of war and placed in the old Iglesia de la Merc√©d. The church was destroyed by an earthquake in 1841, and again in 1910. It was then demolished in 1923, when Curridabat's resident priest, Anselmo Palacios, decided to construct a new church. He enlisted famed Costa Rican architect Teodorico Quir√≥s to design the church, and it was completed in 1933. Today, it is a monument of immense historic value, though it is not National Patrimony because of contention regarding administration between the diocese and the government.

More gates were built after that period during the Mughal rule and during the British rule. Only 13 gates exist in good condition, while all others are in ruins or have been demolished. Like all gates denote, the direction of the destination station is the starting name of the gate. Gates in the first city In the first city of Delhi, 13 gates were built in the 11th-century citadel of Lal Kot, with the extended Qila Rai Pithora, which was ruled by the Slave Dynasty from 1192 with the establishment of the Qutb complex. These were in the rubble-built ramparts of Lal Kot ( thickness) of which only a few remain, either in ruins or under renovation. These are the Chaumukha, Sohan, Ranjit, Fateh, Hauz Rani, Barka, Badaun, and Budayuni gates. Of these, the Chaumukha, Ranjit, Sohan, and Fateh Darwaza have been listed by the INTACH as heritage monuments. The ruins of Hauz Rani and Barka are seen around the remains between giant gaps in the long stretches of the Lal Kot wall, surrounded by a wide moat on the outside. Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has proposed to conserve all the identified gates.Peck p.229,236 The Chaumukha Darwaza (Chaumukha in Hindi language means four faces) is inferred as the gateway of Lal Kot since it aligns with Lal Kot walls. It is near the Qutb Complex and has been categorized as Grade B in archaeological value. It has been conserved by the ASI. The gate's architectural style is traced to the Tuglaq period in view of its massive thickness. It has a \\"horned\\" outwork with paved stones in an engraved grid pattern that indicates that it was designed for defense purposes. The purpose for which it was built has not been discerned. Hence, it has also been conjectured that it could have been built by Thomas Metcalfe as one of his follies, close to his original 'Dilkusha' mansion (now seen in ruins) to enhance the elegance of his retreat.Peck p.236 The Ranjit gate towards the north wall of Lal Kot is in ruins. It was once considered as a grand gate through which the Turks had entered the city. Hence, it was subsequently fortified to prevent any further foreign incursions. Only part of the gate is visible and is yet to be listed as a heritage monument. The Fateh Gate close to Fateh Burj has convoluted features and is about in diameter. The Sohan Gate guarded by a large bastion called the Sohan Burj was stated to be the location of a Sun temple. Hauz Rani and Budayuni Gates, which were reportedly once-prominent gates, are now traced in ruins. An anecdote of history of the Budayuni gate, considered then as the principal gate of the city by Ibn Battuta (the chronicler of the period, mentions it as the main gate to the city), is that Allauddin Khalji had resolved to shun drinking of alcohol by emptying his wine caskets and breaking his rich Chinaware at this gate. The gate was also known for the punishment meted out to the guilty. They were tortured and beheaded in public view at this gate. A strict watch was maintained at this gate to detect and prevent incursions by Mongols. Alauddin Khalji had planned, as part of his ambitious architectural achievements, to build four Darwaza (gates), but he could build only one during his lifetime, the Alai Darwaza (1311). This gate is seen at the southern end of the Qutb complex of the enlarged Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque, built entirely on the principles of Islamic architecture. The gate made of rectangular bands of red sandstone and white marble has inscriptions of verses from Koran and Hadis in elaborate carvings on its windows. It is a square building ( square) with dome with horse shoe pointed shaped arches on three sides and with a semicircular arch on the northern side. The underside of the arches have fringed lotus bud embellishments.Peck p.42 Historian Fanshawe writing euphorically on the beauty of the gate extolled:Sharma p.57,58 > \\"The Alai Darwaza is not only the most beautiful structure at the Kutub, but > is one of the most striking specimens of external polychromatic decoration > not merely in India, but in the whole world, while the carving of interior > may challenge comparison with any work of the kind.

The effect of the > graceful pointed arches in the three external sides of the gate, and in the > corner recesses is extremely pleasing, and the view from the exterior > through the southern archway to the round-headed arch of the north side, and > the court beyond, is very striking. The decoration of the north arch is > curious and unique. The effect of exterior suffers, from a distant point of > view, from the absence of a parapet above the walls; this was unfortunately > removed by Captain Smith, as it was greatly ruined.

It Has 14 gates, west of Red Fort. Delhi has been the capital of India for more than 1000 years. New Delhi became the capital of India in 1912. Gates in the second city Southern Gate of Siri Fort in ruins The second medieval city of Siri Fort was built during the rule of Ala-ud-Din Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate with the major objective of protecting the city from the onslaught of the Mongols. The city, when built with an oval plan, was best described as presenting an embodiment of richness with palaces and other structures and had seven gates for entry and exit. But, at present, only the Southeastern gate exists, also in ruins (pictured). The destruction of the fort and its gates are attributed more to the local rulers of subsequent dynasties who removed the stones, bricks and other artifacts of the fort for their own buildings and palaces.Peck p. Gates in the third city Entry gate to Tughlaqabad fort and Palace Tughlaqabad, the third city of medieval Delhi, built by Ghazi Malik is well known as Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq who established the Tughlaq Dynasty in 1321 after ousting the Khaljis, was enclosed within a fort of massive proportions completed in a short span of four years. The fort has inclined walls with triple storied citadels, enormous towers, mosques, and halls. The city when built is stated to have had 52 gates but only 13 remain today, mostly in ruins. Of the remaining gates, the main entry gate to the fort was built in typical Pathan style, which is described as made of red sandstone with sloping face and jambs which merge well with the towers of the fort. But the fort was abandoned soon after Ghiyasuddin‚Äôs death for two reasons namely, water shortage and the foolhardy decision of his successor Sultan, the Muhammad bin Tughlaq who forcibly shifted his capital to the new city of Daulatabad in the Deccan and returned to found the fourth city of Jahanpanah.Peck p.135‚Äì138 Gates in the fourth city Muhammad bin Tughluq, first built Adilabad, then Nai-ka-Kot, towards the south of Tughlaqabad. These were two small fortresses. But he soon abandoned them. He built a new city by enclosing the areas lying between the cities of Siri, Tughlaqabad and Lal Kot. The city was named as Jahanpanah, an asylum of the world, in 1334. The city had 13 gates. The ruins of gigantic ramparts of his two fortresses and some portions of the Jahanpanah walls have survived the ravages of time but are seen now only in total ruins. The watchtower Bijai Mandal still stands in ruins in the city of Jahanpanah. But no fort gates are traced.Peck p.58 Gates in the fifth city Firuz Shah Tughlaq built a new capital city on the banks of the Yamuna River in 1351 and called it Firuzabad. The architecture of the fort was fairly simple and straightforward. The city had three palaces and a citadel known as Feroz Shah Kotla. The king's, as well as his wife's quarters, were situated along the riverfront. The structures within the enclosure walls of the fort were barracks, armories, servant's rooms, halls for audience, an imposing mosque as well as public and private baths and a stepped well or baoli. An Ashokan pillar brought from Topara, Ambala was mounted on top of a pyramidal three-tiered construction. No gates of this period exist.Peck p.82‚Äì85 Gates in the sixth city Three main gates on the north, south and west are part of the fortifications of the Purana Qila, the sixth city of Delhi, built by Sher Shah Suri (1538‚Äì45). Sher Shah Suri raised his citadel after demolishing Dinpanah, the city built by Humayun. The fortifications of the Qila extended to a boundary of () on an irregularly oblong plan. Bastions adorned the corners and the western wall. Of the existing three gates, the west gate forms the entrance to the Qila and is called the Bara Darwaza (big gate). All three gates are double-storied structures built with red sandstone and have chhatris. The enclosure wall inside has cells in two-bay depth. The northern gate, built in 1543‚Äì44, is called the Talaqi-Darwaza for reasons unknown. On this gate, in the front, carved marble leogryphs in combat with a man are seen above the oriel windows. Built in random rubble masonry with dressed stone facing, the gate has a tall arch enclosed by two smaller arched openings. Two bastions adorn the gate with high ceiling rooms. On the second floor of the gate, there are two openings. Exterior surface of the gate had coloured tiles and the inner rooms were covered with incised plaster work. The Purana Qila was stated to have been left unfinished by Suri, which was later completed by Humayun. The southern gate is called the Humayun Darwaza; the reasons attributed for the name are that either Humayun built it or the gate overlooked Humayun‚Äôs tomb. An inscription in ink on the gate refers to Sher Shah with the date as 950 A.H. (1543‚Äì44).Peck p.134‚Äì138Sharma p.122‚Äì123 Sher Shah Gate Sher Shah gate or Lal Darwaza Sher Shah gate located to the south of Khairu‚Äôl-Manazil-Masjid is said to be an entrance to the large city of Delhi that Sher Shah built in front of his fortress of Purana Qila. The gate, mostly built with red sandstone but with use of local grey quartzite in its upper storey, is thus called the Lal Darwaza (red gate). Arcades were built from this gate into the city, which were provided with series of dwellings with frontage of a verandah, which may have been used for commercial establishments. Kabuli or Khuni-Darwaza (explained in the following section) is another gate on the fringes of Sher Shah‚Äôs city. ASI has undertaken extensive conservation works of the gate and its surroundings at a cost of Rs7.5 million (US$150,000).Peck p.138Sharma p.128‚Äì129 Gates in the seventh city Shahjahanabad (Old Delhi) in 1863, showing all the gates to walled city. Shahjahanabad, the seventh city of Delhi, was built by Shah Jahan in 1649 like a fortress encircled by strong and high red-brick walls with 14 entry gates to the city, in addition to 16 wicket gates called windows (khirkis in Urdu language). A number of bastions built of stone were added by the British, in addition to repairing the earlier fort, to make the fort more secure. The gates were designed and built for the people to have access and the royal procession to enter or exit when going out in diverse directions. Out of the 14 gates, five gates have survived, namely, the Kashmiri Gate on the north, the Ajmeri Gate on the south-west, the Delhi Gate on the south-east, Turkman Gate on the south and the Nigambodh Gate on the north-east, all of which express vividly the splendor of the city. All the gates are located within a radius of in the present day Old Delhi. The Lahori gate on the Northeast, in the old city, was demolished (some remnant walls are seen at the crossing as may be seen in picture) and the area converted into the present day Lahori Bazar. The gates have a square plan with high arched openings, except for low height of the Nigambodh gate, and two openings‚Äîone for entry and another for exit‚Äîof the Kashmiri gate. The names of all the gates, which existed during Shahajahan‚Äôs time are the Dilli Darwaza (also known as Delhi Gate), Kabuli Darwaza, Raj Ghat Darwaza, Khizri Darwaza, Nigambodh Darwaza, Kela Ke Ghat ka Darwaza, Lal Darwaza, Kashmiri Darwaza, Badar Darwaza, Patthar Khati Darwaza, Lahori Darwaza, Ajmeri Darwaza and Turkuman Darwaza. The names of the wicket gates or windows (now none exist) through which people entered and exited from the old fort city were: * Zeenatul Masajid Khirkee * Nawab Ahmad Bakhsh ki Khirkee * Nawab Ghaziuddin ki Khirkee * Musamman Burj ki Khirkee * Muslim Garh ki Khirkee * Naseer Ganj ki Khirkee * Nai Khirkee * Shah Ganj Khirkee * Ajmeri Darwaza ki Khirkee * Sayyad Bhole ki Khirkee * Buland Bagh ki Khirkee * Farash Khana ki Khirkee * Ameer Khan ki Khirkee * Khalil Khan ki Khirkee * Bahadur Ali Khan ki Khirkee * Nigambodh ki Khirkee. Kashmiri gate Kashmiri Gate is one of the original 14 gates built into the wall to the north of the city. It was built by the British in 1835 by Major Robert Smith. Local people also call it Truckman gate. It has a square plan. There are two openings of the gate: one for entry and another for exit (pictured). During 1835, the British enlarged and straightened it into a two-way gate as defensive measure against enemy attacks. In the present city setting, the gate is close to the Inter State Bus Terminals. It is now preserved as monument on the road to the Old Secretariat and the Delhi University. It was named as Kashmiri Gate since it was used by the emperors to go through on their visits to Kashmir and North India. It was also the historic venue of the intense fighting which took place in 1857, between the British army and the Indian freedom fighters. The fortifications were used to fire cannons at the British army encamped at Ludlow Castle. The freedom fighters gathered at a place close to the St. James Church to discuss war strategy. British troops fought fiercely at this gate and re-captured the city from mutinous Indian soldiers. During the war, the gate was badly damaged by the British to get control over Delhi. Subsequently, area surrounding the Kashmiri Gate became the commercial hub of Delhi, when the Civil Lines were developed by the British.Peck p.192 Delhi Gate The Delhi Gate (Coordinates 28.641196N 77.240511E) is the southern gate in the historic walled city of (Old) Delhi, or Shahjahanabad. The gate links the New Delhi city with the old walled city of Delhi. It stands in the middle of the road, at the end of Netaji Subhash Chandra Road (or Netaji Subhash Marg), at the edge of the Daryaganj. Other Delhi Gate of Delhi, is also situated in Najafgarh. Ajmeri Gate Ajmeri Gate Ajmeri Gate, built in 1644, to the south-west of Shahjahanabad with a square plan, has high arched openings. It was one of the battlefields of the Sepoy Mutiny or the first war of Indian independence in 1857. The road, through this gate, leads to the city of Ajmer in Rajasthan, and hence its name. A lovely park surrounds the gate. The madrasa (Islamic school of learning) built by Nawab Ghaziuddin Bahadur father of the first Nizam of Hyderabad in 1811, west of the college lies the tomb of the founder and a mosque In the following years, it converted to Delhi college and was one of the constituent colleges of the Delhi University. The College has shifted to a new building now and the Anglo Arabic Senior Secondary School runs in the old building. Nearby outside a ditch, once lied remains of the underground apartments of Safdarjung, which at one point were one of the important sights of Delhi. At present, the old walls of the fort have been demolished and replaced by commercial buildings and residential complexes, but the gate on the west exists. Turkman Gate Turkman gate Turkman Gate, located to the southern edge of Shahajahanabad (Coordinates: 28.642231N 77.232591E), is named after the Sufi Saint Shah Turkman Bayabani. His tomb dated to 1240, before building of Shahjahanabad, is located to the east of the gate. It is approached from the Jawahar Lal Nehru Road, the old Circular Road, in the vicinity of the Ramlila grounds. It has a square plan with high arched openings. The tomb of Razia Sultan and Kali Masjid or Kalan Masjid are located in close proximity of the gate./. The gate was the scene of Turkman gate demolition and rioting in 1976.

The etymology of Nigambodh is derived from Sanskrit words ‚ÄòNigam‚Äô which means the ‚ÄúVed‚Äù and ‚Äòbodh‚Äô means ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù, meaning realization of knowledge. According to a folk legend, Lord Brahma (the creator) took a bath in the Yamuna River at this ghat to recover his lost memory and by this act Brahma not only got back his memory but also remembered the place he had kept his sacred books. In the past, the gate was closer to the ghat and nearer to the Salimgarh Fort. Kabuli Gate Khuni Darwaza or Bloody Gate Kabuli Gate or Khooni Darwaza (Coordinates: 28.635974N 77.241042E), literally translated means ‚ÄúBloody Gate‚Äù, a ‚Äúmorbid sounding name‚Äù. It is an impressive double-storied structure. Its construction is credited to Sher Shah Suri's reign from 1540‚Äì1545 (though the fort walls of the Suri period have not been seen to extend to this gate). It was built largely with grey stone but red stones were also used in the frames of its windows. Though not within the walls of the Shahajahan's fort, it is located on the Mathura road opposite to the Ferozshah Kotla near Maulana Azad Medical College. At this gate, on September 21, 1857, during the Indian Rebellion, three sons of the last Mughal Emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar, were executed by the British Officer, Captain William Hodson. Bahadur Shahi Gate Salimgarh Fort, which is now part of the Red fort complex, was constructed on an island of the Yamuna River in 1546. But a gate called the Bahadur Shahi Gate for entry into the Fort from the northern side was constructed only in 1854‚Äì55 by Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mogul ruler of India. The gate was built in brick masonry with moderate use of red sandstone. The fort was used during the Uprising in 1857 and also as a prison, which housed Zebunnisa, daughter of Aurangzeb; the British imprisoned the freedom fighters of Indian National Army. The layout of the Red Fort was organized to retain and integrate this site with the Salimgarh Fort through the Bahadur Shah Gate. Gates in the eighth city Delhi became the capital of British India after the seat of power was shifted from Calcutta in 1911. With this shift, the new city of New Delhi was established and the sixth city of Shahajahanabad to its north became the Old Delhi. Based on the designs of Edwin Lutyens, New Delhi was built over 20 years. One of the important landmarks built during this period was the India Gate. Built in 1921, it is officially known as All India War Memorial (an arch) to the Indian soldiers killed in the World War I, the Northwest Frontier operations of the same time and the 1919 Afghan fiasco. The gate has an impressive stone arch of height; the names of over 90,000 soldiers are engraved on it. The base of the gate is built in red Bharatpur stone and displays a shallow domed bowl. The past tradition was to fill this bowl with oil and light it as a lamp on anniversaries but is no more practiced, instead, an eternal flame burns below the arch. The eternal flame was added in the 1970s in the arch of the Gate to honour the Immortal Soldier. It is flanked by two uniformed soldiers. The place takes a carnival atmosphere in the evenings when it is well lighted and visitors flock to the gate. Seen behind the India Gate is an impressive Chhatri, which displayed the statue of King George V till 1968. This statue has been shifted to the Coronation Park, Delhi, which was the site of the declaration of the new capital of Delhi. The Chhatri is now devoid of any statue since there is a protracted discussion on which National leader's statue should be installed there.Peck p.266,268 There is an impressive set of a large central steel gates flanked by asymmetrically designed smaller gates that provides entry into the Rashtrapati Bhavan (President's palace). A commemorative column called the Jaipur Column with a \\"distinctly peculiar crown: a glass star springing out of bronze lotus blossom\\", is located midway between the entry gates and the Rashtrapati Bhavan.Peck p.276 Gallery File:Alai Darwaza, an ancient view.jpg|Ancient view of Alai Darwaza File:South gate entry to Tughlaqbad fort.jpg|South gate entry to Tughlaqabad Fort File:West Gate of Feruzabad since destroyed.jpg|West gate of Feruzabad File:South Gate.jpg|South Gate Purana Qila File:North Gate1.jpg|North gate Purana Qila File:Lal Darwaza detail.jpg|Lal Darwaza detail File:Purana Qila.jpg|Purana Qila File:Red_Fort_01.jpg|Red Fort entry gate File:Moori Gate Delhi.jpg|Moori Gate File:Water gate (Red Fort).jpg|Water Gate of Red Fort File:Red Fort in Delhi 03-2016 img1.jpg|Delhi Gate of Red Fort The grave to the east of Turkman Gate is not the mausoleum of the 13th century Sufi Shams- ul-Arifeen Shah Turkman Byabani.

He served as Bishop of Dallas from 1894 until his death in 1910. Biography Edward Dunne was born in Gortnahoe, County Tipperary, to Richard and Judith (n√©e Cooke) Dunne. At a young age, he and his parents came to the United States, where he was raised in Chicago, Illinois. He studied at St. Francis Seminary in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and then at St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore, Maryland. He was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Thomas Andrew Becker on June 29, 1871. Upon his return to Chicago, Dunne was named a curate under Rev. Patrick William Riordan (later Archbishop of San Francisco) at St. John's Church. He served at St. Mary's Church from 1873 until 1875, when he became pastor of All Saints Church. He there erected a church (1880) and an illustrious parochial school, which even received recognition from the Chicago Public Board of Education. He also served as financial overseer for the Archdiocese of Chicago. At some point in the early part of 1884, Dunne traveled to St. Anthony of Padua Parish in the rural Catholic colony of San Antonio, Florida for health reasons. During his very brief time there (5 ‚Äì 6 months), he was credited by The Catholic Review with a great number of advancements on behalf of the three-year-old faith- community. Most notable among them, during Lent of 1884 he greatly advanced the development of a Catholic school. To that point, classes had been conducted in the home of Cecilia Morse, a Catholic education pioneer herself. Two weeks after Easter on April 29, 1884, largely due to Fr. Dunne's efforts, St. Anthony Catholic School was officially established and began holding formal classes in the parish church until a suitable schoolhouse was constructed several months later.Dunne, Sr. Margaret O.S.B. (1984). Saint Anthony School Memories of the First Hundred Years. Saint Leo, FL. Holy Name Priory. p 3 He returned to All Saints Church in Chicago shortly thereafter. On September 24, 1893, Dunne was appointed the second Bishop of Dallas, Texas, by Pope Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following November 30 from Archbishop Patrick Feehan, with Bishops James Ryan and John Samuel Foley serving as co-consecrators, at All Saints. He was installed in Dallas in January. During his tenure, Dunne opened several educational institutions, including Holy Trinity College (later named the University of Dallas). He established St. Paul Sanitarium (now St. Paul Medical Center) in Dallas, and St. Anthony's Sanitarium, which was the first hospital in Amarillo. He also erected Sacred Heart Cathedral. During his sixteen years as bishop, the number of churches increased from twenty-eight to ninety, and the Catholic population tripled in size. Dunne died from a heart attack while visiting a friend in Green Bay, Wisconsin, aged 62. Upon the request of his brother, he was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Evanston, IL.

The hotel was probably built in 1870 as Healey's, becoming the Ivanhoe Hotel in 1876, and held by the Healey family until 1940, when it was renovated. The name changed to \\"The Tote\\" in 1980 when the venue began hosting local and Australian punk, post- punk, heavy metal and hardcore bands. The venue hosted many independent local, Australian and international acts throughout the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s and carried a reputation for showcasing new and emerging independent musical acts of a variety of stylistic origins. The venue operated 6 days a week with performances across 3 settings, the \\"main stage\\", the \\"cobra bar\\" and the \\"front bar\\". Residencies were also a popular occurrence at the venue. On 15 January 2010, due to high financial costs surrounding disputed liquor licensing laws, it was announced that the venue would be closing that same weekend. A groundswell of community support for the venue and opposition to aspects of liquor licensing laws, quickly mobilised. Several groups on social networking sites quickly sprung up, one such group attracting over 20,000 people. On Sunday the 17th, an estimated crowd of around 2,000 rallied outside the Tote. The events surrounding the closure, the rally and various petitions, sparked public and political debate about liquor licensing laws and live music in Melbourne and Victoria. On 23 February, a much larger rally of at least 10,000, the 2010 Melbourne live music rally, was later held in central Melbourne, that same day amendments to liquor licensing laws were announced. Etymology The current venue is most likely named after an illegal betting shop operated by John Wren between 1893 and 1905 which was fictionalised in Frank Hardy's 1950 novel Power Without Glory. The connections between The Tote (the hotel) and The Tote (the betting shop) are likely to be fictional. History Upon the settlement of Collingwood from the 1830s to the 1850s, a dairy farm occupied the area for many years. The first building to occupy the site was a wooden shanty operated by storekeepers Messrs. Howitt and Hale during the 1850s.Mercury and Weekly Courier, Sat 6 Jun 1885, p. 3. Daniel Healey, then an uncertificated insolvent, purchased the land in 1867 for ¬£400 and fraudulentlyLeader, 22 October 1870, p. 20Geelong Advertiser, 22 October 1870, p. 3 transferred the deed by trust to his wife and child, operating the site as a grain store before building a hotel for ¬£740 in about 1870.The Age, 25 April 1872, p. 3 Daniel Healey was the publican, operating the hotel as 'Healeys', with his wife Bridget Healey. It was not profitable to begin with as Daniel Healey faced a second insolvency for debts amounting to ¬£212 7s in April 1871.The Argus, 6 April 1871, p. 6 By 1876, the name had become the 'Ivanhoe Hotel', also known as Healey's Ivanhoe Hotel. In his youth, the Healey's son, famous bookmaker Mr. Mick Healey, would help run the hotel before obtaining his bookmaker license in 1884.Sporting Globe, Wed 22 May 1940, p. 8 New licensing laws in 1886 saw licensee Bridget Healey before the local courts for having a door open to the bar or unlocked during prohibited hours.Mercury and Weekly Courier, 12 March 1886, p. 3 Daniel Healey died 14 August 1894 at age 58.The Age, 16 Aug 1894, p. 1 From 1893 to 1905, it has been alleged the venue was used as an illegal betting shop by childhood friend of Mr. Mick Healey, John Wren, though this seems unlikely, considering the Tea Shop likely used as a cover for this gambling was 200m across the road, backing onto Sackville Street. It is around this time that the rumoured tunnels leading from the Tote's cellar to buildings opposite, are suspected to have been constructed. Bridget Healey died 8 February 1906 and the hotel ownership transferred to her daughters,The Age, 2 March 1906, p. 5 who leased the hotel out in 1912. It was not always run appropriately with daughter Margaret Walsh attempting to eject holder Eleanor Hunt in 1915 for not conforming to the licensing act by 'supplying a person under 18 years of age with liquor'.The Age, 18 Dec 1915, p. 20 Mr. Mick Healey died May 1940 and in June, after being in the possession of the Healey family for more than 70 years, the hotel was purchased by Mr. Stanley Bell, of the Eureka Hotel, Richmond. At purchase he stated the intent to make extensive alterations to the building. The exterior tiles and simplified parapet are typical of interwar pub renovations, and so probably date from this time. The upper floor windows and the similar ground floor windows are typically 19th century, so that its 1870 origins are still quite clear. In 1950, the venue was famously fictionalised in Frank Hardy's 1950 novel Power Without Glory. In 1980, the venue began operating as 'The Tote' and quickly established itself as a centre of contemporary live music.  Musical highlights  The Tote is often associated with distinctly Australian rock n roll. Bands like The Meanies, Cosmic Psychos, The Drones, Mach Pelican, Magic Dirt, The Birthday Party, The Spazzys, Underground Lovers, and Miss Destiny were regulars at the venue. On 28 September 1986 The Bo-Weevils recorded a performance at the venue, which was issued as Garage Twangin' Retard Rabble Sounds, on cassette later that year. Larger Australian bands such as Jet, Silverchair and the Hoodoo Gurus also appeared; the venue also hosted many international acts, including The White Stripes and Mudhoney. Rumours and legends The Tote Ghost There is a popular myth that a ghost infrequently inhabits the Tote. The ghost is said to be neither friendly nor unfriendly and supposedly inhabits the landing of the stairs (beneath the large 'Cobra Woman' banner) and is apparently always seen making its way upstairs. The ghost is often speculated to be a lost patron looking for the amenities, or a faded rock god whose demise no-one noticed, but the most popular story involves Squizzy Taylor the Melbourne gangster, a rowdy New Year's Eve patron and an uncooperative publican. The original publicans Daniel Healey passed on residence 1894, and Bridget Healey passed on residence 1906. On the day of 30 April 1905 a domestic servant named Ellen M'Carthy became the mother of an infant which she put in a box beneath her bed.The Age, 16 June 1905, p. 4 When seen by another person the child was dead. No violence was involved and charges of concealment of birth were discharged. Totes McGrotes The phrase \\"Totes McGrotes\\" is said to have originated from a regular patron in the late 1980s, Kevin \\"Grotey\\" McGrotes. Tunnels There are persistent rumours of tunnels running from the cellar of the current Tote under Johnston and Wellington Streets to shops opposite. These are supposed to have facilitated get-aways for bookies who used to operate from the pub. January 2010 closure The intersection of Johnston and Wellington Streets, Collingwood, during the rally on 17 January 2010 On 14 January 2010, it was announced that the Tote Hotel would close that same weekend. In the lead-up to the closure, the business owner, Bruce Milne, had been contesting through VCAT, certain conditions and requirements of the \\"high risk conditions\\" of Victorian Liquor Licensing laws, imposed upon the venue. The costs of the \\"high risk\\" conditions, including CCTV installation and increased security, and high costs of pursuing the case through VCAT, triggered financial strain on the owner, who was forced to close the venue on 14 January. The \\"high risk conditions\\" were triggered by the fact that the Tote hosts performance of \\"live or amplified music\\". These \\"high risk\\" conditions have been the subject of much dispute and debate, prior to and after the closure of the Tote Hotel, with many arguing that the \\"high risk\\" conditions should be evidence-based and not triggered merely by the performance of music. 17 January rally At 6pm on Sunday, 17 January, an estimated crowd of between 2,000 and 5,000 rallied outside the Tote, filling the intersection of Johnston and Wellington Streets and spilling down each street. People found other vantage points on rooftops, upper story windows and balconies in the surrounding buildings. Amongst the crowd were amateur and professional photographers, film makers, a Tote documentary crew, various local independent music celebrities and a large collection of Melbourne's local independent musicians, patrons, long-time Tote patrons, former employees and others. Petitions circulated the crowd before a makeshift PA system was set up through one of the building's upper-level windows, facilitating speeches from \\"Fair Go 4 Live Music\\", Rod Quantock, a councillor for the City of Yarra and owner Bruce Milne. A long line of optimistic patrons had also begun to form down Wellington Street attempting to gain access to the venue. As the evening progressed, several unsuccessful attempts were made to set up bands in the street. A house in Wellington Street had bands playing within it, while a shopfront at 79 Johnston Street also housed a band called Psychic Temple,Psychic Temple featuring members from Melbourne-based outfits Electric Jellyfish, The Morrisons and The Melbourne Bitters. By 10pm, the crowd had been moved to the pathways and around 11pm the intersection was reopened. A large crowd remained at the intersection for some time into the night. People gathering and queuing on Wellington Street, closing night Fair Go 4 Live Music petition A petition was circulated by \\"Fair Go 4 Live Music\\", in response to the Tote's closure, which currently has over 1,000 signatories. It requests that the high risk conditions only be placed on venues after evidence-based assessment has been made to ascertain their categorisation of being \\"high risk\\". At the moment, the high risk conditions are triggered merely by hosting \\"live or amplified music\\", which forces small music venues to close at 1am or pay high costs in security to remain open till 3am. Meanwhile, high capacity venues, nightclubs elsewhere who can afford to pay to comply with the high risk conditions are allowed to continue to operate despite evidence and history of alcohol-related violence. The petition reads: \\"The petition of certain citizens of the State of Victoria draws to the attention of the Legislative Council that the liquor licensing laws and regulations are destroying the vibrancy and viability of live music performed in licensed venues. The \\"high risk conditions\\" should not be triggered by cultural practice (if live or amplified music is being played) but rather by high alcohol consumption patterns. The assessment and application of security, CCTV and other high cost conditions should be evidence based, and not based on the biased assumptions and opinions of bureaucrats.\\" \\"The Petitioners therefore request that: 1. The Victorian Government institute a proper investigation into the causes of violence and drunkenness. 2. Until such investigation is undertaken and concluded, the Government remove all references to \\"live and amplified music\\" from the license amenity clause on liquor licenses. 3. The Government formulate a cultural policy that promotes and maintains Melbourne as Australia's capital for live music.\\" The rally at the Tote, 17 January 2010  Reopening  The Tote Hotel had reopened under new management by April that year.  Feature Film  A documentary film Persecution Blues:the battle for the Tote, detailing the communities fight to save the hotel, premiered in Melbourne at the 60th Melbourne International Film Festival in July, 2011. It is directed by Natalie van den Dungen and edited by Ken Swallows. Subsequently, the film was picked up by Cinema Nova for cinema release, and aired on ABC Television on 25 January 2012 and 19 January 2016. The movie was released on DVD and on iTunes by Madman Entertainment in 2013.

The O'Connell family, principally of Derrynane, are a Gaelic Irish noble family of County Kerry in Munster. The principal seat of the senior line of the family was Derrynane House, now an Irish National Monument. Ancestry and extraction According to tradition, they descend from the ancient U√≠ Fidgenti (U√≠ Chonaill Gabra sept) of County Limerick, being descendants of D√°ire Cerbba,as presented by Daniel Charles O'Connell to the heralds of Louis XVI of France and are thus cousins of the O'Donovans and O'Collins. Other ancestors, through marriage, include the Kings of Thomond of the great O'Brien dynasty, the MacCarthy Mor dynasty of the great Kingdom of Desmond, the two O'Sullivan dynasties Beare and Mor, O'Callaghan, O'Connor Kerry, O'Donovan of Clancahill, and the O'Donoghue Dhuv sept of O'Donoghue of the Glens.Cronnelly 1864, pp. 221-4O'Connell of Derrynane (O'Hart 1892, pp. 183-5)Cusack 1872, p. 6 ffBurke 1899, pp. 336-7O'Connell 1892, pp. 7-8 Origins It has been suggested that the O'Connells are a sept of the Corcu Duibne, the Ua Congaile, a kingdom native to County Kerry.Mumu by Dennis Walsh While certainly a possibility, and one demanding more research, there still remains more supporting evidence at this time for a descent from the U√≠ Chonaill Gabra of County Limerick: a family using the sept name of their former kingdom as their surname following its disintegration is not something unheard of in Ireland,e.g. the MacNultys (Mac an Ulltaigh) of Ulster were a sept of the D√°l Fiatach or Ulaid and the claims of Count O'Connell to descent from D√°ire Cerbba cannot simply be dismissed as career-minded, when the U√≠ Fidgenti had long since faded and a Corcu Duibne ancestry would have been no less attractive. A descent from the Corcu Duibne would make the O'Connells of Derrynane kin to the O'Sheas and O'Falveys, and descendants of the legendary Conaire M√≥r, ancestor also of the D√°l Riata monarchs of Scotland. Thus the O'Connells are not technically allowed to be of royal extraction because they cannot conclusively prove their patrilineal ancestors to have been kings of any specific septs or territories, even if they might have been. But through marriage they are closely related to the various ancient royal families of Munster, and in fact to a greater extent than those are to each other. The province of Munster was itself divided into several exclusive provinces but the O'Connells were successful in bridging this.

Construction and commissioning Scribner was laid down as the Rudderow-class destroyer escort USS Scribner (DE-689) on 29 June 1944 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Company at Quincy, Massachusetts, and was reclassified as a Crosley-class high-speed transport and redesignated APD-122 on 17 July 1944. She was launched on 1 August 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Theresa J. Scribner, the mother of the ships namesake, James M. Scribner. After conversion for her new role, she was commissioned on 20 November 1944 with Lieutenant Commander G. M. Street in command.  Service history   World War II  After shakedown, Scribner departed Norfolk, Virginia, on 12 January 1945, escorting the repair ship to Panama and then proceeding to Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, where she arrived on 6 February 1945. She underwent training with her embarked underwater demolition team at Maui between 11 February 1945 and 13 February 1945, and then moved to Leyte in the Philippine Islands for further training. Scribner arrived off Okinawa with the invasion force on 26 March 1945, and that night began underwater demolition team reconnaissance operations with her sister ship, the high-speed transport , at Kerama Retto. Her embarked United States Marines also examined the Eastern Islands and Menna Shima before disembarking on Okinawa on 18 April 1945. Scribner then continued support to the Okinawa campaign, commencing patrol duty around the transport anchorage which lasted until 15 May 1945, when she departed Okinawa for upkeep at Guam. Upkeep completed, Scribner returned to Okinawa on 7 June 1945 and resumed her patrol duty around the transport anchorage. She conducted an underwater demolition team survey of Kure Shima on 13 and 14 June 1945, then returned to patrol duty at the transport anchorage until 22 July 1945, when she departed to return to the United States to undergo underwater demolition team training for Operation Olympic, the planned November 1945 invasion of Ky≈´sh≈´, Japan. However, the surrender of Japan ended World War II on 15 August 1945 ‚Äì 14 August 1945 on the eastern side of the International Date Line in the United States‚Äîthe day before she arrived in the United States, making the scheduled training unnecessary. Postwar Her training cancelled, Scribner instead underwent three weeks of overhaul at San Pedro, California. Upon its completion, she departed the United States West Coast on 7 September 1945 and, after making several logistics voyages in the Western Pacific, arrived at Manila on Luzon in the Philippine Islands on 19 October 1945. Scribner was then assigned to escort a group of American transports which was to load Chinese troops at Haiphong, French Indochina, and disembark them at Dairen in north China to disarm Japanese troops in that area. Political difficulties delayed the convoys departure from Manila until 30 October 1945, and the Chinese troops were finally disembarked at Chinhuangtao, China, an alternate location, on 12 November 1945. Scribner then escorted the transports to Taku on 14 November 1945, and served there as headquarters ship for the port director between 24 November and 4 December 1945, and as radio guardship there until 19 January 1946. Scribner moved to Tsingtao, China, on 20 January 1946, and departed for Haiphong on 21 March 1946. She was relieved there on 11 April 1946 and began the long trip to the United States on 12 April 1946, arriving at Charleston, South Carolina, on 1 July 1946 for inactivation. Decommissioning and disposal Scribner was decommissioned on 15 November 1946 and placed in reserve. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 August 1966 and sold on 6 September 1967 to Gregg, Gibson, and Gregg, Inc., of Miami, Florida, for scrapping. Honors and awards Scribner received one battle star for World War II service.

Overview Founded in 2006,Bertrand Meyer and Willy Zwaenepoel, European Computer Science Takes Its Fate in Its Own hands, in Communications of the ACM, vol. 49, no. 3, pp. 21‚Äì24, March 2006; draft copy available here.Bertrand Meyer Informatics Europe is a non-profit organization with head office in Zurich, Switzerland that has grown to represent over 140 members from 32 European countries. Members are institutes rather than individuals and include university departments of Informatics, Computer Science, Computing, IT, ICT as well as public and industrial IT research institutes and National Associations in Europe. In addition, Informatics Europe liaises with scientific organisations such as the European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics (ERCIM), the Association for Computing Machinery ACM) and the Computing Research Association (CRA).  History  On 21 October 2005, the ‚Äú1st European Computer Science Summit‚Äù brought together, for the first time, heads of Informatics and Computer Science departments throughout Europe. This landmark event was a joint undertaking of the Computer Science departments of the two branches of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology: EPFL (Lausanne) and ETH (Zurich). Besides the keynotes, talks, panels and workshops, the result of the Summit was the unanimous view that European computer scientists needed an organisation with aims and scope similar to those of the CRA in the US, extended ‚Äî in light of the situation in Europe ‚Äî to cover education as well as research. As a result, Informatics Europe was created with the aim to become the recognized voice of the European computer science community, including both universities and research centres. Bertrand Meyer from ETH Zurich, one of the founding members of the organisation, served as its first President from 2006 to 2011. Carlo Ghezzi, Politecnico di Milano, was the second President from 2012 to 2015. Lynda Hardman, CWI / Utrecht University was the third President, serving from 2016 to 2017. The current President, Enrico Nardelli from Universit√† di Roma 'Tor Vergata', took office in 2018.  Mission and Activities  Informatics Europe is involved in a number of activities with the mission to foster quality research, education, and knowledge transfer in Informatics in Europe.  ECSS - European Computer Science Summit  The _European Computer Science Summit_ takes place once a year and offers a platform where leaders and decision makers in Informatics research and education in Europe gather to debate strategic themes and trends related to research, education and policies in Informatics. Past Summits since 2005: * ECSS 2019, Rome * ECSS 2018, Gothenburg * ECSS 2017, Lisbon * ECSS 2016, Budapest * ECSS 2015, Vienna * ECSS 2014, Wroclaw * ECSS 2013, Amsterdam * ECSS 2012, Barcelona * ECSS 2011, Milan * ECSS 2010, Prague * ECSS 2009, Paris * ECSS 2008, Zurich * ECSS 2007, Berlin * ECSS 2006, Zurich * ECSS 2005, Zurich  Working Groups  Informatics Europe fosters various working groups to shape strategic priorities within the European Informatics community. Each working group has thereby a focus on a specific topic or goal that is agreed on in the beginning of each year. The current groups are as follows: * Data Collection and Reporting - aims at bringing forward solid, accurate facts and figures about Informatics research and education in Europe * Ethics - Produces a summary report, outlining the possible approaches, the state of the art, and suggestions and guidelines for inclusion of topics related to ethics, responsibility and social impacts in Informatics university degree programs * Informatics Education - aims at getting academia, industry, government and society together to influence education policy in Europe towards the full recognition and establishment of Informatics as a foundational discipline in schools * Research Evaluation - examines all current changes and brings forward an updated set of recommendations for research evaluation in Informatics and closely related areas * The Wide Role of Informatics at Universities - investigates what universities are doing to ensure that non-informatics teaching and research is informed by best practice in Informatics * Women in Informatics Research and Education - promotes actions that help improve gender balance at all stages of the career path in Informatics.  Awards  Each year, Informatics Europe presents two awards recognizing outstanding initiatives that advance the quality of research and education in Informatics in Europe. The Best Practices in Education Award recognizes educational initiatives across Europe that improve the quality of Informatics teaching and the attractiveness of the discipline. The Minerva Informatics Equality Award recognizes best practices in Departments or Faculties of European Universities and Research Labs that encourage and support the careers of women in Informatics research and education.  Services   Informatics Higher Education Data Portal  The Higher Education Data Portal is a project of Informatics Europe created with the goal of providing members, the Informatics academic community, policymakers, industry and other stakeholders a complete and reliable picture of the state of Informatics (Computer Science, Computing, IT, ICT) higher education in Europe. The full dataset, consisting of 8 years of data from over 20 countries (annually updated in October), is the only one of its kind in Europe. The focus on Informatics, and the central role played by data curation makes it unique, reliable and relevant.  Leaders Workshop  Every year Informatics Europe organises a special Workshop for Leaders of Informatics Research and Education, as part of the ECSS global program, to address specific challenges they encounter in their role. The workshop is a unique networking forum for leaders of Informatics institutions and research groups, and focuses on concrete issues and practical solutions.  Informatics Job Platform  The Informatics Europe Job Platform lists open scientific positions in Informatics (Computer Science, Computing, Computer Engineering, IT, ICT) and closely related fields and includes positions requiring a PhD degree or higher (e.g.: scientific researcher, post-doc, professor, etc.).  Department Evaluation  The Department Evaluation is a service offered by Informatics Europe to assess research quality in Informatics, Computer Science and IT in university departments/faculties.  Informatics Research & Education Directory  The Research & Education Directory includes institutions (faculties, departments, institutes, etc.) doing research and offering education in Informatics (Computer Science, Computing, Computer Engineering, IT, ICT) in Europe. The directory provides quick access to these institutions and to more detailed information presented by them.

With an official tagline stating \\"Today's Stories / Tomorrow's Doctors\\" and targeting an audience that includes the general public, medical students, and physicians, Radio Rounds is the first radio program in the United States produced entirely by medical students. Created in 2008 by medical student Avash Kalra and founded as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization by Kalra, Lakshman Swamy, and Shamie Das, Radio Rounds premiered on April 12, 2009. Since that time, Radio Rounds has featured over 100 guests, including Pulitzer Prize winners, decorated global health workers, and even a former U.S presidential candidate. By hosting guests such as world-renowned physician and author Rachel Naomi Remen and NBA Team Physician of the Year Brian Cole (Chicago Bulls), the show has focused on showcasing qualities of medicine such as humanism and empathy and has created a dialogue about the practice of medicine from different perspectives. Radio Rounds airs every Sunday afternoon from 12 p.m. to 12:30 p.m. ET, via live streaming audio on the program's website, and on National Public Radio (NPR) affiliate station WYSO. Free podcasts of each episode are also available on iTunes, and those can be accessed via the show's website, www.radiorounds.org, or by searching the iTunes Store for \\"Radio Rounds.\\" History Radio Rounds was founded in 2008, and after several months of preparation and marketing, the program premiered on April 12, 2009. With medical students Avash Kalra and Lakshman Swamy as the original hosts, the premiere episode broke the all-time WWSU record for online listenership, and the show was subsequently featured in a front page story of the following week's The Guardian, Wright State University's student newspaper. A transcribed interview with Kalra and Swamy was later published in the Spring/Summer 2009 edition of Vital Signs, a magazine produced for the Boonshoft School of Medicine. In it, Kalra explained his motivation for wanting to create the show, saying, > \\"Part of the culture of medicine involves medical students listening to and > learning from mentors. So, we thought, why not do something like that on a > weekly basis, but in a fun and engaging way?\\" Added Swamy, > \\"Doctors seem to appreciate the idea of talking about medicine, creating a > dialog about what makes the practice of health care so unique. This idea is > one of the core visions of the project‚Äîto create a forum for the discussion > of physicianhood itself.\\" Season Two of Radio Rounds premiered on August 9, 2009. The second season of Radio Rounds, which featured a lineup of accomplished physician-authors, concluded on December 6, 2009 with a special interview with Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning author Tracy Kidder. Another Season Two highlight was a unique live-audience talk show at a regional American Medical Students Association conference, in which Kalra, Swamy, and Das interviewed U.S. Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky. Season Three of Radio Rounds consisted of 13 episodes in the late winter and early spring of 2010. The third season of the show also marked the debut of host John Corker, a medical student at the Wright State University Boonshoft School of Medicine. Season Four of the program premiered in August 2010 and included several landmark moments, including the celebration of the show's 50th episode. In addition, the cast of hosts expanded to include medical students Teresa Lee, Adam Deardorff, John Mark Mclain, and Casey McCluskey. In addition, Yojan Patel joined the Radio Rounds team as a producer of the show. Seasons Five and Six aired in 2011, and Season Seven is scheduled to premiere in January 2012. Format Each episode of the show is 30 minutes and features an interview with at least one special guest, either live in the studio or via telephone. Guests include physicians, medical school admissions directors, students in different stages of their medical education, and other health care leaders. Beginning with Episode 412 (i.e. the 12th episode of Season Four), the show began opening with a short \\"teaser clip\\" of the episode's featured guest. The structure of the program has evolved over time but traditionally features three segments: a short \\"intro,\\" the featured interview, and an \\"outro\\" in which the hosts discuss topics related to the interview. Beginning with its 11th episode, which aired on August 23, 2009, Radio Rounds began opening with a new theme song, entitled \\"Rounding on the Radio.\\" The song is performed by Robert Mikan, Meera Menon, Cole Budinsky and Kevin Gulley‚Äîall medical students at the Boonshoft School of Medicine. An additional feature that was included during Season Three episodes was a weekly \\"Residency Insights\\" segment, featuring short interview clips with residency program directors from around the country. This feature was added by the show's production team in order to give medical students additional exposure to future career possibilities. Other interactive features of the show have included a mystery diagnosis \\"case of the week,\\" medical headlines, live listener emails, website polls, and a song of the week. Guests Guests during the first six seasons of the show have included: * Dr. Rachel Naomi Remen, author of New York Times bestseller Kitchen Table Wisdom: Stories That Heal * Dr. Elissa Ely: Psychiatrist, Op-Ed Columnist for The New York Times and The Boston Globe, Former National Public Radio Contributor * Tracy Kidder: Pulitzer Prize winning American author of Mountains Beyond Mountains: The Quest of Dr. Paul Farmer, A Man Who Would Cure the World and his latest book Strength In What Remains * Dr. Martin Makary: Chair of Gastrointestinal Surgery and Director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Surgical Outcomes Research.

The club was established in 1966, and features both junior boys, girls and senior men soccer teams. Pascoe Vale's home ground is at Hosken Reserve in Coburg North, but the senior facility is based at CB Smith Reserve in Fawkner. Pascoe Vale's club colours are blue and white. The club currently competes in the National Premier Leagues Victoria 2. History The first known Pascoe Vale Soccer Club was formed in 1932 by British migrants. In 1966, immigrants from Macedonia of Aromanian descent reformed the club. The new immigrants renamed the club to Pascoe Vale Pelister, after the mountain where their home village of Ni≈æepole is located.  Victorian State Leagues  The club made a surge through the Provisional Leagues in the early 1980s, achieving three successive promotions between 1982 and 1984, taking Pascoe Vale from Victorian Provisional League Division 4 to Provisional League 1. The club was again promoted in 1986, competing in the State Leagues for the first time in 1987. The club remained in Victorian State League Division 4 for the next six years until they were promoted to State League 3 in 1992, where the club spent the next nine years. In 2001, the club achieved promotion to State League Division 2 for the first time in its history. Despite coming close in 2003, losing to Langwarrin SC on penalties, and in 2004, losing to Kingston City FC again on penalties in the promotion playoff match, the club didn‚Äôt achieve promotion to State League 1 until 2008, when it won the State League 2 championship under the guidance of Luciano Trani. In 2011, Vitale Ferrante took over as senior head coach, taking over from George Karkaletsis after seven rounds. Pascoe Vale were promoted to the Victorian Premier League in 2012, finishing top of State League One, five points ahead of Port Melbourne. This was marked as the greatest achievement of the club, marking the next big step from a small family club to competing with some of the biggest clubs Australia has to offer. In 2013, Tomi Milardovic and Davey Van't Schip joined the club. South Hobart in a friendly at CB Smith Reserve on 17 December 2016  National Premier Leagues Victoria (2014‚Äìpresent)  In the newly formed National Premier Leagues Victoria, the new top tier of football in Victoria, Pascoe Vale finished 11th in a 14 team competition in 2014. Despite being tipped by some as relegation candidates at the start of the year, Pascoe Vale finished in 6th place in 2015, qualifying for the finals series. Pascoe Vale came up against Heidelberg United in the elimination final and progressed on penalties. Facing South Melbourne at Lakeside Stadium, Pascoe Vale conceded two late goals in extra time to go down 3‚Äì2. This semi-final finish was the furthest Pascoe Vale had ever reached in a top flight season. The 2015 season also marked the first season Pascoe Vale played out of their new home ground at CB Smith Reserve, a newly built $6.3m facility.http://www.cornerflag.com.au/cb-smith-underscoring-pascoe-vale- progress/ Prior to the 2016 season, Pascoe Vale announced they would adopt a new name and logo, proceeding onward as the Pascoe Vale Football Club. Their new logo was inspired by that of FK Pelister, tying back to their original namesake and humble origins. Pascoe Vale finished the 2016 season in 7th place, with Van't Schip scored 9 goals and taking out the club's Golden Boot award. In 2017, Pascoe Vale formed its inaugural senior women's team. Pascoe Vale's female participation doubled in 2017 to five female teams in total. The men's team finished the season in 7th place, just outside the finals series. Davey Van't Schip scored 17 goals to take out the club's Golden Boot award yet again and was only second in the league to Heidelberg's Kenny Athiu, who scored 21 times. Tomi Milardovic retired at the end of the season, after five seasons at the club. In 2018, Pascoe Vale finished the season in 4th place, qualifying for the finals series where it lost 2‚Äì1 to Oakleigh Cannons in the elimination final. Van't Schip was the top scorer for the third season running, this time with 15 goals, the fourth highest tally in the league. From January 2019, Pascoe Vale player Hakeem al-Araibi, a political dissident from Bahrain, was being held in Thailand pending deportation to Bahrain.This attracted much media attention and a campaign for his quick and safe return was spearheaded by the club, with support from Craig Foster. He was released in February of the same year after the government of Bahrain withdrew their extradition request, and arrived at Melbourne Airport on 12 February to much publicity. In June 2019, long-serving head coach Vitale Ferrante resigned after eight years in charge.

Platform 5 provides real- time arrival information for inbound Expo Line trains. Concourse located on the north side of East Broadway Platforms 1 and 2 are located in the Grandview Cut and provide Millennium Line service. Commercial‚ÄìBroadway (formerly two separate stations, Broadway and Commercial Drive) is a rapid transit station complex in Metro Vancouver's SkyTrain system in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It serves an elevated portion of the Expo Line and a below-grade portion of the Millennium Line. It is a major transit hub, with the most boardings of any SkyTrain station, and a terminus of the region's busiest bus route, the 99 B-Line. Location Commercial‚ÄìBroadway station is located just east of the intersection of East Broadway and Commercial Drive in East Vancouver, on the outskirts of Vancouver's Little Italy district. Part of the station is elevated over East Broadway, while another section is located deep within the Grandview Cut south of Grandview Highway North. The two sections are connected via a pedestrian overpass that crosses East Broadway. History Commercial‚ÄìBroadway station is a merger of two existing stations: Broadway station on the Expo Line and Commercial Drive station on the Millennium Line. Broadway station was built in 1985 on the original Expo Line. It has been one of the system's busiest stations and in 2002 became a transfer point to the Millennium Line via the connected Commercial Drive station. Commercial Drive station was built in 2002 as the temporary terminus of the first segment of the Millennium Line, with connections to the Expo Line's Broadway station. The Millennium Line has since been extended westward, and out of the Grandview Cut, by , to terminate at VCC‚ÄìClark station. In November 2008, renovations began on Broadway station, including the addition of a new entrance on the south side of the station from 10th Avenue, the replacement and relocation of the station's elevator, and the refitting of the original metal mesh paneling on the ground level with glass. These upgrades were completed in October 2009. Both stations were formally merged and renamed on September 7, 2009, due to concern over potential confusion with Broadway‚ÄìCity Hall station of the then-new Canada Line. Commercial Drive became platforms 1 and 2 of the new station, while Broadway became platforms 3 and 4. Prior to October 22, 2016, the station was one of only four in the world where the same metro line (in this case, the Millennium Line) ran through a station twice in a pretzel configuration, the others being the Serdika and Serdika II stations on the Sofia Metro in Sofia, Bulgaria, the Monument Metro station on the Tyne and Wear Metro in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, and Voorweg RandstadRail station on the Randstadrail in The Hague, Netherlands. Upgrades In conjunction with the Evergreen Extension project, major upgrades at the station began in the second quarter of 2015 to accommodate increased passenger volumes and enhance the passenger environment. Originally scheduled to be completed by mid-2017, these upgrades were completed and opened to the public on February 2, 2019. The upgrades include: * A new platform (platform 5) to the east of platforms 3 and 4, which improves passenger traffic on those platforms by providing extra platform capacity for Waterfront station‚Äìbound Expo trains. Waterfront-bound trains at this station open their doors on both sides, allowing all-door boarding and alighting. * Added weather protection and amenities for bus passenger waiting areas. * Access improvements within the station, including upgraded passageways, vertical movement, and entrances. * A new pedestrian plaza for the portion of the station south of Broadway. * A new bike parkade which accommodates up to 42 bicycles. Services *Commercial‚ÄìBroadway station is a major connection point for TransLink bus routes that run along Broadway, including the 9 trolley bus and the 99 B-Line, an articulated express bus with limited stops and direct access to the University of British Columbia. *There is an A&W;, a Shoppers Drug Mart, and a Blenz Coffee at ground level. *Prior to the upgrading of Broadway station between 2008 and 2009, the station contained the \\"Broadway Smoke Shoppe\\", \\"The Exchange\\", and the \\"Vancouver Ticket Centre\\", three small convenience and retail outlets introduced as part of a retail program established with the opening of SkyTrain in 1986. Station information Station layout Entrances * Commercial Drive and Broadway (north) entrance : located at the northeast corner of Broadway and Commercial Drive intersection, opened in 2002 in conjunction with the opening of Millennium Line. Passenger can enter the station from both the westbound (north) side of Broadway and southbound side of Commercial Drive. This entrance provides both up/down escalators and elevators to all 4 platforms, although both escalators serving platforms 1 and 2 may turn to the peak direction of travel during rush hours. * Broadway (south) entrance : the original entrance for the station, located at the southeast corner of the intersection, north end of platforms 3 and 4. The entrance opens toward the eastbound (south) side of Broadway. Escalators and elevators connect the street level with platforms 3 and 4.

She is a young noblewoman of Denmark, the daughter of Polonius, sister of Laertes and potential wife of Prince Hamlet, who, due to Hamlet's actions, ends up in a state of madness that ultimately leads to her drowning. Name Like most characters in Hamlet, Ophelia's name is not Danish. It first appeared in Jacopo Sannazaro's 1504 poem Arcadia (as Ofelia), probably derived from Ancient Greek ·Ω†œÜŒ≠ŒªŒµŒπŒ± (≈çph√©leia, \\"benefit\\"). Plot Hamlet, Act IV, Scene V (Ophelia Before the King and Queen), Benjamin West, 1792 In Ophelia's first speaking appearance in the play,Hamlet, Act 1, Scene 3 she is seen with her brother, Laertes, who is leaving for France. Laertes warns her that Hamlet, the heir to the throne of Denmark, does not have the freedom to marry whomever he wants. Ophelia's father, Polonius, who enters while Laertes is leaving, also forbids Ophelia from pursuing Hamlet, as Polonius fears that Hamlet is not earnest about her. In Ophelia's next appearance,Hamlet, Act 2, Scene 1 she tells Polonius that Hamlet rushed into her room with his clothing askew and a \\"hellish\\" expression on his face; he only stared at her, nodding three times without speaking to her. Based on what Ophelia told him, Polonius concludes that he was wrong to forbid Ophelia from seeing Hamlet, and that Hamlet must be mad with love for her. Polonius immediately decides to go to Claudius, the new King of Denmark and also Hamlet's uncle and stepfather, about the situation. Polonius later suggestsHamlet, Act 2, Scene 2 to Claudius that they hide behind an arras to overhear Hamlet speaking to Ophelia, when Hamlet thinks the conversation is private. Since Polonius is now sure that Hamlet is lovesick for Ophelia, he thinks Hamlet will express his love for her. Claudius agrees to try the eavesdropping plan later. The plan leads to what is commonly called the \\"Nunnery Scene\\",Hamlet, Act 3, Scene 1 from its use of the term nunnery which would generally refer to a convent, but at the time was also popular slang for a brothel.see Hamlet#Language Polonius instructs Ophelia to stand in the lobby of the castle while he and Claudius hide. Hamlet approaches Ophelia and talks to her, saying \\"Get thee to a nunnery.\\" Hamlet asks Ophelia where her father is; she lies to him, saying her father must be at home. Hamlet realises he is being spied upon. He exits after declaring, \\"I say we will have no more marriages.\\" Ophelia is left bewildered and heartbroken, sure that Hamlet is insane. After Hamlet storms out, Ophelia makes her \\"O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown\\" soliloquy. Ophelia by John Everett Millais (1852) is part of the Tate Gallery collection. His painting influenced the image in Kenneth Branagh's film Hamlet. The next time Ophelia appears is at the Mousetrap Play,Hamlet, Act 3, Scene 2 which Hamlet has arranged to try to prove that Claudius killed King Hamlet. Hamlet sits with Ophelia and makes sexually suggestive remarks; he also says that woman's love is brief. Later that night, after the play, Hamlet kills PoloniusHamlet, Act 3, Scene 4 during a private meeting between Hamlet and his mother, Queen Gertrude. At Ophelia's next appearance,Hamlet, Act 4, Scene 5 after her father's death, she has gone mad, due to what the other characters interpret as grief for her father. She talks in riddles and rhymes, and sings some \\"mad\\" and bawdy songs about death and a maiden losing her virginity. She exits after bidding everyone a \\"good night\\". The last time Ophelia appears in the play is after Laertes comes to the castle to challenge Claudius over the death of his father, Polonius. Ophelia sings more songs and hands out flowers, citing their symbolic meanings, although interpretations of the meanings differ. The only herb that Ophelia gives to herself is rue; \\"...there's rue for you, and here's some for me; we may call it herb of grace o' Sundays; O, you must wear your rue with a difference\\". Rue is well known for its symbolic meaning of regret, but the herb is also used to treat pain, bruises and has abortive qualities. Ophelia by Alexandre Cabanel In Act 4 Scene 7, Queen Gertrude reports that Ophelia had climbed into a willow tree (There is a willow grows aslant the brook), and that the branch had broken and dropped Ophelia into the brook, where she drowned. Gertrude says that Ophelia appeared \\"incapable of her own distress\\". Gertrude's announcement of Ophelia's death has been praised as one of the most poetic death announcements in literature.For one example of praise, see \\"The Works of Shakespeare\\", in 11 volumes (Hamlet in volume 10), edited by Henry N. Hudson, published by James Munroe and Company, 1856: \\"This exquisite passage is deservedly celebrated. Nothing could better illustrate the Poet's power to make the description of a thing better than the thing itself, by giving us his eyes to see it with.\\" Later, a sexton at the graveyard insists Ophelia must have killed herself.Hamlet, Act 5, Scene 1 Laertes is outraged by what the cleric says, and replies that Ophelia will be an angel in heaven when the cleric \\"lie[s] howling\\" in hell. At Ophelia's funeral, Queen Gertrude sprinkles flowers on Ophelia's grave (\\"Sweets to the sweet\\"), and says she wished Ophelia could have been Hamlet's wife (contradicting Laertes' warnings to Ophelia in the first act). Laertes then jumps into Ophelia's grave excavation, asking for the burial to wait until he has held her in his arms one last time and proclaims how much he loved her. Hamlet, nearby, then challenges Laertes and claims that he loved Ophelia more than \\"forty thousand\\" brothers could. After her funeral scene, Ophelia is no longer mentioned. Portrayal Mary Catherine Bolton (later Lady Thurlow) (1790‚Äì1830) as Ophelia in 1813, opposite John Philip Kemble's Hamlet In productions of Hamlet While it is known that Richard Burbage played Hamlet in Shakespeare's time, there is no evidence of who played Ophelia; since there were no professional actresses on the public stage in Elizabethan England, we may assume that she was played by a boy.Taylor (2002, 4); Banham (1998, 141); Hattaway asserts that \\"Richard Burbage [...] played Hieronimo and also Richard III but then was the first Hamlet, Lear, and Othello\\" (1982, 91); Peter Thomson argues that the identity of Hamlet as Burbage is built into the dramaturgy of several moments of the play: \\"we will profoundly misjudge the position if we do not recognize that, whilst this is Weiner Hamlet talking about the groundlings, it is also Burbage talking to the groundlings\\" (1983, 24); see also Thomson (1983, 110) on the first player's beard. A researcher at the British Library feels able to assert only that Burbage \\"probably\\" played Hamlet; see its page on Hamlet. The actor appears to have had some musical training, as Ophelia is given lines from ballads such as \\"Walsingham\\" to sing, and, according to the first quarto edition, enters with a lute.Q1 has the direction, \\"Enter Ofelia playing on a Lute...\\" The early modern stage in England had an established set of emblematic conventions for the representation of female madness: dishevelled hair worn down, dressed in white, bedecked with wild flowers, Ophelia's state of mind would have been immediately 'readable' to her first audiences.Showalter (1985, 80‚Äì81). In Shakespeare's King John (1595/6), the action of act three, scene four turns on the semiotic values of hair worn up or down and disheveled: Constance enters \\"distracted, with her hair about her ears\\" (17); \\"Lady, you utter madness, and not sorrow\\", Pandolf rebukes her (43), yet she insists that \\"I am not mad; this hair I tear is mine\\" (45); she is repeatedly bid to \\"bind up your hairs\\"; she obeys, then subsequently unbinds it again, insisting \\"I will not keep this form upon my head / When there is such disorder in my wit\\" (101‚Äì102). \\"Colour was a major source of stage symbolism\\", Andrew Gurr explains, so the contrast between Hamlet's \\"nighted colour\\" (1.2.68) and \\"customary suits of solemn black\\" (1.2.78) and Ophelia's \\"virginal and vacant white\\" would have conveyed specific and gendered associations.Gurr (1992, 193) and Showalter (1985, 80‚Äì81). Her action of offering wild flowers to the court suggests, Showalter argues, a symbolic deflowering, while even the manner of her 'doubtful death', by drowning, carries associations with the feminine (Laertes refers to his tears on hearing the news as \\"the woman\\"). Gender-structured, too, was the early modern understanding of the distinction between Hamlet's madness and Ophelia's: melancholy was understood as a male disease of the intellect, while Ophelia would have been understood as suffering from erotomania, a malady conceived in biological and emotional terms.Showalter (1985, 80‚Äì81). This discourse of female madness influenced Ophelia's representation on stage from the 1660s, when the appearance of actresses in the English theatres first began to introduce \\"new meanings and subversive tensions\\" into the role: \\"the most celebrated of the actresses who played Ophelia were those whom rumor credited with disappointments in love\\".Showalter (1985, 80, 81). Showalter relates a theatrical anecdote that vividly captures this sense of overlap between a performer's identity and the role she plays: Soprano Mignon Nevada as Ophelia in the opera Hamlet, 1910. The operatic version simplifies the plot to focus the drama on Hamlet's predicament and its effects on Ophelia > \\"The greatest triumph was reserved for Susan Mountfort, a former actress at > Lincoln's Inn Fields who had gone mad after her lover's betrayal. One night > in 1720 she escaped from her keeper, rushed to the theater, and just as the > Ophelia of the evening was to enter for her mad scene, \\"sprang forward in > her place ... with wild eyes and wavering motion.\\" As a contemporary > reported, \\"she was in truth Ophelia herself, to the amazement of the > performers as well as of the audience‚Äînature having made this last effort, > her vital powers failed her and she died soon after.\\"Showalter (1985, > 81‚Äì82). During the 18th century, the conventions of Augustan drama encouraged far less intense, more sentimentalised and decorous depictions of Ophelia's madness and sexuality. From Mrs Lessingham in 1772 to Mary Catherine Bolton, playing opposite John Kemble in 1813, the familiar iconography of the role replaced its passionate embodiment. Sarah Siddons played Ophelia's madness with \\"stately and classical dignity\\" in 1785.Showalter (1985, 82). Many great actresses have played Ophelia on stage over the years. In the 19th century, she was portrayed by Helen Faucit, Dora Jordan, Frances Abington, and Peg Woffington, who won her first real fame by playing the role.William Cullen Bryant & Evert A. Duyckinck (eds.), The Complete Works of Shakespeare, 1888 Theatre manager Tate Wilkinson declared that next to Susannah Maria Cibber, Elizabeth Satchell (of the famous Kemble family) was the best Ophelia he ever saw.Some aspects of provincial drama in the eighteenth centuryFrederick T. Wood English Studies, Volume 14, Issue 1 ‚Äì 6 1932 (p. 73) The American scholar Tina Packer argued that Ophelia is trapped within the imprisoning world of the Danish court, and only by losing her mind can she escape. Packer argued that Ophelia's problems stem from being too dutiful a daughter when she obeys her father in rejecting Hamlet and returning his gifts to him, as she is untrue to herself, thus settling herself up for her downfall. Frances MacDonald ‚Äì Ophelia 1898 In film Ophelia has been portrayed on screen since the days of early silent films. Dorothy Foster played her opposite Charles Raymond's Hamlet in the 1912 film Hamlet. Jean Simmons played Ophelia to Laurence Olivier's Oscar-winning Hamlet performance in 1948 and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. More recently, Ophelia has been portrayed by Anastasiya Vertinskaya (1964), Marianne Faithfull (1969), Helena Bonham Carter (1990), Kate Winslet (1996), Julia Stiles (2000), Mariah Gale (2009) and Daisy Ridley (2018). Themes associated with Ophelia have led to movies such as Ophelia Learns to Swim (2000) and Dying Like Ophelia (2002). In many modern theatre and film adaptations she is portrayed barefoot in the mad scenes, including Kozintsev's 1964 film, Zeffirelli's 1990 film, Kenneth Branagh's 1996 film, and Michael Almereyda's Hamlet 2000 (2000) versions. In Vishal Bhardwaj's adaptation Haider (2014), the character was portrayed by actress Shraddha Kapoor.

This involves the application of wireless networks, sensors, computational power, and data to improve the quality of densely populated areas: The term \\"urban computing\\" was first introduced by Eric Paulos at the 2004 UbiComp conference and in his paper The Familiar Stranger co-authored with Elizabeth Goodman. Although closely tied to the field of urban informatics, Marcus Foth differentiates the two in his preface to Handbook of Research on Urban Informatics by saying that urban computing, urban technology, and urban infrastructure focus more on technological dimensions whereas urban informatics focuses on the social and human implications of technology in cities. Within the domain of computer science, urban computing draws from the domains of wireless and sensor networks, information science, and human-computer interaction. Urban computing uses many of the paradigms introduced by ubiquitous computing in that collections of devices are used to gather data about the urban environment to help improve the quality of life for people affected by cities. What further differentiates urban computing from traditional remote sensing networks is the variety of devices, inputs, and human interaction involved. In traditional sensor networks, devices are often purposefully built and specifically deployed for monitoring certain phenomenon such as temperature, noise, and light. As an interdisciplinary field, urban computing also has practitioners and applications in fields including civil engineering, anthropology, public history, health care, urban planning, and energy, among others.  Applications and examples   Cultural archiving Cities are more than a collection of places and people - places are continually reinvented and re- imagined by the people occupying them. As such, the prevalence of computing in urban spaces leads people to supplement their physical reality with what is virtually available. Toward this end, researchers engaged in ethnography, collective memory, and public history have leveraged urban computing strategies to introduce platforms that enable people to share their interpretation of the urban environment. Examples of such projects include CLIO‚Äîan urban computing system that came out of the Collective City Memory of Oulu study‚Äîwhich \\"allows people to share personal memories, context annotate them and relate them with city landmarks, thus creating the collective city memory.\\" and the Cleveland Historical project which aims to create a shared history of the city by allowing people to contribute stories through their own digital devices. Energy consumption Energy consumption and pollution throughout the world is heavily impacted by urban transportation. In an effort to better utilize and update current infrastructures, researchers have used urban computing to better understand gas emissions by conducting field studies using GPS data from a sample of vehicles, refueling data from gas stations, and self-reporting online participants. From this, knowledge of the density and speed of traffic traversing a city's road network can be used to suggest cost-efficient driving routes, and identify road segments where gas has been significantly wasted. Information and predictions of pollution density gathered in this way could also be used to generate localized air quality alerts. Additionally, these data could produce estimates of gas stations‚Äô wait times to suggest more efficient stops, as well as give a geographic view of the efficiency of gas station placement. Health Smart phones, tablets, smart watches, and other mobile computing devices can provide information beyond simple communication and entertainment. In regards to public and personal health, organizations like the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) have taken to Twitter and other social media platforms, to provide rapid dissemination of disease outbreaks, medical discoveries, and other news. Beyond simply tracking the spread of disease, urban computing can even help predict it. A study by Jeremy Ginsberg et al. discovered that flu-related search queries serve as a reliable indicator of a future outbreak, thus allowing for the tracking of flu outbreaks based on the geographic location of such flu-related searches. This discovery spurred a collaboration between the CDC and Google to create a map of predicted flu outbreaks based on this data. Urban computing can also be used to track and predict pollution in certain areas. Research involving the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) and conditional random fields (CRF) has shown that air pollution for a large area can be predicted based on the data from a small number of air pollution monitoring stations. These findings can be used to track air pollution and to prevent the adverse health effects in cities already struggling with high pollution. On days when air pollution is especially high, for example, there could be a system in place to alert residents to particularly dangerous areas.  Social Interaction Mobile computing platforms can be used to facilitate social interaction. In the context of urban computing, the ability to place proximity beacons in the environment, the density of population, and infrastructure available enables digitally facilitated interaction. Paulos and Goodman's paper The Familiar Stranger introduces several categories of interaction ranging from family to strangers and interactions ranging from personal to in passing. Social interactions can be facilitated by purpose-built devices, proximity aware applications, and ‚Äúparticipatory‚Äù applications. These applications can use a variety techniques for users to identify where they are ranging from ‚Äúchecking in‚Äù to proximity detection, to self-identification. Examples of geographically aware applications include Yik Yak, an application that facilitates anonymous social interaction based on proximity of other users, Ingress which uses an augmented reality game to encourage users to interact with the area around them as well as each other, and Foursquare, which provides recommendations about services to users based on a specified location.  Transportation  One of the major application areas of urban computing is to improve private and public transportation in a city. The primary sources of data are floating car data (data about where cars are at a given moment). This includes individual GPS‚Äôs, taxi GPS‚Äôs, WiFI signals, loop sensors, and (for some applications) user input. Urban computing can help select better driving routes, which is important for applications like Waze, Google Maps, and trip planning. Wang et al. built a system to get real-time travel time estimates. They solve the problems: one, not all road segments will have data from GPS in the last 30 minutes or ever; two, some paths will be covered by several car records, and it‚Äôs necessary to combine those records to create the most accurate estimate of travel time; and three, a city can have tens of thousands of road segments and an infinite amount of paths to be queried, so providing an instantaneous real time estimate must be scalable. They used various techniques and tested it out on 32670 taxis over two months in Beijing, and accurately estimated travel time to within 25 seconds of error per kilometer. Bicycle counters are an example of computing technology to count the number of cyclists at a certain spot in order to help urban planning with reliable data. Uber is an on-demand taxi-like service where users can request rides with their smartphone. By using the data of the active riders and drivers, Uber can price discriminate based on the current rider/driver ratio. This lets them earn more money than they would without ‚Äúsurge pricing,‚Äù and helps get more drivers out on the street in unpopular working hours. Urban computing can also improve public transportation cheaply. A University of Washington group developed OneBusAway, which uses public bus GPS data to provide real-time bus information to riders. Placing displays at bus stops to give information is expensive, but developing several interfaces (apps, website, phone response, SMS) to OneBusAway was comparatively cheap. Among surveyed OneBusAway users, 92% were more satisfied, 91% waited less, and 30% took more trips. Making decisions on transportation policy can also be aided with urban computing. London‚Äôs Cycle Hire system is a heavily used bicycle sharing system run by their transit authority. Originally, it required users to have a membership. They changed it to not require a membership after a while, and analyzed data of when and where bikes were rented and returned, to see what areas were active and what trends changed. They found that removing membership was a good decision that increased weekday commutes somewhat and heavily increased weekend usage. Based on the patterns and characteristics of a bicycle sharing system, the implications for data-driven decision supports have been studied for transforming urban transportation to be more sustainable.  Environment  Urban computing has a lot of potential to improve urban quality of life by improving the environment people live in, such as by raising air quality and reducing noise pollution. Many chemicals that are undesirable or poisonous are polluting the air, such as PM 2.5, PM 10, and carbon monoxide. Many cities measure air quality by setting up a few measurement stations across the city, but these stations are too expensive to cover the entire city. Because air quality is complex, it‚Äôs difficult to infer the quality of air in between two measurement stations. Various ways of adding more sensors to the cityscape have been researched, including Copenhagen wheels (sensors mounted on bike wheels and powered by the rider) and car-based sensors. While these work for carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, aerosol measurement stations aren‚Äôt portable enough to move around. There are also attempts to infer the unknown air quality all across the city from just the samples taken at stations, such as by estimating car emissions from floating car data. Zheng et al. built a model using machine learning and data mining called U-Air. It uses historical and real-time air data, meteorology, traffic flow, human mobility, road networks, and points of interest, which are fed to artificial neural networks and conditional random fields to be processed. Their model is a significant improvement over previous models of citywide air quality. Chet et al. developed a system to monitor air quality indoors, which were deployed internally by Microsoft in China. The system is based in the building‚Äôs HVAC (heating, ventilation, air conditioning) units. Since HVACs filter the air of PM 2.5, but don‚Äôt check if its necessary, the new system can save energy by preventing HVACs from running when unnecessary. Another source of data is social media data. In particular, geo-referenced picture tags have been successfully used to infer smellscape maps (linked to air quality) and soundscape maps (linked to sound quality) at city level.

The village was home to the Gatty family of Ecclesfield. Nicholas Comyn Gatty, son of the Rev. Reginald Gatty, was born in Bradfield, Sheffield, on 13 September 1874. He was educated at Downing College, Cambridge and at the Royal College of Music which is where he met and became a lifelong friend of Ralph Vaughan Williams, who from the 1900s spent many a summer vacation with the Gatty's at Hooton Roberts. In September 1902, Williams composed the song Linden Lea sitting in the rectory gardens, where the walls were covered with ivy, and on the lawn were croquet hoops. Williams often played croquet at Hooton Roberts. In 1897, the Hooton Roberts Musical Society was formed by the Gatty's. Nicholas played the harpsichord and the violin. His brothers Ivor and Ren√© were also involved with the Society. His first opera Greysteel, with text by Ren√© was performed in Sheffield on 1 March 1906 by the Moody-Manners touring company and at the Crystal Palace on 24 May, Lucy Broadwood, acting as guarantor. This was followed by the opera Duke or Devil, premiered in Manchester on 16 December 1909, again by the Moody-Manners company. This opera proved more successful, as did his next opera Prince Ferelon, which won a Carnegie Award. Gatty's other operatic works were: The Tempest, King Alfred and the Cakes, both with text by Ren√© Gatty. His orchestral works included a Concert Allegro for piano and orchestra premiered at the Proms in 1901 and a set of Variations on Old King Cole. In October 1972, a Festival was held at Hooton Roberts ‚Äì the Vaughan Williams Festival . Gatty's Mass for four voices was performed here.

The first Earl of Strafford's widow lived at the manor house and, when she died in 1688 at the age of 83, she was buried secretly by torch light in the chancel of the church. There is a memorial to her husband at Wentworth Woodhouse, where he was thought to have been buried. However, in 1895, when work was being carried out near the altar in St John's, three unknown skeletons were found, one appearing to be headless. They were thought to be the Earl, his wife and 16-year-old daughter, who had rickets, as one of the skeletons had signs of this disease. Strafford, (1593‚Äì1641) from a great Yorkshire family, was chief adviser of Charles I.

He played progressive punk/rock music in the late 1960s with the band Red Noise, which recorded one album. In the 1970s, he composed music for a film and released one solo album, Bruits et Temps Analogues, in 1976. Biography Vian is the son of French jazz trumpeter and poet Boris Vian. His father, who died when he was 17, nicknamed him \\"Bisonnot\\", \\"little bison\\". He was born during World War II and had a turbulent childhood in various places after his parents divorced, spending a long period of time in England and going to boarding school in Switzerland. He first gained notability as a guitar player with the progressive rock/protopunk band Red Noise (which was associated with Ame Son); the band formed at the Sorbonne in 1968, and played its first show during the occupation of the university. According to Vian, these were exciting times: he later commented that in Red Noise's early days, \\"their concerts wouldn't end until the cops came.\\" The band released one album, Sarcelles - Loch√®res, in 1970. The group broke up after they got arrested for possession of hash in the Netherlands. Given the revolutionary times, the band split rather appropriately into a socialist and a Trotskyist section, the latter of which continued under the name Komintern. Sarcelles - Loch√®res was released on LP in 1970, and re-released on CD by Futura Records in 1996. In 1975, he composed some of the music for the film Hu-Man (starring Jeanne Moreau and Terence Stamp) by J√©r√¥me Laperrousaz. In 1976, he recorded a solo album, Bruits et Temps Analogues, on the Egg label, which was owned by Barclay Records and designed to present young and innovative musicians (it had Vangelis and Tim Blake under contract). He is included (like Ame Son, Komintern and Red Noise) on the Nurse with Wound list. Since 1976, little has been heard of Vian, though he gave an interview to L'Express in 2011, in which he talked at length about his father and his childhood. He lives in Apt, Vaucluse. In 2013, he again appeared in public for the opening of L'√âcume des jours, the 2013 movie based on his father's novel of the same name.

Geographically it is situated in the eastern ending of Alappuzha District and western part of Pathanamthitta District. The southern end of Kudassanad is on the verge of Kollam District (in fact Kudassanad formed a part of Quilon, which was the former name of Kollam, before it was transferred to the jurisdiction of Alappuzha District). Part of Palamel Panchayat and Mavelikara Taluk, Kudassanad comes under the Mavelikara Parliamentary and Mavelikara Assembly Constituencies. Kudassanad is encompassed by hills and valleys, paddy fields, rivulets and streams, as well as country roads that pass through rubber plantations and dales.  How to reach Kudassanad Village  Kudassanad borders two districts ‚Äì Alappuzha and Pathanamthitta - thus spanning on both districts. If you are coming via Alappuzha, the ideal place to start the travel is Kayamkulam. NH 66 is passing through Kayamkulam Town and connecting Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi. From Kayamkulm one should travel to Nooranad on the Kayamkulam-Punaloor Road (KP Road): From Nooranad it just 5 km to Kudassanad. But if you are travelling through the Main Central Road (MC Road), connecting Cochin and Trivandrum, then the ideal place to step down is Pandalam. From Pandalam, it is just only 3 km to Kudassanad. Kudassanad is in middle of Cochin City (new name is Kochi) and Trivandrum City (in Malayalam language it is Thiruvananthapuram (both around 110 km). From NH-47 If you are coming through NH 47 Road (National Highway 47- which connecting Cochin & Trivandrum), first you have to reach Kayamkulam town. Then get a bus from there to Kudassanad (many private buses doing transport service in the route of Kayamkulam-Charumoodu‚ÄìNoornad (or Nooranadu) ‚ÄìKudassanad‚ÄìPandalam). Another option is get a bus (both Private & Public buses) from Kayamkulam ‚Äì Adoor, or any bus starting from kayamkulam, which going along KP Road (Kayamkulam - Punaloor Road) and step down in Nooranad town.

It is situated in the eastern end of Alappuzha District and western part of Pathanamthitta District. Southern side of this village is very near to the Kollam District. Administration Kudassanad village is part of Palamel Panchayat which is under the Alappuzha District. Kudassanad forms part of the Mavelikara Parliamentary and Pandalam Assembly Constituencies. The legendary M.N. Govindan Nair, Thoppil Bhasi and K.C. George - all veterans of the Communist movement - who stood in the forefront of the Vayalar-Punnapra struggle - have represented the constituencies in the 1950s and 1960s. Schools Schools in Kudassanad include N.S.S. Higher Secondary School (run by Nair Service Society), Government Lower Primary (LP) School and St Stephen's Public School (CBSE) run by St Stephen's orthodox cathedral. Demographics People are well-educated and live in inter-religious harmony. Many people from the township have migrated to Gulf countries, the United States and Europe for well paid jobs, which bring economic fortunes to the village. Till the mid-1980s there was good farming, which slowly reduced as most of the new generation were focused on academic and technical skills for their living. St.Stephens Orthodox Cathedral File:Kudassanadcathedral.jpg St.Stephens Orthodox Cathedral kudassanad is one of the most famous and ancient churches in Kerala. The church was founded 340 years ago. In the first phase a thatched house was erected with bamboos and wooden blocks. In the second phase a sturdier construction was raised with bricks and mortar and in the third phase a larger brick edifice with tiled roof and extensions on both sides as well as a portico in front was put up, of which the foundation stone was laid by H.G. Pulikkottil Joseph Mar Dionysius V on 20 January 1873; it was a small church in size. As this Church also became too small for the extended worshippers a fourth phase for the modernization of the church began as H.G. Daniel Mar Philoxenos, Metropolitan of the Thumpamon Diocese, laid the foundation stone on 22 January 1972, which was consecrated by H.H. Moran Mar Baselios Mar Thoma Mathews I on 23 January 1984, during which the Catholicos christened the mount on which the church is situated at St. Stephen‚Äôs Mount. Elevated to be a Cathedral on 22 April 1984 by H.G. Daniel Mar Philoxenos, the St. Stephen‚Äôs Cathedral is one of the most historically vibrant churches in central Travancore. Holy Relics of St.Stephen from Greece is installed here. Temples Kudassanad is situated on the threshold of Pandalam, where Lord Ayyappa, the presiding deity of Sabarimala grew up in the Palace of the King of Pandalam. Pilgrims to Sabarimala come to Pandalam for worship at the Valiya Koickal Temple before proceeding to Sabarimala. The annual ceremony of carrying the \\"Sacred Ornament\\" (Thiruvabharanam) to adore the deity in Sabarimala is a great religious event, in which hundreds of thousands of believers participate. Padanilam Parabrahma Temple is another temple near Kudassanad, which is just 5 km away towards the west side. Kudassanad is one of the 18 karas(Territory) of Padanilam Temple. Annually, people from Kudassanad bring Nandikeshan to Padanilam Temple on MahaSivarathri day. Infrastructure Though a small village, Kudassanad is self-reliant in almost all fields. It has modern infrastructure and state-of-the-art services: Anganvadi, Government LP School, one English medium School run by the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, one LP School run by the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church and one Higher Secondary School belonging to the Nair Service Society (NSS).

Long before globalisation came to big towns, Kudassanad had the Cable TV facilities, which can receive hundreds of national and international TV Programmes! Temples The natives, irrespective of caste and creed, are proud of their centuries old (Thirumani Mangalam Mahadevan) temple. Major Thirumani Mangalam Sree Mahadevar Temple is famous for the worship of Vishnu and Siva in same temple. The surroundings are very serene and the temple itself maintains the age old structure without much changes. Kudassanad is also sanctified by the presence of the ancient centuries old St. Stephen's Orthodox Syrian Cathedral, fondly called the Valia Palli. St. Stephen's Orthodox Cathedral is the patrimonial heritage of Kudassanad, which is one of the most famous churches in the Malankara Orthodox community in Kerala. St. Thomas Catholic Church, consecrated in 1944, is another church of worship, besides one Guru Mandiram which is dedicated for the great Sree Narayana Guru, who taught 'One Caste, One Religion, One God for man'. Literacy The literacy rate of Kudassanad, having a population of over 5,000 is admirable. The population density is 1144 per km2. 70 per cent of the population owns land. Economy Kudassanad also jealously guards the distinction of being the granary of Palamel Panchayat. Under the Kallada Irrigation Project (KIP), tributaries were constructed to release water to the Karingaly Paddy Fields spreading over in the upper Kuttanad region in times of drought; but as in every case, this noble attempt is scuttled by the lethargic, negligent and arrogant bureaucracy. Thus costly lives saving crops are damaged every year resulting in avoidable hardships to the farmers. Even on occasion the water is released, the heavy silting of the KIP canals due to lack of maintenance and clogging at different points have been affecting the free flow of water along various stretches of the canal leading to the Karingaly paddy fields extending to the geographical jurisdiction of Alappuzha and Pathanamthitta revenue divisions, comprising Kudassanad, Karimuckam Cherickal, Poozhickad, and Ulavuckad. It may be mentioned here that Basmati cultivation had successfully been initiated at the Karingaly paddy fields at the turn of the century. In addition to rice, vegetables, tapioca, black pepper, cashew nuts, mangoes, ginger, pine apple, coconut trees, etc. are also cultivated. Milk collection and distribution centres are a great boon to the villagers. A few families practice ducks and poultry farming. Brick manufacture is done on a small scale. Rice and flourmills take care of the work formerly carried out by housewives. There is also a daily market; bars, toddy, teashops, bakeries, grocery shops, and the like help the village to be self-sufficient. The mostly educated people, working abroad (Gulf Region, European Union, the U.S.A. and Canada) have brought fame and prosperity to the village, which has completely changed its facet, thus fondly earning the nickname \\"mini-Gulf\\". Kudassanad's system of commercial and cooperative banking includes one nationalized bank (State Bank of India) and some other private banks, including The Catholic Syrian Bank (CSB), and Kosamattam Financiers. These banks have branch offices in Kudassanad. Demand for Mavelikkara district. 25 March 2008 The demand for a new Central Travancore district with Mavelikkara as its headquarters is being raised once again. The demand, which was not heard for the last seven years or so, was raised by the Thiruvananthapuram-based Janakeeya Samithi led by freedom-fighter K.E. Mammen and Mavelikara MLA during a public function attended by Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan at Mavelikara on Monday. Pointing out that the demand for a separate Central Travancore district centered on Mavelikara or Onattukara was a long-standing one. The region also required more attention from Railways, he said, requesting Mr. Achuthanandan to pressurise Railways to establish a Mavelikara-Punalur railway line. The Janakeeya Samithi, on the other hand, submitted a memorandum to the Chief Minister citing the demand for the new district. Signed by Samithi director and general secretary, the memorandum recalled that Mavelikkara was the central hub pivotal to administrative affairs during the days of the Travancore monarchy. The place is now in Alappuzha district, but it has no connection with a coastal district like Alappuzha. So a new Mavelikkara district including Mavelikkara, Chengannur, Tiruvalla taluks and proposed Pandalam and Kayamkulam taluks will be a great boon to the people of Central Travancore  Politics  Political parties have a strong grip in the place, yet people are enough intelligent to choose representatives on their ability to satisfy the local needs than the emotional attachments to political parties. We can‚Äôt say that Kudassanad is biased to a specific political party.  Film location  Kudassanad invites cinema production units from time to time to shoot films in the area. Some of the movies filmed here include Kakkothikkavile Appooppan Thaadikal, Lal Salam (1990 film), Anadaram, aranaazhika neram and one well-known old black-and-white movie named \\"Pani Teeraatha Veedu\\", which starred Balan K.

He served as Bishop of Dallas from 1911 until his death in 1954. He remains the longest-serving Catholic bishop in the United States. Biography Joseph Lynch was born in St. Joseph, Michigan, to John Valentine and Veronica Jane (n√©e Botham) Lynch. His father came to the United States from Newcastle, Moynalty, County Meath, Ireland, in 1866, and his mother was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and immigrated in 1856. In 1887 he entered St. Francis Seminary in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. After graduating from St. Charles College in Ellicott City, Maryland, in 1891, Lynch studied theology at St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore. He changed his study to law and then practiced for several years near Chicago, Illinois. Lynch became acquainted with Bishop Edward Joseph Dunne, who convinced him to abandon his legal career and resume his seminary studies. He attended Kenrick Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri, and was later ordained to the priesthood on June 9, 1900. Lynch then served as a curate at Sacred Heart Cathedral in Dallas, Texas, until 1902, when he became pastor of St. Stephen's Church in Weatherford. He erected churches in Weatherford and in Handley. He was named the founding pastor of St. Edward's Church at Dallas in 1903. He there established a church, rectory, and parochial school. In June 1910 he became vicar general of the Diocese of Dallas. He was shortly afterwards made Apostolic Administrator of Dallas following the death of Bishop Dunne in August 1910. On June 8, 1911, Lynch was appointed the third Bishop of Dallas by Pope Pius X. He received his episcopal consecration on the following July 12 from Archbishop James Blenk, S.M., with Bishops Nicolaus Aloysius Gallagher and John Baptist Morris serving as co-consecrators, at Sacred Heart Cathedral. At age 38 he was one of the youngest members of the American hierarchy. Following the Mexican Revolution, he became an advocate on behalf of the Mexicans displaced to Dallas. He also erected a mission church for Mexican Americans in 1915. Known as the \\"Lion of Texas,\\" Lynch was a widely regarded orator and delivered the main addresses at the bicentennial of San Antonio (1931), the centennial of the Battle of the Alamo (1936), and the installations of several bishops throughout the country. He was named an Assistant at the Pontifical Throne on May 13, 1936. Lynch served as Bishop of Dallas for forty-three years, and currently remains the longest-serving bishop in the history of the Catholic Church in the United States. During his extensive tenure, he ordained over 100 priests and established 150 churches, the majority of which were built in places that had never had a church at all. He built a church for African American Catholics at Fort Worth in 1929. He also founded more than 200 religious and charitable institutions. During his episcopacy the Catholic population increased from 20,000 to 125,000, which necessitated the erection of the Dioceses of El Paso (1914), Amarillo (1926), and Austin (1953). Lynch died at age 81, and is buried at Calvary Hill Cemetery in Dallas.

Early life Eyre was born in Wiltshire, England, in the early 17th century, the son of Giles Eyre and Jane Snelgrove. The couple had ten sons and five daughters, John been the seventh son. The attended All Saints Church, Whiteparish, where Giles and Jane are buried. Their funerary memorial, located within the church, reads: > Buried here Gyles Eyre Esqre and Jane his wife.

In Ireland and Galway Eyre and his younger brother Edward were officers in the forces of the Parliament, Eyre rising to the rank of major. In 1649 the brothers arrived in Dublin as part an invasion force of 12,000 men led by Oliver Cromwell. They saw service mainly under the command of Edward Ludlow. Eyre is mentioned as one of the officers with Ludlow when he arrived at Galway in 1651. With the surrender of the town in April 1652 the war ended, and the brothers began securing much property seized from Irish Roman Catholics, within the town and also in other parts of County Galway. Much land was made over to Cromwellian officers who were owed substantial pay arrears. Eyre's main landed estates were in the south-east of the county, dispossessing families such as Kelly, Madden, Horan, and Burke. In this area, known in Irish as S√≠ol Anmchadha, Eyre created the town of Eyrecourt and his main residence. This continued to be the home of generations of the family. The Restoration and after John and Edward Eyre were both returned as members of the Irish parliament in 1661, and John moved strongly to help preserve the settlements that had allowed them to become men of substance. However, he was absent on a number of occasions, apparently due to a serious dispute involving his brother, and Robert Martin of Ross, back in Galway. In September 1661 John Eyre was appointed Mayor of Galway, Edward Eyre been re-appointed Recorder. Disputes between the Protestant settlers and Catholics attempting to regain lost property continued, members of families such as Browne, French, Martin, Lynch (see The Tribes of Galway) continued, but despite legal disputes that lasted years, none of them regained the substance of their property. In 1681, he was appointed High Sheriff of County Galway. Summing up his life, John Cronin states: > John Eyre played a not insignificant part in radically altering mid-to-late > seventeenth century Galway. ... he helped overthrow those landed Catholic > families that had previously dominated the region, and well as to establish > the supremacy of Protestant grandees within the area.

Loram provides track maintenance services to freight, passenger, and transit railroads worldwide, as well as sells and leases equipment which performs these functions.  Corporate history  Loram Maintenance of Way was founded in 1954 in Hamel, Minnesota, in the United States by Canadian businessman Fred C. Mannix. The company name is a portmanteau derived from the phrase \\"long-range Mannix\\". Loram initially acted as a contractor for railways, cleaning ballast on track beds. The rough edges of ballast rock not only supports the ties and holds them in place, it helps water drain away from the track bed. Over time, ballast becomes clogged with earth, weeds, and debris, inhibiting its drainage properties. Its major competitor in this field was Speno Rail Services (later owned by Pandrol- Jackson, and still later by Harsco Technologies). Over time, Loram replaced its large work crews with automated machines which can clean ballast in depth. LORAM Ballast Cleaner in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada on July 4th, 2019. The company's first mechanical products were the Mannix Sled and Mannix Plow, both developed in the late 1950s. The Mannix Sled was a device towed behind a locomotive which raised the rails and ties and cleared the ballast between the ties (a process known as \\"skeletonizing\\"). The Mannix Sled would be followed by a work crew which manually refilled the empty space with clean ballast. The Mannix Plow was a device which lifted both rails and ties, while three blades passed below them and removed all the ballast. This left the ties and rail lying on bare earth; a large work crew followed, lifting the rails again and replacing the ballast. The concept of lifting the rails and ties was counterintuitive, but it revolutionized railbed rehabilitation. In 1959, Loram introduced the Auto-Track. Designed to work behind either a Mannix Plow or a Mannix Sled, this device was capable to detaching a damaged or broken tie from the rail and ejecting it to one side. Loram began grinding rails in the 1970s. High rates of speed, traffic, and weight can damage rails. The burrs and cracks created can damage train wheels, slow traffic, and cause rails to degrade faster. Grinding rails in place helps to avoid these problems and lengthen rail life. While Speno had its crews living on its grinding trains, Loram did not. Its crews lived off-site while working, which meant Loram grinding vehicles were shorter and less complicated. Grinding carries with it a significant risk of fire, as sparks from the grinding process can ignite nearby vegetation. Loram's first grinders carried a caboose equipped with extensive firefighting equipment, and its crews were trained firefighters. The company later introduced an automatic firefighting system to its grinding vehicles, which eliminated the need for the firefighting caboose. About 1986, Loram introduced the SX-16, which could grind railroad switches (including switch points, frogs, and wing rails) as well as track. By 1992, Loram had more than a dozen grinders in operation in the United States. In the late 1990s, working with KLD Labs, Loram developed the VISion Transverse Analyzer (VISTA), a computer guided grinding system. The VISTA system employs lasers to identify the rail profile and any defects. The computer then chooses an optimal solution, and guides the vehicle as it grinds the rail to this profile. The system is captures removed metal and places it into a waste storage compartment rather than leaving it on the track. In the mid 2000s, Loram introduced the RG400 rail grinder, which doubled efficiency to roughly per day, was lower-emission, and had markedly improved safety features. A variation of this vehicle, the RGI series railgrinder, was developed specifically for the international market and has been sold in Colombia, India, Mexico, and in Scandinavia. About 1987, Loram introduced the Badger ditch digging vehicle. This machine, which rides on railroad rails, can reach up to to either side and dig a drainage ditch up to deep and wide. Since the 1990s, Loram has also been offering rail inspection services. Loram adapts commercial consumer vehicles for use on rails, and has developed a computerized, laser inspection system which compares the rail to a pre- determined profile in order to identify damage. Each rail is identified using its Differential GPS location. The rail inspection can be used to develop a unique railgrinding plan that will adjust grindstone speed, location, and number of passes required to fix the damage and achieve a new optimal rail profile. Loram also analyzes the removed metal to evaluate rail performance and grinding results. Loram introduced Railvac in 2000. This car can both clean and excavate cable trenches, pole footings, railroad crossings, and railroad switches.  Acquisitions  A LORAM C2103 railgrinder at work near Okehampton, Devon, in the United Kingdom In 2011, Loram purchased Tranergy Corporation, manufacturer of main line and railyard track friction lubricants and lubricant dispensers and switch lubrication devices. In 2014 Loram acquired a majority stake in, and in July 2016 fully acquired, British firm Rail Vehicle Engineering Limited (RVEL), a company based in Derby, England, which itself grew out of the collapse of FM Rail. It provides maintenance and overhaul facilities and operates specialized rolling stock. It was rebranded as Loram UK.  Current operations  Loram provides maintenance of way services to Class I and shortline railroads, rapid transit systems, and commuter rail systems worldwide. The Railway Supply Institute said in 2015 that Loram was \\"one of the leading suppliers of track maintenance machinery and services in North America and the global market\\". Every Class I railroad in North America uses its equipment, and it is widely acknowledged to be the industry leader in grinding equipment. Loram both leases and sells its equipment. Its leases with major customers usually last about five years. Railgrinding remains the company's core. As of 2015, its rail grinding vehicles included the RG 400 Series (for Class I and other railroads with heavy loads and traffic); the RGI Series (an RG 400 Series modified for the international market); the C44 Series (a rail grinder sold in international markets where clearance and axle weight are restricted); the RGS Series (a specialty railgrinder used on railroad crossings and switches); and the L Series (a lightweight railgrinder used for rapid transit and specialty rail, and which can be moved by flatbed truck).  Loram UK  The Derby site of Loram UK (formerly RVEL) has three workshops totalling over for the maintenance and heavy overhaul of traction and rolling stock.

His artwork helped establish the stereotype of the \\"macho stud\\" who was also homosexual, leading him to be called a \\"pioneer of a gay aesthetic\\". He was an influence on many later homoerotic artists, such as Tom of Finland. Biography Quaintance was born in Page County, Virginia, and grew up on a farm, displaying an aptitude for art. Even as a teen, Quaintance has been described as \\"obviously and actively homosexual\\", despite being closeted. At the age of 18 he studied at the Art Students League in New York City, where, as well as painting and drawing, he studied dance, which led to him meeting and briefly marrying Miriam Chester. In the 1930s, he became a hairstylist. His first art assignments were anonymous advertising work, but by 1934 he had begun to sell freelance cover illustrations to a variety of \\"spicy\\" pulp magazines, such as Gay French Life, Ginger, Movie Humor, Movie Merry Go-Round, Snappy Detective Mysteries, Snappy Stories, Stolen Sweets, and Tempting Tales. These were sold at burlesque halls as well as under-the-counter at discreet newsstands. These illustrations, which were clearly influenced by Enoch Bolles, were often signed \\"Geo. Quintana\\". In 1938, he returned home with his companion Victor Garcia, described as Quaintance's \\"model, life partner, and business associate\\", who was the subject of many of Quaintance's photographs in the 1940s. During that time he was art editor for Joe Bonomo, who published women's magazines such as Glorify Your Figure, Beautify Your Figure, and Your Figure Beautiful. In 1951, Quaintance's art was used for the first cover of Physique Pictorial, edited by Bob Mizer of the Athletic Model Guild. In the early 1950s, Quaintance and Garcia moved to Rancho Siesta, in Phoenix, Arizona, which became the home of Studio Quaintance, a business venture based around Quaintance's artworks. In 1953, Quaintance completed a series of three paintings about a matador, modeled by Angel Avila, another of his lovers. By 1956, the business had become so successful that Quaintance could not keep up with the demand for his works. Quaintance died of a heart attack on November 8, 1957.

Structure There are three major components to this test: (1) Experimental, (2) Social, and (3) Other areas. The score ranges from 200 to 880, although 90% of test-takers score between 440 and 760, with 50th percentile around 615.Graduate Record Examination Psychology Test Practice Book (2009). The average score on Psychology subject test is 577 at Master's level and 633 at Doctoral level.An article by Norcross et al. (2006) on Psi Chi website Test Item Development The questions used for the GRE Psychology Test are written by a committee of six faculty members (many who did not know how the test was designed until they were asked to join the committee) from various colleges and universities throughout the United States. Each member writes 15-20 test items each year, as well as, many other faculty members write and submit additional items. These items are then discussed by the committee over a three-day session. During this time, the members accept, reword, or reject the submitted items from the various faculty members. After the draft of questions are assembled, the test is then given to a GRE Sensitivity Committee to screen for items that may not ‚Äúrepresent ethnic minorities, women, people with disabilities, and other groups in a favorable light and [to ensure] that the items are not likely to offend anyone‚Äù (Kalat & Matlin, 2000, p. 25). While items are not put on the test as ‚Äúexperimental items‚Äù that will not be scored, point- biserial correlations and the percentage of students who answered each item correctly are examined after each test administration.Kalat, J.

Use in Admissions Some graduate programs do not require submission of Psychology subject test scores, whereas in other programs it is recommended or mandatory. Among those universities that do require Psychology subject test, the minimum requirements vary. For example, applicants for the Ph.D. program in Clinical Psychology at Hofstra University are required to have a Psychology subject score no lower than 65th percentile (about 660 points) Predictiveness of the GRE Psychology Test Based on data collected from 1986 to 1990, correlations were conducted between first-year graduate school GPAs and undergraduate GPA, as well as, various different GRE tests and subtests. The GRE Psychology Test shows to correlate better with first-year graduate school GPAs than does the GRE General Test (r = .33); the GRE Psychology Test correlates equivocally with undergraduate GPA correlations (both equal r = .37). However, it is also stated that a GRE subject test correlates with degree attainment only r = .21. While it has strong correlations with some facets of graduate school, overall it does not predict who will graduate and who will not.

The Command traces its organisational history to 1822, when Major General Jacob Jennings Brown, commanding general of the Army, initiated the General Recruiting Service.pp.54‚Äì55, Vandergriff For much of the rest of the 19th century recruitment was left to the regimental recruiting parties, usually recruiting in their regional areas as was the practice in Europe. Up to the commencement of the American Civil War two types of forces existed in the United States that performed their own recruiting: those for the regular Federal service, and those for the state Militia service. Due to severe shortage of troops after the first year of the war, conscription was introduced by both the Union and the Confederacy to enable continuing of operations on a thousand-mile front. The conscription was first introduced in the South by President Jefferson Davis on the recommendation by General Robert E. Lee on 16 April 1862. The U.S. Congress enacted by comfortable majorities the Enrollment Act of 1863, also known as the Conscription Act, on 3 March after two weeks of debate.p.56, Vandergriff As a result, approximately 2,670,000 men were conscripted for federal and militia service by the Northern states. The realization that volunteers could never again be depended on for service was clear in the post-war analysis, but the dependence on them prevailed until the commencement of the First World War when President Woodrow Wilson, arguing for America's exclusion from the European war, believed that there would be found sufficient volunteers to meet the nation's military needs. However, European experiences with industrial warfare prevailed, and two years later the US Congress passed the Selective Service Act of 1917.pp.57, Vandergriff There were two primary reasons for President Wilson approving conscription: he recognized the efficiency and equity of the draft over the difficult-to-manage system of inducting and training volunteers, and that by opting for conscription, he realized the possibility of blocking one of his leading political critics and opponents, former President Theodore Roosevelt from raising a volunteer force to lead in France.pp.58, Vandergriff The Act was however very selective in that \\"the draft ‚Äòselected‚Äô those men the Army wanted and society could best spare: 90 percent of the draftees were unmarried, and 70 percent were farm hands or manual hands.\\"p.58, Vandergriff Conscription was again used to create a war-time Army from a small peace-time professional cadre in 1941, which eventually numbered 8.3 million personnel. However, there was a society-wide support for the conscription during the Second World War, in part due to efforts of the National Emergency Committee (NEC) of the Military Training Corps Association led by Greenville Clark who became known as the \\"Father of Selective Service.\\" The Congress, faced with imminent need to mobilize, still took three months of debate until finally passing the Selective Training and Service Act (STASA) of 1940 in June. Nearly 50 million men registered and 10 million were inducted into armed forces under the Act. Although the STASA was extended after the war, it ended on 31 March 1947, and the Army had to turn to recruiting volunteers again, requiring and estimated 30,000 volunteers a month, but seeing only 12,000 enlisting.p.60, Vandergriff With the Cold War looming, the Congress authorized the Selective Service Act of 1948 to enable President Truman to provide for 21 months of active Federal service, with all men from ages 18 to 26 required to register. This Act was extended due to the start of the Korean War, and replaced by the Universal Military Training and Service Act of 1951 by revising the earlier Act. > The new Act extended the president‚Äôs authority to induct citizens for four > years, granted him the authority to recall reservists, lowered the draft age > to 18, lengthened the term of service to two years, and cancelled deferments > for married men without children. With the end of the Korean War, the draft remained in force, but became increasingly unpopular although it continued to encourage volunteers and selected the bare minimum of annual recruits. Repeatedly renewed by overall majorities in Congress in 1955, 1959, and 1963, its final extension in 1967 was also passed by a majority of Congress, but only after a year of hearings and public debate. The U.S. Army became an all-volunteer force again in 1973. During the years of the Vietnam War between From 1965 to 1973, there were 1,728,254 inductions through selective service.p.61, Vandergriff There was however a direct effect on public support for the draft that was high even after the Korean War to its low in early 1970s because > Draftees, who constituted only 16 percent of the armed forces, but 88 > percent of infantry soldiers in Vietnam, accounted for over 50 percent of > combat deaths in 1969, a peak year for casualties. Little wonder that the > draft became the focus of anti-Vietnam activism.pp. 23‚Äì50, van Creveld With these political consequences in mind in 1969 President Nixon appointed a commission, led by former Secretary of Defense Thomas Gates, \\"to develop a comprehensive plan for eliminating conscription and moving toward an All Volunteer Armed Force.\\" However, even before this commission submitted its report on 13 May 1969, President Nixon informed the Congress that he intended to institute a reform that would see the draftees replaced with volunteers in his Special Message to Congress on Reforming the Military Draft. In February 1970, the Gates Commission released its favorable AVF report, which stated that > \\"We unanimously believe that the nation‚Äôs interests will be better served by > an all-volunteer force, supported by an effective stand-by draft, than by a > mixed force of volunteers and conscripts; that steps should be taken > promptly to move in this direction.\\"p.10, Gates Facilitating the transition to an all-volunteer force, the Army created District Recruiting Commands (DRC) through the continental United States to direct the efforts of its recruiters among the civilian population. The DRC's became \\"Battalions\\" in 1983.  Recruiting brigades  United States Army Recruiting Command's brigades and battalions map USAREC consists of eight brigades: five enlisted recruiting, one medical recruiting, and two recruiting support brigades. Each enlisted and medical recruiting brigade consists of a number of battalions, with each battalion consisting of four to seven companies. Each battalion is commanded by a Lieutenant Colonel, and employees about 12 officers, 20 civilian support staff, and 250 enlisted Soldiers, the majority of whom work as on-production recruiters performing the bulk of USAREC's mission of providing recruiting support at offices throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and at U.S. military facilities in Europe, Japan, and South Korea.

He was a 12-letter man at East Tennessee State University, winning honors in football, basketball, and baseball between 1946 and 1950. He is also to be found numerous times in the Buccaneer record book. He was an outstanding quarterback in football and averaged between 15-20 points per season in basketball. A gifted passer, Vest held the Buccaneer record for most passes completed in a single game for years. He was a member of the All-Decade 1940s team as a quarterback and figured prominently in some of the better teams fielded by coach Loyd T. Roberts. Vest is a member of the East Tennessee State Athletic Hall of Fame. After leaving East Tennessee State, Vest coached high school football and turned out a 9‚Äì0‚Äì1 record with a St. Paul, Virginia team which had only 17 players on the entire squad. He coached at Greeneville High School in Greeneville, Tennessee from 1951 to 1953. After coaching football at Hanes High School in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, he became an executive in the insurance department of Wachovia and devoted much time to officiating. Vest official games in the Southern Conference and the Atlantic Coast Conference and worked in the Gator Bowl as a football official in 1964. For six years in a row he was an official in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) national championships in Kansas City. In 1965, he became an official in the American Football League (AFL). He was the referee for Super Bowl II between the Green Bay Packers and the Oakland Raiders. He wore uniform number 3 as a referee in the National Football League (NFL) during the 1970 and 1971 seasons. During a Monday Night Football game between the New York Giants and Philadelphia Eagles in November 1970, Vest wore bright blue gloves which were easily visible to the television audience. The NFL soon passed a rule all officials' gloves had to be black. That game is more memorable, however, for the antics in the broadcast booth, where Howard Cosell threw up on Don Meredith's boots and had to leave Franklin Field at halftime. Vest worked the 1970 AFC divisional playoff game between the Miami Dolphins and Oakland Raiders, and the 1971 AFC Championship Game between the Dolphins and Baltimore Colts. His crew for the 1971 season included umpire Frank Sinkovitz, head linesman Leo Miles, line judge Bruce Alford, back judge John Steffen, and field judge Tony Skover. Steffen replaced Bob Frederic from Vest's 1970 crew when Frederic was promoted to referee for 1971 to replace the retired Bob Finley. In June 1972 Vest was killed in a motorcycle accident at Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Chuck Heberling was promoted from line judge to replace Vest as referee, and the remainder of Vest's crew worked with Heberling during the 1972 and 1973 seasons. Heberling's line judge position was filled by Red Cashion.

Attribution to Mozart - time of origin Ludwig von K√∂chel, in the first edition of his catalog of Mozart's music, thought the Mass roughly contemporary with Lucio Silla and \\"Exsultate, jubilate\\" (1772-1773). Alfred Einstein thought its original composition to be closer to that of the sixth Serenade (1776) with his revision of K√∂chel's catalog in 1937. Otto Jahn, Franz Giegling and others thought it not to be by Mozart at all. The work was accepted as genuine by Walter Senn: he published the Mass as No. 5 in the Neue Mozart-Ausgabe in 1968. The earliest surviving score and parts, found in a cloister in Augsburg, Germany, were prepared by a copyist, with completions and corrections in Mozart's hand.Green 2002, p. 104 Senn assumes the Mass was composed in 1773, after Mozart had returned from Italy in March. Movements and orchestration The mass is scored for soloists, choir, strings and organ, the latter playing from figured bass. The setting is divided into six movements: # Kyrie Andantino, G major, 3/4 # Gloria Allegro, G major, 6/8 #: \\"Laudamus te\\" Andantino, 3/8 # Credo Allegro, G major, common time #: \\"Et incarnatus est\\" Andantino, E-flat major, 3/4 #: \\"Et resurrexit\\" Allegro, G major, common time # Sanctus Andante, G major, 3/4 #: \\"Pleni sunt caeli\\" Allegro vivace, 2/4 # Benedictus Andante, C major, 2/4 #: \\"Osanna\\" Allegro vivace, G major # Agnus Dei Andante, G major, common time #: \\"Dona nobis pacem\\" Allegro, G major, 3/8 References Sources * Jonathan D.

He served as the bishop of the Diocese of Toledo (1911‚Äì21) and the Diocese of Cleveland, Ohio (1921‚Äì45). Biography Early life and education Joseph Schrembs was born in the village of Wutzlhofen (since 1924 a township of Regensburg), Bavaria. One of sixteen children, he was born to George and Mary (n√©e G√§√ü) Schrembs. Shortly afterwards he and his family moved to Regensburg, where Joseph received his early education. In 1877 he came to the United States under the patronage of Bishop Rupert Seidenbusch, and enrolled at St. Vincent's College in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, where his older brother Rudesind had become a Benedictine monk. After completing his classical course at St. Vincent's at age sixteen, he taught at the parochial school of St. Martin's ChurchSt. Martin of Tours Catholic Church, Louisville, Kentucky in Louisville, Kentucky, until 1884. He was then accepted as a seminarian by Bishop Henry Richter of Grand Rapids, Michigan, who sent him to study philosophy and theology at the Grand Seminary of Montreal in Quebec, Canada. Ordination and ministry Returning to Grand Rapids in March 1889, Schrembs was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Richter on June 29, 1889. He then served as a curate at St. Mary's Church in Saginaw until 1895, when he became pastor of St. Mary of the Assumption ChurchSt. Mary of the Assumption Church in West Bay City, Michigan, where he preached every Sunday in both English and French. He was named pastor of St. Mary Church in Grand Rapids in 1900. St. Mary's parish was established in 1857 to meet the spiritual needs of the German population in the Grand Rapids area. While on a tour of Europe in 1902, Father Schrembs purchased a grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes, which is still present in the church. In 1903 he was named vicar general of the Diocese of Grand Rapids. During his tenure as pastor, St. Mary's school was used as a local relief station when the Grand River flooded in 1904, and in 1905, a new convent was built for the sisters. In January 1906 he was raised to the rank of Domestic Prelate of His Holiness by Pope Pius X. Under the direction of Monsignor Schrembs, collections were taken up for victims of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and in 1907 he presided over St. Mary's Parish Golden Jubilee.\\"Pastors of St. Mary's\\", St. Mary Catholic Church, Grand Rapids, Michigan Auxiliary Bishop of Grand Rapids, Michigan On January 8, 1911, Schrembs was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Grand Rapids and Titular Bishop of Sophene by Pius X. He received his episcopal consecration on the following February 22 from Bishop Richter, with Bishops Camillus Paul Maes and John Samuel Foley serving as co-consecrators. Bishop of Toledo, Ohio Shortly after his consecration in February, Schrembs was named the first Bishop of Toledo, Ohio, on August 11, 1911. Schrembs requested the Sisters of Saint Francis of Rochester, Minnesota send members to the Toledo area to work with the children of the Polish immigrants. Sister Adelaide Sandusky, directress of the College of St. Teresa and 22 other Sisters established a home in Toledo and began teaching in area schools. This community became the Sisters of St. Francis of Sylvania, Ohio Sylvania Franciscans From 1911 to 1921 Bishop Schrembs established thirteen new parishes and thirtythree schools. At Bishop Schrembs invitation, Visitation nuns came to Toledo in 1915 from the Georgetown (Washington, D.C.) Monastery.The Sisters of the Visitation, Toledo, Ohio In a September 27, 1914 sermon in Baltimore, before a meeting of the American Federation of Catholic Societies, Schrembs criticized the failure of the United States government to insist upon the protection of Catholics in Mexico.\\"Bishop of Toledo Demands That Something Be Done In Mexico\\", The New York Times September 28, 1914 During World War I, he served on the Administrative Committee of the National Catholic War Council.Poluse, Martin. \\"Archbishop Joseph Schrembs's Battle to Obtain Public Assistance for the Parochial Schools of Cleveland during the Great Depression\\", The Catholic Historical Review, vol.83, no. 3, July 1997The Elevator Constructor, Volumes 15-16, p.14, International Union of Elevator Constructors., 1918 Bishop of Cleveland, Ohio On June 16, 1921, he was appointed the fifth Bishop of Cleveland. Schrembs once described Prohibition as \\"fanaticism.\\" On June 12, 1924, he offered the invocation at the opening of the third day of the 1924 Republican National Convention; he characterized President Calvin Coolidge as \\"a chieftain whose record of faithful public service, and whose personality, untarnished and untainted by the pollution of political corruption, will fill the heart of America with the new hope of a second spring.\\"Official Report of the Proceedings of the Eighteenth Republican National Convention, published by the Republican National Committee (1924), pp. 125-26 In 1925 the body of St. Christina was presented to Schrembs by Pope Pius XI, and moved from its resting place in a Roman monastery to St. John's Cathedral. When physicist Charles F. Brush advocated birth control as a means of the \\"betterment of the human stock\\" and population control, Schrembs condemned his remarks, saying, \\"In older times we referred to humans as the human race, but according to this foundation we are being classed with the animals on the farm, the cow, the horse, the mule...According to this foundation, I have no right to be born, for I am the youngest of 16 children and God bless my mother for every one of them!\\" He promoted the cause for canonization of Kateri Tekakwitha. In 1927, Schrembs charged that a large group of \\"Godless Jews combined nationally and internationally in activities in the amusement world, the results of which were to menace public morality.\\" When fan dancer Sally Rand rode in Cleveland's St. Patrick's Day parade in 1937 next to a float dedicated to the Virgin Mary, Schrembs declared, \\"I am deeply humiliated and ashamed...[Rand's] inclusion does not represent the mind of the great Irish people.\\" Schrembs was given the personal title of Archbishop on March 25, 1939. In 1940 he placed Holy Redeemer Church in Cleveland under interdict for refusing to accept his appointment as pastor. During his tenure, he erected 27 parishes in Cleveland and 35 outside the city.

The PTLLS is currently the lowest of the teaching qualifications specifically for this sector of education, with others being the QCF Level 3/4 Certificate in Teaching in the Lifelong Learning Sector (CTLLS) and the QCF Level 5 Diploma in Teaching in the Lifelong Learning Sector (DTLLS) qualifications. Following successful completion of the PTLLS and upon achieving the qualification, an associate teacher would then have to take the more advanced CTLLS for the Certificate and after that the DTLLS for the Diploma. To achieve the certification, the learner/associate teacher/trainer does not have to be in a teaching role in order to be assessed, making it a very achievable certification and a suitable starting point for anyone wanting to become an educator. Assessment is in the form of a 'micro-teach' session and submission of assignments and portfolio of evidence. The Level 4 CTLLS, however, requires one to be in a teaching or training role in order to be assessed 'on-the-job', as well as through the submission of assignments and a portfolio of evidence. The PTLLS is the first stage of a PGCE (Post Graduate Certificate in Education) in Lifelong learning and is currently required prior to achieving the CTLLS and DTLLS to gain Qualified Teacher Learning and Skills (QTLS) status. It is a requirement that all teachers obtain the PTLLS award, or the equivalent, to be able to continue to teach in the further education sector in the UK. The PTLLS is in the process of being phased out along with the CTLLS and the DTLLS, and will eventually be replaced with the Award in Education and Training qualification at QCF Level 3, 4 and 5, respectively.

Several old documents show Garnkirk with various spellings including maps by Timothy Pont, Charles Ross, and William Roy. John Dunlop bought Garnkirk House in 1634. The house stayed in the family for many years. The Dunlops were well known. For example James Dunlop being a wealthy landowner opposed Thomas Muir and the congregation at Cadder over who appointed their minister. The house is now the clubhouse of the Crow Wood Golf Club. One gazetteer, Samuel Lewis, describes coal being hardly worth digging Auchinloch with some limestone quarrying with a works established at Garnkirk. There was some coal found at Garnkirk. There was a substantial fire clay works at Garnkirk, north of Garnkirk Station, on the Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway. It opened around 1831; their goods were sold around the world. The works manufactured products including vases, flower-pots and crucibles. It shut in 1901. Between 1897 and 1921 Garnkirk was the location of the Gartloch Distillery that produced grain whisky. It was sold as widely as America and New Zealand. Garnkirk Burn The Garnkirk Burn rises to the west of Stepps. It then runs through the Garnkirk Glen and flows north- east to meet the Bothlin Burn. The Bothlin Burn escapes from Bishop Loch, south of Gartcosh. It is joined by the Garnkirk Burn east of Davidston farm, just north of the M80. The Bothlin is without a doubt the Luggie Water's major contributing stream.

The attempted coup d'√©tat occurred in Morocco when a rebel faction within the Moroccan military attempted to shoot down an aircraft carrying the Moroccan king, Hassan II. The attempt was orchestrated by General Mohamed Oufkir, a close advisor to King Hassan. He was assisted by Mohamed Amekrane, commander of the Moroccan air force base at Kenitra. On August 16, four Northrop F-5 jets, acting on Oufkir's orders, intercepted Hassan's Boeing 727 as it returned from France. Reportedly, King Hassan grabbed the radio and told the rebel pilots, \\"Stop firing! The tyrant is dead!\\" Fooled, the rebel pilots broke off their attack. Hassan's plane, which had been strafed by air force jets, killing eight and injuring 40,Morocco: the Islamist awakening and other challenges. Marvine Howe, p. 111 landed safely at Rabat's airport. Background The coup occurred a year after another attempted military coup against Hassan II's regime. 250 rebels based in the Ahermoumou cadet training school attacked the king's palace on his 42nd birthday, killing 91 people and injuring 133. Oufkir had gained power after the coup in 1971, moving from the Minister of Interior to Defence. Many had believed he planned the first coup to facilitate this rise. Attack A Moroccan Boeing 727, similar to that involved in the coup On 16 August 1972, as Hassan was returning to Morocco from a personal visit to France, four air force pilots, flying Northrop F-5 fighter jets, attacked the Boeing 727. The planes shot holes through the fuselage, killing some passengers. One plane broke off, strafing a nearby airfield and killing many on the ground. Allegedly, the rebel pilots broke off their attack on the king's aircraft after the king himself grabbed the radio and told the rebel pilots, \\"Stop firing! The tyrant is dead!\\" Believing their mission to have been accomplished, the rebel pilots broke off their attack. Eight passengers on the royal jet were killed and 40 injured, however, the jet was able to land safely at Rabat airport. Aftermath Kenitra Air Base, where most of the rebellious air force officers were based, was surrounded and hundreds arrested. Oufkir was found dead of multiple gunshot wounds later on 16 August, ostensibly from suicide. Many of his relatives were imprisoned, not being released until 1991, speculated to be because of international criticism for possible human rights abuses. General Amekrane fled to Gibraltar after the coup's failure; he failed to receive asylum and was extradited back to Morocco where he was executed by firing squad.

Froila Ram√≠rez, also spelled Fruela or Froil√°n (fl. 11501202), was a Leonese nobleman and a member of the Flag√≠nez family. His power and influence lay chiefly in the heart of the province of Le√≥n and its west, but it extended also into Galicia and the Asturias. He was most active after the death of his father (1169/70) and more especially that of his brother (1185) until his own death, probably in 1203. Parents, marriages, children Froila was the second son of Ramiro Fr√≥ilaz and his first wife, In√©s (Agnes). He is first mentioned in a document dated 22 September 1150, whereby his father granted to him and his elder brother, Alfonso, the bridewealth he owed to their late mother. Froila married his first wife, Urraca Gonz√°lez, daughter of Gonzalo Fern√°ndez and granddaughter of Fernando P√©rez of the House of Traba, sometime before 28 September 1171. Froila had been raised at the court of Fernando P√©rez, for on 29 June 1170 he granted the monastery of San Esteban de Mor√°s (Morales) to Urraca \\"out of love for your grandfather, Count Don Fernando, who raised me, and because of faithful service when I was accepted by your father, Count Don Gonzalo\\". In the charter recording the gift, Froila does not indicate that he and Urraca were yet married at that time. Urraca died on 1 August 1190. By May 1198, Froila had remarried to Sancha Fern√°ndez, daughter of Fernando Arias and Teresa Berm√∫dez, a daughter of Count Bermudo P√©rez de Traba. His second wife was thus a second cousin of his first, both being descended from Count Pedro Fr√≥ilaz. Sancha was still living in 1234, when she donated land at Fresnedo to the Abbey of San Andr√©s in Vega de Espinareda. There has been some confusion about the number and maternity of Froila's known children. His known children were Teresa, Nu√±o (Munio), Mar√≠a, Diego, Ramiro, Rodrigo and Bermudo (Vermudo). The historians Mercedes Durany Castrillo and Francisco de Cadenas Allende both believed that all his children came from his second wife, Sancha. Nonetheless, the maternity of most can be pieced together from documents. On 8 September 1189, Froila and Urraca's daughter Teresa took part in the sale of some land in the Curue√±a valley to a canon of Le√≥n Cathedral named Pedro Spina for 80 maraved√≠es. In September 1203, probably after Froila's death, his second wife, Sancha, together with her children by Froila and three of Froila's children by Urraca, donated their share in the monastery of San Antol√≠n de Huerna that they had inherited to the monastery of Carbajal. Urraca's named children are Nu√±o, Teresa and Mar√≠a. In January 1211, Sancha donated the church of Villarroa√±e to the monastery of Santa Mar√≠a de Carracedo for the sake her soul and that of her late husband. It was witnessed by four of her sons: Ramiro Fr√≥ilaz, Diego Fr√≥ilaz, Rodrigo Fr√≥ilaz and Bermudo Fr√≥ilaz. On 9 February 1212, Sancha granted her possessions in Tibianes and Pereiro to the monastery of Sobrado, which was witnessed by her sons Ramiro and Diego. On 29 August 1230, Sancha and her children Ramiro, Diego, Rodrigo and Teresa made a donation the monastery of Sandoval on behalf of the souls of Froila and a certain Bernardo, a son of Froila's and Sancho. On 24 September 1234, she granted her land at Noguerosa to the same monastery and the act was witnessed by Diego. Diego was married to Aldonza Mart√≠nez de Silva. Religious activity Froila's religious patronage was diverse. He made early grants to the Cathedral of Santa Mar√≠a in Le√≥n (1174) and the Benedictine monastery at Sahag√∫n (1175). He and his first wife showed partiality to the military orders. In late 1171, Froila's wife Urraca donated some property at Revello near Villal√≥n to the Order of Santiago. He endowed the Knights Hospitaller in 1181 and 1184. Urraca supported the Hospitallers with a gift in 1182. In 1173, Froila and Urraca granted their property at San Miguel de Camino (Sancti Michaelis de Camino) and Val de Mazana (Valdemanzanas) to the Hospital of San Marcos. In 1188 he made a grant to the Cistercian house of Pe√±amayor. Urraca patronised the monasteries of Benev√≠vere and Meira in 1189. Royal service Froila was a loyal servant and occasional courtier of kings Ferdinand II and Alfonso IX of Le√≥n. Between 1182 and 1184, he served Ferdinand II as alf√©rez, overseeing the royal military entourage. This post was usually reserved for young noblemen at court, and may be an indicator of Froila's age or relative standing. Sometime before 11 August 1189, Froila was granted the title count (Latin comes), the highest noble rank in the kingdom. His father and his brother had borne the title before him. He thus transmitted the female title, countess, to his wives. On 9 April 1192, Froila received as a gift the village of Salientes from Alfonso IX pro bono seruicio (\\"for good service\\"). It was not the only village in his patrimony. The town of Cifuentes de Rueda had been in his family for generations. In May 1198, Froila and Sancha granted the town a fuero, a municipal charter spelling out the citizens rights and obligations. In 1196, Froila was considered a royal vassal. Tenancies Froila governed several tenencias (fiefs from the crown) in his career. Although these were not hereditary, several of the fiefs that Froila held for an extended period had been ruled by his father, grandfather or brother before him. As early as 1162, he was governing the Bierzo in western Le√≥n, probably on behalf of his father, who was its tenente continuously from 1147 until 1169. The first tenencia Froila received from the crown was Castrotierra in 1168. In 1169, shortly after his father's death, Froila received the tenencia of Astorga, which his father and his grandfather, Froila D√≠az, had ruled. The tenencia of Astorga conveyed limited powers in the city of Astorga itself, but substantially more in the surrounding region (its terra). He held Astorga until 1174. In 1185, it was granted to his brother Alfonso, but he died shortly thereafter and by 1186 it had been returned to Froila. He governed it for the next two years until 1188, when the death of Ferdinand II occasioned changes in the tenencias. In 1173 he held briefly the tenencia of Villamor. In 1180‚Äì81, he held the Bierzo jointly with his brother Alfonso. In 1186 he was appointed to the vast tenencia of Asturias de Oviedo, where his family's origins lay, and he succeeded Alfonso in the Bierzo. He was re-appointed to govern Oviedo five times (1187, 1189, 1192, 1193 and 1195), but the Bierzo was the centre of his power after the loss of Astorga in 1188. He held it until 1198 with a brief interlude (April 1188‚ÄìMay 1189), when it was held by Velasco Fern√°ndez. He also governed the smaller of Ulver (1190‚Äì92), Valc√°rcel (1190‚Äì93) and Villafranca (1189‚Äì94), all traditionally associated with the Bierzo. On the death of Ferdinand II in 1188, Froila was transferred from Astorga to the tenencias of Mayorga, Montenegro, and Sarria. The lands he governed for the crown were rapidly expanded during the early years of Alfonso IX. In 1188, he received the rule of Asturias de Tineo (retained until 1192) and in 1189 a host of other northwestern tenencias: Babia, Faro, Lemos, Monreal and Riba de Esla. Riba de Esla had been held by members of his family throughout the tenth and eleventh centuries. In 1191, Froila became governor of the towers of Le√≥n, the royal capital, a post, largely honorific, that had been held by his grandfather before him. In subsequent years he ruled the tenencias of B√©jar (1192), Almanza (1193), Valle (1194), and Toro (1197). Froila is last mentioned in a charter of 18 December 1202 and he probably died shortly after.

A man of great private wealth who expanded his landholdings through numerous purchases, he was able to marry royalty and maintain good terms with his sovereigns of Le√≥n as well as the rulers of Galicia and Portugal, whose territories lay immediately to the west of his area of influence. He also founded a hospital, a traveller's inn and a settlement that grew into a town.

Origins and service to Raymond of Galicia Fruela D√≠az's family tree. Fruela's origins lay in the Asturias, although his parentage is nowhere explicitly stated in surviving sources.Reilly (1988), 227. Ram√≥n Men√©ndez Pidal believed that Fruela was the brother of Jimena D√≠az, wife of Rodrigo D√≠az de Vivar, but this is unlikely.For Fruela's genealogy, cf. Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n, 29‚Äì30. In fact Fruela's wife was the sister of Ramiro S√°nchez, husband of Rodrigo's daughter Christina. It has been suggested that Fruela was a son of Diego Ans√∫rez and thus a nephew of Pedro Ans√∫rez, but this hypothesis has little to recommend it besides the patronymic D√≠az (\\"son of Diego\\"). Fruela's father was probably Diego P√©rez, a son of Pedro Fla√≠nez and Bronilde.Barton (1997), 245‚Äì46. His mother was Mayor (Mar√≠a) Fr√≥ilaz, daughter of Froila M√∫√±oz. A charter of the Cathedral of Oviedo, dated 5 April 1078, reads in part: \\"I, Mayor Fr√≥ilaz, known as Mar√≠a, at the same time with my sons named Fruela D√≠az and Antonio D√≠az, who are sons of Diego P√©rez and grandsons of Count Pedro Fla√≠nez ...\\"Ego, Maior Froilaz cognomento Maria simul cum filiis meis nominatis Froila Didaz et Antonito Didaz qui sunt filios de Dedagus Petriz et neptos comit√© Petro Flainiz, quoted in Margarita Cecilia Torres Sevilla-Qui√±ones de Le√≥n (1999), Linajes nobiliarios de Le√≥n y Castilla: diglos IX‚ÄìXIII (Salamanca: Junta de Castilla y Le√≥n, Consejer√≠a de educaci√≥n y cultura, ). The earliest surviving record of Fruela dates to 1069. His elder brother, Antonio, died young and Fruela, as the only surviving male child, inherited his father's estates.Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n, 30. The archives of Fruela's branch of the Flag√≠nez family were preserved in the monastery of Santa Mar√≠a de Oteros de las Due√±as, the only such case of a noble family's records being preserved from the Spanish high Middle Ages.They are now in the Archivo Hist√≥rico Diocesano de Le√≥n, though some documents have been misplaced or lost, cf. Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n, 30, who also provides an appendix of original documents and notices on pp. 35‚Äì40 and a facsimile reproduction of one on pp. 41‚Äì42. On top of this is conserved in the tumbo of the Cathedral of Santa Mar√≠a in Le√≥n (doc. 11, fol. 83) a brief genealogy of Antonio and Fruela, then children, as part of a diploma whereby their mother donated the monastery of San Pedro de Valdor√© to the cathedral in December 1073.Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n, 29 n23. The brothers are named Froila Didaci [et] Antonino [Antolino] Didaci. Fruela served Count Raymond of Galicia as majordomo, the highest court official, from 1094 to 1096 at least, and perhaps as late as 1106.A charter of 1 May 1106 appears to have been originally drawn up a decade earlier, cf. Barton (1997), 245 n6. He may have held the post throughout Raymond's countship (1090‚Äì1107), but insufficient surviving documentation does not allow the case to be proven. An analysis of the charters he confirmed for Count Raymond shows that he \\"was a regular member ... of the entourage that gathered around [Raymond] during the latter's circuit of Galicia in the late springs and early summers\\", but not a fixture at Raymond's court.Reilly (1988), 278. In the count's disputes with the king, Fruela openly took Raymond's side.Reilly (1988), 258. Fruela was prominent enough at the royal court, however, confirming a third of all royal charters given during the latter part of Alfonso's reign. Fiefs of the crown The fortified monastery of San Vicente del Pino sits on a hill overlooking Monforte de Lemos. Archaeological excavations in 2007 indicate that the Castro Dactonio likely stood on the same hill when Fruela founded the town at its foot in 1116. Both of Fruela's grandfathers were counts and by 14 May 1087 he also held that rank.He may have already been a count at the time of his first appearance at the royal court, on 18 December 1086, cf. Reilly (1988), 191 n13 and 227. Not long thereafter, in 1091, he was granted the fief (tenencia) of Valdeorras in Galicia, which he held until 1104.Fruela is recorded as comite imperante in lorres (the count ruling in lorres). The identification of lorres with Valdeorras was made by Augusto Quintana Prieto, cf. Reilly (1982), 292 n63. Such tenencias were held ad imperandum, to be governed and could be revoked by the monarch at any time. They were distinct from the count's private holdings, lands ad possidendum, which he owned and which the monarch could not alienate. The only other fiefs he held for more than a year or two were Sarria (1098‚Äì1103), Lar√≠n (1102‚Äì06), and the important episcopal city of Astorga (1107‚Äì17). The rule of Astorga probably carried limited rights in the city itself but extensive powers in the surrounding region.Reilly (1982), 292‚Äì93. It is with Astorga that Fruela is most commonly associated after 1107. On 10 April 1104, according to a royal charter now lost, Fruela and his wife founded a settlement at the foot of the castle called castro Dactonio in the fiefdom of Sarria on land owned by the monastery of San Vicente del Pino.Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n, 32. This settlement became the town of Monforte de Lemos, which Fruela held as a tenencia until 1111, when it passed to Rodrigo V√©laz. Late in his life Fruela briefly acquired the fiefs of AguilarAquilare, a place probably northwest of the Bierzo. (1111‚Äì12), Riba de Esla (1113), and Cifuentes de Rueda (1117‚Äì19). He also governed the Bierzo for a time, probably in 1115. In 1116 he made a donation of land at Puerto de Pajares to the Augustinian canons of the collegiate church of Santa Mar√≠a at Arbas del Puerto.As Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n, 33, shows, Fruela and his family did not found the monastery, as sometimes stated, but rather endowed a pre- existing establishment, then under an abbot named Sancho. This land, in the mountains of the Asturias, was intended for the construction of a hostel for travellers, which operated until as late as 1835. The full text of the diploma has now been lost, and it is suspected that it may have included a fuller will and testament, since Fruela was then in his old age.Speculation of Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n, 33. Marriage and private dealings Fruela married Estefan√≠a S√°nchez, daughter of Sancho Garc√©s, an illegitimate son of Garc√≠a S√°nchez III of Navarre, and his wife Constance. She possessed lands in the Rioja, near Calahorra, but may have sold these in order to purchase land more near to her husband's estates. They were married towards 1085, and on 11 September 1087 Fruela gave his wife arras.The charter is an original, but its location is nowadays unknown. The grant was confirmed by Fernando D√≠az, cf. Canal S√°nchez- Pag√≠n, 24. Her royal pedigree was mentioned in a grant of land in Astorga they received from Henry of Portugal on 1 March 1112, which included the Torre Cornellera and ten sections of the city wall.She was the eldest daughter of the eldest son of the eldest son of Sancho III of Navarre and Henry's grant refers to her as ex regali sanguine et prosapie horta (\\"of royal blood and family raised\\"), quoted in Barton (1997), 245 n4. She outlived her husband by at least ten years: on 18 April 1129 she granted a fuero to Villarmildo. The couple's children were Constance, Diego, Mar√≠a, and Ramiro. Fruela's patrimonial lands contained some of Spain's premier horse pastures, and he was able to give the queen a horse worth 5,000 solidi in 1116. The famous warhorse Bavieca was said, albeit wrongly, to have hailed from Fruela's lands. The above illustration is from c.1086. Fruela and Estefan√≠a were most active in acquiring property (gananciales) through private transactions between 1088 and 1113.The charters and the dates of transaction are listed in Barton (1997), 246 n19, who appears to list twenty-four, and the locations of the properties are found in Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n, 30‚Äì31, who lists twenty-two transactions concerning twenty-one places. With twenty-three such exchanges having left records, their case is one of the best preserved of its kind: private land transactions, especially aristocratic purchases from peasants, increased dramatically in Spain between the late tenth and early twelfth century.Cf. Barton (1997), 72‚Äì73. Some of the couple's early, eleventh-century property gains were of the form of loan repayments, though this type of transaction disappears from the record altogether in the twelfth century.Barton (1997), 76. In 1118 a certain Mart√≠n Eitaz, convicted of murdering one of Fruela's servants, was forced to become his servant for life or until released by a payment. Service to Queen Urraca Fruela was one of the magnates who witnessed the first recorded act of Queen Urraca, on 22 July 1109, and implicitly acknowledged her claim to have been granted \\"the whole kingdom\\" (regnum totum) by her father, Alfonso VI, shortly before his death.Urraca signed the document totius Yspanie regina (queen of all Spain), and she first put forward her claim about Alfonso's wishes in 1110; cf. Fletcher (1984), 127, who believes the surviving document to be the original. Among the other important persons who witnessed are to be found Bernard de Sedirac, √Ålvar F√°√±ez, Pedro Ans√∫rez, G√≥mez Gonz√°lez, and Pedro Fr√≥ilaz de Traba. This important document Fruela signs as legionensium comes (count of Le√≥n), a high- sounding title that was probably honorific and had long been associated with the Flag√≠nez. On 17 November 1110 he signed a document as comes in terra de legione et in gralare (count in the land of Le√≥n and in Grajal), perhaps a special authority associated with the breakdown of relations between Urraca and the King of Aragon, Alfonso the Battler, who was also her husband. In 1112 Fruela received a royal \\"gift\\" of estates at Ulvayo from the queen \\"for loyal service\\", and he repaid her generosity with the gift of a horse worth a magnificent 5,000 solidi, equivalent at the time to 5,000 sheep.Barton (1997), 82. Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n, 31, quotes the original source: uno kavallo obtimo valente V mille solidos (\\"one optimal horse worth five thousand solidi\\"). A horse worth so much could only be destined for the royal stables and royal rider, the queen herself, and it illustrates Fruela's enormous personal wealth.Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n, 31 and n24. The belief that Rodrigo D√≠az's horse Bavieca came from Fruela's lands is false. In 1115, when Urraca and Alfonso were fighting for control of the important monastic site of Sahag√∫n, Fruela was acting as count in Ceia (Ce√≥n) just to the north. On 9 December 1117 Fruela witnessed the second charter issued by Urraca's son Alfonso Raim√∫ndez, whom the Galicians had made co-ruler against her will in 1111. Although the language and the name of the notary may suggest that it has been interpolated, the document, made at Sahag√∫n, refers to Alfonso with the title imperator (emperor).Reilly (1982), 126. Death, burial and reputation The Pante√≥n wherein Fruela is reportedly interred has been called the \\"Sistine Chapel of Spanish Romanesque\\" for its well-preserved, high-quality ceiling frescoes. When Fruela died in the summer of 1119He last confirmed a document on 30 June, cf. Barton, 245. he passed Cifuentes on to his eldest son, Diego, who became alf√©rez of Alfonso VII in 1137 and died prematurely in 1040, leaving a daughter, Estefan√≠a D√≠az, who was disinherited by her uncle, Ramiro, when she married without his will.Barton (1997), 108. Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n, 34, considers Diego the younger brother. Ramiro then received Cifuentes. In 1198 Cifuentes received a fuero from Ramiro's son, Froila Ram√≠rez, and it remained with their family into the thirteenth century. Fruela's elder daughter Constance died in the flower of youth, while the younger, Mar√≠a, married twice: first to a Galician magante, Melendo N√∫√±ez, and second to the count Pedro Alfonso. Fruela and Estefan√≠a may have been buried in the Pante√≥n de los Reyes in the church of San Isidoro de Le√≥n amongst their relatives of the Flag√≠nez clan. Prudencio de Sandoval claimed to find the sepulchres of \\"the countess Estefan√≠a who endowed this church, and the count Don Fruela, a great knight in arms\\" among ten of their family in the third row of burials in either the main chapel or the Pante√≥n (it is unclear which). The identifying inscriptions, however, were already illegible in the time of Manuel Risco, and today Sandoval's conclusions cannot be verified.Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n, 33 and n34. Fruela's posthumous reputation can be gauged from lines 3000‚Äì3006 of the Poema del Cid (c.1140), where he is placed in the second tier of nobility, immediately beneath Alfonso VI, Henry of Portugal, and Raymond of Galicia, all of whom he served in his long career. This is the beginning of the \\"Cortes de Carri√≥n\\" passage:Quoted in Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n, 23. Available at Wikisource. { :Llegaba el plazo, querien ir a la Cort, :en los primeros va el buen rey don Alfonso, :el conde don Anric y el conde don Remond: :aqueste fue el padre del buen enperador: :el conde don Fruella y el conde don Beltr√°n.Also rendered el comde don Froila y el comde don Birb√≥n. :Fueron y de su reino otros muchos Sabidores, :de toda Castiella todos los meiores. :The time arrived, they wished to go to Court, :among the first went the good king Alfonso, :the count don Henry and the don Raymond: :that one was the father of the good emperor: :the count don Fruela and the count don Bertrand. :They went and from the realm many other Wise Men, :from all Castile all the greatest. |} Notes References *Simon Barton (1997), The Aristocracy in Twelfth-century Le√≥n and Castile (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press). *Jos√© Mar√≠a Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n (1986), \\"El conde leon√©s Fruela D√≠az y su esposa la navarra do√±a Estefan√≠a S√°nchez (siglos XI‚ÄìXII)\\", Pr√≠ncipe de Viana, 47:177, 23‚Äì42. *Richard A.

Expertise   Women's contribution to the economy  Hartmann believes women's part in the economy is split in two halves: work for pay and family care. Women are increasingly getting out of the home and into the marketplace but at the same time are still taking on most of the workload at home. In order to achieve equality for women, Hartmann argues that society needs to improve opportunities in the labor market and also make the ability of women and men to make work and home care more manageable.Hartmann, Heidi. \\"A Feminist Work and Family Agenda\\". Institute for Women's Policy Research. 2007. Print.  Employment  Hartmann argues women's employment progress has significantly increased over the past five decades. Women have entered occupations, that have historically been closed off to them and are able to contribute to their family income and the economy more than ever before. According to a 2014 report by Women's Policy Research, growth for women's occupations over the past seven years was strongest in professional and business services (42,000 jobs were gained by women). Despite all this, Hartmann still thinks that women's employment has a long way to go‚Äîsee Social Security and Wage Gap/Discrimination.  Social Security  Social Security provides many advantages as well as disadvantages for women, according to Hartmann's studies. In terms of advantages, it covers everyone (including women) that has worked at least ten years at a salary of $4,360 per year. It provides benefits to wives regardless of whether they have worked for pay or not, former wives (who had at least a ten-year marriage) and for widows. Social Security also is adaptive to inflation processes and does not discriminate against lower or higher earning women workers. Hartmann also makes note of disadvantages of the United States' current social security system that are particular to women. In 2013, Social Security cuts (known as Chained CPI) hurt women more than it helps them. Elderly women rely on Social Security for most of their income, because they have less access to other forms of income such as pensions and savings that men have more access too. Besides the recent cuts to benefits, years when women are caregiving are averaged as zeroes, which drag's down a woman's overall average income. Additionally, there are no benefits to caregiving outside of marriage, whereas the married caregiver can received spousal benefits from Social Security.  Wage gap/discrimination  Hartmann advocates greatly for equal opportunity in the labor market. In \\"Still A Man's Labor Market: The Long-Term Earnings Gap; Unnecessary Losses\\", Hartmann argues that the wage gap has a major influence on many aspects of family life‚Äîsuch as choices, poverty rates, single mother's ability to care for their children and older women's retirement rates. If women's wages were higher, Hartmann concludes that nearly all families with women earners would have a higher standard of living. She attributes the lower average earnings of women not to their preferences for low wage work, but because of the degree of sex segregation. Labor market discrimination leads to lower earnings for women, meaning women cannot pay for child care, which takes them away from their jobs to commit to their children, a commitment that in turn contributes to discrimination against them in the workplace.Hartmann, Heidi. \\"Still A Man's Labor Market: The Long-Term Earnings Gap; Unnecessary Losses: Costs to Americans of the Lack of Family and Medical Leave\\". Rep. Washington, D.C.: Institute for Women's Policy Research, 2013. Print. Hartmann recognizes the gender wage gap across all racial and ethnic groups. According to a 2013 report, women of all racial and ethnic groups earn less than men of the same group, and also earn less than white men. Hispanic workers have lower median weekly earnings than white, black and Asian workers, the lowest of any race/ethnic group reported on. Asian workers have the highest median weekly earnings‚Äîprimarily because of higher rates of educational attainment for both males and females.  Comparable worth  This concept, created by Hartmann, is grounded in her belief that equal pay for jobs of equal value. \\"The general goal of a comparable worth strategy is pay equity‚Äîequitable occupational wage rates that are not influenced by the sex, race, or ethnicity of the incumbents.\\" (Comparable Worth, 4). She emphasized a certain type of wage discrimination that arises when a firm is substantially segregated by sex and the two groups are not performing the same sort of tasks, but tasks that are of \\"comparable worth\\" to the employer (Women, Work, and Wages 9). Hartmann's exploration of comparable worth forced her to not only look into the issue of wage gaps between men and women but also the significance of gender bias/sex segregation in employment. She defines sex segregation in the workplace as the concentration of men and women in different jobs that are predominantly of a single sex. Hartmann works towards a goal of complete integration, with different proportions of men and women within every occupation identical to their representation in the labor force as a whole. She points out, however, that due to differences between men and women deeply rooted in certain cultures, this goal may take decades to reach. Therefore, an appropriate policy goal would be to eliminate barriers in the way of women's full exercise of employment rights.  Feminist scholarship   Patriarchy  According to Hartmann, patriarchy is defined as \\"controlling women's access to resources and their sexuality, which in turn, allows men to control women's labor power, both for the purpose of serving men in many personal and sexual ways and for the purpose of rearing children\\". Before capitalism, a patriarchal system was established in which men controlled the labor of women and children in the family, and that through this they learned the techniques of hierarchal control. Today, Hartmann argues the labor market perpetuates this hierarchal control. Low wages keep women dependent on men, encouraging them to marry. Married women must perform domestic tasks for their husbands, and thus men benefit‚Äîboth from earning higher wages and by not having to participate in domestic tasks.  Marxism and feminism  In 1979, Hartmann wrote the article \\"The Unhappy Marriage of Marxism and Feminism\\" in the publication Capital and Class. The article argues that \\"the marriage of Marxism and feminism has been like that between husband and wife depicted in English common law; Marxism and feminism are one, and that one is Marxism ... either we need a healthier marriage or we need a divorce\\". Hartmann argues that the attempts to integrate Marxism and feminism are not sufficient enough because they don't incorporate the feminist struggle into the larger struggle against capitalism‚Äîit places the concerns of class over those of gender. Hartmann believes Marxism provides good analysis but is sex-blind. She says the way that radical feminists describe characteristics of men- competitive, rationalistic, dominating- are much like the characteristics of capitalistic society. Therefore, it is in a capitalist society that it makes sense for people to look down on women as emotional or irrational‚Äîlooking at them as \\"dependent\\". Because of this, a feminism analysis is also necessary to describe the relations between men and women. She says that society must use the strengths of both Marxism and feminism to judge capitalism and acknowledge the present situation of women in it.  Double-bind dilemma  Women face a double-bind in many aspects of society, but in particular the economy. A woman is expected to work and provide for her family, while also making sure everything is taken care of in the home. In \\"Contemporary Marxist Theory and Practice: A Feminist Critique\\", Hartmann along with Ann Markusen argue that in order to overcome the issues feminist economists are working to correct (wage gap, discrimination in the workplace, and social security), the relation of women's reproductive processes to economic production need to be emphasized along with their importance to being a part of the actual work force. Hartmann also says that although a couple's share of work outside of the home has become more equal over the past thirty years, the couple's share of housework has hardly changed. In order to progress in the area of housework, the family needs to be understood not just as a unit of common ancestry but also as a location where conflicts regarding production and redistribution are sorted out. Conflicts of production deal with how housework is distributed, the standards for this, and who will work for wages outside the home. Conflicts of redistribution deal with how the money should be spent and who will decide this.  Awards and honors  Hartmann has won various awards. In 1994, she won the MacArthur Fellowship Award‚Äîa five-year grant from the MacArthur Foundation give to individuals who show exceptional creativity for their research and the prospect for more in the future‚Äîfor her work on women and economics. She is also the recipient of two honorary degrees.  Selected bibliography  ;Thesis * ;Books  Assembly of Behavioral and Social Sciences (U.S.).

He had previously served as Head of Penitentiary Department of Ministry of Justice of Georgia (2005‚Äì2008) and Minister of Defense (August 27, 2009 ‚Äì July 4, 2012). On September 20, 2012, amid protests against torture and rapes in Georgian prisons, the Ministry of Internal Affairs announced Akhalaia had resigned from office. Early career Akhalaia graduated from the Tbilisi State University with a degree in Law in 2003. From 2003 to 2004, he worked for the NGO Liberty Institute, known for his role in protests that led to the Rose Revolution in Georgia in November 2003.Bacho Akhalaia ‚Äì Biography. Civil Georgia.

In 2005, Akhalaia was moved to the post of Head of Penitentiary Department of Ministry of Justice of Georgia. In this capacity he led a struggle against the established system of \\"thieves in law\\" which ruled prisons in the post-Soviet country, but he was a frequent target of criticism by the opposition, some human rights groups and Public Defender Subari. In particular, he was accused of heavy-handed crackdown on Georgia's largest prison riot in 2006, in which 7 inmates died.Defense Minister Replaced. Civil Georgia. August 27, 2009 Akhalaia has been seen as a close ally of Saakashvili and the influential Interior Minister Vano Merabishvili. His brother, Data Akhalaia, headed Department for Constitutional Security at the Interior Ministry and his father, Roland Akhalaia, was a chief prosecutor of Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti region in western Georgia and the current member of the Parliament of Georgia.

Its stated purpose is to \\"register physicians and issue medical practice permits, develop and administer standards of practice and conduct, and investigate and resolve physician- related complaints\\". The CPSA also \\"provides leadership and direction on health and related policy issues\\".About Us: What we do, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta, accessed 2 November 2011. The organization was formed in Calgary in 1905. Background While still part of the Northwest Territories, the NWT Medical Ordinance regulated the medical profession in the geographic regions that became the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. Dr. James D. Lafferty served as NWT Medical Ordinance registrar from 1901 until 1905. On July 20, 1905, the Parliament of Canada passed the Alberta Act through which Alberta became a province of the Dominion of Canada. According to the Alberta Act, existing societies or associations that regulated the medical profession, dentistry, pharmaceutical chemistry and others, under the Northwest Territories (NWT) Medical Ordinance, were dissolved. On May 9, 1906, the Alberta Medical Profession Act was passed in the newly formed Alberta legislature. Lafferty had drafted the medical acts for both newly formed provinces‚ÄîAlberta and Saskatchewan. In 1906, the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta (CPSA) was founded in Calgary. The Canadian Medical Association's Alberta Division was formed later in the same year. The Alberta Division is now known as the Alberta Medical Association. AMA served as the educational body that also worked collaboratively with the CPSA on issues such as standards of medical care. On October 18, 1906, the newly elected Medical Council of Alberta appointed Lafferty as registrar. Dr. William A. Lincoln became a member of the Alberta Medical Association and was appointed secretary-treasurer in 1908. Disciplinary hearings The case of Aubrey Levin attracted international media attention, following the suspension of Levin's license by the CPSA in March 2010. Levin, who has been identified as an alleged abuser of human rights for his role as Chief psychiatrist and team leader at South African Defence Force (SADF)'s drug rehabilitation program near Pretoria in the 1970s, was \\"convicted of sexual assaulting three of his patients [in Alberta] between 2008 and 2010.\\" South Africa's post apartheid era, Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), had investigated the controversial nature of an SADF project that Levin ran while he was an SADF Colonel‚ÄîThe Aversion Project.url Levin emigrated to Canada in the late 1990s and refused to return to testify before the TRC. Levin denied that he had \\"any sexual motive or basis for [his] sexual offences\\" and that he was not \\"aware that what he was doing was a criminal act in Canada as it's allowed in his home country of South Africa.\\" On October 16, 2020 Wynand Wessels, a white orthopedic surgeon, told a CPSA disciplinary hearing that he had \\"tied a noose and taped it to the door\\" of an operating room at Queen Elizabeth II Hospital Grande Prairie, Alberta in June 24, 2016. Wessels denied that the noose had targeted a black surgical assistant‚Äîoriginally from Nigeria‚Äîwho worked in that operating room. Wessels said that he grew up in South Africa during the apartheid era without a free press, and was not aware of the racial connotations associated with the noose and lynching in North America. Those interviewed for a July 3, 2020 CBC News report said that the incident had been reported in June 2014, and complaints made since then, but the CPSA, the Alberta Health Services (AHS), and Tyler Shandro, Alberta's health minister had not followed through.

She came to public attention at the age of 12 due to her fashion blog Style Rookie. By the age of 15, she had shifted her focus to pop culture and feminist discussion. Gevinson was the founder and editor-in-chief of the online magazine Rookie, aimed primarily at teenage girls. Early life Gevinson was born in Chicago, Illinois, and was raised in the suburban town of Oak Park, Illinois. Her father, Steve Gevinson, is a retired English high school teacher. Her mother, Berit Engen, is a weaver and part-time Hebrew instructor who grew up in Oslo, Norway. Gevinson's father was born to an Orthodox Jewish family, while her mother, who was raised a Lutheran, converted to Judaism in 2001. Gevinson and her two older sisters, Rivkah and Miriam, were raised in the Jewish faith; she had a Bat Mitzvah ceremony. Gevinson was educated at Oak Park and River Forest High School in Illinois. Career 2008‚Äì2011: Style Rookie Gevinson started a fashion blog, Style Rookie, in 2008. The blog, featuring photos of the 11-year-old in distinctive outfits and her commentary on the latest fashion trends, began drawing nearly 30,000 readers each day. Her father \\"wasn't terribly interested\\" in her new hobby until she asked for his permission to be interviewed by The New York Times for an article about young bloggers. Because of the blog's success, Gevinson was invited to attend New York Fashion Week and Paris Fashion Week. She made overseas fashion-related trips to Tokyo and Antwerp, funded by Pop magazine, and was commissioned to write articles for Harper's Bazaar and Barneys.com. She styled a shoot for BlackBook magazine, acted as a muse and model for Rodarte's clothing line at Target stores, and partnered with Borders&Frontiers; to design and sell her own T-shirt.Bloggers turn designers... who's next? Catwalk Queen In 2010, she spoke at a marketing conference in New York and at Idea City, a Canadian version of the TED conference. There was a backlash to Gevinson's early success in the fashion industry. New York magazine questioned whether it was possible for Gevinson to write her blog without \\"some help from a mom or older sister\\". Sarah Mower of The Daily Telegraph, while conceding that Gevinson had a \\"truly independent, original voice\\", criticized her father for taking her out of school \\"to go to haute couture shows ... It's hard to imagine a kid being able to come back down to reality.\\" A Grazia fashion editor complained on Twitter that a large bow worn by Gevinson had blocked her view of a runway during fashion week. Anne Slowey of Elle felt her success was \\"gimmicky\\" and commented, \\"She's been thirteen for, like, the last four years.\\" Gevinson later remarked: \\"A lot of people on the Internet have a problem with a young person doing well. I felt like, there were people who were [at fashion week] because of their name, their money or their family, and I didn't have any of those things.\\" 2011‚Äìpresent: Rookie, acting roles, etc. In early 2011, Gevinson decided to stop writing primarily about fashion: \\"Lately I've been looking to other places for a creative outlet and for inspiration ... Now I'm more intrigued by mixing fashion with the other stuff I've been enjoying.\\" Gevinson's personal style also became less outlandish: \\"Before, dressing up was my outlet, and now I'm pursuing other creative things that take up a lot of time and energy, so in the morning I usually want to put on something simple and comfortable.\\" In the fall of 2011, at the age of 15, Gevinson founded Rookie magazine. The site was originally conceived of as a joint venture with Jane Pratt, but Gevinson ultimately decided to maintain sole ownership. Ira Glass acts as a mentor figure to Gevinson. The website focused on issues impacting teenage girls and was written mainly by teenage girls. It also featured guest contributors. A one-off print edition of the magazine, Rookie Yearbook One, was published by Drawn and Quarterly in 2012. In 2012, Gevinson spoke at TEDxTeen, with a focus on representation of women in popular culture, and at The Economist's World in 2012 Festival. She is also a contributing editor at Garage magazine. In November 2018, Gevinson announced that she would be shutting down Rookie due to the site no longer being financially sustainable. Gevinson first acted in a short film, First Bass, in 2008, but became more visible in 2012. That year, she voiced a character in the animated short film Cadavar, which was long- listed for an Academy Award. Cadavar was directed by First Bass's Jonah Ansell and co-starred Kathy Bates and Christopher Lloyd. In the film, she sang renditions of both Neil Young and Pet Shop Boys songs. Also in 2012, Gevinson filmed a role in Enough Said from director Nicole Holofcener. Gevinson is interviewed on screen in the 2013 documentary film The Punk Singer, talking about riot grrrl punk icon Kathleen Hanna.

It is published by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM). Jan S. Hesthaven is the current editor-in-chief, assuming the role in January 2016. The impact factor is currently around 2. This journal papers address computational issues relevant to solution of scientific or engineering problems and include computational results demonstrating the effectiveness of proposed techniques. They are classified into three categories: 1) Methods and Algorithms for Scientific Computing. 2) Computational Methods in Science and Engineering. 3) Software and High- Performance Computing. The first type papers focus on theoretical analysis, provided that relevance to applications in science and engineering is demonstrated. They are supposed to contain meaningful computational results and theoretical results or strong heuristics supporting the performance of new algorithms. The second type papers pay much attention to describing novel methodologies for solving a specific problem in computational science or engineering. The information about the application to orient other computational scientists is necessary. The third type papers more concern about novel design and development of computational methods and high-quality software, parallel algorithms, high-performance computing issues, new architectures, data analysis or visualization. However, the primary focus should be on computational methods that have huge impact on scientific or engineering problems. The modern numerical analysis can be dated back to 1947 when John von Neumann and Herman Goldstine wrote a pioneering paper, ‚ÄúNumerical Inverting of Matrices of High Order‚Äù (Bulletin of the AMS, Nov. 1947). This paper commonly is considered as one of the first papers to study rounding error and include discussion of what is called scientific computing nowadays. Although, from math history, numerical analysis has a longer and richer history, ‚Äúmodern‚Äù numerical analysis is defined by the mix of the programmable electronic computer, mathematical analysis, and the opportunity and need to solve large and complex problems in life applications. The need, such as, ballistics prediction, neutron transport, and nonsteady, multidimensional fluid dynamics pushed the development of computer and depended strongly on developments in numerical analysis and mathematical modeling.

She subsequently served as ARC C√≥rdoba (DT 15) in the Colombian Navy, until 1980; although scrapped, her hull and superstructure were re-erected in a leisure park near Bogot√°. Construction and commissioning Ruchamkin was laid down as the USS Ruchamkin (DE-228) on 14 February 1944 by the Philadelphia Navy Yard at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was launched on 15 June 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Mary Ruchamkin. The ship was reclassified as a and redesignated APD-89 on 17 July 1944. After conversion to her new role by the Duane Shipbuilding Corporation, she was commissioned on 16 September 1945 with Lieutenant Commander T. O. Weeks in command.  First period in commission, 1945‚Äì1946  After shakedown, Ruchamkin engaged in training exercises off the United States East Coast and in the Caribbean. She was decommissioned at Green Cove Springs, Florida, on 27 February 1946 and placed in reserve there on the St. Johns River in the Florida Group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.  Second period in commission, 1951‚Äì1957  After five years of inactivity, Ruchamkin was recommissioned on 9 March 1951. Based at Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek in Virginia Beach, Virginia, she participated in amphibious warfare training operations off Puerto Rico during the summer and autumn of 1951, then, in January 1952, departed Norfolk, Virginia, for her first Mediterranean deployment with the United States Sixth Fleet. merchant tanker Washington. Further amphibious exercises off the U.S. East Coast followed her return from Sixth Fleet duty, and, in August 1952, she conducted her first midshipman training cruise. Three months later, on 14 November 1952, while involved in fleet exercises off the Virginia Capes, she collided with the merchant tanker Washington. Hit portside in the troop compartment area, Ruchamkin lost seven of the troops embarked for the exercise. After repairs at Norfolk and refresher training off Cuba during April 1953, Ruchamkin resumed amphibious training duties. For the next year, she trained with United States Marines off the Virginia Capes and the Carolina capes and off Puerto Rico. In July 1954, she conducted another Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps midshipman training cruise. Ruchamkin departed Norfolk on 5 January 1955 bound for the United States West Coast. She transited the Panama Canal and on 23 January 1955 arrived at San Diego, California. For the next three months she participated in amphibious training exercises with units of the United States Pacific Fleet. In early May 1955, Ruchamkin retransited the Panama Canal and steamed for her new home port, Boston, Massachusetts. She arrived there on 27 May 1955, assumed duties as a United States Naval Reserve training ship, and for two years trained naval reservists of the 1st Naval District in port and at sea on weekend, two-week, and month-long cruises. Designated for inactivation in the spring of 1957, Ruchamkin was decommissioned on 13 August 1957 and berthed at Boston in reserve.  Third period in commission, 1961‚Äì1969  Ruchamkin was ordered reactivated in August 1961 to increase the U.S. Navys troop lift capacity during the Berlin Crisis of 1961. Recommissioned on 18 November 1961 and assigned to Amphibious Squadron 10, she completed shakedown and repairs and in April 1962 participated in a demonstration landing for President John F. Kennedy and subsequent antisubmarine warfare and amphibious exercises in Puerto Rican waters. Based again at Little Creek, Ruchamkin returned to a schedule of U.S East Coast and Caribbean exercises, the latter usually of two to three months duration. In November 1963, Ruchamkins schedule was interrupted for Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) at the Norfolk Shipbuilding and Drydock Company. The FRAM II overhaul was completed in June 1964, and she resumed her duties as primary control vessel in ship-to-shore amphibious movements, transport for underwater demolition teams and beach reconnaissance personnel, and antisubmarine warfare screening unit. In October 1964, Ruchamkin moved east to the coast of Spain, where she controlled the major portion of ship-to-shore movement during Operation Steel Pike I, the largest amphibious exercise since World War II. In November 1964 she returned to Little Creek and resumed amphibious and antisubmarine warfare exercises along the U.S. East Coast and in the Caribbean. In late April and early May 1965, Ruchamkin was called on to assist in the evacuation of civilians from the strife-torn Dominican Republic to San Juan, Puerto Rico. She then returned to the western coast of Hispaniola for patrol and hydrographic survey duties. For her work during the Dominican Crisis, she was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation. During the summer of 1965, Ruchamkin returned to a more normal schedule of exercises, but, from February to April 1966, interrupted those operations to act as primary support ship for four fleet ballistic missile submarines which were test firing Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missiles off the Florida coast. In October 1966, Hurricane Inez interrupted Caribbean exercises and Ruchamkin, assigned to relief operations, distributed food supplies to survivors in Haiti. During 1967 and into 1968, Ruchamkin continued her operations in the western Atlantic Ocean. Then on 27 July 1968, she headed east for a four-month deployment in the Mediterranean. There until the end of November 1968, she conducted hydrographic surveys along the coasts of southern Europe and North Africa. She was reassigned to Amphibious Squadron 6 while deployed to the Mediterranean. Ruchamkin was reclassified as an \\"amphibious transport, small\\", and redesignated LPR-89 on 1 January 1969. After Caribbean exercises in February and March 1969, Ruchamkin was assigned to support search operations being conducted by auxiliary repair dock , fleet ocean tug , and the deep-diving bathyscaphe off the Azores for the sunken nuclear submarine . In late August 1969, she moved north, conducted hydrographic survey operations in the North Sea until 20 October 1969, then headed back to Little Creek.

It was the first Canadian health insurance act to provide some public funding for medical services, and as such is considered to be an early step toward the provision of medicare in Canada. Origins In 1932, the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta prepared a brief for a commission on health care reform that had been established by the Government of Alberta. The brief was presented by Albert Ernest Archer, an early supporter of public health care in Canada. The commission subsequently established a prepaid health insurance program for rural areas, and an employer/employee program for urban centres, with the province paying two- ninths of the total costs.  Context  The Alberta Health Insurance Act of 1934 was first proposed by the United Farmers of Alberta (UFA). The legislation proposed to provide health care to the every province resident at an annual cost of $14.50 per person (Canadian Dollars). However, the Act was unable to pass before the UFA was defeated out of office by the Social Credit Party. The plan would require health care providers to provide specific services for the insured at no extra cost. These services included \\"full-time public health service\\", \\"complete medical service\\" (including major and minor surgery and obstetrics), \\"drugs and surgical appliances\\" if prescribed, limited \\"dental service\\", \\"private nursing service\\" (under special circumstances) and \\"hospitalization\\" (x-rays, operating room, lab services, etc.). Although this plan was not enacted, later in the 1940s and 50s, a national health care system became gradually more prevalent among provinces. Hospital insurance would provide federal funds to provinces that would implement a universal hospital insurance plan. The full implementation of such programs slowly developed and in 1969 Alberta adopted a universal health insurance program.  National vs. provincial government in Canada  Canadian health policies are co-financed by the federal government and provincial/territorial programs. Health care providers are mostly private, however, universal programs are implemented by the provincial government. The federal government's role is not only limited to financing, but it also regulates medical products such as pharmaceuticals, as well as funding medical research. However, the provincial government seem to play a bigger and more direct role as 47% of health care spending in Canada is provided for by them while 22% is provided for by federal transfers. With this large amount of provincial government spending in health care and other areas, the provincial government plays a large role in Canadian governing. Provincial government expenditure seems to be increasing and this may be attributed to the change in age distribution in Canada as this can cause a greater demand for more welfare in education and health care systems.  Reform  The Alberta Health Insurance Plan was revised by the year 2000. Statues of the updated plan included more details and laws specific to payment. It established that \\"extra billing\\" was not permitted by physicians or dentists; this means they could not charge or collect money from a patient that was in addition to what the Minister covered.Alberta Health Care Insurance Act. Queen's Printer (2000). Web. http://docplayer.net/1024636-Alberta-health-care-insurance-act.html Many argue that over time health care has become more decentralized from the national government and more focused onto local governments. Reay and Hinings contend that after 1994 with the establishment of Regional Health Authorities there is a greater amount of power not only provincial governments but also regional governments. By establishing these specialized fields to facilitate, it took a more business-like method. Although Canadian health care is highly prioritized when it comes to government spending, the total costs of health care administration is significantly less than the United States. \\"In the United States, health care administration cost $294.3 billion, or $1,059 per capita (Table 1). In Canada, health care administration cost $9.4 billion, or $307 per capita\\". Passage The United Farmers of Alberta (UFA) government passed the commission's recommendations as to the Alberta Health Insurance Act in February 1935. The party subsequently lost the 1935 provincial election, however, and the new government did not follow through with the insurance plan. Aftermath In 1948, the Alberta government passed legislation for a medical insurance program. This led to the establishment of Medical Services (Alberta), which was superseded by Canada's national medicare program in 1969.David Bly, \\"Western medical statesmen shaped Canadian health care\\", Calgary Herald, 14 August 2005, B4.

Adidas was known for this branding early in its history, with its owner, Adolf Dassler, describing it as \\"The three stripe company\\".  History  The 3-stripes mark was created by the adidas company founder, Adolf Dassler, and first used on footwear in 1949. In 1952, following the 1952 Summer Olympics, Adidas acquired its signature 3-stripe logo from the Finnish athletic footwear brand Karhu Sports, for two bottles of whiskey and the equivalent of 1600 euros. The Trefoil logo was designed in 1971 and launched in 1972, just in time for the 1972 Summer Olympics held in Munich.[ History] on Adidas-Group.com This logo lasted until 1997, when the company introduced the \\"three bars\\" logo (that had been designed by then Creative Director Peter Moore), initially used on the Equipment range of products. Designs for shoes registered in 1949 incorporated the three stripes along the side. Finnish sports brand Karhu Sports sold the three stripe trademark to Adidas for (the equivalent of) ‚Ç¨1,600 and two bottles of Whiskey.  Branding in sports  Scotland national football team jersey made by Adidas, with the classic 3 stripes In 1998, Adidas sued the National Collegiate Athletic Association over their rules limiting the size and number of commercial logos on team uniforms and apparel. Adidas withdrew the suit, and the two groups established guidelines as to what three-stripe designs would be considered uses of the Adidas trademark. In late 2004, rival sporting good manufacturers filed a complaint to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) over Adidas being allowed to exceed the 20 cm2 limit permitted for branding with the three stripes. Adidas argued that the trademark device was a design element rather than a logo and despite being an IOC sponsor, which led to accusations of Adidas receiving preferential treatment, the three stripes were banned by the Olympic movement starting with the 2006 Winter Games.Marketing Magazine However, Adidas circumvented the ban by using a modified three stripe design, combining them with the number 3, for the 2006 Games.Marketing Magazine In 2006 Adidas sued All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club (Wimbledon), other Grand Slam tournaments and the International Tennis Federation over restrictions on manufacturer's identifications placed on player clothing.Allbusiness.com  In popular culture  The musical artist Lady Sovereign references the Three Stripes trademark in her song \\"Hoodie\\" from the album Public Warning. The album was released in 2006 and had multiple remixes, again involving references to the Three Stripes trademark. Also the music artist Davay (Estonia) made a short hardbass song named \\"TRI POLOSKI\\" (literally meaning \\"Three Stripes\\") in 2016. Since the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Adidas or \\"the three-striped brand\\" has been the trademark of the Russian 'gopniks' ( a stereotypical gang member of the low-class villages of Russia, addicted to vodka and hardbass songs) and therefore being a major subject for hardbass.

Knowledge of the biblical period is mostly from literary references in the Bible and post-biblical sources. Religion and music historian Herbert Lockyer, Jr. writes that \\"music, both vocal and instrumental, was well cultivated among the Hebrews, the New Testament Christians, and the Christian church through the centuries.\\"Lockyer, Herbert Jr. All the Music of the Bible, Hendrickson Publ. (2004) He adds that \\"a look at the Old Testament reveals how God's ancient people were devoted to the study and practice of music, which holds a unique place in the historical and prophetic books, as well as the Psalter.\\" The music of religious ritual was first used by King David: according to the Larousse Encyclopedia of Music, he is credited with confirming the men of the Tribe of Levi as the \\"custodians of the music of the divine service\\".Hindley, Geoffrey. Larousse Encyclopedia of Music, Chartwell (1971), Ch. \\"Jewish Music\\" Historian Irene Hesk notes that of the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament, the 150 Psalms in the Book of Psalms ascribed to King David, have served as \\"the bedrock of Judeo-Christian hymnology,\\" concluding that \\"no other poetry has been set to music more often in Western civilization.\\"Hesk, Irene. Passport to Jewish Music: Its History, Traditions, and Culture, Greenwood Publishing (1994) p. 41 The study of ancient musical instruments has been practiced for centuries with some researchers studying instruments from Israel dating to the biblical period. Archaeological and written data have demonstrated clearly that music was an integral part of daily life in ancient Israel. Figurines and iconographic depictions show that people played chordophones and frame drums, and that the human voice was essential as women and men sang love songs along with laments for the deceased. Data also describes outdoor scenes of music and dancing in sometimes prophetic frenzies, often with carefully orchestrated and choreographed musicians and singers within specially built structures. According to ancient music historian Theodore Burgh, \\"If we were able to step into the . . . biblical period, we would find a culture filled with music . . . where people used music in their daily lives.\\"Burgh, Theodore W. Listening to the Artifacts: Music Culture in Ancient Palestine, T & T Clark International (2006) \\"Such music was capable of expressing a great variety of moods and feelings or the broadly marked antitheses of joy and sorrow, hope and fear, faith and doubt. In fact, every shade and quality of sentiment are found in the wealth of songs and psalms and in the diverse melodies of the people.\\" Cultural influences Egypt Egypt was among the oldest cultures of the Near East and had a highly developed musical culture dating back to around 3000 BC. Egyptian sources, however, include only pictorial relics, some instruments, and a few literary records concerned with performance practices. On various pieces of sculpture there are reliefs of harpists and flutists taking part in religious ceremonies and social entertainments. A number of instruments have been identified as being used in Egypt, including the lyre (a type of harp), an oboe-like instrument, various drums from Asia, the lute and the sistrum (rattle). Murals showing singers and instrumentalist performing have also been found. According to music historian Homer Ulrich, it is likely that Egypt influenced the \\"educational and ethical aspects of Greek music\\".Ulrich, Homer, A History of Music and Musical Style, Harcourt, Brace & World, Inc. (1963) Stephen Batuk equally observed that the historical link of music was consummated during the week of creation where birds in the air make sounds which could be seen as music. Sumer and Babylonia Although records are minimal, it is known that between 3000 and 2300 BC organized temple music with singers existed in Sumer and Babylonia, the oldest cultural groups in Mesopotamia. Excavations have uncovered several musical instruments, including harps, lutes, double oboes, and a few others. Because of the political interrelations between the Hebrews and the Semitic nations of Babylonia, Assyria, and the Hittite empire, there were similarities between the Hebrew music of the Judean people and the others. Jewish music began in the early years of tribal life, and the \\"references to music in the Bible are numerous,\\" writes Ulrich. After the Hebrews established a kingdom in Israel, their musical activities were to increase substantially. Ancient Israel 18th-century painting, \\"The Song of Miriam\\", by Paulo Malteis, Italy. Celebration after crossing the Red Sea from Egypt According to music historian Abraham Schwadron, \\"probably the most important musical contribution of the ancient Hebrews was the elevation of the status of liturgical music in union with ritual ceremonies.\\" He notes the \\"high degree of musico-liturgical organization\\" from the descriptive accounts of King Solomon's Temple, such as the 24 choral groups consisting of 288 musicians which took part in 21 weekly services.Schwadron, Abraham A. Music of Many Cultures: An Introduction, Ch. 16. Univ. of California Press (1983) Despite the similar instruments used by the Hebrews which were also used in neighboring cultures, including Phoenicia, Egypt, Assyria, and Greece, Schwadron writes that \\"it would be accurate to state that . . . it is in the particular uses of music‚Äîsacred and secular, ethical and aesthetical‚Äîthat ancient Jewish music made a unique contribution.\\" Music historian John Stainer notes that the earlier relationship between Abraham and the Canaanites \\"in all probability influenced future Hebrew music,\\" and which probably caused his posterity to carry a certain amount of Assyrian music or musical instruments into Egypt. He adds that a stay of four centuries \\"in so civilized a culture as Egypt must have largely added to their knowledge of the art.\\"Stainer, John, Music of the Bible, Da Capo Press (1970) lists and organises the skilled musicians who were to perform, or \\"prophecy\\", with cymbals, stringed instruments, and harps in the service of the Temple. Although the ancient music of the Psalms and the other Bible books (which were all chanted), is often thought to be lost, the Masoretic text of the Hebrew Bible contains cantillation marks indicating a melodic line for the words. Following the French archaeomusicologist Suzanne Haik-Vantoura, some authorities now argue that these cantillation marks date from temple times and record the music sung in the temple. Attempts have been made to decipher them in modern musical notation.Haik-Vantoura, Suzanne La musique de la Bible r√©v√©l√©e (Robert Dumas: Paris, 1976); Mitchell, David C. The Songs of Ascents (2015) Babylonian exile The musical traditions of the Temple were broken by the destruction of the First Temple and the exile of the Jews in Babylon during the 6th century BC. Hindley notes that most of the psalms seem to have been written in the years after the return of the Jews to Jerusalem. At this time too the practice of antiphonal singing between the cantor and the congregation seems to have become common. The music of ancient Israel represents almost fourteen centuries of change, roughly from 1300 BC to 70 AD, when Titus' siege of Jerusalem took place. Stainer points out the lack of many artifacts during this period. He concludes that the \\"sad lack of national monuments relating to the Jews is not surprising, when it is remembered that Jerusalem stood about seventeen sieges, each of which was accompanied by more or less destruction, and that, too, at the hands of victors who seemed to take a malicious delight in effacing the national characteristics of those they conquered.\\" Second Temple destruction However, after the fall of the First Temple, Werner states that the fabric of dreams spun about its earlier music included reminiscences, visions, and fantasies, as the Rabbis took pains to eradicate both its choral and instrumental traditions. \\"Their time had arrived, and their ideas on liturgy and music were radically different from those of the Temple priests.\\" Werner finds it paradoxical that modern day rabbis continue to praise the instrumental music of the Temple but prohibit any and all instrumental music in their synagogues today. The destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD led to the collapse of the Hebrew nation and the beginning of the Diaspora (dispersion or exile) of Jews to other lands, such as Spain, Italy, and the Rhineland. In these places, the synagogue would replace the destroyed Temple, with new liturgical services, prayers, and rabbinical writings oriented to mourning the loss of both the Temple and personal freedom. Christian period Fresco of angel playing a lute by Melozzo da Forl√¨. Very little is known about primitive Christian music, notes Whitcomb, because like most of the ancient, it was unwritten. As a result, as songs passed from generation to generation, they grew very different from the original. However, she notes that \\"much of this early music derived its beauty from the Greeks and its holiness from the Hebrews.\\" According to Ulrich, Hebrew music \\"was of direct and immediate influence on the musical practices of the early Christian church.\\" He cites Werner in noting that \\"the connections between Hebrew and Christian chant have been scientifically investigated and proved.\\"Werner, Eric. The Sacred Bridge, Columbia Univ. Press (1984) The musical art of the Levites, the Temple musicians who were named after their historic ancestors, was lost by the end of the 1st century. In 70 AD the Second Temple was destroyed by the troops of the Emperor Titus and in the years following the Levites along with the majority of Jews fled from Palestine. As a result, the synagogue music of the Dispersion lost the joyful character of that of the Temple and the large instrumental forces were dispensed with. The New Testament was not written until centuries later than the old and the music had attained much higher development, according to music historian Ida Whitcomb. As it related to Christ, it is called Christian music. However, there are but few allusions to it in three of the Gospels: in the Gospel of Luke, there are the \\"Angels' Song,\\" Mary's \\"Magnificat,\\" and Zacharias's \\"Song.\\" In Acts, Paul and Silas sing behind prison-bars: the prison is shaken, the doors fly open, and they are free. In the Epistles, there are but few references to music, but in Ephesians there is a \\"beautiful one,\\" in which Paul exhorts the churches to sing \\"Psalms\\" and \\"spiritual songs.\\" Hindley adds that antiphonal chants between cantor or priest and the congregation originated in Hebrew worship methods. At its peak around the beginning of the Christian era, the elaborate music of the Temple was performed by a large choir of highly trained men singers, with boys sometimes added, and during this period many instruments also were used by the Temple orchestra. Whitcomb adds that many of our noblest Church hymns have been suggested by the Psalms, which she notes was \\"the first hymn-book of the Hebrew nation and remains today not only the hymn-book of the Hebrew Temple, but also of the Christian Church\\".Whitcomb, Ida Prentice. Young People's Story of Music, Dodd, Mead & Co. (1928) Musical instruments Among the earliest pictographic signs found have been of a boat-shaped harp found on a Sumerian clay tablet dating back to 3000 BC, and an earlier depiction of this harp was also found in modern southwest Iran dating around 3200 BC. Bar Kochba coinage showing trumpets and a lyre, c. 132 AD Many relics of musical instruments have been found in Palestine dating from the Hellenistic age giving details about the state, character, and practice of liturgical music. In other cases, many musical instruments of the Hebrews mentioned in the Bible are identified by analogy with similar instruments found in other nearby cultures, such as Egypt and Babylonia. An example of some instruments mentioned in the bible can be found in Daniel 3:5: According to Jewish historian Josephus Flavius, all details of the First Temple, including its musical instruments, were made and viewed as \\"symbols of the universe\\", especially instruments like the kithara or lyre. In his Antiquities of the Jews, Josephus explains that the musical instruments, along with other matters of Jewish religion, represent a perishable \\"image\\" of the cosmos, or of \\"a cosmic Temple.\\" String instruments Lockyer notes that according to the Scriptures, Jubal was the father of harpists and organists (Gen. 4:20‚Äì21). He points out that the harp was among the chief instruments and the favorite of David, and its use is found more than fifty times in the Bible. It was used at both joyful and mournful ceremonies, and its use was \\"raised to its highest perfection under David\\" (1 Sam. 16:23). Lockyer adds that \\"It was the sweet music of the harp that often dispossessed Saul of his melancholy (1 Sam. 16:14‚Äì23; 18:10‚Äì11). When the Jews were captive in Babylon they hung their harps up and refused to use them while in exile, earlier being part of the instruments used in the Temple (1 Kgs. 10:12). Another stringed instrument of the harp class, and one also used by the ancient Greeks, was the lyre. A similar instrument was the lute, which had a large pear-shaped body, long neck, and fretted fingerboard with head screws for tuning. Coins displaying musical instruments, Bar Kochba Revolt coinage, were issued by the Jews during the Second Jewish Revolt against the Roman Empire of 132‚Äì135 AD Arch of Titus with silver trumpets In addition to those, there was the psaltery, another stringed instrument which is referred to almost thirty times in Scripture. According to Josephus, it had twelve strings and was played with a quill, not with the hand. Another writer suggested that it was like a guitar, but with a flat triangular form and strung from side to side. Wind instruments Among the wind instruments used in the biblical period were the cornet, flute, horn, organ, pipe, and trumpet. There were also silver trumpets and the double oboe. Werner concludes that from the measurements taken of the trumpets on the Arch of Titus in Rome and from coins, that \\"the trumpets were very high pitched with thin body and shrill sound\\". He adds that in War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness, a manual for military organization and strategy discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls, these trumpets \\"appear clearly capable of regulating their pitch pretty accurately, as they are supposed to blow rather complicated signals in unison.\\" Whitcomb writes that the pair of silver trumpets were fashioned according to Mosaic law and were probably among the trophies which the Emperor Titus brought to Rome when he conquered Jerusalem. She adds that on the Arch raised to the victorious Titus, \\"there is a sculptured relief of these trumpets, showing their ancient form. (see photo) The flute was commonly used for festal and mourning occasions, according to Whitcomb. \\"Even the poorest Hebrew was obliged to employ two flute-players to perform at his wife's funeral.\\" The shofar (the horn of a ram) is still used for special liturgical purposes such as the Jewish New Year services in Jewish communities. As such, it is not considered a musical instrument but an instrument of theological symbolism which has been intentionally kept to its primitive character. In ancient times it was used for warning of danger, to announce the new moon or beginning of Sabbath, or to announce the death of a notable. \\"In its strictly ritual usage it carried the cries of the multitude to God,\\" writes Werner. Percussion instruments Miriam and women celebrate the crossing of the Red Sea; Tomiƒá Psalter, 1360/63 Among the percussion instruments were bells, cymbals, sistrum, tabret, hand drums, and tambourines. Percussion instruments are those producing tones by being struck in various ways and have been used by bands and orchestras throughout history. The tabret, or timbrel, was a small hand-drum used for festive occasions, and was considered a woman's instrument. In modern times it was often used by the Salvation Army. According to the Bible, when the children of Israel came out of Egypt and crossed the Red Sea, \\"Miriam took a timbrel in her hands; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dance.\\" Singing Whitcomb writes that \\"much of the most beautiful music of the Bible is contained in the Psalms,\\" and the word \\"psalm\\" comes from the Greek word meaning \\"to sing, to strike lyre.\\" The psalter or psaltery was one of the instruments which accompanied the Psalm. The word soon came to signify any form of melody. The psalms were sung antiphonally or responsively, perhaps by the priest and congregation, or by two choruses. According to Shiloah, most of the customs and ceremonies mentioned earlier, such as weddings or other celebrations, were accompanied by music made by women and attests to the importance of women's songs. But there were many instances where women sang alone or with friends and family. \\"The woman fortifies her spirit by singing to herself, and perhaps to her infant, who hears and absorbs the mother's confessions, longings, complaints, and dreams.\\" There were also \\"mother-songs, soldier-songs, grass-widow-songs, orphan-songs, and woman's-trade-songs.\\" According to some, writes Shiloah, women's songs existed because of the need to compensate for the ban against public participation of women in synagogue rituals. Ancient music historian Joachim Braun notes that Philo had mentioned ritualist vigils near Alexandria, that included a meal and the singing of hymns by a double chorus as accompaniment to the processions and libations.Braun, Joachim. Music in Ancient Israel/Palestine, W. B. Eerdmans Publ. (2002) Dance According to biblical historian Amnon Shiloah, dance was directly associated with music and was an important aspect of various events, although the actual dance movements are nowhere described in detail. There is meager evidence about dance when compared with a wider variety found in Egypt. However, there are many biblical descriptions of occasions that inspired dancing in biblical times. In the Bible, Mishnah, and Talmud, dance is referred to in various contexts, and in Megido, the Negev, and other sites in Israel, recently found iconographic remnants show dancing figures. In Judg. 21:21, a festival is described during which it was customary to dance in the vineyards. Dancing was also associated with celebrations of military victories and for welcoming home heroes. In Exod. 15:20, Miriam and the other women burst into song and dance accompanied by drums to mark the parting of the Red Sea which saved the people of Israel; Jephtah's daughter danced to meet her father returning from victorious battles (Judg. 11:34); the women of Israel came out to dance before Saul and David upon their return from fighting the Philistines (1 Sam. 18:6); the king and his subjects were also inspired to dance when the Ark of the Covenant was brought up to Jerusalem (2 Sam. Ch. 6).Shiloah, Amnon. Jewish Musical Traditions, Wayne State Univ. (1992) Musical traditions Purposes of music The Bible mentions many uses of music including songs of praise, songs of victory, songs of mourning, and above all the Psalms. Dances were also a common music expression along with the combination of singing with instrumental music. During later times there was also a purely vocal music which prevailed for a period. According to Ulrich, music played an important part in both the secular and the religious life of the Hebrews. Kings and other leaders of the people were customarily acclaimed in songs and fanfares, and very elaborate musical services in the Temple, described in the Bible, were important parts of worship. There are, for instance, descriptions in the Bible of an orchestra consisting of nine lutes, two harps, and a cymbal. In other parts there are accounts of all-women choirs combined with singing and dancing to the men's percussion accompaniment. Werner adds that the choir's repertoire consisted of psalms, canticles, and other poetic passages from Scripture, although it may have contained some noncanonical texts. The choice of psalms is said to have been determined by God's activities on the first seven days of creation, and the verses which allude to them. Werner writes that \\"unique in the history of music is the firm belief in the purifying and sin-atoning power of the Temple's music, ascribed to both chant and instruments.\\" The music had to be free from blemish or fault, and avoided magical elements. Even the High Priest's garment had symbolism: (Exod. 28:34‚Äì35): \\"a golden bell and a pomegranate, round about on the skirts of the robe . . . and its sound shall be heard when he goes into the holy place before the Lord . . . \\" According to Philo and Josephus, the bells represented symbols of cosmic harmony. Music training According to the text of the Mishna, the early musicians, both singers and instrumentalists, were strictly trained to be professional musicians with their average training lasting five years. Bible historian Alfred Sendrey notes a \\"sudden and unexplained upsurge of large choirs and orchestras, consisting of thoroughly organized and trained musical groups, which would be virtually inconceivable without lengthy, methodical preparation.\\" This has led some scholars to believe that the prophet Samuel was the patriarch of a school which taught not only prophets and holy men, but also sacred-rite musicians. This public music school, perhaps the earliest in recorded history, was not restricted to a priestly class‚Äîwhich is how the shepherd boy David appears on the scene as a minstrel to King Saul.\\" :\\"\\"A Theatre Before the World: Performance History at the Intersection of Hebrew, Greek, and Roman Religious Processional\\" The Journal of Religion and Theatre, Vol. 5, No. 1, Summer 2006. Types of music Different types of music were also defined: *Cantillation. Used when parts of the Bible were read during the service and parts of the text were sung or chanted. *Antiphony (also referred to as responsorial singing). Since Hebrew poetry is based on parallelism (the expression of one thought in two different ways), several types of performances were possible: either by two separate alternating choruses, or by a soloist alternating with the chorus. At its peak around the beginning of the Christian era, antiphonal music was performed by a large choir of highly trained men singers, with boys sometimes added. According to Hindley, \\"Antiphony is among the debts owed by Christian music to its Jewish predecessor.\\" *Hymn songs. Within the service they were performed by either a soloist, called the cantor, or by groups. Some of the hymns were freely organized with groups of melodic motives with their variants connected to create a continuous melodic chant. *Orchestration. Werner writes that \\"the sound of the Temple's orchestra consisted of never less than twelve instruments and rarely exceeded thirty-six.\\" The trumpets were never mixed with the rest of the orchestra‚Äîbeing used for signals exclusively. One pair of cymbals were used in Temple rituals also as a signal instrument, \\"not unlike the gong in the modern theatre.\\" Written notation Musical notation in the modern sense did not exist during this period. However, the Hebrew alphabet allows for special symbols to indicate how the music was to be performed. The alphabet consists of consonants and half-consonants, and vowels are indicated by dots and dashes above and below letter symbols. In addition to the vowel signs, a number of other signs, called \\"masoretic,\\" refers not to single notes but to \\"melodic particles or groups,\\" writes Ulrich. These particles were handed down by oral tradition among singers for centuries and were first codified in the 16th century. Ulrich notes that the \\"Dead Sea Scrolls contain signs similar to those in the liturgical script of early Christian sects . . . strengthening the conjecture that a common musical heritage is shared by the people of related cultures . . .\\" Influence on later music Music historian William Smoldon notes that despite the fact that instrumental music was not revived and used in the synagogue after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD, (excluding the symbolic Shofar still used in orthodox communities,) \\"the chant continued, and of late years research has made it increasingly clear that many of the forms and even melodic patterns of the Byzantine and Western Christian chants were adaptations from the music of the synagogues.\\"Smoldon, William. A History of Music, Dimension Books, Inc. (1965) He also notes that after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the \\"one steadfast feature was the Western Christian Church\\" which was \\"respected by the barbarians.\\" He adds that there seems \\"little doubt that the worship-music of the early Church, i.e. at such centres as Jerusalem, Damascus, Antioch and Alexandria, grew from materials . . . of Greek and Syrian origins, together with the service-chants of the Jewish synagogue.\\" ;Psalms The Psalms have been sung through all the ages up to the present. Whitcomb describes the importance of the Psalms: :\\"the Crusader has chanted them as he ascended the Hill of Zion; and the victorious general was welcomed on his return by a hallelujah chorus. The sailor on the dark night at sea, the shepherd on the lonely plain, the little waif upon the street, have alike been cheered by the music of the Psalms. They have enlivened the vintage-feast, the boatman on the Rhine, the soldier by his camp-fire have been softened and the sad have been cheered by these sweet inspirations to faith, penitence, thanksgiving, and adoration.\\" Lockyer writes that Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor and champion of the pope, requested passages from his favorite psalm, Ps. 90, be read to him as he lay on his deathbed in September 1558. In that psalm, \\"Moses contrasts the eternity of God with the transience of human life, and Moses ends his song with a prayer for God's forgiveness and favor.\\"(Ps 90:1‚Äì6) Notes Category:Ancient music Music Category:Christian music Category:Jewish music Category:Ancient Jewish history Biblical period Category:Ancient Hebrew musical instruments ","title":"History of music in the biblical period"},{"id":"24150047","text":"Disney Fantasy Online is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Netdragon marketed in China.

She was a \\"Special Service Vessel\\" (also known as a Q-ship) whose function was to act as a decoy, inviting attack by a U-boat in order to engage and (if possible) destroy it. Baralong was successful on two occasions in her career, sinking in August 1915, and in September 1915; however both these actions caused controversy, particularly the first, being referred to as the Baralong incidents. Early career Baralong was built in 1901 as a \\"three-island\\" steam cargo liner and had an uneventful peacetime career with Bucknall Steamship Lines (later Ellerman & Bucknall Line) before the start of World War I. Initially requisitioned by the Royal Navy in August 1914 as a supply ship, in 1915 she was commissioned into a special service vessel. She was armed with three 12-pounder guns in concealed mountings, equipped with devices for simulating damage, and other modifications fitting her for her role. She was manned by a volunteer crew and commanded by Cdr Godfrey Herbert, an experienced submariner in the role of \\"poacher turned gamekeeper\\". The work was carried out at Barry Docks and was completed in April 1915.Ritchie p33 First action The action on 19 August 1915 Baralong spent the next four months patrolling the Southwest Approaches, seeking to invite a U-boat attack. On 19 August 1915 she received a distress call from the passenger liner Arabic which was under attack, and headed towards the location in an attempt to engage the U-Boat responsible. After several hours she encountered the British steamer Nicosian, which was carrying munitions and mules, and under fire from a German U-boat, U-27. At the time Baralong was flying the neutral US flag and closed with Nicosian, signalling she intended to pick up survivors. As she approached, U-27 passed behind the stern of Nicosian. Herbert had Baralong‚Äôs guns cleared away, and the flag replaced with the White Ensign whilst she was obscured from view; when U-27 emerged from behind the bow of Nicosian she was met with a hail of gunfire. Baralong scored 34 hits with her main battery, as well as machine gun and small arms fire, and U-27‚Äôs crew abandoned ship as the U-boat sank. Baralong manoeuvred to pick up Nicosian's crew, while the men from U-27 made for Nicosian in order to board her. Baralong‚Äôs men fired on them, killing most as they swam or climbed to Nicosian's deck. A party of Germans who gained the deck disappeared below, and Baralong landed a boarding party that pursued and killed them, either as combantants or prisoners [Admiralty Lord Winston Churchill had given orders that German submariners could be treated as felons rather than prisoners of war]. When some American members of Nicosian‚Äôs crew (mostly employed as muleteers) returned to the US the story became known, and the German government alleged the Baralong‚Äôs crew had committed an atrocity. The dispute continued for some time, and became known as the Baralong Incident. Second action In September 1915, now under the command of Lt. Cdr. A. Wilmot-Smith (Herbert having returned to the submarine service) Baralong was again on patrol in the Southwest Approaches when she fell in with the steamship Urbino, which was under attack by U-41. As Baralong approached U-41 dived, surfacing when Baralong had drawn closer and ordering her to stop. Wilmot‚ÄìSmith slowed and started to launch a boat in compliance as the U-boat came closer, but at 700 yards he swung to starboard and Baralong opened fire. Her first shots wrecked U-41‚Äôs conning tower, and killed her commander. The U-boat dived, but quickly re-surfaced; her crew started to abandon ship, but only two men escaped before the U-boat sank. Baralong then picked up Urbino‚Äôs crew and also the two German submariners. One of these, U-41's first officer O/L I.Crompton, was severely wounded, and was repatriated to Germany; once there he made a series of allegations which were published in Germany, including that Wyandra had fired on and sunk the U-boat without striking the American flag. This would have been a violation of the rules of war; while the use of a False Flag was allowed, it was required that a belligerent identify itself before initiating hostilities. The event generated widespread outrage in Germany, especially among Kriegsmarine officers, and referred to there as the 'Second Baralong Incident'. The sinking was also commemorated in a propaganda medal designed by the German medallist Karl Goetz. The British Admiralty denied the accusations, and unlike the first incident had little currency outside Germany itself. Later career Following this success Baralong, now HMS Wyandra, was transferred to the Mediterranean to join the Q-ship force being established there. She continued in this role but had no further success, and in November 1916 returned to civilian service. Baralong was one of the first Q-Ships operational, and one of the most successful. She and her commanders, particularly Herbert, were instrumental in establishing Q-Ship procedures for the remainder of the Allied anti-submarine campaign. Wyandra returned to Ellerman & Bucknall Line in 1916 under the name Manica. She was sold to Japan in 1922, sailing under the names Kyokuto Maru and Shinsei Maru No.1 until being scrapped in Japan in 1933. Notes References * Chatterton, E Keble : Q-Ships and their story.

Awards Ruchamkin was awarded the Navy Cross posthumously for \\" ...extraordinary heroism as first lieutenant aboard the USS Cushing...While under vigorous bombardment by hostile naval units... Ruchamkin...efficiently directed the fighting of fires and the efforts to control damage. Leading his party to an area below decks to extinguish flames which were raging there, he never returned.\\"This quotation, from the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships (at http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/r9/ruchamkin.htm), is unattributed. Namesake The U.S. Navy destroyer escort USS Ruchamkin (DE-228), was named for Ruchamkin. She was converted during construction into the high-speed transport USS Ruchamkin (APD-89, later LPR-89), and was in commission as such from 1945 to 1946, from 1951 to 1957, and from 1961 to 1969.

He served as Bishop of Toledo from 1967 to 1980. Biography Donovan was born in Chatham, Ontario, the youngest son in a family of ten. After immigrating to the United States, he attended Sacred Heart Seminary in Detroit, Michigan. He then studied at the Pontifical North American College and the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. Donovan was ordained to the priesthood on December 8, 1935. He later served as chancellor and vicar general of the Archdiocese of Detroit. On September 6, 1954, Donovan was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Detroit and Titular Bishop of Rhasus by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following October 26 from Cardinal Edward Mooney, with Bishops Allen James Babcock and Alexander M. Zaleski serving as co-consecrators. From 1958 to April, 1967 he presided over St. Veronica's parish in East Detroit, MI (now Eastpointe, MI). From 1962 to 1965, he attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council. Donovan was named the fifth Bishop of Toledo, Ohio, on February 25, 1967. He was formally installed on April 18, 1967. Considered progressive and innovative, Donovan implemented the reforms of the Second Vatican Council in the diocese by joining the Ohio Council of Churches, and establishing a permanent diaconate and a chancery office for divorced, separated, and widowed Catholics. In 1967 he issued a pastoral letter endorsing open housing, which was defeated in a citywide referendum that fall. He also established the Diocesan Development Fund and special programs for Spanish-speaking, African American and elderly Catholics. During his tenure, Donovan also established Resurrection Parish in Lexington in 1969 and St. Joan of Arc Parish in Toledo in 1978. He increased the number of Catholics in the diocese from 301,000 to 348,000. After thirteen years as Bishop of Toledo, Donovan resigned due to a heart ailment on July 29, 1980. He later died at Lake Park Nursing Facility in Sylvania, aged 80. He is buried at Calvary Cemetery.

Development After SZD's success in designing high-performance all-wood gliders, the design group's first product using fibreglass emerged as a very competitive glider. Two prototypes of the SZD-37x Jantar were built (SP-2636 and SP-2637), using fibreglass reinforced plastic fuselage and tail- unit with an aluminium alloy tubular tail boom, SP-2636 was built with a 17.5m span wing and SP-2637 a 19m span wing. The first flight of SP-2636 was carried out on 14 February 1972 and extensive testing carried out before the second prototype, SP-2637 (first flight 13 May 1972), was entered in the 1972 World Gliding Championships at Vr≈†ac in Yugoslavia, taking the first place in the newly established 19m Class and the 3rd in the Open Class, flown by St. Kluk. Production of the 19m span Jantar commenced as the SZD-38 Jantar 1 in 1973 with 57 built by 1975, 24 for export. The success of the SZD-37x prototypes in the World Championships was not repeated, due partly to shrinkage of the epoxy resin causing irregularities in the wing surfaces, and partly to the improved performance of the competing aircraft. The SZD-38 broke seven Polish National records in 1973, but was soon out-classed in competitions. The standard instrument fit included variometer, turn and bank, compass as well as standard ASI, altimeter etc. Provision was also made for an artificial horizon and oxygen equipment.

A flagman is also assigned to protect a train that has stopped on a section of track. When a train approaches a location a flagman is posted, the train crew will have to get permission from the flagman to pass the area. A flagman protecting a level crossing in Malaysia in 2013 Before the advent of automated level crossing gates, and still where automatic gates are not installed, flagmen were also assigned to protect the crossings. The flagman would stop road traffic from crossing the tracks as trains used the crossing. Additional information Rules pertaining to a flagman may vary depending on different railroad's operating rules. For instance on CSX Transportation a train approaching the work area is to call the flagman for permission through the work area. If workers are in the clear the flagman will advise crew to proceed and advise the crew that workers are not fouling the track. If a flagman fails to answer, the train crew is required by rule to stop short of milepost location and proceed at restricted speed. However on Norfolk Southern there are no flagmen. Rather NS has a track supervisor obtain track authority from the train dispatcher to take the track out of service until it is certain that workers are in the clear and trains may safely pass the area.

The SSML develops methods useful for strength analysis and structural design of marine structures. The methods developed should be helpful for achievement of high performance of the structural system. The Laboratory has the facilities for numerical and experimental studies. This includes mechanical testing equipment (static and dynamic loading machines) and high-speed computers with non-linear finite element programmes. Major research fields *Buckling and Ultimate Strength / Limit States Design *Impact Engineering (Collision and Grounding Mechanics) *Risk Assessment / Structural Reliability Engineering *Condition Assessment of Aged Structures *Design of Weight-Critical Structures (Aluminum Alloy) *Fire and Gas Explosion *Impact Pressure Actions Arising from Sloshing, Slamming and Green Water Major research Topics *Fracture of membrane type LNG carrier's insulation structures under dynamic impact loads due to sloshing Sloshing loads can cause structural damage in the insulation structures of the LNG cargo tanks and also their internal structures such as stiffeners and equipment like LNG pump towers. Structural failure of insulation structures leads to a catastrophic situation of the vessel. LS-DYNA3D numerical simulations and fracture testing are being undertaken on the material and insulation box / panel structure models. *Buckling collapse of steel and aluminum structures Steel stiffened panels are important in a variety of marine and land-based applications including ships, offshore platforms and box girder bridges. Aluminum panels are used for building high speed ships. Numerical and experimental studies on buckling and ultimate strength of steel and aluminum stiffened panels are being undertaken. *Collision and grounding of ships Ship collisions and grounding continue to occur regardless of continuous efforts to prevent such accidents. With the increasing demand for safety at sea and for protection of the environment, it is of crucial importance to be able to reduce the probability of accidents, assess their consequences and ultimately minimize or prevent potential damages to the ships and the marine environment. Numerical and experimental studies on collision and grounding of ships are being undertaken. *Condition assessment of aging ships Failures in ship structures, including total losses, continue to occur worldwide, in spite of ongoing continuous efforts to prevent them. Such failures can have enormous costs associated with them, including lost lives in some cases. One of the possible causes of marine casualties is the inability of aging ships to withstand rough seas and weather, because the ship's structural safety becomes reduced during later life although it is quite adequate at the design stage and perhaps some 15 years beyond. Condition assessment scheme (CAS) is being developed. *Dynamic Crushing of plated Structures due to Impact The axial crushing of a square section steel tube was done by impact loading. The test was carried out using the drop hammer machine. Based on the test results, mean crushing strength and effective crashing distance of plated structures under impact have been evaluated. The results could be useful for structural design of vessels and automobiles against collision accidents. The detailed results were published in Journal of Ship Research, Vol.41, No.2, 1997. *Collapse Tests of Mild Steel Corrugated Bulkhead Models Collapse tests on nine mild steel corrugated bulkhead models having five bays of corrugations were carried out, varying the corrugation angle, the plate thickness and the type of loading (axial compression and / or lateral pressure). The detailed results were published in Journal of Ship Research, Vol.41, No.4, 1997. *Experimental Investigation of Structural Crash worthiness in Ship Collision and Grounding using Double Skinned Structural Models A total of six double skinned structural models, namely four mild steel models and two aluminum alloy models, have been tested in a quasi-static loading condition, varying the plate thickness and the initial colliding location. The mild steel models were designed to represent side or bottom structures typical in double hull tankers or LNG carriers. The aluminum alloy models were designed to examine the internal mechanics in collision and grounding of aluminum alloy hull vessels for future designs. A same type indentor with a conical shape regarded as a striking body was used for the tests of all models.

Frommer (; born September 17, 1944) is an American communications professor at the University of Southern California (USC) and a linguistics consultant. He is the former Vice President, Special Projects Coordinator, Strategic Planner, and Writer-Researcher at Bentley Industries in Los Angeles, California. From 2005 to 2008, he served as Director of the Center for Management Communication at the USC Marshall School of Business. Youth and education Frommer was born in New York City. Interested in astronomy from an early age, he changed his college major from astrophysics to math, graduating from the University of Rochester with a bachelor of arts in mathematics in 1965. He soon taught English and math in Malaysia in the Malay language with the Peace Corps. He had studied languages earlier, but this experience switched his focus to linguistics. He began a doctoral program in linguistics at the University of Southern California (USC). During the program, he taught English in Iran for a year in the mid-1970s and studied Persian. He earned his master's degree and doctorate in linguistics at USC in 1981 under Bernard Comrie; his doctorate was on aspects of Persian syntax and entitled \\"Post- verbal Phenomena in Colloquial Persian Syntax\\". Work Frommer taught for several years and then moved into business, becoming a Vice President, Special Projects Coordinator, Strategic Planner, and Writer-Researcher at Bentley Industries in Los Angeles. Frommer was also a writer for the 1989 film Step Into the Third Dimension. In 1996, he returned to USC as a full professor of clinical management communication at the Marshall School of Business. In 1999, he co-authored a linguistics workbook called Looking at Languages: A Workbook in Elementary Linguistics. From 2005 to 2008, he served as Director of the Center for Management Communication at Marshall School of Business. After a search by James Cameron, writer and director of the 2009 film Avatar, Frommer was chosen to create a language for the Na'vi, the film's fictional alien race of sentient blue humanoid inhabitants of the moon Pandora. Frommer says that his process for creating the language began with phonetics and phonology: \\"The sound system has to be all nailed down first, so that there is consistency in the language\\". The morphology, syntax and vocabulary followed. Cameron had already created several dozen words that he wanted to incorporate into the new language. That gave Frommer \\"a sense of what kinds of sounds he had in mind\\". Cameron also told Frommer that he \\"wanted the language to be pleasant sounding and appealing to the audience.\\" \\"When you create a language, you experience the joy of rolling sounds around in your mouth, hearing unusual sounds, playing with the sounds and structural properties of language ‚Äì it's a process that took about six months for the basics\\". Frommer based some Na'vi grammar on Polynesian languages and used consonants such as ejectives and word-initial velar nasals that do not occur in Western languages, while omitting common Western sounds like \\"b\\", \\"d\\" and \\"g\\". He placed verb modifiers in the middle of words, instead of at the beginning or end of them. Cameron wrote some songs for the Na'vi characters that Frommer translated into a poetic form of Na'vi language, and he then coached the singers on pronunciation. He then worked personally with the actors who needed to speak the Na'vi language in the film and created MP3 files for them to use to study it. The actors' voices were not altered in the film, as Cameron wanted the Na'vi characters to have human- sounding voices. Since the film opened, Frommer has received numerous e-mails from fans with suggestions for expanding the language and websites have grown up devoted to the study and use of the language. Frommer also created the Barsoomian language for the Disney film John Carter.

The World Wars sparked tension between countries and led to the creation of atomic bombs, the Cold War led to the Space Race and creation of rockets, and the World Wide Web was created. These advancements have played a significant role in citizens' lives and shaped the 21st century into what it is today. Events in the 20th century  The world at the beginning of the century  From 1914 to 1918, the First World War, and its aftermath, caused major changes in the power balance of the world, destroying or transforming some of the most powerful empires.  \\"The war to end all wars\\": World War I (1914‚Äì1918)  Picture believed to depict the arrest of Gavrilo Princip in Sarajevo The First World War (or simply WWI), termed \\"The Great War\\" by contemporaries, started in 1914 and ended in 1918. It was ignited by the Assassination in Sarajevo of the Austro-Hungarian Empire's heir to the throne, Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand, by Gavrilo Princip of the organization \\"Young Bosnia,\\" Bosnian Serbs' liberation movement. Bound by Slavic nationalism to help the small Serbian state, the Russians came to the aid of the Serbs when they were attacked. Interwoven alliances, an increasing arms race, and old hatreds dragged Europe into the war. The Allies, known initially as \\"The Triple Entente\\", comprised the British Empire, France and Russia. Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy, Bulgaria, and later the Ottoman Empire, were known as \\"The Central Powers\\". In 1917, Russia ended hostile actions against the Central Powers after the fall of the Tsar. The Bolsheviks negotiated the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany, although it was at huge cost to Russia. In the treaty, Bolshevik Russia ceded the Baltic States to Germany, and its province of Kars Oblast in the south Caucasus to the Ottoman Empire. It also recognized the independence of Ukraine. Although Germany shifted huge forces from the eastern to the western front after signing the treaty, it was unable to stop the Allied advance, especially with the entrance of American troops in 1918. The war itself was also a chance for the combatant nations to show off their military strength and technological ingenuity. The Germans introduced the machine gun, U-Boats and deadly gases. The British first used the tank. Both sides had a chance to test out their new aircraft to see if they could be used in warfare. It was widely believed that the war would be short. Unfortunately, since trench warfare was the best form of defense, advances on both sides were very slow, and came at a terrible cost in lives. Division of Austria-Hungary after World War I When the war was finally over in 1918, the results would set the stage for the next twenty years. First and foremost, the Germans were forced to sign the Treaty of Versailles, forcing them to make exorbitant payments to repair damages caused during the War. Many Germans felt these reparations were unfair because they did not actually \\"lose\\" the war nor did they feel they caused the war (see Stab-in- the-back legend). Germany was never occupied by Allied troops, yet it had to accept a liberal democratic government imposed on it by the victors after the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm. Much of the map of Europe was redrawn by the victors based upon the theory that future wars could be prevented if all ethnic groups had their own \\"homeland\\". New states like Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia were created out of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire to accommodate the nationalist aspirations of these groups. An international body called the League of Nations was formed to mediate disputes and prevent future wars, although its effectiveness was severely limited by, among other things, its reluctance and inability to act.  The Russian Revolution and Communism  {{main|Russian Revolution of 1916 The Russian Revolution of 1916 (ending in the overthrow of the Tsarist regime and the brutal execution of His Imperial Majesty Nicholas II and his family) sparked a wave of communist revolutions across Europe, prompting many to believe that a socialist world revolution could be realized in the near future. However, the European revolutions were defeated, Vladimir Lenin died in 1924, and within a few years, Joseph Stalin displaced Leon Trotsky as the de facto leader of the Soviet Union. The idea of worldwide revolution was no longer in the forefront, as Stalin concentrated on \\"socialism in one country\\" and embarked on a bold plan of collectivization and industrialization. The majority of socialists and even many communists became disillusioned with Stalin's autocratic rule, his purges and the assassination of his \\"enemies\\", as well as the news of famines he imposed on his own people. Communism was strengthened as a force in Western democracies when the global economy crashed in 1929 in what became known as the Great Depression. Many people saw this as the first stage of the end of the capitalist system and were attracted to Communism as a solution to the economic crisis, especially as the Soviet Union's economic development in the 1930s was strong, unaffected by the capitalist world's crisis.  Between the wars  Dorothea Lange's 1936 photo Migrant Mother is one of the most iconic photos associated with the Great Depression  Economic depression  After World War I, the global economy remained strong through the 1920s. The war had provided a stimulus for industry and for economic activity in general. There were many warning signs foretelling the collapse of the global economic system in 1929 that were generally not understood by the political leadership of the time. The responses to the crisis often made the situation worse, as millions of people watched their savings become next to worthless and the idea of a steady job with a reasonable income fading away. Many sought answers in alternative ideologies such as communism and fascism. They believed that the capitalist economic system was collapsing, and that new ideas were required to meet the crisis. The early responses to the crisis were based upon the assumption that the free market would correct itself. This, however, did very little to correct the crisis or to alleviate the suffering of many ordinary people. Thus, the idea that the existing system could be reformed by government intervention in the economy, rather than by continuing the laissez- faire approach, became prominent as a solution to the crisis. Democratic governments assumed the responsibility to provide needed services in society, and to alleviate poverty. Thus was born the welfare state. These two politico- economic principles, the belief in government intervention and the welfare state, as opposed to the belief in the free market and private institutions, would define many political battles for the rest of the century.  The rise of dictatorship  Nazi soldiers hang a poster on the window of Jewish-owned business, that says: \\"German, protect yourself. Do not buy from Jews\\". Germany, 1933 Fascism first appeared in Italy with the rise to power of Benito Mussolini in 1922. The ideology was supported by a large proportion of the upper classes as a strong challenge to the threat of communism. When Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933, a new variant of fascism called Nazism took over Germany and ended the German experiment with democracy. The Nazi Party in Germany was dedicated to the restoration of German honor and prestige, the unification of German-speaking peoples, and the annexation of Central and Eastern Europe as vassal states, with the Slavic population to act as slave labor to serve German economic interests. There was also a strong appeal to a mythical racial purity (the idea that Germans were the Herrenvolk or the \\"master race\\"), and a vicious anti-semitism which promoted the idea of Jews as subhuman (Untermensch) and worthy only of extermination. Many people in Western Europe and the United States greeted the rise of Hitler with relief or indifference. They could see nothing wrong with a strong Germany ready to take on the communist menace to the east. Anti-semitism during the Great Depression was widespread as many were content to blame the Jews for causing the economic downturn. Hitler began to put his plan in motion, annexing Austria in the Anschluss, or reunification of Austria to Germany, in 1938. He then negotiated the annexation of the Sudetenland, a German-speaking mountainous area of Czechoslovakia, in the Munich Conference. The British were eager to avoid war and believed Hitler's assurance to protect the security of the Czech state. Hitler annexed the rest of the Czech state shortly afterwards, indicating that he had ulterior motives. Fascism was not the only form of dictatorship to rise in the post-war period. Almost all of the new democracies in the nations of Eastern Europe collapsed and were replaced by authoritarian regimes. Spain also became a dictatorship under the leadership of General Francisco Franco after the Spanish Civil War. Totalitarian states attempted to achieve total control over their subjects as well as their total loyalty. They held the state above the individual, and were often responsible for some of the worst acts in history, such as the Holocaust Adolf Hitler perpetrated on European Jews, or the Great Purge Stalin perpetrated in the Soviet Union in the 1930s.  Global war: World War II (1939‚Äì1945)   The war in Europe  This section provides a conversational overview of World War II in Europe. See main article for a fuller discussion. The signing of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact in Moscow, August 23, 1939 Soon after the events in Czechoslovakia, Britain and France issued assurances of protection to Poland, which seemed to be next on Hitler's list. World War II officially began on September 1, 1939, when Hitler unleashed his Blitzkrieg, or lightning war, against Poland. Britain and France, much to Hitler's surprise, immediately declared war upon Germany, but the help they delivered to Poland was negligible. Sixteen days later, Poland was attacked from the East by Soviet Union, acting in a secret alliance with Nazi Germany. After only a few weeks, the Polish forces were overwhelmed, and its government fled to exile in London (see Polish government in Exile). In starting World War II, the Germans had unleashed a new type of warfare, characterized by highly mobile forces and the use of massed aircraft. The German strategy concentrated upon the devotion of the Wehrmacht, or German army, to the use of tank groups, called panzer divisions, and groups of mobile infantry, in concert with relentless attacks from the air. Encirclement was also a major part of the strategy. This change smashed any expectations that the Second World War would be fought in the trenches like the first. As Hitler's forces conquered Poland, the Soviet Union, under General Secretary Joseph Stalin, was acting out guarantees of territory under a secret part of a nonaggression pact between the USSR and Germany known as the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. This treaty gave Stalin free rein to take the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, as well as Eastern Poland, all of which would remain in Soviet possession after the war. Stalin also launched an attack on Finland, which he hoped to reduce to little more than a Soviet puppet state, but the Red Army met staunch Finnish resistance in what became known as the Winter War and succeeded in gaining only limited territory from the Finns. This action would later cause the Finns to ally with Germany when its attack on the Soviet Union came in 1941. = Blitzkrieg = After the defeat of Poland, a period known as the Phony War ensued during the winter of 1939‚Äì1940, which saw only limited military land operation on the Western Front. All of this changed on May 10, 1940, when the Germans launched a massive attack on the Low Countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg), most probably to surmount the Maginot Line of defenses on the Franco-German border. This witnessed the incredible fall of Eben Emael, a Belgian fort considered impregnable and guarded by 600 Belgians, to a force of only 88 German paratroopers. The worst of this was that King Leopold III of Belgium surrendered to the Germans on May 28 without warning his allies, exposing the entire flank of the Allied forces to German panzer groups. Following the conquest of the Low Countries, Hitler occupied Denmark and Norway, beginning on April 9, 1940. Norway was strategically important because of its sea routes which supplied crucial Swedish ore to the Nazi war machine. Norway held on for a few crucial weeks, but Denmark surrendered after only four days. Sweden was the only Scandinavian country to successfully maintain its neutrality throughout the war, with occasional breaches of neutrality in favor of both Germany and the Western Allies. With the disaster in the Low Countries, France, considered at the time to have had the finest army in the world, lasted only four weeks, with Paris being occupied on June 14. Three days later, Marshal Philippe P√©tain surrendered to the Germans. The debacle in France also led to one of the war's greatest mysteries, and Hitler's first great blunder, Dunkirk, where a third of a million trapped British and French soldiers were evacuated by not only British war boats, but every boat the army could find, including fishing rafts. Hitler refused to \\"risk\\" his panzers on an action at Dunkirk, listening to the advice of Air Minister Hermann G√∂ring and allowing the Luftwaffe, or German Air Force, to handle the job. The irony of this was that the escaped men would form the core of the army that was to invade the beaches of Normandy in 1944. Hitler did not occupy all of France, but about three-quarters, including all of the Atlantic coast, allowing Marshal P√©tain to remain as dictator of an area known as Vichy France. However, members of the escaped French Army formed around General Charles de Gaulle to create the Free French forces, which would continue to battle Hitler in the stead of an independent France. At this moment, Italy, under Benito Mussolini, declared war on the Allies on June 10, thinking that the war was almost over, but he managed only to occupy a few hundred yards of French territory. Throughout the war, the Italians would be more of a burden to the Nazis than a boon, and would later cost them precious time in Greece. German Heinkel He 111 bombers during the Battle of Britain Hitler now turned his eyes on Great Britain, which stood alone against him. He ordered his generals to draw up plans for an invasion, code named Operation Sea Lion, and ordered the Luftwaffe to launch a massive air war against the British isles, which would come to be known as the Battle of Britain. The British at first suffered steady losses, but eventually managed to turn the air war against Germany, taking down 2,698 German planes throughout the summer of 1940 to only 915 Royal Air Force (RAF) losses. The key turning point came when the Germans discontinued successful attacks against British airplane factories and radar command and coordination stations and turned to civilian bombing known as terror bombing using the distinctive \\"bomb\\" sound created by the German dive- bomber, the Stuka. The switch came after a small British bombing force had attacked Berlin. Hitler was infuriated. However, his decision to switch the attacks' focus allowed the British to rebuild the RAF and eventually force the Germans to indefinitely postpone Sea Lion. The importance of the Battle of Britain is that it marked the first of Hitler's defeats, however its overall impact was overshadowed by his later blunders in the east. Secondly, it marked the advent of radar as a major weapon in modern air war. With radar, squadrons of fighters could be quickly assembled to respond to incoming bombers attempting to bomb civilian targets. It also allowed the identification of the type and a guess at the number of incoming enemy aircraft, as well as tracking of friendly airplanes. = Assault on the Soviet Union = Hitler, taken aback by his defeat over the skies of Britain, now turned his gaze eastward to the Soviet Union. Despite having signed the non-aggression pact with Stalin, Hitler despised communism and wished to destroy it in the land of its birth. He originally planned to launch the attack in early spring of 1941 to avoid the disastrous Russian winter. However, a pro-allied coup in Yugoslavia and Mussolini's almost utter defeat in his invasion of Greece from occupied Albania prompted Hitler to launch a personal campaign of revenge in Yugoslavia and to occupy Greece at the same time. The Greeks would have a bitter revenge of sorts; the attack caused a delay of several crucial weeks of the invasion of the USSR, potentially hampering it. Europe at the height of German control in 1942 On June 22, 1941, Hitler attacked Stalin with the largest army the world had ever seen. Over three million men and their weapons were put into service against the Soviet Union. Stalin had been warned about the attack, both by other countries and by his own intelligence network, but he had refused to believe it. Therefore, the Soviet army was largely unprepared and suffered massive setbacks in the early part of the war, despite Stalin's orders to counterattack the Germans. Throughout 1941, German forces, divided into 3 army groups (Army Group A, Army Group B, and Army Group C), occupied the territories of the present day Ukraine and Belarus, laid siege to Leningrad (present day Saint Petersburg), and advanced to within 15 miles of Moscow. At this critical moment, the Soviet people stalled the German Wehrmacht to a halt at the gates of Moscow. Stalin had planned to evacuate the city, and had already moved important government functions, but decided to stay and rally the city. Recently arrived troops from the east under the command of Marshal Georgy Zhukov counterattacked the Germans and drove them from Moscow. Mussolini had launched an offensive in North Africa from Italian- controlled Libya into British-controlled Egypt. However, the British smashed the Italians and were on the verge of taking Libya. Hitler decided to help by sending in a few thousand troops, a Luftwaffe division, and the first-rate general Erwin Rommel. Rommel managed to use his small force to repeatedly smash massively superior British forces and to recapture the port city of Tobruk and advance into Egypt. However, Hitler, embroiled in his invasion of the Soviet Union, refused to send Rommel any more troops, causing Rommel to retreat and preventing him from seizing the Middle East, where Axis-friendly regimes had taken root in Iraq and Persia (present-day Iran). After the winter, Hitler launched a fresh offensive in the spring of 1942, with the aim of capturing the oil-rich Caucacus and the city of Stalingrad. However, he repeatedly switched his troops to where they were not needed. The offensive bogged down, and the entire 6th Army, considered the best of German troops, was trapped in Stalingrad. Hitler now refused to let 6th Army break out. He insisted that the German army would force its way in. Hermann G√∂ring also assured Hitler that the Luftwaffe could supply the 6th Army adequately, when it could in reality only supply a minute fraction of the needed ammunition and rations. Eventually, the starved 6th Army surrendered, dealing a severe blow to the Germans. In the end, the defeat at Stalingrad was the turning point for the war in the east. Meanwhile, the Japanese had attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii on December 7, 1941. This disastrous attack forced the Americans into the war. Parts of the German brass advised against declaring war on the US, arguing that since Japan was the aggressor, the Tripartite Pact didn't bound Germany to do so. However, Hitler hoped that Japan would be able to quickly defeat the US and then turn its attention on helping the effort against Russia. Both Germany and Italy declared war on the United States a few days after the attack. = Turning tides = V gesture to German prisoners captured at El Alamein, 26 October 1942 Throughout the rest of 1942 and 1943, the Soviets began to gain ground against the Germans after some victories like the tank battle of Kursk. By this time, Rommel had been forced to abandon North Africa after a defeat by Montgomery at El Alamein in what was the first decisive victory of the Allies over the Germany army, leading Churchill to declare it \\"the end of the beginning\\". On several fronts, the Wehrmacht had encountered serious casualties that it could not replace. Hitler also insisted on a \\"hold at all costs\\" policy which forbade relinquishing any ground. He followed a \\"fight to the last man\\" policy that was completely ineffective. By the beginning of 1944, Hitler had lost all initiative in the Soviet Union, and was struggling even to hold back the tide turning against him. From 1942 to 1944, the United States and Britain acted in only a limited manner in the European theater, much to the chagrin of Stalin. They drove out the Germans in Africa, invading Morocco and Algeria on November 8, 1942. Then, on July 10, 1943, the Allies invaded Sicily, in preparation for an advance through Italy, the \\"soft underbelly\\" of the Axis, as Winston Churchill called it. On September 9, the invasion of Italy began. By the winter of 1943, the southern half of Italy was in Allied hands. The Italians, most of whom did not really support the war, had already turned against Mussolini. In July, he had been stripped of power and taken prisoner, though the Italians feigned continued support of the Axis. On September 8, the Italians formally surrendered, but most of Italy not in Allied hands was controlled by German troops and those loyal to Mussolini's (Mussolini had been freed by German paratroopers) new Italian Social Republic, which in reality consisted of the shrinking zone of German control. The Germans offered staunch resistance, but by June 4, 1944, Rome had fallen. The Battle of the Atlantic took place from 1942 to 1944 and was described as \\"longest, largest, and most complex naval battle in history\\". The Germans hoped to sever the vital supply lines between Britain and America, sinking many tons of shipping with U-boats, German submarines. However, the development of the destroyer and aircraft with a longer patrol range were effective at countering the U-boat threat and by December 1943, the Germans had lost the battle. = Operation Overlord = On June 6, 1944, the Western Allies finally launched the long-awaited assault on \\"Fortress Europe\\" so wanted by Stalin. The offensive, codenamed Operation Overlord, began the early morning hours of June 6. The day, known as D-day, was marked by foul weather. Rommel, who was now in charge of defending France against possible Allied attack, thought the Allies would not attack during the stormy weather, and was on holiday in Germany. Besides this, the Germans were expecting an attack, but at the natural harbor of Calais and not the beaches of Normandy; They did not know about the Allies' artificial harbours, and false leads planted by the Allies suggested Calais as the landing site. U.S. assault troops approaching Omaha Beach, 6 June 1944. By this time, the war was looking ever darker for Germany. On July 20, 1944, a group of conspiring German officers attempted to assassinate Hitler. The bomb they used did injure him, but the second was not used, and a table shielded Hitler in a stroke of luck. The plotters still could have launched a coup, but only the head of occupied Paris acted, arresting SS and Gestapo forces in the city. The German propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, rallied the Nazis and hunted down the conspirators, arresting up to 7000 people in the wake of the plot, according to some estimates. In France, the Allies took Normandy and finally Paris on August 25. In the east, the Soviets had advanced almost to the former Polish- Soviet border. At this time, Hitler introduced the V-weapons, the V-1 flying bomb and, later, the V-2, the first rockets used in modern warfare. The V-1 was often intercepted by air pilots, but the V-2 was extremely fast and carried a large payload. However, this advance came too late in the war to have any real effect. The Germans were also on the verge of introducing a number of terrifying new weapons, including advanced jet aircraft, which were too fast for ordinary propeller aircraft, and submarine improvements which would allow the Germans to again fight effectively in the Atlantic. All this came too late to save Hitler. Although a September invasion of The Netherlands failed, the Allies made steady advances. In the winter of 1944, Hitler put everything into one last desperate gamble in the West, known as the Battle of the Bulge, which, despite an initial advance, was a failure, because the introduction of new Allied tanks and low troop numbers among the Germans prevented any real action being taken. Nevertheless, it was one of the bloodiest battles of the war and the second costliest battle in the history of the American Army. = Final days = In early February 1945, the three Allied leaders, Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Joseph Stalin, met at newly liberated Yalta in the Crimea in the Soviet Union in the Yalta Conference. Here, they agreed upon a plan to divide post-war Europe. Most of the east went to Stalin, who agreed to allow free elections in Eastern Europe, which he never did. The west went to Britain, France, and the U.S. Post-war Germany would be split between the four, as would Berlin. This division of spheres of influence would set up international diplomacy for Cold War that would dominate the second half of the century. At the beginning of 1945, Hitler was on his last strings. The Soviets launched a devastating attack from Poland into Germany and Eastern Europe, intending to take Berlin. The Germans collapsed in the West, allowing the Allies to fan out across Germany. However, the Supreme Allied Commander, American general Dwight D. Eisenhower, refused to strike for Berlin, and instead became obsessed with reports of possible guerrilla activity in southern Germany, which in reality existed mainly in the propaganda of Joseph Goebbels. By April 25, the Soviets had besieged Berlin. Hitler remained in the city in a bunker under the Chancellery garden. On April 30, he committed suicide by shooting himself, after a ritual wedding with his longtime mistress Eva Braun. The Germans held out another 7 days under Admiral Doenitz, their new leader, but the Germans surrendered unconditionally on May 7, 1945, ending the war in Europe (see V-E Day). Rivalries that had begun during the war, combined with the sense of strength in the victorious powers, laid the foundations of the Iron Curtain and of the Cold War.  The war in the Pacific  = Background = The first event that is usually linked to the later Pacific conflict was the Mukden Incident of 18 September 1931, during which the Japanese military staged the bombing of the South Manchuria Railway and pinned the blame on Chinese dissidents. Japan then used this as pretext to invade northeastern China the next day and turn the region of Manchuria into the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo. After the League of Nations commissioned the 1932 Lytton Report, which exposed the Mukden Incident as a Japanese ruse, Japan was left internationally isolated, withdrawing from the League of Nations in March 1933. In 1934 Manchukuo became a constitutional monarchy and the former Chinese Emperor Pu Yi was placed on the throne, despite the real power being held by Japan. Despite relations between Japan and China suffering because the occupation of Manchuria, the situation did not turn into all-out war until 7 July 1937, when a dispute between Chinese and Japanese soldiers turned into a battle during the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. This, in turn, lead to a further escalation of the hostilities, leading to the Second Sino-Japanese War, one of the deadliest conflicts in human history. Japan enjoyed some early major victories, capturing both Shanghai and the Chinese capital of Nanjing in 1937 and forcing the Chinese central government 's relocation to Chongqing. Following Chinese victories in Changsha and Guangxi in 1939, the war reached somewhat of a stalemate, with Japan controlling the large cities, but being unable to rule the vast countryside. On 27 September 1940, Japan became cosignatories of the Tripartite Pact, joining a military alliance with Germany and Italy. = Japanese Expansion = USS West Virginia during the attack on Pearl Harbor On December 7, 1941, Japan launched a surprise attack on the American base at Pearl Harbor as a mean of preventing the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with its planned expansion in the area. The next day, following Roosevelt's Infamy Speech, the United States declared war on Japan, marking the official entry of both nations in World War 2. At the same time, Japan also launched attacks on Thailand, the British colonies of Malaya, Singapore, Hong Kong and American military bases in Guam, Wake Island and the Philippines. The next six months were dominated by Japanese victories against the Allied forces, already war- weary and stretched thin after two years of war in Europe and North Africa. Japan managed to capture British Burma, New Guinea, the Dutch East Indies, the Solomon Islands, Bali and Timor. In March 1942, days before the surrender of the Philippines, general Douglas MacArthur, who came out of retirement to become commander of United States Army Forces in the Far East at the onset of the war, was forced to flee and narrowly escape to Australia. On 19 February 1942, Japan also launched a devastating aerial attack on the Australian city of Darwin, in what was the first attack by a foreign power on Australian soil. The turning of the tide came in early May, during the Battle of the Coral Sea, which proved the first strategic victory of the Allies against Japanese expansion. This was followed one month later by the Battle of Midway, in which the US Navy defeated an attacking Japanese fleet, inflicting devastating damage on the attacking force. The Battle of Midway is widely considered the most important naval battle of the Pacific Campaign and has even been described as \\"the most stunning and decisive blow in the history of naval warfare\\" The reasons usually given for the resounding victory are Japanese overconfidence in their own forces, poor planning and the intercepting of Japanese battle plans by the United States. The losses suffered during this Battle of Midway, paired with the campaign of attrition that was taking place in Solomon Islands, left Japan unable to replenish its forces and turned the tides of war against it. By August 1942, the Allied forces were on the offensive, earning victories in the New Guinea campaign at Guadalcanal, Milne Bay and Buna-Gona. = Allied offensive = A map of the Japanese advance from 1937 to 1942 Over the next two years the Allies slowly captured one island base after another, trying to get closer to Japan itself, where it planned to launch massive strategic air attacks and, only if absolutely necessary, execute a ground invasion. By July 1944, the US recaptured Guam and captured Tinian, which finally put them in attacking range of mainland Japan using the new Boeing B-29 bombers. Despite the advances of the Allies, massive fighting was still taking place, both in South-East Asia with the Japanese offensive in India and in the Pacific, with the Battle of the Philippine Sea, where Japan suffered major losses and definitively lost the ability to rely on aircraft carriers. In later October, a combined attack of American and Australian forces took on the Imperial Japanese Navy during the Battle of Leyte Gulf in what was to be the largest naval battle of World War II and possibly the largest naval battle of all time. The Allied victory achieved its stated goal of further severing oil supplied to the Japanese army, which was already struggling to fuel the remainder of its naval power. The battle of Leyte Gulf is also notable as the first battle in which Japanese aircraft carried out organized kamikaze attacks. By early 1945, the Americans set their eyes on the Japanese island of Iwo Jima, which was of great strategic importance, being situated halfway between Tokyo and the Mariana Islands. Capturing the island meant not only a better launch station for aerial attacks against mainland Japan, but also the prevention of its use as an early-warning station against air raids. The Japanese were expecting an attack and have been heavily fortifying the entire island for over a year. Despite the American troops outnumbering the Japanese to a rate of more than 3 to 1, the USA suffered heavy casualties in the 36 days of fighting, with over 6,800 Marines killed and another 20,000 wounded, leading some historians to question the strategic worth of the action. With Japan struggling to defend the homeland islands, counteroffensives in other parts of the Japanese Empire became more feasible, with important battles taking place in Burma, Borneo and China. Continuing to come nearer the main Japanese islands, on 1 April 1945 the US Marines mounted the largest amphibious assault of the Pacific Theater on the island of Okinawa. After a long campaign of island hopping, the Allies were planning to use Kadena Air Base on the large island of Okinawa as a base for Operation Downfall, the planned invasion of the Japanese home islands which were only 340 miles away. The battle was one of the bloodiest in the Pacific, with approximately 160,000 casualties on both sides: at least 75,000 Allied and 84,166‚Äì117,000 Japanese. Around half of the island's population of 300,000 were killed, committed suicide or went missing. Enola Gay's ground crew with mission commander Paul Tibbets in the center. = Final days = The assaults on both Iwo Jima and Okinawa proves incredibly costly in terms of American lives and president Truman was horrified at the prospect of Operation Downfall, a planned boots-on-the-ground invasion of mainland Japan that was estimated to lead to over a million casualties among American soldiers. Despite a devastating campaign of fire-bombing in Tokyo and dozens of other cities, the Japanese showed no sign of planning to surrender. Following the Potsdam Declaration of July 26, where the Allies threatened \\"prompt and utter destruction\\" should Japan not surrender, the decision was made to resort to the first use of atomic bombs. On 6 August, the 393d Bombardment Squadron B-29 Enola Gay, took off from Tinian and dropped the bomb on the city of Hiroshima. Three days later, a second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. The two bombings killed 129,000‚Äì226,000 people, most of them civilians. On 9 August, the Soviet Union also invaded Manchukuo in what was to be the last campaign of the war. On 10 August the \\"sacred decision\\" was made by Japanese Cabinet to accept the Potsdam terms and on 15 August Emperor Hirohito broadcast to the nation and to the world at large the rescript of surrender, ending the Second World War. The formal Japanese Instrument of Surrender was signed on 2 September 1945, on the battleship USS Missouri, in Tokyo Bay. The surrender was accepted by General Douglas MacArthur as Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers.  The Holocaust  The Holocaust (which roughly means \\"great fire\\") was the deliberate, systematic murder of millions of Jews and other minorities during World War II by the Nazi regime in Germany. Several differing views exist regarding whether it was intended to occur from the war's beginning, or if the plans for it came about later. Regardless, persecution of Jews extended well before the war even started, such as in the Kristallnacht (literally \\"Crystal Night\\", Night of Broken Glass). The Nazis used propaganda to great effect to stir up anti-Semitic feelings within ordinary Germans. Slave laborers at the Buchenwald concentration camp. After the conquest of Poland, the Third Reich, which had previously deported Jews and other \\"undesirables\\", suddenly had within its borders the largest concentration of Jews in the world. The solution was to round up Jews and place them in Nazi concentration camps or in ghettos, cordoned off sections of cities where Jews were forced to live in deplorable conditions, often with tens of thousands starving to death, and the bodies decaying in the streets. As appalling as this sounds, they were the lucky ones. After the invasion of the Soviet Union, armed killing squads of SS men known as Einsatzgruppen systematically rounded up Jews and murdered an estimated one million Jews within the country. As barbaric and inhuman as this seems, it was too slow and inefficient by Nazi standards. In 1942, the top leadership met in Wannsee, a suburb of Berlin, and began to plan a more efficient way to slaughter the Jews. The Nazis created a system of extermination camps throughout Poland, and began rounding up Jews from the Soviet Union, and from the Ghettos. Not only were Jews shot or gassed to death en masse, but they were forced to provide slave labor and they were used in horrific medical experiments (see Human experimentation in Nazi Germany). Out of the widespread condemnation of the Nazis' medical experiments, the Nuremberg Code of medical ethics was devised. The Nazis took a sadistic pleasure in the death camps; the entrance to the most notorious camp, Auschwitz, stated \\"Arbeit Macht Frei\\"‚Äî\\"Work Sets You Free\\". In the end, six million Jews and up to 5 million homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, Roma and political prisoners were killed by various means, mainly in the death camps. An additional several million Soviet and other Allied prisoners of war died in camps and holding areas. There is some controversy over whether ordinary Germans knew about the Holocaust. It appears that many Germans knew about the concentration camps; such things were prominently displayed in magazines and newspapers. In many places, Jews had to walk past towns and villages on their way to work as slaves in German industry. In any case, Allied soldiers reported that the smell of the camps carried for miles. A very small number of people deny the Holocaust occurred entirely, though these claims have been routinely discredited by mainstream historians.  The Nuclear Age begins  During the 1930s, innovations in physics made it apparent that it could be possible to develop nuclear weapons of incredible power using nuclear reactions. When World War II broke out, scientists and advisors among the Allies feared that Nazi Germany may have been trying to develop its own atomic weapons, and the United States and the United Kingdom pooled their efforts in what became known as the Manhattan Project to beat them to it. At the secret Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico, scientist Robert Oppenheimer led a team of the world's top scientists to develop the first nuclear weapons, the first of which was tested at the Trinity site in July 1945. However, Germany had surrendered in May 1945, and it had been discovered that the German atomic bomb program had not been very close to success. The first nuclear explosion, named \\"Trinity\\", was detonated on July 16, 1945.The Allied team produced two nuclear weapons for use in the war, one powered by uranium-235 and the other by plutonium as fissionable material, named \\"Little Boy\\" and \\"Fat Man\\". These were dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945 each. This, in combination with the Soviet invasion of Japanese- controlled territory, convinced the Japanese government to surrender unconditionally. These two weapons remain the only two nuclear weapons ever used against other countries in war. Nuclear weapons brought an entirely new and terrifying possibility to warfare: a nuclear holocaust. While at first the United States held a monopoly on the production of nuclear weapons, the Soviet Union, with some assistance from espionage, managed to detonate its first weapon (dubbed \\"Joe-1\\" by the West) in August 1949. The post-war relations between the two, which had already been deteriorating, began to rapidly disintegrate. Soon the two were locked in a massive stockpiling of nuclear weapons. The United States began a crash program to develop the first hydrogen bomb in 1950, and detonated its first thermonuclear weapon in 1952. This new weapon was alone over 400 times as powerful as the weapons used against Japan. The Soviet Union detonated a primitive thermonuclear weapon in 1953 and a full-fledged one in 1955. nuclear war. The conflict continued to escalate, with the major superpowers developing long-range missiles (such as the ICBM) and a nuclear strategy which guaranteed that any use of the nuclear weapons would be suicide for the attacking nation (Mutually Assured Destruction). The creation of early warning systems put the control of these weapons into the hands of newly created computers, and they served as a tense backdrop throughout the Cold War. Since the 1940s there were concerns about the rising proliferation of nuclear weapons to new countries, which was seen as being destabilizing to international relations, spurring regional arms races, and generally increasing the likelihood of some form of nuclear war. Eventually, nine nations would overtly develop nuclear weapons, and still maintain stockpiles today: the United States, the Soviet Union (and later Russia would inherit these), the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea. South Africa developed six crude weapons in the 1980s (which it later dismantled), and Israel almost certainly developed nuclear weapons though it never confirmed nor denied it. The creation of the Nuclear Non- proliferation Treaty in 1968 was an attempt to curtail such proliferation, but a number of countries developed nuclear weapons since it was signed (and many did not sign it), and a number of other countries, including Libya and Iran were suspected of having clandestine nuclear weapons programs.  The post- war world  Following World War II, the majority of the industrialized world lay in ruins as a result of aerial bombings, naval bombardment, and protracted land campaigns. The United States was a notable exception to this; barring Pearl Harbor and some minor incidents, the U.S. had suffered no attacks upon its territory. The United States and the Soviet Union, which, despite the devastation of its most populated areas, rebuilt quickly, found themselves the world's two dominant superpowers. Much of Western Europe was rebuilt after the war with assistance from the Marshall Plan. Germany, chief instigator of the war, was placed under joint military occupation by the United States, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Berlin, although in Soviet-controlled territory, was also divided among the four powers. Occupation of Berlin would continue until 1990. Japan was also placed under U.S. occupation, that would last seven years, until 1952. Oddly, these two Axis powers, despite military occupation, soon rose to become the second (Japan) and third (West Germany) most powerful economies in the world. Following the end of the war, the Allies famously prosecuted numerous German officials for war crimes and other offenses in the Nuremberg Trials. Although Adolf Hitler had committed suicide, many of his cronies, including Hermann G√∂ring, were convicted. Less well-known trials of other Axis officials also occurred, including the Tokyo War Crime Trial. The failure of the League of Nations to prevent World War II essentially discredited the organization, and it was dissolved. A new attempt at world peace was begun with the founding of the United Nations on October 24, 1945, in San Francisco. Today, nearly all countries are members, but despite its many successes, the organization's success at achieving its goal of world peace is disputed. The organization was never given enough power to overcome the conflicting interests and priorities of its member nations.  The end of empires: decolonization  Michael Somare, the first leader of an independent Papua New Guinea. Almost all of the major nations that were involved in World War II began shedding their overseas colonies soon after the conflict. The tactics employed by the revolutionaries ranged from non-violent forms of protest to armed rebellions, depending on the nation involved. Immediately after the war, European powers began a decades-long process of withdrawing from their possessions in Africa and Asia. In India, Mahatma Gandhi became a global icon for his non-violent struggle to achieve Indian independence. This was achieved in 1947 with the end of British rule in India and the partition of the territory into modern day India and Pakistan, which would later also further divide, leading to the creation of the People's Republic of Bangladesh in 1971. Elsewhere in Asia, The United States granted independence to the Philippines, its major Pacific possession in 1946. In French Indochina, armed insurrections forced the French out in the early 1950s, leading to the formation of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. In Africa, nationalists such as Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya and Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana led their respective nations to independence from foreign rule. Mere decades before, the British Empire controlled almost half of the continent, but by 1968, the only British possession in Africa was Seychelles (which would also become independent in 1976). Between 1956 and 1962, almost 20 African countries achieved their independence from France. Through the efforts of Am√≠lcar Cabral and others, the Portuguese colonies of Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, Angola, Mozambique and S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe followed suit and achieved independence during the mid-1970s, in what was to be the last important wave of African decolonization. In 1946, there were 35 member states in the United Nations, but as the newly independent nations joined the organization, by 1970 membership increased to 127. The emergence of newly independent countries in Africa and Asia that used the borders of the imperial partitions later led to further conflict. In many cases this meant that historically antagonistic ethnic or religious groups now needed to share the same country or that several nations held territorial claims over regions which were more or less arbitrarily divided by European powers. Some conflicts which aroused from these tensions, especially the Nigerian Civil War, the Second Congo War, the Second Sudanese Civil War and the Bangladesh Liberation War have been among the bloodiest wars of the 20th Century.  The Cold War (1947‚Äì1991)  Post-war territorial changes in Europe and the formation of the Eastern Bloc During the Yalta Conference, where the Western, capitalist powers, and the communist Soviet Union agreed on separate spheres of influence in Europe, they set up the stage for a geopolitical rivalry that would dominate international relations for the next five decades. In March 1946, Winston Churchill gave a now famous speech while visiting Westminster College in the US which is usually credited as the first use of the term iron curtain to refer to the separation of Soviet and Western areas of influence in Europe: > From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an iron curtain has > descended across the Continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of the > ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe. Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, > Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia; all these famous cities and > the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere, and > all are subject, in one form or another, not only to Soviet influence but to > a very high and in some cases increasing measure of control from Moscow. Indeed, the Soviet Union have already annexed several countries as Soviet Socialist Republics during the war. Eastern Poland (incorporated into the Byelorussian SSR and the Ukrainian SSR), Latvia (which became the Latvian SSR), Estonia (which became the Estonian SSR), Lithuania ( which became the Lithuanian SSR), part of eastern Finland (which became the Karelo-Finnish SSR) and eastern Romania (which became the Moldavian SSR) were now wholly part of Soviet Union. Furthermore, between 1945 and 1949, Yugoslavia, Albania, Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and East Germany saw communist regimes coming to power and their transformation into People's Republics. While they remained independent countries and their relation with the Soviet authorities would fluctuate over the next half century, they were widely seen as Soviet satellite states. Outside of Europe, countries that would see the rise of communism and would ally themselves to the communist bloc include Mongolia, China, North Korea, Cuba and Vietnam. The spread of the communist ideology in general and the Soviet influence in particular made Western leaders nervous and it even lead to Churchill considering a preemptive attack on the USSR even before World War II was formally ended. Fearful of a possible invasion of Western Europe by Soviet forces or, more realistically, Soviet subversion of Western governments, the US set up clandestine \\"stay- behind\\" operations of armed resistance in collaboration with Western European leaders, which later evolved into Operation Gladio. The two rival blocks also coalesced into formal mutual defense organizations, with the formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949 and the Warsaw Pact in 1955, each determine to expand its own influence among unaligned countries and limit the influence of their rivals. = War by proxy = Two wars and a near- war in the 1950s became the focus for capitalist versus communist struggle. The first war was the Korean War, fought between People's Republic of China- backed North Korea and mainly United States-backed South Korea. The Korean Peninsula was a Japanese colony between 1910 and 1945, when Soviet and American troops invaded and divided it along the 38th parallel. A communist government controlled the territory north of the border and a capitalist one controlled the South, with both authorities considering the other one illegitimate and claiming sovereignty over the entire peninsula. North Korea's invasion of South Korea on June 25, 1950 led to United Nations intervention. General Douglas MacArthur led troops from the United States, Canada, Australia, Great Britain, and other countries in repulsing the Northern invasion. However, the war reached a stalemate after Chinese intervention pushed U.N. forces back, and an Armistice ended hostilities in July 1953, leaving the two Koreas divided and tense for the rest of the century. The second war, the Vietnam War, was perhaps the third most visible war of the 20th century, after World War I and World War II. After the French withdrawal from its former colony, on 21 July 1954, Vietnam became partitioned into two halves, much like Korea, along the 17th parallel. Fighting between North and South eventually escalated into a regional war. The United States provided aid to South Vietnam and contributed to propaganda efforts against the North, but was not directly involved until the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, passed in reaction to a supposed North Vietnamese attack upon American destroyers, brought the U.S. into the war as a belligerent. The war was initially viewed as a fight to contain communism (see containment, Truman Doctrine, and Domino Theory), but, as more Americans were drafted and news of events such as the Tet Offensive and My Lai massacre leaked out, American sentiment turned against the war. U.S. President Richard Nixon was elected partially on a promise to end the war. This Nixon Doctrine involved a gradual pullout of American forces; South Vietnamese units were supposed to replace them, backed up by American air power. The plan went awry, with Nixon deliberately sabotaging peace talks for political gain, and the war spilled into neighboring Cambodia while South Vietnamese forces were pushed further back. Eventually, the U.S. and North Vietnam signed the Paris Peace Accords, ending U.S. involvement in the war. With the threat of U.S. retaliation gone, the North proceeded to violate the ceasefire and invaded the South with full military force. Saigon was captured on April 30, 1975, and Vietnam was unified under Communist rule a year later, effectively bringing an end to one of the most unpopular wars of all time. The Cuban Missile Crisis illustrates just how close to the brink of nuclear war the world came during the Cold War. Cuba, under Fidel Castro's socialist government, had formed close ties with the Soviet Union. This was obviously disquieting to the United States, given Cuba's proximity. When Lockheed U-2 spy plane flights over the island revealed that Soviet missile launchers were being installed, U.S. President John F. Kennedy instituted a naval blockade and publicly confronted the Soviet Union. After a tense week, the Soviet Union backed down and ordered the launchers removed, not wanting to risk igniting a new world war.  The space race  the Moon. With Cold War tensions running high, the Soviet Union and United States took their rivalry to the stars in 1957 with the Soviet launch of Sputnik. A \\"space race\\" between the two powers followed. Although the USSR reached several important milestones, such as the first craft on the Moon (Luna 2) and the first human in space (Yuri Gagarin), the U.S. pulled ahead eventually with its Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs, which culminated in Apollo 11 astronauts landing on the moon on 20 July 1969. Five more landings with astronauts followed (Apollo 13 was forced to abort its mission). Nevertheless, despite its successes, the U.S. space program could not match many major achievements of the Soviet space program, such as rover-based space exploration and image and video transfer from the surface of another planet, until the early 21st century. In addition, both countries launched numerous probes into space, such as the Venera 7 and Voyager 2. In later decades, space became a somewhat friendlier place. Regular space flights with astronauts were made possible with the American space shuttle, which was the first reusable spacecraft to be successfully used. Mir and Skylab enabled prolonged human habitation in space. In the 1990s, work on the International Space Station began, and by the end of the century, while still incomplete, it was in continual use by astronauts from the United States, Europe, Russia, Japan, and Canada.  The end of the Cold War  In 1989, the Berlin Wall separating West and East Berlin fell. By the 1980s, the Soviet Union was weakening. The Sino-Soviet split had removed the USSR's most powerful ally, the People's Republic of China. Its arms race with the U.S. was draining the country of funds, and further weakened by internal pressures, ethnic and political. Mikhail Gorbachev, its last leader, attempted to reform the country with glasnost and perestroika, but the formation of Solidarity, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the breaking-off of several Soviet republics, such as Lithuania, started a slippery slope of events that culminated in a coup to overthrow Gorbachev, organized by Communist Party hard-liners. Boris Yeltsin, president of Russia, organized mass opposition, and the coup failed. On December 26, 1991, the Soviet Union was officially disbanded into its constituent republics, thus putting a final line under the already exhausted Cold War.  Information and communications technology  The creation of the transistor revolutionized the development of the computer. The first computers, room-sized electro-mechanical devices built to break cryptographical codes during World War II, quickly became at least 20 times smaller using transistors. Computers became reprogrammable rather than fixed- purpose devices. The invention of programming languages meant computer operators could concentrate on problem solving at a high-level, without having to think in terms of the individual instructions to the computer itself. The creation of operating systems also vastly improved programming productivity. Building on this, computer pioneers could now realize what they had envisioned. The graphical user interface, piloted by a computer mouse made it simple to harness the power of the computer and made it more accessible to new users. Storage for computer programs progressed from punched cards and paper tape to magnetic tape, floppy disks and hard disks. Core memory and bubble memory fell to random access memory. Wrens The invention of the word processor, spreadsheet and database greatly improved office productivity over the old paper, typewriter and filing cabinet methods. The economic advantage given to businesses led to economic efficiencies in computers themselves. Cost-effective CPUs led to thousands of industrial and home-brew computer designs, many of which became successful; a home-computer boom was led by the Apple II, the ZX80 and the Commodore PET. IBM, seeking to embrace the microcomputer revolution, devised its IBM Personal Computer (PC). Crucially, IBM developed the PC from third-party components that were available on the open market. The only impediment to another company duplicating the system's architecture was the proprietary BIOS software. Other companies, starting with Compaq, reverse engineered the BIOS and released PC compatible computers that soon became the dominant architecture. Microsoft, which produced an operating system for the PC, rode this wave of popularity to become the world's leading software company. The 1980s heralded the Information Age. The rise of computer applications and data processing made ethereal \\"information\\" as valuable as physical commodities. This brought about new concerns surrounding intellectual property issues. The U.S. Government made algorithms patentable, forming the basis of software patents. The controversy over these and proprietary software led Richard Stallman to create the Free Software Foundation and begin the GNU Project, paving the way for a free software movement. Computers also became a usable platform for entertainment. Computer games were first developed by software programmers exercising their creativity on large systems at universities, but these efforts became commercially successful in arcade games such as Pong and Space Invaders. Once the home computer market was established, young programmers in their bedrooms became the core of a youthful video game industry. In order to take advantage of advancing technology, games consoles were created. Like arcade systems, these machines had custom hardware designed to do game-oriented operations (such as sprites and parallax scrolling) in preference to general purpose computing tasks. The first model of the alt=Computer networks appeared in two main styles; the local area network, linking computers in an office or school to each other, and the wide area network, linking the local area networks together. Initially, computers depended on the telephone networks to link to each other, spawning the Bulletin Board sub-culture. However, a DARPA project to create bomb-proof computer networks led to the creation of the Internet, a network of networks. The core of this network was the robust TCP/IP network protocol. Thanks to efforts from Al Gore, the Internet grew beyond its military role when universities and commercial businesses were permitted to connect their networks to it. The main impetus for this was electronic mail, a far faster and convenient form of communication than a conventional letter and memo distribution, and the File Transfer Protocol (FTP). However, the Internet remained largely unknown to the general public, who were used to Bulletin Boards and services like Compuserve and America Online. This changed when Tim Berners-Lee devised a simpler form of Vannevar Bush's hypertext, which he dubbed the World Wide Web. \\"The Web\\" suddenly changed the Internet into a printing press beyond the geographic boundaries of physical countries; it was termed \\"cyberspace\\". Anyone with a computer and an Internet connection could write pages in the simple HTML format and publish their thoughts to the world. The Web's immense success also fueled the commercial use of the Internet. Convenient home shopping had been an element of \\"visions of the future\\" since the development of the telephone, but now the race was on to provide convenient, interactive consumerism. Companies trading through websites became known as \\"dot coms\\", due to the \\".com\\" suffix of commercial Internet addresses.  The world at the end of the century  It was a long hurtful century and by the end of the century, more technological advances had been made than in all of preceding history. Communications and information technology, transportation technology, and medical advances had radically altered daily lives. Europe appeared to be at a sustainable peace for the first time in recorded history. The people of the Indian subcontinent, a sixth of the world population at the end of the century, had attained an indigenous independence for the first time in centuries. China, an ancient nation comprising a fifth of the world population, was finally open to the world in a new and powerful synthesis of west and east, creating a new state after the near-complete destruction of the old cultural order. With the end of colonialism and the Cold War, nearly a billion people in Africa were left with truly independent new nation states, some cut from whole cloth, standing up after centuries of foreign domination. The geographic distribution of surface warming during the 21st century calculated by the left The world was undergoing its second major period of globalization; the first, which started in the 19th century, having been terminated by World War I. Since the US was in a position of almost unchallenged domination, a major part of the process was Americanization. This led to anti-Western and anti-American feelings in parts of the world, especially the Middle East. The influence of China and India was also rising, as the world's largest populations, long marginalized by the West and by their own rulers, were rapidly integrating with the world economy. However, several problems faced the world. The gap between rich and poor nations continued to widen. Some said that this problem could not be fixed, that there was a set amount of wealth and it could only be shared by so many. Others said that the powerful nations with large economies were not doing enough to help improve the rapidly evolving economies of the Third World. However, developing countries faced many challenges, including the scale of the task to be surmounted, rapidly growing populations, and the need to protect the environment and the cost that goes along with it. Terrorism, dictatorship, and the spread of nuclear weapons were other issues requiring attention. The world was still blighted by small-scale wars and other violent conflicts, fueled by competition over resources and by ethnic conflicts. Despots such as Kim Jong-il of North Korea continued to lead their nations toward the development of nuclear weapons. Disease threatened to destabilize many regions of the world. New viruses such as SARS and West Nile continued to spread. In poor nations, malaria and other diseases affected the majority of the population. Millions were infected with HIV, the virus which causes AIDS. The virus was becoming an epidemic in southern Africa. Perhaps most importantly, it was speculated that in the long term, environmental problems threatened the planet's livability. The most serious problem was global warming, which was predicted to frequently flood coastal areas, due to human- caused emission of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide produced by the burning of fossil fuels. This prompted many nations to negotiate and sign the Kyoto treaty, which set mandatory limits on carbon dioxide emissions.

His mother died a year prior, her treatment consuming his family's wealth and leaving Mike emotionally scarred. Mike's good friend, Molly, does not know he is a drug dealer. Mike's supplier, Lionel, also deals with addictive drug cocktail \\"Twelve\\" to Mike's cousin, Charlie. Charlie attempts to mug Lionel, since he is unable to pay for the drug. Lionel shoots Charlie and shoots an innocent observer, Nana. Mike and Charlie's good friend, Hunter, is taken into custody for the murders. Several other young residents of this wealthy Manhattan scene are introduced at a party as customers of White Mike, including Tobias, Yvette, Sara, Jessica and the party's host, Chris. Jessica tries Twelve for the first time, leading to an addiction. During the party, Chris' older brother, Claude, a sociopath and weapon collector, returns home after breaking out of rehab. Their mother discovers this and threatens to call the police. Sara manipulates Chris into throwing a huge birthday party for her, just before the end of spring break. She and her friends invite everyone they know in order to make Sara's birthday \\"famous\\". Out of drugs and money, Jessica asks Lionel to stop by Sara's party so she can buy more Twelve. Tobias meets Molly during a drug deal with Mike, and invites her to Sara's party. Mike sees this, and calls him to get him away from Molly.

As the party starts, Claude locks himself in his room, practising with his weapons. Lionel arrives, but is furious with Jessica, as she does not have the money she promised. Since she has no money, she first offers him oral sex, then to have sex with him, which Lionel agrees. Mike's father calls him to deliver the news that Charlie is dead, his body identified. Mike tries to call Molly, who does not answer her phone. He goes to the party to locate her, but is stopped by several drunk party-goers. He accidentally stumbles upon Jessica and Lionel having sex. Startled, Lionel begins to draw out a gun, which Mike recognizes as Charlie's. As Mike begins to accuse Lionel of the murder, Lionel shoots him, causing Claude to pull out his weapons and begin shooting up the party. Teenagers rush out of the party, but many others are killed, including Lionel. Claude hears police sirens and runs outside to die in a suicide by cop fashion. As Sara lies dying, her last thought is how this will make her famous. Mike wakes up in the hospital and Molly reprimands him for his drug-dealing livelihood. He wants to call her when he is sent home, but she says no. Mike visits Nana's mother, and together they connect over their shared grief. Mike comes to terms with his mother's death.

He was appointed a judge at the trial of Charles I, but on the restoration escaped with a light punishment. Early life Lister was born in 1597, the eldest son of William and Griselle Lister (n√©e Rivett). He grew up at the family home, Coleby Hall in Lincolnshire and was admitted to Gray's Inn 1616. In 1622, he married Margaret Armine. Military and Parliamentary career On the outbreak of the English Civil War, Lister was arrested by a party of 60 royalist troopers led by the sheriff of Lincolnshire who broke into Coleby Hall and he was taken before the King's council. After his release he rose to become a lieutenant-colonel in the parliamentary army and deputy governor of Lincoln. In 1644 he served as high sheriff of Lincolnshire and also served as a member of the parliamentarian county committee. He was chosen as M.P. for Lincoln in 1647, replacing John Broxholme who had died. He survived Pride's Purge (the military coup that ejected from parliament MPs that did not support the army) and continued as the city's MP until 1653. He was nominated as a judge in the trial of Charles I, but only attended a few sessions of the court and did not sign the death warrant. In February 1651, he was appointed a member of the council of state. He was MP for the county of Lincolnshire in the Protectorate Parliaments but he once again represented the city in 1659 with the recall of the Rump Parliament. At the restoration, he was excluded from the Indemnity and Oblivion Act, because of his role in the trial and execution of Charles I and was tried for regicide. He knelt at the bar of the House of Lords and pleaded \\"deep repentance\\". He escaped with a light penalty, being forbidden to hold public office from 1660.

Carrier-based aircraft, sometimes known as carrier- capable aircraft or carrier-borne aircraft, are naval aircraft designed for operations from aircraft carriers. They must be able to launch in a short distance and be sturdy enough to withstand the abrupt forces of launching from and recovering on a pitching deck. In addition, their wings are generally able to fold up, easing operations in tight quarters. Such aircraft are designed for many purposes including air-to-air combat, surface attack, anti-submarine warfare (ASW), search and rescue (SAR), transport (COD), weather observation, reconnaissance and airborne early warning and control (AEW&C;) duties.Fred T Jane (2005). Jane's All the World's Aircraft. Jane's Information Group. The term is generally applied only to fixed-wing aircraft, as naval helicopters are able to operate from a wider variety of ships, including helicopter carriers, destroyers, frigates and container ships. History The 1903 advent of fixed-wing aircraft was followed in 1910 by the first flight of an aircraft from the deck of an anchored warship (the United States Navy's ), and in 1912, by the first flight of an aircraft from the deck of a warship underway (the Royal Navy's ). Seaplanes and seaplane tender support ships, such as , followed. This evolution was well underway by the early 1920s, resulting in ships such as (1918), (1922), (1922), and (1927). With these developments, the need for specialized aircraft adapted for take-offs and landings from the flight decks of those ships became recognized. Grumman Martlet lining up the flight deck of . The first carrier landing and take- off of a jet aircraft, by a De Havilland Vampire in 1945. The significance of air power grew between the wars, driven by the increased range, carrying power, and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft, until it became impossible to disregard its importance during World War II, following the loss of many warships to aircraft, including the sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse, the Battle of Taranto, the Attack on Pearl Harbor and numerous other incidents. Following the war, carrier operations continued to increase in size and importance.http://www.history.navy.mil/download/car-7.pdf Types A-4 Skyhawk Indian Air Force Sea Harrier STOVL aircraft. USMC OV-10 Broncos aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Saipan in 1987. Su-33 STOBAR aircraft. Modern carrier-based aircraft are built in mainly three different versions to suit the needs of its various users. The following terms are those used currently by the U.S. Navy. Catapult-assisted take-off but arrested recovery CATOBAR is a system used for the launch and recovery of aircraft from the deck of an aircraft carrier. Under this technique, aircraft are launched using a catapult-assisted take-off and landing on the ship using arresting wires. Although this system is more costly than alternative methods, it provides greater flexibility in carrier operations, since it allows the aircraft to operate with higher payloads. Ships with CATOBAR currently include the U.S. , the U.S. Gerald R. Ford-class, and France's . The use of catapults allows an aircraft carrier to launch large fixed-wing aircraft. For example, the U.S. Navy launches its E-2 Hawkeye AEW aircraft and C-2A Greyhound cargo aircraft with catapults. Short take-off and vertical landing STOVL take- offs are accomplished with \\"ski-jumps\\", instead of a catapult. STOVL use usually allows aircraft to carry a larger payload as compared to during VTOL use, while avoiding the complexity of a catapult. The best known example is the Hawker Siddeley Harrier Jump Jet,\\"Hawker Siddeley Harrier.\\" British Aircraft Directory. Retrieved: 1 July 2017. despite being capable of VTOL take-offs, is usually operated as a STOVL aircraft to increase its fuel and weapons load. Short take-off but arrested recovery STOBAR is a system used for the launch and recovery of aircraft from the deck of an aircraft carrier, combining elements of both STOVL and CATOBAR. Aircraft launch under their own power using a ski-jump to assist take-off (rather than using a catapult). These are conventional aircraft however and require arresting wires to land on the ship. The Kuznetsov-class aircraft carriers of the Russian Navy and People's Liberation Army Navy operate the Su-33 (Russia) and J-15 (China) as STOBAR aircraft. Others include the Indian and the future ; both will operate MiG-29Ks. Unassisted take-off Prior to World War II, the weight of most aircraft allowed them to be launched from aircraft carriers under their own power, but required assistance in stopping. Catapults were installed but were used only when the ship was stationary or adequate wind over the deck could not be arranged by sailing into the wind. Even aircraft as large as the North American B-25 Mitchell were launched in this manner. This was possible because the ship's speed with even the lightest prevailing winds, combined with a low take-off speed allowed early aircraft to gain flying speed in a very short distance. The most extreme version of this was the battleship platforms used during the 1920s when small, World War I-era biplane fighters such as the Sopwith Camel were launched from only a few dozen feet long mounted atop of a battleship's forward gun turret. Conventional aircraft, such as the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, Republic P-47 Thunderbolt, Supermarine Spitfire, and Hawker Hurricane, were often delivered to overseas air bases by aircraft carrier. They would be loaded onto an aircraft carrier in port by cranes, flown off the carrier at sea near their destination under their own power, and land on a friendly airfield ashore. These were not usually combat missions but in some cases the launched aircraft provided air cover for the ship, and the aircraft could not be recovered by the carrier. Some STOL aircraft, such as the North American Rockwell OV-10 Bronco, have been operated from aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships in this manner more recently, but this is not common practice. Even very large aircraft such as the Lockheed C-130 Hercules have been successfully landed and launched from large aircraft carriers, but was done with no cargo and little fuel on board the aircraft.

They competed in the North East Australian Football League from 2011‚Äì13 and as of 2014 are a member club of the AFL Canberra First Grade competition.2014 AFL Canberra First Grade clubs The club also fields teams in the AFL Canberra rising stars (under 19) competition, third grade and women's competitions. History The club was actually formed as long ago as 1968 by a group of Department of Supply employees, recently transferred to Canberra from Melbourne. Adopting red and white as its colours, the team bore the name of Eastlake-Woden in recognition of the fact that it was sponsored by the Eastlake Football Club. Eastlake-Woden later became South Woden, and later still Sutherland. They first found competition in the Monaro Football League. They are the only club in graduate from a minor league into the Territory's major football competition. In 1976 Sutherland was admitted to the ACTAFL at under 19 level before adding reserves and senior teams in 1977 and 1979 respectively. Initially, the team found the going tough, but following a name change to Tuggeranong in 1983 fortunes began to improve. In 1986, under captain-coach Hans Heystraten, premiership success was finally achieved following a thrilling one-point grand final defeat of one of Canberra's foremost perennial football forces, Queanbeyan. In 1994 the club welcomed former St Kilda, Ainslie and Central District identity Kevin \\"Cowboy\\" Neale as senior coach and immediately adopted the Cowboys emblem, which it retained until forging an alliance with AFL club Hawthorn in 2003, whereupon it became known as the Hawks. The club has seen disappointing results since then as 2002 was the last year the first grade team made the finals. Numerous times the club has finished fifth on the ladder, just missing out on finals as well as claiming the wooden spoon from 2008‚Äì10. Since 2013, under Senior Coach Nathan Costigan the club reached back to back finals campaigns, including the 2015 preliminary final. The reserve grade side was crowned 2015 Premiers. Costigan resigned in 2017 and Peter Ashcroft was appointed Senior Coach. In 2020 the club reconstituted itself to become Tuggeranong Valley Football Club.

Contraception In 1963, Pope John XXIII established a commission of six European non-theologians to study questions of birth control and population. Neither John XXIII nor Paul VI wanted the almost three thousand bishops and other clerics then in Rome for Vatican II to address the birth control issue even though many of these bishops expressed their desire to bring this pressing pastoral issue before the Council. The disagreements within the commission ultimately led to the publication of the encyclical Humanae Vitae. Human Rights Pope John XXIII was a strong advocate for human rights including those of the unborn and the elderly. He wrote most passionately about human rights in his final encyclical Pacem in Terris issued in 1963 only a few months before his death. In it he wrote, \\"Man has the right to live. He has the right to bodily integrity and to the means necessary for the proper development of life, particularly food, clothing, shelter, medical care, rest, and, finally, the necessary social services. In consequence, he has the right to be looked after in the event of ill health; disability stemming from his work; widowhood; old age; enforced unemployment; or whenever through no fault of his own he is deprived of the means of livelihood.\\" Divorce Regarding divorce, he said that ‚ÄúWe must solemnly proclaim that human life is transmitted by means of the family, the family founded on marriage, one and indissoluble, raised for Christians to the dignity of a Sacrament.‚ÄùMater et Magistra, 193 Ordination of gay seminarians A 1961 document approved by Pope John was entitled Careful Selection And Training Of Candidates For The States Of Perfection And Sacred Orders. It stated that homosexual men should not be ordained, although this was left to bishops to enforce, and most did not, holding homosexuals to the same standards of celibate chastity as heterosexual seminarians.Careful Selection And Training Of Candidates For The States Of Perfection And Sacred Orders Clerical abuse affairs The document known as Crimen sollicitationis was issued by the Holy Office on March 16, 1962 and was presented by Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani to Pope John XXIII for his approval. It was then sent to all the bishops in the world, who were ordered to maintain a strict confidentiality about any matters of sexual abuse by priests.Commentary on Crimen sollicitationis Artificial insemination He also stated that ‚Äúthe transmission of human life is entrusted by nature to a personal and conscious act, and, as such, subject to the all-wise laws of God: laws inviolable and immutable that are to be recognized and observed. Therefore, it is not permissible to use means and follow methods that can be licit for the transmission of plant or animal life.‚Äù  See also  *Catholic moral theology References Category:Pope John XXIII Category:Religious views on birth control ","title":"Moral theology of John XXIII"},{"id":"24151378","text":"The High Road to Taos is a scenic, winding road through the Sangre de Cristo Mountains between Santa Fe and Taos. (The \\"Low Road\\" runs through the valleys along the Rio Grande). It winds through high desert, mountains, forests, small farms, and tiny Spanish Land Grant villages and Pueblo Indian villages. Scattered along the way are the galleries and studios of traditional artisans and artists drawn by the natural beauty. It has been recognized by the state of New Mexico as an official Scenic Byway. Description Namb√© The High Road to Taos Scenic Byway begins north of Santa Fe in Pojoaque, New Mexico, at the intersection of U.S. 285/84 and State Road 503. It continues along State Road 503 to Namb√© Pueblo. Founded in the 14th century, Namb√© means \\"People of the Round Earth\\" in Tewa, their native language. The pueblo plaza is a registered National Historic Landmark. The church on State Road 503 is not original; ill-considered efforts to restore the grand original church caused it to collapse. The pueblo encompasses of land with waterfalls, lakes, and mountainous areas. Until about 1830, Nambe was known for a pottery style called Nambe Polychrome. Today, pottery is making a comeback, especially black-on-black and red-on-white. Weaving is also reemerging. Chimay√≥ The road continues through the rolling hills and wind-carved hoodoos of the badlands. At , the High Road turns left onto State Road 98 (Juan Medina Road), which continues across the open, rolling high desert until it dips down to the green, farming valley of Chimay√≥. Visitors often stop at the historic Santuario de Chimay√≥. Built between 1811‚Äì16, this tiny church is visited by pilgrims from all over the United States and old Mexico, especially on Good Friday of Easter week, when crowds swell to the thousands. A little farther on is the Rancho de Chimay√≥ Restaurant, housed in a historic adobe building. Chimay√≥ also has many traditional weaving studios owned by descendants of the original Spanish settlers. C√≥rdova Where State Road 98 dead-ends, the road turns right onto State Road 76 and begins the climb into the Sangre de Cristo Mountains and the little villages of the High Road. First is C√≥rdova, a collection of narrow streets above a river valley, accessible via a road on the right. C√≥rdova is known for its traditional woodcarvers, such as George L√≥pez, who carve santos (saints) in the \\"C√≥rdova Style\\": unpainted but elaborately carved and featuring the distinctive grain and shape of the wood. A very short drive takes you into the village and back to State Road 76. Truchas The road continues to climb to the top of a high mesa and the village of Truchas, a scattering of adobe houses backed by the snow-capped Truchas Peaks. (The High Road and State Road 76 turn left, but much of the village is straight ahead on State Road 75.) This Hispanic farming community once furnished the set for the movie version of the John Nichols novel The Milagro Beanfield War. Truchas was established by a royal land grant in 1754 to create a buffer against nomadic Apache and Comanche bands who often raided both Spanish villages and Native American pueblos. Hence, it was built as a walled compound around a plaza. Its settlers hand-dug miles of acequias (irrigation ditches) to bring water from the trout-filled river that gave the town its name. Although today's residents still work their farms, many commute to jobs in Santa Fe or Los Alamos. A few still make their living as traditional craftspeople alongside the many European-American artists and galleries that have been drawn to Truchas's mountain views. Ojo Sarco The High Road continues along State Road 76 through the Carson National Forest to a series of very small villages. First is Ojo Sarco, believed to be named for a spring in a nearby ca√±ada (glen). The name was sometimes spelled Ojo Zarco; ojo is now translated as \\"eye\\" in Spanish, but also used to mean \\"spring\\" and zarco means \\"light blue\\", hence \\"blue spring\\". Las Trampas Church of San Jos√© de Gracia in Las Trampas Next is Las Trampas, founded in 1751 by a royal land grant, \\"Santo Tom√°s Apostol del R√≠o de las Trampas\\" (\\"Saint Thomas, Apostle of the River of Traps\\"). Despite the heavy toll taken by a smallpox epidemic and raids by Plains Indians, the village of Las Trampas survived and the settlers managed to build the stately San Jos√© de Gracia Church, completed in 1776. It is a National Historic Landmark, and the village is a National Historic District. The building across from the church with the little bell tower was the school. El Valle and Ojito State Road 76 continues through the Carson National Forest. Smaller roads lead off to El Valle and Ojito, both settled by colonists from Las Trampas. Both are accessed by scenic drives through the forest. Chamisal The next village on SR 76 is Chamisal. It, too, was settled by Spanish villagers moving out from Las Trampas; all of these villages lie within the Las Trampas land grant. Chamisal is probably named for the \\"chamisa\\" shrub (Chrysothamnus, or rabbitbrush) which turns golden in late summer. Chamisal Creek flows northwest to join the Pe√±asco River. There is a small, old church in the village (follow the sign to the old plaza). Picur√≠s When SR 76 ends at a stop sign, the High Road turns right onto State Road 75. However, turn left to visit Picur√≠s Pueblo. Spanish explorer Don Juan de O√±ate called these people \\"pikuria\\"‚Äîthose who paint. Before the Spanish came, Picur√≠s was one of the largest and most powerful of the pueblos, located at the confluence of two rivers and on a major pass that leads through the mountains to the Great Plains in the east. This strategic location made it a key site for trade with the Apaches, but once the Comanches arrived and the Spanish brought horses, the pueblo became vulnerable to attack. The fierce Picur√≠s continued to fight the Spanish even after the Reconquest, and lost many members of the tribe as a result. Like Taos Pueblo, Picur√≠s is a Tiwa pueblo. Picur√≠s today, while small, has a thriving buffalo herd and runs a hotel in Santa Fe. It is known for its gold- hued micaceous pottery (featuring flecks of shiny mica). When the 200-year-old San Lorenzo de Picur√≠s church collapsed in 1989 due to water damage, pueblo members rebuilt it by hand. San Lorenzo Feast Day is August 10. (Tribal members request that visitors get permission before taking photos anywhere on the pueblo.) Pe√±asco The High Road continues on State Road 75 into Pe√±asco. The villages of Llano San Juan, Llano Largo, and Santa Barbara in the Pe√±asco area were first settled by Spanish colonists in 1796, the same year as Taos. Today the town of Pe√±asco serves residents in the many villages and rural areas surrounding it, as well as the residents of Picur√≠s Pueblo. Llano San Juan and Llano de la Yegua Leaving Pe√±asco, the High Road and State Road 75 make a wide curve to the left. Going straight onto State Road 73 offers a side trip into Llano San Juan and Llano de la Yegua. (A llano is a \\"broad, treeless plain.\\") These are lush, green valleys flanked by steep mesas. Vadito The High Road continues along State Road 75 through the tiny village of Vadito, which means \\"little ford.\\" Beyond Vadito, the road passes through the valley of Placita. Sipapu At the \\"stone wall\\" intersection, the High Road turns left onto State Road 518 to Ranchos de Taos. However, just a few miles east on SR 518 is Sipapu Ski Resort and Recreation Area. The drive to Sipapu through the Carson National Forest is very scenic, and there are numerous trails and fishing spots on the Rio Pueblo. Talpa The High Road turns northwest along SR 518 and passes through more valleys and vistas of the Carson National Forest. Eventually it reaches Talpa, the last High Road village. Talpa is an ancient site; pit houses and pueblos were built here from 1100 to 1300. It was settled by Spanish colonists in the early 18th century, about the same time as Taos. Talpa, which means \\"knob\\", may refer to a formation in one of Talpa's little canyons. Ranchos de Taos San Francisco de Asis Church in 1934. Its appearance has changed little since then. Although the High Road officially ends where SR 518 meets SR 68 in Ranchos de Taos, symbolically it ends at the famous San Francisco de Asis Mission Church a few blocks south. This is probably one of the most painted and photographed churches in the nation‚Äîespecially the buttresses in the back, famously painted by Georgia O'Keeffe and photographed by Paul Strand and Ansel Adams. Completion of its construction took from 1772 to 1815.

Russian Government Resolution ‚Ññ 404 of 29 May 2008 transferred Rostekhnadzor to the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment; previously, the service had been directly subordinate to the government. However, this was reversed by President Dmitry Medvedev on 23 June 2010, when he brought it back under the direct control of the government. In accordance with RF Government Resolution No. 54 of 1 February 2006, Rostekhnadzor was entrusted with oversight of the construction industry. History Rostekhnadzor was created in 2004, in a merger of the Federal Atomic Oversight Service and the Federal Technological Oversight Service. Environmental oversight functions were transferred to it after the Federal Environmental and Natural Resource Oversight Service was transformed into the Federal Natural Resources Oversight Service. The combined structure was initially headed by the former director of Federal Atomic Oversight, Andrey Malyshev, who was acting director of the new service for 18 months. From 5 December 2005 to 20 September 2008, the service was headed by Konstantin Pulikovsky. The current head of Rostekhnadzor is Alexey Aleshin. Structure Since September 2009, Rostekhnadzor has consisted of a headquarters, 23 regional departments for industrial and environmental supervision in federal districts, 7 interregional departments for nuclear and radiation safety, and 4 technical support organizations. In turn, the Headquarters has 16 departments organized by function.

The 5th Infantry Division conducted the main attack while the 6th Armored Division provided support. The city was defended by the LXXX Corps of the Seventh Army.  Prelude  The 5th Infantry Division crossed the Rhine on 22 March and quickly established a bridgehead. By 23 March, the 5th had expanded its bridgehead five miles east, putting the division only 14 miles southwest of Frankfurt. Armored Task Forces pushed from the bridgehead then to the North towards Trebur and Gustavsburg and to the East towards Darmstadt. On 25 March, the Wehrmacht Commander of the Darmstadt garrison surrendered and Darmstadt was liberated by the 6th Armored and 5th Infantry Divisions. By 26 March, the 5th reached the southern outskirts of the city of Frankfurt and captured the Rhine-Main airbase.  Battle  The 6th linked up with the 5th and pushed through the southern outskirts (Sachsenhausen) to the river Main. There, units of the 5th found the mostly intact Wilhelmsbruecke bridge (today known as the Friedensbruecke). German engineers had tried to blow it up in the attempt to stop the US Forces on 25 March but failed to do so. Supported by US tank artillery, the troops of the 5th crossed the Wilhelmsbruecke under heavy fire on 27 March and entered the northern part of the city. The two divisions then fought the Germans in fierce house-to-house combat, slowly pushing through the city to the north and to the east. Allied attacks killed the local commander on 27 March, crippling German military command in the city. On 29 March, the city was brought under American control and a pontoon bridge built by combat engineers on the eastern side of the damaged Wilhelmsbruecke. After initially attempting to set up defensive machine gun positions, German soldiers were convinced by citizens to leave the city and minimise additional casualties. The remaining Wehrmacht are pushed northwards and out of the city by US troops.  Aftermath  AFN Luxembourg reported the city as liberated, however, small sporadic fighting continued until 4 April. Vogue war correspondent Lee Miller accompanied General Patton's Third Army and was among the first to report in the U.S. press on the liberation of Frankfurt. The Stars & Stripes reported the city as liberated on 30 March. After capturing Frankfurt, the 5th Division spent a few days resting until 7 April when it was ordered to move north to support the III Corps of the First Army in the Ruhr Pocket.

Mahen Theatre, built as German Deutsches Stadttheater in 1882, was one of the first public buildings in the world lit entirely by electric light.Ort (2007), p. 82 It was built in a combination of Neo-renaissance, Neo-baroque and Neoclassical architectural styles. History The city theatre Reduta in Brno burned down in 1870, and the city council decided to build a new theatre building within a short time period. Thanks to the efforts of then mayor Gustav Winterholler, the decision was taken to build a bigger and better theatre at the place of Obstplatz (today's Malinovsk√Ω square).Ort (2007), p. 38 The commission was assigned to the renowned Vienna architectural studio Fellner and Helmer. The studio was specialized in projects of theatre buildings. Around 1880, their modern type of theatre building was considered a model. The founding stone was laid on July 18, 1881. The construction went smoothly, taking only 16 months from start to opening of the theatre.Ort (2007), p. 58 During the construction it was necessary to change the building's inner disposition several times. The main reason for this was the devastating fires which were affecting European theatres at the time. In March 1881, a fire in the Th√©√¢ter Royal in Nice killed almost 200 people. In August 1881, a fire destroyed the copper dome, the auditorium and stage of the National Theatre in Prague. The same year, another fire in Ringtheater in Vienna killed at least 384. The builders of the new theatre in Brno decided to take action in order to avoid similar incidents. New exits and additional side stairways were included in the plans. However, the most important decision was to replace the proposed gas lighting with a new invention: the electric light. In the middle of 1881, Brno city council negotiated a contract with the Edison Electric Light Company. The plans were designed by Thomas Edison himself, and the project was constructed by French and Austrian manufacturers, under the supervision of Edison's assistant Francis Jehl.Ort (2007), p. 81 The power station had to be built in a distant place, almost 300m away from the theatre, to ensure noise minimization.Ort (2007), p. 60 (at Offermanngasse, today's Vlhk√° Street) Amongst other things, the equipment of the power station consisted of four large dynamos imported from New York. Thomas Edison wasn't present at the installation of the device, he visited Brno only 25 years later. The theatre was opened on November 14, 1882 with the festive overture Consecration of the House by Ludwig van Beethoven. The opening celebration continued with the play \\"U pan√≠ Bruny\\", written by the German director of the theatre, Adolf Franckel, and ended with Goethe's Egmont.Ort (2007), p. 62‚Äì63 Initially, Mahen Theatre was a German opera house, and it was called Deutsches Stadttheater (German City Theatre). In 1918, following World War I, it passed into the hands of the newly founded Czechoslovak state. It was renamed Divadlo na Hradb√°ch (Theatre on the City Walls) and the first dramatical adviser became the novelist and playwright Ji≈ô√≠ Mahen, after whom the theatre has been named since 1965. In 1936, the theatre was largely reconstructed by the company Kolben - Danƒõk. Thanks to the reconstruction, it became one of the most modern theatre buildings in Czechoslovakia. Today's Mahen Theatre served mainly as an opera house, until the building of Jan√°ƒçek Theatre in 1965. Five of the late operas by Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek were premiered here, as well as the ballet Romeo and Juliet by Sergei Prokofiev.

Between 1961 and 1998, Nordenstam held teaching positions at the Universities of Khartoum, Ume√•, and Bergen. In Bergen, he was first Reader in Philosophy (1968-81) and later Professor of Philosophy (1981-98). He is currently Professor Emeritus from Bergen. In his philosophical career, Nordenstam moved from the analytical philosophy of language into ethics, aesthetics and the philosophy of the humanities. Nordenstam has published a number of books, the most important of which are Sudanese Ethics (Stockholm: The Scandinavian Institute of African Studies / Almqvist & Wiksell, 1968) and, much more recently, The Power of Example (Stockholm: Sant√∂rus Academic Press, 2009); the content of the latter appeared earlier in Swedish as Exemplets makt in Dialoger 69-70 (Stockholm, 2005). He has also published a goodly number of journal articles, mostly classifiable into the areas mentioned above, and some closely related to his book projects.

It climbs south east from the A36 towards the University of Bath on Claverton Down, providing views over the city. Sham Castle, Bath To the north is Sham Castle, a folly built in 1762 by Richard James, master mason for Ralph Allen, \\"to improve the prospect\\" from Allen's town house in Bath. It is a screen wall with a central pointed arch flanked by two 3-storey circular turrets, which extend sideways to a 2-storey square tower at each end of the wall. It is illuminated at night. As the hill rises away from the city centre it passes over a tunnel, built in 1840, on the Great Western Railway close to Bath Spa railway station and the Kennet and Avon Canal at Bath Locks via an elliptical arch bridge. Houses Numbers 1 to 23 are on the south side and numbers 35 onwards on the north side. South side Number 1 (Bathwick Lodge) is a 2-storey villa with a steep Mansard room, built in 1825, extended in 1840 and the late C19. Probably by John Pinch the Elder. Number 2 is from the early 19th century and has shutters over the windows. Number 3 includes a porch which is elaborately enriched with carving, Neo-Grecian gate posts and wrought iron gates. Number 4 has a parapet which sweeps up to central balustrade with a rococo flourish, as does number 5 which is also known as Cornwall Lodge. Number 6, which is also known as Willow House, includes a wrought iron verandah on the 1st floor. Number 7 has a shallow hipped roof. Number 8 has also been known as Upsala Villa and later as Mendip Lodge.Mendip Lodge property details http://media.primelocation.com/PRPRGR/PRPR/PRPR3377/BROCH_01.pdf The road elevation of number 9, built in 1820, extended in 1870, presents half an octagon in plan with overhanging eaves. Number 10 is a 2-storey Neo-Grecian villa built in the early 19th century by Thomas Baldwin. The central projection has a curved portico with 4 fluted Ionic columns and Ionic pilasters which go through 2 floors. It is a Grade II* listed building. Numbers 11, 12 and 13 form a block of attached villas. Number 14 is also from the early 19th century. Number 15, which is also known as The White Loge, is of a similar vintage and includes a 2-storey porch with Doric columns, as does number 17. Number 18 is from the late 18th or early 19th century and includes a wrought iron veranda, and number 19, which is also known as Woodland House, has a balustraded parapet. Numbers 20 and 21 form a block. Number 22 has a rusticated ground floor and quoins. Number 23 was built in 1817 by William Smith of Walcot, for J Barnard. It is a 3-storey building with a mansard roof. Claverton Lodge was built around 1825 and later enlarged and altered in classical style when a columned loggia porch with a conical roof was added. Combe Royal was built in Jacobethan style between 1815 and 1820. The lodge is in a similar style. North side Number 35 is a 3-storey building with a portico of 4 Doric columns, while numbers 36 and 37 form a block of two semi- detached houses. Number 38, which is also known as Bayfield House, has a portico with Doric columns, while numbers 39 and 40 form a block of two semi- detached houses similar to numbers 36 and 37. Ardenlee is thought to be an early 19th-century recasing of an earlier building. Woodland Place is a Regency terrace of six houses, designed in about 1826 by Henry Goodridge. The large Italianate villa, Bathwick Grange, which was formerly known as Montebello, was built by Goodridge as his own house, and includes a lodge. He is also though to have built Bathwick Hill House next door. Fiesole is another Italianate house probably by Goodridge which later became a Youth Hostel. Oakwood, which was formerly known as Smallcombe Grove, which is also in the style of Goodridge was built for local painter Benjamin Barker. It has an ornamental garden, bridge and pool with fountain. Casa Bianca and La Casetta also have an Italianate style and include Tuscan columns. Miles House followed in a similar style around 1840 to 1850. Uplands dates from around 1840, and Upton House has been dated to the early 19th century.

Babel has provisions for using multiple dynamically computed metrics; by default, it uses hop-count on wired networks and a variant of ETX on wireless links, but can be configured to take radio diversity into account or to automatically compute a link's latency and include it in the metric. Babel operates on IPv4 and IPv6 networks. It has been reported to be a robust protocol and to have fast convergence properties. In October 2015, Babel was chosen as the mandatory-to-implement protocol by the IETF Homenet working group, albeit on an Experimental basis.http://mid.gmane.org/562F5B00.9010802@bellis.me.uk In June 2016, an IETF working group was created whose main goal is to produce a standard version of Babel.

There are 97 named mountains in the Paulina Mountains, the tallest and most famous one being Paulina Peak, which sits at 7,969 feet in elevation. \\"Paulina Peak serves as the highest point of the Newberry Volcano, a large active stratovolcano that sits just 35 miles east of the crest of the Cascade Range. These summits are actually the remnants of an old crater called the Newberry Crater. The Newberry Volcano covers an area the size of Rhode Island and has erupted repeatedly over the past 400,000 years. Although the volcano hasn‚Äôt erupted recently, its unique composition and numerous volcanic vents make it prone to very explosive and destructive eruptions.  Hiking Trails  The Paulina Mountains contains 50,000 acres of lakes, lava flows, geological features, and incredible cinder cones to explore. Paulina Peak offers sweeping views of the Newberry Caldera, the south and west flanks of the Newberry Volcano, the nearby Cascades, and the Fort Rock Basin. Paulina Peak can be accessed via a scenic road or a 6.1-mile out and back trail. The Newberry Caldera is where most visitors go to experience scenic hiking trails and is the largest developed area in within the national monument. Paulina and East Lake offer ample opportunities for boating, kayaking, or fishing. There are also twelve different trails that range from .25 miles to 21 miles long. Several of these trails offer informative, interpretive signs, picnic areas, and even hot springs for tourists to enjoy. In the winter, this region becomes a popular destination for snow activities such as skiing, snowmobiling, and snowshoeing. The Crater Rim Trail circumnavigates the Newberry Volcano Rim and allows hikers to hike along the rim and drop down to get up close to the lake. In addition, there are a few trails that lead from the Crater Rim Trail to both Paulina Peak and North Paulina Peak. The Lava River Cave is an interesting, less tiresome adventure that allows visitors to explore a mile- long lava tube. The trek takes around 1.5 hours to complete and descends to flat boardwalks and stairways leading through the features of the tube.

There are several classic cabins, tent sites, and RV sites available for rent, as well as a pub-style grill and on-site general store.  Sunriver Resort  The Sunriver Resort sits in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains. It is just minutes from the Newberry National Volcanic Monument and contains hundreds of vacation rentals to choose from. Sunriver receives more than 300 days of sunshine and offers an endless amount of outdoor recreational activities. There are many hiking trails nearby, a modern observatory, rafting trips to cruise down the nearbyv Deschutes River, and in the winter, plenty of snow activites availible at nearby Mount Bachelor.  Bend  Bend is the largest city near the Paulina Mountains and sits on the eastern edge of the Cascade Range along the Deschutes River. Bend is a popular destination for Oregon explorers looking to partake in a variety of outdoor sports like hiking, mountain biking, fishing, camping, rock climbing, paragliding, and white-water rafting.

He is particularly noted for his writings on modern classical music and for having written the libretti for two 20th century operas, Tan Dun's Marco Polo and Elliott Carter's What Next?. Career Paul Griffiths was born on 24 November 1947 in the Welsh town of Bridgend to Fred and Jeanne Griffiths.The New York Times (13 December 1998) He received his BA and MSc in biochemistry from Lincoln College, Oxford, and from 1971 worked as a freelance music critic. He joined the editorial staff of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians in 1973 and in 1982 became the chief music critic for The Times, a post which he held for ten years. From 1992 to 1996, he was a music critic for The New Yorker, and from 1997 to 2005, for The New York Times. A collection of his musical criticism for these and other periodicals was published in 2005 as The substance of things heard: writings about music, Volume 31 of Eastman Studies in Music. In 1978, he also began writing reference books and monographs on classical music and composers starting with Modern music: A Concise History from Debussy to Boulez and Boulez (Volume 16 of Oxford Studies of Composers). Although the majority of these publications have dealt with 20th-century composers and their music, he has also written more general works on classical music, including The String Quartet: A History (1985), The Penguin Companion to Classical Music (2005), and A Concise History of Western Music (2006). The last of these has been translated into seven languages. Griffiths has been a guest lecturer at institutions including the University of Southern California, IRCAM, Oxford University, Harvard University, Cornell University (Messenger Lectures, 2008) and the City University of New York Graduate Center (Old Lecture, 2013), and has served on juries for international competitions, among them the Premio Paolo Borciani and the ARD Musikwettbewerb. He was named a Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2002 and a Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2011, when he also won a Deems Taylor Award for his notes for Miller Theatre. In 1989, Griffiths published his first novel, Myself and Marco Polo: A Novel of Changes, which went on to win the 1990 Commonwealth Writers' Prize for the best first novel in the Europe and South Asia region. The novel is a fictional version of Marco Polo's memoirs which he dictated to Rustichello da Pisa, his fellow inmate in the Genoese prison where he had been incarcerated upon his return from China. (Rustichello is the \\"myself\\" of the title.) Two years later, he published his second novel, The Lay of Sir Tristram, a retelling of the Tristan and Iseult legend interjected with the narrator's own love story and his meditations on the legend's fluctuating influence and interpretation over time.Grimbert (2002) pp. xcvi ‚Äì xcvii Griffiths's most recent novel, let me tell you (2008), uses a constrained writing technique similar to those employed by the avant-garde Oulipo group. In let me tell you, Ophelia tells her story in a first-person narrative devised by Griffiths using only the 481 word vocabulary given to her in Shakespeare's Hamlet.Tonkin (16 January 2009). See also the lengthy extract from the novel and Griffiths's commentary in \\"From let me tell you\\" , Golden Handcuffs Review, Winter ‚Äì Spring 2007, Vol. 1, No. 8 Griffiths's first excursion as an opera librettist was The Jewel Box which used music from Mozart's unfinished operas Lo sposo deluso and L'oca del Cairo as well as several arias and ensembles that he had written for insertion into operas by other composers. The story-line is an imagined reconstruction of a pantomime in which Mozart and Aloysia Weber are said to have taken part in 1783. The Jewel Box premiered in 1991 in Nottingham performed by Opera North and conducted by Elgar Howarth. It was subsequently performed in the United States by Skylight Opera Theatre (1993), Wolf Trap Opera (1994), Chicago Opera Theater (1996), and New Jersey State Opera (1996). It was revived by Bampton Classical Opera in 2006 for the 250th anniversary of Mozart's birth. His second work of this type, Aeneas in Hell, was set to songs and dance music from Purcell's theatre scores and was devised as a \\"prequel\\" to the composer's 1689 opera, Dido and Aeneas. It premiered in 1995 at the University of Maryland's Ulrich Recital Hall conducted by Kenneth Slowik.McLellan (20 November 1995) Griffiths's libretto for Tan Dun's Marco Polo was his first for an opera by a living composer. In the late 1980s Tan Dun has been commissioned by the Edinburgh International Festival to compose an original opera. As he recounted in a 1997 interview: > I first tried to write the libretto myself, about something from myself, and > wasn't getting anywhere. Then someone, in 1990, said why not read Paul > Griffiths's novel Myself and Marco Polo? I read it and phoned him at his > home near Oxford. And he agreed to write a libretto.Tan Dun quoted in Kerner > (11 November 1997) Marco Polo finally received its world premiere in 1996, not in Edinburgh as originally planned, but in Munich at the Munich Biennale. Although Griffiths's libretto was not directly related to or based on his novel, the first line of the opera, \\"I have not told one half of what I saw\\", was the novel's final statement. Griffiths's next commission as a librettist was for Elliott Carter's only opera, What Next?. The work premiered in 1999 at Berlin's Staatsoper Unter den Linden, conducted by Daniel Barenboim who also conducted its US premiere in a concert performance by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra the following year.Tommasini (10 December 2007) In addition to his original libretti, Griffiths has produced modern English translations of those for Stravinsky's Histoire du soldat, Mozart's Die Zauberfl√∂te, and Puccini's La boh√®me. Griffiths has also written original texts for non-operatic settings, including The General, which premiered in Montreal on 16 January 2007, with Kent Nagano conducting the Montreal Symphony Orchestra. The General, a concert piece for symphony orchestra, narrator, soprano and chorus was conceived by Nagano as a tribute the Canadian General Rom√©o Dallaire. Griffiths's narrative texts, inspired by Dallaire's attempts to stop the Rwandan genocide, are interwoven with the music from Beethoven's complete Egmont score, other theatre music and Opferlied (Song of Sacrifice).CBC News (18 January 2007) Other musical collaborations have come out of his novel let me tell you, including there is still time, subtitled \\"scenes for speaking voice and cello\\", with spoken narration accompanying music by the cellist-composer Frances-Marie Uitti. The work was recorded in 2003 by ECM Records with Griffiths himself as the narrator.Alan Rich (30 June 2005) More directly connected to the novel is a concert work by Hans Abrahamsen, also titled let me tell you and composed for Barbara Hannigan with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, who gave the first performance on 20 December 2013, Andris Nelsons conducting. Griffiths was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2014 New Year Honours for services to music, literature, and composition. Paul Griffiths's second marriage took place in 1998.
