He was the fourth son of Mieszko I of Poland, the third born from his second marriage with Oda, daughter of Dietrich of Haldensleben, Margrave of the North March. Life Nothing is known about his early years. Lambert's first appearance was in the document called \\"Dagome iudex\\" (ca. 991‚Äì92), along with his parents and brother Mieszko. After Mieszko I's death (25 May 992), the war began between Boles≈Çaw I and his half-brothers for the paternal heritage, a dispute which according to some historians lasted only a few weeks, and according to others, only finished in 995. Despite the tensions between both parties, Boles≈Çaw I's first son with Emnilda of Lusatia was probably named after him; it's expected that the choice of this name for his son was an expression of warming relations between Boles≈Çaw I and his stepmother Oda.K. Jasi≈Ñski, Rodow√≥d pierwszych Piast√≥w, p. 114. At the end, Boles≈Çaw I took control of the country and expelled his stepmother and half- brothers from Poland to Germany. Lambert's further fate is unknown; previously he was identified with Lambert, Bishop of Krak√≥w (d. 1030), but now this identification is contested.K.

In 1032, a certain Dytryk (son of either Lambert or his brother Mieszko) returned to Poland and took control of part of the country after the fall of Mieszko II Lambert, but his reign was short-lived; in 1033, he was deposed and expelled by Mieszko II, who reunited all Poland.

Burger Bundles was the first iteration, a set of three small hamburgers or cheeseburgers. These sandwiches were eventually replaced with a reformulated product called Burger Buddies that was sold in pairs. After a change in management in 2004, Burger Buddies were re- released as BK Burger Shots. The company has also sold several chicken and breakfast sandwich versions of these products. During the periods these products were sold, they were often the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major products in the company's portfolio, Burger King had registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the products, most of which have since lapsed.  History  In 1987, Burger King offered a set of miniature burgers called Burger Bundles. The Burger Bundles were sold in a set of three or six, much like White Castle or Krystal burgers, but served in a single package. At the time of introduction, sales of the sandwich greatly exceeded industry expectations, drawing in the pre-teen and teen demographics in large numbers. A problem with the silver dollar sized patties used at the time was that they were too small for the company's automated broiler's chain and would fall through. The company discontinued the Burger Bundles in late 1987. The sandwich was reintroduced in a slightly different format called Burger Buddies. Instead of three or six miniature hamburger patties, it had a single number eight shaped patty that was served on a pair of co-joined buns. The sandwich was sold for 99¬¢ and was designed to be torn into two smaller sandwiches. There was a breakfast version of the Burger Buddies called the Breakfast Buddies that had eggs, cheese and a sausage patty, again for 99¬¢. Breakfast menus at the time also began selling mini hash-browns, which resemble Tater Tots. Another variant of the Burger Bundles was introduced later in 1987 in chicken sandwich form called Chicken Bundles, Burger king later releases Impossible Slider.https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/09/30/can-a-burger-help-solve- climate-change  Product description  BK Burger Shots consisted of a figure-8 shaped burger with mustard, ketchup and pickles on a pair of co- joined buns without sesame seeds. They were sold in two- or six-piece packs.  Variants  * BK Breakfast Shots have an egg, a cheese sauce, American cheese and a choice of ham, bacon or a sausage patty served on the same style co-joined bun, and are sold in two- or four-piece packs. Again, these were based on the Breakfast variant of the Burger Buddies, the Breakfast Buddies. The original did not have the cheese sauce. * Angus mini-burgers are the British version, sold only as a kids meal and made with ketchup as the only topping.

He attended Redemptorist College in New Orleans, before he enlisted in the U.S. Navy on 17 June 1935. After completing boot camp, Reid reported on board the aircraft carrier USS Lexington (CV-2) on 28 November 1935, and remained in that ship for over two years. Reporting to Naval Air Station Pensacola at Pensacola, Florida, on 25 March 1938 for flight training as a naval aviation pilot (NAP), he received his wings on 29 March 1939. After service with Torpedo Squadron 3, in aircraft carrier USS Saratoga (CV-3), Reid was transferred to Naval Air Station Pearl Harbor at Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, on 12 August 1941. He was serving there when Japanese planes raided Oahu on 7 December 1941. Transferred to Fighting Squadron 2 aboard Lexington on 27 December 1941, Aviation Machinist's Mate Second Class Reid was aboard that ship as she patrolled southwest of Oahu between 29 December 1941 and 16 January 1942.

On 18 April 1942, the day of the Doolittle Raid, Reid flew with Enterprises third combat air patrol of the day when lookouts spotted two Japanese guard boats. He and the other seven pilots of the combat air patrol then strafed the enemy vessels, sinking one and forcing the other, Nagato Maru, to surrender. Having been warranted as a machinist on 23 April 1942, Reid was designated a naval aviator on 5 May 1942. During the Battle of Midway, he flew three combat air patrol missions on 4 June 1942, including one during which his section was vectored over to defend the crippled aircraft carrier USS Yorktown (CV-5). He carried out aggressive attacks on two Japanese torpedo planes and was credited with two confirmed ‚Äúkills.‚Äù He also took part in strafing the Japanese destroyers Asashio and Arashio as they assisted the crippled heavy cruisers Mogami and Mikuma on 6 June 1942. Reid, commissioned an ensign on 23 July 1942, took part in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons on 24 August 1942. He flew one of the 27 Fighting Squadron 6 fighters scrambled for the combat air patrol over Task Force 17, and, as one of two pilots listed as missing in action, was probably shot down by a Mitsubishi A6M ‚ÄúZero‚Äù fighter in the ensuing action.

Hip-hop theater is a form of theater that presents contemporary stories through the use of one or more of the four elements of hip-hop culture‚Äîb-boying, graffiti writing, MCing (rapping), and DJing. Other cultural markers of hip-hop such as spoken word, beatboxing, and hip-hop dance can be included as well although they are not always present. What is most important is the language of the theatrical piece and the plot's relevance to the world. Danny Hoch, founder of the Hip-Hop Theater Festival, further defines it as such: \\"Hip-hop theatre must fit into the realm of theatrical performance, and it must be by, about and for the hip-hop generation, participants in hip-hop culture, or both.\\" Hip-hop theater productions appear in a wide range of platforms including single performances, week-long festivals, and traveling repertory companies. Board Chair Of the historic Philadelphia Freedom Theater and producing Director Of The Devon Theater Of Mayfair Karl Dice Raw Jenkins is the leader in hiphop theater with multiple of Grammy nominations as a singer producer and Playwright, The Last Jimmy[The k√ºmmel, Freedom Theater,Adrienne Arsht & La Grand performances have all presented Karl. Karl's other works include Box A Hiphop Musical telling the life of enslaved African American Henry Box Brown. The King Of Love and more. Marc Bamuthi Joseph is a spoken word poet and dancer who has been commissioned several times to create and direct single hip-hop theater works. British choreographer Jonzi D is the artistic director of the London-based Breakin' Convention, a week long hip-hop theater festival. Rennie Harris, Mourad Merzouki, Kwesi Johnson and Victor Quijada are artistic directors who run hip- hop theater companies in the U.S., France, UK and Canada respectively. The Rock Steady Crew, Magnificent Force, and the Rhythm Technicians pioneered this theatrical genre which started in the United States. History Though hip- hop culture has managed to establish itself on film, on television, in fashion, in music, and in the dance industry, it has not gained the same momentum in theater. Stage productions are few in number but growing. The first hip-hop stage shows were 1990's off Broadway musical So! What Happens Now? , 1994 Kwesi Johnson's 'Searching for a Shamen' 1995's Jam on the Groove which were co-authored, co-directed, and co-choreographed by Jorge \\"Popmaster Fabel\\" Pabon and Steffan \\"Mr. Wiggles\\" Clemente. Rock Steady Crew, Magnificent Force, and the Rhythm Technicians performed in both shows. Aside from the pioneers in New York City was Lorenzo \\"Rennie\\" Harris' Puremovement (RHPM) hip-hop theater company which Harris founded in 1992 in Philadelphia. The company has toured all over the world showcasing its original works such as March of the Antmen, P-Funk, Endangered Species, Facing Mekka, and Rome & Jewels. RHPM also organizes the annual Illadelph Legends Festival which brings together the pioneers‚Äîthe people who were b-boying, locking, and popping in the 1970s when these styles were developed‚Äîand respected practitioners of hip- hop dance to teach master classes, give lecture demonstrations, and participate in panel discussions. Rent incorporated hip hop music influences. This picture shows the Broadway cast from 2005. Hip hop music continues to influence musical theater. Rap is used popular musicals such as Rent and Dreamgirls While more notable for funk than hip hop, the Broadway musical Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk fuses tap dance and hip hop dance styles, and includes rap. Hip hop music was used in Off Broadway shows in the 1990s and early 2000s, with the musicals So! What Happens Now? and Jam on the Groove. In the Heights used hip hop music, rapping and hip hop dancing. With music and lyrics by Lin Manuel Miranda and book by Quiara Alegr√≠a Hudes, it was performed off Broadway in 2007. The 2008 Broadway production fused salsa and hip hop styles, and included rap. Miranda brought hip hop to Richard Rodgers Theater a second time in 2015 with his production Hamilton. The show had box office success. Hamilton and In the Heights included rap and the cast recording of Hamilton made a number one album on the Billboard rap charts. The success of Hamilton shows that hip hop can have a key role in musical theater. Repertory companies Other hip-hop theater companies were founded in the 1990s. Compagnie K√§fig is a French hip-hop theater company of mostly Algerian descent founded in 1995 by Mourad Merzouki. Their performances mix standard b-boying, locking, and popping with capoeira, mime, and gymnastics. They use the same fusion in music by mixing rap music with classical music and Andalusian guitar. While on tour in the U.S. they performed at Jacob's Pillow in Massachusetts and at the Joyce Theater in New York. Bintou Demb√©l√© performed at the Joyce Theater in New York with Mourad Merzouki's Compagnie K√§fig in 2002. That same year she created her own dance company, which she describes as being mainly inspired by Pina Bausch's notion of 'danced theater'. The Groovaloos are a hip-hop theater company based in Los Angeles that was founded by Bradley \\"Shooz\\" Rapier. They started out in 1999 as a dance crew and eventually developed a stage show called Groovaloo that is a series of stories based on the true life experiences of the dancers. Company members include Edmundo \\"Poe One\\" Loayza, Rynan \\"Kid Rainen\\" Paguio from JabbaWockeeZ, and Teresa \\"Rag Doll\\" Espinosa from Beat Freaks. RUBBERBANDance Group (RBDG) was founded in 2002 in Montreal by Los Angeles native Victor Quijada. Quijada first started dancing as a b-boy in Baldwin Park, California. He studied modern dance in high school and after graduating went on to become a professional dancer under Twyla Tharp and Les Grands Ballets Canadiens de Montr√©al. He started RBDG after leaving the Montreal ballet. The New York Times called the style of dance his company performs \\"post hip-hop\\" because it's a fusion of hip-hop dance and ballet. Independent performances Marc Bamuthi Joseph is a spoken word poet and playwright who frequently directs independent hip-hop theater productions. Some of his works include Word Becomes Flesh, De/Cipher, and No Man's Land. He collaborated with Rennie Harris in 2007 to create Scourge, a play about Haiti's social-economic struggles. Joseph directed the play while Harris served as the choreographer. In 2008, he created the break/s which is based on the book Can't Stop Won't Stop by Jeff Chang. Other solo hip-hop theater artists include Sarah Jones who headlined the first Hip-Hop Theater Festival and award-winning playwright Will \\"Power\\" Wylie who collaborated with Danny Hock on his one-man play Flow. Also, West Coast feminist writer/performer Aya de Leon whose award-winning show \\"Thieves in the Temple: The Reclaiming of Hip Hop\\" focused on fighting sexism and consumerism in hip hop.

In the laboratory, nitroform can also be produced by hydrolysis of tetranitromethane under mild basic conditions. Acidity Trinitromethane as a neutral molecule is colorless. It is highly acidic, easily forming an intensely yellow anion, (NO2)3C‚àí. The pKa of trinitromethane has been measured at 0.17 ¬± 0.02 at 20 ¬∞C, which is remarkably acidic for a methane derivative. Trinitromethane easily dissolves in water to form an acidic yellow solution. There is some evidence that the anion, which obeys the 4n+2 H√ºckel rule, is aromatic. Nitroform salts Trinitromethane forms a series of bright yellow ionic salts. Many of these salts tend to be unstable and can be easily detonated by heat or impact. The potassium salt of nitroform, KC(NO2)3 is a lemon yellow crystalline solid that decomposes slowly at room temperatures and explodes above 95 ¬∞C. The ammonium salt is somewhat more stable, and deflagrates or explodes above 200 ¬∞C. The hydrazine salt, hydrazinium nitroformate is thermally stable to above 125 ¬∞C and is being investigated as an ecologically friendly oxidizer for use in solid fuels for rockets.

The Society seeks to enhance the quality of rural life, communities, and the environment. It was officially established on December 29, 1937Holik, John S. and Edward W. Hassinger. 1986a. ‚ÄúThe Rural Sociological Society: Its Beginnings.‚Äù The Rural Sociologist. 6(5):331-340. in order to promote the development of rural sociology through teaching, research and extension. Membership in the RSS includes persons professionally employed in the field of rural sociology, or those interested in the objectives of the Society. RSS holds annual meetings in different locations every year.  What We Do  The core activities of the Rural Sociological Society are our peer- reviewed journal, Rural Sociology, our annual conference, and support for communities of scholars concerned with specific rural topics. Through these activities, the RSS has provided leadership in scholarship, policies, and advocacy. Since its founding in 1937, the RSS has traced changes in rural life and livelihoods, demography, community structures and economies, technologies, environmental conditions, and agriculture and food systems.  History  Before the RSS, those interested in the discipline met as the Rural Sociology Section of the American Sociological Society, which later became the American Sociological Association. The meeting at which the formation of the RSS was approved had not started with that in mind. Rather, a committee of section members appointed previously presented a report that supported continued association with the parent organization, although one of the five members submitted a minority report calling for separation. After substantial discussion, a vote to establish a separate organization carried. That same day, a provisional constitution and by-laws were established by the founding RSS members; they still guide activities, although both have been amended through the years as membership and issues have changed.Holik, John S. and Edward W. Hassinger. 1986b. ‚ÄúThe RSS: Coming to Formalization.‚Äù The Rural Sociologist. 6(6):407-420. The decision to form the Rural Sociological Society in 1937 was not totally unexpected. Discussion of sponsoring an organization of rural sociologists occurred in the 1920s and was widespread in the mid-1930s. Indeed, concerns with opportunities to bring topics related to rural issues before larger audiences led to the publication of the first volume of the quarterly journal, Rural Sociology, in 1936. This had come about only because of the support of members of the Rural Sociology Section, both in terms of financing and editing; issues in the first two volumes had \\"Published by the Rural Sociology Section [of the] American Sociological Society\\" on the covers. That changed in 1938, when Rural Sociology became the official journal of the RSS; it has been published continuously since.

He is in particular associated with the golden age of the Balinese kingdom of Gelgel, with political expansion and cultural and religious renovation. In Balinese historiography he represented an epic vision of kingship that served as a model for later rulers on the island.Adrian Vickers, Bali, A Paradise Created. Singapore: Periplus 1989, pp. 41-45. Prosperous reign Dalem Baturenggong is solely known from much later sources. He is briefly listed as king in the religious texts Usana Bali and Rajapurana Besakih, under the name Enggong.David Stuart-Fox, Pura Besakih; A Study of Balinese Religion and Society. PhD Thesis, ANU, Canberra 1987, p. 146-148. Full details are found in the 18th-century chronicle Babad Dalem. According to this text he was the son of Dalem Ketut, the first King of Gelgel, who reigned around the fall of the Javanese Majapahit empire (early 16th century). He posed as an opponent of Islam and an enemy of Pasuruan and Mataram on Java. His prestige was greatly enhanced by the arrival of the Brahmin Nirartha from Java, who established an ideal relationship between priest and patron and carried out an extensive literary activity. Nirartha is dated in 1537 from one of his texts, which date would then be an approximate floruit of Dalem Baturenggong's reign.Adrian Vickers, Bali, A Paradise Created. Singapore: Periplus 1989, pp. 41-42, 49-50, 218. Military expansion The king proposed to marry the daughter of Sri Juru, the King of Blambangan in East Java, but the princess refused. A Balinese army was therefore sent to Blambangan, where it trapped and killed Sri Juru. The children of the slain king fled to Pasuruan on Java's north coast, and Blambangan was brought under Balinese suzerainty. Furthermore, Lombok and West Sumbawa were brought under the authority of Dalem Baturenggong. The king left two sons, Dalem Bekung and Dalem Seganing, who reigned in turn after his death.C.C. Berg, De middeljavaansche historische traditi√´. Santpoort: Mees 1927, pp. 138-44. The details of his glorious reign can not be verified from contemporary sources. Only the Portuguese writer Fern√£o Mendes Pinto (c. 1509-1583), in his work Peregrinacam, alleges that Bali was a pagan island dependent on the Javanese Muslim Demak kingdom but rebelled in c. 1546.Fern√£o Mendes Pinto, The Travels of Mendes Pinto. Chicago & London: The University of Chicago Press 1989, p. 392. This information may not be quite trustworthy. However, European sources from the late 16th and 17th centuries describe the Gelgel kingdom in terms reminiscent of the chronicles, and seem to presuppose a strong political expansion between the fall of Majapahit (c. 1527) and the first Dutch visit to Bali (1597).

In 1877, after the Dull Knife Fight, when Crazy Horse surrendered at Fort Robinson a few Cheyenne chiefs and their people surrendered as well. The Cheyenne chiefs that surrendered at the fort were Dull Knife, Little Wolf, Standing Elk, and Wild Hog with nearly one thousand Cheyenne. On the other hand, Two Moon surrendered at Fort Keogh with three hundred Cheyenne in 1877. The Cheyenne wanted and expected to live on the reservation with the Sioux in accordance with an April 29, 1868 treaty of Fort Laramie of which both Dull Knife and Little Wolf had signed.Brown, Dee (1970). Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, pp.332-349. Holt, Rinehart and Winston. . However shortly after arriving at Fort Robinson it was recommended that the Northern Cheyenne be moved to the reservation at Fort Reno with the Southern Cheyenne. Confinement in the South Following confirmation from Washington the Cheyenne started their move with 972 people; upon reaching the Cheyenne-Arapaho reservation on August 5, 1877 there were only 937.Bourke, John G. (1966). Mackenzies Last fight with the Cheyennes, .New York Arogonaut Press. Some elderly had perished along the way and some young men crept away and headed back north. When reaching the reservation the Northern Cheyenne noticed how poverty-stricken the reservation was and began to fall sick in the late summer of 1877. However, when conditions did not improve upon a federal investigation into reservation conditions the Cheyenne were given authorization to hunt.US Congress (1860-1891). Senate Report 708, p.153,266,269. 46th, 2nd Session. When the Cheyenne attempted to find game to hunt none was found, just a wasteland of dead buffalo remains (The US Army sanctioned and actively endorsed the wholesale slaughter of bison herds.Hanson, Emma I. Memory and Vision: Arts, Cultures, and Lives of Plains Indian People. Cody, WY: Buffalo Bill Historical Center, 2007: 211. The federal government promoted bison hunting for various reasons, to allow ranchers to range their cattle without competition from other bovines, and primarily to weaken the North American Indian population by removing their main food source and to pressure them onto the Indian reservations during times of conflict. PDF: history.msu.edu ); this was the winter of 1877-1878. Unfortunately in 1878 there was a measles outbreak that struck the Northern Cheyenne, and in August 1878 the Cheyenne chiefs began the organization to move north. On September 9, 1878 Little Wolf, Dull Knife, Wild Hog, and Left Hand told their people to organize to leave. Leaving were 297 (the number could be as high as 353) men, women, and children. Escape to the North In the early morning of September 10 the band fled up the North Canadian River. By 3 AM the alarm was sounded that the Cheyenne were gone. Passing the present sites of Watonga, Oklahoma and Canton, Oklahoma they crossed north over the watershed into the Cimarron Basin, crossing the Cimarron River the evening of September 10. There, near the present site of Freedom, Oklahoma they rested then trailed 11 miles up Turkey Creek to Turkey Springs. After a few hours rest there Dull Knife and a few others led the women and children on to St. Jacob's Well and The Big Basin in what is now Clark County, Kansas where they camped.Pages 20 to 22, Maddux, In Dull Knife's Wake Fight at Turkey Creek The Cheyenne, anticipating pursuit, prepared an ambush at Turkey Springs.Page 22, Maddux, In Dull Knife's Wake While one band prepared rifle pits at the springs, other bands fanned out over the country looking for supplies. In one case, attacking and killing two cowboys, they obtained two mules. In another, attacking some cowboys during breakfast, they obtained both some food and a Sharps carbine.Pages 27, 31 to 33, Maddux, In Dull Knife's Wake Battle Canyon, site of Battle of Punished Woman's Fork Battle of Punished Woman's Fork After crossing the Arkansas River the Cheyenne were followed closely by a mixed command of 238 soldiers of the 19th Infantry and 4th Cavalry under Lieutenant Colonel William H. Lewis of the 19th Infantry. On September 27, the Cheyenne prepared an ambush in a canyon on Punished Woman's Fork (north of present-day Scott City, Kansas), but it was aborted due to an over-eager brave who fired on the scouts before the ambush was sprung. Lewis deployed a company of infantry to block the entrance to the canyon and attacked late in the afternoon along the rim of the canyon with four troops of dismounted cavalry, advancing by bounds, pinning the Cheyenne including their families in the closed end below. However Lewis was unaware of the Cheyenne's marksmanship and was shot in the leg, severing his femoral artery. This left a vacuum in Cavalry Regiment's leadership which the Cheyenne were able to exploit, escaping after dark. Lewis bled to death the next day and several other soldiers were wounded. However, the Cheyenne lost 60 horses, much baggage, and all of their food when part of the pony herd was discovered by the troopers.Maddux (2003), pp. 88-92 Depredations in Kansas A party of drovers encountered Cheyenne camped on Prairie Dog Creek, in northwestern Kansas on September 29 and lost 80 cattle. Between September 30 and October 3, 1878, in northwestern Kansas in present-day Decatur County, Kansas and Rawlins County, Kansas near Oberlin, Kansas, then a tiny hamlet, small parties of Cheyenne foraging for horses, cattle, and supplies fell on isolated settlers who had recently homesteaded along Sappa and Beaver Creeks, some of whom, recent immigrants from eastern Europe, had never seen an Indian. Men and boys were killed; women and older girls raped. Often the settlers were approached in a friendly manner, then shot point blank. About 41 white men and boys were killed and, as per the Kansas senate, 25 white women and girls raped, the latter number seeming inflated given existing evidence. Some observers link the actions of the Cheyenne with the Battle of Cheyenne Hole, an action in the spring of 1875 in the same area when a small village of Cheyenne was surprised and destroyed by Army troops.Pages 177 to 191, Boye, Holding Stone Hands Other observers stress that this version has no basis in Cheyenne accounts and trace the depredation back to the fact that the fleeing Cheyennes had lost most of their ponies and all of their food in the Battle of Punished Woman's Fork which created a crisis among the tribespeople.Pages 78 to 103, Monnett, Tell Them We Are Going Home. Also, elderly or injured Cheyennes who could no longer keep up with the pace of their fleeing people and remained behind were mercilessly shot or clubbed to death by white posses. On to Nebraska From Turkey Creek on it was a running battle across Kansas and Nebraska, and soldiers from all surrounding forts (Fort Wallace, Fort Hays, Fort Dodge, Fort Riley, and Fort Kearney) were in pursuit of the Cheyenne. About ten thousand soldiers and three thousand settlers chased the Cheyenne both day and night.Wright, Peter M. (1968). The Pursuit of Dull Knife from Fort Reno in 1878-1879, pp141-154. Chronicles of Oklahoma, Volume 46. During the last two weeks of September the army had caught up to the Cheyenne five times but the Cheyenne were able to evade the army by keeping to arduous grounds where it was challenging for the army to follow.Stump Horn and family (Northern Cheyenne); showing home and horsedrawn travois. Division In the fall of 1878 after six weeks of running the Cheyenne chiefs held council and it was discovered that 34 of the original 297 were missing, most had been killed but a few had decided to take other paths to the north. This is where the Cheyenne split into two groups. The ones that wished to stop running were going along with Dull Knife to Red Cloud Agency, Wild Hog and Left Hand also decided to follow Dull Knife. Little Wolf continued north intending to go to the Powder River country. Dull Knife's band On October 23, 1878, Dull Knife's band of Cheyenne, only two days from Fort Robinson, were surrounded by the Army. After hearing that Red Cloud and Spotted Tail had been relocated to Pine Ridge, Dull Knife decided, due to weather and his people's condition, to go to Fort Robinson. That night the Cheyenne took apart their best guns with the women hiding the barrels under their clothing, and attaching the smaller pieces to clothes and moccasins as ornaments. On October 25, 1878, Dull Knife, Left Hand, Wild Hog and the rest of the Cheyenne finally reached Fort Robinson. The barracks that had been built to house seventy-five soldiers now held one hundred and fifty Cheyenne. In December, Red Cloud was brought to Fort Robinson for a council with Dull Knife and the other chiefs. Dull Knife agreed to fight no more if the great father in Washington would let his people live on Pine Ridge that now held Red Cloud and his tribe. However, on January 3, 1879, the Cheyenne were ordered to return south to the Southern Cheyenne reservation. When the Cheyenne refused, bars were put on windows and no rations were given, including wood for heat. Porcupine, and Blacksmith. All prisoners were released free from charges. Some were sent back to Oklahoma On January 9, 1879, Dull Knife still refused to return south. However, Wild Hog and Left Hand agreed to talk but said their people would not go. As a result Wild Hog was held as a prisoner and shackled. At 9:45 that night the Cheyenne tried to make a daring escape using the dismantled guns they had hidden upon arriving at the fort. The Cheyenne were immediately followed and many were killed in the Fort Robinson massacre. By morning 65 Cheyenne, 23 of them wounded, were returned to Fort Robinson as prisoners. Only 38 Cheyenne escaped and remained alive, 32 of whom were together moving north pursued by the Army. Six Cheyenne were hiding only a few miles from the fort among rocks and were found during the next few days. At the Hat Creek Bluffs, 32 Cheyenne led by Little Finger Nail were trapped, and after the final battle at the pit, only nine were left alive.Lackie, William H. (1941). Liquidation of Dull Knife, pp.109-110. Nebraska History, Vol. 22. After the final battle at \\"The Pit\\". Painting by Frederic Remington, 1897 In January 1879, Dull Knife reached Pine Ridge where Red Cloud was being held as a prisoner. After months of delay from Washington the prisoners from Fort Robinson were released and allowed to go to Fort Keogh where Little Wolf had ended up. However, several of the escapees later had to stand trial for the murders that had been committed in Kansas. In 1994, the remains of those killed were repatriated. Little Wolf's band After the council near the North Platte where the Northern Cheyenne split up, Little Wolf's band continued north to the Sand Hills of Nebraska where they wintered along Wild Chokecherry Creek where there was plentiful deer, antelope and cattle. They saw a few white men during the winter but were undisturbed. In early spring they moved north to the Powder River.

The Zinfandel vineyard is located just below the Pinot noir section. The vineyard is considered Region II on the Winkler scale, with maritime influences. The soil type is predominantly Josephine loam. In 2006, Benovia completed extensive pruning of the vineyard and has since become a CCOF Certified Organic vineyard. Martaella Estate Vineyards Martaella Estate borders Benovia Winery's winemaking facilities in the Russian River Valley AVA, specifically within an area known as the Laguna de Santa Rosa. Martaella experiences heavy maritime influences with frequent early morning fog throughout the growing season. Daytime temperatures rarely rise above , while nights often dip into the low 50s ¬∞F (low 10s ¬∞C). The property currently grows of grape vines in various stages of development. Pinot noir grapes ripening in Martaella Vineyards When first purchased, Martaella was planted with of Pommard clone Pinot noir. Benovia introduced more clonal diversity by replanting of the original vineyard with Calera and Dijon 828 clones of Pinot noir, with the new vines planted at a higher density using spacing, or about 2,700 vines per acre (6,700/ha). The acquisition of a former apple orchard and horse ranch just north of the winery in 2009 allowed Benovia to plant an additional of vines. To encourage soil uniformity, the winery installed a network of subsoil drains in 2008.

Grower Partner Vineyards Benovia sources additional grapes to supplement its estate-grown fruit from Sonoma County's Martinelli family. Martinelli Vineyards The Martinelli WineryMartinelli Winery Website has grown fruit in Sonoma County since 1896. The Martinelli vineyards are farmed by Lee Martinelli, Sr., and his sons Lee, Jr. and George. Benovia Winery's La Pommeraie Chardonnay and La Pommeraie Pinot noir are produced from the Zio Tony Ranch, a Russian River Valley AVA vineyard farmed by George Martinelli located on Frei Road near the town of Graton, California. The vineyard experiences very cool temperatures with many foggy mornings. Benovia Winery's Three Sisters Chardonnay is produced with grapes from the Martinelli's Three Sisters Vineyard located in the Sonoma Coast AVA on the 3rd ridge in from the Pacific Ocean. Winemaking The process of creating Benovia‚Äôs Pinot noir wines begins with handpicking the fruit during harvest.Magel, Nikitas. \\"budbreak of a brand\\", Vinterviews.com Workers clip the grapes from the vines in bunches, collect the grape clusters in bins, and transport the fruit to a sorting table. Each cluster is inspected by hand at the sorting table prior to the automated destemming process which separates the berries from the stems. A second sorting area following destemming allows workers to inspect the individual berries and discard unsuitable fruit. The grapes are then transferred to small, open-top fermentors as gently as possible to minimize fruit damage. After a pre-fermentation maceration of five to eight days, the indigenous yeast encourages the longer process of malolactic fermentation. The wines then spend 14 to 16 months aging in French oak barrels before being transferred to the bottling line at Benovia. The winery's Chardonnay grapes follow a similar process. After hand-sorting, the whole clusters are transferred directly to the wine press. Whole cluster pressing helps minimize the amount of malic acid and tannins that naturally exist in the skins, seeds and stems from entering the wine. After settling, the resulting juice (called ‚Äúmust‚Äù) is moved to French oak barrels to ferment at a cool temperature for approximately four to six weeks. The barrels are inoculated for malolactic fermentation, and the lees are stirred weekly until the process is complete. This method helps the malolactic fermentation, integrates the new oak, and builds body and structure in the wine.

It was established in the latter half of the 8th century, and survived until the late 11th century. Along with the Noumeroi regiment, the Vigla formed the guard of the imperial palace in Constantinople, and was responsible for the Byzantine emperor's safety on expeditions. History and functions The Vigla or Arithmos was the third of the imperial tagmata to be established, with its commander attested for the first time in 791.. Both names derive from the Latin terminology of the Late Roman army: the term vigilia was applied from the 4th century onto any kind of guard detachment, while arithmos is the Greek translation of the Latin numerus, both titles being used in a generic sense for \\"regiment\\". In literary sources, Vigla is more commonly used than Arithmos, and is also the title used in the seals of its commanders. The Empress Irene of Athens (), held according to one theory to have created the tagma of the Vigla. Its exact date of creation is contested among modern historians of the Byzantine army: Byzantinist John Haldon considers that the Vigla was established as a tagma by the Empress Irene in the 780s out of a provincial brigade, but Warren Treadgold supports its creation along with the first two tagmata, the Scholai (\\"Schools\\") and Exkoubitoi (\\"Excubitors\\"), by Emperor Constantine V () in the mid-8th century. If the former hypothesis is true, then the establishment of the Vigla by Irene may have been intended to counterbalance the two older tagmata, which remained loyal to iconoclasm and resented Irene's iconophile policies. The provincial parent unit, in turn, appears to have been of considerable ancestry: the presence of archaic Late Roman titles for its officers points to an origin, possibly as a cavalry vexillation, in the old East Roman army before the Muslim conquests of the 7th century. John B. Bury has traced a hypothetical lineage to the early 5th- century vexillationes palatinae of the Comites Arcadiaci, the Comites Honoriaci and the Equites Theodosiaci. As the name indicates, the Vigla was tasked with guard duties, both in the imperial palace and on campaign. Unlike the other cavalry tagmata, which were mostly garrisoned outside Constantinople in Thrace and Bithynia, the Vigla had a significant presence in the capital. There, its task was guarding the imperial palace, along with the less prestigious infantry tagmata of the Noumeroi (responsible also for the palace prisons) and the Teichei≈çtai (guarding the city walls). More specifically, within Constantinople, the Vigla guarded the most exposed western, city-ward perimeter of the palace precinct, and kept a permanent garrison at the Covered Hippodrome, which was left in place even when the rest of the unit was on campaign, and secured the safety of the emperor while he was outside the Palace. As the regimental commander, the droungarios tƒìs viglas () was always in attendance to the emperor, the Vigla could go on campaign without him, in which case it came under the orders of the Domestic of the Schools. On expeditions led by the emperor himself, the droungarios was responsible for the safety of the camp and especially the night watch, relaying the emperor's orders, the advance, rear and flank guards during marches, and guarding prisoners of war. In comparison to the other three \\"classical\\" tagmata of the Scholai, Exkoubitoi, and Hikanatoi, the Vigla is mentioned infrequently in the historical sources of the 9th‚Äì10th centuries. This is possibly due to the peculiar duties and role of the regiment on campaign, as it was responsible for the internal security of the imperial camp, rather than a battle-line formation; the regiment may also have been numerically much smaller than the other tagmata. Members of the unit are recorded as participating in a campaign to southern Italy in 935 and in the Cretan expedition of 949, but the sources are silent about its subsequent history and eventual disbandment. Organisation As with the other tagmata, the issue of the unit's size is a matter of controversy. Warren Treadgold considers the tagmata to have numbered a standard 4,000 men each, while other scholars, notably John Haldon, argue in favour of a much lower size of men. The structure of the imperial tagmata, however, was uniform and is well-attested, with minor variations, mostly in titelature, reflecting the different origins of the units. Uniquely among the tagmata, and perhaps a reflection of its ancestry, since it was more common in the 6th century, the commander of the Vigla bore the title of droungarios, in English sometimes rendered as \\"Drungary of the Watch\\". The first known holder of the office was Alexios Mosele in 791. Due to his proximity to the emperor, the droungarios was usually a close and trusted aide, as well as one of the senior military officers of the state. In the 10th century, the office was given to some of the most distinguished scions of the Byzantine military aristocracy, but from circa 1030 on, it was transformed into a civil office with judicial responsibilities. In this capacity, it survived well beyond the regiment's demise and unto the end of the Palaiologan period. Under the droungarios were one or two topotƒìrƒìtai (sing. topotƒìrƒìtƒìs, œÑŒøœÄŒøœÑŒ∑œÅŒ∑œÑŒÆœÇ, lit. \\"placeholder, lieutenant\\"), a chartoularios () as head of the commander's secretariat, and the akolouthos, a title unique to the Vigla but corresponding to similar subaltern officers, the proximos of the Scholai and the pr≈çtomandat≈çr of the Exkoubitoi.; ; . The unit was divided into twenty banda (sing. bandon, Œ≤Œ¨ŒΩŒ¥ŒøŒΩ, from , \\"banner\\"), each of theoretically 50 men, commanded by a komƒìs (, \\"count [of the arithmos]\\"). In turn, each of these commanded five kentarchoi (sing. kentarchos, Œ∫Œ≠ŒΩœÑŒ±œÅœáŒøœÇ, \\"centurion\\"). Among the lower ranks within each tagma were two further classes of subaltern officers, the bandophoroi (Œ≤Œ±ŒΩŒ¥ŒøœÜœåœÅŒøŒπ, \\"banner-bearers\\") and the mandatores (ŒºŒ±ŒΩŒ¥Œ¨œÑŒøœÅŒµœÇ, \\"messengers\\"). Each tagma numbered forty of the bandophoroi, divided into four different classes of ten, with differing titles in each unit. For the Vigla in particular, these titles can be traced to the standard Roman cavalry ranks of the 5th‚Äì6th centuries. These were: the bandophoroi, the labourisioi (ŒªŒ±Œ≤ŒøœÖœÅŒØœÉŒπŒøŒπ, a corruption of 6th-century labarƒìsioi, \\"carriers of the labarum\\"), the sƒìmeiophoroi (œÉŒ∑ŒºŒµŒπŒøœÜœåœÅŒøŒπ, \\"bearers of an insigne\\", cf. the Late Roman semafori), and the doukiniatores (Œ¥ŒøœÖŒ∫ŒπŒΩŒπŒ¨œÑŒøœÅŒµœÇ, again a corruption of the Latin ducenarii of the Late Roman military). The Vigla also was unique in having several ranks of messengers: along with the ordinary mandatores present in the other units, it included legatarioi (ŒªŒµŒ≥Œ±œÑŒ¨œÅŒπŒøŒπ, \\"legatees\\"), thyr≈çroi (Œ∏œÖœÅœâœÅŒøŒØ, \\"doorkeepers\\"), skoutarioi (œÉŒ∫ŒøœÖœÑŒ¨œÅŒπŒøŒπ, \\"shield-bearers\\") and diatrechontes (Œ¥ŒπŒ±œÑœÅŒ≠œáŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ, \\"runners\\"). Only a handful of subaltern officers of the Vigla are known, from their lead seals of office.

With an area of approximately , the population of Sarilhos Pequenos was 1150 in 2011 (census data). Coat of Arms History Sarilhos Pequenos has been known historically as land of fishermen and fish-salters; until the 1960s-1970s, and for decades beforehand, 90% of its population was supported by the fishery from the ravines and rivers of the region. Its name is derived from the conversion process used in transforming the saltwater into salt, using a wooden device or sarilho that would permit the entry of water into the salt-flats. The water would be contained in compartments protected by one metre (3.3 ft) walls (or margateiras), where evaporation would take place, and finally salt could be collected. Unlike the process encountered in Sarilhos Grandes, the people of this parish used smaller devices, thereby achieving their fame and the toponymy for the area. Although this work disappeared with modern techniques, much of this cultures legacy has remained in the brightly painted small residences and the fishing nets, now used to stop insects. Further, the dockyard also preserves the historical connection the parish has with the water, with the construction and repair of the typical Tagus fishing boats.

Following the Fukushima I nuclear accidents, the International Energy Agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity built by 2035. The World Nuclear Association has reported that ‚Äúnuclear power generation suffered its biggest ever one-year fall through 2012 as the bulk of the Japanese fleet remained offline for a full calendar year‚Äù. Data from the International Atomic Energy Agency showed that nuclear power plants globally produced 2346 TWh of electricity in 2012 ‚Äì seven per cent less than in 2011. The figures illustrate the effects of a full year of 48 Japanese power reactors producing no power during the year. The permanent closure of eight reactor units in Germany was also a factor. Problems at Crystal River, Fort Calhoun and the two San Onofre units in the USA meant they produced no power for the full year, while in Belgium Doel 3 and Tihange 2 were out of action for six months. Compared to 2010, the nuclear industry produced 11% less electricity in 2012. As of July 2013, \\"a total of 437 nuclear reactors were operating in 30 countries, seven fewer than the historical maximum of 444 in 2002. Since 2002, utilities have started up 28 units and disconnected 36 including six units at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan. The 2010 world reactor fleet had a total nominal capacity of about 370 gigawatts (or thousand megawatts). Despite seven fewer units operating in 2013 than in 2002, the capacity is still about 7 gigawatts higher\\". The numbers of new operative reactors, final shutdowns and new initiated constructions according to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 2010 are as follows: Overview A total of 72 reactors were under construction at the beginning of 2014, the highest number in 25 years. Several of the under construction reactors are carry over from earlier eras; some are partially completed reactors on which work has resumed (e.g., in Argentina); some are small and experimental (e.g., Russian floating reactors); and some have been on the IAEA's ‚Äúunder construction‚Äù list for years (e.g., in India and Russia). Reactor projects in Eastern Europe are essentially replacing old Soviet reactors shut down due to safety concerns. Most of the 2010 activity ‚Äï 30 reactors ‚Äï is taking place in four countries: China, India, Russia and South Korea. Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Iran are the only countries that are currently building their first power reactors, Iran's construction began decades ago.Trevor Findlay (2010).

Taking stock of nuclear renaissance that never was Sydney Morning Herald, August 18, 2010. So the expanding nuclear programs in Asia are balanced by retirements of aging plants and nuclear reactor phase-outs. A study by UBS, reported on April 12, 2011, predicts that around 30 nuclear plants may be closed worldwide, with those located in seismic zones or close to national boundaries being the most likely to shut. The analysts believe that 'even pro-nuclear countries such as France will be forced to close at least two reactors to demonstrate political action and restore the public acceptability of nuclear power', noting that the events at Fukushima 'cast doubt on the idea that even an advanced economy can master nuclear safety'.Nucl√©aire : une trentaine de r√©acteurs dans le monde risquent d'√™tre ferm√©s Les √âchos, published April 12, 2011. Retrieved April 15, 2011 In September 2011, German engineering giant Siemens announced it will withdraw entirely from the nuclear industry, as a response to the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan. The 2011 World Energy Outlook report by the International Energy Agency stated that having \\"second thoughts on nuclear would have far-reaching consequences\\" and that a substantial shift away from nuclear power would boost demand for fossil fuels, putting additional upward pressure on the price of energy, raising additional concerns about energy security, and making it more difficult and expensive to combat climate change.International Energy Agency \\"World Energy Outlook 2011\\" , International Energy Agency 2011 The reports suggests that the consequences would be most severe for nations with limited local energy resources and which have been planning to rely heavily on nuclear power for future energy security, and that it would make it substantially more challenging for developing economies to satisfy their rapidly increasing demand for electricity. John Rowe, chair of Exelon (the largest nuclear power producer in the US), has said that the nuclear renaissance is \\"dead\\". He says that solar, wind and cheap natural gas have significantly reduced the prospects of coal and nuclear power plants around the world. Amory Lovins says that the sharp and steady cost reductions in solar power has been a \\"stunning market success\\". In 2013 the analysts at the investment research firm Morningstar, Inc. concluded that nuclear power was not a viable source of new power in the West.

Economics Nuclear power plants are large construction projects with very high up-front costs. The cost of capital is also steep due to the risk of construction delays and obstructing legal action.M.V. Ramana. Nuclear Power: Economic, Safety, Health, and Environmental Issues of Near-Term Technologies, Annual Review of Environment and Resources, 2009. 34, p. 130. The large capital cost of nuclear power has been a key barrier to the construction of new reactors around the world, and the economics have recently worsened, as a result of the global financial crisis.Trevor Findlay (2010). The Future of Nuclear Energy to 2030 and its Implications for Safety, Security and Nonproliferation: Overview , The Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, p. 14.Mark Cooper. The Economics of Nuclear Reactors: Renaissance or Relapse? Vermont Law School, June 2009. As the OECD's Nuclear Energy Agency points out, \\"investors tend to favor less capital intensive and more flexible technologies\\". This has led to a large increase in the use of natural gas for base-load power production, often using more sophisticated combined cycle plants. Accidents and safety Following the 2011 Japanese Fukushima nuclear disaster, authorities shut down the nation's 54 nuclear power plants. As of 2013, the Fukushima site remains highly radioactive, with some 160,000 evacuees still living in temporary housing, and some land will be unfarmable for centuries. The difficult cleanup job will take 40 or more years, and cost tens of billions of dollars. Major nuclear reactor accidents include Three Mile Island accident (1979), Chernobyl disaster (1986), and Fukushima (2011). A report in Lancet says that the effects of these accidents on individuals and societies are diverse and enduring. Relatively few immediate deaths have occurred, but nuclear-related fatalities are mostly in the hazardous uranium mining industry, which supplies fuel to nuclear reactors. There are also physical health problems directly attributable to radiation exposure, as well as psychological and social effects. The Fukushima accident forced more than 80,000 residents to evacuate from neighborhoods around the crippled nuclear plant. Evacuation and long-term displacement create severe health-care problems for the most vulnerable people, such as hospital inpatients and elderly people. Charles Perrow, in his book Normal accidents says that multiple and unexpected failures are built into complex and tightly-coupled systems, such as nuclear power plants. Such accidents often involve operator error and are unavoidable and cannot be designed around. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, there has been heightened concern that nuclear power plants may be targeted by terrorists or criminals, and that nuclear materials may be purloined for use in nuclear or radiological weapons.Trevor Findlay (2010). The Future of Nuclear Energy to 2030 and its Implications for Safety, Security and Nonproliferation: Overview , The Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, p. 26. Nevertheless, newer reactor designs intended to provide increased safety have been developed over time. The next nuclear plants to be built will likely be Generation III or III+ designs, and a few are being built in Japan. However, safety risks may be the greatest when nuclear systems are the newest, and operators have less experience with them. Nuclear engineer David Lochbaum explained that almost all serious nuclear accidents occurred with what was at the time the most recent technology. He argues that \\"the problem with new reactors and accidents is twofold: scenarios arise that are impossible to plan for in simulations; and humans make mistakes\\".Benjamin K. Sovacool.

Public opinion Global public support for energy sources, based on a survey by Ipsos (2011) taken 2 months after the Fukushima Disaster. In 2005, the International Atomic Energy Agency presented the results of a series of public opinion surveys in the Global Public Opinion on Nuclear Issues report. Majorities of respondents in 14 of the 18 countries surveyed believe that the risk of terrorist acts involving radioactive materials at nuclear facilities is high, because of insufficient protection. While majorities of citizens generally support the continued use of existing nuclear power reactors, most people do not favour the building of new nuclear plants, and 25% of respondents feel that all nuclear power plants should be closed down. Stressing the climate change benefits of nuclear energy positively influences 10% of people to be more supportive of expanding the role of nuclear power in the world, but there is still a general reluctance to support the building of more nuclear power plants.International Atomic Energy Agency (2005). Global Public Opinion on Nuclear Issues and the IAEA: Final Report from 18 Countries pp. 6‚Äì7. After the Fukushima Disaster, Civil Society Institute (CSI) found out that 58 percent of the respondents indicated less support of using nuclear power in the United States. Two-thirds of the respondents said they would protest the construction of a nuclear reactor within 50 miles of their homes. There was little support across the world for building new nuclear reactors, a 2011 poll for the BBC indicates. The global research agency GlobeScan, commissioned by BBC News, polled 23,231 people in 23 countries from July to September 2011, several months after the Fukushima nuclear disaster. In countries with existing nuclear programmes, people are significantly more opposed than they were in 2005, with only the UK and US bucking the trend. Most believe that boosting energy efficiency and renewable energy can meet their needs. By region and country Africa As of March 2010, ten African nations had begun exploring plans to build nuclear reactors. South Africa (which has two nuclear power reactors), however, removed government funding for its planned new PBMRs in 2010. America United States George W. Bush signing the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which was designed to promote US nuclear reactor construction, through incentives and subsidies, including cost-overrun support up to a total of $2 billion for six new nuclear plants. Between 2007 and 2009, 13 companies applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for construction and operating licenses to build 30 new nuclear power reactors in the United States. However, the case for widespread nuclear plant construction was eroded due to abundant natural gas supplies, slow electricity demand growth in a weak US economy, lack of financing, and uncertainty following the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Many license applications for proposed new reactors were suspended or cancelled.Eileen O'Grady. Entergy says nuclear remains costly Reuters, May 25, 2010.Terry Ganey. AmerenUE pulls plug on project Columbia Daily Tribune, April 23, 2009. Only a few new reactors will enter service by 2020. These will not be the cheapest energy options available, but they are an attractive investment for utilities because the government mandates that taxpayers pay for construction in advance. In 2013, four aging, uncompetitive, reactors were permanently closed: San Onofre 2 and 3 in California, Crystal River 3 in Florida, and Kewaunee in Wisconsin. Vermont Yankee, in Vernon, is scheduled to close in 2014, following many protests. New York State is seeking to close Indian Point Energy Center, in Buchanan, 30 miles from New York City. Neither climate change abatement, nor the Obama Administration's endorsement of nuclear power with $18.5 billion in loan guarantees, have been able to propel nuclear power in the US past existing obstacles. The Fukushima nuclear disaster has not helped either.Sovacool, BK and SV Valentine. The National Politics of Nuclear Power: Economics, Security, and Governance (London: Routledge, 2012), p. 82. As of 2014, the U.S. nuclear industry began a new lobbying effort, hiring three former senators ‚Äî Evan Bayh, a Democrat; Judd Gregg, a Republican; and Spencer Abraham, a Republican ‚Äî as well as William M. Daley, a former staffer to President Obama. The initiative is called Nuclear Matters, and it has begun a newspaper advertising campaign. Locations of new US reactors and their scheduled operating dates are: * Tennessee, Watts Bar unit 2 in operation 2016 * Georgia, Vogtle Electric unit 3 operational 2019 and unit 4 operational 2020 * South Carolina, Virgil C Summer unit 2 operational 2019 and unit 3 operational 2020 On 29 March 2017, parent company Toshiba placed Westinghouse Electric Company in Chapter 11 bankruptcy because of US$9 billion of losses from its nuclear reactor construction projects. The projects responsible for this loss are mostly the construction of four AP1000 reactors at Vogtle in Georgia and V. C. Summer in South Carolina. The U.S. government had given $8.3 billion of loan guarantees on the financing of the four nuclear reactors being built in the U.S., and it is expected a way forward to completing the plant can be agreed. Peter A. Bradford, former U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission member, commented \\"They placed a big bet on this hallucination of a nuclear renaissance\\". Asia As of 2008, the greatest growth in nuclear generation was expected to be in China, Japan, South Korea and India. As of early 2013 China had 17 nuclear reactors operating and 32 under construction, with more planned. \\"China is rapidly becoming self- sufficient in reactor design and construction, as well as other aspects of the fuel cycle.\\" However, according to a government research unit, China must not build \\"too many nuclear power reactors too quickly\\", in order to avoid a shortfall of fuel, equipment and qualified plant workers. Following the Fukushima disaster, many are questioning the mass roll-out of new plants in India, including the World Bank, the Indian Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh, and the former head of the country's nuclear regulatory body, A. Gopalakrishnan. The massive Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project is the focus of concern ‚Äì \\"931 hectares of farmland will be needed to build the reactors, land that is now home to 10,000 people, their mango orchards, cashew trees and rice fields\\". Fishermen in the region say their livelihoods will be wiped out. South Korea is exploring nuclear projects with a number of nations.  Australia  Australia is a major producer of uranium, which it exports as uranium oxide to nuclear power generating nations. Australia has a single research reactor at Lucas Heights, but does not generate electricity via nuclear power. As of 2015, the majority of the nation's uranium mines are in South Australia, where a Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission is investigating the opportunities and costs of expanding the state's role in the nuclear fuel cycle. As of January 2016, new nuclear industrial development (other than the mining of uranium) is prohibited by various acts of federal and state legislation. The Federal government will consider the findings of the South Australian Royal Commission after it releases its findings in 2016. Canada With several CANDU reactors facing closure selected plants will be completely refurbished between 2016 and 2026, extending their operation beyond 2050. Europe EDF has said its third-generation EPR Flamanville 3 project (seen here in 2010) will be delayed until 2018, due to \\"both structural and economic reasons,\\" and the project's total cost has climbed to EUR 11 billion in 2012.EDF raises French EPR reactor cost to over $11 billion, Reuters, Dec 3, 2012. Similarly, the cost of the EPR being built at Olkiluoto, Finland has escalated dramatically, and the project is well behind schedule. The initial low cost forecasts for these megaprojects exhibited \\"optimism bias\\".Mancini, Mauro and Locatelli, Giorgio and Sainati, Tristano (2015). The divergence between actual and estimated costs in large industrial and infrastructure projects: is nuclear special? In: Nuclear new build: insights into financing and project management. Nuclear Energy Agency, pp. 177‚Äì188. On 18 October 2010 the British government announced eight locations it considered suitable for future nuclear power stations. This has resulted in public opposition and protests at some of the sites. In March 2012, two of the big six power companies announced they would be pulling out of developing new nuclear power plants. The decision by RWE npower and E.ON follows uncertainty over nuclear energy following the Fukushima nuclear disaster last year. The companies will not proceed with their Horizon project, which was to develop nuclear reactors at Wylfa in North Wales and at Oldbury-on-Severn in Gloucestershire. Their decision follows a similar announcement by Scottish and Southern Electricity last year. Analysts said the decision meant the future of UK nuclear power could now be in doubt. The 2011 Japanese Fukushima nuclear disaster has led some European energy officials to \\"think twice about nuclear expansion\\". Switzerland has abandoned plans to replace its old nuclear reactors and will take the last one offline in 2034. Anti-nuclear opposition intensified in Germany. In the following months the government decided to shut down eight reactors immediately (August 6, 2011) and to have the other nine off the grid by the end of 2022. Renewable energy in Germany is believed to be able to compensate for much of the loss. In September 2011 Siemens, which had been responsible for constructing all 17 of Germany's existing nuclear power plants, announced that it would exit the nuclear sector following the Fukushima disaster and the subsequent changes to German energy policy. Chief executive Peter Loescher has supported the German government's planned energy transition to renewable energy technologies, calling it a \\"project of the century\\" and saying Berlin's target of reaching 35% renewable energy sources by 2020 was feasible. On October 21, 2013, EDF Energy announced that an agreement had been reached regarding new nuclear plants to be built on the site of Hinkley Point C. EDF Group and the UK Government agreed on the key commercial terms of the investment contract. The final investment decision is still conditional on completion of the remaining key steps, including the agreement of the EU Commission. In February 2014, Amory Lovins commented that: > Britain's plan for a fleet of new nuclear power stations is ‚Ä¶ unbelievable > ... It is economically daft. The guaranteed price [being offered to French > state company EDF] is over seven times the unsubsidised price of new wind in > the US, four or five times the unsubsidised price of new solar power in the > US. Nuclear prices only go up. Renewable energy prices come down. There is > absolutely no business case for nuclear. The British policy has nothing to > do with economic or any other rational base for decision making. Middle East In December 2009 South Korea won a contract for four nuclear power plants to be built in the United Arab Emirates, for operation in 2017 to 2020. On March 17, 2011, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Israel was now unlikely to pursue civil nuclear energy.Netanyahu: We'll reconsider nuclear power plans Ynetnews, published March 18, 2011. Retrieved March 17, 2011. Russia In April 2010 Russia announced new plans to start building 10 new nuclear reactors in the next year. Views and opinions In June 2009, Mark Cooper from the Vermont Law School said: \\"The highly touted renaissance of nuclear power is based on fiction, not fact... There are numerous options available to meet the need for electricity in a carbon- constrained environment that are superior to building nuclear reactors\\".Mark Cooper. The Economics of Nuclear Reactors: Renaissance or Relapse? Vermont Law School, June 2009, p. 1 and p. 8. In September 2009, Luc Oursel, chief executive of Areva Nuclear Plants (the core nuclear reactor manufacturing division of Areva) stated: \\"We are convinced about the nuclear renaissance\\". Areva has been hiring up to 1,000 people a month, \\"to prepare for a surge in orders from around the world\\".Areva rushes to hire workers as demand for nuclear reactors explodes However, in June 2010, Standard & Poor's downgraded Areva's debt rating to BBB+ due to weakened profitability. In 2010, Trevor Findlay from the Centre for International Governance Innovation stated that \\"despite some powerful drivers and clear advantages, a revival of nuclear energy faces too many barriers compared to other means of generating electricity for it to capture a growing market share to 2030\\".Trevor Findlay (2010). The Future of Nuclear Energy to 2030 and its Implications for Safety, Security and Nonproliferation: Overview , The Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, p. 9. In January 2010, the International Solar Energy Society stated that \\"... it appears that the pace of nuclear plant retirements will exceed the development of the few new plants now being contemplated, so that nuclear power may soon start on a downward trend. It will remain to be seen if it has any place in an affordable future world energy policy\\".Donald W. Aitken. Transitioning to a Renewable Energy Future, International Solar Energy Society, January 2010, p. 8. In March 2010, Steve Kidd from the World Nuclear Association said: \\"Proof of whether the mooted nuclear renaissance is merely 'industry hype' as some commentators suggest or reality will come over the next decade\\".Stephen W. Kidd. WNA Director: Nuclear Reborn? Nuclear Street, March 11, 2010. In 2013 Kidd characterised the situation as a nuclear slowdown, requiring the industry to focus on better economics and improving public acceptance. In August 2010, physicist Michael Dittmar stated that: \\"Nuclear fission's contribution to total electric energy has decreased from about 18 per cent a decade ago to about 14 per cent in 2008. On a worldwide scale, nuclear energy is thus only a small component of the global energy mix and its share, contrary to widespread belief, is not on the rise\\". In March 2011, Alexander Glaser said: \\"It will take time to grasp the full impact of the unimaginable human tragedy unfolding after the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, but it is already clear that the proposition of a global nuclear renaissance ended on that day\\". In 2011, Benjamin K. Sovacool said: \\"The nuclear waste issue, although often ignored in industry press releases and sponsored reports, is the proverbial elephant in the room stopping a nuclear renaissance\\".Benjamin K. Sovacool (2011). Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy, World Scientific, p. 145.

Giannulli and his wife, actress Lori Loughlin, were charged and arrested in March 2019 in connection with the college admissions bribery scandal. Both agreed to plead guilty to the relevant charges and were sentenced to jail time and a fine in August 2020.  Early life  Giannulli was born Massimo Giannulli on June 4, 1963 in Los Angeles to parents of Italian descent, Gene, an architect, and Nancy Giannulli, a homemaker. He was raised in Encino, California. In the first grade, he changed his first name to Mossimo at the suggestion of a teacher who insisted it was easier to pronounce. After graduating from high school, he studied business and architecture at the University of Southern California for three years before dropping out in 1987. Mossimo Giannulli created Mossimo, a mid-range American clothing company in 1986 on Balboa Island in Newport Beach, California. Mossimo specializes in youth and teenage clothing such as shirts, jeans, jackets, socks, underwear, and accessories. During his first year in business he grossed $1 million. The following year he made $4 million. In 1991, Mossimo expanded the line to include sweatshirts, knits, and sweaters. By 1995, the collection included women's clothing and men's tailored suits. After eight years in business, Mossimo, Inc. had grown into a multimillion- dollar lifestyle sportswear and accessories company. In 1996, Mossimo went public with an initial public offering. After shares tumbled from $50 to $4 when the founder tried and failed to make the transition from streetwear/beachwear to high fashion, he took the brand downscale, announcing on March 28, 2000, Mossimo, Inc. a major, multi-product licensing agreement with Target stores, for $27.8 million.Earnest, Leslie (29 March 2000). With Losses Mounting, Mossimo Turns to Target, Los Angeles Times. In 2006, Mossimo was acquired by Iconix Brand Group. College Bribery Scandal On March 12, 2019, Giannulli and his wife Lori Loughlin were arrested in connection with their alleged involvement in a nationwide college entrance exam cheating scandal, regarding their two daughters' (including Olivia Jade) admission to USC. They were charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services fraud. They were released on $1 million bail each. They were among 50 people charged. In April 2019 the couple were additionally charged with money- laundering offences. The indictment against the couple alleged that they had paid $500,000, disguised as a donation to the Key Worldwide Foundation, in order that the University of Southern California's (USC's) admissions committee would be led to believe that their two daughters would be joining the school's women's rowing team if admitted, when in fact neither young woman had ever trained in the sport and had no plans to do so. Initially denying the charges Giannulli, along with his wife, was later reported to have pled guilty as part of a plea bargain. On August 21, 2020 Giannulli was sentenced to 5 months in prison and a $250,000 fine, while his wife was sentenced to 2 months in prison and a $150,000 fine. Gianulli and Loughlin both have until November 19, to report to prison.

After a traumatic dinner sequence, the song is played during a tense moment between West and the phoenix. At the Vevo Presents GOOD Music musical presentation, the song was performed by both West and Legend together. The two performed a few song together before Legend performed his own single \\"Ordinary People\\" separately. A planned music video for the song was going to feature an appearance by Amber Rose, however she declined the offer.Coleman, Vernon (2012-07-07). Amber Rose Turned Down Role In Kanye's ‚ÄòBlame Game' Video. . HipHopWired. Retrieved on 2010-11-30. Rose commented that she passed on the video because she \\"just felt like Chris Rock's part was disrespectful\\", believing that the song painted her in a negative light. Another reason for her declining to appear in the video because of her then-current relationship with rapper Wiz Khalifa, feeling that appearing in an ex-boyfriend's musical venture would be disrespectful to Khalifa. West told Rose that both \\"Blame Game\\" and the Runaway film were partially inspired by his relationship with her.Staff (2011-07-01).

Early life William O'Shaughnessy was a member of the U√≠ Seachnasaigh (O'Shaughnessy) of Cen√©l √Åeda na hEchtge in south County Galway. His father was The √ì Seachnasaigh, Roger O'Shaughnessy, while his mother was Helen O'Brien, daughter of Conor mac Donogh O'Brien, a son of Donogh O'Brien, 4th Earl of Thomond. He was born at the family home in the town of Gort. From about 1689 he was captain of a company of one hundred members of his clan and retainers. In spring 1690 he left for France to serve in the regiment of Daniel O'Brien. Upon his father's death in July 1690 following the Battle of the Boyne, he became The √ì Seachnasaigh, but because of the defeat of his side in the Williamite War in Ireland, his ancestral property was forfeited and he was never able to return home. In the service of France Map of Ireland showing the major battles of the war Memorial for the Battle of Blenheim 1704, Lutzingen, Germany. O'Shaughnessy served in the armies of France in the hope that Irish support would enable James II, or his successors, regain the throne of Britain and Ireland. He was present at the siege of Montmelian (1691); with the French army in Italy (1692); and fought at the Battle of Marsaglia in 1693. At the conclusion of the siege of Valenza in 1696, he was promoted to Commandant of the Third Battalion of the Regiment of Clare. The Peace of Ryswick brought an end to the War of the League of Augsburg in 1697. This meant the disbanding of two of the regiment's three battalions, though O'Shaughnessy was kept on, been appointed captain of the regiment's Grenadiers. With the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession, the Regiment of Clare re-recruited and served in the German theatre during the opening years of the war. He was present at the following actions at this time: Kehl, Munderkingen and the first battle of Blenheim, all in 1703. The following year saw the defeat of the French at the second battle of Blenheim. However, Clare and the other Irish regiments performed with honour in the debacle, with one commentator stating \\"It was the regiment of Clare that sustained the retreat of the French army, and thus covered itself with glory.\\" The Regiment performed a similar task two years later at the Battle of Ramillies, preventing the Dutch and English from completely wiping out the army. The regiment lost thirty-eight officers and three hundred and twenty-six soldiers out of a total of eight hundred men. Because of the death of regimental Major O'Carroll, O'Shaughnessy was promoted to that rank with effect 4 July 1706, and in September to lieutenant-colonel. He and his men fought at Oudenaarde, Malplaquet and other engagements until the end of the war in 1714. In April 1721 he became a Brigadier and made Marechal de Camp in 1735. Though now in his sixties he continued to participate actively in battle till the years prior to his death. He was appointed commander of the garrison at Gravelines in 1743 but died two months later in January 1744. Opposing him at the Battle of Malplaquet was Sir Thomas Prendergast, 1st Baronet, who had been granted O'Shaughnessy's Irish lands. Prendergast was killed in this battle. Personal life Major-General O'Shaughnessy was of the U√≠ Fiachrach Aidhne dynasty, making him a direct descendant of Fiachrae mac Eochaid Mugmedon (fl. early 5th century). He married Maire Jacqueline Francoise de Gauville on 15 February 1729 at Aire-sur-la Lys. They had no children. His mother, Lady Helen, died at Fiddaun Castle in 1729, after which it was abandoned. His cousin successor as The √ì Seachnasaigh, Bishop Colman O'Shaughnessy, O.P. (1736‚Äì1748) of Ossory, who died in 1748, tried in vain for decades to recover their lands from Sir Thomas Prendergast and his heirs, but without success. He in turn was succeeded by Robuck O'Shaughnessy, and lastly by Robuck's son, Joseph, who died about 1780. With the death of Joseph O'Shaughnessy, the senior line of the family apparently died out. The register of death of the church of Saint Willibrord, Gravelines, states that: > On 2 January 1744, there died in the communion of our mother church, having > had the holy sacraments administered to him Missire Guillaume O Shaughnussy, > knight of the order of St. Louis, lieutenant-colonel of the Irish regiment > of Clare, marechal de camps et armess of the king, employed at Gravelines in > the service of his majesty; he was a native of Gort-inchygory, county > Galway, province of Conought in Ireland, aged seventy years, married to Dame > Maire Jacqueline Gauville.

Several marking strategies exist in football, and they mostly differ from each other according to the duties assigned to defenders, positioning and off-the-ball style. Man-to-man marking Man-to-man marking, or man marking, is a defensive strategy where defenders are assigned a specific opposition player to mark rather than covering an area of the pitch.Catlin 1990, p. 141. The idea of man-to-man marking was perfected by the Italian teams of the 1960s and 1970s. Teams such as Inter Milan and A.C. Milan used it in their so-called catenaccio system. Their formation consisted of a defensive line made up of four man markers with a sweeper playing behind them. This brought much success to these teams and soon these tactics became popular throughout the world of football. However, this tight marking was often at the expense of the (attacking) spectacle of the game itself, because \\"defenders preoccupied with their defensive markings may be reluctant contributors to the team's offense\\".Catlin 1990, p. 143. Famous examples of man marking performances are Berti Vogts against Johann Cruyff in 1974, Claudio Gentile against Diego Maradona and Zico in 1982, or Guido Buchwald against Maradona in 1990. The strategy is one that has been supposedly dying out in football over the past decade or so despite Greece's success with it in the 2004 European Championships. It is however often used by lower-tier teams, as well as teams defending themselves from much stronger opponents. Examples include Dynamo Kyiv's Aleksandr Khatskevich man-marking Real Madrid's Predrag Mijatoviƒá in the 1999 Champions League quarter-finals,https://medium.com/@Zuishek/from-the- vault-lobanovskyis-first-step-towards-the-1999-semi-final-38ced0c180b5 PSV Eindhoven's Park Ji-sung man-marking Milan's Andrea Pirlo in the 2005 Champions League semi-finals,https://medium.com/@Zuishek/from-the-vault-psvs- jigsaw-to-control-ac-milan-a17a23be46d8 Chelsea's Michael Essien man-marking Liverpool's Steven Gerrard in the 2009 Champions League quarter- finalshttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/5133141/Chelseas- Michael-Essien-leave-his-mark-on-Liverpools-Steven- Gerrard.htmlhttp://www.chelseadaft.org/2009/04/match-report- liverpool-1-3-chelsea.html, Chelsea's Jos√© Bosingwa man-marking Barcelona's Lionel Messi in the same season's Champions League semi- finalshttps://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/97015/Bosingwa-has-Messi- jobhttps://www.irishtimes.com/sport/bosingwa-in-line-to-mark-messi-1.753076 and Manchester United's Danny Welbeck man-marking Real Madrid's Xabi Alonso in the 2013 Champions League round of 16.http://www.zonalmarking.net/2013/03/06/manchester-united-1-2-real-madrid- red-card-allows-real-to-take- control/https://www.arsenal.com/news/features/20140905/danny-welbeck Managers such as Guus Hiddink and Marcelo Bielsa have occasionally continued to use man-marking in the 21st century, Bielsa employing it as late as 2020.http://www.zonalmarking.net/2012/03/08/manchester-united-2-3-athletic- bilbao-pressing/http://www.zonalmarking.net/2015/04/08/marseille-2-3-psg- bielsas-pressing-has-positives-and- negatives/https://talksport.com/football/759721/leeds-tactics-liverpool- chelsea-frank-lampard-marcelo-bielsa/ Zonal marking Zonal marking is a defensive strategy where defenders cover an area of the pitch rather than marking a specific opponent. If an opponent moves into the area a defender is covering, the defender marks the opponent. If the opponent leaves this area, then marking the opponent becomes the responsibility of another defender.Catlin 1990, p. 140. The biggest advantage of zonal marking is its flexibility. When the team regains possession of the ball, players are still in their positions and can start an attack more quickly. Communication is very important when zonal marking is used, to ensure that no gaps are left in the defensive coverage. Zonal marking is more difficult when defending set pieces such as free kicks and corners, and most teams change to man marking in these situations. The formation used by a team may dictate whether or not to use zonal marking. Teams playing 4‚Äì4‚Äì2 usually operate a zonal marking system, but teams playing a sweeper do not. Amongst professional teams zonal marking is the most common system: 15 of the 16 teams that reached the knockout stages of the 2004 UEFA Champions League used zonal marking. Training methods to develop this technique include coloured cones and a 5-metre rope. The coloured cone method is set up by having certain colours set out in sections of the pitch; each player will be put in the coloured section and will not be allowed to leave it. The 5-metre rope is a piece of equipment where the four defenders are attached by a rope which means they are used to staying and working together. Marking today Today, several modern defensive formations use a mixture of both man-to-man and zonal marking e.g. 3‚Äì5‚Äì2 formation (which defensively becomes a 5‚Äì3‚Äì2). This means 5 defenders: 2 stoppers marking man- to-man, 1 sweeper (sweepers always mark by zone), and 2 wingbacks playing almost like end-to-end side midfielders. Also, several other teams rely exclusively on pure zonal marking approaches.

Having passed his NCTJ exams, Wallis worked for The Northern Echo (in its Durham office) before becoming a senior reporter for the Manchester Evening News. At this point in his career, Wallis became a Crime Reporter, giving talks to police officers on police-media relations, whilst also freelancing for The Sunday People, progressing from the paper's Manchester desk to its London office. Wallis later said: \\"During this time I travelled extensively throughout Britain and the world as both a hard news reporter and as an investigator. This included lengthy periods in the USA, the Middle East and Northern Ireland during the 'Troubles' - where I was hospitalised after being caught up in a particularly violent riot. I spent six months in Argentina during the Falklands War including spells in Buenos Aires and Commadorio Rivadavia, the invasion base of the Argentinean Junta. I also spent time in most countries in Europe and the Mediterranean\\". Wallis then became the paper's Chief Investigative Reporter, responsible for conducting investigations into \\"murders, show business scandals, corruption, crime in general, drugs, spying and politics\\". In December 1986, he joined News International's UK tabloid newspaper The Sun where he served in a series of assistant and editorial roles before becoming Deputy Editor in 1993. He left The Sun in 1998 and took up the editorship of The People. In 2003, he moved to become Deputy Editor of the News of the World, and in 2007 he became Executive Editor of the paper. In May 2009, he announced that he would be leaving his post later in the year.John Plunkett, \\"Neil Wallis to leave News of the World\\", The Guardian, 1 May 2009 He was known as \\"The Wolfman\\" by fellow journalists. Wallis is a former member of the Editors' Code of Practice Committee at the Press Complaints Commission. Wallis currently works regularly as a media commentator for both television and radio stations such as talkRADIO https://talkradio.co.uk/neil-wallis Public relations After leaving journalism he worked for the Outside Organisation, a company specialising in public relations, becoming Managing Director in 2010. Wallis' own company, Chamy Media, provided \\"strategic communication advice and support\\" to the Metropolitan Police on a part-time basis from October 2009 to September 2010 whilst the Met's Deputy Director of Public Affairs was on extended sick leave. It is alleged that while recovering from illness Sir Paul Stephenson, head of the Metropolitan Police, accepted a free extended stay (worth ¬£12,000) at a Champneys health spa, a company which then employed Wallis for PR work. Upon announcing his resignation from the Metropolitan Police on 17 July 2011, Stephenson acknowledged that his decision to resign was \\"in particular in relation to Neil Wallis\\". Arrest and prosecution On 14 July 2011, Wallis was arrested by the Metropolitan Police investigating the News of the World phone hacking scandal. At this development, the Outside Organisation edited their website, removing his listing as MD and a part of his biography which had stated \\"What he [Wallis] doesn‚Äôt know about journalism and media isn‚Äôt worth knowing\\". In February 2013, it emerged the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) would not be charging Wallis over phone hacking. This changed on 30 July 2014, when the CPS announced that it had authorised the Metropolitan Police to charge Wallis with conspiring to hack phones to listen to voicemails between January 2003 and January 2007.Deans, Jason (July 2014). ‚ÄúPhone hacking: NoW‚Äôs Neil Wallis and Jules Stenson to be charged‚Äù, The Guardian, 30 July 2014.

In its statement the CPS said it had been decided there was \\"sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and that a prosecution is in the public interest\\". The paper's former features editor Jules Stenson was also charged and was scheduled to appear with Wallis before Westminster Magistrates' Court on 21 August 2014.BBC News (July 2014). ‚ÄúTwo ex-News of the World journalists charged over hacking‚Äù, BBC News, 30 July 2014.

On 1 July 2015, Wallis was unanimously cleared by the jury after it had spent four days considering the charges against him. Speaking outside the court Wallis said he was feeling \\"very emotional\\", adding that the case against him had been part of a \\"vicious politically driven campaign\\" against the press. He claimed that fighting the claims against him had cost him his life savings, damaged his health and career, and taken a toll on his family.

Model-driven development: a metamodeling foundation linear modeling architecture, ambiguous constructs and incomprehensible/unclear architecture. OGML provides a nested modeling architecture with three fixed layers (models, languages and metalanguage). Therefore, it is clear how the different models conform to each other and can be handled. Constructs in OGML are chosen from the science of ontology, making the distinction between properties / objects and classes / objects very clear. This commitment makes explicit certain oddities of the definition of, for example, relations. Furthermore, OGML provides an explicit notion of instantiation:Laarman, A. (2009). An Ontology- Based Metalanguage with Explicit Instantiation model elements encode their types and languages define the semantics of instantiation. This extra information is needed in the relative modeling architecture to distinguish between structural and conceptual views on models, for example: we may want to view a UML model as an instance of the object language and an instance of the Class model (Clabject). By providing this dual view on the metamodel layer and on the language layer, OGML provides a very precise modeling architecture and an expressive way to deal with models.

The village consists mainly of residential properties and farm buildings. There is also a popular children's nursery. Although there was once a village shop there are no shops currently located within the village. However, there is major supermarket adjacent to Loversall Parish, within the development known as Woodfield Plantation. There are also a small number of shops and a Post Office in the adjacent village of Wadworth. Loversall Lakes (Quarry Farm) is a popular fishing facility and periodically the fields around Loversall are used for clay pigeon shooting. St Katherines Church is a Grade II* listed building. It appears to have been built before 1207 by the Fossard family, who owned the Manor of Hexthorpe under Count Robert de Mortain (half brother to William the Conqueror). Within the churchyard lies an early 14th-century tomb chest which is also Grade II* listed. How to Study an Old Church, A.Needham, pub Batsford. Page 13. Loversall Hall, next to the church, is a large but plainly-built house, its principal front built by the Fenton family of Leeds between 1808 and 1816, although the buildings at the rear are probably seventeenth century. Loversall was part of the manor of Doncaster, and its church, dedicated to St Katherine, was technically a chapel of ease in the parish of Doncaster, rather than a fully-fledged parish church. There are a number of working farms in the Parish, including Quarry Farm adjacent to the A60 and Loversall Farm, the farmhouse for which is located within the village. Pear Tree Farm, also within the village, is no longer a working farm but the farmhouse, thought to be around 250 years old, remains in residential use. History of the Parish of Loversall The history of Loversall's parish records illustrates both the vulnerability of archives and one of the uses of bishop‚Äôs transcripts. Although the church at Loversall is medieval, the parish registers begin only in the nineteenth century. The reason for this lies in the events of a winter‚Äôs night on 7 and 8 February 1844, when thieves broke into the church. They broke open the parish chest, probably in hope of stealing the communion plate. Finding no valuable contents, they made a fire to warm themselves in the bitter winter weather. Their fuel was the oak chest and most of its contents, namely all the parish registers but the most recent marriage and burial registers. Access to Loversall via A60 From South The information in the registers was not irretrievably lost. Since 1598, parishes had been obliged to make a yearly return to the bishop of the diocese, listing all the baptisms, marriages and burials which had taken place in the parish in the previous year. Loversall, like other local parishes, sent in its returns to York, and these are now to be found in the Borthwick Institute for Archives, along with all the other records of the archdiocese of York. The parish register transcripts for Loversall survive from 1601 to 1830, and so most of the information which would have been found in the parish registers is still available to family historians. Loversall as a Conservation area Loversall was designated a conservation area on 19 October 1979. The character of Loversall Conservation Area is that of a small open grained village of traditional limestone buildings with clay pantile roofs. The village appears to have grown within the Loversall Hall parkland to serve the listed Loversall Hall. The main street appears from map evidence to have continued to the south east past the listed dovecote and walled garden to Loversall Hall. This was blocked off possibly when the route to the Hall was diverted to the north around the time the Hall was rebuilt in 1811. Historically domestic and agricultural buildings, probably tied to the Loversall estate, developed along Bubup Hill. These front the road and are almost exclusively of coursed rubble limestone and clay pantiles which gives a homogeneous character to this part of the conservation area. The most significant of these is Loversall Farm which was the major farm of the village. Its importance is demonstrated by being three storeys high rather than two storeys which is the norm of the village. Being elevated and with no development in front of it the building dominates the key view on approaching from Wadworth. To the east is Loversall Hall and its curtilage buildings. Part of the walled garden survives with the listed dovecote to one corner though the walled garden is now subdivided between two modern properties. South and west of the drive approaching the hall is parkland in character and is designated as Green Belt. Formerly, this part of the conservation area would have been relatively open but 20th century developments have infilled the land between Bubup Hill and the Hall. Some of this is incongruous and suburban in character. The most unusual of these infills is a pair of Swedish timber bungalows introduced in 1948. Listed Buildings in Loversall Conservation Area There are five listed structures within the area. *Church of St Katherine Grade II* EH reference 334820 *Tomb Chest (churchyard) Grade II* EH reference 334821 *Grave Slab (churchyard) Grade II EH reference 334822 *Loversall Hall Grade II EH reference 334823 *Dovecote Grade II EH reference 334824 References Category:Villages in Doncaster Category:Civil parishes in South Yorkshire ","title":"Loversall"},{"id":"24136972","text":"AppAssure, now called Quest Rapid Recovery, started as a series of backup solutions developed and marketed by the company with the same name until Dell acquired the company in February 2012.Official announcement Dell acquires AppAssure, 24 February 2012.

The entrance to the mine is at the former settlement of Stockton. The mine was operated by Solid Energy in a partnership agreement with Downer Australia. Solid Energy obtained the Stockton Coal Mining Licence (CML) in 1987 for a period of 40 years. In 2016 Talley's, in a joint purchase with Bathurst Resources, bought this and former Solid Energy mines at Rotowaro and Maramarua. The coal field is situated between 5 and 10 kilometres linear distance south west of Stockton. The southernmost part of the coal field is only 5 km away from the historic mining town of Denniston. The elevation of the coal field varies between 500 and 1100m above sea level. The Stockton coal field dips to the Northeast with approximately the same dip as the Denniston Coal Field, 15 km to the south. Both fields contain Bituminous Hard Coking Coal. The extracted coal is transported from the mine to an aerial ropeway near Stockton. The coal is transported to Ngakawau using this ropeway, doing away with the dangerous railway operation that plagued the Millerton and Denniston Inclines. From Ngakawau, most of the coal is transported by rail to Lyttelton, where it is exported via ship to steel makers in Japan, India, China, South Africa and Brazil. Parcels of coal are barged from Westport to Port Kembla, New South Wales in Australia. While the Stockton mining has created local jobs, the environmental impact has created some resistance against extending the operation to include the proposed Cypress Mine at Happy Valley. This led to the formation of the Save Happy Valley Campaign (SHVC). There are plans for two hydroelectric power stations in and around the mine. The Stockton Plateau Hydro Project instigated by Hydro Development Ltd has been granted approval and Solid Energy has applied for resource consents for their Stockton Hydro Scheme. Stockton mine railway  The Stockton mine railway was, in 1908, New Zealand‚Äôs first electric railway. It carried coal from the Westport-Stockton Coal Companies mine to the NZR railhead at Ngakawau on the West Coast of the South Island from 1908 to 1953, when it was replaced by an aerial cableway. The line was 10.5 km long, with 2.4 km in two long tunnels. The system used 275 v DC from a low overhead line via trolley poles, and 915 mm gauge track. The seven locos were of low built \\"mine\\" type.

The aqueduct took water from the river Jadro, 9 kilometres northeast of Diocletian's Palace, today Split's city centre, and brought water to the Palace over a height difference of 13 m. Another aqueduct took water from the same source to Salona. The aqueduct was destroyed in the invasion of Goths in the middle of 6th century and did not work for thirteen centuries after that. The first reconstruction of the aqueduct took place during the reign of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (1877‚Äì1880). The Diocletianic aqueduct was abandoned in 1932, when the modern water station was built in Kopilica, a peripheral area of Split. The best-preserved part of the aqueduct near Dujmovaƒça (Solin) has a maximum height of 16.5 m and a length of 180 m. The aqueduct is currently being restored.

Landry appears in the names of towns in France, Canada and the United States, as well as three canonized saints. History Landry: It was not until the early Middle Ages that surnames were introduced to distinguish between numbers of people bearing the same personal or Christian name. Landry is of patronymic origin, coming from Landericus, belonging to that category of names derived from the first name of the father or ancestor. In this case, the name simply denotes \\"the son of Landry\\", a popular personal name during the medieval period, early forms of which included Landri, and the regional variant Landry. Today in France, the name is also found in the forms of Landrin and Landron. The name is in fact, of ultimate Germanic origin, being derived from the old baptismal name \\"Land- rick\\", a composite name which signifies, literally, \\"land/country-powerful\\". Different spellings of the same original surname are a common occurrence. Dictionaries of surnames indicate probable spelling variations of Landry to be: * L'andre * Landre * Landri * Landro * Landrey * Lendry It appears, however, that it is not known for certain when the name was first recorded. Although Landry is considered French in origin, it is not found throughout France. Rather it seems to have been concentrated around three small villages, south of the town of Loudon, province of Poitou: LaChausee, Martaize and Aulnay. In Quebec, however, the surname is quite commonly spread, along with Ladrie of probably similar origin. > I am given to understand that the Landry name is well known in the area > around Loudun in Poitou, but is rather hard to find elsewhere in France.

He served as Bishop of Galveston from 1892 until his death in 1918. Biography One of eleven children, Nicolaus Gallagher was born in Temperanceville, Belmont County, Ohio, to John and Mary Ann (n√©e Brinton) Gallagher. At age 10 was placed under the care of the pastor of Coshocton, who tutored him in English, grammar, Latin, and Greek for six years. In 1862 he entered Mount St. Mary's of the West Seminary at Cincinnati, where he studied philosophy and theology. He was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Sylvester Horton Rosecrans on December 25, 1868. Gallagher then served as curate at St. Patrick's Church in Columbus until 1871, when he became president of St. Aloysius Seminary. He returned to St. Patrick's as pastor in 1876, and became administrator of the Diocese of Columbus in 1878. In 1880 he was named vicar general of the diocese. Upon the retirement of Bishop Claude Marie Dubuis, he became administrator of the Diocese of Galveston, Texas, in 1881. On January 10, 1882, Gallagher was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Galveston and Titular Bishop of Canopus by Pope Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following April 30 from Bishop Edward Fitzgerald, with Bishops John Claude Neraz and Dominic Manucy serving as co-consecrators, at St. Mary's Cathedral. In 1886, he opened the first Catholic school for African American children in Texas. He later succeeded Bishop Dubuis as the third Bishop of Galveston on December 16, 1892. He introduced into the diocese the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word, Jesuits, Basilian Fathers, Paulist Fathers, Sisters of the Third Order of St. Dominic and many other religious congregations, which founded churches, schools, and hospitals throughout the diocese. He established St. Mary's Seminary at La Porte in 1901, and Good Shepherd Home for Delinquent Girls at Houston in 1914. He also erected parishes for Mexican immigrants in Austin and Houston, and for African Americans in Houston, Beaumont, and Port Arthur. He reconstructed all the Catholic institutions destroyed by the 1900 Galveston hurricane. At the beginning of his tenure, the diocese had 30,000 Catholics and 50 parishes; by the time of his death, there were 70,000 Catholics and 120 parishes. Gallagher later died at age 71. His funeral Mass was celebrated by Bishop Theophile Meerschaert, and he was buried at St. Mary's Cathedral.

The park was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps, beginning in 1933. Devil's Den State Park is in the Lee Creek Valley in the Boston Mountains, which are the southwestern part of The Ozarks. The park, with an CCC-built lake, is open for year-round recreation, with trails for hiking, mountain biking and horseback riding. Devil's Den State Park also has several picnic areas, a swimming pool and cabins, with camping sites ranging from modern to primitive. Fossils of coral and crinoids can be found along the banks and within Lee Creek at Devil's Den State Park. History Devil's Den State Park, in the Lee Creek Valley, protects the largest sandstone crevice area in the United States. The valley is littered with numerous sandstone caves, bluffs, ravines, rock shelters and crevices that provided an excellent hiding place for outlaws on the Butterfield Stage Line, from 1858 until the beginning of the American Civil War in 1861. With the onset of the war, the rocky area was used by bands of Confederate guerillas as a hideout and staging area for conducting raids on the Union Army's supply lines as well as civilian targets. The roads of the Butterfield State Line were also used by regular troops during the Civil War. Confederate and Union forces used the road during the Battle of Prairie Grove and for the Raid on Van Buren. The former town of Anna is contained within the park. It was destroyed by a flood in 1893. All that remains of the town is a cemetery, a well, and some foundations. The remnants of Anna can be seen along the Butterfield Hiking Trail near Junction Camp. Lee Creek Valley was identified during the Great Depression as a site for a state park. Construction on the park began in 1933. Devil's Den State Park was built by young men working for the Civilian Conservation Corps, which was established during the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt to provide work for unemployed men throughout the United States. The young men of the CCC lived in military-style barracks and constructed many of the recreational facilities at the park, including pavilions, trails and the dam and spillway on Lee Creek that forms Lake Devil. The park underwent an extensive renovation in the 1970s when the CCC-built structures were refurbished. Devil's Den State Park is recognized as one of the best preserved CCC projects in the United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994 for its CCC-related Rustic architecture. Geology Devil's Den State Park is in the Lee Creek Valley of the Boston Mountains, which are part of The Ozarks. The area is a high and deeply dissected plateau in northern Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma. The rocks of the region are essentially little disturbed, flat-lying sedimentary layers of the Paleozoic age. The highest ridges and peaks are capped by Pennsylvanian sandstone and shale. The deeply eroded valleys are cut into Mississippian limestones, and below that layer, Ordovician dolomites. The caves, ravines and crevices were partly formed by slippage in sandstone formations. The Devil's Ice Box, one of the most visited caves in the park, is named for the cool air that rushes out of the cave. Air enters the cave at a point higher on the mountainside and is cooled as it passes through the mountain to the mouth of the cave. Recreation Cabins and camping The park features 17 full- service cabins and 143 camp sites. The cabins are along Lee Creek. All are \\"rustic\\", with fully equipped kitchens plus heating and air-conditioning. The cabins, with stone fireplaces, are open year-round. Devil's Den State Park is home to 146 campsites of various type. Many have electric hookups and running water; others are little more than a cleared and level patch of ground on which to set up a tent. Trails Pedal boat dock on Lake Devil Devil's Den State Park is home to approximately of trails that are open to hiking, mountain biking and horseback riding, with of trails that are designated horse trails. Each horse trail begins and ends at the Devil's Den State Park horse camp on the southern end of the camp in the Lee Creek Valley. Two of the trails cross into neighboring Ozark National Forest. *Old Road Trail is long. It is named for the old dirt Arkansas Highway 170 that was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps. It is the only trail contained entirely within Devil's Den State Park. Old Road was the main road through Lee Creek Valley. Near the head of the trail, it passes by discarded car parts from the earliest days of the automobile. Throughout the course of the trail, it passes through a cedar grove, runs parallel, in places to Arkansas Highway 170 and then passes nearby the Yellow Rock Bluff overlook. Horses must be tied at a hitching post before visitors walk to the overlook. Old Road Trail continues to wind through the park and passes by the CCC overlook. The CCC overlook *Gorley King Trail is long. It is named for Gorely King of Elkins, Arkansas. Gorley rode the trails at Devil's Den and outer areas during the 1970s, until the early 90s. Gorley, along with good friend Clifford Earl, helped to cut and maintain many of the trails in the outer forestry area. Both were trailbosses of the NorthWest Arkansas Calvalcade and helped establish the horse park as well as being advisors to the Arkansas Trails Co. The Gorley King trail was not only a trail Gorley made for the park but was also the last trail that he rode the day previous to his passing. Gorley was in his 90s. The trail begins on the eastern end of the horse camp and heads down Lee Creek Valley, where it joins the Butterfield Hiking Trail and Vista Point Trail. The trails climb the valley and rise above Lee Creek. Gorley King Trail then follows Holt Ridge into Ozark National Forest before returning to the park along an old logging road into the Lee Creek Valley. *Vista Point Trail is long. It follows Gorley King Trail for . Then it ascends Holt Ridge and heads out onto the plateau in Ozark National Forest. Here it passes a quarry that was used by the CCC to build some of the facilities at Devil's Den State Park. Next it ascends Mount Olive and crosses the Butterfield Hiking Trail. Vista Point Trail loops back through the national forest and towards the park, passing a 19th-century homestead and the Vista Point Overlook before returning to the park following part of the Gorley King Trail back to the horse camp. *Butterfield Hiking Trail is long. The loop trail is marked with blue blazes. It begins and ends in Devil's Den State Park and passes through Ozark National Forest in Washington and Crawford County before returning to the park. Butterfield Hiking Trail is named for the Butterfield Stage Line that passed through Arkansas, a stagecoach route in the United States that operated from 1857 to 1861. It was a route for the United States mail from two eastern termini, Memphis, Tennessee, and St. Louis, Missouri, meeting at Fort Smith, Arkansas, and continuing through Indian Territory, New Mexico, and Arizona, ending in San Francisco, California.Waterman L. Ormsby, Lyle H. Wright, Josephine M. Bynum, The Butterfield Overland Mail: Only Through Passenger on the First Westbound Stage. Henry E. Huntington Library and Art Gallery, 2007. pp. viii, 167, 173. A writer for the New York Herald, Waterman L. Ornsby, described the Butterfield trail as it passed through the Boston Mountains. He said, \\"It is impossible that any road could be worse. I might say the road was steep, rugged, jagged, rough and mountainous and then wish for more impressive words.\\" *CCC Interpretive Trail is just long. It is a self-guided trail that passes through the Civilian Conservation Corps camp. There are trail side exhibits that explain the history of the CCC at Devil's Den State Park. *Cross Country Mountain Bike Trail is long. It features creek crossings, dirt roads, single track riding and long uphills and downhills. It is divided into three loops and runs outside the park into Ozark National Forest. Riders are required to carry a permit from the park offices to ride the trail. *Devil's Den Self-Guided Trail is a National Recreation Trail. It is long. It passes by two of the most popular attractions at the park: Devil's Den and the Devil's Icebox. It also features erosional remnants of sandstone strata, wet weather waterfalls and a variety of plant and animal life. *Yellow Rock Trail is 3 miles (4.8 km) long. Users will hike 300 feet (91 m) in elevation to one of the best views in the park. Atop the Yellow Rock is an unobstructed view of the Lee Creek valley. Along the rest of the trail users enjoy cedar glades, interesting rock formations, and the first structure built in the park. *Fossil Flats is a 3-5 mile (4.8-8 km) mountain bike or day hike trail. The flat exposed rock in the creek bed lends this trail its name. Many fossils are visible in the exposed creek bed. Along the trail you will see evidence of the CCC and early settlers, creek views, and big rock formations. This trail gives riders a choice of a 2.4, 4.2, or 6 mile rides and the difficulty increases with each mile added.

Feuchtinger was commander of the 21st Panzer Division during the Normandy Invasion. Later in 1944 he was tried and convicted of treason by the Reich court, demoted and sentenced to execution. The sentence was commuted by the intervention of Adolf Hitler. Feuchtinger did not report to his next assignment, and avoided the German military police until he could surrender to the Allies. Later in life, while a private citizen, Feuchtinger was pressured by the KGB into finding and disclosing secret information on the West German military and transferring this information to the Soviet Union. In 2008 his conviction by the Reich court in 1944 came up during a German national discussion on the review of war veterans convicted by the Nazi government of treason. His earlier conviction was not overturned. World War I Feuchtinger joined a cadet school in Karlsruhe in 1907. During the First World War, he fought as lieutenant in Russia and France. While there, he participated in the Battle of Verdun, the Battle of the Somme and the Second Battle of the Aisne. World War II After Germany's capitulation, Feuchtinger was selected to continue on as an officer in the much reduced Reichswehr where he served in a variety of staff roles. He transitioned to field command in 1937, and in August 1939, he was appointed to command an artillery regiment of the 227th Infantry Division. Feuchtinger commanded this unit in the western campaign, fighting in Belgium and France. In 1941, the unit was transferred to the Eastern Front, where his division participated in Operation Barbarossa as part of Army Group North. France 1943 On November 27, 1942 he commanded Kampfgruppe A during the German occupation of previously free Vichy France. His forces occupied the city of Toulon and attempted to bring the ships of the French fleet stationed there under their control. In April 1943 Feuchtinger was appointed commander of a \\"Schnelle Division\\" (fast division). The fast divisions were a new concept and were intended to be a highly mobile division to allow the few forces in France to rapidly respond to an invasion threat that could suddenly materialize in any one of a number of coast regions in France. Four of these were to be formed and based in central France. Though a good businessman and organizer, Feuchtinger had no experience as a panzer commander, and his appointment is thought to have been due to his connections in the Nazi Party.Mitcham 2009, p. 53 The division formed was known as Schnell Division West (Fast Division West). The fast divisions were to be highly motorized, and were intended to have greater transport capacity than was allotted to a panzer division. This concept could not be implemented due to shortfalls in equipment. Germany could not replace its losses in the east, let alone equip new formations in France. To provide his division with equipment Feuchtinger prevailed upon Major Alfred Becker, a friend of his who was a mechanical engineer. Feuchtinger had championed Major Becker's efforts to make use of captured French equipment and convert them to mobilize German guns. Becker had been converting captured and damaged French equipment from 1940 into functioning vehicles that would be effective in the combat of 1943. Becker was given a command in the division, and soon set about equipping the division with modified French light tractors, halftracks and trucks. These he provided with light armour shielding to protect the crews from small arms fire, and many were modified to carry a heavy gun or other weapons. The troops that filled the ranks of the division initially were a mix of soldiers from Germany and volunteers from the occupied territories. Four months later the forming unit was enlarged and organized into a standard panzer division, and was given the designation of the 21st Panzer Division. The original 21st Panzer Division had been part of the Afrika Korps and was reduced in the battles of North Africa. The bulk of the remainder fell into captivity at Tunisia. The German command tended to \\"reform\\" lost units, and chose this unit designation for one of the new divisions that were being formed in France. Some 2,000 veterans from the Afrika Korps who had been sent home early to recover from wounds or disease were added to the unit to give it experience. Feuchtinger was able to garner a number of able unit commanders. Though Afrika veteran Fritz Bayerlein in command of the Panzer Lehr Division requested and was given Colonel Hans von Luck, when he arrived von Luck was transferred to 21st Panzer to serve as the panzergrenadier regiment commander for Feuchtinger.Luck 2006, pp. 165‚Äì166 Erwin Rommel discusses review of Feuchtinger's 21st Panzer Division. By May 1944 the reformed 21st Panzer was nearly fully equipped and stationed near Caen. Feuchtinger spent much of his time in Paris, ostensibly overseeing production of materials for his division, as Becker was using the Hotchkiss plant near Paris for his conversion facility.Luck 2006, p. 167 A second reason for his presence was that Paris offered many diversions, and was the residence of Feuchtinger's actress girlfriend. Invasion of Normandy Feuchtinger was in Paris at the time of the Normandy invasion. He returned to Normandy with his female companion on June 6, but commanded the division from the rear. He allowed his subordinate commanders a great deal of latitude in making decisions for their units. On August 1, 1944 Feuchtinger was promoted to lieutenant general. Shortly thereafter, on August 6, 1944, he received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Colonel von Luck, a commander of broad experience, ended up operating his armoured regiment through the entire campaign, from the Normandy landings through the breakout attempt of Operation Goodwood to the final devastation of the 7th Army in the Falaise pocket, with very little contact or direction from Feuchtinger.Luck 2006, pp. 171‚Äì227 Much of the 21st Panzer Division was caught in the Falaise Gap, but Feuchtinger managed to keep clear of the encirclement, telling von Luck: \\"From now on you are on your own.

Bring me back lots of men from our division.\\"Luck 2006, p. 207 Siegfried line Reformed and reinforced in Germany, the core of his division was involved in heavy fighting in Northern Alsace while Feuchtinger lived in Celle. His presence there brought the attention of the local citizens, who were aware that he was securing extra food supplies for his girlfriend and using his position to keep three officer friends of his out of combat. According to his former commander Hermann Balck he was also under suspicion of organizing a large scale insurance fraud on French territory, which culminated in the purchase of a whole private castle during the occupation. On January 5, 1945 Feuchtinger was arrested and charged with enrichment from Jewish wealth through illegal sale of furs, the withdrawal of officers from military service, misappropriation of Wehrmacht property and the release of military secrets to his South American mistress. He was imprisoned in Torgau in January 1945, and found guilty by a German military court. In consequence all orders and decorations were taken from him, his military rank was reduced to Kanonier (rank equivalent to private in the artillery), and he was condemned to death. On 2 March 1945 Hitler ordered that Feuchtinger should be pardoned and reinstated to the front. He was assigned to the 20th Panzer- Grenadier-Division as Kanonier. Feuchtinger deserted from this assignment. A search was begun for him on 12 April 1945 but was unsuccessful. Instead of going to the front, Feuchtinger appeared at his farmhouse near Celle. On 29 May 1945, he obtained a general's uniform and surrendered into British captivity. He went through several prison camps, including the British camp for German generals at Trent Park. His presence in the U.S. internment camp at Allendorf met with strong protests from the German officers being held there.  Post war activities  To his captors Feuchtinger was able to pass himself off as a victim of Nazi justice, and subsequently received an early release from the general board in 1946. After his return to Germany he worked as a representative for several companies before signing on at the Bremer Vulkan yard. There he worked trading in steel products for use in heavy industry. Involvement in espionage In May 1953 Feuchtinger was approached by a stranger at the Central Rail Station in Krefeld. The stranger was a KGB agent who showed Feuchtinger a military police document dated 12 April 1945. It is unclear exactly what the document was, but the threat of revealing it was able to elicit assistance from Feuchtinger. Feuchtinger was required to use his position to obtain and pass on information about German re-armament. For the next 7 years Feuchtinger provided Soviet military intelligence with classified information regarding the West German military, until his death from a stroke suffered in Berlin in 1960.

The Mapuche Conflict is the name given to the conflict originated from the claims of indigenist Mapuche communities and organizations to the States of Chile and Argentina. The activist in favor of the 'Mapuche cause' claim greater autonomy, recognition of rights, and the 'recovery' of land since the Chilean transition to democracy. The Mapuche conflict is a phenomenon mainly from Chile, but also from neighboring areas of Argentina. Demands revolve mainly around three themes: jurisdictional autonomy, return of ancestral lands, and cultural identity. The Mapuche conflict has generated debates that take place in different areas, from the legal discussion through the historiographic controversy about their status as indigenous peoples to the controversial use of the term of terrorist.Identidad y conflicto mapuche en los discursos de Longkos y Machis (IX Regi√≥n - Chile), por Jorge Araya Anabal√≥nConflicto mapuche y propuestas de autonom√≠a mapuche , por Javier Lavanchy Historian Gonzalo Vial claims that a \\"historical debt\\" exists towards the Mapuche by the Republic of Chile, whereas the Coordinadora Arauco-Malleco aims at a national liberation of Mapuches.Foerster, Rolf 2001.

The Mapuche conflict surfaced in the 1990s following the return of democracy.On the conflict before 1990 see Olaf Kaltmeier: Volkseinheit und ethnische Differenz. Mapuche-Bewegung und comunidades w√§hrend der Regierung Salvador Allende, in:Jahrbuch f√ºr Forschungen zur Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung, Heft III/2003 (German Language). The conflict started in areas inhabited mostly by Mapuches like the vicinities of Pur√©n, where some indigenous communities have been demanding that certain lands they claim for their own but which are now the property of logging and farming companies and individuals be turned over to them. Several Mapuche organizations are demanding the right of self-recognition in their quality of Indigenous peoples, as recognized under the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples by the General Assembly of the United Nations. The official 2002 Chilean census found 609,000 Chileans identifying as Mapuches. The same survey determined that 35 percent of the nation's Mapuches think the biggest issue for the government to resolve relates to their ancestral properties. The official 2012 Chilean census found the number of Mapuches in Chile to be 1,508,722. Historian Jos√© Bengoa has likened the Mapuche conflict to the Catalan struggle. Bengoa adds that both conflicts were major concerns for the 17th century Spanish Empire and remain unresolved. 1990-2009 1996‚Äì2004: Ralco controversy The building of the Ralco Hydroelectric Plant, Chile's largest hydroelectric power plant, in the 1990s was highly controversial among Mapuches and pro-Mapuche groups as it was to flood allegedly sacred land including one Mapuche cemetery. After compensations were paid the plant was finally finished in 2004.Electricity generation capacity of Chile by Comisi√≥n Nacional de Energ√≠a 2009 incidents Demonstration in Santiago, after the killing of two Mapuche activists. Numerous incidents such as violent land occupations, burning of private property and demonstrations have occurred in Araucania. In the wake of the recent deaths of a few of its activists, Mapuche organization Coordinadora Arauco-Malleco has played a key role by organizing and supporting violent land occupations and other direct actions, such as burning of houses and farms, that have ended up in clashes with the police. The government of Michelle Bachelet has said that it is not ready to contemplate expropriating land in the southern region of Araucania to restore lost ancestral territory to the Mapuche. The government set out to buy land for use by 115 Mapuche communities, however, according to government officials, the current owners have nearly tripled the prices they are demanding. On the other hand, the effectiveness of the government policy of buying and distributing land has been questioned. Two special presidential envoys were sent to southern Chile to review the increasingly fractious ‚ÄúMapuche situation‚Äù. 2010‚Äìpresent 2010 hunger strike Flag of the Mapuche-Tehuelche people created in 1991; symbol of their claim in some Argentine-Mapuche areas. Between 2010 and 2011, a series of hunger strikes by Mapuche community members imprisoned in Chilean prisons to protest against the conditions in which the proceedings against them took place, mainly due to the application of the antiterrorist law, and for the double prosecutions they were subject to, because parallel proceedings were carried out in the ordinary and military courts. The strikes began on July 12, 2010, with a group that was in preventive detention, some for more than one year and a half, all accused of violating anti-terrorism legislation. 2012 fires January 2013 events A march was held in commemoration of the death of Mat√≠as Catrileo held in Santiago in January 2013.

This may occur because the number has been physically misdialled, the number is simply incorrect, or because the area code or ownership of the number has changed. In North America, toll-free numbers are a frequent source of wrong numbers because they often have a history of prior ownership. In the United Kingdom, many misdialled calls have been due to public confusion over the dialing codes for some areas. Etiquette The recipient of a wrong number is usually unknown to the caller. This aspect has been used in social science experiments designed to study the willingness of people to help strangers, and the extent to which this is affected by characteristics such as race. This experimental method is known as the \\"wrong-number technique\\". Proper telephone etiquette recommends that the wrongly dialed party politely inform the caller of that fact, and also that the caller apologize rather than simply hanging up. Often the two parties will confirm whether or not the intended number is indeed the number that was reached (e.g. \\"Is this 555-0184?\\") before ending the call. It is widely considered \\"dangerous\\" for the called party to disclose their phone number ‚Äî rather it is considered more prudent to require the calling party to state which number he dialed and for the called party to simply confirm whether or not that is his number. Though this can also be considered irrelevant if a phone has a list of outgoing phone numbers it called, and/or already has the dialed number on the screen's display (whether they were intentional, or by accident) as many modern phones do, thus would unintentionally reveal what the falsely dialed phone number was anyway without the called party disclosing it too. Technical considerations On a landline, wrong numbers incur no toll for the recipient but do represent the annoyance of answering an unwanted call. This may be problematic for shift workers who are asleep during the day. On cellphones in countries where mobile plans charge for incoming calls, a wrong number may cost the subscriber one or more minutes. Sources of misdialled calls are similar to sources of typographical error: *Pressing one or more wrong keys on the keypad of the phone (example 2379 rather than 2349) *Pressing a key on the dialpad more times than appears in succession in the phone number, thereby completing the length of the number prior to completing the intended number (example 7522-7 with the final 7 being ignored rather than 7527) *Transposing digits in the phone number (example 3416 rather than 3146) Fictional numbers The use of local telephone numbers in mainstream fictional works is problematic as the number will often belong to one or more real subscribers in various other area codes. Well-known fictional numbers like 867-5309 (Jenny's number, from a popular 1982 song) and 776-2323 (God's number in the 2003 cinema release of Bruce Almighty) continue to receive misdialled calls years later. This is often avoided by using reserved or invalid numbers (such as 555 (telephone number)), or by displaying a real area code and number which belongs to the publisher of the fictional work. Emergency numbers Inadvertent calls to emergency telephone numbers are problematic as, if the dispatcher is uncertain of the nature of a presumed emergency, police are rapidly dispatched to the address on an enhanced 9-1-1 or 1-1-2 call. Most often, these calls tie up resources which need to be available for emergency response - especially if the caller is silent or disconnects the call without acknowledging the error. In Raleigh, North Carolina, a 2012 change which forced subscribers to dial the 919 area code on local calls caused a 20% increase in total calls to 9-1-1, a result of frequent misdials. Toll-free numbers Misdialled calls are problematic for toll-free telephone number subscribers, who must pay long-distance tolls to receive the calls and pay staff to answer misdirected enquiries. A small, local business whose toll-free number differs in one digit from a large national franchise will typically receive multiple misdialled calls daily. In some cases, commercial rivals have engaged in wilful typosquatting to profit from misdial traffic. If 1-800-HOLIDAY (+1-800-465-4329) is a well-known hotel chain, an unscrupulous vendor could register 1-800-H0LIDAY (+1-800-405-4329, the same number with 'o' replaced by 'zero'), resell bookings for rooms in the same or a rival hotel and collect a profitable travel agent's commission.86 F.3d 619, 65 USLW 2026, 39 U.S.P.Q.2d 1181: HOLIDAY INNS, INC. vs 800 RESERVATION, INC, Earthwinds Travel, Inc. and Call Management Systems, Inc, United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit. June 24, 1996. Some franchise chains have resorted to the defensive registration of complementary numbers, the commonly misdialled variants of their main number, as a defense against the typosquatters. A similar issue exists with toll-free number hoarding. One marketer can create multiple shell companies to operate as RespOrgs and register toll-free numbers as soon as their previous users disconnect service. Callers to millions of these numbers are connected not to the desired party but to an advertisement, such as the PrimeTel Communications promotions for costly phone sex numbers. By tying up millions of easily remembered numbers, these schemes force businesses to use overlay plan area codes or numbers without mnemonic phonewords. Deployment of multiple toll-free area codes further increases the probability of misdial calls as a common wrong number pattern is to call the +1-800- version of a number which is actually in another area code. In 2009, General Motors advertised +1-877-CLUNKER (1-877-258-6537) to promote a $3 billion U.S. federal \\"cash for clunkers\\" program. Judy Van Fossan of The Flower Corner in Clinton, Illinois, a tiny local shop which owned 1-800-CLUNKER (+1-800-258-6537), was inundated with more than 150 wrong numbers daily.1-800-Clunkers?

In popular culture A 1911 sheet music collection, You've Got The Wrong Number, But You've Got The Right Girl Misdialled calls serve as a plot device in 1948 film Sorry, Wrong Number, in television such as in the Dad's Army episode \\"Sorry, Wrong Number\\" and in the Seinfeld episode \\"The Pool Guy\\". They are also used on the Touch-Tone Terrorists prank call CD series. They also figure in the name of Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number top-down action game by Dennaton Games.

It is located at the eastern end of the ferry route across the Connecticut River, where ferries have been documented to run since 1769. The district includes six houses dating to the late 18th or early 19th century, as well as the site of the ferry slip. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. Description and history The lower Connecticut River was not bridged until the early 20th century. Settled in the mid-17th century, ferry services on the river were important for the movement of people and goods, and also acted as hubs for commerce. The first formal permit to operate a ferry between Hadlyme and Chester was issued in 1769 to Jonathan Warner, but some documents suggest that a ferry may have been run as early as the 1690s. The oldest of the buildings at the ferry was built in 1760; it is a typical Georgian house, to which a Federal style entrance surround was added in the late 18th or early 19th century. and The district extends from the ferry slip, up Connecticut Route 148 (Ferry Road) to its junction with Geer Hill Road. The terrain slopes upward from the river fairly steeply, leaving little room for development. The district is bounded on the north by Gillette Castle State Park. The six houses in the district were all built before 1820, and have either Federal or colonial Georgian style. One of the buildings may have served as a shop. The contributing properties include: *Samuel Brooks House, 151 Ferry Road, c. 1760, Colonial in form but with a \\"fine Federal doorway surround\\" *Isaac Spenser House, 162-1 Ferry Road, 1790, also Colonial in its 5 bay form, with a Federal style doorway including fanlight in doorway's pediment. *William Spencer House, 1805. *159 Ferry Road, c. 1800, gable-fronted. *Comstock House, 150 Ferry Road, c. 1820, gable-fronted, later Federal style house with a fanlight in its tympanum. *Ferry House, 162-2 Ferry Road, c. 1780. *Ferry slip site. Non-contributing structures in the district include four garages from early 20th century and assorted small buildings associated with the ferry. Note, unlike in some other historic districts around ferry sites, the course of the ferry itself is not included in the district.See, for example, Millersburg Ferry in Pennsylvania and Glastonbury ‚Äì Rocky Hill Ferry Historic District in Connecticut The modern ferry is regarded as a periodic intrusion into views of the historic district.

The fortifications were added to UNESCO's World Heritage List in late 2000 and are a popular tourist attraction. Description Walls The city walls were built between 263 and 276 A.D. to defend the Roman town of Lucus Augusti (present-day Lugo) against local tribesmen and Germanic invaders. The walls formed part of a complex of fortifications which also included a moat and an intervallum (the clearing between the walls and the city). The entire length of the walls is around , enclosing an area of 34.4 hectares. Not all of the town was enclosed by walls: much of the southeastern part of the town remained unprotected, while in other places unused areas were enclosed by walls.\\"Lugo City Walls in Lugo, Spain\\", Spain.info The width of the walls is around and their height varies between and . The walls consist of internal and external stone facing with a core of earth mixed with gravel, pebbles and worked Roman stone recycled from demolished buildings, cemented with water. Gates There are ten gates in the walls: five dating to Roman times; and five added after 1853 to accommodate the expanding town population. The best preserved original gates are the Porta Falsa and the Porta Mi√±a, the latter still has its original vaulted arch set between two towers. Five stairways and a ramp provide access to the parapet walk over the walls. Within the walls, a number of double staircases provide access to the towers from the parapet walk. Towers Of the original towers, 49 are still intact, and another 39 have partially survived. The towers were built at irregular intervals along the walls. They consist of two storeys and are mostly semicircular; a few are rectangular. The spaces between the towers varies from to . A mix of materials was used for the construction of the towers. Often the base of the tower was constructed of dressed granite, with the remainder in slate.

Three of the albums, Yola, Out There, and Love Must Be Tough, received the coveted Album of the Year Award from Hi-Fi+ Magazine. Early Hours was voted Best Contemporary Album 2004-2005 by Irish Music Magazine Readers Poll. The album includes Did I Hurt You and Isn't It A Little Late from McEvoy's double A-Side single which was the world's first single to be released on the on Super Audio Compact Disc SACD format. Singled Out is marked by McEvoy's unmistakable voice and her singular treatment of love, lust, and humour. It distinctively chronicles McEvoy's progression from a band format to a solo artist with a clear vision of her own music. Singled Out includes one new song, \\"Oh Uganda\\", which was written by McEvoy after her visit to Northern Uganda as part of her support for the work of Oxfam Unwrapped. Oxfam Ireland describes McEvoy's visit to the Kitgum region of Uganda saying, \\"McEvoy returned to Ireland following a week- long trip to Uganda with Oxfam Ireland. The Dublin musician experienced first hand the benefits of Oxfam Ireland Unwrapped, an initiative that sends meaningful presents like clean drinking water, schoolbooks and vegetable gardens to developing countries throughout Africa\\". Oh Uganda includes harmony vocals from Ugandan singer Florence Mutesasira. Critical reception In an era of homogenous, packaged artists who find a niche and cling on for dear life, McEvoy is constantly changing, genre, style and delivery. This album is sub-titled ‚ÄúThe Independent Singles‚Äù but could just as easily be called ‚ÄúFrom Yola to Uganda‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Greatest Should Be Hits‚Äù.

Biography Early life Charlie Winstead was born in Sherman, Texas on May 25, 1891. Before joining the FBI he engaged in various occupations, including decorated service with the US Army in World War I, working as a deputy sheriff in several Texas jurisdictions, and just before joining the Bureau, as a law clerk in the US Attorney's office in El Paso, Texas. He joined the Bureau in July 1926. As a member of the Dallas Field Office, Winstead took part in several unsuccessful manhunts targeting outlaws Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow, and played a key role in the manhunt for kidnapper George \\"Machine Gun\\" Kelly; along with Agent Gus Jones, Winstead arrested Kelly's associate Harvey Bailey in Rhome, Oklahoma, which set the FBI manhunt for Kelly in motion.Bryan Burrough, Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-1934, p. 90-91 John Dillinger In May 1934, Winstead and several other Western agents, including former Oklahoma City policemen Jerry Campbell and Clarence Hurt, were assigned to the Chicago Field Office to help apprehend John Dillinger and his gang of bank robbers. After the Little Bohemia fiasco in April, in which agents led by Melvin Purvis and Sam Cowley had killed a civilian and lost an agent in a failed ambush of Dillinger's gang, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover brought in the experienced Texans to augment Purvis's still-relatively inexperienced agents. Winstead is widely believed to have been the agent who fired the fatal shot into Dillinger during the FBI's ambush at the Biograph Theater, shooting him in the back of the head at close range.Burrough, p. 408 For this, he received a personal letter of commendation from Hoover. After Dillinger's death, Winstead helped track down Dillinger's former gang mate Lester Gillis/Baby Face Nelson, narrowly missing a confrontation with Nelson when he and Nelson drove past each other on a rural Illinois road. Winstead's encounter with the outlaw ultimately led to Nelson's showdown with the FBI outside Barrington, Illinois, in which both Nelson and Agents Cowley and Hollis were fatally injured.Burrough, 473-474 Later career Winstead returned west after Nelson's death, serving at the El Paso and Albuquerque offices. While in El Paso he took under his wing a rookie special agent named William C. Sullivan, mentoring him and helping to launch a career that would ultimately make him one of the top figures at FBI headquarters in Washington, DC.For the story of Sullivan and Winstead, see William C. Sullivan with Bill Brown, The Bureau: My Thirty Years in Hoover's FBI.\\" New York: W.W. Norton & Co., 1979; pp. 25-34. Sullivan later characterized Winstead as a man with a \\"naturally probing mind\\" which could readily \\"absorb, retain, and use information.\\"Sullivan and Brown, The Bureau,\\" p. 30. Although his formal education was minimal, the college-educated Sullivan remembered Winstead as \\"so well read that he stood out in sharp contrast to most men with college and graduate degrees, those who stopped learning when they left school.\\"Sullivan and Brown, The Bureau,\\" pp. 29-30. In an organization which demanded blind obedience to its iron-fisted leader, Winstead was privately dismissive of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, confidentially telling William Sullivan never to initiate a meeting with him for every reason, since the mercurial Hoover was known to end careers on the slightest pretext. He told Sullivan: > \\"If Hoover ever calls you in, dress like a dandy, carry a notebook, and > write in it furiously every time Hoover opens his mouth. You can throw the > notes away afterward if you like. And flatter him. Everyone at headquarters > knows Hoover is an egomaniac, and they all flatter him constantly. If you > don't, you'll be noticed.\\" Shortly thereafter in 1942 Winstead himself came under the spotlight's glare, earning Hoover's stern disapprobation for having insulted a female reporter and accused her of Communist sympathies.\\"Charles B. Winstead, Veteran FBI Agent, Ends Long Service,\\" Albuquerque Journal, Dec. 11, 1942, p. 11. Hoover demanded an apology and as punishment ordered Winstead's transfer to the Oklahoma City field office. Winstead instead refused this forced relocation, telling Hoover to \\"go to hell\\" and resigning on December 10, 1942 ‚Äî four years short of having accrued sufficient tenure for government retirement. According to Winstead, who told the story in a December 15, 1942 letter to Sullivan, he had made \\"perfectly proper statements...in a private conversation\\" in which he had \\"contradicted [the reporter's] statement that 'Russia is fighting our battles'\\" in the World War. Winstead's comment had been passed along to J. Edgar Hoover by the reporter, Winstead wrote, prompting an overreaction which \\"shocked\\" him. \\"I knew better than anybody that after doing my little bit from 1917 to 1920 to save the world for Democracy, and so many of the boys doing it again now, that I wasn't going so far as Oklahoma City as a penalty for exercising my rights of free speech,\\" Winstead declared.Sullivan with Brown, The Bureau, pp. 33-34. Life after the FBI After resigning from the FBI, he served as an Army intelligence and security officer in the later years of World War II. For a time, he was in charge of security at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project, when the first atomic bomb was being constructed by the US Army. Winstead returned to law enforcement after the war, serving various part-time jobs as a Sheriff's Deputy in New Mexico and a private investigator, before retiring and taking up horse ranching. In the 1950s, he began work on a memoir of his years with the FBI but never finished; the manuscript was discovered in 2008 and is now kept in a museum in Sherman. Death and legacy Winstead died on August 3, 1973, in the Albuquerque Veteran's Hospital of cancer.Sullivan with Brown, The Bureau, p. 33. He was 82 years old at the time of his death. In his will Winstead left his .357 Magnum sidearm, Stetson hat, boots, saddles, and rope to William C. Sullivan ‚Äî his former prot√©g√© who had rose through FBI ranks before himself coming to career grief at the hands of imperious FBI boss J. Edgar Hoover. Winstead was portrayed by actor Stephen Lang in Michael Mann's film Public Enemies (2009).

It was the alma mater of many people who grew up in the Great Depression and World War II and rose to prominence in the arts, literature, and other fields. In 2007, the New York City Department of Education closed the school and broke it into several small schools because of low graduation rates. History Thomas Jefferson High School, located at 400 Pennsylvania Avenue, had its groundbreaking in 1922 with New York City mayor John Francis Hylan officiating. Elias Lieberman (1883-1969), American poet, writer and educator, known for the 1916 poem \\"I Am an American,‚Äù served as principal from 1924 to 1940. Alumni of his time include movie star and comedian Danny Kaye. Thomas Jefferson was one of seven public high schools in New York to receive a M. P. Moller pipe organ in 1926 Under Lieberman. (In the 1990s, this organ was removed and discarded.) In 1991, Darryl Sharpe, a ninth- grade student who was an innocent bystander, was shot to death in the school. Another youth was trying to help his brother in a fistfight, drew a gun, and opened fire in the crowded hallway. The three shots killed the 16-year-old student and critically wounded a teacher, Robert Anderson, who was approaching to intervene. At the time, education officials in New York called it \\"one of the school system's worst crimes\\" and noted that besides an accidental shooting in 1989, it was the first killing of a student in a school in more than a decade. The 14-year old shooter, Jason Bentley, was sentenced to three to nine years in prison.List of school shootings in the United States#CITEREFCrews2016 Bentley was on parole for this homicide on June 22, 1997, when Luis Cabral Corcino was murdered in a robbery. Bentley was convicted of murder and was sentenced to 35 years to life.People v Bentley on Justitia In 1992, a 15-year-old student at the school shot two other students, who died thereafter, in the hallway an hour before then-mayor David Dinkins was supposed to tour the school. The shooter, 15-year-old Kahlil Sumpter, was sentenced to between 6‚Öî and twenty years in prison. He was released on parole in 1998. In 2007, the New York City Department of Education closed the school and broke it into several small schools because of low graduation rates. In the photograph above, the main entrance of TJHS is clearly engraved with a quote from Abraham Lincoln, \\"May reverence for the laws become the political religion of the nation.\\" For 90 years students, and perhaps faculty, have wondered why the authorities were unable to find an appropriate quotation from Thomas Jefferson himself to grace the entrance to his namesake school. Today Since 2007, the school building is known as the Thomas Jefferson Educational Campus, and is the home of: *The High School for Civil Rights *The FDNY High School for Fire and Life Safety *The Performing Arts and Technology High School *The World Academy for Total Community Health High School In 2015, two of the new schools were graduating about 70 percent of their students and the other two have graduation rates in the 50s. In New York City overall in 2015, just over 78 percent of New York State students who entered high school in 2011 graduated on time according to state officials. However, the percentage is 88 percent for white students and only 65 percent for black and Hispanic students during the same time period.

His most widely recognized photographs capture the look and aesthetic of music and celebrity personalities of the 1980s. His work with publications such as Circus magazine and FACES helped establish Mark \\"Weissguy\\" Weiss as a name known for rock photography. He has photographed a wide range of acts including the Rolling Stones, Kiss, Madonna and Wu Tang ClanArchives http://www.weissguygallery.com/archive/ Career Beginnings As a teenager, Weiss photographed live concerts without permission, and sold prints of his photographs to fans of the performers. In 1977 he was arrested for selling pictures of the band Kiss at one of their Madison Square Garden concerts in New York. His first nationally published work was a photograph of Aerosmith's Steven Tyler; a centerfold in the June 1978 issue of Circus. Soon thereafter, Weiss was hired as their staff photographer. 1980s Weiss quickly developed relationships with musicians and their managers, and became immersed in the burgeoning rock scene. He played an active role in creating the visual imagery of heavy metal and glam rock, as these styles of music began to gain radio airplay, eventually topping the charts and packing stadiums worldwide. Major acts and record labels contracted Weiss for photography and art direction, and many albums to which he contributed went on to multi-platinum sales. Weiss became tour photographer for numerous artists of the era, including Ozzy Osbourne, M√∂tley Cr√ºe, Poison, Metallica, Twisted Sister and others. His material is also syndicated internationally in books, magazines, and licensed merchandising. Influence Musicians Weiss has been credited with introducing Sebastian Bach to the band Skid Row. Bach's memorable performance at Weiss' wedding caught the notice of guitarist Dave Sabo, who consequently sent Bach a video of his band Skid Row performing, and arranged an audition. The band went on to make two multi-platinum selling albums with Bach as lead vocalist. Weiss is also responsible for introducing guitarist Zakk Wylde to Ozzy Osbourne. Upon discovering him through recommendation from Dave \\"face\\" Feld, Weiss gave Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne a tape recording and photograph of Wylde. As a family friend of the Osbournes, and trusted long-time photographer of Ozzy, Weiss recommended the then teen- aged Wylde to take the lead guitarist role recently vacated by Jake E. Lee. The Osbournes called Zakk, still living with his parents at the time, and arranged to fly him to Los Angeles and join Ozzy's band.

According to local archives, Ramsour found the Haupt Truss design in a book. Since the bridge was originally constructed as an open span, its 91 ft. roof wasn't added until 1900, and in 1921, its original wooden shingle roof was replaced with a tin roof. The bridge was owned by the Bolick family until 1985 when they donated it to the Catawba County Historical Association, who restored it in 1994.

Built in 1868, the building is one of the oldest surviving paper mill in the state. The mill was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 17, 1974. The building has been restored since the fire that took out the wooden building closest to Main St (Route 201) which the original foundation is now the parking lot and can still be seen, and is now a mixed-use commercial property, housing the Sea Dog Brewing Company among other tenants.http://www.mainepreservation.com/Endangered/bowdoinmill.shtml The Great Bowdoin Mill Description and history The Pejepscot Paper Company Mill stands on a point projecting southward into the Androscoggin River, just east of the bridge carrying US 201 between Topsham and Brunswick. It is a large three-story brick building, with a gambrel roof and a granite foundation. The short end facing the river is eight bays wide, each bay consisting of a recessed panel housing windows set in segmented-arch openings and topped by decorative arches. Near the center of the building, a five-story square tower rises to a shallow-pitch pyramidal roof. The mill was constructed in 1868 and was originally known as the Topsham Paper Mill. Its owners were hampered by a relatively poor location, and by legal problems with patent holders, and their venture failed. The property was auctioned in 1874, and reopened under new ownership as the Bowdoin Paper Manufacturing Company. Its owners expanded rapidly, and an empire that included as many as ten mills collapsed due to overextension in 1887. In 1998 the mill was included on the National Trust for Historic Preservation list of most endangered sites.http://www.preservationnation.org/travel-and-sites/sites/northeast- region/great-bowdoin-mill.html 11 Most Endangered It was later restored and currently houses the Sea Dog Brewing Company and a number of small businesses.

This involves a bisecting component that causes the bisecting line to appear longer than the line that is bisected. People often overestimate or underestimate the length of the bisecting line relative to the bisected line of the same length.de Montalembert, M., & Mamassian, P. (2010). The Vertical‚ÄìHorizontal Illusion in Hemi-Spatial Neglect. Neuropsychologia, 48(11), 3245-3251. . This even happens if people are aware that the lines are of the same length. Cross-cultural differences in susceptibility to the vertical‚Äìhorizontal illusion have been noted. People from Western cultures and people living in urban landscapes show more susceptibility than those living in eastern or open landscapes.Shiraev, E., & Levy, D. (2007). Cross-Cultural Psychology, Third Edition. Pearson Education, Inc., page 110 Types of vertical‚Äìhorizontal illusions There are several different configurations of the vertical‚Äìhorizontal illusion. The three configurations which seem to produce the highest illusion magnitude are the L configuration, the plus (+) configuration, and the inverted-T configuration. Of these three, the inverted-T configuration produces the highest illusion magnitude. When the bisecting line of the T illusion is configured horizontally, the illusion magnitude is lowered. However, when the bisecting line of the T illusion is configured vertically, the illusion magnitude is higher.Wolfe, U., Maloney, L.T., & Tam, M. (2005). Distortions of perceived length in the frontoparallel plane: Tests of perspective theories. Perception & Psychophysics, 67(6), 967-979. Development A gradual decrease in error of vertical‚Äìhorizontal illusions occur as participants age increases from eight to fourteen years.Winch, W.H. (1907). The Vertical-Horizontal Illusion in School Children. British Journal of Psychology II, 220-225. Gough and Meschieri attribute this decrease in error to the child's improved ability to detect and de-center their attention in a visual display, i.e. position their body differently to gain other perspectives.Gough, Harrison & Meschieri, Luigi (1971). Cross-Cultural Study of Age-Related Differences in Perceptual Acuity. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 37(1), 135-140. Children who showed greater personal independence, verbal articulation, and visual scanning ability were more effective and resourceful in their ability to gauge vertical‚Äìhorizontal illusions.Gough, Harrison & Meschieri, Luigi (1971). Cross-Cultural Study of Age-Related Differences in Perceptual Acuity. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 37(1), 135-140. Cross- cultural differences Cross-cultural differences in susceptibility to the vertical‚Äìhorizontal illusion have been noted in several studies. People living in developed urban cities show greater susceptibility than people living in rural areas.Mast, F.W., & Oman, C.M. (2004). Top-Down Processing and Visual Reorientation Illusions in a Virtual Reality Environment. Swiss Journal of Psychology, 63(3), 143-149. . An explanation could be that those in rural areas are more accustomed to living in round houses on flat plains, or scrubland. Rural inhabitants have more exposure to distance and living on plains than people living in highly developed, commercialized cultures. However, differences in the strength of the vertical-horizontal illusion or the related M√ºller-Lyer illusion for these groups are inconsistent at best.Robinson, J.O. (1972). The Psychology of Visual Illusion. Oxford, England: Hutchinson University Library. Hemispheric neglect Participants with hemispatial neglect had increased difficulty perceiving the equality of the lines on the vertical‚Äìhorizontal illusion, in comparison with those in the control group. Montalembert's study, among others, gives claim to the notion that we perceive these types of illusions utilizing the left hemisphere of our brain.Rasmjou, S., Hausmann, M., & G√ºnt√ºrk√ºn, O. (1999). Hemispheric Dominance and Gender in the Perception of an Illusion. Neuropsychologia, 37(9), 1041-1047. . Gender differences Gender differences have been found with regards to vertical‚Äìhorizontal illusions. Rasmjou's 1998 study found men to outperform women in perceiving the vertical‚Äìhorizontal illusion. The results of this variation could be from hemispheric asymmetries, and/or biological differences between men's and women's brains.Rasmjou, S., Hausmann, M., & G√ºnt√ºrk√ºn, O. (1999). Hemispheric Dominance and Gender in the Perception of an Illusion. Neuropsychologia, 37(9), 1041-1047. . Although women were found to have a higher illusion magnitude on vertical‚Äìhorizontal illusion tasks, this does not mean men are better judges of distance than women, as there has been minimal research on this topic. Additional research is needed to draw a significant relationship between illusion magnitude and real-world tasks. These differences could also be due to social learning differences between men and women. Functional applications Functional applications of vertical‚Äìhorizontal illusion exist. Elliot et al. studied the effects of the horizontal and vertical illusion, and how the perceived illusion can influence visuo-motor coordination, i.e. motor activity dependent on sight.Elliott, D.B., Vale, A., Whitaker, D., & Buckley J.G. (2009). Does My Step Look Big In This? A Visual Illusion Leads To Safer Stepping Behaviour. PLoS ONE 4(2): e4577. . The study specifically focused on how the perceived height of a step, manipulated by the vertical and horizontal illusion, influenced stepping strategy as shown in toe elevation during step clearance. Their results showed an increased toe elevation in conditions where an illusion was perceived, leading them to conclude that there was a correlation between visual illusion and visuo-motor coordination. This can be implemented in the real world by developing better safety strategies in places such as nursing homes.

David Cronenberg plays a cameo role as the local crime boss. The film features a vampire who is accidentally awakened after 25 years of sleep and starts to shyly make contact with the mortal world around him. As he interacts and begins to care for the people around him, he gets mixed up in their problems and they in his. Premise A vampire named Boya is awakened from his sleep by a golf ball. He has not been awake since 1969, and marvels at his new surroundings. He does not feed on humans but instead on rats and animals. He meets up with a cab driver who is in trouble with some criminals, and a female donut shop worker who gets stuck in the middle. Befriending them both, and slowly falling in love with Molly, they take on each other's problems. He tries to protect them, but also endangers them by drawing the attention of an ex-lover from decades past who hasn't stopped looking for him in 25 years. Cast  Production  Blood and Donuts was the first film to be produced by the Canadian Film Centre, and it was director Holly Dale's first narrative film. Dale had previously made her reputation in documentary films. Fellow director Vincenzo Natali served as a stand-in for Cronenberg and also provided storyboards.  Release  Blood and Donuts was released on home video on 4 October 1996.  Reception  Brendan Kelly of Variety wrote that the film fails to deliver on its premise, as Dale has trouble combining the horror and comedy elements. In a retrospective of Canadian horror films, Variety later called the film \\"critically acclaimed\\".  Awards and nominations  Blood and Donuts was nominated in 1996 for the Genie Awards in 3 categories: Best Achievement in Costume Design (Emma England), Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role (Helene Clarkson), and Best Original Screenplay (Andrew Rai Berzins).

Built in 1867 to a design by architect George M. Harding, it is, along with the adjacent Woodman Building and Thompson Block (both also Harding buildings), part of the finest concentration of mid-19th-century commercial architecture in the city. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Description and history The Rackleff Building is located in Portland's Old Port area, on the north side of Middle Street, west of Franklin. It is flanked on the left side by the Woodman Building, and is separated on the right from the Thompson Block by Church Street, a narrow side street. The building is three stories in height and roughly a parallelogram in shape, with a rounded section at the sharply angled corner with Church Street. The ground floor has a cast iron facade that is essentially the same as that of the Woodman building, but about one foot shorter. Piers of clustered narrow round columns support arches and an entablature. Windows on the upper levels are set in segmented-arch openings, with bracketed lintels and eared hoods that are joined by a stone stringcourse. The windows in the center of the Middle Street facade are more ornately decorated, and the building has a cornice with paired brackets, and bands of freestone hexagons and quatrefoils between. The Church Street facade has similar but simpler styling. The building was constructed in 1867, the same year the other two buildings went up. All were built in the wake of Portland's 1866 great fire. Harding, who came to Portland in 1858, played a major role in the rebuilding of the city's commercial district after that blaze.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 23, 1972. Description and history The Rackleff Building is located in Portland's Old Port area, on the north side of Middle Street, at its corner with Pearl Street. It is flanked on the east side by the Rackleff Building. It is a four-story masonry structure, built out of brick with stone and iron trim elements. The ground floor storefronts are articulated by iron pilasters and arches, while windows on the second and third floors are combined in groups of one, two, or three, under elaborate stone arches. Stone beltcourses highlight the bottom of these arches, and also the join the sills of the windows. The building is capped by a mansard roof in the Second Empire style, with paired brackets in the eaves, corner turrets, and elaborate dormers. The block was built in 1867 for the Woodman family after the 1866 fire devastated a large part of the city. It is one of three adjacent buildings designed by George M. Harding (the others are the Rackleff Building and the Thompson Block, further east on Middle Street), which comprise one of the city's finest blocks of period architecture. Of these, the Woodman Building is the most elaborate. The ironwork on the ground floor is a rare surviving work of a local foundry, the Portland Company.

Dise√±o del Rancho Estero AmericanoMexican Land Grants in Sonoma County History At the direction of Governor Jos√© Figueroa in 1835, Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo began construction of the Presidio of Sonoma to counter the Russian presence at Fort Ross. To extend the settlements in the direction of Fort Ross, Vallejo sent three men, Edward McIntosh, James Black (1810‚Äì1870), and James Dawson (‚Äì1843), in that direction. These three men came to California as sailors with Captain John B.R. Cooper, brother-in-law of General Vallejo. Black settled upon what is now known as Rancho Ca√±ada de Jonive, while Dawson and McIntosh settled upon Rancho Estero Americano. They formed a partnership to build a saw-mill on Salmon Creek, near the town of Freestone. The Russian-American Company left Fort Ross and sold it to John Sutter in 1841. The mill on Rancho Ca√±ada de Jonive operated until 1849, when they sold all the lumber they had and left for the gold mines. McIntosh and Dawson agreed to make application jointly to the Mexican government for the 2 square league grant known as the Rancho Estero Americano, to confirm the title given by General Vallejo. McIntosh went the capital in Monterey to get the necessary papers in 1839. When he returned, Dawson on examining the papers, found that they were made out only in the name of McIntosh. Well authenticated tradition says that when Dawson made this discovery, he sawed the house, in which McIntosh and Dawson had been living, in two parts, and removed his half to what would become Dawson's Rancho Ca√±ada de Pogolimi grant. Edward McIntosh, who never married, became alcalde of San Rafael. In 1849 Jasper O'Farrell bought Rancho Estero Americano from McIntosh. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho Estero Americano was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852,United States.

Besides the hundreds of farm ponds, crop rotations, crop residue management, and other soil saving practices farmers have established in the lake's drainage area, the lake is protected by a series of smaller sediment-control dams. Approximately immediately surrounding the lake was purchased by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and Van Buren County to be managed as a wildlife area. That management is helping to build on the number of wild turkey, deer, squirrel, geese, quail, rabbits, songbirds, and other wild animals. Habitat is also being developed for raccoon, fox, mink, muskrats, and bald eagles, among other wildlife. The Indian Creek Wildlife area is intended for public hunting, fishing, hiking, bird watching, cross country skiing, picnicking, nature study, primitive camping and other fun in the outdoors. Shimek State Forest is managed as a multiple-use area for timber products, wildlife habitat and recreation. The forest includes hiking trails and is available for public hunting. All those activities are available to the public at Lake Sugema and the Indian Creek Wildlife Area. The Iowa Department of Natural Resources and the Van Buren County Conservation Board are managing the lake, wildlife, and recreation areas.

It was designed by architect George M. Harding and constructed in 1867. Along with the neighboring Rackleff and Woodman Buildings (also Harding designs), it forms one of the best-preserved period commercial street views in the entire state. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 28, 1973. Description and history The Thompson Block is located in Portland's Old Port area, on the north side of Middle Street. It is flanked on the left side by the Rackleff Building, which stands across Church Street, and by a less ornate brick commercial building on the right, across a narrow alley. It is a 3-1/2 story brick building, roughly trapezoidal in shape, with a polychrome slate mansard roof providing a full fourth floor. The ground floor consists of an arcade of iron supports, forming arches over either display windows or recessed store entries. A stone entablature separates the ground floor from the next two floors. These floors are divided into six bays, articulated in a 1-1-2-1-1 pattern by stone piers, and each floor is also delineated horizontally by rusticated stone beltcourses above and below the windows. Windows on the second floor are paired round-arch windows with keystones, while third-floor windows have segmented-arch tops with stone hoods. Two of these are more ornate, rising into wall dormers that interrupt the bracketed and dentillated cornice. Dormers at the roof level have round- arch windows with keystoned and eared hoods. The block was built in 1867-68, in the wake of Portland's great 1866 fire. George M. Harding, who designed the Thompson Block and the adjacent Rackleff and Woodman buildings, played a major role in the rebuilding effort, and this trio of buildings represent some of his finest commercial work. Urban renewal of the 20th century resulted in the loss of a significant number of other period buildings, and this is one of the few places in the city where the typical rebuilt post-fire streetscape is to be seen.

Admired as a bravura performer and an innovative choreographer, he had a varied career that was broadly international in scope.Emma Manning (1993) \\"Prokovsky, Andr√©,\\" in International Dictionary of Ballet, edited by Martha Bremser, Detroit: St. James Press, vol. 2, pp. 1153‚Äì57, . Includes pertinent biographical details, a descriptive essay, and extensive chronologies of roles performed, 1957‚Äì1977, and works created, 1971‚Äì1992.  Biography  With George Balanchine and Melissa Hayden (Amsterdam, 1965) Born in Paris to Russian parents, Prokovsky began ballet training in his youth, studying with some of the leading teachers in Paris, including Lubov Egorova, Nora Kiss, Serge Peretti, and Nicholas Zvereff. At age fifteen, he made his stage debut with the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise in a 1954 production of Moli√®re‚Äôs Les Amants Magnifiques. He then danced in ballet troupes directed by Jeanine Charrat, Jean Babilee, and Roland Petit before joining the London Festival Ballet as a soloist in 1957. Despite his stocky physique, he had developed great technical control in his dancing and was capable of performing multiple pirouettes and high, soaring leaps. His astonishing virtuosity in the original cast of Anton Dolin's Variations for Four in 1957 and in Harald Lander's √âtudes in 1958 won him promotion to principal dancer. He quickly became a favorite of English audiences, dancing leading roles in The Nutcracker, Napoli, Swan Lake, and Don Quixote, among others. In 1960, Prokovsky left London to return to Paris, where he joined Le Grand Ballet du Marquis de Cuevas as principal dancer in a new production of The Sleeping Beauty. In 1963, he moved to America, having been invited by George Balanchine to join New York City Ballet. As a principal dancer in that company, he appeared in many Balanchine works, including Symphony in C, Scotch Symphony, Gounod Symphony, and Stars and Stripes. He created roles in two works by Jacques d'Amboise, The Chase (1963) and Irish Fantasy (1964), and in two works by Balanchine, Pas de Deux and Divertissement (1965), set to music of Delibes, and Brahms-Schoenberg Quartet (1966). In both new Balanchine works his partner was the brilliant Melissa Hayden, a leading ballerina of the company.George Balanchine (1984) Choreography by George Balanchine: A Catalogue of Works, New York: Viking Penguin, pp. 244‚Äì49. Throughout the early 1960s, Prokovsky also had many engagements as an international guest artist with ballet companies in Stuttgart, Rome, Belgrade, Zagreb, Zurich, Munich, Dallas, Washington, D.C., and other cities. One especially fortuitous invitation came in 1966 from PACT/TRUK Ballet in Johannesburg, South Africa, which wanted him for Prince Charming in a new production of Cinderella. The choreographer was to be Fran√ßoise Adret, with whom he had worked in London, and the ballerina was to be Galina Samsova, from London Festival Ballet, whom he had previously met in Marseille. The production proved successful, and dancing with Samsova suited Prokovsky very well, as her sparkling virtuosity matched his own.Claude Conyers (1966) \\"I Shall Remember Her Running,\\" Ballet Review (New York), vol. 1, no. 5, pp. 13‚Äì23. A personal account of Samsova and Prokovsky dancing in this production. He consequently quit New York City Ballet and, later in 1966, rejoined London Festival Ballet,Ren√©e Renouf (July 2002) \\"Galina Samsova,\\" interview, Ballet Magazine. where he continued his partnership with Samsova to great acclaim for some years. Prokovsky and Samsova married in 1972 and soon thereafter left London Festival Ballet to form their own company, the New London Ballet. A small troupe of only fourteen dancers, it toured Britain, Europe, Asia, South America, and the United States with a repertory including Prokovsky's first choreographic works. Among them were Bagatelles (1972; music, Beethoven), Vespri (1973; music, Verdi), Folk Songs (1974; music, Berio), Soft Blue Shadows (1975; music, Faur√©), and Faust Divertimento (1976; music, Gounod), created in collaboration with Samsova. The company, which typically received favorable reviews,John Percival and No√´l Goodwin (May 1974) \\"The Prokovskys and Friends: The New London Ballet's Season at Sadler's Wells,\\" Dance and Dancers (London), pp. 40‚Äì43. flourished for several years\\"The Prokovskys, Reforming and Refreshing: Andr√© Prokovsky and Galina Samsova Talk . . . about Past Aspirations and Future Hopes,\\" Dance and Dancers (London) (February 1977), pp. 24‚Äì27. but was forced to disband when it encountered dire financial problems in 1977. Thereafter, Prokovsky served as ballet director of the Rome Opera for two years and then devoted himself to choreography, particularly evening-length productions of familiar stories from literature or opera. He spent his last years as a freelance choreographer, staging his ballets for companies around the world. Divorced from Samsova in 1981, Prokovsky eventually remarried and settled near Beausoleil, a winter resort in southeastern France. In 2009, he died at home, of cancer, at age seventy.Jack Anderson (21 August 2009) \\"Andr√© Prokovsky, Dancer and Ballet Choreographer, Dies at 70,\\" New York Times.

Dise√±o del Rancho Ca√±ada de JoniveMexican Land Grants in Sonoma County History At the direction of Governor Jos√© Figueroa in 1835, Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo began construction of the Presidio of Sonoma to counter the Russian presence at Fort Ross. To extend the settlements in the direction of Fort Ross, Vallejo sent three men, Edward McIntosh, James Black (1810‚Äì1870), and James Dawson (‚Äì1843), in that direction. These three men came to California as sailors with Captain John B.R. Cooper, brother-in-law of General Vallejo. The Russian-American Company left Fort Ross and sold it to John Sutter in 1841. Black settled upon what would become Rancho Ca√±ada de Jonive, while Dawson and McIntosh settled upon Rancho Estero Americano. They formed a partnership to build a saw-mill on Salmon Creek, near the town of Freestone. The mill on Rancho Ca√±ada de Jonive operated until 1849, when they sold all the lumber they had and left for the gold mines. James Black (1810‚Äì1870) was born in Inverness, Scotland. He went sea at an early age, and came to Monterey in 1832. In 1842, when the Russians pulled out of California, Black had already left this frontier outpost to cut timber for John Cooper on his Rancho Punta de Quentin. In 1844, Black married Maria Agustina Sais (1828-1864), sister of Domingo Sais (1806-1853), grantee of Rancho Ca√±ada de Herrera. Black moved back to Rancho Ca√±ada de Jonive, where he received the two square league grant in 1845.

Migration history Around 2007, the number of Zimbabweans crossing the border into Zambia began to grow, rising as high as 1,000 per day from a previous average of sixty per day. By late 2007 and early 2008, there were roughly 10,000 Zimbabweans in Zambia. Numbers spiked sharply that year, as 25,000 Zimbabweans formerly living in South Africa fled across two borders to Zambia as a result of the May 2008 riots, ignoring a call by Robert Mugabe to return to their homeland. However, by the end of the month, only three had formally applied for political asylum. UNHCR estimated that a further 200 Zimbabweans were crossing into Zambia every day. The influx countered the trend of decreasing numbers of refugees in Zambia; the total numbers had fallen from 300,000 in the 1990s (the vast majority being Angolans, as well as Rwandans and Congolese) to around 113,000 due to repatriations. Zambia also granted political asylum to twelve members of the Zimbabwean opposition party Movement for Democratic Change in advance of the second round of voting in the 2008 Zimbabwean presidential election. There was a thirteenth member of their group who was not granted asylum. The large number of border crossers led to long queues at checkpoints near Victoria Falls as early as August 2007. The 2008‚Äì2009 Zimbabwean cholera outbreak led to further delays due to Zambian authorities' need to screen border-crossers for the disease. Employment Cross-border trade Many Zimbabweans in Zambia engage in shuttle trade, bringing products such as game meat, fruit, sweets, and mobile phones for sale. Zimbabweans living in the border area also cross Lake Kariba into Zambia in search of food, selling or bartering chickens for mealie meal. Zimbabwean cross-border traders who buy mealie meal in bulk in Zambia and then bring it back to Zimbabwe for sale have been blamed for food shortages in border areas. White farmers Among Zimbabweans who have moved to Zambia are a small number of white Zimbabwean farmers, whose numbers had reached roughly 150 to 300 people . They farm a variety of crops including tobacco, wheat, and chili peppers on an estimated 150 farms. The capital they brought, combined with general economic liberalisation under the late Zambian president Levy Mwanawasa, has been credited with stimulating an agricultural boom in Zambia. In 2004, for the first time in 26 years, Zambia exported more corn than it imported. Zambia was considered the \\"easy option\\" for Zimbabwean farmers as compared to other potential destinations such as Malawi or Nigeria due to the close resemblance between the soil and climate of Zambia and that of Zimbabwe, as well as Zambia's relative stability; however, farmers who relocated to Zambia typically took on heavy debts denominated in Zambian kwacha while selling their produce abroad for U.S. dollars, which put them into difficulties when the kwacha appreciated almost one-third against the dollar in 2006. Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe harshly criticised his Zambian counterpart Levy Mwanawasa for taking in the white farmers, whom he called \\"racist colonialists\\". Zambian agricultural minister Mundia Sikatana offered praise to the Zimbabwean farmers for training up locals, but implicitly warned them against racism, reminding them that \\"they have got to take their Zambian employees for what they are, human beings.\\" Other The poor economy in Zimbabwe has also led foreign tourists hoping to see Victoria Falls to approach it from the Zambian rather than the Zimbabwean side. This has led to further tensions as Zimbabweans who formerly worked in tourism-related industries on their own side of the border have crossed over to the Zambian side and compete directly with their Zambian counterparts. The Zambian government has also expressed concern about the increasing numbers of Zimbabwean sex workers in the capital Lusaka. Other Zimbabweans working as street vendors or in other lines of employment report that they increasingly stereotyped as sex workers and subject to public opprobrium. In June 2009, the Zambian government was also pursuing a plan to bring in Zimbabwean nurses as invited guest workers, but faced a strike brought by local health care workers over the issue. The government threatened to fire all the strikers.

To extend the settlements in the direction of Fort Ross, Vallejo sent three men, Edward McIntosh, James Black (1810‚Äì1870), and James Dawson, in that direction. These three men came to California as sailors with Captain John B.R. Cooper, brother-in-law of General Vallejo. Black settled upon what is now known as Rancho Ca√±ada de Jonive, while Dawson and McIntosh settled upon Rancho Estero Americano. They formed a partnership to build a saw-mill on Salmon Creek, near the town of Freestone. The Russian-American Company left Fort Ross and sold it to John Sutter in 1841. The mill on Rancho Ca√±ada de Jonive operated until 1849, when they sold all the lumber they had and left for the gold mines. McIntosh and Dawson agreed to make application jointly to the Mexican government for the two square league grant known as the Rancho Estero Americano, to confirm the title given them by General Vallejo. McIntosh went the capital in Monterey to get the necessary papers in 1839. However at that time, the Mexican authorities did not like making grants to multiple owners. When McIntosh returned, Dawson on examining the papers, found that they were made out only in the name of McIntosh. Tradition has it that when Dawson made this discovery, he sawed the house, in which McIntosh and Dawson had been living, in two parts, and removed his half to what would become Dawson's Rancho Ca√±ada de Pogolimi grant. In June 1840, James Dawson married 14-year-old Mar√≠a Antonia Cazares (also spelled Caceres and Caseres), born the daughter of a Spanish sergeant of dragoons in 1826. Dawson continued to reside on his rancho with his wife until his death in October 1843. The Rancho Ca√±ada de Pogolimi grant was made to his widow, Mar√≠a Antonia Cazares (1826‚Äì1880) in February 1844. Mar√≠a Antonia Cazares de Dawson married Frederick Gustavus Blume (1815‚Äì1890), a Sonoma, California physician, surgeon and merchant, in November 1847. Blume was born in Bautzen, Kingdom of Saxony in 1815, and first traveled to California in late 1842. From Sonoma, Blume put his brother-in-law Henry Hagler in charge of his wife's rancho for the winter. The Blumes moved from Sonoma to live on the rancho in 1848, on a prominence overlooking the town of Freestone. The town of Bloomfield, located on the rancho, was named in honor of Blume. Though not an American citizen at the time, Blume was elected to the first Territorial Legislature which met in San Jose, California in 1849. Blume was appointed postmaster of Freestone in 1870, and justice of the peace in 1873.J. P. Munro-Fraser, 1880,History of Sonoma County, Alley, Bowen & Co., San Francisco With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored.

It forms the Shihmen Reservoir (), Taiwan's third largest reservoir or artificial lake. It provides irrigation in Taoyuan, flood control for the Taipei Basin, and hydroelectricity and domestic water supply for more than three million people in northern Taiwan. Completed in 1964 after nine years of construction, Shihmen was Taiwan's first multi- purpose water project and a major step towards the island's economic independence after World War II. Year-round water releases from the dam enabled additional rice harvests and doubled Taoyuan's annual agricultural output, while the reservoir became a major tourist destination due to its scenic beauty and plentiful fisheries. However, the project was criticized for its high cost and its impact on local communities, as more than 2,000 people were displaced to make way for the reservoir. Like many other reservoirs in Taiwan, Shihmen has suffered from sedimentation, reducing its capacity by over a third. Efforts to reduce the rate of sediment accumulation, including dredging, check dam construction and watershed restoration work, have had a limited effect. This has diminished both the Shihmen Dam's capability to contain floods and provide water during droughts. History Background The Dahan River is the main river in northwestern Taiwan and is one of two tributaries that join in Taipei to form the Tamsui, Taiwan's largest river system. Originating in the Xueshan Range, the river begins life as a fast- flowing mountain stream prone to flooding during typhoons. The Dahan skirts, but does not cross, the Taoyuan Plateau, which lacks a reliable water supply of its own. The plateau has been farmed since 1680 using thousands of artificial ponds to capture rainfall;http://rice.iuav.it/318/1/CHANG_DAOMING.pdf in 1928, when Taiwan was under Japanese rule, the Taoyuan Canal was dug to divert water from the Dahan (then known as the Takekan River) onto the plateau. River water enabled the irrigation of an additional of land in the Taoyuan area. Due to the limited storage capacity of the small Taoyuan ponds, there was often not enough water for irrigation in the November‚ÄìApril dry season, demonstrating the need for a large reservoir. A dam at the \\"stone gates\\" (Shihmen), a deep canyon formed where the Dahan river exits the mountains, was proposed as early as 1938, but plans were dropped at the beginning of World War II with the strain on industrial resources. After the war, the Republic of China was faced with food shortages and a rapidly increasing population. By the 1960s, the annual population growth had reached 350,000. In order to improve its economic self- sufficiency, the government initiated the construction of Shihmen Dam, Taiwan's first multi-purpose water project. The Shihmen Development Commission was established to oversee the project. The initial budget for the dam was NT$1.4 billion, with approximately half of that as low-interest aid loans from the United States through the Agency for International Development. Construction Shihmen Dam site before construction, looking upstream at the \\"stone gates\\". Starting in July 1955, access roads and worker facilities were constructed at the dam site, and the area of the future reservoir was prepared to accommodate flooding. About 2,000 people (416 families) living in the Dahan River valley would be displaced by the project; they were relocated starting in 1956 to areas along Taiwan's northwest coast. Although the government built new homes, schools and other infrastructure as well as providing land compensation to families, the resettlement programme was the subject of bitter controversy. The dam was designed by Tippetts-Abbett- McCarthy-Stratton, with construction overseen by Morrison-Knudsen (known previously for its work on Hoover Dam). Heavy construction began in late 1959 when large equipment arrived at the dam site. Although work was interrupted several times by typhoon flooding, the river was successfully diverted into a tunnel in December 1960. The concrete cofferdam, later to serve as the core of the dam, was finished in 1962; notably, it was the first use of roller- compacted concrete in dam construction. About of nearby farmland were purchased by the government to provide of earth and rock needed to build the dam. With the dam only partially complete in May 1963, the diversion tunnel was plugged, allowing the reservoir to begin storing water. In July 1963, Typhoon Wendy struck Taiwan, causing massive flooding; the new reservoir was able to reduce the flood crest on the Dahan River by 25 percent. The embankment was topped out in June 1964, at a final cost of NT$ 4.85 billion. The dam was dedicated on June 14, 1964 by Vice President Chen Cheng, to a crowd of more than four thousand people. A total of 7,500 people were employed in the construction of the dam, with as many as 6,000 workers on the site at one time. Thirty-two people were killed during construction; out of 2,881 injured, 87 were left permanently disabled. Later history The spillway, nearing completion in 1964 Engineers estimated that the natural sedimentation rate would give the reservoir a useful life of at least 71 years without any sediment removal. However, just four months after the reservoir began filling, Typhoon Gloria struck Taiwan, and the resulting floods washed 19 million cubic metres (670 million ft3) of sediment into the reservoir ‚Äì taking 23 years off its expected lifespan. As the reservoir filled, it also inundated several historic landmarks, including the former summer villa of Chiang Kai-shek, the Amuping Stone Bridge and a nearby Earth God shrine. Irrigation was the primary goal of the Shihmen reservoir; about of new farmland came into production after the dam was built, bringing the total to . The annual crop was more than doubled due to an increased water supply for pre-existing farmland. Individual farmers' income rose by almost 20 percent. About of canals were added to the existing irrigation system, including the new Shihmen Canal, bringing the total to , and a treatment plant with 30,000 tons per day capacity was constructed to provide municipal water supply. Despite the scale of the project, the increase in agricultural production was estimated to feed 500,000 people, or less than two years of population growth. The importance of the dam for irrigation has been decreasing since the 1990s as Taoyuan County saw significant urbanization; in the meantime, demand for cleaner domestic water has risen. The government allocated NT$21 million to develop the Shihmen Reservoir as a recreational area. Boating facilities and about of new roads were constructed to improve access to the reservoir. The reservoir would also be stocked with game fish, and its shores would eventually be developed with \\"temples, museums, monuments, pagodas, hostels and residences.\\" After the dam was completed, it brought prosperity via tourism to this rural area, helping to diversify its economy from one solely reliant on agriculture. However, due to the project's high capital cost, the actual annual return on investment was only 1.5 percent: \\"It stands as an engineering monument of which the Chinese people may be proud. But it was purchased at far too high a cost in terms of tens of millions of dollars of alternative developmental opportunities foregone.\\" Dam details View from a nearby mountain, showing the main dam (center) and spillway (lower left). Embankment and spillways Shihmen Dam is a rolled rockfill embankment dam high and long, constructed over a high concrete core. The main body of the dam contains some 7.06 million cubic metres (9.23 million yd3) of material. At the crest, the dam is wide, with an elevation of above sea level. The normal water level is , with a maximum flood level of . The concrete spillway is located to the east of the dam and is controlled by six radial gates, each high and wide. The maximum water release is . There is also a river outlet works used for normal releases, with a capacity of . The dam also has two additional flood tunnels which were completed in 1978, in order to allow faster evacuation of reservoir storage prior to typhoons. Each tunnel is long, in diameter, with a combined capacity of . Power station View across the spillway showing Shihmen Power Station The dam's hydroelectric power station is located on the left bank of the Dahan River at the base of the dam. Two steel diameter penstocks, each long, feed water to two Francis turbines. The maximum water flow through the power plant is . Each generator has a capacity of 45,000 kilowatts (KW), for a total capacity of 90,000 KW. The plant produces about 200 million kilowatt hours per year. Reservoir The impounded water behind the dam forms Shihmen Reservoir, one of Taiwan's largest reservoirs with a length of and more than of water at full pool. The reservoir had an original total capacity of , with an active or useful capacity of . Sedimentation reduced the total storage capacity to by 1997 ‚Äì a nearly 20 percent reduction ‚Äì and the active capacity was decreased to . As of a 2017 study, the total capacity had been reduced to . The Shihmen afterbay reservoir, located below the main dam, regulates the water release into the Dahan River and provides the intake point for the Taoyuan and Shihmen Canals. The afterbay is formed by a long weir and can store up to . The headworks for the Taoyuan Canal have a capacity of , and the Shihmen Canal can carry up to . Operations and usage Water from Shihmen Dam is distributed to 28 districts in Taoyuan City, Hsinchu County and New Taipei, with a combined population of some 3.4 million people and more than of irrigated land. Each year, Shihmen furnishes 181.6 million m3 (147,200 acre feet) of water for irrigation and industrial uses and about 127.4 million m3 (103,300 acre feet) for residential use in downstream areas. In addition, an annual minimum river release of 299.6 million m3 (242,900 acre feet) is maintained to provide a baseflow in the lower Dahan River. About 386.3 million m3 (313,200 acre feet) of the aforementioned releases are utilized for hydroelectric generation. The dam's power station generates roughly 200 million kilowatt hours annually and is integral in meeting peaking power demands in northern Taiwan's electricity grid. Hydroelectric power releases peak in late July and August, largely because of air-conditioning usage in Taiwan's northern cities. Shihmen is one of several key reservoirs in the Tamsui River system used to cut peak flood flows during typhoon events. Dam releases are coordinated with those from Feitsui Dam to the east in order to reduce the severity of flooding. However, sediment accumulation in the reservoir has reduced its effectiveness on large flooding events. As a result, the \\"frequency with which the Shih-men Dam discharges water down its spillway ranks first among Taiwan's reservoirs. The phrase 'the Shihmen Reservoir is releasing flood water' has become a euphemism for 'your fly is open'.\\" Additionally, large flooding events can cause turbidity levels in the reservoir to increase by over 3,000 times of average, forcing authorities to shut down water supplies. This problem has been exacerbated by the increasing percentage of Shihmen water going to residential and industrial users, who generally demand clearer water than the agricultural users Shihmen was originally intended to supply. Flood release in June 2017 The reduction in storage capacity has also affected Shihmen's ability to provide water during droughts. Demand often exceeds stored water in Shihmen Reservoir during the dry season, forcing frequent water-supply cuts. For several weeks in 1994, the drought-stricken Shihmen Dam service area was limited to one day of running water in three. This has been further exacerbated by global climate change reducing the length of the rainy season in Taiwan, while increasing the intensity of rainfall when storms do strike the island. In 2015, Taiwan recorded its lowest winter rainfall since 1947, and the Shihmen reservoir fell to a record low of 24.5 percent of capacity, again forcing the government to enact water rationing. Among the other benefits of the dam and reservoir is recreation. More than 160,000 tourists visit the dam each year, especially during floodwater releases. The reservoir, its surrounding recreation area and towns are visited by a further 1.7 million people each year. It is said that \\"after its grand opening to the public in 1964, the Shihmen Reservoir has remained one of the top spots on Taiwan's sight-seeing billboards\\". Recreational and commercial fishing on the reservoir produces about of fish each year, generating an annual revenue of NT$29.33 million. Environmental issues Shihmen Reservoir Poor land use and construction practices in the catchment area of Shihmen Dam have contributed to a severe sedimentation problem in the reservoir. This sediment mainly comes from landslides and other erosion-related issues in the steep, rugged drainage basin, which have been exacerbated by deforestation, land-clearing for agriculture, and the opening of roads into mountainous areas. The reservoir, which originally had a maximum depth of over , is estimated to be no more than deep today. The textbook The Hydraulics of Open Channel Flow by Hubert Chanson describes the dam as having \\"become a vast sediment trap with an inappropriate storage capacity to act as a flood control or water supply reservoir.\\" In 1981 it was estimated that 2.9 million tonnes of sediment flow into the reservoir each year, or a watershed erosion rate of 3,789 tonnes/km2. According to a 2017 Taipei Times report, the amount of sediment flowing into the reservoir was 3.42 million tonnes per year. About 1.17 million tonnes were sluiced through the dam's outlets and another 900,000 tonnes were removed by excavation and dredging. The government has proposed to construct a sediment bypass tunnel, which would prevent another 640,000 tonnes from entering the reservoir. This technology has already been employed at reservoirs in Japan and Switzerland, and would essentially allow river water to be diverted around the reservoir instead of flowing into it during periods of high sediment runoff, such as after typhoons. Sediment prevention projects The destroyed Baling Dam, showing severe riverbed erosion typical in the watershed A number of measures have been taken to try and reduce the amount of sediment flowing into Shihmen Reservoir. Because of the construction of hundreds of sediment-trapping dams or sabo dams, the upper reaches of the Dahan and its tributaries are now among the most heavily impounded river systems in Taiwan, with at least 123 such dams along the main stem alone. The largest 24 sabo dams have collectively prevented some 36 million cubic metres (29,200 acre feet) of sediment from reaching Shihmen Reservoir. Only one, the Junghua Dam, is still collecting sediment, although its 16 million cubic metre (13,000 acre foot) capacity is nearly full. These sediment catching dams have also failed on several occasions causing even more debris and silt to wash into Shihmen. Among these was the failure of Baling Dam during Typhoon Wipha (2007), which caused 10 million cubic metres (8,000 acre feet) of sediment to wash downstream, destroying the village of Baling. Dredging efforts on Shihmen Reservoir have also been only partly successful. Beginning in 1985, seven dredging companies removed more than 10 million cubic metres (8,000 acre feet), but the reservoir continued filling with sediment faster than it could be excavated. The capacity of the silt disposal areas was exhausted in 1995. Other measures taken to decrease sediment flow include the construction of retaining walls and the reforestation of clear-cut areas. In more recent years, the Taiwanese government has revived the idea of constructing more mega-dams in the Dahan River to increase water retention capacity and trap silt. The Gaotai Reservoir (È´òÂè∞Ê∞¥Â∫´) near the indigenous community of Jianshi would consist of a dam high with a 171 million cubic metre (139,000 acre-foot) storage capacity. This project could be built in conjunction with the Bilin Reservoir (ÊØîÈ∫üÊ∞¥Â∫´) which would divert some water from the Dahan drainage to the Da'an River, increasing the water supply available for Hsinchu County. The dam projects have been strongly criticized as an expensive, yet only marginally effective solution to the problem, and for their effects on local communities. Water quality The large amount of sediment flowing into the reservoir has also caused unusually high nutrient levels, which leads to frequent eutrophication and algae blooms in the summer. As a result, Shihmen is often considered to be among the worst in water quality among all Taiwan's reservoirs. A large water- quality monitoring system is in place, installed circa 2005 at two points in Shihmen Reservoir. Called \\"Vertical Profiling System\\" or \\"YSI 6600EDS\\", the system measures a series of water quality factors by depth at intervals of . The turbidity, chlorophyll content, pH level, and dissolved oxygen levels in the reservoir are sent to the operator of the dam every three hours. A future plan for the system is to record algae growth, allowing action to be taken to prevent hypoxic events in the water. In 2008, the Taiwanese Environmental Protection Agency allocated NT$200 million for eutrophication control projects at Shihmen, Feitsui, Zengwun and Kinmen Reservoirs.

He played college football at the University of Iowa. Early years Jensen attended Davenport Central High School where he was a multiple state champion in track and field, winning the indoor high and low hurdles, the pentathlon, the outdoor high hurdles and was a member of the state champion mile medley relay team. He accepted a football scholarship from the University of Iowa. Measuring 6' 3\\", 230 lbs. and running a 4.4 40-yard dash, he earned eight varsity letters, four in football and four in track and field. In football, he was the team's leading rusher as a sophomore and junior, finishing his career with 367 carries for 1,661 rushing yards (4.5-yard avg.) and 9 touchdowns. In track, he competed as a hurdler. In the 1975 Senior Bowl, he played fullback and was the game's leading rusher. In 1988, he was inducted into the Iowa High School Sports Hall of Fame and to the Quad Cities Sports Hall of Fame in 2002. Professional career Dallas Cowboys Jensen was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the second round (40th overall) of the 1976 NFL Draft. As a rookie, he played mainly on special teams, and because of his versatility and size, he was moved between running back and tight end. In 1977, he became expendable when Tony Dorsett was drafted, so he was traded to the Denver Broncos in exchange for a sixth round draft choice (#160-Mike Salzano), after never having a rushing attempt with the Cowboys. Denver Broncos Jensen was a versatile running back for the Denver Broncos and helped the team reach Super Bowl XII in 1977, playing against his former teammates. In 1978, he was placed on the injured reserve list with a knee injury. He led the team in rushing (476 yards) and receptions (49) in 1980. The next year, he was released before the season started. Green Bay Packers On September 9, 1981, he signed as a free agent with the Green Bay Packers, to be the backup for Gerry Ellis and to play special teams. On September 7, 1982, he was released. On September 13, one day after the Packers defeated the Los Angeles Rams in their season opener, he was re- signed to replace an injured Ellis. With Bart Starr as the head coach, in 1982 the Packers made their first appearance in the playoffs after a 10-year drought. On April 15, 1983, he announced his retirement. Personal life Following his retirement from the National Football League, he made his home in Colorado and entered the advertising/marketing/public relations field. He has three children: Jessica, Cody and Jack, one grand daughter, Savannah, and one brother, Andy. He currently lives in Minnesota at Rose Lake near Vergas, and is a consultant for advertising, public relations, communications, marketing and special events projects. He also is a corporate motivational speaker and paints, writes and pursues life adventures in his spare time. Jensen is an avid motorcyclist and enjoys traveling into MX and to other off- the-beaten-path places. He also enjoys fly tying and fly fishing for warm water species, upland bird hunting, archery and running. He created the annual Run 'Round the Rose 12 Mile Run for Diabetes in Vergas, MN in honor of his mother, Lois, who had adult onset diabetes for her entire adult life. He has competed in this race since its inception and finished third in the Masters category in 2009. He also is an accomplished, and published, photographer, columnist and artist. He has written for the Rocky Mountain News, Greeley Tribune, WindsorNOW! and Thunder Press magazine. He credits a lot of his accomplishments in life to the influence of several key people: his father, John, a World War II veteran and son of a Danish immigrant, his high school coaches Jim Fox and Ira Dunsworth, Broncos head coach Red Miller, [assistant coach Paul Roach, and Bill Reichardt (University of Iowa Big Ten MVP running back in 1951).

It begins the story of Zelda the Great, a magician whose fading career has led her to crime. The story concludes in \\"A Death Worse Than Fate.\\" Plot synopsis For the third consecutive April Fools' Day, someone has robbed the Gotham City National Bank of exactly $100,000, passing up the chance to take other money worth nearly a half million dollars from the same vault. In two years, the Gotham Police Department has gotten nowhere with the case, leading Chief Miles O'Hara and Commissioner Gordon to call in the one man who can solve the mystery: Batman. Batman and Robin have no leads, so he determines the right course of action is to manufacture a lead. He phones the Gotham paper and plants a story that the cash taken from the Gotham City National Bank was counterfeit, held there until authorities could destroy it. He hopes to force the criminal to strike again. Meanwhile, he analyzes a bullet found at the scene and discovers from it that the thief was wearing orange wool and dozens of colorful silk scarves. From a smear of ambergris he concludes that the criminal was a woman. Meanwhile, in the secret workshop of Eivol Ekdol, behind the Gnome Bookstore, Eivol's client Zelda the Great meets with him. Each year she purchases, for $100,000, a new trick to re-invigorate her fading act. (\\"Oh, I hate robbing banks.\\" she complains \\"All I ever wanted to be was poor, but honest magician.\\") This year, Ekdol has prepared a clever escape proof cabinet, but when Zelda asks how to escape it, he informs her that she won't even get into it unless she can produce $100,000 in real money. He shows her a newspaper article reporting that the Star of Sammarkand, a rare emerald, will be displayed. It is a tempting target and Zelda realizes this is a \\"Batman trap\\". At Wayne Manor, Aunt Harriet Cooper receives a phone call from Miss Smith, a playground matron. It seems her fifteen-year-old nephew Dick Grayson has been struck in the head by a baseball and she has sent a special taxi to collect Mrs. Cooper and drive her to the playground. At the jewelry salon, an elderly woman approaches the Star, and with a quick tap of her cane, releases a cloud of gas. It is Zelda in disguise and she has escaped with the Star. The stone is a counterfeit, and equipped with a homing device. Batman contacts Officer Clancy nearby and asks him to uncover the Batmobile. But outside, Robin finds the false stone in a gutter. Zelda's appearance here was a ruse. Then Batman receives a threatening phone call. It seems someone has kidnapped Aunt Harriet and demanded $100,000 for her safe release. And as Commissioner Gordon continues, no one can find Bruce Wayne. It then shows Aunt Harriet at Zelda's hide out encased in a straitjacket suspended over a vat of boiling oil. Cliffhanger Text :HOLY BACKFIRE'S RIGHT! :AUNT HARRIET HAS JUST ONE HOUR! :WHAT'LL IT BE?? :SPLASH OR SALVATION?? :HOLD A HOPEFUL BREATH FOR AUNT HARRIET UNTIL TOMORROW.. SAME BAT-TIME!! SAME BAT-CHANNEL!! (This is the first time the phrase ‚ÄúSame Bat-Time!! Same Bat-Channel!!‚Äù appears in written form, though it was spoken in Episode 5.) Notes * When Batman tells Commissioner Gordon to be on the lookout for a female suspect, Gordon seems shocked at the thought of a criminal being a female although Robin had mentioned Catwoman only seconds earlier. * Robin's reference to the Catwoman marks the character's first mention in the series; Julie Newmar, however, would not make her first appearance as Catwoman for another 11 episodes. * It seems odd that Commissioner Gordon would have O'Hara turn on the Bat-Signal before he'd even tried the Batphone, as he couldn't have known Batman wouldn't be near his phone before he called. Though not the series' first reference to the Bat- Signal, it is the first time the Signal is used in concert with the hotline. * For the first time, Batman and Robin are not part of the cliffhanger at the end of this episode; it is Aunt Harriet who is left hanging over a fire. * This was Anne Baxter's first appearance on the show but her only one as Zelda. She later would appear in the final season as Egghead's paramour Olga, Queen of the Cossacks. * Zsa Zsa Gabor and Bette Davis were considered for the role of Zelda. Gabor eventually wound up playing Minerva in the 1968 series Batfinale, \\"Minerva, Mayhem and Millionaires\\". * Frankie Darrow, who plays a newsman, had previously played in The Bowery Boys films. * The episode includes a rare case of characters breaking the fourth wall, as both Zelda and Darrow's newsman character directly address the audience. * This episode was originally entitled \\"The Inescapable Doom Trap\\". * Based on \\"Batman's Inescapable Doom-Trap!\\" from Detective Comics #346 by John Broome. Although the evil character Eivol Ekdol appeared in the story, Zelda didn't; instead the magician was a man named Carnado. * For once, the Dynamic Duo enter through the rear of Police HQ.

It was released in 2002 by Pieter Spronck, a scientist at Tilburg University, and was inspired by David J. Webb's PalmPilot game SolarWars (which in turn was based on Matt Lee's popular Palm game Dope Wars) and the 1980s classic 3D strategy game Elite (though it does not have Elite's 3D flight mode). The game is free software under the GNU General Public License. Space Trader for Palm OS centers on buying and selling ten commodities in various star systems around the galaxy. The player has one of several types of spacecraft, and interacts with other traders, pirates, and police. The creator of the game announced that he was going to create a sequel, called Picoverse, which was announced in late 2002 and expected to be finished in early 2003. , however, no news regarding the game has been released. Despite this Dead Jim Studios released a similar and greatly expanded game for iOS called Dark Nova. Spronck expressed support for the remake on his website. There are two modern ports of Space Trader available for iOS: * SpaceTrader by Sightsaw * Space Trader 2016 The Google Play Store lists at least two versions of Space Trader for Android. History During the early 1980s, a game called Space Trader, was released for the Commodore 64. Its scope consisted of a small planetary system, the outermost planet of which, \\"Wolk,\\" was only accessible by the most expensive and most powerful spaceship, attained near the end of the game. The Commodore 64 version served as a rudimentary basis for the Palm OS game. Gameplay Space Trader is a complex strategy game where the end goal is for players to acquire enough credits to purchase a moon to retire to. Players initially start in a randomly generated galaxy with a small spaceship, armed with one simple laser, along with 1000 credits. From then, there are several ways to amass the necessary funds to retire and complete the game, with players able to trade goods for profit, bounty hunt or become a pirate. Trading is the safest and easiest option of the three, along with being the main focus of the game. To trade, players are able to buy and sell ten different commodities in each system, with their prices and quantities dictated by three main factors: a system's technological level, its political system and current events in the system. The player's initial ship will hold only a small amount of cargo for trading, however as the player progress, they are able to purchase larger ships with greater cargo holds, along with buying equipment which allows for additional cargo space. When traveling across systems, players may encounter various ships, with different interactions depending upon the class of the ship encountered. There are three main different classes: police, traders and pirates. Each class can come in any of the 10 different types of ships. Players may also rarely encounter special items, famous space captains and aliens when traveling to systems. To help protect themselves (or possibly become a pirate), players can purchase different tiers of lasers, along with shields, and even a cloaking device. Once a player has finally managed to reach the required sum of 500000 credits, the player may make their way to the Utopia system where they can purchase a moon. Once they do this the game ends and players receive a final score.

This Batepisode was first broadcast on ABC February 10, 1966, and rerun June 23, 1966, and continues and concludes the story of Zelda the Great, a magician whose fading career has led her to crime. The story began in \\"Zelda The Great.\\" Plot synopsis From the previous episode, Zelda has kidnapped Aunt Harriet from Wayne Manor and demanded $100,000 for her safe return. Bruce Wayne must contact her within an hour, but the police cannot find the millionaire (because he is currently Batman) Batman tells Commissioner Gordon that he'll track Wayne down, and with just over half the hour remaining, Wayne reaches police headquarters. There he learns that Zelda has demanded he contact her by television. He and the police race to a nearby studio, where their broadcast interrupts regular programming. Bruce Wayne, Commissioner Gordon, and Robin appear on the air, and offer a telephone number for the criminal to call, promising it will not be traced. Wayne reveals that the counterfeit story was a ruse and that the criminal has real money. Robin appeals to whatever decency she has left, imploring her to release Aunt Harriet from being suspended over a tub of flaming oil. Zelda agrees to release her prisoner. With police help, Aunt Harriet returns to Wayne Manor. Alfred, the Wayne butler, feels guilty, since he was below dusting the Batcave when Harriet received the false telephone summons, but Wayne advises his loyal servant to rid himself of guilt, for the kidnapping has enabled him to deduce the criminal's identity. This declaration surprises Robin, who does not understand how Batman arrived at this. Alfred also contributes a clue: a matchbook from the Gnome Bookstore that fell from Aunt Harriet's pocket. En route to the bookstore, Batman prompts Robin to recall Aunt Harriet's predicament, and after putting two and two together, Robin realizes who the criminal is: The suspended-over-flaming-oil escape was Zelda's signature trick when Bruce Wayne took Dick Grayson to see Zelda on Dick's last birthday. At the Gnome Bookstore, Eivol Ekdol reveals to Zelda that there is no escape from his doom trap. He plans to lure Batman into the trap so the caped crusader will show him how to escape it. When Zelda questions how she can use the trap if Batman understands it, Ekdol tells her: \\"Dead men tell no tales!\\" He has hired two syndicate contract killers to assassinate Batman after he escapes the trap. Although highly reluctant to commit murder, Zelda has anticipated Ekdol's strategy: she planted the book of matches Alfred found to lure the Dynamic Duo to the bookshop, the doom trap, and their deaths. He hides the killers inside two mummy cases and the villains wait. The bookstore is closed, but the door is unlocked. Batman and Robin enter, and quickly discover a note that leads them to a slim volume titled, \\"The Truth About Bats.\\" Removing it from the shelf opens a concealed door into Eivol Ekdol's workshop and his \\"Inescapable Doom Trap\\". A fake bat inside leads the duo into the trap. The trap's space-age plastic resists the tools from their utility belts, deadly gas begins to pour in, and the floor vent is electrified. But the gas rises; Robin realizes it must contain hydrogen. Using their metal belt buckles, the Duo creates a spark and the exploding gas bursts apart the trap. As they're about to pass between the mummy cases concealing the machine gun equipped killers, Zelda warns them. They duck and the gangsters kill each other with crossfire. Ekdol tries to escape, but Batman knocks him out with a Batarang. A tearful Zelda surrenders, truly remorseful. While Ekdol is taken into custody, Zelda is granted her reprieve.

Therein, it belongs to the subfamily Erechthiinae, of which it is the type genus. The exact circumscription of this genus is still disputed, but it may encompass more than 150 species. Systematics and taxonomy Here, the genus is treated in the wide circumscription (sensu lato) adopted by many authors today, and representing the presumed core group of the Erechthiinae. Delimited thus, Erechthias includes several other genera, some of which have occasionally been treated as independent even by fairly recent authors. They are still rather similar and contain moths that are (at least overwhelmingly) very closely related. Still, they differ in details such as the wing venation - with Erechthias sensu stricto having all veins separate (as opposed to e.g. the Decadarchis group, which has hindwing veins 5 and 6 stalked) - or the clasper's harpe being nude in Erechthias s.str. but bearing a cluster of setae on the costa. However, the female genitals look almost alike in all of them.Clarke (1986) Many of these supposedly distinct genera were always considered monotypic and are unlikely to be valid. More notable are Decadarchis (including Caryolestis, Nesoxena, Pantheus and perhaps others) and Ereunetis (including Lepidobregma and Neodecadarchis); these two are more frequently considered separate genera than other subgroups of Erechthias. The members of the former (sub)genus were in fact at first often placed in Tinea of subfamily Tineinae. Other species of Erechthias were historically assigned to Acridotarsa - also of the Tineinae (E. deloneura) - or to Mesopherna of the Myrmecozelinae (E. epomadia). E. glyphidaula has been a particular source of confusion; even veteran researcher Edward Meyrick, in some of his last works, no less than three times established a new monotypic genus for this species.Clarke (1986), Pitkin & Jenkins (2004), ABRS (2010), Robinson [2011] More unusually, some species of Erechthias were initially mistaken as members of the cosmet moth genus Cosmopteryx (E. cyanosticta) and the ermine moth genus Argyresthia (E. zebrina); these genera are basal Ditrysia not particularly closely related to Erechthias. The enigmatic \\"genus\\" Acrocenotes - a single species initially held to belong in the Plutellidae, which are also not close relatives of Erechthias - is also included here in the present treatment.ABRS (2010), Robinson [2011] As another taxonomic curiosity of this genus, E. beeblebroxi is named after Douglas Adams's famous two-headed science fiction character Zaphod Beeblebrox; the moth has a \\"false head\\" pattern that presumably helps to confuse would-be predators. Finally, the actual delimitation of Erechthias against related genera such as Comodica still needs to be determined. For example, whether the Erechthiinae Callicerastis stagmatias and Mecomodica fullawayi are justifiably separated in their monotypic genera or better included in Erechthias (as are all the other species once placed in Callicerastis) is disputed; the latter in particular seems to be somewhat intermediate between Comodica and Erechthias.Pitkin & Jenkins (2004), ABRS (2010), Robinson [2011] Selected species The numerous species of Erechthias include:Clarke (1986), ABRS (2010), Robinson [2011] * Erechthias acontistes Meyrick, 1880 * Erechthias acontotypa Turner, 1926 * Erechthias acroleuca Turner, 1923 * Erechthias aellophora Meyrick, 1880 * Erechthias ancistrosema Turner, 1939 * Erechthias ascensionae * Erechthias articulosa Meyrick, 1921 * Erechthias aspera (J.F.G.Clarke, 1986) * Erechthias beeblebroxi Robinson & Nielsen, 1993 * Erechthias capnitis (Turner, 1918) (type of Empaesta) * Erechthias celestra (J.F.G.Clarke, 1986) * Erechthias celetica Turner, 1923 * Erechthias centroscia (Turner, 1933) (type of Gongylodes) * Erechthias charadrota Meyrick, 1880 * Erechthias chasmatias (Meyrick, 1880) (type of Hectacma) * Erechthias chionodira * Erechthias cirrhogramma (J.F.G.Clarke, 1971) * Erechthias citrinopa (Lower, 1905) (sometimes in Comodica) * Erechthias clistopa (Meyrick, 1929) * Erechthias contributa (Meyrick, 1932) (sometimes in Comodica) * Erechthias coleosema (Meyrick, 1934) * Erechthias cyanosticta (Lower, 1916) * Erechthias darwini * Erechthias decaspila (Lower, 1905) (sometimes in Comodica) * Erechthias deloneura (Turner, 1923) * Erechthias diacrita (Turner, 1923) * Erechthias diaphora * Erechthias dochmogramma (Lower, 1916) (sometimes in Comodica) * Erechthias dracaenura * Erechthias elaeorrhoa Meyrick, 1880 * Erechthias epispora (Lower, 1905) (sometimes in Comodica) * Erechthias epomadia (Turner, 1923) * Erechthias erebocosma (Meyrick, 1893) * Erechthias eurynipha (Turner, 1923) (sometimes in Comodica) * Erechthias flavistriata - sugarcane bud moth (type of Neodecadarchis) * Erechthias glyphidaula (Meyrick, 1933) (type of Amphisyncentris) * Erechthias grayi * Erechthias incongrua (J.F.G.Clarke, 1986) * Erechthias iseres (Turner, 1917) * Erechthias iuloptera (Meyrick, 1880) (type of Ereunetis) * Erechthias kerri * Erechthias lychnopa Meyrick, 1927 * Erechthias minuscula - erechthias clothes moth (type of Lepidobregma) * Erechthias molynta * Erechthias mucronata (Meyrick, 1921) (type of Zanclopseustis) * Erechthias mystacinella - curve-winged apple moth * Erechthias niphadopla Meyrick, 1880 * Erechthias niphoplaca (Turner, 1923) * Erechthias orchestris (Turner, 1932) * Erechthias oxymacha (Meyrick, 1893) * Erechthias oxytona (Meyrick, 1893) * Erechthias penicillata (type of Pantheus) * Erechthias percnomicta (Meyrick, 1934) * Erechthias phileris (Meyrick, 1893) * Erechthias photophanes (Meyrick, 1917) * Erechthias physocapna (Meyrick, 1929) * Erechthias polionota Turner, 1923 * Erechthias polyplecta Turner, 1923 * Erechthias praedatrix (Meyrick, 1934) (type of Caryolestis) * Erechthias psammaula (Meyrick, 1921) * Erechthias rufimacula (Meyrick, 1934) * Erechthias saitoi (Moriuti & Kadohara, 1994) (sometimes in Comodica) * Erechthias scythromorpha (Turner, 1926) * Erechthias sphenotoma (Meyrick, 1935) (type of Aeolarchis) * Erechthias simulans (type of Decadarchis) * Erechthias sinapifera (Turner, 1926) * Erechthias strangulata (Meyrick, 1929) (type of Nesoxena) * Erechthias symmacha (Meyrick, 1893) * Erechthias trigonosema (Turner, 1923) * Erechthias tritogramma (J.F.G.Clarke, 1986) * Erechthias zebrina (type of Tinexotaxa) Synonyms Times and again, groups of these moths have been proposed for separation in distinct genera.

He is best known for his early efforts to promote national and provincial public health care systems. Some have argued that he deserves as much recognition as Tommy Douglas for the establishment of medicare in Canada.David Bly, \\"Western medical statesmen shaped Canadian health care\\", Calgary Herald, 14 August 2005, B5. Early life and career Archer was born and raised in Campbellford, Ontario, the son of a Methodist minister. His parents were both English emigrants.1921 Census of Canada He trained in medicine, and completed his studies at the University of Toronto. He moved to the Lamont region of Alberta in 1903 as a Methodist medical missionary, and worked as a pioneer doctor, often travelling by dirt roads to treat his patients. In 1911, he convinced the Methodist Mission to construct a fifteen-bed hospital at Lamont at a cost of $15,000. The hospital opened the following year, and Archer served as its superintendent until his death.The hospital was operated by the United Church of Canada after 1925, as the successor to the Methodist Mission. See Don Thomas, \\"Lamont's determination pays off\\", Edmonton Journal, 10 September 1999, A7. Archer was president of the Canadian Medical Association, Alberta Branch in 1921-22, and of the Canadian Medical Association (CMA) in 1942-43.AMA Presidents since 1889 , Alberta Medical Association, accessed 27 August 2009. Health care activism Archer was one of the first prominent advocates for public health care in Canada. In 1932, he presented a brief from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta to a commission on health care established by the Government of Alberta. The committee subsequently recommended the establishment of separate rural and urban health plans, in which the government would pay two-ninths of the total cost. Although modest by modern standards, this was a significant initiative for its time. The United Farmers of Alberta government passed these recommendations as the Alberta Health Insurance Act in February 1935, but was voted out of office in the 1935 provincial election before it could implement the program. The next government did not continue with the insurance plan. As president of the CMA, Archer chaired a special meeting wherein the assembled delegates voted 73-0 in favour of a health insurance plan for Canada. He supported Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King's national health insurance proposal in 1945, and travelled the country to promote the plan. Although King's government was re- elected in the 1945 federal election, the plan was never enacted due to a dispute with the Government of Ontario over tax revenues. Archer continued to support health insurance reform in Alberta. A year before his death, the Alberta government passed legislative for a medical insurance program. This led to the creation of Medical Services (Alberta) Incorporated, a non-profit plan started by Alberta doctors.Most of the information concerning Archer's health care activism is taken from David Bly, \\"Western medical statesmen shaped Canadian health care\\", Calgary Herald, 14 August 2005, B5. Political candidate Archer was a candidate of the Liberal Party of Canada in the federal elections of 1940 and 1945, running in the rural Alberta riding of Vegreville. He narrowly won the Liberal nomination in 1940, defeating Peter Lazarowich by a vote of 110 to 104.Autobiography of Anthony Hlynka (trans.), printed in Oleh W.

The film is based on the 1931 short story \\"The Vessel of Wrath\\" by W. Somerset Maugham and was adapted by Sydney Box. It was the second screen adaptation of the book following the 1938 film Vessel of Wrath. The film was shot in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Plot The new British Resident of the Welcome Islands, Ewart Gray (Donald Sinden), arrives in full uniform by ship, anticipating the excitement of a posting in the tropical Indian Ocean. He is informed that the last Governor had shot himself from \\"loneliness\\", which dampens his spirits a little. On landing, he finds his quarters are not ready for him, and he is invited to stay by the local missionary Owen Jones (Paul Rogers) and his sister Martha (Glynis Johns). He soon finds their company, while friendly, a little overbearing, and returns to stay at his own residence despite it not being finished. That evening, he is visited by the only other European resident of the island, Edward Wilson (Robert Newton), known as the \\"Honourable Ted\\", who introduces himself and drinks a large amount of Gray's whisky. Despite having been warned that Ted was a scoundrel, Gray soon warms to him, finding him well-spoken and obviously educated. A year after arriving on the island Gray is disappointed to see Ted arrested and brought up before him in court for encouraging a girl at the mission to steal some money which he then spent on drink before becoming involved in a drunken brawl. Gray breaks with precedent and sentences Ted to three months' hard labour on a neighbouring island. While there, the local headman (Michael Hordern) suffers from appendicitis. Because her brother, who functions as a local doctor as well as running the mission, is unwell, Martha travels out and successfully performs the operation. She nurses the headman back to health, while also tending to a local elephant that had injured its trunk after being attacked by a crocodile. On the way back she travels in a boat with Ted, who has now finished his sentence. She strongly disapproves of Ted, and the fact that he and the crew are drunk on arrack. She is horrified when the propeller fails and they are forced to spend the night on a small desert island. She is convinced that Ted will try and molest her, but to her surprise he leaves her alone all night‚Äîexcept to put some blankets on her to stop her becoming cold. When they return to the capital she is now slightly infatuated with Ted, in whom she can see signs of goodness. He remains repulsed by her, and ignores her gentle attempts to get to know him better. His drunken behaviour on the island carries on as before, and he is involved in another brawl. This time Gray is forced to sentence him to deportation to Australia. His departure is delayed by a sudden outbreak of cholera which sweeps the islands. With all available hands needed in the capital, only Martha can be spared to go to the northern islands to treat the outbreak there. Because the governor and her brother are worried that the spread of disease might encourage a native rebellion they are hesitant to let her go. Ultimately they agree, provided she takes Ted with her. At first he refuses to help her when he is approached, but later guiltily agrees to join her. Once they reach the northern islands they discover the inhabitants have become hostile to them, blaming the spread of the disease on the Europeans. However, Martha persuades them to let her help, reminding them of how she saved the life of the headman months before. They assent to her presence, and she and Ted throw themselves into the task of fighting the disease. Slowly they grow extremely fond of each other, and finally embrace. Each has made an emotional journey, Martha from a repressed state to being a more sensually aware woman while Ted has changed from a morally dubious character to being a more upstanding person. After failing to save the life of a young woman, they are suddenly seized by a mob and threatened with death. Pegged out, they are about to be trampled to death by an elephant, but the animal stops at the last moment, recognising her as the woman who had nursed its trunk months before. Astonished by this miraculous survival, the native inhabitants let them go. Back in the capital, Martha and Ted marry and he takes up playing the organ to accompany her in the mission. Gray takes some satisfaction from the fact that the number of deaths have been dramatically reduced since the last outbreak of disease and that it should in future be possible to contain and reduce the number of fatalities from the disease.

Glynis Johns' casting was announced the following month Her fee was a reported ¬£10,000. It was the second time Newton had followed Laughton in a film role the first being Les Mis√©rables. Newton said \\"When 1 told Charlie that I was going to play the part he wished me luck. Then he said: 'And when you've made it I'll reissue mine again.' \\" Newton had been living in Los Angeles but returned to London in January 1954 to make Trilby then The Beachcomber. Donald Sinden, then a contract star for the Rank Organisation at Pinewood Studios, recalls: > Robert Newton should have been perfect in the part. It is no secret that he > was a very heavy drinker and recently, but not for the first time, he had > been warned by his doctors that if he did not stop he would more than likely > pop off in the very near future. When we began Beachcomber he had been on > the wagon for three months and a sorry sight he was: gone were the thrown- > back head and the fiery eyes; the jerky gestures made by his arms were now > limp and seemed to lack purpose. It was tragic to realise that he had now > reached a stage when he relied so totally on alcohol to inject spirit into > his performance. He was listless and just moped around the studio, hardly > talking to anyone. He knew he was not giving his best and this worried him. > Every morning we greeted each other in the make-up room, where he stripped > himself down to a pair of none too clean shorts-style baggy underpants, sat > down, leaned back against the head-rest and stared with his large bloodshot > eyes at the ceiling. Occasionally a low moan escaped his lips. He confided > to me that he was not happy with the film; things were not altogether > successful in his private life; he was toying with an idea of doing > Shakespeare's Richard III in Australia, but generally his career was not > going as well as he could wish... Early one morning I was seated silently in > my make-up chair when suddenly the door crashed open. There stood Newton, > absolutely plastered, his eyes blazing. He staggered across the room, thrust > his face into mine and with slobbering lips and flashing eyes he embarked on > the most thrilling rendering I have ever heard of \\"Now is the winter of our > discontent made glorious summer...\\" (What a Richard III he would have been!) > From that moment he really took off in the film, but sadly there were only a > few days to go‚Äîand sadder still, that last bout of drinking was followed > shortly after by his death.Sinden, Donald (1982). A Touch of the Memoirs. > Hodder & Stoughton. page 203. Filming was completed by March 1954. After filming, Newton said that because the original \\"was filmed so long ago I don't feel that any of Laughton's mannerisms have crept into my portrayal. In fact, it never worried me at all. When one asks how it feels to do a picture revival, I always wonder why they bother doing them again ‚Äì except in this instance. I did enjoy playing the character. As written by Maugham it's always been rich, colorful and amusing.\\" Reception The New York Times review called it a \\"competently wrought Technicolor remake of W. Somerset Maugham's 'Vessel of Wrath that did not measure up to the earlier 1938 adaptation which featured \\"inspired characterizations by Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester\\".

In the United States, the states of Pennsylvania, Virginia, Florida, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma and Wisconsin use the term to describe the extraordinary jurisdiction of their highest court, called the Court of Appeals in New York or the Supreme Court in the other states, over the courts below it. King's Bench jurisdiction includes the power to vacate the judgments of inferior courts when acting in extraordinary circumstances, for example, where the importance of an issue to public well-being or the expediency with which action must be taken in the interest of justice requires superseding normal judicial or appellate procedures. Federal courts in the United States possess the power to issue similar extraordinary writs under the All Writs Act. The term originates from the English Court of King‚Äôs Bench. The Court of King's Bench at work. This illuminated manuscript from about 1460 is the earliest known depiction of the English court. It shows the judges of the court, clerks, lawyers and, at the bottom of the illustration, guards watching chained prisoners awaiting trial. Pennsylvania The Province of Pennsylvania, also known as the Pennsylvania Colony, was an English proprietary colony from the time of its royal charter in 1681 until the American Revolution in 1776 when Pennsylvania adopted its first Constitution. In Pennsylvania, King‚Äôs Bench power refers to an English common law authority which the General Assembly recognized and explicitly bestowed in 1722 on the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, granting that court by charter constitutional authority over legal and supervisory aspects of the court system in the English colony. As presently-codified, Pennsylvania statutes state that, \\"Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Supreme Court may, on its own motion or upon petition of any party, in any matter pending before any court ... involving an issue of immediate public importance, assume plenary jurisdiction of such matter at any stage thereof and enter a final order or otherwise cause right and justice to be done.\\"Pennsylvania Statutes, Title 42, ¬ß 726. Extraordinary jurisdiction. The King‚Äôs Bench Powers also are described in Pennsylvania Statutes Title 42, ¬ß 502, in language taken from the 1722 Act: The Pennsylvania Supreme Court held in In re Bruno, 101 A.3d 635, 677, 627 Pa. 505, 575 (2014), however, that its King‚Äôs Bench powers are constitutionally- inherent and are not dependent upon any statute: Troubles and public feuds involved the supreme court in the early 1990s, specifically including Justice Rolf Larsen, who was criminally convicted and impeached by the house, then subsequently convicted and removed from office by the state senate,. The public image of Larsen illustrated the need for court reform. The upheaval surrounding Justice Larsen's time on the bench served as a catalyst for a change in the state judicial discipline system. Pennsylvanians for Modern Courts credits the public turmoil he caused with leading to the overwhelming passage of a constitutional amendment that strengthened the way judges are disciplined for misconduct. In 1993, Pennsylvania voters amended the state constitution. The change created a new system for the oversight of judges through a state Judicial Conduct Board, which independently investigates misconduct complaints, and a Court of Judicial Discipline, which independently determines a Pennsylvania judge's innocence or guilt,. The supreme court, nevertheless, retains ultimate power over the Commonwealth\`s judicial system and judges. For an example of the exercise of King's Bench jurisdiction, see the Pennsylvania \\"kids for cash\\" scandal. In June 2020, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court exercised its King's Bench prerogative to take up Scarnati v. Wolf, regarding the separation of powers between the Legislature and the Executive Branch to determine whether Title 35 of the PA code as written allows the legislature to force an end to Emergency Decrees made by the Governor.

It is apparently an extremely close relative of the type genus of its subfamily, Nemapogon, and some authors include it there.Pitkin & Jenkins (2004) Its type species is called A. yildizae today, but that name was not established until 1981. Formerly, this moth was known as A. laterella - originally placed in Tinea -, as well as T. picarella and A./T. arcuatella. The first name was established by C.P. Thunberg in 1794, and the latter two (junior synonyms, it was assumed) by J. H√ºbner in 1796 and H.T. Stainton in 1854, respectively. But all these names had been used before - J.N.C.M. Denis & I. Schifferm√ºller had described a T. laterella in 1775 (a concealer moth, now known as Agonopterix laterella), C.A. Clerck a T. picarella as early as 1759 (now Nemapogon picarella), and F.P. von Schrank a T. arcuatella in 1802 (probably a junior synonym of the arctiid moth Dysauxes ancilla).

He was the winner of 73 races, including the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing in Puerto Rico. Camarero is notable for setting the current world record of the most consecutive wins for a Thoroughbred racehorse at 56 in a series of races between April 1953 and August 1955. Background Cameraro was sired by Thirteen who was a son of 1938 Travers Stakes winner Thanksgiving. His name translates to \\"waiter\\" in Spanish. Camarero was a small bay colt that weighed 750 pounds and stood only 14 hands high. His male line traced to The Finn and he was bred and owned by prominent San Juan newspaper man Jose Coll-Vidal.New York Times. Aug 9, 1955 As per Puerto Rican racetrack regulation, prohibitive favorites are not allowed to be wagered on, which meant that for most of Camarero's winning streak no on-track bets were taken. Camarero was the first winner of Puerto Rico's Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing, winning the Governor's Cup, Jose de Diego Stakes and Primavera Stakes in 1954, undefeated.Thoroughbred Times. Aug. 5, 2005Jorge Col√≥n Delgado. Camarero en punta. 1998. As well according to Hall of Fame Jockey Angel Cordero Jr \\"he[Cameraro] means horse racing.\\"  History  On July 19, 1951, Camarera foaled a black colt with four white pasterns who was named Sabrosito. Through Coll-Vidal's foal-sharing agreement with breeder Luis Rechani-Agrait, the colt was bred in Rechani-Agrait's name and foaled on his farm. A year later, Coll-Vidal and trainer Pablo Suarez first saw Sabrosito, whom Coll- Vidal said looked like a small donkey. However, Suarez insisted that Coll- Vidal take the well-bred yearling. He did and renamed the colt Camarero in honor of his dam. At the beginning of the 1950s, Puerto Rico's economy had declined and many lived in poverty. By 1953, when Camarero began his career, only two tracks were operating. Camarero made his first start on April 14, 1953, at two furlongs at Quintana racetrack and won by three lengths. On May 17, he won his second race; seven days later, he won his first stakes race in front-running fashion by four lengths. On July 17, he won his fifth race when he took the six-furlong Luis Mu-oz Rivera Stakes by seven lengths. From August 23 to October 23, Camarero won eight more races, including another stakes. His jockey in his first 13 victories was Juan Diaz-Andino. Coll-Vidal had come close to Kincsem's record with two other horses, Cofresi and Condado, who won 49 and 44 consecutive races, respectively. He believed that for Camarero to break the record, he would have to replace the colt's jockey with leading rider Mateo Matos. In 1952, Matos exercised horses at Aqueduct for Horatio Luro but returned to Puerto Rico. When he was first asked to ride the undefeated Camarero, Matos declined. \\"He wanted to sleep in peace,\\" wrote Jorge Col-n-Delgado in his book about Camarero. Assured that Coll-Vidal would not replace him if he lost aboard Camarero, Matos agreed to ride the colt. Camarero recorded five more victories to finish his two-year-old campaign in 1953 with 18 wins. On New Year's Day in 1954, he won the 61/2-furlong Governor's Cup while carrying 120 pounds, eight more than the second-highest- weighted horse in the race. The Governor's Cup was the first leg of Puerto Rico's Triple Crown, which was established in 1951 and had not yet been won. The next two legs were the 11/16-mile Jose de Diego Stakes and the 11/8-mile Primavera Stakes. Camarero could carry high weight, but it was unknown if he could race successfully at longer distances. On January 11, 1954, he won his 20th race by ten lengths while going 11/16 miles, eliminating any doubts of his ability. On April 17, Camarero won the Jose de Diego Stakes for his 28th win. On May 9, carrying 15 pounds more than any other rival, he won the Primavera Stakes to become Puerto Rico's first Triple Crown winner. On his actual third birthday, Camarero won his 32nd race and set a 61/2-furlong track record. After winning another race ten days later, he earned a well-deserved rest. Fans grew eager for Camarero's return, and on October 24, he easily won his next start. He finished his three-year-old campaign with his 37th victory on December 19 and was selected Horse of the Year. Racing's popularity in Puerto Rico increased with each of Camarero's victories. By the end of 1954, track attendance had jumped 25%. People who had never been interested in the sport paid attention to Camarero while he chased Kincsem's record. \\"Some people would say that he was allowed to win, but that wasn't true,\\" Cordero recalled. \\"He used to win because he was the best. The only thing was he never raced against horses [that were not bred] in Puerto Rico. But in my opinion, he could have competed against any horse at the time. ... But since he was chasing the world record, they kept racing him against Puerto Rican-bred horses.\\" At four in 1955, Camarero won nine more races from January 6 to April 22 and was just nine wins away from the record. During the first 32 racing days of the year, total handle increased a whopping 64% compared with the previous year. Everyone in Puerto Rico was talking about Camarero and chanting \\"Camarero en punta,\\" or \\"Camarero up front,\\" a phrase used by track announcer Pito Rivera-Monge when the colt headed to victory. Camarero kept winning. On July 18, 1955, he won his 54th race to tie Kincsem's record. The entire country waited to see when he would race again, and the interest was covered in the New York Times. Finally, it was announced that Camarero would go for the world record on August 7 in the fourth race at Quintana. At the start of the 6 1/2-furlong race, the eight horses broke alertly. Matos held Camarero back and looked for a good spot to place him. By the half-mile pole, Matos let Camarero go, and the colt responded to win by six lengths. \\"With 600 meters to go, Camarero was already ahead and I could hear the people screaming,\\" Matos recalled in Col-n-Delgado's book. \\"Coming down the stretch, I knew I had the race. Camarero started to pull away easily. The closer that we would get to the finish line, the louder the people would get in the stands. It was incredible. When I passed the finish line, I remember telling myself, 'We did it. We finally did it.' \\" Fans shouted and hugged each other, while others cried. Elsewhere, the thousands of people who listened to the race on the radio began to rejoice, and many went out into the streets where drivers honked their horns. All of Puerto Rico celebrated. \\"When Camarero established the world record, I was at the track that day,\\" Cordero said. \\"I was too young to fully understand what was going on. All I knew was that Camarero was our champion and that every time he raced, he would win.\\"Camarero was scheduled to rest following his world-record victory, but for some reason returned ten days later and scored his 56th consecutive victory. However the win was short lived as 9 days later he would taste defeat for the first time in his career. he would go on to race 20 more times after his first defeat losing another 3 times but managing to win another 17 more times. By the end of his career he had won 73 times out of 77 starts with two seconds and zero thirds.

Founded along the National Road, Morristown prospered as long as the road was heavily travelled, but it stagnated after railroads became prominent. Because the community neither died nor prospered, it has retained its mid-nineteenth- century architecture into the present, making it one of the National Road's least-changed settlements. Settled in the early nineteenth century, Morristown prospered after the National Road became its main street in 1826. In its first decades, the village was heavily dependent on the road; during the village's best years, in the 1850s, more than forty National Road-related businesses lined its streets. However, prosperity departed soon afterward: railroads were built through eastern Ohio in the 1850s, supplanting the National Road as the major mode of transportation, and because no railroad served Morristown, it lost most of its commerce. Buildings continued to be erected into the 1870s, but comparatively little construction occurred in later decades. Nevertheless, the village remained, and benign neglect contributed to Morristown's preservation: no other National Road community in eastern Ohio has experienced so few changes since the road's heyday. Part of its significance derives from construction methods. Most buildings are vernacular structures built of brick in Flemish bond, setting Morristown apart from surrounding communities, which possess few historic brick buildings.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 63. In early 1980, the Morristown Historic District was declared, with boundaries encompassing ; seventy of the district's eighty-six buildings were rated as contributing properties, as was the village cemetery. Limited destruction and limited new construction has left Morristown with nearly all of its mid-19th century built environment, enabling the district to qualify for the Register both because of its place in area history and because of its historic architecture.

He served as Bishop of Galveston from 1918 until his death in 1950. Biography Christopher Byrne was born in Byrnesville, Missouri, to Patrick and Rose Byrne. After attending the village school where his father taught, he studied at St. Mary's College in Kansas, from where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1886.

Therein, it belongs to the subfamily Tineinae. It is probably fairly closely related to the type genus of its family and subfamily, Tinea, and can be most easily separated by the wing venation - in Tinea, two veins in each wing arise from a common stalk, whereas none do in Wyoma.Clarke (1986) Description The head is bulging and has a rough, scaly and hairy surface, but the well-developed proboscis is devoid of scales. The labial palps droop; their second segment is longer than the third and has a clump of stout bristles at the tip, facing outside. The maxillary palps are long and usually carried tucked in. The antenna are unbranched and about as long as the forewing; the scape bears a flimsy comb. The forewings are narrow and have a rounded tip and 12 separate veins. Of these, vein 1b is simple, 2 starts near the angle of the wing, 7 reaches the leading edge near the tip and 11 starts from the basal fourth of the wing. Vein 4 is closer to 5 than to 3, and vein 10 is well separate from 9 and 11. The hindwings have only 8 veins, with the anal veins vestigal or absent. The hindwing veins are also all separated; vein 2 starts notably before the angle, while the position of vein 7 is equivalent to the forewing; veins 4-6 are evenly spaced, but vein 3 runs closer to vein 2. The male genitals are symmetrical and resemble those of Tinea; they lack a socius, but gnathos and uncus are present. Female genitalia are not well described, but as dar as is known they differ markedly from those of Tinea.

His name appears in the list of admissions to Gray's Inn on 1 August 1619. He resided at Oxford for some years after taking his bachelor's degree, and contributed to the poems written at Christ Church on the visit of James I to that college in 1605. On 13 December 1610, he succeeded George Montaigne as divinity professor at Gresham College. This post he resigned in the following year; but in 1612, when desirous of returning to the college as rhetoric professor, he was unsuccessful in obtaining the post. In 1616, he became rector of Parndon Magna in Essex, and of East Hanningfield in the same county. He retained both livings until about December 1643, when he was deprived, and his benefices were sequestered by the House of Commons. He died early in 1645.

It was based on the novel Twenty-Four Hours by Louis Bromfield and the play Shattered Glass by Will D. Lengle and Lew Levenson. In the film, an alcoholic married man is accused of murdering the woman with whom he has been carrying on an affair. The title comes from the fact that the film takes place from 11 pm one night to the same time the following night. Plot At an evening party in New York City, the Towners mourn their failing marriage, then leave separately. The somewhat drunk Jim walks to a bar for some more liquor. Before he arrives, a man is shot to death outside the establishment; those inside hastily carry the body inside and surmise that someone named Tony is responsible. Meanwhile, Fanny is driven home by her lover, David Melbourn. On the way, she breaks up with him, telling him she realizes now that she still loves Jim. However, she plans to leave her husband, thinking she is not good enough for him. Jim next heads to a nightclub to see his lover, star singer Rosie Duggan. He asks her if it is possible for a man to love two women, then remarks that the snow was red outside the bar. After he leaves, her ex-con husband Tony Bruzzi shows up. He wants her to take him back, but she has him thrown out, though she keeps his gun; she guesses from the red snow that Tony killed someone. Later, she takes Jim home. He falls asleep on her chaise longue. Then Tony shows up, jealous and determined to kill Jim. She tells him that Jim is not there, but he does not believe her. When she refuses to open a locked door, they struggle and he accidentally kills her. The next morning, Jim wakes up and finds Rosie's body. Meanwhile, Tony hides out at Mrs. Dacklehorst's place, but he is tracked down by Dave the Slapper and his gang; the man Tony shot was part of Dave's mob. Tony demands Mrs. Dacklehorst deliver or mail a letter to his gang, but she betrays him instead, and he is shot dead. Jim is charged with Rosie's murder. When Fanny shows up at the police station, Jim tells her to divorce him so she will not get entangled in his troubles, but she refuses to do so. Fortunately, fingerprints on a liquor bottle at Rosie's place match Tony's, and Jim is released. The couple reconcile, and Jim promises to stop drinking.

Laid down at Charleston Navy Yard, Charleston, South Carolina, the ship was commissioned on 21 November 1944, Lt. (jg) Neal B. Hadsell, USNR, in command.  Service History (Turner)  During World War II the ship was assigned to the Asiatic Pacific theater. At that time the fleet was under the command of Admiral Spruance and named the Fifth fleet. Vice Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner was Commander of Amphibious Forces Pacific and was to be in charge of operations until the beachhead was established. The Kerama Retto islands were a small chain of islands 15 miles west of the southwest tip of Okinawa. The invasion of the Kerma Retto was an opportunity to break in all twelve of the 188-class LSM(R)s. One of the reasons that Admiral Turner wanted to capture Kerama Retto was his knowledge that the Japanese Sea Raiding Units had suicide boats hidden there. On the morning of 29 March three of these boats attacked the USS LSM(R)-189 but were promptly destroyed. The southern half of the six-mile-wide invasion beach was assigned to Task Force 55, commanded by Rear Admiral John Leslie Hall, Jr. The assault troops were under Major General John R. Hodge. The southern support craft included USS LSM(R)-189, USS LSM(R)-190, USS LSM(R)-191, LSM(R)-192, and USS LSM(R)-193. On 3 May 1945 the 188-class LSM(R)'s were put to the test and were not found wanting. The action at the picket stations proved that the courage and punishment endured by US Navy personnel was unrelated to the size of the ship. The Japanese launched their fifth kikusui attack on 3 May. Picket station 10 was the hardest hit. Shortly before dusk, the destroyer was hit by a series of six kamikazes, suffering 45 killed or missing and 49 wounded. The ship survived, but was later decommissioned because it wasn't worth repairing. About the same time, approximately 20 planes attacked destroyer . She was crashed by four of them and sank within 12 minutes of the first hit. She lost 30 dead or missing and 79 wounded.USS LSM(R)-195 was also on Picket Station 10 and while rushing to the aid of the Aaron Ward and the Little was likewise crashed by a kamikaze. The crash started her rockets exploding and knocked out the fire main and auxiliary pumps. LSM(R) 195 had to be abandoned and, after being ripped by heavy explosions, sank. The following day the ordeal for the LSM(R)'s reached its tragic climax. The day dawned bright and ominous. LSM(R) 190 was patrolling at Picket Station 12. Not long after sunrise the anticipated kamikazes arrived and were met by American combat air patrol. Several of the Japanese planes managed to get through and attack the ships on this station. Three kamikazes crashed LSM(R) 190. The ship that had seen so much previous action and had been credited with rescuing 180 survivors of other stricken ships was herself sunk. In the same attack the destroyer USS Luce was sunk, carrying 126 of her 312 officers and men with her. At the same time as LSM(R) 190 was fighting her final battle, USS LSM(R)-194 was facing the same fate at Picket Station 1. This was the most critical station on the picket line. The capture of the Kerama Islands did not come without a price. On the night of 28 March, Japanese planes from Okinawa airfields made a special attack on the small patrol craft assembled between the islands and Okinawa. About a dozen were shot down, but one crashed into USS LSM(R)-188. There were 15 men killed and another 32 wounded. The badly damaged ship survived, but she was sent back to Pearl Harbor and saw no further combat. No one realized at the time that this was a preview of what this class of ship would suffer six weeks later on the picket line. On 13 April 1945, LSM(R)'s 192, 193, 196, 197, 198, 199 and LC(FF) 535 were assigned to night harassment patrols and destructive bombardment of Ie Shima from period beginning 13 April through 16 April 1945. The LSM(R)'s utilized irregular rocket fire for destructive harassment, 5\\" star shell for illumination and harassment, and 40 mm to prevent any reinforcement of the beach defenses. A Small Boy with the Firepower of a Battleship(James M. Stewart) The LSM(R) was heralded in the 16 April 1945 Life Magazine with a centerfold picture. Each of these tiny ships had amazing firepower, greater at short range than the combined firepower of two mammoth Iowa class battleships, ran the caption. The interim group of 12 LSM(R)s transited the Panama Canal and via San Diego, Honolulu, and the Philippines, headed for battle against Japan in March 1945. Unaware of their destination, the crews were nonetheless well equipped and trained. In a preliminary assault on 26 March 1945, they laid down a rocket barrage at dawn on Kerama Retta, a small cluster of islands off the southwestern shore of Okinawa. Their objective: to allow the Marines to swiftly land and secure the islands and the harbor for protection of the hospital, supply and communication ships, and floating drydocks. The early dawn assault surprised the Japanese. The marines took control with a minimum of casualties and established this haven for damaged ships.
