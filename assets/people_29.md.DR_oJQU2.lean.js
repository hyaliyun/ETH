Sevda was interested in trying to learn everything: both techniques of traditional \\"khanende\\" singing (lessons of legendary singer Alim Gasimov proved a help) and opera bel canto (she went for probation period to Florence, Italy in 2005 not in vain). The most important feature that has always characterized the singer's performance is a high degree of emotional contribution which cannot leave you indifferent.

Plot In 1780, master tinker Horatio Prim (Lou Costello) arrives at the Kings Point estate of Tom Danbury (Jess Barker). Although Horatio has failed to raise enough money to buy Danbury's housemaid, Nora O'Leary (Anne Gillis) out of indentured servitude, he carries a letter of commendation from Gen. George Washington that he hopes will persuade Danbury to let them marry. Unfortunately, Horatio has a romantic rival in Danbury's devious butler, Cuthbert Greenway (Bud Abbott), who tries to prevent Horatio from presenting his letter. Nora, however, rushes off to show the letter to Danbury, but she inadvertently overhears Danbury discussing his part in Benedict Arnold's plot. Danbury seizes Nora and hides the letter in a secret compartment in the mantel clock. Danbury's fianc√©e, Melody Allen (Marjorie Reynolds), standing outside the window, witnesses this betrayal and enlists Horatio's help to ride off and warn Washington's army. But American troops on their way to arrest Tom overrun the estate, loot it and set it ablaze. Melody and Horatio are mistakenly shot as traitors, and their bodies are cast into a well. Their souls are condemned to remain bound to the estate until their innocence can be proved. For the next 166 years the ghosts of Horatio and Melody roam the grounds of the estate. In 1946, after the estate has been rebuilt and restored with much of its original furnishings, playwright Sheldon Gage (John Shelton) invites his fianc√©e, June Prescott (Lynn Baggett), her Aunt Millie (Binnie Barnes), and his psychiatrist, Dr. Ralph Greenway (Bud Abbott), a descendant of Cuthbert, to spend the weekend. They are greeted by the clairvoyant maid, Emily (Gale Sondergaard), who senses that the grounds are haunted. Ghosts Horatio and Melody have some fun with this idea and scare the guests in various ways ‚Äî especially Greenway, whom Horatio at first mistakes for Cuthbert. Horatio and Melody also find themselves frightened by modern inventions like the electric light and the radio. These supernatural events prompt the newcomers to hold a s√©ance led by Emily. From clues offered by Horatio, Melody and Tom's repentant spirit , they discern the identities of the ghosts and the existence of the letter which can free them. The group searches for Horatio's letter, but the original mantel clock containing the letter is in a New York museum. Greenway, to atone for the misdeeds of his ancestor, goes to the museum to retrieve the letter. But when museum officials refuse to let him examine the clock, Greenway steals it. He arrives back at the estate where the state police are waiting for him. They arrest Greenway, but are prevented from taking him off the estate by the curse that binds Horatio and Melody to it. When the clock is finally opened and the letter is revealed, Melody and Horatio's innocence is proved and they are freed. Each is called to heaven by a loved one; Melody by Tom, and Horatio by Nora, who meets him at heaven's gate but points to a sign that reads, \\"Closed for Washington's Birthday.\\" Horatio must wait one more day to get into heaven.

Abbott and Costello in Hollywood. New York: Perigee Books. The working title was \\"The Ghost Steps Out.\\" It was the first Abbott and Costello film to be directed by Charles Barton, who would go on to helm eight of their movies, including Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948). As in the duo's preceding film, Little Giant, Abbott and Costello do not play friends or partners, but are individual characters. Also as in the previous movie, Costello's character is largely the hero, while Abbott plays a somewhat unsympathetic dual role. The team's trademark burlesque routines are absent, and they speak directly to each other only in one scene at the beginning of the film. This change in the comics' onscreen formula was reportedly due to both disappointing box office receipts for their 1945 films The Naughty Nineties, Here Come The Co-Eds, and Abbott and Costello in Hollywood, and personal tensions that led to a brief break up that year. Advertising materials for the film depicted both Abbott and Costello in modern clothes, and gave no indication that the film was part period piece or fantasy. Bud Abbott, who had epilepsy and never learned to drive, learned to drive for one scene in this film. According to his son, Bud Abbott, Jr., this was the only time in his life he ever drove an automobile. A few weeks into filming, Costello wanted to switch roles with Abbott. He refused to report to work, but director Charles Barton waited him out. Costello eventually returned, said nothing more about it, and continued in the same role. Reception Although the film was a departure from the usual Abbott and Costello formula, Variety called it \\"a picnic for Abbott and Costello fans\\" that \\"won't shock the patrons with any unfamiliar novelties...Direction is well-aimed at the belly-laugh level, and the trick photography is handled with flawless technique.\\" Motion Picture Daily wrote, \\"Any resemblance between this and the last half dozen Abbott and Costello pictures is so slight and incidental as to be written off completely by the showmen whose customers used to raise the rafters with shouts and screams of laughter in the dawn of the A. and C. era. The audience present at the previewing of 'The Time of Their Lives' at the Forum Theater in Los Angeles all but rolled in the aisles with merriment, exactly as in the good old days.\\"Motion Picture Daily. August 14, 1946. The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"By long odds, it is the best A&C; show to date.\\" Trade critic sentiment did not translate into box office, however.

It was the first NCAA regular season game broadcast nationwide in prime time. It established college basketball as a sports commodity on television and paved the way for the modern \\"March Madness\\" television coverage. History The UCLA Bruins were the dominant NCAA men's basketball program of the era, having won Division I championships in 1964, 1965, and 1967. Houston Cougars coach Guy Lewis wanted to prove his program's worth to his critics, so he decided to schedule UCLA. Houston and UCLA had met in the previous season in the semifinals of the 1967 NCAA Tournament. UCLA had prevailed against Houston 73-58, and won their 3rd NCAA championship.2007-2008 UCLA Men's Basketball Media Guide - PDF copy available at www.uclabruins.com. pg. 61 Post Season Scoring Recaps The game Ted Nance, the sports information director for the University of Houston, put the schedule together.Einhorn, Rapaport 2006. UCLA sports information director J. D. Morgan talked Bruin head coach John Wooden into the game by explaining how great it would be for college basketball. Nance put advertisements in the Cougar football programs touting the game as the \\"Game of the Century.\\" The game was televised nationally via a syndication package through the TVS Television Network, with Dick Enberg announcing and Bob Pettit providing color commentary. Morgan had insisted to TVS owner Eddie Einhorn that TVS use Enberg, the Bruins' play-by-play announcer.Einhorn, Rapaport 2006, p. 51. Einhorn paid $27,000 for the broadcast rights on TVS.Jerry Wizig - It's been 20 years since they've played The Game of the Century. Houston Chronicle, January 20, 1988 TVS signed up 120 stations, many of which would preempt regularly scheduled network programming.Ron Rapoport - 1968: Houston vs. UCLA at the Astrodome - The game that took college basketball to a new level. UCLA fell at the cavernous Astrodome and had its 47-game winning streak stopped. Los Angeles Times, January 20, 2008 link at Latimes.com The basketball floor actually came from the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. The Bruins arrived in Houston with a 47-game, two-and-a-half-season winning streak. The Cougars were also undefeated since the last meeting between the two teams. The first half between the AP Poll's No. 1 UCLA and No. 2 Houston closed with the Cougars up by three points. The second half saw the tension between the squads highlighted within the matchup of Houston's Elvin Hayes and UCLA's Lew Alcindor (later known as Kareem Abdul Jabbar). Hayes, a 6-foot-9 forward, was not directly matched against the 7-2 Alcindor, but he did block three of Alcindor's shots, and the crowd roared his nickname, \\"Big E.\\" With two minutes remaining in the game, the scored was tied at 69 after the Bruins' Lucius Allen made a pair of free throws. Hayes took a shot and was fouled by Bruins reserve Jim Nielsen. Hayes, playing with four fouls in the second half, scored two free throws. The Bruins still had time to score, but an attempted basket by Allen would not drop. On the last possession, UCLA's All-American guard Mike Warren committed a rare mental error deflecting out of bounds a pass meant for UCLA's star shooter Lynn Shackelford, who was unguarded in the corner. In the end, the Cougars pulled the upset, 71-69, ending the Bruins' 47-game winning streak. Aftermath Houston's Elvin Hayes is carried in a victory celebration on the Astrodome's floor Up to that point, only NCAA post- season games had been broadcast nationally, so there was much skepticism regarding where the broadcast would take the non-profit organization's policy. The broadcast drew a vast television audience in addition to the 52,693 fans who had filled the Astrodome for its first basketball game. Each school received $125,000 for the game, four times the 1968 NCAA tournament payout of $31,781. The January 1968 cover of Sports Illustrated depicted the game, with Hayes shooting over Alcindor. Alcindor‚Äîwho had sustained an eye injury at a game against Cal a week earlier‚Äîhad the worst performance of his college career.Robyn Norwood - Game of the Century. Los Angeles Times, January 20, 1998 It was one of only two times in his UCLA career that he shot less than 50% from the field. Three days after the game, UCLA starting forward Edgar Lacy quit the team. Wooden had benched him after 11 minutes, and he never re- entered the game. Upset with Wooden's public comments implying that he did not want back into the game, Lacy quit the team. \\"I've never enjoyed playing for that man,\\" Lacy said of Wooden after quitting. In 2008, Wooden stated, \\"I'm sorry I said that. It hurt him, and that's why he quit. I was very disappointed. Edgar was a fine boy.\\" Neither Houston nor UCLA lost another game for the remainder of the regular season. The teams met again in the 1968 NCAA Tournament semifinals, with the then-No. 2 ranked Bruins winning 101‚Äì69 against the No. 1 Cougars.Chapin, Dwight - How Wooden Stopped the Big E. Los Angeles Times, March 23, 1968; A1; Assistant coach Jerry Norman was credited by Wooden for devising the diamond-and-one defense that the Bruins used to contain Hayes, who was averaging 37.7 points per game but was held to only 10. UCLA advanced and defeated the North Carolina Tar Heels 78‚Äì55 for the 1968 title. Houston also lost the consolation game to Ohio State. Those games were at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, on the same floor used in the Astrodome game.Einhorn, Rapaport 2006, p. 40. The 1971 NCAA Tournament was held at the Astrodome following the success of the game and drew more than 31,000 spectators for both the semifinals and championship. The 1982 tournament was held at the Louisiana Superdome. Eventually, most Final Fours were awarded only to host cities with domed stadiums. Starting with the 1997 tournament, only domed stadiums have hosted the Final Four. UCLA and Houston played again in 1969 at Pauley Pavilion for the regular-season rematch. UCLA won 100‚Äì64.2007-2008 UCLA Men's Basketball Media Guide - PDF copy available at www.uclabruins.com. pg. 122 Year by Year results UCLA won six more national championships under Wooden. Lewis led his Phi Slama Jama teams to three consecutive Final Fours (1982‚Äì1984), advancing to the national championship game in 1983 and 1984. In 2006, Hayes, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (Lew Alcindor) and Wooden were inducted into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame, followed by Lewis in 2007. Significance Previously, only NCAA post-season games were broadcast on national television. The \\"Game of the Century\\" proved that a national audience would watch college basketball games during the regular season. Furthermore, it was telecast not by a Big Three Network but rather by the independent TVS Television Network. In 1969, NBC became the first major network to broadcast the championship game, at a cost of more than $500,000. In 2008, the NCAA deal with CBS to televise the entire tournament was worth $545 million.Al Carter - College Basketball: UH and UCLA, under the big top.

The Cameroon line is a chain of volcanoes. It includes islands in the Gulf of Guinea and mountains that extend along the border region of eastern Nigeria and the Ambazonian region of Cameroon, from Mount Cameroon on the Gulf of Guinea north and east towards Lake Chad. The islands, which span the equator, have tropical climates and are home to many unique plant and bird species. The mainland mountain regions are much cooler than the surrounding lowlands, and also contain unique and ecologically important environments. The Cameroon volcanic line is geologically unusual in extending through both the ocean and the continental crust. Various hypotheses have been advanced by different geologists to explain the line. Geography Mount Cameroon craters left after the eruptions in 2000 In the Gulf of Guinea, the Cameroon line consists of six offshore volcanic swells that have formed islands or seamounts. From the southwest to the northeast the island groups are Pagalu (or Annob√≥n), S√£o Tom√©, Pr√≠ncipe and Bioko. Two large seamounts lie between S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, and between Principe and Bioko. On the mainland, the line starts with Mount Cameroon and extends northeast in a range known as the Western High Plateau, home to the Cameroonian Highlands forests. Volcanic swells further inland are Manengouba, Bamboutu and the Oku Massif. East of Oku there are further volcanic mountains in the Ngaoundere Plateau, some of which appear to have similar origins. Island chain Annob√≥n The southernmost island in the chain is Annob√≥n, also known as Pagalu, with an area of about . It is an extinct volcano that rises from deep water to above sea level. The average temperature is , with little seasonal variation. Most rain falls from November to May, with annual precipitation averaging - less than on the mainland. Annob√≥n has lush valleys and steep mountains, covered with rich woods and luxuriant vegetation. The island belongs to Equatorial Guinea. The small population lives in one community, practicing some agriculture but mainly living by fishing. S√£o Tom√© Rainforest trekking is one of S√£o Tom√©'s attractions Beach scenery on S√£o Tom√©. S√£o Tom√© Island is in area, lying almost on the equator. The entire island is a massive shield volcano which rises from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, over below sea level, and reaches above sea level in the Pico de S√£o Tom√©. The oldest rock on Sao Tome is 13 million years old. Most of the lava erupted on S√£o Tom√© over the last million years has been basalt. The youngest dated rock on the island is about 100,000 years old, but numerous more recent cinder cones are found on the southeast side of the island. Due to the prevailing southwesterly winds, there is great variability in rainfall. In the rain shadow to the northeast of Sao Tome the vegetation is dry savannah, with only of rain each year. By contrast, the lush south and west of the island receive about of rain, mostly falling in March and April. The climate is hot and humid with the rainy season from October to May. The higher slopes of the island are forested and form part of the Obo National Park. S√£o Tom√© has never been connected to Africa, and therefore has many unique plants and birds. Of the bird species, 16 are endemic and six are near endemic, of which four are only shared with Pr√≠ncipe. Six species are considered vulnerable, and three are critically endangered (S√£o Tom√© ibis, S√£o Tom√© fiscal and S√£o Tom√© grosbeak). Schistometopum thomense, a bright yellow species of caecilian, is endemic to S√£o Tom√©.AmphibiaWeb (2011). Schistometopum thomense. Accessed May 1, 2011. As of 2010, S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, an independent nation, had an estimated population of 167,000, most of whom lived on S√£o Tom√© island. The main language is Portuguese, but there are many speakers of Forro and Angolar (Ngola), two Portuguese-based creole languages. The economy is mainly based on tourism. Agriculture is important near the north and east coasts, with the chief exports being cocoa, coffee, copra, and palm products. There are large reserves of oil in the ocean between Nigeria and S√£o Tom√© which have not yet been exploited. Pr√≠ncipe Pr√≠ncipe is the smaller of the two major islands of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, with an area of . Volcanic activity stopped around 15.7 million years ago, and the island has been deeply eroded apart from spectacular towers of phonolite. The island is surrounded by smaller islands including Ilheu Bom Bom, Ilh√©u Caro√ßo, Tinhosa Grande and Tinhosa Pequena, and lies in ocean deep. It rises in the south to at Pico de Pr√≠ncipe, in a thickly forested area within the Obo National Park. The north and centre of the island were formerly plantations but have largely reverted to forest. As with S√£o Tom√©, the island has always been isolated from the mainland and therefore has many unique species of plants and animals, including six endemic birds. Pr√≠ncipe has a population of around 5,000 people. Other than Portuguese, some speak Principense or Lunguy√™ with a few Forro speakers. Bioko Coastline of Bioko Bioko is just off the coast of Cameroon, on the continental shelf. The island used to be the end of a peninsula attached to the mainland, but was cut off when sea levels rose 10,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age. With an area of it is the largest island in the Cameroon line. Bioko has three basaltic shield volcanoes, joining at the lower levels. San Carlos is high with a broad summit caldera, lying at the extreme SW of the island. The volcano dates from the Holocene age and has been active within the last 2000 years. Santa Isabel is the largest volcano at in height, and contains many satellite cinder cones. Three eruptions have been reported from vents on the southeast flank during the late-19th and early-20th centuries. San Joaquin, also known as Pico Biao or Pico do Moka, is high, on the southeast of the island. The summit is cut by a small lake-filled caldera, and there is a crater lake on the NE flank. San Joaquin has also been active during the last 2000 years. The southwestern side of Bioko is rainy for most of the year, with annual rainfall in some locations of . The climate is tropical at lower altitudes, becoming about cooler for each of elevation. There is open canopy montane forest above on Pico Basil√©, Gran Caldera de Luba and Pico Biao, with subalpine grassland above . Bioko has exceptional numbers of endemic species of flora and fauna, partly due to the great range of altitudes, particularly birdlife. The montane forest is protected by the Basil√© National Park and the Luba Crater Scientific Reserve. There has been little habitat loss, and the southern slopes have remained almost completely undisturbed. Although hunting pressure is rising, the fauna in the inaccessible southern part of the island is mostly intact. This includes an endemic subspecies of drill, Mandrillus leucophaeus poensis. Bioko is part of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea. The island has a population of 334,463 inhabitants (2015 Census), most of whom are Bubi. The rest of the population are Fernandinos, Spaniards and immigrants from R√≠o Muni, Nigeria and Cameroon. Cocoa production was once the main export, but has declined in recent years. Farming, fishing and logging remain important. Natural gas is produced in offshore wells, processed on the island and exported via tanker. Western High Plateau The Western High Plateau, also called the Western Highlands or the Bamenda Grassfields, continues the Cameroon line into the mainland of Cameroon. The plateau rises in steps from the west. To the east, it terminates in mountains that range in height from to . The plateau gives way to the Adamawa Plateau to the northeast, a larger but less rugged region. Volcanism Lake Oku is a crater lake on the plateau. The Western High Plateau features several dormant volcanoes, including the Bamboutos Mountains, Mount Oku, and Mount Kupe. Crater lakes dot the plateau, the result of dead volcanoes filling with water. This includes Lake Barombi Mbo and Lake Bermin, which have the highest number of endemic fish species per area recorded anywhere in the world.Freshwater Ecoregions of the World (2008). Western Equatorial Crater Lakes. The Mount Cameroon on the coastline, which may have been observed by the Carthaginian Hanno the Navigator in the 5th century BC, erupted in 2000. Further inland, the stratovolcano Mount Oku at is the second highest mountain in sub-Saharan mainland West Africa. In 1986, Lake Nyos, a crater lake in the Oku volcanic plain, released a cloud of carbon dioxide gas that killed at least 1,200 people. Climate The region has cool temperatures, heavy rainfall, and savanna vegetation. The plateau experiences an equatorial climate with a wet season of nine months, and a dry season of three months. During the wet season, humid, prevailing monsoon winds blow in from the west and lose their moisture upon hitting the region's mountains. Average rainfall per year ranges from to . High elevations give the region a cooler climate than the rest of Cameroon. For example, the average temperature at Dschang in the West Province is . Toward the north, rainfall levels are reduced as the Sudan climate becomes predominant. Menchum Falls in the Northwest Province The Western High Plateau's relief and high rainfall make it a major watershed for Cameroon. Important rivers in the region include the Manyu, which rises in the Bamboutos Mountains and becomes the Cross River on its lower course, and the Nkam, which is known as the Wouri River on its lower course. The region gives rise to important tributaries to the Sanaga River. These rivers have a long high-water period during the wet season and a short low-water period during the dry season. Environment Volcanism has created fertile black and brown soils. The Western High Plateau was once heavily forested. However, repeated cutting and burning by humans has forced the forest back to areas along the waterways and has allowed grasslands to expand into the area. Sudan savanna forms the dominant vegetation. This consists of grassfields‚Äîleading to the name Bamenda grassfields around the city of Bamenda‚Äîand short shrubs and trees that shed their foliage during the dry season as a defence against brush fires and dry weather. Raffia palms grow in the valleys and depressions. Neighboring volcanic regions Although geographers may limit the Cameroon line to the volcanoes in the island chain and the Western High Plateau, many geologists also include the Ngaoundere Plateau which extends the line to the east in the Adamawa plateau, and some would also include the Biu plateau and the Jos Plateau in Nigeria. Geology Geologists disagree over which volcanic regions should be included in the Cameroon Volcanic Line. All include the island line and the continental line up to Oku. Based on similarities in age and composition, some also include the Ngaoundere Plateau, the Biu plateau of Nigeria to the north of the Yola arm of the Benue Trough, and the Jos Plateau to the west of the Benue Trough. There are varying theories for the similarities between the oceanic and continental volcanoes. Surrounding plate Major geographical features near Cameroon line The Cameroon line bisects the angle where the coast of Africa makes a 90¬∞ bend from the southern coast along the west of the Congo craton and the western coast along the south of the West African craton. The coastline roughly corresponds to the coast of the Borborema geological province of northeastern Brazil, which began to separate from this part Africa around 115 million years ago. The Central African Shear Zone (CASZ), a lineament that extends from the Sudan to coastal Cameroon, runs under the continental section of the Cameroon line. It is visible in the Foumban Shear Zone, which was active before and during the opening of the South Atlantic in the Cretaceous period. The western end of the shear zone is obscured by the volcanoes of the Cameroon line, but based on reconstruction of the configuration of South America before it separated from Africa, the Foumban Shear Zone can be identified with the Pernambuco fault in Brazil. A major earthquake in 1986 could indicate that the shear zone is reactivating. The Benue Trough lies to the west of the Cameroon line. The Benue Trough was formed by rifting of the central West African basement, beginning at the start of the Cretaceous era. A common explanation of the trough's formation is that it is an aulacogen, an abandoned arm of a three-armed radial rift system. The other two arms continued to spread during the break-up of Gondwana, as South America separated from Africa. During the Santonian age, around 84 million years ago, the Benue Trough underwent intense compression and folding. Since then it has been tectonically quiet. Hypotheses The basaltic rocks in the oceanic and continental sectors of the Cameroon line are similar in composition, although the more evolved rocks are quite distinct. The similarity in basaltic rocks may indicate they have the same source. Since the lithosphere mantle below Africa must be different in chemical and isotopic composition from the younger lithosphere below the Atlantic, one explanation is that the source is in the asthenosphere rather than in metasomatized lithosphere. A different view is that the similarities are caused by shallow contamination of the oceanic section, which could be caused by sediments from the continent or by rafted crustal blocks that were trapped in the oceanic lithosphere during the separation between South America and Africa. According to some geologists, there is evidence that a mantle plume has existed in the region for about 140 million years, first remaining in roughly the same position while the African plate rotated above it, and then remaining stationary under the Oku area since around 66 million years ago. In this theory, the abnormal heat rising in a mantle plume would lead to melting of the upper mantle, which raises, thins and weakens the crust and facilitates rifting. This may have been repeated several times in the Benue Trough between 140 Ma and 49 Ma. One plume-related hypothesis for the later development of the Cameroon Line around 30 Ma is that it coincides with development of a shallow mantle convection system centered on the mantle plume, and is related to thinning and extension of the crust along the Cameroon line as pressures relaxed in the now stationary plate. The mantle plume hypothesis is disputed by scientists who point out that features of the region are quite different from what is predicted by that hypothesis, and that a source in a lithospheric fracture is more likely to be the explanation. The volcanic line is likely leakage of magma from reactivated Precambrian faults. The puzzling feature, that the composition of the magmas is the same both in the land volcanoes and the oceanic ones is likely explained by recent studies that show the underlying lithosphere is the same. A gravity study of the southern part of the Adamawa plateau has shown a belt of dense rocks at an average depth of 8 km running parallel to the Foumban shear zone. The material appears to be an igneous intrusion that may have accompanied reactivation of the shear zone, and may be associated with the Cameroon line.

Youth Theatre has two stages: the children's stage and the evening stage. Its ensemble consists of sixteen permanent characters. History The Puppet Theatre, held in September 1931, was the first play performed in Youth Theatre. Over the next few years, a steady turnover of puppeteers continually renewed the group. As their reputation grew, they began to work with resources of better quality. The company played not only on the main stage in Novi Sad, but also often toured around the province of Vojvodina. Plays were performed on Sundays, the only day the audience was unoccupied and able to attend. Tickets were very cheap, and the group often offered performances free of charge. Youth Theatre was closed during World War II. Afterwards, it reopened under the new name of \\"Vojvodinian Puppet Theatre\\". Unfortunately, circumstances were difficult because of the large number of puppets and equipment which were lost or stolen during the war. However, the manager of the Serbian National Theatre, then called the Vojvodinian National Theatre, provided his support to help revive the company. Soon after, the theatre changed its name to \\"City Puppet Theatre\\". From 1952 to 1968, it was simply called the \\"Puppet Theatre\\". In November 1968, its name changed again, this time to Youth Theatre, which has remained since that time.

In the Georgian aristocratic hierarchy, it was the title of the third rank of prince and governor of a large province.

Career  Lindsay was the owner of a contractors plant hire company as well as a bookmaker when he came to Wigan in 1980 to join Jack Robinson, Tom Rathbone & Jack Hilton. This led to an upsurge in the fortunes of the club. Wigan became one of the first teams to turn professional in the league and dominated the scene winning an impressive eight League Championships, between 1987‚Äì96, as well as nine Challenge Cup wins including a record eight consecutive wins between 1988-95 as well as five Lancashire County Cups and three World Club Championships. Lindsay was directly responsible for some of the recruitment in that time frame, bringing players to the club who later went on to become legends such as Dean Bell, Andrew Farrell, Andy Goodway, Andy Platt, Brett Kenny, Denis Betts, Ellery Hanley, Frano Botica, Joe Lydon, Jason Robinson, Martin Offiah and Mick Cassidy. During his time at the club, Lindsay became team manager of the Great Britain RL team. He was manager when the team toured New Zealand in 1990 and Australia in 1992. He was also elected as President of the Rugby Football League in 1992. Lindsay left the club for a while and became the Chief Executive of the RFL in 1992, proposing the Super League which eventually replaced the First Division Championship as the sport's elite league competition in the UK from 1996 onwards. In 1996, he also became Chairman of the Rugby League International Board which at the time, was at odds with the Australian Rugby League. Lindsay left the RFL to become the Chief Executive of the newly formed Super League (Europe) Ltd. in February 2008. This followed an acrimonious period and in-fighting within the league divisions including an attempt to unseat the Chairman of the RFL, Sir Rodney Walker. Relations between Lindsay and Sir Rodney had deteriorated but the leading clubs wanted Lindsay to assume control of the newly formed Super League. Lindsay immediately secured a new lucrative TV contract exclusively for Super League. He remained at Super League until he voluntarily retired at the end of 1999. Lindsay re-joined the club when they moved from Central Park to lodge at the home of Wigan Athletic, the JJB Stadium, after Dave Whelan saved them from liquidation. The club's dominance had come under threat now that the league had gone fully professional and the introduction of the salary cap and 20/20 ruling (now 20/25) which meant the club at the time had only won two Super League titles since 1996. With the return of Maurice Lindsay the club won one Challenge Cup, under the stewardship of Stuart Raper in 2002, reaching the finals of the Super League in 2000, 2001 & 2003, losing on each occasion. This was seen as unacceptable by the Wigan board, and Lindsay in particular who had in total seven coaches at the club after his return with Andy Goodway, Frank Endacott, Stuart Raper, Denis Betts & Ian Millward all losing their jobs due to poor performances. (Mike Gregory was given leave due to an illness from which he later died). The club had a stark fall in its league position, with 2005 seeing the club fail to reach the top six for the first time in Super League and the 2006 season seeing the club rooted to the bottom of the league for most of the season before the sacking of Ian Millward and the acquisition of Brian Noble from Bradford. Due to increasing pressure on Lindsay to step down, he resigned, releasing a statement on the 30 July 2007 which cited a disappointment of missing out on reaching the new Wembley for the Challenge Cup and ill health as the reasons for stepping down. It was also said that Dave Whelan, the club's owner persuaded Lindsay to remain until the end of the season but may be looking to sell the club himself. During the weekend of the 2007 Challenge Cup final, Lindsay was taken to hospital after the club's doctor told him he needed urgent medical attention due to a perforated gall bladder which needed operating on. Lindsay was ordered by his doctor not to attend his final ever match at the JJB Stadium as chairman of Wigan, a match which saw Wigan defeat their closest rivals St. Helens 20-12 in order to grab the last available place in the 2007 engage Super League play-offs. New owner & chairman Ian Lenagan took official control on 1 December 2007. When Lindsay returned for his second stint at Wigan in 2000, he was subsequently put on to the Wigan Athletic F.C. board by Dave Whelan. This did not sit well with the Wigan Athletic fans who remembered his attitude, and several comments he had made during the 1980s belittling the club. They also saw him as obstructive during a time of financial trouble when he could easily have helped. The Latics fans reasoned his sudden warming to the club was due to the fact they were now an established premier league team. Whelan placed 2 Wigan Athletic directors on the Wigan R.L.F.C. board. Maurice remained on the Wigan Athletic board and represented the shareholders committee of the FA Premier League. In 2008 the FA Premier League elected Lindsay onto the FA Council. In February 2009, Lindsay became Chairman of Racecourse Data Technologies Ltd (RDT), where he remains today. RDT have contracts to supply and support computerised betting systems to every racecourse in the UK and Ireland. The company holds contracts with Satellite Information Services Ltd (SiS) and Turf TV to supply data. RDT have subsequently secured an important contract with the British Horseracing Authority to act as contractors in support of their race day computer operations. It was announced on 21 June 2010 that Lindsay replaced Derek Shaw as chairman of Preston North End F.C. Lindsay resigned as Chairman of Preston North End in December 2011 after battling septicaemia following knee surgery.

The automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells motor vehicles. United Kingdom Ford launched a new, fifth generation Escort in September 1990, ten years after the last new model was launched. The new Escort was available with 1.3, 1.4, 1.6 and 1.8 petrol engines as well as a 1.8 diesel. Other models had extras including electric windows, power steering, anti-lock brakes and central locking. There was also a saloon version, the Orion. While still very popular, the range was criticised by the motoring press due to its dull styling inside and out, mediocre driving experience and old engine range. Meanwhile, the Granada finally saw a reintroduction of a saloon model. Rover launched an updated Metro in May which added styling modifications to the previous design. The previous 1.0 and 1.3 A-Series engines were replaced with a new 16-valve K-Series units, with a choice of 1.1 or 1.4 litres. The saloon version of the 200 Series - the 400 Series - went on sale in April as a competitor to the Ford Sierra and Vauxhall Cavalier. In spite of the recent launches of similar-sized cars, Rover was still producing the Maestro and Montego ranges, though now in lesser numbers. Japan Nissan ended its use of the Bluebird name on the launch of its new large-sized range of hatchbacks, saloons and estates - the Primera - in September 1990. Power came from 1.6 and 2.0 petrol engines as well as a 2.0 diesel. The hatchbacks and saloons were produced at the Sunderland plant in England, but the estates were fully made up in Japan. There was a wide range of trims. Meanwhile, its Micra range was the 11th most popular car in Britain during 1990, making it the fifth most popular car in its sector and the most popular car imported from Japan. An updated Sunny range would follow in 1991. At the supercar end of the market, Nissan had launched the 300ZX, with a top speed of 155mph to compete with cars such as the Porsche 911. France Renault launched the new Clio, a range of three and five-door hatchbacks on the continent in May 1990 and would arrive on the British market in March 1991. Power came from a new range of 1.2, 1.4 and 1.6 petrol engines as well as a 1.9 diesel. The Clio was the replacement for the R5, though the car was still being built in Slovenia. Renault also had a new, smaller model planned for a 1992 launch. After 42 years of continuous production, Citroen finally axes the iconic \\"tin snail\\" the 2CV from its line-up with the final models made in July at its plant in Portugal where it was produced for the last 2 years. Germany BMW launched a new 3 Series late in 1990, for the compact executive market, ranging from basic 1.9 litre to the 2.5 litre petrol engine unit. Equipment levels were generally good, but some of the less expensive models had a radio and sunroof as only optional extras. The 3 Series range included a four-door saloon, and the remainder of the old 3 Series range remained on sale until the forthcoming new coup√©, cabriolet and estate replacements were launched. Volkswagen gave the Polo a major restyle to its exterior and interior after nine years on sale. A completely removable stereo/cassette player was added as a new security measure. The 1.0 and 1.3 petrol engines were carried over from the original 1981 Polo, but there were two more powerful versions of the 1.3 - the \\"GT\\" and \\"G40\\". Sales began in the autumn of 1990. In 1991 launch was planned of the third generation Golf. Italy Fiat had given the seven-year-old Uno a major redesign in 1989, with the interior and exterior changed substantially. There was a new 1.0 petrol engine at entry-level, with a 1.4 option at the top end of the range. Some models had electric windows, central locking and a sunroof as optional extras. The Uno Turbo continued as Fiat's rival for the Peugeot 205 GTi and Ford Fiesta XR2i. Alfa Romeo expanded the 164 range to include a lower priced 2.0 four-cylinder version. The Lancia Prisma, saloon version of the Delta hatchback, was replaced with the new Dedra.

He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister from 1997 to 2002, under President Didier Ratsiraka, and he was also National Secretary of the AREMA party at that time. He went into exile when Ratsiraka was ousted in 2002, and he was subsequently convicted of abuse of office in absentia. He was seen by many as the main potential challenger to President Marc Ravalomanana in the December 2006 presidential election;Ed Harris, \\"Madagascar airport shut to stop Rajaonarivelo\\", Reuters (IOL), October 9, 2006.\\"Madagascar court rejects polls challenger, clears 14\\", afrol News, October 20, 2006. however, he was barred from standing.

Following the December 2001 presidential election, a dispute arose between Ratsiraka and Ravalomanana regarding the results; after months of struggle, this dispute led to defeat for Ratsiraka and his supporters. A few days before Ratsiraka fled Madagascar in early July 2002, with the situation having turned clearly in Ravalomanana's favor, Rajaonarivelo announced his willingness to work with Ravalomanana.\\"13 dead as Ravalomanana's troops move on port\\", AFP (IOL), July 1, 2002. Like Ratsiraka, however, Rajaonarivelo went into exile in France when Ravalomanana prevailed. In a meeting with representatives of the African Union on October 29, 2002, Ravalomanana said that he was prepared to form a national unity government that would include members of AREMA, and he said that consultations with Rajaonarivelo regarding AREMA's participation would follow. AU representatives subsequently met with Rajaonarivelo in Pretoria on November 22, 2002; at that meeting, Rajaonarivelo stated again that AREMA recognized Ravalomanana's election as President, and he said that AREMA was prepared to work with Ravalomanana for the sake of national reconciliation and stability. He also said that AREMA was willing to participate in a planned parliamentary election, as long as the election was free, fair, and transparent, although he proposed that the election be delayed to ensure that it would occur under the proper conditions. He complained that members of AREMA were being harassed, intimidated, and arrested. Although the AU agreed with Rajaonarivelo's position on a delay, the election was nevertheless held as planned in December 2002.\\"Report of the AU Commission on Conflict Situations\\", Compendium of key documents relating to peace and security in Africa (2006), pages 192-193.

Rajaonarivelo faced arrest upon return to Madagascar; he argued that the charges against him were politically motivated. In spite of the convictions and sentences, Rajaonarivelo sought to run for president in 2006; he officially announced his candidacy on May 26, 2006. On October 7, 2006, he attempted to return to Madagascar from nearby R√©union to register as a presidential candidate before the October 14 deadline,\\"Exiled Rajaonarivelo barred anew from return\\", AFP (IOL), October 12, 2006. although his spokesman said he was afraid of being met by a \\"death squad\\" upon arrival; the airport at Toamasina was closed to prevent his arrival, however. He then went to Mauritius and tried again to return to Madagascar on October 12, but he was not allowed to board a flight by Air Mauritius, being described as a security risk; this measure had been requested by the government in Madagascar. Because he could not reach Madagascar, he could not sign his registration papers personally, and on October 18 he was barred from participating in the election by the Constitutional Court for that reason. Rajaonarivelo said that \\"by preventing my participation Marc Ravalomanana's regime invalidates the election\\", and he accused the international community of supporting \\"tyrannical practices\\" with \\"complicit silence\\".Ed Harris, \\"Polls invalid without me, says Rajaonarivelo\\", Reuters (IOL), October 20, 2006. President Ravalomanana was forced out of office by popular protests and military intervention in March 2009; the leader of the protests, Andry Rajoelina, assumed the presidency. When he was sworn in as President on March 21, 2009, Rajoelina said that he would pardon political prisoners and exiles; Rajaonarivelo then returned to Madagascar on April 25, 2009. Prime Minister Monja Roindefo had requested on April 23 that political exiles not return for the time being, but Rajaonarivelo, citing Rajoelina's inauguration statement, returned anyway.\\"L'exil√© politique malgache Pierrot Rajaonarivelo de retour √† Antananarivo\\", AFP, April 25, 2009.

He has lived in the United Kingdom as a British citizen since 1973. In 2003, his mother's marriage to Michael Tassano having been annulled, he formally reverted to the surname Wadel,http://ukdps.co.uk/ while maintaining the name Fabian Tassano for publications.http://www.celiagreen.com/fabianwadel.html Tassano studied Natural Sciences at Churchill College, Cambridge, specialising in Physics and Philosophy of Science. He graduated with a First in 1984, winning the Bronowski Prize.http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/students/prizes/bronowski In 1991 he qualified as a Chartered Accountant, having trained first at Grant Thornton and subsequently at KPMG Peat Marwick.

London: Duckworth, 1995. The book had a Foreword by Thomas Szasz, an American psychiatrist known for his libertarian views on mental illness, and was described by the philosopher Antony Flew as 'intellectually first-class'.Tassano, F., Mediocracy: Inversions and Deceptions in an Egalitarian Culture, Oxford: Oxford Forum, 2006, preliminary pages. The Power of Life or Death attempts to bring free-market and libertarian philosophical ideas into the medical ethics debate, in particular in relation to the treatment of the terminally ill, and examines the ideological subtext of the medical ethics literature, which Tassano argues often gives greater weight to collective interests than to the preferences of individual patients. Despite its radical approach the book received serious, if guarded attention from the medical profession, the British Medical Journal, for example, commenting: 'We would not recommend this book as comfortable bedtime reading. ... If you like an intellectual challenge this one is for you.' The book was also reviewed in Nature, which commented, 'His view goes straight to the medical jugular', and the Literary Review, according to which 'Tassano presents hair-raising case studies [...] his book is a timely polemic.'Cristina Odone, 'Doctors then and now', Literary Review, February 1996. The book was shortlisted for the Skrabanek Prize. Tassano analyses the ideological content of modern culture in general in Mediocracy: Inversions and Deceptions in an Egalitarian Culture (2006), characterized by Patrick Minford as a book that 'delightfully dissects the language of modern egalitarianism and political correctness'.Tassano, F., Mediocracy: Inversions and Deceptions in an Egalitarian Culture, Oxford: Oxford Forum, 2006. The book argues that both ‚Äòdumbing down‚Äô in the popular media, and the obscurantism prevalent in academic discourse, are manifestations of the same underlying ideology: one which appears egalitarian but in reality is designed to privilege a paternalistic elite and exclude those who might criticise it. Mediocracy received favourable reviews from a number of online commentators. Johnathan Pearce of the libertarian website Samizdata called it 'a rather fine book'. Curtis Yarvin described it as 'a comprehensive and witty dictionary'. Tassano's pejorative use of the term 'mediocracy' has, however, been contested; a 2016 paper in the Oxford Handbook series criticises it, describing the book as 'reactionary'.

As a screenwriter, he created the sitcoms The Flying Nun and The Partridge Family. As a playwright, he wrote Same Time, Next Year, Tribute, and Romantic Comedy and their film adaptations. He received a Tony Award nomination for Same Time, Next Year, and an Oscar nomination for the screen adaptation. Early years Slade was born in St. Catharines, Ontario in May 1930, the son of Bessie Harriet (Walbourne) and Frederick Newbound. Slade moved to England with his family at age five. After he returned to Canada, he worked as a steward on Trans Canada Airlines for a while before he went into acting as a career. Career Slade began his career as an actor in repertory theatre in England. He also acted with the Garden Center Theatre in Vineland, Ontario. In the mid-1960s, he relocated to Hollywood and began to work at Screen Gems as a writer for television sitcoms, including Bewitched. When ABC gave him the opportunity to create a series, he devised Love on a Rooftop, similar in theme to Neil Simon's Barefoot in the Park, about a young couple living in a windowless walk-up apartment with access to a rooftop with a view of San Francisco. The following year, Slade developed The Flying Nun (adapted from Tere Rios' book, The Fifteenth Pelican), with Sally Field as a young novice whose habit's headgear enabled her to fly. After briefly leaving Screen Gems to work as a script supervisor on The Courtship of Eddie's Father for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, he came back to Screen Gems to create The Partridge Family, based on the real-life Cowsills, and Bridget Loves Bernie, inspired by the play Abie's Irish Rose. He also wrote the script to the 1972 Columbia Pictures film Stand Up and Be Counted, directed by Jackie Cooper and starring Jacqueline Bisset, in which the Helen Reddy song \\"I Am Woman\\" was first introduced. The last show he created for Screen Gems before it changed its name to Columbia Pictures Television was The Girl with Something Extra. Despite his success in television, Slade returned to the theater in 1975 with his play Same Time, Next Year, about a couple who are married to others but meet once-a-year for sex and conversation. With Charles Grodin and Ellen Burstyn in the leads, the play was a major hit and ran for 1,453 performances. Slade received the Drama Desk Award and a Tony Award nomination for Best Play. In 1978, he followed with Tribute, the story of a man who learns to love his father, a successful actor who always had more time for his theatrical cohorts than his son. Even with Jack Lemmon heading the cast, it proved to be far less successful than its predecessor, closing after 212 performances. Slightly more successful was Romantic Comedy (1979), starring Anthony Perkins and Mia Farrow. Slade wrote the screenplays for the film versions of all three plays, and was nominated for an Oscar for his screen adaptation of Same Time, Next Year.\\"Broadway Playwright Bernard Slade Passes Away at 89\\".

Balachander and produced by Pushpa Kandasamy under banner Kavithalayaa Productions. The film stars Sarath Kumar in a dual role, along with Nayanthara and Napoleon in the lead roles, while Vadivelu, Prakash Raj, Lakshmi, Rohini, and Charle play supporting roles. The film was a success at the Chennai Box office and the music was rendered by Bharadwaj. Oru Vaarthai song was very famous around South India. This movie was also Nayanthara's debut in Tamil cinema. The film was dubbed and released in Telugu as Maa Daivam Peddayana.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99Oq1nCwdl8 Plot The movie starts in 1970s, where there is heavy drought in the southern districts of Tamil Nadu. Ayyadurai (Sarath Kumar) and Madasamy (Napoleon) are close friends and landlords of different castes in Tenkasi town in Tirunelveli district, and they try hard to help people and save them from dying during the drought. The local MLA (OAK Sundar), also a relative of Madasamy, smuggles rice given by the government, and people protest upon knowing about this. The MLA denies knowing anything about the sanctioned rice. That night, he starts to smuggle the rice, but the lorries are waylaid and ransacked by the people led by Madasamy. The MLA comes there and starts shooting towards people's legs. Ayyadurai sees the MLA aiming for Madasamy's head and pushes him. Then, Ayyadurai beats the MLA using the hilt of the gun, following which he dies. The local people support Ayyadurai and save him from police and also urge him to contest in the assembly by-elections. Now the movie comes to the present, where Ayyadurai has been the unopposed MLA of Tenkasi for more than 35 years. He returns from Chennai after resigning his post because the state department did not sanction his request to renovate the lakes in his area. His son Chelladurai (Sarath Kumar), a civil engineer, runs their business and helps his father for the people's welfare. Selvi (Nayanthara) is Madasamy's teenage daughter who deliberately fails her 12th standard exam as she loves Chelladurai and wants to marry him. Meanwhile, Karuppusamy (Prakash Raj) is the son of the MLA killed by Ayyadurai and wants to take revenge by either defeating or killing Ayyadurai. He has contested thrice against Ayyadurai in the past decade, with no avail. He has made around 20 attempts on Ayyadurai's life without any success. Meanwhile, Selvi proposes her love to Chelladurai, but he does not accept, saying that it might result in clashes between their families, as they both belong to different castes. Also, there comes a flashback where it is shown that a few years back Chelladurai‚Äôs arranged marriage got cancelled the night before wedding as the bride Malavika had eloped with her lover, which makes Chelladurai feel embarrassed. Because of this, he prefers to stay unmarried. Selvi, after failing her exams, informs about her love to both families, and after much deliberation due to varying caste, they decide to get them married. Now, Karuppusamy (being a second cousin of Madasamy) plays tricks to separate both Ayyadurai and Madasamy. He sends police on the day of marriage, saying that Selvi is still a minor and that it is illegal to get her married before 18 years of age. Ayyadurai accepts that and informs Madasamy to postpone the wedding. This angers Madasamy, and he believes that the police were sent only by Ayyadurai to cancel the marriage, as both of them belonged to different castes. The policeman also confirms Madasamy's suspicion and the 4 generation friendship is broken off . Karuppusamy uses this opportunity to get close to Madasamy, and makes him the evidence for the murder of his father a few years back by Ayyadurai. The police arrest Ayyadurai. The general election dates are announced in the state. The ruling party again gives a chance for Karuppusamy to contest, giving him an ultimatum to win. Ayyadurai cannot contest due to the murder case, and hence, he nominates an unwilling Chelladurai in his stead. Karuppusamy plans to murder Madasamy and blame Chelladurai for that so that Karuppusamy can get both caste votes and win the election. However, before that, Chelladurai saves Madasamy, though he later gives his signed withdrawal form to Karuppusamy and says that he let him become the unopposed MLA, as he is also a good-natured man, and his anger is only on Ayyadurai and not on the people of the town. Karuppusamy realizes his mistake and apologizes to Ayyadurai and Chelladurai for all his criminal activities. However, Ayyadurai prefers to stay in prison as he still feels guilty of murdering Karuppusamy‚Äôs father years ago. Karuppusamy becomes the MLA, and Chelladurai and Selvi marry to unify the families.

With the exception of keyboard player Paul Wieneke and Miller, this was a new line-up of the band. Personnel After touring in support of the 1994 album The Tape of Only Linda, three members ‚Äì bass player Rob Poor, guitarist Zachary Smith, and drummer Jozef Becker ‚Äì left the group for family or career reasons. For Interbabe Concern, Scott Miller took over the lead guitar duties that he had ceded to Smith on prior Loud Family albums. Paul Wieneke remained on keyboards and occasional lead vocals, and Kenny Kessel and Dawn Richardson joined the group on bass and drums, respectively. Becker remained as drummer long enough to record several tracks on the album. As credited in the CD booklet, the members were: *Kenny Kessel - bass guitar and backing vocals *Scott Miller - most guitars and vocals *Dawn Richardson - most drums and all vibra-slap *Paul Wieneke - synthesizer, unearthly rackets (beginning of \\"Sodium\\", \\"Chokehold\\", etc.), guitar, backing vocals, lead vocals on \\"Uncle Lucky\\" Guest musicians included Ken Stringfellow of The Posies on guitar, and Nina Gordon of Veruca Salt. Gordon provided backing vocals on the co-written song \\"The Softest Tip Of Her Baby Tongue\\". Stringfellow is credited for co-writing \\"Sodium Laureth Sulfate\\" and \\"I No Longer Fear the Headless,\\" and also played on \\"Not Expecting Both Contempo And Classique.\\" Former Game Theory drummer Gil Ray and keyboard player Shelley LaFreniere also appeared as guests; Ray would join the Loud Family as a member for their next album, Days for Days. Richardson left the band in 1996, and was replaced on the concert tour by drummer Mike Tittel, who currently leads the Ohio-based band New Sincerity Works. Thematic notes According to the Los Angeles Times, the \\"prevailing mood of frustration and loss\\" in Interbabe Concern sprang from the \\"collapse of Miller's marriage to Shalini Chatterjee.\\" Critic William Ham, writing in the 2005 book Lost in the Grooves, called this a \\"harsh, difficult album\\" with \\"dizzying mood-swings,\\" drawn from a dark period in Miller's life. Ham noted the twin departures of Miller's wife and his longtime producer Mitch Easter, and inferred that \\"since Chatterjee is [in 2005] married to Easter, we can assume that the two events were not mutually exclusive.\\" The result, according to Ham, was a \\"jagged sonic mosaic\\" adeptly fashioned by Miller from the \\"shattered pieces.\\" The Tulsa World's Thomas Conner identified it as \\"sort of a concept album... an overanalysis of a divorce ('recorded in cold, passionless digital') by one very intriguing artist.\\" Critical response Mark Deming, in the 2002 book All Music Guide to Rock: The Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul, wrote that Interbabe Concern features \\"the fragmented songs and purposefully twisted aural montage\\" that were missing from the group's prior album, The Tape of Only Linda. Deming noted: > This new Loud Family sounded more like Scott Miller's backing band than the > group that made the first two albums, and without producer Mitch Easter on > hand, Miller seems to have used Interbabe Concern as an opportunity to > reacquaint himself with the cryptic side of his musical personality; there > are a lot more short pseudo-tunes interspersed between the \\"real\\" songs, > plenty of odd found noises and sound effects, and while Miller plays plenty > of guitar here, there's a decidedly lower hard-and-heavy quotient than on > the muscular The Tape of Only Linda. Interbabe Concern plays like a somewhat > stranger version of Loud Family's debut, Plants and Birds and Rocks and > Things ... the production has a lot less gloss, and Miller's fondness for > chaos seems to outweigh his knack for perfect pop hooks. According to Conner, \\"Miller arranges his songs like roller coasters; you always know where you're going to end up, but the time signatures and key changes throw you around on the way there.\\" Conner cited the song \\"Don't Respond, She Can Tell\\" as a \\"real kick with what sounds like a BB dropping on a table keeping time.\\" Reviewers found the album difficult; for example, Deming wrote, \\"It's an inarguably interesting album, but one that demands a lot more work for the listener to ferret out the good stuff.\\" Conner agreed, and emphasized the reward: \\"Miller cycles through incongruous guitar chords with the same bravery and success of Steely Dan, and he packs each song with one syllable for nearly every note. Some of these songs might play well with the top down, but those who like to listen too closely to their pop music will get more out of the Loud Family. And you'll have to ‚Äì it's not an easy album to make sense of on the first spin, but those brave enough to have another go likely will, like me, one day be astonished at how long the disc has been in one chamber of the disc changer.\\" CMJ New Music Monthly‚Ä≤s review categorized the music as \\"pop of the most depraved variety,\\" and wrote, \\"There‚Äôs always some jarring detail added or subtracted, some unsettling minor component that takes these tunes out of the realm of the normal. Gently plucked acoustic guitars will suddenly be ripped apart by a mutinous fuzzbox, seemingly at random.\\" The review continued, \\"If pop‚Äôs purpose is to soothe and delight, then this is either half-pop or fullblooded mutation/mutilation, as there‚Äôs nothing soothing about this in the least.

The tower's architecture and engineering were performed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill with Adrian D. Smith and Gordon Gill (now at their own firm, AS+GG) as architects. Ground broke on the tower on 8 September 2006 and construction was completed in March 2011. It is intended for office use and is partially occupied by the China National Tobacco Corporation. Architecture and design The design of the Pearl River Tower is intended to minimise harm to the environment and it will extract energy from the natural and passive forces surrounding the building. Major accomplishments are the technological integration of form and function in a holistic approach to engineering and architectural design. Sustainability The building is designed with energy conservation in mind, including wind turbines and solar collectors, photovoltaic cells, underfloor air distribution, and radiant heating and cooling ceilings. It is one of the most environmentally friendly buildings in the world. Of Pearl River Tower‚Äôs accomplishments, many are related to the sustainable design features include: * The largest radiant-cooled office building in the world * Most energy efficient super-tall building in the world * The tower is an example of China‚Äôs goal to reduce the intensity of carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP in 2020 by 40 to 45 percent as compared to the level of 2005. In a report presented at the 2008 Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat it was reported that the building's sustainable design features will allow a 58% energy usage reduction when compared to similar stand alone buildings. The building would have been able to be carbon neutral and actually sell power back to the surrounding neighborhood if the micro-turbines had been installed into the building. However the local power company in Guangzhou does not allow independent energy producers to sell electricity back to the grid. Without the financial incentive to add the micro-turbines the developers removed them from the design. If they had been added excess power would have been produced from the building, at the very least, after office hours when the power needed by the building itself had been reduced.

The Lavra fortification (; ) is a system of walls, towers and other constructions built for the protection of the Cave Monastery in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. History The fortification around the monastery first arouse at the end of the 12th century, when a 2 metre wide leave, 5 metre high stone wall was erected. This wall was destroyed during the Mongol invasion of Rus and was finally excavated by archeologists in 1951. After the Mongol invasion, the monastery was defended by wooden walls. In 1679, Hetman Ivan Samoylovych had a moat and new ramparts added to the fortification around the \\"upper monastery.\\" Hetman Ivan Mazepa financed the fortification's construction at the height of the Great Northern War, and had a thick stone wall with four towers added for protection of the monastery in case of Swedish attack. The total length of the walls was , thickness - , and height - . The fort had three gates, Holy gates with the Trinity Gate Church, Economy gates with the All Saints Church, and Southern gates or Caves gates. There were also four towers, Ivan Kushchnyk Tower, Onufriy Tower, Painter Tower, and Clock Tower. In 1706, Tsar Peter I ordered the construction of the so-called \\"Old Cave Fortress.\\" The earliest plans for the fortress were done by engineer named Gellert. It was completed in 1723, and consisted of a semicircular citadel with a 6 metre high earthen rampart, eight bulwarks, and other fortifications. The new fortress had an arsenal of 467 artillery guns, 27 mortars, and 3 howitzers. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the fortress was rebuilt again, particularly around the near and far caves. The new project was created by Otto von Freiman and carried out by Lieutenant Colonel Burman. The new walls were in length, three and half brick thick and high with a brick fundament deep. During that time, the Old Cave Fortress constructed in the 18th century was the base for the administrative and military institutions of the Russian Empire in the city. Constructions The fortification consisted of a total of four towers: * the Southwest Tower, also called the tower of Ivan Kushchnik, taken from the name of the church that was supposed to be constructed in the tower but was not built; * the South Tower, or the Horologium, also called the Clock Tower, because it had an installed clock up to 1818; * the North Tower, also called the Painting Tower, because it once held a paining studio; * and the East Tower containing the church of Saint Onufry, also called the Chamber Tower because at one time it contained Hetman Mazepa's chambers. Near the North Tower, there is a water tower, which is not part of the Lavra fortification system. It was designed by the architect V. Sychugov and constructed to ensure the Lavra's fresh water supply in 1879.

The Strider SMF was the first knife issued to an individual Marine Corps unit in over 60 years and the first tactical folder issued within the USMC. Materials and construction The SMF knife is manufactured by Strider Knives of Escondido, California. The knife features a drop point flat ground tiger striped blade of CPM S30V steel. The handle is composed of a fire anodized titanium frame, oil impregnated bronze bushings, an oversized pivot screw in diameter, and a textured G10 glass-reinforced plastic scale with an incorporated backspacer. The NATO Stock Number (NSN) for the SMF knife is 1095-01-531-5015. The latest version of this knife (generation 2 and above) includes the Hinderer Lockbar Stabilizer, a mechanism designed by custom knifemaker Rick Hinderer and licensed for use by Strider. The lockbar stabilizer is a metal disc contained in the titanium lockbar which is designed to preserve the life of the framelock by preventing overtravel and flex. The original knives designed for the Marines' SOCOM unit in 2003 do not include this feature, but subsequent versions do. MARSOC version The last time the Marine Corps issued a knife to an individual unit was in 1942, when a variation of the Fairbairn-Sykes fighting knife was redesigned by Lieutenant Colonel Clifford H. Shuey and produced by the Camillus Cutlery Company of Camillus, New York. That knife was called the United States Marine Raider Stiletto and was issued to Marine Raiders until the unit was disbanded in 1944.1 When DET-1 was formed and their equipment being chosen, they decided not to use the traditional Marine Ka-Bar nor did they go with a dagger design as the Marine Raiders had been issued 60 years previously. Instead they chose Strider's SMF folding knife as their issued blade. The MARSOC SMF knife is marked with the date of the Marine unit's activation (030620 or 20 June 2003) as well as \\"DET-1\\" on the frame. In addition, the Military version bears the insignia of the Marine Raiders. The initial run of this model consisted of 300 knives. 150 for the men in the unit and 150 similarly marked knives for collectors whose purchase offset the cost of the knives for the military. There are several small differences between the military and civilian versions of this knife. Military issued knives had no letter in the serial number, whereas the civilian counterpart was preceded by a \\"C\\" in the serial number. Approximately 12 prototype models were produced with an ‚ÄúXM‚Äù preceding the serial number. The Marine version also features a Coyote Brown colored G-10 scale whereas the Civilian version's scale is made of black G-10. The Civilian version also lacks the Marine Raider Insignia which is stamped on the blade of the Marine version. After rigorous field testing, including parachute jumps, the unit's Commanding Officer, Colonel Robert Coates remarked that the knife was \\"selected by, built for, and issued to the Marine Corps SOCOM Detachment.\\" Users * : MCSOCOM Detachment One of the United States Marine Corps See also Lists: * List of weapons of the U.S. Marine Corps * List of individual weapons of the U.S. Armed Forces References Footnotes * Note 1: According to Pat Rogers: \\"An example of this is the fact that for only the second time in Marine Corps history, a knife was selected by, built for and issued to a specific Marine Corps unit‚Äîthe Strider MCSOCCOM.

An aggressive late-order left-handed batsman and a bowler of slow left-arm wrist-spin and googlies (of two varieties), Walsh was brought out of Australian club cricket in 1936 to play as one of the professionals in the side taken by the Nottinghamshire cricket impresario Sir Julien Cahn to tour Sri Lanka. Cahn's sides played some first-class matches on this and other tours and in English seasons across the 1930s and over the next three years, Walsh took more than 600 wickets for Cahn's sides, touring New Zealand in 1938-39 and playing three seasons in England. He also played a few county matches as an amateur for Leicestershire. In 1946, with Cahn having died, Walsh returned to England and became for the next 10 years a professional with Leicestershire, regularly being the county's highest wicket-taker and enlivening many innings with a robust approach to batting. He took more than 100 wickets in seven of those seasons and his total of 170 wickets in 1948 is still the Leicestershire county record for a single season. In 1952, he also scored 1106 runs, to complete the all-rounder's double for the season. He bowled left-handed wrist spin, with two googlies: \\"one, which could easily be detected, to lull the batsman into a sense of security, when he would unleash the other, which was calculated to deceive even the greatest batsmen\\".Wisden 1981, p. 1150.

Born in Munich, he studied in that Bavarian city with Emmanuel Kirschner before joining the Munich Opera in 1892, debuting in Lortzing's Der Waffenschmied. Munich remained his base for the rest of the 19th century, although he did also appear at other German opera houses during this period. Gradually Knote's voice, which had begun as a light lyric tenor, grew in size and stamina. By 1900, he was able to undertake Manrico in Verdi's Il trovatore as well as heavy Wagner roles. The seeds of Knote's international reputation as a top-flight exponent of Wagnerian operatic parts were planted in 1901 when he sang for the first time at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Although his debut season was not an unqualified success, he showed considerable promise, and he was invited back by Covent Garden's management, appearing there again in 1903, 1907‚Äì08, and 1913. During these subsequent Covent Garden seasons he sang even more impressively than he had during his first London season, and was now much admired in the Wagnerian roles of Tristan, Siegfried, Tannhauser, Erik, Walther and Lohengrin. Knote made his American debut at the Metropolitan Opera on 3 December 1904 in Die Meistersinger. He was so successful in this and other Wagner operas that during his three seasons with the Met company, his popularity was said to have almost rivalled that of the Met's superstar tenors Enrico Caruso and, from the previous generation, Jean de Reszke. Surprisingly enough, Knote never sang at the Bayreuth Festival. (His legato-based method of singing would not have been a good fit in any case with Bayreuth's then favoured sprechgesang style of vocalism.) He did, however, enter into a contract with the artistically esteemed Dresden Opera; but this was cancelled suddenly in 1909 after a dispute with management. Knote spent the First World War period in Germany and became the principal tenor of the Charlottenburg Opera in 1917. After the war, Munich once again became his artistic home although he was engaged for a short time by the Hamburg Opera. He sang in the United States for the last time in 1923-24, appearing as Tristan, Walther and Rienzi with a German opera company. He retired from the operatic stage in Munich in 1932 and taught singing. At the age of 82, he died in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Knote had a handsome stage presence and possessed a strong, smooth, resonant voice with a lively, but rarely intrusive, vibrato.

The building, which is the headquarters of Surrey County Council, is a landmark in Kingston and is a Grade II listed building. History The council chamber in County Hall The building was commissioned to replace an earlier Sessions House at Newington Causeway in Newington which had been completed in 1791. Following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established councils in every county, it became necessary to find a meeting place for Surrey County Council. However as Newington formed part of the County of London from 1889 and therefore lay outside the area administered by the council, county leaders chose to procure a new purpose-built county headquarters. By 1890 six towns were being considered: Epsom, Guildford, Kingston, Redhill, Surbiton and Wimbledon.The Times, 27 March 1890 The site selected had previously formed part of the Woodbines Estate in Kingston. Construction work on the new building began in 1891. It was designed by Charles Henry Howell, County Surveyor and partner in Howell and Brooks, in the classical style, was built by Higgs and Hill and was officially opened with bands playing on 13 November 1893. Access was from Grove Road, which was renamed Penrhyn Road, in honour of the first chairman of the county council, Edward Penrhyn. The design for the original building (the north east section of the current complex), which was faced in Portland stone, involved an asymmetrical main frontage with seven bays facing onto Penrhyn Road; the central section featured an arched doorway which was projected forward and a clock tower with a belfry and a dome above. There were sculptures by Farmer and Brindley on the face of the building. Inside the principal rooms were the council chamber and the clerk to the council's office. An extension to the west of the original block, designed by E. Vincent Harris, was opened by the Duke of Gloucester in 1930. The Ashcombe Block, which created a quadrangle behind the original block, was completed in 1938. The Ashcombe Block was destroyed by a flying bomb in July 1944 and rebuilt in 1953. Further additions, which created a second quadrangle to the south, were completed in 1982. Following local government reorganisation in 1965, County Hall was no longer within the administrative county of Surrey, but within the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames in Greater London. County leaders again developed ambitions to move the county administration to a location that was actually within the county of Surrey. In July 2003 the county council decided to procure new facilities in Woking in Surrey and to sell County Hall;Relocation of Surrey County Hall Moves Closer that project, which would have been procured under a private finance initiative contract, was abandoned because of its high cost in January 2006. In November 2018 the county council resurrected proposals to move to Woking, this time under a traditional contract, and to sell County Hall in Kingston. Film location Film and television productions that have made use of County Hall for location filming have included: ;Films *Vera Drake (2004) *102 Dalmatians (2000) *Keeping Mum (2005) ;Television *The Wrong Mans *Midsomer Murders *Silk *Call the Midwife *The Bill *Ashes to Ashes *Jonathan Creek *Criminal Justice *Top Boy *Downton Abbey *Silent Witness *Saxondale References K Category:Buildings and structures in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Category:Local government in Surrey Category:Local government buildings in London Category:Government buildings completed in 1893 ","title":"County Hall, Kingston upon Thames"},{"id":"8103049","text":"Sherian Grace Cadoria (born January 26, 1943 in Marksville, Louisiana) is a retired United States Army officer.

Flip-Chip electronic modules were components of digital logic systems made by the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) for its PDP-7, PDP-8, PDP-9, and PDP-10, beginning on August 24, 1964. The trademark \\"Flip-Chip\\"' was filed on August 27, 1964. Various manuals produced by DEC refer to the modules as \\"FLIP CHIP\\", \\"FLIP-CHIP\\", \\"Flip Chip\\", and \\"Flip-Chip\\", with trademark and registered trademark symbols. As used by DEC, the term described a proprietary way of packaging electronic circuitry which was used for central processing units, peripheral controllers, and many other digital or analog electronic products produced by the company. The first flip-chip modules mated with single-sided 18-contact card edge connectors with contacts on 1/8 inch centers. Circuit boards were 2 7/16 inches wide by 5 inches long, with a handle adding 1/2 inch. Double modules with two connectors end to end were 5 3/16 inches wide. Later, when two-sided boards were introduced, upwards- compatible double-sided 36-contact edge connectors were used, but the basic connector and board dimensions remained unchanged. If more component real estate area were required for electronic circuitry, the \\"standard-length\\" modules would be supplemented by \\"extended-length\\" modules. The company eventually produced quad-height (4 connectors) and hex-height (6 connectors) modules as larger circuit boards came into use; these larger boards often included metal levers to handle the larger forces need to insert or extract the boards from mating backplane connectors. The modular circuit boards were integrated into larger systems by plugging them into backplanes composed of DEC's proprietary Flip-Chip connectors. These connectors were in turn typically interconnected via a soldered printed circuit backplane, or by wirewrapping, or by both methods. Troubleshooting would narrow down a fault to the module level, and a defective or suspected faulty module would be replaced by a known-good one, to repair a malfunctioning computer system. The modules were called \\"Flip-Chips\\" because early versions of some of these modules, for example, the R107 module shown, used hybrid integrated circuits built using flip chip mounting of individual diode chips on a ceramic substrate. Some boards containing flip chip modules were etched and drilled to allow those modules to be replaced by discrete components.See, for example, the S111, component side, solder side. At some points during production, conventional discrete components may have replaced these flip-chip devices, but the early use of hybrid integrated circuits allowed DEC to market the PDP-8 as an integrated circuit computer.Digital Equipment Corporation, advertisement, Computers and Automation April 1965; pages 6-7. When DEC began to use monolithic integrated circuits, they continued to refer to their circuit boards as \\"Flip-Chip\\" modules, despite the fact that actual flip chip mounting was not used. DEC continued to hold the \\"Flip-Chip\\" trademark until June 6, 1987, when it was allowed to expire.

The automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells motor vehicles. United Kingdom The Vauxhall Astra was redesigned with the third-generation model in October 1991, seven years after the launch of the second generation model. It was available in 1.4, 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0 petrol engines as well as a 1.7 diesel (turbo or non-turbo). The 2.0 version came with 8-valve for the 2.0i CD and 2.0 SRi, while the 16-valve version came in the 130 mph+ GSi. All models got fuel injection as standard, as Britain prepared for the legislation which outlawed the sale of carburettor-engined cars after 1992.Also, parent brand Opel adopted the Astra name for the new car in Europe, ending the use of the long-running Kadett nameplate. In November, Vauxhall launched a new, small four-wheel-drive model, the Frontera which was offered as 3-door Sport or 5-door versions with a choice of a 2.4 petrol or a 2.3 diesel engine and was manufactured at its Luton plant. The Ford Motor Company introduced a Cosworth version of the Granada Scorpio and Escort, as well as the new generation Escort XR3i. It has also revived the RS2000 nameplate for the Escort range, with a new 2.0 16-valve Zetec model that was capable of more than 130 mph. There was also a new estate version of the Granada Scorpio which launched in early 1992. Rover updated its 800 Series executive model in November which now had a top speed of 135 mph on the turbocharged 2.0 Vitesse model. It also dropped the MG badge from faster versions of the Maestro and Montego models, which were now largely sold as budget offerings alongside the 200 and 400, but the MG badge was brought back for sale in 1992 on a remodelled, limited edition version of the MG B. France Peugeot launched a new entry-level model in November 1991 - the 106 \\\\- to slot into the range below the 205. With 1.1 and 1.4 petrol engines as well as a 1.5 diesel, the 106 was initially sold as only a three-door model. It was sold as a cheaper, more modern, though slightly smaller, alternative to the larger 205. Although the 205 was to continue for a few more years, the 309 would be replaced by 1993 with a new hatchback to be called the 306. Citro√´n reentered the small family car market with its new ZX in March, launching in the UK in May which was the first of two replacements for the slightly larger BX. It comes with 1.4, 1.6 and 2.0 petrol engines and 1.9 diesels (turbo or non-turbo). Renault launched its new Clio supermini in the UK in March. The range was expanded with the launch of a 1.8 16-valve hot hatch that was capable of 126 mph as the successor to the discontinued R5 Turbo. The second- generation Espace people carrier launched and received a V6 engine for the first time, while there was also a minor redesign of the R19 small family hatchback and saloon. Italy Alfa Romeo gave a facelift to its 33 entry- level model, which had been on sale since 1983. Japan Nissan launched the Sunny which was available as a three-door hatchback, five-door liftback and five-door estate. The Sunny's chassis also formed the basis of the 100NX coupe. A replacement for the long-running Micra was planned for the following year, joining the Primera at the Sunderland plant. Honda launched a new version of its Civic family car. The new range includes a three-door hatchback and four-door saloon, and a five-door version of the Rover-based Concerto, which had been on sale for two years. Meanwhile, the current Accord was the year's best selling car in the United States. Germany Volkswagen launched the MK3 Golf in August 1991, although UK sales would not start until February 1992. The new model was voted European Car of the Year. The Golf GTI was available as only a 1.8 16-valve, which is capable of 125 mph. The Golf VR6 was launched, a 2.8 engined hatchback capable of 140 mph. Audi redesigned its 80 and 100 ranges. A new cabriolet version of the 80 also went on sale.

Brief history The program began in 1996, when FSN was launched, as Fox Sports News. The show aired twice a night, at 6 and 10 p.m, and also aired in the mornings from 6 to 9 a.m. It was the national network's equivalent to SportsCenter. The tagline leading into all commercial breaks for the first year or so was \\"Fox Sports News rolls on.\\" The show broadcast from stage 2 of the Fox Television Center in Los Angeles. By 2000, the show was renamed to the National Sports Report and the shows were cut to a half-hour each. The Sunday night program was briefly renamed The Keith Olbermann Evening News. The hour-long show was anchored by Olbermann, the former ESPN sportscaster, with Alex Flanagan as a reporter. Kevin Frazier (now at Entertainment Tonight) was famous for refusing to say the name of tennis phenom Anna Kournikova on-air because she had never won a singles tournament. Instead, he used nicknames like \\"Miss Thang\\" or \\"From Russia With Love\\" (as in the James Bond movie). Frazier wanted to make a point that she was overrated and received too much publicity for her lack of talent. On April 1, 2001, Olbermann reported that Michael Jordan had decided to come out of retirement and return to NBA basketball with the Washington Wizards. Although the story was presented as an April Fool's joke, Jordan would sign with the Wizards the following September. Regional sports reports By 2000, many markets paired the NSR with a series of \\"regional sports reports.\\" In fact, all regions had their own reports in 2001, originating at the following studios: *New York: New York *Boston: New England *Pittsburgh: Pittsburgh, Midwest *Atlanta: Southern, Arizona *Dallas: Southwest *Chicago: Chicago, Bay Area, and Ohio *Denver: Rocky Mountain *Los Angeles: Southern California, Minnesota *Seattle: Northwest, Detroit The Southwest Sports Report was originally broadcast from two studios, with the other in Houston. This occurred because co-host Spencer Tillman apparently did not want to uproot his family from Houston. Cancellation In 2002, the NSR was cancelled outright and only the regional reports remained. FSN would not \\"replace\\" the show until FSN Final Score debuted on July 3, 2006. None of the regional reports exist today, or hardly resemble the original report format. In 2002, Cablevision, which owns several FSN affiliates (those under their control are now under the AT&T; SportsNet branding), removed them from the networks they owned at the time, including New York (now still owned by Cablevision as MSG Plus), Chicago (now defunct), Bay Area (now owned by Comcast as Comcast SportsNet Bay Area), and Ohio (now owned by Fox Sports Group directly) reports from the air. The New England Sports Report remains as a talk show called New England Sports Tonight since Comcast's acquisition of the network as Comcast SportsNet New England, though a separate news program called SportsNet Central has since launched. In many of the remaining markets, it has been replaced by FSN Live, though in most cases this show is exclusively a team post-game show rather than a regular program, with the team name replacing FSN, and news tickers mostly fulfill the news role for most FSN networks, along with promotions since 2013 guiding viewers to sister network Fox Sports 1's national sports news show (and direct successor to NSR), Fox Sports Live (which has also been cancelled as of 2017).

In 1970, he was posted to Nicosia and returned to London after three years. He was appointed Counsellor at Jedda in 1975, and moved to Athens in 1977. He became Head of the FCO's Near East and North African Department in 1980. He was appointed HM Ambassador to Libya in 1984, where he broke off diplomatic relations after the murder of WPC Yvonne Fletcher outside the Libyan embassy in London. Later in 1984, Miles moved to the UK Mission to the United Nations, New York and, from 1985 to 1988, he was Ambassador to Luxembourg.The Diplomatic Service List 1989 (page 253), HMSO, After two years' secondment at the Northern Ireland Office in Belfast he became the first Director-General of the Joint Directorate for Overseas Trade Services, a new unit set up to improve British Government services to exporters, and travelled widely both in Britain and abroad. At the same time he was a non-executive Director of Vickers Defence Systems. From 1993 to 1996 Miles was Ambassador to Greece. Miles was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1984 New Year Honours. Retirement After retiring from HM Diplomatic Service in 1996 Miles joined MEC International, a consultancy promoting business with the Middle East, and became chairman a decade later. He was for some years president of the Society for Libyan Studies, a learned society under the aegis of the British Academy, and chairman of HOST, a charity which arranges visits to British homes for foreign students in Britain. From 2004 to 2019 he was Deputy Chairman of the Libyan British Business Council, set up with the approval of the British and Libyan Governments to promote trade and investment. Controversy In April 2004, Miles initiated a controversial letter to Prime Minister, Tony Blair, signed by 52 retired ambassadors and calling for a new approach to policy in Palestine and Iraq. Subsequently, he wrote a long series of articles that were published in The Guardian. An article in August 2008, entitled \\"The long road to normalisation\\", asked rhetorically whether the recently signed compensation agreement between the United States and Libya would work. The article concluded: > The most important compensation issue, Lockerbie, has been settled on the > basis that Libya agreed to hand over two suspects for trial in the Scottish > courts and to accept responsibility for their actions. One was acquitted, > the other convicted, but his conviction has been called into question by the > Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission. There is the possibility of a > retrial, and it remains to be seen what effect that might have on the > Libya/America soap opera. On 22 November 2009, The Independent on Sunday published an article by Miles in which he partly questioned the appointment of two British Jewish historians, Sir Lawrence Freedman and Sir Martin Gilbert, to the Iraq inquiry panel because of their background and support for Israel.

When Crumbo was 17, he began studying art at the Chilocco Indian Agricultural School, also taking up the study of the Kiowa ceremonial wooden flute. Later he soloed on this instrument in performance with the Wichita Symphony. At the age of 19, Crumbo earned a scholarship to the Wichita American Indian Institute. He graduated three years later as valedictorian. Crumbo continued his studies at Wichita University from 1933 to 1936, where he studied mural technique with Olle Nordmark, watercolor with Clayton Staples, and painting and drawing with Oscar Jacobson. In 1936 Crumbo enrolled at the University of Oklahoma, where he studied for two years with Oscar Jacobson.\\"Biography from the AskART.com\\" (retrieved 2012-04-03) Professional career While studying art, Crumbo supported himself as a Native American dancer. He toured reservations across the United States in the early 1930s disseminating and collecting traditional dances. His art career was affirmed when Susie Peters, his mentor from his days at the Chilocco Indian School sold a number of his paintings to the San Francisco Museum of Art. Subsequently, Crumbo joined the Bacone College in Muskogee as Director of Art from 1938-1941, succeeding Acee Blue Eagle. In 1939, the U. S. Department of the Interior, which includes the Bureau of Indian Affairs as one of its constituent agencies, commissioned him to paint murals on the walls of its building in Washington D.

He was commissioned to paint two murals in the U.S.S. Oklahoma, which were both destroyed when the battleship was attacked and sunk at Pearl Harbor. With From 1948 to 1960, Crumbo lived in Taos, New Mexico. He exhibited at numerous shows and became more widely known both nationally and internationally because he adapted some of his work to techniques of engraving and printing, making multiple originals. In the 1950s, Crumbo bought a $3 mail-order mineral identification kit; he took up prospecting with fellow artist Max Evans. The two found deposits of ore worth millions, including a vein of beryllium that the New Mexico School of Mines identified at the time as \\"among the greatest beryllium finds in the nation.\\" Crumbo became \\"a major stockholder in Taos Uranium and Exploration Corp. that was formed by a group of Texas investors to develop the claims\\" for beryllium and copper. With his first interest as art, Crumbo served as Assistant Director of the El Paso, Texas Museum of Art from 1960‚Äì1967 and briefly as Director in 1968. He left to work independently at art and explore humanitarian efforts. He aided the Isleta Pueblo Indians of New Mexico to gain federal recognition and donated money to help the Potawatomi build a cultural heritage center near Shawnee. In 1973 he took up residence near Checotah, Oklahoma, where he continued to create and to promote Native American art. In 1978, he was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame.

Operating in 190 countries with locations across America, Europe and APAC, it employs 117 people around the world and provides its services to over 135 customers. Kollective‚Äôs technology is characterized as peer-assisted because it uses a combination of central servers and peer-to- peer communications. The company‚Äôs software-defined network is used to distribute traditionally high-bandwidth video and software content to the edge of corporate IT networks. Formerly Kontiki, the company rebranded as Kollective following a major restructuring of its products and services in March 2015.  History  Kontiki (later Kollective) was founded in November 2000. From then to its acquisition, Kontiki raised $46.5 million in investment. In March 2006, the company was acquired by VeriSign (now Symantec) for $62 million in a cash deal. Kontiki focused on the enterprise business, but during the VeriSign years, it also had a consumer-focused division, which was responsible for technology integration with products such as the BBC iPlayer. In May 2008, VeriSign, as part of a divestiture, sold Kontiki to MK Capital for $1 million and 3.98 million shares (an undetermined fraction of the spun-out company). According to that report, the rumored price was $40 million. Since breaking away from VeriSign, the company focused on their enterprise business. Kontiki raised another $10.7 million in funding in 2010. The round was led by MK Capital and joined by New World Ventures and Cross Creek Capital, an affiliate of Wasatch Advisors. In March 2015, Kontiki rebranded following a merger with Kollective ‚Äì an Oregon-based enterprise content delivery company. Kollective now has locations in Oregon, Silicon Valley, London, Singapore, Tokyo, Bangalore and D√ºsseldorf. The company‚Äôs product portfolio has since expanded beyond video distribution to include software distribution, operating system deployment and enterprise content delivery.

Description The streambank froglet is a small frog (2.5 centimetres measured from snout to posterior). The colouring can be red, brown, tan, to drab olive green colour with many shades in between. Like its relatives Crinia signifera, this frog is of extremely variable markings, with great variety usually found within confined populations. The dorsal and ventral surfaces are very variable. The dorsal surface may be smooth or warty. The tympanum of this frog is not visible. The colour under the throat is pale grey, the ventral surface backwards from the front legs is white with granular, mottled black. Distribution The streambank froglet is found only in the area around the Flinders Ranges and Gammon Ranges National Parks of central South Australia. It is found most often under rocks in springfed waterholes or cobbled pools in intermittently flowing streambeds. Ecology and behaviour Because of the seasonality of the rain, and periodic flooding, the tadpoles of these frogs have sucker mouthparts and a streamlined, flattened profile adapted to hold on to the rocks even in canyons where water can be funneled into flowing very rapidly. The call of the male is a barely audible 'creeeak-crek' described as sounding like a creaking hinge. The diet of the species consists of small insects, much smaller in comparison to their size to most frogs.

Someone with PRES may experience headache, changes in vision, and seizures, with some developing other neurological symptoms such as confusion or weakness of one or more limbs. The name of the condition includes the word \\"posterior\\" because it predominantly though not exclusively affects the back of the brain (the parietal and occipital lobes). Common underlying causes are severely elevated blood pressure, kidney failure, severe infections, certain medications, some autoimmune diseases, and pre-eclampsia. The diagnosis is usually made by brain scan (MRI) on which areas of swelling can be identified. The treatment for PRES is supportive: removal of the cause or causes and treatment of any of the complications, such as anticonvulsants for seizures. PRES may be complicated by intracranial hemorrhage, but this is relatively rare. The majority of people recover fully, although some may experience some residual symptoms. PRES was first described in 1996. Signs and symptoms PRES usually has an acute onset. Most people with PRES experience headaches and seizures; many also experience visual changes, confusion and drowsiness, weakness of the arm and/or leg on one side of the body (hemiplegia), difficulty speaking, or more rarely other neurological symptoms. The visual changes in PRES may include hemianopsia (inability to see the left or right part of the visual field), blurred vision, lack of visual awareness on one side, visual hallucinations, and cortical blindness. Seizures occur in about two thirds of cases. In children this is more common still, at 90%. If seizures occur they may be focal or generalized. A small proportion develops status epilepticus, where seizures are not controlled with simple measures. Causes Causes that may contribute to the development of PRES are: immunosuppression (especially for organ transplantation, e.g. with tacrolimus), severe infection and/or sepsis, chemotherapy, autoimmune disease, and pre-eclampsia. High blood pressure is often present. Similarly, the majority of people with PRES have an impaired kidney function, and 21% are receiving regular hemodialysis. In PRES related to medications, there may be an interval of weeks to months between the initiation of the treatment and the development of PRES. After a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (bone marrow transplant) the risk of PRES is approximately 8%, whereas the risk is lower (0.4-6%) after a solid organ transplant. The following autoimmune conditions have been found to be associated with PRES: thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sj√∂gren syndrome, polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), Crohn's disease and neuromyelitis optica (NMO), as well as hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). A number of other associations have also been reported, including some other groups of medications, blood transfusion, elevated calcium levels, decreased magnesium levels, postpartum cerebral angiopathy, and drugs of abuse (cocaine and amphetamine). It has been suggested that PRES is identical or closely related with hypertensive encephalopathy, the presence of neurological symptoms in those with a hypertensive emergency. Mechanism While the precise mechanism is PRES is not fully understood, it is considered to be related to a problem with the blood vessels of the brain. There are several theories as to why these blood vessels may become inappropriately permeable and allow the surrounding brain tissue to become swollen. The \\"vasogenic\\" theory posits that extremely high blood pressure overcomes the normal capability of blood vessels in the brain to maintain a normal cerebral blood flow. The excessive pressure damages the endothelial layer and the blood-brain barrier, leading to swelling (edema). This predominantly affects the \\"posterior\\" parts of the brain which is more susceptible. The \\"vasogenic\\" theory seems to explain the almost 50% of cases of PRES where there had been severely elevated blood pressure. It is also called the \\"breakthrough\\" theory, or the \\"hyperperfusion theory\\". This theory does not explain the edema in many other cases where the blood pressure has been normal or even low; in fact, the edema tends to be more severe in those without abnormally elevated blood pressure. In PRES secondary to other causes, the blood vessel damage has been attributed to other mechanisms. The \\"cytotoxic\\" theory suggests that it is direct cell damage by toxins (usually medications) that precipitates the edema. The \\"immunogenic\\" theory suggests a role for the immune system (specifically T cells). Some consider the cytotoxic and immunogenic theories together as a single \\"toxic\\" theory. There appears to be a role of cytokines in causing endothelial dysfunction. Finally, according to the \\"neuropeptide/cerebral vasoconstriction\\" theory, some specific substances (endothelin 1, thromboxane A2) trigger spasm of the blood vessels with resultant vessel wall damage and edema. The latter hypothesis is supported by the frequent finding of diffuse blood vessel spasms (vasoconstriction) in many people with PRES, and the evidence for decreased perfusion, although the spasm may also be a consequence of the blood vessel damage rather than the cause. Some, therefore, include the vasospasm in the \\"toxic\\" theory. It is considered likely that these multiple mechanisms all potentially play a role in the development of PRES. Diagnosis There are no formal diagnostic criteria for PRES, but it has been proposed that PRES can be diagnosed if someone has developed acute neurological symptoms (seizure, altered mental state, headache, visual disturbances) together with one or more known risk factors, typical appearance on brain imaging (or normal imaging), and no other alternative diagnosis. Some consider that the abnormalities need to be shown to be reversible. If lumbar puncture is performed this may show increased protein levels but no white blood cells. Computed tomography scanning may be performed in the first instance; this may show low density white matter areas in the posterior lobes. The diagnosis is typically made with magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. The findings most characteristic for PRES are symmetrical hyperintensities on T2-weighed imaging in the parietal and occipital lobes; this pattern is present in more than half of all cases. FLAIR sequences can be better at showing these abnormalities. Some specific other rare patterns have been described: the superior frontal sulcus (SFS) watershed pattern, a watershed pattern involving the entire hemisphere (holohemispheric), and a central pattern with vasogenic oedema in the deep white matter, basal ganglia, thalami, brainstem and pons. These distinct patterns do not generally correlate with the nature of the symptoms or their severity, although severe edema may suggest a poorer prognosis. If the appearances are not typical, other causes for the symptoms and the imaging abnormalities need to considered before PRES can be diagnosed conclusively. In many cases there is evidence of constriction of the blood vessels (if angiography is performed), suggesting a possible overlap with reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS). Diffusion MRI may be used to identify areas of cytotoxic edema caused by poor blood flow (ischemia) but it is not clear if this prognostically relevant. Abnormal apparent diffusion coefficient is seen in about 20% of cases. In 10‚Äì25% of cases of PRES there is evidence of hemorrhage on neuroimaging. Various types of hemorrhage may occur: hemorrhage into the brain tissue itself (intraparenchymal hemorrhage), sulcal subarachnoid hemorrhage, and microbleeds. Treatment There is no direct treatment for PRES, other than removing or treating any underlying cause. For instance, immunosuppressive medication may need to be withheld. 40% of all people with PRES are unwell enough to require intensive care unit admission for close observation and treatment of complications. Those with seizures are administered anticonvulsants. If there is a hypertensive emergency, the blood pressure is lowered by 20-30% using continuous infusion of a blood pressure lowering drug with close monitoring. Of the blood pressure lowering agents available, nitrates may need to be avoided as there is a concern that this may aggravate the PRES even while lowering the blood pressure. In PRES secondary to pre-eclampsia, magnesium sulfate may be administered. Prognosis With adequate treatment, 70-90% of people with PRES make a full recovery within hours to days. 8‚Äì17% of people with PRES die, although this is not always a direct consequence of the PRES. Of those who have residual symptoms after PRES, this is attributable largely to hemorrhage. Non-resolution of MRI abnormalities has been linked with poorer outcomes. If PRES was caused by pre- eclampsia the prognosis is better than in PRES due to other causes. Factors that predict poorer prognosis are the person's age, the level of C-reactive protein in the blood (a marker of inflammation), altered mental state at the time of diagnosis, and altered markers of coagulation. People with diabetes may have a worse outcome, and abnormalities in the corpus callosum on MRI have been linked with worse prognosis. Some patterns on electroencephalography (EEG) are also associated with a poorer outcome. After an episode of PRES, even when it was associated with seizure activity, only a small proportion of people remains at risk of ongoing seizures and the majority can eventually discontinue anticonvulsant treatment. Epidemiology The incidence (number of cases per year) of PRES is not known, but increasing use of MRI scans has led to increased recognition. History PRES was first described in 1996 in a group of 15 patients identified retrospectively in the records of the New England Medical Center in Boston and H√¥pital Sainte Anne in Paris. The name was revised in 2000 from \\"leukencephalopathy\\" to \\"encephalopathy\\" as the former suggested that it only affects the white matter of the brain, which is not the case.

The technique consists of using a motor vehicle containing mobile radio network air interface measurement equipment that can detect and record a wide variety of the physical and virtual parameters of mobile cellular service in a given geographical area. By measuring what a wireless network subscriber would experience in any specific area, wireless carriers can make directed changes to their networks that provide better coverage and service to their customers. Drive testing requires a mobile vehicle outfitted with drive testing measurement equipment. The equipment are usually highly specialized electronic devices that interface to OEM mobile handsets. This ensures measurements are realistic and comparable to actual user experiences. Data collected during drive testing Drive test equipment typically collects data relating to the network itself, services running on the network such as voice or data services, radio frequency scanner information and GPS information to provide location logging. The data set collected during drive testing field measurements can include information such as:Drive testing for LTE *Signal levels *Signal quality *Interference *Dropped calls *Blocked calls *Anomalous events *Call statistics *Service level statistics *Quality of Service information *Handover information *Neighboring cell information *GPS location co-ordinates Types of drive testing Drive testing can broadly be categorized into three distinct topics: *Network benchmarking. *Optimization and troubleshooting *Service quality monitoring. The result produced by drive testing for each of these purposes is different. Network benchmarking For benchmarking, sophisticated multi-channel tools such as Focus Infocom's DMTS and XGMA, DingLi Communications' Pilot Fleet, Ascom's Symphony, Rohde & Schwarz-SwissQual's Diversity Benchmarker, Keysight Nemo Invex II, or RantCell application based QoE drive test benchmarking tool are used to measure several network technologies and service types simultaneously to very high accuracy, to provide directly comparable information regarding competitive strengths and weaknesses. Results from benchmarking activities, such a comparative coverage analysis or comparative data network speed analysis, are frequently used in marketing campaigns. Drive testing to gather network bench-marking data is the only way mobile network operators can collect accurate competitive data on the true level of their own and their competitors technical performance and quality levels. Optimization and troubleshooting Optimization and troubleshooting information is more typically used to aid in finding specific problems during the rollout phases of new networks or to observe specific problems reported by consumers during the operational phase of the network lifecycle. In this mode drive testing data is used to diagnose the root cause of specific, typically localized, network issues such as dropped calls or missing neighbour cell assignments. Service quality monitoring Service quality monitoring typically involves making test calls across the network to a fixed test unit to assess the relative quality of various services using Mean opinion score (MOS). Quality monitoring focuses on the end user experience of the service, and allows mobile network operators to react to what effectively subjective quality degradations by investigating the technical cause of the problem in time-correlated data collected during the drive test. Service quality monitoring is typically carried out in an automated fashion, using devices that run largely without human intervention carried in vehicles that regularly ply typical drive testing routes such as garbage collection vehicles, taxis or buses. Drive testing can be conducted at any time on a live network and very rarely will there be any network intrusion.  Classification of drive testing based on use cases  * Single site verification (SSV) or Single Cell Function Test (SCFT) * Multiple site verification (MSV) or cluster drive test * Operator benchmarking drive test (Market level drive test)  Single site verification (SSV) or Single Cell Function Test (SCFT)  SSV drive test or SCFT drive test is all about performing 5G/4G/3G drive test analysis on a particular site (Example newly installed cell tower) and this is usually performed by drive testing or by walk testing around the site. In site level testing, site is ready for performing SSV testing after completion of engineering, installation and integration and no active alarms are observed. The main aim of SSV testing is to validate functional performance of the site and identify/flag workmanship issues, product issues & provisioning issues before turning the site on for commercial users.  Multiple site verification (MSV) or Cluster drive test  As the name suggests, network tests like drive test 3G, 4G LTE drive test, 5G drive test when performed on a group of cells is termed as a ‚ÄòCluster drive test‚Äô or ‚ÄòMSV‚Äô. Initially, in traditional drive test, network testers used to drive along target routes to collect information regarding coverage data through various iterations and field tests with cellular rf drive test equipment. But, as telecom businesses are expanding, it is cumbersome to refine expanded networks in terms of size, capacity, and number of users. With cluster drive test, operators can perform network tests by taking a group of cells and deploy it in a particular location and investigate the network accordingly. Cluster drive test is executed when the network is in active mode (i.e. providing service to customers) and inspect the interference amid two cells and handover taking place or not. Network parameter details like Drive Route, Quality plots of RSRQ, SINR, PUSCH, Coverage plot, Download and Upload throughput is accumulated. Operators use this data to get output which is further utilized to optimize the mobile network and deliver efficient service to users. Multiple site verification or 4G LTE drive test must have measurements of radio parameters such as RSRP, RSRQ, SINR, PCI, EARFCN, and WCDMA drive test parameters like RSCP, RSSI, ECNO, PSC, UARFCN etc. at least at basic level to identify primary network issues.  Operator benchmarking drive test (Market level drive test)  In this test, comparison is done in terms of number of call drops, data throughput, and other key KPIs on 4G / 5G networks between various network operators and analyse who is providing better user experience. Usually market level drive testing is performed by operators themselves/ independent bodies/ telecom regulators. For example, telecom regulators from various countries constantly perform market level drive test to identify under performing operators whose user experience KPIs are not meeting regulatory requirements. ‚ÄòMarket level drive test‚Äô analysis is carried out based on a particular market or an entire geographical area with the use of 5G, 3G, CDMA, LTE drive test tools. Operators conduct drive testing on an area to analyse user experience with respect to other cellular service providers. Market level drive testing can identify their strengths, example high data throughput compared to competitors and this provides them an opportunity to up-sell their services by advertisement campaigns. In recent times, 5G deployment across the globe has increased the demand for 5G drive test parameters such as 4x4 mimo, massive mimo etc and now 5G NR to a must- have feature on a RF drive test tool.  Must-have features of RF drive test tool  * Drive test solution must support capture of GPS information along the drive route. * Must support 2G, 3G, 4G LTE and 5G NR measurements. * Data testing such as HTTP, latency and FTP speed tests. * Voice and SMS testing must be supported. * Video streaming testing support on mobile network will be an added advantage. * Frequency scanning function for all RAN technology. * Layer 3 and Layer 2 messaging capture capabilities if RF deep diagnosis information is required. * Script based call and data session manual and automatic should be available. * RF Tool must be portable, measurement software on smart phone will ideal. * Real-time upload of test data to post processing tool. * Post processing tool must support analysis of data on map- based view. * Post Processing tool should provide graphical and tabular reports for various features of GSM / UMTS/LTE related performance of the network. * Post processing software tool must work on normal windows-based PC or web-based interface will be ideal. * System must support export of excel, maps or PDF based reports. * Any 5G MIMO measurements will be ideal to verify during SSV stage.  Types of RF drive test tools currently available in market  RF Scanners - A device used to measure radio frequency (RF) of multiple operators concurrently. RF layer 2 and RRC layer 3 capable tools - These are required for deep analysis on 4G and 5G networks and usually expensive. App based RF measurement tools - App based RF tools are compatible on Android smartphones and can be used to conduct 3G, 4G, 5G drive tests. Mass scale deployment of such apps is possible to low cost and compatibility on Android phones. There are solutions in market which has big data capabilities to analyse huge geographical test data received from app-based RF tools. Voice quality measurement - Such tools are used for assessing voice quality (MOS, POLQA), echo minimization, reduction in noise while permitting easy speaker recognition. Load Generator ‚Äì Load generators are deployed to generate high voice and data traffic into a network and test its ability to handle high level congestion/traffic in a network.

It has an oversized blackish bill with a large casque on top. The female is slightly smaller than the male and has a significantly smaller casque. The black-and-white-casqued hornbill is found in wooded habitats in central and western Africa, ranging from western Kenya to C√¥te d'Ivoire with an isolated population in north Angola. It is a monogamous species, and pairs nest in suitable tree cavities. The female usually lays up to two eggs. The diet consists mainly of figs, fruits, insects and small animals found in the trees. Widespread and still locally common, the black-and-white-casqued hornbill is assessed as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.  Taxonomy  Bycanistes subcylindricus is part of the Bycanistes genus of sub-Saharian hornbills which currently include a total of six known species that all share a black and white plummage and are mostly frugivores. This genus has recently been related to the Bucorvus genus, known as Ground Hornbills. Most of the species in that genus have a casque, which is larger in males than females. The closest relative to the black-and-white-casqued hornbill is Bycanistes cylindricus or Brown-cheeked hornbill which inhabits a similar habitat range.  Description  Bycanistes subcylindricus is a moderately large bird of 60 to 70 cm with a wingspan of 28 to 38 cm. It is recognizable by its black plummage for the higher body and wings alongside and white plummage on the lower body and wings with black feathers amongst the white feathers of the tail, particularly the top tail feathers and the base of the tail feathers. It has a yellow-brownish bill and flattened casque, which are enlarged in males. Females have a smaller casque and a black bill. The purpose of the casque is unknown for males, although suggested to be for sexual characterization. The black-and-white-casqued hornbill has very mobile eyes which is not a common trait in birds. This means that its eyes themselves can move in their socket, while other birds tend to have to move their heads to see. It is capable of displaying emotions through the feathers at the top of the head, which allows it to communicate its emotional state. While males weight between 1 kg and 1.5 kg, the females weight between 1 kg and 1.25 kg.  Habitat and Distribution  The black-and-white-casqued hornbill is found mostly in Ivory-Coast, with smaller populations in its surrounding countries for West-African populations. The Central-African populations are mostly in Uganda and Kenya as well as Cameroon with smaller populations in Gabon, Tanzania and Central Africa. They are tropical birds that live in regions with high amounts of forests and is rarely seen in on flat lands, especially due to its arboreal nature.  Behaviour   Diet  The diet of the black-and- white-casqued hornbill consist mostly of fruits, which includes relatively small fruits or pieces of larger fruits. While some may consider this bird, like many other hornbils, to be limited to such food, it has been noted that they are very much capable of hunting small animals, including lizards and the eggs of other birds. Most of the frugal diet of the black-and-white-casqued hornbill comes from figs. The black-and-white-casqued hornbill does not consume water directly and seems to instead hydrate itself from the water contained in the fruits that represent most of its diet. It is capable of precise and delicate handling of edibles by using its beak skillfully in conjunction with its esophagus.

Breeding He was sired by Orme who in turn was sired by Ormonde, the 1886 Triple Crown winner. Their victories made owner Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster, the only person to own two English Triple Crown winners. His dam was the high-strung mare, somewhat aptly named Vampire, by Galopin. Vampire also produced these horses from six matings with Orme: Flying Lemur (¬£1,325, a stud failure); Vamose (¬£5,604 and at stud in France with limited success) and Pipistrello (a non-winner and useless as a stallion), Wetaria, and Vane (produced the Royal Hunt Cup and Ebor Handicap winner, Weathervane).

However, he met with enormous success under trainer John Porter, whom the National Horseracing Museum says was \\"undoubtedly the most successful trainer of the Victorian era.\\"National Horseracing Museum: John Porter Retrieved 2011-1-29 Flying Fox won three of his five starts at age two, and then at age three went undefeated while becoming only the 8th horse in history to win the Triple Crown. In his sixth and last race of his season and of his career, he won the Jockey Club Stakes at Newmarket. Stud record The Duke of Westminster died near the end of 1899 and the following year Flying Fox and many of the other horses in his stable were put up for auction. Purchased for a record 37,500 guineas by the prominent French sportsman Edmond Blanc, he was brought to Blanc's Haras de Jardy horse breeding operation at Marnes-la- Coquette in what is today part of the western suburbs of Paris. Flying Fox, Standing at stud at Haras de Jardy, Flying Fox enjoyed considerable success and was the leading sire in France three times, with his progeny earning ¬£203,400 in prize money. Among his first crop was the colt Ajax, an undefeated winner of the Prix du Jockey Club as well as the Grand Prix de Paris who himself became a leading sire. Ajax was the sire of Teddy, who sired Sir Gallahad III plus the mare La Troienne who is widely regarded as one of the most influential broodmares in the history of modern Thoroughbred breeding. Flying Fox's other progeny included numerous top class winners including Val d'Or and Dagor. Descendants of Flying Fox include Gallant Fox and Citation, the 1930 and 1948 United States Triple Crown Champions and U.S. Hall of Fame colt Coaltown. Flying Fox died at Haras de Jardy on 21 March 1911 at the age of fifteen. His skeleton is at the horse museum at Ch√¢teau de Saumur with a memorial at Eaton Stud in Cheshire, North West England. Honours In 1925 the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) began a tradition of naming locomotives after winning racehorses; LNER Class A1 locomotive no. 4475 (later no. 106, BR no. 60106) was named Flying Fox after this horse, and remained in service until December 1964. A 24 class sloop was also named for the horse; HMS Flying Fox was launched in 1918 and served for only a few years before becoming a training ship alongside in Bristol.

This light is diffuse, although parts within the camera may cast shadows or reflect it in a particular way. For most purposes this is considered a problem. Within the lomography movement it is seen as a positive effect, giving photos character. One frequent source of light leaks in 35 mm cameras is around the film door due to degrading foam. Replacing the foam is a simple matter. Medium format system cameras or large format cameras may have leaks between their various interchangeable parts or in old leather bellows. Electrical tape is often used to repair light leaks in these cases. A light leak, considered as a problem, is a kind of stray light.

They can be created and emulated in digital photography and videography, either during production or after. In the first instance, the photographer or videographer removes the camera lens while photographing or recording and overloads the image sensor.

She was famous for her affair with French Emperor Napoleon I, which was a cause of a violent scene between the Emperor and his wife Jos√©phine shortly before their coronation. Life She was born daughter of general Jean Le Michaud d'Ar√ßon and in 1790 married at the age of 16 to captain Fran√ßois-Xavier-Octave Barberot de Vaudey de Vellexon, who emigrated the year after.Marie-Louise-Sophie de Grouchy Condorcet (marquise de), Aim√©e de Coigny Captives de l'amour 1933 p117 \\"Elle √©tait demoiselle Antoinette- √âlisabeth Le Michaud d'Ar√ßon, fille du g√©n√©ral, avant d'√©pouser en 1790, le capitaine au r√©giment de Bourgogne cavalerie, Octave Barberot de Vaudey, √† Besan√ßon, d'o√π elle √©tait originaire.

On 24 July, de Vaudey was with the Emperor on a trip to visit the waters of Aix- la-Chapelle to improve his fertility. On this trip, de Vaudey caught Napoleon's attention and became his favorite mistress at the time. The affair was tumultuous and short-lived, however, and was the scene for one of the most famous romantic episodes of Napoleon. Eventually Jos√©phine's jealously became aroused and she grew to suspect that the two were having an affair. The letter in which Napoleon accepted the resignation of Mlle. de Vaudey On 25 October of the same year, while Jos√©phine was in the salon entertaining guests at Saint- Cloud, through the window she saw de Vaudey quickly leave her apartment. She suspected something, and after telling her confidant Mme. de R√©musat her plans, she went to Napoleon's chamber only to find him absent. There was a small staircase which led from Napoleon's room to a small apartment on the higher level and after climbing the staircase Jos√©phine heard the two of them talking, and even mentioning Jos√©phine's name. Jos√©phine froze and then knocked on the door and ordered them to open it. After a long delay, the door was opened, with the room in obvious disarray. De Vaudey broke into tears. Napoleon, who had experienced the jealousy of his wife on previous occasions, was red with anger. Jos√©phine, although she feared the consequences, lashed out at the two of them with fierce remonstrances. Before Napoleon could respond, she left quickly and returned to the salon in a state of anxiety. Soon after, Napoleon approached her in her bedchamber and gave vent to his fury. He said he was sick of her spying on him, and was going to divorce her and marry a woman who could give him an heir. The threat was too much for Jos√©phine and she broke down. Napoleon's anger was abated only after his adopted daughter soothed him and encouraged him to reconcile with her mother. Eventually the two made up, and only a few weeks later were crowned Emperor and Empress by Pope Pius VII at Notre-Dame Cathedral. Mme. de Vaudey meanwhile had fled the palace that same day and was soon ordered by Napoleon to resign her post.Thiebaud & Tissot-Robbe. The official reason was that she was a terrible spendthrift and was constantly in debt due to her insatiable appetite for shopping and \\"having fun\\" and always looked to the Imperial treasury to provide her with funds. Although this is true, one cannot mistake the timing of this episode, and it is likely that the affair of 25 October contributed in no small part to her departure. De Vaudey submitted her resignation letter to Jos√©phine, but without \\"going into any details\\", as she was ordered to do. She lost her title and imperial allowance on 29 October 1804 (7 brumaire, an XIII). Death She died in poverty in a poor house in Paris.

Although primarily intended to be a showcase of traditional Scottish events such as the caber toss, the games also serve as an annual gathering of area residents as well as the various Scottish clan societies across Canada and the United States. The games have evolved to be home of North America's most competitive and prestigious Scottish cultural events, particularly in bagpiping and drumming. The North American Pipe Band Championships are held in Maxville annually, and see pipe bands across North America competing in every grade. The Canadian Piobaireachd Society Gold Medal and Bar to the Medal contests have also been held in Maxville since 1973, and see premier solo pipers compete for one of the most coveted prizes in the solo piping circuit.

Hershey Creamery Company, also known as Hershey's Ice Cream, is a creamery that produces ice cream, sorbet, sherbet, frozen yogurt, and other frozen desserts such as smoothies and frozen slab-style ice cream mixers. It was founded by Jacob Hershey and four of his brothers in 1894 and taken over by the Holder family in the 1920s. The company was one of the first to offer consumers pre-packaged ice cream pints. The family-owned business has approximately 450 employees and operates 30 distribution centers in 28 states across the Eastern and Northeastern United States. It is a publicly traded company, with its stocks listed only on Pink Sheets as the company offers a limited number of shares to potential shareholders. In 1998, it modernized its operations to increase efficiency and reduce overhead. Hershey Creamery Company has no connection to the Hershey Company, though both companies were founded in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, in the same year. The companies have had a tumultuous relationship marked by multiple lawsuits over trademark issues. In the mid-1990s, the companies settled their most recent legal battles out of court, with Hershey Creamery Company agreeing to add a disclaimer to its ice cream products to note that it is not affiliated with the Hershey Company. History The Hershey brothers, Jacob, Isaac, John, Paris, and Eli, founded Hershey Creamery Company in 1894, with the company originally operating out of the Hershey family's Lancaster County farmhouse. The ice cream was packed in metal-lined wooden containers that the Hershey brothers designed and built. The containers were loaded into trucks with ice packed around them to keep the ice cream fresh and cold. Salesmen traveled daily routes to deliver product to customers in the county and in surrounding areas. In the 1920s, the company was merged with the Holder family's Bethlehem-based Meyer Dairy Company, retaining the Hershey name. In 1926, with demand for the ice cream exceeding the capacity of the farmhouse, the newly merged company constructed its first ice cream plant in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. During the Great Depression, the company became the first ice cream maker to offer its products in pre-packaged pints. It began creating new flavors of ice cream which it then sold to other ice cream makers. Following World War II, the company continued to answer the call for greater convenience in consumer foods and expanded its offerings to include single-serve, easy to eat items such as ice pops and ice cream sandwiches. In the 1960s, the Holder family assumed full ownership of the company. As the company grew, it split its production operations, with the Harrisburg location mixing the ice cream and a new facility in Lower Swatara Township used for the actual hardening and packaging of the product. While local orders continued to be delivered in small Hershey's Ice Cream refrigerated trucks, the company shifted to transporting most of its ice cream to refrigerated tractor trailer trucks, enabling it to stretch its market beyond the state of Pennsylvania. It expanded its distribution facilities, eventually occupying 22 co-owned distribution centers. This enabled the company to ship products out more quickly after orders are received and resulted in less travel time for the products, ensuring freshness and quality were maintained. In the summer months, the company greatly increased its workforce and leased additional cold-storage space to help meet the seasonal orders, as the orders were prepared by hand. In 1998, operations were modernized and automated when the company purchased in nearby Middletown where it constructed a modern 1.3 million cubic foot warehouse, enabling it to boost its efficiency, reducing the need to increase its summer workforce, and reducing the frequent product loss caused by hand orders and inefficient packing systems. The modernization of its warehouse also improved inventory management, order accuracy, and has helped the company continue its growth. Trademark disputes with Hershey Company Hershey Creamery has been involved in multiple legal disputes with the similarly named Hershey Company, founded around the same time in the city of Lancaster by Milton S. Hershey‚Äîdespite the proximity, no relation to the founding Hershey brothers. The first troubles came after the Hershey Creamery began producing chocolate candy and cocoa. Milton S. Hershey learned of the candies in 1919, and assigned Charles Ziegler to \\"find instances of confusion and infringement and of unfair competition\\". Ziegler found that in addition to making similar products, the packaging used on the chocolates resembled that used by Hershey Company‚Äîthen called Hershey Chocolate. Investigating complaints from retailers in Boston, New York, Binghamton, Norfolk, and Richmond, Ziegler reportedly found that retailers were confusing the two products, and sometimes deliberately replacing the higher priced Hershey Company products with the Hershey Creamery products. In Harrisburg, Ziegler found a display of Hershey Creamery \\"Hershey Kisses\\", which were bite-sized chocolate drops similar to the chocolate company's creations. After cease and desist letters failed to resolve the problem, Milton Hershey filed suit in 1921 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania for trademark infringement. In 1926, a district judged partially sided with Hershey Chocolate and prohibited the creamery from using the name Hershey's in connection with \\"manufacture, advertisement, distribution, or sale of, among other things, chocolate, cocoa, chocolate confections, and chocolate or cocoa products\\". In 1958, the creamery registered for and was granted the \\"Hershey's\\" trademark for use with ice cream and butter products. Seven years later, the company filed suit in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Hershey Company and Consolidated Foods Corporation after learning the companies were planning to partner to make a line of Hershey's branded ice cream bars. Hershey Creamery alleged \\"trademark infringement, unfair competition, false designation of origin, false descriptions, and false representations\\", to which Hershey Chocolate responded with a counterclaim questioning the validity of the trademark, claiming it was fraudulently obtained. The companies settled out of court the following year, with the creamery agreeing to drop \\"butter\\" from its trademark and fix a filing error with it, and allowing Hershey Company to release the licensed bars within certain guidelines. Hershey Company also agreed not to challenge the creamery's \\"Hershey's\\" trademark for use on ice cream again. Shortly after this, Hershey Creamery expanded its trademark to include other ice cream products: \\"ice cream, ice milk, sherbet, water ice, and frozen confections in which ice cream, ice milk, sherbet or water ice is a component\\". In 1989, the creamery expanded its products to include frozen yogurt and filed for a new trademark for this new line of products. Upon learning of the registration request, the Hershey Company‚Äîthen named Hershey Foods‚Äîdemanded the company cease production of the products claiming it violated Hershey Company's trademarks. The creamery dropped its application, but continued releasing the products, so in May 1990, Hershey Company filed suit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania seeking a legal injunction to stop Hershey Creamery from producing and marketing its Hershey's branded frozen yogurt, as well as to attempt to stop the company from using the \\"Hershey's\\" trademark outside of its \\"traditional thirteen-state trading area\\" and to demand that the company include a disclaimer disavowing its relation to Hershey Company on all of its products. Hershey Creamery counter sued in the New York South District court, concerned that Hershey Company demands reneged on the 1967 settlement, and requested the Pennsylvania court actions be transferred to the New York court as that was where the settlement was originally handled. The request was denied and the court instead blocked the Hershey Creamery's suit in New York. The Creamery appealed but this was denied. After three years in court, the two companies again settled, with Hershey Creamery agreeing to put a disclaimer on all of its products, corporate website, and in promotional materials and press releases. On their website, the disclaimer simply notes \\"not affiliated with Hershey's Chocolate\\". Other legal issues In November 2008, Hershey Creamery Company became the first company in the nation to be prosecuted and fined for failing to implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) as required by the Clean Air Act. The charges were brought by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which stated that the company failed to develop the required plans with regard to its storage and use of anhydrous ammonia, which is a regulated substance. In the charges, the EPA noted that the creamery twice certified that it had developed the RMP plan, once in 1999 and again in 2004. Later inspection showed that the certifications were false and on December 7, 2006, the EPA issued a civil compliance order against the company, ordering the company to come into compliance. Hershey Creamery complied and in April 2007 submitted the appropriate RMPs, which were confirmed to be in-place through subsequent inspection. The case was heard at the Federal Middle District court of Pennsylvania, with Hershey Creamery pleading guilty to the charges; it was subsequently fined $100,000 and given a year probation. Business model Hershey Creamery is a family operated business, with each new generation raised to assume roles within the company hierarchy upon graduation of high school. , George Holder is its president, while his younger brothers, Walter and Tom, are vice president of manufacturing and vice president of sales and marketing, respectively. The company has approximately 450 employees. The company operates 22 distribution centers, which serve some 22,000 clients in 28 states across the eastern United States, with Florida, Illinois, and the Carolinas being its newest market areas after its 2005 expansion. Since 1996, management has focused on the company's main distribution center rather than expansion outside of existing footprint. In 2003, it shifted its focus to moving its operations from the Harrisburg area, which is flood-prone and landlocked, to the Lower Swatara area. It opened a distribution center there in 1998, and plans to shift its headquarters and production facilities there over the next five to ten years. Unlike other ice cream makers, Hershey Creamery maintains ownership over its delivery trucks, distribution centers and warehouses, a practice the Holder family feels is important to maintaining the traditions of the \\"private, conservative\\" company. Sales are primarily derived from branded ice cream parlors, quick- serve restaurants, and the distribution of its pre-packaged items to convenience stores, food service operators such as schools, hospitals, prisons, military installations, sports stadiums, amusement parks, and assisted living centers. Pre-packaged items are also sold in regional supermarkets, but this accounts for a minority of the company's sales. Financials Hershey Creamery Company is a publicly traded company, with only 36,000 shares available, which are listed on Pink Sheets () and sold via the over-the-counter market. The company has fewer than 500 shareholders, primarily among the Holder family. Its stocks are considered to be \\"thinly traded\\" in that its shares are rarely traded, and then only a few shares are sold at a time. In 2006, the company maintained a 6.2 to 1 price-to-earnings ratio with no long-term debt and shareholders receive quarterly dividends and special dividends. In 1936, the company shares traded at $2.01 per share. The value of the stock continued to grow steadily and by 1996, shares were trading at $2,300 per share; and hitting as high as $3,600 a share in 2003. Though not required to provide U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, the company does distribute similar-style reports to its shareholders annually, and in the 1930s and 40s, its annual earnings were reported in the Christian Science Monitor. In 1936, the company reported an net income of $195,077, up nearly $10,000 from its 1935 earnings of $185,320. As the company grew, so did its earnings. In 2001, the company reported sales of $91.4 million, giving it a net profit of $4.6 million. Sales began declining, and by 2007, they were down to $44,800,000. Hershey Creamery ranked #90 in Dairy Foods magazine's 2005 list of the top 100 dairy companies, which ranks dairy companies based on annual sales. This was one rank higher than its 2004 rank of 91st. Products , Hershey Creamery Company offers 98 flavors of regular, hand- dipped premium ice cream, with 31 of those varieties marked as super premium gold rim products and 4 available in no sugar added (NSA) varieties that use the alternate sweetening product Splenda. Additionally, it offers two flavors of sorbet, three flavors of sherbet, and eight flavors of frozen yogurt. For pre-packaged half-gallons, the company offers consumers 32 ice cream flavors, including 4 no-fat varieties of its basic flavors and five sherbet flavors. In pints, it offers 13 flavors in its traditional square packaging and 15 flavors in its newer round pint packaging, including 2 limited edition and 2 no-sugar added varieties. It also offers three basic pre-made ice cream cakes. In addition to these traditional ice cream treats, Hershey Creamery offers a variety of novelty ice cream treats, including ice cream sandwiches, Ice pops, sundae cups, ice cream sticks, squeeze ups, and pre-made cones. It also distributes smoothies under its \\"Tropi-Kool Smoothies\\" brand and frozen slab ice cream under its \\"Creation Station\\" brand. In January 2007, the company became one of the first companies to offer a frozen energy drink: Banzai Energy Ice, which it created by using the then popular energy drink Banzai. Though the 4-ounce product received good reviews for its citrus flavor and convenient squeeze-up container for on-the-go consumer, the product was a financial failure and was dropped.

The Art Pavilion in Zagreb () is an art gallery in Zagreb, Croatia. The Pavilion is located on the Lenuci Horseshoe, Lower Town area of the city, south of Nikola ≈†ubiƒá Zrinski Square and just north of the King Tomislav Square with the Zagreb Central Station. Established in 1898, it is the oldest gallery in the Southeast Europe and the only purpose-built gallery in Zagreb designed specifically to accommodate large-scale exhibitions. History The idea of creating the gallery was first put forward by Croatian painter Vlaho Bukovac in the spring of 1895. In May 1896 a Millennium Exhibition was to be held in Budapest, celebrating 1,000 years of Hungarian statehood, and artists from what was then Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia were invited to attend. Urged by Bukovac, Croatian artists decided to present their works in a purpose-built Pavilion, constructed around a prefabricated iron skeleton so that it could easily be shipped to Zagreb after the exhibition. The Budapest Pavilion was designed by Hungarian architects Fl√≥ris Korb and K√°lm√°n Giergl and was constructed by the Danubius building company. After the exhibition had ended, the building's skeleton was transported to Zagreb and Austrian architects Fellner & Helmer (who were at the time active in Zagreb, and had earlier designed the Croatian National Theatre building) were hired to design a new version of the building based on the iron skeleton, while the H√∂nigsberg & Deutsch building company was contracted to perform the actual construction. The building's exterior was decorated with sculptures in the academic art style ‚Äî the eastern facade displays busts of three Renaissance painters of Croatian ancestry ‚Äî Giulio Clovio (Julije Kloviƒá), Andrea Schiavone (Andrija Meduliƒá) and Vittore Carpaccio, and the western facade has busts of Michelangelo, Raphael and Titian. The construction went on for two years between 1897 and 1898 and the Pavilion was officially inaugurated on 15 December 1898 with a large exhibition showcasing works of local artists called Croatian Salon (). The exhibition was very popular and attracted some 10,000 visitors, at a time when Zagreb had a total population of 60,000. The gallery has a total display area of 600 m2 and does not have a permanent display as it specialises in one-off solo and group exhibitions representing notable oeuvres and art movements from all periods and styles, with works by both Croatian and foreign artists. Throughout its history the gallery organised around 700 exhibitions with artists ranging from the Earth Group collective to George Grosz, Henry Moore, Auguste Rodin, Andy Warhol, Mimmo Rotella, Joan Mir√≥, Auguste Rodin, Alberto Giacometti and many others.

She was briefly bassist/backup singer for Hole in late 1992. History Leslie Hardy grew up in Metro Detroit, Michigan. She was Hole's bassist and backup singer for several months in 1992 to 1993. According to Rene Navarrette (a live-in friend of Hole frontwoman Courtney Love), the band moved her up from Los Angeles to Seattle, but her playing did not meet required standards. Hardy's picture appears on the EP version of the single \\"Beautiful Son\\", but she does not appear on any of the tracks, which were recorded after her departure. Seattle punk band Kill Sybil also used her as bassist, and when that broke up Hardy and that band's singer/guitarist Dale Balenseifen formed the all-female Juned with singer/guitarist Claudia Groom (of local band My Diva) and drummer Nalini Cheriel (of Adickdid). Bassist Mike Johnson, then of Dinosaur Jr, was a fan of Juned. He produced and played on their first self-titled album in 1994, and the band opened for Dinosaur Jr at a number of concerts. Hardy married Johnson in 1995, and contributed to two tracks on his 1996 solo record Year of Mondays, but the marriage did not last. In 1998 she briefly played bass in Love as Laughter, before joining garage-punk band The Murder City Devils as their keyboardist/organist. The band had released its second album Empty Bottles, Broken Hearts and needed a keyboard player for its tour. Hardy became an integral part of MCD, contributing as a songwriter, and with her organ playing a key factor in the band's sound. After two years of pain from carpal tunnel syndrome, she received surgery on both wrists in mid-2001. Continuing pain over the next two months, however, forced her to leave Murder City Devils; its European tour was cancelled and it subsequently broke up for a time. Hardy left Seattle and returned home to Detroit, where she has worked as a real estate agent and played in local band Pigeon. She joined Matt Skiba and the Sekrets as keyboardist for their 2012 tour; Skiba (of Alkaline Trio) did not know her previously, but invited her to play because he was a \\"huge Murder City Devils fan\\". Since her return to Detroit, Hardy has played at a number of Murder City Devils reunion concerts, and appears on one track of their 2014 album The White Ghost Has Blood on Its Hands Again. The lack of Hardy's organ sound was described as \\"the most disappointing aspect\\" of that album by The A.V. Club.

The color is caused by the excretion of betalain (betacyanin) pigments such as betanin. The coloring is highly variable between individuals and between different occasions, and can vary in intensity from invisible to strong. The pigment is sensitive to oxidative degradation under strongly acidic conditions. Therefore, the urine coloring depends on stomach acidity and dwell time as well as the presence of protecting substances such as oxalic acid. Beeturia is often associated with red or pink feces.Allergy Advisor - Beeturia Compiled by Karen du Plessis, Food & Allergy Consulting & Testing Services. Retrieved on January 1, 2013 Cause A selection of differently colored beetroot varieties The red color seen in beeturia is caused by the presence of unmetabolized betalain pigments such as betanin in beetroot passed through the body. The pigments are absorbed in the colon. Betalains are oxidation-sensitive redox indicators that are decolorized by hydrochloric acid, ferric ions, and colonic bacteria preparations. The gut flora play a not-yet-evaluated role in the breakdown of the pigment. Explanations * There is some relationship to iron deficiency. * There is no known relation to deficiencies in liver metabolism or removal from the body by the kidneys. * There is no known direct genetic influence, and no single gene variant, that differentiates excreters from non-excreters. Factors affecting beeturia The extent of excreted pigment depends on: * The pigment content of the meal, including: ** The type of beetroot (for instance, the pigment concentration of the Detroit Rubidus variety is twice that of the Firechief variety) ** The addition of concentrated beetroot extract as a food additive to certain processed foods ** The storage conditions of the meal, including light, heat, and oxygen exposure, and repeated freeze-thaw cycles that all could degrade the pigments ** Urine volume, affecting the dilution of the dye * The stomach acidity and dwell time * The presence of protecting substances such as oxalic acid in the meal and during intestinal passage * Medications that affect stomach acidity such as proton pump inhibitors See also *Food color *Porphyria, a group of disorders that may cause reddish urine *Blue diaper syndrome References External links *Beeturia - Allergy Advisor Category:Symptoms and signs: Urinary system Category:Urine ","title":"Beeturia"},{"id":"8103419","text":"Shanghai Golden Eagles (‰∏äÊµ∑ÈáëÈπ∞) is a baseball team based in Shanghai and a member of the China Baseball League.

The Secretary of Welfare is a member of the Executive Cabinet, and is appointed at the discretion of the President of the Republic. The Secretariat of Welfare aims to eliminate poverty through comprehensive, collectively responsible human development, achieve adequate levels of well-being with adjustment to government policies, and improvement through social, economic and political factors in rural and urban areas to enhance local organization, city development and housing. Between 1992 and 2018, the agency was known as the Secretariat of Social Development (Secretar√≠a de Desarrollo Social), or SEDESOL. History left The agency was established as the Secretariat of Public Works (Secretar√≠a de Obras P√∫blicas) in 1959. In 1976, it changed its name to the Secretariat of Human Settlements and Public Works (Secretar√≠a de Asentamientos Humanos y Obras P√∫blicas), with another name change in 1982 to Secretariat of Urban Development and Ecology (Secretar√≠a de Desarrollo Urbano y Ecolog√≠a). In 1992, the agency became the Secretariat of Social Development. The name changed again in 2018 to the Secretariat of Welfare as part of reforms to the Organic Law of the Federal Public Administration coinciding with the beginning of Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador's time in office. Mar√≠a Luisa Albores, whom L√≥pez Obrador tapped to head the agency, said the renamed agency will overhaul and improve existing programs that she described as ineffective. Functions According to the Organic Law of the Federal Public Administration, the direction and contribution of ideas for the fight against poverty, as well as the coordination of the different agencies to work in the same line of interest of the State, corresponds. Through the coordination of the other agencies of the public administration will seek the development of housing construction plans for the improvement of the quality of life of citizens. In this task, it receives support from the Oportunidades program, the National Housing Development Commission (CONAFOVI) and the National Institute of Social Development (INDESOL); Including the Commission for the Regularization of Land Tenure (CORETT), the National Fund for Popular Housing (FONHAPO), the National Fund for the Promotion of Handicrafts (FONART), and other state institutions.

The loss of the damaged structure disrupts the function of the remaining intact systems and causes a physiological imbalance. This can lead both to restitution as well as disruption of distal brain areas. The injury is produced by an acute focal disturbance in an area of the brain, from traumatic brain injury or stroke, for example. Regarding dysfunctional diaschisis, some function may be restored with gradual readjustment of the intact but suppressed areas through intervention and the brain's natural neuroplasticity. The term diaschisis was coined by Constantin von Monakow in 1914. Von Monakow's concept of neurophysical changes in distant brain tissue to the focal lesion led to a widespread clinical interest. Doctors were interested in how diaschisis could describe the signs and symptoms of brain lesions that could not be explained. The areas of the brain are connected by vast organized neuronal pathways that allow one area of the brain to influence other areas more distal to it. Understanding these dense pathways helps to link a lesion causing brain damage in one area of the brain to degeneration in a more distal brain area. A focal lesion causes damage that also disturbs the structural and functional connectivity to the brain areas distal to the lesion. The primary mechanism of diaschisis is functional deafferentation, which is the loss of the input of information from the part of the brain that is now damaged. The decrease in information and neural firing to the distal brain area causes those synaptic connections to weaken and initiates a change in the structural and functional connectivity around that area. This leads to diaschisis. Diaschisis is also influenced by many other factors, including stroke, brain swelling, and neuroanatomical disconnection. The severity of these factors is manifested in altered neuronal excitability, hypo-metabolism, and hypo perfusion. Currently the term diaschisis has a more positive connotation, describing the period of rapid recovery of function immediately following brain insult. Diaschisis is an especially important recovery factor in children with insults, as child brains are more susceptible to neurodegerative processes. This is due to differences in myelination and water content, which allow a diffuse transmition of traumatic forces. There are two types of diaschisis. The first is focal diaschisis, which refers to the remote neurophysiological changes that are caused by a focal lesion based on von Monakow's definition. The second type of diaschisis is non-focal diaschisis and it focuses on the changes in the strength and direction of neural pathways and connectivity between brain areas. This type of diaschisis has only been a topic in recent studies as a result of the advancement of brain imaging tools and technology. These new tools allow for better understanding of the organization of the brain connectivity and further investigation into new types of diaschisis, like non-focal or connectional diaschisis. This new type of diaschisis relates much more closely to clinical findings.

It is a live album released during a six-year hiatus from studio recording, which followed the expiration of the group's recording contract with Alias Records in 2000. Background Scott Miller, the band's founder and frontman, signed with independent recording label 125 Records after the expiration of the Loud Family's contract with Alias Records. The album was the fifth release by the then newly formed label, founded in 2001 by Joe Mallon and Sue Trowbridge, who had a long acquaintance with Miller and his bands. Music From Ritual to Romance includes live recordings of two performances at different points in the band's history. The first performance, on tracks 1-7 and 14-19, is from a Hotel Utah show on October 5, 1996. Drummer Dawn Richardson had recently left the group, and for the 1996 tour supporting the release of Interbabe Concern, she was replaced by Mike Tittel, currently leader of the Ohio-based band New Sincerity Works. The second performance, on tracks 8-13 and 20-21, is from a show at the Bottom of the Hill in San Francisco on August 8, 1998, after the release of the album Days for Days. The album includes cover versions of \\"Debaser\\" by The Pixies, \\"When You Sleep\\" by My Bloody Valentine and \\"Here Come The Warm Jets\\" by Brian Eno. The songs \\"Not Because You Can,\\" \\"Go Ahead You're Dying To,\\" and \\"Curse of the Frontier Land\\" are The Loud Family's versions of songs from Game Theory, Miller's previous band. The songs listed as \\"Nine\\", \\"Five\\" and \\"Eleven\\" are three of the untitled soundscapes from The Loud Family's 1998 studio album Days for Days. The numbered titles reflect track numbers on Days for Days, in which conventionally titled songs are alternated with untitled tracks that amplify themes of the songs that they follow. On Days for Days, track 9 follows \\"Way Too Helpful,\\" track 5 follows \\"Good, There Are No Lions in the Street,\\" and track 11 follows \\"Mozart Sonatas.\\" Critical response Writing in the Boston Phoenix, critic Brett Milano called the album \\"typically unconventional, drawing on their most obscure album tracks,\\" and featuring the band's \\"usual blend of finely crafted pop hooks, elusive yet resonant lyrics, male-female harmonies ... and more self-depreciation.\\" The review cited the album's opening medley with \\"dark, ominous keyboards ... and a throat-shredding Miller vocal; it's the sound of a band who‚Äôd explode if they hadn‚Äôt gotten to play those songs at that minute.\\" According to Scram magazine's Kim Cooper, the live CD showed the band's \\"rough, antagonistic power\\" and \\"their willingness to take Scott's songs in their teeth and shake 'em silly, all of which made the fundamental prettiness of the music seem more touching and fragile,\\" leading up to \\"a closing salvo that left me breathless and punching the replay button.\\" AllMusic's Mark Deming wrote, \\"Given the difficulty of capturing the band's more delicate and layered material onstage, the Loud Family seemed to respond by turning up the amps and hitting harder, and From Ritual to Romance captures a band far more bracingly physical than you might expect.\\" Deming added that the live album \\"chronicles what made this band difficult for passing observers, as much as what made them so appealing to fans, and this is a gesture to Loud Family fans in the best sense. It's that rare live album that's as dense and demanding as a studio set, and one that also rewards a careful listen.\\" Track listing #\\"Where the Flood Waters Soak Their Belongings\\" - 1:52 #\\"Here Come the Warm Jets\\" ‚Äì 0:42 #\\"Spot the Setup\\" ‚Äì 2:38 #\\"Such Little Nonbelievers\\" ‚Äì 3:25 #\\"Aerodeliria\\" - 2:59 #\\"Don't Respond, She Can Tell\\" ‚Äì 3:54 #\\"Sword Swallower\\" ‚Äì 4:11 #\\"Nine\\" - 0:49 #\\"Not Because You Can\\" - 3:12 #\\"Good, There Are No Lions in the Street\\" ‚Äì 4:07 #\\"Five\\" ‚Äì 1:16 #\\"Eleven\\" - 0:15 #\\"Deee-pression\\" - 3:33 #\\"Debaser\\" - 2:44 #\\"Sodium Laureth Sulfate\\" - 2:50 #\\"Baby Hard-To-Be-Around\\" - 3:11 #\\"Go Ahead, You're Dying To\\" - 2:45 #\\"Asleep and Awake on the Man's Freeway\\" - 2:47 #\\"Curse of the Frontier Land\\" - 3:59 #\\"When You Sleep\\" - 4:21 # untitled - 0:55 Personnel Hotel Utah, San Francisco - October 5, 1996 *Kenny Kessel - bass guitar and vocal *Scott Miller - guitar and vocal *Mike Tittel - drums *Paul Wieneke - keyboards, guitar and vocal Bottom of the Hill, San Francisco - August 8, 1998 *Kenny Kessel - bass guitar and vocal *Alison Faith Levy - keyboards and vocal *Scott Miller - guitar and vocal *Gil Ray - drums References Category:The Loud Family albums Category:2002 live albums ","title":"From Ritual to Romance (album)"},{"id":"8103540","text":"Robb is a hamlet in west-central Alberta, Canada within Yellowhead County.

It is a dicotyledonous plant with simple leaves, which are alternate or in fascicles (clusters) on short shoots.GENTRY, A.H. 1996. A field guide to the families and genera of woody plants of northwest South America (Columbia, Ecuador, Peru), with supplementary notes on herbaceous taxa. University of Chicago Press. p. 265. It is naturalized in India.Pharmacographia Indica page 40 In Cuba, this tree is known to grow in both disturbed habitat and areas of poor drainage. It can grow up to 10 meters tall. In Mexico, the hardened rind of the fruit is used to make small vessels for serving or drinking. In Cuba, the dried fruit is commonly used as a coffee cup by rural farmers. In Colombia, the dried fruit is halved and then partially filled with either stones, beads, seeds, broken glass or a combination and is then used to keep the rhythm in bullerengue music. The dried fruit are filled with certain seeds and a handle is made to make maracas in multiple Latin American countries (especially Colombia and Cuba). Western and Southern Africa it is also used for decoration and musical instruments. The tree shares its common name with that of the vine calabash, or bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria). Caribbean A calabash is primarily used to make utensils such as cups, bowls, and basins in rural areas. It can be used for carrying water, or for transporting fish, when fishing. In some Caribbean countries, it is worked, painted, and decorated and turned into items by artisans, and sold to tourists. As a cup, bowl, or even a water-pipe or \\"bong\\", the calabash is considered consistent with the \\"Ital\\" or vital lifestyle of not using refined products such as table salt, or modern cooking methods, such as microwave ovens. In Haiti, the plant is called kalbas kouran, literally, \\"running calabash\\", and is used to make the sacred rattle emblematic of the Vodou priesthood, called an asson. As such, the plant is highly respected. It is the national tree of St. Lucia. Costa Rica The Costa Rican town of Santa B√°rbara de Santa Cruz holds a traditional annual dance of the calabashes (baile de los guacales). Since 2000, the activity has been considered of cultural interest to the community, and all participants receive a hand-painted calabash vessel to thank them for their economic contribution (which they paid in the form of an entrance ticket). Native Americans throughout the country traditionally serve chicha in calabash vessels to the participants of special events such as the baile de los diablitos (dance of the little fiends). Mexico In many rural parts of Mexico, the calabash is dried and carved hollow to create a bule or a guaje, a gourd used to carry water around like a canteen. The j√≠cara fruit is cut in half, which gave the parallel name to a clay cup also called j√≠cara. Brazil Bowls made of calabash were used by Brazilians as utensils made to serve food, and the practice is still retained in some remote areas of Brazil (originally by populations of various ethnicities, origins and regions, but nowadays mainly by Native Americans). The fruit are also commonly used in Brazil as the resonator for the berimbau, the signature instrument of capoeira, a martial art/dance developed in Brazilian plantations by African slaves.

It is a remake of Kamat's critically acclaimed Marathi film, Dombivli Fast, which is loosely based on the Michael Douglas starrer 1993 Hollywood film Falling Down. It stars Madhavan and Sangeetha in the lead roles, with director Seeman acting in a pivotal role. The film's music is composed by P. Sameer and the title song by G. V. Prakash Kumar. It is produced by noted Hindi directors Abbas Burmawalla and Mustan Burmawalla as they make their debuts as Tamil film producers under the distribution of their home banner, Burmawalla Limited. It had been previously named, Ivan Yaaro. Plot Sridhar Vasudevan (Madhavan) is a middle-class family man employed in a bank. He is very idealistic, principled, and recognizes a deep sense of belonging with the society he is part of. He gets annoyed and flustered by illegal and semi-legal activities happening around him. His wife Vatsala (Sangeetha) persistently demands he should be more 'flexible' and make more money, but Sridhar does not accede. He endures the illegal and semi-legal activities around him because he anticipates a change in the mindsets of people. He feels that over time, they will become more honest, socially aware and willing to make small personal sacrifices for the greater good of all (like him). Vatsala is a typical middle-class housewife and a caring mother of two children, Varsha and Varun. Societal imperfections and related problems matter very little to her. She is more concerned about her reactive husband, thinking about ways to save him from the effects of his angry outbursts and to steer him away from his impractical thoughts and deeds. At a certain point in life, Sridhar faces a case of deceit that compels him to take action. Provoked by his deep anger and guilt, he decides to retaliate for wrongs done to him, violently if required. When charged 2 rupees extra for a cool drink, he picks up a cricket bat and smashes the shop. From that incident onward, Sridhar progresses, taking law in his own hands and trying to bring about instant changes wherever needed. A string of incidents occur; he thrashes the Area Counseller, the insincere hospital employees, water supplier, and many more. Sridhar's anger goes beyond these incidents, targeting individuals who do not follow norms created for their own benefit. Nishikanth Kamath has presented Sridhar as a representative for every common man in today's society, who, even after seeing and going through such wrong things, tolerates them to avoid getting his settled routine disturbed. Because of his behaviour and approach, Sridhar is termed as a criminal, harmful to his fellow men. Inspector Vetri Maran (Seeman) is appointed to shoot Sridhar in an arranged 'encounter'. Vetri Maran, though not of the incorruptible kind, feels bad about the police-corruption nexus. He is a goodhearted cop and inwardly feels justified by Sridhar's approach. He comes to a quiet agreement with the young man, personally approves his action, then arranges for the 'encounter killing'. At the end, Sridhar is shot dead by Vetri Maran.

He played professionally in the North American Soccer League and Major Indoor Soccer League and earned six caps with the United States men's national soccer team. In 2019 he was inducted into the Indoor Soccer Hall of Fame and Islip High School Hall of Fame.  Youth  Attended Islip High School in New York where Mayer was named All-Suffolk County in three sports (Soccer, Basketball, and Tennis). He along with his brother, Bill, were New York State Tennis Doubles Champions. After graduating from Islip High School, Mayer attended James Madison University (JMU) where he played collegiate soccer and tennis for four seasons. He was the JMU soccer team MVP all four years while setting school records for career and season shutouts and also being named the first All-American player from JMU. Mayer was the JMU's tennis team MVP for three years as he played #1 singles and #1 doubles and was named JMU Athlete of the Year twice. He was selected to the James Madison University Hall of Fame in 1988. In 2000, he was voted JMU's Top Athlete of the Century.  Professional  After graduating in 1974, he was drafted first by the Baltimore Comets of the North American Soccer League (NASL). In the 1974 off-season, while playing in England for Southend United, then in the Football League Third Division, Mayer earned the distinction of scoring a goal from the goalkeeper position. In 1976, the Comets moved to San Diego and renamed their franchise, the Jaws. The team moved again in 1977 after only one season in San Diego, this time to Las Vegas, becoming the Quicksilvers. That year, Mayer earned NASL Second Team All Star honors. In 1978, the team moved again, back to San Diego where they took the name Sockers. Mayer remained with the team through all these moves and was named the 1978 NASL American Player of the Year.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RmpQAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=eloDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5498,2894153&dq;=alan+mayer+player+of+the+year&hl;=en Beginning in 1979, Mayer alternated between indoor and outdoor soccer for several years. While on contract with the Sockers for the outdoor season, he joined the Pittsburgh Spirit of the original Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL) for the 1979-1980 MISL season. He was selected as second team All MISL with the Spirit. In 1980, the Sockers traded Mayer to the California Surf. He played two seasons with the Surf. Between the 1980 and 1981 outdoor seasons, Mayer also played with the New Jersey Rockets of the MISL. When the Surf folded after the 1981 season, Mayer concentrated on playing indoor soccer for the remainder of his career. He returned to the Rockets for the 1981-1982 season before moving back to the San Diego Sockers which, while still officially part of the NASL, was playing in the MISL during the indoor season. While the Sockers had been a poor outdoor team, they quickly became the dominant U.S. indoor franchise, winning the MISL 1982-1983 championship. Mayer was the named the MISL MVP and was the MISL All Star team goalkeeper that year as well. Mayer had a short tenure as player/head coach of the MISL's Las Vegas Americans in 1984-85, but was relieved of his coaching duties just ten games into the season (after going 4-6) and was replaced by Don Popovic. Mayer remained with the Americans strictly as a goalie and went 17-12 while splitting time with Keith Van Eron. After the Americans' franchise folded the following summer, Mayer signed with the Kansas City Comets for the 1985-86 season and became an MISL All-Star for the second time. Nicknamed \\"Kamikaze\\" for his reckless all-out style of play, he became a fan favorite throughout his time in Kansas City, spending his final four seasons as a Comet before retiring at the end of the 1988-89 season. Mayer played his last game on April 12, 1989, against the Wichita Wings, and he finished with a regular season won-lost record of 56-56 in Kansas City. In 2013, the Comets retired his jersey and it is now displayed hanging in the Silverstein Eye Centers Arena.  National team  He earned 6 caps, gaining 2 shutouts, with the United States men's national soccer team from 1976 and 1977. During that period, he and Arnie Mausser traded duties as the starting goalkeeper on the national team. During his career, he was known for wearing a padded helmet, not common in soccer at the time.http://www.soundercentral.com/museum/1979updates/socking_san_diego.htm Coach After retiring from playing, Mayer was an assistant coach to the Kansas City Wizards of Major League Soccer. He currently lives in Kansas City and is goalkeeping coach of the Sporting KC Academy (MLS), University of Missouri at Kansas City (UMKC) and the Kansas City Comets in the Major Arena Soccer League. The team honored Mayer at halftime of their game on February 22, 2013, by retiring his #0 jersey from his tenure with the original Major Indoor Soccer League Kansas City Comets. Mayer was inducted into the Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame on Long Island in the Soccer Category with the Class of 2002.

He is regarded as an important composer of Protestant sacred music in the 20th century. Pepping taught at the and the . His music includes works for instruments (three symphonies), the church (the motet , the ), and collections including the (Spandau choir book) and the three volume (Great Organ Book), which provides pieces for the entire liturgical year.  Career  Born Ernst Heinrich Franz Pepping in Duisburg, Pepping first studied to be a teacher. From 1922 to 1926 he studied composition at the Berliner Hochschule f√ºr Musik with Walter Gmeindl, a pupil of Franz Schreker. Pepping composed mostly instrumental music until 1928. In 1926 his works (Little serenade for military band) and (Suite for trumpet, saxophone and trombone) were premiered at the Donaueschinger Musiktage. He received the composition award of the Mendelssohn Foundation. In 1929 his (Chorale suite) was first performed in Duisburg and well received. In 1934, Pepping accepted a position as teacher of harmony, and counterpoint at the of the Protestant in Spandau, where he lived until his death. Among his many students were Helmut Barbe and Erhard Egidi. Pepping also taught at the from 1935 to 1938 as a professor of church music and composition. He had ties to the Confessing Church and wrote a great deal of music on German texts. In 1938, after a 1937 Church Music Festival in which he participated, he composed a German mass, (German Mass: Kyrie God Father in Eternity), which stressed the German nation, and which also followed the Party line. During World War II, even during its final phase, Pepping was included in the Gottbegnadeten list of artists deemed crucial to the art of the Third Reich, and was therefore exempted from military service. Pepping taught again at the Berliner Hochschule from 1947 to 1968. He retired in 1968 and also stopped composing. He died in Spandau and is buried in Berlin's Friedhof Heerstra√üe Cemetery.  Composition  Pepping is regarded as one of the most important composers of Protestant church music in the 20th century. His sacred works for choir a cappella included masses such as the , motets and chorales, for example the collection Spandauer Chorbuch (Spandau choir book). He also composed secular vocal music, organ music, orchestral works including three symphonies, and chamber music. Pepping based his church music on Protestant hymns, the vocal polyphony of the 16th and 17th century and modal keys. Pepping first wrote severe works with \\"uncompromising dissonance\\". In the 1930s he wrote more compromising music, including a in 1931, a setting not of the Order of Mass, but a series of chorales related to the functions in the liturgy of the service, comparable to Schubert's and in 1938 a German mass, (German Mass: Kyrie God Father in Eternity) for a six-part mixed choir. On October 30, 1943 his Symphony No.2 in F minor was performed to great acclaim by the Berlin Philharmonic orchestra, conducted by Wilhelm Furtwangler, in Berlin. Pepping composed no more church music until 1948, when he wrote the , possibly as a \\"personal plea\\". The musicologist Sven Hiemke who analyzed the work in a book on Pepping's mass compositions notes that the work can be understood as (confessional music) even if the composer would disagree. Pepping's works were published by Schott. They are kept in the archive of the (Berlin Academy of the Arts). His is held by the .

The first guns were conversions of the Soviet 76 mm divisional gun M1936 (F-22). Later in the war, the Soviet USV and ZiS-3 76 mm divisional guns were also converted. Description The FK36(r) and Pak 36(r) both had a split-trail carriage, with a transverse leaf spring axle suspension, and steel wheels, with foam rubber filled tires. The guns were equipped with a semi-automatic vertical breech block; the recoil mechanism consisted of a hydraulic recoil buffer and a hydropneumatic recuperator. There was no limber; therefore the gun could not be towed by a horse team. Development history Soon after the German invasion of the USSR in 1941, Wehrmacht units encountered new Soviet tanks: the medium T-34 and the heavy KV. The thick sloped armor of these vehicles gave them a good degree of protection against German anti-tank weapons. The situation eventually led to requests for more powerful guns that would be able to destroy them from long range. Germany already had a suitable design, the 7.5 cm Pak 40, entering production in late 1941, but the first pieces were not delivered until 1942. Until enough of these could be manufactured, expedient solutions were required. In the early stages of Operation Barbarossa, the Germans captured a large number (approximately 1,300) of Soviet 76-mm divisional guns model 1936 (F-22). Developed with anti-tank abilities in mind, this Soviet gun had powerful ballistics; it was also originally intended to use a more powerful cartridge than the one eventually adopted. However, the design had some shortcomings in the anti-tank role: the shield was too high, the two man laying was inconvenient and the sighting system was more suitable for the F-22's original divisional field gun role. Using considerable thrift, German engineers were able to quickly modify the F-22, which by that time had been adopted in original form as the FK296(r) by the Wehrmacht. In late 1941, German engineers developed a modernization program. The initial modifications that brought the guns to FK36(r) standard included: * removing the top section of the shield and using the armour off-cuts to superimpose over the lower section of the shield. These were held in place using the standard Pak38 shield pintles. * re-orienting the traverse gear box and handwheel shaft linkages so as to mount the traverse handwheel on the left side of the gun next to the sight. As the new transverse rod linkage went through a gap in the recoil cradle's elevation arc, the maximum elevation angle was limited to 18 degrees. * replacing the Russian sight with a Pak 38 style anti-tank sighting block that could mount the standard ZF3x8 sighting telescope or an emergency fold out iron sight. Like the Pak 40 and Pak 97/38, the sight mount had provision for attaching an indirect sighting device - the Aushilfsrichtmittel 38 (ARM38). The first of these converted F-22s retained the original Russian ammunition (confirmed by measuring the chamber length of 15.2 inches or 385 mm) and were still designated FK296(r) on the sight's range drum. These early anti-tank conversions are discernible as they have not been fitted with a muzzle brake. These intermediate guns had various designations, but appear mainly to have been referred to as \\"FK36(r)\\", despite their dedicated anti- tank role seeming to warrant the designation \\"Pak\\" rather than \\"FK\\". The conversion work was performed by HANOMAG, with sight blocks made by Kerner & Co in 1942 (ggn42). Later upgrades were designated as the Pak36(r), and: * Were rechambered for the more powerful German Pak40 cartridge - which was nearly twice as long as the Soviet one (715 mm vs 385.3 mm) and also wider (100 mm vs 90 mm), resulting in 2.4 times the propellant load; and * Had recoil mechanism adjustments to accommodate the new recoil characteristics. Production The first guns were delivered in February 1942. By the end of 1942, the Germans had converted 358 pieces, with another 169 in 1943 and 33 in 1944. Additionally, 894 barrels were prepared for use in self-propelled guns. It is likely that these numbers include Pak 39(r), a similarly upgraded 76-mm M1939 (up to 300 pieces). {border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 style=\\"margin:0 0 .5em 1em; width:60%; background:#fff; border- collapse:collapse; border:1px solid #996; line-height:1.5; font-size:95%\\" |- style=\\"vertical-align:top; text-align:center; border:1px solid #996; background-color:#996; color:#fff; font-weight:bold;\\" colspan=\\"6\\"Production of the ammunition for PaK 36(r) and PaK 39(r)Shirokorad A.

The first employment of the FK36(r) was noted as early as March 1942 at Bir Hacheim in Libya; and, by May 1942, 117 are recorded as being in use by the Afrika Korps. The gun was well proven in combat, as demonstrated by Gunner G√ºnter Halm (Knights Cross), who destroyed nine Valentine Tanks in a single action. The Pak 36(r) was used later in the North African campaign. The gun was actively used in both anti-tank and field artillery roles until the end of the war. As late as March 1945, the Wehrmacht still possessed 165 Pak 36(r) and Pak 39(r). The scale of use can be illustrated by the amount of ammunition consumed: 49,000 AP and 8,170 subcaliber AP shells in 1942, and 151,390 in 1943. For the sake of comparison, in 1942 the Pak 40 fired 42,430 AP and 13,380 HEAT shells; in 1943 the numbers grew significantly, to 401,100 AP and 374,000 HEAT. The modernized barrels were also mounted in the following self- propelled guns: *7.62 cm Pak 36(r) auf Pz.IID Marder II (Sd.Kfz.132) - lightly armoured tank destroyer on a Panzer II light tank chassis. *7.62 cm Pak 36(r) auf Pz.38(t) Marder III (Sd.Kfz.139) - lightly armoured tank destroyer on a Panzer 38(t) light tank chassis. A number of Pak 36(r) guns were captured by the Red Army (e.g. in the Battle of Stalingrad) and were adopted by anti-tank battalions. Summary When the FK36(r) and Pak 36(r) reached the battlefield, they were able to destroy any contemporary tank at normal combat ranges. Although the guns were heavier and had somewhat smaller penetration figures than the purpose-built Pak 40, there is no doubt that the modernization of the F-22 provided the Wehrmacht with a very effective anti- tank gun at only a fraction of the cost of producing one from scratch.

Madhavan, Shamita Shetty and Sadha featured in the leading roles, while the film had songs and score composed by four music directors including G. V. Prakash Kumar and Dharan. A remake of the Hindi film, Darling (2007), the film was initially launched in 2006 as Ram Gopal Varma's production, but was eventually sold to Storm Pictures after Varma, Venkat and Madhavan had gone through creative differences. During post-production, the unit experienced further difficulties after the producer had failed to pay technicians, and subsequently the film did not have a theatrical release. Cast * Madhavan as Aditya * Shamita Shetty as Geeta * Sadha as Ashwini * Sayaji Shinde * Sriman * Sunil * Vizag Prasad * Master Praharsha * Baby Harshita Production In late 2006, it was announced that Ram Gopal Varma would produce his Tamil film, which would be a remake of his own Darling (2007), and Madhavan would star in the lead role. Varma's frequent collaborator, Kona Venkat, was announced to be the film's director. In January 2007, the film developed under the tentative title of Darling with Nisha Kothari reported to have joined the cast, though this later proved to be untrue. Shamita Shetty was announced as the film's lead actress in February 2007, marking a return to Tamil films after a period of five years. Sriya Reddy was subsequently added to the film's cast, with Reliance Adlabs joining the project as co-producers with Varma. However Sriya Reddy was sacked from the film, and after further unsuccessful attempts to bring in either Isha Sharvani, Esha Deol or Nandana Sen, Sadha was signed on for the role. The title of the film was changed to Leelai to recoup tax benefits. The team began filming the first schedule at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad during February 2007 with Madhavan and Shamita Shetty, and the makers announced that the film would also be dubbed and released in Telugu as Adi Oka Idile. Scenes were then canned in Chennai at the AVM Studios in June 2007, with scenes involving Sadha as the mother of a small child being shot. In mid 2007, Ram Gopal Varma opted out of the agreement and sold the film to Gaurav Sharma of Storm Pictures. Most of the filming was complete and only post-production works remained by mid 2007, with editing work taking place at Sabdalaya Theatres. During May 2008, the film was involved in a tussle over the title of Leelai, with Aascar Films claiming that they had registered the name for their own venture featuring newcomers. After losing the title, the film was renamed as Naan Aval Adhu in Tamil and Nenu Tanu Aame in Telugu. Further problems occurred when Sharma left Chennai without notice, amidst financial troubles, and consequently brought the shooting of the film to an abrupt halt. Sharma had then secretly worked on post-production works with a separate team, without informing the cast and crew of the film. Amidst reports of the film being shelved in mid-2008, a promotional campaign suddenly began and the producer released the trailer, album and video songs from the film. In September 2008, Madhavan filed a complaint against Gaurav Sharma and Storm Pictures to the Nadigar Sangam, stating that the producer had tried to release the film without informing or paying the actors or the director.http://www.sify.com/movies/boxoffice.php?id=14757582&cid;=13151866 Director Kona Venkat also successfully blocked Sharma from having a promotional event to mark the release of the film's Telugu soundtrack album. The deadlock continued into early 2009, after Sharma was only able to make a small payment towards the actors' remuneration.http://www.sify.com/movies/deadlock-over-naan-aval-adhu- continues-news-tamil-kkfsiTebgbjsi.html Subsequently, Sharma tried to release the film on his own, after using dubbing artistes instead of the original actors, but was unable to finance a release.http://www.sify.com/movies/maddy- loses-his-voice-news-tamil-kkfrVwgeaagsi.html Following the success of his other horror film, Yavarum Nalam (2009), Madhavan opted to end his protest and agreed to pave way for the release of the film and completed dubbing for his portions in July 2009 at Bharani Studios, Chennai. However remaining cast and crew remained unpaid, and the film subsequently did not have a theatrical release. Soundtrack The songs were composed by G. V. Prakash, Dharan, Prasanna and R. P. Patnaik,http://www.musicplug.in/songs.php?movieid=29359 while lyrics were written by Pa. Vijay and Na. Muthukumar. The film's trailer and soundtrack album was launched at a ceremony on 9 March 2009 at Sathyam Cinemas by Amruta Patki. Owing to the commercial dispute between the technicians and the producer, none of the cast or crew were present, though the cast of Gaurav Sharma's other ongoing venture, Kalla Kadhalan, including Sibiraj were present.

Symptoms Children with pancreatoblastoma rarely present with early-stage disease, instead, most present with locally advanced or metastatic disease. Common presenting symptoms include abdominal pain, emesis, and jaundice. A multidisciplinary approach including good clinical history, state of the art imaging, and careful pathology is often needed to establish the correct diagnosis. Pathology Resected pancreatoblastomas can be quite large, ranging from 2 centimeters to 20 centimeters in size (1 to 8 inches). They are typically solid, soft masses. Under the microscope, at least two cell types are seen: cells with ‚Äúacinar‚Äù differentiation, and cells forming small ‚Äúsquamoid‚Äù nests. The cells with acinar differentiation have some features of the normal acinar cell of the pancreas (the most common cell in the normal pancreas). Diagnosis Treatment If the tumor is operable, the first line of therapy should be surgical resection. Then, after surgical resection, adjuvant chemotherapy should be given, even in stage I disease. In patients with inoperable disease, chemotherapy alone should be given.http://www.orpha.net/data/patho/GB/uk-pancrea.pdf - A multi-disciplinary approach to the treatment, including surgeons, oncologists, pathologists, radiologists, and radiation oncologists, is often the best approach to managing these patients.

It starred Alan Herbert and featured various segments with puppets, clowns, and other entertainment. Herbert's character Captain Fortune spoke directly with the kids, live and without a script. At the height of the show's popularity, it aired three times during the weekdays and also on Saturday mornings. The show also included segments with Uncle Monty and Roy Kinghorn, and is perhaps best remembered for the show's introductory sequence, which involved the young children running into the Captain's house unannounced and gathering around a large barrel, which contained a mannequin (named \\"Short John O'Copper\\"). The Captain would sing \\"Who's that kno-o-cking on my barrel?\\" several times, after which a puppet would pop out of the top of the barrel and the Captain would put on a puppet show for the young viewers. Among the many actors who regularly contributed to the show was Les Foxcroft, best known for his stint on the Australian TV show The Last Resort, Chris Beard, Clifford Warne (with his puppet Gus) and Reg Quartly (in the role of \\"Uncle Reg\\" or \\"Uncle Reggie\\").The Sydney Morning Herald, 26 September 1960, p. 20. Alan Herbert, who played the part of Captain Fortune wore a false beard (which was later phased out as Herbert grew a real beard) and \\"naval uniform\\". After four years he left the show due to health problems. In addition to the show, Herbert was known for doing work for many charitable organizations involving children.

It is a specific type of exit provision that may be included in a shareholders' agreement, and may often be referred to as a buy-sell agreement. The shotgun clause allows a shareholder to offer a specific price per share for the other shareholder(s)' shares; the other shareholder(s) must then either accept the offer or buy the offering shareholder's shares at that price per share. Discussion Typically, an exit clause is triggered in situations where a business partnership has severely deteriorated, and so the situation is often likened to a divorce. In the same way that drawn-out battles between a splitting couple can often leave children with emotional damage, so too can a business be damaged by drawn-out fighting between its owners. For this reason, experts in the area emphasize the importance of including an exit clause in a firm's shareholders' agreement in order to minimize the negative impact of a business-divorce. As with a prenuptial agreement, it is important to set out an exit clause early on in a business relationship when interests are still aligned and partners still like each other. Shotgun clauses protect the interests of both or all parties regardless of their stake in the company. If one party decides to trigger the clause, it is in their best interest to make a well considered, fair offer - for if they make a low offer, their partner(s) may raise the resources to turn the offer against them, a counteroffer they would be bound to accept. Process The shareholder triggering the clause offers to buy the shares of the others at a specific price per share. The other shareholder(s) must then either accept the offer and sell their shares, or buy the triggering shareholders' shares at that same price. Alternatively, the clause can be structured so that the triggering shareholder offers to sell his shares at a specific price per share, and the other shareholders can then accept the offer or sell their shares to the triggering shareholder at the set price. The timeline is generally very short, although there are no hard and fast rules. It would not be unusual to have 20 to 40 days to elect to sell or buy, and another 20 to 40 days to close. If the recipient of the offer does not respond in the allotted period of time, the offer is assumed to have been accepted. Rationale The clause is most applicable when both partners want to run the company, but not together, and an amicable buy-out cannot be reached . It serves as a sort of last resort method for solving these disputes, while also helping to ensure that a fair price is offered. When triggering a shotgun clause, the offering partner does not know whether they will end up buying or selling their shares, so the individual must ‚Äì in theory ‚Äì pick a price that they would find acceptable in either outcome, thus preventing large over- or under-valuations of the firm. Financing Shotgun clauses tend to favour people with cash readily available. Once a shotgun clause has been triggered, shareholders can often face difficulties obtaining traditional financing in order to buy the other shareholders' shares, due largely to the very short timeline of the transaction. Financing commitments from traditional banks typically take too long to obtain, and lenders often avoid situations where management conflicts are likely to disrupt the business. This means that owners facing a triggered shotgun clause are often forced to rely on their own resources if they wish to fend off being bought out. However, there are some private equity and venture capital firms that specialize in providing capital for shotgun situations. Economics In academic circles it has been argued that, under certain circumstances, these clauses are not economically efficient in that the partner who values the company most is not always the one that ends up buying the company. De Frutos and Kittsteiner suggest in their paper that in order to ensure an efficient outcome, there should not be a contractual obligation for the party who triggers the clause to name the price. Instead, they advocate including in the termination agreement a clause stating that the parties will negotiate for the right to be the person who chooses whether to buy or sell at the price specified by the other partner. They suggest that this negotiation take the form of an ascending auction where the shareholders bid for the right not to set the price per share. Each partner raises his/her bid continuously, but either partner can drop out of the auction at any time. The party that drops out becomes the one who must propose the price per share, but that person receives a payment from the other partner equal to the bid at which the auction ended.

Production history Scott Miller was persuaded by 125 Records to record the album, which was his final work to be released before his death in 2013. Miller had considered releasing it under his own name with Barbeau; however, at the label's request, the album was credited to \\"The Loud Family and Anton Barbeau,\\" to avoid confusion between Miller and a similarly named country musician. Previous members of the Loud Family returned for the album, with drummer Jozef Becker and bass player Kenny Kessel playing on most of the tracks, and drummer Gil Ray and keyboard player Alison Faith Levy making a single appearance. Miller and Barbeau each contributed four original songs to the album, with one co-written song. The group also covered \\"Rocks Off\\" by The Rolling Stones, \\"I Think I See the Light\\" by Cat Stevens, and \\"Remember You\\" by The Zombies.

Located in the southwestern part of the city, where besides Yangcheon District and Geumcheon District Guro District has an important position as a transport link which contains railroads, land routes from the rest of Seoul to the south of the country. The Gyeongbu and Gyeongin railway lines connect Seoul to Busan and Incheon. In addition, Seoul Metropolitan Subway lines 1, 2, and 7, and major highways intersect in Guro District. The name Guro originates from the legend that nine () old men (Korean: ro) enjoyed longevity in the district. A digital industrial complex is located in Guro District. The Guro Digital Industrial Complex, which played a leading industrial role mainly with textile manufacturing, dressmaking and other labour-intensive industries in 1967, has been rapidly changed into an IT industrial complex. This complex played a pivotal role in the economic growth of the South Korea's development era, referred to as the \\"Miracle on the Han River\\", and also contributed 10 percent of national export in the 1970s. Twenty-one percent of the total area of Guro District is a restricted zone to be used as a greenbelt with the only arboretum in Seoul. The zone is changing into a lively district as large labour-intensive factories are moving from the area and the council is developing what it terms its four zones. An \\"e-government\\" system based on this hosted the international e-participation forum on February 7‚Äì9, 2007, with the participation of more than thirty-seven countries. The forum was launched with the theme \\"Promoting Democracy and Regional Development\\" and twenty-five mayors including Andr√© Santini (Issy-les-Moulineaux, France), Kevin Foy (Chapel Hill, US), Apirak Kosayothin (Bangkok, Thailand), Uvais Mohamed Emthiyas (Colombo, Sri Lanka), and world experts such as Dr William H. Dutton (Director of Oxford Internet Institute at the University of Oxford, UK) and Dr Ari-Veiko Anttiroiko (professor at the University of Tampere, Finland) participated in the forum. The Guro Declaration, adopted during the forum, aims to set up a portal site for e-government development and to establish a concrete project in order to bridge the digital divide among the world's cities. This practice has been recognised for providing a new important step in the development of e-democracy. The e-participation forum was a key factor for Guro to play the leading role in bridging the digital divide among cities, to provide I.T. enterprises located in Guro Digital Industrial Complex the opportunity to launch into the international market, to improve its image and become a global leader to concrete e-democracy. The international e-participation forum on February 7‚Äì9, 2007 History History of Guro can be divided into two origins: old Bupyeong and old Siheung areas. The eastern part was known as Ingbeollo-hyeon (‰ªç‰ºêÂ•¥Á∏£ ‚Äì meaning ‚Äòland spreading‚Äô) during the Goguryeo Dynasty (37 BC - AD 668) but it changed into Gogyang-hyeon (Á©ÄÂ£§Á∏£) in the period of the Unified Silla Dynasty (668 - 935), and again changed into Geumju (Ë°øÂ∑û) and Siheung (ÂßãËàà) during the Goryeo Dynasty (918 - 1392). Following a complete reorganisation of the district in 1413, it changed to Geumcheon- hyeon (Ë°øÂ∑ùÁ∏£), later into Siheung-hyeon (ÂßãËààÁ∏£) in 1795, and became part of Siheung-gun(ÂßãËààÈÉ°), Gyeonggi Province, until 1949. The western part was known as Jubuto-gun (‰∏ªÂ§´ÂúüÈÉ°) during the Goguryeo Dynasty (37 BC - AD 668) but it changed into Jangje-gun (Èï∑Â†§ÈÉ°) in the period of the Unified Silla Dynasty (668 - 935), and again changed into Annam(ÂÆâÂçó), Gyeyang(Ê°ÇÈôΩ), Gilju(ÂêâÂ∑û) and Bupyeong(ÂØåÂπ≥) during the Goryeo Dynasty (918 - 1392). In Joseon era, this area was mainly part of Sutan Township of Bupyeong Dohobu or Bupyeong Metropolitan Prefecture. In 1895, Bupyeong Dohobu was downgraded to Bupyeong County, and it was merged with outer part of old Incheon City to form Bucheon County. On August 13, 1949, the eastern part was incorporated in the enlarged administrative district of Seoul and eastern part of Sosa Town of Bucheon County was incorporated to Seoul in 1963. This area remained in the jurisdiction of Yeongdeungpo until April 1, 1980 when Guro became a new district. Neighbourhoods of Cheolsan and Gwangmyeong were once considered for annexation to Guro, but the plan foundered as government officials were afraid of further boundary expansion of Seoul and consequently Gwangmyeong City was established in place of the annexation plan. Geography There are nineteen dong in Guro District, which has an area of 20.11 km¬≤, covering 3.3% of the total area of Seoul. Among the nineteen dong, Oryu 2-dong is the largest (4.6 km¬≤), while Garibong 2-dong is the smallest (0.14 km¬≤). The district is composed of 7.08 km¬≤ (35.2%) which is residential, 0.42 km¬≤ (2.1%) commercial, 6.89 km¬≤ (34.3%) industrial and 5,72 km¬≤ (28.4%) as a green belt. The geography is mostly flat, but there are some hills in the western area of the district 100 m above sea level. Development of Guro District's Four Zones Textile manufacturing, dressmaking, and other labour-intensive industries declined after the 1990s and this affected regional development and became the cause of many problems. Because of this, Guro District council has divided the district into four zones and has started developing each zone according to its characteristics in order to revitalise the economy of the area. After the reorganisation of the industrial structure in the late 1990s, more than 80% of I.T. companies settled in the area, creating the Guro Digital Industrial Complex. Meanwhile, many apartments were built replacing the old textile manufacturing factories to become a new, attractive residential area for south-west Seoul. The Development of Guro District's Four Zones is intended to be the centre for environmentally friendly residences, cutting-edge digital industry and logistics. Garibong Redevelopment Zone Guro District is developing the Garibong-dong area located between Guro Digital Complex 1 and Complexes 2 and 3. This area is encompassed by the strategic business district, residential facilities and an ecological park located in the centre of the area. The Guro Digital Complex area is expected to become an Asian version of Silicon Valley once this project is completed in 2013. Development of areas adjacent to Sindorim and Guro stations Sindorim, the northern gateway to Guro, is a landmark of the District and is developed to be the new point for growth. The 'D3 city' Twin Building, once the construction is over, will accommodate hotels, convention centres and multi-purpose business centres, while ‚ÄòTechno Mart‚Äô and ‚ÄòMirae-Sarang City‚Äô will create the largest electronic mall in Asia. Development of the Gaebong Residential Area The area of Gaebong-dong and Gocheok-dong is in the center of Guro District and the prison that is currently located in this area will be moved to the outskirts of the district by 2009. Instead, residential facilities, commercial and business centers are planned to be built. Moreover, the southern district will accommodate cultural arts centers and sports facilities including an e-sports arena. New Town Development on the Southwestern Outskirts The areas of Sugung-dong, Hang- dong, and Cheonwang-dong, located on the boundary with Gyeonggi-do, have plenty of green areas. These areas have developed into a new environmentally friendly town with forests and streams. The Se-jong Science High School opened its doors in March 2008 and the development of the first city-subsidised arboretum in Seoul is underway in this area. Thus, the new town will be the most eco-friendly residential landmark in Seoul. The Anyang stream, the longest tributary of the Han River in Seoul, runs south to north, through the centre of Guro District. The water pollution of the Anyang Stream was once extremely severe, but now the water quality level has increased significantly, fish have returned and it has become very popular among local residents. In order to celebrate the cleanness of the stream, 'Walking in Anyang stream' event is held every year under Jump Guro Festival. Celebrities and local residents walk together announcing the cleanness of the stream and the importance of the environment. Now there is a riverside cycle path, soccer field, badminton court, inline skating rink, plaza and wildlife garden along the river and many other sports facilities around the area. Guro District has an excellent Extended Stay Hotel named TEA TOWN.

Night view of Guro Digital Complex. Guro Industrial Complex, the first industrial complex of the country, was created in Guro 3-dong in 1967. The World Industrial Exhibition held in Guro District in 1968 contributed to remarkable development of Guro Industrial Complex and the textile manufacturing, dressmaking, and other labour-intensive industries dubbed the \\"Miracle on the Han River\\" during the 1960s and 1970s. Guro Industrial Complex contributed 10% of national export. The Guro Industrial Complex has rapidly changed from a manufacturing industrial zone into a futuristic industrial hub, centering on research and development activities, advanced information and knowledge industries since 2000, and has developed into the largest digital industrial complex in Korea. As of 2008, there are about 8,000 venture companies with more than 100,000 staff in an area of two million m¬≤. Moreover, it is the hub for the nation's high-tech industry which continuously focuses on R&D;, high-tech knowledge and information industry. More than 80% of the companies are I.T. companies with a total production of about 5.5 trillion won and an export of about 1.5 trillion won. Especially importantly, the Korea Venture Business Association is located in Guro Industrial Complex. Government and infrastructure Local government The administration of Guro District is mainly composed of digital, sanitary and welfare administration. Digital administration The digital administration is the embodiment of e-government standards. Guro District combines high tech information technology and administration to provide a digital administrative service to the citizens and a good business environment to companies. *E-Services refers to e-procurement, health check-up appointments at the district public health centre, civil affairs, tailored bidding information services available via the Internet, a cyber culture centre and cyber shopping mall for business. *E-Administration refers to e-approvals, knowledge management, and performance-based personnel management systems that allow quick and efficient administration with no use of paper. *E-Information is the OPEN (Online Procedures Enhancement for Civil Applications) system, newsletters, Internet broadcasting and integrated administrative information system in order to provide citizens with real-time results on topics of civil affairs as well as a wide range of useful information. *E-Participation is the email to the Mayor, environment-related reporting via the Internet, a Cyber Policy Forum, Cyber Citizen Panels, Citizen Opinion Polling with short message services via the Internet and mobile tools, contests for citizens' best ideas, submission of citizens' comments regarding regulations, and citizens participating in the budget process. Sanitary administration Ggalggeumi Volunteers. Guro Public Health Centre. Sanitary Administration is concentrating its efforts to reduce environmental pollution and expand the green zone in the area of Guro Industrial Complex that was once seriously polluted. Many citizens are actively participating in environmental organisations such as Ansamo and Hwansamo. Especially, the Ggalggeumi Volunteers revived the practice of citizens cleaning up their neighborhood streets and roads on a daily basis with the participation of about 12,000 citizens, which became the first citizens‚Äô voluntary organisation in the area of environment. Years of restoration efforts have resulted in upgrading the water quality of the Anyang Stream, and also the Dorim and Mokgam streams, which are tributaries of the Anyang stream, will be restored to be more ecologically sound rivers. The degree of air pollution in Guro District is about 0.004ppm of sulphuric acid gas and 0.4ppm of nitrogen monoxide, much lower than the average level of Seoul Metropolitan area and the WHO standard. Welfare administration Among many welfare administrative services, Guro District especially has the u-healthcare and supporting disabled people policy. The u-healthcare system is the service provided by Guro Public Health Centre's doctors through mobile phones or PDA to patients with diabetes, blood pressure, obesity, respiratory disease and other conditions. Physicians retrieve data for diagnosis and treatment as needed. This service is provided either at home or at the dong office. This is the first time in the country that this kind of service has been executed using a high-tech healthcare system policy. Guro District runs the Welfare and Computer Education Centres for the disabled, lends equipment for low-income disabled, supports in-house repairing and provides many other facilities that made the district the top disabled supporter for the last 4 consecutive years among the 25 districts of Seoul.

Most of her research is dedicated to the study of cancer and cancer precursors. Born in Iran and raised in Canada, she is currently an associate professor in Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University at Albany, State University of New York (SUNY), where she has been teaching multiple courses, including those she developed in genetic and molecular epidemiology. Through her research she has been contributing to the understanding of hereditary causes of diseases as well as the influence of gene-environment interactions on the risk of developing disease. Education Roxana received her B.Sc. with honors, M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, Canada. Following her Ph.D. under the mentorship of Drs. J.M. Friedman and Steven Narod, she completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) under the supervision of Mitchell Gail. While a postdoctoral fellow at the NIH, she received an adjunct assistant professor position at George Washington University (GWU), where she developed a course entitled \\"controversies in cancer epidemiology\\" with Paul Levine. Research thumb The overarching theme of Roxana Moslehi's research has been identification and characterization of cancer susceptibility genes. Working with Drs. Steven Narod and J.M. Friedman, her study was among the first to estimate the penetrance of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations for breast, ovarian and other cancers in a study of Jewish women with ovarian cancer.http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJHG/journal/issues/v66n4/990518/990518.html Roxana expanded her studies of breast and ovarian cancer to other populations, including those in the Middle East, some understudied at the time. For example, through collaboration with physicians in Iran, Moslehi conducted studies on Iranian hereditary breast and ovarian cancer families, which led to the discovery of a novel BRCA1 mutation.http://www.g3m.ir/browse.php?cur=1&slct;_pg_id=18&sid;=1&slc;_lang=en Roxana has also made significant contributions to research on modifiers of BRCA-associated breast and ovarian cancer risk as well as to the understanding of mechanistic and population genetic aspects of the BRCA genes, now the most studied hereditary cancer predisposing genes in the human genome. In one such study, she investigated the impact of mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes on female fertility as a potential mechanism influencing positive selection for BRCA mutations. Roxana Moslehi's hypotheses extend beyond the BRCA genes to other cancer susceptibility genes and disorders. Recently, she published a series of studies on the adverse effects of abnormalities in DNA repair and transcription genes on human reproduction and development. Based on her novel clinical observations in trichothiodystrophy (TTD) families, Roxana developed the hypothesis that defects in the nucleotide excision repair and transcription genes have adverse effects on human fetal and placental development. Subsequently, she proposed impairment of TFIIH-mediated function in transcription in placenta as one mechanism leading to gestational complications such as preeclampsia and highlighted the relevance of the fetal genotype and the exact genetic abnormality to this mechanism. In addition to breast and ovarian cancer, Roxana has been conducting genetic and epidemiologic investigations of other cancer and cancer precursors, such as Colorectal adenoma, Lung cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. More recently, Moslehi was awarded a research grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH to conduct a study to explore the link between autoimmune disorders and cancer, specifically non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Roxana Moslehi awarded NIH grant for a study to explore the link between chronic fatigue syndrome and the risk of cancer. Awards thumb Roxana Moslehi is a recipient of multiple awards and honors, including the Graduate Teaching Assistant Award for Excellence in Teaching (UBC), a Biovision Fellowship from Acad√©mie des Sciences (France), two Awards for Research Excellence from the NIH, and the Golden Apple Award for Excellence in Teaching from School of Public Health at SUNY Albany.

In mathematics, Wiener deconvolution is an application of the Wiener filter to the noise problems inherent in deconvolution. It works in the frequency domain, attempting to minimize the impact of deconvolved noise at frequencies which have a poor signal-to-noise ratio. The Wiener deconvolution method has widespread use in image deconvolution applications, as the frequency spectrum of most visual images is fairly well behaved and may be estimated easily. Wiener deconvolution is named after Norbert Wiener.  Definition  Given a system: :\\\\ y(t) = (h*x)(t) + n(t) where * denotes convolution and: *\\\\ x(t) is some original signal (unknown) at time \\\\ t . *\\\\ h(t) is the known impulse response of a linear time-invariant system *\\\\ n(t) is some unknown additive noise, independent of \\\\ x(t) *\\\\ y(t) is our observed signal Our goal is to find some \\\\ g(t) so that we can estimate \\\\ x(t) as follows: :\\\\ \\\\hat{x}(t) = (g*y)(t) where \\\\ \\\\hat{x}(t) is an estimate of \\\\ x(t) that minimizes the mean square error : \\\\ \\\\epsilon(t) = \\\\mathbb{E} \\\\leftx(t) - \\\\hat{x}(t) \\\\right|^2, with \\\\ \\\\mathbb{E} denoting the expectation. The Wiener deconvolution filter provides such a \\\\ g(t). The filter is most easily described in the frequency domain: :\\\\ G(f) = \\\\frac{H^*(f)S(f)}{ |H(f)|^2 S(f) + N(f) } where: * \\\\ G(f) and \\\\ H(f) are the Fourier transforms of \\\\ g(t) and \\\\ h(t), * \\\\ S(f) = \\\\mathbb{E}|X(f)|^2 is the mean power spectral density of the original signal \\\\ x(t), * \\\\ N(f) = \\\\mathbb{E}|V(f)|^2 is the mean power spectral density of the noise \\\\ n(t), * X(f), Y(f), and V(f) are the Fourier transforms of x(t), and y(t), and n(t), respectively, * the superscript {}^* denotes complex conjugation. The filtering operation may either be carried out in the time-domain, as above, or in the frequency domain: :\\\\ \\\\hat{X}(f) = G(f)Y(f) and then performing an inverse Fourier transform on \\\\ \\\\hat{X}(f) to obtain \\\\ \\\\hat{x}(t). Note that in the case of images, the arguments \\\\ t and \\\\ f above become two-dimensional; however the result is the same.  Interpretation  The operation of the Wiener filter becomes apparent when the filter equation above is rewritten: : \\\\begin{align} G(f) & = \\\\frac{1}{H(f)} \\\\left[ \\\\frac{ 1 }{ 1 + 1/(|H(f)|^2 \\\\mathrm{SNR}(f))} \\\\right] \\\\end{align} Here, \\\\ 1/H(f) is the inverse of the original system, \\\\ \\\\mathrm{SNR}(f) = S(f)/N(f) is the signal-to-noise ratio, and \\\\ |H(f)|^2 \\\\mathrm{SNR}(f) is the ratio of the pure filtered signal to noise spectral density. When there is zero noise (i.e. infinite signal-to-noise), the term inside the square brackets equals 1, which means that the Wiener filter is simply the inverse of the system, as we might expect. However, as the noise at certain frequencies increases, the signal-to-noise ratio drops, so the term inside the square brackets also drops. This means that the Wiener filter attenuates frequencies according to their filtered signal-to-noise ratio. The Wiener filter equation above requires us to know the spectral content of a typical image, and also that of the noise. Often, we do not have access to these exact quantities, but we may be in a situation where good estimates can be made. For instance, in the case of photographic images, the signal (the original image) typically has strong low frequencies and weak high frequencies, while in many cases the noise content will be relatively flat with frequency.  Derivation  As mentioned above, we want to produce an estimate of the original signal that minimizes the mean square error, which may be expressed: :\\\\ \\\\epsilon(f) = \\\\mathbb{E} \\\\leftX(f) - \\\\hat{X}(f) \\\\right|^2 . The equivalence to the previous definition of \\\\epsilon, can be derived using Plancherel theorem or Parseval's theorem for the Fourier transform. If we substitute in the expression for \\\\ \\\\hat{X}(f), the above can be rearranged to : \\\\begin{align} \\\\epsilon(f) & = \\\\mathbb{E} \\\\leftX(f) - G(f)Y(f) \\\\right|^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\mathbb{E} \\\\leftX(f) - G(f) \\\\left[ H(f)X(f) + V(f) \\\\right] \\\\right|^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\mathbb{E} \\\\big\\\\left[ 1 - G(f)H(f) \\\\right] X(f) - G(f)V(f) \\\\big|^2 \\\\end{align} If we expand the quadratic, we get the following: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\epsilon(f) & = \\\\Big[ 1-G(f)H(f) \\\\Big] \\\\Big[ 1-G(f)H(f) \\\\Big]^*\\\\, \\\\mathbb{E}|X(f)|^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ & {} - \\\\Big[ 1-G(f)H(f) \\\\Big] G^*(f)\\\\, \\\\mathbb{E}\\\\Big\\\\\\\\{X(f)V^*(f)\\\\Big\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & {} - G(f) \\\\Big[ 1-G(f)H(f) \\\\Big]^*\\\\, \\\\mathbb{E}\\\\Big\\\\\\\\{V(f)X^*(f)\\\\Big\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & {} + G(f) G^*(f)\\\\, \\\\mathbb{E}|V(f)|^2 \\\\end{align} However, we are assuming that the noise is independent of the signal, therefore: :\\\\ \\\\mathbb{E}\\\\Big\\\\\\\\{X(f)V^*(f)\\\\Big\\\\\\\\} = \\\\mathbb{E}\\\\Big\\\\\\\\{V(f)X^*(f)\\\\Big\\\\\\\\} = 0 Substituting the power spectral densities \\\\ S(f) and \\\\ N(f) , we have: : \\\\epsilon(f) = \\\\Big[ 1-G(f)H(f) \\\\Big]\\\\Big[ 1-G(f)H(f) \\\\Big]^ * S(f) + G(f)G^*(f)N(f) To find the minimum error value, we calculate the Wirtinger derivative with respect to \\\\ G(f) and set it equal to zero. :\\\\ \\\\frac{d\\\\epsilon(f)}{dG(f)} = G^*(f)N(f) - H(f)\\\\Big[1 - G(f)H(f)\\\\Big]^* S(f) = 0 This final equality can be rearranged to give the Wiener filter.

Acheiropoieta (Medieval Greek: , \\"made without hand\\"; singular acheiropoieton) ‚Äî also called Icons Made Without Hands (and variants) ‚Äî are Christian icons which are said to have come into existence miraculously; not created by a human. Invariably these are images of Jesus or the Virgin Mary. The most notable examples that are credited by tradition among the faithful are, in the Eastern church the Mandylion, also known as the Image of Edessa, and the Hodegetria (depending on the version of their origin stories followed‚Äîin many versions both are painted by human painters of Jesus or Mary while alive), and several Russian icons, and in the West the Shroud of Turin, Veil of Veronica, Our Lady of Guadalupe, and Manoppello Image. The term is also used of icons that are only regarded as normal human copies of a miraculously created original archetype. Although the most famous acheiropoieta today are mostly icons in paint on wood panel, they exist with other media, such as mosaics, painted tile, and cloth. Ernst Kitzinger distinguished two types: \\"Either they are images believed to have been made by hands other than those of ordinary mortals or else they are claimed to be mechanical, though miraculous, impressions of the original\\".Kitzinger, 113 The belief in such images becomes prominent only in the 6th century, by the end of which both the Mandylion and the Image of Camuliana were well known. The pilgrim Antoninus of Piacenza was shown a relic of the Veil of Veronica type in Memphis, Egypt in the 570s.Kitzinger, 113-114 Background God the Father painting Our Lady of Guadalupe, an unusual Marian image, 18th century. Such images functioned as powerful relics as well as icons, and their images were naturally seen as especially authoritative as to the true appearance of the subject. Like other icon types believed to be painted from the live subject, such as the Hodegetria (thought to have been painted by Luke the Evangelist), they therefore acted as important references for other images in the tradition. They therefore were copied on an enormous scale, and the belief that such images existed, and authenticated certain facial types, played an important role in the conservatism of iconographic traditions such as the Depiction of Jesus.Grigg, throughout Beside, and conflated with, the developed legend of the Image of Edessa, was the tale of the Veil of Veronica, whose name was wrongly interpreted in a typical case of popular etymology to mean \\"true icon\\" or \\"true image\\", the fear of a \\"false image\\" remaining strong. Conventional images believed to be authentic A further and larger group of images, sometimes overlapping with acheiropoieta in popular tradition, were believed in the Early Middle Ages to have been created by conventional means in New Testament times, often by New Testament figures who, like many monks of the later period, were believed to have practiced as artists. The best known of these, and the most commonly credited in the West, was Saint Luke, who was long believed to have had the Virgin Mary sit for her portrait, but in the East a number of other figures were believed by many to have created images, including narrative ones. Saint Peter was said to have \\"illustrated his own account of the Transfiguration\\", Luke to have illustrated an entire Gospel Book, and the late 7th century Frankish pilgrim Arculf reported seeing in the Holy Land a cloth woven or embroidered by the Virgin herself with figures of Jesus and the apostles. The apostles were also said to have been very active as patrons, commissioning cycles in illuminated manuscripts and fresco in their churches.Grigg, 5-6, 5 quoted Such beliefs clearly projected contemporary practices back to the 1st century, and in their developed form are not found before the lead-up to the Iconoclastic Controversy, but in the 4th century, Eusebius, who disapproved of images, accepted that \\"the features of His apostles Peter and Paul, and indeed of Christ himself, have been preserved in coloured portraits which I have examined\\". Many famous images, including the Image of Edessa and Hodegetria, were described in versions of their stories as this type of image. The belief that images presumably of the 6th century at the earliest were authentic products of the 1st century distorted any sense of stylistic anachronism, making it easier for further images to be accepted, just as the belief in acheiropoieta, which must have reflected a divine standard of realism and accuracy, distorted early medieval perceptions of what degree of realism was possible in art, accounting for the praise very frequently given to images for their realism, when to modern eyes the surviving corpus has little of this. The standard depictions of both the features of the leading New Testament figures, and the iconography of key narrative scenes, seemed to have their authenticity confirmed by images believed to have been created either by direct witnesses or those able to hear the accounts of witnesses, or alternatively God himself or his angels. Acheiropoieta of 836 Such icons were seen as powerful arguments against iconoclasm. In a document apparently produced in the circle of the Patriarch of Constantinople, which purports to be the record of a (fictitious) Church council of 836, a list of acheiropoieta and icons miraculously protected is given as evidence for divine approval of icons. The acheiropoieta listed are: :1. the Image of Edessa, described as still at Edessa; :2. the image of the Virgin at Lod, Israel, which was said to have miraculously appeared imprinted on a column of a church built by the apostles Peter and John; :3. another image of the Virgin, three cubits high, at Lod in Israel, which was said to have miraculously appeared in another church. The nine other miracles listed deal with the maintenance rather than creation of icons, which resist or repair the attacks of assorted pagans, Arabs, Persians, scoffers, madmen, iconoclasts and Jews. This list seems to have had a regional bias, as other then-famous images are not mentioned, such as the Image of Camuliana, later brought to the capital. Another example, and the only one which indisputably still exists, is a mosaic of the young Christ from the sixth century in the church of Latomos Monastery in Thessaloniki (now dedicated to Saint David). This was apparently covered by plaster during the Iconoclastic period, towards the end of which an earthquake caused the plaster to fall down, revealing the image (during the reign of Leo V, 813-20). However, this was only a subsidiary miracle, according to the account we have. This says that the mosaic was being constructed secretly, during the 4th century persecution of Galerius, as an image of the Virgin, when it suddenly was transformed overnight into the present image of Christ.Grigg, 6; Cormac Notable examples 10th century depiction of the legend of King Abgarus Image of Edessa According to Christian legend, the image of Edessa, (known to the Eastern Orthodox Church as the Mandylion, a Medieval Greek word not applied in any other context), was a holy relic consisting of a square or rectangle of cloth upon which a miraculous image of the face of Jesus was imprinted -- the first icon (\\"image\\"). According to legend, Abgar V wrote to Jesus, asking him to come cure him of an illness. Abgar received an answering letter from Jesus, declining the invitation, but promising a future visit by one of his disciples. Along with the letter went a likeness of Jesus. This legend was first recorded in the early fourth century by Eusebius,Eusebius, Historia Ecclesiae 1.13.5 and .22. who said that he had transcribed and translated the actual letter in the Syriac chancery documents of the king of Edessa. Instead, Thaddeus of Edessa, one of the seventy disciples, is said to have come to Edessa, bearing the words of Jesus, by the virtues of which the king was miraculously healed. The first record of the existence of a physical image in the ancient city of Edessa (now ≈ûanlƒ±urfa) was in Evagrius Scholasticus, writing about 600, who reports a portrait of Christ, of divine origin (Œ∏ŒµœåœÑŒµœÖŒ∫œÑŒøœÇ), which effected the miraculous aid in the defence of Edessa against the Persians in 544.Evagrius, in Jacques Paul Migne, Patrologia Graecalxxxvi, 2, cols. 2748f, noted by Runciman 1931, p. 240, note 5; remarking that \\"the portrait of Christ has entered the class of Œ±œáŒµŒπœÅŒøœÄŒøŒØŒ∑œÑŒøŒπ icons\\". The image was moved to Constantinople in the 10th century. The cloth disappeared from Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade [Sack of Constantinople] in 1204, reappearing as a relic in King Louis IX of France's Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. It finally disappeared in the French Revolution.Two documentary inventories: year 1534 (Gerard of St. Quentin de l'Isle, Paris) and year 1740. See Grove Dictionary of Art, Steven Runciman, Some Remarks on the Image of Edessa, Cambridge Historical Journal 1931, and Shroud.com for a list of the group of relics. See also an image of the Gothic reliquary dating from the 13th century , in Histor.ws . The Ancha icon in Georgia is reputed to be the Keramidion, another acheiropoietos recorded from an early period, miraculously imprinted with the face of Christ by contact with the Mandylion. To art historians, it is a Georgian icon of the 6th-7th century. Image of Camuliana Although it is now little known, having probably been destroyed in the period of Byzantine Iconoclasm,Beckwith, 88, although Heinrich Pfeiffer identifies it with the Veil of Veronica and Manoppello Image:Heinrich Pfeiffer, \\"The concept of \\"acheiropoietos\\", the iconography of the face of Christ and the veil of Manoppello\\", in di Lazzaro, ) the icon of Christ from Camuliana in Cappadocia was the most famous Greek example, certainly from the time it reached Constantinople in 574, after which it was used as a palladium in battles by Philippikos, Priscus and Heraclius, and in the Pannonian Avar Siege of Constantinople in 626, and praised by George Pisida.Kitzinger, 111-112; Emerick, 356-357. Most fully covered by Von Dobsch√ºtz, like most of the images here  Lateran Palace image in Rome  This image, also called the Uronica,B.M. Bolton, \\"Advertise the Message: Images in Rome at the Turn of the Twelfth Century\\", in D. Wood (ed) The Church and the Arts (Oxford, 1992) p. 117 is kept in what was once the pope's private chapel, in a room now known as the Sancta Sanctorum at the top of the Scala Sancta in a surviving part of the old Lateran Palace in Rome. The legend is that this image was begun by Luke the Evangelist and finished by angels. It is thought that the icon was painted in Rome between the 5th and 6th century. Today only slight traces under overpainting remain of the original image of a Christ in Majesty with a crossed halo, in the classic pose of the Teacher holding the Scroll of the Law in His left hand while His right is raised in benediction. Many times restored, the face completely changed when Pope Alexander III (1159‚Äì1181) had the present one, painted on silk, placed over the original. Innocent III (1189‚Äì1216) covered the rest of the holy icon with an embossed silver riza, but other later embellishments completely covered its surface. It has also been cleaned during the recent restoration. The image in its setting in the Pontifical Sanctuary of the Holy Stairs, Rome. The doors protecting the icon, also in embossed silver, are of the 15th century. It has a baldachin in metal and gilded wood over it, replacing the one by Caradaossi (1452‚Äì1527) lost during the sack of Rome in 1527. The image itself was last inspected by the Jesuit art historian J. Wilpert in 1907.Bolton, ibid. p. 120 As early as the reign of Pope Sergius I (687‚Äì701) there are records of the image being carried in annual procession at certain feasts, and Pope Stephen II (752‚Äì757) carried the image on his shoulders in a procession to counter a threat from the Lombards. By the ninth century its elaborate procession had become a focus of the Feast of the Assumption. In the Middle Ages the Pope and the seven cardinal-bishops would celebrate masses in the small sanctuary where it was housed, and at times would kiss its feet.Bolton, ibid. pp. 126-128 Although no longer a specific liturgical object, some Romans still venerate this icon, considering it a last hope in disasters and memorable events in the capital, a veneration which can be compared with that for the other ancient icon of the Salus Populi Romani in Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, again in Rome. The former icon used to be taken across Rome annually in procession to \\"meet\\" the latter on the Feast of the Assumption. The Veil of Veronica Veronica's Veil, known in Italian as the Volto Santo or Holy Face (but not to be confused with the carved crucifix Volto Santo of Lucca) is a legendary relic. The legend is of medieval origin, and only a feature of the Western church; its connection with any single surviving physical image is slighter still, though a number of images have been associated with it, several probably always meant to be received as copies. The image in the Vatican has a certain priority, if only because of the prestige of the papacy. The nuns of San Silvestro in Capite in Rome were forbidden to exhibit their rival image in 1517 to avoid competition with the Vatican Veronica; it is also now in the Vatican. Like the Genoa image, it is painted on panel and therefore is likely to have always been intended to be a copy. The legend says that Veronica (a name meaning \\"true image\\") from Jerusalem encountered Jesus along the Via Dolorosa on the way to Calvary. When she paused to wipe the sweat (Latin suda) off his face with her veil, his image was imprinted on the cloth. The event is commemorated by one of the Stations of the Cross. According to legend, Veronica later traveled to Rome to present the cloth to the Roman Emperor Tiberius. Legend has it that it has miraculous properties, being able to quench thirst, restore sight, and sometimes even raise the dead. Recent studies trace the association of the name with the image The Rediscovered Face - 1 first of four installments of an audiovisual presentation relating the holy image with a number of ancient predecessors, YouTube, access date March 2013. to the translation of Eastern relics to the West at the time of the Crusades. Manoppello Image Manoppello Image In 1999, German Jesuit Father Heinnrich Pfeiffer, Professor of Art History at the Pontifical Gregorian University,Excerpt of Il Volto Santo di Manoppello (The Holy Face of Manoppello), published by Carsa Edizioni in Pescara (page 13) access date March 2013 announced at a press conference in Rome that he had found the Veil in a church of the Capuchin monastery, in the small village of Manoppello, Italy, where it had been in the custody of the Capuchin Friars since 1660. The image, known as the Manoppello Image is attested to by Father Donato da Bomba in his \\"Relatione historica\\" research tracing back to 1640. Recent studiesSudarium Christi The Face of Christ online audio visual featuring texts by sudarium expert Sr. Blandina Paschalis Schl√∂mer et al. have revealed noted congruities with the Shroud, see below. In September 2006 Pope Benedict XVI made a private pilgrimage to the shrine, his first as Pope, raising it to the status of a Basilica.  Shroud of Turin  Secondo Pia's negative of his 1898 photograph of the Shroud of Turin The Shroud of Turin (or Turin Shroud) is a linen cloth bearing the hidden image of a man who appears to have been physically traumatized in a manner consistent with crucifixion. The image is clearly visible as a photographic negative, as was first observed in 1898 on the reverse photographic plate when amateur photographer Secondo Pia was unexpectedly allowed to photograph it. The shroud is kept in the royal chapel of the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist in Turin, Italy. The Roman Catholic Church has approved this image in association with the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus and some believe it is the cloth that covered Jesus at burial. The shroud's linen has been carbon dated and showed a date originating in the late 13th or early 14th century CE. The shroud is thus a medieval hoax or forgery‚Äìor an icon created as such. It is the subject of intense debate among some scientists, believers, historians, and writers regarding where, when, and how the shroud and its images were created. Virgin of Guadalupe This full length image of the Virgin is said to have miraculously been created at the unusually late date of 1531 (for the Western church) in Mexico, where it continues to enjoy an enormous reputation. thumbnail In 1929 and 1951 photographers found a figure reflected in the Virgin's eyes; upon inspection they said that the reflection was tripled in what is called the Purkinje effect, commonly found in human eyes.[77] An ophthalmologist, Dr. Jose Aste Tonsmann, later enlarged an image of the Virgin's eyes by 2500x and claimed to have found not only the aforementioned single figure, but images of all the witnesses present when the tilma was first revealed before Zum√°rraga in 1531, plus a small family group of mother, father, and a group of children, in the center of the Virgin's eyes, fourteen people in all. In 1979 Philip Callahan, (biophysicist, USDA entomologist, NASA consultant) specializing in infrared imaging, was allowed direct access to visually inspect and photograph the image. He took numerous infrared photographs of the front of the tilma. Taking notes that were later published, his assistant noted that the original art work was neither cracked nor flaked, while later additions (gold leaf, silver plating the Moon) showed serious signs of wear, if not complete deterioration. Callahan could not explain the excellent state of preservation of the un- retouched areas of the image on the tilma, particularly the upper two-thirds of the image. His findings, with photographs, were published in 1981. Lord of Miracles of Buga This is a tridimensional image of Jesus Christ crucified that comes from the 16th century, and it is attributed to a miraculous event occurred to an Amerindian woman of this South American Andean region, who worked washing clothes for wealthy families of the city of Buga. thumbnail On October 5, 2006, a team of specialists, using four different complementary technologies: X rays, ultraviolet rays, pigment and stratigraphic analysis of the image, certified its incredibly well preserved condition. Official celebration in the religious Catholic calendar: September 14. Our Lady of The Pillar  thumbnail According to ancient Spanish tradition in the early days of Christianity, James the Great, one of the original Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ, was preaching the Gospel in what was then the pagan land of Caesaraugusta (now Zaragoza), in the Roman province of Hispania. He was disheartened with his mission, having made only a few converts. While he was praying by the banks of the Ebro River with some of his disciples, Mary miraculously appeared before him atop a pillar accompanied by angels. Mary assured James that the people would eventually be converted and their faith would be as strong as the pillar she was standing on. She gave him the pillar as a symbol and a wooden image of herself. James was also instructed to build a chapel on the spot where she left the pillar. It is generally believed that Mary would have appeared to James through bilocation, as she was still living either in Ephesus or Jerusalem at the time of this event. She is believed to have died three to fifteen years after Jesus' death. After establishing the church, James returned to Jerusalem with some of his disciples where he became a martyr, beheaded in 44 AD under Herod Agrippa. His disciples allegedly returned his body to Spain.

It is a rare disease in which the outer part of the shafts of long bones is thinner than normal and there is an increased chance of fractures. Its hallmark feature is an abnormality of the long bones in the arms and legs in which the ends (metaphyses) of the bones are abnormally broad; the shape of the bones resembles a boat oar or paddle. The broad metaphyses are due to enlargement of the spongy inner layer of bone (trabecular bone). Although trabecular bone is expanded, the dense outermost layer of bone (cortical bone) is thinner than normal. As a result, the bones are fragile and fracture easily. The bone abnormalities in the legs commonly cause knock knees (genu valgum) in affected individuals. Other bone abnormalities can also occur in Pyle disease. Affected individuals may have widened collar bones (clavicles), ribs, or bones in the fingers and hands. Dental problems are common in Pyle disease, including delayed appearance (eruption) of permanent teeth and misalignment of the top and bottom teeth (malocclusion). Signs and symptoms It is an autosomal recessive disorder in which mild clinical manifestations contrast with radiological appearances of gross metaphyseal undermodeling. Most patients present with mild genu valgum. The elbows are unable to extend fully. There may be widening of the lower femora and clavicles. Bones can sometimes be fragile, but fracturing is usually not common. Patients may present with dental caries, mandibular prognathism, spinal alignment, and disproportionate limb lengthening. Mental development, physical development, and height are usually normal.Syndrome of the month. Journal of Medical Genetics, 1987, 24, 321-322 Most patients with Pyle's diseases will have symptoms that vary from person to person. Symptoms are: 5%‚Äì29% of people have * Delated eruption of teeth Other people may have * Abnormality of thorax * Absent paranasal sinuses * Arthralgia * Carious teeth * Genu valgum * Hypoplastic frontal sinuses * Limited elbow extension * Mandibular prognathia * Metaphyseal widening * Metaphyseal dysplasia * Muscle weakness * Platyspondyly * Reduced bone mineral density * Scoliosis * Thickened calvaria Cause Pyle disease is caused by mutations in the SFRP4 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that blocks (inhibits) a process called Wnt signaling, which is involved in the development of several tissues and organs throughout the body. In particular, regulation of Wnt signaling by the SFRP4 protein is critical for normal bone development and remodeling. Bone remodeling is a normal process in which old bone is broken down and new bone is created to replace it. Mutations in the SFRP4 gene are thought to prevent the production of functional SFRP4 protein. The resulting dysregulation of Wnt signaling leads to the bone abnormalities characteristic of Pyle disease. Pyle disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the SFRP4 gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene. While they do not develop the condition, they may have mild abnormalities of the long bones. Diagnosis There are two clinical molecular genetic test that are available to those thought to have Pyle‚Äôs Disease. Theses test are; Sequence analysis of the entire coding region and Deletion/duplication analysis.  Differential diagnosis  Pyle disease may be confused with craniometaphyseal dysplasia. The two, however, are clinically, radiographically, and genetically distinct from one another.  Treatment  People with Pyle disease are often asymptomatic. Dental anomalies may require orthodontic interventions. Skeletal anomalies may require orthopedic surgery.Syndrome of the month. Journal of Medical Genetics, 1987, 24, 323-324. Epidemiology Pyle disease is thought to be a rare disorder, although its prevalence is unknown. More than 25 cases have been described in the medical literature. It has been described in four German families originating from the same town in Bohemia and in a 7-year-old Japanese girl. Research Cortical- bone fragility is a common feature in osteoporosis that is linked to nonvertebral fractures. Regulation of cortical-bone homeostasis has proved elusive. The study of genetic disorders of the skeleton can yield insights that fuel experimental therapeutic approaches to the treatment of rare disorders and common skeletal ailments. The study showed that Pyle‚Äôs disease was caused by a deficiency of sFRP4, that cortical-bone and trabecular-bone homeostasis were governed by different mechanisms, and that sFRP4-mediated cross-regulation between Wnt and BMP signaling was critical for achieving proper cortical-bone thickness and stability. Recently, homozygous mutations in secreted frizzled-related protein 4 gene (SFRP4) gene were found to underlie this condition. Sequencing of coding regions of SFRP4 gene from an 11-year-old female with PYL was performed. A novel homozygous nonsense variant, c.183C>G (p.Y61*) was observed. Segregation analysis in the patient revealed a germline mutation, resulting in reduced protein formation.

Although originally developed for mainframe computers, Shared Variables were also used in personal computer implementations of APL. Shared Variables could be used to control peripheral devices, or to communicate with external files, database management systems, or other users. Shared Variables were first introduced by International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) in their APL.SV software product in 1973, and are still available , in APLs from IBM and Dyalog, for the operating systems Linux and Windows. Origin When APL\\\\360 was first introduced in 1968, there were no built-in means by which a user could directly access data from outside of the APL system. Thus, starting in 1969, IBM developed the shared variable facility. Following APL.SV, the IBM VS APL and APL2 program products also supported shared variables, as did the IBM 5100 line of computers. Shared Variable Processors were available to allow APL access to the following: * Standard operating system files (TSIO) * Time Sharing Option (TSO) and Conversational Monitor System (CMS) command processors (AP100) * VSAPL Stack Processor (AP101) * VSAPL Session Manager (AP102) * CMS Native Files (AP110) * CMS and TSO Native Files (AP111) * APL2 Data File Processor (AP121) * Virtual storage access method (VSAM) Files (AP123) * Full Screen Display Manager (AP124) * IBM Graphical Data Display Manager (GDDM) (AP126) * IBM DB2 (AP127) Subsequent uses In the early 1980s, I. P. Sharp Associates, which offered a rich and advanced APL, introduced Shared Variables in their product. Many of the Shared Variable Processors available for IBM products were also written for Sharp APL, notably TSIO (called PJAM), AP124, AP126, and AP127. Further, as I. P. Sharp also offered IPSANET which allowed in-house clients of SHARP APL to be connected to the network, a Network Shared Variable Processor (NSVP) allowed programs from one mainframe site to access another. NSVP predates the widespread use of the Internet by five years. Shared Variables were one technique used by APL implementors and vendors to increase the richness of the APL language, doing so without changing the core implementation. With the advent of more powerful personal computing, the exodus of the APL user community to smaller computers was inevitable. APL was first available on Intel 8008, 8080, and Zilog Z80 based hardware, later the original IBM PC, and as of 2015, on the 32- and 64-bit Linux and Windows workstations. Although Dyalog APL included an implementation of shared variables for communication with the now-deprecated Microsoft Windows Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), only IBM continued to use Shared Variables as a means to supply new features to their versions of the APL2 language for non-mainframe computers. Nearly all other APL vendors chose to implement new functions, such as access to Linux and Windows native features, graphical user interfaces, presentation graphics, database management system interfaces, and so on, more directly in their respective versions of the APL language. In modern non-IBM APL implementations, the Shared Variable interface has been largely supplanted by Component Object Model (COM), ActiveX, and .NET Framework.

He played Gaelic football with his local club Austin Stack's and was a member of the Kerry senior inter-county team from 1973 until 1988. Power captained Kerry to the All-Ireland title in 1980. Early life Ger Power was born in Annacotty, County Limerick in 1952. He was little over a week old when his father, Jackie Power, who worked for CI√â, was transferred to Tralee in County Kerry. Jackie was a great hurler with Limerick in the 1930s and 1940s, winning three All- Ireland medals in 1934, 1936 and 1940. He later played hurling with Kerry and was a huge influence on his son‚Äôs sporting career. Ger Power began his inter- county career with the Kerry under-16 hurling team, however, he soon realised that football was the most important sport to Kerry people. Playing career Club Power played his club football with the famed Austin Stacks in Tralee. He showed exceptional talent from a young age and played a key role when the club won an under-16 county championship. Power subsequently won seven Kerry SFC titles with the club throughout the 1970s and 1980s. One of these county titles was converted into an All-Ireland title in 1977. He also played hurling with the club and won a Minor County Championship in 1967. Inter-county Power played with Kerry's minor football team for two years and was captain of the side when they lost to Galway in the 1970 All-Ireland final. Power was a substitute on the Kerry senior team that lost in a replay to Offaly in the All-Ireland final of 1972. He played with the under-21 side for three years, winning an All-Ireland medal in 1973. Two years later in 1975 Power had a very successful year with the Kerry senior team. He captured his very first Munster Championship and All-Ireland medals at senior level, under the new management of the legendary Mick O'Dwyer. It was the beginning of a glorious era for Kerry football and Power played a key role in orchestrating much of the success. In 1976 Power won his second Munster title; however, Dublin gained revenge for the previous year by defeating Kerry in the All- Ireland final. 1977 was another frustrating year as Kerry won another Munster title but lost out to Dublin yet again, this time in a thrilling All-Ireland semi-final. By 1978 Kerry were ready for success. They easily won another Munster title and breezed into the All-Ireland final to face Dublin. The game itself is remembered for Mikey Sheehy's cheeky goal which he scored by lobbing the ball over the head of Paddy Cullen. The final score was 5‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì9 and Power had secured a second All-Ireland medal. In 1979, Kerry once again faced up to Dublin in the All-Ireland final; however, Power missed the game because of a hamstring injury. In spite of this he was playing the best football of his career and scored a massive 2‚Äì6 against Cork in the Munster final. Victories for Kerry over Roscommon and Offaly in the respective All-Ireland finals of 1980 and 1981 brought Power's All-Ireland medal tally up to five. In 1980, he was captain of the side; however, he had to retire early from the game due to injury. In 1982, he collected his eighth consecutive Munster Championship medal and the scene was set for Kerry to become the first team in the history of the game to win five consecutive All-Ireland football titles. Once again, Power's side faced Offaly in the All-Ireland final. Kerry had the upper hand for much of the game and were leading by two points with two minutes left to be played. The game, however, was not over as Offaly substitute S√©amus Darby, who had entered the game almost unnoticed, produced possibly the greatest match-winner of all-time when he scored a late goal. Kerry failed to score again to level the match and Offaly went on to win their third All-Ireland title ever. In 1983, Kerry were denied a record-breaking ninth consecutive Munster title by Cork. Power's side were down but not out, as they reclaimed the provincial title the following year, before securing back-to-back All-Ireland victories over their old rivals Dublin in 1984 and 1985. In 1986, Power collected his third consecutive All-Ireland title with an 8-point victory over Tyrone. It was his seventh All-Ireland medal overall. In all Power collected eleven Munster Championship medals. He played in nine All- Ireland finals, ending up on the winning side on eight occasions. Power also enjoyed playing Railway Cup football with Munster, winning inter-provincial titles in 1975,1976, 1977, 1978, 1981 and 1982. His honours also include four National Football Leagues in 1974, 1977, 1982 and 1984 and six All Stars Awards, winning All Stars at three different positions: half-back, half- forward and corner-forward. Post career After retiring Power became trainer of the Limerick senior team during the 90s. He was also part of the back-team with Austin Stacks. He has also trained the Kerry senior hurling team with John O'Keeffe.

Early life Before finding fame, Kingdom worked as an explosives expert, lumberjack, farmhand, quarryman, poacher and for over 50 years the gravedigger for his local parish. Media career Following a head injury sustained while driving a tractor in his job as a lumberjack, Kingdom spent some time convalescing and developed depression. To aid in his recovery, a friend lent him a video camera and suggested he film wildlife on Exmoor. This led to a career spanning 20 years, with series and documentaries being shown on a number of British television channels. His 2006 series Johnny Kingdom: A Year on Exmoor was shown on BBC Two. The series coincided with the publication of his autobiography, Johnny Kingdom - A Wild Life on Exmoor. A follow-up series, Johnny's New Kingdom, documenting his project to create a wildlife haven on a plot of land which he had purchased on Exmoor, was shown on BBC Two in 2008. Kingdom has also made several one-off programmes, including visits to Lapland and to the Scottish Highlands. In 2015 he presented a four-part series for ITV called Johnny Kingdom's Wild Exmoor. In later years he regularly had a stall at Barnstaple Pannier Market from which he sold signed copies of his books, DVDs and photographs of wildlife. Death Kingdom died in September 2018 from injuries sustained in a digger accident on his land near Knowstone in North Devon.

It was created as a competitor to the successful Futura typeface for Monotype's hot metal typesetting system. Like Futura it has a single-story '…ë' and a straight 'j' with no bend. A very large font family, Twentieth Century is particularly known for a limited range of styles being bundled with many Microsoft products such as Office. Numerous other variants exist, including versions for very small text and an Art Deco- influenced titling capitals design, Twentieth Century Poster, with rounded capitals. In addition, Twentieth Century served as an inspiration for Century Gothic, designed by Monotype in 1991. Casting history The various weights and widths were cut over a period of ten years: * Twentieth Century (1937) * Twentieth Century Bold Italic (1937) * Twentieth Century Extrabold Italic (1937) * Twentieth Century Extrabold Condensed Italic (1938) * Twentieth Century Ultrabold (1941) * Twentieth Century Ultrabold Condensed (1944) * Twentieth Century Medium Condensed Italic (1947) * Twentieth Century Ultrabold Italic (1947) Foundry type copies The first American knock-off of Futura was Baltimore Type Foundry‚Äôs Airport. No information exists on how this was produced, but it resembles Futura so closely, that it is thought to be electrotyped. After Monotype introduced Twentieth Century, Baltotype began selling some weights of this face under the Airport name. Digital type copies There presently exist two modern releases, by Monotype and Lanston Type (LTC). Monotype‚Äôs current release is much larger than that included with Microsoft products, and includes additional light, semi-bold, extra- and ultra-bold styles. Even less commonly seen are the quirky Art Deco-influenced display alphabet Twentieth Century Poster, intended to be complementary, and Twentieth Century Classified, a small print design with a very high x-height. This veers away from the strict geometry of the main design, featuring a more conventional double-story ‚Äòa‚Äô, presumably to be more legible. A similar design was offered by Linotype‚Äôs Spartan, which may be an influence. Lanston's design is in a narrower range of styles, but includes a set of additional stylistic alternates and small capitals. LTC has also digitised other Hess sans-serif designs, such as Jefferson Gothic (a titling caps design similar to Twentieth Century Poster, but more condensed) and Tourist Gothic (an earlier grotesque design, to which Hess also added rounded caps). Twentieth Century Poster has also been revived under the name as Renard Moderne by the company Nick's Fonts, a release that includes small capitals as a lower case. Digitisations of the original design are sometimes marketed as Tw Cen MT, possibly due to archaic file name length restrictions.

The common name of the amber snails is based on the shell, which is translucent and when empty usually resembles the color of amber. This species is endemic to the United States, specifically the state of Arizona and Utah, where it was first collected in the early 20th century. It has been listed as endangered on the United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species since 1991. In January 2020, the Trump Administration announced it plans to remove the Kanab ambersnail from the endangered species list. This snail lives in wetlands, springs, and seeps, and only two of its natural habitats are known to exist: Three Lakes, a meadow near Kanab, Utah, and Vasey's Paradise, a springs along the Colorado River within Grand Canyon National Park. In its natural habitat it is rather polyphagous, feeding mainly on bacteria, plants and fungi. It reproduces during the summer. Now considered a critically endangered species on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species due to a series of factors (including anthropic influence), the Kanab ambersnail has been reintroduced to three springs above the historic high water level along the Colorado River. Taxonomy U.S. dime (18 mm / 0.7 in diameter). Specimens of the Kanab ambersnail were first collected in 1909 by James Ferriss from: \\"The Greens\\", above Kanab, Utah on Kanab Wash, on a wet ledge among moss and Cypripediums. These specimens were originally thought to belong to the species Succinea hawkinsi. Pilsbry (1948) transferred these specimens to the genus Oxyloma and erected the subspecies kanabensis in the species haydeni for them. Arthur Clarke (1991) notes that Pilsbry‚Äôs decision to accord the Kanab ambersnail subspecific status was preliminary, and that, as Pilsbry himself noted, ‚Äúits taxonomic status should be reevaluated.‚Äù Clarke (1991)Clarke, A.H. 1991. Status survey of selected land and freshwater gastropods in Utah. Unpublished report prepared for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Denver, Colorado. 70 pp + cxii. and Shei K. Wu (Colorado Museum of Natural History, Boulder, Colorado, pers. comm. 1992, 1995) suggest that the Kanab ambersnail may deserve full species status. Earle Spamer (Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, pers. comm. 1994) stated that although current published mollusk checklists (Turgeon et al. 1988 and Groombridge 1993) treat the Kanab ambersnail at species level rather that as a subspecies, nonetheless, until the criteria are derived (and published) by which the taxon can be known to be a separate species, it should continue to be called by its original name, the one published by Pilsbry (1948): Oxyloma haydeni spp. kanabensis. Despite this, NatureServe does list this taxon as a species. Description The Kanab ambersnail is a terrestrial snail in the family Succineidae. The empty shell is a light amber color. The live snail has a mottled grayish-amber to yellowish-amber colored shell. The shell is dextral (right-handed spiral), thin-walled, with an elevated spire and a Daly, patulous (expanded) aperture. Fully mature individuals are about 14 to 19 mm (0.5 to 0.75 inch) long, 7 to 9 mm (0.25 to 0.33 inch) in diameter, with 3.25 to 3.75 whorls in a drawn out spire. Its eyes are borne at the ends of long peduncles (stalks), while the tentacles are reduced to small protuberances at the base of the eye stalks. Ecology The natural predators of this snail are passerines, such as the (American robin), and deer mice.Stevens, L.E., V.J. Meretsky, D.M. Kubly, J.C. Nagy, C. Nelson, J.R. Petterson, F.R. Protiva, and J.A. Sorensen. 1997b. The impacts of an experimental flood from Glen Canyon Dam on the endangered Kanab Ambersnail at Vaseys Paradise, Grand Canyon, Arizona: Final Report. Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center, Flagstaff. Vasey's Paradise, one of the two natural habitats of the Kanab ambersnail. Habitat In 1996, 16% of the ambersnail's habitat at Vasey's Paradise was destroyed in a flood, and a more disastrous previous flood in 1994 had probably already threatened the snail's habitat. The suitable area for habitat in Three Lakes is believed to extend to an area 1.3 km long, and 90 m wide, and genetic diversity seems to indicate that the area is more stable than Vasey's Paradise. However their redistribution is also affected by the presence of their host plants and rock ledges. Three Lakes, a privately owned wet meadow near Kanab, is one of only two natural habitats for the Kanab ambersnail. The snail's habitat is threatened by commercial development by the owner of Three Lakes. Despite being air-breathing molluscs, they can survive for up to 32 hours in cold, highly oxygenated water, which may have helped to disperse its population around the Colorado Valley area since a controlled release was conducted in 1998. Feeding habits The Kanab ambersnail is typically found on host plants, primarily the scarlet monkeyflower (Erythranthe cardinalis) and watercress (Nasturtium officinale), but also sedges and rushes. It feeds on plant tissue, fungi, algae, and bacteria, using its radula to scrape off food. Life cycle Like all pulmonate land snails, ambersnails are hermaphroditic, having both male and female reproductive systems, and are believed to be capable of self-fertilization. In the wild they live for between 12 and 15 months. Young snails enter dormancy between October and November, becoming active again in March and April. Mature snails reproduce in the summer months. Population Only two wild populations of the snail are known to exist, specifically, Three Lakes near Kanab, Utah and Vasey's Paradise.Miller, Mark P.; Stevens, Larry P.; Busch, Joseph D.; Sorensen, Jeff A.; Keim, Paul. Amplified fragment length polymorphism and mitochondrial sequence data detect genetic differentiation in endangered southwestern U.S.A. ambersnails (Oxyloma epp.) The latter was not discovered until 1991 when a survey of mollusks in the area was conducted. There was formerly a third population present in Kanab, Utah, but it is believed to have become extirpated through the destruction of its habitat.Clarke, A.H. 1991. Status survey of selected land and freshwater gastropods in Utah. Conservation In November 1991, Kanab ambersnail was proposed for emergency listing by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.Proposal to list the Kanab Ambersnail as Endangered and Designate Critical Habitat, (Nov. 15, 1991). The Kanab ambersnail had been included United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered mammals and birds since April 1992.Final rule to list the Kanab ambersnail as endangered, (April 17, 1992). The Kanab ambersnail is evaluated as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Reintroduction releases have been conducted at three sites along the Colorado river, each releasing 150 snails. The first of these releases was conducted in September 1998, and all sites were sufficiently high enough to not be flooded by normal dam activity. A second release was conducted at the same three sites in July 1999 to boost population densities and improve genetic variability, but only one of the three sites, Upper Elves Chasm, has established a new population. In Utah, its habitat was threatened by commercial development,Randall Fitzgerald, Mugged by the State: Outrageous Government Assaults on Ordinary People and their Property, Regnery Publishing, Inc. (2003) whereas the Grand Canyon population is threatened by discharges from the Glen Canyon Dam which can sweep the snail and its habitat downstream. Delisting In 2013, a scientific investigations report by the United States Geological Survey concluded that the Kanab ambersnail is not a genetically distinct species. In January 2020, the Fish and Wildlife Service published a proposed rule removing the Kanab ambersnail from the Federal List of Endangered Species due to \\"taxonomic error\\".Proposed Rule: Removing the Kanab Ambersnail From the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife, (Jan. 6, 2020).

It is considered to be a lethal disease, and usually leads to death within a few hours of birth. However, a recent report describes two studies in which children with Raine Syndrome have lived to 8 and 11 years old, so it is currently proposed that there is a milder expression that the phenotype can take (Simpson 2009). Genetics Raine Syndrome appears to be an autosomal recessive disease. There are reports of recurrence in children born of the same parents, and an increased occurrence in children of closely related, genetically similar parents. Individuals with Raine Syndrome were either homozygous or compound heterozygous for the mutation of FAM20C. Also observed have been nonsynonomous mutation and splice-site changes (Simpson et al. 2007). FAM20C, located on chromosome 7p22.3, is an important molecule in bone development. Studies in mice have demonstrated its importance in the mineralization of bones in teeth in early development (OMIM, Simpson et al. 2007, Wang et al. 2010). FAM20C stands for ‚Äúfamily with sequence similarity 20, member C.‚Äù It is also commonly referred to as DMP-4. It is a Golgi- enriched fraction casein kinase and an extracellular serine/threonine protein kinase. It is 107,743 bases long, with 10 exons and 584 amino acids (Weizmann Institute of Science). Research Current research describes Raine Syndrome as a neonatal osteosclerotic bone dysplasia, indicated by its osteosclerotic symptoms that are seen in those suffering from the disease. It has been found that a mutation in the gene FAM20C is the cause of the Raine Syndrome phenotype. This microdeletion mutation leads to an unusual chromosome 7 arrangement. The milder phenotypes of Raine Syndrome, such as those described in Simpson‚Äôs 2007 report, suggest that Raine Syndrome resulting from missense mutations may not be as lethal as the other described mutations (OMIM). This is supported by findings from Fradin et al. (2011), who reported on children with missense mutations to FAM20C and lived to ages 1 and 4 years, relatively much longer than the life spans of the previously reported children. Simpson et al.‚Äôs (2007) report states that to date, effected individuals have had chromosome 7 uniparental isodisomy and a 7p telomeric microdeletion. They had abnormal chromosome 7 arrangements, with microdeletions of their D7S2477 and D7S1484 markers (Simpson 2007). History It was first characterized in 1989 in a report that was published on an infant that had been born with an unknown syndrome, that later came to be called Raine Syndrome.

He became famous through his long fundraising walks in the African Great Lakes region and overseas. He started his campaign after learning how drastically Black Rhinos had decreased in Africa. Wherever he walked, his arrival was greeted with much public fanfare and media attention. This helped to raise funds for conservation of Rhinos and other endangered African mammals.  Activism  Werikhe's first walk began on December 27, 1982. His walk from his hometown of Mombasa to Nairobi lasted 27 days. In March 1985 he started his first international walk from Kampala to Dar es Salaam, and eventually Mombasa, where he arrived on May 25. Three years later in 1988, Werikhe walked through several countries in Europe, including Italy, Switzerland and West Germany. His 3000 kilometres walk finished at the entrance stairs of the Natural History Museum in London on September 14, 1988. Werikhe also visited the United States in 1991, where he held a walk finishing at the San Diego Zoo. He held two \\"Rhino walks\\" in 1993 in Taiwan, a notorious consumer nation of rhino horns. Although Werikhe typically walked alone, he often had co-walkers and guides with him. His campaign was supported by Nehemiah Rotich (then chief of the East African Wildlife Society (EAWLS)), Richard Leakey, Juanita Carberry, Prince Philip and Prince Bernhard, among others.  Private life  Michael Sampson Werikhe was born 25 May 1956 in Mombasa, the son of Emanuel Werikhe. He spent his early life in Nairobi with his half-siblings Mary, Susan and David. Under the kind nurturing and guiding influence of Emanual Werikhe's British-born second wife, Sheila Margaret Werikhe (n√©e Lewis), his lifelong interest in conservation issues began. By the age of 11 Werikhe had an extensive collection of rescued snakes, reptiles and chameleons living in pens at the family's two-bedroom flat in The Westlands residential area of Nairobi. He began his education at Hospital Hill Primary School (in the Parklands district of Nairobi), where his interest in reptiles, even at that age, saw the introduction of pet snakes into the school, as well as ensuring that several of his school friends were taught how to 'foster' some of his reptiles in their old-fashioned school desks (more than one snake was known to have popped its head up through the inkwell-hole during class!!). He went to secondary school at St. Georges High school, Giriama a catholic sponsored school in Mwabaya Nyundo Kaloleni. Between 1972-1975 Werikhe worked at Fort Jesus, Mombasa. He cataloged the large store of illegally poached elephant ivory and rhinoceros horn. Witnessing the tonnes of poached ivory and rhino horns led Werikhe to begin his fund raising. Werikhe believed that conservation solutions would only work with the active participation of local residents. Kenyans had always lived alongside wildlife, while the concept of killing animals for sport or poaching for profit were driven by influences beyond Kenya's borders. During the fund raising walk across the African Great Lakes region, Werikhe never carried money but relied on the goodwill of the ordinary Kenyans living in the bush to feed and shelter him. The rural population were Werikhe's initial target group. Rural people aware of what was happening within their local area provided the first line of defence against poachers. Werikhe died on 9 August 1999 after sustaining injuries in an assault near his home when leaving for work. He was a widower at the time of his death and left two daughters (Acacia and Kora). He was buried at Emmanuel Cemetery, Kisauni, Mombasa . The Michael Werikhe Trust was founded in his memory. In addition, the EAWLS donates an annual Michael Werikhe Award.

History Kfar Shmaryahu was founded in May 1937, during the Fifth Aliyah. The founding members were German-Jewish immigrants, who named the village after Shmaryahu Levin (1867‚Äì1935), a Russian-born Jewish Zionist leader. The village was founded as an agricultural community, with forty farms, thirty auxiliary farms, and twenty lots for housing projects. A well was drilled, and a synagogue that became the center of community life was also built. In late 1938, 60 families were living there, and the predominant language was German. Throughout the following years the town absorbed new immigrants. In 1950 it was declared a local council and was granted additional land.http://www.welcomehome.co.il/en/kfar-shmaryahu-3/ File:A LINE OF HOUSES AT KFAR SHMARYAHU. ◊ë◊™◊ô◊ù ◊ë◊õ◊§◊® ◊©◊û◊®◊ô◊î◊ï.D393-137.jpg|Kfar Shmaryahu in December 1937 File:◊õ◊§◊® ◊©◊û◊®◊ô◊î◊ï - ◊ë◊®◊ô◊õ◊î ◊ï◊û◊í◊ì◊ú ◊û◊ô◊ù.-JNF045614.jpeg|Kfar Shmaryahu water tower 1940 File:El -Haram cropped.jpg|Kfar Shmaryahu 1942 1:20,000 File:Herzliya 1945.jpg|Kfar Shmaryhu 1945 1:250,000 Status Kfar Shmaryahu is an affluent suburb of Tel Aviv.

He previously played for the Pittsburgh Steelers, New York Giants, and the Philadelphia Eagles.  High school career  A native of Americus, Georgia, Jackson attended Americus High School, where he was a standout defensive lineman. As a senior, he recorded 116 tackles, 16 sacks, and three blocked kicks, and was a first-team Class 2A all-state selection. Recruiting analyst Tom Lemming rated Jackson as the No. 110 player in the Southeast. He chose Florida State over Georgia and Florida.  College career  In his true freshman season with Seminoles, Jackson played in all 12 games and was credited with 13 total tackles, three solo tackles and one pass break- up. In the National Championship game, the Sugar Bowl vs. Virginia Tech, Jackson contributed one solo tackle on special teams. As a sophomore, Jackson played in all 12 games (including four starts), serving primarily as back-up to senior David Warren at defensive end. He finished with 37 tackles (including 16 unassisted) on the season, and ranked fourth on the team with 5.0 quarterback sacks, behind Jamal Reynolds (12.0), David Warren (9.0), and Darnell Dockett (7.0). Jackson's season-best game came against Virginia, when he recorded six tackles, two tackles for loss, and one sack. After Warren's graduation, Jackson took over the left defensive end spot, starting ten games. He missed the Miami (FL) and Virginia games with a sprained knee. Jackson led the team with five quarterback sacks and ranked second with 16 hurries. He also had eight tackles for loss, which tied Travis Johnson for second on the team, behind Darnell Dockett who posted a school-record 22 TFLs. Jackson finished the season with 33 total tackles (19 solo) and named honorable mention All-ACC. He had five tackles and two tackles for loss in the Gator Bowl against Virginia Tech. In his senior year, Jackson started all 14 games of the season, and registered team-highs in tackles for loss (18.5), sacks (13.0), and quarterback hurries (19). He also had 42 tackles (34 unassisted, sixth on the team), and forced four fumbles (team-high). Against Iowa State, he caught his only interception of the season, and returned it for 48 yards into the endzone.  Professional career  Due to disappointing performances of Andre Wadsworth and Jamal Reynolds, the potential of ‚Äúundersized Seminole ends‚Äù like Jackson was met with scepticism.http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/2003/draft/players/6774.html The Pittsburgh Steelers drafted him in the second round of the 2003 NFL Draft and he made the transition from defensive end to left outside linebacker in the 3‚Äì4 defense, projected as a long-term replacement for veteran Jason Gildon. He performed well during the preseason in both of his years with the Steelers, but only saw playing time on special teams. He was cut prior to the 2005 season, and later signed with the New York Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles.

The hotel served the needs of air defense during the Second World War, when members of the Finnish women's paramilitary organization Lotta Sv√§rd kept watch for enemy bombers. Immediately after the cessation of the war, Hotelli Torni served as the headquarters of the Allied Control Commission monitoring Finnish compliance with the obligations of the Moscow Armistice.

Early life Creswell was born on 13 September 1879 in London. He was educated at Westminster School before going on to study electrical engineering at Finsbury City and Guilds Technical College in 1896. During this time he developed his considerable skills in draughtsmanship. He worked for Siemens Brothers and then, from 1914, the Deutsche Bank in London. Creswell was interested in eastern buildings and places from childhood. By 1910 he had become so drawn to Islamic architecture that he started collecting a library that was eventually to become one of the most comprehensive private collections of its kind. As well as working at his engineering day job, he spent time studying eastern architecture. He published an article in The Burlington Magazine in 1913, and soon after gave a paper to the Royal Asiatic Society, which was well received. Both concerned domes in Persian architecture. His interest in Islamic architecture spurred him to look for more satisfying employment, and in May 1914 he applied, unsuccessfully, to join the Archaeological Survey of India. The First World War broke out in August of that year, and in April 1916 he was selected on probation for appointment as Assistant Equipment Officer in the Royal Flying Corps. Some time afterwards he was posted to Egypt. He rose through the ranks, and by July 1919 had been appointed (as an Army Captain) as Inspector of Monuments under General Allenby's Occupied Enemy Territory Administration in Palestine and Syria. He travelled extensively, making measured drawings and notes as well as recording the monuments photographically, producing nearly a thousand photographs.http://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/990142175150203941/catalog He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 1919 New Year Honours. Early Muslim Architecture and The Muslim Architecture of Egypt In May 1920 Creswell drew up a proposal for a History of the Muslim Architecture of Egypt. He intended this to be an exhaustive study of the subject. As well as detailed descriptions of individual monuments, bolstered with plans, drawings and photographs, there were also to be chapters on the development of certain features, such as minarets, domes and madrasas. He submitted the proposal to King Fuad I of Egypt, who recognised the importance of such a work and was an enthusiastic patron. Creswell was granted 800 Egyptian pounds for three years to finance the work. Creswell hastily returned to England for demobilisation, and returned to Cairo on 13 October 1920. Aerial view of Ibn Tulun's mosque and the surrounding neighbourhood The work proved to be even more monumental than Creswell had anticipated. Archaeological excavations had significantly increased the number of known monuments, and no draughtsman was made available to him. He undertook all the work without assistance. Five volumes had been published by 1969, totalling 1,769 pages, with a sixth volume in preparation but unpublished on his death in 1974. This massive work was split into two: Early Muslim Architecture (Volume I published in 1932; Volume II published in 1940; Volume I second edition in 1969) and The Muslim Architecture of Egypt (Volume I published in 1952; Volume II published in 1959). Other works Creswell first started work on the Bibliography of the Architecture, Arts and Crafts of Islam in 1912; it was finally published in 1961. This drew together all the books, articles and periodical volumes that concerned this very wide field, and comprised the listing of some 12,300 books and nearly as many periodical volumes. A supplement appeared in 1973. As well as these huge undertakings, Creswell produced an additional sixty-odd articles and other writings. Teaching and other posts held; honours awarded Creswell was appointed a lecturer at Fuad University (now Cairo University) in Cairo in 1931, and within three years was made Professor of Islamic Art and Architecture. He held this post until 1951. In 1956 he was appointed a Distinguished Professor of Islamic Art and Architecture at the American University in Cairo. In 1939 he became a member of the Higher Council for the Conservation of Arab Monuments, holding this post for 12 years. He was keenly involved in the recording and preservation of the twelfth-century wall and gates of medieval Cairo. From 1949 until 1967 he was a Trustee of the Palestine Archaeological Museum in Jerusalem. Creswell was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1947, became a C.B.E. in 1955 and was knighted in 1970, at the age of ninety. Later years In 1956 the Suez Crisis ensured the unpopularity of the British in Egypt. The government advised Creswell to leave the country. On learning that his library could not be exported, Creswell resolved to stay. The American University in Cairo offered to house the books on his behalf, and Creswell accepted, albeit with some exceedingly strict strings attached: the students, for example, were not allowed to touch the books. In 1959 he was awarded the Triennial Gold Medal by the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland.https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/data/gb891-rastgm/rastgm/22 In June 1973, his health failing, Creswell returned to England. He died on 8 April 1974. He never married. Creswell bequeathed his library of 3,000-plus volumes to the American University in Cairo, along with his collection of some 11,000 photographic prints. The Ashmolean Museum in Oxford received the photographic negatives. More than 2,700 prints were sent to art historian Bernard Berenson, a friend of Creswell.

The scandal has been tied to several prominent figures in French politics. Bicesse Accords President Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos of Angola met with Jonas Savimbi of UNITA in Bicesse/Portugal and signed the Bicesse Accords, a peace agreement that attempted unsuccessfully to end the Angolan Civil War, on May 31, 1991, with the mediation of the Portuguese government. The accords laid out a transition to multi-party democracy under the supervision of the United Nations' UNAVEM II mission with a presidential election in a year. The accords attempted to demobilize the 152,000 active fighters and integrate the remaining government troops and UNITA rebels into a 50,000-strong Angolan Armed Forces (FAA). The FAA would consist of a national army with 40,000 troops, navy with 6,000, and air force with 4,000. While UNITA largely did not disarm, the FAA complied with the accord and demobilized, leaving the government disadvantaged. At the same time, the Cuban troops that had helped MPLA forces to push back the South African army and UNITA rebels during the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale, completed their withdrawal from Angola. This meant that the MPLA would have an even greater disadvantage if fighting resumed (as they were aligned with the FAA). Angola held a presidential election in 1992. In the first round dos Santos officially received 49.57% of the vote and Savimbi won 40.6%. Savimbi said the election had neither been free nor fair and refused to participate in the second round. International observers, however, affirmed that the elections had been largely free and fair. Savimbi, along with eight opposition parties and many other election observers, said the election had been neither free nor fair. The MPLA massacred over ten thousand UNITA and FNLA voters nationwide in a few days in what was known as the Halloween Massacre. UNITA renewed its guerrilla war, capturing five of Angola's eighteen provincial capitals.(fr) or (es) Arms sales With the MPLA on the verge of defeat, dos Santos contacted Jean- Bernard Curial, the former French Socialist Party Southern Africa expert, and asked him to come to Luanda. When he came back, Curial, supportive of dos Santos, contacted members of the government, President's advisor for African Affairs, Bruno Delahe and Jean-Christophe Mitterrand, son of then-President Fran√ßois Mitterrand. Jean-Christophe referred Curial to Pierre Falcone, head of , a consortium of companies, and adviser to a parastatal run by the right- wing Interior Minister Charles Pasqua. Pasqua believed that in the early 1990s the U.S. government's support for UNITA had diminished while tacit support for the MPLA increased because peace would increase oil output. He argued that if Mitterrand's position on Angola did not change in kind, French oil companies would miss out on a vital opportunity. Jean-Christophe's lawyer says that Jean-Christophe Mitterrand first met Falcone after he stopped working as an expert on Africa for the √âlys√©e. Falcone and Jean-Christophe Mitterrand first met in July 1992 in Phoenix, Arizona, after he left his charges as President's advisor for African Affairs. At that time he was with his family, on holiday, in the United States, with a relation who was an employee of Thomson CSF, a French arms and electronics company. He introduced Jean-Christophe Mitterrand to his friend Pierre Falcone during a dinner at his home in Scottsdale in July 1992. At that time Jean-Christophe Mitterrand was free of government charges until May 1992, and had already signed a contract with a private French company (La Compagnie G√©n√©rale des Eaux). After the Angolan elections (see above), Curial met Falcone, who went to Angola for the first time and organised for the Angolan government a successful pre-paid operation in oil dealing. Later the Angolan government gave him an official mission to supervise supplying his army with arms from the East Central European country Slovakia and the population with food and medicine. The Angolan government bought USD $47 million worth of ammunition, mortar, and artillery from the Slovakian company ZTS-OZOS on November 7, 1993, which dos Santos received in December. In April 1994 the government bought $463 million worth of fighter aircraft and tanks. By late 1994 the Angolan government had purchased $633 million worth of weapons. Dos Santos secretly had El√≠sio de Figueiredo, the former ambassador of Angola to France, act as Angola's envoy to friendly contacts in France. Falcone worked with the Angolan government through Figueiredo. Scandal uncovered Jean-Charles Marchiani, Pasqua's subordinate, allegedly went to Luanda and signed an agreement with dos Santos on November 29, 1994, that promised to organise a better relationship with the French government where some ministers, Leotard (ministry for defense), and Alain Madelin (Minister for finances), were openly supporting Jonas Savimbi for many years. In exchange they seemed to receive Angolese political and financial agreement for Pasqua's party which was running for European elections. Afterwards, Jacques Chirac planned to run for president in the 1995 election. When Pasqua endorsed Edouard Balladur, Chirac's rival, Chirac's supporters told French Inland Revenue about Falcone's arms shipments, alleging income tax evasion. While there is agreement that no arms ever passed through France, French Inland Revenue investigated individuals connected with the scandal because agreements were allegedly signed in Paris. Allain Guilloux, Brenco International's fiscal lawyer in France, says the Angolan government agreed to Marchiani's deal in Luanda, not Paris. In 1996 the French Financial Brigades confiscated 50,000 documents from the offices of Falcone and Arcadi Gaydamak, a Russian‚ÄìIsraeli businessman and associate of Falcone. Arrest and trial French police arrested Falcone on December 1, 2000, on charges of tax fraud. Seven days later the French government issued a warrant for the arrest of Gaydamak. French police arrested Jean-Christophe Mitterrand on December 21 for his supposed role in the arms deal, but released him on January 11 when his mother paid his $725,000 bail. A judge found Mitterrand guilty in 2004 of tax fraud and gave him a suspended sentence of 30 months in prison. In April 2007, the investigative magistrate indicted 42 people, including Jean-Christophe Mitterrand, Jacques Attali, Charles Pasqua and Jean- Charles Marchiani, for having received illegal payments from Pierre Falcone. Arcadi Gaydamak and Falcone were also indicted. The writer Paul-Loup Sulitzer has also been indicted, charged of having received ‚Ç¨380,000 from Falcone, as well as the Union for a Popular Movement deputy Georges Fenech, charged of having received ‚Ç¨15,200 in 1997 from Brenco. The trial started in 2008, in absentia of Gaydamak who left for Israel. Sulitzer admitted taking ‚Ç¨300,000 in return for information in December 2008, testifying against Falcone. He accused prosecutors of \\"trying to kill a mosquito with a nuclear bomb.\\" Sentencing The sentences for the \\"Angolagate affair\\" were handed down on October 27, 2009. Charles Pasqua and Jean-Charles Marchiani were found guilty of taking money from Gaydamak and Falcone while knowing it was proceeds of crime. Pasqua was sentenced to three years in prison of which two suspended, and ‚Ç¨100,000 fine. Marchiani was sentenced to three months in prison. Gaydamak and Falcone were found guilty of illegal arms deals, tax fraud, money laundering, embezzlement and others, sentenced to six years in prison and multi-million-euro fines each. Gaydamak was sentenced in absentia, and it was unclear whether he would ever serve the prison term. Falcone, who tried and failed to claim diplomatic immunity in the case, was taken into custody by police when the judge finished reading out the sentences. Jean-Christophe Mitterrand was found guilty of receiving $2 million from Falcone and Gaydamak to promote their interests, and sentenced to a two-year suspended sentence and a ‚Ç¨375,000 fine. Paul-Loup Sulitzer was found guilty of embezzlement and sentenced to 15 months in prison and a ‚Ç¨100,000 fine. Jacques Attali and Georges Fenech were acquitted. In total, thirty six individuals were convicted of various levels of involvement in the scandal, 21 of them appealed the decision. Appeal decision The Paris Court of Appeal's decision was given on April 29, 2011 and its findings were quite different. The Paris Court of Appeal overturned the conviction of former Interior Minister Charles Pasqua as well as Jean-Charles Marchiani's. The charges against Pierre Falcone and Arcadi Gaydamak were also dropped. The Court of Appeal particularly recognized that they had acted under the authority of a \\"state mandate\\" issued by the Angolan government which was seeking to \\"ensure the survival\\" of the country and that it was \\"in that context and while the situation worsened\\" that it asked Pierre Falcone and Arcadi Gaydamak to acquire arms as well as food and medicine.

For a time, he worked on the estate, near Ardatov, giving drawing lessons and painting icons. Shortly after, he went to Italy, by way of Germany with Count Pavel Kutaisov, chairman of the Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts, and remained there until 1844.

Star-Spangled Manners: In Which Miss Manners Defends American Etiquette (For a Change). Both Canada and the United States have shared cultural and linguistic heritage originating in Europe, and as such some points of traditional European etiquette apply to both, especially in more formal settings; however, each have formed their own etiquette as well. Among the most prominent writers on American etiquette are Meloise, Letitia Baldrige, Judith Martin, Emily Post, Elizabeth Post, Peggy Post, Mary Monica Mitchell, Gertrude Pringle, and Amy Vanderbilt. Principles Judith Martin states that if one wishes to become an accepted member of any society or group, one \\"had better learn to practice its etiquette\\". Early North American etiquette books claimed that the manners and customs of the \\"Best Society\\" could be imitated by all,Post, Emily. Etiquette. 1922 edition. Chapter 1. \\"What is Best Society?\\" http://www.bartleby.com/95/1.html although some authors lamented that the lower classes, meaning those \\"whose experience in life has been a hardening process\\", in fact treated the rules of etiquette with \\"contempt and ... a sneer\\".Morton, Agnes H.

This change is reflected in the content of etiquette books; etiquette books published in the early 20th century contained detailed advice on the treatment of servants, the conducting of formal dinner parties, and the behavior of a debutante;Post, Emily. Etiquette. 1922 edition. http://www.bartleby.com/95/ more modern books are likely to emphasize the importance of respecting people of all classes, races, and ethnic backgrounds.Post, Peggy. Etiquette. 17th edition. Chapter 1. Some books make a further distinction between etiquette and manners: > Etiquette is protocol, rules of behavior that you memorize and that rarely > bend to encompass individual concerns and needs. Manners embrace socially > acceptable behavior, of course, but also much more than that. They are an > expression of how you treat others when you care about them, their self- > esteem, and their feelings.Baldridge, Letitia.

Page 4. > https://books.google.com/books?id=3Gpe- > MDs3MQC&pg;=PP1&dq;=Letitia+Baldridge&ei;=7RGvSZjRCJ-aMpSukJIF Etiquette writers assert that etiquette rules, rather than being stuffy or elitist, serve to make life more pleasant. Mary Mitchell states that in most, if not all, cases where conflict emerges between external rules and the urge to be kind and considerate, manners should trump etiquette. She emphasizes that: \\"In every human situation there is the correct action, the incorrect action, and the appropriate action.\\" Mitchell, Mary. \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Etiquette, Third Edition.\\" Page xxiv. Though etiquette rules may seem arbitrary at times and in various situations, these are the very situations in which a common set of accepted customs can help to eliminate awkwardness. While etiquette is often a means to make others feel comfortable, it is also the case that etiquette can serve to eliminate inappropriate behaviors in others by increasing discomfort. Bodily functions One should attempt to suppress yawning in polite company, concealing the mouth with the back of the hand.\\"Miss Manners\\" column by Judith Martin, United Features Syndicate, Mar. 17, 2009 Also, sneezing into a handkerchief, tissue, or side of your sleeve is expected, rather than turning or sneezing into the open air. Names and forms of address When first introduced to someone, one should address and be addressed as Miss, Ms., Mrs. or Mr. followed by the surname. Only minors should be addressed by first name. Once a relationship has been established, one may request to be addressed by first name. In particular formal situations, such a request can be considered a sign of trust and intimacy. While professional, academic, religious, military and political titles, such as \\"Judge\\", \\"Colonel\\", \\"Mayor\\", \\"Reverend\\", \\"Senator\\", and \\"Doctor\\" are often used in social situations, Miss, Ms., Mrs. or Mr. are also considered appropriate, especially when one is unaware of such credentials. A personal preference should be honored once it is made known. Private life Invitations *Hospitality requires that when extending an invitation as a host, one anticipates and provides for the needs of the invited guests. \\"Strings\\" may not be attached to the invitation. Guest responsibilities include dressing appropriately to the occasion, and providing one's own transportation and lodging. As a courtesy, the host may include dress instructions.Post, Emily. \\"Etiquette\\". 17th edition. Chapter 18. Page 248 (See section on weddings for details on standard North American attire.) Generally, etiquette writers consider it incorrect to include any suggestion that gifts are, or even could have been, expected at a hosted event, and therefore no mention of gift registries or other prohibitive or prescriptive statements on an invitation are permitted, such as \\"monetary gifts only\\", or \\"no gifts, please\\".Post, Peggy. Etiquette. 17th edition. Page 635. If a guest inquires himself, such things may only then be brought up by the host. Only overnight guests should feel obliged to bring a gift for the host. An invitation is meant only for the people to whom it is addressed. \\"Mr. and Mrs. Jones\\" does not mean \\"Mr. and Mrs. Jones and any of their relatives they may wish to bring.\\" If wishing to invite additional family members, the host should not add \\"... and Family\\", but instead should be specific rather than have the invitees guess what exactly this means. Individuals may decline or accept invitations extended to multiple persons. For example, a woman may accept an invitation extended to her entire family, even if the husband and children must send regrets (all in the same letter to the host). Invitations for mixed social events, such as parties, weddings, etc., must be extended to the established significant others of any invitees, such as spouses, fianc√©s, or long time or live-in boyfriends or girlfriends. The significant other must be invited by name, and the host should inquire if it is not known. If the couple does not live together, the host should inquire as to the partner's full name and address and send a separate invitation for formal occasions. If a person's socially established partner has not been invited, etiquette allows him or her to politely request that the host do so. Persons without socially established partners may not request to bring a guest, nor is a host expected to invite singles to bring a date (i.e., \\"[Invitee] and Guest\\").http://lifestyle.msn.com/relationships/articlepage.aspx?cp- documentid=16692391 *When receiving an invitation, one is obliged to respond in kind as soon as possible. This means if receiving the invitation by phone, reply by phone, etc. One must accept or decline even if \\"RSVP\\" is not specified. To not do so is an insult to the host. Most formal invitations are hand-written,Martin, Judith. Miss Manners on Painfully Proper Weddings. Page 92.Post, Peggy. Etiquette. 17th edition. Page 625. but for large numbers, such as for weddings, engraved or printed invitations are acceptable, though less formal. Printing is considered less appropriate than \\"frank and honest\\" handwriting.Martin, Judith. Miss Manners on Painfully Proper Weddings. Page 87. Engraved invitations, which are more expensive than printed ones, are shipped with protective tissue paper to prevent wet ink from smudging, but as the ink has dried by the time they are received by the hosts, they should be removed before mailing to guests, and etiquette authorities consider their inclusion to be improper and a form of bragging.Martin, Judith. Miss Manners on Painfully Proper Weddings. Page 104. Emily Post's Etiquette gives examples of the traditional forms for formal and informal invitations;Post, Emily. Etiquette. 1922 edition. http://www.bartleby.com/95/11.html granddaughter Peggy Post provides updated examples of the forms in Etiquette (17th edition) that take into account non-traditional social relationships. Reply cards, with or without postage, may be included with an invitation according to some etiquette writers, though they need not be.Post, Peggy. Etiquette. 17th edition. Page 642. However, Judith Martin calls response cards \\"vulgar\\",Martin, Judith. Miss Manners' Guide for the Turn-of-the-Millennium. Page 616. as they imply the guest would not reply without being prompted to do so.Martin, Judith. Miss Manners on Painfully Proper Weddings. Page 102. She advocates discarding them and replying on one's own stationery, while Peggy Post suggests that guests use them if included, to avoid interfering with the host's card collection system. Some say maps, directions, websites, and other information may be included.Post, Peggy. Etiquette. 17th edition. Page 643. Others note that these are not formal aspects of an invitation, and therefore should not be included in formal invitations, and those who accept should instead later be sent the information via informal communication, such as postal mail, phone, or the Internet. At-home cards may be included with wedding invitations. Traditionally, they announced the bride and groom's new address; they are now more likely to be used to announce the couple's choice of surnames.Post, Peggy. Etiquette. 17th edition. Page 644. Weddings :See also \\"Gifts\\" and \\"Invitations\\" sections Weddings are often an occasion for particular concern about etiquette; and for some people, weddings are the only time when etiquette becomes a concern. In general, etiquette writers state that a wedding should be one more occasion for the exercise of thoughtfulness towards others, and thus a wedding is not, as is often said, \\"my special day\\" (a term \\"which seems to sanction selfishness\\"), \\"her day\\", or \\"their day\\", but an event to be enjoyed by all invited to be present.Martin, Judith. Miss Manners on Painfully Proper Weddings. Chapter 2. Page 24. Wedding planning Etiquette writers agree that the first step in planning a wedding should be selecting the guest list, not deciding on the type of wedding to be held.Post, Peggy. Etiquette. 17th edition. Chapter 34. Page 572.Martin, Judith. Miss Manners on Painfully Proper Weddings. Chapter 7. Page 70. This is because others' enjoyment of the celebration should be a priority, not one's personal desires or fantasies,Martin, Judith. Miss Manners on Painfully Proper Weddings. Chapter 7. or as Judith Martin said, \\"The guest list should have priority over the arrangements, which is to say that you ask first who should be there, and then what you can afford to feed them, rather than the other way around.\\" Traditionally, \\"the guest list was divided equally between the bride's and the groom's families and friends, but this is no longer considered necessary\\". Likewise, etiquette writers prescribe that the selection of a bridal party should be based on interpersonal closeness to the bride or to the groom. In the past, women were most likely to choose female attendants, and likewise for the groom and males, but \\"friendship [should be] the chief factor, not gender\\"Martin, Judith. Miss Manners on Painfully Proper Weddings. Chapter 10. Page 138. in selecting attendants. Each member of the bridal party should stand with the person to whom he or she is closest. Terms such as \\"man of honor\\", \\"bridesmen\\", \\"groomswomen\\", and \\"best woman\\" are used when appropriate.

Public interactions Seating If seating is limited (or there is standing-room only) in public transportation or waiting areas, it is proper for people in good health to offer their seats to an elderly person and to those with special needs, such as the frail, disabled, people with infants, and pregnant women. It is considered rude, however, to ask another person to give up his or her seat, as they may have a medical or physical condition.

He played with the local Austin Stacks Gaelic sports club and was a member of the Kerry senior inter-county team from 1969 until 1984. He was a highly talented midfielder, and one of the most stylish and accomplished full-backs in Gaelic football history. He later became the Irish international rules team manager. Career highlights O'Keeffe won seven All-Ireland Senior Football Championship medals and 12 Munster Championship medals. Other honours he won include seven National Football League medals and eight Railway Cup medals between Munster and the Combined Universities. He also won a Munster Junior Championship medal in 1969. He is among the leading recipients of GAA All Stars Awards, with five awards from 1973, 1975, 1976, 1978, and 1979. He was also named the Texaco Footballer of the Year in 1975. O'Keeffe retired reluctantly on medical advice after the 1984 Munster Final with a serious hip complaint, having played relatively few games in the previous 18 months. He had hip replacement surgery some 20 years later. His last game for Kerry was in the full back position against Tipperary in the 1984 Munster semi-final. O'Keeffe has always maintained that probably his most dangerous opponent was Dublin's Jimmy Keaveney, with whom he enjoyed several battles. His performance against Offaly's Matt Connor in the 1982 All-Ireland final was all the more remarkable considering he had little or no training preparation owing to injury. O'Keeffe is consistently named as full back in various GAA players/managers best ever team selections, particularly in the years leading up to the GAA's Centenary and beyond. He was captain of the Austin Stacks team that won the 1976 County Senior Football Championship, he also won medals in 1973, 1974, 1979 and 1986 (following a brief comeback), as well as a Munster Club Championship in 1976 and an All-Ireland in 1977. He also won a County Minor Hurling Championship with the club in 1967. He was part of the St. Brendan's Killarney side that won the school's first Hogan Cup title in 1969. With the UCD GAA team, he won a Dublin County Championship in 1974, and the Leinster Club Championships and All-Ireland Club Championships in 1973-74 and 1974-75. He also won Sigerson Cup medals in 1973, 1974, and 1975. He taught history, , and at Tralee Christian Brothers School before retiring after 40 years in 2011. In May 2020, the Irish Independent named O'Keeffe at number ten in its \\"Top 20 footballers in Ireland over the past 50 years\\".

Stefan Both, \\"Stefan W.Hell, al doilea elev de la Liceul 'Nikolaus Lenau' din Timi≈üoara care a c√¢≈ütigat un Nobel\\", AdevƒÉrul, October 8, 2014 His father was an engineer and his mother a teacher; the family settled in Ludwigshafen after emigrating. Hell began his studies at the Heidelberg University in 1981, where he received his doctorate in physics in 1990. His thesis advisor was the solid-state physicist Siegfried Hunklinger. The title of the thesis was ‚ÄúImaging of transparent microstructures in a confocal microscope‚Äù. He was an independent inventor for a short period thereafter working on improving depth (axial) resolution in confocal microscopy, which became later known as the 4Pi microscope. Resolution is the possibility to separate two similar objects in close proximity and is therefore the most important property of a microscope. From 1991 to 1993 Hell worked at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg, where he succeeded in demonstrating the principles of 4-Pi microscopy. From 1993 to 1996 he worked as a group leader at the University of Turku (Finland) in the department for Medical Physics, where he developed the principle for stimulated emission depletion STED microscopy. From 1993 to 1994 Hell was also for 6 months a visiting scientist at the University of Oxford (England). He received his habilitation in physics from the University of Heidelberg in 1996. On 15 October 2002 Hell became a director of the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in G√∂ttingen and he established the department of Nanobiophotonics. Since 2003 Hell has also been the leader of the department \\"Optical Nanoscopy division\\" at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in Heidelberg and \\"non-budgeted professor\\" (apl. Prof.) in the Heidelberg University Faculty of Physics and Astronomy. Since 2004 he has been an honorary professor for experimental physics at the faculty of physics of the University of G√∂ttingen. With the invention and subsequent development of Stimulated Emission Depletion microscopy and related microscopy methods, he was able to show that one can substantially improve the resolving power of the fluorescence microscope, previously limited to half the wavelength of the employed light (> 200 nanometers). A microscope's resolution is its most important property. Hell was the first to demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, how one can decouple the resolution of the fluorescence microscope from diffraction and increase it to a fraction of the wavelength of light (to the nanometer scale). Ever since the work of Ernst Karl Abbe in 1873, this feat was not thought possible. For this achievement and its significance for other fields of science, such as the life-sciences and medical research, he received the 10th German Innovation Award (Deutscher Zukunftspreis) on 23 November 2006. He received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2014, becoming the second Nobelist born in the Banat Swabian community (after Herta M√ºller, the 2009 recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature).

KDFO is licensed to Delano, California, and serves the Bakersfield, California, area. The station is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc.. History 98.5 KDNO 98.5 KDNO was a Christian radio station in Bakersfield started by Richard Palmquist in 1970. The station was known as Uplift 98.5. The station was on the air until he sold it in 1997 to Mondosphere Corporation and went into retirement. Today, the KDNO call letters belong to a station in Wyoming. KDNO was owned by a California Corporation, Tape Networks INC., founded by Palmquist when he was a broadcast consultant in Glendale, California. After building KDNO for a client, that owner suffered the loss of his bank loan. Palmquist arranged for his friend Chester Newell to purchase the station, and Palmquist became the manager. Later, Newell sold the station to Tape Networks, Inc. Palmquist raised the purchase price by soliciting help from KDNO listeners. The station, however, was devoted to ministry rather than revenue, so Palmquist purchased the Pixley Enterprise Newspaper and later the Terra Bella News. He merged them to form the \\"Enterprise News,\\" and the newspaper became commercially successful, proving a living for the Palmquist family and helping to support the radio ministry. After two unsuccessful efforts to sell the newspaper, Palmquist closed that business in 1993 to concentrate on improving the radio station's music and Bible teaching ministry. However, income from listener support, though supporting current expenses, could not pay off the half million dollar long term debt on the station. So when Palmquist reached retirement age, he sold the station to honor his obligation to those who had helped purchase and build the station.

He won 89 races, the most in the history of the sport of Thoroughbred racing. Of his 138 starts, he was out of the money only on four occasions. He was later inducted into the United States Racing Hall of Fame. Background He was bred by James R. Keene at his Castleton Stud near Lexington, Kentucky. Kingston was by Spendthrift out of Kapanga (GB) by Victorious, 2nd dam Kapunda, by Stockwell. Kingston's line goes back through Spendthrift to three significant sires: Lexington, Glencoe, and Boston. Keene only sold him because he was having financial difficulties. As a yearling, Kingston was purchased by the trainer, Evert Snedecker, and his partner J. F. Cushman. They raced him as a two-year- old, during which time he proved himself a colt of quality, though he was beaten by both Hanover and the noted Tremont. As a three-year-old, Kingston was bought by two Brooklyn ex-butchers, Phil and Mike Dwyer for $12,500. The Dwyer Brothers typically bought horses rather than breeding them, their chosen strategy for building a successful stable. They hoped that owning both Kingston and Hanover would prevent Hanover from racing a horse which might defeat him. Racing record Once under the Dwyer's roof, Kingston's conditioning was taken over by future Hall of Fame member Frank McCabe. The colt then went on a streak of success. At three, he won 13 of his 18 starts. At four, he won 10 of 14. At five, he won 14 times from 15 starts. At six, he won 9 of 10 of his ten starts. At seven, he started 21 times and won 15. When he was seven he also set a time record at the old Futurity course at Sheepshead Bay of 1:08 for six furlongs. At the age of eight, he won 13 of his 20 races. At nine, 9 out of 25, but in most of these 25 races he took home money. In his last year of racing, when he was 10 years old, he won four of his nine starts against much younger horses.TbH: Spendthrift Retrieved 2010-4-22 As an entire Kingston still raced way past the age when intact horses are retired to stud. Many experts believe a stallion sours if he‚Äôs raced too long, but Kingston was as good a sire as he was a race horse. Stud record Two years after he went to stud Kingston was already a leading sire. He led the American sire list in 1900 and 1910. Kingston's progeny included: Ely (Gold Cup Stakes), Ildrim (Belmont Stakes), Novelty (Belmont Futurity Stakes etc.) and King's Courier (Doncaster Cup).ASB: Kingston (USA) Retrieved 2010-4-22Morris, Simon; Tesio Power 2000 - Stallions of the World, Syntax Software He died in Kentucky on December 6, 1912.

It reached number 193 on The Billboard 200 chart. Background The music on Aereo-Plain is a blend of traditional bluegrass musicianship, and the hippie spirit of the '70s. The album sold so poorly that Warner Bros. decided to devote no promotion at all to Hartford's next release Morning Bugle. Nevertheless, Aereo-Plain has been called the forerunner of the genre now known as \\"Newgrass\\". Hartford subsequently asked to be released from his contract and later signed with Flying Fish Records.Hote, Ky. 2002. Folk & Acoustic Music Exchange review of Steam Powered Aereo-Takes. The other members of the Aereo-Plain Band were bluegrass veterans Norman Blake, Vassar Clements, Tut Taylor, and Randy Scruggs. The sessions were controlled but relaxed, as Taylor commented, \\"John let us play what we wanted to play. 'Cause that's one of the beautiful parts about it‚Äîhe just let us get in there and pick.\\" Producer David Bromberg recounted, \\"We'd sit around and smoke pot and play \\"Sally Goodin\\" for an hour and a half.

One of the attractions to this material is that Hartford seems to be in his element, just doing what comes natural to him... Aereo-Plain signaled the full blooming of his eccentric talent. This is an essential album for any fan, revealing both his genius and the glory days of early '70s progressive bluegrass.\\" Music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a B+ rating, writing \\"I must admit that Norman Blake's guitar, Tut Taylor's dobro, and Vassar Clements's fiddle complement Hartford with tact, wit, and sly razzmatazz. But I insist that it's Hartford's funny, quirkish songs, rather than his banjo, that save me from continued boorishness.\\" Stylus Magazine's 2006 review praised Hartford and the album: \\"It would be easy to call Aereo-Plain an 'Old Weird America' classic, but Hartford‚Äôs loves were never so static, and he seemed in on the joke besides.

Congenital estrogen deficiency can alternatively be caused by a defect in aromatase, the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of estrogens, a condition which is referred to as aromatase deficiency and is similar in symptomatology to EIS. EIS is an extremely rare occurrence. As of 2016, there have been three published reports of EIS, involving a total of five individuals. The reports include a male case published in 1994, a female case published in 2013, and a familial case involving two sisters and a brother which was published in 2016. EIS is analogous to androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), a condition in which the androgen receptor (AR) is defective and insensitive to androgens, such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The functional opposite of EIS is hyperestrogenism, for instance that seen in aromatase excess syndrome. History Male case In 1994, a 28-year-old man with EIS was reported. He was fully masculinized. At 204 cm, he had tall stature. His epiphyses were unfused, and there was evidence of still-occurring slow linear growth (for comparison, his height at 16 years of age was 178 cm). He also had markedly delayed skeletal maturation (bone age 15 years), a severely undermineralized skeleton, evidence of increased bone resorption, and very early-onset osteoporosis. The genitalia, testes, and prostate of the patient were all normal and of normal size/volume. The sperm count of the patient was normal (25 million/mL; normal, >20 million/mL), but his sperm viability was low (18%; normal, >50%), indicating some degree of infertility. The patient also had early-onset temporal hair loss. He reported no history of gender identity disorder, considered himself to have strong heterosexual interests, and had normal sexual function, including morning erections and nocturnal emissions. Follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels were considerably elevated (30‚Äì33 mIU/mL and 34‚Äì37 mIU/mL, respectively) and estradiol and estrone levels were markedly elevated (145 pg/mL and 119‚Äì272 pg/mL, respectively), while testosterone levels were normal (445 ng/dL). Sex hormone- binding globulin levels were mildly elevated (6.0‚Äì10.0 nmol/L), while thyroxine-binding globulin, corticosteroid-binding globulin, and prolactin levels were all normal. Osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase levels were both substantially elevated (18.7‚Äì21.6 ng/mL and 33.3‚Äì35.9 ng/mL, respectively). Treatment with up to very high doses of estradiol (fourteen 100-Œºg Estraderm patches per week) had no effect on any of his symptoms of hypoestrogenism, did not produce any estrogenic effects such as gynecomastia, and had no effect on any of his physiological parameters (e.g., hormone levels or bone parameters), suggesting a profile of complete estrogen insensitivity syndrome. Female case In 2013, an 18-year-old woman with EIS was reported. DNA sequencing revealed a homozygous mutation in ESR1, the gene that encodes the ERŒ±. Within the ligand-binding domain, the neutral polar glutamine 375 was changed to a basic, polar histidine. An in vitro assay of ERŒ±- dependent gene transcription found that the EC50 for transactivation had been reduced by 240-fold relative to normal, non-mutated ERŒ±, indicating an extreme reduction in the activity of the receptor. Clinical signs suggested a profile of complete estrogen insensitivity syndrome with a resemblance to ERŒ± knockout mice. The patient presented with delayed puberty, including an absence of breast development (Tanner stage I) and primary amenorrhea, as well as intermittent pelvic pain. Examination revealed markedly enlarged ovaries with multiple hemorrhagic cysts as the cause of the lower abdominal pain. Estrogen levels were dramatically and persistently elevated (estradiol levels were 2,340 pg/mL, regarded as being about 10 times the normal level, and ranged from 750‚Äì3,500 pg/mL), gonadotropin levels were mildly elevated (follicle- stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels were 6.7‚Äì19.1 mIU/mL and 5.8‚Äì13.2 mIU/mL, respectively), and testosterone levels were slightly elevated (33‚Äì88 ng/dL). Inhibin A levels were also markedly elevated. Sex hormone- binding globulin, corticosteroid-binding globulin, thyroxine-binding globulin, prolactin, and triglycerides, which are known to be elevated by estrogen, were all within normal ranges in spite of the extremely high levels of estrogen, and inhibin B levels were also normal. Her relatively mildly elevated levels of gonadotropins were attributed to retained negative feedback by progesterone as well as by her elevated levels of testosterone and inhibin A, although it was acknowledged that possible effects of estrogen mediated by other receptors such as ERŒ≤ could not be excluded. The patient had a small uterus, with an endometrial stripe that could not be clearly identified. At the age of 15 years, 5 months, her bone age was 11 or 12 years, and at the age of 17 years, 8 months, her bone age was 13.5 years. Her bone mass was lower than expected for her age, and levels of osteocalcin and C-terminal telopeptide were both elevated, suggesting an increased rate of bone turnover. She was 162.6 cm tall, and her growth velocity indicated a lack of estrogen-induced growth spurt at puberty. The patient had normal pubic hair development (Tanner stage IV) and severe facial acne, which could both be attributed to testosterone. Her ovarian pathology was attributed to the elevated levels of gonadotropins. In addition to her absence of breast development and areolar enlargement, the patient also appeared to show minimal widening of the hips and a lack of subcutaneous fat deposition, which is in accordance with the established role of estrogen and ERŒ± in the development of female secondary sexual characteristics. Treatment of the patient with conjugated estrogens and high doses of estradiol had no effect. Although the authors of the paper considered her ERŒ± to be essentially unresponsive to estrogen, they stated that they \\"[could not] exclude the possibility that some residual estrogen sensitivity could be present in some tissues\\", which is in accordance with the fact that the EC50 of her ERŒ± had been reduced 240-fold but had not been abolished. Treatment with a progestin, norethisterone, reduced her estradiol concentrations to normal levels and decreased the size of her ovaries and the number of ovarian cysts, alleviating her hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis hyperactivity and ovarian pathology. Familial case In 2016, a familial instance of EIS involving three siblings was reported. The afflicted individuals were a 25-year-old female, a 21-year-old female, and an 18-year- old male. The family was consanguineous, with the parents of the siblings being first cousins. The parents were both heterozygous for the causative mutation and were healthy and normal, while the three affected siblings were homozygous for the mutation, and a fourth sibling, an unaffected sister, was heterozygous. The fact that the heterozygous parents and heterozygous sister were unaffected indicates that the disorder is transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner and that a single normal allele is sufficient to achieve normal puberty and fertility, which is consistent with what has been observed in ERŒ± knockout mice. All three siblings presented with pubertal failure. Both of the sisters had no breast development (i.e., Tanner stage I), illustrating how the ERŒ± is absolutely required for normal mammary gland development. The older sister was overweight ( 26.3) and had mild incidental adipomastia, or adipose tissue deposition in the breasts without true glandular tissue, a trait that is not indicative of pubertal development. The sisters had complete pubic hair maturation (i.e., Tanner stage V), while the brother had Tanner stage II pubic hair development and Tanner stage I gonadal maturation. The right testis of the brother was cryptorchid, while the left testis was severely hypoplastic, with a volume of less than 1 mL. Both of the sisters presented with primary amenorrhea and enlarged, multicystic ovaries, and the older sister had a small uterus and a thin endometrium. The older sister had chest acne, which could be attributed to hyperandrogenism (see below). All three siblings showed markedly delayed bone maturation for their chronological ages. Surprisingly, the older sister was of normal height, while the younger sister was tall. In all three siblings, estradiol levels were markedly elevated and gonadotropin levels were elevated. In the sisters, estradiol levels were extremely high, more than 50-fold greater than normal levels, while gonadotropin levels were elevated 3-fold above the normal range. Levels of progesterone, 17Œ±-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) were elevated in the sisters, while concentrations of adrenal steroids including cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), 11Œ≤-hydroxyandrostenedione, 11-deoxycortisol, and 21-deoxycortisol were within normal ranges. Levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were very low, which can be attributed to the absence of hepatic actions of estrogen. In the older sister, anti-M√ºllerian hormone (AMH) levels were normal, while levels of inhibin A and inhibin B were significantly increased. In the brother, levels of AMH and inhibin B were low, in conjunction with the patient's low concentrations of testosterone. The low testosterone levels of the brother were probably related to his cryptorchidism, this symptom having not been previously reported in the earlier male case report of EIS. Consistent with the brother's phenotype, cryptorchidism has been described in ERŒ± knockout mice. Because of the brother's low inhibin B levels, it was stated by the researchers that it was very likely that spermatogenesis would not occur in him. Impaired negative feedback by estrogen on the hypothalamic-pituitary- gonadal (HPG) axis would account for the elevated estradiol and gonadotropin levels in the siblings and for the ovarian enlargement and cyst formation in the sisters. All three siblings were homozygous for a missense mutation in the fifth coding exon of the ESR1 gene. The mutation caused a change from guanine to adenine at complementary DNA nucleotide 1181 (c.1181G>A) in the gene, which resulted in the substitution of a histidine for an arginine at residue 394 (p.Arg394His) in the helix H5 of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the ERŒ± protein. This is a critical residue that is completely conserved among species and in the androgen receptor (AR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Mutations involving the corresponding residue in the AR and MR have previously been associated with androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) and diminished sensitivity to mineralocorticoids, respectively. Assays revealed that the mutated ERŒ± showed strongly reduced transcriptional activity in response to stimulation by estradiol, with an ED50 that was approximately 65-fold greater than that of normal/wild-type ERŒ±. In the normal ERŒ±, estradiol is anchored in the binding pocket of the receptor by three hydrogen bonds; the C3 and C17 hydroxyl groups of estradiol are anchored by the Glu353 and Arg394, and His524 residues of the ERŒ± protein, respectively. In the mutated ERŒ±, the His394 residue is unable to properly anchor estradiol, which results in the dramatically reduced sensitivity and response of the receptor to estradiol relative to the normal ERŒ±. A group of other ERŒ± agonists that included ethinylestradiol, diethylstilbestrol, tamoxifen, clomifene, and raloxifene were tested in their ability to promote transcriptional activity of the mutated ERŒ±, but none of them were found to be more efficacious than estradiol in activating the mutated receptor and hence in overcoming the estrogen insensitivity of the siblings. As the sisters had very high, supraphysiological levels of circulating estradiol, the authors cautioned that it could not be ruled out that estradiol may have exerted some functional influence on their phenotypes via signaling through the ERŒ≤ and GPER (i.e., that not all of the observed phenotypes may have simply been due to loss of ERŒ± signaling). Moreover, the authors noted that this might partially explain the variability in the phenotypes. Research EIS can be experimentally induced in animals via knockout of the ER. In these so-called ERKO mice, different ERs can be disabled allowing to study the role of these receptors. ERKO mice show development of the respective female or male reproductive systems, and male and female Œ±ERKO mice are infertile, Œ≤ERKO males are fertile while females are subfertile, male and female double Œ±ERKO and Œ≤ERKO mice are infertile. The uterus and mammary glands are hypoplastic and do not respond to exogenous stimulation by estrogens. Males are infertile with atrophy in the testes. Bone age is delayed and bones are more brittle. Variations in these patterns can be achieved by selectively disabling the ERŒ± or ERŒ≤. The following sections are an extensive though partial/incomplete list of deficits observed in ERKO mice. Œ±ERKO mice Females * Estradiol and LH levels are dramatically elevated due to loss of negative feedback by estradiol on the HPG axis. FSH levels, in contrast, are normal. Testosterone levels are also substantially elevated. Prolactin levels are decreased by 5-fold, which is due to a loss of its estradiol-induced secretion from the anterior pituitary. * The uterus and endometrium show hypoplasia and hypotrophy, respectively, and the vagina is atrophic. The oviduct is normal. The ovary is normal until sexual maturity, at which point there is complete anovulation and the ovaries become enlarged, hemorrhagic, and cystic. Because there is complete anovulation, female Œ±ERKO mice are infertile. The ovarian phenotype closely resembles that of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in humans. It is caused by chronic exposure to abnormally high levels of LH. By 18 months of age, there is a 30 to 40% incidence of ovarian tumors. * The mammary gland is normal until puberty, at which point there is a complete absence of pubertal development and the gland remains in a prepubertal state. * Body weight and body fat are increased. There are signs of insulin resistance, as in PCOS in humans. * Due to the substantially elevated testosterone levels, there is hyperandrogenism, including masculinization of the preputial glands. In addition, female Œ±ERKO mice exhibit behavior that is similar to that of males in terms of parental, aggressive, and sexual activities. There is a complete lack of sexual receptivity, measured as lordosis behavior. There are significant deficits in parental behavior, including a tendency toward infanticide, and aggressive behavior is increased. Males * LH and testosterone levels are both increased 2-fold due to loss of negative feedback by estradiol on the HPG axis. * The testes develop relatively normally initially, but are slightly smaller than normal and possess various defects. By 20 weeks, the weights of the testes, epididymis, and vas deferens are significantly decreased relative to those of normal mice. However, there is a severe testicular phenotype with age, such that the testes are completely atrophied by 150 days of age. Also, the testes show Leydig cell hyperplasia, which is due to the increased levels of LH and intratesticular testosterone. Further, there is a greater incidence of cryptorchidism (undescended/retracted testes). * There is complete infertility, which is due both to testicular defects and to severely compromised normal sexual behavior (see below). Males can produce viable sperm, but there are severe deficits in both spermatogenesis and sperm function, the latter rendering produced sperm ineffective. Sperm counts are significantly reduced, at 55% of those of normal mice, and further diminish with age, at 13% of those of normal mice by 16 weeks of age. There are deficits in sperm motility, an increased incidence of sperm defects (specifically, sperm heads separated from the flagellum (tail)), and a complete inability of sperm to fertilize oocytes (assessed in vitro). * There are no obvious abnormalities in the male accessory glands, including the prostate gland, bulbourethral glands, coagulating gland, and seminal vesicles. However, there is a significant increase in weight of the seminal vesicles/coagulating gland that becomes more apparent with age, which is likely due to elevated testosterone levels. * Aggressive behavior is dramatically reduced, whereas parental behavior, in terms of infanticide, is relatively normal. There is little effect on sexual behavior in terms of mounting and sexual attraction to females. However, there is an almost complete lack of intromission and ejaculation, in spite of the relatively normal mounting rate. This contributes to infertility. Œ≤ERKO mice Females * The uterus, vagina, and oviducts are normal. The ovary is normal prior to puberty, and there is still no gross aberrant phenotype during adulthood. However, there is partial anovulation and subfertility, which is due to ovarian defects, namely compromised follicular maturation via loss of estradiol signaling in ovarian granulosa cells. * The mammary gland appears to be normal. * Body weight and fat distribution appear to be normal. * Increased anxiety-like behavior is seen. In addition, the antidepressant-like effects of exogenous estradiol in the forced swim test are lost. Males * Fertility is full and normal, with a lack of relevant phenotypes observed. * The male accessory glands, including the prostate gland, bulbourethral glands, coagulating gland, and seminal vesicles, all seem to be normal. However, there is an increased incidence of prostate hyperplasia with age. * Body weight and fat distribution appear to be normal. * There is a lack of grossly apparent behavioral phenotypes, including in regards to sexual behavior. However, increased aggressive behavior is observed. GPERKO mice GPER knockout mice have also been generated, and exhibit obesity, cardiovascular dysfunction, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, differences in mammary carcinogenesis and metastasis, and differences in central nervous system function. Androgen insensitivity syndrome In contrast to EIS, androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), a condition in which the androgen receptor (AR) is defective, is relatively common. This can be explained by the genetics of each syndrome. AIS is an X-linked recessive condition and thus carried over, by females, into future generations (although the most severe form, complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), results in sterility, and hence cannot be passed on to offspring). EIS is not compatible with reproduction, thus each occurrence in humans would have to be a de novo mutation and is not transmitted to offspring.

It was set up to facilitate automatic enrolment as part of the government's workplace pension reforms under the Pensions Act 2008. Due to its public service obligation, any UK employer can use NEST to meet its new workplace duties as set out in the Pensions Act 2008. The Pensions Act 2008 established new duties which stated that employers need to provide their UK workers with access to a workplace pension plan that meets certain minimum standards. Some workers will be automatically enrolled into the pension plan and others can ask to join. The former is called 'automatic enrolment'. These reforms affect the majority of UK employers and are intended to help up to 11 million more people save for retirement. National Employment Savings Trust (NEST) is one of the qualifying pension schemes that employers can use to meet their new duties. It was set up as part of the government's workplace pension reforms. NEST is a trust-based defined contribution pension scheme, run by a Trustee (NEST Corporation) on a not-for-profit basis. In April 2014 NEST Corporation announced that it had over 1 million members saving in the scheme. Charges NEST is free for employers to use. Members pay a 1.8% charge on contributions plus a 0.3% annual management charge (AMC) on their total pot. Together, the charges are broadly equivalent to a 0.5% AMC for most types of saver. In March 2014 the government announced it plans to apply a charge cap of 0.75% of funds under management on default funds of DC qualifying pension schemes from April 2015. The National Employment Savings Trust currently has an annual contribution limit. It is reviewed annually and is currently ¬£4,900 for the 2016/17 tax year. It also has restrictions on transfers in and out of the scheme. In July 2013, The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) announced that it planned to legislate to lift the restrictions on NEST (the annual contribution limit and restrictions on transfers) from April 2017 and indicated that the restrictions on individual transfers may be lifted earlier when the 'pot follows member' arrangements in the Pensions Bill 2013/2014 are introduced. Investment approach Members who are automatically enrolled into NEST are put into a NEST Retirement Date Fund. The NEST Retirement Date Funds are managed according to the life stage of members in them. Members can change funds at any time after enrolment if they want to. NEST also has a small number of other fund choices, including a Sharia Fund and Ethical Fund. Establishment Proposed by the Labour Government in a May 2006 white paper; the infrastructure for NEST was established through the Pensions Act 2008. The creation of NEST‚Äîoriginally known as \\"Personal Accounts\\", was one of the recommendations of The Second Report of the Pensions Commission ‚Äì A New Pensions Settlement for the Twenty-First Century (2006) under the chairmanship of Adair Turner. The Pensions Act 2007 established a transitional body, the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority (PADA) to advise on the implementation and launch of Personal Accounts. PADA consulted on various aspects of the final scheme before passing these responsibilities to NEST Corporation, the trustee of NEST. The current Chair of NEST Corporation is Otto Thoresen. NEST Corporation's chief executive is Helen Dean.

It is perhaps the most commonly grown orchid cactus and seems to survive and flower under most conditions. It has a very complex taxonomic history and has been mistaken for Disocactus ackermannii for a long time. The name Cactus jenkinsonii McIntosh (1829) might be an older name, but there is no combination under Disocactus. History In 1824, George Ackermann brought a part of a stem with him from Mexico and gave that to Tate who succeeded in flowering the specimen. Another specimen raised from Mexican seeds confirmed that this was really a novelty from Mexico and not a hybrid. The species was soon lost in cultivation. During the latter half of the 19th century, when cacti gave away to ferns, palms and orchids, only the toughest survived and as D. ackermannii is quite tricky it soon became lost in cultivation. About the same time some gardener succeeded in crossing D. phyllanthoides and D. speciosus producing a lovely red flowered hybrid. Being a vigorous, hardy, free-flowering plant, almost impossible to kill, it survived in collections. Unfortunately it was confused with the true D. ackermannii so when Britton and Rose published The Cactaceae, the switch had been made and the true species was forgotten. What Britton and Rose describe under Epiphyllum ackermanni is the hybrid, not the species. In 1943, Charles Gilles rediscovered the species in high, nearly unclimbable trees near Jalapa. He managed to collect living material and it was soon evident that the plant in cultivation was not the plant of Haworth. This hybrid is today correctly referred to as Disocactus √ó hybridus 'Ackermannii'. Description The stems are flat to triangular, often quite thick and succulent. The flowers are more or less funnel shaped, usually orange to red. The stigma lobes are white, never lavender. Cultivars This cross has been remade many times creating several cultivars. However, many of them are confused today and cannot be identified.

The model was initially proposed in 1986 by psycholinguists Herb Clark and Deanna Wilkes-Gibbs.Clark, H. H., & Wilkes-Gibbs, D. (1986). Referring as a collaborative process. Cognition, 22(1), 1-39. It asserts that conversation partners must act collaboratively to reach a mutual understanding ‚Äì i.e. the speaker must tailor their utterances to better suit the listener, and the listener must indicate to the speaker that they have understood. In this ongoing process, both conversation partners must work together in order to establish what a given noun phrase is referring to. The referential process can be initiated by the speaker using one of at least six types of noun phrases: the elementary noun phrase, the episodic noun phrase, the installment noun phrase, the provisional noun phrase, the dummy noun phrase, and/or the proxy noun phrase. Once this presentation is made, the listener must accept it either through presupposing acceptance (i.e. letting the speaker continue uninterrupted) or asserting acceptance (i.e. through a continuer such as \\"yes\\", okay\\", or a head nod). The speaker must then acknowledge this signal of acceptance. In this process, presentation and acceptance goes back and forth, and some utterances can simultaneously be both presentations and acceptances. This model also posits that conversationalists strive for minimum collaborative effort by making references based more on permanent properties than temporary properties and by refining perspective on referents through simplification and narrowing .  History  The collaborative model finds its roots in Grice's cooperative principle and four Gricean maxims, theories which prominently established the idea that conversation is a collaborative process between speaker and listener. However, until the Clark & Wilkes-Gibbs study, the prevailing theory was the literary model (or autonomous model or traditional model). This model likened the process of a speaker establishing reference to an author writing a book to distant readers. In the literary model, the speaker is the one who retains complete control and responsibility over the course of referent determination. The listener, in this theory, simply hears and understands the definite description as if they were reading it and, if successful, figures out the identity of the referent on their own. This autonomous view of reference establishment wasn't challenged until a paper by D.R. Olson was published in 1970.Olson, D. R. (1970). \\"Language and thought: Aspects of a cognitive theory of semantics.\\" Psychological Review, 77, 257-273. It was then suggested that there very well could be a collaborative element in the process of establishing reference. Olson, while still holding to the literary model, suggested that speakers select the words they do based on context and what they believe the listener will understand.  Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs  Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs criticized the literary model in their 1986 paper; they asserted that the model failed to account for the dynamic nature of verbal conversations. :‚ÄúFirst, in conversation unlike writing, speakers have limited time for planning and revision. They need to overcome this limitation, and in doing so they may exploit techniques possible only in conversational settings. Second, speech is evanescent. The listener has to attend to, hear, and try to understand an utterance at virtually the same time it is being issued. That requires a type of process synchronization not found in reading. And third, listeners in conversations aren‚Äôt mute or invisible during an utterance. Speakers may alter what they say midcourse based on what addressees say and do.‚Äù In the same paper, they proposed the Collaborative Model as an alternative. They believed this model was more able to explain the aforementioned features of conversation. They had conducted an experiment to support this theory and also to further determine how the acceptance process worked. The experiment consisted of two participants seated at tables separated by an opaque screen. On the tables in front of each participant were a series of Tangram figures arranged in different orders. One participant, called the director, was tasked with getting the other participant, called the matcher, to accurately match his configuration of figures through conversation alone. This process was to be repeated 5 additional times by the same individuals, playing the same roles. The collaborative model they proposed allowed them to make several predictions about what would happen. They predicted that it would require many more words to establish reference the first time, as the participants would need to use non-standard noun phrases which would make it difficult to determine which figures were being talked about. However, they hypothesized that later references to the same figures would take fewer words and a shorter amount of time, because by this point definite reference would have been mutually established, and also because the subjects would be able to rely on established standard noun phrases. The results of the study confirmed many of their beliefs, and outlined some of the processes of collaborative reference, including establishing the types of noun phrases used in presentation, and their frequency.  Steps in Collaborating Reference  The following actions were observed in participants working towards mutual acceptance of a reference; * Initiating or proposing a reference * Passing judgement on the reference * Refashioning a noun phrase * Accepting the reference  Grounding  Grounding is the final stage in the collaborative process. The concept was proposed by Herbert H. Clark and Susan E. Brennan in 1991.Clark, Herbert H.; Brennan, Susan E. (1991), Resnick, L. B.; Levine, J. M., eds., Perspectives on socially shared cognition, American Psychological Association, It comprises the collection of \\"mutual knowledge, mutual beliefs, and mutual assumptions\\" that is essential for communication between two people. Successful grounding in communication requires parties \\"to coordinate both the content and process\\". The parties engaging in grounding exchange information over what they do or do not understand over the course of a communication and they will continue to clarify concepts until they have agreed on grounding criterion. There are generally two phases in grounding: * Presenting utterance(s) - speaker presents utterance to addressee * Accepting utterance(s) - addressee accepts utterance by providing evidence of understanding  Other supporting studies  Subsequent studies affirmed many of Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs' theories. These included a study by Clark and Michael Schober in 1989Schober, M. F., & Clark, H. H. (1989). Understanding by addressees and overhearers. Cognitive Psychology, 21(2), 211-232. that dealt with overhearers and contrasting how well they understand compared to direct addressees. In the literary model, overhearers would be expected to understand as well as addressees, while in the collaborative model, overhearers would be expected to do worse, since they are not part of the collaborative process and the speaker is not concerned with making sure anyone but the addressee understands. The study conducted by the pair mimicked the Clark/Wilkes-Gibbs study, but included a silent overhearer as part of the process. The speaker and addressee were allowed to converse, while the overhearer attempted to arrange his figures according to what the speaker was saying. In different versions of this study, overhearers had access to a tape recording of the speaker's directions, while in another they simply all sat in the same room. The study found that overhearers had significantly more difficulty than addressees in both experiments, therefore, according to the researchers, lending credence to the collaborative model. Opposing viewpoints  The literary model described above still stands as a directly opposing viewpoint to the collaborative model. Subsequent studies also sought to point out weaknesses in the theory. One study, by Brown and Dell, took issue with the aspect of the theory that suggests that speakers have particular listeners in mind when determining reference. Instead, they suggested, speakers have generic listeners in mind. This egocentric theory proposed that people's estimates of another's knowledge are biased towards their own and that early syntactic choices may be made without regard to the addressees' needs, while beliefs about the addressees knowledge did not affect utterance choices until later on, usually in the form of repairs. Another study, in 2002 by Barr and Keysar,Barr, D. & Keysar, B. (2002). \\"Anchoring and Comprehension in linguistic precedents.\\" Journal of Memory and Language, 46, 391-418 also criticized the particular listener view and partner-specific reference. In the experiment, addresses and speakers established definite references for a series of objects on a wall. Then, another speaker entered, using the same references. The theory was that, if the partner-specific view of establishing reference was correct, the addressee would be slower to identify objects(as measured by eye movement) out of confusion because the reference used had been established with another speaker. They found this not to be the case, in fact, reaction time was similar.  See also  *Collaborative filtering *Discourse *Grounding in communication  References  *Clark, H. H., & Krych, M. A. (2004).

They were inserted into the 1978‚Äì1979 edition of the official state of Michigan map. The names refer to the slogan of University of Michigan fans (\\"Go Blue!\\") and a reference to their archrivals from Ohio State University (\\"Beat OSU\\").  History  Peter Fletcher, a Michigan alumnus and chairman of the State Highway Commission with a \\"sly sense of humor\\", ordered the inclusion the fake towns of \\"Goblu\\" (near the real town of Bono, Ohio, off State Route 2) and \\"Beatosu\\" (near Archbold, Ohio, just south of Interstate 80/Interstate 90/Ohio Turnpike at exit 25). On the printed map, the fictitious town names appear in all lowercase letters (\\"goblu\\" and \\"beatosu\\"), while every other town name is capitalized. As well, while all real locations are clearly marked, there is no specific dot, boundary line or other marker to identify the precise location of the two fictitious towns. In a 2008 interview, Fletcher explained that a fellow Michigan alumnus had been teasing him about the Mackinac Bridge colors: green and white, the colors of Michigan State University. Fletcher noted that the bridge colors were in compliance with federal highway regulations, so he had no choice in that matter; he did, however, have more control over the state highway map. Fletcher said that he thus ordered a cartographer to insert the two fictitious towns. In their 2012 obituary of Fletcher, AnnArbor.com noted that the maps containing the fictional cities had a limited print run and have become collectors items. The map's publication has also been noted as a good luck charm for the University of Michigan Wolverines that year; the team beat their arch rivals 14‚Äì3 in the 1978 edition of The Game, which is the greatest North American sports rivalry, according to ESPN.com.  In popular culture  The fictional G.I. Joe comic book character Road Pig is recorded as having been born in Goblu, Michigan. The movie Paper Towns refers to the concept of paper towns.

History and development Popular in Britain, and also used in some export markets, the Dodge 500 was also sometimes badged as a DeSoto or Fargo. The trucks were sold as a cab and chassis and the operators arranged for the purchase of the bodies or trailers. Later this range came to be known as the \\"K\\"-series. The 500 Series was developed in the early 1960s, with styling by Ghia and engineering by Rootes Group in Kew, England. The suspension used leaf springs in front and rear with optional rear auxiliary springs. The truck was diesel powered, with forward control and a tilt cab; it was launched in December 1964. Customers obtained the trucks in primer and painted them. The cabs were noted for their styling, roominess and comfort, visibility of the road, and engine placement with minimal intrusion into the cab. Payload capacities ranged up to for two-axle units, up to for three-axle units, or a gross combined vehicle weight of up to for the tractors. Those desiring lighter capacity trucks were directed to the Dodge 100. With the help of the supplier, a special high tensile steel alloy was developed to lighten the frame.

He is the Chairman of Pierson Capital Group.  Early life  Falcone is the son of Pierre Falcone senior, who created Papa Falcone, a fully integrated operation in the fish industry in Algeria. Born in Algeria, Falcone and his parents moved to France when he was eight years old. His parents moved from Algeria along with other French citizens when the country became independent in 1962. Falcone studied law and economics at the University of Aix-en-Provence from 1973 to 1975. Career  Falcone moved to Brazil in 1977 at the age of 24; he soon started a business in trading agricultural products. He developed a wide portfolio of clients and partners throughout South America in the following years which led him to represent several French and Chinese companies in countries such as Brazil or Mexico. Pierre Falcone on site in Kilamba Falcone moved in 1988 to China, where he later founded and headquartered his company Pierson Capital Asia. He started his Chinese operations with consulting services for leading European companies looking to establish themselves in China. He negotiated the first insurance authorization granted by China to a Western company for French giant AXA as well as the involvement of Aerospatiale in the making of the first Chinese communication satellite. In 1993, Pierre Falcone negotiated financing for the MPLA government of Angola during its civil war against UNITA. This financing was achieved in exchange for the future oil production of Angola for French interests. The subsequent delivery of weapons to support Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos's Angolan government led to a trial known as Angolagate in France. In 2011, the charges against Falcone were dropped by an appeals court after he had served half of his sentence in a French prison. The appeals court acknowledged that Falcone had been officially mandated by the Angolan government to acquire arms as well as food and medicine.Eric Sessel, \\"Pierre Falcone: the man who was wrongly labeled as an arms‚Äô dealer\\", Allvoices.com, 13 June 2012 , May 23, 2011 The company he heads, Pierson Capital Group, invests in hotels, real estate developments, agriculture and agroindustrial projects, oil, gas, and personal authentication systems.

History The Western Maryland Railway, which had a main line from Baltimore to Williamsport, Maryland, made its first expansion into Pennsylvania in 1881. The WM leased a line from the Baltimore and Cumberland Valley Rail Road and the Baltimore & Cumberland Valley Rail Road Extension Company, connecting Edgemont, Maryland to Shippensburg, Pennsylvania. In 1886 the line was connected in Shippensburg to the Harrisburg and Potomac Railroad, which was absorbed into the Reading system in 1891. In 1899 the WM shortened the route between Chambersburg and Hagerstown with the construction of the Altenwald Cutoff. This shortcut between Hagerstown and Quinsonia, Pennsylvania, reduced the steep grade for heavy coal trains, as well as the overall distance on the branch. A portion of the cutoff was double tracked, which also improved the line's efficiency. The remaining line between Quinsonia and Edgemont continued to operate with a lower level of traffic. The section between Waynesboro, Pennsylvania, and Edgemont was removed in the late 1950s. In the late 1920s the Reading built a new connection to the WM at Lurgan.

Intended as an extension of the Newport and Shermans Valley Railroad, it was to begin at that railroad's terminus in New Germantown and run southward along Sherman Creek and Big Spring Run. Around what is now Big Spring State Forest Picnic Area, the line would climb through a series of curves on a 4% grade and pass through a tunnel under Conococheague Mountain named Conococheague Mountain Tunnel to bring it into Burns Valley. It would run down Burns Valley into Path Valley and through the town of Doylesburg, ending at Fannettsburg. An extension through the Concord Narrows was also contemplated, which could have connected to the East Broad Top Railroad and the Tuscarora Valley Railroad. Incorporated on October 24, 1893, grading began almost immediately. The line was graded for , with the anticipation that the N&SV; would be converted from gauge. The grade soon reached Conococheague Mountain, and construction began on both portals of the tunnel. However, the rock formations of the mountain proved much more difficult to excavate than expected, and the tunnel contractor went bankrupt in September 1894 after excavating about at both ends. Most of the remaining grading was completed, but the tunnel proved impractically difficult to complete, and the railroad was given up as a failure in 1895. Part of the grade from New Germantown to Big Spring was later used by the Perry Lumber Company for a gauge logging railroad from 1900 to 1905. Much of the grading is now preserved as hiking trails in Big Spring State Forest Picnic Area and Tuscarora State Forest. The north portal of the tunnel is still visible, but fenced off.

Researched in China, the novel focuses on the so-called Jinan Incident, one of the early armed clashes that would eventually lead to a full-scale war between Japan and China. Setting The incident took place in the spring of 1928 in Jinan, the capital of Shandong province, during a northward advance by Chinese nationalist troops attempting to reunify the country. Possessing considerable commercial and industrial investments in Jinan, and faced with a collapse of its favored warlord in the area, Japan rushed in its own troops, ostensibly to safeguard the Japanese residents of the city. After a tense standoff, Japanese units clashed with their Chinese counterparts. The Japanese army, needing reinforcements, claimed that hundreds of Japanese residents had been massacred by the Chinese troops. Although the dead actually numbered no more than thirteen or fourteen suspected opium smugglers, Japanese newspapers reacted to their deaths with outrage and demanded armed intervention. Japan‚Äôs prime minister dispatched an additional division to the region, and the troops launched an attack against Jinan, killing and wounding thousands of Chinese civilians. Theme Kuroshima's novel depicts a broad array of people, including mercilessly exploited Chinese factory workers, impoverished Japanese residents, and increasingly radicalized Japanese soldiers. Staunchly antimilitarist in tone, the novel was instantly banned, censored again fifteen years later by the US occupation authorities, and not reprinted in full until 1970, four decades after its initial publication. The poet and essayist Shigeji Tsuboi, Kuroshima‚Äôs lifelong friend who was instrumental in publishing the work, has commended its uncompromising anti-imperialism. The novel remains little known even in present-day Japan, despite being a prominent text in the annals of Japanese proletarian literature. Militarized Streets analyzes an exploitative system in action, cautions against an impending imperialist war, and suggests a path to a humane and peaceful world ‚Äî through forging powerful bonds of international solidarity. Although written decades ago, Kuroshima‚Äôs book remains startlingly and tragically timely in a world of nationalist- driven military intervention.

He received a BS and MS degree in Biology from Millersville University of Pennsylvania and a PhD in Preventive Medicine from the College of Medicine at the University of Iowa in 1994. Field is currently an occupational and environmental epidemiologist as well as an internationally recognized expert on the measurement and health effects of radon gas. He started his research career in the aftermath of the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania in 1979. His study describing the occurrence of radioactive iodine in meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) was the only peer-reviewed scientific study documenting radioactive contamination of the wild food chain in the vicinity of Three Mile Island. Subsequent studies examining the deposition of cesium-137 in the white-tailed deer indicated there was not widespread contamination of cesium in the vicinity of Three Mile Island following the Three Mile Island accident. The Iowa Radon Lung Cancer Study, which was overseen by Field, is widely considered the most comprehensive residential radon study ever performed. The study found a 50% increased lung cancer risk at the EPA's radon action level of 4 pCi/L.

It runs from an intersection with NY 156 near the hamlet of Berne to a junction with NY 85 in the hamlet of New Salem. NY 157 is a two-lane, narrow, winding route that runs along an escarpment overlooking the Capital District. The route provides access to John Boyd Thacher State Park and Thompson's Lake State Park. NY 157 was assigned to its current alignment as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. Route description NY 157 at the junction with NY 157A in Thompson's Lake NY 157 begins at an intersection with NY 156 (Berne-Altamont Road) in the town of Berne. The route proceeds southeast along Thompson's Lake Road, a two-lane, rural, asphalt road through Berne and climbing down a hill before reaching an intersection with NY 157A (Warners Lake Road). After NY 157A, the route runs east through Berne, reaching an intersection with Old Stage Road. At this junction, the route turns southward, crossing past more residences and farms and an intersection with the western terminus of County Route 256 (CR 256, named Ketcham Road). At the junction with Singer Road, NY 157 turns southeast once again, crossing past similar surroundings. The direction changes again southward as NY 157 passes the campground for Thompson's Lake State Park. Now running lakeside, the route turns southeast along the southern shore of Thompson's Lake, passing many waterside residences. After leaving the lakeside, NY 157 enters the hamlet of Thompson's Lake, a small community based around the junction of NY 157, NY 157A, (Thacher Park Road) and CR 303 (Beaver Dam Road). At the junction, located to the southeast of Thompson's Lake Rural Cemetery, NY 157A terminates at NY 157, which turns north on Thacher Park Road. CR 303 begins westward on the right-of-way seceded by NY 157\\\\. Now running north, NY 157 leaves the hamlet, running east of the lake.

Making a large bend to the southeast, NY 157 crosses into John Boyd Thacher State Park, passing multiple entrances and parking lots into various park attractions. Through the park, NY 157 makes various directional changes, but maintains a generally southeast progression, crossing into the town of New Scotland within the park grounds. After leaving the park, the route retains the Thacher Park Road moniker, winding southeast through dense wilderness of New Scotland. Turning to the south, NY 157 junctions with the terminus of CR 311 (Beaver Dam Road). After one more bend to the east, the route intersects with NY 85 (New Scotland Road). This junction, located in the hamlet of New Salem, serves as the eastern terminus of NY 157. History In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route 7, an unsigned legislative route extending from Binghamton to Albany via Oneonta, and Schoharie. In western Albany County, Route 7 utilized what is now NY 443 from the Schoharie County line to East Berne, where it turned north to follow Thatcher Park Road (now NY 910J and NY 157A) to Thompson's Lake. From there, it continued eastward on modern NY 157 to its terminus at NY 85, at which point Route 7 continued northeastward on current NY 85 toward Albany. The segment of legislative Route 7 between Thompson's Lake and New Scotland Road was not assigned a posted designation until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York when it became part of the new NY 157, which continued west from Thompson's Lake to NY 146 (now NY 156) southwest of Altamont. NY 157A right NY 157A () is a two-laned loop off of NY 157 in Berne that veers to the south to serve the hamlet of East Berne and nearby Warner Lake.

History  The Ballester‚ÄìMolina was designed to offer the Argentine police and military a cheaper alternative to the Sistema Colt Modelo 1927, itself a licensed copy of the Colt M1911A1, built under the supervision of Colt engineers. Production of the Ballester‚ÄìMolina began in 1938 and ceased in 1953. The Sistema Colt 1927 was manufactured until 1966, outliving its intended successor by more than two decades. The company's history dates back to 1929, when two Spaniard entrepreneurs, Arturo Ballester and Eugenio Molina, established a branch of Hispano-Suiza in Buenos Aires. Years later, HAFDASA hired two engineers, Frenchman Rorice Rigaud and Carlos Ballester‚ÄìMolina, a relative of the founders.

The Ballester‚ÄìMolina is also known as HAFDASA, after the initials of its manufacturer.Fitzsimons, Bernard, general editor. \\"Ballester Molina\\", in Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons and Warfare, Volume 3 (London: Phoebus Publishing, 1977), p.265. Use The Ballester‚ÄìMolina was predominantly used by Argentina's security forces. The Argentine Army adopted it as its standard sidearm in 1938. The Ballester‚ÄìMolina is a short recoil-operated semi-automatic locked breech pistol. The locking system is a near-identical copy of the Model 1911's, with the swinging lock used to unlock the barrel from the slide. The pistol has a two-stage, single action trigger, but unlike that of the 1911 trigger, it pivots rather than slide. The spring housing system is integrated to the pistol frame rather than being a separate part. The hammer is locked by the frame-mounted manual safety, and most notably there is no grip safety. Many examples for sale on the surplus market have seen heavy use but show little internal wear. Some 10,000 to 15,000 were sold to the United Kingdom during World War II. In a September 2007 article in the Argentine gun magazine Magnum, about the British-ordered Ballester‚ÄìMolina pistols, gun writer and collector George E. Arbones' research and collection data seems to indicate the legend British-bought Ballester‚ÄìMolinas being manufactured using steel salvaged from the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee after she was scuttled in the River Plate, across from Buenos Aires is true. Another specialist, Alejandro Gherovici, dismissed the legend saying the steel was likely supplied by the US under Lend-Lease. Arbones' article also details the use of those pistols by the British 8th Army and the SOE, and how he came to have his own British-marked Ballester‚ÄìMolinas. Between 10,000 and 15,000 of all Ballester‚ÄìMolinas were specially manufactured for Britain during World War II. A number of pistols was issued to agents of the SOE, in order to avoid the use of British weapons for undercover operations in occupied Europe and behind enemy lines. British contract Ballester‚ÄìMolinas are identified by serial numbers ranging from 12.000 to 21.000, marked with a \\"B\\" prefix (i.e. B16343). Variants A version of the Ballester‚ÄìMolina chambered for .22 Long Rifle was manufactured for training purposes. This version was identical externally to the standard Ballester‚ÄìMolina, except for slide markings indicating the caliber. However, the .22 caliber version is blowback operated to accommodate the less-powerful rimfire cartridge. This version was produced in much smaller numbers and is much rarer today. The Ballester‚ÄìMolina pistol also came with an extended barrel and a wooden buttstock.https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonasdecarvalho/5508405656/in/set-72157626242408185 Users *EA **FAA **GNA **PFA **PNA     See also *Obreg√≥n pistol References  Notes   Bibliography  Hogg, Ian; Gander, Terry Jane's Guns: Recognition Guide London and New York City: HarperCollins Publishers.

Design The Whitbys were designed as specialist anti-submarine warships, intended to counter fast modern diesel- electric submarines. As such, the design was required to reach a speed of at least , maintaining high speed in rough weather conditions and have a range of at . To meet these requirements, the Type 12s had a new hull form and, unlike the contemporary Type 41 anti-aircraft and Type 61 air direction frigates, were powered by steam turbines. Eastbourne was long overall and at the waterline, with a beam of and a draught of forward and at the propellers. The ships were powered by the new Y-100 machinery in which the ship's boilers and steam turbines were designed as a closely integrated set of machinery to increase efficiency. Two Babcock & Wilcox water-tube boilers fed steam at and to two sets of geared steam turbines which drove two propeller shafts, fitted with large ( diameter) slow-turning propellers. The machinery was rated at , giving a speed of . Crew was about 189 when operated as a leader and 152 as an ordinary ship. A twin 4.5-inch (113 mm) Mark 6 gun mount was fitted forward, with 350 rounds of ammunition carried, with close-in armament of a stabilised STAAG (Stabilised Tachymetric Anti-Aircraft Gun) twin Bofors 40 mm L/60 gun mount aft. The design anti-submarine armament consisted of twelve 21-inch torpedo-tubes (eight fixed and two twin rotating mounts) for Mark 20E Bidder homing anti-submarine torpedoes, backed up by two Limbo anti-submarine mortars fitted aft. The Bidder homing torpedoes proved unsuccessful however, being too slow to catch modern submarines, and the torpedo tubes were soon removed. The ship was fitted with a Type 293Q surface/air search radar on the foremast, with a Type 277 height-finding radar on a short mast forward of the foremast. A Mark 6M fire control system (including a Type 275 radar) for the 4.5 inch guns was mounted above the ship's bridge, while a Type 974 navigation radar was also fitted. The ship's sonar fit consisted of Type 174 search, Type 170 fire control sonar for Limbo and a Type 162 sonar for classifying targets on the sea floor. Construction Eastbourne was laid down at Vickers Armstrongs Newcastle upon Tyne shipyard on 13 January 1951 and was launched on 29 December 1955. The ship was being fitted out when on 20 February 1956 a fire broke out on board, killing three men, while a dockyard ship manager, Richard Joicey, was awarded the George Medal for rescuing four trapped workers. Construction continued at Vickers Armstrongs' Barrow-in-Furness shipyard, and Eastbourne was completed on 9 January 1958. Operational service On commissioning Eastbourne joined the 3rd Training Squadron, based at Londonderry Port, Northern Ireland. Eastbourne carried the flag of Commodore, Fishery Protection Squadron (CFPS) in the first Cod War, off Iceland. The ship paid courtesy visits to its namesake town of Eastbourne on the south coast of England, and to Odense, Denmark, Stockholm, Sweden and Brest, France. Early in her career Eastbourne was the leader of the 4th Frigate Squadron and in 1966 was leader of the Dartmouth Training Squadron.The Navy List, (HMSO, Spring 1966) In 1972, Eastbourne replaced as the 'afloat' training ship for the artificer apprentices at HMS Caledonia. During their 14 weeks aboard ship, the apprentices were trained in general engineering and were examined for their auxiliary machinery certificates. She also took part in the Royal Navy's Fleet Review in celebration of HM the Queen's Silver Jubilee.Official Souvenir Programme, 1977. Silver Jubilee Fleet Review, HMSO  Harbour training ship  In 1976 Eastbourne was dispatched to Iceland to assist in the third Cod War and on 22 May she was damaged in a collision with the ICGV Baldur. During the subsequent repairs in Rosyth in 1977, a hull inspection found that Eastbourne was no longer fit for sea, though her machinery was still in good condition. Her propellers were removed, and 'brake wheels' were fitted as a replacement. This enabled her to be steamed at full power with no forward movement. This enabled the apprentices to assist in operation of her machinery at full power, with the added benefit of churning the dockyard basin water up to improve its aeration. Officers under training from Royal Naval Engineering College Manadon were also able to be trained onboard before their first sea draft. In the 1980s, Eastbourne remained moored at Rosyth Dockyard alongside as harbour training ship for the marine engineering artificer apprentices of Caledonia. Once Caledonia was scheduled to close, both Eastbourne and Duncan were de- stored and paid off for disposal in March 1984. Training of the marine engineering artificer apprentices was transferred to HMS Sultan.

The region is headquartered in Southampton and has smaller offices in Dorchester, Oxford, Reading and Portsmouth. Services Television BBC South's television output (broadcast on BBC One) consists of its flagship regional news service BBC South Today and includes an opt-out service for viewers served by the Oxford transmitter, the current affairs programme Inside Out and a weekly half-hour Sunday Politics show dedicated to the region. The region covers television services for Hampshire, Berkshire, Oxfordshire, most of Dorset and West Sussex and parts of Buckinghamshire and Wiltshire. The television output also produces occasional regional documentaries, the such as Titanic ‚Äì Southampton Remembers and Sea City. The former, broadcast in April 2012, looks at the impact of the disaster on Southampton, where most of the ships staff were recruited while Sea City looks behind the scenes at Southampton Docks and was broadcast in January 2013 with a second series in March 2014. Radio The region is home to local radio stations BBC Radio Oxford, BBC Radio Berkshire and BBC Radio Solent. Radio Solent, BBC Radio Oxford and Radio Berkshire broadcast between 5am and 1am with local programming broadcast between 5am and 7pm on weekdays. The three stations carry networked programming with the two stations in the BBC South East region every evening. The stations also simulcast overnight programming from BBC Radio 5 Live each night after closedown. Digital BBC South produces online articles and video for Hampshire, Isle of Wight, Oxfordshire, Dorset and Berkshire which featured on BBC News Online, as well as producing content for the region's social media accounts. Text-based red button services come from the articles produced for the BBC website. History The BBC's television news operation in Southampton began on 5 January 1961 with the launch of South at Six, presented by Martin Muncaster, who had defected from Southern Television. The programme was later renamed as South Today. In 1967, Bruce Parker joined BBC South and went on to become its longest-serving presenter, anchoring South Today for over 30 years. In 1969, South Today became part of Nationwide, with its own opt-out section of the main programme for local news. In 1984, following the end of the short-lived Nationwide replacement Sixty Minutes, South Today became a standalone programme, competing heavily ever since with the long-defunct Southern Television's news programme Day by Day, TVS's Coast to Coast and the present incumbent ITV News Meridian. The region itself has changed in size and shape on a few occasions. On 16 October 2000, areas served by the Oxford transmitter were transferred from the large former BBC South East region, served by news programme Newsroom South East, and transferred to an opt out of the BBC South region served by South Today. Additionally, following the digital switchover of the Whitehawk Hill transmitter on 7 March 2012, Brighton and Hove transferred to the coverage of BBC South East. Studios BBC South's studio centre at Broadcasting House on Havelock Road, Southampton BBC South's regional broadcasting centre is based in Southampton, with local radio and television studios also in Brighton, Oxford, Portsmouth and Reading. Prior to moving to the current studios in 1991, BBC South was based next to the disused Southampton Terminus railway station at South Western House, a former grand hotel set up to cater for first class passengers using the transatlantic liners from Southampton and latterly used as a military HQ during the planning of the D-day landings. The building was famed for its clear views of Southampton docks, making events such as the departure of the Queen Mary easy to film, as cameras only had to set up on the roof of the building, though the technology used at South Western House was famed for its unreliability, as most of this equipment was second hand and brought in from other BBC buildings. The introduction of colour television in the early 1970s led to a major reconstruction of the building, which had a main studio (used largely for South Today) and a small presentation studio for news bulletins and continuity ‚Äì unusually, the camera for the small studio was situated in the outside corridor and looking into the room. In 1991, BBC South moved into new, purpose-built facilities at Havelock Road in Southampton. The new studios were built on to the side of the hill at the top of the city with the railway tunnel running directly underneath. This slope meant that the new television studios were far larger than the previous ones, as they could take up vast amounts of space on a lower level. The new facilities also included brand new equipment and technology, radio studios for BBC Radio Solent and editing suites. The extra space was because BBC South, at the time, was one of the new regional production centres. Previously production centres had been in the large regions with studio facilities, these being the nations, BBC Midlands, BBC North West and BBC West. However, some smaller production centres were being trialled in the South and the North East. As a result, the new studio was made slightly larger so that it could accommodate a network production. When the BBC decided to reduce regional productions as a cost- cutting measure, the fact that BBC South's studio was not too large meant that it was allowed to remain open, unlike many of the other studios and production centres. The complex has two studios. Studio A, the larger is used for South Today and is audience capable, while Studio B, the smaller is occasionally used by South Today and was originally used for the Oxford opt-out.

The parish includes the hamlets of Foscote, Leigh Delamere, Littleton Drew and Sevington, and part of the hamlet of The Gibb. The Gauze Brook, a small tributary of the Avon, rises near Littleton Drew and flows east across the parish. The M4 motorway was opened in 1971 across the south of the parish, passing close to The Gibb, Foscote, Sevington and Leigh Delamere.  History  The Fosse Way Roman road crosses the parish from north to southwest. The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded settlements of 23 households at Gretelintone, 15 at Sevamentone (Sevington) and 16 at Liteltone (Littleton Drew). The Grittleton estate was bought in 1828 by Joseph Neeld, a London lawyer who had inherited a considerable sum. Over time he replaced the manor house with a much larger building, and built lodges and extensive stables. His philanthropy in the parish included the rebuilding of the near-derelict church at Leigh Delamere and construction of a row of six almshouses nearby; farms were improved and houses were built for estate workers, together with a small private school at Sevington. After Joseph's death in 1856 the estate passed to his brother John. Schools were built at Grittleton in 1858 (closed 1975) and Littleton Drew in 1850 (closed 1926).  Notable buildings  Grittleton House, a large Grade II* listed country house across the road from St Mary's Church, was built between 1832 and 1856 for Joseph Neeld, replacing a 17th-century house. Architects were James Thomson and (later) Henry Clutton. Neeld also built lodges and an extensive stables complex (c. 1835). Between 1951 and 2016 the house was the home of an independent school. In 1848, Joseph Neeld built a small private school for the children of estate workers at Sevington. Thomson was again the architect, and he re-used stonework, including the bell tower, from the Church of St Margaret of Antioch at Leigh Delamere, which had been rebuilt in 1846. The school closed in 1913 but the schoolroom remained largely unchanged; the schoolroom and schoolteacher's house were designated as Grade II* listed in 1988. Since 1991 the schoolroom has been used as a re-enactment centre for primary school children.  Religious sites Church of England All three parish churches within the modern civil parish are Grade II* listed. St Mary's Church, Grittleton Lands in the Grittleton area were owned in Anglo-Saxon times, as recorded by the Domesday Book of 1086. The church of St Mary the Virgin, Grittleton, originates from c. 1200 and the four-bay north arcade survives from that date. The three-stage tower is from the 15th century. Much work was carried out in the 19th century: in 1835-6 the Neeld family added a large pew; in 1836 the south aisle was added by John Pinch the younger; and the church was heavily restored by A.W. Blomfield in 1865-7 at the expense of the Neelds. Work later in the century included re-roofing, replacement of windows and addition of memorials to members of the Neeld family. The tower has six bells, two of them from the late 15th century. Today the church is part of the Bybrook Team Ministry. All Saint's Church, Littleton Drew, was rebuilt (except for its 15th-century central tower) by T.H. Wyatt in 1856. The date of the previous church is uncertain; the font is from the 13th century and an incumbent was recorded in 1318. The three bells in the tower are from the late 15th and early 16th centuries. A medieval stone cross, found in the church in 1848, was restored and erected in the churchyard north of the church. Stained glass in the east window, 1856, is by C. and A. Gibbs. The benefice of Littleton Drew was united with Nettleton in 1960; today the church is part of the Bybrook Team Ministry. St Margaret's Church, Leigh Delamere, was built in 1846 at the expense of Joseph Neeld on the site of a 12th-century church; the architect was James Thompson. The benefices of Leigh Delamere and Grittleton were united in 1924. The church was declared redundant in 1992 and is now in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust.  Non-conformist  Littleton Drew had a Congregational chapel, a single-storey building from the early 19th century. Records exist for 1817‚Äì1910. A Baptist chapel was built at Grittleton c. 1720 and is Grade II* listed. The chapel closed in 1982 and was acquired by the Historic Chapels Trust in 2011. Local government The civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. Leigh Delamere and Littleton Drew were separate civil parishes until 1934; at the 1841 census their populations were 113 and 251. The parishes included the hamlets of Sevington and The Gibb respectively. The parish is represented in parliament by James Gray and on Wiltshire Council by Jane Scott, both Conservatives.  Notable people  Catherine Stepney, novelist, was born here in 1778.Elizabeth Lee, Stepney, Catherine, Lady Stepney (1778‚Äì1845), rev. Rebecca Mills, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Sept 2010 accessed 25 January 2017 Notable rectors include George Bancroft (translator, 16th century); and Thomas Tully (theologian and writer, 1620‚Äì1676).  Amenities  Grittleton has a pub, the Neeld Arms, a 19th-century building with a 17th- century core. The Salutation Inn at The Gibb is immediately outside the parish boundary. Grittleton village hall is a modern building. The small school at Littleton Drew, once used as a village hall, is now a private house.

The Battle of Aachen was part of the Drive to the Siegfried Line. The hill was named after a large crucifix mounted on the top of the hill. The objective of the battle was to gain control of the hill, which was laced with a maze of pillboxes and bunkers, so that the main objective of encircling Aachen could be completed. The hill was held by units of the German 246. Volksgrenadierdivision. Battle The U.S. 18th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division, commanded by Col. George A. Smith Jr., directed its 1st Battalion (commanded by Lt. Col. Henry G. Leonard, Jr.) to take the hill employing special pillbox assault teams equipped with flamethrowers, Bangalore torpedoes, and demolition charges. A battery of tank destroyers and self- propelled guns were to provide supporting direct fire at the pillboxes. As the leading rifle platoon of C Company assaulted the first pillbox, flanking fire from a nearby pillbox gun emplacement took the platoon in crossfire. The pinned-down soldiers also experienced an intense artillery barrage on their exposed positions. Capt. Bobbie E. Brown was the company commander of C Company, a former boxer who had earned a battlefield commission in Normandy. During the onslaught of the nearby pillbox, Capt. Brown grabbed a pole charge and ran under enemy fire and placed the charge in the pillbox, destroying it. He did this twice more to two other pillboxes, each time successfully destroying the pillbox; only on the third one was he wounded by a mortar round. Although he was wounded, he refused medical attention and continued up the hill. After the hill was secure, he went by himself on a reconnaissance mission to locate enemy troops beyond the hill. He deliberately drew the enemy fire to find out where enemy emplacements were. While doing this, he was wounded twice more. The information he discovered about German emplacements allowed his company to repel two German counterattacks. Only after the position was completely secure did he allow treatment for his wounds. For his actions during the Battle of Crucifix Hill, Capt. Brown received the Medal of Honor.Whitlock (2008), pp. 40‚Äì41 Attempted recapture On 12 October, two German infantry regiments attempted to retake Crucifix Hill.

These musical instruments are developed by this company for all levels of musicians, beginners to professionals. It is owned by its major supplier, Angel Industries Co. Ltd of Taiwan, widely acknowledged as the premier manufacturer of woodwind musical instruments.Gemeinhardt Company Director of Marketing Blog The Gemeinhardt Company is headquartered in Elkhart, Indiana, where many of its instruments are still made. Ownership From 1993 to 2011, Gemeinhardt was owned by investment bankers under the corporate name Gemstone Musical Instruments. In June 2011 Gemeinhardt was acquired by Angel Industries Co. Ltd of Taiwan, a manufacturer of instruments and business partner of Gemeinhardt for several years. David Pirtle, president and CEO of Gemeinhardt, says that the acquisition by Angel Industries will allow Gemeinhardt more freedom to make decisions and run production in order to best serve the market. While many musical instrument brands are made overseas, the partnership between Gemeinhardt and Angel Industries is unique. Gemeinhardt manufactures the flute components (headjoint, body, footjoint, keys) in Elkhart, Indiana USA then sends them to Angel Industries to assemble them. They are then returned to Elkhart, Indiana for testing and adjusting in the Gemeinhardt workshop. David Pirtle, president and CEO of Gemeinhardt, asserts that this is because the parts can be made better in the Gemeinhardt workshop in America. This differs from most brands, which have their flute components manufactured overseas. History Kurt Gemeinhardt was brought to the United States from Markneukirchen, Germany, by George Bundy of Selmer USA company, which had recently relocated to Elkhart, Indiana. Working with Philip H. Marcil in the Selmer flute division, they copied the typical Louis Lot metal flute design for its flutes. Founded by Kurt Gemeinhardt, a 4th generation flute-maker in Germany, the Gemeinhardt company was established in 1948, 20 years after Gemeinhardt‚Äôs immigration to the United States. Initially crafting only very fine hand made flutes for professionals, the company expanded in 1952, moving to Elkhart Indiana to produce all levels of silver flutes. Beginner student flutes were developed at this time as well. It was these flutes that eventually became the bread and butter of the corporation as Gemeinhardt‚Äôs reputation for fine beginner flutes became a hallmark of the industry. Kurt's father had studied under Emil Rittershausen, who had been trained by Theobald Boehm, and so the instruments the company produces can trace its lineage back to the creator of the Boehm system.Gemeinhardt History The Gemeinhardt Company is very popular in the music field, although it hasn't always followed the mainstream. In the mid 1970s Albert Cooper modified the placement of toneholes on the flute so that it would match the common tuning of A at 440 Hz. Before this many flutes were still designed with an older A435Hz tone hole placement (scale), despite being designed to play at A440Hz through the use of a shortened headjoint.Albert Cooper Many flute companies recognized this change and therefore his scale and decided to make their flutes in the same way, but the Gemeinhardt Company was slow to modify its design. This in turn makes notes played in the higher register on an old Gemeinhardt flute sharp and the lower register flat, which can cause issues for beginner flutists if they are playing an old Gemeinhardt (pre-21st century), but with practice they can learn to play the flute so that the notes are correct. Otherwise, they may consider buying a newer Gemeinhardt flute. However, the design of Gemeinhardt's flutes have changed often since then and have been updated and redesigned accordingly. In 2014 the Gemeinhardt Company introduced a new line of flutes named the Kurt Gemeinhardt Generation Series at the National Flute Association's annual convention in Chicago.http://www.gemeinhardt.com/news- events/experience-the-revolution-nfa-2014-chicago.html Consisting of entirely American-made conservatory and professional flutes, this line was developed by Tom Lacy and Dave Siekman.http://www.gemeinhardt.com/store/kurt-gemeinhardt- generation.html These flutes utilize the RS2012 Scale invented by famous flutists Trevor Wye, William Bennett, and Eldred Spell. This scale design is claimed to be the most accurate on the market. In 1997, Gemeinhardt acquired the Roy Seaman Piccolo Company.http://www.gemeinhardt.com/ourstory.html In addition to flutes and piccolos, Gemeinhardt also has a line of saxophones and clarinets. Products Flutes The Gemeinhardt company sells its flutes in different categories: Student, Conservatory, Professional, Kurt Gemeinhardt Generation Series (American-made conservatory and professional flutes), Alto flutes, and Bass Flutes.

It serves as a loop route of NY 157 through the towns of Knox and Berne, veering a considerable distance to the south to serve the hamlet of East Berne and indirectly connect NY 157 to NY 443\\\\. NY 157A rejoins NY 157 near the access road to Thompson's Lake State Park, which is along NY 157\\\\. It is a two-lane highway its entire length. NY 157A, like its parent route, was assigned in 1930 to its current routing. Route description Eastbound on NY 157A in Berne between Warner Lake and Thompson Lake NY 157A begins at a rural intersection with NY 157 in the southeastern portion of the town of Knox. Although it is signed as an east‚Äìwest route, it heads generally southwestward at first, following the two- lane Warners Lake Road through a forested yet populated area just south of NY 157\\\\. The homes and forests give way to open fields soon afterward, and the rolling terrain follows NY 157A into the adjacent town of Berne. Here, the number of homes alongside the highway rises as it approaches Warner Lake, a small waterbody northwest of the hamlet of East Berne. It runs along the eastern shore of the lake, serving a continuous line of residences on its way to a junction with Thacher Lake Road at the southeastern corner of the lake. At this point, Warners Lake Road ends and NY 157A turns left to return to the northeast along Thacher Lake Road, creating a near U-turn in the route's alignment. South of the junction, Thacher Lake Road continues to an intersection with NY 443 in nearby East Berne as NY 910J, an unsigned reference route. From Warner Lake, NY 157A proceeds across another stretch of open, undeveloped terrain, passing only a handful of homes before terminating at a junction with NY 157 in the hamlet of Thompson's Lake. The waterbody that gives the community its name is due north of the junction, and Thompson's Lake State Park is a short distance to the northwest along NY 157. History The east half of modern NY 157A was originally designated as part of Route 7, an unsigned legislative route, by the New York State Legislature in 1908. Route 7 entered Berne from the west on what is now NY 443 and followed it to East Berne, from where it continued northeastward to Thompson's Lake on current NY 910J and NY 157A. At Thompson's Lake, the route proceeded northeastward onto modern NY 157 and continued toward Albany. The remainder of what is now NY 157A was state-maintained by 1926. The entirety of NY 157A, including the segment not part of legislative Route 7, was assigned in 1930.

The campaign was created by Mahesh V. and Rajeev Rao, Senior Creative Directors at Ogilvy & Mather, Mumbai. The commercials were directed by Prakash Varma. The dog hails from the United Kingdom and is owned by Vishal and Lisa Bandekar of Goa. Birth of the idea In the year 2003 in India, several telecommunications companies were competing for a share of the rapidly growing mobile phone market. Hutch wanted to convey the message that its service was robust enough to provide coverage in every part of its coverage areas. It hired Ogilvy & Mather, Mumbai to create an advertisement campaign focusing on this theme. Mahesh V. and Rajeev Rao, Senior Creative Directors at the agency, spent a whole night developing the idea.Mitra, Moinak. Top Dog!

HUTCH: You & I in this beautiful world , Business Today, 23 May 2004, retrieved 24 November 2006. That's when they hit upon the theme, \\"Wherever you go, our network follows\\", and the idea for the campaign: a dog that follows a boy in the most unlikely places ‚Äì school, bath, barber shop, etc. \\"Man's best friend was the simplest analogy that could represent unconditional support\\", says Renuka Jaypal, National Business Director of O&M.; The campaign The television ad was the first to be shot, a 60-second sequence in lush green Goa. The role of the boy was played by Jayaram, an eight-year-old who had already starred in four other ads. Cheeka was suggested for the role by an assistant at Nirvana Films, the makers of the ad. The campaign became a hit, and was soon followed by a print version for newspapers. Cheeka earned ‚Çπ150,000 for the campaign, and appeared in Hutch ads, till the merger with Vodafone India, representing the network. She featured with her pink nose, when Hutch changed its signature color from orange to pink.

Padamsee adds, \\"You rarely see pugs in ads because they are ugly. This goes against the grain and that's why it clicks.\\" The campaign was ranked the Top Print Ad of 2003 and among the Top 10 TV Campaigns of 2003 in India by Business Today. The ad is similar to the approach used by Fido Solutions, a major mobile service provider in Canada. It is also similar to the concept of network technicians following the customer in recent Verizon Wireless ads in the US.

Originally native to SE China and adjoining countries, it is now found on all continents except Antarctica. Confederate roses tend to be shrubby or treelike in zones 9 and 10, though it behaves more like a perennial further north. Flowers can be double or single and are in diameter; they open white or pink, and change to deep red by evening. The 'Rubra' variety has red flowers. Single blooming flowers are generally cup-shaped. Bloom season usually lasts from summer through fall. Propagation by cuttings root easiest in early spring, but cuttings can be taken at almost any time. When it does not freeze, the Confederate rose can reach heights of with a woody trunk; however, a much bushier plant high is more typical and provides more flowering. These plants have a very fast growth rate. The Confederate rose was at one time very common in the area of the Confederate States of America, which is how its common name was derived. It grows well in full sun or partial shade, and prefers rich, well-drained soil.William C. Welch: \\"Hardy Hibiscus\\", Texas A&M; University Changing colors of the flower during a day In cultivation in the UK, Hibiscus mutabilis has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Floral color change Floral color change occurs in H. mutabilis when flowers are white in the morning, turning pink during noon and red in the evening of the same day. Under laboratory conditions, the color change of the petals was slower than that of flowers under outdoor conditions. Temperature may be an important factor affecting the rate of colour change as white flowers kept in the refrigerator remain white until they are taken out to warm, whereupon they slowly turn pink. The red flowers remain on plants for several days before they abort. Weight of a single detached flower was when white, when pink and when red. Anthocyanin content of red flowers was three times that of pink flowers and eight times that of white flowers. There was a significant increase in phenolic content with color change. Overall ranking of antioxidant properties of H. mutabilis flowers was red > pink > white. Subramanian and Nair postulated that anthocyanins in pink and red flowers of H. mutabilis are synthesized independently since there is no reduction in phenolic content. However, Lowry suggested that anthocyanins are formed through direct conversion from flavonols as they have structural similarities.

The kingdom includes the districts of Bundibugyo, Kasese and Ntoroko. Rwenzururu is also the name given to the region the kingdom is located in.  Background  Road in Rwenzori region valley. The Rwenzururu region is inhabited by the Konjo and Amba peoples. In the early 20th century, these two tribes were integrated into the Kingdom of Toro as a political maneuver by the British colonialists: the neighboring Bunyoro monarchy was anti-colonialist and the British wished to strengthen the pro-British Toro. The Bakonjo and Baamba initially accepted being arbitrarily made subjects of the Toro monarch with resignation, but asked the Uganda Protectorate to provide them their own district in the 1950s, separate from the Toro District.Prunier, 82 The movement declared that they were not part of the Toro Kingdom on 30 June 1962, three months before national independence.\\"Our History\\", rwenzururu.or.ug (accessed 13 February 2017)  History  After their request was denied by the colonial authorities, the Bakonjo and Baamba launched a low-intensity guerrilla war that continued through independence. The movement carrying out the armed struggle was named \\"Rwenzururu\\". While the movement began to achieve recognition as a separate district, it eventually became a movement to secede and form their own kingdom.Rothchild, 90 The movement declared an independent Kingdom of Rwenzururu on 30 June 1962, three months before national independence, with Isaya Mukirania as king. The violence reached a height in 1963 and 1964, when Toro soldiers massacred many Konjo and Amba people as they sought to control the lower valleys. The Ugandan army intervened against the separatists, doing such significant damage to the Rwenzururu that the movement was suppressed for some time. The movement, however, achieved fame through a local folk epic.Prunier, 82-83. See Kirsten Alnaes, \\"Songs of the Rwenzururu Rebellion,\\" in P. H. Gulliver, ed., Tradition and Transition in East Africa (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1969), 243-272. The Rwenzururu gradually re-established itself in the collapse of the regime of Idi Amin in 1979. As government soldiers retreated in the Uganda-Tanzania War, the Rwenzururu looted the weapons and supplies left behind. Thus well-armed, the Rwenzururu was once again able to pose a serious threat to regional control from 1979 to 1982. In 1982, however, the administration of President Milton Obote negotiated a settlement with the Rwenzururu leaders in which they agreed to abandon the goal of secession in exchange for \\"a degree of local autonomy,\\" the appointment of Bakonjo and Baamba to government administrative posts, and economic benefits such as vehicles and educational scholarships to be distributed by local elders.Forrest, 222 During the negotiations, the government preferred direct talks, as they believed third-party mediation would give legitimacy to the Rwenzururu claim.Rothchild, 91 Amon Bazira had been a key person in the negotiations between the Rwenzururu and Obote government. His insight was that the Rwenzururu was a largely middle class organization that could be placated with commercial prizes. He later approached President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire and President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, who both had grounds for disliking the new Ugandan government led by Yoweri Museveni, for support for new Bakonjo rebellion under an organization called the National Army for the Liberation of Uganda (NALU). Bazira was shot dead in the State House in Nakuru, Kenya in 1993, a probable target of Ugandan agents.Prunier, 83 In 1995, Sudanese agents engineered the merging of the remnants of NALU with the Uganda Muslim Liberation Army and the Baganda monarchist Allied Democratic Movement in order to give these latter organizations a local constituency, creating the Allied Democratic Forces.Prunier, 87  Government recognition  A survey carried out by Makerere University found that 87% of the local population in Rwenzururu favored the creation of a kingdom.\\"Uganda: Welcome Rwenzururu\\", editorial by the New Vision, 31 March 2008 In 2005, President Museveni directed a ministerial committee headed by Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Public Service Henry Kajura to investigate the Rwenzururu claim to a kingdom and issue a report of his findings. The report stated that over 80% of the Bakonjo and Baamba favoured the creation of a kingdom with Charles Mumbere as the Omusinga (king).\\"Cabinet recognises Obusinga Bwa Rwenzururu\\" , Ugee!

For a decade after 1859, until the first Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869, it served a vital role in the transport of emigrants, mail, freight, and passengers between California, Nevada, and Utah. History The route was initially scouted in 1855 by Howard Egan, and used by him to drive livestock between Salt Lake City and California. The trail Egan used led straight through the high mountain ranges that most earlier explorers had worked so hard to avoid. Egan had discovered a series of mountain passes and mountain springs that aligned to allow an almost straight path across the middle of Utah and Nevada. The Schell Creek Range could be crossed at Schellbourne Pass, the Cherry Creek Range at Egan Canyon, the Ruby Mountains at Overland Pass, the Diamond Mountains at another Overland Pass, the Toiyabe Range at Emigrant Pass, and the Desatoya Mountains at Basque Summit (all of these place names came later). Although many smaller ranges and two large deserts also had to be traversed, the reduction in length over the 'standard' California Trail route along the Humboldt River by about made this route about two weeks faster for emigrants getting to (or from) California. After it was developed many California emigrants and returning emigrants used this route. Improvement The Central Route in Utah In 1858, hearing of Egan's Trail, the U.S. Army sent an expedition led by Captain James H. Simpson to survey it for a military road to get supplies to the Army's Camp Floyd in Utah. Simpson came back with a surveyed route that was also about shorter than the 'standard' California Trail route along the Humboldt River. The Army then improved the trail and springs for use by wagons and stagecoaches in 1859 and 1860. When the approaching American Civil War closed the heavily subsidized Butterfield Overland Mail southwestern route to California along the Gila River, George Chorpenning immediately realized the value of this more direct route, and shifted his existing mail and passenger line from the \\"Northern Humboldt Route\\" along the Humboldt River. In 1861 John Butterfield, who since 1858 had been using the Butterfield Overland Mail route through the deserts of the American Southwest, also switched to the Central Route to avoid possible hostilities during the American Civil War. The various stage lines, by traveling day and night and changing their teams at about to intervals, could get light freight, passengers, and mail to or from Missouri River towns to California in about 25‚Äì28 days. Gold and Silver mined in California and Nevada were often part of the cargo going east as the Civil War consumed vast sums of money. Nearly all stage lines were heavily subsidized to carry the mail. After the American Civil War, Wells Fargo & Co. absorbed the Butterfield stage lines and ran stage coaches and freight wagons along the Central Route as well as developing the first agriculture in the Ruby Valley in Nevada to help support their livestock. The Army established Fort Ruby at the southern end of Ruby Valley in Nevada to protect travelers against marauding Indians along the road. The Army abandoned Camp Floyd in 1860 as the soldiers were reassigned back east to fight the Civil War. In 1860, William Russell's Pony Express used this route across Utah and Nevada for part of their fast 10-day mail delivery from St. Joseph, Missouri to Sacramento, California. In 1861, soon after the completion of the First Transcontinental Telegraph, the Pony Express was discontinued as the Transcontinental Telegraph now could provide quicker and cheaper communication from the East to the West. Telegraph Under pressure and subsidizes from the U.S. Congress to establish rapid east-west communication in 1860 Hiram Sibley, the president of the Western Union Company, formed a consortium between Western Union and the telegraph companies in California to construct the First Transcontinental Telegraph. The telegraph line was authorized and subsidized by the U.S. Congress and went from Omaha, Nebraska to Carson City, Nevada. The newly consolidated Overland Telegraph Company of California, which had already built a telegraph line to Carson City, would build the line eastward from Carson City using the newly developed Central Route though Nevada and Utah. At the same time, the Pacific Telegraph Company of Nebraska, formed by Sibley, would construct a line westward from Omaha, Nebraska along the eastern part of the California and Oregon Trails. The lines would meet at a station in Salt Lake City, Utah. The Central Route in Nevada Telegraph lines, insulators (shipped around Cape Horn to California) and telegraph poles for the line were collected in late 1860, and rapid construction proceeded during the second half of 1861. Major problems were encountered in finding telegraph poles on the treeless plains of the Midwest and the nearly treeless deserts of the Great Basin. The telegraph line from Omaha reached Salt Lake City on October 18, 1861, and the line from Carson City to Salt Lake City was completed six days later, on October 24, 1861‚Äîabout a year ahead of predictions. Literary Accounts Several accounts of travel along the Central Route have been published. In July 1859 Horace Greeley made the trip, at a time when Chorpenning was using only the eastern segment (they reconnected with the Humboldt River trail near present-day Beowawe). Greeley published his detailed observations in his 1860 book \\"An Overland Journey from New York to San Francisco\\".Greeley H (1860). An Overland Journey from New York to San Francisco accessed 2 Jan 2011 In October 1860 the English explorer Richard Burton traveled the entire route at a time when the Pony Express was operating. He gave detailed descriptions of each of the way stations in his 1861 book The City of the Saints, Across the Rocky Mountains to California. In the summer of 1861 Samuel Clemens (who only later used the pen name Mark Twain) traveled the route with his brother Orion on their way to Nevada's new territorial capital in Carson City, but provided only sparse descriptions of the road in his 1872 book Roughing It. Obsolescence In 1869 the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed using the more level route along the Humboldt River to the north‚Äîalong much of the original California Trail route. Passengers and freight were now carried faster and cheaper than on the stage and freight lines using the old route. Alongside the railroad a new telegraph line was constructed. It was easier to maintain and supply operators, relay stations, etc. using the railroad; the Central Route was now obsolete for the telegraph as well. The stage and telegraph relay stations were abandoned, and the soldiers at Fort Ruby were transferred north to Fort Halleck to protect the railroad.

In ancient times, Tongjei Maril (Meitei:ÍØáÍØ£ÍØ°ÍØñÍØ© ÍØÉÍØîÍØ§ÍØú)(literally 'tubehole') through Bishnupur was the sole road linking Manipur with the rest of India. Bishnupur was one of the sites of the World War II where fierce fightings between the Allied Forces and the Japanese Forces took place.

Vishnu Temple Vishnu Temple at Bishnupur is a 15th-century temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu. King Kyamba of Manipur along with Chaopha Khe Khomba, the king of Pong, conquered Kyang, a Shan kingdom in the Kabaw Valley of present Myanmar. Jubilant at the victory, an idol of Lord Vishnu was given by the Pong king to King Kyamba. King Kyamba started worshipping the idol at Lumlangdong which then came to be known as Bishnupur i.e. abode of Vishnu. Subsequently, he built a Vishnu Temple of brick at Bishnupur which has now become a protected historical monument under the Ministry of H.R.D (Archeology), Government of India. It is now standing as a symbol of the remains of ancient times. And the statue got by Kyamba from the Pong king is very important since it gives us the idea of the religious beliefs of those days and the very name that it had given. During the rule of Kyamba the worship of Vishnu began in Manipur again. A little image of Lord Vishnu was presented by the King of Pong when he concluded a treaty with the king of Manipur in 1470 AD. Kyamba built a brick temple at Bishnupur and installed the image there. In this way the worship of Lord Vishnu began in Manipur again.

Membership is open to all interested in A Dance to the Music of Time and Powell's other works. Powell was regarded by such writers as Evelyn Waugh and Kingsley Amis as amongst the greatest British novelists of the 20th century, a view supported by present- day critics like A. N. Wilson. He has been called the English equivalent of Marcel Proust. Powell's work remains the object of wide enthusiasm among a growing circle of readers. The Society holds regular meetings in the UK (in the greater London region) and US (in the New York City and Chicago metropolitan areas), and less frequently in Canada, Australia, Sweden and Japan. It publishes a journal, Secret Harmonies and a newsletter, mounts biennial conferences, and hosts an Internet discussion group. Background and aims The Anthony Powell Society was founded in June 2000 by a group of scholars and enthusiasts following Powell's death in March of that year at the age of 94. The Society's aim is to advance for the public benefit, education and interest in his life and works. It is registered as a charity in the UK. The Society emerged from the Anthony Powell Resources website begun in 1994 by Dr Keith Marshall and its associated email discussion list arising from the interest in Powell stimulated by the dramatization of A Dance to the Music of Time on UK Channel 4 TV in autumn 1997 and following his death. The Society's formation was actively welcomed by his late widow, Lady Violet Powell, and continues to receive the support and encouragement of his family and literary executors. Charitable status was granted in April 2003. Currently, the Hon. Secretary of the group is Dr Keith C Marshall; the Chairman is Robin Bynoe; and the President is Lord Gowrie. Exhibitions A centenary exhibition in commemoration of Powell's life and work was held at the Wallace Collection, London, from November 2005 to February 2006. Smaller exhibitions were held during 2005 and 2006 at Eton College; Cambridge University; the Grolier Club in New York City, and Georgetown University in Washington, DC. Website The Society hosts a comprehensive website www.anthonypowell.org providing biographical information on Powell, a full bibliography, resources and reference libraries, plus trivia and FAQs. Reports on the biennial conferences and exhibitions are also included. In addition to the conferences and meetings the Society organises, members around the world have also established regional groups and run local events. Through the email discussion list members have provided assistance with the DeProm translation of the initial volumes of A Dance to the Music of Time into Dutch. Conferences Conferences addressed by prominent authors, critics and scholars are organised every second year. The first in 2001 was held at Powell's public school, Eton College. The second, in 2003, was hosted by Balliol College, Oxford, from which he graduated. The third at the Wallace Collection, London, the home of the painting from which Powell's masterwork derives its name, was held in December 2005 to coincide with a major exhibition to mark the centenary of his birth. The fourth biennial Anthony Powell Conference was held on 8 September 2007 at the University of Bath, UK. The fifth conference was held in September 2009 in Washington, DC.

Cancellation of Port Charles In June 2003, Frons announced the cancellation of the ABC soap opera Port Charles (which was a spinoff of General Hospital) after six years because of low ratings.The Vindicator - Google News Archive Search He quoted that the decision to cancel the show \\"was an extremely difficult decision\\" and that the network was \\"pleased with the creative execution of the show, but the 30 minute format in this time period posed significant financial challenges\\".Daily News - Google News Archive Search since the staff of the program only worked for six months out of the year, the remaining episodes were aired with the cast not taping resolutions to existing storylines. The show's 12:30 p.m. EDT timeslot was returned to ABC's affiliates on October 6, 2003. Shortly after the cancellation was announced, several ABC affiliates, including New York network flagship WABC- TV, reached a deal with Buena Vista Television to carry Millionaire, which had moved from primetime to broadcast syndication one year earlier. As Millionaire's second syndicated season premiered before Port Charles aired its last episode, a few stations did not air the last few weeks of the soap in its normal timeslot.  Cancellation of All My Children and One Life to Live  On April 14, 2011, Frons announced the cancellation of ABC soap operas All My Children and One Life to Live. While he made the announcement in person to the All My Children cast and crew in Los Angeles, the New York-based One Life to Live was tuned in through a video link. All My Children ended its run on the network on September 23, 2011, while One Life to Live concluded on January 13, 2012. As a result of the cancellations, Frons was the subject of widespread criticism. He was labeled as the most hated man among soap opera fans, with online petitions being made for his firing from ABC Daytime. In response to the decision to cancel All My Children and One Life to Live, Frons said: :: \\"You can't cut costs enough to make up for those losses. There comes a point when you can no longer justify the expense. Soap operas are an expensive way to program a network and unless you have General Hospital or The Young and the Restless sized ratings, it's really not a business.\\" One Life to Live eventually surpassed on a consistent basis the ratings of General Hospital starting the week of April 25, 2011 in total number of viewers, and the week of October 24, 2011 in the 18-49 women key demographic. In both cases, One Life to Live remained, from then on, ABC's highest-rated soap opera for the rest of its run. In place of All My Children and One Life to Live, Frons green-lighted two new talk shows, The Chew and The Revolution, respectively. In expressing his rationale for the cancellations, he stated: :: \\"I wanted to do shows that were unusual for daytime. What's happening now is people are looking for information to make their lives better, they're obsessed about what they eat and they‚Äôre obsessed with weight.\\" Actress Susan Lucci stated in her book All My Life that she was misled to believe that the rumors of the cancellation were untrue. According to Lucci, Frons told the cast and crew in December 2009 that in order to save All My Children, it was vital that the show relocate to Los Angeles from New York, with all players taking pay cuts. Many left friends and family and sold or rented their East Coast homes in a downward market, resulting in great economic loss.Lucci, Susan; with Morton, Laura. All My Life, A Memoir, New York: IT Books, HarperCollins Publishers, page 325, 2011. Lucci also mentioned that just before the announcement of the cancellations, Dominick Nuzzi, senior vice president of production for ABC Daytime, congratulated the cast, crew, and production staff of All My Children for doing so well financially, stating that the show's production costs were down 25 percent from the previous year and \\"things [were] going great.\\"Lucci, Susan; with Morton, Laura. All My Life, A Memoir, New York: IT Books, HarperCollins Publishers, page 314, 2011. In addition to the statement from Nuzzi, the show was given a budget to support upcoming storylines, and Lorraine Broderick was given a new multi-year contract as head writer of All My Children.Lucci, Susan; with Morton, Laura. All My Life, A Memoir, New York: IT Books, HarperCollins Publishers, pps 316-318, 2011. Lucci blamed both Frons and former head writer Chuck Pratt for the demise of All My Children, stating: ::\\"Brian Frons has what, for me, is that fatal combination of ignorance and arrogance.\\"Lucci, Susan; with Morton, Laura. All My Life, A Memoir, New York: IT Books, HarperCollins Publishers, page 324, 2011. Departure On December 2, 2011, ABC Disney announced that Frons would be leaving the company effective January 2012.ABC Daytime President Brian Frons Exits, Network Consolidates Daytime & Syndie Development In New Division, Deadline Magazine, December 2, 2011. This announcement came the day after Frons terminated General Hospital executive producer Jill Farren Phelps and demoted head writer Garin Wolf. Frons was replaced by Vicki Dummer, who has been with ABC since 1996. The corporate structure that Frons was running has been dismantled with ABC Daytime going to newly created Times Square Studios headed by Dummer, while SOAPnet was transferred to ABC Family.

A portion of the wall cleaned from stucco belongs to the early 12th century. The Church of the Saviour at Berestovo (, Tserkva Spasa na Berestovi; , Tserkov‚Äô Spasa na Berestove) is a church located immediately north of the Monastery of the Caves in an area known as Berestove. Although it is situated outside the Lavra fortifications, the Saviour Church is part of the Lavra complex and the related World Heritage Site.  Architecture  Berestovo was a suburban residence of Vladimir the Great (who died there in 1015) and some of his descendants, including Vsevolod I and Vladimir II. It was also the site of a monastery, first recorded in 1073. Construction of the present structure is not documented, but most art historians date it to the reign of Vladimir Monomakh (1113‚Äì1125). Indeed, it has structural parallels with the churches of Pereiaslav, especially those built during Monomakh's administration of the town at the turn of the 12th century. Monomakh's court church was larger than most cathedrals built in Kyiv in the 12th century and had three naves, three apses, and probably three domes. The western (narthex) wall survives almost intact, while the other walls are known by way of excavations. The western part of the church was separated from the naos, forming a narthex, flanked by a baptistery on the north and a projecting tower on the south. The tower contained the winding stairs leading to the gallery for the ruling prince, his family, and guests. The foundations of the apses of Monomakh's church. Art historians believe that the Saviour Church introduced some structural innovations into architecture of Kievan Rus. For the first time in Rus, all three entrances had projecting porches with steeply-pitched trefoil roofs. This novel feature may be interpreted as key to the overall concept of the church. Monomakh's architects apparently wished to emphasize verticality of the church, a basically Gothic formula which would be fully developed in Smolensk and Polotsk. If the Berestovo church was indeed the first germ of this new manner, its vaulting may have been unusually complicated, probably echoing the trefoil roofing of the porches. The outside of the church formerly displayed intricate brick patterns: double and treble niches, the meander, and decorative crosses. For the first time in Kyiv, no limestone was used in the construction, once again foreshadowing the practices of the mid-12th century.  History  Following Monomakh's death, the church was long associated with his family. At least three Monomachids were buried underneath the baptistery: George I of Kiev (the founder of Moscow), his son Gleb and his daughter Eufemia. The church was damaged in 1240 when Batu Khan sacked Kyiv and again in 1482, when Khan Me√±li I Giray ravaged the neighbourhood. Its walls collapsed and it stood in ruins until the 17th century. Interior view of the church seen with its bright frescos. It was the Metropolitan Petro Mohyla who started to restore the Kyivan churches, long neglected during the Polish-Lithuanian rule. He had the Berestovo church restored in the national Ukrainian (\\"proto-Baroque\\") style. The new church was under construction in 1640-1642. Incorporating the western wall of Monomakh's structure, Mohyla's church is smaller and differs considerably from its predecessor: there are five towers arranged on a four-petaled plan and surrounded by five massive pear-shaped domes. Two years later, a team of Greek masters painted the interior with frescoes. The most famous of these, known as Petro Mohyla's Gift, features a portrait of Mohyla kneeling before Christ to whom he presents a model of the church. The interior was renovated in 1751‚Äì1752 and again in 1813‚Äì1814, when Fedor M. Korobka carved an elaborate altar. At the same time, a two-tier belltower was constructed to Andriy Melenskyi's provincial Neoclassical design which is out of keeping with the rest of the church. In 1909, Academician Pokryshkin (who specialized in ancient Orthodox architecture) was called upon to restore the church to its medieval appearance. Pokryshkin's restoration works lasted for five years but did not result in any fundamental changes. The foundations of Monomakh's original church were uncovered and may still be seen to the east from the extant structure. The fa√ßade of the church was cleaned so as to highlight the surviving parts of the 12th-century building, which had been scraped of stucco. On 7 September 1947, in the course of the celebration of the 800th anniversary of the foundation of Moscow, in the former Vladimir chapel of the church, a large granite sarcophagus was installed by architect P.Ostapenko over the place where it is believed Yuri Dolgoruky, the founder of Moscow, had been buried. In the early 1970s, a fragment of the 12th-century fresco Miraculous Fishing, depicting Christ walking on water towards a boat, was uncovered in the church. Since Ukraine's independence after the fall of the Soviet Union, the church is part of the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra Historical- Cultural Preserve and functions primarily as a museum, holding weekly church services on Sundays.

Simpson, 1857. James H. Simpson, circa 1878. James Hervey Simpson (1813‚Äì1883) was an officer in the U.S. Army and a member of the United States Corps of Topographical Engineers. Early years He was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey on March 9, 1813, the son of John Simpson and Mary Brunson. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1832 and was initially assigned to the 3rd U.S. Artillery. He served in the Second Seminole War and was promoted to first lieutenant in 1837. Topographical Engineers In 1838, a separate department known as the U.S. Army's Topographical Engineers was created (not to be confused with the Corps of Engineers with whom they were merged during the Civil War). Simpson was one of the officers transferred to the newly created bureau and assigned as an assistant to Cpt. W. G. Williams who was in charge of harbor construction on Lake Erie. The following year, he worked on road construction in Florida and then lake surveys in Wisconsin and Ohio. From 1845 to 1847, he was in charge of the harbor of Erie. New Mexico Expedition, 1849 In 1849, Simpson surveyed areas in the American Southwest, between Santa Fe and the Navajo tribal lands. He had recruited wilderness artists Edward and Richard Kern to record the expedition in watercolors, oils, drawings and maps. He surveyed a road from Fort Smith, Arkansas to Sante Fe, New Mexico and then served for a year as the Chief Topographical Engineer for the Department of New Mexico. Other Duties After six months sick leave, Simpson returned to duty and was transferred to St. Paul, Minnesota in 1851 where he spent the next five years overseeing the roads of the territory. During this period, he was promoted to captain. From June 1856 to February 1858, Simpson was engaged in coastal survey of Florida. Utah Expedition, 1858‚Äì59 Crossing the Great Salt Lake Desert, 1859 Genoa near Lake Tahoe in 1859 In early 1858, Simpson was ordered to join the Army's reinforcements for the Utah War. He and his team resurveyed the trails from Fort Leavenworth to Utah and his photographer, Samuel C. Mills, produced the earliest surviving photographs of features along the trail. Upon his arrival at Camp Floyd, he was directed to open a new road between that post and Fort Bridger. Simpson and his team also surveyed the military reservation at Fort Bridger, at Camp Floyd and in the Rush Valley. In May 1859, he headed an expedition to survey a new route from Camp Floyd (south of Salt Lake City) across the Great Salt Lake Desert of Utah and through the Great Basin to Genoa, Nevada near California. The Army contracted Frederick Lander to immediately to develop the more direct route to California for use by wagons, and Simpson's survey was later published in 1876. Simpson's Central Route played a vital role in the transportation of mail, freight, and passengers between the established eastern states and California, especially when hostilities of the Civil War closed the Butterfield Overland Mail stagecoach route that ran along the southern border states. George Chorpenning immediately switched to Simpson's route to run his existing mail and stage line, and the Pony Express used it as well. In 1861 the Transcontinental Telegraph was laid along the route, making the Pony Express obsolete. Afterwards, Wells Fargo & Co. hauled mail, freight, and passengers along Simpson's route until 1869, when transportation and telegraphy were switched to the newly completed Transcontinental Railroad. Civil War During the American Civil War, Simpson served as colonel of the 4th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry and was captured at the Battle of Gaines's Mill. He was paroled and returned, but resigned his commission of volunteers on August 24, 1862 to return to his rank of major in the Corps of Topographical Engineers. He was attached to the Department of the Ohio and was in charge of the expansion and improvements of the defenses for Cincinnati, Ohio. For his services during the war, Simpson was brevetted to the rank of brigadier general. Later career Simpson was named chief engineer of the Interior Department. He oversaw the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad, the completion of which made his Central Nevada Route obsolete. In 1880 he retired to St. Paul, Minnesota, and died there on March 2, 1883. The Simpson Park Mountains in central Nevada, a small range in west-central Utah (Simpson Mountains), and Simpson Springs Pony Express Station are all named after him.Van Cott, J.

History  In 1929, Argentine entrepreneurs Arturo Ballester obtained a license to represent the Hispano- Suiza brand in Argentina. At first, vehicles were to be imported and later built domestically. A few years earlier, Ballester and his associate, engineer Eugenio Molina, built a plant for the production of automatic weaponry. To unify production, a 5,000 m2 plant was built with the highest technology available at the time. It was built at 250 Campichuelo in the Caballito neighbourhood ( barrio) of Buenos Aires. Thus Hispano Argentina F√°brica de Autom√≥viles S.A. (HAFDASA) was devoted to the production of Hispano-Suiza vehicles and motors, and also parts and replacements for this and other automotive, truck, and bus marques. At the beginning, they dedicated themselves to manufacturing trucks and tractors for civilian and military use. They also produced diesel and gasoline motors for vehicles and fixed installations, of different power, produced completely in Argentina. The first totally-manufactured in Argentina product was a bus produced at the Caballito factory. The HA buses would be used by several colectivos companies of Buenos Aires for public transport. Nevertheless, the company reached its peak through the powerful imputus by Carlos Ballester Molina, Arturo'son (also Eugenio's nephew), who got a degree in engineering in order to expand the family-owned business.Hispano Argentina, la gran marca nacional on Diario Epoca, 1 Jun 2020 Hispano Argentina started to produce diesel motors, with own patent. The company also produced trucks and buses from the second half of the 1930s. HA also expanded its range of products, manufacturing weapons to provide the Armed and Security Forces. By the beginning of the 1940s HA was the official supplier of the Argentine Army with weapons and vehicles. The Criollo diesel- engine model was a big success. Ballester Molina also committed to built a car with a truck chassis which was readapted with an aluminium body inspired on European models. The company also manufactured some prototypes, powered with the Criollo 6-cilinder engine, nicknamed El Redondo, due to its aerodinamic design. In their final years, they created various automobile prototypes, and started the production of a small microcar just before World War Two interrupted its manufacture.Odin, L.C. World in Motion 1939 - The whole of the year's automobile production. Belvedere Publishing, 2015. ASIN: B00ZLN91ZG. However, the firm passed into history known for its firearms. In addition to the .45 ACP caliber pistol that made it famous, Ballester Molina also produced .22 caliber pistols and rifles in various calibers. Exact figures do not exist, but it is estimated that Hafdasa produced more than 100,000 arms, and between 80,000 and 90,000 .45 caliber pistols. For economic reasons, the firm declared bankruptcy in the early 1950s and closed definitively in 1953.

Bob Bailey starred as private investigator George Valentine; Olan Soule voiced the role in 1954. Don Clark directed the scripts by David Victor and Jackson Gillis. History and description The few earliest episodes were more sitcom than private eye shows, with a studio audience providing scattered laughter. The program then changed into a suspenseful tough guy private eye series. Sponsored by Standard Oil of California, now known as Chevron, the program was broadcast on the West Coast Don Lee network of the Mutual Broadcasting System from October 18, 1946 to September 27, 1954, first on Friday evenings and then on Mondays. In its last season, transcriptions were aired in New York Wednesdays at 9:30 p.m. from January 20, 1954 to January 12, 1955. Clients came to Valentine's office after reading a newspaper that carried his classified ad: > Personal notice: Danger's my stock in trade. If the job's too tough for you > to handle, you've got a job for me. George Valentine. Write full details! The newspaper ad varied from show to show, but always opened with \\"Danger is my stock in trade\\" and closed with \\"Write full details!\\" Characters and actors George Valentine was a professional detective. Valentine's secretary was Claire Brooks, a.k.a. Brooksie (voiced by Frances Robinson, then by Virginia Gregg, and then by Lillian Buyeff). As Valentine made his rounds in search of perpetrators, he occasionally encountered Brooksie's kid brother, Sonny (Eddie Firestone) or elevator man Caleb (Joseph Kearns). Police Lieutenant Riley (Wally Maher) was a more regular guest. For the first few shows, Sonny was George's assistant, given to exclamations such as \\"Jeepers!\\" but he was soon relegated to an occasional character. John Hiestand was the program's announcer. Other personnel The background music was supplied by Eddie Dunstedter, initially with a full orchestra. When television supplanted radio as the country's primary home entertainment, radio budgets got skimpier and skimpier and Dunstedter's orchestra was replaced by an organ(played by Dunstedter), as from January 1949.

He was the father of Abbas I of Egypt (1812-1854) by princess Pembe Qadin. He is buried in Hosh al-Basha, the royal mausoleum of the royal family at the Imam al-Shafi'i, Cairo, Egypt. Life Though not as well known as Muhammad Ali's other son Ibrahim Pasha, Tusun Pasha did nevertheless attain some historical significance in the Ottoman‚ÄìSaudi War, having led in 1811 the successful military campaign of the Egyptian army in the Arabian Peninsula. It was taken up in order to subdue unrest created in that region by Wahabbi forces. It appears from historical records, that as the elder son, Tusun was destined by Muhammad Ali to carry on his legacy. This aspiration however, was not to materialize, as Tusun died in 1816 - possibly of disease - in the village of Birinbal. His brother Ibrahim succeeded him in the role of chief military commander. Legacy Decades later, in 1848, Tusun's son, Abbas I, inherited the role of Wali from his uncle Ibrahim, and served in this position for six years, before being murdered in 1854.

He made both prints and damascened metalwork, although only two surviving examples of the latter are known. Life The Last Supper by Ghisi after Lombard, 1551, copy in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art He was the son of Lodovico Ghisi, a merchant whose family which had lived in Mantua for more than two hundred years. His artistic training is not documented, but he is thought to have learned engraving from Giovanni Battista Scultori. His earliest works are engravings after Giulio Romano, the dominant artistic figure in Mantua at the time. At some time during pontificate of Paul III (1536‚Äì49) Ghisi visited Rome, where four of his prints were published by Antonio Lafreri. His other engravings from the 1540s included a large print, on ten separate plates, of Michelangelo's fresco of the Last Judgement in the Sistine Chapel. In 1549 or 1550 he went to Antwerp, where, between 1550 and 1555, he produced five dated engraving projects for Hieronymous Cock and Volcxken Diericx, the founders of Aux Quatre Vents, the largest print publisher in Northern Europe. The first of these, on two plates, was after Raphael's fresco The School of Athens, in 1550. It was followed by a copy of Lambert Lombard's Last Supper in 1551, Raphael's fresco Disputation of the Holy Sacrament in 1552, Agnolo Bronzino's The Nativity in 1553, and The Judgement of Paris, after Giovanni Battista Bertani in 1555. In 1551 Ghisi joined the Antwerp Guild of St. Luke as a copperplate engraver, which was the same year the painters Ambrosius Bosschaert and Peter Breughel the Elder joined.Page 174-175 of the Liggeren One of only two surviving pieces of damascened armour known to have been engraved by him is also from this period, the Ghisi Shield, signed and dated 1554. His movements between his employment with Cock and his return to Mantua in the late 1560s remain obscure; his engravings from this time were not commissioned by major publishers, although many seem to have been published in France, and Ghisi is known to have been in Paris in 1562. In the last few years of his life he was employed as keeper of jewels and precious metals, and overseer of the wardrobe, to the ruling family of Mantua, the Gonzagas. An inventory book, in Ghisi's own hand has entries dated between 15 December 1577 and 3 December 1582. The book includes some sketches of jewels, Ghisi's only known drawings. He died on 15 December 1582, aged 62. He was survived by his wife, but left no children. His brother Teodoro was a painter, and at least two of Ghisi's engravings are based on his designs. Many older sources, misinterpreting a passage in Giorgio Vasaris's Lives of the Artists, mistakenly identify Giovanni Battista Scultori as his father, and Scultori's children, the engravers Adamo and Diana Scultori as his brother and sister, giving all three the surname \\"Ghisi\\". Prints Ghisi was a reproductive engraver, that is one basing his works on paintings by other artists, although he often elaborated backgrounds with landscapes of his own invention, and added lavish foliage. Despite doing much of his work outside Italy, his models were almost always the works of Italian artists. Ten are after Giulio Romano, and a total of 13 are by two painters working in France: Francesco Primaticcio and Luca Penti.\\". Metalwork The two known pieces of metalwork engraved by Ghisi are the Ghisi Shield, a parade shield, dated 1554, and a damaged sword hilt, dated 1570, and now in the Hungarian National Museum in Budapest. The shield, now part of the Waddesdon Bequest in the British Museum, is made of iron, hammered in relief, damascened with gold and partly plated with silver. It has an intricate design with a scene of battling horseman in the centre, within a frame, around which are four further frames containing allegorical female figures, the frames themselves incorporating minute subjects from the Iliad and ancient mythology, inlaid in gold.

This article refers mainly to those produced by the British during the Great War, 1914‚Äì1918 although other participants made or used them.. For much of the Great War, trench warfare was almost static, giving rise to the need for large scale maps for attack, defence and artillery use. Initially, British trench maps showed the German trench systems in detail, but only the British Front line. Later in the war, more of the British trenches were shown. The only British maps that showed full detail of both sides were the secret editions, usually marked \\"Not to be taken beyond Brigade HQ\\" for fear of their falling into enemy hands. Scale and availability The majority of trench maps were to a scale of 1:10,000 or 1:20,000, although trench maps also frequently appeared on a scale of 1:5,000 (maps printed on a large scale such as 1:5,000, were generally meant for use in assaults). In addition, the British army also printed maps on scales smaller than 1:20,000, such as 1:40,000 and 1:100,000, but these maps seldom showed trenches. Therefore, they do not typically count as \\"trench maps,\\" although by 1918 certain of the 1:40,000 maps did show trenches. As a rule of thumb, the infantry preferred 1:10,000 and the field artillery 1:20,000, with the heavy artillery and staff officers making primary use of the 1:40,000 maps. In the 'Report on Survey on the Western Front 1914-1918', published in 1920, Colonel E.M. Jack wrote \\"The 1:20,000 was the map commonly used by the Artillery, and as trenches could be shown on it in sufficient detail to be of use to the infantry it was the most useful scale of all, and the one that could least easily be dispensed with.\\" Colonel Jack was a key figure in Great War cartography. At the start of the war there were no trench maps--trench warfare did not develop until late 1914, and the British army did not possess in the Summer of 1914 the logistical and technical support that making trench maps would have required. The British Army went to war with maps more suited to a \\"war of movement\\", i.e. small scale maps, of a scale just about adequate for marching. Once the line had become static after the Battle of the Aisne and the Race for the Sea, the need for accurate, detailed maps of the new trench networks became urgent. The earliest trench maps dating from 1915 were often made from enlargements of French and Belgian maps of variable quality. Some re-surveying of the front was carried out when it was found that such enlargements were not sufficiently precise. Precision was paramount to the artillery, especially later in the war when techniques were developed to \\"shoot from the map\\". These first trench maps, used until the Summer of 1915, also suffered from a lack of standardization. In the absence of a single, theatre-wide format for trench maps, some rather idiosyncratic patterns came into being in these early days of trench warfare. For example, on the British 1st Army Front, troops used the notorious maps that the intelligence officer Col. Charteris favored, which actually printed the North on the bottom and the East on the left-hand side of the map! In addition, the inverted Charteris maps lacked an over-printed grid with hash-marks, so that individual targets required individual target reference numbers. The British Army had to fight two of the largest early battles of the war, those of Aubers Ridge and Festubert, using these wholly unsatisfactory maps. Partly in response to the evident deficiencies of such maps, the British Army put into use, starting in July 1915, the \\"Regular Series\\" trench map. These Regular Series maps, printed in Britain, did much to improve the situation (all 1:10,000 scale maps in this series, printed by the Geographical Section of the General Staff, bear the GSGS number 3062; 1:20,000 scale maps of this series bear the GSGS number 2742; maps of this series were almost invariably backed with linen, greatly improving their durability). Even after the Regular Series came into use in the Summer of 1915, however, local editions of maps, of different formats and printed at the front, remained in use, and did so throughout the war. Confusion A map showing German trenches, marked in red, opposite the British Second Army as of September 1917 A trench map consisted of a base map that showed roads, towns, rivers, forests and so on, over-printed with trenches; red for German, blue for British. Early in 1918 these colours were reversed to come into line with French practice, so that red would henceforth refer to British trenches and blue to German ones. To add to the confusion, some trench maps were printed with all the trenches of the same colour. A base map usually had an edition number followed by a letter, so a map marked 6C had an edition 6 base map and the trench over print of edition C. This system was not strictly adhered to, since sometimes, two maps with the same number and letter can be found but with different detail and different dates. On many of the maps, the words \\"Trenches corrected to\\" are followed by either a single date or a separate date for British and German trenches. Trench maps were updated from aerial photographs and intelligence reports although sometimes captured German maps were used as a source of detail. The use of aerial photography in cartography developed to an enormous degree during the Great War. Before 1914, experiments had been made and papers written on the subject but little was available to the Army for actual use. By the end of the war, it was possible to produce accurate photographs and to transcribe detail to accurate maps as well as the assessment of height of the land forms. Printing techniques Most of the maps were printed in England or well behind the lines as the printing presses were not easy to move at short notice should an attack by the Germans be successful. Some small sheets were made nearer the front by other techniques but the regular series trench maps were printed using lithography on large presses by very skilled printers. Some of these maps were printed from zinc plates but many were printed from lithographic limestone plates. An estimated 32 million maps were printed in the Great War but most have been destroyed. Many are in private hands but important collections are available for public viewing at the Imperial War Museum in London and The National Archive (TNA) at Kew. Digital versions are also becoming available as interest in the Great War increases. References LinesMan. 750x GPS compatible digital 1:10,000 scale trench maps available from Great War Digital.

The IRP released their guidance to member countries in September 2009. Exposure to radon in the home and workplace is one of the main risks of ionizing radiation causing tens of thousands of deaths from lung cancer each year globally. In order to reduce this burden it is important that national authorities have methods and tools based on solid scientific evidence and sound public health policy. The public needs to be aware of radon risks and the means to reduce and prevent these. In 1996, WHO published a report containing several conclusions and recommendations covering the scientific understanding of radon risk and the need for countries to take action in the areas of risk management and risk communication. Recent findings from case-control studies on lung cancer and exposure to radon in homes completed in many countries allow for substantial improvement in risk estimates and for further consolidation of knowledge by pooling data from these studies. The consistency of the findings from the latest pooled analyses of case-control studies from Europe and North America as well as China provides a strong argument for an international initiative to reduce indoor radon risks. To fulfill these goals, WHO has developed a program on public health aspects of radon exposure. This project enjoys high priority with WHO's Department of Public Health and Environment. The key elements of the International Radon Project include: *Estimation of the global burden of disease (GBD) associated with exposure to radon, based on the establishment of a global radon database *Provision of guidance on methods for radon measurements and mitigation *Developing evidence-based public health guidance for Member States to formulate policy and advocacy strategy including the establishment of radon action levels *Development of approaches for radon risk communication. To achieve these aims, WHO has formed a network of key partner agencies from some 40 Member States. This network is the basis for the WHO International Radon Project which was launched in 2005. Working groups will collect and analyse information on radon risk, radon policies, radon mitigation and prevention as well as risk communication. The project members meet regularly and work towards achieving the outlined objectives.

Denison (October 1, 1815 ‚Äì February 19, 1900) was a Methodist pastor; the first President of Kansas State University; and a founder of Manhattan, Kansas, having volunteered to go to Kansas Territory with the New England Emigrant Aid Company in 1855 to fight against the extension of slavery. Denison was born in Bernardston, Massachusetts and raised in Colrain, Massachusetts. He graduated from Wesleyan University in 1840, and then served as a Methodist pastor in Massachusetts until 1855.  Founder of a town and college  In 1855, Denison was convinced by his brother-in-law, Isaac Goodnow, that he should move to Kansas Territory to help establish a new town for the New England Emigrant Aid Company. On March 13, 1855, Denison joined a party of Company members leaving Boston, and made his way to Kansas Territory, which was soon to boil over with violence. (See Bleeding Kansas.) Over the next several years Denison was part of a small group that settled and built the abolitionist town of Manhattan, Kansas, at the union of the Kansas River and the Big Blue River in the Flint Hills. By 1857 Denison and Goodnow, along with others, hatched a plan to create a Methodist college in Manhattan. In April 1857, at a meeting of the Methodist Church Conference, a plan for the college was properly inaugurated. The following year, on February 9, 1858, Manhattan's \\"Blue Mont Central College\\" was incorporated by act of the Kansas Territorial Legislature and Territorial Governor James Denver. By 1860, a large building was erected and the school was open and operating, with Denison as President. However, the institution was already struggling financially.  University President  When Kansas was admitted to the United States in 1861, one of the first things the new state Legislature planned to do was to establish a state university. After two years of political wrangling, on February 16, 1863, the state accepted Manhattan's offer to donate the Blue Mont College building and grounds, and established the state's Land-grant university at the site ‚Äì the institution that would become Kansas State University. At the first meeting of the state Board of Regents on July 23, 1863, Denison was hired as the first President of Kansas State Agricultural College. He served in this position for ten years. During his term, Denison managed a number of important accomplishments, including establishing a faculty and acquiring valuable land that would later become the center of the university. Under his direction, the school attracted Benjamin Franklin Mudge as Chair of the geology department; Mudge led his Kansas State students on fossil-collecting expeditions to Western Kansas as part of the Bone Wars. Despite Denison's accomplishments, the state asked for his resignation in 1873. After leaving Kansas State, Denison was hired as President of Baker University, a Methodist school in Baldwin City, Kansas. He held this position from 1874 to 1879, before retiring to work with the Methodist church in the town he helped settle, Manhattan. He died on February 19, 1900, in Manhattan, which had by then grown into a thriving college town of 3,500.  Legacy  * Two buildings have been named Denison Hall on the Kansas State University campus.

The title evokes the 1962 book The Guns of August by Barbara Tuchman about the missteps amongst the great powers and the failed chances to give an opponent a graceful way out, which led to the First World War. The teleplay introduced William Devane as President John F. Kennedy and cast Martin Sheen as United States Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. The script is based on Robert Kennedy's posthumously published 1969 book Thirteen Days: A Memoir of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Production notes The title of the play was influenced by the 1962 book The Guns of August by Barbara W. Tuchman, which describes various events leading to World War I; and, which had been read by President Kennedy shortly before the crisis. In the play, Kennedy compares events in the book to the crisis with the Soviet Union. Staged as a two and a half hour television play, the production eschews physical action and detailed sets and wardrobes, in favor of emphasis on dialogue, emotion, and decision making. It depicts how the world came close to the brink of, and eventually stepped away from global thermonuclear war, highlighting the roles of President John F Kennedy, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, Premier Nikita Khrushchev, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson, and former Secretary of State Dean Acheson in the crisis. The Missiles of October gave the US general public its first look behind the scenes at the inner workings, disagreements, and ultimate consensus of Kennedy's administration to blockade Cuba, rather than attempt to invade to dislodge the just-discovered, only partially completed Soviet nuclear missile emplacements in Cuba. It details US attempts to give the Soviets room to negotiate without appearing to capitulate, and also periodically depicts Khrushchev reporting progress of the events to his Communist Party cohorts. Kennedy's Vice-President Lyndon B. Johnson, who was a member of EXCOMM, and was present at most meetings during the crisis, does not appear in the docudrama. The play was directed by Anthony Page with writing credits given to Stanley R. Greenberg and Robert Kennedy. Cast * William Devane as John F.

History Otto Lilienthal published his book Der Vogelflug als Grundlage der Fliegekunst (Birdflight as the Basis of Aviation) in 1889. This described the basics of modern aerodynamics and aircraft construction. Lilienthal then made many successful flights starting in 1891. However attention then shifted to powered flight after World War I. Gliding re-emerged as a sport after the war because the building of powered aircraft was restricted in Germany by the Treaty of Versailles. The main originator of the gliding movement was Oskar Ursinus, who in 1920 organised the first contest, known as the Rh√∂n-Contest, on the Wasserkuppe. Thereafter the contest was held annually. Students of technical universities brought gliders which they had developed and built themselves for testing to these contests. An esprit de corps developed known as Rh√∂ngeist. These informal beginnings caused the formation of groups of engineers at universities with the aim of scientific and practical education. The first groups were formed in 1920 in Aachen, Darmstadt and Berlin-Charlottenburg, but others soon followed. Many of the first members had been pilots in the German Air Force. However it was the love of flying rather than militarism or nationalism that motivated them. As a result a fraternal spirit was created that has been maintained to this day. During the Nazi period some Akafliegs escaped regulation for a while through the patronage of the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt f√ºr Luftfahrt (DVL), a forerunner of the present-day German Aerospace Center (DLR), however shortly before World War II the akafliegs were forced to integrate into the NS-Deutsche Studentenbund (Nazi-students- federation). The projects at this time mainly had a military application. Present day After the war, the Akafliegs re-formed in 1951, co-ordinated by Interessengemeinschaft Deutscher Akademischer Fliegergruppen e.V. (Idaflieg). As of 2009 there are ten groups. The aim of the Akafliegs is the development, design and construction of aeroplanes, especially gliders and scientific research into flight. Much of the practical work is done at the summer meetings of the Idaflieg in co-operation with the German Aerospace Center (DLR), while the results of the research are presented at the winter meetings. The Idaflieg also offers many events and courses to its members such as the specification, design and certification of aeroplanes. The quality of additional education provided by the Akafliegs is widely respected and so German glider manufacturers recruit almost exclusively from the Akafliegs. Members have to devote approximately 150 to 300 man-hours annually in order to be able to fly with the Akafliegs. The cost of flying for these members is usually much lower than at other gliding clubs. American Universities have also implemented programs similar to the Akafliegs but based around the American style of teaching, Penn State's AERSP 404H is one example of this implementation. ;Akaflieg Berlin :Technische Universit√§t Berlin - Berlin Technical University ;Akaflieg Braunschweig :Technische Universit√§t Braunschweig - Braunschweig University of Technology Akaflieg Braunschweig SB-5 Danzig ;Akaflieg Darmstadt :Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt - Darmstadt University of Technology ;Akaflieg Dresden :Technische Universit√§t Dresden - Dresden Technical University ;Akaflieg Erlangen :Universit√§t Erlangen-N√ºrnberg - University of Erlangen-Nuremberg ;Akaflieg Hamburg :Technische Universit√§t Hamburg-Harburg - Technical University of Hamburg ;Akaflieg Hannover :Leibniz Universit√§t Hannover - Leibniz University of Hannover ;Akaflieg Karlsruhe :Universit√§t Karlsruhe - Karlsruhe Institute of Technology ;Akaflieg K√∂ln :Universit√§t zu K√∂ln - Cologne University ;Akaflieg M√ºnchen :'Technische Universit√§t M√ºnchen - Technical University of Munich ;Akaflieg Stuttgart :Universit√§t Stuttgart - University of Stuttgart ;Akaflieg Wilhelmshaven :Jade Hochschule - Jade University of Applied Sciences ;Flugwissenschaftliche Vereinigung Aachen (FV Aachen) :Rhein-Westphalia Techische Hochschule Aachen Universit√§t - RWTH Aachen University (Rhein-Westphalia Technical High school) ;Flugwissenschaftliche Arbeitsgemeinschaft Bremen (FWAG Bremen) : ;Flugtechnische Arbeitsgemeinschaft Esslingen (FTAG Esslingen) :Hochschule Esslingen - Esslingen High School There are also academical gliding clubs with other focus than building aircraft, like the Akaflieg Frankfurt which is devoted on research of thermals, mountain wave and flight safety.

Accessory spleens are found in approximately 10 percent of the population and are typically around 1 centimetre in diameter. They may resemble a lymph node or a small spleen. They form either by the result of developmental anomalies or trauma. They are medically significant in that they may result in interpretation errors in diagnostic imaging or continued symptoms after therapeutic splenectomy. Polysplenia is the presence of multiple accessory spleens rather than one normal spleen. Causes and locations Accessory spleens may be formed during embryonic development when some of the cells from the developing spleen are deposited along the path from the midline, where the spleen forms, over to its final location on the left side of the abdomen by the 9th‚Äì11th ribs. The most common locations for accessory spleens are the hilum of the spleen and adjacent to the tail of the pancreas. They may be found anywhere along the splenic vessels, in the gastrosplenic ligament, the splenorenal ligament, the walls of the stomach or intestines, the pancreatic tail, the greater omentum, the mesentery, the renal fossa, or the gonads and their path of descent. The typical size is approximately 1 centimeter, but sizes ranging from a few millimeters up to 2‚Äì3 centimeters are not uncommon. Splenogonadal fusion can result in one or more accessory spleens along a path from the abdomen into the pelvis or scrotum. The developing spleen forms near the urogenital ridge from which the gonads develop. The gonads may pick up some tissue from the spleen, and as they descend through the abdomen during development, they can produce either a continuous or a broken line of deposited splenic tissue. Splenosis is a condition where foci of splenic tissue undergo autotransplantation, most often following physical trauma or splenectomy. Displaced tissue fragments can implant on well vascularized surfaces in the abdominal cavity, or, if the diaphragmatic barrier is broken, the thorax. File:Splenunculus (accessory spleen) photomicrograph.JPG|Histologic section of an accessory spleen File:Nebenmilz.jpg|Ultrasonography of an accessory spleen. Significance Accessory spleens may undergo hypertrophy after splenectomy Very rarely, it may cause bleeding (pictured).Note: The case is possibly splenosis rather than an accessory spleen: If splenectomy is performed for conditions in which blood cells are sequestered in the spleen, failure to remove accessory spleens may result in the failure of the condition to resolve. During medical imaging, accessory spleens may be confused for enlarged lymph nodes or neoplastic growth in the tail of the pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, adrenal glands or gonads.

Her major funder since then has been Cancer Research UK. Darby and her team have demonstrated that there is a linear relationship between the dose of radiation delivered incidentally to the heart during breast cancer radiotherapy and the subsequent risk of ischaemic heart disease, and that the absolute size of the radiation-related risk is bigger for women already at increased risk of heart disease. She and her team have also estimated the absolute size of the benefit of radiotherapy to breast cancer patients and their work is enabling comparison of the likely absolute benefit of radiotherapy with its likely absolute risk for individual patients. Therefore, it is now becoming possible to assess which patients can receive standard radiotherapy, which should be considered for advanced techniques, and which should avoid radiotherapy altogether. Other topics that Darby has worked on include estimating the risk of lung cancer from residential radon, the risk of invasive breast cancer after a diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ, and the risk of cancer after computerised tomography (CT) scans in young people.

Life A grandson of Edmund Calamy the Elder, he was born in the City of London, in the parish of St Mary Aldermanbury. He was sent to various schools, including Merchant Taylors', and in 1688 proceeded to Utrecht University. While there, he declined an offer of a professor's chair in the University of Edinburgh made to him by the principal, William Carstares, who had gone over on purpose to find suitable men for such posts. After his return to England in 1691 he began to study divinity, and on Richard Baxter's advice went to Oxford, where he was much influenced by William Chillingworth. He declined invitations from Andover and Bristol, and accepted one as assistant to Matthew Sylvester at Blackfriars, London (1692).Calamy, \\"An historical Account of my life, with some reflections on the times i have lived in, 1671-1731, ed. J. T. Rutt, 2nd ed.,(1830), 300-1. In June 1694 he was publicly ordained at Samuel Annesley's meeting-house in Little St Helen's, Bishopsgate, and soon afterwards was invited to become assistant to Daniel Williams in Hand Alley, Bishopsgate. In 1702 he was chosen one of the lecturers in Salters' Hall, and in 1703 he succeeded Vincent Alsop as pastor of a large congregation in Tothill Street, Westminster. Calamy was a moderate Presbyterian, following the theology of Baxter. In 1709 Calamy made a tour through Scotland, and had the degree of Doctor of Divinity conferred on him by the universities of Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Glasgow. His friendship with Williams was important for his development as a historian. He was appointed one of the original trustees of the Presbyterian Fund in 1703, and, on the foundation of Dr Williams Charity, was his legacy trustee. This enabled the construction of the Dr Williams's Library in Red Cross Street. He died on 3 June 1732 and was buried on 9 June at St Mary Aldermanbury. He married twice, leaving six of his thirteen children to survive him. His eldest son was Edmund Calamy IV (1698-1755), Presbyterian minister in London. His son (Edmund, the fifth) was a barrister who died in 1816; and this one's son (Edmund, the sixth) died in 1850, his younger brother Michael, the last of the direct Calamy line, surviving till 1876. Works Calamy's forty-one publications are mainly sermons, but his fame rests on his nonconformist biographies. His great hero was Baxter, of whom he wrote three distinct memoirs. His first essay was a table of contents to Baxter's Narrative of his life and times, which was sent to the press in 1696; he made some remarks on the work itself and added to it an index, and, reflecting on the usefulness of the book, he saw the expediency of continuing it, as Baxter's history came no further than the year 1684. Accordingly, he composed an abridgment of it, with an account of many other ministers who were ejected in 1662 after the restoration of Charles II.; their apology, containing the grounds of their nonconformity and practice as to stated and occasional communion with the Church of England; and a continuation of their history until the year 1691. This work was published in 1702. The most important chapter (ix.) is that which gives a detailed account of the ministers ejected in 1662; it was afterwards published as a distinct volume. He afterwards published a moderate defence of Nonconformity, in three tracts, in answer to some tracts of Benjamin Hoadly. In 1713 he published a second edition (2 vols.) of his Abridgment of Baxter's History, in which, among various additions, there is a continuation of the history through the reigns of William and Anne, down to the passing of the Occasional Bill. At the end of volume 1 is subjoined the reformed liturgy, which was drawn up and presented to the bishops in 1661. Volume 2 is an expansion of chapter ix. of the 1702 edition giving greater detail about ministers ejected in 1662. In 1718 he wrote a vindication of his grandfather and several other persons against certain reflections cast upon them by Laurence Echard in his History of England. In 1719 he published The Church and the Dissenters Compar'd as to Persecution, and in 1727 appeared his Continuation of the Account of the ejected ministers and teachers, a volume which is really a series of emendations of the previously published account. * A Defence of Moderate Non- Conformity: In Answer to the Reflections of Mr. Ollyffe and Mr. Hoadly, on the Tenth Chapter of the Abridgment of the Life of the Reverend Mr. Rich.

Construction and design The Leopard-class, or Type 41, frigates were designed for a main role of providing anti-aircraft protection for convoys. As such they were provided with a heavy gun armament but did not require high speed. They shared a common hull and machinery with the (or Type 61) aircraft direction frigates. Leopard was long overall, at the waterline and , with a Beam of and a draught of . Displacement was standard and deep load. She was powered by eight Admiralty Standard Range 1 (ASR1) diesel engines, with a total power of , driving two propeller shafts giving a speed of . Four more of these engines were used to generate electricity, driving 500 kW alternators. The ship had a range of at full power and at . The ship's main gun armament consisted of two twin 4.5 inch (113 mm) Mark 6 dual purpose gun turrets, mounted one forward and one aft, with a STAAG twin stabilised 40mm Bofors mount providing close-in anti- aircraft defence, although this mounting was unreliable and later replaced by a single Bofors gun. A single Squid anti submarine mortar was fitted. As built, Leopard was fitted with a Type 960 long-range radar on the ship's mainmast and Type 293Q surface/air search radar on the foremast. A Mark 6M fire control system (including a Type 275 radar) for the 4.5 inch guns was mounted above the ship's bridge, with a secondary CRBF (Close-Range Blind Fire) director aft, fitted with Type 262 Radar, while the STAAG mount was fitted with its own Type 262 fire control radar. while a Type 974 navigation radar was also fitted. Type 965 long-range air search radar replaced Type 960 during a refit in 1964 and 1966, with Type 993 surface/air search and target indication radar replaced the Type 293Q. The ship's sonar fit consisted of Type 174 search, Type 170 fire control sonar for Squid and a Type 162 sonar for classifying targets on the sea floor.

He is best known for his watercolor paintings of the architectural monuments of the medieval Armenian city of Ani, and for designing the currency and postage stamps of the first Republic of Armenia (1918‚Äì1920). As a result of over 20 years devoted to art, Fetvadjian produced no less than 2,000 works, varying from lucid pencil drawings to painstakingly accurate watercolors, that depicted historically significant churches, monasteries, chapels and palaces. Chookaszian, Levon. \\"’ñ’•’©’æ’°’≥’µ’°’∂, ‘±÷Ä’∑’°’Ø ‘±’¢÷Ä’°’∞’°’¥’´\\" [Fetvatchyan, Arshak Abrahami]. Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia. Yerevan: Armenian Academy of Sciences, 1986, vol. 12, pp. 623-624. A considerable number of his other works were also portraits of Armenians at the turn of the 20th century. Biography Fetvadjian was born in Trebizond in 1866, in the then Ottoman Empire. He attended a national art institute in the city of his birth and continued his studies at the State Fine Arts School (Imperial Academy of Art) in the capital at Constantinople, which had only been recently opened by an Armenian sculptor named Yervand Voskan.Sim, Steven. ARSHAK FETVADJIAN AND ANI. VirtualANI.org. Accessed January 29, 2009. Fetvadjian graduated from the academy in 1887 and pursued higher learning abroad: he left for Rome and was admitted to the San Luca Art Academy, where he was taken under the wing of Italian painter and sculptor Cesare Maccari. Fetvadjian's artistic talents were brought into the public spotlight when he participated in the Italian national art exhibition in 1891. His studies would later take him to Vienna (1891‚Äì1895) and later Saint Petersburg. In Russia, he participated in art exhibitions and joined the Russian Artists' Society. Throughout the early 20th century, he continued to hold exhibitions, and his artwork was seen on displays at the Louvre (1919, 1920) and the Victoria and Albert Museum. Works Watercolors of Ani After Fetvadjian completed his studies in Europe, he traveled to Russian Armenia. He organized several art exhibitions displaying his own works in such major Transcaucasian cities as Batum, Tiflis and Baku. In the early 1900s, Fetvadjian had the opportunity to participate in the excavations led by Russian archaeologist Nicholas Marr of the medieval Armenian capital of Ani, a city which boasted several of the most outstanding examples of Armenian architecture of the High Middle Ages. Some of his most memorable works come from the watercolor paintings of the chapels, palaces, churches and monasteries at Ani which are \\"factual and literal depictions of the buildings.\\" Caucasus Some of the stamps that Fetvadjian designed for the First Republic of Armenia. In addition to the historical monuments of Ani, Fetvadjian's paintings also documented other Armenian cultural monuments of the Caucasus (e.g., \\"Tekor basilica\\" in Kars), the life and the natural landscape of Armenia (e.g., \\"Oriental Mail\\", \\"Mount Aragats,\\" \\"Lake Sevan\\"), and portraits of Armenians and other ethnic peoples. As one of the first artists to depict the Armenian Genocide in art, one of Fetvajian's most famous paintings is the \\"Sasuntsi Kin\\" (\\"The Woman of Sasun\\").Tiftick, Caitlin. \\"Kazan Visiting Professor Levon Chookaszian Gives His Second Lecture On Armenian Art \\". Fresno State University Armenian Studies Program. December 2006, Vol. 28, ‚Ññ 2 (96). Accessed January 29, 2009. The painting shows a woman breastfeeding her child, a rifle in hand, with the child in the painting representing Armenia. Banknotes and stamps 100 ruble note designed for the First Republic of Armenia by Fetvadjian. Following the creation of the First Republic of Armenia in 1918, the members of the country's Finance Ministry commissioned Fetvadjian to draw up the new currency (to replace the Russian ruble) and stamps for the nascent state. The printing was conducted in Europe, and some of Fetvadjian's attractive designs featured animal motifs that were found on the decorations in Ani. But just as the banknotes were being printed in Paris, Soviet Russia was completing its conquest of the republic and by December 1920, the Armenian state was finally absorbed by the Soviets. The banknotes were never put into circulation. Legacy With the fall of the republic, Fetvadjian moved to the United States in 1922 and lived there for the remainder of his years. He continued to paint and was inducted to the art societies of the universities of Harvard, Columbia and Chicago. He died in Medford, Massachusetts in 1947. Although approached by several prestigious American universities to publish his works, Fetvadjian ultimately donated all of his paintings and drawings to the National Gallery of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. Fetvadjian's works were highly valued for preserving a visual memory of Armenian artwork that otherwise might have been lost forever during the turbulent years following the end of the Russian Empire. Armenian historian Vahan Kurkjian gives credence to that belief, stating \\"Many valuable relics of Armenian art and architecture of the sixth to thirteenth century, which had escaped the ravages of time were destroyed during the last incursions of 1917-1921, and would have been eventually forgotten had it not been for Fetvadjian's meticulously exact paintings of them.\\"Kurkjian.

Description Map of the Coosa River headwaters, showing the Coosawattee River The river begins at the confluence of the Ellijay and Cartecay rivers in the city of Ellijay in central Gilmer County. The river flows west through the foothills in the North Georgia mountains region and is a tributary of the Oostanaula River (which it turn is a tributary of the Coosa River). Primary tributaries of the Cooswattee River include Mountaintown Creek, Tails Creek, Cole Creek, Goble Branch, Harris Creek, Camp Branch, Lewis Branch, Woodring Branch, Fisher Creek, Talking Rock Creek, Willbanks Branch, Mineral Springs Branch, Rock Springs Branch, Sugar Branch, Duke Creek, Noblet Creek, Dry Creek, Salacoa Creek, Vanns Creek, and Crane Eater Creek In Murray County, the river is impounded by Carters Dam, forming Carters Lake (which is located mostly in Gilmer County). Completed in 1977, Carters Dam is the tallest earthen dam east of the Mississippi River. The Coosawattee river leaves the dam flowing west (directly into the Reregulation Reservoir) and briefly serves as the Murray- Gordon County line before entering Gordon County. Near New Echota, the Coosawattee meets the Conasauga River, forming the Oostanaula River, a tributary of the Coosa River. This area was the center of Cherokee Nation territory in north Georgia and southeastern Tennessee. In the early 1820s, after having migrated from eastern Tennessee, they made New Echota their capital. In popular culture American writer James Dickey used the Coosawattee River as the basis of his fictional \\"Cahulawassee River\\" in his debut novel, Deliverance (1970). It was adapted as a 1972 feature film of the same name, directed by John Boorman.

His father, Hussain, had been recognised as Sultan of Johore by Britain in 1824. However, Sultan Hussein was regarded as no more than a British puppet, at least during the first few years of his reign. Towards his last years of his reign and during the first half of his son's reign as the Sultan of Johor, limited recognition was given by a few nobles.Aruna Gopinath, Pahang, 1880‚Äì1933: A Political History, pg 23 Bendahara Ali was one of the first few rulers to adjust himself to the new situation and gave Sultan Hussein of Singapore his due recognition... The British were concerned mainly with their own economic and political gains.Winstedt, A History of Johore (1365‚Äì1941), pg 110-1 Succession dispute Sultan Mahmud Shah III died in 1812 after reigning for more than fifty years. He named no heir formally. He left behind two sons by two different women, both of whom were of Bugis extraction. The older son, Hussein Shah stood the better chance of succeeding his father by primogeniture over his younger half-brother, Abdul Rahman.Turnbull, A Short History of Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, pg 97 Hussein Shah, however, was away in Pahang when his father died. The Bugis faction, led by the underking Yamtuan Muda Raja Ja'afar, supported Abdul Rahman as successor and hastily organised a coronation ceremony before Hussein Shah could return. Raja Ja'afar, in exchange for his support for Abdul Rahman (now Sultan), was appointed as Regent and wielded administrative authority.Trocki, Prince of Pirates: The Temenggongs and the Development of Johor and Singapore, 1784‚Äì1885, pg 36 Hussein Shah was in Pahang, waiting for the monsoon winds to arrive, and was unaware of his brother's installation as the Sultan. Raja Ja'afar had written a letter to Hussein Shah, notifying him of Sultan Mahmud's death, but concealed his brother's ascension as the Sultan. Bendahara Tun Ali brought letters to Lingga, reporting Abdul Rahman's coronation during Hussein Shah's stay in Pahang. Hussein Shah sailed from Pahang to Lingga when the monsoon winds arrived, and was received by Sultan Abdul Rahman, who offered to abdicate in his favor. But he quickly backtracked after Raja Ja'afar made threats against Sultan Abdul Rahman.Winstedt, A History of Johore (1365‚Äì1941), pg 77 Hussein Shah remained in exile in the Riau Islands. Questions pertaining to the legitimacy of Sultan Abdul Rahman's reign were raised; the royal regalia were still in the hands of Engku Putri Hamidah, the primary consort of the late Sultan, who had stated her support for Tengku Hussein as successor. In addition, Hussein Shah also had the support of the Temenggongs and Malay nobles, which made the prospect of putting a legitimate successor in place difficult.Trocki, Singapore: Wealth, Power and the Culture of Control, pg 82 Sultan Abdul Rahman devoted himself increasingly to religion; he had delegated all administrative duties to Raja Ja'afar by the time William Farquhar approached the Sultan to secure an alliance with the British in an attempt to reduce Dutch influence in the region.Winstedt, A History of Johore (1365‚Äì1941), pg 90 Founding of modern Singapore 1819 treaty In 1818, Sir Stamford Raffles persuaded the British East India Company to establish a new base in the East Indies. On 29 January 1819, Raffles landed at Singapura, and there he befriended Temenggong Abdul Rahman. Upon learning of these Johor political tensions, Raffles had the Temenggong smuggle Hussein Shah from Riau to Singapura. Raffles then made a deal with Hussein Shah. The British would recognize Hussein Shah as Sultan of Johor, and pay stipends to Hussein Shah and the Temenggong Abdul Rahman. In return, Hussein Shah would allow Raffles to establish a trading post in Singapore. This treaty was signed on 6 February 1819. 1824 Anglo-Dutch treaty With the Temenggong's help, Raffles brought Hussein Shah to Singapore. The Dutch were extremely displeased with Raffles' action. Tensions between the Dutch and British over Singapore persisted until 1824, until they signed the Anglo-Dutch Treaty. Under the terms of that treaty, the Dutch officially withdrew their opposition to the British presence in Singapore. The treaty has the effect of carving the Johor Empire into two spheres of influence; modern Johor under the British and the new Sultanate of Riau under the Dutch. The treaty was concluded in London, between the British and the Dutch, effectively breaking up of the Johor-Riau Empire into two.Winstedt, A History of Johore (1365‚Äì1941), pg 95 Later years and death The British successfully sidelined Dutch political influence by proclaiming Hussein Shah as the Sultan of Johor and Singapore. Hussein Shah's claim to be Sultan of Johor and Singapore was by all accounts not recognised by the Malay rulers and was only a nominal title. Temenggong Abdul Rahman's position, on the other hand, was strengthened as the signing of the treaties detached him the influence of Raja Ja'afar.Ministry of Culture (Publicity Division), Singapore; Ministry of Communications and Information, Singapore., Singapore: A Ministry of Culture Publication, pg 24 The Dutch took the bold initiative of taking the royal regalia from Engku Putri Hamidah by force after hearing of rumors of Sultan Hussein requesting British aid to get hold of it.Winstedt, A History of Johore (1365‚Äì1941), pg 84 In November 1822, Sultan Abdul Rahman was installed as the Sultan of Lingga, complete with the royal regalia.Trocki, Prince of Pirates: The Temenggongs and the Development of Johor and Singapore, 1784‚Äì1885, pg 108 In the later part of his reign, growing British influence induced some Malay nobles, particularly Bendahara Ali, to recognize Sultan Hussein Shah.Tate, The Making of Modern South-East Asia, pg 134 \\"...Timmerman Thyssen, expressing his amazement at a fate which separated father from son, brother from brother, and friend from friend. He also declared that he continued to recognize Sultan Abdul Rahamn of Riau as his overlord, and his seal diplomatically styled him as the representative of the late Sultan Mahmud! In the same year he refused to allow the British flag to be flown in Pahang. Later, as the situation became clearer, Bendahara Ali modified his attitude and apparently accorded his recognition to Sultan Husain as well, and in 1841 Husain's son and heir asked to come to Pahang to be installed as the new sultan by the Bendahara. In 1853 the Bendahara felt sufficiently sure of his position to have himself proclaimed as an independent ruler, although the fiction of Johore's sovereignty was allowed to continue up till 1864.\\" Sultan Abdul Rahman, who had devoted himself to religion, became contented with his political sphere of influence in Lingga, where his family continued to maintain his household under the administrative direction of Raja Ja'afar, Bastin, Winks, Malaysia: Selected Historical Readings, pg 132 Though in 1818 Major Farquhar had signed a treaty with the Underking of Riau by virtue of powers granted him by 'Abdu'r-Rahman Sultan of Johor, Pahang and dependencies, and though in his letter suggesting the Carimons (Karimun) for a port he had again referred to 'Abdu'r-Rahman as emperor, he now conveniently remembered that the potentate had deprecated being called ruler of the Johor empire and had declared that he was Sultan of Lingga only. So aware that under Dutch surveillance neither Sultan 'Abdu'r-Rahman of Lingga nor the Underking at Riau would be able to convey any rights at Singapore to the British... who ruled under the auspices of the Dutch.Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, pg 57 However, unresolved legal ambiguity in the legitimacy various local affairs, such as the status of Johor and Pahang. These were de jure possessions of Sultan Abdul Rahman and his successors, yet the 1824 treaty barred him as a Dutch vassal from exerting political authority over Johor and Pahang.Winstedt, A History of Johore (1365‚Äì1941), pg 112 In the light of these circumstances, the Temenggong and Bendahara increasingly exerted their independent authority. Also, largely as a result of the strong British influence in the Malay Peninsula, the continuously changing political dynamics gradually relegated these legitimacy disputes to irrelevance. (In 1857, the Sultan of Lingga, Sultan Mahmud Muzaffar Shah, who was also de jure head of the royal house of Johor, Pahang and Lingga, made a vociferous claim as the rightful ruler of these states and sparked off a brief civil war in Pahang.)Winstedt, A History of Johore (1365‚Äì1941), pg 116 Sultan Hussein on his part, did not pursue any active claim to his sovereignty rights over Johor, even after Temenggong Abdul Rahman died in 1825, and his successor, Temenggong Ibrahim was still a youth at the time.Winstedt, A History of Johore (1365‚Äì1941), pg 106 Sultan Hussein spent much of his time at his Singapore residence in Istana Kampong Glam until 1834, when he moved to Malacca. Reports cited that he was a dispirited man, apparently with the lack of power and authority that he should be accorded as the Sultan.David Brazil, Street Smart Singapore, pg 231 Sultan Hussein died in September 1835, and was buried in Tranquerah Mosque at the wishes of his Sultanah and Abdul Kadir, a Tamil-Muslim Imam.Reports Service, by American Universities Field Staff, published by American Universities Field Studies, 1965, pg 20 Several of his descendants are buried in Jalan Kubor Cemetery in Singapore.

This park, which was established in 1962, is officially listed by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources as being undeveloped. This means that it is officially a state park but the PA-DCNR is not currently managing the park. However, the lands of the park are open to visitors. Friends of Prompton State Park, a grassroots organization is working to take over management of the park in much the same way that Salt Springs State Park in Susquehanna County is managed by The Friends of Salt Springs Park. Northeast Sports Ltd. of Honesdale sponsors several outdoor sports events that are held at the park. Prompton State Park is west of Honesdale on Pennsylvania Route 170.  History  In May of 1942, heavy rains caused the Lackawaxen River and Dyberry Creek to rise rapidly. The record-breaking flooding in nearby Honesdale and Hawley claimed 29 lives and caused over $7 million damages. Following this flood, plans were made to control future flooding in the Lackawaxen River valley. Congress authorized funding in 1948 for the construction of two dams by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. In nearby Dyberry Township, Jadwin Dam was completed in 1959. In the following year, Prompton Dam was completed, which included a reservoir. The park was opened for public use in 1962.  Recreation  Prompton State Park is open to visitors year-round. Activities available to the visitor include fishing, hiking, boating, picnicking, mountain biking, hunting, ice fishing, geocaching, sledding, cross-country skiing, and snowshoeing. The park closes at dusk, so the park and its lake are for day-use recreational activities only. There are no campgrounds on premise.  Disc Golf  The park also includes an 18-hole dual basket disc golf course. The course has multiple terrains, including moderate hills and lightly wooded areas. The disc golf course is located at the dam entrance at the south end of the park. This is a favorite spot for local celebrity Dave Gorman.  Boating  Small motorboats, up to 10 horsepower, are permitted on the 280-acre lake. Kayaks, canoes, rowboats, and other non-powered water-crafts are permitted on the lake. The boat launch is located on the west shore. It is accessible on route 170 2-miles (3.2 km) from the route 6 intersection.  Fishing and Hunting  Ice fishing on a frozen Prompton Lake. Fishing, including ice-fishing, is permitted in the 290-acre Prompton Lake. Hunting is also permitted in most of the park along with trapping and dog training during hunting season. Both activities require proper licenses.  Trails  There are over 26 miles (41 km) of hiking trails surrounding the lake. All trails are marked with blazes. All hiking trails are also open to mountain biking, snowshoeing, and cross-country skiing. The hiking trails have varying terrains and elevation with varying levels of difficulty. Single-track trail at Prompton State Park On the south end of the park, the parking lot is beside the dam on route 170 near the intersection of route 6. On the north end of the park, a parking lot is accessible off of Beech Grove Road. * East Shore Trail is a 4.5-mile (7.2 km) trail with red blazes It extends the complete length of the lake from Beech Grove Road in the north to the top of the dam at the south. From Beech Grove Road, the trail is paved for the first mile. The paved portion of the trail is the original route 170 from before the dam was built. The remaining road was flooded under the lake. * West Shore Trail is a 3.5-mile (5.6 km) trail with red blazes. This trail also runs the complete length of the lake. It runs from the west starting at the dam in the south to the RV airplane field in the north. * Orchard Trail is a 3.5-mile (5.6 km) trail with white blazes.

The Ma and Pa was popular with railfans in the 1930s and 1940s for its antique equipment and curving, picturesque right-of-way through the hills of rural Maryland and Pennsylvania. Reflecting its origin as the unintended product of the merger of two 19th-century narrow gauge railways, the meandering Ma and Pa line took to connect Baltimore and York, although the two cities are only apart in a straight line. Passenger service was discontinued on August 31, 1954, and the section from Baltimore to Whiteford, Maryland (just south of the Mason-Dixon line demarcating the Pennsylvania-Maryland border) was abandoned in June 1958. Most of the remaining original railroad line was abandoned by 1984. The Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad acquired a former Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) branch line between York and Hanover in the 1980s, now operated by a successor corporation, York Railway. History 19th-century predecessors The Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad was formed from two earlier 19th-century 3 ft (914 mm) narrow gauge railways: the Baltimore & Delta Railway, later the Baltimore and Lehigh Railway, and the York and Peach Bottom Railway, later the York Southern Railroad. Construction of the Baltimore & Delta Railway started in 1881, and passenger trains between Baltimore and Towson, Maryland, began on April 17, 1882. Later that year the company was merged into the Maryland Central Railroad. The line was extended northward to Bel Air, Maryland on June 21, 1883, and the following January, the line was completed to Delta, Pennsylvania. In Pennsylvania, the Peach Bottom Railway was incorporated in 1871. The railway's Middle Division laid narrow gauge track between York and Red Lion by August 1874 and completed its line southward to Delta in 1876. It went bankrupt in 1881 and was reorganized as the York and Peach Bottom Railway (Y&PB;) in 1882. The Y&PB; merged with the Maryland Central Railway (successor to the Maryland Central RR) in 1891, becoming the Baltimore and Lehigh, and the new company operated trains on the combined track between York and Baltimore. Baltimore and Lehigh Railway's Baltimore passenger station in the 1890s, later the Ma and Pa's station until demolished in 1937 Both railroads struggled with light freight traffic and financial difficulties in the 1890s. Because of their narrow gauge construction, the Baltimore and Lehigh Railway and York Southern Railroad could not interchange freight cars with other lines. The two companies finally converted to standard gauge between 1898-1900 and subsequently merged to form the Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad on February 12, 1901. The result was the circuitous, \\"Ma and Pa\\" route between Baltimore and York, compared to the competing Pennsylvania Railroad's more direct distance between the two cities on its Northern Central Railway division. The completed line had grades up to 2.3 percent and 55 sharp curves of (most mainline railroads seldom exceed six degrees, and even the former Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad's mainline through the Rocky Mountains does not exceed 12 degrees). 20th century Ma and Pa depot and freight shed in York, Pennsylvania Former Ma and Pa Station in Red Lion, Pennsylvania Following the merger, the Ma and Pa operated through passenger and freight trains between York and Baltimore, as well as local trains at each end of the line, hauling mail and express, slate, marble, anthracite coal, lumber, furniture, and agricultural products to market. Particularly on the Pennsylvania Division (Delta-York), slate from Delta and manufactured goods from Red Lion and York were mainstays of the railroad's outbound freight traffic in the early years. On the Maryland Division, inbound anthracite coal deliveries accounted for a significant volume of carloadings, along with milk from the many dairy farms in the area. One early morning train from Fallston boarded more than 1,100 gallons of milk daily and was dubbed the \\"Milky Way\\". The line was profitable and traffic volume was such that additional locomotives were necessary. Baldwin 0-6-0 locomotive #30, built in 1913 and owned by the until 1956, was typical of the line's aged equipment. The Ma and Pa acquired two 0-6-0 Baldwin switchers in 1913, #29 and #30 (pictured), called \\"jewels of engines, in some respects the most attractive the road had\\", by writer George Hilton in The Ma & Pa - A History of the Maryland & Pennsylvania Railroad. The next year, three 2-8-0 \\"Consolidations\\" by Baldwin were added to the roster, providing more powerful locomotives for the Baltimore-York through freights. At its peak, the railroad had 16 locomotives and 160 pieces of rolling stock, with 573 employees. Final \\"Ma and Pa\\" passenger timetable, 1954 With increasing competition from trucks and automobiles in the 1920s, passenger volume began to decline along with less-than-carload freight, such as milk from the many dairy farms along the Ma and Pa's pastoral route. The Ma and Pa substituted more economical, self- propelled gas-electric passenger cars for steam-powered passenger trains in 1927-1928\\\\. Carload freight volume increased in the 1920s, however, as more industries located along the line, and earnings were strong enough for the company to declare dividends in 1930 and 1931. The Ma and Pa's relative prosperity ended with the economic downturn during the Great Depression, which cut the railroad's gross revenues by half from 1932 to 1935. In the mid-1930s, the Ma and Pa became an early favorite of railfans, attracted by its hilly, curving line through rural Maryland and Pennsylvania. The railroad offered several popular fan excursions pulled by its elderly steam locomotives. Following the end of World War II, the Ma and Pa acquired four diesel locomotives for more economical operations, but traffic declined significantly. When the Ma and Pa's mail contract was cancelled by the U.S. postal service, the railroad discontinued all passenger service on August 31, 1954. One person on the last passenger train recalled that many riders came from as far away as Boston, Massachusetts, and Washington, D.C., to participate in the historic event, along with members of the National Railway Historical Society. The picturesque line's last steam engine dropped its fire for the final time on November 29, 1956. The last \\"Ma and Pa\\" train departs Towson, Maryland, on June 11, 1958 The lack of traffic on the railroad's Baltimore-Whiteford Maryland Division in the 1950s was particularly acute. One of the last major shipments to occur was Indiana limestone for the construction of Baltimore's Cathedral of Mary Our Queen in 1956. The Baltimore-Whiteford segment in Maryland was finally abandoned altogether on June 11, 1958, leaving only the stone abutments where the tracks crossed York Road in Towson on a steel girder bridge. A local group of history buffs placed a bronze plaque on the west abutment in 1999, commemorating the departed railroad's place in Towson history. In the 1960s, the Ma and Pa Railroad continued to solicit business along its line for its remaining Whiteford-York segment, almost entirely in Pennsylvania. In 1964, it added a siding long near Red Lion to serve a new cigar box factory. In 1971, the Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad was acquired by Emons Industries. Maryland & Pennsylvania F-20 operating in York, Pa.Primarily hauling slate from a quarry at Delta, and furniture from a factory in Red Lion, the Ma and Pa's Pennsylvania Division continued in operation until June 14, 1978, when the line was further reduced to the York-Red Lion section. The Red Lion freight station was closed on November 1, 1980; when the Pennsylvania town's furniture manufacturer shuttered its doors in 1984, the Red Lion section of the railroad was also abandoned. Currently Locomotive #81, an EMD NW2 acquired in 1946, now at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania Maryland & Pennsylvania Coach #20 at the Strasburg Railroad in 2017 The Emons-controlled Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad acquired of a former PRR branch line between York and Hanover, Pennsylvania in the 1980s. In December 1999, Emons merged its M&P; subsidiary with another area short-line, Yorkrail, forming the York Railway. In 2002, Genesee and Wyoming gained control of the York Railway, including the former M&P; Railroad trackage between York-Hanover. The York Railway currently serves 40 online rail customers and connects with the Norfolk Southern and CSX railroads. However the former PRR Frederick Secondary from Stoverstown to Hanover is out of service since the early 2000s a small portion is used to serve a BAE Systems factory in Stoverstown every now and then. The out of service section from Stoverstown to Hanover will be removed sometime in 2021 to become a rail trail. A small, fragment of the original railroad line still exists between Laurel and Muddy Creek Forks in York County, Pennsylvania, maintained by the Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad Preservation Society. Founded by enthusiasts and former employees in 1986, the group has restored the Muddy Creek Forks station and also has a small collection of rolling stock there. The preserved Red Lion, Pennsylvania, station is now a museum operated by the Red Lion Area Historical Society. Other remaining structures along the old right-of-way include scattered bridge abutments and some station buildings, such as the former combination railroad station and general store in the village of Hydes, Maryland. Hydes station Glen Arm station Another Maryland station, at Glen Arm, still stands. Built in 1909, it was designated by the Baltimore County Council on August 5, 2019, as a protected historical landmark. A section of the Ma and Pa's old right-of-way was converted in 1998 to a rail trail in Harford County, Maryland. Now designated the Ma & Pa Heritage Trail, it goes through Bel Air and is used for hiking and biking. In Baltimore, near Pennsylvania Station, Ma and Pa track remnants and the old roundhouse, freight shed, and yard shed are still extant. The Baltimore Streetcar Museum now operates in this area. In York County, the Muddy Creek Bridge, Delta Trestle Bridge, and Scott Creek Bridge-North were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.

Drilling Holdings Inc. knowingly sold products that included US goods to Cuba, violating the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917. Staff allegedly falsified documents stating that they had shipped goods to Barcelona, Venezuela, where they were later sent to Cuba.

It was founded in November 2003 by its editor-in-chief, David Beers, an award-winning writer and former features editor at The Vancouver Sun. Since its launch it has recruited a number of other writers, including Andrew Nikiforuk, Andrew MacLeod, Katie Hyslop, Crawford Kilian, Michael Harris, Colleen Kimmett, Geoff Dembicki, Charles Campbell, Christopher Cheung, Tom Barrett, Sarah Berman, Chris Wood, Ian Gill, Chris Pollon, Steve Burgess, Murray Dobbin, Michael Geist, Terry Glavin, Mark Leiren-Young, Rafe Mair, Will McMartin, Shannon Rupp, Vanessa Richmond and Dorothy Woodend. The name \\"Tyee\\" is based on the current local definition of Tyee salmon‚Äîa Chinook or Spring salmon of 30 lbs or more. The word is derived from the Nuu-chah- nulth language, meaning a chief, a king, or champion.MacLeod, Grant (Fall 2004). \\"The Painter (Tyee) Boat.\\" Carleton University, Material Culture Review 60. Retrieved: 2013-09-21. It also embodies the magazine's dedication to publishing lively, informative news and views, to \\"roam free, and go where we wish\\" as the tyee salmon do. Tyee articles focus on politics, culture and life. It has expanded its activities to a blog: The Hook. In 2009, according to BCBusiness magazine, The Tyee had a growing British Columbia readership, up 77 percent since 2007 to approximately 175,000 unique visitors a month. By 2017, The Tyee was regularly receiving between 800,000 to 1,000,000 page views a month. In 2007, The Tyee was recognized nationally with an Honourable Mention in the category of Excellence in Journalism for Small, Medium, or Local Media. The category includes all Canadian online journalism with fewer than 500,000 unique visitors a month. In 2009, the magazine BCBusiness also placed The Tyee as ninth of their list of the province's ten most innovative companies. The Tyee was awarded the Edward R. Murrow Award by the Radio and Television News Directors Association in 2009 and 2011. It was the only Canadian news organization to be honoured for the national (North America- wide) category in 2011. The Tyee has won the Canadian Journalism Foundation Excellence in Journalism Award twice, in 2009 and 2011. In 2015, The New Yorker magazine called The Tyee \\"a fascinating case study\\" of how local journalism is funded.  History  In 2001, David Beers was fired from the features editor position at The Vancouver Sun as part of Canwest Global's famous purge of top-level journalists. Beers says, \\"When I was fired it was kind of a wake-up call, I was writing some forthright things after 9/11‚Äîthey weren't radical, I didn't think, but they challenged the jingoistic tone of many commentators and politicians in Canada as well as the US.\\" Beers has openly expressed his opinion that CanWest had abused its position and failed to provide fair and balanced coverage. Afterwards, Beers contemplated exploring online journalism, and was encouraged by an anonymous philanthropist who had a similar goal, and finances to support the plan. The U.S. website Salon.com became the model. The Tyee began in November 2003. Its original premise was \\"investigative reporting no one else is doing, and fresh viewpoints from all over B.C.\\" In 2015 David Beers moved to editor-at-large, and founding business director Michelle Hoar moved to an advisory role in 2016. Editor-in-chief Robyn Smith and her maternity leave replacement Barry Link now guide the site, with business director Jeanette Ageson.  Model  According to the Radio and Television News Directors Association, which awards the Edward R. Murrow award, The Tyee is admirable for its independence and its creative commitment to covering its city and region while extending its reach to Canada and beyond. In this style, The Tyee is a Canadian rarity; few other online magazines have the same focus. The Tyee also picks key areas for in- depth investigative or solutions-focused reporting. Being an online magazine, there are fewer chances to introduce the production crew, such as having an editor's letter in every issue. The Tyee has set a goal to \\"open up\\" in order for their readers to gain a better understanding of who they are, and what they are about. The intent is to give the community more opportunities to contribute to The Tyee's daily content. The Tyee has had held several public events in order be less virtual, and more present in the physical world. David Beers explains that, \\"after eight years, it's time we came out from behind our screens and started shaking hands with the thousands of people who visit The Tyee and make us a vibrant community.\\"  Blog  In 2008, The Tyee launched a new blog called The Hook. According to investigative editor and overseer, Monte Paulsen, The Hook was a \\"superblog,\\" because The Hook publishes quick, frequent, timely reports and analysis by experienced Tyee journalists and a wide network of contributors, unlike most blogs that offer works of one or two journalists. Posts were approximately 200-300 words in length, allowing coverage of a greater number and variety of topics that have not been touched upon before. As a business initiative, the blog offered more space for advertising, since online \\"retail space\\" is a challenge for online publishers, unlike print magazines that can simply add advertising-only pages. The blog enabled marketers additional opportunities. The Hook was retired in 2013.  Interactive and multimedia content  Unlike many online magazines, The Tyee has minimal interactive and multi-media content, and is largely based on written story. According to Beers, it is not that The Tyee does not wish to have such features, but are rather limited in people and in-house resources. In terms of visual content, The Tyee runs a lot of photography, and have had immensely positive results with \\"crowd sourced photography.\\" The Tyee flickr pool draws thousands of images, and a new one is featured every day on the site. These images are often run in the stories, and on photo essays by the readers. For example, on Labour Day, The Tyee ran 20 images of people at work taken by The Tyee readers. This approach resulted in a main feature, called \\"The People's Podium\\", on The Tyee everyday during the Olympics. It included approximately a dozen photos taken by readers that were funny, poignant, ironic - images that are supposedly very different from the spectacle- enhancing photos other media were producing. In the fall, The Tyee plans to take this idea forward into video. It will be launching a multi-media window that features videos, and photo slide shows provided or recommended by their readers.  Funding  In 2010, according to Beers, The Tyee's annual revenue of about $500,000 to $600,000 includes $450,000 from ongoing sale of equity, $75,000 from advertising, $50,000 from grants, $25,000 from reader donations, and several thousand from renting out newsroom desks. By 2017, that revenue mix had evolved to 28% ongoing sale of equity, 46% reader funding, and 26% advertising, sponsorships, event ticket sales, and grants for special projects. The Tyee has been a pioneer in reader-funded journalism experiments. Since 2009, the organization has raised close to $1 million from readers. By 2017, over 1,500 readers had signed up as a Tyee Builders, contributing funding to The Tyee on a monthly basis. # Topical pledge drives: #: The Tyee prepares a multiple-choice list of popular topics, and any money donated toward each one would be guaranteed to go to funding that topic. Beers calls this \\"crowdsourcing the editorial board.\\" Just as major donors and foundations influence their grants, small donors can also enjoy the same privilege. For example, Beers provided donors a choice of which issues The Tyee should be covering during Canada's 2009 elections, the pledge brought in $25,000 in 10 days. In 2014, a campaign to ‚Äútake The Tyee national‚Äù raised $118,000 in three weeks. # Interest-group ownership: #: The Tyee is owned by a majority and minority shareholder. The majority shareholder is Working Enterprises, a family of companies affiliated with the British Columbia Federation of Labor that also includes insurance, travel and financial services firms that cater to Canadian union members. In exchange for an annual subsidy of $300,000, Working Enterprises owns two-thirds of The Tyee's theoretically for-profit operation. Investor Eric Peterson is The Tyee‚Äôs minority shareholder. # Renting out desks in the newsroom: #: The Tyee's office is a little bigger than necessary, so they have made three desks available for rental at $250 a month each, wireless Internet, kitchen, and utilities are included. The tenants are, essentially, co-working in a newsroom. Beers sees potential for selling access to newsroom synergies, \\"journalists can be pretty valuable to some people ‚Äî there's a certain rigor and skepticism about what we do.\\" One of The Tyee's desk tenants, Mitchell Anderson, the general manager of a local beachcombers' co-op and an occasional freelance writer, explains that \\"the rent is relatively cheap and it's a nice location, but the main thing I get out of that is a peer group, I really enjoy chatting with bright people about interesting things.\\" In a 2016 Canadaland interview with Jesse Brown, Beers said that \\"special interests\\" always fund media. \\"I can't imagine a media that isn't funded by special interest.\\"  Fellowship Fund  Until 2012, The Tyee had two charitable fellowship funds for independent journalists. The Tyee Fellowship Funds were charitable funds separate from The Tyee. The funds were held at and managed by the national public foundation, Tides Canada Foundation. An independent advisory board, apart from Tides Canada and The Tyee, reviewed all the applications, and chooses four selections. Tides Canada then disbursed fellowship grants from the two funds. Fellowship winners each received $5,000 to produce a series of three or more articles, running at least 1,000 words. Tides Canada owned the reports, and publishing rights that result from the fellows' research, which, as required by Canadian charity law, were intended for broad public education; therefore, the widest possible public dissemination. The Tyee had first publication rights to these reports, and then, on Tides Canada's behalf, responds to requests for republication by others. The author owns the ideas and data gathered during the research and writing of the reports. After the terms of the fellowship grant were fulfilled, and the resulting reports published, the author was free to produce new and different content (articles, books, films, etc.) from that research, and to sell that content to whomever he or she wishes and keep all rights and proceeds. The Tyee Investigative Fellowship funded investigative research and reporting focused on British Columbia, while The Tyee Solutions Fellowship funded research and reporting on promising attempts at solving problems facing British Columbia (BC). This may include an emerging body of knowledge, small scale experiments or broader initiatives with evident, positive results, and may include reporting outside the province if the findings are applicable here. Although reporting related directly to BC, the subject matter is not restricted; example topics include education, the environment, human rights, economics, worker safety, health, addiction, gender and sexuality, poverty, government, consumer ethics, etc. The Tyee retired the Fellowship funds in 2012.  Tyee Solutions Society  The Tyee Solutions Society (TSS) is non- charitable, non-profit, and exists to fund groups of journalists focused on particular subjects: food security, education, youth well being, etc. Directed by Michelle Hoar the TSS is separate from The Tyee, though it is guaranteed an outlet on The Tyee. The journalism it produces is intended to be shared with other media outlets as well, creating PDFs, books, public events, and any other means to engage the public's attention. The TSS has had good luck attracting foundation support for such journalism projects, including series on affordable housing, food security, green building, and, soon to be released in partnership with the CBC, aboriginal education. The TSS model allows employment of journalists who remain focused on one field, rather than having a limited amount of freelance money, and paying small amounts to whoever that wants to write. The foundation support for TSS allows journalists to have a regular pay cheque and develop their expertise.  Long form journalism  David Beers explains that long-form journalism works online for The Tyee when it is definitive. A number of The Tyee's articles are long form, because coverage of the entire story, given the narrative structure, requires it to be so. Each day four features are published that almost always goes beyond a thousand words, often 1,500 words. A 4,000 words piece may be broken into three or four parts, and are consequently published over the course of two or three days. The Tyee strives to make long form journalism digestible on the readers' own terms through a series function. Each story has a yellow button that directs the reader to a page where the entire series it is part of is compiled. This allows the series to be spread around as one URL. The rise of social media is rather supportive to long-form journalism. In assuming that the audience for a long story consists of either people who wish for definitive pieces, or people whose tastes spark their desire to be immersed in a creatively structured piece of storytelling, then the audience is most likely geographically and demographically dispersed yet potentially very passionate regarding such articles (and also the nature of their content). Social media, trusted recommendations through Facebook, Twitter and others, allow people find their desired piece of long-form journalism. The Tyee's Twitter feed has about 47,000 followers, a positive indication that their long pieces are not discouraging those people; it may even be a sign that these followers are long-form journalism appreciators.  Media democracy  Beers has questioned the representativeness of Vancouver media. In a 2005 article and testimony to Parliament titled \\"Creating Counterweights to Big Media,\\" he stated: \\"Vancouver is a heartbreaking place to be a dedicated news reporter, news editor, or news reader, because a single company owns the big papers, the big TV news station, and so many other media properties. There is simply not enough competition to keep that owner honest. By honest I mean dedicated to informing readers, rather than pandering to advertisers or to political allies.\\" Beers sees BC as a sign of current trends in the national media industry, including: consolidation of titles, cross-ownership of mediums, and convergence and homogenization of content. Beers pitches The Tyee as an experiment in changing the media landscape, partly through reader-funded journalism. According to a 2008 article published in the Canadian Journal of Communication (CJC), major media sources in British Columbia at that time, were owned by Canwest, which was known for ties to the federal Conservative party as well as promoting a pro-business agenda.

History Simon Jones, drummer from the band Hope of the States, originally played drums in Youthmovies. However, just prior to Hope of the States being signed to Sony BMG in 2004, Jones was replaced by Graeme Murray. Their early sound touched upon noise, brooding soundscapes, samples, feedback and drone, though their mini-album Hurrah! Another Year, Surely This One Will Be Better Than the Last; The Inexorable March of Progress Will Lead Us All to Happiness and the subsequent single \\"Ores\\" suggested they were moving into a more ambitious and musically accomplished sound.

Those who assume the identity are Native American heroes with mystical powers and a trusted wolf companion named Lobo. Publication history Red Wolf is Marvel's first Native American superhero.Comic Book Nation: The Transformation of Youth Culture in America The William Talltrees version of Red Wolf first appeared in the story \\"The Coming of Red Wolf!\\" published in Avengers #80 (cover-dated Sept. 1970), and was created by Roy Thomas and John Buscema.Multicultural Comics: From Zap to Blue Beetle The character appeared also in the next issue. Shortly afterward, Marvel editor-in-chief Stan Lee began prominently incorporating minorities and female characters into the Marvel lineup. According to Thomas, he and Lee both wanted Marvel to have a book with a Native American hero, but Lee didn't want it to be a modern-day character. \\"I guess he was trying to see if he could find a way to get a Western to sell, because everybody in the field wanted to write or draw a Western,\\" Thomas speculated. For this reason, when Red Wolf was given the starring spot in the first issue of the tryout series Marvel Spotlight (cover-dated November 1971), the character in the Red Wolf identity was 19th Century Johnny Wakely instead of the previously introduced Will Talltrees. Following his successful tryout in Marvel Spotlight, the character became the star of the nine-issue series Red Wolf (May 1972 - Sept. 1973). The stories delved into American Indian culture and were set in the Old West. These adventures featured Johnny Wakely in issues #1-6 and Thomas Thunderhead in #7-9, both Red Wolf predecessors of William Talltrees. The Wakely version appeared in subsequent comic books about the Old West. The Thunderhead version, who lives in the 1970s, was never used again. In 1976, writer Tony Isabella made the Talltrees version and the superheroine Tigra a team in Marvel Chillers #3, 5 and 6. In the issue #7, Jim Shooter wrote a story where the two superheroes fought the Super Skrull. Years later, in the story \\"You Get What You Need!\\" published in The Incredible Hulk vol. 2, #265 (Nov. 1981), writer Bill Mantlo and penciller Sal Buscema created the superhero team the Rangers, consisting of Western characters Bonita Juarez / Firebird, Victoria Starvin / Shooting Star, Drew Daniels / Texas Twister, Hamilton Slade / Phantom Rider, then called Night Rider, and William Talltrees, the contemporary Red Wolf. In Fantastic Four Annual #25 (Oct. 1992), writer Mark Gruenwald and penciller Herb Trimpe created the Anachronauts, Kang the Conqueror's personal guard. Among them, there was Wildrun, the first of the Red Wolves. The character appeared in subsequent comic books featuring the Anachronauts until his last appearance in Avengers Forever #3 (February 1999). The Wakely version of Red Wolf appeared in 2000's Blaze of Glory: The Last Ride of the Western Heroes. John Ostrander, the creator of this comic book series, remade the character as a western vigilante.Native Americans in Comic Books: A Critical Study, p.34-35 In 2006, Red Wolf has an entry in the Marvel Westerns: Outlaw Files (June 2006).Outlaw Files at marvunapp.com The same year, writer Karl Kesel and penciller Carmine Di Giandomenico wrote a story on the Wakely version of Red Wolf in Mighty Marvel Western - Western Legends #1 (September 2006). Johnny Wakely also appeared in 2010's Rawhide Kid: The Sensational Seven. The series includes a mix of actual, real world Western heroes and ones from Marvel continuity.Tuesday Q&A;: Ron Zimmerman In an interview with Comic Book Resources, writer Ron Zimmerman revealed that Red Wolf and his canine companion Lobo would get a bit of a reinvention in the series. He pointed to Red Wolf as his favorite character in the book, next to Rawhide Kid and expressed an interest in writing a spinoff title starring the character. \\"Red Wolf is probably the only one on the team that is the intellectual equal of Rawhide Kid,\\" said the writer. \\"I would liken him a little bit to Hank McCoy. He's incredibly well educated and very articulate. This isn't Tonto. This guy will hopefully read as funny, because he's nothing like any other Native American of that day - other than the fact that he's not crazy about white people. He's a little bit of a racist. But still, he's a hero.\\" In a 2011 interview, writer Jason Aaron revealed that in his original outline of Astonishing Spider-Man & Wolverine, the title characters would have been stranded in the 15th century where Spider-Man would have started the New World Avengers with Sasquatch, Red Wolf and an Aztec Ghost Rider. The following year, writer Chris Yost chose the Texas team the Rangers to come into conflict with Houston's new superhero Scarlet Spider in the story \\"The Second Master\\" in Scarlet Spider #7-9. In 2015, a Red Wolf from an alternate universe of Earth-51920 appears in the series 1872. In this universe, the Marvel heroes lives in a Wild West environment, where Red Wolf became deputy of a town called Timely.\\"Secret Wars\\" Launches Marvel Western \\"1872\\" From Duggan, ShanerPreview: 1872 #1 After Secret Wars, this Red Wolf was placed in the mainstream Marvel Universe and has a difficult time remembering his past life.

Fictional character biography Wildrun Wildrun is the Red Wolf of the 19th century in the Wild West. In order for the Cheyenne to have a place to live, he drove the Sioux away from the plains. Kang the Conqueror is the only man to have defeated him in battle. As a result, Wildrun swore loyalty to Kang and became a member of his personal guard, the Anachronauts. In Avengers Forever, Libra, who somehow knows Wildrun, described him as \\"the first of the Red Wolves.\\"Avengers Forever #3 Johnny Wakely Johnny Wakely was the adopted name of a Cheyenne man who was raised from childhood by a white couple in the late 19th century.Native Americans in Comic Books: A Critical Study, p.29 His adoptive parents were killed by Native Americans in retaliation for the U.S. Army cavalry's massacre of their own people. Some time later, a local land baron tried to buy the Wakely property; when Johnny refused to sell, the land baron's hired guns burned down the house. Trying to find his place in this world, Johnny joined the U.S. Cavalry at Fort Rango as a scout, but although accepted by the commanding officer found himself shunned and despised by the soldiers. While on a scouting mission to find a renegade Indian war party, Johnny's position was accidentally given away. Pursued by the warriors, Wakely stumbled into the burial place of a former warrior known as Red Wolf and was visited by the spirit of a Cheyenne god named Owayodata.

Powers and abilities The wolf spirit Owayodata (a god of the Cheyenne pantheon) granted William Talltrees superhuman strength, and sensory acuity heightened to superhuman levels. He is also a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant, an experienced wrestler, an adept combat gymnast, a superb archer, and an expert marksman with throwing weapons. He is an expert tracker, and a skilled animal trainer. His weapons include a coup stick (a six-foot wooden staff used as a bow or javelin), a tomahawk, a hunting knife, and a bow and arrows. Wildrun displayed no superhuman abilities, but presumably had the same enhanced senses and tracking skills as his successors. His weapons are a bow, dagger and spear. Sometimes, when he was a member of the Anachronauts, he used explosive arrows. Thomas Thunderhead was able to cause his coup stick and his wolf companion Lobo to appear from nowhere, and Lobo also possessed the power of intangibility.

He tried to destroy Roxxon Dam which was blocking a river that led into the native territories and got caught by Turk Barrett and the rest of Mayor Wilson Fisk's men. Upon being tipped off by a boy, Ben Urich informed Sheriff Steve Rogers who intervened and took Red Wolf into custody so that he would stand trial for the crimes that he was accused of. Mayor Fisk objected to this and secretly sent Turk Barrett and his men to the Sheriff Department to dispose of Red Wolf which failed and resulted in Sheriff Rogers and Red Wolf killing Turk Barrett and the rest of Mayor Fisk's men.1872 #1 After hearing what happened during the scuffle between Red Wolf, Sheriff Rogers, and Mayor Fisk's men, Governor Roxxon sent his minions Bullseye, Elektra, Grizzly, and Otto Octavius into intimidating Judge Franklin Nelson into leaving town so that he wouldn't preside over Red Wolf's trial. Sheriff Rogers' friend Natasha Barnes was against his idea of harboring Red Wolf as she claimed that the Cheyenne killed her husband Deputy Bucky Barnes with Sheriff Rogers stating that Mayor Fisk's men framed him. When Bullseye, Elektra, Grizzly, and Otto Octavius arrive in town to help Mayor Fisk do away with Red Wolf, Sheriff Rogers undid his shackles and they fought them which resulted in Sheriff Rogers killing Octavius while Elektra and Grizzly pursued Red Wolf. While Sheriff Rogers saved Red Wolf from Grizzly, Bullseye killed Sheriff Rogers. Natasha Barnes distracted Bullseye in what direction Red Wolf ran while she secretly hid Red Wolf.1872 #2 In retaliation for Sheriff Rogers' death, Natasha Barnes and Red Wolf conspire against Mayor Fisk and receive help from the local apothecary Bruce Banner. As Red Wolf fights against Bullseye, Elektra, and Grizzly, he is aided by the local inventor Tony Stark in battle armor.1872 #3 Mayor Fisk then fights Red Wolf where he managed to subdue Red Wolf. Red Wolf breaks free and points his gun at Mayor Fisk who is then killed by Natasha Barnes resulting in Sheriff Rogers' death being avenged. Following Mayor Fisk's death and the destruction of Roxxon Dam, Governor Roxxon has Carol Danvers sworn in as the new Mayor of Timely with Red Wolf becoming the new sheriff.1872 #4 As part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel, Red Wolf was investigating the death of the Michaels family. He encountered their murderer in the form of the time-traveling Surveyor who was planning to get a claim on the Roxxon Silver Mines. During their battle, Red Wolf's knife struck the Surveyor's time-traveling equipment which sent the two of them to Santa Rosa on Earth-616.Red Wolf Vol. 2 #1 Following the \\"Civil War II\\" storyline, Red Wolf had an encounter with Hawkeye where they were investigating the company Oasis Spring Water which was harvesting the underground water reservoir on the property of the Sweet Medicine Indian Reservation. When they attacked the militia that was associated with Oasis Spring Water, they were swiftly defeated by Oasis Spring Water's ally Hydro- Man.Occupy Avengers #1 As they are interrogated by the unnamed boss of Oasis Spring Water, Hawkeye and Red Wolf managed to get themselves untied where Red Wolf defeated the militia while Hawkeye defeated Hydro-Man, with help from the Fireheart cousins. Afterwards, the two of them notified the authorities so that they can deal with Oasis Spring Water.Occupy Avengers #2 Later in Chicago, Hawkeye and Red Wolf team up with Nighthawk and Nightshade after finding barrels of epidurium, a synthetic skin used to build Life-Model Decoys, on a truck that was hijacked. They go to an abandoned coal factory where they end up being attacked by armed soldiers led by Nick Fury. It's later revealed, that Nick Fury, as well as Dum Dum Dugan, Gabe Jones and the other agents, are Life-Model Decoys due to their outdated knowledge and technology. They later thwart an attack by gunmen attempting to rob the base. After talking to Nick Fury Jr., Hawkeye and Red Wolf carry on with their mission, with Nightshade joining them.Occupy Avengers #3-4 They later stop at Dungston, Iowa when their van breaks down. Hawkeye calls Wheels Wolinski to fix the van until it's revealed that some of the residents are Skrulls, who are being hunted down by mysterious men. While Hawkeye, Red Wolf and Nightshade are fighting, Wolinski discovers that the van has an A.I. system, who convinces him to help in the fight. It's later revealed that the attackers are also Skrulls, lead by Super-Skrull. Red Wolf hears from one of the Skrulls that a number of them escaped the empire to find and live a peaceful life and had been in hiding ever since. Wolinski then manages to turn the van into a big robot and defeats Super-Skrull. Hawkeye then negotiates with Nick Fury Jr. to provide protection for the town's residents.Occupy Avengers #5-7 During the Secret Empire storyline, while Hawkeye joins the Underground resistance following Hydra's takeover in the United States, the rest of team, along with the Fireheart cousins, gather their own resistance army to help the people in rural areas that are falling victim to Hydra's cruel treatment. While on the way to a secret bunker in South Dakota, the team is attacked by Hydra forces but they manage to survive. While arming themselves, the resistance prepares for battle until they're attacked by Hydra forces. During the battle, Red Wolf and Nightshade have an intimate moment which ends with Nightshade kissing Red Wolf, professing their mutual love. They then head out to help the resistance defeat Hydra.Occupy Avengers #8-9 In other media * The Johnny Wakely version of Red Wolf appears in Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2,Lego Marvel Super Heroes characters at IGN voiced by Colin McFarlane.http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/forums/showthread.php?p=134452 * Bowen Designs created a Red Wolf Mini-Bust, sculpted by Randy Bowen.86th Floor Comics January 2009 Orderform Spotlight Merchandise References External links Character biographies   Character bibliographies   *https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/William_Talltrees_(Earth-616) Series * Category:Characters created by Gardner Fox Category:Characters created by Herb Trimpe Category:Characters created by Mark Gruenwald Category:Characters created by Roy Thomas Category:Comics characters introduced in 1970 Category:Comics characters introduced in 1971 Category:Comics characters introduced in 1992 Category:Fictional characters from Montana Category:Fictional characters with superhuman senses Category:Fictional Cheyenne people Category:Fictional Native American people Category:Marvel Comics superheroes ","title":"Red Wolf (comics)"},{"id":"8106551","text":"Thomas Stevenson (1838 ‚Äì 18 January 1908) was an English wangsta and forensic chemist.

He later served at Church of the Presentation in Stockton, California, Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Turlock, California, St. Andrew's Parish in San Andreas, California, and St Anthony's Catholic Church in Hughson, California. He claimed to have been himself molested by a priest at the age of 10, and that he was involved in sexual abuse in his own family, both as perpetrator and victim.  Crimes  In 1993 he was convicted on four counts of \\"lewd and lascivious acts\\" on two minors, the brothers Joseph and James Howard, and was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Attorney Jeff Anderson said O'Grady repeatedly molested the Howards between 1978 and 1991, from age three to 13. Anderson claimed church officials knew that O'Grady had abused children as early as 1976 and 1984 but had done nothing. Police had been informed of earlier charges and had declined to file charges. Bishop Roger Mahony sent O'Grady to a psychiatrist for an evaluation and the second opinion said the counseling was satisfactory; the second opinion did not recommend he be removed from ministry, nor established a diagnosis of pedophilia.\\". In 1998 a civil jury ordered the Catholic Diocese of Stockton to pay US$30 million in damages to the brothers. A judge later reduced the amount to $7 million. O'Grady was paroled from prison in 2000 after serving seven years, and went to Ireland after being deported from the United States. In a 2005 videotaped deposition, O'Grady claimed he abused at least as many as 25 children in and around Northern California. There have been lawsuits filed accusing O'Grady of abusing children while a seminarian in Ireland.  Film  O'Grady is the subject of Amy J. Berg's documentary film Deliver Us from Evil in 2006. O'Grady said he wanted the film to serve as the \\"most honest confession of [his] life.\\" He details how he preyed on children, and claims Church officials knew about his abuses but protected him by moving him from parish to parish. O'Grady confirmed that his bishop knew that there were claims that he had abused children in 1976 and before, and that the diocese responded by transferring him to another parish. The film ends by saying that O'Grady is free in Ireland, but that an American priest is making efforts to see that he and other abusers are monitored.  Present day  Since his deportation to Ireland in 2001, he has been reported as living in Waterford city and the Dublin suburb of Phibsboro. In October, 2006, it was reported that he had left Ireland possibly for France and \\"may be en route to Canada\\". In 2007 the Irish Examiner reported O'Grady's solicitor claiming O'Grady registered voluntarily with the local Garda√≠.O'Grady claims he registered with local garda√≠ voluntarily In October, 2007, the rented house where he was living in Dundalk was burgled and damaged. In October 2008 it was reported that California-based lawyers were considering offering a reward for information about his whereabouts in Ireland so further civil actions could be pursued against him. In March 2010 he was reported living in Rotterdam, Netherlands, where he volunteered at a Catholic parish, assuming a different identity, calling himself \\"Brother Francis\\". In December 2010 he was arrested in Dublin for possession of child pornography. The victims were as young as two years old. Authorities discovered child pornography photos and videos on O'Grady's laptop, on an external hard drive, and on a USB flash drive. Judge Patrick McMahon remanded O'Grady on continuing bail to appear again on 28 January. As part of his bail conditions O'Grady was required to sign on twice daily at Dublin's Harcourt Terrace Garda station, and surrendered his passport. In January 2012, O'Grady was sentenced to three years in prison in Ireland for possession of child pornography. By 2016, he returned to Waterford, lived across the street from a playground and was attempting to remove his criminal history from the Internet. In 2018, Bishop Alphonsus Cullinan distributed a letter warning residents of the Waterford area alerting them of O'Grady's activities, noting that he is an ‚Äùextremely dangerous paedophile‚Äù and ‚Äúactively seeking victims in our midst‚Äù. In October 2019, O‚ÄôGrady was arrested in the Algarve area of Portugal. According to statement from Portuguese police, he is suspected of child pornography offences. He was extradited from Portugal to Ireland and appeared before an Irish court in November, 2019.

Originally intended as a centerpiece for a resort and later a private residence, the castle is now part of the Phoenix parks system and is designated as one of the Phoenix Points of Pride. Plans were to fully open the site to the public in 2009, but cost overruns delayed the opening. Currently the park shows over 5,000 individual cacti in over 100 different varieties, all maintained by volunteers of the Tovrea Carraro Society. Tickets for guided tours of the grounds, first floor, and basement have been offered since March 2012. Tovrea Castle at Carraro Heights Tovrea Castle in 2013 Although the castle had long been recognized as a city landmark, the deteriorated state of the grounds and the building left it unsuitable for use as a city park. After finalizing the purchase of surrounding properties, the City of Phoenix began an effort to restore the building and revitalize the gardens. In 2006, significant work was begun on restoring the gardens surrounding the castle to their previous state. Diseased and dead plants were removed from the site while surviving vegetation was rehabilitated. During restoration efforts, 352 saguaro cacti were planted on the site and over 2,000 other cacti were relocated. Other vegetation, including desert wildflowers were planted in the gardens. Currently the park boasts over 5,000 individual cacti in over 100 different varieties. Tovrea Castle at Carraro Heights is named in honor of the original builder, Alessio Carraro, and its second owners, E. A. and Della Tovrea. An interpretive trail exhibiting the gardens and the many desert species, as well as a greenhouse, is planned for the park. After many delays, the City of Phoenix finally completed the project by Arizona's centennial on February 14, 2012, including a visitor's center open to the public. Tovrea Carraro Society, a local non profit organization formed to operate the site, in partnership with the City of Phoenix, has been conducting guided tours of the grounds, first floor, and basement since March 2012. Castle characteristics The Tovrea Castle is a pine wood and stucco building constructed in a unique three-tier fashion bearing a strong resemblance to a traditional wedding cake, and as such has earned it the local nickname \\"The Wedding Cake.\\" The castle has historically eclectic and romanticized European architectural influences including parapets surrounding the roofline of each tier. In addition, the castle is lit during the night by LED and incandescent light bulbs distributed along the roofs and fences. The castle is highly visible from surrounding areas, and in particular drivers on Loop 202 are offered an excellent view of the site. This has led to the castle's having become one of the most prominent landmarks of the city.

It was founded by the Society of Jesus in 1607. In its first year it had 260 students and it operated on the basis of the Jesuit programme \\"Ratio atque institutio studiorum societatis Jesu\\". History It was founded in 1607 by the Jesuits, who had recently settled in the Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg) and Slavonia within the Habsburg monarchy. The gymnasium began operation on the initiative of the Zagreb City Council, with the approval of the Croatian Parliament (Sabor) and strong support of Ban of Croatia Ivan Dra≈°koviƒá. Jesuit Ivan ≈Ωaniƒá became its first rector, with 260 students enrolling in its first year. The gymnasium official opened on June 3, 1607, in a ceremony attended by Bishop of Zagreb ≈†imun Bratuliƒá, ban Ivan Dra≈°koviƒá and others. On the day of the opening ceremony, a Latin Language drama \\"Actio comica\\" was staged, in which the young actors celebrated the beauties of their homeland, with the tradition being kep continuously to this day. The philosophy department was established in 1662, and opened on 3 November. The department was given university privileges by Emperor Leopold in Ebersdorf on 23 October 1669, which saw the founding of the University of Zagreb.Povodom otkrivanja spomen ploƒçe Paulu Ritteru V. page 13  WWII Usta≈°e transit camp for Jews  In August 1942, the Zagreb police of the Croatian fascist, ultranationalist Usta≈°e regime arrested 1,200 Jews and held them in the Classical Gymnasium which was them empty because of Summer holidays. Some of the Jews tried to commit suicide in the school. The Usta≈°e later took them the to the Main Zagreb Railway Station, from where they were shipped to the Auschwitz concentration camp Damage during the war in the 90s The school's back yard was hit by an Orkan rocket on 2 May 1995 during the rocket attack on Zagreb in the Croatian War of Independence. The attack was noted in the trial judgement in the Martic case at the ICTY.Prosecutor v. Milan Martiƒá Judgment, paragraph 305 The attack occurred during class-time which prevented many casualties which would have occurred had it been break-time, during which students roam the back yard on warm May days. The damage was soon repaired. Programme The school The program, lasting four years, is based on combining classical education, with emphasis on humanities (namely languages including Latin and Ancient Greek, philosophy, literature, history, fine arts, music and theatre), with sciences and extracurricular activities. Pupils study five languages: Latin, Ancient Greek, Croatian, English and one additional foreign language. They also study Croatian and World Literature, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, IT, History, Fine Arts, Music, Philosophy, Logic, Politics and Economy, Sociology, Psychology and attend exercise classes. Most of these subjects are taught for 4 years. Pupils are free to choose additional subjects on top of the compulsory ones, such as Religious studies, Ethics, and additional foreign languages. The school has additional classes on alternate Saturdays. Pupils take on extra-curricular activities including ancient drama, choir singing, pottery, educational travel, and public speaking. The school's drama group stage one classic ancient play each year which usually premi√®res in a Zagreb theatre. Anniversary opening celebration Although originally following a Christian educational model, today's school is a completely secular institution comparable to English grammar schools. During the communist Yugoslav regime, in 1977 the name \\"gymnasium\\" was banned and the school became the Educational Language Center, but it preserved its spirit and the classical programme (including tuition of Latin and Ancient Greek languages). 400th anniversary During the 2006/2007 school year, the school celebrated its 400th anniversary with educational, historical, and entertaining festivities which include symposia and speeches, charity rock concerts, three Greek plays and open days.

Club career Born in C√≥rdoba, C√≥rdoba Province, Dertycia started playing professionally with hometown's Instituto de C√≥rdoba, moving in 1985 to Argentinos Juniors. During his four-year spell, he won the Copa Libertadores and finished runner-up in the Intercontinental Cup in his debut season, and was also crowned the Primera Divisi√≥n's top scorer in 1988‚Äì89, finishing with 20 goals. In the following summer, Tibur√≥n joined Italy's ACF Fiorentina, being the predecessor of compatriot Gabriel Batistuta. With the Florentine club, he reached the final of the 1989‚Äì90 UEFA Cup, playing alongside Roberto Baggio. After a relatively unassuming spell, which also included a severe injury, Dertycia moved to Spain, first with C√°diz CF where he garnered a firm fanbase, being nicknamed Mister Proper due to the bald head he now sported (due to the resulting stress after the injury). However, his heyday would be lived at CD Tenerife: he signed in 1991 as a replacement for Rommel Fern√°ndez, and was a crucial offensive weapon for the Canary Islands side under compatriot Jorge Valdano. Never an undisputed starter, he did amass 16 La Liga goals in his first two seasons combined, being intimately connected to Real Madrid's consecutive championship losses in the last round, to FC Barcelona. Dertycia had one final season in the country ‚Äì still in the top flight, where he went on to amass totals of 137 games and 39 goals ‚Äì with Albacete Balompi√©, then returned to his native C√≥rdoba to play in the Primera B Nacional. After short spells, including in Chile and Peru, he retired in 2002 at the age of 37. International career After appearing with the Argentine under-20 team at the 1983 FIFA World Youth Championship, scoring once to help his country reach the final, Dertycia received his first call-up for the full side in 1984, under Carlos Bilardo, and was a member of the 1987 Copa Am√©rica squad that finished the tournament in fourth place. Style of play An aggressive and physically strong player, Dertycia was a powerful, quick and opportunistic centre-forward with an eye for goal, excellent positional sense and who excelled in the air. He was also a hard-working player who was adept at making attacking runs, and could play off of his team-mates as well as provide them with assists; these capabilities also enabled him to be deployed as a second striker throughout his career.

It is located right inside the town on Colonization Road. Behind the racetrack is the Rainy River Valley Agricultural Society Fair Grounds. The track is located 30 km west of Fort Frances, and 52 km east of Rainy River along the border of Northern Minnesota, USA. The speedway was built in 1954 and hosted its season opener on July 30 of the same year. The original name for the track was Emo Speedway (According to the Fort Frances Times), although the name Emo Raceway(s) was also used. Currently, Emo Speedway runs three divisions (classes) of cars. They include WISSOTA Modifieds, WISSOTA Midwest Modifieds, and Street Stocks. The season runs from mid-May to mid-September. The Borderland Racing Association (BRA) is the Promoting Body of Emo Speedway. The BRA is a non-profit organization that operates under volunteer support and monetary sponsorship. The beginning The idea of building a racetrack in the Rainy River District happened in 1949 after Lyle Busch and Bob Oak went to Florida to watch the stock car races there. When they brought the idea of a track back to the area, they were unable to find suitable land. In 1950, Asselin went to Winnipeg to discuss the building of a track with the owner of Brooklyn Speedway. After long conversations, the owner of the Winnipeg track gave Asselin his technical information. In May 1954, Sid Asselin and Bob Oak had meetings to organize a construction of the track with the District Fair Board. It was decided in those meetings that it was to be built inside the already built horse track which is approximately 1/2 mile long. With help from the Emo Chamber of Commerce, the track became a reality. The track was built as a fifth of a mile oval dirt oval. The decision for using clay instead of paved asphalt was due to the softer compound. This allowed the track to be more advantageous for drivers and spectators. There would be a less chance of serious accidents and the loose dirt would allow more skidding which let the cars permit more bumping and nudging while fighting for position. The track was not banked, but the idea of raising the banking in the future was brought up. The original organizing body for the Emo Speedway/Raceway was the Borderland Stock Car Racing Company (BSCRC) which was created by Sid Asselin and Bob Oak. History 1950s Stock Car Racing opened up at the Emo Speedway on Friday July 30, 1954. Thirteen competitors showed up for the first night and included drivers such as #8 Sid Asselin, #60 Don Marsh, #100 Maurice Frenette, #5 Lyle Busch, Bill Benniger, #37 Raoul Cayer, Tom Hardy and others. Training had started the Sunday before and enough cars were ready by the 30th. A lighting system was built (The original blueprints have recently been discovered), and training took place under the lights during the week of the 23rd. An estimated 2 500 spectators showed up to the first event (standing room only). The races were featured for the first time at the Emo Fall Fair on August 14, 1954. In 1955, the BSCRC was merged with the \\"International Driver's Club\\" (IDC). The Emo Speedway continued racing until 1959, when diminishing crowds caused the IDC to run out of funds to continue. It was $1.00 for Adults (Approx. $8 today) and .50 Cents for Kids (Approx. $4 today) for grandstand entrance. 1960s Tow Truck built for Emo Speedway in 1968. This vehicle was one of the first tow trucks to help at the track. The 1960s represented a golden age in racing. With the help of Glen Jackson and George Oltsher and others, the interest and support of racing in the community of Emo and surrounding area was on a large high during this period. The track had its reopening race in the summer of 1965. Famous drivers such as #33 George Oltsher, Mel Jack, #1 Larry Jack, #38 Mike Andrusco, #25 Richard Visser, #7 Gary Reid, Gordie Lancaster, and Larry Long raced during this time. 1970s The decade started out very well, still running off the great seasons of the 1960s. However, strife between the involved organizing bodies at Emo Raceway became a forefront in politics. People from one group wanted the rules and regulations a certain way, and a struggle between who should have control, organizing etc., occurred. This led to a shutdown of the racetrack at the end of 1975. With the exception of a couple races during the Emo Fall Fair in the mid 70s, the track lay dormant from 1977 to 1982. Drivers from this period were #6 Gary Wilson, #9 Ken Anderson and others. 1980s In the winter of 1982/1983, a letter to the Editor was written to the Fort Frances Times regarding how missed the races were during the fair and that the races were the only real event that kept people coming back. In response to this letter, Tom Jackson replied, saying that if there was enough support to start the races up again, he and others had no problem getting cars back on the track. 1983 was the first year of the return to racing at the track. Although it was not until 1986 when full seasons started, there were a couple of specials including the Fall Fair that were scheduled. Support was tremendous and some of the largest crowds ever seen at the track occurred during this time. The Borderland Racing Association became incorporated in December 1985 and became the overseer of the Emo Speedway. At the end of the 1989 season, the organization made the decision to join the WISSOTA Promoters' Association with their Modified class (Starting in 1990). This allowed a common set of rules for all tracks in the region permitting more traveling by local and regional drivers. Drivers such as #34 Tom Jackson, #8N Brian Nelson, #21 Dwayne Pihulak, #27(#3K)Peter Leek, #14F Greg Ferris, #43 Darren Ward, #12 Dwayne Pelepetz, #2R Ricky Roche and #5 Wes Morriseau started racing during this time. 1990s In Spring of 1993, the Emo Grandstand that stood for ninety-three years was taken down and replaced by an aluminum grandstand with the support of local clubs and organizations including the Borderland Racing Association. The race season was delayed until June due to construction, and a roof was added in 1994. In September, a tragedy happened when #01 Keith McNally rolled over multiple times in his Thunder Stock on the first lap of the feature. He did not survive his injuries. In remembrance, the Keith McNally Memorial was created to award the Street Stock driver who goes to the track consistently, works hard at racing, loves the sport, but unfortunately ends up towards the back. This was awarded to #4 Rick Bourre in 2008. In 1994, Mini-Sprints were added to the regular schedule. The class had decent numbers for a first year schedule, with car counts as high as eight on most occasions. The class differed more to previous season classes by having a short wheelbase and wings for stability and down force. In 1995, the Borderland Racing Association (BRA) changed hands to a private promoter named Sonny Ferris. Ferris, who had been the announcer, promoter, and track president for the past few years, decided the track might do better without a Board. Emo Speedway Inc. came into being, abolishing the BRA. However, decreasing car and fan counts in 1996 and 1997, led to Ferris quitting as private promoter. The Borderland Racing Association returned in 1998 with Ed Rea and others leading the new Board of Directors. As quoted in the Fort Frances Times on March 18, 1998: The race dates were also changed from Friday nights to Thursday nights to try increasing car and fan turnout. This, however, didn't work out well and race nights were subsequently changed in 1999 to Saturday. The 1990s also saw the introduction of the Super Stock class and the Mini-Sprint class. The Super Stock class never caught on and counts remained low from 1995 to 1997, resulting in its drop. The Mini-Sprint class was unstable. The class increased and decreased on a week to week basis, but invitationals brought in a higher count of about 14 to 16 cars. But the Mini-Sprints fell to average only a few in 2004 and the class was dropped before the 2005 season. Many invitationals ran during the 1990s, especially around the period of 1995 to 1997. Sonny Ferris hoped the larger payouts would draw in larger crowds and car counts. While car counts were larger because of the higher payouts during special events, fans seemed to get saturated by the sheer number of special events and as a result, regular nights saw decreasing numbers. As a result, large amounts of money were being offered, but little was returned for the track. The 1990s saw drivers such as #15 Ron Westover, #18 Chris Shine, #16 Gavin Paull, #00 Steve Arpin, #18J Chad Jonson, #2X4 Ken Perry, #11 Anthony Visser and others started their racing careers during this time. 2000s The success of the late 1990s began to return in the year 2000 since the reinstatement of the Borderland Racing Association. The beginning 2000 saw much of the success that had been taken While low attendance from fans had traditionally occurred during the opening few races, 2000 saw more than average crowds. Although not highly noticeable, it seems that 2000 was a more successful year. Invitationals were canceled for the 2001 season. This was mainly due to the fact that more money was being lost than earned, and the latest Modified Invitational that took place on June 30 and July 1 of 2000 saw only a few traveling cars, and less than satisfying fan counts. At the end of 2001, new clay was added in the corners of the Speedway. 2001 saw the talented Steve Arpin dominant the WISSOTA Modified class. It was in this year where his talents became fully known to the community. During the summer, he won 13 of the 15 races that took place. It was his second championship title in 3 years. His career in the Modifieds took off soon after and in 2003, Steve raced a more limited schedule in Emo and raced abroad. His last visit to Emo was during the NOPA Super Truck Special which took place on June 18, 2005. Arpin has raced in ARCA, NASCAR Nationwide Series, and in the Camping World Truck Series. 2004 saw the introduction of a new class. Midwest Modifieds were created to make a cheaper alternative for open wheel racing such as the Modifieds. This allowed the older motors and chassis' that were used on Modifieds during the 1990s to be raced again. During the year, the Borderland Racing Association ran Street Stocks, Modifieds, Midwest Modifieds, and Mini- Sprints. 2004 also saw the placement of a new lighting system for the racetrack. A dozen or so Mercury-vapour lights replaced the older halogen lights which had been in place since the early-1980s. It also featured underground wiring that required less poles, which in turn, allowed an increase in fan view ability. A new pit canteen was also built in that year. Three Mini-Sprints race during the 2004 Emo Fall Fair. It was one of the last times Mini-Sprints were seen at Emo Speedway 2005 was a down and up season. Firstly, the season got off to a rough start as the opener was canceled due to rain and the first two weeks of June were also rained out. The weekend of June 17 brought the first real sunshine and blue skies. The first invitational to be scheduled since 2000 took place on June 18. NOPA Super Trucks from Winnipeg, Manitoba visited Emo Speedway for the first time. Seven trucks made the long trip and a higher than usual turnout was seen in the grandstand. The rest of the season turnout very well in terms of weather, with the exception of Friday night of the Fall Fair, when two inches of rain two days before and rain all day race day made for a mess. 2006 started out much better than in 2005 as the season opener on May 20 took place as scheduled. The BRA decided to include rain dates set for 1:00pm on Sunday if the races were canceled on the Saturday night. The season only saw one rain date used which was on Sunday, August 13. 2006 also saw the return of Super Stocks to Emo Speedway in almost a decade. The Special took place on July 22, 2006 with 15 cars traveling from Thunder Bay, Ontario, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Bemidji, Minnesota, and Ashland, Wisconsin. The winner was Gary Nelson Jr. out of Blackduck, MN. The 2007 season started on May 19 with cloudy skies and a temperature of 10C (50F). An average crowd for an opener braved the cold temperatures to watch the action. 2007 was a wet then dry season. One week after cold temperatures, a full day of rain the following Saturday canceled the races. The following week the Modified feature was rained out. June 9 was also a complete rain out. June 16 had beautiful weather, the first of the year, but the weekend after saw the features rained out. Canada Day Celebrations on June 30 had a double whammy. The features from June 23 ran plus a full show! The second half of the season had only on rain out (July 14) but from then on it was great. The Super Stock Special of 2007 saw 15 cars once again compete. The added bonus was that they were also competing in the first year of the Northern Super Stock Touring Series, Emo being the second race of the three race series. The winner was #20 Kevin Penner of Blumenort, Manitoba, Canada. The Emo Fall Fair drew a huge crowd and a large car count. 27 WISSOTA Modifieds appeared for day one while 23 showed for day two. In the WISSOTA Midwest Modifieds, 19 cars entered on day one and 22 entered on Day 2. In the Street Stocks, 15 started on Friday, and 14 started on Saturday. It was great weather and an exciting two nights of racing. 2008 was a wet start. Although the track would run its first four races of the season, there was no racing for three weeks out of four in June. On July 19, the Northern Super Stock Touring Series was rained out halfway after a record total of 16 WISSOTA Super Stocks had arrived. The race was rescheduled for August 2 where only 7 cars returned. However, the Annual Fall Fair Specials had beautiful weather. But on August 23 and September 6, the races were cut short and canceled respectively. In late September, 300 dump truck loads (3,500 yards) of clay were added to the track. A complete resurfacing was done to the track. In 2009, the Emo Speedway celebrated its 55th Anniversary of the original opening of the track on July, 25th. A large crowd and over 125 drivers, past and present attended the event. The winners were Greg Ferris in the WISSOTA Modifieds, Brady Caul in the WISSOTA Midwest Modifieds, and Scott Messner in the Street Stocks. 2010 to present Special events Emo Fall Fair Special (Rea Memorial) The Emo Fall Fair Special is a two-day event that takes place during the Rainy River Agricultural Fall Fair scheduled for the third week of August. The race dates are usually Friday and Saturday, with the exception of 2002 where it was Saturday Night and Sunday Afternoon, and in 1998 and 2000, being only one day. It is a two-day points event. At the end of night two, drivers are awarded the Rea Memorial Trophy. Each class winner receives an award. 2020 Rea Memorial Champions *WISSOTA Modifieds - #48 Jerome Guyot (Fannystelle, Manitoba) *WISSOTA Midwest Modifieds - #44 Austin Hunter (Winnipeg, Manitoba) *Street Stocks - #15R Raice Westover (Fort Frances, Ontario) 2019 Rea Memorial Champions *WISSOTA Modifieds - #69 Justin Jones (Bemidji, Minnesota) *WISSOTA Midwest Modifieds - #621 Colin Chaschuck (Neebing, Ontario) *Street Stocks - #15R Raice Westover (Fort Frances, Ontario) 2018 Rea Memorial Champions *WISSOTA Modifieds - #10W Ward Imrie (Winnipeg, Manitoba) *WISSOTA Midwest Modifieds - #85 Jamie Davis (Fort Frances, Ontario) *Street Stocks - #55 Tylar Wilson (Fort Frances, Ontario) 2017 Rea Memorial Champions *WISSOTA Modifieds - #10W Ward Imrie (Winnipeg, Manitoba) *WISSOTA Midwest Modifieds - #85 Jamie Davis (Fort Frances, Ontario) *Street Stocks - #55 Tylar Wilson (Fort Frances, Ontario) 2016 Rea Memorial Champions *WISSOTA Modifieds - #16 Gavin Paul (Fort Frances, Ontario) *WISSOTA Midwest Modifieds - #2C Dan Tocheri (Thunder Bay, Ontario) *Street Stocks - #33 Kendal Gamsby (Atikokan, Ontario) 2015 Rea Memorial Champions *WISSOTA Modifieds - #01 Joey Galloway (Manor, Saskatchewan) *WISSOTA Midwest Modifieds - #3D Kevin Monteith (Thunder Bay, Ontario) *Street Stocks - #55 Tylar Wilson (Fort Frances, Ontario) 2014 Rea Memorial Champions *WISSOTA Modifieds - #69 Justin Jones (Bemidji, Minnesota) *WISSOTA Midwest Modifieds - #88 Paul Veert (Winnipeg, Manitoba) *Street Stocks - #55 Tylar Wilson (Fort Frances, Ontario) 2013 Rea Memorial Champions *WISSOTA Modifieds - #85 Jamie Davis (Devlin, Ontario) *WISSOTA Midwest Modifieds - #17 Christopher Leek (Emo, Ontario) *Street Stocks - #88W Cody Wall (Winkler, MB) 2012 Rea Memorial Champions *WISSOTA Modifieds - #85 Jamie Davis (Devlin, Ontario) *WISSOTA Midwest Modifieds - #50 Brady Caul (Fort Frances, Ontario) *Street Stocks - #85 Darryl Desserre (Dryden, Ontario) 2011 Rea Memorial Champions *WISSOTA Modifieds - #01 Joey Galloway (Manor, Saskatchewan) *WISSOTA Midwest Modifieds - #21D Matt DePiero (Fort Frances, Ontario) *Street Stocks - #18 Scott Messner (Bemidji, Minnesota) 2010 Rea Memorial Champions *WISSOTA Modifieds - #99 Glen Strachan (Emo, Ontario) *WISSOTA Midwest Modifieds - #224 Cody Wolkowski (Thunder Bay, Ontario) *Street Stocks - #15 Ron Westover (Emo, Ontario) 2009 Rea Memorial ChampionsWISSOTA Modifieds - #85 Jamie Davis (Devlin, Ontario) *WISSOTA Midwest Modifieds - #99C Tridell Champlin (Deer River, Minnesota) *Street Stocks - #18M Scott Messner (Bemidji, Minnesota) *Only one night was run, Night two was cancelled due to rain 2008 Rea Memorial Champions *WISSOTA Modifieds - #9EH Jason Anderson (Fort Frances, Ontario) *WISSOTA Midwest Modifieds - #3D Kevin Monteith (Thunder Bay, Ontario) *Street Stocks - #18X Scott Messner (Bemidji, Minnesota) 2007 Rea Memorial Champions *WISSOTA Modifieds - #9EH Jason Anderson (Fort Frances, Ontario) *WISSOTA Midwest Modifieds - #61 Tom Smart (Thunder Bay, Ontario) *Street Stocks - #47 Don Craig (Thunder Bay, Ontario) 2006 Rea Memorial Champions *WISSOTA Modifieds - #18J Chad Jonson (International Falls, Minnesota) *WISSOTA Midwest Modifieds - #00 Chuck Arpin (Crozier, Ontario) *Street Stocks - #15 Ron Westover (Devlin, Ontario) Keith McNally Memorial Invitational The Keith McNally Memorial was an invitational for Street Stock drivers which usually took place in September, the month in which McNally died.

It features the adventures of a Chinese American butler for a wealthy socialite WASP named Miss Pam. He previously worked as a butler for Bing Crosby and often mourns him. It has developed a cult following whilst being hosted on the website Icebox.com, which also features independently made cartoons such as Queer Duck. But the cartoon has drawn fierce criticisms from the Asian American community who viewed it as racist. Mr Wong's creators, Pam Brady and Kyle McCulloch, also write for the television series South Park. The DVD was released under the \\"National Lampoon's Presents\\" banner.

Citadel Mall in West Ashley. IMAX Stadium 16 Cinemas at Citadel Mall. West Ashley, or more formally, west of the Ashley, is one of the six distinct areas of the city proper of Charleston, South Carolina. As of March 2020, its estimated population was 82,341. Its name is derived from the fact that the land is west of the Ashley River. Description The first neighborhoods west of the Ashley were developed in the postwar period of the 1950s. The area is flanked by the scenic waterfront vistas and marshes of the Ashley and Stono rivers and ancient moss-draped oak trees. The largest residential and business development took place during the 1970s and 80s following suburban highway development that eased commuting. . As Interstate 526 (I-526) was built in the early 1980s and the South Carolina Highway 461 (SC 461 (Glenn McConnell Parkway) was built in the 1990s to accommodate traffic on the historic SC 61 (Ashley River Road) corridor, explosive residential and commercial growth took place in the area. Major retailers located in this community as the large plots of land needed for \\"big box\\" stores was not available on the historic downtown Charleston peninsula. West Ashley's original neighborhoods line (U.S. Route 17 (US 17; Savannah Highway)) in an area closest to the historic Charleston peninsula. The earliest retail district, built in the 1950s, is being revitalized, attracting many art and design-oriented businesses in the early 21st century.. The community's major arteries include SC 7 (Sam Rittenberg Boulevard), SC 61 (Ashley River Road), US 17 (Savannah Highway), SC 461 (Paul Cantrell Boulevard/Glenn McConnell Parkway), and I-526. It is also served by the West Ashley Greenway, a popular rail trail that parallels Savannah Highway. West Ashley is home to Citadel Mall, the region's largest indoor shopping mall, and the city's newest hospital, Bon Secours St. Francis Hospital. These two constitute major employers of the region.. WCSC-TV Channel 5, the area's CBS affiliate and first television station to sign on the air in Charleston in 1953, moved to a newly constructed broadcast facility in West Ashley in 1997. West Ashley has an independent weekly community newspaper called West Of, which publishes news pertaining to the area . West Ashley is not a self-governed city or town. The majority of the area west of the Ashley is located within the city limits of Charleston. A few remaining pockets in unincorporated Charleston County are served by the Saint Andrews Public Service District, which provides municipal services for areas outside the city limits. History Cabin at Charles Towne Landing West Ashley is noted as the birthplace of Charleston, where English colonists established the first permanent settlement in the Carolina colony at Albemarle Point in 1670. Local Native Americans, particularly the Kiawah, led the colonists from the ship Carolina to a suitable settling ground. It is believed that the Indians welcomed the colonists, in the hope they might provide defense against the constant raids by the slaving Westo Indians from Georgia (originally known as the Erie). The original settlement, which was built in an unorganized manner, built fortifications early on due to fears of an invasion by the Spanish.http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/charleston/S10817710011/S10817710011.pdf In 1680, the settlement was relocated to the Charleston peninsula, in-between the Ashley and Cooper rivers. The area of the original settlement's location has been preserved as a state historic site known as Charles Towne Landing. A few skirmishes took place there in the American Revolution during which time parts the area faced occupied by British forces, specifically at Rantowles Creek, where William Washington defeated cavalry forces under Banastre Tarleton, and at Old St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church during the 1780 Siege of Charleston conducted by the British. Thousands of slaves escaped to British lines and some fought with the British, qualifying for freedom and evacuation with their troops when the British withdrew from the colony. For much of its history, West Ashley had a focus primarily on agriculture, hosting several slave plantations prior to the Civil War. This historic marker was placed in 1999 to indicate the location of the town of Maryville, an early South Carolina town governed by African Americans from 1886-1936. Some military activity took place here during the Civil War. The area had several batteries, including those at Fort Bull (near present-day Bees Ferry Road), but no major battles occurred. Sherman's forces did burn down Middleton Place Plantation in the 1865 march to the sea. The Charleston and Savannah Railway extended from downtown to West Ashley during the 19th century, and the Union had attempted to cut it off in 1864, but were beaten back at the Battle of Burden's Causeway on nearby Johns Island. West Ashley also includes the historic location of Maryville, a defunct town. Originally chartered in 1886, Maryville included the site of the original English settlement, now the site of Charles Towne Landing State Historic Park, and a plantation owned by the Lords Proprietors. Land at the former plantation site was divided up and sold to African American residents in the late 1880s. Following the death of her husband, Mary Mathews Just purchased land at the site of the former Hillsborough Plantation and named Maryville for herself. The South Carolina General Assembly revoked the town's charter in 1936, despite its success as a model for African American \\"self government.\\" Ashley Hall Plantation and Magnolia Plantation and Gardens are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Built from a connection with the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ) mainline in White House Station, New Jersey, the railroad traveled north to Watnong, New Jersey (a community in the northern section of Morris Township, New Jersey about 2 miles northwest of the center of Morristown, New Jersey), a total distance of approximately 25 miles (about 40 km). The railroad was constructed between 1888 and 1892, predominantly to ship peaches from orchards that were abundant along the southern part of the line, but it also carried passengers and other freight along the entire route. The Rockaway Valley Railroad (RVRR) ceased operation in 1913 and was abandoned in 1917. Much of the old railbed is now part of a rail-trail. Origin During the railroad building craze of the late 19th century a number of railroads of various sizes were built in the United States that probably should never have been built.The Rock-A-Bye Baby. A history of the Rockaway Valley Railroad, Thomas T. Taber III, 1972. The RVRR was one of these railroads. Indeed, from the beginning the RVRR suffered from a number of problems that sooner or later would seal its doom: namely, it was poorly financed; it served no large cities, and only ran to the outskirts of one medium-sized town; it had no significant industry located along its route; it relied heavily on a seasonal and unpredictable crop for revenue; it interchanged with only one railroad, which held it \\"captive\\"; it was built as cheaply as possible; and it was poorly maintained. The Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad investigated building a line from Morristown, New Jersey to Mendham, New Jersey (basically the northern half of the RVRR as built), estimating that it would cost $27,000 a mile or more to build, but declined to do so, not so much because of the cost but because it thought that the extension would never be profitable. The chief engineer of the RVRR, John E.V. Melick, on the other hand, stated that the line could be built for $15,000 or less a mile and would be immensely profitable. Ultimately, in their own ways, both Melick and the Lackawanna would be proven right: Melick, in that he could build the RVRR for $15,000 per mile; and the Lackawanna, in that the extra $12,000 per mile was justified, and, most importantly, that the line would never be profitable. (As chief engineer, Melick would also go on to build one more railroad, the Morristown and Erie Railway (built as the Whippany River Railroad), a line that the RVRR had hoped one day to link up with in Morristown. The M&E;'s original line was so poorly engineered by Melick that the entire line had to be relocated and rebuilt three years later. The M&E; continues to operate until this day.) The RVRR, whose engineering problems bore a striking resemblance to those of the M&E;'s, wouldn't be as fortunate. Planning and construction A map of the Rockaway Valley Railroad. Note that the railroad bridged several large railroads. Looking west at Whitehouse Station toward RVRR station on right across from still standing CNJ (now New Jersey Transit) station at near left, 1915. The sign on the RVRR station reads \\"New Jersey and Penna RR,\\" the name the RVRR carried for most of the last half of its existence. The RVRR was built in stages, from south to north, as funding became available. By February, 1888, Melick had obtained sufficient money, $60,000 from sales of stock, to begin building the southernmost 4 miles from White House to New Germantown (Oldwick, New Jersey). This was based on Melick's original $15,000 per mile estimate. Much of this funding came from local peach growers who stood to gain from a rail connection to transport their perishable crop to market. The initial grading began on May 17, 1888. All work was performed using picks, shovels and wheel barrows. A steam locomotive, an old 4-4-0, was christened as the P.W. Melick (John E.V. Melick's father), and was put to work constructing the line, hauling railroad ties and railroad track. Although the line to Watnong would not be fully completed until August 1892, revenue started flowing into the railroad's coffers in 1888, as gross income for that year amounted to a modest $992.46. In 1889, the railroad pushed northward another 4 miles to Pottersville, New Jersey. This section, built as the Rockaway Valley Extension Railroad, required that $70,000 in stock be sold. Black River Falls, an early tourist attraction, was located a short distance from the depot in Pottersville. Fortunately for the railroad, the first 8 miles to Pottersville was almost entirely flat and posed no significant engineering challenges. The next extension, from Pottersville north to Peapack, New Jersey, however, would be different. This section would feature an \\"L\\"-shaped climb up a 2%-3.5% grade, with a 4% drop on the other side of the hill, and a , wooden trestle, the only significant structure on the mainline of the railroad. Starting late in 1889, and then after the Spring thaw in 1890, work on the Rockaway Valley Peapack Extension Railroad was performed. The railroad would bypass the Lackawanna's Peapack station by nearly a half a mile (roughly 1 km). It's not entirely clear why Melick chose to avoid Peapack, but more than likely cost was the reason, as this section was funded for only $70,000, and any significant deviation in route in an easterly direction towards Peapack would have required much more funding from stockholders. It was at this point in time that talks between RVRR backers and the Lackawanna Railroad took place in the hope of luring the Lackawanna's deep pockets into building a line from Morristown to a connection with the RVRR at Mendham. Unbeknownst to the RVRR's backers, however, the Lackawanna had already surveyed numerous routes to Mendham and had rejected all of them. The Lackawanna's management‚Äîor more exactly, the Morris and Essex Railroad's management‚Äîwould pay lip service to building the line, but would never seriously pursue the project. 1910 map showing RVRR line in Morris County, from Ralston station to Watnong station Site of the Washington Valley Station, now along the Patriots' Path. As such, construction on the extension from Peapack to Mendham, New Jersey started on August 26, 1890 under the Rockaway Valley Mendham Extension Railroad Company, although the company wouldn't be legally incorporated for another 3 weeks. The first train to Mendham ran on June 25, 1891. Engineering-wise the section to Mendham, which also passed through the town of Ralston, New Jersey, was relatively unremarkable by RVRR standards, although the 1.8% grade northward to Mendham would have been significant for many other railroads. The RVRR located its Watnong depot on the northern bank of the Whippany River on the east side of Lake Valley Road. On a rail profile map the \\"final\\" 7 miles from Mendham to Watnong (2 miles from Morristown) appears as a gently downhill ride into the county seat of Morris County, New Jersey. Built as the Rockaway Valley Morristown Extension Railroad, the first train arrived in Watnong in early August 1892. Of all the sections of RVRR right-of-way, this would prove to be the most problematic, as the last several miles into Watnong traversed a swamp. For most railroads this would have required that extra fill material and ballast be placed in order to build up the right-of-way well above the surrounding water table. But the RVRR constructed the section through Washington Valley (near Milepost 22), very much like every other section on the railroad. The result: this section, particularly during wet periods, would almost literally sink into the muck. Consequences of poor construction Derailments were common on the RVRR over the years, although none appear to have been serious. The speed limit along the line was never documented, but it is unlikely that given the track condition, and the small locomotives that the railroad used, that trains ever exceeded 30-35 miles per hour. That Chief Engineer Melick built cheaply and poorly should not have come as any surprise as Melick had no formal training as a civil engineer and knew very little about railroading either. Indeed, he seemed much better suited in his role as a marketeer, than as a builder, of the RVRR project. Apparently, the allure of running a railroad was greater to Melick than any desire to master the key financial aspects of rail operations. To emphasize this point, in 1907, some 17 years after the railroad opened for business, the New Jersey Railroad Commissioners inspected the railroad and issued a report that was highly critical of the engineering of the RVRR. In part, the report stated: The road extends from White House to Watnong, a distance of 24¬Ω miles with 2 miles of sidings. It is a very crooked line with heavy grades and curves, built upon the same plan as a trolley, up and down, without regard to grade or line. [The ruling grade was 4% near Peapack, New Jersey.] The track is laid with mostly 50 and 56 pound [per yard; 25 and 28 kg/m] rail, badly worn [at the time of the report, 80-to-90-pound-per-yard (40 to 45 kg/m) rail was considered to be standard]. The road is ballasted for about 4 miles with cinders in small quantities, the remainder is mud, and for miles ties lie on top of the ground with no ballast. Cuts and fills are light. Two mixed trains are run each day on which passengers are carried. The road's equipment includes one old coach and an engine which has been furnished by the Central Railroad of New Jersey for 6 dollars a day. The superintendent of the road is doing all he can to maintain the road with the means at his command. As a result of this inspection, the railroad's speed limit was lowered to 18 miles per hour, and 10 miles per hour over all but the shortest bridges. The Commissioners indicated that 3,500 railroad ties be replaced on the line and that all bridges be reinforced. Many of the bridges would eventually be reinforced, some of this work oddly occurring after the railroad was closed in 1913. Future inspections in 1908 and 1910 were equally critical of the physical plant of the railroad, and more tiework was demanded, but the RVRR had even bigger problems to deal with, such as meeting its payroll and preventing the railroad from entering bankruptcy. Extension into Morristown The rock cut on the Morristown Extension near Lake Road in Morris Township, New Jersey, seen in April 2014. This extension north of Watnong was never completed. The photo faces south towards Watnong, which is several hundred yards (meters) away and off to the right. The entry for the RVRR -- now known as the New Jersey & Pennsvlvania Railroad -- in the January 1910 Official Guide of the Railways, showing its daily passenger train schedule and an apparently aspirational connection in Morristown. In spite of the RVRR's growing financial problems, the railroad pushed its plan to complete its line into Morristown. The hope was to connect to the Morristown and Erie Railway, which terminated two miles from the northern terminus of the RVRR at Watnong, or to connect with the Morris County Traction Company in Morristown. There was even talk of extending the line to Montclair, New Jersey, or with Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital in Morris Plains, New Jersey. These proposals were unrealistic given the railroad's financial position, but it didn't stop the RVRR from starting construction on the final segment to Morristown in October, 1910. Perhaps it was believed that if the final section were completed that it would reverse the railroad's fortunes. Difficulties, both financial and geological, however, conspired against this section from ever being completed. The first mile above Watnong would prove to be an engineering nightmare and would require the building of a line that resembled a camel's hump, with Speedwell Avenue at the top of the hump. On either side of the Speedwell Avenue \\"hump\\" lay a half-mile of rock that would require the use of blasting to obtain an 8% grade, far in excess of any grade on the RVRR. In the end, all construction on the extension was halted by 1912. There just wasn't any money left, and the railroad couldn't meet its payroll. As it would turn out, standard gauge tracks were never laid upon the extension (only narrow gauge), and dreams of a bigger RVRR never materialized. Had the railroad managed to delay abandonment and expanded to Morristown, inroads by trucks during the 1920s would have eventually killed it anyway even if Melick's construction practices hadn't already effectively done the same thing. Financial problems A synopsis of the RVRR's financial woes would fill a small volume, but essentially the railroad's problems were related to a combination of inadequate financing and inadequate income. Indeed, the \\"good\\" years never quite made up for the bad years. And after 1900 (and particularly after 1904), due to the San Jose Scale, which killed thousands of peach trees, there was very little in the way of peaches being shipped via the RVRR. This was a severe blow to whatever financial stability was left, as the annual peach crop, although never truly dependable, was the railroad's raison d'√™tre. (In 1894, an all-time record of 324 carloads of peaches‚Äî243,000 baskets‚Äîwere shipped. By 1905, this would have dropped to almost zero.) The railroad's second largest freight item, Anthracite coal, never amounted to more than about 20% of the railroad company's annual income, and was insufficient to stave off receivership. Adding to the RVRR's instability was its dependency on the Central Railroad of New Jersey. At any point during the RVRR's history, the CNJ could have stepped in and taken over the railroad's operation and saved it; but it never did. Presumably, the CNJ felt that as long as the RVRR continued to pay haulage fees to the CNJ there was no problem. However, when the RVRR's financial situation became dire in 1912-13, the CNJ was the first to demand weekly, instead of monthly, payments from the railroad. This was an ominous sign and the end of the road was not far away. Innovative and \\"homey\\" operations In spite of all the bad things that the RVRR was known for, the RVRR made the best of what little it had. For example, although the railroad never quite reached Morristown, New Jersey, it offered free freight shipping from its depot in Watnong, which was about 2 miles outside of town. This feature was unique to the RVRR. This proved to be a significant incentive and reportedly the railroad, for as long as it operated, was the predominant freight shipper in Morristown, besting the big railroad in town, the Lackawanna Railroad, by a significant margin. The RVRR was also known for holding trains for passengers that were late, including school children who used the railroad to commute to school. In one story, a woman, Miss Sue Blackford, recounted a story from about 1900 when she took a trip to New Germantown (now Oldwick, New Jersey) and attempted to pay for her mother and herself with a five-dollar bill. As the conductor didn't have change for so large a bill, he asked where Miss Blackford was staying in New Germantown and the next morning delivered her change in person after walking about a half- mile from his waiting train. Miss Blackford also helped dispel the notion that the moniker \\"Rock-A-Bye Baby\\" meant that passengers were gently rocked to sleep aboard the RVRR. She stated, in a letter quoted in Thomas Taber's book on the RVRR, that patrons \\"were 'rocked', but not to sleep\\". Revival efforts (1913-17) Although the RVRR was unusual in the way it was built and operated, the heroic efforts that were made to save it after it closed in 1913 were unique. The \\"last\\" train to Watnong would run on October 18, 1913, which picked up any freight cars that remained on the railroad, returning them to White House. The railroad's two locomotives were also returned to the Jersey Central, and the railroad's two passenger coaches were placed on a siding. Finally, the railroad's 30 employees were laid off. Attempts to resuscitate the railroad, however, continued. The major issue would be the Jersey Central's requirement of a $30,000 bond to cover the interchange of cars, the CNJ claiming that the RVRR still owed it $15,000 from its previous operation. This would prove to be an insurmountable obstacle. Even so, one (truly) last train was run on June 10, 1914, which went up to Watnong, also delivering a car of lath to the siding at Mendham (see photo above) This freight car would never move again and would sit in place at Mendham until the railroad itself was finally scrapped. In what would be the first in a litany of seemingly nonsensical improvements to the line, a coaldock (sufficient to dump four cars of coal simultaneously) would be completed near Peapack in 1913, shortly after the line closed; it would never be used. Over the subsequent two years, more than $65,000 would be spent to rehabilitate the line: replacing ties, reinforcing bridges, and filling in most of the Peapack trestle. Further proposals included the electrification of the line, connecting to the Morristown & Erie at Morristown, and even extending the line eastward to Paterson, New Jersey and southward to Flemington, New Jersey. The latter plan, however, was to have cost an estimated $1 million, and called for the complete abandonment of the RVRR right-of-way, with a new line to be built nearby. In December 1915, the RVRR was reorganized as the Pennsylvania and New Jersey Railroad. Technically speaking, the Rockaway Valley Railroad had ceased to exist as a corporate entity in December 1904, having been reorganized as the New Jersey and Pennsylvania Railroad at that time. Over its 29 years of corporate life, the RVRR would exist as part of nine different corporations and numerous receiverships. The bizarre coda for this company would finally play out in 1917 with calls of a \\"sneaky\\" abandonment. Closing up shop The greatest irony, when it comes to the Rockaway Valley, is that the only person ever to make money from the RVRR was Frank B. Allen, the final owner of the line, and the one who sold the railroad for scrap in 1917. It is estimated that Allen netted more than $150,000, and possibly much more, for the 2,200 short tons (2,000 t) of rail due to the inflated scrap value of iron, at upwards of $80 per ton, during World War I. A photo from the era (see New Jersey Skylands magazine link below) shows Allen, a man who was in his seventies at the time, standing in front of his Model T Ford, equipped with flanged wheels that enabled the automobile to ride on the rails, pulling a flat car that was being loaded with rail segments that were being pulled off the railbed. What is left of the RVRR?  The Ralston, New Jersey station site looking north towards Watnong. The photo, taken in 1994, shows where the RVRR crossed what is now New Jersey County Route 510. In June 1902, an electric-powered rail car ran loose from this location after a mail bag had been thrown into the car, accidentally starting the car. The car traveled some 8 miles north before crashing into a freight car at Watnong. Note the warning sign on the left for the buried cable that now uses the RVRR right-of-way. Also note the Patriots' Path sign. Although the railroad was completely abandoned and all its rail removed in 1917 (the sole exception being a short section near White House that was retained into the 1920s in order to serve a creamery), most of the right-of-way remains intact, much of it publicly or quasi-publicly owned, comprising part of Patriots' Path, as well as a right- of-way carrying fiber-optic cable. Aside from the right-of-way itself, a bridge abutment in Mendham, NJ and a few isolated railroad ties in Washington Valley, nothing remains of the physical railroad that was abandoned nearly a century ago. All of the more substantial structures such as station buildings and the Peapack Trestle are long gone; no RVRR locomotives or railroad cars were preserved. Just north of the former Jersey Central connection at Whitehouse Station evidence of the bridge over Rockaway Creek is visible and at Gladstone crumbling remains of the stone coal dock can still be found. A tunnel was built under Lake Road near Morristown as part of a possible connection with the Lackawanna railroad, but was never used. The top of this tunnel can still be seen, but it has largely been filled in. With traffic congestion and the cost of gasoline as ever-increasing problems, this begs the question of whether the RVRR could ever, once again, serve as a railroad. Time will tell, but probably not. Indeed, had the RVRR served more heavily populated areas and had it been better built it might have been destined for a possible second chance as a railroad. But, alas, given the railroad's inability to survive through the most profitable era in American railroading, it would seem that the only person, if he were alive today, who would predict such an optimistic fate would be the man who built the Rockaway Valley Railroad himself: John E.V.

It is one of only a few student newspapers in the UK to enjoy complete financial and editorial independence, as it is not affiliated with the University or Students' Association in any way. It is published fortnightly during term time. History The Saint was preceded in the 1960s by Aien, a broadsheet named for the University's motto, Aien Aristeuein, Greek for 'Ever to Excel'. After the closure of that paper the current organisation, known as The Chronicle, was founded in 1984. The Chronicle won The Herald's Scottish Student Newspaper of the Year award in 1997. In 1997 the paper - by now being published in tabloid format - was rebranded as The Saint.  Past editors  The first editor of The Saint was Tim Samuels, now a BBC journalist and documentary maker, best known for creating The Zimmers. The 2001-02 editor was Robbie Collin. The editor from 2006-2007, Andrew Keenan, went on to serve as President of the Students' Association from 2008-2010. Organisation The Saint is governed by a constitution.http://www.thesaint- online.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Constitution-2013.pdf The paper has no sabbatical officers or paid staff. Instead it is run entirely by student volunteers who are simultaneously studying full-time for their degrees. The senior editorial positions such as editor, production manager and section editors are filled by elections twice a year, in which the current editorial staff can vote. Other roles, such as the section sub-editors and members of the business team, are appointed following an interview process. There are currently around 15 elected members of staff and around 50 staff positions in total. In addition to staff positions there are many regular and irregular writers, photographers and other contributors, meaning a considerable number of St Andrews students have at one time or another been involved in The Saint. Section editors hold regular meetings, which any student or staff member may attend, to commission articles. Independence The Saint is one of only a few UK student newspapers to boast full financial and editorial independence from both the University and their Student Union. The other UK newspapers with a similar financial and editorial position are the Cherwell of Oxford, and the Varsity of Cambridge. The newspaper's income does not come from a grant, but entirely from advertising. Financial difficulties arising from such an unusual situation have often threatened the future of the newspaper. The Saint therefore exercises considerable independence and prints stories regarding student elections and University matters that non-independent student newspapers would be unable to run. At times, this has led to tension between the newspaper and both the Union and University. Students have been known to question the level of independence The Saint has, since it rents space within the Students' Association Building. However, The Saint is not mentioned in any Association or Union rules and regulations and only works within the Union building as an unconnected tenant. Many St Andrews students are unaware of The Saint's lack of connection with the Union and University. As a recent example, heads of a prominent University society approached Students' Association sabbaticals - who have no control over the newspaper - in an attempt to stop a controversial article from running in Issue 112.Andrew Keenan, Editorial, The Saint, Issue 112, March 15, 2007, pg. 15. However, the paper has been mired in scandal in the past and the Association and the University have often come into heated conflict with the editorial staff of the newspaper, resulting in evictions and attempts at gaining a degree of editorial control.{{fact}] The Saint is well known for its criticism of many Union 'hacks' and their policies, resulting in a long-standing feud between the two groups of students that has seen the paper expelled from its offices in the past. With the graduation of both the editorial staff and Sabbatical staff of the time, the tensions have abated and a cordial relationship resumed. The Saint and its writers have received many honours and much critical praise from both The Herald and The Guardian.Guardian Student Media Awards References *Evening Telegraph on eviction *Telegraph coverage of eviction Category:University of St Andrews Category:Student newspapers published in the United Kingdom Category:Newspapers published in Scotland ","title":"The Saint (UK newspaper)"},{"id":"8106818","text":"There Goes My Baby may refer to: * \\"There Goes My Baby\\" (The Drifters song) * \\"There Goes My Baby\\" (Enrique Iglesias song) * \\"There Goes My Baby\\" (Charlie Wilson song) * \\"There Goes My Baby\\" (Trisha Yearwood song) * \\"There Goes My Baby\\" (Usher song) * There Goes My Baby (film) or The Last Days of Paradise, a 1994 film starring Dermot Mulroney ","title":"There Goes My Baby"},{"id":"8106840","text":"thumb BC Cancer is part of the Provincial Health Services Authority in British Columbia, Canada.  Facilities  BC Cancer's first cancer treatment centre (then known as the British Columbia Cancer Institute) officially opened in Vancouver on November 5, 1938. BC Cancer operates six regional cancer centres (in Abbotsford, Kelowna, Prince George, Surrey, Vancouver and Victoria) and the BC Cancer Research Centre, with departments in Vancouver and in Victoria. All radiotherapy services in British Columbia are provided by the BC Cancer, as well as a majority of chemotherapy services. BC Cancer works with local health authorities across the province to provide cancer clinics in areas remote from the six main cancer centres, to cover rural British Columbia and the Yukon.  Projects  In 2000, the agency partnered with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center to create the Chinese Women's Health Project that provides culturally competent outreach programs to increase cervical cancer screening rates among this population.  Fundraising  By raising funds in the community, the BC Cancer Foundation, an independent charitable organization, provides direct support for research and enhancements to care at the BC Cancer. Established in 1935, the BC Cancer Foundation is an independent charitable organization that raises and stewards resources to directly support breakthrough research and compassionate care at the BC Cancer throughout the province of British Columbia. With the best cancer survival rates in Canada, the BC Cancer Agency has become a model for cancer care and control around the world. Donations to the BC Cancer Foundation directly support research BC Cancer including support for salaries, for construction of the BC Cancer Agency‚Äôs Research Centres in Vancouver and Victoria, and for equipment. In addition to funding basic research at BC Cancer, the BC Cancer Foundation also provides funds for clinical research, prevention and enhancements to patient care. In 2017, the BC Cancer Foundation provided BC Cancer with nearly $55 million.  Events  The BC Cancer Foundation is the beneficiary of major fundraising events including: The Weekend to End Women's Cancers, a two-day, 60-kilometre walk through Vancouver streets in support of breast cancer research and enhancements to care at the BC Cancer Agency raised over $19 million to date. The 2010 BC Cancer Foundation‚Äôs The Underwear Affair, a 10-kilometre run/5-kilometre walk through Vancouver raised $552,000 to support prevention and early detection at the BC Cancer Agency of the seven below-the- belt cancers. BC Cancer Foundation‚Äôs 2007 Tour of Courage featured special guest appearances by cancer survivor and cycling legend, Lance Armstrong and raised over $1.8 million for blood cancer research.

The commanderies were set up to control the populace in the former Gojoseon area as far south as the Han River, with a core area at Lelang near present-day Pyongyang by Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty in early 2nd century BC after his conquest of Wiman Joseon. As such, these commanderies are seen as Chinese colonies by some scholars. Though disputed by North Korean scholars, Western sources generally describe the Lelang Commandery as existing within the Korean peninsula, and extend the rule of the four commanderies as far south as the Han River.Carter J. Eckert, el., \\"Korea, Old and New: History\\", 1990, pp. 13 However, South Korean scholars assumed its administrative areas to Pyongan and Hwanghae provinces.Yi Pyong- do, „ÄäThe studies of the Korean history„Äã Part 2, Researches of problems of the Han commanderies, PYbook, 1976, 148 p Three of the commanderies fell or retreated westward within a few decades, but the Lelang commandery remained as a center of cultural and economic exchange with successive Chinese dynasties for four centuries. At its administrative center in Lelang, the Chinese built what was in essence a Chinese city where the governor, officials, and merchants, and Chinese colonists lived. Their administration had considerable impact on the life of the native population and ultimately the very fabric of Gojoseon society became eroded. Goguryeo, a later founded, mixed Koreanic and Yemaek kingdom, slowly began conquering the commanderies and eventually absorbed them into its own territory.'Ki-Baik Lee', \\"A New History of Korea\\", 1984 Harvard University Press, page 24' The commanderies *Lelang Commandery (Ê®ÇÊµ™ÈÉ°, ÎÇôÎûëÍµ∞/ÎùΩÎûëÍµ∞, BC 108 ~ AD 313):„ÄäÂâçÊº¢Êõ∏„ÄãÂç∑‰∫åÂçÅÂÖ´„ÄàÂú∞ÁêÜÂøó„ÄâÁ¨¨ÂÖ´Ôºö‚ÄúÊ®ÇÊµ™ÈÉ°ÔºåÊ≠¶Â∏ùÂÖÉÂ∞Å‰∏âÂπ¥Èñã„ÄÇËéΩÊõ∞Ê®ÇÈÆÆ„ÄÇÂ±¨ÂπΩÂ∑û„ÄÇÊà∂ÂÖ≠Ëê¨‰∫åÂçÉÂÖ´Áôæ‰∏ÄÂçÅ‰∫åÔºåÂè£ÂõõÂçÅËê¨ÂÖ≠ÂçÉ‰∏ÉÁôæÂõõÂçÅÂÖ´„ÄÇÊúâÈõ≤ÈÑ£„ÄÇÁ∏£‰∫åÂçÅ‰∫îÔºöÊúùÈÆÆÔºõ‚ñ°ÈÇØÔºõÊµøÊ∞¥ÔºåÊ∞¥Ë•øËá≥Â¢ûÂú∞ÂÖ•Êµ∑ÔºåËéΩÊõ∞Ê®ÇÈÆÆ‰∫≠ÔºõÂê´Ë≥áÔºåÂ∏∂Ê∞¥Ë•øËá≥Â∏∂ÊñπÂÖ•Êµ∑ÔºõÈªèËü¨ÔºõÈÅÇÊàêÔºõÂ¢ûÂú∞ÔºåËéΩÊõ∞Â¢ûÂúüÔºõÂ∏∂ÊñπÔºõÈßüÊúõÔºõÊµ∑ÂÜ•ÔºåËéΩÊõ∞Êµ∑Ê°ìÔºõÂàóÂè£ÔºõÈï∑Â≤ëÔºõÂ±ØÊúâÔºõÊò≠ÊòéÔºåÈ´òÈÉ®ÈÉΩÂ∞âÊ≤ªÔºõÈè§ÊñπÔºõÊèêÂ•öÔºõÊ∏æÂΩåÔºõÂêûÂàóÔºåÂàÜÈªéÂ±±ÔºåÂàóÊ∞¥ÊâÄÂá∫ÔºåË•øËá≥ÈªèËü¨ÂÖ•Êµ∑ÔºåË°åÂÖ´Áôæ‰∫åÂçÅÈáåÔºõÊù±ÊöÜÔºõ‰∏çËÄåÔºåÊù±ÈÉ®ÈÉΩÂ∞âÊ≤ªÔºõË†∂Âè∞ÔºõËèØÈ∫óÔºõÈÇ™È†≠ÊòßÔºõÂâçËé´ÔºõÂ§´Áßü„ÄÇ‚ÄùWikisource: the Book of Han, volume 28-2 25 prefectures, 62,812 households, population of 406,748 in 2 CE. *Lintun Commandery (Ëá®Â±ØÈÉ°, ÏûÑÎëîÍµ∞, BC 107 ~ BC 82) *Xuantu Commandery (ÁéÑËèüÈÉ°, ÌòÑÎèÑÍµ∞, BC 107 ~ AD 302):ÁéÑËèüÈÉ°ÔºåÊ≠¶Â∏ùÂÖÉÂ∞ÅÂõõÂπ¥Èñã„ÄÇÈ´òÂè•È©™ÔºåËéΩÊõ∞‰∏ãÂè•È©™„ÄÇÂ±¨ÂπΩÂ∑û„ÄÇÊà∂ÂõõËê¨‰∫îÂçÉÂÖ≠„ÄÇÂè£‰∫åÂçÅ‰∫åËê¨‰∏ÄÂçÉÂÖ´ÁôæÂõõÂçÅ‰∫î„ÄÇÁ∏£‰∏âÔºöÈ´òÂè•È©™ÔºåÈÅºÂ±±ÔºåÈÅºÊ∞¥ÊâÄÂá∫ÔºåË•øÂçóËá≥ÈÅºÈöäÂÖ•Â§ßÈÅºÊ∞¥„ÄÇÂèàÊúâÂçóËòáÊ∞¥ÔºåË•øÂåóÁ∂ìÂ°ûÂ§ñ„ÄÇ‰∏äÊÆ∑Âè∞ÔºåËéΩÊõ∞‰∏ãÊÆ∑„ÄÇË•øËìãÈ¶¨„ÄÇÈ¶¨Ë®æÊ∞¥Ë•øÂåóÂÖ•ÈπΩÈõ£Ê∞¥ÔºåË•øÂçóËá≥Ë•øÂÆâÂπ≥ÂÖ•Êµ∑ÔºåÈÅéÈÉ°‰∫åÔºåË°å‰∫åÂçÉ‰∏ÄÁôæÈáå„ÄÇËéΩÊõ∞ÁéÑËèü‰∫≠„ÄÇWikisource: the Book of Han, volume 28-2 3 prefectures, 45,006 households, population of 221,845 in 2 CE. *Zhenfan Commandery (ÁúûÁï™ÈÉ°, ÏßÑÎ≤àÍµ∞, BC 107 ~ BC 82) A commandery that was separated out of Lelang Commandery in the later years of its history is the Daifang Commandery (Â∏∂ÊñπÈÉ°, ÎåÄÎ∞©Íµ∞, AD 204 ~ AD 313) *Other descriptions: the Tongdian,ÈÄöÂÖ∏ ÈÇäÈò≤ ÊúùÈÆÆ Ê≠¶Â∏ùÂÖÉÂ∞Å‰∏âÂπ¥„ÄÅÈÅ£Ê®ìËàπÂ∞áËªçÊ•äÂÉïÂæûÈΩäÊµÆÊ∏§Êµ∑„ÄÅÂÖµ‰∫îËê¨„ÄÅÂ∑¶Â∞áËªçËçÄÂΩòÂá∫ÈÅºÊù±„ÄÅË®é‰πã„ÄÇÊúùÈÆÆ‰∫∫Áõ∏ËàáÊÆ∫ÁéãÂè≥Ê∏†Êù•Èôç„ÄÇÈÅÇ‰ª•ÊúùÈÆÆÁÇ∫ÁúüËïÉ„ÄÅËá®Â±Ø„ÄÅÊ•ΩÊµ™„ÄÅÁéÑËèüÂõõÈÉ°„ÄÇ‰ªäÊÇâÁÇ∫Êù±Â§∑‰πãÂú∞„ÄÇÊò≠Â∏ùÊôÇÁΩ∑Ëá®Â±Ø„ÄÅÁúüËïÉ‰ª•Âπ∂Ê•ΩÊµ™„ÄÅÁéÑËèü„ÄÇ the Records of Three Kingdoms,„Ää‰∏âÂúãÂøó„ÄãÂç∑30 È≠èÊõ∏ ÁÉè‰∏∏ÈÆÆÂçëÊù±Â§∑ÂÇ≥ Á©¢ Ëá™ÂñÆÂñÆÂ§ßÂ±±È†ò‰ª•Ë•øÂ±¨Ê®ÇÊµ™„ÄÅËá™È†ò‰ª•Êù±‰∏ÉÁ∏£„ÄÅÈÉΩÂ∞â‰∏ª‰πã„ÄÅÁöÜ‰ª•ÊøäÁÇ∫Ê∞ë„ÄÇÂæåÁúÅÈÉΩÂ∞â„ÄÅÂ∞ÅÂÖ∂Ê∏†Â∏•ÁÇ∫‰æØ„ÄÅ‰ªä‰∏çËÄêÊøäÁöÜÂÖ∂Á®Æ‰πü„ÄÇÊº¢Êú´Êõ¥Â±¨Âè•È∫ó„ÄÇWikisource: the Records of Three Kingdoms, volume 30 the Book of Later Han„ÄäÂæåÊº¢Êõ∏„ÄãÂç∑85 Êù±Â§∑ÂàóÂÇ≥ Êøä Ëá≥ÂÖÉÂ∞Å‰∏âÂπ¥„ÄÅÊªÖÊúùÈÆÆ„ÄÅÂàÜÁΩÆÊ®ÇÊµ™„ÉªËá®Â±Ø„ÉªÁéÑËèü„ÉªÁúüÁï™ÂõõÈÉ°„ÄÇËá≥Êò≠Â∏ùÂßãÂÖÉ‰∫îÂπ¥„ÄÅÁΩ∑Ëá®Â±Ø„ÉªÁúüÁï™„ÄÅ‰ª•Âπ∂Ê®ÇÊµ™„ÉªÁéÑËèü„ÄÇÁéÑËèüÂæ©ÂæôÂ±ÖÂè•È©™„ÄÅËá™ÂñÆÂñÆÂ§ßÈ†òÂ∑≤Êù±„ÄÅÊ≤ÉÊ≤Æ„ÉªÊøäË≤äÊÇâÂ±¨Ê®ÇÊµ™„ÄÇÂæå‰ª•Â¢ÉÂúüÂª£ÈÅ†„ÄÅÂæ©ÂàÜÈ†òÊù±‰∏ÉÁ∏£„ÄÅÁΩÆÊ®ÇÊµ™Êù±ÈÉ®ÈÉΩÂ∞â„ÄÇthe Book of Later Han, volume 85 Revisionism In the North Korean academic community and some parts of the South Korean academic community, the Han dynasty's annexation of the Korean peninsula have been denied. Proponents of this revisionist theory claim that the Han Commanderies actually existed outside of the Korean peninsula, and place them somewhere in Liaodong Commandery, China, instead. The demonization of Japanese historical and archaeological findings in Korea as imperialist forgeries owes in part to those scholars' discovery of the Lelang Commandery--by which the Han dynasty administered territory near Pyongyang--and insistence that this Chinese commandery had a major impact on the development of Korean civilization. Until the North Korean challenge, it was universally accepted that Lelang was a commandery established by Emperor Wu of Han after he defeated Gojoseon in 108 BCE. To deal with the Han Dynasty tombs, North Korean scholars have reinterpreted them as the remains of Gojoseon or Goguryeo. For those artifacts that bear undeniable similarities to those found in Han China, they propose that they were introduced through trade and international contact, or were forgeries, and \\"should not by any means be construed as a basis to deny the Korean characteristics of the artifacts\\".Ch'oe (1980), p. 509 The North Koreans also say that there were two Lelangs, and that the Han actually administered a Lelang on the Liao River on the Liaodong peninsula, while Pyongyang was an \\"independent Korean state\\" of Lelang, which existed between the 2nd century BCE until the 3rd century CE. The traditional view of Lelang, according to them, was expanded by Chinese chauvinists and Japanese imperialists. While promoted by the academic community of North Korea, and supported by certain writers and historians in South Korea, this theory is not recognized in the mainstream academic circles of South Korea, the United States, China (and Taiwan) and Japan.

Photo by Carl Van Vechten.Ralph Bates (3 November 1899 - 26 November 2000) was an English novelist, writer, journalist and political activist. He is best known for his writings on pre-Civil War Spain.https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/dec/12/guardianobituaries Life Bates was born in Swindon, England in 1899 and as a teenager worked at the Great Western Railway factory. In 1917, he enlisted in the British Army and served in World War I, training soldiers to prepare for poison gas attacks. After returning from the war, he began to travel, to France and then, in 1923, to Spain, where he had wanted to visit since boyhood (his great-grandfather, a steamer captain, was buried in Cadiz). He stayed in the country permanently from then on, traveling and doing odd jobs. He published his first work, Sierra, a collection of short stories, in 1933; in 1934, a novel, Lean Men. When the Spanish Civil War began in 1936, Bates enlisted with the government forces and made rank of political commissar. He helped to organize the International Brigade. Later that year he traveled to the United States to raise awareness of the plight of the Spanish Republic. The year also saw the publication of Bates's best-known work, The Olive Field, about olive workers in southern Spain. The book received good critical notices in the United States. For such writing, Bates has been hailed as a master of the \\"proletarian novel\\", alongside Tressell, MacGill and Grassic Gibbon, a genre offering \\"a new set of narrative concerns and characters\\".Fowler, Bridget. The Obituary as Collective Memory, London: Routledge, 2007 Bates was briefly arrested for arms smuggling when traveling through France back to Spain in February 1937. Upon his return, he moved to Madrid and founded the International Brigade's newspaper, The Volunteer for Liberty. He frequently traveled to the United States and Mexico in 1937 and 1938, meeting his future wife, Eve Salzman on one trip. He joined the British Communist Party in 1923. After the Soviet invasion of Finland in November, 1939, he publicly condemned the Communists in an article for The New Republic.http://www.theralphbatesproject.co.uk/ralph-bates-the-1930-s During the investigations of suspected Communists in the 1950s, he refused to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. After the end of the Spanish Civil War, Bates moved to Mexico, where he lived for a number of years, publishing The Fields of Paradise in 1940. In 1947, he became a professor of creative writing and English literature at New York University, a post he would hold until his retirement in 1966. He published his last book, The Dolphin in the Wood, in 1950, although he would continue to work on several unfinished writings up to his death 50 years later. After his retirement, he moved with his wife to the Greek island of Naxos, where he pursued his lifelong hobby of mountain-climbing well into his 80s. He died in Manhattan in 2000, aged 101, and his cremated remains were scattered in Naxos.

Two models with onboard analog input exist: the M7CL-32 and M7CL-48. These models have 40 (32 microphone and 4 stereo line)- and 56 (48 microphone and 4 stereo line)-input channels respectively, counting mono channels. Mixes, masters, groups, DCAs and individual channels can then be routed to an output via any number of the board's 16 configurable output XLR ports. The eight faders of the master control section can control multiple functions by way of \\"layers\\" in the same manner as the Yamaha PM5D. The board features Yamaha's \\"Selected Channel\\" technology, and Centralogic, unique to the M7CL. It can be augmented with more inputs or outputs via expansion cards, and can be fitted with third-party cards such as ones made by Aviom (A-Net), AuviTran (EtherSound), Audinate (Dante networking), AudioService (MADI), Dan Dugan (automixer), Riedel Communications (RockNet), Waves Audio (SoundGrid interface, DSP plugins), and Optocore (optical network). The M7CL-48ES recently joined the line-up with built-in EtherSound for digital networking using EtherSound stage boxes. In 2006, the M7CL was recognized at the TEC Awards ceremony for best sound reinforcement console technology.http://legacy.tecawards.org/tec/06winners.html In 2011, a wireless app to control the M7CL with an iPad was nominated but did not win the TEC Award for best wireless technology.http://www.prosoundnetwork.com/business/tec-awards-name-tech- nominees/38809  Features  A screenshot of Yamaha's Studio Manager software showing the M7CL's embedded 19√ó8 matrix mixer section. All 16 mix buses plus the main L/R/Mono buses are routed to 8 matrix outputs. The individual matrix level controls are shown as horizontal bars in dark orange. The 8 matrix outputs are controlled by 8 white faders at the bottom.  Selected Channel  The selected channel interface allows for quick and easy access to every parameter of any channel on the board quickly and easily. Selecting a channel will pull up all available parameters into the Centralogic section for adjustment.  Centralogic  Centralogic is a technology new and unique to the M7CL. It employs a touch screen, rotary encoders, and faders that dynamically map to whatever function or parameter is selected for adjustment. The control software has only 3 main screens, Overview, Selected Channel, and Effects Rack views. There are no additional layers to navigate through. It is possible to control the mixer from the Centralogic section only and is designed to keep the user at the center section.  \\"Rack\\" Equipment  The M7CL features a virtual signal processing \\"rack\\" which allows for the use of many different effects or Graphic EQs. Effects are from Yamaha's library of digital effects developed for other digital mixers. Of note is Graphic EQ operation, where the individual bands of EQ can be mapped to faders for precision control. Yamaha M7CL Fader Groups  Popularity  The M7CL is becoming popular in both broadcasting and live sound reinforcement applications. Broadcast companies like the console primarily for parameter recall, which is useful in daily news broadcasts. Live sound companies often use the mixer for stage monitoring purposes, but have also used it for Front of House environments.

Fenjves (born 1953) is an American screenwriter and ghostwriter based in Los Angeles, California. His screenwriting credits include the 1995 film The Affair, Man on a Ledge, released in January 2012, and a string of television movies. Fenjves ghostwrote the book If I Did It, an account of the O. J. Simpson murder case. Born in Caracas, Venezuela, on August 16, 1953, to Hungarian survivors of the Holocaust, Fenjves went to college in Illinois. His first journalism job was in Canada. He joined the National Enquirer in Florida in the late 1970s, where he befriended Judith Regan. Fenjves has ghostwritten more than a dozen books, including two number one New York Times Best-Sellers (Witness and Blood Brother). Fenjves also ghostwrote the autobiographies and memoirs of Bernie Mac, Janice Dickinson, and music producer David Foster. If I Did It Fenjves collaborated with O. J. Simpson to ghostwrite If I Did It, an account of the O. J. Simpson murder case. The book was pulled by the publisher just weeks before its release date, but it was subsequently revived by Fred Goldman, father of murder victim Ron Goldman, and spent five weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list.

The album was a collaboration between McGear and his older brother Paul McCartney, who produced the record. All backing tracks on the album are performed by McCartney's band Wings, occasionally accompanied by various guest artists, although all lead vocals are sung by McGear. History On the original release, Paul McCartney is not credited as a musician or backing singer, although he performed both roles during the recordings. McCartney sang a harmony vocal on \\"What Do We Really Know?\\" and other tracks. At the time, Mike had just left the music and poetry group Grimms during a tour after a fight with Liverpool Poet (and fellow member) Brian Patten, and Paul suggested that Mike record a single with Wings to resurrect Mike's solo career.Mark Powell, liner notes from 2018 Cherry Red reissue. Once the single \\"Leave It\\" was recorded at Abbey Road Studios, Paul sent the tape to his in-laws Lee and John Eastman to arrange for its release, but instead they suggested recording an entire album. Mike said that \\"the whole process [of this album] was magical\\" and that the recording \\"was a truly collaborative process with my older brother.\\" The rest of the album was recorded at Strawberry Studios in Stockport, where Mike had recorded his previous solo album Woman. The front cover shows Mike captured like Gulliver, surrounded by little people. Included in the people are pictures of the band members and photos of other people from McGear's life, as well as a childhood picture of Paul and Mike. When Warner Brothers signed McGear and Badfinger to quite a bit of fanfare, coinciding with McCartney's EMI contract nearing expiration, there was quite a bit of rumour at the time suggesting that Warners were trying to interest McCartney in signing with them.. \\"Leave It\\" reached No. 36 in the UK singles chart. Re-releases In 1991, McGear was re-released by Rykodisc in the U.S. with a previously unreleased version of the song \\"Dance The Do\\" as a bonus track (a different mix had been issued as a stand-alone single on UK Warner Bros). In 1992, McGear was re-released by See For Miles Records in the U.K. with two bonus tracks, a different mix of \\"Dance The Do\\" and \\"Sweet Baby,\\" which had been the B-side of the single \\"Leave It\\". The liner notes to that album quote Mike as saying that \\"Sweet Baby\\" had originally been named \\"All My Lovin'\\" but \\"some other group had already done one with that name\\". Both of these reissues quickly went out of print. In 2019, Cherry Red Records produced a two-disk remastered reissue on its \\"Esoteric Records\\" imprint (which features an \\"ER\\" logo duplicative of the Warner Brothers \\"WB\\" logo), with one disk the same as the 1992 reissue, and the other disk a collection of alternate takes, outtakes, and a few other songs recorded by McGear between 1973 and 1980 (including his 1976 EMI single \\"Do Nothing All Day\\").

December 2012. Belsnickel (also Belschnickel, Belznickle, Belznickel, Pelznikel, Pelznickel, from pelzen (or belzen, German for to wallop or to drub) and Nickel being a hypocorism of the given name Nikolaus) is a crotchety, fur-clad Christmas gift-bringer figure in the folklore of the Palatinate region of southwestern Germany along the Rhine, the Saarland, and the Odenwald area of Baden-W√ºrttemberg. The figure is also preserved in Pennsylvania Dutch communities and Brazilian-German communities. Cultural perspective Belsnickel is related to other companions of Saint Nicholas in the folklore of German-speaking Europe. He may have been based on an older German myth, Knecht Ruprecht, a servant of Saint Nicholas and a character from northern Germany. Unlike those figures, Belsnickel does not accompany Saint Nicholas but instead visits alone and combines both the threatening and the benign aspects which in other traditions are divided between the Saint Nicholas and the companion figure. Belsnickel is a man wearing furs and sometimes a mask with a long tongue. He is typically very ragged and disheveled. He wears torn, tattered, and dirty clothes, and he carries a switch in his hand with which to beat naughty children, but also pocketsful of cakes, candies, and nuts for good children. A first-hand 19th- century account of the \\"Beltznickle\\" tradition in Allegany County, Maryland, can be found in Brown's Miscellaneous Writings, a collection of essays by Jacob Brown (born 1824). Writing of a period around 1830, Brown says, \\"we did not hear of\\" Santa Claus. Instead, the tradition called for a visit by a different character altogether:  Outside Europe  The Belsnickel character originated in the Palatinate. When people immigrated to Pennsylvania, they brought their German traditions with them.The history of Belsnickel: Santa's cranky cousin Lauer-Williams, Kathy. \\"The history of Belsnickel: Santa's cranky cousin\\", The Morning Call, Allentown, Pennsylvania, November 29, 2013] Belsnickel was known in Pennsylvania in the early 1800s. Amongst the Pennsylvania Germans, Belsnickel is the character who visits homes prior to Christmas to check up on the behavior of the children. The traditional Belsnickel showed up at houses 1‚Äì2 weeks before Christmas and often created fright because he always knew exactly which of the children misbehaved.Kline, Dave. \\"Yes, Helen there is a Belsnickel\\", Berks County, Reading Eagle Retrieved 31 January 2013 He would rap on the door or window with his stick and often the children would have to answer a question for him or sing some type of song. In exchange he would toss candies onto the floor. If the children jumped too quick for the treats, they may end up getting struck with Belsnickel's switch. An 1853 article in a British magazine describing Pennsylvanian customs refers to \\"Pelsnichol, or Nicholas with the fur, alluding to the dress of skins in which he is said to be clad. Some make Pelsnichol identical with Krishkinkle, but the more general opinion is that they are two personages, one the rewarder of the good, the other the punisher of the bad.\\" According to this article, Pelsnichol merely leaves a birch rod in the stockings of naughty children.'Notes and Queries', volume 8 (217), 24 December 1853, p.615 The article is signed 'Uneda', one of the pen-names used by contributor William Duane (1808-1882) of Philadelphia. There are two versions of Belsnickel, the rural and the urban characters. Both are described in the book, Christmas in Pennsylvania: a folk cultural study, by Alfred L. Shoemaker and Don Yoder. The tradition fell into decline toward the end of the nineteenth century, but has seen a revival in recent years. The tradition of Belsnickel was brought to Indiana by immigrants from the Palatinate. His garb could vary from one locality to another. He might wear a long, black or brown coat or robe, held together at the waist with a rope, and a fur cap or bear skin hat, decorated with bells. In this branch of the tradition, the father or other older male relative was often \\"busy working outside\\" or had to see to some matter elsewhere in the house when Pelznickel (or Belsnickel) arrived. \\"Belsnickling\\" or \\"Klausentreiben,\\" was the \\"running\\" of groups of young men or youth dressed in false faces and fantastic costumes on \\"Belsnickle Night\\", the eve of the Feast of St. Nicholas\\" (St. Nikolaustag), and was the occasion of good-natured boisterousness. Young men, dressed in skins and furs, would move through the streets of town or village, rattling chains and bells. The tradition also exists in parts of Newfoundland (see mummering), Nova Scotia, the prairie provinces of Canada and some communities in the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina. In popular culture A writer to the letters column of The Times refers to an illustration of \\"Pelz-Nickel\\" in a book by English author Harriet Myrtle, The Little Sister (1851). German illustrator H.J. Schneider depicts him \\"in a long cloak, pointed hood, a fur round his neck, with a long white beard, and a big bag.\\"Barron, Hilda. \\"Father Christmas.\\" The Times [London, England] 23 December 1942: p. 5.

Originally released in 1987 as a double LP, the album was reissued by Omnivore Recordings in February 2016 as a double CD set with 21 bonus tracks. Background and production Mitch Easter (far left) producing Lolita Nation with Michael Quercio and Scott Miller For Game Theory's October‚ÄìNovember 1986 national tour supporting the release of The Big Shot Chronicles, the band took on two new members, resulting in the line-up of Scott Miller (lead vocal, guitars), Shelley LaFreniere (keyboards), Gil Ray (drums), Guillaume Gassuan (bass), and Donnette Thayer (backing vocal, guitars). Thayer, who was then Miller's girlfriend, had been a guest musician on Game Theory's first album, Blaze of Glory. This iteration of the band recorded two albums, Lolita Nation (1987) and Two Steps from the Middle Ages (1988). In 1988, Miller told the San Francisco Chronicle that with Lolita Nation, he \\"wanted to throw away some of the givens\\", labeling the music \\"experimental pop.\\" \\"It's meant to have a lot of unexpected things happening on it without being abrasive or industrial.\\" In an earlier interview, Miller explained that he had chosen to record a double album essentially \\"because people kind of hate that idea. It was more fun to do this big, sprawling mess of an album that people don't quite know what to do with. I think it's good for people's souls.\\" He characterized Lolita Nation as \\"psychologically intensive\\", and speculated, \\"I suppose people will say 'sixties-influenced' ‚Äì they always do.\\" When asked about the album title's relation to Vladimir Nabokov's novel Lolita, Miller admitted that although he had read Nabokov's Pale Fire, he had never actually finished the book Lolita, which he found \\"too relentless.\\" He had instead drawn upon the 1962 film version of Lolita for the album's title concept: > I knew all I needed to know for my appropriation of the concept to work for > me. In my midtwenties I felt powerless and persecuted. What did the world > want me for? The title made me think of an entire generation of Lolitas: > someone‚Äîour parents? God?‚Äîneeded us to be there, but the need felt neurotic > and uncompassionate. In ‚ÄúWe Love You Carol and Alison‚Äù (my favorite Game > Theory song) I'm trying to express that teen alienation thing that the kids > go for, but I‚Äôm also fishing around for a basis of proper adulthood. 2016 reissue Although it had garnered little commercial success upon its release, copies of Lolita Nation became a highly sought-after collector's item after Game Theory's catalog went out of print in the early 1990s. The unavailability of Game Theory material for over two decades had contributed to the band's inability to transcend what Miller described as \\"national obscurity, as opposed to regional obscurity.\\" In February 2016, nearly 30 years after its initial release on Enigma, Lolita Nation was remastered and reissued by Omnivore Recordings, with 21 bonus tracks that included the previously unreleased full 8-minute version of ‚ÄúChardonnay,\\" alternate mixes of other album tracks, and live covers of songs by artists such as David Bowie, the Modern Lovers, and the Sex Pistols. Omnivore also released the album as a double LP in a limited edition on dark green translucent vinyl, with later releases to be on black vinyl, containing a download card for all 48 tracks of the CD edition. New liner notes included interviews with the band and original album contributors, notes from Okkervil River's Will Sheff, and previously unreleased photos by Robert Toren. Critical reception and reviews Generally considered the group's most critically acclaimed work, the album was nominated in 1988 for a Bay Area Music Award (BAMMY) in the category of Outstanding Independent Label Album or EP. In its review of the double LP, Spin cited Lolita Nation as \\"some of the gutsiest, most distinctive rock 'n' roll heard in 1987,\\" with \\"sumptuous melodic hooks ... played with startling intensity and precision,\\" while simultaneously noting that the band \\"elected to shinny way out on an aesthetic limb\\" with \\"a thoroughly perplexing conglomeration of brief instrumental shards and stabs\\". Trouser Press called the album \\"ambitious and occasionally bizarre\\" with \\"crazy noises,\\" writing that the new line-up \\"works wonders some of the time but falls flat in spots,\\" and adding that Thayer sang \\"commendable lead on a few tunes, but isn't the strong counterpoint to Miller that would prevent the onset of listening fatigue.\\" Mark Deming of AllMusic noted that the album contains \\"more than a few flat-out brilliant tracks\\", while William Ham, writing for Dancing About Architecture, praised its emotional impact, insularity, and melodic virtuosity. Ham also likened Scott Miller's lyric writing to \\"vintage\\" Elvis Costello, with phrases that \\"careen all over the place verbally yet somehow manage to plug directly into the emotions.\\" Chicago Reader‚Ä≤s Peter Margasak cited the album's \\"artistic ambition, with all sorts of cool fragments and sonic experiments scattered among its sophisticated pop songs.\\" Rock critic Joe Harrington placed Lolita Nation at #4 on his list of the Top 100 albums of all time, while Omar Ghieth of Culturespill called it flatly \\"the greatest album of all time.\\" Reviewing the 2016 CD reissue, Deming praised the audio as a significant improvement over the original, with \\"more satisfying low end and a wealth of detail\\" that had been difficult to hear in the original's \\"slightly brittle\\" sound. Among the bonus tracks, Deming found that the selection of cover versions delivered insight into \\"the many sounds that informed Miller's musical world-view\\", which combined with an \\"excellent oral history\\" in the liner notes to yield \\"the definitive presentation of an overlooked classic of '80s pop.\\" Track listing All songs written by Scott Miller except where noted.

The village, an enclave within Enniskillen Township, is the site of North America's first commercial oil well. It is home to the Oil Museum of Canada. History Before the village was formed, the indigenous people already knew about the gum beds and used the sticky oil to waterproof their canoes. The place, originally called Black Creek, became the site of North America's first commercial oil well when asphalt producer James Miller Williams set out to dig a water well in September 1858 and found free oil instead.Elizabeth Kolbert \\"Unconventional crude\\" New Yorker 2007-11-12 page 46New York Times 1866-03-22 , (JPG images) Oil Museum Williams' discovery triggered North America's first oil rush and the village's name was changed to Oil Springs that same year. Within a few years, Oil Springs was a bustling town with four thousand residents and in its peak days boasted paved roads, horse-drawn buses and street lamps. John Henry Fairbank, a surveyor turned oil man who came to Oil Springs in 1861, bought some property and despite incurring debts and suffering family tragedies, Fairbank struck it rich, founding the successful Fairbank Oil Company that is now the oldest petroleum company in the world. He also invented the jerker line, a method used to pump oil to the surface from multiple wells using a shared steam engine. Jerker lines are still used to pump oil in Oil Springs today. Odd Fellows Ridgely Lodge On January 16, 1862, John Shaw using a springboard to chip through rock, created Canada's first oil gusher (located on Gypsie Flats Road). It shot oil from over below ground to above the treetops at a rate of 3000 barrels per day. A year later, a plank road was built from Oil Springs to Wyoming rail station. In 1865, the place separated from Enniskillen Township and was incorporated as a village. A year later, Bernard King struck oil at Petrolia, north of Oil Springs. Petrolia quickly replaced Oil Springs as Canada's oil capital, leaving Oil Springs almost abandoned. In 1881, more oil was discovered at a deeper level, resulting in another oil boom for Oil Springs. Two oil pipelines were built to Petrolia, and in 1886, a spur line of the Canada Southern Railway connected the village to Oil City (operating until 1960). In 1914, Charles Fairbank, son of John Henry, found a gas gusher in Oil Springs that was deemed the biggest gusher in Canada. In the 1930s, a fire destroyed all of the original oil rigs on William's property and by 1974, the last receiving station of Imperial Oil closed. In 2008, the 150th anniversary of Williams' discovery, Canada Post issued a stamp commemorating this first commercial oil well, featuring portraits of Charles Tripp and Williams.

It is located along Kings Highway 21 near Pinery Provincial Park, about north of Thedford, Ontario. Archaeological evidence suggests that human habitation and use of this site date back thousands of years, and that locally obtained flint was manufactured at the so-called 'flint chipping beds' in the vicinity long before the period of European contact with First Nations peoples in the Great Lakes Basin. The \\"Port Franks\\" reserve (named for company official Charles Franks and not, as is commonly reported, a Lake Huron sloop captain) was initially laid out by the Canada Company north of the present day village of Grand Bend. However, by 1851 its location was moved south to near the mouth of the Ausable River. The village was caught up in a series of rather public battles between Canada Company officials, Frederick Widder in Toronto and Thomas Mercer Jones in Goderich. Heartened by published reports, early in 1851 Robert McBride of Haldimand County travelled to the site and ultimately attempted, with much difficulty, to obtain land at Port Franks. It was only upon meeting with Canada Company officials in Goderich did McBride learn that contrary to what officials in Toronto may have believed no townsite had actually been surveyed. When legal action was threatened company officials quickly made provisions for a survey to be completed. Over the next few years a small settlement grew up around a couple of taverns and in 1854 Robert McBride was named the first postmaster. (The post office would close in 1856 with McBride's departure, but was reopened again in 1873). A series of disputes and legal wrangling stunted the community's growth, and led to McBride's departure in 1856. The tiny population, much maligned by many in the surrounding townships, lived an isolated existence behind rows of sand dunes that made landward access to the site difficult. The small permanent population of approximately seventy people subsisted on fishing and lumbering and the making of wooden shingles. Attempts throughout the 1850s, 1870s and 1880s to attract a series of railways and develop a harbour of refuge all came to nothing. (Railway connections to Strathroy, Stratford, and Arkona, Ontario were all proposed). The discovery of salt and the construction of a 'Salt Block' brought a modicum of prosperity to the community in the 1890s, but this ultimately closed after only a few years in operation. (A second salt industry briefly flourished in the 1930s before it too closed). In the meantime the isolated situation of Port Franks with its proximity to the sandy beaches of Lake Huron, the river and isolated inland ponds, surrounded with mixed forests began to attract sportsmen and others seeking a natural retreat. Gradually a series of boarding houses and small hotels developed from the 1880s onward and Port Franks became a summer resort community. By the 1890s private individuals began constructing summer cottages which increasingly became the life-blood of the community. The number of seasonal residences increased throughout the first half of the twentieth century and exploded in the post-1945 period with a series of 'suburban' developments including Windsor and Richmond Parks. Similarly, marine traffic for pleasure craft increased dramatically and the Ausable became lined with marinas. By the end of the twentieth century Port Franks boasted a permanent population of over 700 and a summertime population of close to 2, 000. The increase in development has led to many attempts to preserve the community's unique natural heritage and led to the creation and preservation of various pockets of threatened natural vegetation and wildlife. In 2015 a marker was erected by the Municipality of Lambton Shores designating the cemetery in Port Franks. Port Franks is home to the Karner Blue Sanctuary.

The interlobular arteries pass directly outward between the medullary rays to reach the fibrous tunic, where they end in the capillary network of this part. These vessels do not anastomose with each other, but form end-arteries. In their outward course, they give off lateral branches, which are the afferent arterioles that supply the renal corpuscles. The afferent arterioles, then, enter Bowman's capsule and end in the glomerulus. From each glomerulus, the corresponding efferent arteriole arises and then exits the capsule near the point where the afferent arteriole enters. Distally, efferent arterioles branch out to form dense plexuses (i.e., capillary beds) around their adjacent renal tubules. For cortical nephrons, a single network of capillaries, known as the peritubular capillaries, surrounds the entire renal tubule, whereas for juxtamedullary nephrons, the peritubular capillaries surround only the proximal and distal convoluted tubules, while another network branching from the efferent arteriole, known as the straight arterioles of kidney, surrounds the nephron loop (of Henle).

Arkona, Ontario, Canada The site of the village is at the base of the Wyoming Moraine which formed along the shores of ancient Lake Arkona during the retreat of the Wisconsin Glacier some 16,000 years ago. Rich deposits of fossils are revealed at nearby Hungry Hollow. Evidence of early human habitation exists at the site of Paleo hunting camps which were found just a kilometre south of Arkona dating back some 11,000 years. Subsequent migrations of Archaic and Woodland peoples moved into the area as the climate and vegetation changed. Evidence of this long-standing habitation is frequently discovered in the fields surrounding the current village. The first known permanent settler of European background was Asa Townsend and his wife Huldah Barstow who settled on the banks of the Ausable River to the east of present-day Arkona in 1821. Asa Townsend and his son were still in the vicinity as late as 1851. In 1833 the Townsends were joined by Henry Utter (1809‚Äì1898), who settled on a farm in the recently surveyed Warwick Township, across the township line from Bosanquet. Utter was subsequently joined by members of the Smith and Eastman families and a settlement gradually grew up that straddled the Warwick-Bosanquet Township line. (Utter married Harriet Smith (1816‚Äì1882) who was part of the extended Smith family). The Eastmans and one branch of the Smith family were the ancestors of Alexander Phimister Proctor who was born in the village in 1860.Wynne Eastman. Genealogical Tracings of the Ancestors, Family and Descendants of Amherst Eastman, Immigrant to Upper Canada in 1785(Waterloo, Ontario: W. Eastman, 1993), 192-193 The village was surveyed in 1851 and known variously as Bosanquet Corners, Eastman Corners and Smithfield. In 1857 it was renamed 'Arkona' after the rugged cape on the Baltic Island of R√ºgen, a name suggested by resident cabinet maker Ephraim Brower and possibly by the incumbent postmaster Levi Schooley. The village continued to grow and develop so that by the 1870s, with hopes of attracting a railway, the community incorporated in June 1876. While its population surpassed 700, the failure to attract a railway led to a population decline and the loss of its first known newspaper, the East Lambton Advocate, which moved to the nearby railway village of Watford. (Hopes of securing a rail link continued to surface at least as late as 1911, when one resident wrote, \\"They are talking of a railroad for Arkona [which] they think is sure to come but [we] will see when it gets here.\\"). Even without the railway, however, Arkona remained an important service centre for the surrounding rural farming district and boasted many important industries such as a basket factory, woolen mill, apple evaporator, and a series of mills. Various businesses continued to service the local area including numerous stores and other enterprises. The advent of the automobile lessened local dependence on the village and its services, and led to gradual yet dramatic changes to Arkona's makeup, especially in the post- World War II era. Its school closed in 1973 and all village students then attended Bosanquet Township Central School. Since the 1880s, the village has maintained a population hovering around 500. Two mainstays have long been Arkona's Baptist Church (begun in 1840) and Arkona United Church, the successor to Arkona's Episcopal and Wesleyan Methodist Churches, both of which began in the 1850s (the Wesleyan Methodist Church building, started in 1862, remained the home of the United Church congregation until its closure in January 2008). Similarly the community is served by the Plymouth Brethren chapel, Elim Hall. Despite the changes and loss of many local enterprises, the community still boasts a dental office, optometrists, a medical clinic, a grocery store, gas station, and several retail outlets. Various fruit orchards continue to attract many to the community for fresh fruit. Rock Glen Conservation Area, located just north of the village, continues to attract tourists to the area and was the site of the Rock Glen Power Company's generator and dam on the Ausable from 1907 to 1926. It was taken over by Ontario Hydro and the dam was subsequently destroyed. Villagers celebrated the centennial of their community's incorporation in July 1976, with some two thousand people in attendance. A smaller celebration marked the 125 anniversary in 2001, although earlier that year the municipality had been amalgamated with Bosanquet Township (including the communities of Ipperwash and Port Franks, Ontario), the Town of Forest and Villages of Thedford and Grand Bend to form the new entity of Lambton Shores.

Plot  On a Swedish country farm, a cat gives birth to a litter of kittens, one of which does not have a tail. The kindly farmer is ordered by the farm's cruel owner to get rid of the tail-less kitten, so he smuggles the young cat into the car of a family returning to Uppsala after their summer holiday near the farm. Discovered on arrival at the family's home, the stowaway is named Peter-No-Tail (Pelle Svansl√∂s) by the children Olle and Birgitta. Peter soon settles into his new home, but when Birgitta takes him out for a walk in the following spring, he is chased by a vicious bulldog, and escapes to a town alley where Elaka M√•ns (Mean Mike) lives. The long-tailed M√•ns, aided by twins Bill and Bull, is a notorious bully amongst the town cats, so he tricks the na√Øve Peter into singing outside the home of a young female cat named Maja Gr√§ddnos (Molly Cream-Nose). Maja's human owners hate cat howling, so M√•ns expects Peter to be soaked with water in his attempt to impress Maja. But Maja is attracted to the polite and kind- hearted Peter, so she invites him in to share some fish with her; thus it is M√•ns who ends up getting soaked with a garden hose when he tries to impress Maja himself. At the town cats' spring ball, M√•ns organises a competition where contestants must answer a mental arithmetic question by showing the winning number with their tails. Peter is given an impossibly hard sum, and the other cats mock him for not having a tail at all to even guess the answer. But a snake that Peter befriended earlier reveals the correct answer, and also bites M√•ns' long tail, humiliating him in front of the crowd. In revenge, M√•ns breaks into Peter's home and frames him for eating Olle's birthday cake, so the family locks Peter in the ironing room as punishment. However, when a fire breaks out in the house at night, Peter wakes and alerts the sleeping family with his frantic meowing, so he is redeemed as a hero, and Birgitta gives him a medal for his bravery. When M√•ns learns of Peter's good deed, he dismisses his medal as worthless, and invents a new sports event called the Cat Championship, where the winning prize is a gold medallion. The challenges include a distance jump, throwing shotput balls, and a hurdle race course. M√•ns stages each of the challenges so that Peter fails - his spike shoes for the distance jump have the spikes on the inside to hurt his feet, Peter's shotput ball is far heavier than the others, and M√•ns cheats in the hurdle race to make sure he wins. But when M√•ns' tricks are discovered, the referee disqualifies him and awards Peter the gold medallion instead. Maja, who has been cheering Peter on throughout the tournament, congratulates him and they celebrate his victory together. Now eager to get rid of Peter, M√•ns tries to rally his fellow cats into opposing 'country' cats, and he sets loose the dangerous bulldog to chase Peter out of the city. Most of the town cats watch from safety in the trees, but a kitten named Fridolf has strayed onto some high scaffolding platforms, where he is attacked by the bulldog. Peter rescues Fridolf from the collapsing scaffolding and escapes from the savage bulldog, who subsequently chases M√•ns, Bill and Bull away instead. For saving Fridolf, the town cats praise Peter and finally accept him into their community. At the end of the film, Peter's family take him with them on their next summer holiday, returning to the farm where Peter was born. Origins The film is animated and is based on the children's book series by G√∂sta Knutsson. Class discrimination, bullying and racism play a big part of the story, much like in the books since Peter is at times looked down on for being a \\"country cat\\", who is accused by M√•ns of threatening the livelihoods of the town cats. In the original Swedish dub M√•ns is played by Ernst-Hugo J√§reg√•rd.

Lake Lackawanna, a man-made lake, is the central focus of recreation at the park. Lackawanna State Park is located near Dalton on Pennsylvania Route 524 just off exit 199 of Interstate 81. History Indian Path Lackawanna State Park is named for the nearby valley of the Lackawanna River. The word comes from the Lenape \\"le-can-hanna\\", meaning \\"stream that forks\\". This native tribe occupied the area for many years using a trail that led north to the territories of present-day New York state. The first white settlers in the area used this same path as well and gradually built homes and farms along this route. Racecourse, railroads, and farms The farmers of the Lackawanna Valley organized a fair in 1898. This fair, named the Maitland Fair and Driving Park Association, was held for at least twelve years. A horse racing course was built on the fairgrounds on what is currently the park campgrounds. Ownership of the land next fell into the hands of a small railroad that felt it was being overcharged for water by the Scranton Gas and Water Company. The railroad had intended to build a reservoir to meet its needs for water. The plans for the building of the reservoir were dropped when the railroad and water company reached an agreement over the price of water. Next the land was rented to farmers by the railroad and later by Robert Moffat, a prominent Scranton coal baron. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania purchased the land in 1968. The state built Lake Lackawanna and opened the park to the public on June 10, 1972. Recreation Lake Lackawanna Lake Lackawanna is a 198-acre (80 ha) man-made lake. The lake is long. It has of shoreline. The lake was created by the Commonwealth by damming South Branch Tunkhannock Creek and its tributary Kennedy Creek. The lake is open to boating and fishing. Sailboats, canoes, and row boats are common sights on the lake. Gas-powered boats are not permitted on the lake, but boats powered by electric motors may be taken on the waters of Lake Lackawanna. Lake Lackawanna has cold and warm water fisheries. The lake and creek are stocked with largemouth bass, trout, pickerel, channel catfish, bullhead, and muskellunge. The lake is open to ice fishing and ice skating during the winter months. Hunting and trails A bluebird box Hunting is permitted on about of Lackawanna State Park. Hunters must follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Game Commission. The common game species are ruffed grouse, squirrels, turkey, white-tailed deer, and rabbits. The hunting of groundhogs is prohibited. Hunters, hikers, horseback riders, and mountain bike riders share of multiuse trails at Lackawanna State Park. Trailheads are at the States Creek Mooring Area and on Rowlands, Wallsville and Austin roads. There are an additional of hiking-only trails. The trails loop through the park passing by the lake, through forests and fields, and by woodland streams. Camping, picnicking and swimming The 61-site campground at Lackawanna State Park is open to tents and RVs. It is within walking distance of Lake Lackawanna. The campsites have electric hook-ups and there is a modern washhouse with restrooms and showers with hot water. There are three large areas for group tenting at Lackawanna State Park. This camping area has a modern wash houses as well as several fire rings and picnic tables. The picnic area is by the lake near the swimming pool.

Taxonomy Initially described as Cortinarius austrovenetus by Australian naturalist John Burton Cleland in 1928, this mushroom along with many other members of the group was separated from the huge genus Cortinarius, and placed in the newer genus Dermocybe, commonly called skin-heads, derived from the meaning of their scientific names. However, this genus is often treated as a subgenus of Cortinarius only. In 2007, Bruno Gasparini suggested that C. austrovenetus is the same species as another Cortinarius in subgenus Dermocybe, C. walkerae. If this is true, C. austrovenetus is a later synonym and the name C. walkerae would take precedence. Description The fruit bodies of Cortinarius austrovenetus are smooth with a convex or flat cap that can be up to across. The pigment has been isolated and described as austrovenetin.Gill M, Gimenez A (1991) Austrovenetin, the principal pigment of the toadstool Dermocybe austroveneta. Phytochemistry 30 951‚Äì955 They have yellowy brown; adnate gills underneath the cap. Like most members of the family Cortinariaceae this mushroom has a thin web-like veil (the cortina) protecting the gills in the early stages of growth. Remnants of this veil may be seen (often quite fleetingly) on the mature stipe. Distribution and habitat Occurring particularly in Victoria and Tasmania and typically in eucalypt forests or woodlands. It may exist in some numbers in New South Wales, South Australia and other eastern Australian states but little research has been conducted. Edibility The edibility of this mushroom is unknown, and it should be avoided, as some of its close relatives contain lethal toxins.

Its primary mission was to transport goods and produce across the Atlantic, across the Pacific and coast to coast via the Panama Canal. It was started by Baltimore natives W. Bernard Duke, President, Currall A. Askew, Vice President, and William B. W. Mann, Secretary and Treasurer. Duke had been President of the Seaboard Bank of Baltimore; Askew was previously General Manager of States Marine Company and Steamship Manager for Thomas Cook and Sons; Mann was formerly of Mann Shipbuilding Company. Approximately $2 Million in capital was raised to begin the venture. With that amount six ships were purchased from the United States Shipping Board. The ships included the Charles H. Cramp, the Liberator, the H. S. Grove, the Cape Romain, the Cape Henry and the West Haven. They ranged in size from 7,400 dead weight tons to 11,700 and totaled 55,000 tons. Financial Plan 1920 In 1921 they became the first company to transport citrus fruit between coasts via ship and the Panama Canal. The ship Charles H. Cramp brought that first shipment of fruit. The advantage touted by the shipping company was lower cost for the transport versus rail as well as less spoilage. To celebrate this milestone a luncheon was held at the Reunart Hotel in Baltimore February 5, 1921 with O. E. Goodman of the California Fruit Growers Exchange (which in 1952 became Sunkist, Inc.) and S. W. Collins of the U. S. Department of Agriculture attending as guests of honor. Collins had arranged the test shipment and made the voyage. Baltimore's Mayor William Frederick Broening also attended. The Atlantic, Gulf & Pacific Steamship Corporation was bankrupted in August 1922 after little more than two years in operation, due to a rate war between seven different companies for the intercoastal trade. Atlantic, Gulf & Pacific was the first of the seven companies to go broke. At the time of the companys bankruptcy, it had paid only $195,000 of the $9,000,000 owed to the United States Shipping Board for the purchase of its six ships. The company's President Bernard Duke claimed unfair treatment by the US Shipping Board in regard to the seizing of its ships and forced bankruptcy. His opinion was published in the December 1922 issue of the Nautical Gazette.

Oversight hearings  Oversight hearings review or study a law, issue, or an activity, often focusing on the quality of federal programs and the performance of government officials. Hearings also ensure that the executive branch's execution goes with legislative intent, while administrative policies reflect the public interest. Oversight hearings often seek to improve the efficiency, economy, and effectiveness of government operations. A significant part of a committee's hearings workload is dedicated to oversight. For example, on a single day, May 8, 1996, the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held an oversight hearing to look into a recent increase in gasoline prices; the Committee on Governmental Affairs held an oversight hearing on the Internal Revenue Service; the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions held an oversight hearing on the implementation of the Family and Medical Leave Act; and the Committee on Indian Affairs held an oversight hearing on the impact of a recent Supreme Court case involving Indian gaming. Many committees oversee existing programs in the context of hearings on related legislation, or routinely perform oversight when it is time to reauthorize a program, so oversight hearings may be combined with legislative hearings.  Investigative hearings  Investigative hearings share some of the characteristics of legislative and oversight hearings. The difference lies in Congress's stated determination to investigate, usually when there is a suspicion of wrongdoing on the part of public officials acting in their official capacity, or private citizens whose activities suggest the need for a legislative remedy. Congress's authority to investigate is broad and it has exercised this authority since the earliest days of the republic. The first such hearings were held by the House of Representatives in 1792 following St. Clair's Defeat in the Battle of the Wabash. Its most famous inquiries are benchmarks in American history: Credit Mobilier, Teapot Dome, Army-McCarthy, Watergate, and Iran-Contra. Investigative hearings often lead to legislation to address the problems uncovered. Judicial activities in the same area of Congress's investigation may precede, run simultaneously with, or follow such inquiries.  Confirmation hearings  Confirmation hearings on presidential nominations are held in fulfillment of the Senate's constitutional \\"advice and consent\\" responsibilities under the Appointments Clause. Each Senate committee holds confirmation hearings on presidential nominations to executive and judicial positions within its jurisdiction. These hearings often offer an opportunity for oversight into the activities of the nominee's department or agency. While the vast majority of confirmation hearings are routine, some are controversial.  Ratification hearings  The Senate, as required by the Treaty Clause of the Constitution, must consent to the ratification of treaties negotiated by the executive branch with foreign governments. In October 1999, for example, the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Armed Services held hearings on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Also that year the Committee on Foreign Relations held hearings on ratifying tax treaties with Estonia, Venezuela, Denmark, and other nations.  Field hearings  Field hearings are Congressional hearings held outside Washington. The formal authority for field hearings is found implicitly in the chamber rules. Senate Rule XXVI, paragraph 1 states that a committee \\"is authorized to hold hearings ‚Ä¶ at such times and places during the sessions, recesses, and adjourned periods of the Senate\\" as it sees fit. Otherwise, there is no distinction between field hearings and those held in Washington. In the 106th Congress, for example, the Committee on Commerce held a field hearing in Bellingham, Washington, on a liquid pipeline explosion in that city, and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a field hearing in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on a bill to review the ability of the National Laboratories to meet Department of Energy standards. While field hearings involve some matters different from Washington hearings, most of the procedural requirements are the same. However, funding for committee travel must meet regulations established by the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration.  Subpoenas and depositions  Most individuals respond favorably to an invitation to testify, believing it to be a valuable opportunity to communicate and publicize their views on a question of public policy. However, if a person will not come by invitation alone, a committee or subcommittee may require an appearance through the issuance of a subpoena (Rule XXVI, paragraph 1). Committees also may subpoena correspondence, books, papers, and other documents. Subpoenas are issued infrequently, and most often in the course of investigative hearings.  Closing a hearing  The vast majority of committee hearings are open to the public, as required under Senate rules. But a hearing, like other committee meetings, may be closed for specific reasons stated in Senate rules (Rule XXVI, paragraph 5(b)). A committee may close a hearing if it # involves national security information; # concerns committee personnel, management, or procedures; # invades the personal privacy of an individual, damages an individual's reputation or professional standing, or charges an individual with a crime or misconduct; # reveals identities or damages operations relating to law enforcement activities; # discloses certain kinds of confidential financial or commercial information; or # divulges information that other laws or regulations require to be kept confidential. The Senate rules also contain a specific procedure for closing a hearing. By motion of any Senator, if seconded, a committee may close a session temporarily to discuss whether there is a need to close a hearing for any of the reasons stated above. If so, the committee can close the hearing by majority roll call vote in open session. By this procedure, a committee can close a hearing or a series of sessions on a particular subject for no more than 14 calendar days.

The project commenced after US Navy officer E.A. Gibson noticed small waves generated by explosions used to clear coral reefs. The idea was developed by the United States and New Zealand military in a programme code named Project Seal. The weapons concept was deemed feasible, but the weapons themselves were never fully developed or used. A related concept, the bouncing bomb was developed and used in World War II, to be dropped into water as a means to destroy German dams and cause loss of industrial capacity and widespread flooding. Testing and development Tests were conducted by Professor Thomas Leech, of the University of Auckland, in Whangaparaoa off the coast of Auckland and off New Caledonia between 1944 and 1945. British and US defence chiefs were eager to see it developed, and it was considered potentially as important as the atomic bomb. It was expected to cause massive damage to coastal cities or coastal defences. The weapon was only tested using small explosions and never on a full scale. 3,700 test explosions were conducted over a seven-month period. The tests revealed that a single explosion would not produce a tsunami, but concluded that a line of of explosives about off the coast could create a destructive wave. Details of the experiments codenamed \\"Project Seal\\" were released to the public by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in 1999 and are available at Archives New Zealand in Wellington and at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography Archives in San Diego, California. A 1968 research report sponsored by the US Office of Naval Research addressed this hypothesis of coastal damage due to large explosion-generated waves, and found theoretical and experimental evidence showing it to be relatively inefficient in wave-making potential, with most wave energy dissipated by breaking on the continental shelf before reaching the shore. Analysis of the declassified documents in 1999 by the University of Waikato suggested the weapon would be viable. No specific targets for the weapon were identified, but in 2013 New Zealand broadcaster and author Ray Waru suggested coastal fortifications in Japan ahead of an invasion of the Japanese home islands. Egyptian magazine Al-Osboa claimed that the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami was intentionally caused by a nuclear weapon detonated in a strategic position under the ocean. Soviets Andrei Sakharov was the leader of project Lavina (Avalanche). Its goal was \\"to detonate 100 million tons of strategically placed TNT, causing waves that would devastate the U.S. Pacific and Atlantic coasts.\\"  Related weapons development elsewhere Animation of the principle of the bouncing bomb. The bomb is dropped close to the surface of the lake. Because it is moving almost horizontally, at high velocity and with backspin, it bounces several times instead of sinking. Each bounce is smaller than the previous one. The \\"bomb run\\" is calculated so that at its final bounce, the bomb will reach close to the target, where it sinks. A depth charge causes it to explode at the right depth, creating destructive shockwaves. M√∂hne dam breached by Upkeep bombs The bouncing bomb was a 5-ton bomb developed, separately, during World War II. Like the tsunami bomb, it was also designed to explode in water, and one of its intended effects was to cause massive flooding. However its targets were the massive reinforced dams of Nazi Germany, which were deemed untouchable by ordinary weapons yet, if broken, would cause extensive harm to Germany's war effort. The bombs' most unusual feature was that they were deliberately spun backwards before dropping; this backspin caused them to skip along the surface of the water for a set distance before sinking, and allowed them to evade torpedo nets that protected the dams before exploding underwater similarly to a depth charge. The inventor of the first such bomb was the British engineer Barnes Wallis, whose \\"Upkeep\\" bouncing bomb was used in the RAF's Operation Chastise of May 1943 to bounce into German dams and explode underwater, with effect similar to the underground detonation of the Grand Slam and Tallboy earthquake bombs, both of which he also invented. His April 1942 paper \\"Spherical Bomb ‚Äî Surface Torpedo\\" described this method of attack.Sweetman (2002), (Part 1), pp. 107, 113. The weapons were used successfully against three dams in 1943. The earthquake bomb, or seismic bomb, was a separate but related concept that was separately invented by the British aeronautical engineer Barnes Wallis early in World War II and subsequently developed and used on land against strategic targets in Europe. The earthquake bomb also used the concept of an explosion in a dense medium. It differed somewhat in concept from traditional aircraft- borne bombs, which usually explode at or near the surface, and destroy their target directly by explosive force. By contrast, an earthquake bomb is dropped from very high altitude to gain more speed, and upon impact penetrates and explodes deep underground, causing massive caverns (camouflets) or craters as well as much more severe shockwaves. In this way, they can affect targets that are too massive to be affected by other types of conventional bomb, as well as difficult targets such as bridges and viaducts. Earthquake bombs were used towards the end of World War II for massively reinforced installations (e.g., submarine pens with concrete walls several meters thick, caverns, buried tunnels), and bridges.\\"Dam Busters, Paul Brickman.

Biography Gustavo Gabriel Levene was born on August 30, 1905, in San Fernando del Valle de Catamarca, Catamarca, Argentina where he begins his elementary studies, later moving to Buenos Aires, where he finishes his secondary studies. He enrolls at the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Buenos Aires but he later drops out. He then continued his studies at the Faculty of Humanities and Educational Science at the University of La Plata, from where he graduated with a professor's degree. As such, he holds several positions in different high schools, and was director of the Cangallo Schule school from 1962 to 1965. He was also assistant to the minister of education, and member of the editorial board of the Biblioteca de Mayo (May's Library) of the Senate. He was a prolific historian who conceived history from a human perspective through the common life of his historical characters, their traditions and beliefs. This point of view was unique during a time in which history was written based on heroic military facts or about people who were able to change the course of history. Among his works it stands out the New Argentine History, Costumbrist and Social View from the Conquest to Our Days () and History of the Argentine Presidents (Historia de los presidentes argentinos), the latter covering from Bernardino Rivadavia's presidency to the third presidency of Juan Domingo Per√≥n. His interpretation of the nation's history adheres to the liberal tradition, viewing the colonial period like an arid and unprogressive era, having in Bernardino Rivadavia his early nineteenth century hero, and viewing Juan Manuel de Rosas as a reactionary, defender of the colonial system who was useful for the British interests.Potash, Robert A., Book Review of La Argentina se Hizo As√≠, The Hispanic American Historical Review, Vol. 43, No. 3, Aug., 1963, pp. 445-446. He stepped into the historical playwright with Mariano Moreno, a play that won the First National Prize of Literature 1957. He went on to write other historical plays about the personalities of Jos√© de San Mart√≠n and Juan Mart√≠n de Pueyrred√≥n in The Unknown (El desconocido), Bernardino Rivadavia in Bernardino, Esteban Echeverr√≠a in The Tomorrow (El ma√±ana) and Lucio V. Mansilla in A Man at the Mirror (Un hombre ante el espejo). However, it is Childhood in Catamarca (Ni√±ez en Catamarca) his most known and piece of work, which is an autobiographic tale that has been adopted by many Argentine schools as a lecture book.

History There is some evidence that Soulseat Abbey is Viride Stagnum (\\"green loch\\"), that is, the Cistercian monastery founded by St Malachy somewhere in Galloway in 1148.\\"Soulseat Abbey\\", Canmore The name comes from the Gaelic word Sabhal, a word with many religious and monastic connotations. Perhaps because of Anglophone folk etymology, the name came to imply a connection to both Saul and the soul, taking the Latin form Sedes Animarum (\\"Seat of the Spirit\\"). Soulseat Loch takes its name from the Abbey, which was founded by Fergus, Lord of Galloway, for Premonstratensian canons regular, stood on a small peninsula in the loch. The abbey was apparently enclosed on the land side by a fosse or trench or canal which left it surrounded on all sides by water and therefore, relatively secure from attack of an enemy.\\"Soulseat Abbey\\", Scotland's Places Premonstratensian canons regular from Alnwick Abbey in Northumberland had founded Dryburgh Abbey, on the banks of the River Tweed on Martinmas 1150. The site of Soulseat Abbey (now a mound with five 16th-century gravestones thereon) is on the promontory of a loch with a very narrow isthmus, thus perhaps fitting the description. The Premonstratensian establishment certainly occurred before the death of King Fergus of Galloway, which took place in 1161. The Obituary of Pr√©montr√© lists both King Fergus and Christian, bishop of Galloway (1154-86), as joint founders. Probably because of the abbey's cultural isolation from Lowland Scotland, almost none of the abbots are known by name before the 15th century. It is known though that the abbey suffered devastation from wars in the 14th century. Control of the abbey became secularized in the 15th century, and even more so after the Scottish Reformation. In 1630, it was taken over by the parsonage of Portpatrick. The site is now protected as a scheduled monument.

It was the only election in Japan during the Pacific theater of World War II. At this time, the lower house no longer had any significant executive and legislative power, and power had increasingly gone to the military dictatorship since the \\"Manchurian Incident\\", the invasion of Manchuria by the Imperial Army without regard to the (then still civilian) cabinet in 1931. Since 1932 when Admiral Viscount Sait≈ç Makoto was appointed prime minister with the first so-called \\"national unity cabinet\\", few members of the political parties in the House of Representatives had any significant role in government. Overview The government of prime minister Hideki T≈çj≈ç held the election as a \\"General Election to Support the Greater East Asia War\\" at the end of April 1942, just days after the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo. In 1940, all political parties were forced to merge into the Imperial Rule Assistance Association (Taisei Yokusankai), a pro-military political organization headed by former prime minister Nobuyuki Abe. The likewise fascist Touhou Party broke away from the Taisei Yokusankai and turned against prime minister Hideki T≈çj≈ç. Among those running against the Taisei Yokunsakai, only the Touhou Party was allowed to run in the election as non-partisans. Among those anti-war and neutral politicians, the comparatively mild politicians successfully ran as non-partisans too. Some of those \\"independents\\" who failed to gain a seat were expelled. Those \\"independents\\" and expelled politicians were mainly the ruling class after the war. As communist groups, left-wing groups, and anti-war groups were illegal since 1940, they were unable to name a candidate in the election. Communists, left- wing politicians and radical anti-military politicians were arrested and not even allowed to run as independents, although anti-war politician Sait≈ç Takao who was expelled from the diet in 1941 was re-elected again. Notwithstanding the Tojo government's efforts, 613 candidates stood without endorsement while only 466 were endorsed. Several non-endorsed candidates managed to win seats in the election, including Ichiro Hatoyama (who later served as prime minister and was the grandfather of Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama), Takeo Miki (who later served as prime minister), Kan Abe (the grandfather of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe) and Bukichi Miki. The Tojo Cabinet marked those independent congressmen elected who were not Taisei Yokusankai members as \\"not endorsed\\" in the official result. Several of them, such as Hatoyama, were subject to the purge by the Allied authorities following the war despite the fact that they were not cooperating with the Tojo government. The turnout of the election was unusually high at 83.1%, partly reflecting the fierceness of the electoral battle. Results The government won 381 seats out of the total 466; in some districts, its candidates won uncontested. However, while the Imperial Army had gained a victory in almost every battle as of the election, public support for the war was still quite high, which was the main reason for the landslide victory of the Taisei Yokusankai. Although Japan nominally became a one-party state as a result of the election, the group of Yokusankai-endorsed candidates soon split into numerous factions, some of which became critical of the government as the war dragged on. {align=\\"center\\" border=\\"1\\" ! bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\" Party ! bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\" Total |----- Imperial Rule Assistance Association endorsed |381 |----- Not endorsed |85 |} References 1942 Category:1942 elections in Asia Category:1942 in Japan Category:Politics of the Empire of Japan Category:April 1942 events Category:One-party elections ","title":"1942 Japanese general election"},{"id":"8107605","text":"The Rebecca and John J.

It was at the peak of Mount Tachibana, extending in part into the Higashi-ku in Fukuoka. The castle is also known as Rikka-j≈ç, Tachibanayama-j≈ç, or Rikkasan-j≈ç (Á´ãËä±Â±±Âüé, Tachibana mountain castle). History Tachibana Castle The castle was originally built in 1330, by ≈åtomo Sadatoshi, Constable (shugo) of Bungo Province, as a show of support to the Tachibana clan. Since it was in a tactically powerful location, looking down upon the port town of Hakata, the castle was fought over throughout the Sengoku period by the ≈åtomo, ≈åuchi, and M≈çri clans. In one of the more significant sieges, the ≈åtomo clan lost the castle to the M≈çri clan in 1569, who had become one of the most skilled and powerful clans in the field of naval warfare; their use of Western-style cannon granted them a large advantage in this battle. They abandoned it soon afterwards, however, following a defeat at Tatarahama to an allied ≈åtomo-Amago clan force. The castle was besieged once more, in 1586, by the Shimazu family; the castle's lord at the time was Tachibana Muneshige. However, the Shimazu would fail in their siege and Muneshige successfully defended the castle. Soon after, Toyotomi Hideyoshi would arrive and launch his Ky≈´sh≈´ Campaign, which he would also gain the assistance of the ≈åtomo. After Hideyoshi's conquest of Ky≈´sh≈´ ended with the surrender of the Shimazu, Muneshige and his clan were given Yanagawa castle, whereas Tachibana Castle would be entrusted in the care of Kobayakawa Takakage. A little over a decade later, at the beginning of the Edo period, Tachibana was largely destroyed and dismantled, much of the stone going into the construction of Fukuoka Castle. Today, remnants of the honmaru (central keep), the wells and waterworks survive.

It was a flight from Frankfurt, Germany to Warsaw, Poland. Incident description A Lufthansa Airbus A320, similar to the accident aircraft. Illustration of time elapsed between touchdown of the first main strut, the second, and engagement of brakes. Lufthansa Flight 2904 was cleared to land at Okƒôcie International Airport Runway 11 and was informed of the existence of wind shear on the approach. To compensate for the crosswind, the pilots attempted to touch down with the aircraft banked slightly to the right. Additionally they landed with a speed about faster than usual. According to the manual, this was the correct procedure for the reported weather conditions, but the weather report was not up-to-date. At the moment of touchdown, the assumed crosswind turned out to be a tailwind. Due to the tailwind of approximately and the increased speed, the airplane hit the ground at approximately and far beyond the normal touch down point. The aircraft's right gear touched down from the runway threshold. The left gear touched down 9 seconds later, from the threshold. Only when the left gear touched the runway did the ground spoilers and engine thrust reversers start to deploy, these systems depending on oleo strut (shock absorber) compression. The wheel brakes, triggered by wheel rotation being equal to or greater than , began to operate about 4 seconds later. The remaining length of the runway (left from the moment when braking systems had begun to work) was too short to enable the aircraft to stop. Seeing the approaching end of the runway and the obstacle behind it, the pilot steered the aircraft off the runway to the right. The aircraft departed the runway at a speed of and rolled before it hit the embankment and an LLZ aerial with the left wing. A fire started in the left wing area and penetrated into the passenger cabin. Two of 70 occupants died in this accident, including the training captain (seated in the right seat) who died on impact and one passenger who was unable to escape because he lost consciousness as a result of the smoke in the cabin. Causes of the accident The main cause of the accident was incorrect decisions and actions of the flight crew. Some of the incorrect decisions were taken when information about wind shear was received by the crew. The wind shear was produced by the front passing over the airport, accompanied by intensive variation of wind parameters as well as by heavy rain on the runway itself. One additional cause was the lack of current wind information at the tower. For that reason no up-to-date wind information could be transmitted to the crew. Further additional causes were certain design features of the aircraft. Computer logic prevented the activation of both ground spoilers and thrust reversers until a minimum compression load of at least 6.3 tons was sensed on each main landing gear strut, thus preventing the crew from achieving any braking action by the two systems before this condition was met. Aircraft systems To ensure that the thrust-reverse system and the spoilers are only activated in a landing situation, the software has to be sure the airplane is on the ground even if the systems are selected mid-air. The spoilers are only activated if at least one of the following two conditions is true: * there must be weight of at least 6.3 tons on each main landing gear strut * the wheels of the plane must be turning faster than . The thrust reversers are only activated if the first condition is true. There is no way for the pilots to override the software decision and activate either system manually. In the case of the Warsaw accident neither of the first two conditions was fulfilled, so the most effective braking system was not activated. Point one was not fulfilled because the plane landed inclined (to counteract the anticipated crosswind). Thus the pressure of 12 tons on both landing gears combined required to trigger the sensor was not reached. Point two was not fulfilled due to a hydroplaning effect on the wet runway. Only when the left landing gear touched the runway did the automatic aircraft systems allow the ground spoilers and engine thrust reversers to operate. Due to the braking distances in the heavy rain the aircraft could not stop before the end of the runway. The computer did not actually know the aircraft had landed until it was already 125 meters beyond the halfway point of runway 11. Illustration of distance relative to main strut touchdown. The striped line marks 1400 m, which divides the runway in half. Red indicates the landing gear have not touched down, blue indicates hydroplaning, and green indicates wheels on the ground. Passengers and crew As a result of the impact a fire broke out and penetrated into the cabin, killing one of the passengers. The second pilot also died as a result of the collision. 51 people were seriously injured (including 2 crew members), 5 slightly injured.

The highway extends for across largely rural terrain from an intersection with NY 30A in the town of Johnstown to a junction with NY 30 in the town of Mayfield. The westernmost section of the route is known as East State Street Extension. NY 349 was assigned to the portion of its alignment between County Route 154 (CR 154; then NY 148) and NY 30\\\\. It was extended west to its present terminus in the mid-1950s after NY 148 was rerouted onto an arterial highway between Gloversville and Mayfield. Route description Western terminus of NY 349 NY 349 begins just east of the Gloversville city limits at an intersection with NY 30A (Adirondack Trail) in the town of Johnstown. It heads northeast as the two-lane East State Street Extension, passing by a line of homes as it leaves the Gloversville area. After , the number of residences surrounding the route begins to dwindle as the highway enters more rural areas. It continues to the hamlet of Dennies Crossing, where it meets CR 154, a connector leading north to NY 30A, which parallels NY 349 through this portion of Johnstown. Just east of the junction, NY 349 crosses a rail trail that was once the right-of-way of the Fonda, Johnstown and Gloversville Railroad. Past Dennies Crossing, the highway takes on a slightly southeastern alignment into the town of Mayfield, where it traverses progressively less developed and more forested areas. About into the town, the route makes a northeastward turn, crossing the FJ&G; Rail Trail once again and serving a handful of homes before ending at an intersection with NY 30 in Red Bunch Corners, a small community south of the village of Mayfield and north of the larger hamlet of Vail Mills. The route serves mostly as a local connector highway, handling just over 3,000 vehicles per day on average. History On June 5, 1901, the state of New York let a contract to improve of highway in the towns of Johnstown and Mayfield‚Äîincluding the portion of modern NY 349 west of what is now CR 154‚Äîto state highway standards. The project cost $30,952 (equivalent to $ in ) and was completed by mid-1903. The highways improved by the project were added to the state highway system on July 24, 1903, as State Highway 33 (SH 33). A contract to improve the of modern NY 349 between CR 154 and the former Fonda, Johnstown and Gloversville Railroad was awarded on September 1, 1906. In all, the project cost $17,980 (equivalent to $ in ) and took approximately two years to complete. The improved roadway was accepted into the state highway system on October 8, 1908, as SH 248. The section of what is now NY 349 between the old railroad line and current NY 30 was improved and designated as SH 1935 by the state sometime after 1926. In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route 24, an unsigned legislative route that initially extended from Fonda to Speculator via Gloversville and Mayfield. From Gloversville to Mayfield, Route 24 was routed on SH 33, which broke from East State Street at modern CR 154 and followed CR 154 toward Mayfield. In the mid-1920s, all of legislative Route 24's original routing was designated as part of NY 54, a U-shaped route that began in Utica and passed through Poland, Wilmurt, Speculator, and Gloversville before ending in Fonda. NY 54 was broken up into a handful of routes as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. The portion of the route south of Mayfield became the northern half of NY 148, a new north‚Äìsouth highway that continued past Fonda to Central Bridge. Meanwhile, SH 248 and SH 1935 were designated as NY 349 by the following year. In the mid-1950s, NY 148 was realigned between Gloversville and Mayfield to follow a new arterial highway located just north of its original alignment. The former routing of NY 148 along East State Street became part of an extended NY 349.

4,563) is a community located in south-central Chatham-Kent, Ontario, Canada.  History  By 1783, there were French settlers in Detroit and Windsor. There were also settlers in the Niagara and Kingston region, but no real settlers to speak of in the Kent County region. In 1790, Alexander McKee negotiated Treaty #2 of 1790 with Pottowatomie, Huron, Chippewa, and Ottawa leaders in Detroit to acquire what is now Southwestern Ontario. With this area now being British-owned, settlers began moving rapidly into this new land area, and eventually, the County of Kent, and Blenheim. Land began being surveyed in 1791 in Harwich township under the order of Lt.-Col. John Graves-Simcoe. Joining his crew was a man named Thomas Talbot who expressed great interest in this land, and Simcoe granted him any plot of land he so desired. He decided on a plot where present day Fingal resides. Being a man with substantial finances, he set out to begin road- building in Southwestern Ontario in 1800. His main road was designed to go all the way to Detroit. It consequently ran directly along a ridge of high land, and on that ridge is where present-day Blenheim stands. The great Talbot Project was suspended until the end of the War of 1812. After the War of 1812, North American settlers began arriving in this area to live peaceful lives after a violent war, as did settlers who came from England after a European war with France. After timber clearing, this land was ready for growth. Blenheim itself was established in 1825-1850. It was amidst of dense forest, and its development lagged behind other nearby settlements. Albert Robertson purchased this land, and after the real estate traded hands over a few years, Harvey Halstead, Thomas Lynch, and George Hughson were recorded as the first three lot-tenants who built homes. This \\"Ten Mile Bush\\" was a dense Carolinian forest with wild elk, bear, wolves, and eagles inhabiting the region.Hamil, Fred Coyne. (1951).The Valley of the Lower Thames: 1640 to 1850.Toronto: University of Toronto Press. 15, 258, 310. When the forests were cut down for farming, the bush became a \\"patchwork quilt of farms\\"Armstrong, Alvin. (1985).The First 200 Years of Blenheim and South Harwich. Blenheim: Blenheim News Tribune. 10. Even a minor inspection of the contemporary area reveals acres of farms still in operation, but the elk, bear, and wolves are long gone. Some believe that Blenheim was named after Blenheim Palace in England. However, articles written by historian Dr. Fred Landon in The News Tribune dated February 7, 1934 recount a party in the early days of the settlement, at which local resident Mungo Samson gave a well-received recitation of the poem \\"The Battle of Blenheim.\\" This accordingly, is where the town got its name. Blenheim, Ontario had a general store by 1845. However, the town was not incorporated until 1885, some 40 years later. In 1837 James W. Little, a militia officer and land speculator of neighbouring Raleigh Township, purchased land at the intersection of Ridge Road and Communication Road, the latter planned by Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe to connect the town of Chatham with Lake Erie. The area consisted of fertile farmland noted for sugar beets, tomatoes, tobacco, and corn. Blenheim's primary resource was timber. Once the bush was cleared adequately in about 1900, farming superseded timber as the key resource of Blenheim due to the area's rich soil and ideal climate. By 1874, Blenheim had a full list of occupants varying in professions from dentistry to carpentry. In 1866, a town hall was built, fit for a village which was ready to emerge as an important voice in Kent County. Blenheim became an official town in 1885. In 1888, a church for the large Methodist population was built. The telephone was introduced to Blenheim in 1885 by Bell. Electricity came in 1888. A full-fledged fire department arrived in 1891. The railway arrived in 1894 and traveled through Blenheim to Windsor. The first high school was built in 1900. As cars became increasingly popular, Blenheim paved its first street in 1920, which opened a period of enormous growth. The Prohibition gave Blenheim a chance to grow, as many men were involved in illegal rum-running operations for larger centres. In 1924, W.G. Thompson opened a grain mill for local farmers, which is still present today. Blenheim grew through the \\"Starving 30s\\", and the \\"War-Torn 40s\\". The period of 1950 to the present time has seen Blenheim mature into a town of 4,800. Blenheim became a part of the Municipality of Chatham-Kent during the 1998 amalgamation of Kent County and its municipalities. Up until 1988, Blenheim had its own elected officials with: a mayor, two reeves, and six councillors. The current Mayor of Chatham-Kent is Darrin Canniff. In the municipality of Chatham-Kent, Blenheim is a part of the South-Kent region which is represented by 3 councillors: Anthony Ceccacci, Mary Clare Latimer, and Trevor Thompsonn.

This compares with 5.8% in Ontario, and almost 5.6% for Canada overall. In the five years between 1996 and 2001, the population of Blenheim declined by 1.9%, compared with an increase of 6.1% for Ontario as a whole.  Religion  *Protestant: 59.0% *Catholic: 26.1% *Other Christian: 3.6% *Other religions: 0% *No religious affiliation: 11.2%  Language  *English: 93.4% *French: 1.3% *French and English: 0.2% *Other: 5.1%  Immigration  *Canada-born population: 91.4% *Foreign-born population: 8.1% *Non-permanent residents: 0.5%  Education  Blenheim's elementary and secondary schools are under the control of two school boards, the Lambton Kent District School Board and the St. Clair Catholic District School Board.  Elementary schools  *Harwich-Raleigh Public School is the \\"rural\\" public school. It offers Junior Kindergarten to Grade 8. H.R.P.S offers both English and French Immersion programs.

B.D.H.S is home of the Blenheim Bobcats, and their colours are Black and Gold (yellow). The population of the school has declined in recent year and is currently under 500 students. The population decline is due to declining populations trend in Chatham-Kent. As well, the decline can be attributed to the loss of students from H.R.P.S, who half of which now attend Chatham-Kent Secondary School because of the Lambton-Kent District School Board's unwillingness to put a French Immersion program in the Blenheim High School, resulting in students to have to choose between staying in Blenheim or continuing to pursue French immersion. **B.D.H.S. offers a variety of Clubs and Athletics including: Student Union, Sears Drama, Musicals, Redfeather events, Volleyball, Basketball, Football, Cross-Country, Golf, Tennis, Curling, Rugby, Track & Field, and Badminton.

E. vespertilio foliage. Erythrina vespertilio habit Erythrina vespertilio is a tree native to north and north-east Australia. Its common names are grey corkwood, bat's wing coral tree, yulbah and the more ambiguous \\"bean tree\\". In the Western Desert language it is also known as ininti. Description The small tree has a straggly habit and typically grows to a height of . The trunk has a diameter of approximately . It has thorns on the trunk and branches with bark that is deeply furrowed and corky and creamy-grey in colour. That leaves are bifoliolate or trifoliolate and are long. The leaflets have a broad wedge-shape with three lobes, resembling a bat's open wings. The leaflets are long and wide. The species is deciduous in the dry season. The tree blooms between August and September producing scarlet to orange-red pea flowers that are long are found on terminal racemes in length. The flowers have a calyx that is long and petals that are about long. There are usually ten stamens. Flowering usually occurs when the tree is leafless. The seeds resemble beans and are orange to dark yellow in colour with a length of about found in pods that are long and wide. Distribution E. vespertilio is found on all mainland states except Victoria, mainly in open woodlands but extends to arid areas and rainforest margins. It is found in the Kimberley, Pilbara and northern Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia. throughout most of the Northern Territory and Queensland, northern South Australia and north eastern New South Wales. It found in an altitudinal range from near sea level to . It grows in a wide range of soils as long as drainage is good and it has a position in full sun. Classification The species was first formally described by the botanist George Bentham in 1848 as part of Thomas Mitchell's work Journal of an Expedition into the Interior of Tropical Australia. There are two synonyms Corallodendron vespertilio and Erythrina biloba, and the name of this species is often misapplied to Erythrina numerosa. There are two known subspecies: * Erythrina vespertilio subsp. biloba F.Muell. & A.R.Bean * Erythrina vespertilio subsp. vespertilio Uses It was widely traditionally used by Aboriginal Australians in Central Australia for making woomeras and coolamons. The Warlpiri, among others, would use the wood to make shields, used either for warfare or ceremonially. These shields could then be used for making fire with the friction method. The bark is also considered to have traditional medicinal uses. The fruit contains alkaloids and the stem contains isoflavonoids. Phaseollidin (a flavonoid) showed cytotoxic activities in vitro against prostate cancer cell lines at high doses.Iranshahi M., Vu H., Pham N., Zencak D., Forster P., Quinn R.J.,\\"Cytotoxic evaluation of alkaloids and isoflavonoids from the Australian tree erythrina vespertilio\\".

Description It is a shrub that reaches 1‚Äì2 m and grows in hedges or forms thickets. The leaves are pinnate, have 3‚Äì5 leaflets, each leaflet 2.5‚Äì6 cm long and 1‚Äì3 cm broad. In the wild species (sometimes listed as Rosa chinensis var. spontanea), the flowers have five pink to red petals. The fruit is a red hip 1‚Äì2 cm diameter. The strong, stalk-round branches have an almost bare, purplish-brown bark and there may be many to no curved, stocky, flat spines. The alternately arranged leaves are divided into petiole and leaf blade and a total of 5 to 11 inches long. The petiole and the rhachis are sparsely spiked and glandular-fluffy hairy. The pinnate leaf blades usually have three or five, rarely seven pinna leaflet. The leaflets are at a length of 2.5 to 6 centimeters and a width of 1 to 3 centimeters wide ovate or ovate-oblong with weak-rounded or broad-wedge-shaped base, more or less long tapered upper end and sharply sawn edge. The leaf top is shiny dark green and leaves are almost bare. The stipulesare fused with the petiole on most of their length. The free area of the stipules is rooted, having entire margins with pointed upper end and often glandular-fluffy hairy.Gu Cuizhi & Kenneth R.

Inflorescence left The flowering time ranges in China from April to September. Rarely, the flowers are solitary, usually four or five bundles together. The 2.5 to 6 cm long pedicel is hairy almost bald or glandular- fluffy. The one to three bare bracts are linear with a pointed upper end and smooth or glandular margin. The flowers have a mild fragrance. The hermaphrodite flowers have radial symmetry with a diameter of 4 to 5 centimeters and are divided with double perianth. There are cultivated forms with simple to more or less strongly filled flowers, which are also wild in China and other areas of temperate latitudes. The bald flower cup (hypanthium) is egg-shaped-spherical or pear-shaped. The early dropping sepals are ovate or sometimes foliage-like, simple or lobed with a dished upper end and bald on the underside and hairy on the top shaggy. The depending on the form five to several or many petals are white over pink to red or purple, obovate with a wedge-shaped base and a polished upper end. There are many stamens present. The free, hairy styluses tower over the petals and are almost as long as the stamens. In China, the rose hips ripen from June to November and turn red. The bald rose hip is egg-shaped or pear-shaped with a diameter of 1 to 2 centimeters.Heinrich Schultheis: Roses: the best types and varieties for the garden , p. 58, Ulmer: Stuttgart 1996, Cultivation Various forms of Rosa chinensis have been cultivated in gardens in China for a long time; therefore it is not easy to separate between wild forms and cultivated forms. Many varieties of garden roses have been bred from Rosa chinensis. The species is extensively cultivated as an ornamental plant, originally in China, and numerous cultivars have been selected which are known as the China roses. It has also been extensively interbred with Rosa gigantea to produce Rosa √ó odorata and by further hybridization the tea roses and hybrid tea roses, and is the source of the so-called \\"rising\\" varieties, that is to say, with continuous flowering, or blooming in summer.Ute Bauer: Old Roses: History, Use, Design, Nursing Practice , p. 14, BLV: Munich 2004, Varieties Three varieties of the species are recognized in the Flora of China:Flora of China: Rosa chinensis * R. chinensis var. chinensis, originated in cultivation, with red petals * R. chinensis var. spontanea, native to Guizhou, Hubei, and Sichuan, with red petals * R. chinensis var. semperflorens (Curtis) Koehne, originated in cultivation, with dark red or purple petals Uses Cultivars developed from Rosa chinensis have been important in the breeding of many modern garden roses by providing the repeat-blooming characteristic, although this is not a feature of the wild species. The many forms of Rosa chinensis are also used in many other ways. The young vegetative plant parts, flower buds and flowers are brewed and eaten as a kitchen herb, for example, as a soup. From the rosehips, a thin fleshy layer that surrounds the seeds is eaten raw or cooked. The seed hair must be removed; It has to be handled very carefully. The seed hairs must not get into the mouth and throat. The seeds are a good source of vitamin E. The seeds can be ground and mixed with flour or added to other foods.Wu Zheng-yi & Peter H.

Few historical records survive which detail Elizabeth Polack's life. Although neither the year nor place of her birth have been noted, documentation of her activity as a playwright active in London between 1830 and 1838 remains for posterity. Contemporary records credit her with five plays, only two of which, Esther, the Royal Jewess; or The Death of Haman and St. Clair of the Isles; or The Outlaw of Barra, have survived. Alberti, or, the Mines of India was performed at the Royal Pavilion on 10 May 1834 and then believed to be by Polack. Esther, with a story taken from the Old Testament, and considered in its time to be a type of an \\"Exotic East\\" melodrama, was successfully produced in 1835 at London's Royal Pavilion Theatre, Whitechapel in the East End (the Pavilion was later a centre for Yiddish theatre in London). St. Clair (1838), based on an 1803 novel by Elizabeth Helme, met, however, with a very modest reception. Polack's aunt, Maria Polack, was one of the first Jewish women writers in England. Polack may have been a relation of Joel Samuel Polack, the first Jewish settler of New Zealand. Joel's biographer writes that he lived with his sister in Piccadilly when he first returned to England; that sister may have been Elizabeth. No other details have emerged regarding Elizabeth Polack, including the year, place and circumstances of her death.

After the war Hayit settled down in West Germany, where he enrolled in the subjects science of history, orientalism and Islamic sciences at the University of M√ºnster. Since then he was committed to the studies about his home region Turkestan. He received his PhD Doctor of Philosophy in 1950 and published his thesis ‚ÄúDie Nationalen Regierungen von Kokand und der Alasch Orda.‚Äù He married a young doctor from Cologne named Ruth in the same year. The couple had two sons, Ertay and Mirza, and a daughter, Dilber. From the 1950s until his death Hayit wrote dozens of articles and 15 acclaimed books in German, English, and Turkish on the history of Turkestan (the now independent republics of Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and the Chinese province of Xinjiang). His major works are \\"Turkestan im XX. Jahrhundert\\" (1956), \\"Sowjetrussische Orientpolitik am Beispiel Turkestans\\" (1962), \\"Die Wirtschaftsprobleme Turkestans\\", (1968), \\"Turkestan zwischen Russland und China\\", (1971) and \\"Basmatschi: Nationaler Kampf Turkestans in den Jahren 1917 bis 1934\\", (1992). Hayit taught at several universities around the world. He worked as an assistant at the University of London, and he worked as a lecturer at Harvard University, Hacettepe University in Ankara, University of Istanbul and Marmara University in Istanbul. Hayit was a strong advocate for the independence and unification of the Soviet and Chinese-controlled parts of Central Asia.Jacob M. Landau. Pan-Turkism: from irredentism to cooperation. London:C Hurst & Co (Publishers) Ltd, 1995.p 121. His work was vilified in the Soviet Union. Even in independent Uzbekistan discussing it was controversial, and Hayit was vilified by president Islam Karimov for being a traitor to his motherland. In other parts of the world his work was appreciated because of the huge political and historical relevance of his theses. Hayit was one of the very few historians who was committed to Turkestanian history at large. Especially in the Turkish-speaking world he gained a high reputation. In 2004 he was given an honorary doctorate for his lifetime work by the Technical University of Istanbul. Hayit died at the age of 88 in Cologne on 31 October 2006. Partial list of published works Works were published under the names Baymirza Hayit and B. Hayit.

It plays host to a variety of motorsport events including car racing, motorcycle racing, car sprints, stage rallies and drifting. It opened as a fully licensed MSA and ACU championship racing circuit in 1997. In 2006, the motorsports venue saw a major overhaul, with the majority of its circuit being scrapped in favour of a radical new development that includes four different track layouts: a International Circuit; Coastal Circuit, 1.2 miles National Circuit and 0.8 mile Club Circuit. One of the straights on the circuit is named after Wales's only F1 driver, Tom Pryce, who was killed in an accident during the South African Grand Prix at Kyalami in 1977 when a track marshal carrying a fire extinguisher ran across the track in front of him. The extinguisher hit Pryce in the head, and both he and the marshal died. The TV motoring programme Fifth Gear regularly used the Anglesey circuit for the 'Shoot Out' segment of the show. Since the new track configuration, Fifth Gear has opted to use the Coastal layout. The Coastal layout appears to be the most popular among track day enthusiasts because of the difficult downhill corkscrew segment.

Settlements are said to have started here from 1930s (approximate) Chempanthotty is located 21 km away from Taliparamba in Kannur district. The geography and landscape of Chempanthotty is featured with terrains and hilly distributions. People living in Chempanthotty are mostly migrated from Kottayam, Pala and Ernakulam ( Central Travancore) as the part of mass migration (Kudiyettam) took place in 1944. St. George Syro-Malabar Christian Catholic Church Established in 1954 (blessed by Mar Sebastian Valloppilly) is located in the heart of the village on a small hill. There are also two convents in the village: F. C. Convent (founded 1959) and C. S. N. Convent (founded 2001). Gurukulam is situated at Pallam.

The hard work of the migrants made Chempanthotty a big town with almost all the facilities to meet the basic needs of its population. Now the town has become a hub of action. Economy The mainstay of the people of this place is agriculture. With the hike in price of rubber, the economic condition of most of the families has improved. The main crops grown are rubber, coconut, pepper, cashew, tapioca, arecanut, and other plantation crops. Rubber occupies the largest area among plantation crops. Next to rubber, coconut is the most popular crop. Cashew is yet another important plantation. Arecanut stands in the fourth place Among spices, pepper occupies an important place. Pepper is mostly grown as an inter-crop with coconut, arecanut and various fruit trees. In the hilly surroundings of Chempanthotty like Sreekandapuram and Naduvil, the inter- cultivation is done with rubber and cashew. But now the scene is slowly changing. Now a number of youngsters seek employment in gulf countries and in other cities of India. Climate Chempanthotty has a humid climate with an oppressive hot season from March till the end of May. This is followed by the South-West monsoon which continues till the end of September. October and November are the months for the North East Monsoon or Thulamazha.

Their disappearances and deaths are recounted in the Investigation Discovery series A Crime to Remember (Season 1 Episode 3). Background Curtis Chillingworth was born October 24, 1896 to a prominent family in West Palm Beach, Florida. He graduated from the University of Florida in 1917, and later that same year was admitted to the Florida Bar. After graduating, Chillingworth served at the naval base in Key West, then attended the United States Naval Academy, where he received a commission to serve on the gunboat USS Annapolis. During World War I he served as an ensign aboard the USS Minneapolis. After the war, Chillingworth returned to West Palm Beach to practice law with his father. In 1921, he began his career as county judge at age 24. He became the newly elected circuit judge in 1923, holding the position for thirty-two years until his death in 1955. He married Marjorie M. McKinley, a Cornell University student and daughter of old friends of the Chillingworth family. Chillingworth remained in the U.S. Naval Reserves and was recalled to active duty in 1942. During World War II, he was stationed in London and Plymouth, England, where he participated in planning the occupation and recovery of Germany. He was released from active duty in 1945 as a full Commander. A neighborhood park in West Palm Beach is named in honor of Chillingworth. Disappearance Chillingworth and his wife were last seen at a dinner in West Palm Beach on the evening of June 14, 1955. They left the dinner about 10p.m. for their Manalapan home. They went to bed expecting a carpenter to arrive in the morning of June 15 to build a playground for their grandchildren. The carpenter arrived at 8a.m. and observed that the Chillingworths' door had been left open and that their home appeared to be empty. Later that same day, Chillingworth failed to appear as scheduled at a 10a.m. hearing at the courthouse in West Palm Beach. Police investigation An accidental drowning during a morning swim was quickly ruled out, and $40 found to be in Marjorie's pocketbook ruled out robbery. The keys were still in the ignition of Chillingworth's Plymouth automobile. No further clues were obtained and (at that point) the case went cold. The couple were declared legally dead in 1957. Several suspects were considered, including Charles Nelson, brother of Chillingworth's friend Trapper Nelson, whose trial for murder Chillingworth had presided over. Judge Peel In June 1955, municipal judge Joseph Peel was slated to appear in court to answer charges of unethical conduct in a divorce case, for which he faced possible disbarment. Peel had used his elected position to protect bolita operators and moonshiners by giving them advance warnings of raids in return for financial consideration. Disbarment would mean the loss of his position and therefore his lucrative illegal racket. Peel had a previous run-in with Chillingworth in 1953, when Chillingworth had reprimanded him as he represented both sides in an earlier divorce case; Chillingworth warned Peel that he would get no second chance. In a panic, Peel hired Floyd \\"Lucky\\" Holzapfel, a known criminal and carpenter's apprentice, to murder Chillingworth and his wife. On the night of June 14, Holzapfel and an accomplice named Bobby Lincoln went to Manalapan and landed on the beach behind the Chillingworths' house around 1a.m. Lincoln crouched in the bushes as Holzapfel knocked on the door. The judge answered in his pajamas. Holzapfel pulled a pistol from under his shirt and forced the judge and his wife into the boat. After the boat drifted for about an hour, the couple were thrown overboard with lead weights strapped to their legs. In 1959, Holzapfel bragged to a friend, James Yenzer, that he knew who had killed the Chillingworths, and in September 1960, Yenzer and a friend, ex-West Beach police officer Jim Wilber, lured Holzapfel to a hotel in Melbourne. Yenzer and Wilber managed to get Holzapfel drunk and discuss what he knew of the murders. Unbeknown to Holzapfel, a member of the Florida Sheriff's Bureau, tipped off by Yenzer and Wilber, was in an adjacent room in the hotel capturing his comments on tape. Arrests and convictions Holzapfel was arrested on October 1, 1960, and on December 12, he pleaded guilty to both murders. He was sent to death row, but his death sentence was commuted in 1966; he died in prison thirty years later. On March 30, 1961,Joseph Peel at Murderpedia. Accessed 21 May 2020. Peel was found guilty of accessory to murder. He received two life sentences, but was paroled in 1982 while in seriously ill health, and died just nine days later. Lincoln finished his federal prison term in Michigan in 1962.

The piece is built around several distinct themes. The first appears in the woodwinds and strings; the second is presented by the English horn, while the third is scored for violas against figures and chords in the woodwinds and lower strings. This is worked out vigorously before the piece is concluded by a new theme, first from the violins and repeated by the woodwinds. The published score of the fantasy contains two quotations which provide some clue as to its emotional content. The first is a couplet by Dante Gabriel Rossetti: :All are my blooms; and all sweet blooms of love. :To thee I gave while Spring and Summer sang. The origin of the second quote is unknown. It reads: > Roses, lilies, and a thousand scented flowers. Bright butterflies, flitting > from petal to petal. Beneath the shade of ancient trees, a quiet river with > water lilies. In a boat, almost hidden, two people. A thrush is singing in > the distance. The first broadcast performance was conducted by Edward Clark.

While the DVDPlay executable still resides in %Windir%\\\\system32, it simply executes Windows Media Player.

Smirnoff, a native of Mill Valley, California, a suburb of San Francisco, arrived in Oxford after his BMW sedan broke down in the midst of a cross-country excursion in late 1987. While waiting for the car to be repaired, he secured a job at the independent Oxford bookstore Square Books. At the bookstore, he met writers who passed through on author tours and local authors like John Grisham, Larry Brown, Barry Hannah, and Willie Morris. Smirnoff thus decided that the South needed a general interest magazine like The Atlantic Monthly or The New Yorker which focused on regional writers and culture. Smirnoff then began an in-depth study of the history of magazines in America at the University of Mississippi main library and read back issues of American general interest magazines. The name \\"Oxford American\\" is a play on The American Mercury, H. L. Mencken's general interest magazine which Smirnoff long admired. Once he decided to start the magazine, Smirnoff wrote letters to American writers like John Updike, Richard Ford, Charles Bukowski, and William Steig to ask for contributions to the magazine. As a result, many writers donated work to the debut issue without requiring payment. Financed entirely through credit cards, donations from Smirnoff's friends and family, the magazine's debut issue was published on Saturday, March 14, 1992. The cover of the first issue featured a fire-engine red background with white text and a \\"photo-realistic\\" painting by Oxford painter Glennray Tutor of an abandoned gasoline pump. Three more issues were published, including one featuring previously unpublished photographs by Eudora Welty. The magazine then ceased publication in mid-1994 for lack of funding. Second and third publication In April 1995, author and Oxford resident John Grisham secured financing to bring the magazine back into publication. The magazine had a new look and was printed on coated paper stock with a higher page count and new advertisers. In 2000, Grisham published a serialized version of A Painted House in the Oxford American. Although the magazine had a successful following, it was still not a successful business venture and in September 2001 stopped publication for a second time. The magazine began its third incarnation in late 2002 and was headquartered in Little Rock, Arkansas. The magazine was published in conjunction with the AtHome, Inc., group of magazines. Due to insufficient advertising revenue, it again stopped publication in late 2003. Present incarnation After $500,000 in financing was secured, the University of Central Arkansas in Conway, Arkansas, assumed the role as publisher and the magazine began publication once again in December 2004 as a quarterly. The magazine's editorial offices are on the first floor of Main Hall on the university grounds. In 2008, a business secretary was discovered to have been embezzling money from the magazine since 2007. The secretary, who reported to the magazine's publisher Ray Wittenberg, pleaded guilty to theft and forgery and was briefly imprisoned and ordered to pay $102,000 in restitution to the magazine. In the aftermath of the embezzlement, the University of Central Arkansas demoted Wittenberg, loaned the magazine additional funds and assumed control of the business operations of the magazine, instituting the university's spokesman, Warwick Sabin, as publisher. In February 2009, a \\"mystery donor\\" gave the magazine $100,000 to repay the IRS debt incurred as a result of the embezzlement. In July 2012, a few weeks before Issue 78 of the magazine was published, several editorial employees (including a recently fired senior editor and a recently fired intern) made allegations of sexual harassment against founder/editor Marc Smirnoff and managing editor Carol Ann Fitzgerald. Within a week, the two were fired and publisher Warwick Sabin became interim editor.Editor Fired Following Harassment Accusation by Julie Bosman. The New York Times. 8 August 2012 Smirnoff and Fitzgerald denied the allegations made against them and said they were not given a chance to defend themselves. One reporter concluded that \\"The Oxford American board didn‚Äôt have any clear misbehavioral conduct by Sminoff with which to warrant termination.\\" Smirnoff and Fitzgerald maintain that the allegations against them were the retaliatory actions of disgruntled employees and that they were not given a chance to defend themselves. In September 2012, when Roger D. Hodge replaced Warwick Sabin as the magazine's editor, Samir Husni, a journalism professor at the University of Mississippi and a former consultant to the magazine speculated on the uncertain future of the \\"iconic\\" magazine without its founder, Smirnoff. In December 2012, the New York Times remarked that Smirnoff had been 'the most important editor out of the South since Willie Morris.\\" Hodge stepped down in May 2015. In October 2015, Eliza Born√© was named editor. In October 2012, the Oxford American and the University of Central Arkansas renewed its alliance for five years on the understanding that the magazine will repay its debt, currently at $700,000, to the university. The magazine's chairman of the board, Richard N. Massey, pledged to repay the debt at a rate of about $69,000 a year over about five years. In January 2016, Ryan Harris was named Executive Director of the Oxford American Literary Project, the non- profit organization that publishes the magazine. In 2017, the Oxford American Literary Project announced the Oxford American Jeff Baskin Writers Fellowship, \\"to support the writing of a debut book of creative nonfiction.\\" Molly McCully Brown was named the inaugural recipient of the fellowship, which includes a $10,000 living stipend, housing, and an editorial apprenticeship with the Oxford American. The magazine has won four National Magazine Awards, including a National Magazine Award in General Excellence (in February 2016), and is noted for its annual Southern music issue, which includes a complimentary CD. It has also featured previously unpublished work by William Faulkner, Margaret Walker, James Agee, and James Dickey. In 2017, the magazine published a special 25th anniversary issue, garnering praise from Washington Post book critic Ron Charles, who described the Oxford American as a \\"regional magazine that defies the regional label.\\" Across three issues that year, the magazine published excerpts of Jesmyn Ward's novel Sing, Unburied, Sing, which went on to win the 2017 National Book Award in Fiction. In March 2018, the Oxford American published its 100th issue, featuring an original cover painting by Wayne White.

He played college football at Louisiana State University, and was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the first round of the 2007 NFL Draft. He played for the Chiefs from 2007 to 2014. He led the NFL in receiving touchdowns with 15 in 2010, earning Pro Bowl and Second Team All-Pro honors. He also played for the Cleveland Browns in 2015. Early years Bowe and his older brother were raised by their paternal grandparents in Miami, Florida. He was not involved in sports until his junior year in high school, when Bowe decided to join the high school football team at Miami Norland High School. College career LSU Tigers Bowe accepted an offer from Nick Saban to play football for Louisiana State University. He ranks among LSU's all-time best wide receivers, at one point holding the school's single-season record for touchdown receptions (has since been passed by Ja'Marr Chase, Justin Jefferson, and Terrace Marshall Jr. in 2019). Bowe appeared in 13 games as a backup for the Tiger's 2003 BCS national championship team. His sophomore year at LSU was his breakout season. After the departure of wide receivers Michael Clayton and Devery Henderson to the NFL, Bowe was poised to become a starter for the Tigers. In the opening game of the year versus Oregon State, Bowe caught a pass from Jamarcus Russell for a 38-yard touchdown strike that sent the game into overtime. The Tigers won that game, and Bowe finished second on the team in receiving yards while becoming one of Russell's favorite targets along with Skyler Green, Early Doucet, and Craig \\"Buster\\" Davis. In his junior season (2005), Bowe led the team in receptions, averaging 17.3 yards per catch and setting an LSU record by catching a touchdown pass in seven straight games. Bowe caught the game winner versus Alabama that year, giving LSU a 16‚Äì13 OT win in Tuscaloosa. Bowe's senior season (2006) was his best yet. Not only did he lead the team in receptions (65 receptions for 990 yards), he also set another LSU school record with 12 touchdown catches on the year. Bowe led a trio of receivers including Doucet and Davis that combined for 180 catches, 2,598 yards, and 24 touchdowns. Professional career 2007 NFL Draft Regarded as one of the top wide receivers available in the 2007 NFL Draft, Bowe drew comparisons to Hines Ward. He was selected 23rd overall by the Kansas City Chiefs. Alongside his former teammates JaMarcus Russell and Buster Davis, the trio became the first quarterback/wide receiving group to be selected in the first round of the draft. Kansas City Chiefs 2007 season On August 5, 2007, Bowe signed a five-year contract with the Chiefs, after holding out the first week of practice at training camp.Chiefs' top pick Bowe ends holdout ESPN.com, August 5, 2007. Bowe scored on a pass from Damon Huard in the first half of the game against the Chicago Bears on September 16, 2007. In his rookie season, Bowe led all first-year receivers in receptions (70), yards (995), and touchdowns (6). His reception and yardage totals set franchise records for Chiefs' rookie receivers. Bowe also set the team's single-game rookie receiving record with 164 yards against the San Diego Chargers on September 30, 2007. 2008 season In the season opener of the 2008 season, Bowe recorded five receptions for eighty‚Äìnine yards, but he also dropped 4 passes, including a game‚Äìwinning catch in the endzone on first and goal. He went on to obtain 1,022 yards receiving and ended the season 4th in the NFL with 86 receptions. In his last game of the 2008 season Bowe gained 103 yards with 10 receptions. 2009 season Playing with new quarterback Matt Cassel, Bowe finished the season with 589 receiving yards and four touchdowns in 11 games. On November 17, 2009, Bowe was suspended for 4 games for violation of the NFL's substance abuse policy, after he tested positive for a diuretic. 2010 season Chiefs in 2010. Bowe got off to a slow start in Chiefs' 2010 campaign, catching only 9 passes in the team's first 4 games. In the Chiefs' fourth game against the Indianapolis Colts, Bowe dropped crucial passes including one in the endzone which would have given them the lead, as the Chiefs' suffered their first loss 9‚Äì19. On October 17, 2010, Bowe caught 6 passes for 108 yards and 2 touchdowns against the Houston Texans in a game that the Chiefs lost 31‚Äì35. The following week was prolific for Bowe once again, as he hauled in 3 receptions for 81 yards and 2 touchdowns in a 42‚Äì20 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. In Week 8 against the Buffalo Bills he caught 3 passes for only 16 yards but again found the endzone, helping his team win against the Buffalo Bills, 13‚Äì10. In Week 9's match-up with the Oakland Raiders he caught 5 passes for 63 yards, adding another touchdown as well. The Chiefs went on to lose the game in overtime, 20‚Äì23. On November 14, 2010, almost a year after his drug suspension, Bowe set new career-highs for receptions and receiving yards in a single game versus the Denver Broncos. As the Broncos took a 35‚Äì0 lead, the Chiefs were forced to air it out. Bowe was targeted 18 times and caught 13 passes for 186 yards. He had 2 touchdowns as well. That was Bowe's fifth straight game with a touchdown reception. The Chiefs lost the game, 29‚Äì49. In Week 11, against the struggling Arizona Cardinals Bowe extended his streak to six straight games with a touchdown, this time coming up with 2.

The following week, in the first half against the Seattle Seahawks Bowe caught 8 passes while gaining 120 yards. Two of the receptions went for touchdowns. In the second half, he added five more receptions, including his third touchdown of the game. He extended his streak to 7 straight games with a score, thus breaking the Kansas City Chiefs franchise record of 6 straight games with a touchdown. Bowe also broke the Chiefs' franchise record for most touchdowns in a single season during the game against the Seattle Seahawks in week 12. He was invited to the 2011 Pro Bowl. He was also named a Second Team All-Pro by the Associated Press. 2011 season He finished the 2011 season with 81 receptions, 1,159 receiving yards, and 5 receiving touchdowns. 2012 season On March 5, 2012, the Chiefs placed a non-exclusive franchise tag on Bowe. On August 17, Bowe signed a 1-year, $9.5 million tender, ending a lengthy holdout.Dwayne Bowe signs tender, returns to Chiefs-NFL.com Retrieved August 17, 2012. In Week 14, Bowe injured his ribs while making a block, and on December 14, the Chiefs placed Bowe on injured reserve. 2013 season On March 4, 2013, Bowe signed a five-year contract. Ian Rapoport of NFL.com reported that Bowe became the NFL's third highest-paid wide receiver in terms of total compensation on his contract. His deal was for $56 million over five years and included $26 million in guaranteed money plus a $15 million signing bonus, according to someone who had seen the deal. In year one, Bowe earned $16 million with a base salary of $750,000 and a workout bonus of $250,000. In the first three years, Bowe would have earned $36 million. 2014 season On August 15, 2014, the NFL announced Bowe would be suspended for one game. Bowe served his suspension in the Chiefs first game of the season against the Tennessee Titans on September 7, but was allowed to play in the preseason. The suspension was a result of his arrest for possession of a controlled substance on November 10, 2013. On November 2, 2014, against the New York Jets, Bowe caught his 500th pass. The Chiefs released Bowe on March 12, 2015 after eight seasons with the team. Cleveland Browns Bowe at the Browns showcase of their new jerseys On March 19, 2015, Bowe was signed to a two-year contract from the Cleveland Browns for up to $13 million and $9 million guaranteed. Although Browns general manager Ray Farmer signed Bowe during the offseason, head coach Mike Pettine chose not to use him throughout the season, saying he was not among the top four receivers on the team. Bowe made his Browns debut during a Week 2 matchup against the Tennessee Titans but was held without a catch. He did not make a reception until Week 9 at the Cincinnati Bengals. He finished the game with a season-high 3 catches for 31 yards. During his first season with the Browns, Bowe appeared in only 7 contests, had 5 catches, and no starts. Throughout the season, he was deactivated for most games and the fourth or fifth receiver on the depth chart behind Travis Benjamin, Brian Hartline, Taylor Gabriel, and Andrew Hawkins.

It is the ninth entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who appeared in 190 shorts at the studio between 1934 and 1959. Plot The Stooges, working as carpenters for at least ten years, are temporarily left in charge of a drugstore. When a liquor supplier (Nat Carr) stops by and asks for a drink, the Stooges mix a drink using all manner of medicines and chemicals, and mixed with a rubber boot. The concoction reacts, and it is so strong that it cuts through a wicker chair serving as an improvised sieve. But the salesman loves the libation (which he thought was Scotch), and he convinces the Stooges to pose as Scotsmen and attend a party at his boss' house, where he can sign the Stooges to a liquor contract for their invention, dubbed the \\"Breath of Heather\\". After a raucous Highland Fling dance and a disastrous dinner, the barrel of the lethal \\"scotch\\" is presented. The Stooges' attempt to tap the barrel results in an explosion which engulfs all the party guests in a sea of foam.

This event is an integral part of the storyline, with the drugstore owner (Al Thompson) frantically attempting to lay in a stock of liquor in anticipation of the imminent end of Prohibition. The title Pardon My Scotch parodies the expression \\"Pardon my French.\\" The term \\"Scotch\\" for \\"Scottish\\" is now considered impolite, although \\"Scotch\\" as a type of whiskey is still acceptable. Pardon My Scotch is the first Stooge film to employ \\"Listen to the Mocking Bird\\" as the Stooges' official theme song, as arranged by Louis Silvers. It would be used up to and including 1939's Three Little Sew and Sews. The gag of tossing fruit into a singer's open mouth was reused in the 1945 film Micro-Phonies. When the liquor supplier prepares to consume the Stooges' volatile concoction, they wish him well in a triad pattern saying \\"Over the river,\\" \\"Skip the gutter,\\" and concluding with \\"Ver geharget,\\" a Yiddish expression meaning \\"get killed\\" or \\"drop dead.\\" Moe's injury During the opening scenes when the boys are assembling the door, Moe asks Curly to saw a piece of wood for him. Curly lays the wood on top of a wooden table, which Moe happens to be standing on. Curly then proceeds to buzzsaw both the wood and table in half, with the table splitting in two. However, the table split inward on Moe's half of it, and Moe came crashing down on his left side, breaking three ribs. He was able to pull himself up and deliver a double slap to Larry and Curly before fainting. Moe was then rushed to the hospital while production ceased briefly. In his 1977 autobiography Moe Howard and the Three Stooges (later published as I Stooged to Conquer), Moe incorrectly identified the film in which this injury occurred as Beer and Pretzels. The painful footage was reused in 1943 at the start of Dizzy Detectives.

In the United States, an SBR is an item regulated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) as a Title II weapon. In the absence of local laws prohibiting ownership, American civilians may own an SBR provided it is registered with the ATF, and a $200 tax is paid prior to taking possession of or creating the firearm. History The regulation of short-barreled rifles was the result of the National Firearms Act of 1934 which also imposed restrictions on short barreled shotguns, suppressors and machine guns. Measurement method Overall length is measured between the extreme ends of the gun, along a centerline which passes through the middle of the barrel. For rifles fitted with folding or telescoping stocks (such as U.S. Carbine M1A1), US Federal guidelines state that measurement is performed with the stock unfolded as intended for use as a rifle. Some states ‚Äî such as California and Michigan ‚Äî measure overall length with the stock folded. Barrel length is measured from the end of the muzzle to the front of the breechface, typically by inserting a measuring rod into the barrel. Barrel length may partially comprise a permanently attached muzzle accessory (such as a recoil compensator or flash suppressor). Production Short barreled rifles can be created through end-user modification by trimming down a larger rifle, by building a rifle with an original barrel shorter than , or by adding a shoulder stock to a handgun which is fitted with a barrel shorter than , which would legally redefine it as a rifle rather than a handgun. Each of these processes must legally be accompanied by ATF registration. Some older handguns, such as the original broomhandle Mausers or Lugers manufactured before 1946, may be considered relics instead of weapons, and not regulated by federal SBR rules; however, they may still be subject to local laws.ATF Curio and Relic List. The ATF maintains a list of Curio & Relic of gun models and serial number ranges. While they are not considered firearms under the 1934 National Firearms Act, they are regulated by the Gun Control Act of 1968. United States In the United States, it is a federal felony to possess an SBR unless it is registered with the ATF to the person who possesses it. Class 2 manufacturers, Class 3 dealers, and government agencies can transfer these firearms, tax exempt. The individual buyer or owner is responsible for paying the $200 tax when purchasing, manufacturing, or transferring an SBR. They must also notify the ATF when transporting it across state lines. As a result of the Supreme Court decision in United States v. Thompson/Center Arms Company, 504 U.S. 505 (1992), it is not illegal to possess a \\"kit\\" allowing a handgun to be fitted with a buttstock and with barrels both under and over the 16 inch minimum for a rifle, so long as the firearm is only assembled into legal (handgun with no buttstock, rifle with buttstock and 16 inch or longer barrel) configurations. Assembling the firearm into an NFA-regulated configuration (rifle with buttstock but barrel shorter than 16 inches) would be a violation of the National Firearms Act.https://www.atf.gov/file/55526/download Canada Canadian regulations include among prohibited weapons firearms adapted from a rifle by sawing, cutting or any other alteration to an overall length less than or a barrel length less than .

It was premiered by the Hall√© Orchestra conducted by the dedicatee, Sir Hamilton Harty, in November 1931. The work is untypical of its composer, who was not usually associated with comedy in music. Background Bax was generally associated with music that the 1955 reference work The Record Guide called \\"intrinsically noble, humane, and capable of a certain melancholy grandeur\\". Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, pp. 75‚Äì76 In his youth, Bax had been greatly taken with the works of Richard Strauss, before his enthusiasm was diverted to a fascination with Celtic culture. When Sir Hamilton Harty approached him in 1930 to write a short overture for the Hall√© Orchestra , Bax promised him \\"Straussian pastiche\\", and produced what the composer's biographer, Lewis Foreman calls \\"this memorable and high-spirited score complete with lapses into waltz time.\\"Foreman, Lewis (1987).

He is the grandson of the ruler Torgai son begs Yer Shokai, maternally derived from the Kazakh Khanate of Khiva.  At the beginning of his life  Mustafa Shokay was born into an aristocratic family. During this period the status of family was evaluating by the number of cattle, and Mustafa's family was wealthy in their village. Mustafa's paternal grandfather was the Datkha, which in Persian means ‚Äì \\"a wish, request, Justice\\", also Datkha was equal to a Sultan and was higher in title than Bey. Mustafa's grandfather was electing Prime Minister ‚Äì Datkha of Khiva's khan. Datkha could subordinate only to the Khan and help him to manage the Khanate. The mother of Mustafa was Bakty, she was intellectual in her own right and she was a descendant of the famous Batu Khan. Bakty was well- educated, owned Arabic and Persian languages. Mustafa Shokay was born on 25 December 1890, in Akmechet, (today Kyzyl-Orda), Kazakhstan. He was from the Middle Juz (horde) of the Kypchak‚Äôs tribe, Torgai clan, Shashty popliteal, Boshay knee, Zhanay popliteal. Before October Revolution in 1917 Shokay's Family and about 30 of his relatives lived in one village, which was located in 5 kilometers from the station of Sulu-Tube. They lived in nice yurts, (nomad's houses). The father of Mustafa had 2 wives and the mother of Mustafa was his second wife. He had 2 sisters and 3 brothers. Mustafa was the last one in their family and the difference between his Sadyk brothers was 15 years. Another brother's name was Nurtaza. Based on Mustafa's word, his mother taught to read and right in childhood. When he was 5 year old he learned to play on the dombra. From childhood he was musically gifted, and had a great ear and for music. From a young age, Mustafa was highly educated. In their village was a mullah, who was taught to read the Koran. Mustafa was distinguished by the fact that he had perfect memory and he knew all, of the sura from the Koran by heart. When he was 7 years old his father took him to Akmechet Mustafa had to go to school, in Akmechet, where he would study in Russian; it was feared that he would forget the Kazakhs and forever be Russian. Moreover, the mullah added to all of this, that Russians will put on you the cross. Mustafa was really afraid, he did not want to go, but his father calmed him and persuaded him. Mustafa started his studying in the Russian school, but he became very sick and left his studies. In the 1902 he was admitted to Tashkent gymnasium and in 1910 he graduated with the school's gold medal. General Samsonov (Alexander Samsonov (1859‚Äì1914), a Russian military commander during World War I) was against of Mustafa's gold and insisted another student should win. The gold was had handed to Zeprometov, he was Russian. The director of Tashkent gymnasium disagrees and also Zeprometov said that Shokay should get the gold medal. It was the great event in 1910. The intentions of Samsonov caused outrage not only within the ranks of the local youth, but also from the Russians. All of the professors and Russian intellectuals were ready to strike. That strike was provoked by the administration, showing the unfair treatment to the student in favor of the officials. Trying to smooth over the scandal, Samsonov proposed Mustafa as an interpreter in his administration, but Shokai refused and went to St. Petersburg, where he entered the law faculty of the university (1910‚Äì1917). In 1912 Mustafa's father died and the local village people asked him to return home for a time at the request of fellow to replace the post of his father ‚Äì a judge. Moreover, because of death of his father Mustafa interrupted his education for a time. Then, in connection with the Stolypin agrarian reform in Kazakhstan have become massively resettled peasants of Russia, the land for which was collected from the local Kazakhs began land disputes.–ú–∞—Ä–∏–∏ –ß–æ–∫–∞–π \\"–Ø –ø–∏—à—É –í–∞–º –∏–∑ –ù–æ–∂–∞–Ω–∞\\" Almaty, Kaynar 2001,  Activities in St. Petersburg  During study in St. Petersburg, Mustafa was trying to protect not only the interest of his countryman, but the whole Kazakh nation. However, on 3 July 1907, Tsar Nikolai II issued a decree depriving the electoral rights of the indigenous peoples of Siberia and Central Asia. They lost their way with little representation in the State Duma of Russia. But the Kazakh politicians and intellectuals continued to fight for the interests of the people. Working in the Duma, Shokai met with prominent Muslim political leaders of Russia and became friends with Ahmad Zaki Validi, the future chairman of the Bashkir autonomy. In the midst of heavy the First World War June 25, 1916, Tsar Nicholas II issued a decree \\"On the requisition of foreigners\\", attracting the indigenous population of Turkestan and the Steppe region in age from 19 to 43 years to rear work ‚Äì digging trenches, despite the fact that the Muslims were exempted from military service due to the deprivation of electoral rights. The decree came in the days of Ramadan and the height of the agricultural work that has outraged the entire nation. Then was launched a powerful uprising in Turkestan and the Steppe region. In the Kazakh steppes rebellion led Amangeldy Imanov. In the State Duma there were protests. Mustafa Shokai entered his commission as a secretary and translator of the Muslim faction. Subsequent performances of Kerensky in the Duma with the analysis of the Turkestan uprising against the imperial government policies brought him huge popularity throughout Russia. When he returned to Petrograd, Shokai prepared materials for their performances in the State Duma of their faction. However the State Duma was dissolved by Tsar Nicholas II, and then he himself abdicated.–°—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–µ–∞–∑–∏–∞—Ç—Å–∫–æ–µ –≤–æ—Å—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∏–µ –≤ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ 1916-1917, –°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π –ü–∏—Å–∫—É–Ω–æ–≤, 2001, hrono.ru  Character of Mustafa Shokay  During his student life, in fact during his all life, Mustafa was not involved in any political party. He was a democrat, with big heart without the slightest hint of socialism, who loved his homeland and his nation. Mustafa never spared himself in the name of the future of his people. There were politicians for peace or for the war and Mustafa belonged to the politicians for peace. Mustafa's character was soft and easily vulnerable. He knew that to work in the State Duma he had to be a strong person. He never tired of studying; solving his mistakes and works on building his character. Shokay admired and highly valued Mustafa Kemal. Shokay considered that Turkestan needed a political reformer like himself. Although Mustafa Shokay did not have any hostile emotion to bigots or to representatives of other nations. He loved to make discussions or argue with person, who has different political opinion. In arguments he was calm and ever respected his opponent's standpoint. The big mistake of Mustafa in all his life was that he trusted others because of that he had a lot of trouble. He always took any inhumane acts to his heart. He was able to find the way to heart of people throughout honesty and the ability to empathize with others. Sometimes he stood really heatedly, defending his position, but in all cases did not hurt the feeling of his opponent. Mustafa was the enemy of narrow-minded nationalism. He defended his interest for position of Turkestan's people union. However, the Russian nationalist recognized Mustafa's position, but they did not want to regard with interest of Turkestan's nation, also with non-Russian nations. These principles of Russian democracy really hurt the feeling of Mustafa Shokay and for this reason he severed good relations with the Russian periodical press in 1923 (mass-media).  The first political steps  In 1914 World War I began and Mustafa as a student became a member of State Duma as a secretary. Mustafa was introducing to the Muslim fraction on the recommendation of Alikhan Bukeikhanov. Until 1917, before the October revolution Mustafa was a member of State Duma and he joined the political life of Turko-Tatar peoples. The formal political activities began in 1917 when Mustafa Shokay was delegated to the congress of Muslims in Moscow. This big congress of Turkestan's was held by his initiatives. Mustafa was a member of Turkestan committee of Interim Government and after he was elected as a chairman of Turkestan's national committee. On 10 December 1917 the project of creating autonomy was submitted. On the 4th Congress in Turkestan, Turkestan autonomy, known as the Kokand Autonomy. After overthrowing the Russian Provisional Government was declared in Petrograd during the armed uprising on October 25, the Bolsheviks carried out popular measures for the people in the election-Russian Constituent Assembly of Russia. But in election November 12, 1917 the Bolsheviks received only 23.9% of the vote against 40.4% for the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries. In such circumstances, the Kokand government announced its intention to create on March 20, 1918, its parliament by universal direct, equal and secret ballot. Two thirds of the seats in parliament were for Muslim MPs and one third ‚Äì representatives of non-Muslims. The existence of such a parliament was to be the first step towards the democratization of Turkestan. Chairman of People's Commissars of the Turkestan Republic Fedor Kolesov, said: \\"We can not allow Muslims to the supreme authorities, since the position of the local population against us is not defined and, in addition, they have no proletarian organization\\"–ú—É—Å—Ç–∞—Ñ–∞ –ß–æ–∫–æ–π-–û–≥–ª—ã \\"–¢—É—Ä–∫–µ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω –ø–æ–¥ –≤–ª–∞—Å—Ç—å—é —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç–æ–≤\\". –ê–ª–º–∞-–ê—Ç–∞ \\"–ê–π–∫–∞–ø\\" 1993. But on 11 February 1918 Bolsheviks sent troops to Kokand. The power was on equal and Kokand was completely destroyed, the troops were armed with machine guns and cannons, which were not in Kokand, Turkestan. Shokay moved through Fergana to Tashkent. On his head a bounty of 1000 rubbles was placed. At that time Mustafa Shokay was the youngest politician, who advocated for Turkestan Autonomy, but he was against separatism. When he was in hiding Mustafa met his old friend Maria Gorina, whom he married in April 1918, After this event Shokay said:‚Äù We called the soviet power then established in Tashkent the ¬´enemy of our people¬ª. I have not changed my view on the matter in the last ten years.‚Äù During the following years Shokay wrote and published a book:‚Äù Turkestan under the Soviet Union (On the characteristics of the dictatorship of the proletariat)‚Äù.  Emigration  Traveling through the Kazakh steppe and the Caspian Sea, Mustafa Shokay manage to safely arrived in Baku, Azerbaijan, then Tbilisi, Georgia where he lived with his wife of two years, from spring 1919 till February 1921. Shokay moved to Turkey, because The Red Army led by Ordzhonikidze, defeated the Volunteer Army of General Denikin, captured the North Caucasus, then Azerbaijan, Armenia, and February 16, 1921 came to Tiflis. The democratic Republic of Transcaucasia was overthrown by the Soviet Union.–ë–∞—Ö—ã—Ç –°–∞–¥—ã–∫–æ–≤–∞ \\"–ú—É—Å—Ç–∞—Ñ–∞ –ß–æ–∫–æ–π –≤ —ç–º–∏–≥—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏\\" After the events in Transcaucasia Mustafa Shokay and his wife Maria Shokay emigrated to Istanbul, Turkey. Shokay in Istanbul wrote articles in English for ‚ÄúThe Times‚Äù and for publications like ‚Äú≈ûafak‚Äù, also for ‚ÄúYeni D√ºnya‚Äù- ‚ÄúNew World‚Äù. Then he found that Alexander Kerensky, who also emigrated to Paris from Russia. Kerensky helped Shokay to get a French visa and in the summer of 1921 Mustafa with Maria moved to Paris. He was writing articles for the newspaper of Kerensky ‚ÄúDays‚Äù and Milyukova's ‚ÄúLast News‚Äù. In 1923 Mustafa and Maria Shokay moved to Nozhan-Sur-Marn, spoke for the European public with the speech \\"The policy of Russia and Turkestan National Movement\\". The time during the exile it was the most darkness period for both of Mr. and Mss. Shokay. Mustafa Shokay was trying to write books, newspapers, magazines; held meeting with his speech for whole world to submit and to hear about the problems in Turkestan and Central Asia. These editions was published in Istanbul, Paris, Berlin, London, Warsaw, he published articles about Central Asia, theoretical studies, historical and political review. Mustafa Shokay created newspaper in Istanbul:‚ÄùNew Turkestan‚Äù in 1927 and it was existed till 1931. In 1929 he settled in Berlin edition of the magazine \\"Yash (Young) Turkestan\\" and became its editor in chief. The magazine last until the outbreak of World War II in 1939, was released 117 editions. Mustafa Shokay spoke foreign languages such as English, French, Russian, German, Turkish, and Arabic.  Unsuccessful collaboration with the Nazis in the name of Turkestan  On the day of the attack on 22 June 1941 in Paris, the Nazis arrested all the well-known Russian emigrants and imprisoned them in the castle of Compi√®gne (Ch√¢teau de Compi√®gne). There numbers included Shokay. After three weeks he was taken to Berlin and a two weeks offered to lead the Turkestan Legion, which was planned to recruit Soviet military prisoners of Turkic descent held in German concentration camps. The Germans relied on Mustafa Shokay's authority, yet still Legion has been partially replenished by elite German troops which had combat experience against Soviet troops on Eastern Front, while Shokai was required to familiarize Turkic prisoners with circumstances of their fellow countrymen in the camps. He was shocked by inhuman conditions of Asians kept behind barbed wire. Detailing the journey of Mustafa's life, he entertained the possibility of creating a union of Muslim states of Germany. To achieve this goal, it would be necessary to organize Muslim ‚Äì Soviet prisoners of war ‚Äì particularly the army. And acquired goals should be overthrowing Soviet governments in Kazakhstan and Central Asia. Mustafa Shokai said that he was ready to consent to be the head of this noble movement. The collaboration made known to the imperial leader of the National Socialist party on matters of ideology and foreign policy, the Minister for the \\"Eastern Territories\\" General SS Alfred Rosenberg. Mustafa Shokay wanted to give some relief and grasped the chance to save prisoners' lives, he compromised with the German authorities. He set his conditions: #Create staff for the future of Turkestan state schools in Germany; #Create military forces from follow prisoners, which will be used only when approaching the borders of Turkestan. Mustafa Shokay wanted to receive some benefit from the collaboration with Nazis. Unfortunately Adolf Hitler declined in all queries, because Hitler considered the Turkestan Legion as ‚Äúcannon fodder‚Äù. Later Shokay wrote a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Gruppenf√ºhrer Joachim von Ribbentrop: ‚ÄúSeeing how representatives of the nation, who raised such geniuses as Goethe, Feuerbach, Bach, Beethoven, Schopenhauer, treat prisoners of war ... I can not accept the offer to lead the ... Turkestan Legion and refuse further cooperation. All the consequences of my decision, I realize.‚Äù Adolf Hitler realized his attempted manipulation of Mustafa Shokay was going to fail; the German leadership decided to remove him. On December 22, 1941, Hitler signed a decree for the establishment of the Turkestan and other national legions. At that time Mustafa was in hospital in Berlin \\"Victoria\\". On December 27, 1941, he died. The official report stated that he \\"died of blood poisoning on the background of an emerging epidemic of typhus,\\" he was infected when visiting concentration camps. But the same symptoms could be poisoning. Moreover, in the memoirs of his wife Maria Gorina-Shokai, she pointed that Mustafa has been ill with typhus in Turkestan and he was supposed to be immune. Mustafa Shokai was buried in the Turkish Muslim cemetery (Osmanidov) in Berlin. On the tombstone just below the date at the behest of his wife M. Shokai, Maria Jakovlevna, there are three letters in Latin and four numbers: JOH.15.13. They point to the thirteenth verse of the fifteenth chapter of the Gospel of John: \\"There is no greater love than this; that a man lay down his life for his friends.\\" Turkestan Legion army was later granted to nazi-loyalist Veli Kayum, long standing cooperative of German anti-Soviet conspirative movement Prometheus. He was honorifically titled Khan after he had no problem embracing nazi vision to build Turkic-Muslim army which would fight Soviets.

Photo by Chris Newman Tungland or Tongland Abbey was a Premonstratensian monastic community located in Tongland in the historical county of Kirkcudbrightshire in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. It was probably founded circa 1218 by Alan, Lord of Galloway, although the church of Tongland had previously been granted to Holyrood Abbey by his grandfather Uchtred in the early 1160s. Few of its early abbots are known and its history is more generally covered by a cloud of obscurity. One notable abbot (1504-1509) was the Italian alchemist John Damian, ( in Italian Giovanni Damiano de Falcucci), was an who, if a satirical account in two poems by William Dunbar is based in fact, may have made an attempt at human-powered flight from the walls of Stirling Castle. The fabric and discipline of the abbey had degenerated by the early sixteenth century. There is no evidence that John Damien ever resided in the abbey and he may have resigned his title in 1509 when King James IV made a petition to Rome for the title to pass to \\"David bishop of Galloway\\" with a commission to \\"reform the discipline and repair the ruins\\".Priscilla Bawcutt, The Poems of William Dunbar Volume 2, Notes and Commentary. Association for Scottish Literary Studies, Glasgow, 1998. pp.295-6 This petition was repeated under King James V and Tongland was eventually granted to the bishop in 1529, and confirmed in 1541. Tongland remained a possession of the bishop until the commendatorship of William Melville (1588-1606), but afterwards reverted into the bishop's hands. The village of Tongland exists now at the site.

The weapon was developed as a commercial venture primarily for export, since the Swiss Army had already adopted the 7.5 mm MG 51 GPMG (chambered for the 7.5√ó55mm Swiss Schmidt‚ÄìRubin rifle cartridge), produced by the federal arms factory W+F. Development Work on the SIG MG 710-3 machine gun (initially designated the Model 55, changed in 1957 to SIG MG 710) began in 1955 and its design was influenced by the MG 45, a late World War II development of the German MG 42 machine gun. These efforts resulted in the SIG MG 710-1 (adapted to use the 6.5√ó55mm round) and the SIG MG 710-2 (with the 7.92√ó57mm Mauser cartridge), while the prototype for the final production version which would become the SIG MG 710-3 (chambered in a standard NATO 7.62√ó51mm caliber) was completed by the mid-1960s. Currently the weapon is in use by the armed forces of Bolivia, Brunei, Chile, Liberia, and Liechtenstein. Design details The SIG MG 710-3 is an automatic, air-cooled belt-fed weapon operated by roller-delayed blowback and fires from an open bolt. The machine gun's bolt differs from other contemporary designs employing the roller-delayed blowback method of operation (such as CETME and Heckler & Koch designed weapons), being a 3-piece design that consists of a bolt head with two locking rollers, a striker sleeve and the bolt carrier which is connected telescopically with the bolt head. When a round is chambered pressure from the return spring drives the bolt and carrier assembly forward; simultaneously both rollers engage camming surfaces which drive the rollers outward from their compressed travel position into recesses in the barrel extension. Upon firing, the bolt carrier and striker assembly recoil to the rear and the geometry of the fixed camming surfaces drives the rollers inward unlocking the bolt breech and increasing the speed at which the striker sleeve withdraws relative to the bolt. As the slower bolt continues rearward it impacts the returning striker sleeve (this impact decelerates the bolt). The bolt assembly also contains the spring extractor, while a lever case ejector is located at the base of the feed tray. Spent casings are ejected downward. The weapon has a striker firing mechanism, a trigger assembly for fully automatic only fire and a cross-bolt safety (the \\"safe\\" setting disables the bolt catch). The SIG MG 710-3 is fed from the left side by either NATO standard disintegrating M13 (United States) or continuous link German DM1 belt, but only after swapping several parts in the feed block. When used in a light machine gun role, the ammunition belt is stored in a sheet metal container that has a 50-round capacity and is attached to the left side of the receiver. The feeding mechanism resembles the one used in the MAG machine gun (a simplified version of the MG 42's feed system) operated with a feed arm driven by the motion of the striker sleeve. The belt is fed in two stages during both the forward and rear movement of the bolt assembly. The quick- change barrel, ended with a slotted flash suppressor, has a fixed handle used to remove it. The machine gun uses three types of barrels: a light profile, heavy profile (in a heavy machine gun role), and special type (used for firing blank ammunition). The firearm has a fixed stock (metal or wood), detachable bipod and open-type sights (rear sight is a sliding tangent with settings from 100 to 1200 m with 100 m increments). Used as a static heavy machine gun the weapon is placed on a SIG L810 tripod. It is also adapted to use an optical sight (with 2.5√ó magnification) or a night vision device.

Heading northbound, state maintenance of NY 331 begins at the Montgomery‚ÄìFulton county line as the Montgomery County section of the route is county-maintained as part of County Route 57 (CR 57). NY 331 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. Route description NY 331's signed southern terminus at the Montgomery‚ÄìFulton county line. The route officially continues to the intersection of Crum Creek and Kennedy roads, visible in the background. NY 331 officially begins at the intersection of Kennedy and Crum Creek (CR 57) roads in the Montgomery County town of St. Johnsville. The route heads northeast as a narrow, two-lane road through a rural, open area as a county-maintained highway, overlapping with the unsigned CR 57 for until the Montgomery‚ÄìFulton county line. State maintenance of NY 331 begins at the boundary, which is signed as NY 331's southern terminus. Past the county line, the route widens slightly as it traverses rolling hills in a rural part of the town of Oppenheim. NY 331 soon reaches the small hamlet of Crum Creek, where it connects to the eastern terminus of CR 108.

The rolling, open terrain continues on as NY 331 crosses Crum Creek prior to entering the vicinity of the hamlet of Oppenheim, where NY 331 serves a farm and a line of homes leading into the center of the community. NY 331 ends here at a junction with NY 29 while the route's right-of-way continues north toward Adirondack Park as a town highway named North Road. History Curves along NY 331 On October 28, 1916, the state of New York awarded a contract to improve what is now NY 331 in Fulton County to state highway standards. The road cost $60,489 to rebuild (equivalent to $ in ), and it was added to the state highway system on November 4, 1920, as unsigned State Highway 621 (SH 621). In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, hundreds of state-maintained highways were assigned a posted route number for the first time. One of these was SH 621, which was designated NY 331. The route has continued into Montgomery County for a short distance as a county- maintained road since at least 1970.

It is located by Big Bear Lake along with its sister resort Bear Mountain; these two resorts which operate under the same management are collectively known as Big Bear Mountain Resorts (BBMR). Snow Summit is one of the larger ski areas in Southern California, and is considered to be one of the most popular ski and snowboard destinations for patrons from around the Los Angeles area. Snow Summit is a mid-sized resort, with a topographic vertical drop, and of skiable terrain, all of it covered by snowmaking. In 2014 Mammoth Mountain purchased Bear Mountain and Snow Summit for $38 million. In 2017, Mammoth Resorts announced its sale by Starwood to a partnership of Aspen Skiing Company and KSL Capital Partners, known as Alterra Mountain Company. Bear Mountain relationship  For decades, Snow Summit and Goldmine Mountain operated independently of one another, less than two miles apart. In 1988, S.K.I., a major ski area operator, bought Goldmine, changed its name to Bear Mountain, and invested millions of dollars in improvements that enhanced its competitive position against Snow Summit. In 2002, Snow Summit purchased Bear Mountain, and the two became one company. Snow Summit and Bear Mountain are marketed as areas constituent to Big Bear Mountain Resorts. A lift ticket from either area is honored at the other, and a free bus service between Snow Summit and Bear Mountain shuttles patrons back and forth between the two for that purpose.

It first opened at 52 Nassau Street in 1769 in a home built in 1756. The Inn experienced British occupation during the American Revolution and played host to members of the Continental Congress when it met in nearby Nassau Hall. In 1937, the original inn was demolished to make way for the Palmer Square development and a new, larger, inn opened at 10 Palmer Square in 1938. The hotel's restaurant, the Yankee Doodle Tap Room, has a large mural by Norman Rockwell, depicting Yankee Doodle, behind the bar. It is within walking distance of Princeton University. History The Nassau Inn (original location) in 1937, showing the west wing, built 1756, and part of the east wing, Mansion house, built 1846 by Charles Steadman Colonial The inn's first building, constructed in 1756 using brick imported from Holland, was built as the home of Judge Thomas Leonard, an eminent local citizen who had helped woo The College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) to relocate to Princeton. On his death in 1769, the house was turned into a hotel by Christopher Beekman, who gave it the name College Inn. The Inn quickly became the center of town life, and with its location on the King's Highway, at the midpoint between New York City and Philadelphia, played host to many of the notable figures of colonial America, including Paul Revere, Robert Morris, and Thomas Paine. The Inn experienced the vicissitudes of the American Revolution, with the British occupation of Princeton in 1776 followed by George Washington's victory at the Battle of Princeton. In 1783, the Continental Congress met in Nassau Hall, with many Founding Fathers staying in the Inn. Hageman's 1879 history of Princeton relates that Mayor Morford of Princeton insisted that the assembly had met in the Inn, with its ballroom serving as the Court of Chancery. Nineteenth Century Christopher and Grace Beekman retired as proprietors of the Inn around the turn of the 19th century. John Gifford took over management of the hotel, renaming it the Nassau Inn, sometimes Nassau Hotel, and hanging a sign depicting Nassau Hall at the entrance. In 1846, a new building, known as Mansion House, was built by noted local builder/architect Charles Steadman on the east side of the original structure, which then became known as the west wing. In the 1880s the two buildings were combined. Palmer Square The Yankee Doodle Tap Room inside the inn, with a Norman Rockwell mural behind the bar In the 1930s Edger Palmer, a major donor to Princeton University and leading figure in the town, desired to bring an urban redevelopment to Princeton similar in concept, if not scale, to Rockefeller Center in New York. This led to the 1936‚Äì1939 creation of Palmer Square, a public square and planned development that combines stores, restaurants, and apartments, with a post office and a new building for the Nassau Inn. The original buildings of the Inn were demolished; their former site is now Tiger Park, with a tiger statue commemorating Edger Palmer, standing opposite Nassau Presbyterian Church. The new Inn was built facing the square and has itself come to be considered historic with its fine interiors and Norman Rockwell mural in the Yankee Doodle Tap Room. The Inn underwent a 120-bed expansion in 1985, such that the hotel spans Palmer Square East. Amenities The hotel has 188 guest rooms, and 14 banquet rooms, with over in meeting space. Approximately 120,000 guests check in each year. Its close proximity to Princeton University helps to maintain high occupancy rates at the inn. The hotel allows pets, with a cleaning fee. It is a popular wedding venue, with an outdoor patio available for ceremonies. The restaurant, the Yankee Doodle Tap Room, is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and the bar and lounge area has a fireplace.

The Oneida Settlement The Oneida, Haudenosaunee people, an Iroquoian people, had a traditional territory that once covered a large section of the eastern part of North America. The territory of the Oneida Settlement is part of the traditional hunting area known as the Beaver Hunting Grounds, which was recognized in 1701 Nanfan Treaty. The people who live there are descendants of many later migrants, a small group of assimilated/Christian Oneidas who relocated to Southwold, Ontario, Canada from New York state in 1840. The original settlers of the Oneida community were associated with two Christian denominations, Methodist and Anglican. One of the leaders in the migration was an ordained Methodist minister. Soon after their arrival in Ontario, the settlers built Methodist and Anglican churches. Since those early days, these two churches have had over half of the population as members. By 1877, some people began to join the Baptists. Old Methodist records show some families and individuals shifting from the Methodist to the Baptist church, and the reverse. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada designates the settlement as Oneida 41 Indian Reserve or simply as Oneida 41.Indian and Northern Affairs Canada Reserve/Settlement/Village Detail The Oneida people who live or are descendants of people at the \\"Oneida Settlement\\" always insist that their lands be called a \\"settlement\\" because Oneida people purchased the relocation lands in Ontario. This is a distinction from having the lands \\"set aside\\" or \\"reserved\\" for them. Many other lands inhabited by indigenous people in North America are called \\"Indian reserves\\". Prior to selling their New York lands, the Oneida requested assurance from the Crown that should they remove to Canada, they would be protected and treated in every respect as their brethren who had always resided within the precincts of the province. Having received such assurance, they sold their lands in New York and selected the Thames River tract. They expressed a wish that their tenure to these lands should be precisely the same as that held by the resident tribes; the parties from whom the lands were purchased should surrender them to Her Majesty in trust for the sole use and benefit of the tribe and their posterity. In this way, the people of the Oneida Settlement would be put on a footing with other tribes in the province, and be exempt from the taxation to which the non-native inhabitants of the country were liable by law. The circumstances of purchase and subsequent surrender of the land have led some present-day Oneidas to hold an equivocal position regarding the status of the communal lands. A number of Oneidas object to the term ‚Äúreserve‚Äù in reference to the Oneida community. They prefer to call it the ‚ÄúOneida Settlement‚Äù or \\"Oneida Community\\", claiming that the land is private property, having been purchased by their ancestors rather than given by treaty. They also contend that the Oneida have never surrendered the land to the Crown, therefore the government should not have jurisdiction over them. Nevertheless, the government treats Oneida as a reserve. The Oneidas recognize, though often with protest, this de facto status of the community. Those who claim the land is still privately owned rather than held in trust do not press to establish this claim with the government. Several reasons are stated for letting the issue ride: the impossibility of getting all the special interest groups in the community to work together to prove their claim; lack of funds to fight such a case; and fear of losing certain advantages which reserve status owes them (Indian Act Governments). This latter is perhaps the most important reason. Those who deny that Oneida is Crown land held in trust for the Indians, fear that should the government accept their claim to its being privately owned land, then the Oneida might have to pay taxes. These would be delinquent since 1840. Governance The Band is governed according to the Canadian Indian Act, a non-traditional form of government. Many argue that the Canadian Indian Act is designed to keep the Oneida people in a constant state of poverty, dependence, division and despair. However, because the Oneida purchased their lands outright, the government can not follow all sections of the Indian Act with regards to the Oneida settlement. Nevertheless, the community does hold its own elections for self-government under the Indian Act. Participation by the voting population in these elections is below 40%, which is similar to other Haudenosaunee communities. The current Indian Act Band Council consists of Chief Randall Phillips and twelve (12) councillors: Carol Antone, Clinton Cornelius, Brandon Doxtator, Charity Doxtator, Gloria Doxtator, H.Grant Doxtator, Harry Doxtator, Kathleen Doxtator, Ursula Doxtator and Olive Elm, Justin Kechego-Doxtator and Stacey Phillips. The council, in turn, is a member of the Southern First Nation Secretariat, a Regional Chiefs' Council. On a larger political scale, the First Nation is a member of the Association of Iroquois and Allied Indians, a Tribal Political Organization representing eight Iroquoian and Anishinaabe First Nation governments in Ontario. This community also has a hereditary government structure in place. Community The community contains three sub-divisions, a community center, and three parks. Bingo and radio bingo are very popular, and sports are important. The people attend longhouse and the annual ceremonies. They teach the Oneida language to all children in school. The Community Center has been the center of controversy related to its construction, funding, and operations. Envisioned as a central facility for community use, it was envisioned to be self-sustaining by renting meeting rooms for special events (e.g., birthday parties and other celebrations). Without a strong revenue base, the Community Center has always operated in a deficit position. Facilities The Oneida people who live in this reserve also have a traditional longhouse and government. There are two factions: the River Road Longhouse follows the Code of Handsome Lake as well as the Great Law, and the other, the Elijah Road Longhouse, follows only the Great Law, not recognizing the other teachings. A number of Oneida own independent businesses, including several craft shops, variety stores, gas bars, and a great number of smoke shops. Two elementary schools have been built: Standing Stone and The Log School (Tsi ni yu kwali ho:tu')'. A health clinic is located in downtown Oneida. This area includes a community-owned radio station, administration building, senior rest home, a volunteer fire hall/ambulance station, water treatment facility, sewage treatment facilities, public works building, community centre, police station, and a training centre. Annual events The Oneida Nation of the Thames holds an annual Oneida Fair, the third weekend in the month of September. The Oneida Fair was once an occasion for the people to celebrate and compete in agricultural events and other competitions associated with their historical rural lifestyle. Today most Oneida people do not rely on an agricultural lifestyle. Their lives do not depend on a rural garden, home canning, baking, sewing, arts and crafts, and the raising of livestock. They have become more urbanized just as have other populations in Canada. But, people do participate every year and enter the various agricultural and home arts competitions, albeit on a smaller scale than in the past. Since the early 21st century, the Oneida Fairboard has sponsored a fireworks show at the Fair. It also has featured musicians such as Joanne Shenendoah (Oneida Indian Tribe of New York) and local acts such as Robbie Antone (blues performer). The Oneida Fair has likely gained more importance for those members who no longer live at the settlement. It is an occasion for homecoming and a chance to renew tribal ties. Many people feel welcome at the fair because it is generally a secular and non-political event. Neighbours The closest tribal or First Nation neighbours to the Oneida are the Munsee-Delaware Nation and the Chippewas of the Thames. Recent successes In the summer of 2007, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care approved the Oneida Nation of the Thames for the licensing and funding of 64 long-term care beds, as well as $2.8 million in capital. The First Nation continues to negotiate with other governments and partners to participate in this opportunity for family care. The facility will employ 70-80 people and will bring in 70 million dollars over a 20-year span. It will also allow First Nations people to return to their families, and partake in cultural activities.

It includes two species.  Species  *Balantiocheilos ambusticauda H. H. Ng & Kottelat, 2007 (Burnt tail fish) *Balantiocheilos melanopterus (Bleeker, 1851) (Tricolor sharkminnow) Distribution The range of B. ambusticauda is listed as including the Chao Phraya and Mae Klong drainages in Thailand; the original distribution of this species included the Chao Phraya River drainage from Bangkok upriver to the lower Nan River. It has also been reported in the Mekong Basin in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos from the Tonl√© Sap lake to the lower Nam Ngum River, but confirmed records from this basin are lacking and this is not recognized as part of its range by the IUCN. Previous records of B. melanopterus from the same rivers is due to confusion with B. ambusticauda; B. melanopterus only occurs in the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and Borneo. Large numbers of B. melanopterus are exported for the aquarium trade from Thailand, but these are all captive bred. Description Cyprinid fishes of the genus Balantiocheilos are easily distinguished from other members of the family by the presence of thick and fleshy lips, the lower lip bearing a large lobe that is deeply incised medially along its posterior edge and black along the distal margins of the dorsal, caudal, anal and pelvic fins. The posterior margin of the lower lip has often been described as forming a posteriorly opening pouch or pocket between the lip and the skin of the throat. B. ambusticauda can be differentiated from B. melanopterus by a shorter snout. Also, in B. ambusticauda the rictus (junction of the premaxilla and maxilla at the corner of the mouth) has posteriorly direct grooves that are curved instead of straight. Finally, B. ambusticauda has narrower black margins on the pelvic and anal fins (on the distal third or less instead of the distal half or more in B. melanopterus). B. ambusticauda also has some golden color as opposed to the silvery B. melanopterus. B. ambusticauda only reaches about TL as opposed to TL in B. melanopterus. Conservation B. melanopterus is listed as an endangered species by the IUCN Red List. It has become rare or extinct in many river basins of its native range. In Danau Sentarum (Borneo), fishermen already reported in 1993 and 1995 that the populations have decreased dramatically after 1975, for no clear reason. Fishermen mentioned overfishing for the aquarium-fish trade or forest fires in 1975 and the resulting pollution as possible causes. The species is apparently extirpated in the Batang Hari basin (Sumatra) and it seems that all individuals of B. melanopterus exported from Indonesia and Thailand by the aquarium-fish trade are captive bred. B. ambusticauda is believed to have gone extinct even before it was scientifically described. Humphrey & BainHumphrey, S.R. & Bain, J.R. (1990) Endangered animals of Thailand. Sandhill Crane Press, Gainesville, 468 pp. speculated the decline was due to excessive capture for the aquarium fish trade, but this is unsubstantiated. Despite the lack of records in more than three decades, it is rated as critically endangered (rather than extinct) by the IUCN in the hope that a small undiscovered population remains.

The first U.S. Navy ship named for Castine, Maine, she saw service during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, and World War I. Construction and commissioning Castine was launched on 11 May 1892 by Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine, sponsored by Ms. M. Hichborn. She was commissioned on 22 October 1894 with Commander Thomas Perry in command, and reported to the United States Atlantic Fleet. Service history Pre-Spanish American War Assigned to the South Atlantic Ocean, Castine cleared New England waters in February 1895. She called at the Azores and Gibraltar, passed through the Suez Canal, visited Zanzibar and Mozambique, and rounded the Cape of Good Hope before arriving on station at Pernambuco, Brazil, on 13 October 1895. She cruised in South American and West Indian waters ‚Äì save for an overhaul period in Norfolk, Virginia ‚Äì until March 1898. Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War As American relations with Spain deteriorated just prior to the April 1898 outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Castine was called north in March 1898 to take her place on the blockade surrounding Cuba. She served in the force which accompanied the United States Armys troop transports to Cuba, and remained in the Caribbean through the close of the war in August 1898. Pre- World War I In December 1898, Castine sailed from Boston, Massachusetts, for the Suez Canal on her way to East Asia. Upon her arrival in the Philippine Islands, she began duty in coordination with the U.S. Army to combat Philippine insurgent forces during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. Operating primarily in the southern islands, she supervised the post-Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War evacuation of the Spanish garrison at Zamboanga in May 1899. With a cruise to Chinese ports in 1900, Castine remained in East Asian waters until June 1901, when she cleared for the Suez Canal and the United States East Coast. She was decommissioned at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 8 October 1901. Castine remained at Philadelphia until recommissioning on 12 November 1903. Upon recommissioning, she saw duty in the South Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea, and Caribbean. On 23 September 1905, she was decommissioned at Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. Castine remained at Portsmouth Navy Yard until 4 October 1908, when she recommissioned to serve as a submarine tender at U.S. East Coast naval bases until May 1913. She then returned to the Caribbean for gunboat duty, and later cruised off Vera Cruz and Tampico, Mexico. Near- loss in Santo Domingo harbor, 29 August 1916 Castine was at anchor in the harbor of Santo Domingo along with the armored cruiser Memphis on 29 August 1916 when, shortly after 12:00, an unexpected heavy swell began to develop and the ships began to roll heavily. Castine and Memphis both made preparations to leave the harbor and began to raise steam; Memphis expected to be able to get underway at about 16:35, with the smaller Castine able to do so earlier. Conditions in the harbor had deteriorated badly by 15:45, when the ships sighted an approaching wave of yellow water stretching along the entire horizon. By 16:00, the wave was closer, had turned ochre in color, and had reached about in height; at the same time, the ships began to roll very heavily, with Memphis rolling 45¬∞. Around 16:40, the giant wave the ships had seen approaching over the past hour arrived; it turned out to be a set of three waves of up to in height striking in rapid succession. Castine had gotten underway under minimal power and managed to put to sea through the huge waves, although she suffered damage and nearly capsized. Memphis, still immobile, was battered into a complete wreck, and a group of her sailors returning from shore leave in a motor launch were caught in the harbor by the waves and swamped; Memphis suffered 40 killed and 204 badly injured.For a description of the loss of Memphis, see Smith, pp. 67‚Äì70. In his 1966 account of the incident, The Wreck of the Memphis, Captain Edward L. Beach, Jr., son of Memphiss commanding officer Captain Edward L. Beach, Sr., described the heroic efforts of Castine to assist crewmen of Memphis who had been swamped in the motor launch. He also ascribed the events in the harbor to an unexpected tsunami exceeding in height,Beach, The Wreck of the Memphis. and this explanation has been carried forward by most sources discussing the incident.See, for example, Gardiner, Robert, ed., Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1860‚Äì1905, New York: Mayflower Books, Inc., 1979, , p. 149, for another citation of the 100-foot tsunami explanation. More recent research, however, has called this explanation into question. No record of any seismic event in the Caribbean on 29 August 1916 that could have triggered a tsunami has been found, and the rate of advance of the large wave Castine and Memphis reported‚Äîabout an hour to cross the distance from the horizon to the ships‚Äîmatches that of a wind-generated ocean wave (possibly a rogue wave); a tsunami, in contrast, would have covered the distance in only a few minutes. The periods of the three large waves that struck Castine and Memphis also are characteristic of large wind-generated waves rather than tsunamis.For a discussion of the lack of evidence for a tsunami and the more compelling evidence for freak wind-generated waves having wrecked Memphis, see Smith, pp. 68‚Äì69. A likely source for such large, wind-generated waves in Santo Domingo Harbor on 29 August 1916 does exist, in that three hurricanes active in the Caribbean between 12 August and 2 September 1916, (the first struck Corpus Christi, Texas, on 18 August 1916) passed westward just to the south. Waves generated by these storms could well have combined to create large waves like those that struck Castine and Memphis. Such a circumstance appears to explain the waves better than the tsunami theory. Oceanographer Dr. George Pararas- Carayammis in particular published an extensively detailed rebuttal demonstrating that a tsunami could not have caused the near-loss of Castine and foundering of Memphis, but that the last of the three hurricanes, a category 2 hurricane, likely did, creating a wave that reached a breaker height of as it approached Memphis.\\"The Loss of the USS Memphis on 29 August 1916 ‚Äì Was a Tsunami Responsible? Analysis of a Naval Disaster\\" by Dr. George Pararas-Carayannis4 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 520 (1935‚Äì1936) Annotations of Opinions of the Attorney General of the United States World War I The United States entered World War I on 6 April 1917, and Castines time in the Caribbean ended in July 1917. On 5 August, she sailed to join the Patrol Force at Gibraltar, where she served until 21 December 1918, when she returned to the United States. The Navy Cross was awarded to the son of Rear Admiral Peter C. Assersen, Captain William Christian Asserson (21 August 1875 ‚Äì 8 July 1939), for distinguished service as commanding officer of Castine while engaged in the exacting and hazardous duty of transporting troops and supplies to European ports through waters infested with enemy submarines and naval mines during World War I.The Navy Cross to Members of the US Navy World War I Decommissioning and disposal Castine was decommissioned at New Orleans, Louisiana, on 28 August 1919 and sold on 5 August 1921 for $12,500.00; she was resold for $40,000.00 in 1923. On 12 December 1924, she was under tow to Texas, where she was to be scrapped, when an explosion aboard her caused her to sink in 20 minutes. Wreck The wreck of Castine was identified by Thales Geosolutions in 2001 as a modern ship in 105 feet (32 meters) of sea water. Her wreck was documented further in May 2005 when a team from the United States Minerals Management Service (MMS) was identifying sonar targets. The site was re-examined by the MMS to evaluate damage following August 2005s Hurricane Katrina; the team found that even though Castines wreck was within 30 miles of the eye, very little damage occurred. In March 2009, the site was officially added to the National Register of Historic Places. References Further reading * Beach, Edward L., Jr. The Wreck of the Memphis.

The park contains the southernmost remaining stand of native white pine trees in the state of Illinois, and that area, , was designated an Illinois Nature Preserve in 2001. The area was poised to become a state park in 1903, but a veto by Governor Richard Yates prevented that from occurring. Supporters continued to press for the White Pines Woods, as it was once known, to receive state park designation throughout the period 1903-1927. In 1927 the park was established with help from supporters in the Chicago media. The park contains two freshwater streams, dolomite rock formations, and a variety of activities generally associated with Illinois state parks. Along Pine Creek, one of the park's two streams, fords were constructed instead of bridges allowing visitors to drive through the creek. History Early history White Pines Forest State Park is located in what was once a part of the Sauk leader Black Hawk's territory and encompasses an area once known as White Pines Woods. White Pines State Park nearly became an Illinois State Park as early as 1903, when the state established its first state park at Fort Massac. Members of the Oregon, Illinois Woman's Council started the process by lobbying the Illinois legislature to set aside White Pines Woods as a state park. In 1903 the Illinois legislature appropriated US$30,000 for the purchase of White Pines Woods, the southernmost stand of virgin, native white pine trees in the state. The move was stalled when then-Illinois Governor Richard Yates vetoed the measure, citing costs.\\"Conserving the Land: The Rock River Country,\\" Critical Trends Assessment Program, Rock River Country Project (), Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Retrieved on May 27, 2009. After 1903 and before 1927 (when the state park was established), the \\"Pines Woods Bill\\" was introduced several times without success. The designation of Starved Rock State Park in 1912 reportedly frustrated the supporters of White Pines Woods' designation as a state park. Dolomite rock formations along Pine Creek within the park The influential Friends of Our Native Landscape included the area around the Rock River between Dixon and Oregon on a list of 20 places in Illinois that should be designated state parks. Located in \\"Rock River country,\\" along an old Indian trail, was White Pines Woods covering in a canyon of dolomite rock carved by Pine Creek. At the time, within White Pines Woods, the tallest trees stood in height. The area was noted by Elia W. Peattie, a poet and member of the Eagle's Nest Art Colony (located at present-day Lowden State Park), who expressed the need for preservation of the White Pines Woods in one of her poems. The Illinois Board of State Park Advisers was established under a 1925 state law. The law, which was amended in 1931, gave the director of the Illinois Department of Public Works jurisdiction over the state parks. The Public Works position was a result of 1917 reforms by Governor Frank Lowden. The law also mandated a system of state parks, under the Illinois Department of Conservation, later renamed the Illinois Department of Natural Resources., National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form (PDF), National Register Information System Database, National Register of Historic Places, National Park Service.

Per the 1925 mandate, White Pines Forest became a state park in 1927 after its proponents enlisted the support of the Chicago Tribune and WGN Radio. That year, Governor Len Small moved to purchase White Pines for $63,949. Lodge and cabins In 1933, with the Great Depression in full swing, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) sought to relieve the work needs of unemployed Americans. The National Park Service sought to work with state governments in an effort to meet those ends. Many of the projects the CCC was involved with were construction projects. The project at White Pines was originally meant to be the construction of a lodge building. From 1933 to 1939, two hundred men, many of them World War I veterans, worked on the State Park construction project. Vernacular cabins at White Pines State Park After the lodge was completed, it was decided to build a restaurant and breezeway onto the lodge building. Logs for most of the project were shipped via railroad from as far away as Oregon and Washington state, unloaded in Stratford, Illinois and dragged to the construction site by teams of horses. The CCC project also completed sixteen one-room log cabins and three four- bedroom cabins. The work crews also built picnic shelters, trail shelters, and foot bridges. Only the logs for the cabins came from another source. They were purchased from a salvage company that had purchased utility poles from a defunct utility company at the price of 30 cents a piece. Nature Preserve designation In September 2001 the Illinois Nature Preserves Commission dedicated a section of the state park at White Pines Forest as Illinois' 300th nature preserve. Nature preserve designation gave the stand of white pine trees in the park the highest form of legal protection in the state. The designation restricts activities to those that do not impact the area's natural features such as hiking and birdwatching. Activities such as logging, farming, hunting, and fishing are all prohibited within Illinois Nature Preserves, though in some cases there are exceptions for hunting and fishing.\\"Up Front,\\" Outdoor Illinois, September 2001, Vol. IX, No. 9.

During the winter, cross-country skiing trails open, and other activities such as camping remain available as well. The lodge and cabins are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.White Pines State Park Lodge and Cabins, (PDF), Individual Property Form, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. Retrieved July 2, 2007. The 25 cabins are operated by a privately owned entity, the White Pines Inn, and the lodge features a popular private restaurant. White Pines has 103 campsites all accessible by vehicle; the campgrounds are sometimes closed because of high water or soft ground. Seven hiking trails wind a total of five miles (8 km) through the park; three of the seven trails are less than one mile (1.6 km) in length. The two cross-country ski trails total in length and are open as winter weather permits. The park's lodge and cabins consist of 13 one-room cabins and 3 four-room cabins; all cabins have a shower and other modern amenities. The lodge, though renovated, maintains its historic integrity, and new features were blended with the old. The lounge, in the lodge, is filled with crafts and artwork.

Its establishment was spearheaded by Nuri Killigil, a Turkish theorist of Pan-Turkism, which sought to separate territories inhabited by Turkic peoples from their countries and eventually unite them under Turkish rule. Turkmen volunteers in France. Although Turkic peoples had been perceived initially as \\"racially inferior\\" by the Nazis, this attitude officially already changed in autumn 1941, when, in view of the difficulties faced in their invasion of the Soviet Union, the Nazis attempted to harness the nationalist sentiment of Turkic peoples in the Soviet Union for political gain. The first Turkestan Legion was mobilized in May 1942, originally consisting of only one battalion but expanded to 16 battalions and 16,000 soldiers by 1943. Under the Wehrmacht's command, these units were deployed exclusively on the Western Front in France and Italy, isolating them from the Red Army. The battalions of the Turkestan Legion formed part of the 162nd Infantry Division and saw much action in Axis-occupied Yugoslavia (especially modern-day Croatia) and Italy. Much of the Turkestan Legion was ultimately imprisoned by British forces and repatriated into the Soviet Union after the war's end, where they would face execution or incarceration by the Soviet government for having collaborated with the Nazis.

Operating principle  Pinch valves employ an elastic tubing (sleeve/hose) and a device that directly contacts the tubing (body). Forcing the tubing together will create a seal that is equivalent to the tubing's permeability.Quik-Stop Pinch Valves Air- operated pinch valves consist of an elasticised reinforced rubber hose, a type of housing, and two socket end covers (or flanges). In air-operated pinch valves, the rubber hoses are usually press-fitted and centered into the housing ends by the socket covers. There is no additional actuator, the valve closes as soon as there is a pressurized air supply into the body. When the air supply becomes interrupted and the volume of air exhausts, the elastic rubber hose starts to open due to the force of the process flow.  Fields of application  Pinch valves are typically used in applications where the media needs to be completely isolated from any internal valve parts. The sleeve will contain the flow media and isolate it from the environment hence reducing contamination. They are commonly applied to medical instruments, clinical or chemical analyzers, and a wide range of laboratory equipment.Valcor Pinch Valves Pinch valves are also used for slurries or processes with entrained solids, because the flexible rubber sleeve closes droptight around solids. This avoids entrapment by the seat or in crevices, which would happen if using globe, diaphragm, butterfly, gate or ball valves. Major industries that use pinch valves are: * Bulk and solids handling, * Cement industry, * Waste water industry, * Chemical industry, * Food industry, * Beverage industry, * Ceramic-/Glass-/Plastic industry On a smaller scale, pinch valves are used in some water pistols, notably the original Super Soaker 50.http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/water-blaster4.htm Advantages The most important benefits of using pinch valves are the full bore for the flow media, and 100% tight shut off ‚Äì even on solids such as granules, powders, pellets, chippings, fibres, slivers, any kind of slurries and aggressive products. Ball valves, piston valves or gate valves could fail when in contact with aggressive products, due to body seat or the gate/piston wearing out too quickly. Air-operated pinch valves work with less wear of the elastic rubber hose because the kinetic energy of the solids are absorbed through the high elasticity of the rubber that also helps to resist abrasion.  Material selection  The sleeve material is selected among suitable synthetic polymer based upon the corrosiveness and abrasiveness of the flow media. A key selection criteria is the operation temperature, which needs to be within the limit of the polymer. Several rubber qualities are available for pinch valves such as natural rubber, EPDM, nitrile, viton, neoprene and butyl. Different housings and end covers/flange materials such as aluminium, plastics and stainless steel are also available;  References  Category:Valves ","title":"Pinch valve"},{"id":"8108616","text":"Glenisle, also known as Glen-Isle on the Platte and Glen Isle Resort, is a rustic-style resort hotel built at the turn of the 20th century.

It extends for from an intersection with NY 5 in the village of Fonda to a junction with NY 67 in the town of Johnstown. The highway is two lanes wide for its entire length, with the exception of a long climbing lane northbound leaving the hamlet of Sammonsville, located southwest of NY 67\\\\. Route description NY 334 at the Fulton County-Montgomery County line in Mohawk NY 334 begins at an intersection with NY 5 (West Main Street) just east of NY 30A (Broadway) in the village of Fonda. NY 334 proceeds north on Cayadutta Street, a two-lane residential street on the western end of Fonda. Crossing past a former Fonda, Johnstown, and Gloversville Railroad bridge, the route leaves Fonda near Wemple Avenue, crossing into the town of Mohawk. Paralleling Cuyadutta Creek to the south, NY 334 passes a large creek-side factory, crossing under a bridge of the Fonda, Johnstown and Gloversville, soon proceeding west across the creek. Now a residential street, NY 334 winds westward along the southern side of the creek, soon bending northwest through Mohawk, entering the hamlet of Berryville. In Berryville, NY 334 becomes a two-lane rural roadway, intersecting with the northern terminus of County Route 35 (CR 35; Martin Road). At this junction, NY 334 goes northwest through Mohawk, leaving the hamlet of Berryville as it crosses over Cayadutta Creek once again. The creek and highway begin paralleling each other once again, crossing another former railroad alignment before intersecting with the western terminus of CR 30 (Old Trail Road). At CR 30, NY 334 takes over the former's right-of-way, which crosses northwest into Fulton County and the town of Johnstown. Now a two-lane residential street, NY 334 proceeds northwest into the hamlet of Sammonsville. In Sammonsville, NY 334 intersects with Electric Light Road and the eastern terminus of CR 116\\\\. At CR 116, NY 334 leaves Sammonsville on a northeastern alignment through Johnstown. Northeast of Sammonsville, the route becomes a two-lane farm road, passing several homes in between fields. A short distance later, NY 334 enters a junction with Union Avenue Extension and NY 67, which serves as the northern terminus of NY 334\\\\. The right-of-way continues east on NY 67 into the city of Johnstown. History Most of what is now NY 334 was originally improved to state highway standards in the early 20th century as part of three separate projects. The first section of the road to be brought up to standards was the piece between the Fonda village line and the hamlet of Berryville, legislatively designated as State Highway 302 (SH 302). Construction on the road took roughly 18 months, and the highway was added to the state highway system on January 21, 1908. The portion of modern NY 334 in Fulton County was designated SH 619 and accepted into the state highway system on January 7, 1918, following two years of work to rebuild the road. The segment between the two improved highways was assigned SH 515 and improved under a contract let on November 2, 1916. It was 16% complete as of the end of 1918 and finished by 1926. The three unsigned state highways were designated as NY 334 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.

The team is largely an allegory for the perils of \\"unrestricted state power and authority.\\" History First Strike was sent to the Arizona desert by their commanding officer Father Time, to bring the Freedom Fighters back to S.H.A.D.E. headquarters and to arrest Uncle Sam. When the Freedom Fighters refused to go peacefully, they engaged in a fight that First Strike won until the new Black Condor made the scene. Having over-powered First Strike, this allowed the Freedom Fighters some time to get back on their feet. Human Bomb, one of the Freedom Fighters, killed Propaganda, a member of First Strike. First Strike returned to S.H.A.D.E. headquarters. Father Time was disappointed with their loss, and expressed his anger by ripping off Chief Justice's pinky finger. The team returned when the Freedom Fighters attacked a plane containing Gonzo the Mechanical Bastard who was being used by S.H.A.D.E. to imitate the President of the United States. First Strike failed again to defeat the Freedom Fighters, with Americommando killed in the battle. Members *Americommando: First Strike's second commander.

Education Walls gained a BSc in physics and mathematics and a first class honours MSc in physics at the University of Auckland. He then went to Harvard University as a Fulbright Scholar, obtaining his PhD in 1969. He was supervised by Roy J. Glauber who was later awarded a Nobel prize in 2005. Career and research  After holding postdoctoral research positions in Auckland and Stuttgart, Walls became a senior lecturer in physics at the University of Waikato in 1972, where he became professor in 1980. Together with his colleague Crispin Gardiner, during the next 25 years he established a major research centre for theoretical quantum optics in New Zealand and built active and productive collaborations with groups throughout the world. In 1987 he moved to the University of Auckland as professor of theoretical physics. His major research interests centred on the interaction and similarities between light and atoms. He was notable for his wide-ranging expertise in relating theory to experiment, and was involved in all major efforts to understand non-classical light. A seminal paperJ Phys B 9, 1199 (1976) by Walls with his first graduate student Howard Carmichael, showed how to create antibunched light, in which photons arrive at regular intervals, rather than randomly. Walls was a pioneer in the study of ways that the particle-like nature of light (photons) could be controlled to make optical systems less susceptible to unwanted fluctuations, in particular by the use of squeezed light, a concept formulated by Carlton Caves. In squeezed light, some fluctuations can be made very small provided other fluctuations are correspondingly large. He made major contributions to the theory of quantum measurement such as those involving Albert Einstein's\\"which-path\\" experiment, and the quantum nondemolition measurement. Walls also used a simple field theoretical approach to explain and corroborate Dirac's description of photon interference and in particular Dirac's statement \\"that a photon interferes only with itself.\\"D. F. Walls, A simple field theoretical description of photon interference, Am. J. Phys. 45, 952-956 (1977). In the later stages of his career he focused his research efforts on the theoretical aspects of the newly created state of matter, the Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate (BECs). Some of his contributions in the field include the prediction of the interference signature of quantized vortices, and the collapses and revivals of the Josephson coupled BECs.

On September 20, the Knicks GM traded veteran, all-star, and team captain center Patrick Ewing to the Seattle SuperSonics in a four-team deal that saw back-up center Chris Dudley and the Knicks 2001 first-round draft pick go to the Phoenix Suns, in return for forwards Glen Rice & Lazaro Borrell, guard Vernon Maxwell, centers Luc Longley, Travis Knight, Vladimir Stepania, a 2001 first-round draft pick from the Los Angeles Lakers, a 2002 first-round draft pick from the Seattle SuperSonics, and two 2001 second-round draft picks. Rice played in 75 games, averaging 12 points-per-game for New York before being traded to Houston. Knight appeared in 126 games over three seasons, averaging less than 9 minutes per-game. Longley played in 25 games for the Knicks averaging 2 points and 2.6 rebounds, while Borrell, Maxwell, & Stepania never saw action for the team. Ewing's production had decreased due to age and chronic injury over the past few seasons, and team brass felt that a deal was in the best interest of the future of the organization. On January 30, 2001, guard Erick Strickland and a first and second-round draft pick from the Ewing trade was sent to the Vancouver Grizzlies for back-up forward/center Othella Harrington.

On paper this trade looks merely like a swap of average NBA players, but this was not the case. Eisley would end up playing in 154 games for Knicks, providing adequate numbers at the point guard position, but he was currently in the second year of a 7-year, $41 Million contract that he signed by Layden's former organization, the Utah Jazz. At the same time, Anderson, another former member of the Jazz was in the first year of a 6-year, $42 Million contract that he signed with the Rockets, which extended through the 2006-07 season. Anderson played in 245 games for the knicks over four seasons before being waived due to poor performance; he averaged less than 3 rebounds and 8 points-per-game during his stay. In comparison to the contracts New York gave up, Bogues was in the second year of a 4-year $8 Million contract with the fourth year being a team option, and Rice was under contract for three more years and $27 Million.Search Basketball Transactions The trade proved to be a bad financial decision as the team was well over the salary cap limit. Layden's next major move came after the unexpected resignation of head coach Jeff Van Gundy on December 8. Don Chaney was selected as an interim coach for the remainder of the 2001-02 season. After the team went 20-43 .317% under his command, he was given a contract extension for the following season. 2002‚Äì2003 The biggest move that Layden made during the 2002-03 season was completed on draft night. After selecting Nen√™ with the 7th pick in the 2002 NBA draft, he was immediately traded along with Marcus Camby and Mark Jackson to the Denver Nuggets in return for power forward Antonio McDyess, the draft rights to guard Frank Williams and a 2003 second-round draft pick.Nuggets reel, then deal/ Rebuilding starts - again - with McDyess Gazette, The (Colorado Springs) Find Articles at BNET.com McDyess, a former #2 draft pick, was already limited to role-player status due to chronic injury; He played only 18 games for the Knicks. Williams was a disappointment from the beginning, his Knick career lasted 65 games with only three starts. On the other end of this transaction, Denver received a solid NBA player in power forward/center Marcus Camby. Camby had averaged a double-double (at least 10 rebounds and 10 points per-game) over his last two seasons as a Knick and nearly 2 blocked shots, along with being an integral part of New York's eastern conference title in 1999. 2003‚Äì2004 Layden's last season as the GM for the Knicks started off with the selections of Mike Sweetney from Georgetown with the 9th-pick in the draft, Maciej Lampe of Poland with the 30th-pick, and Slavko Vrane≈° of Serbia and Montenegro with the 39th-pick. Sweetney was later traded by Layden's successor Isiah Thomas as part of the deal with the Chicago Bulls that saw the Knicks acquire center Eddy Curry. Lampe never played in a game for New York as he was later traded to the Phoenix Suns, also by Thomas as part of the deal that saw Stephon Marbury come to the Knicks. Vrane≈° also never saw NBA action with New York, he was waived by the team after being tendered a 1-year minimum contract; currently his career spans one game with the Portland Trail Blazers. On July 23, 2003 Layden traded guard Latrell Sprewell with two years remaining on his contract to the Minnesota Timberwolves as part of a four-team trade that also included interactions with the 76ers and Hawks. In return, the Knicks acquired veteran forward Keith Van Horn.

Mankind spent 10 years devising a plan to survive. The Dobias went out to live in space while the Shioru forged a new world underground. Three hundred years ago, mankind returned to the surface from beyond the stars and beneath the ground. But the surface was not what it once was, and mankind was forced to battle for supremacy with a new life form born from the ashes of destruction. Man was no longer at the top of the food chain. That spot was occupied by the Siliconians, creatures who roam the landscape searching for prey. Meanwhile, the Dobias‚Äîscientists and nobles‚Äîand the Shioru‚Äîfarmers and nomads‚Äîare engaged in a cold war over the limited remaining resources, a cold war that threatens to turn hot.

Foregrips can decrease accuracy in precision rifle shooting if the shooter tends to \\"muscle the weapon\\".

Legality on pistols in the U.S.  The legality of vertical foregrips on pistols in the United States is unclear. In the United States, firearms are categorized by the National Firearms Act and firearms manufactured with specific features are subject to restrictions and controls. In the case of a vertical forward grip on a pistol, the law does not explicitly define such a feature as belonging to any category. In May 1993, in response to legal action brought by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the South Carolina District Court's finding of fact concluded that a pistol modified with the addition of vertical fore grips was still a pistol and not any other weapon device.U.S. v. Davis, Cr. No. 8:93-106, Report of Magistrate Following this, the ATF dropped their charges and the case was not tried; as such no precedent was set. In an open letter sent to Federal Firearms Licensees in April 2006, the ATF stated their interpretation of the law: that installing a vertical forward grip on a handgun is the same as manufacturing an Any Other Weapon (AOW) category firearm and subject to registration and taxation, with significant penalties for manufacturing or possessing such an unregistered weapon.U.S. Department of Justice, Open letter to Federal Firearm Licensees concerning Adding a Vertical Fore Grip to a Handgun.

It is the tenth entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959. Plot In an adaptation of the 1913 play Pygmalion by George Bernard Shaw, Professor Richmond (Harry Holman), certain that environment and not heredity dictates social behavior, bets one of his peers, Professor Nichols (Robert Graves) $10,000 that he can take a common man and through environment and proper training turn him into a gentleman. Professor Richmond responds that there are always one or two exceptions to every rule, but agrees on a wager for Professor Nichols to train three common people to become gentlemen. Naturally, the Stooges, who are garbage men, are discovered and made the subjects of the wager. After many attempts to teach them proper etiquette (including a dance class punctuated by an errant bee that flies down the back of their female dance instructor), the Stooges will decide the wager by their behavior at a fancy society party given by Richmond. The party does not go well: Curly pulls Moe's jacket threads until it splits. Moe then hijacks Curly's oversized jacket. Larry and Moe dance with stomped feet and bumps galore. Curly, as usual, gets most of the faux pas: he shaves in front of a guest; he gets stuck on a spittoon; he picks a \\"mascasino\\" (maraschino) cherry from a punch bowl; he hides a bottle of champagne, which Moe sees. Frustrated, Moe kicks Curly in the pants, resulting in the champagne popping open and spraying a guest. Also, Curly has stolen silverware that he has hidden under his clothing. When Moe hits him, the silverware drops onto the floor. Eventually, Professor Richmond admits he's lost the bet and gives a check to Professor Nichols. Nichols in turn apologizes to Mrs. Richmond for annoying her with the \\"rowdies\\". The remark does not go over well with her, and she says \\"Spread out!\\" and then slaps him in the face, apparently having picked up the Stooges' behavior. Professor Richmond laughs, and Mrs. Richmond slaps him. In quick succession, the guests begin imitating the Stooges and laugh at each other's misfortunes. Slaps and gouges fly until the party becomes a melee of Stooge-born slapstick. The Stooges, disgusted by it all, realize that this is what they get for \\"associating with the hoi polloi\\" and decide to leave, but Richmond and Nichols get the last laugh on them via champagne bottles crashed onto their heads. Production notes The idea for Hoi Polloi came from Moe Howard's wife, Helen, who was offered either screen credit or money (she took the latter). Moe later stated that the plot of Hoi Polloi was so good that it bore repeating. The Stooges reworked the film twice more, as Half-Wits Holiday in 1947 (Curly's final starring role) and Pies and Guys in 1958.Lenburg, Jeff; Howard Maurer, Joan; Lenburg, Greg; (1982). The Three Stooges Scrapbook, Citadel Press. Filming for Hoi Polloi was completed May 2‚Äì6, 1935. In the first street scene where the Stooges are rubbish sanitation workers, the original \\"Hollywoodland\\" sign is visible in the distance. On the street is a marquee advertising the film Mississippi featuring Bing Crosby. Coincidentally, this film also co-stars Fred Kohler who portrayed Double Deal Decker in the short Horses' Collars released the same year. In the Three Stooges 75th Anniversary Special, hosted by Woody Harrelson, the dancing scene with Geneva Mitchell was voted by the fans as their favorite Stooge moment of all time. The dancing sequence footage would be reused in 1941's In the Sweet Pie and Pie. This is the first of three shorts in which Curly gets a sofa spring attached to his back. The spring gag would be used again in Three Little Sew and Sews, An Ache in Every Stake, with Shemp Howard in Hugs and Mugs and Curly-Joe DeRita in Have Rocket, Will Travel. During the dance sequence, Larry loses his shoe. At one point actress Phyllis Crane, dancing with Moe, trips on the shoe and falls down, visibly striking her head on the floor; this was not scripted. A colorized version of this film was released in 2006. It was not released on a Stooge DVD, but rather as a hastily added DVD bonus feature for the Jamie Foxx movie Breakin' All the Rules.

Crimes Irvin was ultimately arrested in connection with six murders which were committed in four separate incidents. This killing spree began December 2, 1954 and ended March 28, 1955. The crimes took place in Vanderburgh and Posey counties in Indiana and Henderson county in Kentucky. The victims were: * December 2, 1954: Mary Holland, 33. Shot in head at close range at work. She was 3 months pregnant. Motive: Robbery. *December 23, 1954: Wesley Kerr, 29. Shot in head at close range at work. Robbery. *March 21, 1955: Wilhelmina Sailer, 47, Mt. Vernon, Indiana. Housewife, killed at home. Shot in head. Burglary. *March 28, 1955: Goebel Duncan, 51. Henderson, Kentucky. Burglary. **Raymond Duncan, 29, Goebel's son. **Maple Elizabeth Duncan, 20, Dorris Ray's (Raymond's brother) wife. In the last incident, Goebel's wife, Mamie, was shot but survived, permanently blinded. Elizabeth had a two-year-old daughter who was spared. In connection with the confession they claimed to have extracted from Irvin, the police claimed he admitted to two dozen burglaries and robberies. It turns out that Irvin had a criminal history. He had received a sentence of 10 to 20 years for armed robbery in Indianapolis in 1945, served 9 years, and moved to Evansville in May 1954. Capture Irvin became a suspect after someone recalled seeing his car at the Duncan property slightly before the murders there. This led to his arrest. Later, weapons and some loot that tied him to one of the murders were found. He was captured the first time because his car was spotted on a rural road in Western Vanderburgh County. It was seen by Edward Peerman, Gary Peerman, Alan Peerman, Russell Peerman, Pete Molinet and Larry Weber. The boys recognized a dent in the door of his car that had been reported in the paper. It had been parked on a lane off the road and the boys pulled in right behind him and yelled at him. They were just out having fun and were not sure it was Leslie Irvin at the time. The parents of the Peerman boys called the police and they verified that it was indeed Leslie Irvin the boys had seen on the road. Trials and appeal After some wrangling between Kentucky and Indiana over which would try Irvin first, it was decided to begin with the trial for the Kerr murder. Pretrial publicity was seen as a problem from the onset. Irvin's appointed attorney immediately moved for a change of venue from Vanderburgh County because of the difficulty of seating an impartial jury. The request was granted, but only to neighboring Gibson County. Ninety-five percent of the homes in Gibson County received newspapers with articles about the case, and the area was blanketed with radio and television reports. In the Supreme Court review, Justice Frankfurter made a special point \\"to attack the District Attorney's 'collaboration' with the media campaign\\" associated with the arrest and trial. During the course of the voir dire examination, which lasted some four weeks, petitioner filed two more motions for a change of venue and eight motions for continuances. All were denied. Of the 430 potential jurors, 268 were excused for having fixed opinions about Irvin's guilt, 103 others were excused based on their opposition to the death penalty, and others were excused by the prosecution or defense or on hardship grounds. Of the twelve jurors finally selected, eight went into the trial believing Irvin was guilty. During the trial, Irvin was led to courtroom on what resembled a chain dog leash. Because of that, and the brutality of the crimes, he was referred to in the news from then on as \\"Mad Dog.\\" Furthermore, the prosecutor called him \\"Mad Dog\\" in his closing statement. He was found guilty and sentenced to death. Irvin escaped from the Gibson County jail in Princeton, Indiana on January 20, 1956. He did this by making keys with paperback novel covers, tin foil, and glue. He fled to the West. But on February 9, 1956 he was arrested in San Francisco while trying to pawn some rings taken in a Los Angeles burglary. After several procedural steps, Irvin found himself before the United States Supreme Court on a 6th Amendment claim that he was not tried before an impartial jury because of extensive pretrial publicity. On June 5, 1961 the Court reversed his conviction. It was the first state conviction to be reversed mainly by prejudicial publicity. :*The constitutional claim arises in this way. Six murders were committed in the vicinity of Evansville, Indiana, two in December 1954, and four in March 1955. The crimes, extensively covered by news media in the locality, aroused great excitement and indignation throughout Vanderburgh County, where Evansville is located, and adjoining Gibson County, a rural county of approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The petitioner was arrested on April 8, 1955. Shortly thereafter, the Prosecutor of Vanderburgh County and Evansville police officials issued press releases, which were intensively publicized, stating that the petitioner had confessed to the six murders. The Vanderburgh County Grand Jury soon indicted the petitioner for the murder which resulted in his conviction. This was the murder of Whitney Wesley Kerr allegedly committed in Vanderburgh County on December 23, 1954. Counsel appointed to defend petitioner immediately sought a change of venue from Vanderburgh County, which was granted, but to adjoining Gibson County. Alleging that the widespread and inflammatory publicity had also highly prejudiced the inhabitants of Gibson County against the petitioner, counsel, on October 29, 1955, sought another change of venue, from Gibson County to a county sufficiently removed from the Evansville locality that a fair trial would not be prejudiced. The motion was denied, apparently because the pertinent Indiana statute allows only a single change of venue.\\" Irvin was retried and convicted on June 13, 1962. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and died at Indiana State Prison, Michigan City on November 9, 1983 of lung cancer.  See also  *Irvin v.

He was most recently known for an altercation with Prince William. Background and education The eldest son of Allen Bathurst, Lord Apsley, and his wife Violet (n√©e Meeking), he was educated at Eton College, Ridley College, St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada, and Christ Church, Oxford. Military and political career His father having been killed in 1942 while on active duty during World War II, Bathurst succeeded to the family titles on the death of his grandfather, the 7th Earl Bathurst, in 1943. He joined the military in 1948, when he was appointed a Governor of the Royal Agricultural College. Lord Bathurst was commissioned, served in the 10th Royal Hussars and later the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars, and promoted Captain in the Territorials to the local cavalry regiment, the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars. While working on his estate he was made Joint MFH of the Vale of White Horse hunt. He later held political office under Harold Macmillan as a Lord-in-Waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) from 1957 to 1961. The Conservative government recommended him as a Deputy Lieutenant of the county in 1960. Briefly he was promoted a junior minister as Joint Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department from 1961 to 1962. He was a Deputy Lieutenant for Gloucestershire from 1960 to 1986, following which he left politics to run the family estate based around Cirencester Park. According to the 2003 Sunday Times Rich List he was tied at position #904 with a number of others. On retiring he took up residence at Manor Farm, Sapperton near Cirencester. Lord Bathurst married Judith Mary, daughter of Viscount Nelson and had issue of two sons and a daughter.  Publicity  Bathurst was rather notoriously involved in an altercation with Prince William in the summer of 2003. According to the noted sources, the altercation occurred on Lord Bathurst's property at Cirencester Park, Gloucestershire. He was driving a Land Rover Defender, when Prince William, after playing polo at the club, overtook Lord Bathurst in a Volkswagen Golf car. Lord Bathurst, unaware of the driver's identity, was infuriated by what he saw as a reckless disregard for the driving rules that guide cooperation between his estate and the polo club. In his attempt to keep up with the Prince, Lord Bathurst engaged in off-road manoeuvres, finally being stopped by the Prince's security team. As Lord Bathurst told the BBC, \\"There are rules in the polo club about driving on the [Bathurst family] estate, and people have to stick to them.\\" Ultimately, no harm was done, as there were no resulting injuries and Clarence House issued a formal apology to Lord Bathurst.
