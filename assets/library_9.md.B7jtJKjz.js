It later dissolved into the nascent Czech communist movement, before seeing a resurgence after the fall of the Fourth Czechoslovak Republic in the Velvet Revolution.  Precursors  Traces of anarchism can be seen at the beginning of the Hussite movement. The Hussites, inspired by the teachings of Jan Hus, held that all authority (including the Church) was unjustifiable because it did not follow God's laws. Hence they supported the rights of ordinary subjects to rebel and establish a \\"society of equals.\\" Although the revolutionary T√°bor did establish consumer communism in its beginnings, the authorities were not suppressed (on the contrary, Jan ≈Ωi≈æka imposed an authoritative military order). A radical faction, the so-called Adamites, separated from the Hussites. They believed that the kingdom of God had already come to pass, but that it would be established by men. They denied all authority, such as marriage, and instead exercised absolute freedom, including free love. Adamites and other followers of folk radicalism (historian Vladim√≠r Li≈°ka refers to them as the \\"far left\\" of the movement ) were gradually eliminated by the Hussites. Outside the Hussite movement, there was a religious thinker Petr Chelƒçick√Ω, who sympathized with the Hussite socially critical views, but rejected violence and armed struggle. He opposed the social hierarchy (the so-called \\"triple people\\"), criticized the Catholic and Hussite nobility and opposed the existence of states. As an early pacifist, Chelƒçick√Ω is considered to be a forerunner of Christian anarchism and anarcho- pacifism, his teachings were an influence on Leo Tolstoy. Modern anarchists espouse the Hussites and Czech brothers as their predecessors, judging that \\"the ideas of the Czech revolutionaries of the fifteenth century were anarchist and communist in nature.\\"  Turn of the 20th century  The emergence of the anarchist movement in Bohemia and Moravia was closely connected with the split in the Czech Social Democratic Party. The moderate wing promoted parliamentarism and reformism as a peaceful path to socialism. The radicals, inspired by the ideas of Johann Most, instead called for an economic, collective and individual struggle. It was from this radical wing that the modern Czech anarchist movement emerged. On the pages of radical magazines and newspapers, \\"propaganda by deed\\" was promoted as a tactic. However, the issue of the using violence, which also provided a justification for state repression against the workers' movement, became the subject of debate in the anarchist movement over time. During the 1890s, a form of so- called \\"independent socialism\\" prevailed in the movement. It built on absolute individual freedom and achieved a response in the student progressive movement. In 1896, the half-censored \\"Manifesto of Czech Anarchists\\" was published. In 1904, the \\"Czech Anarchist Federation\\" (CAF) was formed, which demanded the spread of anarchism between the working class and the intelligentsia. In the same year, the \\"Czech Federation of Trade Unions\\" (CFVO) was founded, based on the principles of anarcho-syndicalism and the political neutrality of trade unions. The CFVO was officially banned in 1908. In 1914, the creation of a \\"Czech Anarchist Communist Party\\" was discussed among anarchists, but this idea was largely rejected. Instead, the Czech Anarchist Federation was transformed into the Federation of Czech Anarchist Communists (FƒåAK).  First Republic  Many anarchists took part in resistance activities against Austria-Hungary, which in turn led to the creation of the First Czechoslovak Republic. But experiences during the First World War and subsequent political developments led most of the anarchist movement in the Czech Republic to revise their political views and practices. They adopted a vision of joining a revolutionary-based political party. Many anarchists, especially Bohuslav Vrbensk√Ω and the union leaders of North Bohemian miners, established closer cooperation with representatives of the Czech National Social Party (ƒåSNS). In February 1919, the liquidation congress of the Federation of Czech Communist Anarchists (FƒåAK) took place, which agreed to merge with the ƒåSNS. By the mid-1920s, Czech anarchism had lost its momentum, owing to the increased influence of Marxism-Leninism over the Czech social movement. The group that formed around Stanislav Kostka Neumann established contacts with the Communist International and participated in the founding of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. However, after the 5th Congress of the Communist Party in 1929, Neumann and his companions were expelled for releasing the Manifesto of Seven, in which they protested against the Bolshevization of the party.  After 1989  The Czechoslovak Anarchist Association was established in the 1980s, even before the Velvet Revolution. After the revolution and the fall of the Fourth Czechoslovak Republic, other organizations began to appear. During the 1990s, the Federation of Social Anarchists, Federation of Anarchist Groups and Czechoslovak Anarchist Federation were formed. By the 2010s, there were several other anarchist organizations and groups in the Czech Republic, including those operating internationally, such as Antifa, Anarchist Black Cross, Anarcho-Communist alternative, Food Not Bombs, Animal Liberation Front and Voice of Anarchopacifism.

The service was launched on July 7, 2016. It is administered by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) and is operated by Bicycle Transit Systems. The system uses a fleet of about 1,400 bikes and includes 93 stations in Downtown Los Angeles, Venice, and the Port of Los Angeles.  History  Bike share station in Downtown LA Compared to other U.S. cities, Los Angeles was relatively late in implementing a municipal bike sharing program. Efforts to create such a program failed in 2013, and at one point the city was the only one of the ten largest U.S. cities to lack a bike sharing system. The city council finally approved a plan in August 2015 to create a downtown pilot program that would function as a partnership between Metro and the city. The system began operations on July 7, 2016 with 1,000 bikes and 65 stations in Downtown Los Angeles. In July 2017, Metro Bike Share expanded to Pasadena and the Port of Los Angeles with 30 and 13 new stations, respectively. The system further expanded to the Venice Beach/Santa Monica area in September 2017 with 15 new stations. After a little more than a year of operation, the Pasadena service was canceled in September 2018 due to low ridership and high operating costs. Metro Bike Share is the first bike share system in the U.S. to be integrated as part of the city's existing public transit system. While other cities' bike share systems are usually operated by the municipal transportation department or an independent group, L.A.'s bike share is operated by Metro and allows riders to purchase rides using the same regional TAP card that is used on Metro's buses and trains. The city has plans to eventually allow riders to transfer directly between Metro buses and trains and Metro Bike Share for no additional cost.  Fares  Metro Bike Share charges for single rides at a rate of $1.75 for every 30 minutes. They also offer long-term passes for $5 per day, $17 per month, and $150 per year, which allows riders to take an unlimited number of free trips that are less than 30 minutes. However, riders must pay $1.75 for every 30 minutes beyond the first 30 minutes, even if they have a long-term pass. Riders can use the TAP card to purchase passes, but they have to set up a separate account for Metro Bike Share. Stored value and passes associated with Metro's other services or other regional bike share systems are not valid for use with Metro Bike Share, and there are no discounted or free transfers to or from those services as of October 2018.

The trail has a length of . Access to the US 202 Parkway Trail is provided through numerous trailheads along the route. The trail was constructed along with the US 202 parkway beginning in 2008 and was completed in 2012. Route The US 202 Parkway Trail begins at an intersection between US 202 and PA 63 (Welsh Road) in Montgomery Township in Montgomery County. The trail heads north from PA 63 along the east side of the US 202 parkway. The US 202 Parkway Trail comes to an intersection with Knapp Road, where a path crosses US 202 and leads to a parking lot along Knapp Road. From here, the trail continues north to PA 309 (Bethlehem Pike), where it turns north along the west side of PA 309 and passes under US 202. The US 202 Parkway Trail reaches a parking lot along PA 309 and does a loop to head northeast along the west side of US 202 and come to a bridge over itself and PA 309. The trail continues northeast to the Costco Drive/Terrace Way intersection, where it crosses over to the east side of US 202. The US 202 Parkway Trail crosses PA 463 (Horsham Road), where the Joseph Ambler Inn is located to the east of the trail and offers restrooms and parking. Past PA 463, the trail continues northeast along the east side of US 202 to County Line Road. Upon crossing County Line Road, the US 202 Parkway Trail enters Warrington Township in Bucks County and passes west of a parking lot providing access to the trail. The trail winds northeast along the east side of US 202 and crosses PA 152 (Limekiln Pike). Past PA 152, the US 202 Parkway Trail continues northeast and passes under Pickertown Road, with a spur providing access to that road. The trail reaches Bristol Road, where it crosses back to the west side of US 202 and comes to a parking lot. Following this, the US 202 Parkway Trail continues into Doylestown Township and comes to a bridge over the Neshaminy Creek. The trail winds northeast along the west side of US 202 and comes to Lower State Road, where it crosses to the east side of US 202. From here, the US 202 Parkway Trail heads east and comes to its terminus at a parking lot along New Britain Road next to Doylestown Central Park. Restrooms and parking are located at Doylestown Central Park. At its northern end, the US 202 Parkway Trail connects to the Doylestown Community Bike & Hike System. The US 202 Parkway Trail has a total length of . The trail is paved and is separated from the US 202 parkway by split-rail fences and grassy strips. The US 202 Parkway Trail features rolling hills and offers views of farmland and woodland. History The US 202 Parkway Trail was planned as part of the US 202 parkway, a realignment of US 202 between Montgomeryville and Doylestown. The plans originally called for a freeway but were scaled back to a parkway in 2005 after funding for the road was cut. Construction on the US 202 parkway began in November 2008 for the section between PA 63 and PA 463. In January 2010, construction started for the section of the US 202 parkway between PA 463 and PA 611. The US 202 parkway and the US 202 Parkway Trail were opened on December 3, 2012.

History In 1974, the husband and wife pair of Florence Ludins-Katz and Elias Katz founded Creative Growith in their garage. Ludins-Katz was an artist and Katz was a psychologist. A product of Bay Area grassroots collectivism and the disability-rights movement of the 1970s, the nonprofit Creative Growth Art Center is currently run by the filmmaker and former curator, Tom di Maria. Eventually, Creative Growth relocated to a former auto-repair shop near downtown Oakland, California where it currently operates. Creative Growth was featured in the October 1990 issue of Elle Decor in an article tilted \\"Aimed Straight From The Heart\\" written by Susan Subtle. Subtle reviews the organization highly. She compares the style of art made at creative growth to Outsider, Primitive, Naive, Brut, and early-American folk art. In 2010, Matthew Higgs, Director/Chief Curator at White Columns, curated a show titled \\"Everyone!\\" that featured over 130 works made by Creative Growth artists and included each and every artist currently enrolled in the studio program. In 2018, a segment in the ninth season of Art in the Twenty-First Century, Art21 talks to some of the artists and administrators involved with Creative Growth.

A poem is created out of poetic devices composite of: structural, grammatical, rhythmic, metrical, verbal, and visual elements. They are essentially tools that a poet uses to create rhythm, enhance a poem's meaning, or intensify a mood or feeling.  Poetic device style  Poetic Diction is a style of writing in poetry which encompasses vocabulary, phrasing, and grammatical usage. Along with syntax, poetic diction functions in setting the tone, mood, and atmosphere of a poem to convey the poet's intention.  Types of poetic diction   Sound  Poetic devices that have a sonic quality achieve specific effects when heard. Words with a sound like quality can strike readers as soothing or dissonant while evoking certain thoughts and feelings associated with it. * Alliteration‚ÄìA string of three or four instances of the same consonant sound with no more than one intervening, non-alliterative onset consonant sound. Alliteration is used as a mnemonic device to evoke feelings such as fear and suspense in poetry. * Assonance‚ÄìRepeated vowel sounds in words placed near each other, usually on the same or adjacent lines.These vowel sounds are usually accented or stressed to give musical quality to the poem. By creating an internal rhyme, this also enhances the pleasure of reading the poem. * Consonance‚ÄìRepeated 'consonant' sounds at the ending of words near each other, usually on the same or adjacent lines. These should be in sounds that are accented, or stressed, rather than in a vowel. * Cacophony‚ÄìA discordant series of harsh, unpleasant sounds to convey disorder. This is often enhanced by the combined effect of complex meanings and pronunciation. Example: My stick fingers click with a snicker And, chuckling, they knuckle the keys; Light-footed, my steel feelers flicker And pluck from these keys melodies. ‚Äî‚ÄúPlayer Piano,‚Äù John Updike. * Euphony‚ÄìA series of musically pleasant sounds that give the poem a melodious quality, conveying a sense of harmony to the reader. * Onomatopoeia‚ÄìIt is used in poetry to create aural effects that mimic the visual image described. A combination of words may be used to create an onomatopoetic effect. It is, however, not imperative to use words that are onomatopoetic in and of themselves. For example, in Samuel Taylor Coleridge‚Äôs 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner', Coleridge uses the phrase ‚Äúfurrow followed free‚Äù to mimic the sound of the wake left behind a ship.  Rhythm  Poetic rhythm is the flow of words within each meter and stanza to produce a rhythmic effect while emphasising specific parts of the poem. * Repetition‚ÄìRepetition often uses word associations to express ideas and emotions in an indirect manner, putting emphasis on a point, confirming an idea, or describing a notion. * Rhyme‚ÄìRhyme utilises repeating patterns to bring out rhythm or musicality in poems. It is a repetition of similar sounds occurring in lines in a poem which gives the poem a symmetric quality. * Caesura‚ÄìA metrical pause or break in a verse where one phrase ends and another phrase begins.  Meaning  The use of figurative language as a poetic device function to convey the poet's intended meaning in various ways. * Allusion‚ÄìA brief reference to a person, character, historical event, work of art, and Biblical or mythological situation. * Analogy‚ÄìDrawing a comparison or inference between two situations to convey the poet's message more effectively. Example: The plumbing took a maze of turns where even water got lost. * Metaphor‚ÄìMetaphors are used in poetry to explain and elucidate emotions, feelings, relationships, and other elements that are better described using evocative language. Poets also use metaphor as a way of explaining or referring to something in a brief but effective way. * Symbol‚ÄìAn object, event, animal, or person to which we have attached meaning and significance. * Symbolism‚ÄìSymbolism in poetry is using an object or action that suggests something beyond its literal meaning. Symbolism means to imbue objects with a certain meaning that is different from their original meaning or function. It is a representative of other aspects, concepts or traits than those visible in literal translation. Other literary devices, such as metaphor, allegory, and allusion, aid in the development of symbolism. * Hyperbole‚ÄìAn outrageous exaggeration used for effect. Example: He weighs a ton. * Irony‚ÄìA contradictory statement or situation used to expose a reality contrary to what appears to be true. * Imagery‚ÄìNot simply a visual representation, in poetry it sustains or comprises figures of speech such as the following: \\" My heart opens like a cactus flower \\". In this simile from Stevie Smith‚Äôs ‚ÄòLe D√©sert de l‚ÄôAmour‚Äô (1938), the image of a cactus flower imbues the poem with layers of conceptual as well as visual weight. * Oxymoron‚ÄìA combination of two words that appear to contradict each other. * Paradox‚ÄìA statement in which a contradiction may reveal an unexpected truth. * Personification‚ÄìAttributing human characteristics to an inanimate object, animal, or abstract idea. Example: The days crept by slowly, sorrowfully. * Pun‚ÄìA play on word in which words with totally different meanings have similar or identical sounds.  Poetic form  Poetic form is the physical structure of the poem: the length of lines, rhythm, as well as system of rhymes and repetition. The poet's ideas and emotions are reinforced through this structural embodiment.  Types of poetic form  Edward Lear  Fixed verse  A poem which follows a set pattern of meter, rhyme scheme, stanza form, and refrain. * Ballad‚ÄìA narrative poem written in a series of quatrains in which lines of iambic tetrameter alternating with iambic trimeter. It typically adopts a xaxa, xbxb rhyme scheme with frequent use of repetition and refrain. Written in a straight-forward manner with graphic simplicity and force, ballads are lyrical and convey a wide range of subjects frequently associated with folklore or popular legends. * Haiku‚ÄìA Japanese form of poetry deeply influenced by Zen Buddhism. It consists of three non-rhymed lines of five, seven, and five syllables. The elusive nature of its form lies more in its touch and tone rather than in its syllabic structure. A haiku typically adopts a brief description of nature to convey implicit insights or essence of a moment. It is also common for haikus to embody a direct or oblique reference to a season. * Limerick‚Äì Popularized by Edward Lear in his Book of Nonsense published in 1846, a limerick is considered the only fixed form of English origin. It is a light or humorous form of five chiefly anapestic verses with a rhyme scheme of aabba. Modern limericks generally use the final line for clever witticisms and wordplay while its content often tends toward the ribald and off-color. * Lyric‚ÄìDerived from the Greek word lyre, lyric poetry was originally designed to be sung. It is the most frequently used modern form, including all poems in which the speaker‚Äôs ardent expression of emotion predominates. Ranging from complex thoughts to simple wit, lyric poetry often evokes in the readers a recollection of similar emotional experiences. * Ode‚ÄìSeveral stanzaic forms that are more complex than that of the lyric. It is embedded with intricate rhyme schemes and an irregular number of lines of considerable length. Written with a rich and intense expression, an ode is structured to deliver an elevated thought to praise a person or object. ‚ÄúOde to a Nightingale‚Äù is an example. * Rondeau‚ÄìA fixed form used in light or witty verses. It consists of fifteen octo- or decasyllabic lines with three stanzas and two rhymes applied throughout. A word or words from the initial segment of the first line are used as a refrain to end the second and third stanza to create a rhyme scheme aabba aabR Gabbana. * Villanelle‚ÄìA poem consisting of two rhymes within five 3-line stanzas followed by a quatrain. The villanelle conveys a pleasant impression of simple spontaneity, as in Edwin Arlington Robinson‚Äôs 'The House on the Hill'.Shakespeare Sonnet 18 * Sonnet‚ÄìA fourteen- line poem in iambic pentameter with a prescribed rhyme scheme. Traditionally used to convey the idea of love. Shakespeare‚Äôs sonnet sequence, for example, seeks to discover new ways of imagining love. In Shakespeare‚Äôs sonnet 130, he describes the lady‚Äôs beauty skillfully and playfully such that every image of beauty it sets up is immediately refused to mock conventional Renaissance ideas of female beauty.  Blank verse  Also known as ‚Äúun-rhymed iambic pentameter\\", blank verse is an unrhymed verse written in iambic pentameter. In poetry, it has a consistent meter with 10 syllables per line (pentameter). Unstressed syllables are followed by stressed syllables, five of which are stressed but do not rhyme. * Trochee‚ÄìA trochee is a two-syllable metrical pattern in poetry in which a stressed syllable is followed by an unstressed syllable. * Iamb‚ÄìA two-syllable metrical pattern in poetry in which one unstressed syllable is followed by a stressed syllable. * Anapaest‚ÄìA three- syllable metrical pattern in poetry in which two unstressed syllables are followed by a stressed syllable. * Dactyl‚ÄìA three-syllable metrical pattern in poetry in which a stressed syllable is followed by two unstressed syllables. * Spondee‚ÄìA beat in a poetic line that consists of two accented syllables. It is a poetic form that is less common than other metrical feet. It is rare to find poems written in spondee alone as poets use often use it in combination with other metrical feet.  Free verse  A poetic form free from limitations of regular metric rhythm and fixed rhyme schemes. The lack of regularity and conventional rhyme schemes allows the poet to shape the poem freely. Such irregularity and lack of refrain also evoke a sense of artistic expression. Examples of free verse include 'A Noiseless Patient Spider' by Walt Whitman.  Punctuation  Punctuations as poetic devices Punctuation is an object of interpretation in poetry; it is semantic. In poetry, they act as non-verbal tools of poetic expression. A form of artistic choice, the poet's choice of punctuation is central to our understanding of poetic meaning because of its ability to influence prosody. The unorthodox use of punctuation increases the expressive complexity of poems, or may be used to align poetic metres. Unconventional use of punctuation is also employed to stress the meaning of words differently, or for dramatic effect. End-stopping is when a punctuation‚Äîof any kind‚Äîat the end of a line is accompanied by a strong pause. The occasional end-stopped line may evoke a sense of finale or formality while many end-stops in a row may be used to evoke a jerky cadence. On the contrary, a lack of punctuation allows the reader to interpret the sequence of words in various ways. A lack of punctuation may allow the poem to be interpreted as a \\"stream of consciousness\\" such as Maya Angelou‚Äôs I know why the caged bird sings. * Question marks‚ÄìIn poetry, they are used to reflect a contemplative pause. * Exclamation marks‚ÄìIndicates surprise, joy, and other strong emotions the poet is trying to emphasise or convey. * Ellipses‚ÄìLeaving out part of a sentence or an event by substituting it with ellipses is a stylistic element. It represents an omission of words which helps in advancing the story. * Parentheses‚ÄìIt is technically used to separate and subordinate segments of a prose sentence. In poetry, parentheses draws attention to what is encased within them. In Cummings‚Äô poem, 'Somewhere i have never travelled, gladly beyond', parentheses are used to convey a sense of intimacy and contemplativeness: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ your slightest look easily will unclose me though i have closed myself as fingers, you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens (touching skilfully, mysteriously) her first rose‚Ä¶ (i do not know what it is about you that closes and opens; only something in me understands the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses) nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands\\". * Enjambment‚ÄìA lack of punctuation. It creates run on lines where a thought, phrase, or clause in a line of poetry does not come to an end break, but moves on to the following line. It may be employed to reinforce a central idea by eradicating the use of semi-colons, periods, or commas which may distract the reader. Enjambment is also employed to achieve a fast pace or rhythm.

Life Coke was the eldest son of Thomas Coke, Lord of Dudlington. He was created a knight banneret during his lifetime. Coke was the marshal of the army of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, the lieutenant of King Edward III of England and accompanied the Earl of Lancaster to Spain in 1343. He was the Seneschal of Gascony between 25 March 1347 and 1349. While leading an Anglo- Gascon relief force of 500 mounted men to relieve Lusignan Castle in 1349, Coke was intercepted by a Poitevin army, led by Jean de Lille, Seneschal of Poitou at Lunalonge. The Poitevins numbered some 1,500 men, which approached the Anglo-Gascon force in three mounted battles. The Anglo-Gascons withdrew to a small rise, dismounted and sent their horses to their baggage train at the rear. The Poitevins circled round the Anglo-Gascons, attacking their baggage train and then proceeded attacked the rear of the Anglo-Gascons. The first two Poitevin battles charged at the Anglo-Gascons, but they stood firm, using their lances as improvised pikes. The Poitevins repeatedly attacked the Anglo- Gascons lines but failed to break through into the Anglo-Gascon schiltron and suffered heavy casualties. The third Poitevin battle did not attack, holding its position waiting for any opportunity to exploit any weaknesses in the Anglo-Gascon lines. When none had arisen by nightfall the third Poitevin battle retreated back to Lusignan with the captured horses. In the course of the fighting, 300 Poitevins were killed and many were captured, including Lille and Jean de Boucicault. He was appointed the captain of Villefranche in 1350. Coke died before his father and Coke's only son Thomas died without issue.

He currently plays for Leinster in the Pro14. Abdaladze was born in Georgia and raised in Ireland, he has played for Ireland U-20s. Early life Born in Kutaisi, Georgia, Abdaladze moved to Ireland with his family at the age of 5, where they settled in the Dublin suburb of Blanchardstown. Abdaladze was more interested in football than rugby for most of his childhood, but started playing rugby for Coolmine RFC at the age of 12 and was originally a centre. His father Nick coached him at u-17 level at Coolmine, himself having played number 8 for the Georgia national rugby union team. After moving to Clontarf F.C., coaches there converted the young centre to his current position of prop, noticing he had the physical attributes required to play in the front row. Leinster Rugby Having missed out on an academy place after leaving school, Abdaladze spent three years combining full-time studies in Dublin City University with the grind of the sub-academy. Eventually, strong performances in the AIL for Clontarf F.C. meant he was a late addition to the Leinster academy in the middle of the 2017‚Äì18 season, at the unusual age of nearly 22. Within weeks he had also made his debut for the senior team. Abdaladze was then awarded his first senior contract ahead of the 2018‚Äì19 season after spending less than a year in the academy. He scored a try against Zebre on his second appearance for the province. Ireland Abdaladze was not selected for the Ireland U-20s for the 2016 Six Nations Under 20s Championship, but as with making the Leinster Rugby academy he was eventually rewarded for his efforts when being named in the Ireland squad for the 2016 World Rugby Under 20 Championship. Ireland achieved their best ever tournament placing of runners-up, eventually losing to the England U-20s in the final. Abdaladze was part of the side that beat the New Zealand U-20s for the first time ever at the tournament.

In May 1847, Abzelaziz was a signatory to the treaty with the British, the 'Engagement to Prohibit Exportation of Slaves'.

A number of men attempted to help themselves to the cargo of the partly wrecked boat, and Abzulaziz personally forced the crowd back at swordpoint, protecting both the cargo and crew.

His reign, while largely peaceful, saw the expansion of Wahhabi influence in the Trucial States.  Al Zorah fort  Rashid was involved in the attempt to build a fortification at Al Zorah, on the coast of Ajman to the south of Hamriyah. Originally an uninhabited sandy island surrounded by mangrove swamps, in 1866 Khalid bin Sultan Al Qasimi of Sharjah, supported by Rashid bin Humaid and with the financial assistance of the Wahhabi agent, Turki bin Ahmed Al Sudairi, erected a fort there. As the development 'threatened the peace of the coast' according to the British, it was bombarded by the British ship HMS Highflyer and reduced to rubble.  Maritime Peace  Ajman during Rashid's reign benefited from the period of relative peace and calm that followed the 1853 Perpetual Maritime Treaty, when both maritime trade and pearl fishing were able to both thrive and prosper. One of the rare major breaches of that treaty was to come in 1882, when a number of boats from Ajman were implicated in an attack on a Turkish-flagged boat, the 'Fath Al Karim', in the Red Sea. Not only had Ajman boats taken part in the raid, but the booty had been landed at Ajman. The British promptly despatched HMS Arab to Ajman and nine boats of Ajman's fleet were burnt as an example. A spat between Sharjah and Ajman boats broke out on the pearling banks in 1884, resolved this time by the British burning the Sharjah boat. Although the seas were relatively calm, a number of events took place over Rashid's reign to disturb the peace on land. Principle among these was the constant problem of absconding debtors. Escaping a debt, a trader would flee from one emirate and take refuge in the next, leading to constant breakdowns in the relationships between the coastal communities. Rashid bin Humaid signed the 'Absconding Debtors Agreement' of 24 June 1879, which the British hoped would act as an effective instrument of extradition between the Rulers.

Immediately prior to the signing of the agreement, a representative of the Persian Government had attempted to establish a Persian claim to the territory, obviating any British interest. The 1892 agreement brought the adventure to an early conclusion. September 1892 saw Humid bin Rashid beating off an attack by Ajman's old rival and sometime ally, Sharjah together with Umm Al Qawain. Despatching a boat full of armed men to aid Humaid in meeting the attack, Rashid bin Maktoum breached the 1853 Maritime Truce and was forced to pay a fine. Humaid bin Rashid was not popular among his peers, having failed to pay allowances from the state revenue to his family members. On the morning of 8 July 1900 he was murdered and his uncle, Abdulaziz bin Humaid, assumed power.

It began as a shoe company in San Francisco, and they branched out into making handbags in 2020, and have opened further stores in Washington, D.C., Boston and New York City. Rothy's items are made from 100% recycled plastic water bottles and post-consumer recycled materials. As of 2020, the company had repurposed 50 million water bottles in the making of their products. As of April 2018 the six officers running the company were all women, and out of the 30 running the San Francisco office, only 9 were men. History  The company began in 2012 with Stephen Hawthornthwaite, an investment banker, and Roth Martin, a creative. Their goal was to create a stylish and comfortable women‚Äôs flat shoe, reducing the excess that occurs with a traditional shoe making process. There was significant delay between the founding of the company and the launch due to the complexity of making the product. He states that he drew inspiration from companies like Patagonia in making shoes using sustainable materials. In December 2015, Rothy's briefly went to market but quickly stopped taking orders for six months. In Summer 2016, Rothy's resumed marketing, offering its first two styles, The Flat and The Point, from its website. In January 2017, Rothy‚Äôs opened its own 65,000 square foot factory in Guangzhou, China with nine employees, which grew to 100 by August 2017. As of April 2019, Rothy's had 70 employees in the US and 450 in China. Investors in the company include Goldman Sachs and Lightspeed Venture Partners, who have invested $35 million and $5 million respectively, and $2 million in convertible notes from Finn Capital Partners, M13 and Grace Beauty Capital. In 2018, Rothy's experienced a 350% compounded growth rate with over $140 million in sales, selling over 1 million pairs of shoes. Rothy‚Äôs opened their first brick-and-mortar store in San Francisco in May 2018. As of March 2020, they also have stores in Washington, D.C., Boston and New York City. Due to competitors copying the design and selling the shoes for cheaper prices, the company has made a significant effort to protect the brand from counterfeits and imitators. As of March 2019, 31 patents had been issued, with some 40 cases pending. In March 2020 the company announced the launch of their handbag range. At the time the company stated that they had repurposed 50 million plastic bottles in the making of their products.  Design and Product  Rothy's make a number of shoe silhouettes, including The Flat, The Point, The Loafer, The Sneaker, The Chelsea, The Mary Jane, and The Lace Up. As of December 2018 there were some 60 possible combinations of color and style. Rothy's products are made from 100% recycled plastic water bottles and post- consumer recycled materials. During the manufacturing process, the water bottles are hot washed and sterilized. Chips of plastic are melted down into pellets, stretched into fibers, and given air treatment until they entwine. The soft yarn produced is then loaded onto knitting machines which knit the upper part of the shoe in 14 to 24 minutes, depending on the design. They are then sewn to the sole by hand, paired with recycled foam and recycled rubber soles. According to Business of Fashion Rothy's range caters to women looking for an alternative to sneakers or ballet shoes. The Point is the best-selling of the flats, retailed at $145. Business Insider states that the shoes are very light and flexible with no hard seams or edges, and also notes that they are moisture-wicking, so function throughout the year with sweat or in the rain. The shoes are machine washable and can be air dried in 40 minutes. The company has also ventured into the children's market, launching a children's version of the brand‚Äôs popular loafer silhouette in 2018 and slip-on sneakers for kids in March 2019. The sneakers come in both solids and unisex prints. On March 2, 2020 the company announced the launch of handbags made from recycled plastic. The new handbags are sold in seven different styles and five silhouettes, the Essential Tote, the Handbag, the Dual-Zip Crossbody, the Essential Pouch, and The Catchall and are priced from $65 to $350. Reception The shoes have been well-received by fashion critics, particularly for their comfortability and durability. Robin Hilmantel of Women's Health described the shoes as \\"comfortable as they are chic\\". Kavita Varma-White of Today described Rothy's as the \\"perfect travel shoe\\". Megan O'Neill of Parade noted a new trend among celebrities, in that many are now favoring flats over heels.

He steered Ajman through a period in which tribal conflicts triggered instability throughout the coast but was to ultimately meet the fate he had himself engineered for his predecessor.  Coup  In 1900, following a coup in which Abdulaziz' nephew, Humaid bin Rashid Al Nuaimi II was murdered, Abdulaziz took power with popular support. He wrote to the British Resident at Bushehr, confirming his accession and his agreement to abide by all of the treaties between his predecessors and the British. He also moved to ensure that British subjects resident in Ajman were assured of their safety and that of their interests. A close friend of Saqr bin Khalid Al Qasimi, Sheikh Abzulaziz travelled to Sharjah to attend the Curzon's Viceregal Darbar of Curzon on 21 November 1903. Abdulaziz was present at the first formal meeting of the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast, in April 1905. The meeting was attended by Sheikh Zayed of Abu Dhabi; Sheikh Saqr bin Khalid Al Qassimi of Sharjah; Sheikh Rashid bin Ahmad Al Mualla of Umm Al Quwain. The meeting was called as the result of a dispute which had arisen between Masfout and Hajarain (today known as Hatta) in the Wadi Hatta, in which the Bani Qitab tribe had built a fort in the wadi and were stopping caravans passing to and from Oman. Masfout at the time was linked to the Na'im of Buraimi, another branch of Ajman's ruling family. Following this meeting, Sheikh Rashid bin Ahmad Al Mualla also arranged a reconciliation between the Sheikhs of the Bani Qitab and Abdulaziz bin Humaid. Abdulaziz also entered into a further treaty with the British in 1902, abolishing the arms trade.  Al Zorah  The area of Al Zorah came to the fore in 1895, when the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan made moves to establish a northern beach-head there. Although this plan was ultimately frustrated by the Rulers of the northern emirates, Abdulaziz inherited the problem when a section of the Sudan (singular: Al Suwaidi) tribe requested permission from the British Resident to settle Al Zorah and were granted this in 1897, with the support of Zayed. Sheikh Zayed was a Suwaidi on his mother's side and a daughter of the Sudan Sheikh, Sultan bin Nasir, was married to Zayed. Abdulaziz moved immediately to build a fort blockading the landward access to Al Zorah and, simultaneously, Sheikh Saqr bin Khalid Al Qasimi, the Ruler of Sharjah, petitioned the British against the establishment of an alien community in the middle of Al Qasimi territory. The permission was consequently revoked and, visiting the area of Al Zorah in 1905, Percy Cox came to the conclusion that no such settlement should take place without the unanimous consent of the Trucial Sheikhs.  Coup  A plot was hatched in 1910 by a nephew of Sheikh Abdulaziz', Mohammed bin Rashid Al Nuaimi, who encouraged a slave by the name of Yaqoot to attack and kill Abdulaziz. This triggered a general outrage and a mob formed, killing Yaqoot and forcing Mohammed bin Rashid to flee for his life into the desert. Humaid bin Abdulaziz Al Nuaimi, Abdulaziz' son, was travelling in Muscat at the time and had to rush home to consolidate his position as the next Ruler of Ajman.

His rule was marked by a running conflict with the Al Bu Shamis and their charismatic Sheikh, Abdulrahman bin Muhammad Al Shamsi.  Accession  Humaid bin Abdulaziz was travelling in Muscat when he received the news of his father's death in an attempted coup and rushed back to Ajman to consolidate his position as the next Ruler of the emirate, forcing the leader of the coup, his cousin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Nuaimi, to flee for his life. One of Humaid's first acts once he had established himself was to respond to a rather snooty letter from the British Resident to all of the Trucial Sheikhs, warning them not to undertake any concession for pearls or sponges with any foreign agent. To this, Humaid responded 'We have been obedient to your order and, God willing, we shall do nothing contrary to your view.' It was a sentiment which was not to last.Letter from Percival Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to Trucial Sheikhs, Bushire, 20 July 1911.  Ajman fort taken  Ajman Fort In June 1920, the head of the Na'im Al Bu Shamis tribe (which the Na'im Al Bu Khuraiban had originally displaced when they first settled Ajman in 1816), Abdulrahman bin Muhammad Al Shamsi of Al Heera, seized the fort of Ajman and was only removed after the intercession of the British Residency Agent. Khalid bin Ahmed Al Qasimi of Sharjah raised a force together with Humaid bin Abdulaziz and they attacked Abdulrahman in Heera. Again, the British intervened and an agreement was made that recognised Abdulrahman as a subject of Khalid's and bound him to cause no further trouble. At the time Al Heera was quite a large coastal pearling village of about 250 houses. Abdul Rahman was promised safe passage by the British residency agent as he owed money to a number of British subjects but was prevented from returning to Al Heera by Humaid bin Abdulaziz. After spending time in Ru'us Al Jibal (in Oman) and Al Khan (Southern Sharjah), Abdulrahman was allowed to return to Al Heera by the ruler of Sharjah in 1921 in a settlement at least partly enforced by the presence of the British ship HMS Triad under Captain John Pearson. This annoyed Humaid bin Abdulaziz, who gained nothing by it.  British relationship  Irritated by their constant mediation over the Al Heera affair, Humaid defied the British in the matter of a manumission certificate which he had allegedly torn up. Refusing to come on board a British ship to meet with the resident and also refusing to pay a 1,000 Rupee fine levied on him, he was finally threatened with bombardment, HMS Crocus and HMS Cyclamen both being offshore at the time. Humaid pointed out to the British that it would 'be the worse for them' if they dared to bombard his fort and they commenced fire. With one tower of the fort totally demolished and a second crumbling under cannon fire, Humaid paid the fine. In early 1922, along with the other Trucial Sheikhs, Humaid signed an agreement with the British that any oil concessions would be granted only to a British government appointee. However, no such concession was signed during his rule.  Coup in Sharjah  In January 1924, a further attack on Heera was planned by Humaid and Khalid bin Ahmed and forces from Sharjah surrounded Al Heera. Humaid was bound over not to take part in the action by the British Residency Agent and a truce was forged. Abdulrahman was forced into exile, joining his dispossessed son-in- law, Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi II, in Dubai. This final movement against Al Heera was too much for the people of Sharjah, however, and they called on Sultan bin Saqr to return and depose Khalid bin Ahmed, which they did, taking Sharjah after an 11-day battle in November 1924. This ensured that Humaid's implacable foe Abdulrahman was now allied to the powerful ruler of Sharjah. Humaid was pleased when, in 1926, the British decided to exile Abulrahman of Al Heera to Aden for four years. He was, in fact, allowed back early but too late for Humaid, who died in 1928, being succeeded by Sheikh Rashid bin Humaid Al Nuaimi III.

She was a winner of the Goethe Medal in 1995 for her contributions to the cultural relationship between Germany and Israel. Ada Brodsky (2008) Life Ada Neumark was born in Frankfurt (Oder) to Ilse Neumark and Hermann Neumark, a paediatrician. Her father worked at the municipal hospital as well as holding a private clinic. When the Nazi Party took power, he lost both positions. Her mother was a trained classical singer who had given up her professional career to take care of the family. Both Ada and Alfred became active in a local Zionist youth movement to build Erez Israel. As the repression of the Jews built up in Germany, more and more families were trying to emigrate. Alfred won a music scholarship to Emil Hauser's musical conservatory in Palestine and was allowed to leave Germany in 1938. The same year, one of Neumark's stories was published in the J√ºdischen Rundschau which convinced the Youth Aliyah that she was deserving of a scholarship to Palestine. She travelled on the kindertransport to Ben Shemen Youth Village via Trieste. At Ben Shemen, Neumark received an education in which music, theatre and literature played a major role. She, with the other children, were also closely involved in agricultural work. Ada translated between the local Hebrew-speaking children and the new arrivals from Germany. Neumark's parents needed a visa from the British Mandate in Palestine to emigrate there. This was a costly affair, requiring around ¬£1,000 or 12,500 Reichsmarks, which they did not have. Ada's aunt who was already in Palestine collected the monies with great difficulty, and a relative with British citizenship had to personally deliver it in Germany to prevent it being confiscated by the Nazis. Hermann Neumark was already arrested and was released from the Sachsenhausen concentration camp only under the condition that he would leave Germany immediately. The visas arrived just in time to save the Neumarks. Memorial plaque for Ada Brodsky In 1943, Neumark graduated high school and worked in a kibbutz. She then studied English literature and Jewish studies in Jerusalem, followed by courses in music education and musicology at the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance. Neumark married David Brodsky and had two daughters with him. She died in Jerusalem on 12 April 2011. Three plaques created by Gunter Demnig was laid in her and her parents' honour at their former home in Wilhelmsplatz in Frankfurt (Oder). Career After her school years, Brodsky began to earn her livelihood by translating German songs into Hebrew. Lyrics from compositions by Brahms, Schubert and Mahler were impossible to perform or broadcast in the German language in Israel. Neumark published several books of translations into Hebrew. Brodsky began to work at the radio station Kol HaMusica, which concentrated on classical music. She developed broadcasts over many years. Brodsky had always loved the poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke. To introduce Israeli readers to his works, she self-published a monograph on the poet, and translated poems and prose texts into Hebrew. This manuscript is considered to be the standard work on Rilke in the Hebrew language. Brodsky's interest in German literature was not restricted to the classical authors. She translated Ingeborg Bachmann's Probleme zeitgen√∂ssischer Dichtung in 2009. In music, Brodsky edited a series of pedagogical texts, Words to Sounds. In 1995, Brodsky received the Goethe Medal for her contributions to German culture.

Biography  Pirovskih was born on July 10, 1958 in Chelyabinsk to an industrial workers Gennady Alexandrovich and Olga Anatolyevna Pirovskih. After school he served in the army. After his service, he graduated from a vocational school and got a job at the Chelyabinsk Automatical-Mechanical Plant (AMZ). After the socio-economic upheavals of the country in the late 1980s to early 1990s, he quit his job and started a business - he travelled to Novosibirsk to buy goods and selling them in Chelyabinsk markets at an inflated price.–î–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π —Ñ–∏–ª—å–º –∏–∑ —Ü–∏–∫–ª–∞ ¬´–ö—Ä–∏–º–∏–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –†–æ—Å—Å–∏—è¬ª ‚Äî ¬´–õ—é–¥–∏ –∏—Å—á–µ–∑–∞—é—Ç –≤ –ø–æ–ª–¥–µ–Ω—å¬ª Pirovskih had a pathological greed for money, and according to the memories of some friends, he was an unpleasant person. Pirovskih committed his first crime in 1997, when he the concept of a fraud came to him during a traffic collision. The owner of the car that had hit Pirovskih's paid him off for not reporting it to the traffic police. As a result, he decided to engage in the so-called \\"auto-stoppers\\" method, arranging car accidents in order to obtain compensation. The first experiment was successful, and then Pirovskih actively engaged in the activity. In the same year, in the village of Novotroitsky, Sosnovsky District, on Traktovaya Street, he bought a house which he decorated for his father and then insured, forging the deed himself and then insuring it a second time with another company. He then set fire to the house and received a large amount of money from each companies. In 1997 he bought a broken Volga with clean documents on the cheap, decided to hijack the same car, removing the numbers and using it as a personal vehicle. One summer day, he got into a passing car and shot the driver Margaryan with an improvised gun, driving the body out of town. There he cut off the body's head and hands, burying them in a sand quarry, and then dumped the body in a reservoir. Thus, Pirovskih took control of the Volga, but decided to sell it after some time. He still did not quit the shuttle trading business, because he believed that the status of a merchant added more respect in the eyes of others. During one of his trips to Novosibirsk, he met Elena Gerasimova, a mother of two children, who also traded in the market. He introduced himself to her as a hero from the war in Afghanistan and a participant in the \\"Cotton Case\\" in the group of Telman Gdlyan and Nikolai Ivanov. After some time, they were formally married. Pirovskih decided to lay hold of all the apartments of his new wife's relatives. Also, his wife's cousin Andrei Bannikov, who was registered in the apartment of Elena's mother, soon returned from prison to Chelyabinsk, but Pirovskih was not going to give up his plans. He was going to sell the apartments under the pretext of moving to the Krasnodar Krai, into one big house, and would then kill everyone. However, Gerasimova's relatives refused to move. In February 1999, at the suggestion of Pirovskih, Gerasimova invited Andrei Bannikov to visit her. After a joint gathering, Bannikov, in a state of extreme intoxication, volunteered to join Pirovskih at his work. At DK Metallurgov, Alexander tore off the board from a bench and struck several crushing blows on Bannikov's head, killing him on the spot. After returning home, he confessed everything to his wife and persuaded her not to hand him over to his friends, members of local criminal groups. Not wanting to further address the issue with the apartments, Pirovskih decided to sell only his wife's apartment, whom supported her husband's idea of moving to the Krasnodar Krai. After the sale of the apartment, Gerasimova and her sons from the first marriage, Aleksey and Egor, loaded the things onto a rented truck and drove to the village of Tukbayevo, Sosnovsky District. There, on October 30, 1999, Alexander killed all three of them in cold blood, and threw the bodies into an abandoned mine shaft. The loot from the triple murder was worth $4,279 dollars.  Arrest and trial  Pirovskih was soon identified by law enforcement authorities as the murderer, but there was no evidence against him. Some time later, he was arrested and readily confessed, showing the burial place of Gerasimova and her children's bodies, as well confessing to the two other murders and numerous instances of fraud. In January 2003, the Chelyabinsk Regional Court sentenced Alexander Pirovskih to life imprisonment in a special regime penal colony. The Supreme Court of Russia upheld the verdict. Currently, Pirovskih is serving his sentence in the Black Dolphin Prison, in Orenburg Oblast.

Travel between the domes is possible only via train lines running through glass tunnels. The world outside the domes has become one of eternal darkness and is completely infested with savage lycanthropes. Within the domes, humanity is divided into the nobility and the commoner classes. Through their blood, members of noble families are able to manifest mana which grants them powerful superhuman abilities enabling them to fight and kill lycanthropes. Melida Angel was born to a noble father and a commoner mother but has never manifested mana and attends an elite academy to hone her skills with mana. On orders from Melida's noble grandfather, Lord Mordrew, the assassin Kufa Vampir is ordered to become Melida's tutor and discover if Melida is a true member of the noble Angel family. If Kufa discovers Melida is the product of her mother's affair with another commoner and not blood related to Lord Mordrew he is ordered to assassinate her. Kufa confirms Melida is likely not a noble but decides he cannot ignore her strong spirit and offers her a way to manifest her mana. With Melida able to use mana for the first time Kufa must keep his actions a secret from Melida's family and from his guild, White Knight, or both he and Melida will be executed. Characters House Angel ; : :Kufa is a member of the guild White Night, which he and Black Madia belong to. Kufa was given a job to be Melida's tutor, with the secret task of assassinating her if he found out she wasn't the proper heir to the Angel family. Ultimately, however, he goes against his orders and transfers some of his mana to her, developing a close mentor-pupil bond with Melida. He is half-human and half-vampire, the strongest of the lycanthropes. His mana class is Samurai. ; : :The heiress of the noble house Angel, a family of paladins. However, despite already being thirteen, she still hadn't awakened her mana yet. Unbeknownst to her, this might stem from her perhaps not being her noble father's biological daughter, having instead been born from her late mother's affair. She finally obtains mana after Kufa gives her some of his own, allowing her to use his Samurai class of magic. She develops strong feelings for Kufa, to the point where even after learning his true nature as a lycanthrope she accepts him and promises to keep his secret. ; : :Melida's cousin, who unlike her was recognized as a prodigy from an early age. While she and Melida have a very close, sisterly relationship, it was initially strained by their opposing status. However, following the Luna Lumiere Selection tournament, they made up and formed a unit together. Also, despite her strength, she is actually rather shy and easily frightened.

Biography Trindade was born in Sanguem, Goa in 1870 of Catholic parents. Trindade‚Äôs early education was in Sawantwadi. On his father's death, he chose to pursue his talent in Bombay, enrolling at the J. J. School of Art. While a student, he started winning prizes at the Bombay Art Society's exhibitions. In 1892, he won a silver medal for a head study and several prizes thereon. After graduation, he took up a job tinting photographs at the studio of the well-known photographer Raja Deen Dayal. He did not work here long and later became a teacher at the JJ School of Art. Soon after, he was appointed Superintendent at the Reay Workshops in preference to another teacher at the school, M. V. Dhurandhar. Trindade specialized in portraits and took on several commissions which helped him supplement his income from teaching. His oeuvre included landscapes, everyday life, nude scenes, still lifes, and religious paintings. He also excelled at other media such as wood carving, engraving and sculpture. In 1920, Trinidade won the Gold medal of the Bombay Art Society for his painting Flora which shows a reclining model. Trindade‚Äôs wife Florentina posed for this work. Intimate studies of this nature won him the title 'Rembrandt of the East' from his contemporaries. In later years Trinidade had diabetes, and had his gangrenous legs amputated as a result. His final painting was a picture of Jesus called Ecco Homo. Trindade died on 16 March 1935. His daughter Angela Trinidade was also a prominent Goan painter. Works Trindade's notable works include Hindu Girl, Girl With a Vase, Flora and his self-portrait. His paintings are in the collections of the Bhavani Museum in Aundh and the Sir. J.J. School of Art. His painting Lady with Jar is in the National Gallery of Modern Art, Delhi. Many of his works were donated by his family to the Fundacao Oriente in Panjim, Goa.

He was educated at the John Muir High School in Pasadena. He went to college at the University of California, Santa Barbara and graduated from the School of Architecture at the University of Southern California. Career Berkus established an architectural firm in Santa Barbara in the 1970s. He eventually \\"employed more than 200 architects\\", with offices in San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Washington, Atlanta, Miami, Tokyo, and Kuala Lumpur. Berkus was primarily an \\"architect of mass market housing.\\" His work included \\"resort and master-planned communities, urban infill, commercial and institutional projects, and custom homes.\\" He founded two design firms, B3 Architects and Berkus Design Studio, both based in Santa Barbara, with office across the nation and world. Berkus got his start in 1956 as an intern for the late William F. Cody, a prominent Palm Springs architect. Under Cody‚Äôs tutelage, he assimilated the principles of Modernism. Later on, after starting his own practice, Berkus put his unique signature on virtually every type of new-home design. A pivotal project for Berkus was Park Imperial South in Palm Springs, Calif. During a celebration of the community‚Äôs 50th anniversary in February 2011, Berkus remarked, ‚Äú[Park Imperial South] opened up a way of looking at living space that still informs my designs.

He will be greatly missed,\\" said architect Don Evans, The Evans Group, Orlando. \\"Barry‚Äôs fame and accomplishments as architect/planner, good citizen, and Renaissance man are well catalogued and the accolades are well deserved. Yet what many will point to is his enthusiasm for making things better, and his gift for inspiration. He made us feel like the special, talented ones, the ones who would do great things. He was an exceptional mentor and true friend, and we will carry that spirit forward. Barry would like that,\\" said Rebecca Hardin, president of Open Line Public Relations, Santa Barbara, who worked for Berkus for five years.

These include the \\"Sacco\\" bean bag chair and \\"Blow\\", the first mass-produced inflatable chair. The company was founded in 1954 and has its main plant in Nova Milanese. In 1984 Zanotta established its experimental division, Zabro, headed by Alessandro Guerriero, with Alessandro Mendini and Stefano Casciani. Since the death of its founder, Aurelio Zanotta, in 1991, it has been run by members of his family. Zanotta's products were awarded the Compasso d'Oro in 1967, 1979, and 1987. History The company was founded in 1954 by the young entrepreneur Aurelio Zanotta with its manufacturing plant in Nova Milanese where it remains to the present day. Originally called Zanotta Poltrona, at first it specialised in fairly traditional upholstered furniture. However, by the early 1960s, the company had established a reputation for modern design and began commissioning avant-garde works by designers such as Achille and Pier Giacomo Castiglioni, Gae Aulenti, Ettore Sottsass, and Alessandro Mendini. In 1965 Zanotta was one of the first furniture companies to use expanded polyurethane foam and frameless construction in its designs, most notably the \\"Throw Away\\" series of sofas and armchairs designed by Willie Landels. One of Zanotta's most enduring successes was its 1968 \\"Sacco\\" bean bag chair, designed by Piero Gatti, Cesare Paolini and Franco Teodoro. It was originally to have used polyurethane foam off-cuts for the filling but eventually settled on polystyrene beads. From the 1970s Zanotta achieved further success by re-issuing earlier designs which in their day had been considered too avant-garde for mass production. These included the \\"Larianna\\" tubular steel chair designed by Giuseppe Terragni in 1936 and the \\"Mezzadro\\" stool designed by Achille and Pier Giacomo Castiglioni in the late 1950s. Zanotta established Zabro, its experimental division, in 1983 headed by Alessandro Mendini and Alessandro Guerriero. Amongst the pieces Zabro produced were Mendini's \\"Dorifora\\" chair in 1984 and the furniture series \\"Animali Domestici\\" (Domestic Animals) designed by Andrea Branzi in 1986.. The company launched Zanotta Edizioni coordinated by Stefano Casciani in 1989, \\"a special collection exploring the boundaries between art and design.\\" The pieces were produced in limited editions and combined industrial manufacture with hand- painted decoration. In 1989, Aurelio Zanotta and several of his designers including Achille Castiglioni, Gae Aulenti, Andrea Branzi, and Ettore Sottsass attended the International Design Conference in Aspen. The conference theme that year was The Italian Manifesto. In his talk at the conference Zanotta described the emergence of the mid-20-century revolution in Italian design and the early years of his own business: > Those were years of great vitality, there was an explosion of constructive > energy, a profound desire to sweep away the past and create a new world. The > phenomenon of Italian design grew out of this widely felt urge to renew > everything. After Aurelio Zanotta's death in 1991, the company remained in his family. Since 2002 it has been run by Zanotta's three children, Eleonora, Francesca, and Martino. The Italian furniture company Tecno purchased 80% of Zanotta's shares in 2017. However, the two companies maintain separate production, design and management structures. Notable designs Notable designs produced by Zanotta include: *\\"Lariana\\" chair (1936) originally designed by Giuseppe Terragni for the Casa del Fascio. The chair, made from tubular stainless steel with a wooden back and seat, was reissued by Zanotta in 1971 and remained in production until 1995. *\\"Mezzadro\\" stool (1957) designed by Achille and Pier Giacomo Castiglioni. It was one of three prototypes for stools using found objects which were developed by the Castiglioni brothers in the late 1950s. The \\"Mezzadro\\" uses a sheet metal seat cast from that of a 1935 Italian tractor which is balanced on stainless-steel bow and a wooden crosspiece. Zanotta began manufacturing it in 1971 and gave it the name \\"Mezzadro\\" which means \\"sharecropper\\", an allusion to the agricultural associations of its seat. Examples are held in the Museum of Modern Art and the Vitra Design Museum. *\\"Throw Away\\" armchair and sofa (1965) designed by Willie Landels in expanded polyurethane foam using a completely frameless structure. Aurelio Zanotta first encountered Landels's pieces while on a trip to London in 1965 and immediately put the chair into production. Sofa versions were produced from 1966 and would later appear in the sets for Space: 1999. Initially, the pieces had washable vinyl covers in bright colors: red, yellow, green, light and dark blue. Later versions were also produced with fabric or leather covers. *\\"Karelia\\" easy chair (1966) designed by Liisi Beckmann in undulating forms of expanded polyurethane foam. It was reissued by Zanotta in 2007 and exhibited at Milan's Triennale Design Museum in 2016. *\\"Guscio\\" sleeping hut (1966) designed by in prefabricated fiberglass panels with a larch wood floor. The dome-shaped huts can sleep 2‚Äì4 people and can be assembled and disassembled at will. \\"Guscio\\" won a Compasso d'Oro in 1967. *\\"Blow\\" inflatable armchair in PVC (1967) designed by Jonathan De Pas, Donato D'Urbino, Carla Scolari, and Paolo Lomazzi. It was the first mass-produced inflatable chair. Examples are held in the Museum of Modern Art and the Victoria and Albert Museum. *\\"Sacco\\" chair (1968) designed by Piero Gatti, Cesare Paolini, and Franco Teodoro. Covered in leather or cloth and filled with polystyrene beads, it was the progenitor of the bean bag chair and is still in production today. Even before the design had been completely finalized, the American department store chain Macy's placed an order for 10,000 chairs. Examples of \\"Sacco\\" are held in numerous museums including the Design Museum in London and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. *\\"Gaetano\\" table (1973) designed by Gae Aulenti. Its plate glass top rests on two removable trestles of lacquered aluminum alloy. It was shown at the K√∂lnisches Stadtmuseum in the 1980 exhibition Italian Furniture Design: Culture and Technology in Italian Furniture 1950-1980. \\"Gaetano\\" was one of the numerous pieces of furniture which Aulenti designed for Zanotta between 1963 and 1986. *\\"Sciangai\\" coat rack (1973) designed by Jonathan De Pas, Donato D'Urbino, and Paolo Lomazzi. The collapsible rack is inspired by the Italian game Sciangai, a form of pick-up sticks. It won a Compasso d'Oro in 1979 and was exhibited at the Milan Triennial in 2012. *\\"Cetonia\\" chest of drawers (1984) designed by Alessandro Mendini. One of a series of pieces produced by Zanotta's Zabro division, it is made of lacquered wood with hand-painted decoration. An example is in the permanent collection of the Indianapolis Museum of Art. *\\"Papilio\\" coffee table (1985) designed by Alessandro Mendini.

It won a Compasso d'Oro in 1987, and an example is held in the Museum of Modern Art. *\\"Animali Domestici\\" furniture series (1985‚Äì1986) designed by Andrea Branzi and consisting of tables, chairs, and benches produced by Zanotta's Zabro division in limited editions. The pieces combined lacquered wood with tree branches and rough wooden slats and sticks. One of the chairs is held in the Vitra Design Museum. *\\"Soft\\" chaise longue (1999) designed by Werner Aisslinger, one of the first examples of mass-produced furniture using TechnoGel as visible upholstery. Examples are held in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and France's Centre national des arts plastiques. *\\"Veryround Chair\\" lounge chair (2006) designed by Louise Campbell.

The plant was the first coal-fired power plant constructed by TVA. Description The Watts Bar Steam Plant consisted of four units listed as units A, B, C, and D, with a combined generating capacity of 267 megawatts. The plant was the first coal- fired plant constructed by TVA. The interior of the plant contained a vantage point for people to view the turbine room and a spacious overlook balcony, which was also included at future plants. History The Watts Bar Steam Plant was authorized for construction on July 31, 1940, and construction began just one week later. The plant was initially planned as part of an effort to provide power to the defense industry, and originally only two units with a capacity of 60 MWe each were planned, but a third and fourth were added in April and December 1941, respectively. The first unit at the Watts Bar Steam Plant, Unit B began operations on March 16, 1942, one month after Watts Bar Dam. Unit A began operations later that year, and unit C began operation in 1943 and unit D in 1945. As TVA's first coal plant, it was intended to be a blueprint for future power plants. The plant was shut down between 1957 and 1972 and during this time precipitators were installed to meet emissions regulations. In 1973, construction began nearby on the two units of Watts Bar Nuclear Plant. The Watts Bar Steam Plant was retired in 1982, and demolished in 2011. The units at the nuclear plant, of which construction had been suspended in 1985, began operations in 1996, and 2016, respectively, the two newest nuclear power units to come online in the United States.

The first bridge at this location was a toll bridge constructed under an act of parliament in 1834. This was damaged in the floods of 1947 and a temporary Bailey bridge was constructed on top of the original structure by the British Army's Royal Engineers. This bridge was replaced by another temporary structure in 1974. The bridge is only one lane wide with access controlled by a tidal flow system controlled by signals at either end of the bridge. A separate footbridge is attached to the northern side of the structure.  Description  The bridge carries Station Lane over the River Trent and its floodplains which mark the boundary between Staffordshire and Derbyshire. The bridge is owned by Derbyshire County Council. It has a total span of and a width of . It consists of a metal truss vehicular bridge supported on two brick abutments with a concrete central pier. The east abutment and central pier lie on either side of the river and the west abutment is in the flood plain. Originally designed for a 7.5-tonne gross vehicle weight rating (GVW) traffic is currently restricted to a maximum of 3 tonnes GVW. Only one traffic lane is provided, with tidal flows controlled by signals at both ends of the bridge. Vehicles are restricted to and traffic barriers at either end narrow the road to reduce vehicle speeds and enforce a width restriction. It is lit by two street lights. The main structure consists of a steel truss with steel plate decking with a thin anti-skid coating. The brick abutments date from an earlier bridge, with the central pier being contemporary to the steel structure. A separate steel footway is attached to the northern side of the bridge. The river banks in front of the east abutment and the central pier are reinforced with pitched stones but some of these have been lost to flooding.  History  The first bridge on the site was built in 1834 by the Walton-on-Trent Bridge Company, an act of parliament authorising construction was obtained in 1833. The 1834 bridge was of iron and wood construction and was founded on iron piles. The cost of ¬£5,500 was made through the sale of ¬£10 shares and the company derived an income from the collection of a toll on travellers. Previous crossings had to be made by a ford just upstream of the bridge site or by ferry. The toll was eventually abolished and the toll house demolished at some point in the 20th century. The bridge was damaged during flooding of the Trent in 1947. The British Army's Royal Engineers were called in to erect a temporary Bailey bridge which was placed on top of the old bridge later that year. The bridge was replaced again in 1974 by a more modern version of the Bailey design, though still intended as a temporary structure.  Proposed replacement  The bridge is subject to repeated complaints about violations of the weight limit and damage caused by vehicles which are too wide to cross the bridge turning around in private driveways. There were 123 complaints about breaches of the weight limit in 2017, although only one of these incidents was investigated and it did not result in a prosecution. Concerns have also been raised by local residents about vehicles disobeying the red light signals and motorcyclists and cyclists illegally using the footway. There is a call for camera enforcement on the bridge, though the council claims it is not allowed to erect it at this location. A bypass of the village which would include a new two-directional crossing of the Trent was first proposed in 2012. If such a scheme were to proceed the existing bridge would be restricted to use by pedestrians only. South Derbyshire District Council has stipulated that any developer proposing to construct houses on the site of the former Drakelow Power Station must first construct a bridge, though one developer has been allowed to construct 400 houses on the site in advance. Discussions with developers which included revised proposals for the works were made in December 2016. In July 2018 an unnamed contractor proposed to construct the bridge and bypass, with a budget of ¬£12 million. It is not currently known if these works will proceed.

It was Taiwan's worst rail accident since a collision near Miaoli in 1991 killed 30 people. Accident Military and emergency services taking part in the rescue operation Incident scene, simplified At 16:50 local time (UTC+8), a Puyuma express train, service 6432 from bound for , derailed on a curve with a radius of when passing through the station in Yilan County, about from Taipei. There were 366 passengers travelling on the train. Of the eight carriages, numbers 3 through 8 toppled over and collided into each other in a \\"W\\" shape, while the rest went off the track with lesser damage. The front car was seen tipped over at an angle of 75 degrees, and most of the fatalities are believed to have been in this car. Survivor accounts claimed that the driver applied the emergency brake multiple times before the incident, and another claimed that the train sped up after the curve. All trains in the eastern trunk line were halted in both directions, with replacement bus services provided. Hundreds of medics and firefighters, and 100 army troops responded to the scene. As of 21:35 local time all passengers, including the dead, had been removed/evacuated from the wreckage. The derailment is the worst train accident in Taiwan since 1991, when 30 people were killed in a collision near Miaoli. Victims At least 18 people were killed in the accident, with another 187 injured, all on board. Six of the dead reportedly were under the age of 18. Taiwan's Railway Authority confirmed that 8 of the dead were of the same family, and the Health Ministry confirmed that 53 injured remained in the hospital. Investigation The train involved in the accident was built by the Japanese company Nippon Sharyo in 2011, and underwent major maintenance work in 2017. According to a press release from the Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) on 21 October, the cause of the accident is as yet unknown. On 22 October 2018, it was reported that the driver of the train reported an issue with the main air compressor just before the derailment. The Chief Secretary of Taiwan Railways Administration, Chu Lai-shun, said that a full failure of the main air compressor would cause insufficient power and problems with deceleration, but should not cause a derailment. In addition, the train's automatic train protection (ATP) was disabled shortly before the derailment, which, according to the driver was because of an earlier fault which delayed the train. Prosecutors accused him of negligence for not turning it on again afterwards. Investigators believe that without ATP enabled, the train's speed was not properly monitored, which led to the train approaching the curve at a speed of , almost twice the speed limit. As part of the investigation, all 18 other Puyama trains in service on Taiwanese railways were thoroughly inspected. No fault was found. Nevertheless, a report by Chinese-language Apple Daily Sunday found that Taiwanese trains were experiencing problems with the ATP system, citing anonymous sources from within the TRA. As the investigation progressed, technical flaws with the connection of the train's protection system to the signalling centre were found with the Puyama trains, and Japanese manufacturer Nippon Sharyo promised the Taiwanese government it would fix the flaw by 11 November, with testing and certification expected to take a month.  Driver  The driver of the train was granted bail of (US$16,167) on 23 October, after he had been detained for investigation.  Results  The conclusion of the investigation was announced by a press release on 6 June by the Taiwan Yilan District Prosecutors Office. The direct causes of the incident were found to be excessive speed in the curve and the disabling of the train protection system by the driver, in breach of relevant operating regulations. Issues with the main air compressor were found not to be a contributing factor. Improper management of the testing process of Puyuma trains, which caused an absence of testing of the ATP remote monitoring system, resulted in an indictment of the former Deputy Director of the TRA's Department of Rolling Stock and of the Chief of TRA's Central Dispatch Office. Other staff involved in the incident, such as dispatchers and mechanics, were found not to be liable, and no evidence of corruption or neglect of duty by public officials was reported. In response to views that there were shortcomings in the initial ad joc investigation, the Taiwanese government converted the Aviation Safety Council (ASC), which previously only dealt with aviation accidents and incidents, into the comprehensive Taiwan Transportation Safety Board (TTSB), which also covers maritime and train accidents and incidents. Responses President Tsai Ing-wen called the accident a \\"major tragedy\\" and directed the government and military to \\"step up\\" rescue efforts. The President also called for an investigation into the crash, that would \\"make clear the timing and situation of the whole accident\\". In addition, \\"drastic reform of the TRA to restore public confidence in the safety of railway transportation\\" is to be carried out. As a result of the incident, the Democratic Progressive Party and Kuomintang halted campaigning for the November local elections. The Taipei Blood Donation Centre issued a press release that highlighted local blood donation centres and urged blood donors to donate.  Memorials  President Tsai met with relatives of the dead and injured on 22 October. She joined Buddhist monks in prayer at an altar next to the hospital.  Legal  In March 2020, three people who worked for the TRA at the time of the derailment were impeached by the Control Yuan.

Biography M. F. Pithawalla was born in Pitha, Surat. He moved to Bombay following his father's death in 1888. He was discovered and trained by John Griffiths, the principal of Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy School of Art. His first showing at the Bombay Fine Arts exhibition won him a silver medal. Thereafter, he began exhibiting widely at shows in Simla, Bombay, Darjeeling, Madras and Pune. Pithawalla was a regular prize winner at exhibitions of art societies across India. He was the only artist to win three successive prizes at the Bombay Art Society, including a gold medal in 1908. In 1911, Pithawalla left for Europe visiting Italy, Paris and London. He had a one-man show at the Dore Gallery in London in October, 1911. Later, his portrait of Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy was displayed in an exhibition of \\"Modern Indian Art\\" at the New Burlington Galleries in London in 1934. His talent for portraiture drew praise in London. The art critic Sir George Birdwood wrote an article in his appreciation and commented on his copies of Velasquez and Rembrandt paintings, ‚ÄúWhen slightly aged, it will be hard to distinguish them from the originals.‚Äù Pithawala's portraits document the ethos and hierarchy of the colonial establishment in India. He depicted members of the aristocracy and bourgeoisie, ladies and gentlemen of high standing ‚Äì lawyers, landlords, elite merchants and their wives. He is also remembered for the album he was commissioned to make for Queen Mary on her Indian visit in 1905, containing watercolours of women from different Indian communities.

Her figure was linked to cases of corruption related to her term at PAMI, with all charges being dismissed in court. Biography Matilde Men√©ndez received her medical degree from the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) with a Diploma of Honor. After an active university militancy in Peronism, once qualified at the UBA's School of Public Health, in 1974 she was appointed Coordinator of the National Commission of Food Policy and Supply and Coordinator of the Nutrition Commission of the National Congress. With the return of democracy, she would become Secretary of the Federal Health Council, Advisor to the Commission of Social Assistance and Public Health of the Chamber of Deputies, and of the Senate's Health Commission. In 1987 she created the \\"Por Venir\\" Foundation, dedicated to the prevention of drug addiction. In 1988, she was appointed Assistant Secretary of Social Medicine of Buenos Aires Province. In 1989 she became the first woman Secretary of Public Health of the Nation, and in 1991, the first female intervener of the (now Tierra del Fuego Province). In 1992, she was called by President Carlos Menem to preside over the Board of Directors of the Comprehensive Medical Attention Program (PAMI). This directorate consisted of representatives of the General Confederation of Labor and retirees' organizations. During her tenure at PAMI, a change was made in the benefit payment system, now based on a fixed number of monthly per capita payments to the providers. Also, the \\"PAMI Listens\\" system was generalized, with a 24-hour telephone line to receive queries, complaints, and suggestions from users. At present, according to her own webpage, Men√©ndez is a teacher, researcher, adviser, and consultant to national and international private and state organizations, creator of programs, and founder of institutes dedicated to public health. Controversies PAMI After an incident in which providers were found (and filmed) in possession of envelopes with 25% of the value of the per capita payments received and presumably intended for PAMI officials for the payment of bribes, a series of denunciations were made that, together with a wide media treatment of the accusations, gave rise to a scandal journalistically known as the PAMI \\"returns\\". PAMI officials and leaders of were accused of charging monthly bribes (effusively called returns) to the providers who, by this means, made sure to continue to be part of the organization's payroll. The President and her board amassed 32 criminal complaints for various crimes that were brought in cases before the Federal Courts of the Capital, with charges ranging from the alleged hiring of a personal hairdresser to the payment of surcharges on the purchase of pacemakers. Matilde Men√©ndez decided to resign, together with the entire board. PAMI was subsequently the subject of government intervention. After five to nine years of investigation, with statements of hundreds of witnesses and reports, the 32 charges related to her term as President of PAMI were dismissed for lack of crime. Prosecution withdrawn in AMIA case Another legal case that involved Men√©ndez was her prosecution in 2003 for false testimony in the AMIA bombing case, accusing her of falsifying her statement about a telephone conversation with her lawyer Cuneo Libarona, in which they referred to a video that was presumably intended to extort Judge . Subsequently her prosecution would be withdrawn as no accusation could be brought in court.

Ramakrishnan (22 July 1922 ‚Äì 14 February 2003) was an Indian freedom fighter and social activist. He was widely known for his leadership to spread the values of Indian Culture globally as the director- general of the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan and has been awarded both the Padma Shri and Padma Bhushan by the Government of India for his service to the nation. Ramakrishnan was born in Pushpagiri, Thrissur in Madras Presidency (now Kerala). During his school days, Ramakrishnan was heavily influenced by Mahatma Gandhi and Chandrashekarendra Saraswati, the then Paramacharya of Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham after they visited Malabar district during the Vaikom and Guruvayur Satyagraha to eradicate untouchability at Hindu temples. In 1939, he came to Bombay in search of employment and joined the individual Satyagraha movement a year later that was launched by Gandhiji and took an active part in the Constructive Program. He was imprisoned at Yerawada Central Jail, Pune during the Quit India Movement in 1942. Closely associated with leaders of the Indian independence movement, he later went on to serve as the personal secretary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel after Patel's release from Ahmednagar Fort Jail on 15 June 1945 and during the 1946 Cabinet Mission to India up to a few months after he assumed the office of Deputy Prime Minister and settled down in Delhi. Not wanting to continue Government service after Indian Independence, Sardar Patel introduced Ramakrishnan to K. M. Munshi who founded Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan which he later decided to join as the secretary in 1947. He was especially devoted to the cause of Hindu-Muslim unity and was chosen as a member of the National Integration Council in 1991. The Bhavan's S. Ramakrishnan Memorial Public School at Akamala, Wadakanchery is named in his memory. Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan Ramakrishnan devoted a large part of his life to spread Gandhian ideas and Indian culture through Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. He was associated with serving the Bhavan for 56 years, joining it as the secretary in 1947 at the age of 25 and subsequently taking over as the director after the death of Bhavan's founder Munshiji in 1971 and up to his own death in 2003. Death Ramakrishnan died of a massive heart attack at his residence in Mumbai on Valentine's Day 2003 aged 81. Civilian Honours Ramakrishnan was awarded Padma Shri in 1991 and Padma Bhushan in 2001 for social work.

He waa born in County Dublin: his family owned lands at Dunsink, Castleknock. His family name is a version of Cardiff, and as the latter form of the name suggests they were of Welsh origin. James Kerdiffe of Dunsink, whose daughter Eleanor married James Barry, Nicholas's father-in- law, as his third wife before 1595, was almost certainly a close relative of Nicholas. He entered Middle Temple in 1594 and was called to the English Bar in 1600. He became Serjeant-at-law (Ireland) in 1601, with a salary of ¬£27 6 shillings per annum. Since the Serjeant was until the 1660s the senior Law Officer, ranking ahead of the Attorney General for Ireland, Kerdiffe, a relatively young and inexperienced man, seems a surprising choice for such an important office. Hart suggests that he was completely overshadowed by the Attorney General, Sir John Davis, one of the most formidable political figures in early seventeenth-century Ireland. Nonetheless the Serjeant still had an important part to play in the administration of justice. In particular, since the expansion of the assize system in the early 1600s meant that the judges of the courts of common law could not cope with the workload, the Serjeant acted as an extra judge of assize. Kerdiffe performed this task diligently enough, going on assize seven times in eight years. Assize work was onerous and time consuming, but this was compensated for by a generous extra allowance. In 1605 he was one of several commissioners appointed to inquire into title to land forfeited during the rebellions of the previous reign. Kerdiffe died early in 1609. He married Margaret Barry, daughter of James Barry and his first wife Catherine Burn. Her father's third wife, Eleanor Kerdiffe of Dunsink, was almost certainly a relative and possibly a sister of Nicholas. The Barrys were one of Dublin's leading merchant families and were later ennobled with the title Baron Barry of Santry. After Kerdiffe's death she remarried Robert Ball. Sources *Hart, A.R.

It begins with the line \\"Ich freu mich, da√ü am Himmel Wolken ziehen\\" (I enjoy that clouds travel in the sky). It was published in 1977, after her death, and was set to music by Herbert Baumann.  History  The author had moved with her family from Galicia to Berlin, where she had contact with writers such as Erich K√§stner, Else Lasker-Sch√ºler and Kurt Tucholsky. Hermann Hesse compared her to Heinrich Heine; she had a similar sense of irony, preventing sentimentality. Her poems were published in the newspapers Vossische Zeitung and Berliner Tageblatt'‚Äô. The poem was published by Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag in 1977 in the collection In meinen Tr√§umen l√§utet es Sturm (In my dreams, a storm is brewing). The collection of poems and epigrams was edited by , to whom Kal√©ko had entrusted her unpublished writings. \\"Sozusagen grundlos vergn√ºgt\\" was among 42 of her poems set to music for voice and guitar by Herbert Baumann and is the title of a CD recorded in 2011 by singer and Sebastian Albert.  Content  The poem is structured in three stanzas, the first two with eight lines, the last one with ten. It begins with the incipit \\"Ich freu mich, da√ü am Himmel Wolken ziehen\\" (I enjoy that clouds travel in the sky). The first-person speaker lists images for reasons to be happy, some of which are not necessarily reasons to be happy at first sight, such as rain, hail, frost and snow, mentioned in the second line. In the third stanza, the poet turns to herself, saying \\"In mir ist alles aufger√§umt und heiter\\" (Everything in me is cleaned-up and cheerful). It ends with the conclusion \\"Ich freu mich, dass ich mich freu\\" (I enjoy that I enjoy).

In a 3.5/5 star review, Mike Rose from Pocket Gamer wrote, \\"It's the inherent fiddliness of Toast Time that saps some of the fun out of the game,\\" but also that \\"Some players will be able to overlook many of Toast Time's issues, though, due to the game's incredible style.\\". In a 2/5 review of the PC version, Hardcore Gamer wrote, \\"Toast Time is fun, but shallow. It controls fine with a mouse, but is best experienced on mobile devices, as its phone- sized playing area just doesn‚Äôt feel right on a monitor.\\" Toby Moses from The Guardian said \\"The lovely, pixelated graphics suit the tongue-in-cheek tone, but it's by no means a simple affair--there is a challenge here...\\" Toast Time won the \\"Best Art Design\\" category in the 2014 Intel Level Up Game Developer Contest.

Early life  Little is known about Nemesk√©ri's early life. During the criminal proceedings against him, Guszt√°v reported a traumatic childhood event in which he had to supervise his younger brother, who managed to free himself from his grasp and run towards a road where he was run over by a car. Since 1995, Guszt√°v had lived on 3rd Kat√≥ka Street in Budapest, working in the vegetable and pet food business. Not wanting to develop his business, he instead decided to buy property using loans. The repayment of the loans, however, made it increasingly difficult for a man to start besieging business to repay them. Fearing that he would forced into bankruptcy, Nemesk√©ri got an improvised gun.  Murders  In 1996, an Argentinian dog breeder came to Hungary to buy dogs from Hungarian breeders. It is unknown how Nemesk√©ri met him, but on February 26, 1996, the Argentinian moved into Guszt√°v's apartment. A business-related argument occurred between them, and Nemesk√©ri shot him, stealing $6,000 dollars and a gold ring. He put the body in a bag and hid in the car parked in his yard, and after a few weeks he buried the body in his garden. He was eventually taken in by police for questioning. The authorities administered a polygraph test, but due to an investigative error, the procedure was unsuccessful. In June 1996 Nemesk√©ri had the electricity meter in his home checked by an electrician. Unsaturated, however, Guszt√°v had made falsified measurements to the device, which was detected by the electrician, who told Nemesk√©ri that he had to report this to the company, causing Guszt√°v to kill him. He plundered the corpse, stuffed it in a bag and unloaded it in front of his house. He left the bag in his courtyard and left for Vienna, where took part in a dog contest. He came home after a weekend break, and buried the man's body in his garden. In December 1997, Nemesk√©ri decided to get the money he had spent on buying stamps from a postwoman. On December 12, 1997, he chased the woman in his car on the pretext of buying a duty stamp for a mandate, but instead shot the woman. He stole 750,000 forints from her and then carried the body next to a lake on the outskirts of Cs√∂m√∂r. He then stole her personal belongings and hid them in his apartment. The decomposing body was found only in February 1998. A witness claimed to have seen the woman go into the car of a man. A good quality facial composite was created, but the police said that did not have evidence of a murder, and needed to investigate further. Nemesk√©ri also owed money to his half-brother, Zsolt, who had previously loaned two million forints to his brother and had been asking him for repayment for a long time. Guszt√°v was unable to return it, so his half-brother filed a lawsuit against him. The trial was scheduled for April 8, 1999 by the court. On April 7, 1999, Guszt√°v invited Zsolt to his apartment on Kat√≥ka Street for a non-dispute settlement meeting. Instead, he shot his half-brother, hiding his body in the basement.  Arrest and trial  The disappearance of the brother was investigated by police, and in September 1999 Nemesk√©ri was also called for questioning. He was suspected by investigators as he refused to answer any questions, but then surprisingly, he said he did not kill his brother. Police conducted a search at his house in Kat√≥ka Street, and found Zsolt's corpse in the basement. Officers then reported to have found other corpses around the house. Guszt√°v denied having any involvement in the murder of his brother and the three other victims, but the detectives did not believe him. He did not confess in court until he recognized his brother's murder, but when in his last statement, he accused his brother of the murders, explaining the change of his religion as a sign from of admission by P√©ter Doszpot on the scene. According to Guszt√°v's testimony, Zsolt was a soldier and violent figure, who loved his family despite his abilities, claiming the murders were because of his brother's fierce character. He claimed that the Argentine dog breeder was accidentally shot by his brother while he was playing around with his weapon, but he only realised the accident when he came home from the store. He also claimed to have taken the electrician to his brother, as he was struck by lightning, and Zsolt had become so angry that he shot the electrician, also shooting the postwoman when they started fighting. Guszt√°v selfishly considered himself a victim, repeatedly referring to the importance of family relations in the court, saddened by his half-brother's and the electrician's deaths. However, the tactic did not work. In his judgment, the judge underline that Nemesk√©ri had escaped jail after his first murder and had the opportunity to change his lifestyle, but instead turned towards more murders. At the first instance of the Metropolitan Court, Nemesk√©ri was sentenced to life imprisonment, a sentence which could only be reviewed 40 years later. The first instance verdict from the prosecutor was accepted, but Guszt√°v filed for a pardon. In the second instance judgment, the Municipal Court of Appeal essentially left the initial verdict unchanged, only finding that the fourth murder was for the sombre reason of exasperating the man's punishment to an actual life-span. In the end, the \\"Kat√≥ka Street Killer\\" was sent to the Star Prison in Szeged to serve out his life sentence.  References   External links  * A man who has no heart (in Hungarian).

She was cacica of her people in the 1770s, the most powerful such ruler in her region. During the uprising, she served as both a strategist and a military officer. She was executed for her role in the rebellion alongside Tupac Amaru II, his wife Micaela Bastidas Puyucahua, and their son Hip√≥lito Condorcanqui Bastidas. Personal life Tomasa Tito Condemayta was born in 1729 to an Inca noble family in an area of Peru that is now the Acomayo province in the Cusco region. Her parents were Sebasti√°n Tito Condemayta, kuraka of the Tito Condemayta ayllu and godfather of Tupac Amaru II, and Alfonsa Hurtado de Mendoza. Sources give contradictory information as to her domestic life. In a 2005 work, scholar David Garrett stated that she was married to Tomas Escalante and bore him a daughter, who wed the cacique of Papres, Evaristo Delgado. In a 2008 article, Garrett stated that she was married to Faustino Delgado. Unusually for the area, the Tito Condemayta ayllu embraced a lengthy hereditary rule, and Tito Condemayta became cacica of her people after her father, standing as the most powerful in the area.  Rebellion  When Tupac Amaru II and his wife Micaela Bastidas Puyucahua called for a rebellion against Spanish rule in Peru in 1780, Condemayta left her husband and children to join the rebels in Tinta. Her embrace of the rebellion was not universal within her family, as her son-in- law, Evaristo Delgado, remained loyal to the Spanish throne. Condemayta played an important role in the rebellion. Together with Amaru, she mobilized indigenous women for the uprising. She was a military strategist as well as an officer leading her own women's battalion.Marquez, Humberto. \\"Latin America: Women in history: more than just heroines.\\" Interpress Service 9 Sept. 2009.

In 1781, fortunes turned to the much better-armed Spaniards, and on April 7, Condemayta was captured, along with Tupac Amaru II and Bastidas Puyucahua and their sons Hip√≥lito and Fernando. On May 18, 1781, Condemayta was executed after severe torture together with Tupac Amaru II and Micaela Bastidas Puyucahua and their son Hip√≥lito Condorcanqui Bastidas in the main square of Cusco. She was the only native noble executed alongside the rebel leader. After being asphyxiated slowly with a hand-cranked metal garrote especially constructed for the occasion, she was hanged to ensure she was truly dead.

Most of its buildings display Eclectic, Art Nouveau or early modernist architectural styles. One of them is registered on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship heritage list. Location The street is located to the north of downtown district (), and follows a west‚Äìeast axis, parallel to the north to Adam Mickiewicz Alley. To the west, it starts at Gda≈Ñska Street and its western tip ends when meeting with Niemcewicza street: in its course, it crosses 20 Stycznia 1920 and Paderewskiego streets. History The path has been developed lately at the beginning of the 20th century, under Prussian rule. First reference to the then Stein Stra√üe is mentioned in the 1908 Bromberg Address Book, as being vacant or under development. First houses appeared in 1909, and by the outbreak of WWI, a dramatic increase of construction of the plots can be noticed. Naming Through the course of Bydgoszcz history, the street swapped its calling between the Prussian initial name Stein stra√üe (from 1908 to 1918 and during the German occupation) and the Polish one (from 1918 to 1939, and since 1945). Current name Zamoyskiego street refers to Jan Zamoyski (1542-1605), a Polish nobleman, Lord Grand- Chancellor and Grand Hetman of the Crown from 1581. He was an advisor to Kings Sigismund II Augustus and Stephen B√°thory, one of the most skilled diplomat of his time, standing as a major figure in the politics of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth throughout his life.

Layout  The precise location is in Pudakpayung, Banyumanik in front of the Kodam IV/Diponegoro military base. Vihara Bodh Gaya Watugong cultural complex consists of two main buildings/temples: Pagoda Avalokitesvara and Pagoda Dhammasala. It is surrounded by smaller temples and other buildings. The two temples incorporate classic oriental design and architecture. Other buildings include the Watugong rock, Borobudur plaza, Kuti Meditasi, Kuti Bhikku, public reading park and library, Buddha Parinibana, Abhaya Mudra and the Bodhi tree. The tallest tower stands at 45 meters, the tallest pagoda tower in Indonesia. A five-meter statue of the Guanyin Bodhisattva is located in one of the towers. This complex was formerly used exclusively as a Buddhist religious temple. With its classical oriental design and architectural heritage, the Vihara Bodh Gaya evolved to become a cultural and heritage tourism site by the local populace and the government of Semarang.  History  Bodhi tree planted within the Watugong complex in 1955. The Watugong complex stretches back to the Majapahit. Buddhism was then the official religion. With the fall of Majapahit empire and the spread of Islam, the practice of Buddhism fell drastically. Buddhism reemerged 500 years later. The first attempt to evangelize Buddhism came in the Dutch colonial era through Ashin Jinarakkhita with the encouragement of Narada Maha Thera. In 1955, Semarang/Chinese landlord Goei Thwan Ling was so impressed by Ashin Jinarakkhita at the Vesak 2549 celebrations at Borobudur temple that he donated some of his land to build the temple complex Vihara Bodh Gaya. The temple complex was devoted to teaching Buddhism and the development of the religion. By the end of 1955, Ashin Jinarakkhita maintained a permentant residence at the Bodh Gaya temple complex. He dedicated his life to the complex. In February 2001, the complex underwent major renovations under Sangha Theravada, after eight years of neglect. Renovations started with the Dhammasala building which finished on November 3rd, 2002. The building was reopened by the Central Java Governor at the time of H. Mardiyanto. Other buildings followed. The Pagoda Avalokitesvara started renovations in November 2004 and reopened on July 14th, 2005.Brosur Vihara Buddhagaya  Dhammasala Temple  The Dhammasala temple is one of the main buildings. It is located on the right side of the vihara. A two story building with the first floor used as a function hall and the second floor used for prayer, hosting a statue of Buddha. It has a total capacity of 1000 pilgrims. The staircase to the prayer hall is outside the building. No interior staircase exists. The building attracts tourists mainly because of the oriental architecture that contrasts with traditional Javanese pendhapa architecture surrounding the complex. Another centerpiece is a 5-meter brass statue of sitting Buddha which resembles the statue at Candi Mendut. Other functions are organizational, such as the annual local or international Buddhist convention managed by Vihara Bodh Gaya Watugong foundation.  Pagoda Avalokitesvara  A 5-meter Guanyin statue inside Pagoda Avalokitesvara. Pagoda Avalokitesvara also known as Pagoda Guanyin Pagoda Avalokitesvara (Pagoda Guanyin) is on the main path of the complex. Construction started in August 2004 and opened by July 14, 2005. This building is the tallest pagoda tower in Indonesia at 45 meters. The architecture follows the design of the main temple and represents Metta Karuna or love of Buddha. The building used concrete for the structure and brick for the walls. The outer layer is painted in red to represent happiness or luck. This tower has seven levels with thirty statues of worship inside and a five-meter Avalokitesvara Boddhisatva statue surrounded by fruits and flowers as worship offerings. Outside the perimeter of the pagoda are five Guanyin statues and one of We Po. The building has eight sides and is called Pat Kwa.  Watugong  The name Watugong derives from a natural rock formation with a gong-like shape, thus the name watu or rock and gong. This rock is unique because it naturally formed into a gong- like shape.  Bodh Gaya Foundation  The Bodh Gaya Foundation was established on October 19, 1955 to manage the day-to-day operations of the complex, and is responsible for maintenance and preservation.

The term came about as a result of Amazon's dominant role in the eCommerce market place and leading the disruptive impact of the industry. The effect has been heavily researched by numerous studies including an in-depth Harvard study by Alberto Cavallo. The Amazon Effect has been found to cause numerous changes in the retail market. Among these impacts is a increase in price flexibility and uniform pricing in traditional brick-and-mortar stores. An externality of the increasing price flexibility and uniform pricing has been a decrease in pass- through inflation. Various other studies have revealed that the Amazon Effect has forced retail malls and offline retailers to create an experience around offline shopping in order to pull business away from eCommerce. Finally, it has been discovered that eCommerce has pushed retailer to increase their incorporation of technology to make offline shopping more convenient and quicker.  Price flexibility  Price flexibility can be defined as adjustable prices that can change easily based on negotiation between buyers and sellers and changes in demand and supply. With the rise of e-commerce, prices have become more flexible because of the ability to electronically change prices in an instant. This has taken out the need for face-to-face negotiations and replaced it with electronic competition to attract the most buyers. As a result of the internet making flexible pricing more attainable and desirable, it has changed how demand and supply play out within the marketplace. Walmart and Amazon exemplify this as it has been shown that products that are both easily found and sold online at both Walmart and Amazon have twenty percent shorter price duration than those just found online at Walmart. Since prices adjust easier to changes in supply and demand both produces and consumers benefit. Consumers benefit from lower prices and producers benefit from an increase in sales especially firms with elastic demand. Not all products are affect the same though as products in categories such as recreation and electronics that possess a greater online market share have prices that are less stable over time. The opposite is true for products like alcohol who possess a smaller online market share and more stable prices.  Effects on consumers  A marketplace with price flexibility allows consumers to find prices that best fit the value they receive from the product or service. Perishable goods such as airlines seats, hotel rooms, and phone plans are the best example of this as a customer can adjust their price based on what they see value in. When consumers are able to find products that are priced to fit their utility for that product, overall demand goes up. When demand goes up, the overall standard of living goes up as they are able to consume more at a lower price. When prices are this transparent it results in the practice of showrooming. Showrooming is when a customer views a product within a brick and mortar then buys it online in order to prevent overpaying for a product. In the end, customers are left satisfied as they are able to test the product out in store and then end with a lower price by purchasing it online. In conclusion, price flexibility brings big advantages to consumers. More generally, Amazon effect seems to have generated substantial change in consumers‚Äô expectations towards both offline and online retailers, especially regarding effectiveness of customer service, online purchasing experience, and fast delivery times Vollero, Agostino, Siano, Alfonso, & Sardanelli, Domenico (2020). Amazon Effect? an Analysis of User-Generated Content on Consumer Electronics Retailers‚Äô Facebook Pages. In Advances in Digital Marketing and eCommerce (pp. 188-193). Springer, Cham. Retrieved 2020-09-22.  Effects on producers  Producers are being forced to make their prices more flexible due to Amazon's ability to rapidly change prices to fit demand with little costs. This allows Amazon to price more competitively and maximize demand. Amazon's competitive prices have trickled into other markets as 80% of consumers now check online prices and compare them to the ones in store. As a result firms are forced to lower price in order to stay competitive and not lose demand for their products. Firms operating at lower margins are also more sensitive to supply shocks, creating an environment of unstable prices. In a market where price flexibility is common, producers have the ability to price discriminate. When a producer practices pricing discrimination, they are able to capture consumer surplus through various practices. One of the common practices used is quantity discounts. For example, goods in a market are often sold at a lower price per unit when buying in bulk. Since consumers will buy in different quantities, companies are able to capture the different prices people are willing to spend for said good. Another strategy is offering different groups different prices for the same good or service. This can be seen when kids and seniors get discounts at theme parks or on public transportation.  Uniform pricing  Uniform pricing is when a company charges a universal price for its goods or service regardless of its location. An example, of this is when the price of an item of food costs the same at Walmart as any other Walmart. In the study, it is hypothesized that uniform pricing comes as a result of the openness and transparency of the internet. Huge public outcry could result from consumers realizing that they are paying more for the same product than someone else. With Amazon's transparent prices it is more difficult for them to price discriminate without anyone noticing. For example, a study found that depending on what time you want, with most retailers seeing Amazon as one of their biggest competitors, they are opening an online front in order to stay relevant and compete in the online marketplace. When this happens, their prices become transparent to all consumers, making the retailer more accountable if it chooses to price discriminate. Therefore, in order to keep customers satisfied and believe they are getting a fair deal they are pushed towards uniform pricing. In the short run, producers suffer from these strategies that reduce price discrimination and bring about uniform pricing. As a result, companies can also be more sensitive to aggregate shocks when prices are uniform.  Inflation and pass- through  Since 2009 the United States has only gone above an inflation rate of 2.2 percent once. Alberto suggests that the Amazon effect could have had a profound role in the inflation dynamics as a result of the increase in price flexibility and uniform pricing. A British study backs this as it was found that during times when prices were very flexible, the Bank of England would overestimate the impact of inflationary shocks. When prices are allowed to float, it results in faster market clearing. So while prices may be hit hard initially by an aggregate shock, they will adjust back down to market equilibrium quicker. When prices adjust back down to equilibrium overall inflation will go down as a result of a decrease in prices. Another factor in domestic inflation is a term called exchange rate pass-through. Exchange rate pass-through is any effect exchange rates have on domestic inflation. By looking back at the two categories, electronics (high online market share) and food and beverages (low online market share), the effect on inflation can be seen. While the results showed a relative pass-through of 83% for electronics, it only showed a 38% for food and beverages. Therefore, it is concluded that prices with a higher online presence tend to be more sensitive to fluctuations in exchange-rate. As a result products are more efficiently pricing causing a reduction in inflation over time.  Shopping as an experience  As brick and mortar stores attempt to compete with the growing presence of online retailing, retailers are creating an experience around offline shopping in order to draw customers into stores. One example of this is a mall in Minnesota that features an aquarium and a dinosaur walk museum. Another is the Irvine Spectrum that features a grass area to relax and sit with friends and family, a Ferris wheel, a playground for kids, an ice rink in winter, and a train for families to take around the mall. All of these features were created in order to draw customers to the mall and to offer a unique experience that cannot be found online. Another way retailers are trying to improve the shopping experience is by optimizing their store layout. Lolli and Pops was designed to allow companies to use their software to find the optimal layout of the facility to boost sales just as analytics are used to grow online sales. Oppose to fighting the online experience, some companies have tried to compliment their online website with an in-store experience such as Nordstrom Local. Nordstrom Local allows customers to order online then pick up in a store where an array of refreshments are served to them. A final strategy that retailers are employing to bring value to offline shopping is showrooms and testing areas. For example, living spaces has sample bedrooms that you can see in-store and compare with other setups around the store. All of these strategies are employed in order that customers continue to visit malls and see the value of in-store shopping.  Friction-less shopping as a result of technology  Numerous retailers have incorporated technology to mirror Amazon's fast-pace and smooth shopping experience. For example, both Amazon and Walmart have grocery deliver services where you can buy the products online and the respective companies will deliver them to your house. This has created a rivalry between the companies as hey both push to extend their grocery lines to more regions and streamline their services to make the services even easier to operate. Walmart Grocery is one of the many ways offline retailers are creating an online front in order to stay relevant in the retail industry. HP has also found a way to stay relevant and create a friction-less experience through its \\"Instant Ink\\" service. The service allows its customers to simply click a button when they are running low on ink and HP will automatically send the company the ink they need. This service is direct competition with the Amazon Dash buttons that order a product whenever the button is pushed. While offline retailers push more online content to compete with eCommerce, Amazon is pushing into the brick-and-mortar market. Amazon Go is one way Amazon is attempting to directly with offline retailers. Amazon Go allows a customer to simply scan their phone app when they walk in, grab their groceries, and then leave. This allows customers to move at their own pace, quickly get in and out the store, and make more impulse purchases  References  Category:E-commerce Category:Amazon (company) ","title":"Amazon Effect"},{"id":"58840037","text":"Julien Marchand (born 10 May 1995) is a French rugby union player.

The building is located at the rear of the block and is best viewed from Bedford Street. Its design was attributed to Francis Greenway and built from 1823. It is also known as Cleaveland. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Cleveland House was built in about 1823-4 for prominent emancipist merchant Daniel Cooper. The house was built on about of land which was originally granted to Charles Smith by Governor Macquarie in 1809.Annable, 1991. Smith used this land, known as Cleveland Gardens, as either a market garden or nursery. Upon his purchase of the land Cooper spent A¬£4,000 on construction of the house, believed to be the work of architect Francis Greenway. The Cooper family moved into the house in 1825 but only resided there until 1829 when Cooper separated from his wife. At the time the house was let to provide Mrs Cooper with a source of income. Until 1855 the house and its land was let out mainly to various families for residential purposes. However, in the 1830s the property was also used as a school. During this time the property is believed to have held prime views of the Darling Harbour and city areas. The decision in 1850 to build Redfern terminus brought industry to the area. This resulted in the subdivision of many of the gentlemen's estates in the neighbouring suburb of Surry Hills. This caused Surry Hills to be built out and changed its character from a picturesque \\"village\\" to a high density suburb. Daniel Cooper returned to England in 1831 and left the house in the trust of James Cooper on the death of his ex-wife, Hannah, in 1836. Daniel Cooper died in 1853 and James Cooper sold the estate, which now amounted to around , jointly to Moorehead and Walker. In 1855 this estate was subdivide into eight sections as part of the redevelopment of Surry Hills. The section containing the house and the outbuildings, lots 7, 8 and 12, were sold as a single property to Isaac Levey and inherited by his son, Montague, in 1860. For a short time after the subdivision the property was used for residential purposes but from 1858 the uses were varied. Uses included a school, laundry, boarding house, gentlemen's apartment and a government labour bureau. A further subdivision of land, lots 7 and 8, occurred in 1886. However, only two of these were purchased. From about the mid-1870s the outbuildings were used as a cordial factory, Barrett's. It is thought that some new buildings and extension of existing buildings took place to accommodate the factory. This use continued until it was sold to Peach and Jones bottle merchants in 1896. At this time, the house was still owned by Levey. In 1903, the Order of the Sisters of the Good Samaritan purchased the entire unit of the original 1855 subdivision, with the exception of the two lots that were purchased in the 1886 subdivision. The Order used the property as a receiving place in the city for its refuge. Cleveland House was used as a convent for the nuns. They built a large four- storey building to house the refuge and a commercial laundry which was opened in 1904. In the late 1920s the refuge became a home for aged and infirm women. In 1946 the property was sold to the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary who used it for the same purposes as the Good Samaritans. In 1958 Cleveland House was purchased by the NSW Society for Crippled Children. The refuge, built in 1904, was used as a hospital, clinic and for administration. Cleveland House was also used for administration. The former convent garden was filled in to be used as a lawn area and later for parking. Additional small buildings were constructed on the site. The property was sold in 1988 to Denerin Pty Ltd and all the buildings with the exception of Cleveland House were demolished and further subdivisions have occurred. Today there is a small garden at the front of the house and a grassed area between the side of the house and Chalmers Street. A large apartment complex is located at the rear (south) of the house. The house has been in private hands throughout its 186-year history. It is today owned by LGS Enterprise, which runs a medical education business InViVo Communications from the building.Central Sydney magazine, 10 February 2010, p.4.  Description  Cleveland House is a two-storey stucco building, built in brick on stone foundations, in the Colonial Georgian style. In 1840 and 1886 it was described as having a slated roof but in a report in 1902 it had a \\"very old iron roof\\". The verandah, supported by stone pillars, encompasses all four sides of the building on the first floor. In 1886 it is described as containing ten large rooms, including six bedrooms. In the basement there were four large cellars. The house was serviced by two staircases, one of these being an external stone staircase. The rear of the house had inner and outer courtyards which were formed by the outbuildings. It appears that some part of the inner courtyard still exists today. In 1902 the verandahs was described as being in very poor repair. Today the house does not appear to be used or is used for storage. The windows are boarded or boxed up and there is rust on the verandah areas. However, the gardens outside the house are well maintained. The original outbuildings have been demolished and the house stands alone on the property. Its lack of setting and state of disrepair do not do justice to its history as a prominent house on a large city estate.  Condition  As at 10 February 2010 the exterior is in poor condition with peeling paint and once elegant columns crumbling and dilapidated. Many of the verandah railings have fallen and part of it still shows the scorch marks from an earlier fire. Grass is growing through the floor boards in one section.  Further information  There is an underground carpark in Part Lot 3 which is part of the adjoining Meriton Unit blocks.  Heritage listing  As at 6 July 2007, Cleveland House is of State significance as a rare surviving gentlemen's residence of the 1820s, built for a prominent convict emancipist merchant Daniel Cooper. The house is believed to be the work of Francis Greenway and is an example of a good quality residence of the time. Until 1991 the house had seen continuous habitation. Changes in its usage and modifications, such as subdivision as well as erection of new and extension of existing buildings, reflect the history of this inner city of Sydney suburb. Some of these changes include residential, industrial, community service and government department use. Cleveland House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.

After the demonstration escalated into a riot he took part in the acquisition of arms from the Military Study of the Wy≈ºsza Szko≈Ça Rolnicza (Agricultural Academy), disarming of the VII MO Commissariat at Grunwaldzka 34 and in the fights on DƒÖbrowskiego Street. During these fights Janusz Kulas contributed to the procurement of a tank and made an unsuccessful attempt to bring it online. After the community riots were suppressed, he was arrested on 30 June 1956. During the investigation he was tortured into incriminating other participants of the demonstration and riot. The \\"Trial of Ten\\" began on 5 October 1956 in the SƒÖd Wojew√≥dzki (Voivodeship Court) in Pozna≈Ñ, led by judge Dionizy Piotrowski.

History Relations between the Philippines and Spain were established in 1947, shortly after the Philippines obtained full independence from the United States. Initially, relations between the two countries were conducted through a legation, with Manuel Escudero being appointed as the mission's first minister plenipotentiary. The Philippine Embassy in Madrid was established in 1951, with the establishment of full diplomatic relations between the two countries. Manuel Mor√°n, who previously was Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, was appointed as the mission's first ambassador. In 1997, the Philippine government purchased a villa in El Viso, where other embassies were also located, to serve as the Embassy's new building. After a year of renovation work, the Embassy was inaugurated by President Fidel V. Ramos in April 1998. Staff and activities The Philippine Embassy in Madrid is headed by Ambassador Philippe J. Lhuillier, who prior to his current post, served as ambassador to Portugal, and includes seven officials. Part of the Embassy's philosophy is that Filipinos living outside Madrid should not need to go to the capital in order to receive consular services. To that end, the Embassy itself also conducts consular missions in other parts of Spain at least once or twice a year, with missions traditionally being held in southern Spain, Bilbao in the Basque Country and the Canary Islands, and more recently on the islands of Menorca and Ibiza. In addition to the Embassy, the Philippines maintains a network of eight honorary consulates which provide many of the same consular services in their respective areas. However, the honorary consulate in Barcelona has been closed since October 3, 2017, when the mission's honorary consul was dismissed following his participation in that year's pro-independence general strike.

It was designed by George Allen Mansfield and built from in 1869 by A. Scott (masonry and brickwork), Mackay and Son (carpentry and finishing). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The history of Crown Street Public School dates from April 1863, when a school known as Bourke Street National SchoolPublic School from 1867 was opened in a building rented from the Bourke Street Congregational Church. In March 1876 the secretary of the Bourke Street Public School Local Board applied to the Council of Education for additional furniture for the school. On this very ordinary request appears the notation that the Council directed the Inspector to find a suitable site on which to erect a new Public School. In June 1876 the secretary for the Bourke Street Congregational Church asked for increased rent for the school premises. He also made it very clear that the Deacons believed it was time that a Public School worthy of the neighbourhood was provided. The Council of Education decided to acquire a site from W. M. MacKenzie on which to erect a new school building, located directly behind the rented school building. The present site in Crown Street was purchased in 1877. Three temporary wooden buildings were erected on the new site and the school moved into these in March 1878. At the same time the name of the school was changed to Crown Street Public School. Enrolments grew rapidly and the temporary buildings were extremely uncomfortable and overcrowded. By May 1878, 1,035 children were enrolled and this had grown to 1,405 by the end of the year. By 1879 there were 1,608 children enrolled. During the winter three teachers found the over-crowding and draughty conditions so difficult that they asked for removal to another school. No action was taken, since the new building was expected to solve the school's problems. During 1879 a permanent building was begun, designed by the Council of Education architect, G. A. Mansfield to accommodate approximately 1,200 pupils. The tenders of Mr A. Scott for masonry and brickwork and Messrs Mackay and Son for carpentry and finishing trades were accepted in July 1878. The two storey permanent building was occupied in May 1880. The temporary buildings were moved to Surry Hills South, (later Bourke Street) Public School. In 1883 the headmaster, Mr Banks complained about an objectionable picture on the wall of a house adjoining the playground. There were various proposals as to how to reduce the objectionable character of the advertisement, and finally it was painted out at Departmental expense. Unfortunately the new accommodation was still insufficient and enrolments had to be limited. In 1890 new classrooms in a separate building on the northern boundary were erected. The enrolments in 1892 was 1,720 pupils. Many Jewish children attended Crown Street Public School and in 1896, the Headmaster Mr Banks wrote an account on the instructions given in the Jewish religion. It stated that for the past sixteen years instruction on the Jewish religion had been carried out in the school. At the time of the account \\"two Hebrew teachers, specially employed by the Jewish persuasion, attend, attend for an hour each forenoon, and so arrange their classes that every Hebrew child receives two hours\\" instruction per week.' In 1897 a two-storey building containing two classrooms on the first floor and weather sheds underneath was erected towards the rear of the site. This building was enlarged so as to produce an infants school of eight classrooms in 1911. Substantial interior remodelling of the main building, discussed since 1906, was finally carried out in 1924 and a new manual training building near the southern building was also erected. Secondary education was available at Crown Street from 1881 to 1960. The school was made a Superior Public School from 1881, and from 1913 to 1947 the school had a boys commercial secondary department and a girls domestic science department form 1913 to 1928. From 1929 to 1960 a girls intermediate high school operated.Department of School Education Files  Description  A large two- storey school building in Gothic Revival style. The walls are face brick on sandstone foundations and featuring stone dressing around windows and sills, cornices and finely detailed parapet cappings. The walls contain excellent brick detailing. The plan is asymmetrical. The dominant feature is a centrally placed three storey tower roofed with a fine metal roofed spire. The roof over the main building is steeply pitched in a form similar to a mansard roof and is sheeted with corrugated metal. The building is dramatically sited on a small hill above Crown Street and in the grounds is a small cenotaph in the Anzac tradition dedicated to the former school pupils. A series of stone terraces and steps connects this to the street entrances marked by well crafted stone and iron fences.Sheedy 1977  Condition  As at 1 October 1997, the physical condition is good.

He plays as a lock. Career Born in Jelgava, the young Uldis did not play the game until he was 16. Naturally big and strong, he soon caught the eye of a couple of former Latvian internationals, one of whom gave him the money to pay for the late bus home from training he could not otherwise have afforded. He grew steadily fitter and found rugby an enjoyable release from his day job as an apprentice carpenter. Shortly after Uldis had turned 21, a Latvian referee based in Russia advised him that a club side in Siberia called Enisei- STM were trialling new players. Enisei are based in the city of Krasnoyarsk, where winter temperatures routinely dip to minus 40C. Something inside Uldis still fancied trying his luck 5,000 km east on the banks of the icy Yenisei river. On 2 January 2001, in the depths of a typically harsh Siberian winter, he arrived in Russia to pursue his dream. The early days were predictably tough. The club's forwards coach ran a hotel and allowed him to stay rent free in exchange for basic chores but Uldis's rudimentary skills were not deemed good enough to earn an immediate contract. In just his second practice session he accidentally broke a first-team lock's collar-bone, which endeared him even less to his new teammates. He stayed put only because ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to return to Latvia as a loser‚Äù. In order to discover the true depth of his resolve, the club's captain subsequently challenged the Latvian incomer to a fight. The latter's blunt refusal to back down convinced the squad it might be wiser to keep their 20 stone, 6 ft 6 in new recruit onside. It still took six months before he received his first wage packet, which was seven times smaller than his carpenter salary in Latvia. ‚ÄúI wanted to play professional rugby so badly that it didn‚Äôt bother me at all.‚Äù In his first year of pro rugby he also lost 12 kg in weight but his committed displays at lock or No8 began to win over his Russian doubters. He also put his body on the line internationally for Latvia, once turning up to represent his national team despite recently-broken ribs. Rather than letting his country down, Uldis strapped himself up with a chunk of old bed mattress, had a pain-killing jab and played on. Back in his native Latvia they nicknamed their hero The Siberian Bear and took immense pride in his exploits.

The country was devastated by the recently finished Spanish Civil War, which resulted in the defeat of the Second Spanish Republic and the creation of the Spanish State, and Catalonia, who was an autonomous region under the Republican government (1931-1939) lost the whole of its self- government when the Nationalist army occupied the area. However, despite the fact that Spain was officially neutral in World War II, the conflict affected Catalan territory and Catalans who lived outside, as well its institutions in exile, in different degrees. Prelude The industrialized land of Catalonia in Spain became autonomous shortly after the proclamation of Second Spanish Republic (14 April 1931). It established its own government, the Generalitat de Catalunya, and received and Statute of Autonomy in 1932. The Parliament and Government of Catalonia were dominated by the Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) after its first election in November 1932. Under the presidency of Francesc Maci√† (1931-1933) and his successor Llu√≠s Companys (1933-1940), both members of ERC, the Generalitat tried to implement an advanced social program, despite the internal difficulties. This period was marked by political unrest, the effects of the economic crisis and its social repercussions. As for the workers' movement, the anarchist trade union CNT (the greatest in Catalonia at the time) had been active throughout the period, realizing demonstrations, general strikes and some proclamations of the libertarian communism, while the marxist parties were progressively unified with the formation of the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (, POUM) in September 1935 and the pro-soviet Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (Catalan: Partit Socialista Unificat de Catalunya, PSUC) in July 1936.History psuc.cat The defeat of the military rebellion against the Republican government in Barcelona placed Catalonia firmly in the Republican side of the Spanish Civil War. During the war, there were two rival powers in Catalonia: the de jure power of the Generalitat and the de facto power of the armed popular militias. Violent confrontations between the workers' parties (CNT-FAI and POUM against the PSUC) culminated in the defeat of the first ones in 1937. The situation resolved itself progressively in favor of the Generalitat, but at the same time the Generalitat was partially losing its autonomous power within Republican Spain. In 1938 Nationalist troops broke the Republican territory in two, isolating Catalonia from the rest of the Republic. The defeat of the Republican army in the Battle of the Ebro led in 1938 and 1939 to the final defeat of the Catalonian Republican forces in the Catalonia Offensive, who abolished the Catalan autonomy and brought it into Spain proper. Exile After the fall of Barcelona, on 26 January 1939, Catalan and Spanish Republican governments marched to the north and, shortly after the fall of Girona, they crossed the French border; the President of Catalonia, Llu√≠s Companys made it on 5 February, alongside thousands of refugees who tried to escape from Nationalist advance. The Generalitat de Catalunya began the exile with many troubles, among them, the lack of economic resources and the disputes between sectors of Catalan nationalism. The Republican Left of Catalonia, the most relevant political party during the Republican era, lost many of its militants during the war and the Francoist repression, and its institutional structure almost disappeared. Due to this problems, Companys, established in Paris, was unable to constitute a Catalan government in exile. Also the Parliament couldn't meet, as a result, the presidency was the only effective representation of the Generalitat, so Companys decided create the National Council of Catalonia. It had to be a national representative body in exile, formed by five five cultural personalities, under the presidency of Pompeu Fabra.Consell Nacional de Catalunya enciclopedia.cat Axis presence in Catalonia Before the War of Spain, Catalonia attracted some interest of Italy and the Third Reich. After the establishment of Catalan self-government in 1931, the Italian consulate in Barcelona increased its activities in order to explore the possibility to create a fascist movement in Catalonia from Catalan nationalism, as the Fascist Italy saw the Spanish Republic a rival for its hegemony around the Mediterranean. However, the approach to Catalan nationalism was unsuccessful, while the Italian government showed more interest in to the Falange and the conspirational elements of the Spanish Army. The Italian bombers helped to the Nationalist faction in the Civil War bombing Barcelona and other Catalan places. Barcelona was the residence of a relevant German colony during the 1930s. During his visit in Spain, SS leader Heinrich Himmler visited Barcelona and the Monastery of Montserrat between 23 and 24 October 1940. It was received by General Orgaz (chief of the Spanish Army in Catalonia) and the other authorities of the city.Ferret, Joan Llu√≠s (2010). L'Aviaci√≥ i El Prat de Llobregat. p. 91.

The false information Pujol supplied to the Germans helped persuade them that the main attack would be in the Pas de Calais, so that they kept large forces there before the invasion. He was condecorated by Britain and Germany, as the Germans never realised they had been fooled, becoming the only known person to receive decorations from both sides during World War II. Resistance In 1944, while the liberation France from German occupation was a fact, the Communist Party of Spain promoted the Operaci√≥n Reconquista, consisting on the invasion of the Aran Valley, in northwestern Catalonia, as the first step of defeating the Spanish State. The Maquis took control of several villages of the valley until 27 October 1944 but were forced to retreat back into France after Franco sent reinforcements to defend Vielha, the Aranese capital.

However, the team began to suffer economic problems that led to put at risk the future of the franchise. This event caused the players and coaching staff to manage the travel expenses on their own and to report the abandonment by the team executives. So it was thought to take the franchise to another location. In February 2019 the team changed management, and was renamed as CF Real Potosino, however, the team kept the name FC Potosino in the Mexican Football Federation register, the team adopted gold and blue colors as part of the new identity and created soccer training schools to bring players to the team.. Also, it was announced that the franchise will try to change its name to San Luis C.F. The new owners of the club tried to create a sports project in the city of Saltillo under the name Club Furia Saltillo, however, they withdrew the offer because there were no sports conditions in that city. Subsequently, the project managers announced that they would seek another location, with the FC Potosino team finally being chosen. Since the arrival in San Luis Potos√≠, the team was relegated to a second plane due to the boom and subsequent promotion of Atl√©tico San Luis, which caused bad entries for the club, finally, in July 2019, the board reached an agreement to relocate the team to Salamanca, Guanajuato and rename it as Salamanca F.C., however, the new team maintained FC Potosino as its official name, because the agreement was given after the presentation of the participating teams of the season. Finally, the new team was rejected by the league due to breach of infrastructure requirements, so the FC Potosino franchise was put on hiatus during the 2019‚Äì2020 season.

Design and Construction In 1904 Clyde Steamship & Co. following an increase in their freight business placed an order for two steamers of approximately to serve on their East coast route between Boston and southern ports. Onondaga was the second of theses ships, and was laid down at the William Cramp & Sons' Kensington Yard in Philadelphia (yard number 331) and launched on 29 April 1905, with Miss Emily Cramp Taylor, daughter of Charles T. Taylor, secretary of Cramp Shipbuilding Company being the sponsor. The ship was of the three-deck type, and had all the modern machinery fitted for quick loading and unloading of the cargo, including a large number of derricks similar to her sister-ship . Following an inspection on May 31 and the successful completion of sea trials, the steamer was transferred to her owners and departed for New York on June 10. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a depth of . Onondaga was assessed at and and had deadweight of approximately 4,000. The vessel had a steel hull, and a single 131 nhp triple-expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller, and moved the ship at up to . Operational history Upon delivery Onondaga sailed from Philadelphia for New York on June 10, 1905. After loading, she departed on her maiden voyage on June 16, arriving at Charleston on June 19. The vessel then continued down to Jacksonville for loading, and left it on June 22 for her return trip. After stopping at Brunswick and Charleston to take on more cargo, she arrived at Boston on June 27, thus ending her maiden voyage. Onondaga continued serving the same route for the rest of her career, connecting Charleston, Brunswick and Jacksonville with Boston, with occasional stops at Georgetown. The steamer carried a variety of general cargo from the southern ports, mostly lumber, cotton, naval stores, vegetables and fruit. On October 27, 1906 she experienced problems with her propeller operation and had to be docked to fix the problem with her tail-shaft. After finishing the repairs the vessel departed for her normal trip on October 30. 1907 Grounding Onondaga left Boston on her usual trip at around 16:00 on January 12, bound for Charleston and continuing to Jacksonville. She was under command of captain Grant Bunnell and had a crew of 27 men and carried approximately 1,800 tons of cargo, consisting mostly of general merchandise, such as large quantity of boots and shoes, bales of hay, paper, about 30 carloads of potatoes and three racing automobiles destined for a car race in Florida. The ship passed the Highland Light in clear weather and continued south at a speed of about . Right about when the Nauset Light was expected to be seen the weather became thick, according to the captain, and no lights could be observed. The ship continued sailing on her course and the Chatham Light was expected to be seen, but due to poor visibility no lights were seen again, nor could they hear a whistling buoy off the Old Harbor bar. After consulting his log, captain Bunnell came to conclusion that he probably overtravelled on his current path, and ordered the vessel to turn in-shore for a short time to try to find the lights. He also ordered the crew to make sounding and it showed it was still deep enough to continue sailing. Onondaga beached on Orleans Beach, January 1907. After a while, at about 01:30 on January 13, as still no lights were seen or sounds heard, another sounding was made and the depth of only 7 fathoms was reported, and soon after breakers were spotted. The ship's engine was put in reverse but while it may have slowed her down, Onondaga bow rode straight on the sunken rip, getting stuck in the sand with her momentum swinging the vessel broadside and driving her further north. As the ship was in no immediate danger, the crew remained on board until the daylight. The life savers from the nearby stations rushed to the steamer's aid, as she came ashore, but their help was not needed at the time. Two tugs, Mercury and Orion, came from Boston next day, but they did not attempt to refloat the ship right away. On January 14, the US revenue cutter Gresham arrived and attempted for about an hour to drag Onondaga off Orleans Beach but failed. Two more tugs were sent, and over the next week several more attempts were made to dislodge the steamer but none of them came to fruition. Soon it became clear that the ship had to be lightened and some cargo was unloaded on the beach and later carted to Orleans to be taken to Boston. Many more attempts were made but whenever significant progress was made, the weather would turn stormy and would drive Onondaga further up the beach undoing any gains that were accomplished during the day. By the end of February, all of the steamer's cargo was discharged, some taken to Boston, and some sold at auction locally or simply given away. After two months of tries, Onondaga was finally floated on March 14 and proceeded to Boston towed by tug Underwriter and reached port in the evening of the same day. She was berthed to unload her remaining cargo of granite and machinery and put into drydock afterwards for examination which revealed that many bottom plates were damaged and had to be replaced in addition to her engines being full of sand. Onondaga was towed by Underwriter to William Cramp's yard in Philadelphia on March 22 where she stayed until late April undergoing repairs. Return to commercial service After finishing the repairs, Onondaga sailed to Charleston at the end of April and returned to Boston on May 8, 1907 with a large cargo of lumber, naval stores, rosin and fruit. On March 5, 1908 the steamer towed her sister-ship Chippewa back to Jacksonville after the ship lost her propeller and tail-shaft soon after leaving the port. She continued sailing on the route until May 1908, when she was put into drydock at New York for repairs, but following Chippewas grounding off Montauk Point in June 1908, she had to take over and return to her old route. On May 25, 1909 while on passage from Jacksonville to Boston, she encountered a dismasted and abandoned wreck of schooner Alaska about five miles southwest of Vineyard Sound lightship and took her in tow bringing the sailing ship to Vineyard Haven. She again came to the rescue in August of the same year when she towed another Clyde steamer Arapahoe from Charleston to New York when the latter vessel had her tail-shaft broken. On February 27, 1910 a fire started inside a Clyde Steamship shed containing various goods, chiefly cotton, on Lewis wharf in Boston. Onondaga was berthed by the southern side of the wharf and her woodwork on the starboard side caught fire soon after the blaze spread along the wharf. The crew reacted in time by cutting the lines, and the towboats came to her aid pushing her away from the blaze. The vessel suffered approximately $10,000 worth of damage during the incident and was sent to New York for repairs. Following the fire the steamer was chartered for two trips by the New York & Porto Rico Steamship Co. and brought 17,380 bags of sugar from Puerto-Rico to New Orleans on March 30, 1910 on her first voyage and a similar amount on her second trip to New York and Boston before resuming her regular service. She again was chartered to carry sugar from Puerto-Rico to New Orleans in April 1911. After leaving Charleston on August 27, 1911 bound south for Jacksonville Onondaga ran into a gale about three hours after the departure. The storm got progressively stronger with increasing wind and rougher seas as the ship sailed further south until the storm turned into a hurricane. The waves were sweeping over the ship's deck causing damage to her crew quarters such as blown out windows and broken doors, but overall the vessel held up. A few miles north of Savannah the steamer's steering gear gave in and snapped forcing the crew to drop anchors which fortunately could hold the vessel. It took approximately nine hours for the crew to patch up the rudder and the ship was able to slowly move out of the hurricane by the morning of August 29. Onondaga safely reached Boston in the evening of September 1. On February 9, 1912 while on her way out from Jacksonville Onondaga ran aground in the St. John's River but was soon refloated with the aid of tugs and suffered no apparent damage. In May 1912 the steamer was chartered to transport a large cargo of steel rails from Baltimore to Key West for the Florida East Coast Railroad being constructed at the time. The steamer then was put on the New York-Brunswick route where she remained for about a year. In October 1912 Onondaga made one trip to Wilmington to clear up backlog of cargo destined for that port. On May 7, 1913 Onondaga ran aground in the St. John's River, about 15 miles east of Jacksonville while on passage from the port to New York with a large general cargo but was soon floated with the help of several tugs and suffered no injuries. She ran ashore again on December 17, 1913 in the river after leaving port of Jacksonville and was floated on December 22 with the aid of several tugs after having to discharge about 500 tons of cargo and proceeded to Boston two days later. Onondaga had yet another encounter with a hurricane in September 1914 when she was again severely battered by the weather on her way from Jacksonville to Boston, when it took her 28 hours to cover 125 miles between the Frying Pan lightship and Diamond Shoal, off North Carolina coast. On August 11, 1915 small schooner Franconia of while on her voyage from Windsor to New York with a cargo of lumber ran into dense fog about 18:00 off Chatham. While she started to take in sail, Onondaga was spotted slowly moving through the fog, and apparently unaware of the schooner's presence. Soon after the steamer struck her on the starboard side making a 20-foot wide hole and nearly sinking the sailing vessel. No injuries were suffered by anybody on board the schooner and Onondaga stood by and then took the damaged vessel in tow bringing her to Boston. In September 1916 Onondaga temporarily took over another Clyde vessel's, Cherokee, route from New York to Wilmington and Brunswick while she was undergoing maintenance and repairs in dry dock in New York. The ship soon returned to her usual duties, but in January 1917 it was announced that Onondaga was being withdrawn from Boston service with new steamers taking over, however, two months later the vessel was back on her usual route. In August 1917 the steamer again ran aground while leaving port of Jacksonville and she had to be lightened before the tugs could successfully float her. In October 1917 following United States entry into World War I, Onondaga together with many other vessels over 2,500 tons capacity was requisitioned by the US Government. Onondaga would continue sailing on her usual route for the remainder of her career while under the government control. Sinking Onondaga left Boston in the afternoon of June 27, 1918 carrying a large cargo, consisting of large amounts of shoes, boots, leather, paper and mill products destined for Jacksonville via New York. She was under command of captain W. H. Googins and had a crew of 35 men. The ship ran into thick fog off Chatham in early morning of June 28 and captain Googins decided to anchor the ship and wait until the weather clears. The steamer remained idle from approximately 05:00 until noon on June 28 when it started clearing up and ship resumed her journey. By about 20:45 most of the crew retired to their quarters when suddenly a lookout spotted the breakers and gave a warning. Men poured out to the deck as the ship hit the rocks of Catomb Reef, about half a mile off Watch Hill Light injuring her bottom. The crew immediately took to the lifeboats as Onondaga started quickly to take on water. One lifeboat carrying the captain was smashed to pieces, injuring him in the process, but he was pulled out of the water by the crew. Everyone on board safely made to the shore where they were met by the local life-savers, while Onondaga quickly sank in approximately 30 feet of water bow first and listing to starboard. By the time the crew left Watch Hill next day, the steamer rolled over and only the tips of her masts could be observed sticking above the water. The work on refloating the steamer started right away after examination by the divers, and continued on for several days. It was first decided to lighten up the ship and unload as much cargo as possible, with the first lighter arriving in New London on July 6. Three attempts were made to refloat the vessel, however, they all proved unsuccessful as the shifting tides moved the vessel considerably weakening her hull, and the salvage work was stopped on July 10. The ship was completely abandoned at the end of July and the wreck later was dynamited to clear the passage as it presented a danger to navigation.

He is a tenure-track professor of Global Ecosystem Ecology at ETH Z√ºrich where he formed the Crowther Lab. His work aims to generate a holistic understanding of the global scale ecological systems which regulate the Earth's climate.  Research career  After his PhD, Crowther received a postdoctoral fellowship from the Climate and Energy Institute at Yale University. In 2015, Crowther was awarded a Marie Curie fellowship to research the impact of carbon cycle feedbacks on climate change at the Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO). In 2017, Crowther started a tenure track professorship at ETH Z√ºrich. His ongoing research is supported through a unique partnership with DOB Ecology, a private foundation supporting projects which protect and restore threatened ecosystems across the globe.  Three Trillion Trees  During his post-doctoral research, Crowther was recognized for mapping the distribution and diversity of trees across the world for the first time. This research estimated that there are approximately 3.04 trillion trees on Earth, 46% fewer than at the onset of agriculture about 12,000 years ago. Previous estimates had suggested there may have been only be 400 billion trees on Earth. Crowther was inspired to conduct his tree study by Plant-for- the-Planet, the youth-led NGO leading the UN's Billion Tree Campaign. According to a textbook to be distributed at global Plant-for-the-Planet Academies, \\"Tom was teased over the years by his fellow Professors for being the 'tree counter'. But Tom stuck with it and on 2 September 2015, his findings were published in the Journal Nature, the most prestigious paper in his field\\". With the knowledge that there were now three trillion trees on Earth, Plant-for-the-Planet increased their restoration targets and transformed the Billion Tree Campaign into the Trillion Tree Campaign. Crowther is now the lead science advisor to Plant-for-the-Planet. As part of his tree study Crowther was able to compile one of the largest inventories of tree data ever recorded. In 2016 he co-founded the Global Forest Biodiversity Initiative (GFBI) ‚Äì a foundation which manages the world's largest tree-level forest inventory database with 1.2 million plots from more than 70 countries.  Climate Change Ecology  Whilst at NIOO Crowther's research found that a 1 ¬∞C increase in temperatures could release an additional 55 billion tonnes of soil carbon (200 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide), not previously accounted for by scientists, into the atmosphere by 2050. Further, his research suggested that warming generally stimulates decomposition more than photosynthesis. Increased activity of microbes and soil animals, such as worms, would be the source of the additional carbon emissions, which could accelerate global warming by 17%. Prof Ivan Janssens, seen as one of the godfathers in the global change ecology field commented \\"the research had provided essential data to climate change models\\". The study's data was since incorporated into ongoing work by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In a more recent scientific review of research on soil carbon feedback, Crowther's work was highly cited as the \\"new finding of a statistical dependence of decomposition on the initial carbon content of the soil may prove to be a useful benchmark for [Earth System Model] simulations\\". Whilst Crowther acknowledges humanity has passed the \\"point of no return\\" in reversing the effects of climate change, he does believe action to dampen these effects is possible. He was outspoken about Donald Trump's decision to remove the United States from the Paris Agreement, calling it \\"catastrophic for humanity\\". Crowther also criticised the Trump administration for lifting the moratorium on the coal industry, noting that \\"renewable energies employ more people\\" and calling the decision \\"ridiculously short term and short sighted\\". In July 2016, Crowther provided an expert declaration on the carbon cycle, and the sequestration potential of forests and soil for the Western Environmental Law Center to support the proposed Clean Air Rule to limit greenhouse gases in Washington. He went on to give a keynote address at the FAO's 2017 Global symposium on soil organic carbon alongside Nobel Prize winner Dr. Rattan Lal. In May 2019 Crowther co-authored research on global mycorrhizal fungal networks, revealing that 60% of trees are connected by ectomycorrhizal fungi (EM) but, as temperatures rise, these fungi - and their associated tree species - will decline and be replaced by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM). Whilst EM fungi support huge carbon stores, the transition to AM fungi could increase the release of carbon into the atmosphere. The research estimated that if there isn't a reduction in carbon emissions by 2100, there could be a 10% reduction in EM - and the trees that depend on them.  Geospatial Mapping  Crowther's ongoing research employs location intelligence and mapping technologies to convey the status of Earth's terrestrial ecosystems. Through the latest machine learning approaches they generate predictive models for a detailed understanding of the biosphere's spatial and temporal patterns. In October 2018 he delivered a keynote address at the 2018 conference for the Association for Forest Spatial Analysis Technologies (ForestSAT), hosted by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland. In February 2019, at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Crowther announced that scientists had established there was room for an additional 1.2 trillion trees, noting that such a scale of reforestation could be one of the most powerful tools in the fight against climate change.  One Trillion Trees  In July 2019 the Crowther Lab published a major paper on 'The Global Tree Restoration Potential'. They identified a global area of 0.9 billion hectares (outside of agricultural and urban areas) available for tree restoration. Studying nearly 80,000 high resolution satellite photographs they analysed tree cover in protected areas largely unaffected by human activity across Earth's ecosystems, from arctic tundra to equatorial rainforest. They used machine learning to identify correlations with key soil and climactic variables in Google Earth Engine to predict the natural level of tree cover which could potentially exist in each ecosystem. In January 2020 the Crowther Lab was appointed as scientific advisor to the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, a global initiative highlighting the need for greatly increased global cooperation to restore degraded and destroyed ecosystems, contributing to efforts to combat climate change and safeguard biodiversity, food security, and water supply. On 22 January the World Economic Forum, in partnership with Marc and Lynne Benioff, announced the launch of 1T.org. With the support of Jane Goodall, Inger Andersen, Thomas Crowther and others, it was announced that the platform aimed to facilitate the conservation and restoration of one trillion trees within the decade. Like any grand-scale venture, Crowther cautions that there are inherent risks to consider in order to realize a positive impact for biodiversity, human well-being, and climate change. In a letter to The Guardian he identified some basic principles that any organisation peddling to the trillion tree campaign should uphold : # Cutting fossil fuel emissions is the priority for climate action. There is not enough room on Earth to offset all of our carbon emissions with trees. In combination with decarbonising, ecosystem restoration can be valuable for drawing down some of the excess atmospheric carbon. # Global restoration must be ecologically responsible. Restore the right diversity of native tree species where they naturally exist. Planting trees in unsuitable ecosystems could result in unintended adverse consequences. Natural forests, grasslands, shrublands and wetlands serve as vital repositories of carbon and biodiversity to be preserved and restored. Monoculture plantations of exotic species will not likely yield the desired benefits. # Global restoration must be socially responsible. It is crucial to uphold the rights of indigenous people and local communities, building on fair and sustainable economic models, and avoiding competition with food production. Only when local communities benefit from the economic and ecological benefits that new ecosystems provide can restoration be sustainable. # Conserve existing ecosystems. We are losing old forests at an alarming rate. Conserving and sustainably managing ecosystems we already have must be at the core of a global restoration movement  References and selected publications  External links Crowtherlab Category:Living people Category:1986 births Category:British ecologists Category:Forestry academics ","title":"Thomas Crowther (ecologist)"},{"id":"58840421","text":"The 1988 LEP Matchroom Professional Championship was the third and final edition of the professional invitational snooker tournament which took place in October 1988 in Southend-on-Sea, England.

Queer ecology disrupts heterosexist notions of nature, drawing from a diverse array of disciplines, including science studies, ecofeminism, environmental justice, and queer geography. This perspective breaks apart various \\"dualisms\\" that exist within human understanding of nature and culture. Overview Queer ecology recognizes that people often regard nature in terms of dualistic notions like ‚Äúnatural and unnatural,‚Äù ‚Äúalive or not alive‚Äù or ‚Äúhuman or not human,‚Äù when in reality, nature exists in a continuous state. The idea of ‚Äúnatural‚Äù arises from human perspectives on nature, not ‚Äúnature‚Äù itself. Queer ecology rejects ideas of human exceptionalism and anthropocentrism that propose that humans are unique and more important than other non-human nature. Specifically, queer ecology challenges traditional ideas regarding which organisms, species, and individuals have value. Queer ecology also identifies that heteronormative ideas saturate human understanding of ‚Äúnature‚Äù and human society, and calls for the inclusion of queerness in environmental movements. It rejects the associations that exist between ‚Äúnatural‚Äù and ‚Äúheterosexual,‚Äù and draws attention to how both nature and marginalized social groups have been historically exploited. People apply queer ecology by letting go of ideas of what is ‚Äúnatural,‚Äù getting rid of generalizations of human and animal behavior, acknowledging the diversity of the natural world, and facilitating discourse centered around queerness. Through the lens of queer ecology, all living things are considered to be connected and interrelated. = Definition = \\"The term ‚Äúqueer ecology‚Äù refers to a loose, interdisciplinary constellation of practices that aim, in different ways, to disrupt prevailing heterosexist discursive and institutional articulations of sexuality and nature, and also to reimagine evolutionary processes, ecological interactions, and environmental politics in light of queer theory. Drawing from traditions as diverse as evolutionary biology, LGBTTIQQ2SA (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, transsexual, intersex, queer, questioning, two-spirited, and allies) movements, and queer geography and history, feminist science studies, ecofeminism, and environmental justice, queer ecology currently highlights the complexity of contemporary biopolitics, draws important connections between the material and cultural dimensions of environmental issues, and insists on an articulatory practice in which sex and nature are understood in light of multiple trajectories of power and matter\\"  History  The theoretical beginnings of queer ecology are commonly traced back to what are considered foundational texts of queer theory. For example, scholar Catriona Sandilands cites queer ecology's origins back to Michel Foucault's The History of Sexuality (1976). Sandilands suggests Foucault \\"lays the groundwork for much contemporary queer ecological scholarship\\" by examining the conception of sex as \\"a specific object of scientific knowledge, organized through, on the one hand, a 'biology of reproduction' that considered human sexual behavior in relation to the physiologies of plant and animal reproduction, and on the other, a 'medicine of sex' that conceived of human sexuality in terms of desire and identity.\\" Foucault explains the \\"medicine of sex\\" as a way of talking about human health separate from the \\"medicine of the body\\". Early notions of queer ecology also come from the poetry of Edward Carpenter, who addressed themes of sexuality and nature in his work. Judith Butler's work regarding gender also laid an important foundation for queer ecology. Specifically, Butler explores gender as a performance in her 1990 book, \\"Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity\\". Queer ecology proposes that when Butler's notion of performance is applied to the realm of ecology, it dismantles the 'nature-culture binary. From the perspective of queer ecology, essential differences do not exist between \\"nature\\" and \\"culture\\". Rather, humans who have categorized \\"nature\\" and \\"culture\\" as distinct from one another perform these differences. From a scientific perspective, \\"nature\\" cannot be fully understood if animals or particles are considered to be distinct, stagnant entities; rather, nature exists as a \\"web\\" of interactions. In part, queer ecology also emerged from ecofeminist work. Although queer ecology rejects traits of essentialism found in early ecofeminism, ecofeminist texts such as Mary Daly's Gyn/Ecology (1978) laid the foundation for understanding intersections between women and the environment. Queer ecology develops these intersectional understandings that began in the field of ecofeminism about the ways sex and nature have been historically been depicted. As a political theory that insists ecological and social problems are enmeshed, queer ecology has been compared to Murray Bookchin's concept of social ecology since both are political theories that insist that ecological and social problems are enmeshed. In May 1994, an editorial essay in UnderCurrents: Journal of Critical Environmental Studies entitled \\"Queer Nature\\" introduced the notion of queer ecology. The piece identified the disruptive power possible when one examines normative categories associated with nature. The piece asserted that white heterosexual males hold power over the politics of nature, and this pattern cannot continue. Queer ecologist thinking and literature was also showcased in this issue in the form of poetry and art submissions‚Äîdeconstructing heteronormativity within both human and environmental sexualities. Later in 2015, Undercurrents proceeded to release an update to their original issue and a podcast to celebrate 20 years of continued studies in queer ecology. Recently, movies like James Cameron‚Äôs Avatar have started to popularize ideas central to queer ecology.  Heterosexism and the environment  Queer ecology recognizes that people often associate heterosexuality with the idea of ‚Äúnatural,‚Äù in contrast to, for example, homosexuality, which people associate with ‚Äúunnatural.‚Äù These expectations of sexuality and nature often influence scientific studies of non-human wildlife. The natural world often defies the heteronormative notions held by scientists, helping humans to redefine our cultural understanding of what is ‚Äúnatural‚Äù and also how we ‚Äúqueer‚Äù environmental spaces. For example, in ‚ÄúThe Feminist Plant: Changing Relations with the Water Lily‚Äù, Prudence Gibson and Monica Gagliano explain how the water lily defies heterosexist notions. They argue that because the water lily is so much more than its reputation as a ‚Äúpure‚Äù or ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù plant, we need to reevaluate our understandings of plants and acknowledge the connection between plant biology and models for cultural practice through a feminist lens.  Reimagining scientific perspectives  In disciplines of the natural sciences like evolutionary biology and ecology, queer ecology allows scholars to reimagine cultural binaries that exist between ‚Äúnatural and unnatural‚Äù and ‚Äúliving and non-living.‚Äù Timothy Morton proposes that biology and ecology deconstruct notions of authenticity. Specifically, he proposes that life exists as a ‚Äúmesh of interrelations‚Äù that blurs traditional scientific boundaries, like species, living and nonliving, human and nonhuman, and even between an organism and its environment. Queer ecology, according to Morton, emphasizes a perspective on life that transcends dualisms and distinctive boundaries, instead recognizing that unique relationships exist between life forms at different scales. Queer ecology nuances traditional evolutionary perspectives on sexuality, regarding heterosexuality as impractical at many scales and as a ‚Äúlate‚Äù evolutionary development. Other scholars challenge the contrast that exists between ‚Äúhuman‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-human‚Äù classifications, proposing that the idea of ‚Äúfluidity‚Äù from queer theory should also extend to the relationship between humans and the environment. Darwin's theory of sexual selection has received criticism when cross-examined with new data. Darwin‚Äôs idea that males compete for females in bird species has been disproven by data showing rare surplus of males causes aggressive male competition for females. Homophobic religious groups justify their anti-LGBTQ+ bias using Darwinian theories that homosexuality will lead to human extinction. Roughgarden argues that Darwin‚Äôs theory of sexual selection is false, claiming that ‚Äúdiversity reveals the evolutionary stability and biological importance of expressions of gender and sexuality that go far beyond the traditional male/female binary.‚Äù  Queer ecology and human society  Queer ecology is also relevant when considering human geography. For example, Catriona Sandilands considers lesbian separatist communities in Oregon as a specific manifestation of queer ecology. Marginalized communities, according to Sandilands, create new cultures of nature against dominant ecological relations. Environmental issues are closely linked to social relations that include sexuality, and so a strong alliance exists between queer politics and environmental politics. ‚ÄúQueer geography‚Äù calls attention to the spatial organization of sexuality, which implicates issues of access to natural spaces, and the sexualization of these spaces. This implies that unique ecological relationships arise from these sexuality- based experiences. Furthermore, queer ecology disrupts the association of nature with sexuality. Matthew Gandy proposes that urban parks, for example, are heteronormative because they reflect hierarchies of property and ownership. ‚ÄúQueer,‚Äù in the case of urban nature, refers to spatial difference and marginalization, beyond sexuality. Queer ecology is also important within individual households. As a space influenced by society, the home is often an ecology that perpetuates heteronormativity. Will McKeithen examines queer ecology in the home by considering the implications of the label ‚Äúcrazy cat lady.‚Äù Because the ‚Äúcrazy cat lady‚Äù often defies societal heterosexist expectations for the home, as she, instead of having a romantic, male, human partner, treats animals as legitimate companions. This rejection of heteropatriarchal norms and acceptance of multispecies intimacy makes the home into a queer ecology. Queer ecology also works its way into feminist economics, which are centered at childcare and reproduction.Bauhardt, Christine. Ed. Stacy Alaimo . Macmillan Interdisciplinary Handbooks, Farmington Hills, MI: Macmillan Reference USA, 2017. Anti-capitalist feminists use queer ecology to disentangle the gender binary, including the ties between the female body‚Äôs reproductive potential and the responsibility of social reproduction and childcare. Arts and literature Some have begun to apply the notion of queer ecology to their work in visual art, theater, and literature. Theater is an important setting to explore ideas of queer ecology because theater provides an environment to consider a world independent of the constructed binaries and heteronormativity in the outside world.Carina Bartleet . Ed. Iris van der Tuin . Macmillan Interdisciplinary HandbooksFarmington Hills, MI: Macmillan Reference USA, 2016. Thus, theater can construct temporary ‚Äúqueer ecologies‚Äù on the stage. Theater can portray a hypothetical society of radical coexistence by blurring the lines by challenging social binaries, ‚Äúnatural‚Äù hierarchies, and challenging the notion that the earth is a nonliving entity. Recently, visual artists have also alluded to the ideas central to queer ecology. For example, the 1997 multimedia project Lesbian National Parks and Services, developed by the Canadian performance art duo of Shawna Dempsey and Lorri Millan, queers the idea of national parks and ‚Äú[challenges‚Äô the general public‚Äôs ideas of tourism, recreation, and the ‚Äònatural‚Äô environment.\\" Additionally, the artist collective The Institute of Queer Ecology seeks to ‚Äúnurture a new environmental paradigm based on the concepts of interconnectivity and inseparability.‚Äù They have participated in group shows, curated exhibitions, and edited ‚ÄúThe Queer Issue‚Äù of the zine ECOCORE. Fundamental notions of queer ecology are present in the writing of Henry David Thoreau, Herman Melville, Willa Cather, and Djuna Barnes. These writers complicate the common belief that environmental literature consists exclusively of heterosexual doctrine and each of their work sheds light on the ways that human sexuality is connected to environmental politics. Robert Azzarello, in addition, has identified common themes of queerness and environmental studies in American Romantic and post-Romantic literature that challenge conventional ideas of what is ‚Äúnatural.‚Äù  See also  *Queer theory *Ecofeminism *Ecocriticism *Social ecology *Environmental humanities *Catriona Sandilands *Greta Gaard  References   External links  *Queer Ecology by Catriona Sandilands in Keywords for Environmental Studies *Institute of Queer Ecology Category:Queer theory Category:Environmentalism Category:Environmental movements Category:Environmental humanities Category:Environmental studies Category:Environmental social science concepts ","title":"Queer ecology"},{"id":"58840551","text":"Thomas (I) V√°s√°ri (also Rupolyi or Rupol√∫jv√°ri; ; died after 1381) was a Hungarian nobleman in the 14th century, who served as isp√°n of Somogy County in 1371. Life Thomas V√°s√°ri was the builder of the castle of Kaposv√°r (today in negligible ruins) Thomas V√°s√°ri was born into a noble family, which possessed landholdings around their estate centre V√°s√°ri in Bihar County. His parents were Nicholas I, the Vice-voivode of Transylvania from 1319 to 1320, and an unidentified sister of Archbishop Csan√°d Telegdi. One of his brothers was Nicholas II, an influential prelate and diplomat in the Hungarian royal court.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (V√°s√°ri 1. Rupol√∫jv√°ri) Thomas is first mentioned by contemporary records in 1344, when his elder brother Nicholas, who resided in the papal court then, asked Pope Clement VI to permit him and his brothers, John, Thomas and Beke, to pilgrimage to the Holy Land with the accompaniment of each 10 persons. V√°s√°ri also requested the pope to grant the right of indulgence to the parish church in their residence V√°s√°ri, dedicated to Martin of Tours. Nicholas applied for a similar request five years later, in March 1349, when asked the pope to authorize the confessor of his brothers, John and Thomas, to provide full forgiveness them on their death bed in the future. V√°s√°ri was a courtly knight at least since 1344. He participated in the Hungarian‚ÄìVenetian Wars. In summer 1356, Louis I of Hungary invaded Venetian territories without a formal declaration of war. He laid siege to Treviso on 27 July. Louis returned to Buda in the autumn, and commissioned V√°s√°ri to continue the siege. His troops defeated the Venetian army in the nearby battlefield, but they did not manage to occupy the castle itself. Because of his failure, Thomas V√°s√°ri was replaced as leader of the Hungarian army by Benedict Himfi, who also defeated several armies in the region, but the fortified cities, Treviso and Castelfranco remained in the hands of the Venetians. V√°s√°ri was able to retake his position by the end of the year. Simultaneously, Louis I won the war in Dalmatia. After the ratification of the Treaty of Zadar in February 1358, Thomas V√°s√°ri returned to Hungary. Following the extinction of the Fels≈ëlendvai family in 1358, he was granted the castle of Rupoly (or Ropoly) and its surrounding lands (today part of Kaposv√°r) by Louis I. The castle laid in one of the islands of the swampland along the Kapos river. Thereafter V√°s√°ri became a prominent landowner in Somogy County. There Thomas V√°s√°ri and his sons built a new castle, which was first mentioned by contemporary sources in 1387. Thereafter the family was called with the surname Rupol√∫jv√°ri (lit. \\"Rupol's New Castle\\"). His sons, Stephen and John were involved in the 1403 noble uprising against King Sigismund, who confiscated their castle and lands and divided its accessories and handed over to Martin Szerdahelyi and John Tam√°si. Thomas V√°s√°ri also had an unidentified daughter, who married Francis Bebek, Ban of Macs√≥. Some documents refer to Thomas V√°s√°ri as Ban of Croatia in 1367, but contemporary lists of grand officiers state, K√≥nya Sz√©cs√©nyi held the dignity during that time. It is presumable, V√°s√°ri was a familiaris of Sz√©cs√©nyi and acted as judge and arbitrator on his behalf, who died soon in that year. V√°s√°ri served as isp√°n of Somogy County in 1371.

During his time in Barcelona, between 1914 and 1921, he was jailed and exiled multiple times. He became a member of the Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) labor union in 1914, and joined its national committee four years later. Buenacasa organized the CNT's December 1919 congress in Madrid. He advocated for a Third International, though he would later regret this. In 1921, he returned to Zaragoza to edit Cultura y Acci√≥n. The next year, he became secretary of the region's CNT. From 1923 to 1930, the years of the Miguel Primo de Rivera dictatorship, Buenacasa went into exile multiple times. He came to edit the Catalonian anarchist newspaper El Productor in 1925. Buenacasa joined in the founding of the militant Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (FAI) in July 2017 and moderated between the CNT and FAI in the coming years, having been a major contributor to the growth of both. He chronicled this time in the 1933 book, La CNT, los Treinta y la FAI. He had earlier written the 1928 history, El Movimiento Obrero Espa√±ol (1886-1926). Historia y Cr√≠tica, or The Spanish Workers Movement (1886‚Äì1926): History and Criticism, which was later reissued in Paris in 1966. Buenacasa's writings are among the foremost sources on internal CNT and FAI operations. He led a school during the Spanish Civil War and afterwards, he was held in a French concentration camp. Buenacasa worked to reorganize the CNT in exile. He died in Bourg-l√®s-Valence, France, on November 6, 1964. Though he remained a lifelong militant anarchist, Buenacasa opposed the terrorist actions in the name of anarchism.  Personal life  Buenacasa was married in 1910 and had one son.

It was built by Donohoe and Vaughan. It is also known as Crown Street Reservoir & Site and WS 0034. The property is owned by Sydney Water, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999.  History  The Crown Street Reservoir (WS 34) was completed in 1859. Waterproof bricks, imported from England, were used in its construction. It was a part of the Botany Swamps Scheme, 1858-1886. Water was pumped from Botany Pumping Station to Crown Street Reservoir, and later to Paddington Reservoir (1864). It is now possibly the oldest working reservoir in Australia. The Botany Swamps gave way to the Upper Nepean Scheme in 1888, with temporary supply provided by the Hudson Scheme between 1886 and 1888. Today the Crown Street Reservoir receives water from the Upper Nepean Scheme and also Warragamba Dam. It is an important and integral part reticulation system.  Description  The Crown Street Reservoir (WS 34) is a rectangular covered reservoir. The reservoir is built with brick perimeter walls, partly excavated into bedrock and partly raised and supported by an earth embankment. Special impervious bricks, 300,000 in all, were imported from England for the purpose. On the Riley Street frontage of the reservoir is a modern brick valve house or entrance chamber, with concrete roof and footings. The construction of the reservoir reflects the ingenuity of the designers and craftsmen of the time. It has required little maintenance and repair over the years. Its original cost was A¬£14,929. Crown Street Reservoir provided the suction water for Crown Street Pumping Station (WPS 1) which has supplied the following reservoir at various times: Paddington Reservoir, 1864, now disused; Woollahra Reservoir, 1880; Centennial Park Reservoir No. 1, 1899; Centennial Park Reservoir No. 2, 1925; Waverley Reservoir No. 1, 1887; Waverley reservoir No. 2, 1917; and Waverley Reservoir No. 3, 1938. The land adjacent to the reservoir provides space for a number of buildings, including WPS 1, former workshop buildings, and two other modern buildings. The whole site is surrounded by a substantial and early sandstone, brick and wrought iron palisade fence. The workshop building is a two-storey polychrome (red and white) brick structure, on the Reservoir Street frontage. Its original roof has been replaced by a skillion corrugated iron roof, and many other alterations are evident. The workshop building is now disused and unoccupied.  Modifications and dates  It has received regular maintenance and repair over the years.  Heritage listing  As at 5 August 2009, Crown Street Reservoir (WS 34) is the oldest reservoir in NSW, still in service. It has had a pivotal role, not only in the Botany Swamps Scheme, 1858-1886, but also in the Hudson / Upper Nepean Scheme, 1886 / 1888 onwards, and now receives water from Warragamba Dam. It continues to supply water to the Inner City, a role it has played since 1859.The construction of the reservoir exemplifies the skill and ingenuity of the designers and craftsmen of the time, and as a result Crown Street Reservoir (WS 34) possesses historical and aesthetic significance at least at a state level. All covered reservoirs are highly significant within the SWC system, since all differ in construction technology, design and architectural detailing. All therefore contribute to our understanding of the development of covered reservoirs in NSW. Crown Street Reservoir was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Crown Street Reservoir (WS 34) is the oldest working reservoir in NSW, still in service. It has had a pivotal role, not only in the Botany Swamps Scheme, 1858-1886, but also in the Hudson / Upper Nepean Scheme, 1886 / 1888 onwards, and now receives water from Warragamba Dam. It continues to supply water to the Inner City, a role it has played since 1859, a total of 141 years to date. This reservoir is associated with a water supply source, prior to the completion of the Upper Nepean Scheme and the formation of the Metropolitan Water Sewerage & Drainage Board in 1888. It operated in parallel with Busby's Bore from 1859 to 1888. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Reservoir structure features high aesthetic qualities, demonstrative of construction techniques and high level technical expertise available for covered reservoir construction in Australia in the 1850s, including cast-iron beams imported from England. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Crown Street Reservoir is an early example of a mid-nineteenth century fire-proof jack-arch roof construction in NSW. It is the only reservoir in the SWC system featuring wooden columns. The reservoir was built in special impervious bricks imported from England, which is an unusual feature. The Crown Street Reservoir site possibly contains remnant sections of the 30-inch Botany Swamps rising main, manufactured in Scotland in the 1850s. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. One of small group of covered reservoirs, each demonstrating differences in construction, design & architectural detailing. Earliest reservoir, still in use. 1 of 4 associated with Botany Swamps Supply. Only reservoir with wooden columns in SWC system. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Crown Street Reservoir is representative of the oldest class of fully built water reservoirs in NSW and Australia, identifiable by their brick structure and brick arched roof. It is the oldest, the longest serving and probably the most important of this group. The Crown Street Reservoir site contains a 1965 water pumping station representative of design and equipment of other major water pumping stations on Sydney in the 1960s.  Engineering heritage  The reservoir received an Engineering Heritage National Marker from Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.

Anne sent a message to Marie that she would have her son delivered to her to travel with her to England. Anne arrived at Stirling Castle, and sat down to dinner with Marie and her stepson, the Master of Mar. She fainted into the arms of Marie and Agnes Douglas, Countess of Argyll, and when Jean Drummond and Marion Boyd, Mistress of Paisley, carried her to bed she had a miscarriage. The lawyer Thomas Haddington gave an eyewitness account of these events, and said the queen had told her physician Martin Sch√∂ner that she had taken \\"some balm water that hastened her abort\\".William Fraser, [Memorials of the Earls of Haddington, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1889), pp. 209-11: James Maidment, Letters and State Papers during the Reign of James the Sixth (Edinburgh, 1838), pp. 54-5. Some biographers of Anne of Denmark assert that the \\"Lady Mar\\" of this incident was the dowager countess, Annabell Murray.Ethel Williams, Anne of Denmark (London, 1970), p. 70. Anne of Denmark left Stirling Castle with Henry on 28 May, accompanied by English ladies, according to Robert Birrell, the author of a memoir. This suggests that Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford and Frances Howard, Countess of Kildare, who are known to have travelled to Scotland to seek the queen's favour and employment in her court, were at Stirling at this time.'The Diarey (sic) of Robert Birrell', in John Graham Dalyell, Fragments of Scottish History (Edinburgh, 1798), pp. 59-60 Marie Stewart remained a friend of another lady in waiting Elizabeth Schaw, and her husband John Murray, later Earl of Annandale, who were courtiers in London. Schaw took long leave from the queen's household in August 1613 and came to Scotland and stayed with Marie at Alloa and Stirling .Melros Papers, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1837), pp. 126-8; Original Letters Relating to Ecclesiastical Affairs, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1851), p. 354, 459, 466; See also NLS Adv. MS 31.1.1 vol. 5 no. 110. On 16 June 1622 Marie wrote to John Murray with news of the death of the Chancellor, Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline, hoping that he could persuade the king to make the Earl of Mar keeper of Dunfermline Palace. In 1603 Seton had written to James excusing her, the earl's, and her stepson's conduct at Stirling in May 1603.James Maidment, Letters and State Papers during the Reign of James the Sixth (Edinburgh, 1838), pp. 53-4, 344-5. Elizabeth of Bohemia suggested that one of Marie's sons, Alexander of Henry, should marry one of her ladies in waiting, Mistress Margaret or Margery Croft (d. 1637), a daughter of the Catholic Sir Herbert Croft of Croft Castle and Mary Bourne heiress of Sir Anthony Bourne of Holt Castle.Nadine Akkerman, The Correspondence of Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia vol 1 (Oxford, 2015), pp. 568-70: Joseph Lemuel Chester, Westminster Abbey Registers: Harleian Society, vol. 10 (London, 1869), pp. 64, 132.

In a static sense, the fundamental difference between a liquid and a solid is that the solid has elastic resistance against a shearing stress while a liquid does not. Thus, a simple liquid will not typically support a transverse acoustic phonon, or shear wave. Gels have been described by Born as liquids in which an elastic resistance against shearing survives, yielding both viscous and elastic properties. It has been shown theoretically that in a certain low- frequency range, polymeric gels should propagate shear waves with relatively low damping. The distinction between a sol (solution) and a gel therefore appears to be understood in a manner analogous to the practical distinction between the elastic and plastic deformation ranges of a metal. The distinction lies in the ability to respond to an applied shear force via macroscopic viscous flow. In a dynamic sense, the response of a gel to an alternating force (oscillation or vibration) will depend upon the period or frequency of vibration. As indicated here, even most simple liquids will exhibit some elastic response at shear rates or frequencies exceeding 5 x 106 cycles per second. Experiments on such short time scales probe the fundamental motions of the primary particles (or particle clusters) which constitute the lattice structure or aggregate. The increasing resistance of certain liquids to flow at high stirring speeds is one manifestation of this phenomenon. The ability of a condensed body to respond to a mechanical force by viscous flow is thus strongly dependent on the time scale over which the load is applied, and thus the frequency and amplitude of the stress wave in oscillatory experiments.Philippoff, W. in Physical Acoustics, Ed. W. P. Mason, Vol. 28 (Academic Press, NY 1965).  Structural relaxation  The structural relaxation of a viscoelastic gel has been identified as primary mechanism responsible for densification and associated pore evolution in both colloidal and polymeric silica gels. Experiments in the viscoelastic properties of such skeletal networks on various time scales require a force varying with a period (or frequency) appropriate to the relaxation time of the phenomenon investigated, and inversely proportional to the distance over which such relaxation occurs. High frequencies associated with ultrasonic waves have been used extensively in the handling of polymer solutions, liquids and gels and the determination of their viscoelastic properties. Static measurements of the shear modulus have been made, as well as dynamic measurements of the speed of propagation of shear waves, which yields the dynamic modulus of rigidity. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques have been utilized in order to monitor the dynamics of density fluctuations through the behavior of the autocorrelation function near the point of gelation.  Phase transition  Tanaka et al., emphasize that the discrete and reversible volume transitions which occur in partially hydrolyzed acrylimide gels can be interpreted in terms of a phase transition of the system consisting of the charged polymer network, hydrogen (counter)ions and liquid matrix. The phase transition is a manifestation of competition among the three forces which contribute to the osmotic pressure in the gel: # The positive osmotic pressure of (+) hydrogen ions # The negative pressure due to polymer-polymer affinity # The rubber-like elasticity of the polymer network The balance of these forces varies with change in temperature or solvent properties. The total osmotic pressure acting on the system is the sum osmotic pressure of the gel. It is further shown that the phase transition can be induced by the application of an electric field across the gel. The volume change at the transition point is either discrete (as in a first-order Ehrenfest transition) or continuous (second order Ehrenfest analogy), depending on the degree of ionization of the gel and on the solvent composition.Tanaka, T., Sci. Amer., Vol. 244, p. 124 (1981).  Elastic continuum  The gel is thus interpreted as an elastic continuum, which deforms when subjected to externally applied shear forces, but is incompressible upon application of hydrostatic pressure. This combination of fluidity and rigidity is explained in terms of the gel structure: that of a liquid contained within a fibrous polymer network or matrix by the extremely large friction between the liquid and the fiber or polymer network. Thermal fluctuations may produce infinitesimal expansion or contraction within the network, and the evolution of such fluctuations will ultimately determine the molecular morphology and the degree of hydration of the body. Quasi-elastic light scattering offers direct experimental access to measurement of the wavelength and lifetimes of critical fluctuations, which are governed by the viscoelastic properties of the gel. It is reasonable to expect a relationship between the amplitude of such fluctuations and the elasticity of the network. Since the elasticity measures the resistance of the network to either elastic (reversible) or plastic (irreversible) deformation, the fluctuations should grow larger as the elasticity declines. The divergence of the scattered light intensity at a finite critical temperature implies that the elasticity approaches zero, or the compressibility becomes infinite, which is the typically observed behavior of a system at the point of instability. Thus, at the critical point, the polymer network offers no resistance at all to any form of deformation.  Ultimate microstructure  The rate of relaxation of density fluctuations will be rapid if the restoring force, which depends upon the network elasticity, is large‚Äîand if the friction between the network and the interstitial fluid is small. The theory suggests that the rate is directly proportional to the elasticity and inversely proportional to the frictional force. The friction in turn depends upon both the viscosity of the fluid and the average size of the pores contained within the polymer network. Thus, if the elasticity is inferred from the measurements of the scattering intensity, and the viscosity is determined independently (via mechanical methods such as ultrasonic attenuation) measurement of the relaxation rate yields information on the pore size distribution contained within the polymer network, e.g. large fluctuations in polymer density near the critical point yield large density differentials with a corresponding bimodal distribution of porosity. The difference in average size between the smaller pores (in the highly dense regions) and the larger pores (in regions of lower average density) will therefore depend upon the degree of phase separation which is allowed to occur before such fluctuations become thermally arrested or \\"frozen in\\" at or near the critical point of the transition.

It was built from 1891 to 1898. It is also known as Institute Building. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History   Early history of the locality  In the early years of the nineteenth century the area around what is now Prince Alfred Park and the infrastructure of Central railway station was undeveloped land known as the Government Paddocks. Amongst the early grants in this locality were those made to Charles Smith which consisted of straddling what is now Chalmers Street and was roughly bounded by the present day Cleveland and Elizabeth Streets, and the large grant made to William Redfern. Smith's grant was known as Cleveland Gardens, and by the early 1820s it was owned by the merchant Daniel Cooper. Cooper erected Cleveland House, which still stands, in 1824 to the design of architect Francis Greenway. It was not, however, the first building in the locality, for the Benevolent Asylum was erected in 1820-21 at the direction of Governor Macquarie at what would become the corner of Pitt and Devonshire Streets. The \\"turnpike house\\" was a short distance away. Development of a rather different nature was also initiated by Governor Macquarie when he ordered the consecration of the Devonshire Street Cemetery. This took place on 27 January 1820. A brick wall was erected before any interments took place to enclose its four acres. Within a four year period the cemetery was expanded by the addition of seven acres to its south. A road was formed along the southern boundary of the cemetery in the first half of the 1830s and was called Devonshire Street. The Government Paddocks, which were also known as the Cleveland Paddocks, were on the other side of the new street. Recommendations issued by Earl Grey, the Secretary for State, in regard to the establishment of railways in the colonies, were adopted by the Legislative Council of NSW on 18 August 1849. On 11 September 1848 the Sydney Tramroad and Railway Company was formed, with the object of constructing railways to Parramatta and Liverpool, and eventually extensions to Bathurst and Goulburn. As the new Act allowed for railways to be constructed by private companies, the Sydney Tramroad and Railway Company was incorporated as the Sydney Railway Company at the end of 1849. The site of the railway station at Sydney was located within the Cleveland Paddocks, granted on an application made to the government on 6 December 1849. At a spectacular ceremony held on a rain 3 July 1850 the daughter of Governor Charles Fitzroy, the Honourable Mrs Keith Stewart, turned the first sod in the Cleveland Paddocks. The grant application made in December 1849 was finally approved on 13 December 1853. However, the Sydney Railway Company ran into financial troubles and so was purchased by the government, and on 3 September 1855 its administration was vested to the government through a Board of Commissioners. In September 1856 the railway line between Sydney and Parramatta was officially opened. On 22 December 1865 the remaining eastern portion of the Cleveland Paddocks was dedicated as a reserve for public purposes and name Prince Alfred Park in commemoration of the visit by the Duke of Edinburgh to the Australian colonies in 1868.  Education of the working classes  The movement towards the formation of the Railway Institute began with the arrival in Sydney of fifty four Scottish mechanics, their families and four clergymen who were to respectively build and teach at the Reverend Dr Lang's Australian College. They landed in Sydney around 1832. One of the teachers, Reverend Henry Carmichael, acting at the instigation of Governor Bourke, did much to found the Sydney School of Arts in 1833. The School of Arts was intended to give mechanics a firm knowledge of the theory behind their craft, which extended to classes in arithmetic, geometry, algebra and \\"anything else that might make a working man able to become a freer and more privileged human being, as well as a more efficient worker\\". Knowledge was to be disseminated by volunteers such as professionals from the Church, legal, medical and teaching professions. Facilities included a library with a reading room and a type of scientific museum containing apparatus, models of machinery and of recent inventions. Premises were erected at 277A Pitt Street and extended over the years. The building still stands. By 1841 there were 800 members at the School of Arts but numbers declined as the decade passed. Its fortunes revived after the arrival of the Reverend Dr John Woolley in July 1852 to become the first Principal and Professor of Classics at the University of Sydney. He also became Vice President of the School of Arts and lectured at it, and was crucial in turning it into a useful teaching institution. From the middle of the century Schools of Arts and Mechanics Institutes were set up in towns across the state. There was one in Wollongong by 1861, whilst a School of Arts was opened in Dubbo in 1874, Bega in 1875 and Newcastle in the same year. By 1880 there were seventy six across New South Wales. They were run by ambitious and well meaning townspeople who were endeavouring to give the working man education and some culture. Classes tended to be small, however, and a common pattern was observed whereby the original founding zeal faded and attendances became sporadic. What were sources of pride in many towns became social centres rather than educational facilities or else survived as lending libraries. Nevertheless, it is indicative of the place that the institutions held in the community that Sir Henry Parkes urged the federation of the Australian colonies at a public meeting held at the Tenterfield School of Arts in October 1889, and by 1900 there were well over one thousand around the country. Evidently in the first half of the 1880s the NSW Railway Commissioners had made promises to provide an institution for railway employees, large numbers of whom were too far away to take advantage of the nearest Mechanics Institute or School of Arts. This echoes the precedent established in Great Britain in the nineteenth century, where the railway companies provided a Mechanics Institute for the improvement of their employees' education in the numerous towns which were associated with the railways or actually developed by them. The latter process started at the end of the 1830s and Mechanics Institutes were an integral and early component of the towns. For instances, in the town of Swindon it was, apart from the parish church, the most important building and the centre of its social and cultural life for almost a century after its establishment in 1844. The companies also built facilities such as hospitals, schools and parks. It appears that railway employees were aware of the benefits offered by the institutions for seven fettlers and a ganger stationed alongside the railway line to Tenterfield challenged the Commissioners to act on their promise at the beginning of 1885. An inaugural meeting of a provisional committee was held on 10 December 1888 and the objects and contents of the Railway Institute were set up. These were subsequently revised in March 1889:  The Railway Institute and its Building  Of course, new premises were required to house the new institute and so a competition was held at the end of 1889 with a promise of A¬£50. It was won by the architect H. M. Robinson of Pitt Street, Sydney. Although there is little documentary material readily available on Robinson, he was responsible for a variety of residential and other projects at the end of the 1880s and into the 1890s. In 1887 he designed premises for the P. P. Investment Co. at 379 George Street in association with architect J. Tosh, who had offices in the same building as Robinson. In addition to the Railway Institute, other projects included a villa in St Marles Road, Randwick (1887), the second placed entry in the NSW State House Competition (1888), extension s to St Jude's Church at Randwick (1888), alterations and additions to \\"Hillside\\" at Coogee (1889), a series of tramway waiting rooms at Hyde Park and Moore Park in Sydney (1890), an entry into the Hawkesbury Agricultural College Competition of 1891, and extensions to a pavilion at the National Park at Audley (1892). Robinson's building for the Railway Institute was: This was amongst the earliest instances of the Queen Anne Style as well as a very early instance of the use of terracotta roof tiles. These, imported from France, only became popular at the very end of the 1880s. Plans and elevations of the Railway Institute were inspected on 21 February 1890 by the committee at the instigation of its chairman, who also stated that there was a sum of A¬£4,000 set aside in addition to A¬£1,000 donated by Mr Goodchap. Charles Augustus Goodchap (1837-1896) arrived in Sydney in 1853 and joined the railway branch of the Department of Public Works in 1859. He became chief clerk for railways, the secretary in 1875 and commissioner of railways on 29 January 1878. The management of the railways improved under his jurisdiction, and some of the innovations that he instigated included interlocking points and signalling, the so-called \\"absolute block\\" system of signalling, and construction of large maintenance and repair workshops, and the training of employees in first aid for the Railway Ambulance Corps. His reputation was damaged by a feud with engineer-in-chief John Whitton and his administration hampered by political pressures. In the setting up of the Railway Act, 1888, a corporate body of three commissioners was set up to manage the railways and detach them from political interference. Goodchap resigned on 27 October of that year because he was not appointed one of the three commissioners. Railway workers collected a subscription for his retirement as a response to concerns for their welfare, which reflected his paternalistic administration - in 1882 he had initiated investigations into the educational and benefit schemes available to European railway workers and had established the Railway Ambulance Corps in 1885. The A¬£500 that he received from the railway workers was donated towards the setting up of a library which formed the nucleus of the Railway Institute. Tenders were invited in February 1890 for the erection of the building, and the contract was signed with builder Thomas Henley on 9 April 1890. Later that month a circular prepared at the recommendation of the committee noted that the Institute itself was to be \\"worked upon similar lines\\" to the Railwayman's Institute at Crewe in England, thus acknowledging its English precedents. As documented, the building comprised a large lecture hall with stage and platform on the first floor and a Class Room, Reading Room, Coffee Room and Smoking Room disposed along a central corridor. An entry porch and stair hall were at one (western) end of the building whilst a caretaker's bedroom, kitchen, scullery and escape stair were at the other (eastern) end. A tarpaulin shed on the site was demolished to make way for the new building, which ended up costing A¬£3,600, significantly less than the A¬£5,000 allowed for it. Progress was slower than anticipated, but in October 1890 it was decided to seek permission to install electric lighting as well as gas. The Commissioner did not approve the variation. In January 1891 some minor modifications were approved. Correspondence received by the Committee from the Commissioners allowed \\"...of tiling the Porch & erecting Ladies' w.c. and asphalting yard & also removing gates into Goods yard and extending dwarf wall and railway along the side of building.\\" On the evening of Saturday, 14 March 1891, the Railway Institute building was formally opened, \\"...when the interior presented a most attractive appearance, being profusely adorned with floral decorations and Chinese lanterns. The lecture hall was crowded with railway employees, every branch of the service being represented, and among the visitors on the platform were the Hon. Sir Henry Parkes, G.C.M.G., Colonial Secretary and Premier; the Hon. William McMillan (Australian politician) |W. McMillan , Colonial Treasurer and Minister for Railways; Mr E. M. G. Eddy, Chief Railway Commissioner... Mr C. A. Goodchap, M.L.A., ex- Commissioner for Railways...Professor Selman of the Sydney Technical College...the others, including many leading citizens who had taken an interest in the movement.\\" It was the first Railway Institute to be opened in Australia. That the Institute was a great and immediate success is borne out by alterations and additions made to it within ten years of its opening. A small Ladies Retiring Room was documented in July 1891 and constructed behind the stage in the first floor Lecture hall. Six years later, the Council of the Railway Institute approached the Commissioners at the beginning of 1897 \\"with a view to taking in a portion of Prince Alfred Park for the purpose of extending the building along Castlereagh Street\\". After deliberations with the Sydney City Council a small portion of the Park was obtained \\"for a consideration\\". Extensive two storey additions including a new entry at the corner of Castlereagh and Devonshire Street, a flat, smoking room, \\"general room\\" and an additional ladies retiring room, reading room and spacious lecture hall were documented by the Government Architects Office. This reflected the \\"great use made of the Institute\\", the large numbers of classes and lectures held and the problems in co-ordinating them. Indeed, \\"on several occasions accommodation was obtained outside, the whole of our large building being in use\\". The cost of these grand extensions exceeded available funding due to a decline in railway revenue. However, a revised scheme was prepared in the middle of 1898 and was complete by July. The documentation for the additions was prepared by the Railways Department, the architect being W. H. Davidson. They were constructed by messrs Adamson and Daw and officially opened on 14 March 1899. The additions contained two class rooms, a smoking room, council room, secretarial room and a large hall. The caretaker's quarters were enlarged and the older building \\"renovated and generally well- appointed\\". The smoking room must have satisfied a long felt need, as the original one had been taken over when the library had been enlarged earlier in the decade. In 1897 a Royal Commission was established to decide on a new railway terminal site. Alternative proposals were prepared and on 7 June 1900 a NSW Parliamentary Standing Committee adopted the proposal to locate it on the northern side of Devonshire Street. The City Railway Extensions (Devonshire Street) Act was proclaimed on 11 December 1900. The Devonshire Street Cemetery was removed to make way for the new terminal and relocation of monuments and remains was begun in 1901 and by June of that year work had begun on forming the site. Construction of the first stage of the station began in June 1902. Devonshire Street effectively disappeared between Castlereagh and George Streets with the construction of the Devonshire Street pedestrian subway beneath the station infrastructure between 1903 and 1906. Castlereagh Street was renamed Chalmers Street and connected to Elizabeth Street by a new section of roadway along the eastern side of the station. During 1905 the stage and scenery in the hall was remounted and lighting upgraded, and a gymnasium constructed within the area formed by the two buildings, on the southern part of the site. Drawings show that it was proposed to construct this in the ground floor of a rectangular three storey building, with classrooms on the two upper levels, but another drawing shows a simple structure with classrooms on the two upper levels, but another drawing shows a simple structure with a corrugated iron roof. Photographs published in 1909 show it to have subsequently demolished during the 1920s. In September 1905 a Jubilee Celebration Exhibition was staged within and adjacent to the Institute buildings, commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the NSW Government Railways. The building continued to suffer the strain of demands for accommodation, both social and educational and so the Council submitted a proposal for extensions to the Chief Commissioner at the end of 1908. It has not been ascertained what these may have entailed and whether they were built. During the next decade, however, alterations and additions were made to the building's fabric. The sitting room and bedroom of the caretaker's flat in the 1899 building were opened up into one space to form a classroom in 1916, and between 1917 and 1919 new works included the construction of a new stair at the western end of the 1891 building in the porch, necessitating the construction of another storey over it. A gallery was constructed above the main hall on the first floor, along with dressing rooms and an access balcony along the eastern and northern sides of the building. The proscenium on the stage of the main hall was also moved forward to the edge of the stage. In 1918 documentation was prepared converting the small hall in the 1899 building into a library with an associated office. Two years later a proposal for an orchestra pit in front of the stage in the main hall was also documented, and in 1924 masts for an aerial extending over the 1899 building were detailed. In the middle of the 1920s extensive works were undertaken in and around Central Station in association with the construction of the railway extensions into the city centre. The gymnasium was demolished, as were other nearby structures used by the Institute: Alterations in connection with the lines which will link up with the City Railway necessitated the demolition of old Sydney goods station. The original goods shed had been for some years the site of the departmental tarpaulin factory, and the offices were occupied by the teaching and examing [sic] sections of the Institute. As Institute business had quite outgrown the capacity of the main building, it was necessary to look for new premises in a convenient location, and Opera House Chambers, in Hay Street, have been obtained.....The whole of the classes previously conducted at the main Institute, Central Station, and Newtown Depot will now be accommodated on the first, second and third floors of the Opera House Buildings, the library is on the fourth floor, and on the fifth are the offices of the Director and his officers, including the staff examiners and the safe-working instruction room. It is not intended to do away with the old Institute building, which has served its purpose faithfully and well since 1893 [sic]. The hall will still be used for entertainments, and the various affiliated musical and other societies will continue to meet there. In addition, the rooms will be available for meetings of other Service organisations which, with much reluctance, it had been necessary for some time past to turn away owing to so many other calls on the limited space. The enormous growth of the Institution during the past six years made it imperative to provide increased accommodation. As the building could not be extended sufficiently to meet even present requirements, it was thought advisable to get into premises where as many activities as possible would be under on roof. The move occasioned by the growth of the Railway Institute reflected its expansion in other parts of the State. After the reorganisation following its revised Constitution of 1919, a large number of Institutes were set up or revitalised in country areas; and these were also open to the general public. The first branch of the Railway Institute had been established in Newcastle as early as 1895 but only gained its own building in 1917 and other subsequent branches were opened between 1916 and 1922 across the state. In fact, the Newcastle Institute was sufficiently well patronised to establish an orchestra in 1917 and a male choir in 1926. Premises set up by the Railway Institute included five bankrupt school of arts that were taken over. Even with new premises the Institute was still operating at its full capacity. In 1925 there were 759 pupils for technical subjects and 995 more for departmental and commercial courses. Nearly 3,000 employees were also enrolled in correspondences courses. In 1927 efforts were underway to reconstruct the Museum within the Main Institute building...and already a good collection of exhibits has been obtained. The cooperation of the staff generally in furtherance of the project is desired, and any exhibits in the form of correspondence, books, or other documents relative to the early days of the Railways, as well as models, appliances and apparatus of historical significance, will be gratefully accepted either as gifts for or exhibits on loan to the Museum. The NSW Railway and Tranway Institute Musical and Elocutionary competition was inaugurated in 1912 and became recast as an Eisteddfod in 1922. In 1933 the City of Sydney Eisteddfod was set up and also made use of the Institute's halls. Possibly as result of this the drop scene was relocated above the stage of the main hall in 1936. Since that time few alterations were documented for the building. In 1941 toilets were proposed for existing spaces across from the small hall, but do not appear to have been constructed. Clearly even accommodation away from the Institute building was inadequate, for by 1943 the Institute was also providing additional lecture rooms in the Wills Building in Sydney. In 1947 sketch plans were prepared for an entire new building to replace the existing premises, and this was serious enough to warrant the acquisition of a new site: Needless to say, the new building did not eventuate, although alterations to the entrance gates to the existing building were documented to assist in the transportation of transformers. Minor changes were carried out in the late 1950s and early 1960s, including the installation of a kitchen at the south western corner of the 1899 building and refurbishment of toilets plus alterations to the entry porch at the western end of the 1891 building. The last eisteddfod was held in the building in 1971. In 1975 the Railway Institute was relieved of its role as a training facility, and was returned to Devonshire Street. The small halls became library space, carpet was laid, and the roof retiled. by 1995 the building was large used as office space for Institute staff, the Welfare Officer and several other groups. It was also hired to various railway groups and the general public. By the early 1990s the exterior of the building had deteriorated to such an extent that State Projects Heritage Group were engaged by Rail Estate to document repair and maintenance work to it. This was carried out in 1995 and included brick repointing, replacement and cleaning, stone replacement and repair, joinery repair and replacement, roof repairs and in one part rebuilding, stormwater drainage and new rainwater goods, and replacement of the lantern ventilator. The work was carried out by the government Architects Office in association with Conrad & Gargett and was of sufficient quality to receive a recommendation for conservation by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (NSW Chapter) in 1996. At this time it was proposed to convert the Institute Building into a management training centre for State Rail personnel, and sketch drawings were prepared by State Projects at the beginning of 1996. However, this proposal was not developed further. The building is presently (1998) unoccupied.  Description   Exterior fabric  The Railway Institute Building remains generally as it was during the 1920s. The stages of expansion which were undertaken in the first thirty years of its operation are clearly evident on its exterior and are defined by architectural style and materials employed for each stage. The original two storey section, completed in 1891, was designed in what has become termed the Federation Anglo-Dutch style, although early descriptions of the building were cognisant of its Queen Anne origins. The Queen Anne style arose out of a reaction to the Gothic idioms which dominated English architecture in the second quarter of the nineteenth century. This reaction dominated English architecture in the second half of the nineteenth century. This reaction began in the 1860s with the work and thinking of important figures such as William Morris and Philip Webb. Architects and designers began to examine other historical periods of architecture and even foreign cultures in an effort to find new inspiration, and this included a reassessment of the vernacular architecture of England and the Low Countries, particularly the way \\"in which more modest seventeenth and eighteenth-century builders...interpreted the Classical styles\\". One of the most distinctive characteristics of this new style, which was named Queen Anne, was a truthful use of materials, and the most characteristic material was red brick. It emerged in domestic architecture at the end of the 1860s and by the mid 1870s was also appropriated for commercial architecture. One notable group of buildings which made much of the style were commercial architecture. One notable group of buildings which made much of the style were schools erected by the London School Board from the 1870s to the 1890s. These domestically scaled and detailed buildings were successful because they were inexpensive to build, attractive and picturesque, and easily recognisable, whilst being constrained by tight budgets and generally small sites - all attributes of the Railway Institute Buildings. The style did not appear in Sydney until the second half of the 1880s. Amongst the very first Queen Anne buildings erected here was a residence designed by English architect Maurice B. Adams and local architect Harry Kent known as \\"Caerleon\\", designed in 1886 and built at Bellevue Hill. An \\"Anglo Dutch\\" Queen Anne building was completed at about the same time. This was a brick office building at 16-18 O'Connell Street designed by architects Coward and Bell, completed in 1888 and demolished almost exactly fifty years later. Its exterior characterised the style - red brick, white painted timber window joinery, shallow pilasters with projecting triangular piers planted onto their surfaces and, perhaps most typical of all, a series of brick Flemish gables to form a picturesque skyline at parapet level. The style appears to have been prevented from becoming widespread in New South Wales because of the depression of the 1890s which seriously restricted building activity. However, apart from the Railway Institute Building, several other notable examples have survived to the present day, including the former Woods Chambers in Scott Street, Newcastle,F.B. Menkens architect, completed 1892 Santa Sabina Convent, StrathfieldSheerin and Hennessy architects, 1893 and the Municipal Building, Hay Street, Sydney.George McRae, architect, 1894 The Railway Institute Building incorporates many distinguishing characteristics of the Federation Anglo-Dutch style, such as red brickwork, Flemish gables, shallow pilasters, moulded bricks and picturesque massing. The condition of the exterior fabric generally reflects the extensive works undertaken several years ago to it and in some cases, such as rainwater heads embossed with numerals, new fabric is clearly distinguished from old. The 1899 section was constructed in a more simple idiom than the 1891 building, although brick type and detailing closely matched the earlier structure. Its vernacular scale and details, such as the timber gable screen, are similar to the residential architecture of the period. Its external fabric also shows evidence of having conservation work carried out on it in 1995. Early twentieth century works associated with the main hall on the first floor of the 1891 building are still apparent. The stair at the western end of the building is visible through the arched window of the former porch, and the first floor addition over is distinguished by brickwork of a different tone and a flat roof. The access passage and ancillary spaces behind the stage are clad in asbestos cement shingles and have been painted a dark colour to minimise their visual impact on the building.  Interior  The interior of the building is generally in less good condition than the exterior. The presence of termites at the western end of the 1891 building and the southern end of the 1899 building is of particular concern. There is much surviving early fabric throughout the building, some of which has been concealed behind later linings. This is most evident in the main hall, where timber dados and the front of the gallery have been covered over. There are no surviving chimney pieces or hearths, and only remnants of tessellated tiles in the main entry of the 1891 building.  Landscape and setting  Early photographs show that the Railway Institute Building was enhanced by planting. At the time that the 1899 building was completed, tall shrubs grew behind the palisade fence along Devonshire Street and trees in Prince Alfred park formed a backdrop to the new addition. Planting was still in evidence, in a somewhat altered form, in 1919 when trees grew close to the 1899 addition. At the present time the building is set off by the palisade fence and areas of grass on the Chalmers Street side. Planting is confined to the eastern and southern boundaries. It comprises privet, abelia, ochna and swamp mahoganies along the eastern boundary, and privet and a grevillea robusta on the southern boundary. The age of the swamp mahoganies is thought to be fifty years old, although the privets may date to the 1920s. The building is a landmark in the locality. This is particularly so from the west, where its distinctive architecture and colour stand out across the railway lines. However, from other vantage points the building has become obscured. Views of it along Chalmers Street are particularly blocked by the substantial street trees which line the kerbs, whilst a combination of trees and ungainly lavatory structures in Prince Alfred Park prevent an appreciation of its important contribution to that public space. The northern side of the building is visually disrupted by the entrance to the Devonshire Street pedestrian subway and by trees and fencing associated with the pedestrian area to the north.  Heritage listing  The Railway Institute is culturally significant for the following reasons: It is historically significant as the first Railway Institute building to be erected in Australia, and an important educational facility at the end of the nineteenth and during the twentieth century. The 1891 section of the building is a rare and fine example of the Federation Anglo Dutch style, demonstrating a high degree of architectural quality and detail, particularly on its exterior. Later additions complement this original portion in scale and quality of materials. The building is an important and rare known example of the work of architect Henry Robinson. The building has rare technical significance because it is an outstanding and relatively intact example of a Railway Institute Building and demonstrates the activities which were carried out in association with adult education in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The building has representative social significance arising out of its seminal role as a railway institute and is still valued by a section of the community. Railway Institute Building was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Railway Institute was the first such institute in NSW and in Australia. It is an important and successful part of the history of technical and adult education in NSW, which began with the establishment of the Sydney School of Arts in 1833 and speared across the state during the rest of the nineteenth century. Its establishment also reflects the influence of English precedent whereby railway companies built Mechanics Institutes for the education of employees. It has associations with prominent figures associated with the development of the railway during the nineteenth century, most particularly Railway Commissioners Goodchap and Eddy. The building has played an important role in the cultural, recreational and social activities of Railway employees, and in the cultural life of Sydney. For instance, for many years it was the location of the city of Sydney Eisteddfod. The physical fabric of the building reveals the rapid growth of the Institute and clear evidence of the ways in which the building was used for instruction and recreational purposes. The building reflects the paternalistic and responsible attitude held by the management of the NSW Railways at the end of the nineteenth century, and the efforts of railway workers to achieve a higher level of education. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Railway Institute Building is an exceptionally fine example of the Federation Anglo Dutch style of architecture, with many characteristic features of the style such as the use of brickwork, Flemish gables, picturesque massing and decorative details. It is a rare surviving example of the work of architect Henry Robinson, of whom little has been documented and whose known output is small. The quality of the building's exterior reveal him to have been an accomplished and skilful designer who was aware of the latest architectural trends. The external fabric demonstrates a high degree of workmanship, both in intact surviving original sections and in recent conservation work. The building is reputedly the first building in NSW connected with a government instrumentality to have been finished with a Marseille-pattern terra cotta tile roof. This significance, however, has been diminished by later replacement of the original roofing, resulting in the loss of important detail such as cresting. The building has retained much of the early and original internal fabric and configuration. The main hall on the first floor of the 1891 building in particular is a fine space and has retained much original decorative fabric. It is considered to be a rare example of a small public hall from the late Victorian period. The building is a most important part of the physical environment of the area, particularly in relation to Prince Alfred Park, Chalmers Street and the Central Railway complex. It has the potential to be reinstated as a prominent visual landmark that forms a positive component of the local townscape, but presently is obscured by small buildings and trees on three sides. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Railway Institute Building is socially significant because of its strong associations with railway employees in the past in NSW, and apparently is still very meaningful to many older employees. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The building is significant because it is a fine example of its type, which is still evident despite later modifications. It provides evidence of the processes of adult education at the end of last century and in the first quarter of the twentieth century.

When Kurdish units conquered the then ISIL capital Rakka in October 2017, the two turned to the Kurdish authorities, which detained them in the Kurdish-controlled areas of Syria. Marcia M. had been trying to recruit potential supporters from Syria and to persuade female Islamists in northern Germany via the internet to marry ISIL fighters as a camouflage for the operation, but came to an informant of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution. The recruited women should then have invited the fighters to Germany so that they could commit the planned attack there. The orders for the attacks could go back to a senior ISIL official with the fighting name Abu Mussab al-Almani alias the Swiss Thomas C., who is said to have been killed fighting in Syria. The plan ultimately failed because of the knowledge of the investigators and also because of the disintegration of the ISIL militia in Syria.

Life and career Elizabeth Langley was born in Melbourne, Australia in 1933. Early dance education occurred at the Studio of Creative Dancing in Melbourne. Her father, indicated to her, at a young age, \\"If you can turn your passion into your profession, you will be the happiest person in the world.\\" From 1960 to 1965 she lived in New York, where she trained in the Martha Graham technique at Graham's studios on East 63rd Street, and experienced the burgeoning modern and post-modern American dance scene. She then moved to Ottawa, Ontario. She undertook a number of jobs: opening a dress boutique, serving as manager of the Caf√© Le Hibou Coffee House, where performers Josh White Jr., Odetta, James Cotton, and Bruce Cockburn headlined, teaching dance at the Strathmere Farm summer day camp in North Gower, Ontario. She taught a Movement for Actors course at the University of Ottawa in the fall of 1975. Among her students was Christopher House, who said, \\"She always has a question that she's grappling with. This means constantly setting challenges for yourself. There must be the feeling that there is something more. Step back and shake it up!\\" In 1979, at Concordia University, she designed a university dance degree program geared to training choreographers, as well as technique, became the first chair of the Department of Modern Dance, inaugurated in the 1980/81 academic year. It was renamed the Department of Contemporary Dance in 1987. She describes the development of the program as a key experience. Concentrated study allowed students to create their own choreographic work and teachers did not impose their own technique or develop their work on the cohort. Among those who graduated from the program include, Pierre-Paul Savoie, Jeff Hall (dancer), Jacques Brochu, Isabelle Choini√®re, Noam Gagnon, Florence Figols, Thea Patterson Sasha Kleinplatz Andrew Tay and Ireni Stamou. After studying in Amsterdam, at the School of New Dance Development, she retired in 1997 to develop her own style of physical theatre. On her return to Canada in January 1997, she became involved with various projects for companies and solo artists in Canada - assistant director for Maxine Heppner, studio consultant for Denise Fujiwara,Canada Council, for the Arts, St√©phane Dubois & Danielle Philbert, Elizabeth Langley Wins 33rd Canada Council for the Arts Jacqueline Lemieux Prize, 1998. and dramaturge to Sashar Zarif. Langley sees the dramaturge as a \\"mentor, a person who helps a choreographer reach clarity about his or her choreographic expression by responding to the emerging work from the position of an informed ‚Äòfirst spectator.‚Äô Langley operates from a neutral position, in which the dramaturg attempts to leave no artistic imprint on the work. In 1997, she received the Jacqueline Lemieux Prize, a Canada Council for the Arts award recognizing a dance professional's exceptional contribution to the dance milieu in Canada. At a theatre festival in Turkey, she met the Australian theatre director Paul Rainsford Towner, head of the troupe Chapel of Change.

Retisols are characterized by clay migration and an additional specific feature: The clay-poorer and lighter coloured eluvial horizon intercalates netlike into the clay-richer more intensely coloured illuvial horizon. The illuvial horizon is the diagnostic argic horizon, and the intercalation is called retic properties (Latin: rete = net). Retisols were newly introduced with the third edition of the WRB in 2014. They include the narrower defined AlbeluvisolsW. Zech, P. Schad, G. Hintermaier-Erhard: B√∂den der Welt. 2. Auflage. Springer-Spektrum, Heidelberg 2014, . of the first and second edition (1998 and 2006), which were abolished in 2014. The definition of the Retisols resembles the definition of the Podzoluvisols of the Legend (1974) and the Revised Legend (1988) of the FAO soil classification.  Horizonation  A typical horizon sequence according to the FAO Guidelines for Soil DescriptionFAO Guidelines for Soil Description.

In Europe, they are found along a belt from Belgium through northern Germany, Poland and Belarus to Russia. Because the very specific retic properties are not so widespread, they normally do not cover larger areas. Most Retisols are dominated by high-activity clays and show a low base saturation.

In the subsoil, the rainwater runs downwards predominantly in the clay-poorer parts, whereas the clay-richer and therefore also nutrient-richer parts are often insufficiently humid. The clay-richer parts are relatively dense and difficult to be rooted. These characteristics make the Retisols also unattractive for many soil animals, especially earthworms. Retisols have typically sandy or silty topsoils that are prone to erosion.  Relationships with other Reference Soil Groups  The WRB defines five Reference soil Groups with a compulsory argic horizon. Only the Retisols have retic properties. The other four are differentiated according to the cation exchange capacity per kg clay at pH 7 (CEC / kg clay) in the argic horizon and according to the base saturation calculated per sum of exchangeable cations (BSeff) in the subsoil. For Luvisols both values are high. Alisols have a high CEC and a low BS. Lixisols have a low CEC and a high BS. For Acrisols both values are low. Soils with an argic horizon and retic properties that are dominated by stagnant water are classified as Retic Stagnosols.

She was the sister of Nicolaas Beets, who called her Serena in his works.  Life   Provenance and early years  Dorothea \\"Dora\\" Petronella Beets was born in Haarlem where Martinus Nicolaas Beets, her father, was an apothecary and her upbringing reflected her parents' adherence to the mainstream Protestant Dutch Reformed Church. She was the eldest of her parents' seven children, and continued to live with her parents at their home in the Koningstraat (\\"King Street\\") till she married the book dealer and publisher Pieter Fran√ßois Bohn in Haarlem on 6 July 1835: she took the name Dorothea Petronella Bohn-Beets. Dora was twelve years younger than her husband who was a Mennonite. The couple moved into the corner house where Pieter Bohn conducted his business, in the city centre at the point where Grote Houtstraat crosses one side of the Verwulft (square). The marriage would produce at least eight children of whom two sons and two daughters are known to have reached adulthood. The fact that Beets came from the Reformed Church tradition while her husband came from the minority Mennonite community seems not to have been a problem. Intriguingly, as each of the children's births was registered with the city hall, their stated religious affiliations alternated. Only with the birth registrations for the youngest two children was the pattern broken: Fran√ßois en Martinus were both registered as Mennonites.  Onze buurt  Her book Onze buurt (\\"Our neighborhood\\") was published anonymously in 1861. Indeed, the term used, \\"een ongenemde\\" (\\"an unnamed [author]\\") applied the male version of the definite article, implying that the unnamed author was a man. The anonymity also meant that the uninformed reader had no reason to know that the author was an elder sibling of Nicolaas Beets, a theologian and popular poet who was already well known in Haarlem as a published author, despite publishing his works under the pseudonym \\"Hildebrand\\". Only after Dora's death, when the second edition appeared in 1870, did the book incorporate an introduction by Nicolaas Beets in which he disclosed that the author, Dorothea Bohn-Beets, had been his sister. The book's publication received little press coverage, but it was nevertheless reasonably popular with readers. A sixth edition was published in 1911. In 2002 a new edition was published, using modern (post 1995) spelling. The book provides a striking description of daily life among the 19th century haute bourgeoisie. The setting is clearly Haarlem (though the city is identified merely as \\"X\\") during the 1860s. The family of the main protagonist, Mrs. Rueel, is not identical to that of Dorothea Bohn, but it nevertheless becomes apparent from studying her private correspondence that many of the experiences and happenings related in the book correspond to real- life events in the author's own life. In February 1862 Dora Beets wrote her brother a letter in which she confided how \\"... in that book I have set out the innermost outpourings of my own heart in all their variety, and all sorts of mouths have given voice to my own beliefs and confessions\\". In Onze buurt, Dorothea Bohn-Beets describes mid-nineteenth century city life with its relatively fixed hierarchical structure, the houses of the upper and lower middle-classes and the charitable undertakings by citizens and their wives seeking to alleviate the screaming poverty in the city. She also focuses on the differences within and between church congregations, between traditionalist and \\"modern\\" versions of Protestantism. The author hints at her own position through the views and actions of her lead protagonist, who champions an evangelical Christianity. It is nevertheless striking that Roman Catholics, who were certainly present in Haarlem in significant numbers at that time, seem not to exist in the city of \\"X\\". A further recurring theme involves feeding people: Mrs. Rueel feeds not merely her three children but also, where necessary, all the neighbours. She is an exceptionally successful provider of sustenance. This is clearly a characteristic that the author uses to idealise her heroine despite the context of a setting that is in other respects realistic. A commentator explains that without some sort of didactic idealisation, a Dutch novel of this period could not exist, because it would carry no useful message. Usefulness, in literature, was very important.

She is a member of the Democratic Party. Early life and career Schrier was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, and earned a bachelor's degree from the University of California, Berkeley, graduating Phi Beta Kappa with a degree in astrophysics. She attended the University of California Davis School of Medicine, where she earned her Doctor of Medicine. She continued on to a residency at the Stanford University School of Medicine. Schrier's professional career as a pediatrician began in Ashland, Oregon where she worked for one year before joining Virginia Mason Medical Center in Issaquah, Washington in 2001. While working at Virginia Mason, Schrier became politically active, particularly regarding healthcare issues. In 2017, Schrier was dissatisfied with Congressman Dave Reichert's handling of the efforts to repeal and replace the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and this, coupled with her frustration with the results of the 2016 elections, led to her decision to enter politics. U.S. House of Representatives Elections  2018  Schrier announced her intention to run to represent in the 2018 elections in August 2017, a year before the jungle primary. Initially intending to challenge Republican incumbent Dave Reichert, it became an open seat in September 2017 when Reichert announced he was retiring. She had decided to run after the 2016 election, making the expansion of Medicare and the Affordable Care Act the centerpiece of her campaign. Whereas no Democrat had ever been elected to represent the district and Reichert had been seen as a relatively safe incumbent, his decision to retire left the swing seat as a potential Democratic pickup in an election year already leaning toward the Democratic Party. Schrier advanced from the top-two primary, narrowly defeating attorney Jason Rittereiser, and advancing to face Republican nominee Dino Rossi in the general election. The 8th district campaign attracted $25 million in spending, making it the most expensive in state history and one of the costliest nationally for the 2018 election, and included controversial attack ads from the Rossi campaign. One such ad, paid for by the Washington State Republican Party, nicknamed Schrier \\"Dr. Tax\\" and depicted her holding a large stack of $20 bills. The ad was perceived as Antisemitic, fulfilling stereotypes about Jewish greed. In the November general election, Schrier received 52 percent of the vote and won the seat.

Location  The Trappentreustra√üe is located about three kilometers west of Munich city center in the district Schwanthalerh√∂he of the Westend district. It runs in a north-south direction. Through the construction of the Trappentreutunnel, two route sections were created. On the northern section, up to 135,000 vehicles drive through the Mittlerer Ring daily, where as in the southern section above the tunnel, only 3,000 vehicles drive there daily. The Trappentreustra√üe has about 3,300 residents.  Route  The Trappentreustra√üe begins at the southern end of the Donnersbergerbr√ºcke at the intersection Landsberger Stra√üe (B 2 direction Augsburg) and runs south. The main lanes, with two lanes each, are routed via Landsberger Stra√üe. The secondary lanes serve as feeders to the Landsberger Stra√üe and the side streets. The main lane then goes into the, 1984 built, Trappentreutunnel. After the vehicles in the secondary lanes merge with Guldeinstra√üe and the Westendstra√üe, and the main lane is in the tunnel, they continue on as a one- lane road. The road crosses the Tulbeckstra√üe and reaches the Gollierplatz. The throughway is prohibited for private transport from there until the intersection on Gollierstra√üe. After crossing Gollierstra√üe, the intersection with Kazmairstra√üe follows. The Trappentreustra√üe ends at Heimeranplatz. At the southern end of the Heimeranplatz is also the end of the Trappentreutunnel and goes on from there to the Garmischer Stra√üe towards Sendling-Westpark. The road traffic of the surface is connected to it via connection ramps.  Traffic  Trappentreustra√üe in the area of the Mittlerer Ring plays a significant role in the Munich transport network. A relief of the southern section came in 1984, after the Trappentreutunnel opened and traffic was directed there. In addition to several bus lines, north of the Donnersbergerbr√ºcke is the location of the station, which carries the same name, and immediately south of Heimeranplatz are the S- and U-Bahn station, also named Heimerplatz, on the M√ºnchner S√ºdring. For the dormant traffic a parking space management was introduced in the Trappentreustra√üe (southern section).  History  In the second half of the 19th century, the architect Gabriel von Seidl created a noble suburb in the west of the city modeled from other major European cities. In this context, the Trappentreustra√üe was built and was initially an 18 meter wide side street. From 1919 to 1920, the city built the tram line 22 through the Trappentreustra√üe, from the Alten Sendlinger Kirche (Old Sendlinger Church) to Rotkreuzplatz. The grand opening took place on March 23, 1920. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Mittlerer Ring was built. For which the Trappentreustra√üe was widened to 38.5 meters. This was done by demolishing the houses on the west side of the street. Due to this new addition, the tram line 22 was put out of commission on 1 March 1970. In the following years, the district intersected this partly eight-lane main traffic axis. Therefore, the city decided in the late 1970s to tunnel under the road. Construction began on 1 February 1980. On 16 October 1983, the Trappentreutunnel Norther direction lanes were open to traffic, the tube in southern direction was opened on 27 April 1984. Simultaneously with the construction of the tunnel, the city also built the underground line U4 and U5. These were opened on 10 March 1984 and received a station at Heimeranplatz. The city rebuilt the surface in the years that followed back to a two-lane road. In order to prevent the passage of the entire Trappentreustra√üe for private traffic (which should use the tunnel), a so- called \\"plug\\" was installed at Gollierplatz. Here the passage is only allowed for public buses, taxis, and cyclists. Parking management was introduced in the 1990s.  Naming  The street is named after Johann Baptist Trappentreu, who was known for his generous donations. In addition to the needs in Munich, he also donated to Africa and Palestine.

Two prototype lines has been set up by the DOST, one within the University of the Philippines Diliman campus and another in Bicutan in Taguig. Background The Philippine government through the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) has made efforts to develop a locally designed Automated Guideway Transit System (AGTS) to curb heavy traffic and air pollution in Metro Manila. The DOST's AGTS was conceptualized to be similar to that of a monorail system but at one-fifth of its cost. AGTS lines are intended to be set up in Metro Manila to augment or serve as a \\"feeder\\" to the existing Manila Metro Rail Transit System. A prototype system was developed by the DOST with the University of the Philippines Diliman as a means to demonstrate AGT technology as an efficient mode of transport for the country. The project is part of the DOST's broader High-Impact Technology Solutions (HITS) project. The leading implementing agency is the Metals Industry Research and Development Center (MIRDC) Other child agencies of the DOST involved are the Philippine Council for Industry, Energy and Emerging Technology Research and Development (PCIEERD) which funded the project under the Makina at Teknolohiya para sa Bayan (MakiBayan) Program of the MIRDC, and Project Management and Engineering Design Services Office (PMEDSO). The UP National Center for Transportation Studies, College of Engineering, and the National Institute of Geological Sciences are also involved in the project as consultants to the DOST. The project‚Äôs lead implementing agency in DOST‚Äî the Metals Industry Research and Development Center (MIRDC)‚Äîconstructed the train‚Äôs main mechanical frameworks or ‚Äúrolling stocks‚Äù, and subcontracted local companies and Fil-Asia Automotive to construct the guideway and the coaches, respectively, based on the design team‚Äôs specifications. History A prototype elevated line, which ran from CP Garcia Street to Jacinto Street near the College of Fine Arts was first established within the University of the Philippines Diliman campus in Quezon City. The first test run for the AGTS was made at this line on December 14, 2012. Rolling stock The Metals Industry Research and Development Center constructed the rolling stocks or main mechanical frameworks used for the DOST's AGTS. Construction of the coaches were also subcontracted to Fil-Asia Automotive. At least two rolling stock prototypes has been developed as part of the AGTS project of the DOST, the AGT 30 and the AGT 120. The former was used in the University of the Philippines line while the latter was used in the Bicutan line. The AGT 30, can carry 30 passenger per coach and has two passenger sections with safety features. It also has a communication and automated fare collection system. The prototype has two coaches with full airconditioning and has a suspension system, solid tires for guide wheels and extra wide automatic sliding doors. The full load top speed of each coach is . The AGT 120 has a larger capacity, with its capacity of 120 passenger per coach. The target maximum speed of each coach is . Track design and compatibility DOST's AGTS was initially conceptualized as a monorail in 2011 but modifications made to the prototype has revised the project. The current design of the AGTS makes use of a railroad track with two rails instead of only one rail used in monorails.

The album was inspired by the nature and environment of his home in Huntsville, Ontario, including the surrounding lakes and woods. Recorded using only a Yamaha DX7 and Roland TR-707 drum machine, the musician felt he was able to musically display the feelings that the environment gave him accurately. He felt the entirely electronic instrumentation he used was comparable to an orchestra because of the range of sounds he could create. The album is considered to be an electronic new age album, with pensive, relaxing music and comforting vocals. Upon release, Keyboard Fantasies only sold several copies, but soon grew a reputation among audiophiles as an overlooked, pioneering electronic work. A Japanese fan known in audiophile circles contacted Glenn-Copeland to send him copies of the album in 2015 which he then sold. This helped rise the album's popularity, and soon Glenn-Copeland received offers from record labels hoping to re-release the album. Remastered and reissued on vinyl by Canadian labels Invisible City Editions and Seance Centre in 2017, the album became popular among a new generation of listeners, for whom Glenn-Copeland began performing the album live.

His songwriting and performing credits for children's shows also included Shining Time Station and Mr. Dressup, but he also released his own music in the meantime. This pattern was the musician's regimen for almost three decades, and he would also chant each day at home and weekly within his Buddhist group. It was during this prolonged period that he created Keyboard Fantasies in 1986, a time when he was living in Huntsville, Canada. The album was heavily inspired by the serene environment he was living in, including the surrounding woods and lakes, which he says he can \\"hear\\" in the music. He felt the album features an \\"innocence that was part of my experience at the time.\\" The need to make Keyboard Fantasies was also partly born from how writing children's music restricted the musician from making \\"personal statements.\\" Recorded at Audio-Logic Recording Studio, Huntsville, Ontario, with engineering and mixing work from Collen Veitch, Keyboard Fantasies was written on and performed entirely using a Yamaha DX7 and Roland TR-707 drum machine. Although Glenn-Copeland had discovered computers some five years beforehand, he was \\"waiting for them to be able to help me with music,\\" as he later commented. He felt they were finally able to do so for the production of the album. He said the electronic instruments gave him a pallet that he felt \\"was essentially for me an orchestra\\", saying: \\"It allowed me to write everything I was hearing. I don't just hear melody and harmony. I hear all kinds of other lines. 'This is a cello part, this is for the horns.' It was the closest I could come and I was ecstatic and slept only three hours a night, spent all of my time in my studio going nuts.\\" Glenn-Copeland later described himself as being in an \\"elevated state\\" during recording, and reflected that, upon hearing the album, \\"what I felt was that what I was listening to was these woods, and to my reaction to this environment.\\" Composition Keyboard Fantasies is an electronic new age album, which combines new-age sounds with lo-fi soul music. Writer Andrew Ryce felt that: \\"In scope and style, it was of a piece with American new age private press music at the time,\\" while Red Bull Radio felt the album was a visionary combination of \\"digital new-age and early Detroit techno experiments.\\" Music journalist Evan John called the release a fusion of folk, ambient and electronica. Glenn-Copeland described the music as \\"New Age multilayered synthesizer music to relax, dance and sing with,\\" and felt that, in retrospect, the sounds could be described as \\"simplistic.\\" Although bass- heavy and rhythmic in style, the music is relaxing and pensive, presenting positive vibes, while the musician's singing is \\"comforting and almost wizened, like someone singing lullabies at your bedside,\\" according to Ryce. The Yamaha DX7 and Roland TR-707 are used for a introspective and meditative feel, contributing to the album's arresting sonic style. \\"Winter Astral\\" features a warm bass line, while \\"Let's Us Dance\\" features \\"elegant synth tones\\" that Ryce compared to a \\"decorous Romantic painting.\\" Electric piano features throughout \\"Old Melody\\", while \\"Slow Dance\\" features somewhat exotic instrumentation which Ryce compared to the Music from Memory catalogue. Release and rediscovery Originally self-released as a cassette tape in 1986, only a handful of copies of Keyboard Fantasies were sold. The album nonetheless became considered a \\"criminally overlooked and pioneering piece of electronic music\\" among a select group of audiophiles, according to Eric Volmers of the Calgary Herald. Among the audiophile fans was a Japanese collector who contacted Glenn-Copeland in December 2015 to ask if he could send him any available copies of the album so he could sell them. The musician sent him 30 copies. These copies sold out immediately in Japan, so Glenn- Copeland sent him 30 more copies, which also all sold out. The musician finally sent the collector all the remaining copies he owned, which too sold out. Unbeknown to Glenn-Copeland, the Japanese fan was well-known in audiophile circles, and his interest in the album drew the interest of followers worldwide. Glenn-Copeland said: \\"I didn't know [...] he is known worldwide. People were watching what he put up, what he played.\\" Two months later, the musician received offers from ten different record labels hoping to re-release Keyboard Fantasies on vinyl. The newfound popularity of the album helped it rise from relative obscurity. After much anticipation, Keyboard Fantasies was remastered and reissued in February 2017 by Invisible City Editions, a Toronto-based reissue label based only several hours' drive away from the album's recording location. The release follows South African dance artist V.O.'s album Mashisha, which was highlighted in several publications. The Keyboard Fantasies reissue won Glenn-Copeland \\"almost instantaneous\\" appreciation. The album was re-released again on vinyl later in 2017 as the first release on S√©ance Centre, a reissue label dedicated to avant-garde and electronic music, started by former Invisible City Editions employee Brandon Hocura. S√©ance Centre promoted the reissue with a six-minute short film entitled The Lake Sultra, in which Glenn-Copeland revisited the environment he recorded the album in. Reception and legacy Despite Glenn-Copeland making music for 40 years, the re-issues of Keyboard Fantasies finally led to his music enjoying a wider audience. Anton Spice of The Vinyl Factory felt that the album was \\"now reaching a wider audience entranced by the music of fellow explorers Laraaji, Pauline Anna Strom and more.\\" Red Bull Music Academy felt the album's \\"visionary approach\\" helped it resonate with a younger generation. Jasper Willems of Le Guess Who? called the album a \\"New Age classic\\" and noted that only since its rediscovery was it that \\"the full extent of this multifaceted individuals' creative past, present and future\\" were being realized. Josephine Cruz of Complex felt it was his most noted work. Andrew Ryce of Resident Advisor described Keyboard Fantasies as \\"modest but stunning\\" and praised the \\"arresting\\" music and Glenn-Copeland's \\"one-of-a-kind voice.\\" He concluded: \\"Unabashedly sentimental as it is, Keyboard Fantasies isn't for everyone, but fans of new age and oddball synth music will find something to love in Copeland's evergreen world, which still sounds wondrous and new, even 30 years on from its original release.\\" Boing Boing described the album as \\"exquisite New Age music\\" and felt that Seance Centre's \\"beautiful reissue\\" brought Keyboard Fantasies \\"into the sunlight where it belongs.\\" Tom Ewing of Freaky Trigger felt that \\"[t]he keyboard fantasies themselves are indeed lovely, ethereal and relaxing,\\" but wrote that \\"Glenn Copeland‚Äôs vocals are more distracting ‚Äì he‚Äôs not a bad singer but his intensity sits slightly awkwardly with the music.\\" He did however comment that this disjunction, which he felt bordered on 'outsider' status, was likely \\"what attracted the cultists to this record in the first place, of course.\\" In 2017, The Stranger listed the album as one of the 70 greatest albums made by women.Keyboard Fantasies was recorded before Glenn-Copeland transitioned gender and still identified as female, per Ewing. Of the album's reappraisal, Glenn-Copeland said: \\"I'm so happy so many other people are now hearing it and going 'this is very beautiful music'. But what you should understand folks is, I'm just the messenger.\\" The album's re-release was followed by the reissue of Glenn- Copeland's self-titled folk album from 1970, which had only originally been released in Europe. The reissues of his material dumbfounded Glenn-Copeland, who felt the experience was \\"unexpected.\\" With his newfound appreciation, the musician gave a lecture at Red Bull Music Academy, where he told the story of the renewed interest in Keyboard Fantasies, and also performed shows with the Queer Songbook Orchestra of Toronto. With his new band Indigo Rising, the 74-year old Glenn-Copeland followed the Keyboard Fantasies reissues by touring after a 20 year absence, claiming: \\"Now I'm ready, and now I'm old, but it's all happening.\\" He decided to perform the album live due to the demand, commenting: \\"There is this young generation that is so excited about this music and it would be selfish of me to sit around going, 'I am sorry, I don't tour'.\\" He felt the response to the performances was \\"profound.\\" Track listing All songs written by Beverly Glenn-Copeland.

It was established in 1986, following Decree 27/1986, of 29 April. It is an annual award, whose number may vary, without exceeding ten medals in the same year, except those granted by courtesy or reciprocity. Such was the case in 2008, in which ten medals were handed out on an ordinary basis, but two were granted in an extraordinary manner to Queen Sof√≠a and the former President of the Government of Extremadura, Juan Carlos Rodr√≠guez Ibarra. The delivery of the Medal falls to the President of the Regional Government of Extremadura, who by decree awards it, listing the merits for which the prize is obtained. However, any citizen of Extremadura or entity can submit a candidature before the regional administration, which can then be taken into consideration by a commission and subsequently approved by the Governing Council. In this case, up to five medals are reserved, leaving the rest in the judgment of the Chief Executive of Extremadura. In the case of medals for courtesy or reciprocity, the proposal is exclusive of the President. The winners can be individuals, entities, corporations, or associations that have been outstanding in or out of Extremadura due to their merits or for the services rendered to the region. Thus, the medal has gone to people in the world of arts and sports, political personalities, local corporations, financial institutions, associations, religious congregations, and monasteries, among others. The Medal of Extremadura is normally presented at an event held on the eve of 8 September, , at the Roman Theatre of M√©rida, capital city of the Autonomous Community. Description The Medal of Extremadura has an oval shape, with an axis greater than 60 millimeters and another smaller than 46 millimeters. The obverse has a perimeter fringe of 5 mm, divided into two parts joined by tongues. The upper part is enameled in azure, while the lower part is in gold with the inscription \\"Extremadura\\". The enameled coat of arms is housed in the interior oval. On the back, engraved in gold, is an oak leaf with the legend \\"Junta de Extremadura\\". In addition, it bears the award date of the medal and the winner's name. The Medal is worn from a braided silk cord in green, black, and white, the colors of the Flag of Extremadura. The winners are also given an engraved silver plate, where the reason for the concession is explained, as well as a miniature reproduction of the Medal as a badge or lapel pin. The winners, in turn, are enrolled in a Book of Honor created for this purpose. History The first person awarded with the Medal of Extremadura was the then King of Spain, Juan Carlos I, according to the Additional Provision of the decree by which the medal was created in 1986. Since then, with the exception of 1987, medals have been awarded annually, to over 100 recipients in total. On each occasion, more than one Medal has been given, except in 1988, where it was only granted to the poet Jes√∫s Delgado Valhondo. In 2008, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the approval of the , the Government granted two Medals of an extraordinary nature in a Government Council held in the Monastery of Yuste. One of them was delivered to Queen Sof√≠a at an official reception at the Palace of Zarzuela on 23 June. The other was awarded to Juan Carlos Rodr√≠guez Ibarra, first democratic President of the Government of Extremadura, who retired in 2007 after 24 years in office. The award ceremony was held on 21 May 2008 at the Assembly of Extremadura. In 2010, the year in which the definitive approval of the reform of the Statute of Autonomy of Extremadura was foreseen, the Government of Extremadura granted the Medal to the Prince of Asturias at that time, Felipe de Borb√≥n y Grecia, in an extraordinary manner as Heir to the Crown. The award ceremony took place in Trujillo on 29 April, on the occasion of an official visit by the Prince and Princess of Asturias, Felipe and Letizia, to the town's National Cheese Fair. In 2014, after the death of Adolfo Su√°rez on 23 March, the regional government granted him the Medal posthumously for being the country's first democratic Prime Minister after Francoist Spain, driving the Spanish Transition to Democracy. There have been no cases of resignation by the winners to date. The only withdrawal of the Extremadura Medal was proposed in 2014, specifically that awarded to the Paralympic swimmer Enrique Tornero in 1996, due to his judicial conviction for prevarication and fraud in his time as a councilor in the City of Plasencia.

The original inscription by Hamilton is no longer there, but a plaque unveiled by the Taoiseach √âamon de Valera in 1958 marks the spot where he recorded his discovery. Many prominent mathematicians have attended the event; they include Wolf Prize winner Roger Penrose (2013), Abel Prize and Copley Medal winner Andrew Wiles (2003), Fields Medallists Timothy Gowers (2004) and Efim Zelmanov (2009), and Nobel Prize winners Murray Gell-Mann (2002), Steven Weinberg (2005) and Frank Wilczek (2007).Hamilton Walk Department of Mathematics at National University of Ireland Maynooth It has been argued that the discovery of the quaternions, by revealing deep mathematical structures that did not obey the commutative law, allowed mathematicians to create new systems unbound by the rules of ordinary arithmetic.

History The first known member of the family was Roland Sz√ºgyi, a landowner of Sz√ºgy in N√≥gr√°d County, who is mentioned by a single source in 1255. He later moved to V√°s√°ri in Bihar County (today an uninhabited place). He had three sons: Gregory, Lawrence and Nicholas I. They involved in a lawsuit over the determination of boundaries of their inherited land V√°s√°ri, and reached an agreement with their neighbor comes Peter Ajkai in 1295. Both Gregory and Nicholas were familiaris of the powerful military leader D√≥zsa Debreceni, an important and loyal soldier of Charles I of Hungary. Nicholas I, also served as vice-voivode for a time, married a sister of Archbishop Csan√°d Telegdi, which made his family to rose to prominence. Nicholas' eldest son Nicholas II was a prominent prelate and diplomat during the reign of Ladislaus I of Hungary. Due to the influence of his maternal uncle, he attended a foreign (presumably Italian) universitas thereafter, as Pope Clement VI referred to him as iuris peritus (\\"learned in the law\\"). He visited the papal court of Avignon as a skilled diplomat since the 1340s. Beside his official diplomatic issues, he also asked the contribution of the pope in personal affairs: he requested the forgiveness of sins for himself and his living relatives, including his mother, for the time of their death; in February 1344, he asked Clement to permit him and his brothers, John, Thomas and Beke, to pilgrimage to the Holy Land with the accompaniment of each 10 persons. V√°s√°ri also requested the pope to grant the right of indulgence to the parish church in their residence V√°s√°ri, dedicated to Martin of Tours. He died as Archbishop of Esztergom in 1358. In the same time, Nicholas II's younger brothers, John, Thomas and Beke were courtly knights in the royal court of Louis I. Beke was isp√°n of Aranyos Seat in 1344. He died during his young age, his son was Thomas II, a provost of Szenttam√°s. Thomas I was granted the castle of Rupoly (or Ropoly) and its surrounding lands (today part of Kaposv√°r) in 1358; The castle laid in one of the islands of the swampland along the Kapos river. Thereafter V√°s√°ri became a prominent landowner in Somogy County. There Thomas V√°s√°ri and his sons built a new castle, which was first mentioned by contemporary sources in 1387. Thereafter the family was called with the surname Rupol√∫jv√°ri (lit. \\"Rupol's New Castle\\"). His sons, Stephen and John were involved in the 1403 noble uprising against King Sigismund, who confiscated their castle and lands and divided its accessories and handed over to Martin Szerdahelyi and John Tam√°si. Stephen's only son Thomas (III) bore the surname Alberti in the 1430s (last mentioned in 1437), who owned Brezovica (Berz≈ëce) for a time.

The area of the main Arboretum, at Tokai Park, is 14 ha. Several adjacent compartments extend the area to 26 ha. The Arboretum was declared a National Monument in 1985, on its 100th anniversary. It contains stands of Eucalyptus and other trees from the original silviculture experiments in South Africa. In the 1990s a Gondwana Garden was created to display the plants typical of the Cape 100 million years ago. The Tokai Arboretum is a collection of trees of different sizes, established without a silvicultural or arboricultural plan (lack of open vistas, swards, shrubberies and beds of flowers to display the trees). Tokai Arboretum has stands of Karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor), Scribbly Gum, Jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), Redwoods (Sequoioideae), Aleppo Pines (Pinus halepensis), Stone Pines (Pinus pinea) and many other tree species . There are about 28 trees in the main Arboretum with record heights for South Africa. The main Arboretum at Tokai is the oldest wholly government financed arboretum in South Africa. Following the establishment of the main Arboretum, three lesser arboreta were initiated at Tokai Plantation, namely the Paddock Arboretum (on infertile sands of the Cape Flats), the Spekboom Belt Arboretum (on fertile granite slopes) and the Flagstaff Arboretum. The latter was soon abandoned. Gum trees at Tokai Arboretum  A brief history of Tokai Arboretum The first exotic plantings at Tokai were made in 1694, when English Oaks (Quercus robur) were established there by Simon van der Stel. The earliest attempt at commercial afforestation at Tokai was in 1884 when Joseph Storr Lister planted Monterey Pines (Pinus radiata). In 1886 an arboretum was laid out adjoining the nursery at Tokai, and 150 species were established, including a few indigenous species. There were already some Stone Pine present in a small copse. During 1902 some additional 43 plant species were established in the Tokai Arboretum. A systematic effort was made to introduce other exotic species for plantation trial and it was decided to obtain species from countries with similar climates. Trees from Australia, India, the southern states of North America and Mexico consequently received attention. The plantation trials revealed that conifers were more suited to the Cape Flats than broad-leaved trees, although Eucalyptus did well on deeper, richer soils. From 1906-1911 Tokai hosted The South African Forestry School ‚Äúfor training men for the higher grades of the Forest Service.‚Äù Two students of this school, J.D.M. Keet and A.J. O‚ÄôConner, later became directors of national forestry. In 1932 this school was moved to Saasveld, near George, Western Cape. In 1933 the director of forestry, Mr. J.D.M. Keet, requested the conservator of forestry to devote more attention to the Tokai Arboretum‚Äôs upkeep, and provided specific instructions, aimed at making the area more attractive to visitors and at improving its educational and scientific value. However the Tokai Arboretum lapsed steadily into a state of greater neglect. During 1951, Mr. Paul Sauer, as minister of forestry, also remarked unfavourably on the unkempt appearance and the absence of labels for tree species.  The current state of Tokai Arboretum Although many of the trees are healthy, many are dead or moribund. Heavy invasions by Long-leaf Wattle, Blackwood, Cypress, Eucalyptus and Australian Cheesewood need to be continuously controlled. Black Locust and English Elm are coppicing particularly badly. Heavy invasions by Outeniqua and Real Yellowwood (alien to the Cape Flats) are also evident. Some areas are heavily infested with Kikuyu and Buffalo Grass. The roads through the main Arboretum are also generally in a poor condition.

Gl√∂ck is one of handful single vineyard sites in Germany which for reasons of historical significance have dispensation from having to include a village name together with the vineyard's name, so the wines from the Gl√∂ck vineyard site are simply labelled Gl√∂ck.

The resulting wines are characterised by a balance of fruit, floral, and mineral notes. Geologically, the vineyard is situated on the Rotliegend formation with a light sandy loess layer.  History and name  The name Gl√∂ck is documented by a deed of donation from the year 742, which makes it the oldest single vineyard in Germany to be known continuously under the same name. At the time of the donation Carloman, the eldest son of Charles Martel, majordomo or mayor of the palace and duke of the Franks, brother of King Pepin the Short, donated the Marienkirche (Our Ladies Church, later Kilians church) in Nierstein, including the vineyard, to the diocese of W√ºrzburg. As a result, the farmers of the vineyard had to pay the tithe to the prince-bishop in W√ºrzburg. This tithe consisted of fruit and wine. Since then the site has been continuously under vine. The wall encircling the vineyard was completed in 1761. The vineyard is presumed to take its name from the church and its bells, but it is unclear whether the name is derived from the ringing of the bell or because the church bell ringer was paid with the wine from the vineyard. The name, however, indicates the special relationship between the vineyard and the church. The adjacent Kilianskirche is still surrounded by the vineyards of this site.

Its name is a geographic portmanteau as the area was historically known as the Church Hill district prior to its extensive development in the early twentieth century.HLY.C, Massachusetts Cultural Resource Information System (MACRIS), Massachusetts Historical Commission. Located at the southwestern edge of the downtown grid, the area served as housing for mill workers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century and today contains of mixed residential and commercial zoning, including a number of historical brick tenements as well as the headquarters of the Holyoke Housing Authority, Holyoke Senior Center, Churchill Homes public housing, and the Wistariahurst Museum. History The Sacred Heart Church, prior to the construction of its spire, in the late 19th century As Holyoke grew rapidly in its first decades, a number of tenements and worker housing was constructed on the grid's south side. Seeing this growth, one Father P.J. Harkins, pastor of St. Jerome's in Holyoke Center purchased a large tract of land at the corner of Maple and Sargeant Street. Within the year the neighborhood's most prominent church, the Church of the Sacred Heart, had its cornerstone placed during the American centennial of July 4, 1876, and over the course of the next two decades a rectory and school buildings were constructed on the adjacent land. One of the most prominent secular community organizations of the early 20th century was the Churchill Athletic and Social Club, which maintained at least a baseball team, as early as 1904. Most commonly referred to as the Churchill Athletic Club (CAC), the group's football team, generally known as \\"the Churchills\\", would be local reigning champions among other teams in the Connecticut Valley leagues in 1916. Additionally the group maintained a club at 741 High Street prior to a fire in 1932. The Athletic Club remained an active organization in the community in some form as late as 1940. The neighborhood was also previously home to an early development of the Holyoke Housing Authority, Jackson Parkway, a project of 219 units built in 1943 which at one time comprised a quarter of all residential units in the area. The project soon gained notoriety for its poverty and crime and in a HUD review of the project, it was described as significantly \\"isolated from the economic and social fabric of the surrounding community\\". Efforts to improve conditions were made, including the construction of a community center in 1977, now used by the Head Start program. In 1996 the Housing Authority received a $15 million grant from the HOPE VI plan to redevelop the space entirely, and by 2003 the entirety of the Jackson Parkway project was demolished. Following the development of a revitalization project, construction began in 2003 on a new housing project known as Churchill Homes, built following the concepts of new urbanism to create space more congruent with the surrounding area's developments while granting low-income households greater homeownership; of the 202 units built, 100 are federally-assisted housing units managed by the Housing Authority, while the remaining 102 are occupant-owned. The project, emulating the surrounding neighborhoods' architecture, was completed in two phases, and received wide acclaim including a Citation Award for Design by the American Institute of Architects in 2002, and a 2003 Award of Merit in Housing and Community Development by the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials (NAHRO). During the 2008 financial crisis, the Springfield Republican and Pioneer Valley Planning Commission lauded the project as one of Holyoke's most successful housing developments as the owner-occupied homes, marketed toward low-income families, saw a markedly lower foreclosure rate than Hampden County taken as a whole.

Reconstructed corner of the Leesylvania manor house When Lee died in 1787, Leesylvania was left to his wife, Lucy, and then to their second son, Charles, upon her death in 1792. He conspicuously excluded his eldest son, \\"Light-Horse Harry\\", from inheriting most of his other properties, and any other belongings, including slaves, likely due to his history of poor financial decisions.

The Sun-Sentinel called Acker, who was based in South Florida, \\"one of the busiest actresses in the state.\\" Acker, a union activist, served as the first Actors' Equity liaison for the U.S. state of Florida, as well as the first female president of the South Florida chapter of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA). Acker, who hosted and executive produced a string of interview and talk shows on Florida public television for more than 32 years, became one of South Florida's leading advocates for the arts. Her filmography, which spanned film and television, included Flight of the Navigator (1986), Whoops Apocalypse (1986), and Cocoon: The Return (1988), as well as more than 250 television commercials. Biography Acker was born and raised in The Bronx, New York. As a child, Acker watched movies starring Fred Astaire, Eleanor Powell, and Ginger Rogers and decided to become a dancer. In an interview with the Miami Herald years later, she recalled, \\"I talked my mother into letting me take dance classes, and I quickly excelled...I was performing professionally in my teens...\\" Acker became a member of The Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall, which she revealed during a 1992 interview with Pia Zadora. She performed in supporting roles in touring theater companies, which first led her to Florida. In 1974, Acker and her husband, Philip Yacker (she amended his surname to \\"Acker\\" for professional use but Yacker was her legal surname), moved from New York to South Florida. She soon met and developed a working partnership with Charlie Cinnamon, a press agent and prominent figure in South Florida's theater community. On stage, Acker starred in a number of productions in South Florida's theater scene. Her credits included Norman, Is That You?, the first production ever performed at the Burt Reynolds Dinner Theater (now called the Maltz Jupiter Theatre) in Jupiter, Florida. In the mid-1970s, Acker co-starred with Julie Newmar in the Fort Lauderdale production of The Marriage-Go-Round. Acker hosted a series of talk and interview shows focusing of the arts in South Florida for more than 32 years. Her talk show career began at WLRN-TV in Miami when a WLRN station executive asked inquired if she would be interested in hosting a show on the local arts. Acker had never hosted a television show before, but had appeared as an entertainer on shows while growing up in New York City and thought she could learn on the job. She accepted. Her earliest shows were broadcasts of acting classes with her fellow acting teachers. The show evolved into her longtime interview show, On Stage With Iris Acker, thanks her national contacts in the entertainment industry, as well as those of her agent, Charlie Cinnamon. Guests on her one-on-one format show included Theodore Bikel, Phyllis Diller, Estelle Getty, Valerie Harper, Hal Linden, Chita Rivera, Edward Villella, and Pia Zadora. In addition to national celebrities, Acker hosted regional Florida acts on her show, including actor Nick Santa Maria, whom she performed with in Bye Bye Birdie, and folk singer Amy Carol Webb. She also used her show to promote the arts and theater in South Florida, including the Actors' Playhouse at the Miracle Theatre, which she supported since its opening in 1988, and the Coconut Grove Playhouse. \\"On Stage With Iris Acker\\" aired on WLRN for eleven years before moving to WXEL-TV in West Palm Beach. It later switched to Comcast. From 2013 to 2018, her show, which she continued to helm as part of a multihost interview panel format under the new name \\"Spotlight on the Arts\\", moved to BECON-TV. Acker simultaneously served as the creative director of the Shores Performing Arts Theatre in Miami Shores, Florida, from 1992 until 1996. She gave roles to actors who were in the early stages of their careers at the Theatre, including actor Wayne LeGette, telling the Miami Herald in a 1994 interview, \\"I was the one being discovered before. Now the tables have turned...Being able to help somebody is as gratifying as helping myself.\\" On screen, Acker was cast in a number of film and television shows that were filmed in Miami or the surrounding region. Her films included Flight of the Navigator (1986), Bachelor Party (1984), Whoops Apocalypse (1986), and Cocoon: The Return (1988). Her television credits included a 1990 role as a judge in the CBS series, Wiseguy, and the television film, Doubles, with Steve Landesberg. Acker appeared in more than 250 national and regional television commercials, including a 1990 spot for Mr. Coffee with Joe DiMaggio and a commercial for a vacuum cleaner with Tony Randall. Her commercial work led to her first book, \\"The Secrets To Auditioning for Commercials.\\" She also penned a retrospect of her interviews with actors and other notable individuals in \\"So, What Got You Where You Are Today.\\" Acker served as a judge for the Carbonell Awards, which honors productions and talent in South Florida's regional theater. She also partnered with theater critic Ron Levitt and playwright Tony Finstron to create the Silver Palm Awards in 2008, an honor for South Florida theater artists which is comparable to Broadway's Obie Awards. Death Acker lived with pancreatic cancer for the final six years of her life. She died from the disease after radiation treatments at Aventura Hospital and Medical Center in Aventura, Florida, on September 16, 2018, at the age of 88. She was survived by her two sons, Mitch and Robert Yacker, three grandchildren, and four great- grandchildren. She was predeceased by her husband, Philip, who died in 2010. Awards and honors Acker's awards and recognitions included the lifetime achievement and Remy Pioneer Awards from the Theatre League of South Florida, the Breaking the Glass Ceiling Award from the Jewish Museum of Florida, the Women Who Make a Difference honor from the YWCA, and the 2015 Howard Kleinberg Award at the 2015 Carbonell Awards for \\"contributions to the health and development of the arts in South Florida.\\" References External links * Category:1930 births Category:2018 deaths Category:American film actresses Category:American stage actresses Category:American television actresses Category:American television hosts Category:American dancers Category:Radio City Music Hall Rockettes Category:SAG-AFTRA people Category:Trade unionists from Florida Category:American women non-fiction writers Category:20th-century American actresses Category:21st-century American actresses Category:Actresses from Florida Category:People from Hallandale Beach, Florida Category:People from the Bronx Category:Actresses from New York City Category:Deaths from cancer in Florida Category:Deaths from pancreatic cancer Category:Dancers from New York (state) Category:American women trade unionists Category:Women television presenters ","title":"Iris Acker"},{"id":"58841616","text":"Clement Obojememe (born 17 August 1945) is a Nigerian footballer.

The Woman's Advocate, which started in 1855, was not the first newspaper run by women. However, unlike other newspapers such as The Lily and The Una, the Woman's Advocate was \\"produced exclusively by the joint- stock capital, energies, and industry of females.\\" (Women's Advocate, Jan. 5, 1856). Early life McDowell was born in Smyrna, Delaware. She was the daughter of William McDowell and Mary (Bassett) McDowell. Her father died when she was three years old in 1829. She was the only girl and the eldest of two brothers and one half brother from her mother's second marriage to George W. Pickering. Anne moved from Delaware to Philadelphia when she was still a child. Little is known about her early life, beyond that she used to attend Sunday school at St. Paul's Protestant Episcopal Church.  Women's Advocate  The Women's Advocate was a weekly newspaper in Philadelphia started in January of 1855 and was published until approximately 1860. The paper was run completely by women, which means that from the articles in the front page up until the copy editing was all produced only by female employees. There were other papers run by women at that time, however, the Advocate was the only and first one to hire only females. The style of the newspaper was similar to mid- nineteenth-century women‚Äôs magazines such as Ros Ballaster. Margaret Beetham. Elizabeth Frazer and Sandra Hebron magazines. The content of the paper did not focus on the claim for political rights of women, but instead the claim for commitment to literature, general news, scientific improvements and inventions and hopefully a family paper. McDowell was a feminist and shared the idea of a workplace where women did not ‚Äúclamor for the political rights of woman‚Äù but instead would focus in the use of her rights as women to make a life as she wrote in the paper on Jan. 12, 1856. Lydia Jane Wheeler Peirson and Mary Vaughn were editors and contributors, and many others notable at that time such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Jane Swisshelm, Susan B. Anthony, and Pauline Wright Davis supported the paper and recommended it as a source for women's rights. * The paper was a heavy financial drain and eventually McDowell was forced to go out of business. * The price of the paper was two dollars in that period of time. Later career After the Women's Advocate she became the editor of the woman‚Äôs department of the Philadelphia Sunday Dispatch from 1860 until 1871. Eleven years later she was at the same post at the Philadelphia Sunday Republic. Later in her life, she established the McDowell Free Library for the women who worked at Wanamaker's department store. The store's owner, John Wanamaker, wrote a letter for McDowell on her birthday offering her the opportunity to set up a library for the women employees at the store, which was called the McDowell Free Library. The library was designated for the convenience of the women folks who he considered to be also great readers. \\"In honors of a woman who has spent her life as a worker for women.\\" According to Wanamaker, McDowell was able to put the library into operation as quickly as possible. She was also able to make the rules and select the books available in the library.  Death  McDowell died at the age of 75 years in 1901. She was paralyzed in one leg from an illness and died of paralysis. She was buried in Arlington Cemetery, Drexel Hill, Pa.

Eastern Han ceramic unearthed at Chengdu, China. The Moving Sands also known as the Flowing Sands (Li√∫shƒÅ (ÊµÅÊ≤ô), \\"flowing-sand\\", or \\"quicksand\\")) is an important feature in the mythological geography of Chinese literature, including novels and poetry over a course of over two millennia from the Warring States to early Han dynasty era poetry of the Chuci onward to the present. In his poem \\"Li Sao\\", author Qu Yuan describes an aerial crossing of the Moving (or Flowing) Sands on a shamanic spiritual Journey to Kunlun. \\"Moving Sands forms one of the obstacles the fictional version of the monk Xuanzang and companions must cross over on their mission to fetch the Buddhist scriptures from India and return them to Tang China. In this story, Xuanzang recruits the former sand demon and eater- of-humans Sha Wujing who is living in Moving Sands as his third disciple. Sometimes the Moving (or Flowing) Sands seem to depict drifting dunes or desert, sometimes a sand or quicksand-like river, in which case, in Chinese, it would be (Li√∫shƒÅ-h√© (ÊµÅÊ≤ôÊ≤≥, \\"flowing-sand river\\", or \\"quicksand-river\\"). Mythological geographic context Chinese mythology and imagination developed an extensive collection of ideas, about mythological places and terrains, Moving Sands included. David Hawkes Says \\"Chu poets give this name to an unlocatable area in the mythical geography of the west, but no doubt it derives ultimately from travelers' tales of the Takla Makan desert\\" (Hawkes 1985, 332). Nearby features Various mythological geography is associated with the Moving Sands, including the Weak River, the Red River, and one or more of the eight mountain pillars, especially the (mythological) Kunlun Mountain and Jade Mountain (Yang 2005, 160-162). Literature and poetry The Moving Sands feature in literature, both in poetry and novels. Literature The heroic monk Sha Wujing, as pictured in the Journey to the West In the novel Journey to the West the Moving Sand river forms one of the barriers on the way, one of the many difficult areas which the Xuanzang the Monk, Sun Wukong the Monkey, and their companion must cross over. By the mercy and help of the Buddhist goddess Guanyin, who by forethought and prior preparation made it happen, Xuanzang met his third disciple at the Moving (or Flowing) Sands, who joins them after a brief misunderstanding. Poetry The Moving Sands are referred to allusionly in various Chinese Classical poems, including the Chuci anthology included. In lines 349-350 of his poem \\"Li Sao\\", Qu Yuan describes crossing over through the sky by means of a team of dragons: he soars above all obstacle rivers and hostile terrain at will during his spirit journey. The Li Sao helped set the tone for other poems of the Chuci, which also allude to this type of mythological geography. Real moving sands Singing sand dunes near Dunhuang, China, an example of shifting sands due to wind and gravity.

Prior to the committee's investigation, few knew of the size of Standard Oil's control and influence on seemingly unaffiliated oil refineries and pipelines - Hawke (1980) cites that only a dozen or so within Standard Oil knew the extent of company operations. The committee counsel, Simon Sterne, questioned representatives from the Erie Railroad and the New York Central Railroad and discovered that at least half of their long-haul traffic granted rebates, and that much of this traffic came from Standard Oil. The committee then shifted focus to Standard Oil's operations. John Dustin Archbold, as president of Acme Oil Company, denied that Acme was associated with Standard Oil. He then admitted to being a director of Standard Oil. The committee's final report scolded the railroads for their rebate policies and cited Standard Oil as an example.

Chinese mythology is mythology that has been passed down in oral form or recorded in literature in the geographic area now known as \\"China\\". Chinese mythology includes many varied myths from regional and cultural traditions. Chinese mythology is far from monolithic, not being an integrated system, even among just Han people. Chinese mythology is encountered in the traditions of various classes of people, geographic regions, historical periods including the present, and from various ethnic groups. China is the home of many mythological traditions, including that of Han Chinese people, their Huaxia predecessors, Tibetan mythology, Turkic mythology, Korean mythology, and many others. However, the study of Chinese mythology tends to focus upon material in the Chinese language. Much of the mythology involves exciting stories full of fantastic people and beings, the use of magical powers, often taking place in an exotic mythological place or time. Like many mythologies, Chinese mythology has in the past been believed to be, at least in part, a factual recording of history. Along with Chinese folklore, Chinese mythology forms an important part of Chinese folk religion (Yang et al 2005, 4). Many stories regarding characters and events of the distant past have a double tradition: ones which present a more historicized or euhemerized version and ones which presents a more mythological version (Yang et al 2005, 12‚Äì13). Many myths involve the creation and cosmology of the universe and its deities and inhabitants. Some mythology involves creation myths, the origin of things, people and culture. Some involve the origin of the Chinese state. Some myths present a chronology of prehistoric times, many of these involve a culture hero who taught people how to build houses, or cook, or write, or was the ancestor of an ethnic group or dynastic family. Mythology is intimately related to ritual. Many myths are oral associations with ritual acts, such as dances, ceremonies, and sacrifices. Major sources and concepts Some myths survive in theatrical or literary formats as plays or novels. *Shanhaijing, or Classic of Mountains and Seas *shenmo genre of vernacular fiction revolve around gods and monsters. Important mythological fiction, seen as definitive records of these myths, include: * Verse poetry associated with the ancient state of Chu such as \\"Lisao\\", \\"Jiu Ge\\", and \\"Heavenly Questions\\", contained in the Chuci anthology, traditionally attributed to the authorship of Qu Yuan of Chu * Fengshen Bang (Investiture of the Gods), a mythological fiction dealing with the founding of the Zhou dynasty * Journey to the West attributed to Wu Cheng'en, published in the 1590s; a fictionalized account of the pilgrimage of Xuanzang to India to obtain Buddhist religious texts in which the main character encounters ghosts, monsters, and demons, as well as the Flaming Mountains * Baishe Zhuan, a romantic tale set in Hangzhou involving a female snake who attained human form and fell in love with a man Presiding deities The concept of a principal or presiding deity has fluctuated over time in Chinese mythology. Examples include: *Shangdi, also sometimes Hu√°ngtiƒÅn D√†d√¨ (ÁöáÂ§©Â§ßÂ∏ù), appeared as early as the Shang dynasty. In later eras, he was more commonly referred to as Hu√°ngtiƒÅn Sh√†ngd√¨ (ÁöáÂ§©‰∏äÂ∏ù). The use of Hu√°ngtiƒÅn D√†d√¨ refers to the Jade Emperor and Tian. *Yu Di (the Jade Emperor) appeared in literature after the establishment of Taoism in China; his appearance as Yu Huang dates back to beyond the times of Yellow Emperor, N√ºwa, or Fuxi. *Tian (Heaven) appeared in literature c. 700 BCE, possibly earlier as dating depends on the date of the Shujing (Book of Documents). There are no creation-oriented narratives for Tian. The qualities of Tian and Shangdi appear to have merged in later literature and are now worshiped as one entity (\\"ÁöáÂ§©‰∏äÂ∏ù\\", Hu√°ngtiƒÅn Sh√†ngd√¨) in, for example, the Beijing's Temple of Heaven. *N√ºwa (also referred to as N√º Kwa) appeared in literature no earlier than c. 350 BCE. Her companion, Fuxi, (also called Fu Hsi) was her brother and husband. They are sometimes worshiped as the ultimate ancestor of all humankind, and are often represented as half- snake, half-humans. It is sometimes believed that N√ºwa molded humans from clay for companionship. She repaired the sky after Gong Gong had damaged the pillar supporting the heavens. *Pangu, written about by Taoist author Xu Zheng c. 200 CE, was claimed to be the first sentient being and creator, ‚Äúmaking the heavens and the earth.‚Äù Time periods  Three August Ones and Five Emperors  During or following the age of N√ºwa and Fuxi came the age of the Three August Ones and Five Emperors. These legendary rulers ruled between c. 2850 BCE to 2205 BCE, before the Xia dynasty. These rulers are generally regarded as morally upright and benevolent, examples to be emulated by latter- day kings and emperors. The list of names comprising the Three August Ones and Five Emperors vary widely among sources. One widely circulated and popular version is: *The Three August Ones (Hu√°ng) **Fuxi: companion of N√ºwa **Yellow Emperor (\\"Huang Emperor\\"): often regarded as the first sovereign of the Chinese nation **Shennong (\\"Divine Farmer\\"): reputedly taught the ancients agriculture and medicine *The Five Emperors (D√¨) **Shaohao: leader of the Dongyi (Eastern Barbarians); his pyramidal tomb is in present-day Shandong **Zhuanxu: grandson of the Huang Emperor. **Emperor Ku: great-grandson of the Huang Emperor and nephew of Zhuanxu. **Yao: son of Ku; Yao's elder brother succeeded Ku, but he abdicated when found to be an ineffective ruler. **Shun: the successor of Yao, who passed over his own son and made Shun his successor because of Shun's ability and morality.

She was the first wife of Johann Gottlieb Christaller (1827‚Äì1895), a German missionary, linguist and philologist of the Basel Mission, notable for his leading role in the translation of the entire Holy Bible into the Twi language.  Early life and education  Christiane Emilie Ziegler was born in 1829 in the town of Waiblingen near Stuttgart in the southwest German state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Her parents were Christian Ludwig Ziegler and Rosine K√ºbler, who were described as non-church-going Christians who always prayed at the table. Emilie Ziegler had seven siblings including Pauline (Frau Haefner), Marie (Frau Pfleiderer) and Bertha Ziegler who eventually married J.G. Christaller in 1872 after her sister's death in 1866. Emilie Ziegler's parents permitted her to go to church, in the company of her close friend, Edith, who was the only child of her family. She experienced her first spiritual awakening when she heard a sermon by a Pietist Lutheran missionary who recounted stories about children in Africa who had no access to education and had never heard about the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Emilie Ziegler wished she did not have to go to school too but the preacher's words influenced her decision to become a missionary. In January 1850, Ziegler moved to Basel, Switzerland to become an au pair in the household of a widower, Inspector Hoffman of the Basel Mission. Though she enjoyed her new role in childcare, she was uncomfortable in the Hoffman household because she found its members ‚Äútoo pious for her liking.‚Äù After a few months, her employers moved to a different European city and Ziegler left Basel. She was then sent to Stuttgart to stay with her ageing grandaunt. In her diaries, she described this period as a ‚Äúdifficult time‚Ä¶as her prayers came back to her unanswered and her family failed to understand feelings.‚Äù The family viewed her as a useful helper to her elderly grandaunt. She befriended a cobbler in the vicinity, who introduced her to a Christian fellowship. She enjoyed the company of her new friends. Not long after, her grandaunt passed away and Emilie Ziegler was employed as a storekeeper in Stuttgart.  Marriage proposal, voyage and marriage  Johann Gottlieb Christaller In 1856, Emilie Ziegler received a marriage proposal from a twenty-nine year-old German missionary, Johann Gottlieb Christaller who had been working as a philologist at Akropong on the Gold Coast for about three years. Christaller was born in Winnenden in Baden W√ºrttemberg. Christaller translated the Bible into the Twi language, with the assistance of the Akan linguists, David Asante, Theophilus Opoku, Jonathan Palmer Bekoe and Paul Keteku. Christaller also served as the first editor of the mission's newspaper, Christian Messenger from its founding in 1883 to 1895. The Basel Mission required its missionaries to prove themselves in the field for a minimum of two years before the Home Committee could grant the permission to find a spouse. The marriage request was made through Christaller's sister and the Basel Mission's Inspector Josenhans, with whom Ziegler had stayed with in Basel. A delegation consisting of J. G. Christaller, his sister and one Gustave Rapp went to Stuttgart to ask for Emilie Ziegler's hand in marriage. Per her own account, she fell in love with Christaller at first sight. In November 1856, Emilie Ziegler left her hometown, Waiblingen for Basel, from where she would begin the trip to the Gold Coast. She boarded a London-bound train from Basel. There was a storm at the start of the journey, described as ‚Äúhellish chaos‚Äù and Emilie Ziegler feared the worst. Sensing her worry, a passenger aboard the sailing ship told her, ‚ÄúThere is always help, if not here, then in another world.‚Äù She desired to live and did not want to perish at sea. After several days at sea, the sailors managed to return to safety at the harbour in London. C. E. Ziegler viewed this voyage as her ‚Äúfreedom interval\\". In retrospect, this short stormy period prepared her for the tribulation she would face in the mission field on the Gold Coast. When ship arrived in Sierra Leone, there was a letter from her fianc√©, Johann Christaller, addressed to ‚ÄúGermans coming to Africa.‚Äù She was impressed with his beautiful handwriting. However, she had reservations about the general tone of the letter. Emelie Ziegler finally arrived in Christiansborg (Osu) in Accra, Gold Coast on 22 December 1856 where she was met a Basel missionary, Christoph Wilhelm L√∂cher, who told her, her husband-to-be would meet her later. She also noticed that Osu was in ruins from the 1854 bombardment of town by the British colonial authorities after the indigenes refused to pay the unpopular poll tax. On 27 January 1857, when Christiane Emilie Ziegler was 27 years old, she married Johann Gottlieb Christaller. The wedding ceremony was at Akropong.  Life on the Gold Coast  Christiane Emilie Ziegler Emilie's Christaller's life on the Gold Coast was captured in a book, \\"Die mit Tr√§nen s√§en. Das Leben der Missionarsfrau Emilie Christaller\\" (‚ÄúThose who sow tears: The life of missionary-wife Emilie Christaller‚Äù) authored by her great- granddaughter-in-law, Eva N√∂ldeke and inspired by the Psalmist per the biblical Psalm 126:5. The book's content was sourced from her diaries and letters of correspondence written by her as well as those by her husband. Emelie Christaller found it difficult to acclimatise to her new environment. She was afraid of insects and started drinking her coffee without sugar to avoid ants in her house. She found it difficult to learn the Twi vernacular and her husband, a linguist, told her he was too busy to teach her the language. She found J. G. Christaller to be detached. He was preoccupied with his linguistic work and rarely spent time with her, apart from sharing meals and having evening strolls together. When she voiced any concerns, her husband's response was always to ask her to pray. She learnt to keep her worries to herself and lacked a sense of belonging at Akropong. She wrote letters to her parents when she was homesick. Her parent's response always came after two months, due to the spotty correspondence between West Africa and Europe. She viewed the Basel missionaries at Akropong as having no rights within the rigid mission quarter. She sensed that the English Governor preferred the Wesleyan missionaries to the Basel mission, who he merely tolerated. Together with another missionary-wife, Frau Mader, Emilie Christaller started supervising and teaching at the sewing school. Even though the two women got along very well, she noticed that there were tensions and unhealthy rivalry between their spouses. Her husband remained aloof and refused to answer questions relating to her health, language or even her teaching duties at the school. Some of her requests were met with an order from J. G. Christaller, ‚ÄúDo as I say!‚Äù She felt unloved and effectively lost interest in him. Nonetheless, when she went on an assignment at Abokobi, she began to miss him and realised that despite all their relationship troubles, differing levels of faith and outlooks in life, she still loved him. She was once critically ill with shivering and chills. At night, she could hear her husband and Frau Mader praying feverishly for her while another person, broke into song. She felt much better in the morning. Shortly thereafter, she became pregnant for the first time. As her delivery date approached, she became apprehensive. She asked the local Akropong women what they did during childbirth and they explained the process using hand gestures. As she was returning to her home, she met a local shaman who had healed her. Emilie Christaller looked at and expressed her appreciation without uttering a word. The healer predicted wrongly that the baby would be a girl. Emilie Christaller felt elated but could not tell her husband because she feared his reaction, knowing that he would disapprove her interactions with a fetish priest. In the last months of her first pregnancy, she found it frustrating that her husband's constant response to every problem was ‚ÄúGo on your knees and pray!‚Äù Her belief in faith healing was not as strong as her husband's and sometimes, she just wanted a companion in her husband with whom she could share her fears and worries. She felt more comfortable discussing her problem with the Rev. Meadows, an English Wesleyan missionary she had met at Bathurst, England en route to the Gold Coast. Johann Christaller, surprisingly wrote loving letters to his wife anytime he travelled outside Akropong, which was in contrast his attitude towards her at home.  Return to Europe  Their first child, Erdmann Gottreich Christaller was born on 10 December 1857 at Akropong after which they sailed to Europe for furlough. The voyage to Europe was a difficult one, during which the 25-year old ship captain died. During the stormy journey, her husband prayed incessantly while her own source of comfort was her baby son's grin. The ship eventually docked at Bristol on 19 May 1858. They connected to Basel by train with a transit in London. Overall the Christaller couple had five children in all, four sons and a daughter, including Erdmann Gottreich Christaller, a Protestant pastor and writer, Theodor Benjamin Christaller, \\"Empire\\" school teacher in Cameroon and Hanna Martha Christaller, who wrote \\"Kolonial novellen (Togo)\\". The remaining two children were Paul and Ernest Christaller. On the journey to Europe, Emelie Christaller took along a girl called Anyama, an Akan native and former domestic slave whose freedom the Basel mission had bought from her enslavers. Anyama quickly became homesick and sad. This situation also worried Emelie Christaller as it was her idea to bring Anyama to Europe. While they were in transit in London, she disappeared and was found chatting with a sailor, perhaps asking for directions back to the Gold Coast. Johann Christaller was livid over Anyama's disappearance. When she was eventually found, Emelie Christaller discounted the role of divine providence. Instead, she insisted they thank their hosts, the Waring family. The cordial relationship between Anyama and Emelie Christaller deteriorated after this episode. Furthermore, the Basel Mission's Home Committee's disapproved of any idea to have Anyama stay in Europe. Emelie Christaller privately questioned the Christian values and beliefs of the leaders in Basel who refused to accept an outsider into their community. In her hometown, Waiblingen, the Ziegler family also refused to host Anyama. As a result of the hostile atmosphere, Emelie Christaller realised that it was in Anyama's own interest to return to the Gold Coast. As such, she sailed to West Africa, unaccompanied by any adult from the Basel mission. In 1861, the Christaller family moved from Basel to J.G. Christaller's hometown, Winnenden. A year later in 1862, Johann Christaller returned to the Gold Coast while his wife, Emelie and the children moved back to her parents‚Äô home in Waiblingen. In 1863, Emilie Ziegler returned to the Gold Coast. Three of her children, 6-year-old Gottreich, 4-year old Martha and 3-year old Paul were sent to Basel to live in the boarding house for the children of missionaries. Her 2-year-old son, Ernest, remained with her parents in Waiblingen while her 9-month old baby was cared for by her mother- in-law in Winnenden.  Final years and death  Upon her return to the Gold Coast, she encountered a noticeable change in her husband's attitude. He became more understanding and caring. He made time to have conversations with her about her welfare and health. He also discussed his linguistic abstracts and work in general with her. This time, they lived in Aburi. In 1865, they relocated again to Kyebi. Christiane Emilie Christaller died on 13 August 1866, aged 37, at Kyebi in Akyem Abuakwa. She never saw her children again. Her remains were buried under a palm tree at the old Basel Mission cemetery in Kyebi. After her death, J. G. Christaller married her sister, Bertha Ziegler in 1872. They also had a daughter and four sons.  Literature  * N√∂ldeke, Eva (2002) \\"Die mit Tr√§nen s√§en.

In 1975 Igartua opted to move down to the second tier with Celta (managed by former Athletic goalkeeper Carmelo Cedrun and assisted by Pedrito, the man responsible for the broken leg five years earlier), helping the Galicians win promotion in his first season, although they were relegated in the second. He moved on again, returning to his native Basque Country with Deportivo Alav√©s, where he appeared regularly for four campaigns in the Segunda Divisi√≥n before being forced to retire altogether aged 31 due to Spondylitis. He remained involved in sport despite his physical problems, returning to Basque pelota in which he had been heavily involved in his teens before focusing on football. At the 1986 Basque Pelota World Championships, he won a bronze medal in the Paleta cuero (wooden bat and leather ball) variant of the game.

Its goal is to guide entities, private or public, that are confronted with the fundamental problem of economics.Hoffer, Stefan N. Economic analysis of investment and regulatory decisions: revised guide. 1998. Accessed at This fundamental problem of economics consists of two fundamental questions that must be answered, namely what objectives should be investigated or explored and how should these be achieved? Economics as a social science answers those questions and is defined as the knowledge used for selecting among ‚Äú‚Ä¶technically feasible alternatives for the purpose of a rational allocation of scarce resources.‚Äù Correspondingly, all problems involving \\"...profit-maximizing or cost-minimizing are engineering problems with economic objectives and are properly described by the label \\"engineering economy\\".Billy E. (1959) Engineering Economy‚ÄîTeaching and Practice, The Engineering Economist, 5:2, 1-12, DOI: 10.1080/00137915908965083 Access at As a subdiscipline practiced by civil engineers, engineering economics narrows the definition of the fundamental economic problem and related questions to that of problems related to the investment of capital, public or private in a broad array of infrastructure projects. Civil engineers confront more specialized forms of the fundamental problem in the form of inadequate economic evaluation of engineering projects. Magyar, William B. \\"Economic Evaluation of Engineering Projects.\\" The Engineering Economist 13.2 (1968): 67-86. Civil engineers under constant pressure to deliver infrastructure effectively and efficiently confront complex problems associated with allocating scarce resources for ensuring quality, mitigating risk and controlling project delivery. Civil engineers must be educated to recognize the role played by engineering economics as part of the evaluations occurring at each phase in the project lifecycle. Thus, the application of engineering economics in the practice of civil engineering focuses on the decision-making process, its context, and environment in project execution and delivery.Dharmaraj, E.. Engineering Economics. Mumbai, IN: Himalaya Publishing House, 2009. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 9 November 2016.Morris, W. Thomas. (1960). Engineering economy: the analysis of management decisions. Homewood, Ill.: R. D. Irwin. It is pragmatic by nature, integrating microeconomic theory with civil engineering practice but, it is also a simplified application of economic theory in that it avoids a number of microeconomic concepts such as price determination, competition and supply and demand. This poses new, underlying economic problems of resource allocation for civil engineers in delivering infrastructure projects and specifically, resources for project management, planning and control functions. Civil engineers address these fundamental economic problems using specialized engineering economics knowledge as a framework for continuously ‚Äú‚Ä¶ probing economic feasibility‚Ä¶using a stage-wise approach‚Ä¶‚Äù throughout the project lifecycle. The application of this specialized civil engineering knowledge can be in the form of engineering analyses of life-cycle cost, cost accounting, cost of capital and the economic feasibility of engineering solutions for design, construction and project management. The civil engineer must have the ability to use engineering economy methodologies for the ‚Äúformulation of objectives, specification of alternatives, prediction of outcomes‚Äù and estimation of minimum acceptability for investment and optimization. George L. Peterson (1965) Toward the Improvement of The Traditional Course In Engineering Economy Through Unification As Applied Decision Theory, The Engineering Economist, 10:4, 17-31, DOI: 10.1080/00137916508928726 They must also be capable of integrating these economic considerations into appropriate engineering solutions and management plans that predictably and reliably meet project stakeholder expectations in a sustainable manner. The civil engineering profession provides a special function in our society and economy where investing substantial sums of funding in public infrastructure requires \\"...some assurance that it will perform its intended function.\\" Dingwall, Robert. Essays on professions. Routledge, 2016. Thus, the civil engineer exercising their professional judgment in making decisions about fundamental problems relies upon the profession's knowledge of engineering economics to provide \\"the practical certainty\\" that makes the social investment in public infrastructure feasible. Course of Instruction Historically, coursework and curricula in engineering economics for civil engineers has focused on capital budgeting: \\"...when to replace capital equipment, and which of several alternative investments to make.

Backed with \\"Marcia nuziale\\", De Andr√©'s translation of by Georges Brassens's 1957 song \\"La marche nuptiale\\", it was released in 1970 by the Italian branch of Liberty Records as a standalone single, De Andr√©'s first of only two such releases in his career. Upon release, the song became popular among De Andr√©'s fan base, although it did not have any significant impact on Italian charts. Its popularity was significantly boosted by a 1979 live remake, with PFM backing De Andr√© in a new rock arrangement. Track listing #\\"Il pescatore\\" (De Andr√© [lyrics]/Gian Piero Reverberi-Franco Zauli [music]) ‚Äì 2:19 #\\"Marcia nuziale\\" (Georges Brassens; italian lyrics by De Andr√©) ‚Äì 3:10 The songs \\"Il pescatore\\" One of De Andr√©'s narrative songs, typical of his early production, \\"Il pescatore\\" is about an elderly fisherman, whose peaceful slumber on the shore is interrupted by a convicted killer on the run, approaching him and waking him up, then asking him to break his bread and pour his wine (identifying the fisherman with a Christ-like figure through a passing mention of the Eucharist). Not caring about who the man is but just about the fact that he is hungry and thirsty, the fisherman complies. Later, when two policemen arrive on the beach looking for the killer and wanting to interrogate the fisherman, they find out he has fallen asleep again.Song description based on the commentary by Dennis Criteser, on his blog Fabrizio De Andr√© in English ‚Äì including English translation of De Andr√©'s entire recorded output. The original version of the song features a simple folk/country arrangement, including two acoustic guitars, a double bass, a lap steel guitar, a whistled hook and no drums.  1979 remake  The song was revolutionized and turned into a rousing rock anthem during the famous 1979 concerts held by De Andr√© in Bologna and Florence with the progressive rock band Premiata Forneria Marconi, also known as PFM. The new version, mainly arranged by Franz Di Cioccio, features prominent keyboards, drums, percussion, electric guitars and a country fiddle, played by Lucio Fabbri, while the whistled melody is joyously sung by the entire band as a \\"la-la-la\\" choir. This version is the one De Andr√© kept performing live until his very last show. \\"Marcia nuziale\\" \\"Marcia nuziale\\" [\\"Wedding march\\"] is a very faithful translation of Brassens' original 1957 song \\"La marche nuptiale\\". Following the original writer's dryly ironical style, De Andr√© narrates a fantasy account of his parents' marriage, described as poor, peasant, and plagued by wind and rain. The song is arranged as a semi-classical minuet, built on two acoustic guitars and a double bass. Music video A music video, directed by Stefano Salvati, was produced and released in 2011 for the original version of \\"Il pescatore\\". It is set in Ravenna in a contemporary context; the killer is depicted as a (younger) boatman himself, running from the police in order to be reunited on the boat with his 10-year-old son. The child, in spite of the elder fisherman's insistent gaze on his father, remains happily unaware of everything until the very end, when he discovers a concealed gun inside his father's backpack. An excerpt from PFM's arrangement of the song is featured over the end credits.Stefano Salvati's music video on YouTube.

In an apology, Korey said that she was \\"appalled\\" to read her own messages and listed steps taken to improve the company's work culture in the last year. On December 9, 2019, Korey was to be replaced as CEO of Away by Stuart Haselden. She would continue to serve as Away's executive chairwoman. On January 13, 2020, a New York Times article broke the news that Korey had reversed her decision, and would instead serve as co-CEO along with Haselden. This decision was announced with the support of Away's 4 Board of Directors, only 1 of whom is external to Away. In late June 2020, while on maternity leave, Korey posted several Instagram stories attacking digital media companies. Employees told Haselden and Rubio in an anonymous letter that it showed Korey had learned nothing from the events of December 2019, especially given that her comments were made during Pride and the height of the Black Lives Matter movement.

Early life  Mitchell was born on May 24, 1947, in Modesto, California. Mitchell's father was William Mitchell and her mother was Doris Mitchell.  Education  Mitchell was a National Merit Scholar at Stanford University, where her work included an independent study project on Brillouin scattering in bromine. In 1969, Mitchell graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in physics from Stanford University with distinction and Phi Beta Kappa. She followed in the footsteps of her grandmother, Eulalia Richardson Mitchell, who also earned Stanford physics degrees in 1910 and 1912. Mitchell went on to graduate study in condensed matter physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, and earned a master's degree in 1971 and a Ph.D. in 1974 there. As part of her Ph.D. work, she also learned computer programming, so that she could use a computer to solve the differential equations arising in her research. Her dissertation, Effect of heterovalent impurities co-diffusing with monovalent tracers in ionic crystals, was supervised by David Lazarus. Career and later life Mitchell began working at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in 1974, in the Exploratory Printing Technologies Group. There, her inventions included a method for ultrasonic printing, a method for thermal-transfer printing later used in some models of the IBM Selectric typewriter, data compression for fax machines, a teleconferencing system, and the Q-coder method for arithmetic coding used in JBIG image compression. From 1987 to 1994, Mitchell helped develop the JPEG standard, and she became a co-author with Bill Pennebaker of the first book on the standard. Gregory K. Wallace, another member of the group, remembers Mitchell and Pennebaker as \\"two of the most insightful, energetic, and prolific members\\" of the Joint Photographic Experts Group. During the mid-1990s Mitchell moved from the Watson Research Center to a different IBM group in Vermont and then (after a short leave as a visiting professor at the University of Illinois) to IBM's Printing Systems Division in Colorado. In 2007 IBM sold their Printing Systems Division to Ricoh, and Mitchell went with them to the resulting joint venture, InfoPrint Solutions. She retired in 2009, and died on December 2, 2015. Recognition Mitchell became an IEEE Fellow in 1999 \\"for contributions to the development of international image compression standards\\", an IBM Fellow in 2001, and, in 2004, a member of the National Academy of Engineering \\"for leadership in setting standards for the formation of photographic fax and image compression\\".

His research interests were birds of prey and British avifauna. Biography Swann was initially privately taught. He then attended Roan School in Greenwich, London, and finally had a private tutor in Brighton. His interest in nature and especially in ornithology was awakened in his earliest childhood. At the age of 20, he traveled to the eastern Canadian province of Nova Scotia and in 1895 published an account of his Canadian travels under the title Nature in Acadie in 1895. After returning to England in 1892, he founded the journal The Naturalist's Journal: A Monthly Medium for Collectors and Students, which under the editorship of Seth Lister Mosley (1848-1929) was renamed in 1896 The Naturalist's Journal, and Naturalist's Guide. In this journal, in 1892, Swann's first article, Bird Life on Epsom Common, was published. In 1893 he published the work Birds of London, in which he describes his seven-year ornithological fieldwork in the London District. In 1896 followed A Concise Handbook of British Birds. In the same year he was editor of the fifth edition of Francis Orpen Morris's History of British Birds (a standard reference work), and he oversaw the reissue of Henry Seebohm's British Birds. In the spring of 1896 Swann founded the journal The Ornithologist, which was disestablished after publishing one volume. In 1904 he joined the publishing house Messrs. John Wheldon & Co., which specialized in natural history works and merged in 1921 with the publishing house William Wesley & Sons. During this time, Swann acquired extensive ornithological and bibliographic knowledge. In 1913 Messrs. Witherby and Company published Swann's A Dictionary of English and Folk Names of British Birds. In 1917 he published, together with Major William Herbert Mullens (1866-1946), A Bibliography of British Ornithology , which included biographical accounts of the principal British ornithologists along with bibliographies of their published works. In 1920 Swann became a member of the British Ornithologists' Union. Swann married in 1906; the marriage produced five children. He died on April 14, 1926, aged 55, as a result of surgery at the Barnet Cottage Hospital in London. In 1930 Alexander Wetmore published posthumously the book A Monograph of the Birds of Prey (Order Accipitres), begun by Swann, which is one of the most outstanding standard works on birds of prey in the first half of the 20th century. Among the species described by Swann are Buckley's forest-falcon (Micrastur buckleyi Swann, 1919), the Cape Verde buzzard (1919) and the white-collared kite (1922). He further described sub-species of the African cuckoo-hawk (Aviceda cuculoides batesi, 1920), the collared falconet (Microhierax caerulescens burmanicus, 1920) and the gray-lined hawk (Buteo nitidus costaricensis, 1922).

Cole and EarthGang. The track originally came into fruition after Cole invited EarthGang and JID to his studio, and Hollywood JB played him the beat. The song was later released in full as a Spillage Village single called \\"Can't Call It\\" on November 8, 2016. Spillage Village released their third compilation Bears Like This Too Much on December 2, 2016. It soon proved to be their breakout project as a collective. Outside of the Spillage Village initial five, the album featured only three outside artists: J. Cole, Bas, and Quentin Miller. Production was from a variety of contributors, including Mac Miller, Childish Major, J. Cole, and Hollywood JB. When describing the collective albums, EarthGang said: \\"It's the third part to the saga. We use these \\"Bears\\" projects like checkpoints, markers in time. The first one came out when we first started fucking around with these sounds. The second one came as niggas had toured a little bit, learned a little bit. At this point now, we've been on tours, we've got a lot of other things we've been working on.\\" In 2017, it was announced that JID and EarthGang signed to Dreamville Records. JID, EarthGang, Mereba, 6lack and Hollywood JB all made an appearance on the Dreamville compilation album Revenge of the Dreamers III. 2020: Breakthrough and Spilligion In March 2020, Spillage Village announced their fourth collective album. They also announced the addition of Benji to the group, who is the brother of producer Christo. Benji previously toured with EarthGang on the Welcome to Mirrorland tour, and was invited to work on the album in 2020. Spilligion was released on September 25, 2020, and was supported by three singles: \\"End of Daze\\", \\"Baptize\\", and \\"Hapi\\". The album features guest appearances from Ant Clemons, Ari Lennox, Buddy, Chance the Rapper, Masego, Lucky Daye, and Big Rube. The production was handled primarily by Olu, Benji, Christo, and Hollywood JB, among others. Members * EarthGang * JID * Hollywood JB * Jurdan Bryant * Mereba * 6lack * Benji.

Their successors served as field artillery in Palestine during World War I and as anti-aircraft (AA) gunners in the Middle East in World War II. They continued in the air defence role in the Territorial Army until 1955. Volunteer Force The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Volunteer Corps composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett.Spiers, pp. 163‚Äì8. A number of Artillery Volunteer Corps (AVCs) were quickly formed in Cheshire, and in June 1860 they were brought together into the 1st Administrative Brigade of Cheshire Artillery Volunteer Corps with headquarters (HQ) at Chester and the following organisation:Beckett, Appendix VIII.Frederick, pp. 651‚Äì2.Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 39‚Äì40.Army List, various dates. * 1st (Birkenhead) Cheshire AVC (2 batteries), raised 30 December 1859 at Jackson & Brassey's Canada WorksBeckett, p. 74. * 2nd (Earl of Chester's) Cheshire AVC (1, later 2 batteries), raised in Chester 8 February 1860 * 3rd (Seacombe) Cheshire AVC (1 battery), raised 10 February 1860 * 4th (New Brighton) Cheshire AVC (1 battery), raised 15 February 1860 * 5th (Laird's Iron Works) Cheshire AVC (3 batteries), raised at Birkenhead 1 March 1860 with William Laird junior as Captain Commandant The commanding officer (CO) of the admin brigade was Major, later Lieutenant-Colonel, Henry A. Gray. By November 1863 the following units had also been included in the 1st Cheshire Admin Brigade: * 1st Shropshire AVC * 1st Staffordshire AVC * 1st Worcestershire AVC ‚Äì joined June 1865 These units left in 1866 to form the 1st Staffordshire Admin Brigade, but rejoined in August 1867. They left once more in 1869 to form the 1st Shropshire Admin Brigade. In 1873 another group of AVCs from outside the county joined the 1st Cheshire Admin Brigade: * 1st Anglesey AVC ‚Äì from 1st Anglesey Admin Brigade; disbanded 1875 * 3rd Anglesey AVC ‚Äì from 1st Anglesey Admin Brigade; renamed 2nd Carnarvonshire 1878 * 1st Carnarvonshire AVC ‚Äì from 1st Anglesey Admin Brigade * 1st Isle of Man AVC ‚Äì disbanded 1875 The 1st and 5th Cheshire AVCs were dependent upon low-paid workers from Birkenhead ironworks, and as the numbers who could remain with the Volunteers declined these units were disbanded in 1873 and 1869 respectively. In 1866 the subtitle 'Earl of Chester's' was formally conferred on the 2nd Cheshire AVC (the Earldom of Chester is held by the Prince of Wales). When the Volunteers were consolidated in June 1880, the 1st Admin Brigade became the 2nd Cheshire AVC, taking the number of its senior surviving corps, but within a month this had been changed to 1st Cheshire and Carnarvonshire AVC, with HQ at Chester and the following organisation: * Nos 1, 2 and 3 Companies at Chester ‚Äì from 2nd Cheshire AVC' * No 4 Company at New Brighton ‚Äì from 4th Cheshire AVC * No 5 Company at Seacombe ‚Äì from 3rd Cheshire AVC * Nos 6 and 7 Companies at Bangor ‚Äì from 2nd Carnarvonshire AVC * No 8 Company at Caernarfon ‚Äì 'from 1st Carnarvonshire AVC In 1886 the unit made an unsuccessful application for the subtitle 'Earl of Chester's' to be restored. In 1882 it was assigned to the Lancashire Division of the Royal Artillery, but when the divisional structure was reduced in 1889 it joined the Southern Division. As well as manning fixed coast defence artillery, some of the early Artillery Volunteers manned semi- mobile 'position batteries' of smooth-bore field guns pulled by agricultural horses. But the War Office refused to pay for the upkeep of field guns for Volunteers and they had largely died out in the 1870s. In 1888 the 'position artillery' concept was revived and some Volunteer companies were reorganised as position batteries to work alongside the Volunteer infantry brigades. On 14 July 1892 the 1st Cheshire & Carnarvon Volunteer Artillery were reorganised as 1 position (later 'heavy') battery and 7 garrison companies:Beckett, p. 178.Litchfield & Westlake, p. 6. On 1 June 1899 all the Volunteer artillery units became part of the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA) and with the abolition of the RA's divisional organisation on 1 January 1902 the unit became the 1st Cheshire and Carnarvonshire RGA (Volunteers). The HQ was at County Buildings, Old Prison Yard, Shipgate Street, Chester.Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 4‚Äì6.Chester at Drill Hall Project. In 1904, the Carnavonshire companies were separated to form their own 1st Carnarvonshire RGA (V). Territorial Force When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. part of the 1st Cheshire RGA (V) formed Nos. 5 and 6 Companies of the Lancashire and Cheshire RGA, while the remainder transferred to the Royal Field Artillery (RFA) with the following organisation:Frederick, p. 682.London Gazette, 20 March 1908.Litchfield, p. 31. 15-pounder gun, issued to the Territorial Force. III Welsh Brigade, RFA * HQ at Chester * 1st Cheshire Battery * 2nd Cheshire Battery * 3rd Flintshire Battery * 3rd Welsh Ammunition Column The unit was the third field artillery brigade in the TF's Welsh Division. In 1912 the Flintshire battery was disbanded and replaced by a 3rd Cheshire Bty at Wistaston Road, Crewe, and in 1913 the unit was redesignated Cheshire Brigade, RFA, when the ammunition column was similarly redesignated. The batteries were each issued with four 15-pounder guns.Crewe at Drill Hall Project.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 117‚Äì23.53 (W) Division at Long, Long Trail. World War I Mobilisation After the order to mobilise was received on 4 August 1914, the units of the Welsh Division assembled at their drill halls. The Cheshire Brigade mobilised at Shiplake Street under the command of Lt-Col Frederick Bonnalie, TD, who had been CO since 1906. By 11 August the units had completed their concentration and TF members were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service. Four days later the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. Then on 31 August the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate batteries, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6. 1/1st Cheshire Brigade, RFA 18-pounder preserved at the Imperial War Museum. At the end of August the Welsh Division concentrated at Northampton to continue its training. On 18 November the division was warned for garrison duty in India, but this was cancelled and in December it moved to Cambridge, then to Bedford in May 1915. In July the infantry of the division (now renamed the 53rd (Welsh) Division) embarked for service at Gallipoli, but the divisional artillery remained at Bedford. In October the batteries were re-armed with modern 18-pounder guns and on 8 November they handed over their obsolescent 15-pounders to the 2nd Line, which had just arrived at Bedford.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 83‚Äì90. 53rd (Welsh) Divisional Artillery was now ordered to France to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front. It embarked on 20 November and had concentrated at Pont-Remy by 25 November, from where parties were sent to various divisional artilleries for instruction in front line duties. Meanwhile, after suffering appalling casualties at Gallipoli, 53rd (Welsh) Division had been withdrawn to Egypt to refit. On 30 January 1916 the divisional artillery was ordered to rejoin the rest of the division. The batteries entrained at Pont-Remy, embarked at Marseilles on 3 February and disembarked at Alexandria on 11 February. By 22 February the artillery had rejoined the division at Beni Salama. For the rest of the year the recuperating division was stationed in the Suez Canal defences.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, p. 73. As senior brigade commanding officer, Lt-Col Bonnalie frequently acted as Commander, Royal Artillery (CRA), for 53rd (W) Division in 1915‚Äì16. 4.5-inch howitzer preserved at the Royal Artillery Museum. In May 1916 the TF field brigades were numbered, the Cheshire being designated CCLXVII (267) Brigade, RFA, and the batteries became A, B and C. Then on 25 December 1916 the divisional artillery was reorganised: A Bty of CCLXVII Bde was broken up between B and C Btys (to make them up to six guns each) and they were redesignated A and B; A (H) Bty, equipped with four 4.5-inch howitzers, joined from CCLXV (H) Bde (the old 1st Welsh (Howitzer) Brigade, which was being broken up) and became C (H) Bty, and half of the 1st Welsh Brigade Ammunition Column (BAC) also joined. Finally, CCLXVII Bde took the now-vacant number of the 1st Welsh as CCLXV (265) Brigade, RFA, with the following organisation:Frederick, p. 694.Ward, p. 66. * A Bty (6 x 18-pounders) ‚Äì from 2nd Cheshire Bty + half 1st Cheshire Bty' * B Bty (6 x 18-pounders) ‚Äì from 3rd Cheshire Bty + half 1st Cheshire Bty' * C (H) Bty (4 x 4.5-inch howitzers) ‚Äì from 1st Glamorgan Bty * CCLXV BAC ‚Äì from Cheshire BAC + half 1st Welsh BAC However, 53rd (W) Divisional Ammunition Column had remained in France, and was reformed in Egypt by abolishing the BACs. Palestine 4.5-inch Howitzer with 'ped-rails' (sand tyres) around wheels, as used in crossing Sinai Early in 1917 the Egyptian Expeditionary Force launched the Sinai and Palestine Campaign by crossing the Sinai desert and advancing against Turkish forces at Gaza City. The First Battle of Gaza began during the night of 25/26 March when 53rd (W) Division advanced to cross the Wadi Ghuzzeh, with CCLXV Bde following 160th Infantry Brigade. Despite the darkness and morning fog the infantry were in position by 08.30 and at 10.20 CCLXV Bde had two of its batteries in position and the third moving up. However, the attack orders were late reaching the infantry, and the bombardment did not begin until 12.00, and communication was poor. The artillery was supposed to be under divisional control, but heard nothing, and had to work through the infantry brigade HQs, who complained that the Forward Observation Officers (FOOs) could not be found. There was a shortage of telephone cable, and the FOO for B/CCLXV Bty reported that having followed the advancing 2/10th Battalion Middlesex Regiment and called down fire on 'The Labyrinth', he came to the end of his cable and although he went forward with the infantry he had trouble passing message back to his signaller stationed at the cable's end. Meanwhile, the battery had to shift its position six times during the day, laboriously crossing numerous wadis, but still fired 1511 rounds. The division's attack went well, but the artillery fire was too weak until reinforcements arrived from 54th (East Anglian) Division. The gunners were then able to subdue enemy machine guns on Clay Hill, while 160th Bde captured The Labyrinth. The division took all its objectives and its troops were in the eastern streets of Gaza when the attack was stopped for lack of water. Although 53rd (W) Division consolidated its position, it was withdrawn the following day.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 81‚Äì4.MacMunn & Falls, Vol I, pp. 286‚Äì97, 301‚Äì3, 310‚Äì5.Ward, pp. 83‚Äì5, 90. 18-pounder gun in Sinai. For the Second Battle of Gaza, beginning on 17 April, 53rd (W) Division's role was to advance up the coast across Wadi Ghuzzeh, and then attack Gaza after an artillery bombardment. The bombardment was begun by the heavy artillery and warships offshore, then the 4.5-inch howitzers began firing gas shells against Turkish batteries. At 07.20, 10 minutes before Zero, the 18-pounders began engaging the objectives. The infantry attacked punctually at 07.30 and 53rd (W) Division captured Samson's Ridge. However, it could not push on because the neighbouring division was badly held up and the artillery fire was too weak. Casualties had been high and gains minimal, and the EEF dug in for a summer of trench warfare.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 87‚Äì9.MacMunn & Falls, Vol I, pp. 335‚Äì7, 343, 348.Ward, pp. 105‚Äì9. 18-pounder with sand wheels. Although the War Office was unable to provide more divisions for the EEF, it could send guns: 53rd (W) Division's batteries were temporarily brought up to a strength of eight rather than six guns, until further troops arrived.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 90‚Äì1, 93. The reorganised EEF renewed its offensive (the Third Battle of Gaza) on 27 October. XX Corps, including 53rd (W) Divisional artillery, moved into position during the night of 30/31 October to capture Beersheba, and the bombardment began at 05.55. After a pause at 07.00 to let the dust settle and determine the effect, the guns reopened. Infantry parties advanced to within of the barrage to finish cutting the barbed wire. They then rushed Point 1069 and the 18-pounder batteries began to move up to more advanced positions. Beersheba had fallen to the Desert Column and XX Corps could bivouack on the objective.Falls, Vol II, pp. 44‚Äì7.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 98‚Äì9. On 3 November 53rd (W) Division was ordered to advance to the Tel es Sheria road. The left column consisted of 159th (Cheshire) Brigade and CCLXV Bde under Lt-Col James Walker. It was a difficult march over broken country in hot weather and there were several sharp actions with enemy detachments, though most casualties came from enemy shellfire. Over following days 53rd (W) Division kept up pressure on the enemy in the hills so that the EEF could roll up the main trench lines (the Battle of Hareira and Sheria). Then on 6 November the division assaulted the Khuweilfe position supported by an intense bombardment by all its own guns and a heavy battery. During the night CCLXV Bde (less one battery) had been brought round from the left of the division to the right to reinforce the artillery support for 158th Bde, which was all put under the command of Lt-Col Walker. The night move was extremely difficult, the rough country forcing each gun had to be double-teamed with horses and manhandled as well. There was no time to reconnoitre battery positions or register the guns: the guns were simply dragged up the hill and lined up alongside batteries that had already registered. After confused fighting the position was held, with the support of the divisional artillery breaking up Turkish counter-attacks. After the battle the gunners were allowed up Khuweife to see what they had achieved.Falls, Vol II, pp. 84‚Äì7, 94.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 104‚Äì5.Ward, pp. 127‚Äì37. After breaking through the Gaza positions, the EEF pressed on to Jerusalem in appalling weather. The city was to be captured by XX Corps after a rapid advance by a flying column known as 'Mott's Detachment' that included 53rd (W) Division. The batteries of CCLXV and CCLXVI Bdes moved up in bounds, covering the flanks of the advance. At 07.00 on 7 December, as the preliminary attacks began, a few ranging shots by C Bty of CCLXV Bde scattered a body of enemy cavalry at Sherife, a position that would have been troublesome if the Turks had held it. Jerusalem fell the following day, but there was still heavy fighting to the end of the year as the Turks threw in counter-attacks. On 21 December 160th Bde put in a full-scale attack on El Zamby and White Hill to improve its position, advancing behind a lifting barrage put down by CCVXV and CCLXVI Bdes from 05.15. When the attack was held up the fireplan was rearranged with an 18-pounder concentration on El Zamby from 07.20 to 07.40, when 2/4th Battalion Queen's Regiment assaulted again. The position was held against several Turkish counter-attacks, with heavy ammunition expenditure by the gunners.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 113‚Äì6.Falls, Vol II, pp. 238‚Äì44. 250‚Äì1, 281‚Äì2.Ward, pp. 151, 167‚Äì9. XX Corps renewed its advance in March 1918, 53rd(W) Division pushing forward a little on 2 March, then again on 6 March against only slight opposition, before the whole Corps advanced on 8 March. 53rd (W) Division's main objective was the hill of Tell 'Asur, and it was supported by plentiful artillery as well as its own brigades. The peak was taken, lost, and retaken, followed by four more Turkish counter-attacks. That night the division also took Chipp Hill, which had defied the neighbouring division during daylight, but on 10 March found the wadi in front too steep to climb, only passing over it during darkness on 12 March. The new line was held through the summer months.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 113.Falls, Vol II, pp. 312‚Äì21. In the summer of 1918 the 53rd Division was 'Indianised', with three-quarters of the infantry battalions replaced by others drawn from the British Indian Army, but this did not affect the divisional artillery, which retained its composition to the end of the war.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, p. 124. At the climactic Battle of Megiddo 53rd (W) Division attacked late on the first day (18 September), after a 20-minute bombardment. The sound of the infantry's approach march had previously been drowned by slow shellfire on Keen's Hill. The gunners then fired smoke shells to guide the infantry's advance in the moonlight. One Turkish position held out, and a new attack was arranged for 19 November, with Lt-Col Walker of CCLXV Bde arranging the artillery support. During the afternoon a party of Turks was found eating lunch in the open, and every field gun in range was called in to destroy them. When the attack went in at 19.00 it was completely successful, the main enemy position was taken and the guns could move forward with A/CCLXV Bty in the lead. The pressure was kept up on 20 September, and when 158th Bde advanced at 23.00 it found the Turks had retired, and continued advancing through the night until 05.30 on 21 September when it found the road blocked. The roads were very bad, and the Royal Engineers struggled to make a path for the guns, but the artillery closed up behind 158th Bde and watered their horses. At dawn a Turkish column was seen taking up position on the El Tuwanik ridge: this magnificent target was out of range of the guns, even if the horse teams could have been brought up to push further forward. The advance continued at 08.30 and by 15.00 the infantry had taken El Tuwanik. By the end of the next day the Turkish army was shattered, and a general advance was ordered.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 129‚Äì34.Ward, pp. 232‚Äì43. After the battle the division was withdrawn to Alexandria before the Armistice of Mudros came into effect on 31 October. Demobilisation began on 20 December and was completed in June 1919. CCLXV Brigade was placed in suspended animation. 2/1st Cheshire Brigade, RFA French De Bange 90 mm gun Although formation of the 2nd Line units began in September 1914, the 2nd Welsh Division (68th (2nd Welsh) Division from August 1915) did not concentrate at Northampton until April 1915, moving in the summer to replace the 53rd (Welsh) Division at Bedford. Training of the units was made difficult by the lack of arms and equipment, and the requirement to provide drafts to the 1st Line overseas. At the end of May 2/1st Cheshire Brigade sent two officers and 106 other ranks to help form the 53rd Divisional Ammunition Column. In June the first saddlery and horses began to arrive, but no guns until August, when the brigade received four French De Bange 90 mm guns. Some ammunition wagons arrived in September, and eight more 90 mm guns in October. Training began to speed up, with the 90 mm guns standing in for 15-pounders. In November they were handed in, and the brigade moved to Bedford to take over the 15-pounders from the 1st Line. In December 1915 these, in turn, were replaced by modern 18-pounders. 68th (2nd Welsh) Division had been assigned a role in Home Defence in November when it joined First Army (Home Forces) in Central Force, with its units quartered across Eastern England. In May 1916 the brigade was numbered CCCXLII (342nd) Brigade and the batteries became A, B and C. Later, A (H) Bty from CCCXL (2/I Welsh) (Howitzer) Bde joined and became D (H) Bty. In May 1917 the division transferred to Northern Army (Home Forces), and remained in Norfolk and Suffolk until the end of the war. CCCXLII Brigade was disbanded in 1919. Interwar Stockport Armoury today. After the war the Cheshire Brigade was reconstituted in 1920, incorporating the former 6th Battalion, Cheshire Regiment, at Stockport and the Shropshire Royal Horse Artillery at Shrewsbury to form the 6th (Cheshire and Shropshire) Medium Brigade, RGA. The TF was reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1921, and the unit was redesignated as 60th (6th Cheshire and Shropshire) Medium Brigade, RGA (RA from 1924 when the RGA was subsumed into the Royal Artillery), with the following organisation:Frederick, pp. 723, 735.Litchfield, p. 205.Shropshire RHA at Shropshire Regimental Museum.Titles and Designations, 1927. * HQ at The Armoury, StockportStockport at Drill Hall Project. * 237 (Cheshire) Med Bty at Stockport * 238 (Cheshire) Med Bty (Howitzer) at Stockport * 239 (Cheshire) Med Bty (Howitzer) at Walmsley Street, StalybridgeStalybridge at Drill Hall Project. * 240 (Shropshire) Medium Bty (Howitzer) at Coleham, ShrewsburySrewsbury at Drill Hall Project. The unit was part of 'Army Troops' in the 42nd (East Lancashire) Divisional Area. 240 (Shropshire) Med Bty gained the subtitle '(Shropshire RHA)' in 1927. The 1st Cheshire RGA Cadet Corps was affiliated with the brigade. 81st Anti-Aircraft Brigade, RA In the late 1930s the need for improved anti-aircraft (AA) defences for Britain's cities became apparent, and a programme of converting existing TA units was pushed forward. In 1938 the Shropshire RHA battery was transferred to 51st (Midland) Medium Regiment while the Cheshire batteries reorganised as 81st Anti-Aircraft Regiment:Frederick, pp. 756‚Äì9, 775.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files.81 HAA Rgt at RA 1939‚Äì45. * Regimental HQ at Stockport * 253 (Cheshire) AA Bty at Stockport * 254 (Cheshire) AA Bty at Stockport * 255 (Cheshire) AA Bty at Stalybridge World War II Mobilisation 3-inch HAA gun of AA Command, 1940. The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62‚Äì3. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. Phoney War 4 AA Division's insignia. 81st AA Regiment came under the command of 44th Anti-Aircraft Brigade based at Manchester and forming part of 4th Anti-Aircraft Division.44 AA Bde War Diary, 1939‚Äì41, The National Archives (TNA), Kew file WO 166/2282.Routledge, Table LX, p. 378. The regiment initially manned two heavy AA battery sites equipped with 3-inch guns (253 AA Bty at Site J with two, 254 AA Bty at Site L with four) and also deployed 15 Lewis guns as light AA cover for the Metropolitan-Vickers factory at Trafford Park. By early November, 254 AA Bty was manning 32 Lewis guns at Metropolitan- Vickers, 253 AA Bty was at the Armoury at Stockport, and 255 AA Bty was detached to 34 (South Midland) AA Bde at Coventry. Despite alarms and occasional overflights by presumed enemy aircraft, there was no action during this Phoney War period. Orkney & Shetland Defences Remains of an HAA emplacement at Lyrawa Hill, Orkney. In June 1940, the Royal Artillery's AA Regiments were redesignated Heavy AA (HAA) to distinguish them from the new Light AA (LAA) regiments being formed. 81st HAA Regiment had left 44 AA Bde by now, and gone to the Orkneys to join Orkey and Shetland Defences (OSDEF) protecting the Royal Navy anchorage at Scapa Flow. As well as its own batteries, the regiment had 226 (Caithness and Orkney) HAA Bty under its command while the rest of the battery's parent regiment (101st HAA Rgt) was stationed in Shetland.Organization of the Field Force in the United Kingdom and Order of Battle, Part 12, Orkney and Shetland Defences, 1940, [TNA file WO 212/114.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex D.OSDEF 1940 at RA 1939‚Äì45.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/79 The regiment sent a cadre of experienced officers and men to 211th HAA Training Rgt at Oswestry where they provided the basis for 416 HAA Bty formed on 16 January 1941. This new battery joined the regiment on 10 April 1941. Later the regiment supplied another cadre to 211th HAA Training Rgt, which formed 461 HAA Bty on 10 July 1941; once trained this battery joined a newly-formed 134th HAA Rgt. A further cadre went to form 547 (Mixed) HAA Bty at 206th HAA Training Rgt, Arborfield, on 19 March 1942; this joined 135th (Mixed) HAA Rgt. ('Mixed' units were those into which women from the Auxiliary Territorial Service were integrated.)Frederick, pp. 785‚Äì6. Middle East 3.7-inch HAA gun in North Africa 81st HAA Regiment remained in OSDEF until June 1941. It returned to 44 AA Bde at Manchester, but was transferred to a new 70 AA Bde within 4 AA Division during the summer. As the flow of new AA units from the training centres continued, experienced units began to be prepared for overseas service, and 81st HAA was one of these. The regiment left 70 AA Bde and AA Command in April 1942, coming under War Office control preparatory to embarking in June. 416 HAA Battery left on 10 July 1942 and joined 115th HAA Rgt.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/80.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional units), 2 April 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/515. The regiment was part of a steady flow of AA reinforcements for Middle East Forces in the months before the Second Battle of El Alamein. The regiment with 24 x 3.7-inch guns joined a newly- arrived 21 AA Bde in defending the vital bases of Cairo, Port Said, Suez and the Suez Canal. It remained on this duty until June 1944.Joslen, p. 484.Routledge, p. 154; Table XXIV, p. 163; Table XXV, p. 164. By then the air threat to the Middle East bases had diminished and AA manpower was bring diverted to other tasks. 21 AA Brigade and 81st HAA Rgt were concentrated pending disbandment Routledge, pp. 160‚Äì1; Table XXVI, p. 165. The regiment was placed in suspended animation on 30 August 1944. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947, the regiment was reformed as 360th (Mobile) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment. It formed part of 59 AA Bde (the prewar 33 (Western) AA Bde) at Liverpool.Frederick, pp. 1005, 1007.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex M.Watson, TA 1947.Litchfield, Appendix 5.30‚Äì67 AA Bdes at British Army 1945 onwards.Routledge, Table LXXIV, p. 441. AA Command was disbanded on 10 March 1955, and there were wholesale mergers among TA AA units. 360th HAA Regiment amalgamated with 310th (Manchester), 465th (Manchester), 574th (7th Bn Lancashire Fusiliers) and 606th (East Lancashire) HAA Rgts to form a new 314th HAA Rgt with its HQ at Manchester. 360th HAA Regiment formed R (Stockport) Bty in the new regiment. On 1 May 1961, most of 314 Rgt merged into 252 (Manchester Artillery) Field Rgt, with R (Stockport) Bty continuing as R Bty in that regiment. When the TA was reduced into the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve in 1967, 252 Fd Rgt formed 209 (The Manchester Artillery) Light Air Defence Bty in 103 (Lancashire Artillery Volunteers) Light AD Rgt, ending the Cheshire lineage.Frederick, p. 997.

Early life and cricket Cochrane was born at Dublin to Sir Henry Cochrane and his wife, Margaret Gilchrist. He studied at St Columba's College, Dublin, before going up to Trinity College, Dublin, where he was a member of the Dublin University Cricket Club. Cochrane's father, had alongside Dr. Thomas Joseph Cantrell, invented ginger ale and made a fortune exporting it to the United States. Upon the death of his father in 1904, Cochrane inherited his millions and the Woodbrook Estate. He worked to bring regular top-class cricket to Ireland, even paying the Australians ¬£300 (the equivalent of nearly ¬£37,000 in 2017) to play Dublin University in 1905. Shortly thereafter, he founded the Woodbrook Cricket Club and built a cricket ground on his estate, even constructing a railway station on the Harcourt Street railway line to serve the ground. Using his wealth, Cochrane enticed many of the leading players of the day to play for the club, including the likes of Ranjitsinhji and C. B. Fry. Cochrane was the High Sheriff of Wicklow in 1911, and was the High Sheriff of County Dublin in 1912. Attendances at the Cochrane's cricket ground were less than intended, so in 1912 he invited the touring South Africans to play a first-class match there to encourage patronage, with Cochrane playing in the Woodbrook Club and Ground XI. Playing in what would be his only appearance in first-class cricket, Cochrane batted once in the match, scoring 5 runs before being dismissed by Herbie Taylor. Cochrane attempted to get the deciding Test match of the 1912 Triangular Tournament between England and Australia to be played at Woodbrook, but this request was denied by both boards. Disenchanted by this decision, he closed the cricket ground in 1913 and opted to construct a golf course. War service and later life He served in the British Army during World War I, serving in the Royal Dublin Fusiliers. He was made 1st Barnonet of Woodbrook in February 1915, for services to sports, music and the welfare of prisoners of war. By wars end he held the rank of Captain. He was a Justice of the Peace for both County Wicklow and County Dublin. Cochrane was diagnosed with diabetes in the 1920s and was one of the first people to be treated for the condition with insulin. With a strong interest in music, Cochrane had transformed the indoor cricket school on his estate into an opera house, and alongside Michele Esposito he founded music publisher C&E; Editions. The company folded in 1929. Cochrane died without issue in October 1949 at Bray, with his baronetcy becoming extinct.

In 1946 he moved to Milan where he concluded his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts of Brera with the guidance of Aldo Carpi and Eva Thea and he wins the Hayez prize. In 1950 he moved to Paris where he attended the Academie des Beaux Art with the guidance of Leger and befriended Gino Severini. In 1952 he moved back to Milan and wrote a manifesto about the diatribe between abstractionism and socialist realism during the Bergamini gallery exhibition, His artistic ideas did not lose out to jolts or trends, but within the figurative trend the maturation of his style remained faithful to his ideas. This coherence includes experimentations with other materials such as glass, that he worked with in 1953/54, collaborating with the architects Terzaghi and Magnaghi or the ceramics in 1956/60. He then perfected his engraving technique with his friend Rino Cervi. From 1945 to 1986 he exposed his works in numerous galleries in Italy and abroad. He died in 1993.

Filmed over a period of five years, it tells the story of the O'Donnell family in Derry. Their older son Philly had received a punishment shooting from a paramilitary group. His mother had helped organise it to prevent a worse fate happening to him. The film explores the effects and ramifications of this, along with the sociopolitical background of The Troubles in Ireland and how communities remain affected after the Good Friday Agreement.  Synopsis  The film mostly takes place in Creggan, a housing estate in Derry. Filming began in 2012, after Philly O'Donnell had received a punishment shooting, allegedly for drug dealing. The family is part of a dissident community where paramilitary offshoots of the IRA are active, police and governmental help is rejected, and problems are \\"dealt with\\" from within. It opens with Kevin Barry, Philly's younger brother, showing off an array of weaponry and describing how they would be used. Philly is \\"banished\\" from Derry and briefly lives in Belfast, before returning to his mother's home despite growing death threats against him. The film also covers Hugh Brady, a former paramilitary member who now acts as an intermediary between families and paramilitaries to try to resolve conflicts without violence. Brady attempts to negotiate for Philly's safety in Creggan, and also arranges for O'Shea to meet some active paramilitary members. Over the course of the film Kevin Barry becomes more disruptive at school, and eventually drops out. Brady says \\"a fright\\" may scare him straight; Kevin Barry responds that men with AK-47s at his door at the age of 9 were fright enough. The film closes with Philly O'Donnell senior returning from prison. In their final interview Majella, the mother, describes it as a \\"good year\\" for the family, as they've been reunited with each other and Philly junior has settled down with his partner and has a baby on the way. However, captions at the film's closing reveal that Philly senior received a punishment shooting several weeks after the end of filming, and notes that more people have committed suicide after the Troubles than died during the fighting over the same period.  Reception  The film premiered in the UK on October 13, 2017 at the London Film Festival, and has gone on to be shown at film festivals around the world. The Guardian described it as a \\"stark look at the violent, self-policing community that rules Creggan\\" and \\"a good story\\", but noted \\"there‚Äôs never the sense that she has a real stake in this community as the tone of the reportage wavers between personal and journalistic.\\" The Hollywood Reporter said the film would \\"open eyes for Stateside viewers who'd like to believe the Troubles ended two decades ago with the Good Friday Agreement\\", also noting there was \\"room for improvement\\".

The freshness of his lyrical poetry places him in the succession of Branko Radiƒçeviƒá and he is also noted for his power of natural description. He translated Goethe, Schiller and Heine into Serbian, and his own poems into German. Biography Jovan Grƒçiƒá was born in the village of ƒåereviƒá in the municipality of Beoƒçin in Srem, Vojvodina as the oldest of three children (Jovan, Djordje and Katica) of Todor and Ana Grcki, who were of mixed Serbian and Vlach origin. His father Todor, a merchant, died young (1850), leaving his wife to raise the children. Jovan was educated in Serbian in ƒåereviƒá, and in German in Petrovaradin, Szeged and Pozun. In 1863 Jovan Grƒçiƒá began his brief but sensational career as a lyric poet. For a span of five years he wrote five books of poems and three short stories. He began with \\"Ne boj mi se\\" (Fear me not), a poem which appeared in the literary periodical Danica in 1863. He was a regular contributor with translations from German from 1864 to 1867. Instead of proceeding to the university, he went to visit his parents back home, in ƒåereviƒá. There he fell in love with the young Milena Stefanoviƒá, and through her parents he became acquainted with physician and poet Jovan Jovanoviƒá Zmaj, Milan Kujund≈æiƒá-Aberdar, Laza Kostiƒá and other men of letters of the time. Milena Stefanoviƒá died suddenly at the age of 16, while Jovan was away preparing for his medical studies in Pozun. Shocked and horrified by Milena's sudden death, he began seriously writing poems, dedicating an entire cycle of poems to her memory. He wrote: \\"From your name 'Mileno' .... I baptize myself 'Milenko'.\\" He would eventually change his surname Grƒçki to Grƒçiƒá and add his first love's name to his. It was from then on that he was known as - Jovan Grƒçiƒá-Milenko. In 1867 he moved from Pozun to Vienna, to continue his medical studies at the University of Vienna's School of Medicine. There he became seriously ill and had to drop out before graduating. In 1873 he returned to his native village of ƒåereviƒá, but tuberculosis progressed so much so that Abbot German, a friend of the family, intervened and took Jovan to Beoƒçin monastery, where he could receive better care in the monastery clinic than at home. He died in the Beoƒçin monastery in Fruska Gora on 25 May 1875 at the age of 29. He was buried near the entrance of the monastery. The funeral was attended by his medical colleagues, Jovan Jovanoviƒá Zmaj, Ilija Ognjenoviƒá-Abukazem, Lazar Stanojeviƒá and other. Prose and influences He is better known for his lyrical poetry than his prose, however, having left us only three but extremely well-written short stories with fantastic elements which need to be looked at. They are: U gostionici kod Poluzvezde na imendanu ≈°antavog torbara (1868); Sremska ru≈æa (1868-1869); and Zmijina ko≈°uljica (Matica, 1868). All three short stories were printed and distributed by the publishing house of Matica srpska in Novi Sad under the supervision of Antonije Had≈æiƒá. Analyzing the fantastic stories of Jovan Grƒçiƒá-Milenko with reference to Nikolai Gogol and E. T. A. Hoffmann. The similarity between Gogol and Grcic is not an essential one. It originates from the imperative of time and the political orientation of Grƒçiƒá Milenko and especially from the use of similar sources: folk fantastic and folk beliefs. The similarities between Grƒçiƒá and Hoffmann is more general. It cannot be seen at once, but many components of the fantastic are common to both writers. These are: the protagonists feeling being cut off from the others and being exceptional, the feeling of foreboding, and complete interaction between the plot, the main hero and nature. These similarities are not found in single parts of stories but throughout the narrative. Legacy Elementary school Jovan Grƒçiƒá Milenko, Beoƒçin He has been calles a \\"Nightingale of Fru≈°ka Gora\\", for his lyrical work. A selection of his work has been included in various anthologies and literary histories, such as Anthology of Modern Serbian Lyric. A school in his hometown is named after him.

It is known only from what has sometimes been estimated to be the largest dinosaur specimen ever discovered, originally named Amphicoelias fragillimus. Based on surviving descriptions of a single fossil bone, scientists have produced numerous size estimates over the years; the largest estimate M. fragillimus to have been the longest known animal at in length and with a mass of . However, because the only fossil remains were lost at some point after being studied and described in the 1870s, evidence survived only in drawings and field notes. More recent studies have made a number of suggestions regarding the possibility of such an animal. One analysis of the surviving evidence, and the biological plausibility of such a large land animal, has suggested that the enormous size of this animal were over-estimates due partly to typographical errors in the original 1878 description. More recently, it was suggested by paleontologist Kenneth Carpenter that the species is a rebbachisaurid, rather than a diplodocid sauropod. He therefore used Limaysaurus instead of Diplodocus as a basis for size estimates. This resulted in a smaller, animal, and he dismissed the idea that there must have been typographical errors. History of study Original description Illustration of M. fragillimus fossils, 1884 The holotype and only known specimen of Maraapunisaurus fragillimus was collected by Oramel William Lucas, shortly after he had been hired as a fossil collector by the renowned paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope, in 1877. Lucas discovered a partial vertebra (the neural arch including the spine) of a new sauropod species in Garden Park, north of Ca√±on City, Colorado, close to the quarry that yielded the first specimens of Camarasaurus. The vertebra was in poor condition, but astonishingly large. The preserved parts perhaps measured in height; its original height might have been so tall as .Carpenter, K. (2006). \\"Biggest of the big: a critical re-evaluation of the mega-sauropod Amphicoelias fragillimus.\\" In Foster, J.R. and Lucas, S.G., eds., 2006, Paleontology and Geology of the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation. New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin 36: 131‚Äì138. Lucas sent the specimen to Cope's house in Philadelphia in the spring or early summer of 1878, and Cope published it as the holotype specimen of a new species in the genus Amphicoelias, A. fragillimus, that August.McIntosh, J.S. (1998) \\"New information about the Cope collection of sauropods from Garden Park, Colorado.\\" In Carpenter, K., Chure, D. and Kirkland, J.I., eds., The Morrison Formation: an interdisciplinary study: Modern Geology, 23: 481‚Äì506. In addition to this vertebra, Cope's 1879 field notes contain an entry for an \\"[i]mmense distal end of femur‚Äù, located only a few tens of meters away from the giant vertebra. This specimen was never formally referred to the species. Maraapunisaurus means 'huge reptile' based on maraapuni, the Southern Ute for 'huge'. The specific name was chosen to express that the fossil was \\"very fragile\\", referring to the delicateness of the bone produced by very thin laminae (vertebral ridges). In 1902, Oliver Perry Hay corrected the name to the Latin fragilissimus,Hay, Oliver Perry, 1902, Bibliography and Catalogue of the Fossil Vertebrata of North America, Governmental Printing Office, 868 pp but such emendations are not allowed by the ICZN (International Code of Zoological Nomenclature). As revealed in Cope's notebooks, which he recorded based on Lucas' report on excavation site locations in 1879, the specimen came from a hill south of the Camarasaurus quarry now known as \\"Cope's Nipple\\", also sometimes known simply as \\"the Nipple\\" or \\"Saurian Hill\\". Disappearance of the specimen and quarry Edward Drinker Cope was the only paleontologist to study M. fragillimus before its only known specimen disappeared The gigantic vertebra has often been ignored in summaries of the largest dinosaurs partly because, according to subsequent reports, the whereabouts of both the vertebra and the femur are unknown, and all attempts to locate them have failed. Kenneth Carpenter, in 2006, presented a possible scenario for the disappearance of the specimen. As Cope noted in his description, the neural arch bone material was very fragile, and techniques to harden and preserve fossil bone had not yet been invented (Cope's rival, paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh, was the first to use such resins, in the early 1880s). Carpenter observed that the fossil bones known from the quarry would have been preserved in deeply weathered mudstone, which tends to crumble easily and fragment into small, irregular cubes. Therefore, the bone may have crumbled badly and been discarded by Cope soon after he illustrated it in rear view for his paper. Carpenter suggested that this may explain why Cope drew the vertebra in only one view, rather than from multiple angles as he did for his other discoveries. In 2018, Carpenter recounted how Cope's collections were after his death sold to the American Museum of Natural History in 1897. While cataloging them, William Diller Matthew was unable to locate many important pieces, among them the holotype of A. fragillimus. Because of the possibility that it would turn up eventually, it was given the catalog number AMNH 5777. In 1994, an attempt was made to relocate the original quarry where the species and others had been found, using ground-penetrating radar in an attempt to image bones still buried in the ground. This attempt failed because the fossilized mudstone bones were the same density as the surrounding rock, making it impossible to differentiate between the two. A study of the local topography also showed that the fossil-bearing rock strata were severely eroded, and probably were so when Lucas discovered M. fragillimus, suggesting that a majority of the skeleton had already disappeared when the vertebra was recovered. Modern interpretations Sculpture in Poland showing Maraapunisaurus as a diplodocid The giant proportions of the vertebra have been debated by paleontologists. Carpenter has argued that there is every reason to take Cope at his word, noting that the paleontologist's reputation was at stake. The discovery took place during the Bone Wars, and Cope's rival Marsh, who was \\"ever ready to humiliate\\" Cope, never called the claims into question. Marsh was known to have employed spies to monitor Cope's discoveries, and may have even had confirmation of the enormous size of the bones. Paleontologists Henry Fairfield Osborn and C.C. Mook in 1921, as well as John S. McIntosh in 1998, also accepted Cope's data without question in published reviews. Other paleontologists have been more critical. In a 2015 analysis of the evidence and circumstances surrounding the publication and interpretation of the discovery, Cary Woodruff and John R. Foster concluded that the vertebra's size has been over-estimated and that modern paleontologists were accepting Cope's interpretation without due skepticism. They note that no comparably gigantic sauropod fossils have been discovered in the Morrison Formation or elsewhere, that 19th century paleontologists - including Cope himself - paid no attention to the size of fossil (even when it may have substantiated Cope's rule of size increase in animal lineages over time), and that typographical errors in his measurements - such as reporting vertebral measurements in meters rather than millimeters - undermine their reliability. It was suggested that the real height of the preserved specimen was just . They concluded that the super-gigantic M. fragillimus is a \\"highly unlikely\\" creature based on unquestioning interpretation of Cope's report. Reconstruction of the holotype vertebra In 2018, Carpenter once again defended the original measurements given by Cope in a paper re-describing the species based on Cope's illustration and description. The argument of a typographical error pointed to Cope's use of the abbreviation \\"m\\" rather than \\"mm\\" for millimeters, the same as used for meters, but Carpenter points out a capital \\"M\\" is used for meters, and that this was a standard method of abbreviation in the time period. In addition to this, he pointed to the communication between Lucas and Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden, a survey geologist, where the large size was repeated without question. Lucas also often made his own specific measurements and annotated drawings of his fossils, so Carpenter considers it unlikely he would have been merely re-stating what Cope had said. Later, in 1880, Lucas included specific mention of the specimen in his autobiography, noting \\"[w]hat a monster the animal must have been,\\" refuting the idea that no attention was given to the importance of the vertebra. Carpenter was critical of the typographical theory, saying: \\"It is unfortunate that they seek to disprove Cope‚Äôs claim by casting aspersions about the quality of his work and go so far as to alter Cope‚Äôs measurements.\\" Upon studying the drawing of the specimen again, Carpenter found that it bore a strong resemblance to the vertebrae of rebbachisaurid diplodocoids; previously it had been allied with the type species of Amphicoelias, A. altus, as a diplodocid or primitive diplodocoid. Considering it to be a rebbachisaurid upon his re-examination, the species could not be referred to the genus Amphicoelias, and so he gave it a new generic name, Maraapunisaurus. Apparently, Carpenter was inspired by work of paleontology enthusiasts posted on the website DeviantArt; one user, Zachary Armstrong, known as \\"palaeozoologist\\" on the website, correctly predicted the classification in 2014, four years before Carpenter confirmed it. He is credited in the acknowledgements of the paper. Naming a genus based on a lost specimen is rare, but he pointed out that the ICZN explicitly allows it, and the genus Nopcsaspondylus had been named in a similar fashion. The generic name is derived from the Southern Ute word \\"Ma-ra-pu-ni\\", meaning \\"huge\\", and the Latinised Greek saurus, meaning reptile. The name was suggested to Carpenter by the Southern Ute Cultural Department, based in Ignacio, Colorado. Description Size Skeletal reconstruction of Maraapunisaurus as a rebbachisaurid Any size estimate of M. fragillimus must be regarded with caution because of the lack of specimens and detailed, accurate documentation of its fossils. All size estimates are based on Cope's original description, which has somewhat vague measurements. It has also been suggested that it contains potentially critical typographical errors, but this idea has been disputed. Producing an estimate of the complete size of M. fragillimus requires scaling the bones of better-described, closely related species based on the assumption that their relative proportions were similar. In his original paper, Cope did this while speculating on the size of a hypothetical M. fragillimus femur (upper leg bone). Cope stated that in other sauropod dinosaurs, specifically Amphicoelias altus and Camarasaurus supremus, the femora were always twice as tall as the tallest dorsal (back) vertebra, and estimated the size of an M. fragillimus femur to be tall. Diplodocus was used by several studies to estimate the size of Maraapunisaurus, assumed to be a diplodocid In 1994, using the related Diplodocus as a reference, Gregory S. Paul estimated a femur length of for A. fragillimus.Paul, G.S. (1994a). \\"Big sauropods ‚Äî really, really big sauropods.\\" The Dinosaur Report, The Dinosaur Society, Fall, p. 12‚Äì13. The 2006 re-evaluation of A. fragillimus by Carpenter also used Diplodocus as a scale guide, finding a femur height of . Carpenter went on to estimate the complete size of M. fragillimus, though he cautioned that relative proportions in diplodocids could vary from species to species. Assuming the same proportions as the well-known Diplodocus, Carpenter presented an estimated total length of , which he noted fell within the range presented by Paul in 1994 (). Carpenter pointed out that even the lowest length estimates for A. fragillimus were higher than those for other giant sauropods, such as the diplodocid Supersaurus (), the brachiosaurid Sauroposeidon (), and the titanosaur Argentinosaurus (). Carpenter presented more speculative, specific proportions for M. fragillimus (again, based on a scaled-up Diplodocus), including a neck length of , a body length of , and a tail length of . He estimated the total forelimb height at and hind limb height at , and the overall height (at the highest point on the back) at . By comparison, the blue whale reaches in length. rebbachisaurid When Carpenter redescribed the taxon as a rebbachisaurid instead of a diplodocid in 2018, he made new, much different size estimates. As his classification scheme put it much farther away from Diplodocus taxonomically, he decided to use Limaysaurus as a model instead; among rebbachisaurids, it was chosen for its completeness because fossils of most other species are very fragmentary. Scaling up Limaysaurus directly, he estimated the length of Maraapunisaurus to be ; additionally, he found it to be tall at the hip. However, he noted that a study from a 2006 book calculated that the neck length of a sauropod scales with the length of the torso by a power of 1.35. With this in mind, he estimated Maraapunisaurus at a slightly longer . The neck of the animal in the smaller estimate was about in length, whereas the larger scaled estimate found a neck of in length. Overall, the revised length of the animal was around half of his earlier estimate, but still comparable to the other largest diplodocoids such as Supersaurus vivianae and Diplodocus hallorum. Also based on Limaysaurus, the complete femur was estimated to have been roughly tall, significantly smaller than older estimates by Cope, Carpenter, and other subsequent authors. Finally, he estimated the length of the toes of the hindfoot, and thus the imprint surface, at , resulting in a foot similar in size to the animal that must have made the giant sauropods tracks in Broome, Australia. Reconstructed skeleton of the titanosaur Argentinosaurus huinculensis, often considered the heaviest dinosaur known from reasonably well-known material While M. fragillimus as a sauropod would be relatively elongated, its enormous size still made it very massive. Weight is much more difficult to determine than length in sauropods, as the more complex equations needed are prone to greater margins of error based on smaller variations in the overall proportions of the animal. Carpenter in 2006 used Paul's 1994 estimate of the mass of Diplodocus carnegii () to speculate that M. fragillimus could have weighed up to . The heaviest blue whale on record weighed , and the heaviest dinosaur known from reasonably good remains, Argentinosaurus, weighed , although if the size estimates can be validated, it could still be lighter than Bruhathkayosaurus, which has been estimated to have weighed , but is also known from highly fragmentary remains.Wedel, M. \\"SV-POW showdown: sauropods vs whales.\\" [Weblog entry.] Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week. May 20, 2008. Accessed May 23, 2008. In 2019 Gregory S. Paul estimated Maraapunisaurus at 35-40 meters (115-131 feet) in length and 80-120 tonnes (88-132 short tons) in weight with a femoral length of 3-3.5 meters (10-11.5 ft) or more, larger than Carpenter's estimation . In 2020, Molina-P√©rez and Larramendi estimated Maraapunisaurus at 35 meters (115 ft) and 70 tonnes (77 short tons) with a hip height of 7.7 meters (25.3 ft). Classification In 1921, Osborn and Mook placed A. fragillimus in the family Diplodocidae. This was generally accepted until well into the twenty- first century. In 2018, Carpenter concluded from a qualitative anatomical comparison that Maraapunisaurus was a basal member of the Rebbachisauridae. The basal position would be indicated by the presence of a hyposphene, a secondary rear articulation process, which is a trait shared with the basal rebbachisaurids Histriasaurus, Comahuesaurus and Demandasaurus. That Maraapunisaurus might be more derived than Histriasaurus is shown by the extensive pneumatisation and the tall neural arch base. If Maraapunisaurus belongs to the Rebbachisauridae, it would be the oldest member of its group known and the only one discovered from the Jurassic. The previous oldest one was Xenoposeidon. It would also be the only one from North America. Carpenter concluded that the Rebbachisauridae might have originated from that continent and only later spread to Europe; from there they would have invaded South America. The usual interpretation had been that rebbachisaurids were South American in origin.  Paleobiology  In his 2006 re-evaluation, Carpenter examined the paleobiology of giant sauropods, including Maraapunisaurus, and addressed the question of why this group attained such a huge size. He pointed out that gigantic sizes were reached early in sauropod evolution, with very large sized species present as early as the late Triassic Period, and concluded that whatever evolutionary pressure caused large size was present from the early origins of the group. Carpenter cited several studies of giant mammalian herbivores, such as elephants and rhinoceros, which showed that larger size in plant-eating animals leads to greater efficiency in digesting food. Since larger animals have longer digestive systems, food is kept in digestion for significantly longer periods of time, allowing large animals to survive on lower-quality food sources. This is especially true of animals with a large number of 'fermentation chambers' along the intestine, which allow microbes to accumulate and ferment plant material, aiding digestion.  Paleoecology  Restoration of an Allosaurus pair attacking Barosaurus in the Morrison Formation environment Throughout their evolutionary history, sauropod dinosaurs were found primarily in semi-arid, seasonally dry environments, with a corresponding seasonal drop in the quality of food during the dry season. The environment of Maraapunisaurus was essentially a savanna, similar to the arid environments in which modern giant herbivores are found, supporting the idea that poor-quality food in an arid environment promotes the evolution of giant herbivores. Carpenter argued that other benefits of large size, such as relative immunity from predators, lower energy expenditure, and longer life span, are probably secondary advantages. The Morrison Formation environment in which Maraapunisaurus lived would have resembled a modern savanna, though since grass did not appear until the Late Cretaceous, ferns were probably the dominant plant and main food source for Maraapunisaurus. Though Engelmann et al. (2004) dismissed ferns as a sauropod food source due to their relatively low caloric content,Engelmann, G.F., Chure, D.J., and Fiorillo, A.R. (2004). \\"The implications of a dry climate for the paleoecology of the fauna of the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation.\\" In Turner, C.E., Peterson, F., and Dunagan, S.P., eds., Reconstruction of the extinct ecosystem of the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation: Sedimentary Geology, 167: 297‚Äì308 Carpenter argued that the sauropod digestive system, well adapted to handle low-quality food, allows for the consumption of ferns as a large part of the sauropod diet. Carpenter also noted that the occasional presence of large petrified logs indicate the presence of tall trees, which would seem to conflict with the savanna comparison. However, the trees are rare, and since tall trees require more water than the savanna environment could generally provide, they probably existed in narrow tracts or \\"gallery forests\\" along rivers and gulleys where water could accumulate. Carpenter speculated that giant herbivores like Maraapunisaurus may have used the shade of the gallery forests to stay cool during the day, and done most of their feeding on the open savanna at night.

Biography Andrew Noren was born 1943 in Santa Fe, New Mexico and grew up in Southern California. Noren moved to New York in the mid 1960s, where he worked as an editor at ABC. Through his job, he was able to access a Bolex 16 mm camera, with which he began making films. His first work, A Change of Heart, was a narrative feature film inspired by Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless. After the film's premiere, Noren met Jonas Mekas through a co-worker. He started working at the Film-Makers' Cooperative, where he became connected to local avant-garde filmmakers. Noren began making more experimental works toying with different documentary approaches. For Say Nothing, he recorded a single 30-minute shot in which he administers a screen test. Inspired by the Lumi√®re brothers, his film The New York Miseries was a collection of three- minute takes documenting his own life. It, along with several other works from Noren's early period, was accidentally destroyed in 1970 and is now a lost film. Noren's next film Huge Pupils was the first entry in The Adventures of the Exquisite Corpse, an ongoing film cycle continued growing for the rest of his career. The cycle came to include eight films: Huge Pupils, False Pretenses, The Phantom Enthusiast, Charmed Particles, The Lighted Field, Imaginary Light, Time Being, Free to Go (Interlude), and Aberration of Starlight.

Metropolitan Museum of Art Three Studies for a Self-Portrait is an oil on canvas triptych painting by the Irish born English artist Francis Bacon. Two of paintings are signed and dated 1979, and the third signed and dated 1979‚Äì1980.\\"Three Studies for a Self-Portrait\\". Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 21 October, 2018Three Studies for Self-Portrait, francis-bacon.com The work can be viewed as a penetrating self-examinations undertaken in the aftermath of the suicide of his lover George Dyer, and as one of a series of inward looking self-portraits completed during the 1970s. Bacon was seventy at the time, but appears as ageless. The work comprises three slightly distorted self-portraits of the artist's face emerging from an enveloping black background. The triptych format allows Bacon to show three aspects of his face: the central portrait viewed face-on, and with slight three quarter views to either side, similar to a police mug shot. Each of the oil-on-canvas paintings measures . Bacon professed to loath his own face, which he described as resembling pudding.Zweite (2006), p. 180 He said that he resorted to self-portraiture as his other subjects were 'dying like flies, so there was no one else left to paint'. Yet, self-portraits dominate his 1970s and early 1980s work after Dyer's suicide, culminating in his masterpiece Study for a Self- Portrait‚ÄîTriptych, 1985‚Äì86, after which he largely abandoned the theme.Sylvester (1987), p. 144 Within this sequence, this triptych is unique for its dark colourisation, sculptural feel, and unique lighting with each panel lit from an unseen source from above. As with most of his mid-period portrait work, Bacon seeks to convey the brutality and impact of life on his sitters by the application of broad and thick brush strokes which serve to severely distort the subject's face. As with most of these works, the heads, which are slightly smaller than life-sized, are confined in tightly constricted spaces, against depth-less and undefined backgrounds. According to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, where the triptych is kept, this focus \\"allows only for ruminations on the face itself ‚Äî its ravages, its deep psychological depths, and the sense of turning around it slowly, going from one frame to the next, as if in a languorous panning shot.\\" The triptych also differs from his usual work with its deep black backgrounds, which further serve to empathise the viewers eye of the sitter's facial features and its delicately rendered complexions. Although Bacon was socially gregarious, he was very protective of his private life, and especially his working methods. He painted from photographs rather than life, and would not allow visitors to his studio during his working hours. Thus his self-portraits gave a rare insight to his inner life at this time.Schmied (1996), p. 88 The paintings were first exhibited at the Marlborough Gallery in 1980, and acquired by Russian-born Mexican film producer Jacques Gelman and his wife Natasha. After the death of Jacques in 1986 and of Natasha in 1998, the triptych was bequeathed to the Metropolitan along with 80 other works from the couple's $300m collection of modern art .\\"Recent Acquisitions, A Selection: 1999‚Äì2000\\".

Although the Drake family had weathered the Revolutionary War in relative safety,Cleves, 9. the economic crisis that followed impacted them particularly hard and they were bankrupt by 1788.Cleves, 11. The family was separated for much of the next ten years as they searched for workCleves, 11-12. until Drake‚Äôs older brother, Asaph, established a household in Weybridge, Vermont.Cleves, 14. Drake‚Äôs father died on the journey in January 1798,Cleves, 15. but in 1799, Drake and her mother settled in Weybridge.Ibid. As a teenager, Drake was visited by a number of young men ‚Äúpaying their respect‚Äù to her,Cleves, 54. but she did not express interest in any of them.Ibid. In February 1807, Drake met Charity Bryant, a friend of her older sister who had recently arrived in Weybridge.Cleves, 94. In July of the same year, Drake moved into Bryant‚Äôs rented home there and, as she later wrote in her diary, ‚Äúcommenced serving in company with Dear Miss B.‚Äù‚ÄúSylvia And Charity: A Vermont Love Story For The Ages,‚Äù Henry Sheldon Museum of Vermont History, April 30, 2009, Accessed December 2, 2018, http://henrysheldonmuseum.org/sylvia-and-charity-a-vermont-love-story-for-the- ages/. In January of 1809, the two women moved into a house of their very own out of which they ran their tailor shop.Cleves, 118. They were well-known members of their town, and in the spring of 1822, many members of the community assisted with major renovations to their house.Cleves, 126. Indeed, to the people of Weybridge, there was generally little publicly expressed concern about the women‚Äôs relationship. When it came to tax documents and census records, Bryant was listed as the head of the household,\\"How Did It Feel? Open Secrets about Sex and Race in Early America,\\" in Early American Literature 51, no. 1, 166. and the people who knew them often spoke of them in terms generally used to discuss marriage. In the words of Bryant‚Äôs nephew, famed romantic poet, William Cullen Bryant > ‚ÄúIf I were permitted to draw the veil of private life, I would briefly give > you the singular, and to me interesting, story of two maiden ladies who > dwell in this valley. I would tell you how, in their youthful days, they > took each other as companions for life, and how this union, no less sacred > to them than the tie of marriage, has subsisted, in uninterrupted harmony, > for more than forty years.‚ÄùHenry Sheldon Museum Not everyone was so amiable, though; Drake‚Äôs mother and some of her brothers did not visit often, but ultimately ‚Äúthe family compromised its embargo to preserve‚Ä¶amity.‚ÄùCleves, 128. Both Bryant and Drake frequently suffered from poor health. (Sheldon) Drake, in particular, was prone to severe migraines.Cleves, 184. Over the years, they turned to a variety of treatments for their ailments, often exploring both chemical and natural remedies,Cleves, 185. which gave them the medical knowledge to assist friends and family when necessary.Cleves, 193-4. Bryant‚Äôs ill-health ultimately caught up with her, and she died of a heart attack on October 6, 1851.Cleves, 197. Following Bryant‚Äôs death, Drake was occupied with both running their business on her own, as well as managing the house that Bryant had left her.Cleves, 202. In 1859, she moved out of her home to live with and care for her elderly brother, Asaph. Drake was eighty-three years old when she died on February 13, 1868.Cleves, 203.

Built on powerful, complex and carefully crafted rock arrangements, either by single band members or by the band as a unit, the album marked a significant stylistic and musical departure for De Andr√©, whose production up to that point had always employed acoustic-based, folk arrangements, occasionally branching into pop but never overtly using rock structures and instrumentation. Upon release, the album became immediately very popular and paved the way for other Italian singer-songwriters (notably Francesco Guccini) for their own transition from a folk style into a more rock-oriented one. The album was followed by a Volume 2 the next year, recorded during the same shows. Background and overview De Andr√© and the members of PFM had known each other since 1969, when the band, then known as Quelli (\\"Those ones\\") and mainly active as session musicians, had played on his album La buona novella. In a 1979 interview, as testified in the eighth and last disc (Poesia in forma di canzone - \\"Poetry as songs\\") of the 2011 8-DVD documentary series Dentro Faber [i.e. \\"Inside Faber\\", about De Andr√©'s life and career, \\"Faber\\" being his nickname in Genoese], De Andr√© explained that he was talked into bringing a \\"rockier\\" feel to his music by drummer Franz Di Cioccio, guitarist Franco Mussida and, especially, multi-instrumentalist Mauro Pagani, who, although he was no longer a PFM member by then, had played on La buona novella and was still friends with all of the band's then-current members. (In later years, Pagani became one of De Andr√©'s most trusted collaborators, composing and arranging most of the music for the latter's albums Cr√™uza de m√§ and Le nuvole, also playing a number of ethnic instruments on both albums.) The Genoan songwriter, who at the time was also suffering from a lack of motivation and stimuli, enthusiastically accepted the band's proposal, and the tour, later immortalized by the two-volume live album, was born.Dentro Faber, DVD 8: Poesia in forma di canzone. All of the tour dates were very successful in terms of ticket sales and of popularity, although some of De Andre's early \\"purist\\" fans viewed his move into rock as selling out, or simply as De Andr√© \\"pandering\\" to a more contemporary music style in order to have a broader appeal. However, music critics at the time, comparing the tour to Bob Dylan \\"going electric\\" in 1965, lauded the tour itself, and its resulting live albums, for their great originality, and praised De Andr√©'s audacity in going beyond the commonly accepted \\"minimal\\" attitude of 1970s singer-songwriters (according to which the number of instruments which were played alongside the singing, and the quality of the playing itself, had a much lesser importance than the lyrics) and \\"dressing up\\" his songs in beautiful musical arrangements, which thus became just as relevant as his lyrics.As told by De Andr√© and Guido Harari in their book Una goccia di splendore: un'autobiografia per parole e immagini [\\"A drop of brightness: an autobiography for words and pictures\\"], published posthumously by Rizzoli in 2010.

The singer responded (in the second excerpt, track 10 on the CD) by claiming that there are no such things as good ideals and bad ideals, but that ideals are seen as good or bad depending on them being accepted by a majority or a minority of people. Di Cioccio, on his own turn, defended the combination on the ground that PFM were merely functioning as De Andre's backing band for that tour, as opposed to a fully-fledged rock band with their own personality; he then proceeded to introduce the band members, as he did on Volume 2.I Concerti 2012 box set, CD 4, tracks 9-12. Song changes With PFM imprinting their own progressive rock stamp on all songs, all of the arrangements are notably different from their respective original studio recordings. Some of the changes are subtle, others more radical. Fabrizio De Andr√© in Concerto *\\"Bocca di Rosa\\", originally from Volume 1, is given a new intro and a new solo by Mussida and keyboardist Flavio Premoli, with additional violin passages by violinist Lucio \\"Violino\\" Fabbri. The tarantella rhythm on the original recording is removed, and the song is played instead as a fast shuffle in . *\\"Andrea\\", originally from Rimini, is played faster than the original, and Massimo Bubola's passionately Mediterranean instrumental melody (functioning as an interlude between verses) is more prominent. *\\"Giugno '73\\" adds a new intro, but remains otherwise faithful to its original recording on Volume 8; only, keyboards are more prominent and the instrumental interlude is played by Franz Di Cioccio on crotales. *\\"Un giudice\\" is played very slightly slower than its original recording on Non al denaro non all'amore n√© al cielo and it is given a Cajun feel by Premoli, who adds a new solo on accordion. *\\"La guerra di Piero\\" is relatively unchanged from its original recording on Volume 3; the song's military march feel is emphasized by Di Cioccio's percussion and additional keyboards by guest musician Roberto Colombo, one of which is played with a harpsichord timbre. *\\"Il pescatore\\", originally released in 1970 as a standalone single, features one of the most striking changes: the simple folk arrangement in the original version is transformed into a rousing rock anthem, featuring heavy drums, percussion (both engaged in a short solo/break towards the end), electric and acoustic guitars, keyboards and violin. The hook, originally consisting in a whistled melody, is joyously sung as a choir (\\"La-la-la-la, la-la, la-la...\\" etc.) by the entire band - except for bassist Patrick Djivas, who does not sing. *\\"Zirichiltaggia\\" is, again, played much faster than its original recording on Rimini. Fabbri emphasizes the song's bluegrass feel by playing a longer fiddle solo. The harmony vocals, originally sung by Bubola as one of the two shepherds comically arguing in the song, are here sung by Mussida. In his introduction to the song, De Andr√© stated that living in Gallura for four years meant that he at least managed to learn the local language - which allowed him to write the song. *\\"La canzone di Marinella\\" is transposed from the beat of its original recording, on Volume 3, to a beat, and the arrangement, led by piano and acoustic guitar, is softer and calmer than the original - thus adding even more sweetness to De Andr√©'s already sugar-coated, fairytale-like lyrical treatment of Marinella's rape and tragic death. *In \\"Volta la carta\\", the Irish gig elements of the original recording, on Rimini, are given more prominence, with the main interludes being played on violin and keyboards. Mussida sings Dori Ghezzi's part from the original version, and the final operatic tenor high note is omitted, played instead as a held note on the violin. Di Cioccio starts the song by singing \\"Branca, Branca, Branca!\\", to which the band responds \\"Le√≤n, Le√≤n, Le√≤n!\\" - a reference to the main theme from the 1966 film L'armata Brancaleone. *\\"Amico fragile\\" is much longer than its original recording on Volume 8, with a new intro by Premoli and two new guitar solos by Mussida. De Andr√© sings the second verse an octave higher than the original, and in a much more impassioned tone, highlighting the overall resentful attitude of the whole lyric. Fabrizio De Andr√© in Concerto, Volume 2 *\\"Avventura a Durango\\" is a slightly faster adaption of the original recording on Rimini, which was itself faithfully adapted from the Dylan recording. Although the general tone of De Andr√©'s delivery remains lightweight, he sings with a more direct and focused tone than on the studio version. During the Neapolitan chorus, De Andr√© harmonizes with Colombo (in lieu of Bubola) and Di Cioccio punctuates it with a disco beat, still being aware of the rhythmical irregularities in the main song. *In \\"Sally\\", the interlude melody, played on acoustic guitars in the original studio version on Rimini, is complemented by Colombo's prominent Moog synth (Colombo arranged the song by himself). In the last verse, De Andr√© sings: \\"Mia madre mi disse: ¬´Non devi giocare con gli Svizzeri nel bosco¬ª\\" [\\"My mother told me: ¬´You shouldn't play with the Swiss people in the woods¬ª\\"], instead of the correct word zingari (i.e. gypsies, used at the time in Italy as a slightly dispreciative epithet for Romani people). Years later, he attributed this mistake to his being intoxicated on stage, as he used to drink half a bottle of whisky immediately before each show in order to win his severe stage fright.Also from Una goccia di splendore. *In \\"Verranno a chiederti del nostro amore\\", a new piano introduction is added; the orchestration on the original recording, on Storia di un impiegato, is simplified and played on keyboards and synths. *The choir singing the titular word in \\"Rimini\\" is here sung by the entire band - except for Djivas - with Fabbri taking the highest note in a falsetto voice; Premoli adds a new synth solo at the end. After performing the song, De Andr√© states that a similar story to that in the song was told much better in ¬´I Vitellini¬ª by Felloni, referring to the 1965 film I Vitelloni by Federico Fellini. The unintential spoonerism was later referred to by De Andr√© as another mistake due to intoxication. *\\"Via del Campo\\", another Colombo arrangement, is led by the guest keyboardist's harpsichord-like synth. He also adds an instrumental interlude in order to modulate between the second and third verses. (In the original recording, on the 1967 Volume 1 album, the modulation is carried out on guitars.) *In \\"Maria nella bottega del falegname\\" the choral parts, representing the townspeople, are sung by Di Cioccio, Mussida and Fabbri in unison, without any harmonizations and, unlike the original recording on La buona novella, obviously without any female vocals. Premoli adds a new synth solo at the end. Before the song starts, Di Cioccio acts out the role of the carpenter by shouting to \\"Mary\\" in Milanese. *Similar to \\"Il pescatore\\" on the 1979 release, \\"Il testamento di Tito\\", originally from La buona novella, features a full-on rock performance by the whole band, including heavy, prominent drums, acoustic and electric guitars, an electric violin part by Fabbri, a new guitar intro by Mussida and a new synth solo by Premoli. De Andr√©'s vocal delivery is, again, slightly angrier in tone than the detached attitude of his original vocals on the studio recording. Legacy De Andr√® was immediately appreciative of the new slant given by PFM to his songs (especially the older ones), to the point that he kept using identical arrangements to PFM's in all of his subsequent tours, up to his very last concerts in 1998, regardless of the musicians he played with. When asked in 1991 by his longtime lighting and theatrical director Pepi Morgia why he kept using the PFM versions instead of his own ones, De Andr√© half-jokingly replied: \\"Belin,Genoese slang for penis, here used as an equivalent of fuck! or fuck it!. because they are so damn good that nobody has ever done any better - and nobody ever will, most of all myself!\\" Told by Pepi Morgia in Dentro Faber, Vol. 8.

Reissues and artwork The two albums were remastered and reissued several times by Ricordi, BMG and Sony Music, starting from 1995. In 2007, sound engineer Paolo Iafelice, who took care of field recordings for De Andr√©'s 1994 album Anime salve and later worked as a technical engineer on his posthumous releases (as well as on live recordings by De Andr√©'s firstborn son Cristiano), undertook an extensive remix of both albums, by carrying them through a process of \\"de-mastering\\" - i.e. going back to the original 1979 tapes and removing all subsequent layers of remastering to obtain a flat transfer of the tapes themselves, then carefully mixing them anew in order to bring out previously obscured details. Also, when originally recorded, some of the songs were sped up for unknown reasons; Iafelice's remix brought all recordings back to their correct speed. Artwork Expert concert photographer Guido Harari took all the photos for the artwork. The front cover of both albums is a shot of the audience in Florence taken from above the stage, without De Andr√© (his chair is empty); the photo has an orange-red tint on the first 1979 release, and a light green tint on Volume 2. The gatefold cover of the first album includes more onstage pictures of single members, and the album also features a booklet consisting of black-and-white stills of De Andr√© and band members relaxing and having fun backstage. The booklet includes, on its second-to-last page, a poem by De Andr√© entitled \\"Blues di altre date\\" [\\"Blues from other dates\\"], which he never set to music, written as a letter to Djivas. Two short handwritten parodies by De Andr√© are used as captions on three photos: *A picture of De Andr√© seemingly asleep on the ground next to a heater is captioned with a parody of the first two lines from \\"Il pescatore\\": \\"Col culo esposto a un radiatore/s'era assopito il cantautore...\\" (\\"With his ass exposed to a heater, the singer-songwriter had fallen asleep...\\"). *Two ugly-looking pictures of Colombo and Fabbri holding their identity cards are captioned with a parody of the first verse from \\"Delitto di paese\\" (De Andr√®'s 1965 translation of \\"L'assassinat\\", a Georges Brassens original from 1962): \\"Non tutti all'ombra di un ideale/sbocciano i fiori del male;/due terroristi malgrado tutto/ci abbiamo anche noi nel gruppo...\\" (\\"It's not always in the shadow of an ideal/that the flowers of evil blossom;/even we, in spite of everything/have got two terrorists in our band...\\") The 2007 reissue features a reworked sepia-toned band photo by Harari on the front cover, overlaid with \\"Fabrizio De Andr√© & PFM\\" in a large white type and \\"In Concerto\\" in a smaller dark brown type. The booklet within the reissue features all of Harari's photos from the previous issues, and more previously unreleased ones. 40th anniversary tribute concert To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the original 1979 live album, a tribute concert took place at Verona Arena on 26 September 2019. It featured Cristiano De Andr√© on lead vocals, accompanied by the current members of PFM (i.e. Di Cioccio, Djivas and Fabbri - Premoli and Mussida having left the band respectively in 2005 and 2015), plus several guest musicians. The show consisted in a faithful live re-creation of the album and of its second volume, both in their original running order.Live broadcast by Rai 1 on 26 September 2019.

The three ships are La Lavia, La Juliana, and the Santa Maria de Vis√≥n. All were part of the Levant squadron of the armada. The Lavia was the almiranta, or vice flagship of the fleet and carried the Judge Advocate General, Martin de Aranda, responsible for the discipline of the armada. Discovery After extensive documentary research of over three years, an English salvage team, the Streedagh Strand Armada Group, identified the wrecksite on 6 May 1985. Subsequently, a court battle was fought over salvage rights. The wrecks are protected under the National Monuments (Amendment) Acts 1987 and 1994 which prevents any diving on the wrecks except under licence from the Irish government. Background The three ships had set sail in the Levant squadron with the rest of the Armada from Lisbon on 29 May 1588. The Lavia (homeport Venice) had been requisitioned on 16 February that year at Lisbon. The Juliana (home port Barcelona) on 16 December 1586 in Sicily, and the Santa Maria de Vison (home port Ragusa/Dubrovnik) on 6 May 1587 at Naples. The Levant squadron consisted of 10 ships and had a complement of 767 seamen and a total of 2,780 soldiers. They were large merchant vessels and intended as transports for the men and equipment required for the invasion of England. The Levant squadron was under the command of Don Martin de Bertendona. The squadron contained some of the largest transports in the Armada. The Lavia had Martin de Aranda, the Judge Advocate General of the fleet on board. It was to him De Cuellar was sent for sentencing after his court martial. The ships were carracks, which were often some of the largest vessels of their day, and favoured for merchantmen due to their large cargo holds. There is some confusion as to whether tonnages given are burdened weight, as practice varied, but this is the most likely interpretation. The three ships manifests were as follows. The Santa Maria de Vison de y Biscione had 18 guns, 70 sailors, 236 soldiers and displaced 666 tons. She was possibly functioning as a hospital ship and therefore may have had more people on board than the official amount. During the voyage half the fleets medical supplies were transferred to the Santa Maria de Vison from the Casa de Paz which had been deemed unseaworthy. La Lavia, a Venetian merchantman from Naples and the vice- flagship of the squadron, mounted 25 guns, displaced 728 tons, had a crew of 71 sailors and transported 271 soldiers. The Juliana was a Catalan merchantman from Barcelona 32 guns, displaced 860 tons Built in 1570, she had 65 crew 290 soldiers estimated 325-520 tons burthen this ship was perhaps carrying siege train parts and tools and potentially heavy guns as part of the siege train for use against fortifications. The cannons recovered at the site 1 wreck-site show the Matrona of Barcelona and bear the mark of the Genoese gunfounder Gioardi Dorino II, which confirm this as the wreck of the Juliana. In all, the three ships displaced 2254 tons and carried a minimum of 807 soldiers and 206 sailors making a full an estimated minimum complement of 1, 013 people on board the ships at the time of the sinking. The number is likely to have been considerably higher though due to inter ship transfers from damaged or lost vessels. The ships had incurred heavy damage in the fighting in the English channel where the Levant squadron was one of the first engaged. They had also cut their main anchors loose after contact with English fireships just before the battle of Gravelines. These factors, added to the difficulty these Carracks had in sailing to windward and their lack of heavy equipment for north Atlantic sailing, left them the most vulnerable part of the fleet. Unable to round Erris head against a southwesterly gale, the squadron was driven in towards the coast at Cairbre, now county Sligo, and on 17 September the ships dropped anchor 2 miles offshore and prepared to ride out the storm. On 21 September the storm worsened and changed to the west-northwest from which the ships had no shelter. Hit broadside by huge seas, the cables broke and the ships were driven onto the shore where they rapidly broke up. The scene was described by the eyewitness and survivor Francisco de Cuellar Wrecksite The site consists of three locations roughly parallel to the shore, marked by the discovery team as sites 1, 2 and 3. The state of preservation of the wrecks is unknown, but thought to be very good both in organic remains and in the remains of the articulated timber hulls of the ships so far recorded. Further excavations took place in 2015 after timber wreckage was found on the shore. Six cannon were recovered, making nine in total so far recovered from the wreck of the Juliana. Site 1 Site 1 is located just off the centre of the beach. Based on magnetometer readings site one covers an area of 165m by 40m. The depth varies between 3.8m and 5.2m. the spread may represent the fact that this is in an exposed position and subject to the most disturbance. Three guns identified at this site are those from the La Juliana and it is presumed this is her wrecksite. A total of five spoked wheels were identified in initial investigations. Three bronze guns were recovered in 1985 here. In 2015, storms exposed the wreck-site again and a salvage operation was commenced by the National Monuments Service of the Irish state. Nine guns, a gun carriage wheel and cauldron were recovered by divers during this phase. Several of these guns bear the date 1570, matching the Julianas build date, and were cast by the Genoese gunfounder Gioardi Dorino II. One gun shows evidence of Turkish manufacture, perhaps having been captured at the battle of Lepanto in 1571. Site 2 390m to the southwest of site 1 is a concentration of magnetometer readings extending 15m by 10m at a depth of 3.5 to 5.0 metres. This site is identified as the location of the Santa Maria de Vison, but this awaits confirmation. It is possible this represents a partial signature from metal remains and not the ship itself. Site 3 A further 20m to the southwest of site 2 is a large cluster of readings extending 270m by 72m. This location has the largest buildup of sand as it is sheltered by the headland to the southwest. This site is identified as that of the Lavia, however it is not certain. In 1987 two wooden gun carriages with their bronze guns were revealed. One was a truck type previously unrecorded on Spanish vessels at this time, the other was a trailed carriage in good condition with both wheels still attached. A breech loading swivel gun identified as a falcon pedrero was also identified. Conclusion Considering the large scale of site 3 and the small scale of site 2 it is possible that both the Lavia and Santa Maria de Vison are located in this area having sunk together. Legacy The site is unique in the world and represents an unparalleled preservation of three late 16th century ships in a coastal location. Monitoring and surveying continues as the wrecks are in a vulnerable high energy environment that is frequently exposed to storms. The event is commemorated every year in the village of Grange with a festival. In 2018 a new visitors centre telling the story of the shipwrecks was opened.https://www.independent.ie/regionals/sligochampion/news/streedagh-and- spain-pay-homage-to-1100-spanish-armada-victims-37349739.html Another wreck on the beach, visible at low tide and known as the \\"butter boat\\" was thought to be related to the armada, but archaeological testing in 2016 has shown it to be an 18th-century wreck.https://www.independent.ie/regionals/sligochampion/news/butter-boat-age- is-revealed-35061781.html Further reading Francisco de Cuellars adventures in Connacht and Ulster References Category:Spanish Armada Category:16th- century maritime incidents Category:1588 in Ireland ","title":"Streedagh Armada wrecksite"},{"id":"58843336","text":"Entrance to a Dutch Port is a mid 17th century painting by Dutch artist Willem van de Velde the Younger.

Its nearest higher peak is Mount Thompson, to the southwest. Mount Jimmy Simpson is a member of the Waputik Mountains, and is situated east of the Wapta Icefield and west of the Bow River valley. Mount Jimmy Simpson can be seen from the Icefields Parkway at Bow Lake. Jimmy Simpson Junior is a 2,721 meter sub-summit east of the mountain.  History Mount Jimmy Simpson is named for Jimmy Simpson (1877‚Äì1972) who was a respected outfitter in the early explorations of the Canadian Rockies. Jimmy worked as a cook for Tom Wilson and learned the guide and outfitting business from Bill Peyto. In 1902, while working for Peyto, he was given the responsibility of leading James Outram's climbing expedition into the headwaters of the North Saskatchewan River and Columbia Icefield. Jimmy built a small log cabin for use with his outfitting business on the north shore of Bow Lake. It was expanded in 1937, and is now the historic Num-Ti-Jah Lodge. Jimmy continued actively guiding until the end of World War II when his son, Jimmy Simpson Junior, took over the business. The first ascent of Mount Jimmy Simpson was made in 1897 by J. Norman Collie, George Percival , and Peter Sarbach. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1973 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology Like other mountains in Banff Park, Mount Jimmy Simpson is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Jimmy Simpson is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. Precipitation runoff from Mount Jimmy Simpson drains into the Bow River which is a tributary of the Saskatchewan River.

Many of the 5,000 dead had served in the two Bradford Pals battalions and were killed on 1 July 1916, the first day of the First Battle of the Somme. The stone pylon with bronze statues was unveiled on 1 July 1922, in Victoria Square, beside Prince's Way, to the northeast of the Grade II listed Queen Victoria Memorial. A bronze plaque was added after the Second World War, and the memorial also commemorates later conflicts. It stands between the National Media Museum and Alhambra Theatre, Bradford, and was Grade II listed in 2016. The memorial was designed by Bradford's city architect Walter Williamson, with sculpture by HH Martyn and Co of Cheltenham. It comprises a high central tapering pylon made from stone from the nearby Bolton Woods quarry, topped by a stone sarcophagus. The front and rear face of the pylon are carved with a cross, the lower arm of which becomes a sword blade passing through a wreath. The front wreath has a scroll with the words \\"PRO PATRI MORI\\". Either side of the pylon bears a winged wreath with the letters \\"RAF\\". The pylon stands an oval platform, with steps down to the road passing by. Two bronze statues stand on the stepped base, one to either side of the central pylon, a soldier to the left and a sailor to the right, each lunging forward with a rifle. Historic England attributes the bronze sculptures to Robert Lindsey Clark (father of Philip Lindsey Clark) who was head sculptor at HH Martyn and Co Ltd from 1905 to 1926. The warlike pose of the soldiers was controversial when the memorial was first unveiled. Originally each rifle had a fixed bayonet; the blades were damaged in 1969 and then removed, but the hilt of each bayonet remains in place. The front of the pylon originally bore the dedicatory inscription \\"TO THE IMMORTAL HONOUR OF THE MEN / OF THE CITY OF BRADFORD WHO SERVED / THEIR KING AND EMPIRE IN THE GREAT / WAR, 1914 - 1918 // THIS MEMORIAL ERECTED / BY THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS IS DEDICATED / IN PROUD AND GRATEFUL REMEMBRANCE, / 1ST JULY, 1922 / UNVEILED BY ALDERMAN A. GADIE, J.P./ LIEUT-COL. T.F., LORD MAYOR 1920-21\\". This inscription was later covered by a bronze plaque added in 1969 to also commemorate the casualties of the Second World War, and which has been updated to commemorate subsequent conflicts, so it now read \\"TO THE IMMORTAL HONOUR OF / THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE / CITY OF BRADFORD / WHO SERVED THEIR KING AND EMPIRE / 1914 - 1918 1939 - 1945/ AND IN OTHER CONFLICT / IN PROUD AND/ GRATEFUL REMEMBRANCE\\". Below this, the base still bears the original inscription \\"THEIR NAME LIVETH FOR EVERMORE\\". Two pals battalions of the Prince of Wales's Own (West Yorkshire Regiment) had been raised in Bradford: the 16th (Service) Battalion in September 1914 and the 18th (Service) Battalion in January 1915. The battalions both served in the 93rd Brigade in Egypt in 1915-16, and then on the Western Front in France. Around 2,000 men from Bradford went over the top to attack Serre on 1 July 1916, at the northern edge of the Allied attack on the first day of the First Battle of the Somme. Almost 1,800 were killed or wounded that day. The battalions were reformed with new recruits and continued to serve on the Western Front until February 1918. The memorial was unveiled on Saturday 1 July 1922, the sixth anniversary of the commencement of the First Battle of the Somme, in front of a crowd of 40,000 people, by Lt-Col Alderman Anthony Gadie (a former Lord Mayor of Bradford, and later MP for Bradford Central from 1924 to 1929). It was dedicated by the Archdeacon of Bradford, William Stanton Jones (later Bishop of Sodor and Man).

It has been held by the Tate Gallery since 1965. The abstract sculpture is an arrangement of metal parts painted red, with no obvious focus or representative elements. It comprises a collection of planes and lines arranged along a horizontal axis, with an appearance of lightness that belies its heavy construction. The work measures . The self-supporting work rests on the floor, with no plinth, to be viewed in the round. Caro was an assistant to Henry Moore in the 1950s, but the works of David Smith inspired Caro to move decisively away from Moore's semi-figurative sculpture towards more abstract works constructed from industrial metal elements. The sculpture was made at Caro's home, but the large work could not be properly viewed in the confined space, so Caro and a friend took it to pieces late at night and reassembled it outside. The name comes from Caro's first proper view of the work, early the next morning. It was originally painted green, to unify the disparate elements into one piece. Caro was unhappy with the result, and Caro's wife Sheila suggested painting it red instead. The complete sculpture was first exhibited at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in the autumn of 1963, and was included in the exhibition of modern sculpture at the British Pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 1966. It was acquired from the artist by the Contemporary Art Society in 1965, and presented to the Tate Gallery later that year.

It was published only two years after Deschooling Society. In this new work Illich generalized the themes that he had previously applied to the field of education: the institutionalization of specialized knowledge, the dominant role of technocratic elites in industrial society, and the need to develop new instruments for the reconquest of practical knowledge by the average citizen. He wrote that \\"[e]lite professional groups ... have come to exert a 'radical monopoly' on such basic human activities as health, agriculture, home-building, and learning, leading to a 'war on subsistence' that robs peasant societies of their vital skills and know-how. The result of much economic development is very often not human flourishing but 'modernized poverty', dependency, and an out-of-control system in which the humans become worn-down mechanical parts.\\" Illich proposed that we should \\"invert the present deep structure of tools\\" in order to \\"give people tools that guarantee their right to work with independent efficiency.\\" The idea of the 'radical monopoly' is also applied to the effects of cars on the urban form, as \\"speedy vehicles of all kinds render space scarce.\\" Ivan Illich contributes to a radical critic of modern urbanism: \\"this monopoly over land turns space into car fodder. It destroys the environment for feet and bicycles. Even if planes and buses could run as nonpolluting, nondepleting public services, their inhuman velocities would degrade man's innate mobility and force him to spend more time for the sake of travel.\\" Tools for Conviviality attracted worldwide attention. A r√©sum√© of it was published by French social philosopher Andr√© Gorz in Les Temps Modernes, under the title \\"Freeing the Future\\".

May Alden Ward (March 1, 1853 - January 14, 1918) was an American author known for her biographies of such writers as Petrarch and Dante. Biography She was born May Alden in Mechanicsburg, Ohio, one of three children of Prince William Alden (a merchant and banker) and Rebecca (Neal) Alden. She was a descendant of Captain John Alden, who came to America on the Mayflower. She early developed an interest in literature and languages and by the age of 16 was contributing articles to a Cincinnati periodical. She graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1872 at the age of 19 and a year later married William G. Ward, who held various academic positions over his career including history professor at Baldwin University near Cleveland and later English literature professor at Syracuse University in New York and at Emerson College in Boston. Ward traveled for two years in Europe to continue her study of Italian, French, and German literature. In 1887, she published a life of Dante, followed four years later by a life of Petrarch. Reviewers praised these books for their skillful synthesis of the existing scholarship, and the New York Times singled out Ward's lively, clear prose style and historian's instinct. Author William Dean Howells commented that her work removed \\"the stain and whitewash of centuries\\" to reveal the underlying historical truth. Her subsequent book on John Ruskin, Leo Tolstoy, and Thomas Carlyle, Prophets of the Nineteenth Century, was hailed as masterly. Ward also lectured on French and German literature and became a popular speaker on the women's club circuit. In the late 1890s, Ward and her family moved to Massachusetts, where she served as president of various organizations including the New England Women's Club (succeeding the poet Julia Ward Howe in that role), the New England Woman's Press Association, and the Cantabrigia women's club. She was also a charter member of the Authors' Club of Boston and one of the Massachusetts state commissioners for the St. Louis World's Fair of 1904. She was killed in an accident when the car she was riding in on her way home from an evening lecture collided with an electric streetcar in Boston.

The town is 7 kilometres east of Nev≈üehir, 12 kilometres west of √úrg√ºp, and 10 kilometres south of Avanos.  History  U√ßhisar is first mentioned in a 14th-century chronicle by Aziz ibn Ardasir. The general area had been occupied much earlier, however. The Hittites may have used the natural structures of the cliffs as refuges and strongholds against possible attacks. In the seventh century AD, the Byzantines created a 'buffer zone' in the area against Islamic expansion. The nature of the terrain was conducive to defence, while the camouflage of the buildings provided an improved defence against attackers. After their conquest of the region, the Muslims also made use of the defensive possibilities of the area, creating small centres with caravanserais in the region.Kappadokien. Casa Editrice Bonechi (1996) p.12  Description  U√ßhisar, which is situated on the edge of G√∂reme National Park, is dominated by a 60-metre-high castle- mountain, which is visible over a wide distance and has the form of a large cylindrical tower. This massif is crisscrossed by numerous underground passageways and rooms, which are now mostly blocked or impassable. They served as residential areas, as well as cloisters in Byzantine times. Originally, around 1,000 people lived in the castle, but it is no longer inhabited today. The landscape is also marked by the fairy chimneys scattered through it. In the centre of the town there is an underground gallery, which extends for about 100 metres underneath some houses. It was cut in tuff (a type of rock) in earlier times and probably served as a link from the fortress to the outside world and to protect their water supply. Near the town is the so- called 'Valley of the Dovecotes', or Pigeon Valley (). Over the course of the years, many dovecotes were carved in the cliff-faces of the valley. These are structures with large frontal surfaces. Inside, there are lots of niches for local birds to roost in. The excrement from the nests in these dovecotes was mainly used as manure. Travelling through this valley from U√ßhisar, it takes two hours to reach G√∂reme to the northeast. A majority of the population of U√ßhisar today live off agriculture, but tourism plays an ever larger role. In particular, the French and Turks returning from France have begun to transform the painted cliff houses into tourist lodgings.

He is notable for the work he did for Fred Harvey during those years, as well as numerous other projects before and afterward.  Family and education  Robert James Raney was born on November 2, 1883 into the working class, railroad community of Whistler, Alabama, son of John Newton Raney and Annie Maher Raney. His father was a blacksmith who worked for the Mobile, Jackson & Kansas City (M.J. & K.C.) and the Mobile & Ohio Railroads. He had three siblings, Edna Frances Raney Kohl (18851962), Annie Teresa Raney Gradel (18871969), and William Roy Raney (18911963). After graduating from high school in the fall of 1899, Raney enrolled at the University of Alabama. Since the university required freshmen to be at least 16 years of age at the start of the fall term, October 4th that year, Raney used his mother's birthdate of September 19 so he would not have to wait another year. He used that as his birthdate for the rest of his life. Raney received his Bachelor's of Science in Engineering in 1903. He was also awarded a fellowshipTuscaloosa News, Fellowships Granted, Tuscaloosa News, Page 7, Tuesday, 14 July 1903 and received his master's degree in civil engineering the following year.Tuscaloosa News, Day of Days for Students: Diplomas Delivered to a Remarkably Fine Class at the University, Tuscaloosa News, Page 2, 2 June 1904  Early career  Raney apprenticed for several years under Chattanooga architect David Vincent Stroop (18641943). Notable buildings by Stroop during Raney's apprenticeship include the still extant Christ Church Episcopal in Chattanooga (1908), a hotel on Lookout Mountain, and many residences for the affluent of Chattanooga. In 1908, Raney quietly married Miss Corinne Hendrix, who worked in Chattanooga as a bookkeeper to Ellsworth L. Mudge, a prominent photographer and client of Stroop. She was originally from Milledgeville, Georgia.Milledgeville-Union Recorder, HENDRIX-RANEY, Milledgeville-Union Recorder, Page 5, 28 January 1908. In 1910, the Raneys left Chattanooga for Kansas City, Missouri. Raney had accepted a draftsman position with the Missouri & Kansas Telephone Company. A little over a year later he left to work for eclectic architect Louis Curtiss. The chance to work for Curtiss, who has been called \\"the Frank Lloyd Wright of Kansas City,\\" was an opportunity he was wise not to pass up. Buildings designed by Curtiss during the time Raney worked for him include six stone homes for William Rockhill Nelson in Kansas City, Missouri; the innovative Bernard Corrigan residence in Kansas City, Missouri; the Casa Ricardo Hotel for the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway with Fred Harvey Company management in Kingsville, Texas; the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway headquarters in Kingsville, Texas; the Santa Fe Depot in Snyder, Texas; and Union Station in Joplin, Missouri. In 1912, Curtiss also redesigned the home of J. Fred and Minnie Harvey Huckel in Kansas City. Minnie was the daughter of entrepreneur Fred Harvey and Huckel had been an executive with the Fred Harvey Company since the late 1890s and had founded and managed its Indian Department. This may have been Raney's first direct encounter with the Harvey family. Raney left Curtiss in September 1913 to start his own architectural practice, perhaps precipitated by a decline in Curtiss' volume of work. Due to several factors, not the least of which was a nationwide recession and perhaps a shift in architectural preferences to more conservative styles, Curtiss trimmed down his local projects and concentrated more on his work for the railroad. Raney worked on his own for about a year, then went on to form a partnership with Pierre E. Dumas in October 1914. Dumas' name on the business leaves the impression that he was also an architect, but his background indicates otherwise. In 1910, he was searching for a \\"situation\\" as a bookkeeper/timekeeper in Denver, Colorado. Again, in 1912, he was searching for a position as a Spanish or French correspondent. In 1913, he is listed as a clerk for Richardson & Boynton, a furnace company. Though in 1914, prior to his partnership with Raney, he was listed as an engineer with Lynn E. Bowman, a plumber, throughout the rest of his career, including his 1918 World War I draft registration which lists his occupation as \\"General Advertising Business\\" for the Clyde Glenn Company in Tampa, Florida, Dumas worked in advertising. An article about him in the Tampa Tribune indicates that his specialty was general advertising. During his time with Raney, he was likely responsible for marketing and acquiring new business. My Architect, A Compendium of Suggestions for the Prospective Builder, by Raney & Dumas In 1915, Raney & Dumas published My Architect, A Compendium of Suggestions for the Prospective Builder. Well reviewed by the industry, the 128-page book contained illustrations, floor plans, and building advice for everything from small bungalows to larger \\"mansion types,\\" apartments, garages, movie theaters, churches, banks, libraries, stores, landscape gardening, and farm buildings. While the plans for each building were available for purchase at a nominal charge as-is, the idea behind the book was to give the builder or property owner a starting point for their own architectural tastes. Between 1913, when Raney was on his own, and the beginning of 1917, when his partnership with Dumas ended, Raney designed commercial buildings and residences in Kansas City and nearby towns. One of his first commissions was a new house for Fred Harvey executive Roland H. Ford in the Swope Park area of Kansas City. The home was based on Raney's Parkview design from My Architect. Several of the trade buildings are now part of the McGee Street Automotive Historic District in Kansas City, including 1701-1705, 1817, and 1827 McGee Street. The district itself was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 20, 2018. Raney also designed the eastern addition of the Hesse Carriage Company Building at 1700 Oak Street, also on the National Register of Historic Places, which was commissioned in 1915 by Otto Hesse, son of William G. Hesse, the company's founder who had died in 1907. This second unit was to be a four-story building with its main facade facing Oak Street. Two stories were built in 1915, with the other two added in 1929. The Hesse Carriage Company, incorporated in 1903, specialized in carriages that were used as delivery vehicles for industries such as dairy, produce, bread, and ice. Otto Hesse and his partner Joseph Falk were able to segue their company into the automotive age by adapting their wagon bodies to fit automobile frames. The company became a leader in manufacturing custom bodies for automobiles and trucks. Auto Coach building In February 1917, Raney's partnership with Dumas dissolved and he formed a new partnership with Millard Filmore Botkin. Like Dumas, Botkin was not an architect; he listed his role with Raney as \\"Service Director.\\" The partnership was short-lived and ended mid-1917, possibly due to Botkin being drafted in the first wave of the Selective Service Act of 1917. During their association, Raney designed numerous residences and commercial buildings, including two more that have been included in the McGee Street Automotive Historic District (1725 and 1909 McGee Street) and the Auto Coach Building, also owned by Otto Hesse, at 1730-34 Oak Street.  Fred Harvey years  Raney continued to work on his own through July 1918, designing at least four more commercial buildings in Kansas City, three on McGee Street and one on Oak Street. Only the building on Oak Street is extant. Raney's World War I draft registration reports him as architect for employer Fred Harvey, so sometime between July 1918, when he was designing 1601 Oak Street, and September 1918, Raney was hired by Fred Harvey as their first staff architect. Prior to this time, the Harvey system and Santa Fe Railway had exclusively used outside architects such as Charles Whittlesey and Louis Curtiss for their building projects. In addition to his talent and experience, his prior contacts with Curtiss, Minnie and J.F. Huckel, and Roland Ford likely helped him get his foot in the door. Raney's Harvey career was temporarily interrupted, however, with the third round of registration for World War I on September 12, 1918, which required men ages 18 to 45 to register for the draft.\\"World War I Draft Registration Cards\\", US National Archives Raney fell into this category and was selected to serve. In 1919, he was listed in Houston, Texas, as a draftsman for the U.S. Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation.. In 1922, Raney was back with Fred Harvey, working with a young draftsman, William Raymond Ferris, who had been hired while Raney was in Texas. Ferris left the company in 1923 when he was invited to study at the Les Ecoles d'Art Am√©ricaines de Fontainebleau in Paris. In addition to Ferris, Raney was assisted over the course of his employment by a series of able, younger architects that included Charles O. Coverley, Emmett J. Corman, and Robert Lee Nusbaum. Following Fred Harvey's death in early 1901, Fred Harvey (the company) had been run by Ford Harvey, Fred's eldest son, from the Kansas City office located at Union Station in Kansas City. Ford's younger brother Byron went to Chicago, and managed the Santa Fe dining car division. The Kansas City office handled the hotels, restaurants, railroad station concessions, and Park Service buildings. During his employment, which lasted until 1942, Raney designed the following: # 1925 Chicago Union Station Shops and Concession Stands # 1926 Auto Camp Lodge, Grand Canyon South Rim # 1927 - 1928 Phantom Ranch Phase 2, Grand Canyon # 1927 St. Elizabeth Parish School, Kansas City (side project)Robert J.

Following his death, Byron was named president, but control of the company remained in Kansas City with Ford's son Freddy, and executives David Benjamin and J.F. Huckel. A chain of events over the next several years, however, changed things dramatically. David Benjamin died suddenly in 1933. Then in 1936, J.F. Huckel and Freddy Harvey died within weeks of each other, the latter in a horrible plane crash with his wife and dog on board. Katherine Harvey, who then had controlling shares of the company, was eventually forced to sell her shares to her uncle, Byron, who brought the main office to Chicago, something he had wanted to do for some time. Raney remained in Kansas City; his 1942 World War II draft registration, which lists his occupation as \\"Architect with Fred Harvey,\\" with a work address of \\"293 Union Station\\" indicates that the architectural division had not yet been relocated. Projects had dwindled however; so in 1943, Raney accepted a position as architect for the Santa Fe Railway's Gulf Coast subsidiary ( Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway) in Galveston, Texas and moved his family there.  Post Fred Harvey years  Raney remained in Galveston only a year or so. In 1944 he moved his family away from the coast to Temple, Texas, due in part to the weather (the 1943 \\"Surprise Hurricane\\" had hit the area on July 27, 1943) but also to the possibility of German U-boat activity in the Gulf Coast area. In 1946, following the war, Raney and his family moved back to Kansas City. In early May 1948, Byron Harvey, Jr. phoned Raney with regard to returning to Fred Harvey. Harvey's follow-up letter on May 6, 1948, confirmed the company was \\"going back to our former method of handling our architectural and designing problems; in other words, we will probably employ an interior decorator and architect-draftsman.\\" Byron wondered whether Raney would like to be considered for the position, which required a move to Chicago. Raney replied on May 10th that he was indeed interested, but hoped they would be able to come to an agreement that would allow him to stay in Kansas City. That agreement did not come to fruition; Raney remained in Kansas City, working alone through the 1950s, though he did partner with Donald F. Tuel briefly in the early part of the decade.  Personal life  Raney's first wife, Corinne, died from stomach cancer in 1930. In 1932, he married Edna Adele Schmid, who also worked at Fred Harvey as an executive secretary. She had been hired in 1927 by Ford Harvey in response to a recommendation from Horace Albright, whom she had worked for in Yellowstone National Park for about 18 months.Horace Albright, \\"Western Union to Adele Schmid Regarding Job Interview with Ford Harvey,\\" Telegram, (November 4, 1927), Robert and Adele Raney Papers, Private They had two daughters, Adele Ann (1933‚Äì2010) and Roberta Ruth (1936‚Äì1981). Between December 1962 and January 1963, Robert Raney was diagnosed with cancer of the esophagus. He died April 10, 1963.  Mary Colter's claims  Mary Colter claimed in her 1952 \\"Autobiographical Summary,\\" submitted to Alice V. Donahue, Director of Public Relations at Fred Harvey in Chicago, that she was hired as architect and decorator in 1902, and that she was the architect of many of the same structures that are listed here as having been designed by Robert Raney.Mary E. J. Colter, \\"Autobiographical Summary Furnished by Colter to the Fred Harvey Company,\\" 1952, Fred Harvey Company Collection, Heard Museum, Phoenix, Arizona Her story became legend when subsequent biographers cited her summary as fact. In 2015, Fred L. Shaw began doing in-depth research into her life using independent, contemporaneous, primary sources, unlike prior biographers who had relied only upon her Autobiographical Summary, documents whose source could only be traced to Colter herself, and interviews with people who had been associated with her either later in life, or from outside her work environment. Shaw's research revealed that she falsely claimed the work of three architects, Robert James Raney, Louis Curtiss, and Charles Whittlesey.

In the background are Herkomer's wife Anna, and also his patron the photographer Clarence Edmund Fry and members of Fry's family. Reception The painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1875. It was a critical and popular success, and a barrier was erected to protect it from the thronging crowd, the fourth time the rare honour had been accorded in four years: it was needed in 1874 for Luke Fildes's Applicants for Admission to a Casual Ward and Lady Butler's The Roll Call , and in 1871 for William Powell Frith's The Salon d'Or, Homburg. Previous examples include Frith's The Derby Day in 1858 and David Wilkie's Chelsea Pensioners reading the Waterloo Dispatch in 1822. Among those who admired the painting was Vincent van Gogh, who collected several prints by Herkomer while he was living in London from 1873 to 1875. The Last Muster inspired Van Gogh's 1882 pencil drawing Worn Out and his 1890 painting At Eternity's Gate. Herkomer's painting was bought for ¬£1,200 by Clarence Edmund Fry, and exhibited at the business premises of Elliott & Fry on Baker Street, where the paintings were displayed alongside their photographs to demonstrate their artistic merit. The work made Herkomer internationally famous. It won a gold Medaille d'Honneur at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1878: the only other English painter similarly recognised at the exhibition was John Everett Millais. After Herkomer won the gold medal in Paris, Arthur Turrell made a mezzotint after the painting for Pilgeram and Lef√®vre. Copyright was registered in the US by Knoedler in 1878. Herkomer was made a chevalier of the l√©gion d'honneur in 1879, ennobled by King Otto of Bavaria in 1899 (adding \\"von\\" to his name), and knighted in England in 1907. The painting sold to the stockbroker and accountant William Cuthbert Quilter in 1881, and it was then exhibited at the Munich International Exposition in 1883, at the Whitechapel Fine Art Exhibition in 1885, at the Royal Jubilee Exhibition in Manchester in 1887, and at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. It was sold at auction in 1909 for ¬£3,000, and bought at Christie's in 1923 by William Lever, 1st Viscount Leverhulme for the newly-opened Lady Lever Art Gallery in Port Sunlight, where it remains.

Findlay describes herself as an 'appearance activist', and has been outspoken on a number of disability-related issues. She has been particularly vocal on the right to privacy of children with a disability as well as the importance of representation and inclusiveness of disabled people both in general life, and particularly in fashion. Findlay makes use of social media to document her love of fashion, food, as well as the treatment, physical pain, and ableism she faces because she has ichthyosis, a rare genetic disorder that affects her skin and hair. She has built a business and personal brand around her identity as a disabled woman.  Biography   Early life  Findlay's parents courted illegally for four years in South Africa during the Apartheid and moved to Australia in order to marry in 1981. Her mother Jeanette was classified as coloured South African, while her father Roger was an Englishman. Findlay was born on 8 December 1981 in Albury, New South Wales, three weeks pre-mature and was diagnosed with a form of the genetic disease ichthyosis: congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma. When she was three weeks old, Findlay was admitted to The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, where she was placed in intensive care for three months.  Education  The Findlay family moved from Albury to a small village Walla Walla before she started preschool. Findlay attended Walla Walla Primary School and when she was 10 years old was diagnosed with a different form of ichthyosis, Netherton syndrome through genetic testing. Findlay attended Murray High School in Albury and, during her final year, started working at a local Kmart department store. Findlay spent much of her childhood in hospital, and recalls feeling more comfortable with hospital staff than her fellow students. Findlay studied at La Trobe University in Wodonga and in 2002 graduated with a Bachelor of eCommerce. She moved to Melbourne in 2003 to work for the Australian Public Service and completed her Masters of Communication from RMIT University from 2005 to 2012.  Career  From February 2003 to November 2017, Findlay was employed by the Australian Public Service and from September 2016 to May 2017, held the position of Communication Coordinator for People with Disability Australia Inc. In 2012 and 2013, Findlay had three encounters with taxi drivers that lead her to make a complaint to the Victorian Taxi Commission and the Australian Human Rights Commission. The drivers in questions refused to transport Findlay, making comments on her appearance, alleged intoxication, and smell, and claiming she would damage their vehicle. After the third incident, Findlay lodged a complaint with the taxi company as did the hotel concierge who booked the taxi for her. When no action was taken, she complained to the Victorian Taxi Commission and the Australian Human Rights Commission. Her complaint, and subsequent input, resulted in improvements to the disability training provided to taxi drivers in Victoria. On 9 May 2015, Findlay hosted the first Australian Ichthyosis meet up, in partnership with the Genetic Support Network of Australia, as part of Ichthyosis Awareness Month and of the 75 attendees, 23 had ichthyosis. ‚ÄúSome of the attendees had never met anyone else with the condition before. This event was life changing ‚Äì my parents tell me it was the best day of their life,‚Äù Findlay said. Findlay has had a number of speaking gigs, both individually and as a part of event panels including Women of Letters, opening for Julia Gillard at Layne Beachley's Women in Leadership luncheon, Progress 2017, University of Western England, ProBlogger, Melbourne Writers Festival, Emerging Writers Festival, Dangerous Ideas around Disability and the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Findlay also regularly appears on podcasts and radio programs. Findlay has made a number of media appearances that placed her in the spotlight and helped establish her position as a disability and appearance spokesperson. In 2017 Findlay appeared on the ABC television series You Can't Ask That and Cyber Hate with Tara Moss, and in 2018 she appeared on Channel Ten's The Project in response to an interview with Jon Faine on ABC Radio. On 28 March 2018, Findlay had appeared on ABC Radio's morning show to discuss microagressions and disability. During the interview, the host Jon Faine described Findlay as looking like a ‚Äúburns victim‚Äù and having a face that wouldn't ‚Äúbe good at Halloween‚Äù, before asking about her sex life. Faine's line of questioning has been described by commentators and the public as ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù, ‚Äúdisrespectful‚Äù and ‚Äúinappropriate‚Äù, while they described Findlay's reaction as ‚Äúcomposed‚Äù and ‚Äúpolite‚Äù. Faine apologised but later mentioned the incident had contributed to his retirement. Findlay attributes much of her success to her appearance on You Can't Ask That in particular, and she took advantage of her appearance to show the audience how rude and uncomfortable it is when people ask intrusive questions about her facial difference. In 2018, Findlay started promoting her upcoming book at a number of writers festivals across Australia, including the Feminist Writers Festival, Bendigo Writers Festival and at five events during the Melbourne Writers Festival, including a spoken word performance as part of the Quippings: Disability Unleashed theatre group. Findlay is currently the Access and Inclusion Coordinator for the Melbourne Fringe Festival as well as providing customised disability awareness, social media and blogging training to organisations. She also co-hosts a podcast called Refreshments Provided with Jason Scott Watkins.  Access to Fashion  As a self-proclaimed fashion lover, Findlay was dissatisfied with the lack of representation people with disabilities have in the media and fashion landscape. Propelled by her own experience of exclusion and elitism in fashion, in July 2018 she announced the first-ever disability-inclusive event to be held as part of Melbourne Fashion Week. \\"We're not treated the same when we go into stores. For me, I am sometimes not even spoken to. They think I am not going to want their clothes or their service, or they might be embarrassed to be seen with me,‚Äù Findlay said. 'Access to Fashion - Disability on the Runway: an Exploration of Disability Inclusion in the Fashion Industry' was held on 1 September 2018, and included a panel discussion as well as a runway show. Findlay ensured the event was accessible to all and that it featured a diverse range of models and fashion designers with disabilities. ‚ÄúIf you're not invited to the party, invite yourself. So I did. I pitched to Melbourne Fashion Week because it was my dream to be involved in this and to have a space for disabled people to walk the catwalk...I want the fashion industry to take note that we are here and to embed us in everything they do...We have so much to give to the industry if only people would let us in,‚Äù Findlay said. Although part of Melbourne Fashion Week, Findlay received no funding for the show and launched a gofundme page to pay for promotions and ensure the models, makeup artists, photographers, catering, and producers were paid for their time. Despite her initial concerns, Findlay was able to exceed her initial fundraising goal of $5000 goal within 12 days with $9655 raised in total. Within a month of being announced, the event was sold out and had received over 90 applications from people with disabilities who wished to model in the show. Due to the capacity crowd, the runway show and panel were both live streamed so those who could not attend or missed out on tickets could still participate.  Writing  Findlay was a writer from a young age, and started her self-titled blog in 2009. Findlay's blog details significant events in her life, her experience of life with ichthyosis, and her commentary as an appearance activist. Findlay has written for a variety of online and traditional media, including the ABC, SBS, Sydney Morning Herald, The Guardian, The Age, Essential Baby, Kidspot, Ravishly, Frankie Magazine, and Mamamia. After a journalist dubbed Findlay an appearance activist, she claimed the title and has since written on a range of topics related to appearance diversity and disabilities in general. Her writing also appears in Bec Sparrow's Ask Me Anything and Tara Moss' Speaking Out. She was also included in 200 Women who will change the way you will see the world.  Representation  A common theme of Findlay's work is the importance of representation of people of diverse appearance in the media, fashion, and general life. She takes ‚Äúback the [ableist] gaze through social media‚Äù and her blog, using them as a platform to promote disability issues, her love of fashion, ableism and the treatment and pain she experiences in association with her disability. Part of Findlay's push for representation is the need for disabled people to control how their stories are told, stopping disability being a tragedy or a burden to be overcome, and a push against so- called inspiration porn. ‚ÄúIn fairy tales, the characters who look different are often cast as the villain or monsters. It's only when they shed their unconventional skin that they are seen as 'good' or less frightening. There are very few stories where the character that looks different is the hero of the story ... I've been the hero of my story - telling it on my own terms, proud about my facial difference and disability, not wanting a cure for my rare, severe and sometimes confronting skin condition, and knowing that I am beautiful even though I don't have beauty privilege.‚Äù  Privacy  The right to privacy for both children and adults with disability is an important facet of Findlay's writing. Findlay has said she is grateful to her parents for not sharing her story without her consent and has taken issue with individual parents and parenting groups who have ‚Äúovershared‚Äù their children's stories. She explored this topic in one of her performances at the 2018 Melbourne Writers Festival. ‚ÄúI'm constantly horrified at the level of oversharing and ableism that I see among some parents ‚Ä¶ The urge to raise awareness should never be greater than the urge to maintain dignity of a disabled adult or child.‚Äù  Identity  For Findlay, disability is a more central aspect of her identity than her racial background and she embraces the term 'disabled person' rather than 'person with a disability'. ‚ÄúOften when I write about disability and use the term 'disabled', people (strangers) correct me. They do so as they see disability as a bad thing ... Many disabled people see disability as part of our identity - just like race, sexuality, religion, gender etc. and that's ok. And many disabled people don't, and that's ok too. We can choose how to identify. And 'disabled' and 'disability' are not bad words.‚Äù Findlay says that she did not identify as having a disability until her mid-twenties, but doing so has given her a sense of confidence and a community. ‚ÄúGiving myself the labels of 'disabled' and 'chronically ill' has been very empowering. I feel great sense of belonging ‚Äì and that's as big a relief as a diagnosis is. It's given me pride. I am proud to belong to an amazing, talented, diverse, passionate community that's committed to improving the lives of others.‚Äù  Say Hello  After receiving five publication offers, on 3 July 2017, Findlay signed a book deal with Harper Collins. 'Say Hello' is expected to be launched in January 2019. Findlay wrote that ‚ÄúSay Hello will be the book I needed to read when I was younger. I didn't have any role models with my condition until I searched the internet in my teens. There were no memoirs on ichthyosis ‚Äì only medical textbooks with people's faces blacked out.‚Äù The book is expected to be a memoir of Findlay's life experience as a woman with ichthyosis as well as her journey to identifying as a disabled person and the struggles and confusion she experienced before reaching that point. Findlay hopes the book helps those who also have ichthyosis, their parents, young women and teachers. ‚ÄúThere was no one in media or books who looked like me, or to tell me it's ok to not want to change my appearance, and I didn't know whether I'd find love ‚Äì love with another or love for myself. It's time to write that book. To be the person Little Carly needed.‚Äù Growing Up Disabled in Australia Findlay is editing Growing Up Disabled in Australia - part of Black Inc Books' Growing Up... anthology series. It will be released on 2 June 2020. Growing Up Disabled in Australia is the fifth book in the highly acclaimed, bestselling Growing Up series. It includes interviews with prominent Australians such as Senator Jordon Steele-John and Paralympian Isis Holt, poetry and graphic art, as well as more than 40 original pieces by writers with a disability or chronic illness.

History Lucinda Hinsdale Stone The Ladies' Library Association of Kalamazoo (LLA) grew from a reading group first organized in 1844. One of the original organizers was Lucinda Hinsdale Stone. During the mid-19th century the LLA provided library services to the local residents. Yearly subscriptions cost fifty cents and were available to both men and women, however only women could be members of the organization. The collection expanded, first being housed in members houses, to the Kalamazoo County Courthouse and then Corporation Hall. In addition to creating Kalamazoo's first lending library, the LLA activities have included advocating for the right for women to vote, the creation of day nurseries for working mothers, founding Kalamazoo's first art club, and establishing a community education program for women.

He was Director of the Macau Liaison Office, a ministerial-level position, until he fell to his death from his residence in October 2018. He formerly served as Deputy Director of the International Liaison Department of the Communist Party of China, Vice Governor of Fujian Province, and secretary- general of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC). Zheng was a member of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and a delegate to the 13th National People's Congress.  Life and career  Zheng was born in September 1959 in Beijing, China. He graduated from the University of Oslo with a degree in Norwegian language, and received diplomatic training at the University of Oxford from 1996 to 1997. (Note: Google translates this title as 'Zheng Xiaosong, director of the Macau Liaison Office, crashed into a high-frequency word') For most of his career Zheng served in diplomatic and international finance positions, including first- grade secretary of the Western Europe Bureau of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Director of the International Department of the Chinese Ministry of Finance, Assistant Finance Minister, and Chinese Executive Director of the Asian Development Bank. Zheng was promoted to major political posts after Party General Secretary Xi Jinping came to power in 2012. He was appointed Vice Governor of Fujian Province in July 2013, and later became a member of the standing committee and secretary-general of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC). In 2016, Zheng was transferred back to Beijing to serve as Deputy Director of the International Liaison Department of the Communist Party of China. A month before the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), he was promoted to Director of the Macau Liaison Office, a ministerial-level position in charge of relations between the central government and the Macau Special Administrative Region. He was elected as a member of the 19th Central Committee of the CPC.  Death  On 20 October 2018, Zheng died in Macau after falling from a tall building where he lived. He was 59. The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office in Beijing issued a statement saying that he had suffered from depression, with the implication that he had committed suicide. On Chinese social media many expressed concern and sadness about his depression, but others noted that at least 7 other Chinese officials have fallen from buildings this year, with one injured and at least 6 dead. Although there is no evidence that Zheng was suspected of corruption, in recent years hundreds of mid-level Chinese officials accused of corruption have died, reportedly by suicide, although observers have doubted such accounts. Agencies contributed to this report. Allegation related to visit by Xi Jinping Zheng died just days before the 23 October opening of the Hong Kong‚ÄìZhuhai‚ÄìMacau Bridge, the world's longest sea crossing linking Macau and Hong Kong. Bruce Lui Ping-kuen, convener of Hong Kong's Independent Commentators Association, claimed that in order to avoid speculation that might disturb Party General Secretary Xi Jinping's visit for the opening of the bridge, Beijing had been too quick to conclude that Zheng had died while suffering from depression, a conclusion they announced even before the completion of the investigation by the Macao police.. Such reported suicides have been much more common during Xi's leadership than during that of his predecessor Hu Jintao. The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, which announced that his death had been due to depression, has been investigated for corruption since 2016 by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and criticized by it for its \\"six sins\\", and other Hong Kong and Macao official organizations have also been suspected of corruption.

Tuttle had no formal education in design, instead drawing influence from his own experience and the mentorship of well known designers such as Alvin Lustig, Welton Becket, and Frank Lloyd Wright. Tuttle designed furniture for over 50 years, resulting in a body of work that included both manufactured and custom made furniture. Early life Tuttle was born in St. Louis, Missouri, growing up during the Great Depression. As a young man, he served in India during World War II. Upon his return, Tuttle applied to the Art Center School in Los Angeles, but was not accepted. Despite this, he decided to audit a class there taught by Alvin Lustig. His talent was noticed by the instructor, who hired Tuttle to work in his studio. Career The \\"Z\\" chair, originally known as the \\"Rocket Launcher\\" for which Paul Tuttle won the Carson Pirie Scott Young Designer Award. Tuttle started out working in the studio of designer Alvin Lustig in Los Angeles. He soon received the Frank Lloyd Wright Taliesin West Fellowship, an apprenticeship program with mentorship from Wright himself. Tuttle moved to Taliesin West in Scottsdale, Arizona, and impressed Wright during his short stay of four months. Tuttle then moved back to Los Angeles and worked on furniture building by himself awhile, before serving as an apprentice to architecture firms Welton Becket & Associates and Thornton Ladd & Associates. As an apprentice, Tuttle worked on interior design. In 1956, Tuttle moved to Santa Barbara where he met Hans Grether, owner of the Swiss pharmaceutical company Doestch, Grether & Cie. Grether hired Tuttle as a design consultant shortly thereafter. In 1966 Tuttle gave a solo exhibition at the Pasadena Art Museum, cementing his position as a leading American designer. He also won the first ever Carson Pirie Scott Young Designer Award for the popular \\"Z\\" Chair in 1966. The design for the \\"Z\\" Chair, originally known as the \\"Rocket Launcher\\" would become Tuttle's most well known work. Tuttle was hired by Strassle in 1967 as a designer, and subsequently spent half his time abroad in Switzerland until he left the position in 1983. In 1978, Tuttle's work was featured in a solo exhibit called \\"Paul Tuttle, Designer\\" at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art. After leaving his designer position at Strassle, Tuttle continued at Strassle on a royalty only basis, but concentrated on his custom work in Santa Barbara. In 1982, Tuttle partnered with Bud Tullis to produce custom furniture, primarily for collectors. Between 1982 and 2001, Tuttle's custom work was at its height, resulting in the creation of over 200 pieces of furniture. A 2001 retrospective entitled \\"Paul Tuttle Designs\\" at the University of California, Santa Barbara showcased Tuttle's body of work. Tuttle died on August 2, 2002, in Santa Barbara. Style Tuttle was known for sleek, elegant, and refined modern furniture, as well as combining materials like metal, leather, and glass. Tuttle began designing furniture in the 1950s, and his style was heavily influenced by the modernist style of mentor Alvin Lustig. Tuttle followed the modernist ideal of minimalism, eschewing decorative ornamentation on his furniture. His work emphasized the materials he used and he sought to reflect the essence of function in his pieces.

These movements both individually and collectively, have historically been small in their numbers and have not been well organised. With a culture of war in the early history of Germany, pacifism was not a culturally significant group. This was driven by the government as they attempted to use the media in order to promote the expansion of Germany as a growing empire. The exception to this is during the Cold War with the Bonn demonstration with a large turnout of around 300,000 people. Christian peace groups have been the most consistent groups within the classification of pacifists as an opposition to violence is a key part of their faith. The size, whilst remaining small varies over the history of the Federal Republic of Germany. The reception from the public regarding pacifists also changes depending on the historical period.  Historical Periods   Imperial Germany (1871‚Äì1914)  With the unification of Germany as a single state, the country began to expand militarily as an international power, which in turn created a pacifist movement in Germany. This first movement was called the German Peace Society and was founded in 1892. However, the movement was small with only 10,000 active members at its peak, as it did not resonate with the wider population who was in favour of the German expansion. With relatively low support the ability of the movement to grow was limited to the ability to speak freely which was later limited due to the government declaring a state of war. The rapid military expansion of Germany was also largely popular with the population. The movement, prior to the outbreak of war began to decline in support for the movement as the public support of a war grew and avoid a response from the government. During this time there were two Hague Peace Conferences, these conferences resulted in various multi-lateral treaties regarding military expansion and foreign policy. The conference was also about establishing the universal values and therefore the obligations of states. In 1899 there was a Hauge Peace Conference, however, Germany did not attend, and it was not until the 1907 conference where Germany would participate. At this conference Germany was considered uncooperative, which was due to the restrictions on their ability to expand their military power. Also, as Germany was a rising power there was a hesitation to reduce their expansion as it would restrict their self-defence capabilities.  World War One Germany (1914‚Äì1918)  German Pacifism was not as organised in this era when compared to that of Cold War Germany; however, a large number of groups adopted pacifist attitudes, which evolved throughout the war. During this period a group of female war opponents emerged, which was a pacifist group who were opposed to the war as it was, according to this group, caused by masculine values and attitudes. This group also overlapped with the group of advocates for women‚Äôs‚Äô rights during the same period, as well as the socialist movement. This activism from female groups was the result of changing cultural, political and social roles of women which had developed during the war. Early in the war attitudes towards war were very positive, this along with the conscription of German soldiers resulted in the pacifists‚Äô movement remaining a relatively small group. As the country was in a state of war, the government was heavily involved in censorship of the population, so the pacifist publications were censored to not have views which directly opposed the government, rather they would be written in order to talk about the wider issue of war with other countries having the primary role at the beginning of war. The government remained lenient towards those with pacifist attitudes which contrasts the government attitude of the Nazi Government and other governments which enacted the concept of total war on the home front. In 1915 at the Hague, the Women's Peace Conference met to discuss methods to end the war through negotiations. Attending this event was four German delegates. After this conference, the government began to restrict pacifists and their groups as there was a consensus that this conference had weakened the position of Germany for negotiations. Towards the end of the war, the public support massively declines, which resulted in an increase in the support for pacifist ideas, despite this the movement remained small in size. At this time the government tried to assert more control over the home front in order to provide more resources for soldiers on the front line. With the Russian Revolution, the pacifist movement also gained support and inspiration through the Marxist ideology behind the revolution. The literature during the war was restricted and the literature that was promoted all displayed similar views. These views support the war effort which was achieved through the justification of the war, as well as the celebration of acts of heroism and sacrifice. Pacifist literature was virtually non-existent during this time period which continued until the end of the war before it became more widely discussed in the literature.  World War Two Germany (1939‚Äì1945)  The existence of pacifists in Germany is at its lowest and least organised during this time, as a result of the Nazi Government‚Äôs policies regarding movements which oppose their regime. Pacifists during this time are mostly individuals, who may not necessarily be a part of a formalised group, rather they act out the ideology of pacifism. A key reason for this was the continued support of the war effort as well as public support for the Fuhrer of Germany, Adolf Hitler remaining high throughout the war. This period was also when popular support for pacifism was at its lowest as there was significant support for the war effort. As Nazism was built on the outcome of the First World War, there was significant pro-war sentiment in the ideology as a means of resolving the issues which occurred after the war. This was in opposition to the pacifist ideology which was one reason for the Nazi response to Pacifist groups and individuals during the course of the Second World War. The atrocities of the Second World War also inspired the pacifist movement after the end of the war.  Cold War Germany (1945‚Äì1990)  The pacifist movement was at its most popular during the Cold War era. This is evident as a peace protest at Bonn occurred in 1981 which was a demonstration against the production of nuclear weapons and the militarism of the NATO alliance system. The reason for the popularity was the outcome of the First and Second World War, as the significant loss of lives shifted the culture towards militarism in Germany. Another key issue which was protested was the ability of the United States government to use West German weapons without consulting the West German government. The event had approximately 300,000 people attend, which was a significant number for a pacifist event in West Germany, as it contrasts the historical size of the pacifist movements. This event was made up of 700 individual groups which protested together with the common link of the pacifist ideology. Another factor which influenced the size of the Bonn demonstration was the NATO plan to introduce intermediate-range theatre nuclear forces (INF) into Germany as a part of their military arsenal. This debate was a prominent part of West German discourse during 1957 and 1958. The main concerns around the policy were the implications for domestic and international responsibilities as a nuclear state. The SPD initially opposed this proposition; however, they made a concession to introduce a military without nuclear capabilities. The following election the SPD lost to the Christian Democrats, which resulted in the SPD reforming their party and their ideology. The part ideology after the reform, resembled Marxism as pacifism became an integral part of the party. Western Germany had a much greater presence of pacifists than Eastern Germany. Christian-moral ethics were the driver of the movement, however, not all pacifists were Christian. While these Christian movements and groups have historically been the only consistent pacifists, this era saw the rise in pacifists not from the Christian faith. From the 1960s, there was a significant increase in student protests as part of the pacifist movement. Unions were also another group which became heavily involved in pacifism during this time. Even during its most popular stage, pacifism was not a characteristic of either political wing. The policy of disarmament was also a heavily discussed policy at the time and the pacifist movement was advocating for the adoption of this policy.  Contemporary Germany (1990‚ÄìPresent)  The foreign policy of Contemporary Germany has been more pacifist than those of the previous historical eras. This is driven primarily by the history of German during the First and Second World Wars, as there was a significant loss of lives as a result of the perception of pacifism by the wider population. The use of force rarely occurs unless there is a need for humanitarian intervention, which is derived from the United Nations principle of collective security. One example of the government use of pacifism is demonstrated in their response to the United States‚Äô declaration of war on Iraq, as they were the first allied nation to condemn the decision and decide against participating in the war. This damaged bi-lateral relations between the nations and was a significant moment for modern German foreign policy and its reliance on pacifism. There was no bi-partisan support for pacifism as it was primarily linked to the left-wing parties, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and The Greens. The German government also abstained from participating in Kosovo War which was another war NATO participated in without German military support. After the Rwandan Genocide and the Bosnian War, the left-wing German parties allowed for military intervention on the basis of humanitarian reasons, while their right-wing counterparts believed in the strategic use of force for foreign policy. The NATO intervention during the later stages of the Yugoslavia Wars demonstrated this movement towards military intervention on the basis of humanitarian reasons. This was voted on by the two major left-wing parties the SPD and The Greens, who voted 75% and 50% in favour of the humanitarian intervention. The use of pacifism has changed as the major German political parties‚Äô ideologies and positions change over time. During the 1990s there was limited agreement on whether the German government should oppose the use of force. However, from the early 2000s, the left-leaning parties have evolved to adopt policies of pacifism and an opposition to participating in the war. While the right-wing Christian-Democratic party has adopted a policy stating that Germany should be capable of defending itself through the use of military force. During this same era, Germany has consolidated its economic and political power over Europe, making the impact of their foreign policy significant. The non- intervention in the Syrian Civil War shows how despite humanitarian intervention allowing for military action, the German government is still unlikely to use military force. With the Annexation of Crimea Russia has shown an aggressive use of military force in their conduct of foreign policy which provides the German Government with difficulties maintaining their pacifist ideology as the breach of human rights has had little impact on the Russian foreign policy, which is considered to be the result of Germany pacifism to some extent.

The dam removal in 2013, along with sediment removal, narrowed the river to , giving the city access to of previously-submerged shoreline. The parks have helped revitalize the city's downtown area. Attributes The park follows the curve of the Scioto River on its western bank. The Oval, an open green space, was underwater prior to the Main Street Dam removal in 2013. The park features an amphitheater and fountains. Public artwork and monuments include Celebration of Life, the Columbus Police Memorial, several works as part of Scioto Lounge, and the statue of Lucas Sullivant. The river bank features a riparian zone, a natural line of plants along the river, keeping soil from eroding into the water.

After an initial period of stabilization of band members and musical style (1985-1987), they entered the music scene with their first single \\"P√°r f√≠gl≈Ø\\" in 1988. Over the next sixteen years, the band released seven studio albums, two concert albums, and one compilation album. On 2 October 2004, the group entered a \\"planned creative break\\" that ended in December 2012. History Formation and breakup Lucie was founded by guitarist Robert Kodym and bass guitarist Petr (B≈ôetislav) Chovanec (P.B.CH.), who had been performing together in the band Pr√°≈°ek. They eventually came up with the idea to form their own band. It was the year 1985, and the duo added Tom√°≈° Waschinger on drums. They wrote a number of new songs, one of which was the hit \\"Lucie\\", which was later included on their self-titled debut album. The band was joined by Petr Franc on keyboards, and the last member became Michal Penk, on vocals. Several band members were getting better deals elsewhere, however, and Kodym, P.B.CH., and Michal Penk all gradually left the group. At this point, the early stage of Lucie ended. Early albums and hiatus Less than a year after the band's breakup, a revival was organized, with David Koller on vocals and drums. Keyboardist Petr Franc was replaced by Michal Dvo≈ô√°k, and Tom√°≈° Waschinger left to perform military service. The band at this point consisted of guitarists Robert Kodym and P.B.CH., keyboardist Michal Dvo≈ô√°k, and singer/drummer David Koller. Thus, the band Lucie was reborn in its present incarnation. In 1988, the band played their first concert at the Chmelnice club in Prague. In June 1989, the still-unknown band played at the \\"Zastav To\\" concert at ≈Ωof√≠n Palace on Slavonic Island in Prague. In June 1990, Lucie's self-titled first album was released, and went on to win a Gold Record. In the same year, Lucie helped symbolically escort out the last Russian soldier at a sold-out stadium show. The band's second studio album, In the Sky, came out in 1991. This helped Lucie become the most popular band in the country,Jan Velinger, \\"Lucie - One of the Definitive Czech Bands of the '90s\\", Radio Praha, 30 November 2008 and they solidified this position with their victory in the Czech Grammys, the Annual Czechoslovak Music Awards (today known as the Andƒõl Awards) . Following the Lucie Live! tour of 1992 and the release of the live double album, the paths of the individual members diverged again. Return The band did not reunite until 1993, this time without P.B.CH., who had decided to continue on a solo path. He was replaced by the Slovak bass player Marek Min√°rik. The new album ƒåern√Ω koƒçky mokr√Ω ≈æ√°by, the band's heaviest up to that point, came out in 1994. That year Lucie triumphed at the Czech Grammys, winning 5 awards in total. They followed this with a one-year break. At the end of 1996, they released the album Pohyby and launched a massive tour. In 1996 Lucie also celebrated their 10th anniversary, and went back into the studio to work on their next album. The band's success was confirmed in 1996 and 1997 when they won bronze awards in the recently relaunched ƒåesk√Ω slav√≠k (Czech nightingale) (successor to Zlat√Ω slav√≠k) awards. After they released the album Vƒõt≈°√≠ ne≈æ mal√© mno≈æstv√≠ l√°sky, they were rejoined by former bass player P.B.CH. Following that year's concert tour, the band's popularity rose again and culminated in a silver award at ƒåesk√Ω slav√≠k. The album Vƒõt≈°√≠ ne≈æ mal√© mno≈æstv√≠ l√°sky raised controversy with the songs \\"Medv√≠dek\\" and \\"Panic\\". It went on to become their best-selling record to date, partly due to TV Nova's refusal to play the controversial song \\"Medv√≠dek\\", which supposedly promoted the distribution and use of illicit drugs. In 1999, the group released their first compilation album, V≈°e nejlep≈°√≠ 88‚Äì99, and for the first time reached gold status in the ƒåesk√Ω slav√≠k awards. New millennium, new album In 2000, the band released the album Sluneƒçnice and got ready to tour the Czech Republic and the United States. After the tour, Lucie secured their gold status in ƒåesk√Ω slav√≠k and prepared another album, which was released in October 2002, with the title Dobr√° koƒçzka kter√° nemls√°. In the years 2001 and 2002, the band maintained their top spot in ƒåesk√Ω slav√≠k, for the third and fourth time. In 2003, keyboardist Michal Dvo≈ô√°k was fired and replaced by guitarist Tom√°≈° Varteck√Ω (Wanastowi Vjecy, Kollerband, Daniel Landa). The recording of the live performance of Lucie in the Opera was released in 2004 as a double album, and the band performed several acoustic concerts in the Czech Republic, England, and the USA. In 2003 and 2004 Lucie won awards (silver and bronze, respectively) in ƒåesk√Ω slav√≠k for the last time. Present At the turn of the year 2005, a new album was expected, but David Koller, Robert Kodym, and P.B.CH. began to diverge musically, and these differences climaxed with Koller's departure from the band. \\"I found out about his departure just like anyone else, from the Czech News Agency,\\" said Kodym. The media speculated on the breakup of the group, and its future was uncertain. On 23 February 2011, the band in its best-known incarnation (Dvo≈ô√°k, Kodym, Koller, P.B.CH.) took part in the 20th annual Andƒõl Awards (Andƒõl 2010), gathering on stage together in order to receive the title Best Album in Twenty Years (ƒåern√Ω koƒçky mokr√Ω ≈æ√°by, accepted by Koller and Dvo≈ô√°k), Best Band in Twenty Years (Kodym and P.B.CH. went to receive it and were joined by Koller and Dvo≈ô√°k), and finally, Best Artist in Twenty Years (received by the whole band). At the end of 2011, Kodym stated that he did not rule out the possibility of Lucie's return to the stage. The other members confirmed a possible return. This reunion was anticipated to take place in 2013 ‚Äî 2014. A private concert was held on 7 December 2012 in Prague's Rudolfinum auditorium, this being the first time in almost 10 years that the band performed on the same stage in its most notable lineup . Two days later, Lucie officially confirmed that they would be \\"rehearsing\\" together in the spring of 2013 during Kapka nadƒõje charity concerts. Kapka nadƒõje is a charity fund organized to help sick children, especially those suffering from hemopoiesis, cancer, and children whose disease requires bone marrow transplants.Ian Willoughby, \\"Lucie Perform to 16,000 in First of Three Shows in Prague on Comeback Tour\\", Radio Praha, 11 June 2014 A new studio album, EvoLucie, was released on 9 November 2018, and the band went on the road to promote it with an indoor tour of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.Ruth Fra≈àkov√°, Libor Kukal, \\"Popular Czech Band Lucie Makes a Comeback\\", Radio Praha, 26 August 2018 Band members Current members * Robert Kodym ‚Äì guitars, vocals * P.B.CH. ‚Äì bass guitar * David Koller ‚Äì drums, vocals, acoustic guitars * Michal Dvo≈ô√°k ‚Äì keyboards, synthesizers Touring members * Adam Koller ‚Äì drums * Lenka Dusilov√° ‚Äì guitars, vocals Past members * Marek Min√°rik ‚Äì bass guitar * Michal Penk ‚Äì vocals * Petr Franc ‚Äì keyboards * Tom√°≈° Waschinger ‚Äì drums * Tom√°≈° Marek ‚Äì drums, percussion * Tom√°≈° Varteck√Ω ‚Äì guitars * Pavel Pl√°nka ‚Äì percussion Discography Studio albums * Lucie (Tomm√º Records; re-issued by B&M; Music, 1990) * In the Sky (Gang Records; re-issued by B&M; Music, 1991) * ƒåern√Ω koƒçky mokr√Ω ≈æ√°by (B&M; Music, 1994) * Pohyby (B&M; Music, 1996) * Vƒõt≈°√≠ ne≈æ mal√© mno≈æstv√≠ l√°sky (B&M; Music, 1998) * Sluneƒçnice (B&M; Music, 2000) * Dobr√° koƒçzka kter√° nemls√° (B&M; Music / Universal Music, 2002) * EvoLucie (2018) Compilation albums * V≈°e nejlep≈°√≠ 88‚Äì99 (B&M; Music, 1999) * The best of (Universal Music, 2009) * Platinum Combo 1990-2013 (Universal Music, 2013) Live albums * Lucie Live! red and blue albums (2CD) (Gang Records 1992; re-issued by B&M; Music, 1998) * Lucie v ope≈ôe 2CD (Sony BMG, 2003) Singles * \\"P√°r f√≠gl≈Ø\\" (Supraphon, 1988) (B-side: \\"To jsem j√°\\") * \\"Dotknu se ohnƒõ\\" (Supraphon, 1989) (B-side: \\"Nech to st√°t\\") * \\"Troubit na trumpety by se n√°m l√≠bilo\\" (Supraphon, 1989) * \\"Amerika\\" (1994) * \\"V≈°echno ti d√°v√°m\\" (1996) * \\"Klobouk ve k≈ôov√≠\\" (1997) * \\"Pohyby\\" (1997) * \\"Sv√≠t√°n√≠\\" (1998) * \\"Panic\\" (1998) * \\"Medv√≠dek / Sv√≠t√°n√≠\\" (1998) * \\"M√≠t tƒõ s√°m (Remaster '99) / ≈†rouby do hlavy (Remaster '99)\\" (1999) * \\"Zakousnutej do tebe\\" (2001) * \\"Hvƒõzda (radio edit)\\" (2001) * \\"Srdce\\" (2002) * \\"Pod mƒõdƒõn√Ωm nebem\\" (2003) * \\"Medv√≠dek 2016\\" (2015) Video albums * Obrazohled aneb dalek√° cesta VHS (B&M; Music, 1998) * Pohyby ‚Äì live DVD (B&M; Music, 1998) * Lucie v ope≈ôe DVD (Sony BMG, 2004) Books * Dƒõdek, Honza.

It didn't reach the front until March, 1942, assigned to the 22nd Army in Kalinin Front. It served under these commands for the next year, then was pulled out of the line for rebuilding before being moved south to 3rd Army of Bryansk Front, and later Belorussian Front, for the 1943 summer offensive, during which it was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. It served in 50th Army during Operation Bagration, and earned a battle honor during the crossings of the upper Dniepr River near Shklov, but was soon reassigned to 33rd Army, where it remained for the duration of the war. The 362nd ended the war deep into Germany with 1st Belorussian Front, but in spite of an exemplary record of service, including three unit decorations, it was disbanded shortly thereafter. Formation The division began forming on August 10, 1941, at Omsk in the Siberian Military District.Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 79 It shared much of its early history with the 364th Rifle Division. Its partial order of battle was as follows: * 1206th Rifle Regiment * 1208th Rifle Regiment * 1210th Rifle Regiment * 936th Artillery Regiment The division's first commander, Col. Ivan Poluektovich Arkhipov, was assigned on October 10.A typo in Commanders of Corps and Divisions gives his assignment date as January 10, 1941. By that date it had 9,951 officers and men under command. The division took a remarkably long time to reach the front; it was first assigned to the 58th (Reserve) Army, which was also forming in the Siberian District, in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. On February 22, 1942, it was finally assigned to the 22nd Army in Kalinin Front, but spent some time in transit. On March 7, Colonel Arkhipov was replaced in command by Kombrig Nikolai Ivanovich Konchits, but this officer was in turn replaced by Col. Sergei Yakovlevich Senchillo on March 28. The 362nd would remain in 22nd Army until March, 1943, generally holding positions along the northwestern sector of the Rzhev salient.Charles C.

Gen. Vasilii Nikitich Dalmatov. In the planning for the Second Rzhev-Sychevka Offensive, the Army commander, Maj. Gen. V. A. Yushkevich, gave Dalmatov a diversionary assignment. His division was to attack with the 1208th and 1210th Rifle Regiments against a small German-held salient south of the road from Nelidovo to Olenino. In the event the salient was taken and held, making it one of the few permanent gains by the Red Army in Operation Mars, although casualties in the division were high.David M. Glantz, Zhukov's Greatest Defeat, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 1999, pp. 62-63, 210, 288 In the aftermath of the battle on January 4, 1943, the chief of staff of Kalinin Front reported on shortcomings in the combat units, including the 362nd: As the German 9th Army prepared to evacuate the salient its artillery units began firing off excess ammunition, and on February 24 the combat positions of the division were struck by up to 1,000 shells and mortar rounds.Gerasimova, Rzhev Slaughterhouse, p. 132 When that Army began Operation B√ºffel on March 1 the 362nd was part of 25th Rifle Corps and briefly took part in the pursuit before being ordered, with its Corps, on March 11 into the Reserve of the Supreme High Command for rebuilding at Plavsk.

The 1208th and 1210th were to break out of the bridgehead to the north, and advance along the west bank of the Sozh to make a combined attack from both sides of the river on Propoisk, even though that city was in the sector of 50th Army: By November 26 most of the division had reached positions about 20km west of the Sozh, while one regiment had liberated the town of Khachniki, on the road to Bykhov.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 200-02 On December 10 General Dalmatov left command of the division to take the position of deputy commander of 80th Corps. He was replaced by Col. Nikolai Fomich Pukhovskii. At the end of the month, 80th Corps began preparing an offensive operation to destroy the German 267th Infantry Division and advance to the Dniepr. This action began on January 4, 1944, preceded by a deep raid by a ski detachment of about 200 men overnight on January 3/4 against the headquarters of the German division in the village of Pribor, based on intelligence from German prisoners and local inhabitants. The raid was successful in utterly disrupting the command and control of the 267th. At dawn of the 4th, 80th Corps, supported by the 36th Tank Regiment, attacked on a 7km-wide sector from Palki on the Bobrovka River northward to Uzniki. In total, the disrupted 267th was faced with an attack by elements of six Soviet rifle divisions. In the early going the attackers advanced 4 - 5km, and the 362nd and 283rd Rifle Divisions quickly encircled and destroyed the German garrison at Palki before driving on northwest towards Nikonovichi. By late on January 5, 80th Corps was closing up to a new defensive line along the Ukhliast River, the so-called Winterstand line, which had been prepared in advance. The offensive was called off on January 8, but 80th Corps by that time had severely damaged the 267th Infantry and captured most of the Germans' Bykhov salient.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 405-16 On January 13 General Dalmatov returned to command of the division. Operation Bagration In February the division was transferred to the 19th Rifle Corps of 50th Army in the renamed 1st Belorussian Front. On March 6, Senior Sergeant Stepan Lavrentevich Ushakov, commander of the 1210th Rifle Regiment's reconnaissance platoon, became the division's first Hero of the Soviet Union for his exploits on scouting missions and for his score of 400 kills as a sniper.

In the planning for the summer offensive, 2nd Belorussian Front would take a secondary role holding the German 4th Army in place while it was encircled from the north and south. When the main offensive began on the morning of June 23 50th Army was spread over a sector 75km wide. On the next morning the 19th Corps penetrated the defenses of the 267th Infantry at Ludchitsa, but by 1100 hrs. the attack had been contained.Dunn, Jr., Soviet Blitzkrieg, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2008, pp. 163-65, 168 On the 25th General Dalmatov handed his command over to Maj. Gen. Mikhail Yenshin, who would remain in command for the duration; at the same time Dalmatov took over Yenshin's former command, the 307th Rifle Division. During these days the pace of the offensive picked up and elements of 50th Army reached and forced the Dniepr, in recognition of which the personnel of the 362nd were given a battle honor apparently more to their liking: On the following day, elements of the 362nd and 380th Rifle Divisions, along with three anti-tank artillery regiments, two Guards Mortar regiments, a mortar regiment, two sapper battalions and two truck battalions, were formed into the forward detachments of 50th Army with orders to seize a bridgehead over the Berezina River.Soviet General Staff, Operation Bagration, ed. & trans.

It is based on the Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries television series and the series of Phryne Fisher novels written by Kerry Greenwood. Plot Phryne Fisher helps to rescue a young Bedouin girl called Shirin from imprisonment in 1920s Jerusalem. While doing so she is suspected of having died. Shirin is reunited with her uncle Sheikh Kahlil Abbas and they travel to Lofthouse Manor in England where a memorial is being held for Miss Fisher by her friends Lord and Lady Lofthouse. DI Jack Robinson travels to England from Australia to attend the memorial and is just about to deliver her eulogy when Miss Fisher arrives on her biplane. Shirin discusses with Miss Fisher about how she came to be in Jerusalem. As a child, a sandstorm had wiped out her village and she was the only survivor having been rescued by a mysterious stranger. This stranger has now sent her a letter asking to meet at All Saints' Church at midnight. Miss Fisher notices that the letter had already been opened so volunteers to attend the meeting on Shirin's behalf as it could be dangerous. On her way to the meeting, she asks DI Robinson to accompany her to the meeting. At the church, she approaches a British man called Wilson. He is shot by an unknown assailant. Before dying, he gives Miss Fisher an emerald amulet which he asks her to give to Shirin. Miss Fisher and DI Robinson are arrested at the scene and the police reveal that Wilson was a felon who had deserted the British army with fellow soldier Captain Harry Templeton who has already been executed for desertion. Miss Fisher visits an antiquities expert Professor Linnaeus with DI Robinson who explains that the amulet is engraved with the inscription \\"Crypt of Tears\\" which was connected to Alexander the Great and that he believes that it is cursed. While there, the unknown assailant attempts to steal the amulet from DI Robinson who manages to fight them off. The following morning, Miss Fisher sneaks into the Sheikh's bedroom at Lofthouse Manor where she discovers that the Sheikh had signed an agreement with Lord Lofthouse and businessman Vincent 'Monty' Montague involving the British Palestine Railways. Later in the night, he is shot dead by the unknown assailant. DI Robinson visits Captain Templeton's widow who gives him an astrolabe which had been owned by her husband. Miss Fisher finds a large emerald in a pot in the Sheikh's room which is verified by Professor Linnaeus as being linked to the amulet. DI Robinson, Miss Fisher, Jonathon Lofthouse (the younger brother of Lord Lofthouse), and Shirin all travel to Negev and find a tomb in the desert using the astrolabe. A corpse is found in the tomb which had been stabbed by a dagger carrying Jonathon's insignia. He reveals that he had accompanied Captain Templeton and Wilson to Shirin's village a decade ago in search of the jewels. Captain Templeton had shot and murdered the villagers. Shirin's mother showed them to the tomb where upon hearing the gunshots, there was a struggle where he accidentally killed her. He returned with them so that he could return the jewels as he believes that he is cursed. Miss Fisher therefore figures out that the unknown assailant is someone trying to protect Jonathon which she identifies as his real father, the Lofthouse's butler, Crippins. He emerges from the shadow of the tomb and attempts to steal the jewels but is stopped by Jonathon who holds him hostage while the others escape from the collapsing tomb walls.

It began production in October 2018 and stars Essie Davis, Nathan Page, and other members of the original television series, along with new guest stars Rupert Penry-Jones, Daniel Lapaine and Jacqueline McKenzie. The film is budgeted at $8 million and was directed by Tony Tilse. It wrapped production in late November, 2018. Since 2016, there had been speculation on the possibility that the television series would be made into a feature film. In May 2016, Essie Davis acknowledged interest in playing Miss Fisher in a film. \\"[We're] just working out the ideas of how to make it bigger and better and more fabulous than the TV show,\\" she said. Later that year, it was revealed that plans were afoot to produce a trilogy of Phryne Fisher films. In April 2017, a photo was published on the official Miss Fisher Murder Mysteries Instagram account showing Essie Davis and Nathan Page holding advance copies of a film script titled Miss Fisher and the Crypt of Tears. On 14 September 2017, a crowdfunding campaign was launched on Kickstarter in support of the film. On 15 December 2017, an additional ongoing crowdfunding campaign was begun through IndieGoGo in order to allow fans to continue supporting the effort. The original campaign reached its goal of $250,000 in less than 48 hours. Following the success of the Miss Fisher and the Crypt of Tears crowdfunding campaign, Essie Davis reflected on Phryne's appeal to fans: \\"I think there are many elements to why fans love 'Miss Fisher', but I'm sure it's Phryne's independence with joy. There's something so attractive about being around a happy person\\". She added, \\"That burst between Jack and Phryne, there's nothing more attractive that you want to lean into than watching people fall in love with each other.\\" In an interview with The Mercury Davis elaborated, \\"It kind of blows my mind how big that fanbase is around the world. I get letters from a lot of Americans and South Americans, from all over. Paper letters! For many people, it's been a lifeline.\\" In September 2019 the first teaser trailer for the film was released in Australia on the Sunrise morning television program. The full trailer was released in Australia in early December, 2019. Awards The AWGIE Awards, sponsored by the Australian Writers' Guild, nominated Miss Fisher and the Crypt of Tears screenwriter Deb Cox for best feature film adaptation.

Piracy attack in 2017 In March 2017, the bulk carrier MV OS 35 departed from Port Kelang, laden with cargo for Aden, Yemen. In April 2017, as OS 35 was sailing off the coast of Somalia and Yemen, a skiff with suspected Somalian pirates tried to board the vessel. The vessel initially attempted anti piracy maneuvers which had no effect on the pirate boats. Thereafter, all the ships crew mustered in the ship's citadel while the handful of armed security guards (PCASP) on board attempted to delay the pirates boarding. This too had limited effect and the pirates continued to come extremely close to the large bulk carrier and finally boarded and hijacked the vessel in the position 12¬∞51‚Ä≤N 50¬∞42‚Ä≤E. Meanwhile, Chinese and Indian navy ships that were patrolling the region received the alert that had been sent by the ship using its SSAS (Ship Security Alert System) and proceeded to assist the vessel. Two Indian ships, and , and one Chinese ship, Yulin, proceeded towards the hijacked ship in a joint operation. The Indian navy provided air cover while the Chinese ship arrived on scene. An 18-man Chinese special force team boarded the hijacked bulk carrier. The pirates abandoned OS 35 and fled before the special force team arrived.

Negative ethics  In his book A Critique of Affirmative Morality (A reflection on Death, Birth and the Value of Life), J. Cabrera, A critique of affirmative morality (A reflection on death, birth and the value of life), Bras√≠lia: Julio Cabrera Editions, 2014 (English edition). J. Cabrera, Cr√≠tica de la moral afirmativa: Una reflexi√≥n sobre nacimiento, muerte y valor de la vida, Barcelona: Gedisa, 1996 (original Spanish edition). Julio Cabrera presents his theory about the value of human existence. Human life, for Cabrera, is \\"structurally negative\\" insofar as there are negative components of life that are inevitable, constitutive and adverse: as prominent among them Cabrera cites loss, scarcity, pain, conflicts, fragility, illness, aging, discouragement and death. According to Cabrera they form the basic structure to human life, which he analyzes through what he calls naturalistic phenomenology, drawing freely from thinkers such as Martin Heidegger, Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche. Cabrera has called his work an attempt to put together Schopenhauer and Heidegger, introducing a determinant judgement of the value of being into the analysis of Dasein, and putting morality above life, against Nietzsche. Cabrera develops an ethical theory, negative ethics, that is informed by this phenomenological analysis. He argues that there has been an unwarranted prejudice in ethics against non-being, a view he calls \\"affirmativity\\". Because affirmative views take being as good, they always view things that threaten this hegemony as bad; particularly things like abstention from procreation or suicide. Cabrera criticizes affirmative ethics for asking how people should live without asking the radical question of whether people should live tout court. He argues that, because of the structural negativity of being, there is a fundamental \\"moral disqualification\\" of human beings due to the impossibility of nonharming and nonmanipulating others. Nonharming and nonmanipulating others is called by him the \\"Minimal Ethical Articulation\\" (\\"MEA\\"; previously translated into English as \\"Fundamental Ethical Articulation\\" and \\"FEA\\"). The MEA is violated by our structural \\"moral impediment\\", by the worldly discomforts ‚Äì notably pain and discouragement ‚Äì imposed on us that prevent us from acting ethically. Cabrera argues that an affirmative morality is a self-contradiction because it accepts the MEA and conceives a human existence that precludes the possibility of not- harming or not-manipulating others. Thus he believes that affirmative societies, through their politics, require the common suspension of the MEA to even function. Cabrera's negative ethics is supposed to be a response to the negative structure of being, acutely aware of the morally disqualifying nature of being. Cabrera believes children are usually considered as mere aesthetic objects, are not created for their own sake but for the sake of their parents, and are thrown into a structurally negative life by the act of procreation. Procreation is, Cabrera argues, a harm and a supreme act of manipulation. He believes that the consistent application of normal moral concepts ‚Äì like duty, virtue or respect ‚Äì present in most affirmative moralities entails antinatalism. Cabrera also argues that a human being adopting negative ethics should not only abstain from procreation, but also should have a complete willingness for an ethical death, by immediate suspension of all personal projects in benefit of a political fightJ.

Cabrera, Cine, 100 a√±os de filosofia: Una Introducci√≥n a la Filosofia A Traves del An√°lisis de Pel√≠culas, Barcelona: Gedisa, 1999 (second edition in 2015). Julio Cabrera proposes the notion of \\"logopathy\\" (from Greek: \\"logos\\" ‚Äì \\"reason\\" and \\"p√°thos\\" ‚Äì \\"feelings\\"), that is, of \\"cognitive-affective concepts\\", treating them as capable of putting in question the traditional view of philosophy about concepts, which he calls apathetic and tied to purely intellectual concepts. Cabrera sustains that logopathic philosophy is of the order of meaning, and not of truth, and that it adds affective elements of judgment to these traditional intellectual view of concepts. Cabrera considers cinema one of the most fruitful means for the generation of concepts of a logopathic type, specifically denominated by him as \\"concept-image\\", as opposed to \\"concept- idea\\", the apathetic type of concept. He believes that cinema, by its powerful audiovisual means of expression, would provide a \\"superpotentiation\\" of conceptual possibilities, and therefore, of the establishment of the experience of the film, indispensable to the development of the concept-image, with the consequent increase of affective impact. On the other hand, Cabrera believes that throughout history of European philosophy, at various moments, written philosophy ‚Äì the opposite of visual philosophy ‚Äì has also been logopathic, it has thought through affections, but without assuming it openly, while cinema usually has been seen only as a mere affective phenomenon, without relevant cognitive power. His notions of logopathy and concept-image seek to eliminate this dichotomy, pointing to the affectivity of the intellect and the cognitiveness of affections.

Philosophy of language and logic  For Cabrera, philosophies of language are philosophies for which language does not matter in so far as it merely conveys something, but insofar as it constitutes ‚Äì and implements ‚Äì concepts and structures of understanding of the world. From this large sense of the term, he identifies four philosophies of language, which are: analytical, hermeneutic, phenomenological and meta- critical. Looking through the prism of negativity, Cabrera shows how the four above types of philosophies of language fail at a common point: their incapacity to fight against the failures of meaning. For the analytics, the point presents itself in the \\"meaninglessness\\" of expressions which is treated as a limit beyond which one should not go. However, according to Cabrera, this analytic objectivism excludes fundamental dimensions of the problem of meaning, such as time and lived experience. Phenomenology expands the analytic semantic horizon with the dimension of intentionality (of which analytic intensionality is only an inauthentic correlate, essentially objective) without the problem of meaninglessness being tamed. It remains for phenomenology, however, the temporality and historicity that hermeneutics adds to the approach of the problem, which is called \\"misunderstanding\\". Hermeneutic falls into the basic \\"distortions of meanings\\", something stronger than \\"meaninglessness\\" and \\"misunderstanding\\", a subject of meta-critical philosophies, represented by Karl Marx's and Sigmund Freud's philosophies of language. Cabrera strongly criticizes the analytic approach to language for its denial of everything that is not objective. But according to him, also the other philosophies of language show their faults, from phenomenology to hermeneutics and even meta-criticism harboring therapies redeeming only in an illusory manner: psychoanalytic healing or communist utopia. Cabrera's philosophy of language is a philosophy of confrontations between philosophies, which can only be made under the sign of resignation in finitude and negativism. He argues that not one of the kinds of philosophies of language that have been side-by-side in the last century and a half can, by itself, account for the complexity of the human. It is in this sense that, for Cabrera, all understanding is, ultimately, a self-sustaining illusion. Logic for Cabrera is often linked to three fundamental principles: (1) The object that propositions deal with is indeterminate and general, (2) Logic applies to ordinary reasoning, albeit with some effort, and (3) Logic is formal rather than lexical, that is, based on the structural and non-semantic connections in language. Cabrera constructs his thought in this area by criticizing each of these three basic premises of the logical tradition. His intuition in this field of research is the same as in others: the intersections of traditions enriches thought and is essential to account for the human condition. Thus, logical formalization is important for thinking about existence, just as the issues of human existence are essential for understanding thinking and logic. This conception of philosophy owes the hardly unorthodox intersections that Cabrera did in his studies of logic, connecting Saul Kripke with Martin Heidegger, Immanuel Kant with John Austin, and Ludwig Wittgenstein with Jean- Paul Sartre. Cabrera's work has the expectation of allying the formal instruments to the existential contents of life. The critique to the alleged empty generality of logic goes in this direction as well as the proposal of a lexical logic of predicative connections, in an attempt to lend to lexical analysis a formal dimension, but loaded with content. The specific work on concept networks in lexical logic was developed in partnership with the physicist Olavo Leopoldino da Silva Filho, from the University of Brasilia. His work on logic also proceeds to a revision of the history of logic. An outline of his version of the history of logic would be as follows: (1) The Platonic conception of logic. (2) Aristotle, in syllogisms and beyond. (3) The logic of the connections of meanings in the Middle Ages. (4) Modern criticisms of formal logic: Francis Bacon, Rene Descartes and John Locke, the scientific method and logic, philosophical analysis and heuristics, the Port-Royal Logic. (5) The case of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz: what the official history took and what it didn't analyze. (6) Formal logic, transcendental logic: Immanuel Kant. (7) The logic in motion of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel: Hegelian criticism of denial. (8) the logic of the induction of John Stuart Mill. (9) Three conceptions of logic in the passage from the nineteenth to the twentieth century: Gottlob Frege, John Dewey and Edmund Husserl, logic within analysis, pragmatism, and phenomenology. (10) The case of Charles Sanders Peirce: what the official story took and what it didn't analyze. J. Cabrera, Margens das filosofias da linguagem: conflitos e aproxima√ß√µes entre anal√≠ticas, hermen√™uticas, fenomenologias e metacr√≠ticas da linguagem, Bras√≠lia: UnB, 2003 (reprinted in 2009).J.

(second edition in 2013). Cabrera also develops a negative approach to argumentation in the field of informal logic, a pessimistic parallel theory to his negative ethics. For him, an affirmative approach to argumentation is one in which philosophical problems are considered to have one solution or at least an adequate treatment amongst many others that are inadequate and wrong. In Cabrera's view, according to the affirmative approach, the multiplicity of answers given by philosophy is a mistake which must be \\"resolved\\" in some way. On the other hand, according to the negative approach, the multiplicity of answers given by philosophy is not a mistake, but its most natural development. The negative approach to argumentation is concerned with treating one's own position and perspective not as a unique truth, but as one of many within an extensive and complex holistic web of approaches and perspectives, that speak and criticize mutually without discarding one another, although each of such positions may be fiercely maintained based on its perspective and assumptions, supported on defensible grounds.

Cabrera, Introdu√ßao a uma abordagem negativa da argumenta√ßao, Signo, Santa Cruz do Sul, volume 42, number 73, January/April 2017.  Latin American philosophy  Cabrera argues that there are epistemic injustices associated with the practice of philosophy in colonized contexts such as in Latin America. In a lecture in Unisinos University, Cabrera began to enunciate the problem of colonization in philosophy in a succinct and direct way: A central idea he came to defend is that the current status of philosophy in many Latin American countries is a product of the way philosophy is taught, researched, and written by local institutions that are subordinate to the international scene. Professional philosophy in these countries have been developed around commenting European (and, to a lesser extent, North American) philosophers, and this emphasis has developed as a corollary of the idea that philosophy is done only with reference to European philosophers and no Latin American is encouraged to challenge this hegemony. Alongside this inhibition of Latin American philosophy is the idea that what is European is universal while what is Latin American is merely local or national. He makes a diagnosis in the form of \\"acervo T\\" (\\"T collection\\"), theses on the hegemony of Eurocentric philosophy; this collection of theses is understood by Cabrera as being tacitly adopted by most of the Latin American philosophers. J. Cabrera, Europeu n√£o significa universal, brasileiro n√£o significa nacional, Brasileira de Humanidades, Nabuco, number 2, November 2014/January/February 2015. In opposition to this colonial order, Cabrera proposes and recommends several practices concerning the teaching and practice of philosophy, among them: (1) A greater attention to Latin American sources so that the history of philosophy on the continent does not continue to be ignored by local philosophers and that the work of these philosophers be as much discussed as that of European sources, (2) A stimulus to philosophy that is not merely from Latin America nor about Latin America, but from Latin America where the local starting point is made explicit, (3) The practice of appropriation in which philosophers from other contexts are placed in discussions of interest to Latin America. This practice can be found in important philosophical works in Latin America such as that of Enrique Dussel with which Cabrera maintained published debates. J. Cabrera, Dussel y el suic√≠dio, Dianoia, XLIX, 52, 2004, pp. 111‚Äì124.J. Cabrera, An√°lisis y existencia: pensamiento en traves√≠a, C√≥rdoba: Ediciones del Copista, 2010, Essay 10. Cabrera has defended the crossing of boundaries between traditions and has on many occasions shown the potential for fertilization stemming from the juxtaposition, friction and debate between philosophies originating from analytical and continental traditions.J. Cabrera, An√°lisis y existencia: pensamiento en traves√≠a, C√≥rdoba: Ediciones del Copista, 2010, Essays 1‚Äì7. Over time, he extended this metaphilosophical approach in the direction of making it an element of the struggle against what he began to clearly see as the colonized state of philosophy in Latin America. In his book Di√°rio de um fil√≥sofo no Brasil, Cabrera documents the problems of self-reliant inventive philosophy in Brazil; the book describes the environment of suppression of philosophical intuition in its many mechanisms attending to what is specific in the Brazilian colonized context. The book portrays what it means to philosophize from somewhere and tries to present alternatives to the philosophical commentary that can flourish even in a hostile environment. For Cabrera, it is important to understand from where philosophy in Latin America is made: it is made from invaded, looted, dominated countries that have been placed in intellectual subservience. He claims that this makes the philosophy produced there different from all European philosophy ‚Äì and it is important for him to stress that no philosophy is born universal. Cabrera notes that philosophy in Brazil, especially made in departments in the academy, is particularly blind to the sources of Latin American thought, both from the classics (Bartolom√© de Las Casas, Ant√≥nio Vieira, Flora Tristan, Juan Bautista Alberdi, Jos√© Mart√≠ and Jos√© Enrique Rod√≥) and contemporary (Jos√© Carlos Mari√°tegui, Edmundo O'Gorman, Leopoldo Zea, Miguel Le√≥n-Portilla, Roberto Fern√°ndez Retamar and Santiago Castro-G√≥mez), known only in isolated expert communities. His proposition is a course in the history of thought that begins with pre-Columbian Amerindian thought and which does not pass through Europeans (nor Greeks) until the nineteenth century. The idea is to read nineteenth-century European philosophers who challenged intellectualist and Christian traditions, such as Arthur Schopenhauer, S√∏ren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche (and their precursors Michel de Montaigne, Denis Diderot and Jean-Jacques Rousseau), as influenced virtually by Amerindian ways of living and thinking.J.

She is best known for making glass vessels inspired by woven forms traditionally made by indigenous peoples. She is also known for her advocacy for and support of indigenous artists.  Early life  Jenni Kemarre Martiniello was born in Adelaide, Australia. Her father was of Aboriginal and Chinese descent, and her mother, a mezzo-soprano and accomplished pianist, was of Anglo-Celtic descent. They met while working at John Martin & Co. and got married, a potentially controversial union for a mixed-race couple at the time. Martiniello had an early interest in art. While in high school, she took night classes at the Adelaide School of Art. However, after she graduated from high school, she decided to join the navy. She spent two years in the service, first as a radar plotter and later as a weapons assessor. She eventually left, dissatisfied with the way service members were treated. She then met and married her husband, an Italian migrant, and they settled in Canberra in the late 1960s. The two had multiple children together, but ended up getting a divorce ten years into their relationship. After her divorce, Martiniello returned to school, this time studying sculpture at the Canberra School of Art (now the Australian National University School of Art). While there, she experimented with many different mediums, including drawing, printmaking, and photography. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1985, then studied philosophy and art history (also at ANU).  Career   Teaching and writing  Martiniello taught professional and community education at the University of Canberra, and indigenous art history at the Yurauna Centre (part of the Canberra Institute of Technology). During this time she continued sculpting and drawing. In 1999, Martiniello founded the ACT Indigenous Writers Group. She published several volumes of poetry, and in 2003 she was named an ACT Creative Arts Fellow for Literature.  Advocacy and education  In 2003, Martiniello and fellow artist Lyndy Delian founded the Indigenous Textiles and Glass Artists (ITAG) organization. The group advocates for indigenous artists and helps them connect with other arts organizations. They help to mitigate any barriers due to historic colonization and discrimination of indigenous peoples. ITAG also hosts exhibitions and offers workshops for artists. Martiniello and Delian have also collaborated to create the Honouring Cultures program, which, in partnership with Canberra Glassworks, gives regional artists the chance to develop their glassmaking skills and international artists the opportunity to participate in skills exchange and collaborative work programs. Martiniello founded Kemarre Arts in 2006. It was the Australian Capital Territory's first \\"independent Aboriginal-run social enterprise.\\" The organization supports artists in many ways, including through: grant writing, professional development programs, publishing, and product and pricing guidance. In 2012, Kemarre Arts won the ACT NAIDOC Award for Most Outstanding Agency.  Glassmaking  Martiniello first began to work in the medium of glass alongside Delian in 2008. They applied for a grant to teach indigenous artists glassmaking through a series of workshops at Canberra Glassworks, and were able to learn skills alongside roughly 20 other artists. In 2011, Martiniello was an artist-in-residence at the Thomas Foundation. While there, she began experimenting with weaving patterns in glass. She took her inspiration from the Aboriginal tradition of weaving. As a child she had seen woven vessels such as fish traps and bags in museums, displayed as if they were \\"relics from a dead past of extinct cultural practices.‚Äù She was also able to watch women, including her Arrante grandmother, weave items such as eel traps, fish traps, dilly bags, bicornual baskets, and message sticks. Martiniello combines this childhood inspiration with her newer knowledge of glass, using the Venetian technique of canework to imitate woven forms in glass. She experiments with colours to achieve a palette with references from the Australian landscape. She works with a team of people to realize her pieces, which continues a practice common among glass artists and also parallels indigenous weaving circles. In both cases these groups of artists pass knowledge and skills down to the younger generation through demonstration and experience. In 2013, Martiniello was awarded the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award for her piece Golden Brown Reeds Fish Trap. The Australian award is the most prestigious prize for indigenous art. The piece was inspired by woven fish traps from northeast Arnhem Land and Cape York, and took a team of seven artists to make. Other selected awards and honors include the Canberra Critics Circle Award for Visual Arts (2011, 2013), the Wollotuka Acquisitive Art Prize (University of Newcastle, 2012), the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Arts Visual Arts Fellowship (2013-2015), and the Bay of Fires Art Prize (2016). Her work is in several major collections, including the National Gallery of Australia, the National Museum of Australia, the Canberra Museum and Gallery, the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, the Australian Parliament House Collection, the National Art Glass Gallery, the Belau National Museum, the Corning Museum of Glass, the Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection of the University of Virginia, and the British Museum.

She studied at Harvard University on a JH Choate Fellowship, and earned a Ph.D. in the history of psychiatry and sexuality from the University of Cambridge. She has been a postdoctoral fellow in the history of medicine at Warwick University. Angel is currently a lecturer in creative writing at Birkbeck, University of London. In 2012, Angel published Unmastered: A Book on Desire, Most Difficult to Tell, a literary and experimental meditation on sexual desire. Unmastered attracted international attention. In 2019, Angel's book Daddy Issues was published by Peninsula Press. Critical reception Unmastered garnered generally positive reviews. Talitha Stevenson, writing in The Guardian, noted a \\"distinctive sensibility\\" in the book, and wrote admiringly that \\"a sumptuous picture emerges of Angel's relationship with her partner, and she shows the way love permits the ordinary to snuggle up to the sublime.\\" Stevenson concludes that \\"Unmastered is a blemished but vigorous testament to a female libido undaunted by the cold shower of self-analysis, or by the bedside interjections of feminist heroines.\\" Stuart Hammond, writing in Dazed Digital, lauded Unmastered, describing it as \\"one of those totally out-of-the blue, impossible-to- classify, weird and new and wonderful fiction-ish nonfiction books, which happily come along every so often and make you go, 'Whoa: this is what we need now.'\\" Writing in For Books' Sake, Henna Butt observed that Angel's \\"background has built the confident feminism which pervades Unmastered and seems to bolster her even when other feminists have deemed her views to be unacceptable... Angel illustrates how she has felt feminism, in some instances, enforces precisely the same ‚Äúshaming and silencing‚Äù of women‚Äôs sexuality that it seeks to oppose. This is shown through an occasion when Angel listens to Shere Hite and is disappointed to find the disapproval with which penetrative sex with men is discussed.\\" Kirkus Reviews called Unmastered \\"[a] revealing look at postmodern feminism and its role in female desire through one woman‚Äôs personal anecdotes, meditations and professional research,\\" and went on to say that \\"Angel provides an intelligent examination of how today‚Äôs women satiate their needs and desires.\\" Observing that Angel \\"struggles with her personal convictions regarding love and lust in and out of the bedroom,\\" the reviewer praised the book's \\"empowering conclusion,\\" and recommended Unmastered as \\"an unconventional and strikingly lyrical observation of women and their desire to speak regarding the fulfillment of their sexual and emotional needs.\\" Works Literary non-fiction * Unmastered: A Book on Desire, Most Difficult to Tell (2012) * Daddy Issues (2019) See also * British literature References Sources    * External links * Katherine Angel's Twitter (@KayEngels) * Katherine Angel's profile at Birkbeck, University of London Category:21st-century British novelists Category:21st-century British women writers Category:British women academics Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:People from Brussels Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Alumni of the University of Cambridge Category:Academics of Birkbeck, University of London ","title":"Katherine Angel"},{"id":"58844826","text":"Countdown is an album by organist Jimmy McGriff recorded in 1983 and released on the Milestone label.Payne, D.

Such events were popular and common in Ancient Greece and would later be adopted by the Romans, as well as other Hellenistic societies. In a public auction, goods belonging to the state were sold, whereas private auctions sold goods belonging to individuals and identity of the seller was private. Goods that were often sold at auction include, land, the ability to collect taxes, slaves, seized goods, and inheritances. Auctions have progressed to the exciting event we know today from a very long history that started in ancient Greece.  Private and Public Auctions  There were two types of auctions in Ancient Greece. In a public auction, goods belonging to the government were sold and the identity of the seller was made public. These auctions also organized by public officials. Sometimes these officials were more closely affiliated to the military, and sometimes they were civil authorities. Public auctions were often used as a quick and easy way to raise funds to balance the government's budget. Usually public auctions were used to satisfy normal recurring expenditures as opposed to extraordinary expenses like wars, public works projects, or food shortages. Public auctions were also useful as a mechanism to collect taxes. In Athens, in the place of an administrative arm with the express purpose of collecting taxes, there was a system of Tax farming via public auction. The tax farmers (telonai) would collect the taxes instead of government officials. Public auctions were also used a means of punishment by the government. If someone misused or misappropriated public property, sometimes some or all of their goods would be seized and by the government and sold through public auction. Public auctions were also used as a political tool to curry or check power within the polis, especially during the reign of a tyrant. Public auctions could be used to dominate and degrade those who opposed the current regime and reward those who supported it. In a private auction, the identity of the seller was not made public and the goods on sale belonged to private individuals. Private auctions were an important aspect of estate management as inheritances were commonly sold at private auctions. Private auctions also contributed to the status of buyer within Greek society and as the quality of goods from an estate could contribute to the esteem of the buyer.  Auction Procedure  Anyone who desired to sell at an auction would need to speak to the public offerer, also known as the praeco, about the matter. The auction would then be announced both in writing and orally through the praeco or the keryx. The praeco would also act as the auctioneer during the auction itself and would receive a commission of the sale price for his troubles. The cashiers, or coactores would give the money to the sellers. Unlike in Italy, money changers, or argentarii were not used in Greece. However, banks became involved with the process between the second and third century B.C.E.  Goods commonly sold at Auction  Public auctions often sold rights to unpaid loans, public lands and other public goods, goods seized from conquered enemies, confiscated goods from those who owed the government taxes, and goods from exiles and convicts and exiles. The collection of taxes was also often sold through public auction. Prisoners of war were also sold as slaves through public auction. At private auctions, goods like land, inheritance, crops, houses, slaves, and livestock were often sold. Private auctions were also used as a means to pass wealth down through a legacy. Goods commonly sold at public auctions were things like food and spices along with other things like wool and books.

Between 1942 and 1943, during the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Isselhorst was an Einsatzkommando leader, tasked with the murdering of Jews in what is now Belarus and the Baltic states. Before and after, Isselhorst held posts within the Gestapo and SS in Cologne, Munich, Stuttgart and Strasbourg. He was sentenced to death by both a British and French military court and executed in France in 1948 for ordering the execution of captured British SAS members and French civilians in 1944. Biography Early life Erich Georg Heinrich Isselhorst was born in Saint-Avold, Lorraine, in 1906, which was then part of the German Empire but is now part of France. He was educated in Dortmund, Recklinghausen and D√ºsseldorf, where he graduated in 1925. He was employed in a rubber factory before studying law from 1927 to 1930 in Cologne and Munich. Isselhorst received his doctoral degree in law in 1931, once more returned to D√ºsseldorf, and joined the Nazi Party in August 1932. SS career Isselhorst joined the Sturmabteilung (SA), in May 1933, and the SS in October 1934. He was admitted to the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) in July 1937 and permanently employed in the Gestapo in Berlin from December 1935, forward. From February 1936 to April 1938 he was head of the Gestapo in Cologne, after which he was transferred to Klagenfurt, Austria, which had recently been annexed by Nazi Germany. During this time, he also served as a reservist in the Wehrmacht, taking part in training with an anti-aircraft regiment. From December 1939 to November 1942, Isselhorst served as the head of the Gestapo in Munich. In January 1942 he was severely reprimanded for behaviour unbecoming of a member of the SS. From January to October 1942, Isselhorst was transferred to the Reichskommissariat Ostland in occupied Belarus, where he headed a department of the Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo; Security Police). In September and October 1942 he led Einsatzkommando 8, a sub-group of the mobile killing unit known as Einsatzgruppe B, which was tasked with murdering Jews. From October 1942 to June 1943 he led Einsatzkommando 1 of the Einsatzgruppe A, now in the Baltic states, carrying out the murder of Jews there. From June to October 1943 he was head of the SiPo in Minsk while also leading Sonderkommandos 1b of the Einsatzgruppe A. Isselhorst returned to Germany in October 1943 and his old role in Munich before being transferred to Strasbourg in December, where he headed the SiPo there. At the same time he also headed the SiPo in Stuttgart. Murder of captured SAS soldiers While posted in Strasbourg in the second half of 1944, Isselhorst was part of the Operation Waldfest, a scorched earth operation in which villages in the Vosges mountains were destroyed to eliminate shelter for Allied troops for the upcoming winter, with the inhabitants deported as forced labour or to Nazi concentration camps. In a coordinated operation by the Wehrmacht and SS, villages were raided. There Maquis French resistance fighters, and 39 British paratroopers of the Special Air Service, part of the Operation Loyton were executed; the latter as part of Hitler's Commando Order. Isselhorst ordered the execution of the captured British SAS members, as well as a number of French civilians, three French priests and four US airmen. The prisoners were taken over the Rhine river on trucks to Gaggenau on 21 November 1944. The leader of the execution commando, Karl Beck (reported as Karl Buck in \\"The Nazi Hunters\\" - Damien Lewis - 2015), thought it unwise to leave mass graves of shot allied soldiers in an area so close to the front line. The prisoners were initially kept in a local jail, but then on or shortly after 25 November, taken to a local forest and shot in the head in a bomb crater. One prisoner attempted to escape, but was killed. Apart from Isselhorst, his second in command, Wilhelm Schneider was also executed for the war crime in January 1947. Beck initially escaped punishment, but was sentenced to death in the 1950s. In January 1945 Isselhorst was transferred once more, now to the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA) in Berlin, where he remained until April. Isselhorst was arrested by US forces on 12 May 1945 in southern Bavaria. Execution Isselhorst was sentenced to death by a British military tribunal in June 1946 for the murder of British POWs, but handed over to the French. He was once more sentenced to death in May 1947, now by a French military tribunal, and executed in Strasbourg on 23 February 1948.

Produced by Mohan Babu, the film features himself in a dual role, along with Shriya Saran, Nikhila Vimal, and Anasuya Bharadwaj in the lead roles. Mohan Babu's son Vishnu Manchu plays the younger version of one of his characters. The film also features Brahmanandam, Ali, Kota Srinivasa Rao, Tanikella Bharani, and Posani Krishna Murali in supporting roles.. The film is the remake of Bangladeshi movie Aynabaji directed by Amitabh Reza Chowdhury. The music was composed by S. Thaman with cinematography by Sarvesh Murari. The film released on 9 February 2018. This film is a tribute to director Dasari Narayana Rao, who died on 30 May 2017. Plot Dasari Sivaji, a stage artist by profession, runs Sarada Sadan, named after his late wife Shaarada, to help destitute children. One day, he rescues a girl named Gayatri from goons. Sivaji gets a call from Gayatri, and when he looks at her phone screen, he realizes that it is Shaarada. Sivaji then finds out that Gayatri is his long-lost daughter. He comes to her college graduation, where she says that she does not know how her father looks but only knows that he is a heartless brute as he sold her for 1,000 rupees in order to buy a bottle of liquor. Sivaji is distraught and later walks away to a temple. Gayatri is later told by Sivaji's friend Prasad that Sivaji is her father. Prasad hands Sivaji's diary to Gayatri, and she learns about Sivaji's past. A young Sivaji is an orphan who found his calling in acting. He falls in love with Shaarada and marries her. One day, he fights some goons led by the MLA of their caste. Shaarada then talks to Sivaji and says that she would like to see him as a hero and not a rowdy. However, one day, Shaarada dies. The doctor tells Sivaji that she is suffering from stage three pelvic cancer and that he has to arrange a large amount of money to finance her treatment. Giri, Sivaji's friend, tells Sivaji that a man was refused bail and that if Sivaji goes to jail for two days, then the amount will be paid. Later, a drunk Giri confesses to Sivaji that Shaarada and her daughter, whom she was pregnant with, passed away. Sivaji gets upset and tries to end his life by having a train hit him. Giri saves him but loses his life while doing so. Before Giri dies, he reveals that the baby was alive and that he thought of selling the baby for a bottle of liquor. The baby, Gayatri, grew up in Ramanujam Orphanage. On her birthday, she is gifted with a photo of her mother Shaarada, who died as soon as she delivered her. The film goes back to the present, where Gayatri and Prasad go to Sivaji's house to try to find him, but to no avail. Sivaji is still at the temple, but he gets hit on the head and captured by goons. Gayatri and Prasad then go to the temple but do not find Sivaji. The goons who captured Sivaji turn out to be the henchmen of his lookalike, Gayatri Patel. Sivaji later meets Gayatri Patel in person. Soon after, Gayatri Patel soon gets arrested and sentenced to the death penalty for burning down a hospital, but Sivaji gets implicated in the case. Sivaji confesses to a police officer that he is Sivaji and not Gayatri Patel, but the police officer knew that he was Sivaji. Gayatri Patel calls Sivaji and tells him that the former's death sentence was because a girl was a witness to the crime, and that girl was none other than Gayatri. Gayatri Patel now wants to kill Sivaji. Gayatri Patel (as Sivaji) then comes to Gayatri's house. While Sivaji (as Gayatri Patel) is in jail, news reporter Shreshta Jayaram tells him that Gayatri Patel has gone to his house disguised as him. At Gayatri's house, Shreshta later interviews her and Gayatri Patel. While interviewing Gayatri Patel (as Sivaji), Shreshta secretly tells Gayatri that her \\"father\\" is Gayatri Patel and not Sivaji. Meanwhile, Sivaji (as Gayatri Patel) is sentenced to the death penalty. Gayatri accuses Shreshta of calling her \\"father\\" an impostor. In jail, Sivaji (as Gayatri Patel) tells Shreshta that his last wish is to watch Sivaji's acting. Many people want Sivaji to fulfill Gayatri Patel's wish. However, Gayatri Patel wants to replace Sivaji and asks his lawyer to book his flight to the US. As Gayatri Patel and Gayatri are in the car, the news reports say that Sivaji is ignoring Gayatri Patel's plea. Gayatri Patel (as Sivaji) is then questioned by numerous people, and Gayatri begs Gayatri Patel to do the wish. Gayatri Patel then does so. Gayatri and Gayatri Patel then visit the jail, where Sivaji is there. Gayatri then reunites with him. The jailer realizes Sivaji's humanitarian nature and decides to have Gayatri Patel hanged.

The farmers were members of the National Federation of Sugar Workers (NFSW), and the massacre may have been motivated by on-going conflicts over land reform in the Philippines. The massacre was part of a series of killings carried out in the Negros provinces against labelled Communists and their sympathizers, and follows the similarly motivated Escalante massacre of 1985.  Massacre  Armed men reportedly attacked a makeshift tent in the sugarcane farm in Hacienda Nene, Purok Fire Tree, Barangay Bulanon on October 20, 2018 and began shooting, killing nine farmers. Three of the victims were also burned after they were killed. According to Police Superintendent Joem Malong, the incident took place at 9:45 PM (GMT+8). The shooting lasted for 10 minutes.  Investigation  After the incident, the police named the victims of the shooting, who included three men, four women and two children. According to the police, most of the victims were the members of Negros Federation of Sugar Workers. Police said that they were hunting for the killers. The NFSW said that the incident occurred on the first night of \\"bungkalan\\" activity ‚Äî \\"wherein farmers occupy idle lands and collectively cultivate to make them productive.\\" The police are investigating \\"land conflict\\" as the possible motive. In an interview on CNN Philippines, Sagay City Acting Chief of Police Chief Inspector Robert Mansueto said that the victims formerly farmed the land in question, and he added that \\"those killed were land reform beneficiaries.\\" Initial reports said that 40 armed men took the place, but Mansueto clarified that it was five or six gunmen. Mansueto also said that the victims were eating dinner inside their tent before the incident. According to one survivor, the armed men arrived at the hacienda on foot and because of the remoteness of the area, the farmers did not notice them. Chief Supt. John Bulalacao, Western Visayas police director, said that some of the 40 farmers \\"were linked to the New People's Army (NPA)\\" and claimed that NFSW was a \\"legal front\\" of the NPA. Chief Insp. Manseto said that the incident appeared to have been a shootout between the gunmen and some of the farmers, although none of the gunmen were harmed. On the Crime Laboratory, one of the slain farmers was holding a .38 caliber handgun, however, three survivors denied this, saying that none of the members have guns. Police found 12 empty bullet casings from a 5.56 mm rifle and seven bullet casings from .45 caliber handgun. In an interview on DZMM, Philippine National Police (PNP) Chief Oscar Albayalde said the NFSW is \\"used by the Communist Party of the Philippines to take over private lands for profit\\" and he added that the victims are \\"not legitimate tillers or tenants\\" of the plantation. The Department of Agrarian Reform said that the victims were \\"not beneficiaries of the government's land distribution program.\\" On October 23, the police said that they had identified one of the members of the NPA who is allegedly behind the massacre. According to the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), the plantation where the incident took place was a \\"vigorous\\" place for the NPA.  Suspects  On October 28, the PNP has identified Rene Manlangit and Rogelio Arquillo ‚Äì recruiters of the farmers to the NFSW. The two were being filed murder charges by the police; however, the two suspects remain at large.  Reactions  On October 21, Malaca√±ang Palace condemned the incident, calling the incident an \\"extremely cruel act\\". Former Special Assistant to the President and now-senatorial candidate Bong Go announced that President Rodrigo Duterte will visit the wake of the slain farmers. However, due to poor weather conditions, his visit has been called off. Several opposition figures condemned the incident and directly blamed Duterte for the act; former Bayan Muna Representative Neri Colmenares said that the Duterte administration and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) \\"should be held responsible\\" for the killing of nine farmers. Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana accused Colmenares of having political motivations for criticizing the government for the incident. Lorenzana also made a statement condemning the incident. Anakbayan Cebu wrote on Twitter, saying that \\"vehemently condemns the fascist and terrorist acts of the Duterte regime towards the tillers of the land who are constantly victimized by his ferocious all-out war.\\" The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) also condemned the killings and called on the government \\"to give assurance that justice would be served for the victims.\\" Bayan Muna Representative Carlos Zarate labelled the incident as part of the \\"real Red October\\" plot, which originally referred to an alleged plot to overthrow President Duterte. \\"Ito ang tunay na (this is the real) Red October\\", Zarate said, referring to the so-called \\"Red October\\" destabilization plot to overthrow the Duterte administration. Women's group Gabriela Representative said that \\"this is a war against the people and a war against the poor.\\" On October 21, a resolution titled \\"House Resolution No. 2262\\" was filed by ACT Teachers Reps. Antonio Tinio and France Castro, Bayan Muna Rep. Carlos Zarate, Gabriela Reps. Emmi de Jesus and Arlene Brosas, Anakpawis Rep. Ariel Casilao, and Kabataan Rep. Sarah Elago, calling for the House committees to conduct an investigation on the incident. According to the Unyon ng mga Manggagawa sa Agrikultura (UMA) and the NFSW, the massacre brought the total of 45 number of farmers killed in Negros island alone under the presidency of Duterte. Senator Risa Hontiveros also pointed the finger to Duterte, saying that the killing occurred \\"under his watch\\". Former solicitor general Florin Hilbay said that the government should give justice for the farmers \\"who only desire to own the land\\". Netizens took part on their social media, decried the killings, and called for justice for the slain farmers. On October 22, militant groups gathered at Camp Aguinaldo; the group believed that the effect of the killing of the farmers is the \\"militarization\\". On October 23, Carlos Conde of Human Rights Watch made a statement, calling on the Duterte administration \\"to carry out a credible and impartial investigation\\" and he added that abuses of human rights in the Philippines are \\"not limited\\" to Duterte's drug war. On October 25, relatives of the victims and other militant groups gathered at Taft Avenue in Manila to protests the killings of the farmers and decried the low wages and the government's failure of giving the land reform to the workers.

After the news broke out, the authorities afterwards claimedhttps://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/regions/672283/minor-who-survived- sagay-massacre-arrested-by-police-labor-group/story/ that they intended for the minor to be turned over to his grandparents after being held in the Department of Social Welfare and Development custody. Former Bayan Muna representative Neri Colmenares, via Twitter, called for the immediate release of the minor.

Views from the top of Tangle Ridge provide photographers with an opportunity to capture the peaks surrounding the Columbia Icefield, some of which, such as Mount Columbia and Mount Alberta, are otherwise hidden from view along the Icefields Parkway.  History The mountain was named by Mary Sch√§ffer in 1907 for the difficulty that climbers had descending down Tangle Creek from the ridge. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1935 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Tangle Ridge is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C (‚àí4 ¬∞F) with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C (‚àí22 ¬∞F). Weather conditions during winter make Tangle Ridge one of the better places in the Rockies for ice climbing. Precipitation runoff from Tangle Ridge drains into the Sunwapta River which is a tributary of the Athabasca River.

The bridge is located at 83 Montague Street, between Woodgate Street and Gladstone Lane. The bridge has a very low height clearance of , and despite prominent signage warning tall vehicles not to approach, drivers who miscalculate the height of their vehicles frequently collide with and sometimes become wedged under the bridge. This has made the bridge a local landmark and the subject of much humorous media discussion. History Construction firm Johns & Waygood was contracted to build the bridge in 1914 as part of the infrastructure of the Port Melbourne railway line. Montague Railway Station was located just south of the bridge and mainly served workers at nearby factories. Flooding on Montague Street was a perennial problem; in 1916, the area around the bridge was under a foot of water and pedestrians could not approach it. In 1934, South Melbourne council raised the underlying street level by about two feet, thus lowering the height of the bridge. The last passenger train ran to Montague station on 10 October 1987 after it was announced that the line would be converted to light rail. The replacement light rail line was officially opened on 18 December 1987. Currently the bridge carries trams along route 109 between Box Hill and Port Melbourne. The bridge has a long history of vehicle collisions. In 2016 'Patrick' from Epping, a caller to Jon Faine's ABC radio program, reported having witnessed a vehicle hit the bridge in 1929, aged seven. \\"I was there ‚Ä¶ and a truck got stuck under that bridge,\\" he recalled. \\"I said to them, 'why don't you let his tyres down?',\\" adding that inflatable tyres were only new at the time. Meanwhile, 'Tony' from Blackburn, who managed the South Melbourne branch of a vehicle hire business during the 1970s, recalled that five or six trucks from his branch would hit the bridge each year. \\"How long does it take to get something done?\\" Tony rhetorically asked Faine. Notable crashes On 22 February 2016, a passenger bus carrying attendees of a conference at the nearby Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre attempted to drive under the bridge and hit it at . The impact peeled back the roof of the bus to the fifth row of seats. The driver, Jack Aston, was seriously injured, along with four women and two men, who suffered injuries including head and spinal fractures, broken collarbones and facial lacerations. Aston was convicted of negligently causing serious injury and sentenced to five years' imprisonment, but was released in 2019 after serving 10 months of the sentence when the charges were downgraded on appeal. Another bus owned by the same company had previously crashed into the bridge in March 2006, but the company did not have a policy to tell its drivers to avoid the area. On 20 June 2018, dashcam footage captured the moment a truck slammed into the bridge. Official responses In June 2016, the Victorian state government installed two warning gantries on the two main approaches to the bridge on Normanby Road and City Road. Black and yellow paddles hang from the gantries to the height of the bridge; if any of the paddles hit a vehicle as it drives under the gantry, this will warn the driver to divert their course to avoid hitting the bridge. Additional signage has been installed in surrounding streets, providing a total of 26 advanced warning signs about the bridge. Since the installation of the gantries, over a dozen more vehicles crashed into the bridge ‚Äì including a truck carrying sheets of glass on 13 June 2018. In the media Tom Waller is the founder of the website How Many Days Since Montague Street Bridge Has Been Hit, which tracks each \\"championship title bout\\" between the bridge and its vehicular opponents. The website has been operating since February 2016 and invites crowdsourced reports of new crashes. The bridge is also a popular topic for local TV, radio and news media, which note the frequency with which the bridge is hit. In June 2017, the Herald Sun reported, \\"Montague St bridge hit by truck once again\\", noting that \\"Melbourne's most-hit bridge has claimed another victim after it was struck by a truck yet again this afternoon ‚Ä¶ the third time the bridge has been hit in as many weeks.\\" Other media reports strike a more jocular tone: in February 2018, youth website Pedestrian.tv reported, \\"After 8 Months Dormant, The Awful Montague Street Bridge Has Awoken To Feed\\". The bridge has its own Twitter account and Facebook page, both of which are written in the first person, as if by the bridge itself. David Cosma has written a comedic song, 'Montague St Bridge', which includes the lyrics \\"Is it low?/Is it too low?/I don't know!/But I think I'm gonna go anyway.\\" Similar bridges The Napier Street Bridge, located in Footscray, in Melbourne's western suburbs, has a four-metre clearance and is similarly prone to vehicle crashes. Like the Montague Street Bridge, it has its own Twitter account. The Bayswater Bridge in Perth has a clearance of , and catalogues the crashes on a website modelled on the Montague Street Bridge website. The bridge has been struck eight times in 2018. Its days may be numbered, however, as a proposed upgrade to Bayswater railway station will move the station to a new, higher bridge. The 11 foot 8 Bridge (), (formally known as the Norfolk Southern‚ÄìGregson Street Overpass, and nicknamed \\"The Can-Opener\\"), is a railway bridge in Durham, North Carolina, USA, that averages one crash a month. In October 2019, the bridge was raised to . The \\"Fools Bridge\\" in Sofia Street, Saint Petersburg, Russia, also has its own humorous Twitter account. As of 2 February 2018, 140 vehicles had become stuck under the bridge.

The organization's efforts to facilitate immigration and calls for open borders attracted considerable amounts of coverage in the Mexican and American media. Pueblo Sin Fronteras seeks to \\"build solidarity bridges among peoples and tear down border walls imposed by greed.\\"  Operations  Pueblo Sin Fronteras, formed in 2009,Pueblo Sin Fronteras uses caravans to shine light on the plight of migrants is a transborder organization made up of human rights defenders of diverse nationality and immigration statuses that promotes accompaniment, humanitarian assistance, leadership development, recognition of human rights, and coordination of know-your-rights training along migrant routes, as well as monitoring and raising awareness of human rights. The group builds shelters for migrants on the trek north to the Mexican-American border and provides legal counsel to them. Activists affiliated with the group are present in the United States, where the organization actively raises funds and organizes protest actions against U.S. immigration policy. The organization is a member organization of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network. One of the group‚Äôs first programs offered classes to day laborers about workplace rights. The group expanded its work south of the border several years ago, inspired in part by the story of 72 Central American migrants who were kidnapped and massacred by a criminal group in northern Mexico in 2010. It opened two migrant shelters in the notoriously violent border state of Sonora in 2015 and 2016. The organization is notable for coordinating several high-profile migrant caravans in April 2018 and October 2018. These caravans, which traveled from Central America into Mexico, were the subject of widespread media coverage. Unlike the April caravan, the October 2018 caravan was not directly organized by Pueblo Sin Fronteras, with the group instead offering logistical support. Pueblo Sin Fronteras is sometimes confused with another group that no longer exists with the same name. The other Pueblo Sin Fronteras, was established in Chicago in 1987 to fight for immigration reform with a path to citizenship. However, in 2006, during the fight to block the deportation to Mexico of Elvira Arellano and separation from her U.S. born son, Pueblo Sin Fronteras changed its name to La Familia Latina Unida Sin Fronteras or FLU.

Prior to entering politics, Balz was a teacher in the Indianapolis public schools and a leader in the woman's club movement in the state. Balz was the president of the Indiana Federation of Women's Clubs from 1935 to 1937. In addition, she served as president of the New Harmony Memorial Commission from 1939 to 1947. Early life and education Arcada Campbell Stark was born on December 31, 1879, on a farm near Bloomington, Indiana, to Mary LeFevre (Weaver) and James Norbourn Stark. During her youth, the Stark family lived in Colorado and Kansas before moving to Indianapolis. Stark attended Indianapolis's Emmerich Manual High School and was a graduate of Indianapolis Normal College (which later became a part of Butler University) and Indiana University's Extension Division. Marriage and family Arcada Stark was married to Frederick C. Balz, the owner of the Star Millinery Company of Indianapolis. Career Educator and clubwoman Balz, a longtime resident of Indianapolis, began her career as a teacher prior to her marriage in the Indianapolis public schools, where she taught history, art, and literature to junior high school students. She also became active in the woman's club movement as a member of the Woman's Department Club of Indianapolis, where she chaired its literature, program, and applied education committees. In addition, she served as program chair, vice president, and president of the 7th District of the Indiana Federation of Women's Clubs, as well as chairperson of the press and publicity department, then first vice president, and from 1935 to 1937 as the state president of the Indiana Federation of Women's Clubs (later shortened to the Indiana Federal of Clubs).\\"Content Descriptions\\" in During Balz's tenure as state president of the Indiana Federal of Clubs, her home district raised $8,000 to purchase radium for a free cancer clinic at Indianapolis City Hospital and helped to develop orchestra programs in city schools. She also recommended that the IFC establish a forestation project in collaboration with the Indiana state government. She also began planning for the publication of History of the Indiana Federation of Clubs (1939). In addition to her work with the IFC, Balz served as a director from Indiana on the advisory board of the General Federation of Women's Clubs, and chaired the program committee for the GFWC's annual meeting in San Francisco, California, in 1939. Balz was involved in other civic affairs such as the Indiana State Advisory Public Health Council in 1937, the Indiana Division of the Federal Writers Project, and an appointment to the Governor's Safety Council under the McNutt administration. Politician Balz's political activities began in the late 1930s after she suggested establishing a New Harmony Memorial the preserve the historic community of New Harmony, Indiana. Governor M. Clifford Townsend appointed Balz to the New Harmony Memorial Commission, where she served as its president from 1939 to 1947. In November 1942, Balz became the first woman elected to the Indiana Senate, where she served two consecutive four-year terms from 1943 to 1950 representing Johnson and Marion Counties. Balz served on the Committee on Benevolent Institutions and in the 1947 session of the Indiana General Assembly, she chaired the Senate Committee on Public Health. As a women's rights advocate, Balz supported regulation of women's working hours and wages. Her other legislative interests included licensing nursing home care, efforts to improve school attendance, and establishing a merit system for state employees. Death and legacy Balz remained in Indianapolis after leaving the state legislature in 1950. She moved to Orlando, Florida, in 1969, and died there on August 18, 1973, at the age of 93.

Description  Different accounts offer wide-ranging descriptions of the creature. One of the earliest and most famous accounts by a local man named J.A. Johnson described an animal that was dull grey or brown and similar to an alligator, but much larger and heavier with a horn between its eyes and nostrils. Johnson and two others claimed to see the monster from twenty yards away and the men estimated the creature to be about forty feet long. Other reported sightings claim that the creature was similar to a very large catfish or mudpuppy. The Nebraska State Historical Society reports that contemporary accounts believed Johnson actually saw an unusually large beaver. common mudpuppy (Necturus maculosus)  Legend and legacy  The original legend of the Walgren Lake Monster claimed to be corroborated by Native American accounts of a similar beast inhabiting the lake. The initial story of a lake monster which devoured livestock sparked curiosity throughout Nebraska and abroad, even reaching the London Times. According to some articles published at the time, unsuccessful efforts were made to capture the monster. In her 1935 biography Old Jules, Mari Sandoz mentioned the monster and its notoriety. Sandoz claimed local fundamentalist Christians believed that the monster was created by Satan to test the faith of locals: \\"The same devil that scattered the fossil bones over the earth to confound those of little faith could plant a sea monster among the sinners\\". As time went on, the legend of the monster evolved to include the supposed supernatural abilities of the creature. The July 1938 issue of the Federal Writers Project in Nebraska's Tall Tales monthly publication offered a description of the monster's massive size, which reportedly caused the earth to tremble whenever he moved such that \\"the farmers become seasick for miles around\\". The article went on to claim that the monster came ashore daily to eat large numbers of livestock and in doing so created a thick, green mist which disoriented travelers in the area. The January 1962 edition of Outdoor Nebraska repeated the story as recorded in the 1938 telling, specifically corroborating the disorienting fog. The 1962 article exaggerates the claims of the 1938 story further by claiming a group of \\"eastern innocents\\" had fallen victim to the creature's earth-shaking and had been bounced from Hay Springs to Valentine, over one hundred miles away. The legend of the Walgren Lake Monster was likely created and distributed by John G. Maher, a Nebraska politician and newspaperman, as a sensational story to sell more newspapers. Maher is known for several other hoaxes perpetrated in Nebraska, such as burying a cement casting of a Buffalo Soldier in an archeological site near Chadron and proclaiming it a \\"petrified man\\", sinking bags of soda in a hot spring and reporting on the healing properties of the \\"soda springs\\", and warning that the British Navy was sailing up the Mississippi and Missouri rivers to punish Irish immigrants who supported the Irish Republic. Regardless of the probable hoax, the village of Hay Springs has embraced the monster as a local symbol, selling commemorative shirts and buttons as well as creating a replica of the monster based on Johnson's original description out of green flotation material.

Early years and education  On 5 November 1964, a boy named Carlos F. Barbas was born and he was raised up in St. Petersburg in Florida. After a few years, Barbas cultivated interests in physics and chemistry subjects and graduated from Eckerd College with honors. In 1989, he finished his Ph.D of Organic Chemistry with the help from TSRI Professor Chi- Huey Wong in Texas A&M; University. This is the end of Barbas's college life.  Career  From 1981 to 1991, Carlos F Barbas III started postdoctoral studies with Steven Benkovic at the Pennsylvania State University and doing researches with Richard Lerner at The Scripps Research Institute. From 1991 to 1995, he was Assistant Professor in the department of molecular biology at The Scripps Research Institute, where his studies emphasized on the developing new therapies against human diseases with the knowledge from the synthetic organic chemistry, molecular biology and medicine fields. From 1995 to 2000 he was the Associate Professor at TSRI. From 1997 to April 2001, Barbas dedicated his efforts in Prolifaron LLC as a co-founder. The main aim of founding this company is to put his research on antibodies into new therapies with the new technology. From 2002 to June 2008, he privately founded another company named CovX, which is specialized in the researches on bio therapeutics. In 2008, Zynegenia, a bio therapeutics company, was founded by Barbas. This time, Barbas dedicated to develop the next generation of drugs with the help of the antibodies invented in his researches.  Research  He developed the first laboratory manual of antibody phage with his colleagues at TSRI. The phage display is the most straight-forward technique to study the interactions between various forms of proteins with the virus infected bacteria. With the help of this technique, more studies on operations on specific part of human genes are available. He created ZF Tools with Jeff Mandell at TSRI. The zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) can target on the specific zones in DNA sequences which helps the researchers to identify the particular sites in any DNA sequence efficiently with ZF Tools. He created the first commercially catalytic antibodies in the world. Catalytic antibody are capable of accomplishing the tasks that have been designed by the researchers in the body, which helps the researchers to understand the mechanisms of the particular zone in human body in order to develop new drugs. Barbas and his co-workers at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) invented antibody-drug conjugates to help create new therapies which can target on specific cell types. These antibodies are programmed with chemical methods and specialized in treatments of chronic illnesses due to its ability to target on particular sites accurately. He studied on Hajos-Eder-Sauer-Wiechert reaction and developed theories on organocatalysis based on the studies of aldolase antibodies with L-Proline. He found the similarity between the Hajos-Eder-Sauer-Wiechert reaction and the mechanical canalization function happened in the aldolase antibodies and research on the difference between the efficiency. After researching the nucleic acid libraries, he emphasize on the functions of nucleotide triphosphates and came up with the idea of the creating the DNA enzymes which can provide vitro DNA selection studies. He also developed new therapies that can target HIV-1 and some kinds of cancer and put them in to clinical trails.  Awards  From 1992 to 1995, Barbas won the Scholar of The American Foundation for AIDS Research. Since 2003, Barbas is an ISI Highly Cited Research. In 2009, Barbas has been honored with numerous awards. New York Times reported that, \\"He was the recipient of the Investigator Award from the Cancer Research Institute, the Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award, Arthur C.

Ancient Greek religion was not standardised and had no formalised canon of religious texts, nor single priestly hierarchy, and practices varied greatly. However, ceremonial life in pre-Christian Greece generally involved offerings of a variety of forms towards gods and heroes, as well as a plethora of public celebrations such as weddings, burial rites, and festivals.  Offerings   Libation  A man pours out a libation as depicted on an Attic terracotta cup A libation is an offering involving the ritual pouring out of a liquid. In ancient Greece, such libations most commonly consisted of watered down wine, but also sometimes of pure wine, honey, olive oil, water or milk. It was a basic aspect of religion in ancient Greece, and possibly the most common religious practice. It was common to perform libations at the beginning and end of every day, and also at the beginning of meals, and was customarily paired with prayer to the gods, which was performed while standing upright and sometimes with their arms raised up. Libation commonly involved the pouring of wine from a handheld vessel. It was common to pour the substance from a wine jug into a bowl known as a phiale. Then, a part of the substance was poured from the phiale as an offering and the remainder is consumed. This ritual was repeated whenever wine was served. It was typical for libations from each bowl to be dedicated for a specific purpose. During a symposium, it was customary to serve three successive bowls of wine, where libations from the first bowl were usually dedicated either to the Olympians or to Agathos Daimon, libations from the second were usually dedicated to the heroes of Greek myth and libations from the third bowl were dedicated either to Zeus Teleios or to Hermes. Individuals could also make additional dedications to gods of their own choosing. It was common to also to perform libation as a part of animal sacrifices, where wine was poured onto the animal during the leadup to its sacrifice. Also, once the animal had been killed and burned, wine was poured onto the fire. Libations were also poured into the dirt, as a ritual to honour both the humans and gods who reside in the underworld. The Odyssey explains one such offering, where a hole is dug by Odysseus in the earth, and water, honey and wine are spilled around it. Such libations could also be performed by tipping over a large vessel containing the substance to be offered. Libations would include blood in order to honour heroes who participated in war, while offerings at tombs would more commonly have involved milk or honey.  Animal sacrifice  A scene depicting men sacrificing a pig on Ricci Hydria A key aspect of ceremonial life involved the sacrificing of domestic animals. This was performed at an altar usually located outside of temples. Animal sacrifices were also accompanied with singing and with prayer. The animal was chosen, and should be of good stock and in good health, and bulls were preferred over other animals, though sacrifices could involve cows, sheep, goats, pigs and birds, however sheep were the most common animal that was sacrificed. The animal was adorned with garlands and led by a girl towards the altar. This girl concealed the sacrificial knife in a basket that she held over her head. Libations would also be poured over the animal. Various hymns were sung and prayers said as the animal was killed, and once the animal is slain, women were supposed to cry out loudly. The animal was butchered and its components were used for different purposes. The hide was usually bequeathed to the temple to sell, while the blood was poured over the altar. The meat is prepared to be consumed by the celebrants while all the remaining inedible parts are gathered together and burned as an offering to the gods. Libations might also be poured on the fire at this time. When honouring the gods of the underworld however, animal sacrifices were quite different, and the whole of the animal was burned as in a holocaust. Animal sacrifices were practised at feasts in relation to the slaughtering of animals and the consumption of their meat. However, animal sacrifices were also used in order to win the favour of the gods, and so were used in times of disaster or before setting out upon some important mission, such as a military conflict.  Pharmakos  Pharmakos refers to the ritualistic sacrifice of a human scapegoat. This practice was used especially during times of disaster in order to appease the gods and to purify the community. However, it was also practised on a regular basis, such as on the first day of the Thargelia in Athens. Hipponax of Kolophon describes this process, where the two ugliest men that can be found were chosen to be sacrificed. Then, at the start of the Thargelia, the men were paraded around wearing fig-necklaces and beaten in the genitals using sticks from fig-trees. They were led to the seashore, where they were to be sacrificed, and killed by being stoned to death, then the corpses were burned and the ashes either cast into the sea or scattered onto the fields. Yet, there has been some contention about how reliable Hipponax's account was, especially given the time between when the ritual was performed and when Hipponax wrote. Over time, this sacrificial ritual changed to a less severe form of atonement for a criminal act. So at sites like Lefkada, criminals would sometimes be taken to be cast down from a cliff side, but he would be watched and caught underneath by men in boats, and his descent would be slowed by attaching birds or feathers to him. This reflected a distinctly non-lethal form of the scapegoat ritual which some scholars have used to support the idea that the pharmakos ceremony was never practised as an execution, and even in its earlier form, only involved stoning and severe beatings, but never to the point of death.Painting on ancient Greek ceramic depicting a bride preparing for her wedding.  Weddings  There were smaller rituals that would be performed before the wedding itself, such as a bath of purification, offerings and sacrifices made at the temple and a prenuptial feast. Among the different city-states of Ancient Greece, it was most common to perform the wedding ceremony after dusk. And at that time, the bride would be escorted by her family on the back of a chariot as it moved slowly toward the groom's house. This process of the bride leaving her father's house and joining her husband's was signified by the removal of the bride's veil. Another important ritual in the wedding ceremony was the offering up of an apple by the groom's family to be consumed by the bride. The wedding ceremony was formalised by the bride moving in to her husband's house as well as by the bride's father giving a dowry to the groom. Marriage ceremonies in Sparta differed greatly from the rest of the Greek city-states. Unlike in the rest of Greece, Spartan women had to consent for the marriage to be valid and not just her parents. The ceremony itself was also quite simple and short and would involve the bride and the groom engaging in hand-to-hand combat until the groom is able to overpower his bride and carry her back to his home. After the ceremony was complete, like in the other city-states, the families of the couple would celebrate over a feast.  Funeral rites  A terracotta plaque depicting the dead body being displayed, surrounded by family with women tearing out their hair in mourning. Prior to a person‚Äôs death, they would make arrangements for the care of their families and property, to say their final farewells and to pray. After the person had died, the body was washed and anointed with oil and often a wreath would be put around the deceased person‚Äôs neck. Then, coins would be put on the person‚Äôs eyes, it was believed that this would allow the individual to pay Charon, the ferryman of the dead, to transport them across the river Styx into the afterlife. In some cases, an amulet would be put on the mouth instead, while in some mystery cults, they would use a golden ornament, sometimes known as a ‚Äòpassport of the dead,‚Äô which carried important information for helping the deceased to find their way around in the underworld. The following day, the body was laid out for display. At this time, close female relatives of the deceased would lead the mourning by wailing loudly, hitting themselves and ripping their clothes and hair. Early the following day, usually before sunrise, the body would be led in a procession to where it would be laid to rest. And at this point, mourners would cut off a piece of their hair and offer it alongside libations to the deceased. Sometimes blood offerings were made also. Prayers were an important part of the burial process following the offerings. After the burial itself, the deceased person‚Äôs property would be cleansed with spiced saltwater, usually by their closest kinswomen and a feast would take place to honor all of the participants of the burial. And even after a person had been buried, it was important to continue to offer libations and cuttings of hair, as well as to regularly celebrate both recently deceased ancestors and the whole host of the dead at major ceremonies like the Genesia. However, funeral rites did vary both throughout the history of Ancient Greece as well as between the different city-states. For example, cremation was a common practice within the city-state of Athens. A picture of the Telesterion and the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kora at Eleusis in modern day Greece  Mystery cults  Mystery cults were a special aspect of religion in Ancient Greece, so named for the great level of secrecy associated with them. Unlike the rest of religious life in Ancient Greece, the rituals, practices and knowledge of mystery cults were only supposed to be available to their initiates, so relatively little is known about the mystery cults of Ancient Greece. Some of the major schools included the Eleusinian mysteries, the Dionysian mysteries and the Orphic mysteries.  Eleusinian Mysteries  Twice each year, initiates of the Eleusinian mysteries travelled to Eleusis from Athens along the sacred way, once in the spring for the Lesser Mysteries and then again around September for the Greater Mysteries. During the journey, celebrants would re-enact Demeter's search for her daughter Kore. Then the initiates stopped by a well, just as Demeter had, where they fasted and consumed a beverage made from mint and barley, which may have contained hallucinogenic properties. After they had consumed the drink, the initiates would enter the underground theater, known as the Telesterion, where the Mysteries actually took place. This stage may have consisted of a ritual re- enactment of the story of Demeter and Kore, and Kore's death and transformation into the figure of Persephone, with which the whole of the Eleusinian Mysteries is concerned. Many accounts and references to the Eleusinian mysteries describe them as having a profoundly powerful effect on the participants, and that many emerged from them without a fear of death.  Dionysian Mysteries  Less is known about the Dionysian Mysteries than the Eleusian Mysteries, but it seems to share the same theme of seasonal death and rebirth. Many of the ceremonies within the Dionysian mystery involve the idea of losing control of one's body, of returning to a more primal world and abandoning civilized society. Wine seems to have played a vital role to the Dionysian mysteries, but so did dancing and music, including the use of drums and bullroarers. A key aspect of the mysteries was the idea that by losing control of yourself in this way, the divine would come to inhabit your body.
