It is a wholly owned corporate subsidiary of the Venerable Order of St John. The Hospital Group is based in Jerusalem and is the main provider of eye care in the Palestinian territories. Gazan glaucoma patient. First site The original Hospital opened by The Order of St John in 1882 on the Bethlehem Road just south of the old city of Jerusalem. Queen Victoria granted the hospital a Royal Charter. Sir Edmund Lechmere, 3rd Baronet was one of the key figures in the establishment of the hospital. Lechmere and his wife were among the founders of Venerable Order of St John and had travelled several times to Jerusalem where they witnessed the need of its residents for eye care. During the First World War, the hospital was closed and its building was taken over by the Turkish Army, who used it to store ammunition. During the Battle of Jerusalem in 1917, the building was damaged. Following the establish of the British Mandate for Palestine, the architect Clifford Holliday was hired to renovate the building. Holliday also designed a new wing and the nearby St Andrew's Church that were both opened in 1930. The new wing was situated across the street, on the opposite side of Hebron Road. In the 1960s, after the hospital moved to its current location, the Clifford Holliday wing became an arts and crafts center (known as The Jerusalem House of Quality). In the 1970s, the original hospital building was sold to a developer who wanted to demolish it and build a hotel in its place. Following a campaign by the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, the developer was barred from demolishing the building; instead he was permitted to build an extension to it, in keeping with the original style of the building, and to renovate and preserve the original structure. The hotel was opened in the 1980s and was named the Mt. Zion Hotel. Second site Stone of the memorial in Muristan Street in the old city of Jerusalem, marking the location of the second site of the hospital (1949‚Äì1960) Following the 1949 Armistice Agreements between Israel and Jordan, the valley just below the hospital building and Mount Zion were a designated as no-man's land. The hospital could not operate in this location anymore, since it became a Front line dividing both sides. Additionally, access to the building was cut off from what became East Jerusalem. Between 1949 and 1960 the hospital operated from two houses owned by the Order in Muristan Street in the old city of Jerusalem. Third site The hospital's present building was opened in 1960 at Nashashibi Street in Sheikh Jarrah. Hospital St John of Jerusalem Eye Hospital Group's Jerusalem Hospital at Sheik Jarrah The main Jerusalem Hospital is an ISO and Joint Commission International accredited, general eye hospital. It has a 49-bed capacity and is staffed by both foreign and local specialist surgeons, doctors, paramedics, overseas medical volunteers and nurses. There is a large Outpatients Department and specialist retinal, corneal and pediatric services. The hospital also has a research unit. The hospital attracts a substantial number of volunteer doctors from around the world who not only help care for the patients but also help in the teaching and training of the local doctors. Satellite centres The St John Hebron Hospital opened in November 2015 In 2005 SJEHG set up a hospital in Hebron. The hospital provides cataract and laser eye surgery to treat diabetic retinopathy, and serves the 640,000 people that live in and around Hebron, including the semi-nomadic Bedouins of the Negev Desert. In November 2015 SJEHG moved into a new Hebron Hospital. In 2016 the hospital treated over 13,600 patients including performing over 500 major operations. In 2007, SJEHG set up its clinic in Anabta. The St John Anabta Clinic treats over 20,000 patients every year. The clinic is easily accessible from the major areas of Nablus, Tulkarem and Jenin. The Gaza Hospital St John Gaza Hospital has been providing charitable eye care for the 1.8 million residents of Gaza since 1992. In 2008 the hospital saw just over 16,000 patients and performed no major operations. In 2016, saw over 27,000 outpatients and performed over 500 major operations.

Trans Ros Schwartz. Holy virility. Pluto Press. New York. 1983 First published in France in as La Sainte Virilit√©,Reynaud, Emmanuel. La Sainte Virilit√©, Syros. Paris. 1981. Holy Virility explores how language and society place pressure upon men to behave in line with their socially gendered role. Reynaud calls for men to fight for self-realization in order to emancipate themselves. He states that association of power in male sexuality prevents men from enjoying sensual sex. Daniel Wesler-Lang, in his article D√©construire le masculin, probl√®mes √©pist√©mologiques, situates Reynauds thoughts within studies of masculinity and violence. Background on Holy Virility Holy Virility observes the different aspects of male power that is perpetrated on women. The book The Social Construction of Masculinity explains how Holy Virility and males are oppressed to measure up to the standards of being an identified male. The author Emmanuel Renaud argues that ‚ÄúIt is within men‚Äôs grasp to reject power relations and begin to behave in a way that is neither hierarchical nor exploitative.‚Äù The author explores different dynamics and is active in finding knowledge to educate men and women. The books main focus is on men‚Äôs biological makeup, sexuality, phallic orgasm, language, being a dad/rapist and being married. Emmanuel Reynaud explores and explains how men‚Äôs performance in society are supposed to be masculine. Emmanuel Reynaud born in France influences and educates the men‚Äôs movement in France. Today some of the concepts used in the book are seen in today‚Äôs society. Western and Eastern ideologies of being a man and women are different throughout history. Men abuse the power they have and seem hierarchal against women. Holy Virility is the social construction of masculinity. Men today are taught to act a certain way through gender, men for masculinity and female through acting feminine. Although, men and women can put on a performance of opposite genders. The Holy Virility explains the reasons why do men act the way they do and give concrete information about men's performance.

It is considered one of Battisti's masterpieces for signalling a significant departure from his previous records. Anima latina was Italy's eighth best-selling album of 1975. The album Anima latina was meant by Battisti as an experiment, \\"the exact point of rupture between [his] yesterday and [his] tomorrow\\".

Life and career He was the son of Johann von Hattorf and Anna M√ºlle, and married Marie Margarethe von Molan on 29 July 1705. Hattorf was one of fifteen ministers and advisers who came to Great Britain with George I in 1714. From that year until 1723, he served as secretary of the German Chancery with Andreas Gottlieb von Bernstorff as head. In July 1719, Hattorf and Northern Secretary James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope, pushed Bernstorff out of office, leaving Hanoverian politics to fall into the hands of British ministers.Derek McKay, 'The Struggle for Control of George I‚Äôs Northern Policy, 1718-19', The Journal of Modern History, vol. 45, no. 3 (September 1973), p. 383 Hans Caspar von Bothmer took over as de facto head of the Chancery in 1720 until Bernstorff formally retired in 1723. From that time on, Hattorf was the official Chancery office head, although Bothmer continued in his role as unofficial head until his own death in 1732. Unlike his predecessor, Hattorf lacked political confidence during the reigns of George I and George II and died quietly in 1737 at Hampton Court, being succeeded in his role by Ernst von Steinberg.

It is owned and operated by the National Trust for Scotland as an educational tourist attraction. Situated in a secluded area beside the Barry Burn (the watercourse, which provides its power), the mill lies about half a mile north of the village of Barry, near the town of Carnoustie. It is a three floor building, containing a meal floor (basement), a milling floor and a top (or \\"bin floor\\").Zealand & Zealand 1992, p. 2. A site for several mills since at least 1539, Barry Mill was commercially operational until 1984; it was then restored, and has been operated by the Trust since 1992. It was threatened with closure in March 2009, but has remained open due to local support, and the securing of external funding. Operation Barry Burn Sandstone millstones When in operation, the mill processes oats into oatmeal. (Oatmeal being a staple foodstuff, that in the past commonly formed part of the basic diet in Scotland.Indeed, in the 1770s, on visiting Scotland, the English author Samuel Johnson wrote of oats as \\"a grain which in England is generally given to horses, but in Scotland supports the people.\\" - The Life of Samuel Johnson by James Boswell, New York, 1858. Vol 3, p.11) Originally, the oats arrived in sacks from the neighbouring farms and had already been threshed. (There is an example of traditional threshing machine on display at the mill.) The oats were then dried in the mill's peat- fired kiln and then sent down a chute to the meal floor to be collected in sacks again. Today the oats arrive already processed, but the rest of the milling continues in the traditional style.Zealand & Zealand 1992, p. 6. The cog pit, showing the pit wheel (left), great spur wheel and a stone nut. The oats are hoisted to the bin floor at the top of the mill, from where they are emptied into a hopper that feeds one of the mill's two pairs of millstones situated on the mill floor. This pair of sandstone millstones shells the grain, and the output is then sent down a chute to the basement where the shelled oats (\\"groats\\") are separated from the husks using a fan. The groats are then hoisted back to the top floor and fed through the second pair of millstones (made of French burr stone). This produces the oatmeal, which descends to the basement for bagging.Zealand & Zealand 1992, pp. 6-9. The mill is powered by the Barry Burn: there is a working dam and lade half a mile upstream, which channel water to the mill wheel. The wheel is diameter, and is powered by the water dropping down from the lade on downstream side of the overshot waterwheel . The mill's power is controlled by a series of levers, cogs and gears in the basement. These supply power to the millstones, to the hoists, and to a fan that is used to separate the groats from the chaff.Zealand & Zealand 1992, p. 5. History The mill and its lade The earliest reference to a mill on this site dates from 1539. Indeed, there were originally two mills on the Barry Burn, both owned by Balmerino Abbey in Fife: a corn mill (\\"the Nether Mill\\") and an oat mill (\\"the Over Mill\\"). The properties of the abbey were annexed by the crown in 1587 as a result of the Scottish Reformation, and were granted to James Elphinstone, 1st Lord Balmerino in 1605. The mills were sold to a Robert Watson in the late 17th century and subsequently inherited by Watson's son-in-law, Robert Gardyne in the 1680s.Zealand & Zealand 1992, p. 13. Milling at the Nether Mill was discontinued and the structure, dating to 1783, is now used as a store building. In 1814, the Over Mill (which became known simply as \\"Barry Mill\\") was destroyed by a fire and the today's structure dates from its rebuilding by the owner, Thomas Gardyne of Middleton and Barry.Zealand & Zealand 1992, p. 14. The mill was purchased by the Gunn family in 1926 before being further extended in the 1930s.Zealand & Zealand 1992, p. 15. Barry Mill continued to produce oatmeal until the late 1970s. After that time it was used only to produce animal feed, until flood damage to the mill lade finally ended commercial operations in 1984. The derelict mill was acquired by the National Trust for Scotland in 1988, and was fully restored over the next four years, to the condition it had enjoyed in 1814).Zealand & Zealand 1992, pp. 17-19. It was reopened by the Trust in 1992, and has since operated on a demonstration basis. Demonstrations are offered at weekends or for parties by prior arrangement, although the mill is also operational at other times. The mill's stables have been converted into a visitor centre, and the mill itself also contains displays about the life and work of both mill and millers. The mill and the nearby bridge which was part of the old road from Barry Grange to Panbride were both granted Category B listed buildings status by Historic Scotland in 1971. The Nether Mill building was granted Category C listing in 1980. Barry Mill was granted category A listing in December 2009. Closure threat In 2009, the mill was one of the least visited of the Trust's properties, attracting about 2,000 annual visitors. In March 2009, the Trust, facing financial difficulties, listed the loss-making Barry Mill as one of 11 of its properties threatened with immediate closure, unless external sponsorship could be found. The intention was to \\"moth-ball\\" the mill until financial circumstances were better. On 25 March, at a public meeting, \\"Friends of Barry Mill\\" was formed in an attempt to raise funds and to campaign to save the mill. In July 2009, the Trust announced that the property would continue to operate \\"for the foreseeable future\\" and that this was made possible due to support pledged by Angus Council and the Gibson Graham Charitable Trust.

The symbols and strings of symbols may be broadly divided into nonsense and well-formed formulas. A formal language can be thought of as identical to the set of its well-formed formulas. The set of well-formed formulas may be broadly divided into theorems and non-theorems. A logical symbol is a fundamental concept in logic, tokens of which may be marks or a configuration of marks which form a particular pattern. Although the term \\"symbol\\" in common use refers at some times to the idea being symbolized, and at other times to the marks on a piece of paper or chalkboard which are being used to express that idea; in the formal languages studied in mathematics and logic, the term \\"symbol\\" refers to the idea, and the marks are considered to be a token instance of the symbol. In logic, symbols build literal utility to illustrate ideas. Overview Symbols of a formal language need not be symbols of anything. For instance there are logical constants which do not refer to any idea, but rather serve as a form of punctuation in the language (e.g. parentheses). Symbols of a formal language must be capable of being specified without any reference to any interpretation of them. A symbol or string of symbols may comprise a well- formed formula if it is consistent with the formation rules of the language. In a formal system a symbol may be used as a token in formal operations. The set of formal symbols in a formal language is referred to as an alphabet (hence each symbol may be referred to as a \\"letter\\")John Hopcroft, Rajeev Motwani and Jeffrey Ullman, Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation, 2000 A formal symbol as used in first-order logic may be a variable (member from a universe of discourse), a constant, a function (mapping to another member of universe) or a predicate (mapping to T/F). Formal symbols are usually thought of as purely syntactic structures, composed into larger structures using a formal grammar, though sometimes they may be associated with an interpretation or model (a formal semantics). Can words be modeled as formal symbols? The move to view units in natural language (e.g. English) as formal symbols was initiated by Noam Chomsky (it was this work that resulted in the Chomsky hierarchy in formal languages). The generative grammar model looked upon syntax as autonomous from semantics. Building on these models, the logician Richard Montague proposed that semantics could also be constructed on top of the formal structure: :There is in my opinion no important theoretical difference between natural languages and the artificial languages of logicians; indeed, I consider it possible to comprehend the syntax and semantics of both kinds of language within a single natural and mathematically precise theory. On this point I differ from a number of philosophers, but agree, I believe, with Chomsky and his associates.\\" Richard Montague, Universal Grammar, 1970 This is the philosophical premise underlying Montague grammar. However, this attempt to equate linguistic symbols with formal symbols has been challenged widely, particularly in the tradition of cognitive linguistics, by philosophers like Stevan Harnad, and linguists like George Lakoff and Ronald Langacker.

He played college basketball at Purdue University. In his junior season, Jackson led the Boilermakers with 4 assists per game and shooting 50.3 percent from the floor. As Purdue's primary point guard, he was named Honorable Mention All-Big Ten as well as a Bob Cousy Award candidate in 2011 and 2012. High school career Jackson attended Eisenhower High School, located in Decatur, Illinois, where he played basketball under head coach, Jeremy Moore. During his senior season, Lewis averaged 21.7 points and 10 assists a game, while being named Illinois' 2008 Big School Player of the Year by MidStateHoops.com., while finishing third for Illinois' Mr. Basketball and earning area Player of the Year honors. He was also a member of Indiana's Elite AAU squad. College career Purdue 2008‚Äì09 After graduating high school, Jackson attended Purdue University to play under head coach, Matt Painter, and along with All-Conference players in E'Twaun Moore, Robbie Hummel, and JaJuan Johnson. In his freshman season, Jackson used his speed and ball handling skills to become the team's starting point guard, where he started in 30 of the 36 games in which he appeared, while setting a school freshman record with most games played in a season. His 30 starts were two less than Russell Cross's 32 starts in 1981. Leading Purdue in assists with 3.4 a game, his 118 on the season is second most by a freshman behind Bruce Parkinson's 147 mark in 1973. On January 27, 2009, Lewis ran into a hard pick made by Wisconsin's Joe Crabbenhoft early in the game, where he sustained a concussion, forcing him to sit out a game. He scored in double figures seven times (3-4), while averaging 5.9 points per game and handing off 3.4 assists a game to lead the Boilers on the season. After leading the boilers to an 11-7 record in Big Ten play and to a 27-10 overall record and a Sweet Sixteen appearance, Lewis was named to the Big Ten All-Freshman Team, along with the likes of current NBA player, Byron Mullens. 2009‚Äì10 In the spring of 2009, Jackson was involved in a traffic stop in his hometown of Decatur, Illinois, resulting in community service and missing the two exhibition games, as well as the season opener. After sitting out the three designated games for his suspension, Lewis injured his foot during practice, which left him sidelined, wearing a foot cast after he received surgery. On January 28, 2010, Lewis appeared in his first game of the season in a home meeting against Wisconsin. As the team's primary point guard, he helped lead AP-ranked #6 Purdue to a 14-4 conference record (10-1 in games which he appeared) and onto a Big Ten title, the program's first in fourteen years. On March 3, 2010, Lewis had a huge performance with 9 points, 5 assists, and 3 rebounds in a win against in-state rivals, Indiana. With nine games recording 4+ assists on the season, including a 9 assist performance against Siena in the First Round of the NCAA Tournament, where he also pulled down 6 rebounds and scored 8 points. He led Purdue with an average of 3.5 assists per game. Jackson helped Purdue to consecutive Sweet Sixteen appearances and onto a 29-6 record. 2010‚Äì11 At full health entering the 2011 season, Jackson averaged 8 points, while leading Purdue with 4 assists and shooting 50.3 percent from the floor as a junior. He averaged 3.2 rebounds and shot 71.6 at the line, as well. He grabbed season highs of 6 rebounds twice against Valparaiso and North Florida, scored 11 points against Valparaiso, and a career-tying high with 9 assists against Austin Peay. In a game against IPFW, Lewis had 8 assists and 8 points with no turnovers. He scored a then-career high 17 points in a road game at Penn State. On January 22, Jackson scored a new career high 19 points against Michigan State. Lew scored in double figures eleven times. On December 20, Jackson was named a Bob Cousy Award candidate. Becoming more of a needed scoring option for the Boilers, he averaged 10.2 points a game in conference play (14-4) and helped lead the Boilers to a 2nd-place finish. Jackson was named Honorable Mention All-Big Ten. He helped Purdue to the Third Round of the NCAA Tournament, finishing with a 25-8 record. 2011‚Äì12 Jackson joined fellow seniors Robbie Hummel and Ryne Smith as tri-captain for the 2012 Purdue basketball team. Beginning the season with a troubling foot, he managed to average 12.5 points and 4 assists in his first four outings of the season (4-0). On November 18, 2011 against Temple, Lewis recorded a career high 26 points, shooting 8-14 from the floor and making 10 of 11 at the free throw line. Two days later, Jackson tallied a career high 9 rebounds in a loss to #15 ranked Alabama. On December 19, Jackson was named a candidate for the Bob Cousy Award for the second year in a row. Leading Purdue to a 20-11 record, Jackson averaged 10.4 points (2nd on team), 4.2 assists (1st), 1.3 steals (1st), and 3.2 rebounds (3rd), while shooting 72.8 percent at the line. In early December, Lewis began battling foot pains and back strains, forcing him to miss a majority of practice time. On the season, he's scored in double figures 16 times, which includes two 20+ point performances (2-0). Jackson held one of the best assist to turnover ratios in the nation, leading the Big Ten, while having the most career assists (451) amongst active Big Ten players, just ahead of Wisconsin's Jordan Taylor. At the culmination of the regular season, Jackson, along with teammate DJ Byrd, was named Honorable Mention All-Big Ten, a repeat for Jackson. On March 9 in the quarterfinals of the Big Ten Tournament in a loss to #7 Ohio State, Lew dished a career high 10 assists, while recording his first double-double, scoring 10 points. In his last season at Purdue, Jackson led the Boilers to the third round of the NCAA Tournament, losing to Kansas. He led them to a 22-13 overall record on the season.

He married Marie Luise von Wendt in 1726 and replaced Johann Philipp von Hattorf as German Chancery head upon his death in 1737. He gained his position due to the influence of his cousin, Amalie von Wallmoden, the future Countess of Yarmouth, who was the mistress of George II. He was politically conservative and rarely expressed his opinion to King George, acting instead as primarily a secretary. He did, however, participate in court life and was the first Hanoverian minister to be active in the British court. His successor, Philipp Adolph von M√ºnchhausen, would follow in his footsteps. Steinberg resigned his post in 1748 and returned to Hanover. He and his wife had a son, George Friedrich, and a daughter, Eva.  Sources  * Jeremy Black, George II: Puppet of the Politicians?

It is a sister party of the Israeli Labor Party (Havodah), and Meretz. It is affiliated to the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland. Its objects are to maintain and promote Labour or Socialist Zionism as the movement for self-determination of the Jewish people within the state of Israel, and to support, develop and promote political activists who work to enable the objects and values of the Jewish Labour Movement. Aims and membership The organisation's aim is stated as \\"To organise and maintain a political movement of Jewish people within the UK Labour Party and the international labour movement\\". Full membership is open to Jewish people, while non-Jewish supporters can apply for ally membership. Only full members are eligible for a vote in JLM processes and internal elections. Members of parties which oppose the Labour Party in elections are ineligible for membership. The values of the JLM are centred around a connection between Socialism, the Labour Party and Socialist Zionism, and the values which are espoused by these movements, including international peace and cooperation, social justice, equality and freedom. This doctrine is enshrined in the organisation's constitution and values, which state their values as including 'international peace and cooperation,' 'democratic socialism in the UK and Israel, 'the application of 'Jewish ethical principles to create a society based on social justices and a sustainable environment', 'to promote the centrality of Israel in Jewish life' and opposition to 'fascist, racist and anti-Semitic groups.' Poale Zion Establishment The origins of Poale Zion in Britain were in the Ma'aravi (\\"Western\\") Society, formed in London in 1902 by Jewish socialist journalist Kalman Marmor, under the influence of the Eastern European Labour Zionist movement led by Marxist theorist Ber Borochov.Alderman, Geoffrey Modern British Jewry, Clarendon Press, 1998, p. 175. Branches of Poale Zion were formed in London and Leeds in 1903/04 and 1905 respectively,Cohen, Stuart A. English Zionists and British Jews: The Communal Politics of Anglo-Jewry, 1895‚Äì1920 Princeton University Press, p. 59-60.Fishman, William. East End Jewish Radicals London: Duckworth 1975 p. 306. and in Manchester and Liverpool by 1906. Two branches were formed in London, one by the garment workers union, one by the Independent Cabinet Makers Union.Alderman, p. 76. A permanent headquarters was opened in Whitechapel in February 1904, and a nationwide organisation was launched at a conference in Manchester in 1906.Mendes, p. 217.Alderman, p. 74. Early 20th century Poale Zion was active in Britain during World War I, under the leadership of J Pomeranz and Morris Meyer, and influential on the British labour movement, including on the drafting (by Sidney Webb and Arthur Henderson) of the Labour Party‚Äôs War Aims Memorandum, recognising the \\"right of return\\" of Jews to Palestine, a document which preceded the Balfour Declaration by three months.Gorny, chapter 1. In this period, it published the periodical Jewish Labour Correspondence. After World War I, Poale Zion published several pamphlets in Yiddish and a Yiddish journal, Undzer Veg. Shlomo Kaplansky collaborated with the Independent Labour Party in setting up the Vienna International of socialist parties. In mid-1920, the World Union of Poale Zion in Vienna set up a Poale Zion office in London, led by Shlomo Kaplansky and David Ben-Gurion. The office was in rooms in Petticoat Lane, where Moshe Sharett worked part-time translating Yiddish into English. They built contacts with both Labour and the Independent Labour Party,Gorny, p. 27. and succeeded in becoming affiliated to the British Labour Party in 1920 under the name of The Jewish Socialist Labour Party, claiming membership of 3,000, although actual membership was a few hundred. One issue that they tried to influence policy on was the northern border of Palestine which was being decided at the San Remo conference. They hoped that it would be extended as far as the Litani River. They had only limited success in influencing Labour Party Middle East policy and the office closed in March 1921.Teveth, Shabtai (1987) Ben-Gurion. The Burning Ground. 1886‚Äì1948. Houghton Mifflin. . pp. 169, 172, 174‚Äì5, 177.Gorny, p. 25. However, party leader Ramsay MacDonald was influenced by PZ, who would publish his pamphlet A Socialist in Palestine (1922) documenting his visit to Palestine.NelsonÔøΩ Ian Martin (2008) THE BRITISH NEW LABOUR PARTY AND POLITICAL ZIONISM: CONTINUITY OF AN ESSENTIAL DILEMMA, Durham theses, Durham University.

World PZ leader Dov Hoz was based in the UK in 1928, and set about reviving and re-organising Poale Zion (Great Britain), including inspiring PZ members to become more active in the mainstream Labour Party.Gorny, p. 54. Young Poale Zion was launched in Bethnal Green in 1928, by Sam Dreen.Rubinstein and Jolles, p. 228. Poale Zion and Dov Hoz played a crucial role in the 1930 Whitechapel and St Georges by-election, swinging the Jewish vote behind the non-Jewish Labour candidate, James Henry Hall, rather than the Jewish Liberal candidate Barnett Janner.Gorny, chapter 4. In the 1940s, Poale Zion (Great Britain) claimed a membership of nearly 2,000. Late 20th century In 1957, Poale Zion played a role in the formation of Labour Friends of Israel,Edmunds with which it continues to work. In June 1982, Poale Zion formed a Scottish branch, with the MP for East Kilbride, Maurice Miller, becoming its chair.Edmunds, p. 136. In the mid-1980s, PZ claimed a paper membership of 2,000.Silver, Robert. \\"Labour loses the Jews\\", The Spectator 15 December 1984, p. 13. Retrieved 9 April 2019. Before the Arab-Israeli war of 1967, Poale Zion represented the dominant pro-Zionist view within the British Labour Party. However, as the left became increasingly anti-Zionist, relations with the left of the party were increasingly tense. For instance, in April 1983 women members of Poale Zion were prevented from attending an International Women's Day seminar at the Greater London Council's County Hall, and in 1984 it was proposed that the Labour Party end the connection. In 1985, Eric Heffer suggested Poale Zion as a model for a black socialist society, as a way for Labour Party Black Sections to represent black and minority members within the party structure.Sydney Jeffers \\"Black Sections in the Labour Party\\" in Pnina Werbner and Muhammed Anwar, eds, Black and Ethnic Leaderships, Routledge, 2009 In the 1990s, PZ affiliated to the Anti- Racist Alliance, a black-led anti-racist movement closely aligned to the Labour Party Black Sections and founded by Marc Wadsworth, and later to its successor the National Assembly Against Racism.Georg Lentze Racial Thinking in the British Labour Party, University of Southampton PhD, p.222 Leading postwar members of Poale Zion included Maurice Orbach MP;MendesAlderman, p. 101.

Jewish Labour Movement 2004‚Äì2015 Poale Zion (Great Britain) was relaunched as the Jewish Labour Movement (JLM) in 2004 in response to changes within global left Zionism during the Second Intifada, with an increased focus on Britain's Jewish community. Louise Ellman recounts that the July 2004 'launch at the House of Commons was a highly successful event, with the Israeli Ambassador and the Foreign Office Minister responsible for Middle East matters as guest speakers. Messages of goodwill were delivered from the Prime Minister, the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the World Labour Zionist Movement'. Louise Ellman rose from being vice-chair to chair in 2006, a position she held until 2016.

The 2016 restructure After ten years as chair, Louise Ellman retired as Chair to become Honorary President. Her successor, Jeremy Newmark, was a former CEO of the UK's Jewish Leadership Council and a former spokesperson for the previous Chief Rabbi, Jonathan Sacks. He had also stood as a Labour candidate for Parliament in 2017, in Finchley and Golders Green. Sarah Sackman and Mike Katz were elected as Vice-Chairs. Sackman had stood as Labour's candidate in the Finchley and Golders Green constituency in the 2015 general election while Katz was selected as a Labour Party candidate in the 2016 London Assembly election. Peter Mason, the former director of London Jewish Forum and a councillor in Ealing, became national secretary. He was also elected to Labour's National Constitutional Committee, which handles disciplinary cases, the first JLM candidate to be elected to a national committee for 20 years. It followed a report by former Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti that recommended a transfer of powers to the NCC. The Jewish Chronicle, observing that '(JLM's) affiliation to Labour as a socialist society means it benefits from inside access to the party's various structures and systems', said that 'Mr Newmark is adamant that, to win the battle, Jews have to remain in the party rather than decamp in the face of Jew-hatred.' Newmark said \\"There are some people who have left the party. I respect their position and understand it up to a point but I don't agree with it on any level. If you leave a political vacuum, others will come in and fill it. The whole purpose of JLM is to become an organising focus within the party and a space for people who feel Labour is their political home.\\" In March 2016, David Hirsh of Engage, in an article entitled \\"Jew hate and today‚Äôs Left\\", noted that \\"The Jewish Labour Movement‚Äîthe old Poale Zion‚Äîis emerging as a key organising focus within the Labour Party.\\" The JLM was described by the Jewish Chronicle as a 'gathering-place for moderates concerned about the direction the party is taking under Mr Corbyn' and affiliate membership was established for non-Jews. Membership increased to around 1,000 with a \\"flood\\" of affiliate members showing their \\"support and solidarity\\". The 2016 JLM annual general meeting voted unanimously to adopt a new structure to enable it to increase its engagement inside the Labour Party on a local, regional and national basis. In the 2016 Labour Party leadership election, when MPs unsuccessfully sought to replace Jeremy Corbyn, JLM nominated Owen Smith after over 90% of its members voted for him in an internal ballot. Some commentators concluded that the revived JLM wished to remove or weaken Corbyn and others sympathetic to the Palestinians. Young people who had had some success in their early political careers were appointed to a range of roles in the organisation. They included networks officer, Rachel Wenstone, former National Union of Students vice-president; political education officer, Jay Stoll, a senior parliamentary assistant to a Labour MP and former general secretary of the London School of Economics' student union; campaigns officer, Adam Langleben, who had been elected to Barnet Council; and youth and student officer, Liron Velleman, still a student but holding a role in the party's Chipping Barnet branch. In July 2016, Ella Rose was appointed as the organisation's first director.Jackman, Josh. \\"Jewish Labour Movement appoints first director\\". The Jewish Chronicle. 20 July 2016. Retrieved 9 April 2019. Rose was formerly a Union of Jewish Students president and a Public Affairs Officer at the Israeli Embassy. She also sat on the Advisory Board of the Jewish Leadership Council's Lead programme and on the Board of Deputies of British Jews. In September 2017, the JLM held its first ever one day conference. By February 2018, the JLM had over 2,000 members, according to National Secretary Peter Mason. Leadership and organisation In February 2018, Jeremy Newmark resigned as chair of the JLM after The Jewish Chronicle published an internal audit report into his conduct while he was CEO of the Jewish Leadership Council. It was alleged that, between 2006 and 2013, he defrauded the council of more than ¬£10,000. The newspaper claimed that the council had covered up his alleged behaviour and accepted his resignation on the grounds of ill health. Newmark denied any wrongdoing, though he resigned as Chair of the JLM two days later to enable him to respond to the allegations. Later in February, the JLM reported some financial matters to the police for investigation. He was replaced by Ivor Caplin. In October 2018, the Director, Ella Rose, left for a role with the Holocaust Educational Trust. In April 2019, Mike Katz was elected National Movement Chair, defeating Ivor Caplin, and Ruth Smeeth was elected as Parliamentary Chair, succeeding Luciana Berger, who resigned from the Labour Party in February 2019. Joe Goldberg, Sarah Sackman and Stephane Savary were elected as National Vice-Chairs. In January 2020, Margaret Hodge became Parliamentary Chair while Ruth Smeeth, who was no longer an MP, became a National Vice-Chair. In October 2019, the Honorary President, Louise Ellman, resigned from the Labour Party but said that she was not planning to support another party, meaning she remained eligible to be a member. The Jewish Labour Movement has a Local Government Network which seeks to recruit ambassadors in every Labour Group across the country to be a point of contact, educate local members and work with JLM nationally. Its Jewish Councillors Network provides a space for and support to Jewish Labour councillors nationally as representatives and campaigners for the Party and political leaders and role models within the Jewish community. The Youth and Students section provides 14-26 year old members a network and opportunities to engage with the JLM and the Labour Party. Relationship with the Party At the September 2017 Labour Party Conference, new rules proposed by the Jewish Labour Movement were adopted making hate speech a disciplinary offence. In March 2018, the JLM supported a demonstration by Jewish groups against the Labour Party leadership's handling of antisemitism. In April 2018, the Jewish Labour Movement asked for and received a guarantee that JLM would remain Labour's only Jewish affiliate, after suggestions that Jewish Voice for Labour might be allowed to affiliate. This was one of 19 requests made by JLM to the Labour Party, alongside six set by Jewish community organisations. In September 2018, as the JLM asked, Labour added all 11 IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism examples, unamended, to the Party's code of conduct. In October 2018, the JLM appealed to Labour Party members to send it examples of antisemitism within Labour. In November 2018, the JLM submitted a dossier of examples to the Equality and Human Rights Commission and asked it to investigate the Labour Party which, it said, was \\"institutionally anti-Semitic\\". In March 2019, Jeremy Corbyn wrote to the JLM conveying his and the shadow cabinet's ‚Äúvery strong desire for you to remain a part of our movement‚Äù following reports that it was considering disaffiliating. In April 2019, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown and the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, announced that they had joined the JLM. Brown said that he joined to support Jews in light of antisemitism in the Labour Party. Khan said he had joined \\"to demonstrate 'support and appreciation'\\" for British Jews. In April 2019, JLM decided to remain affiliated to the Labour Party but passed a motion of no confidence in Jeremy Corbyn over his alleged mishandling of anti-Semitism within the party. In July 2019, JLM described Labour's appointment of a liaison officer to improve the party's relationships with the Jewish community as a \\"pointless, ineffective gesture\\". In September 2019, the JLM held a rally at the Middle Street Synagogue in Brighton during the Labour Party Conference. Speakers included MPs, Ruth Smeeth, Margaret Hodge, Alex Sobel, Louise Ellman, Stella Creasy and Rosie Duffield, Seb Dance MEP, the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, Luke Akehurst, director of We Believe in Israel and secretary of Labour First, Nathan Yeowell, director of Progress, Miriam Mirwitch, chair of Young Labour and Rania Ramli, chairperson of the recently disbanded Labour Students. Smeeth said that \\"This isn‚Äôt a fight for Jews (or) equality in the party - this is a fight for the Labour Party.\\" Hodge drew loud cheers when she promised that \\"I‚Äôm not going to give up until Jeremy Corbyn ceases to be leader of the Labour Party.\\" In December 2019, the JLM made a submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commission as part of the EHRC's investigation into anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. It offered alleged incidents of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, including the description of Jewish Labour MP Margaret Hodge as a 'Zionist remedial cancer' and a 'Zionist bitch,' as well as the discriminatory practices of the South Tottenham CLP towards prospective ultra- orthodox Jewish members. It also alleged the labelling of Jews as 'child killers,' 'subhuman' and 'Zio scum,' and told of how Jews were told that 'Hitler was right.' In 2020, the JLM nominated Lisa Nandy in the 2020 Labour Party leadership election and Ian Murray in the 2020 Labour Party deputy leadership election, in both cases by a small margin. Training Following its 2016 restructuring, JLM offered training on antisemitism awareness to Constituency Labour Parties. In 2018, the JLM refused to provide antisemitism awareness training to those subject to disciplinary proceedings as they did not believe training was an appropriate sanction. In August 2018, the JLM refused to offer training at the Party's annual conference, after disagreeing with the Party leadership over its content. In March 2019, the JLM suspended their training programme. JLM said that their role had been undermined after the Labour Party announced it planned to enrol staff and members of the National Executive Committee and National Constitutional Committee on a short course on antisemitism being developed by the Pears Institute for the Study of Antisemitism, despite Labour's stated intention of consulting Jewish communal organisations prior to its implementation. In July 2019, JLM suspended a member who had continued to provide training on antisemitism. In July 2019, the JLM refused to collaborate with the Labour Party in developing educational materials on antisemitism. In June 2020, the JLM said they would not undertake antisemitism training for all Labour staff, as Keir Starmer had requested, while \\"staff who were central to the failure to deal with antisemitism under Mr Corbyn remained in their jobs\\". Campaigning In April 2019, Katz said that JLM would be selective in campaigning for Labour candidates in future elections, saying \\"If you‚Äôre backing the leadership and the way they have handled antisemitism ‚Äì then you are absolutely not going to get our support\\" and \\"If you clearly and consistently support us...then we will have your back\\". JLM said their members would not campaign for Lisa Forbes in the June 2019 Peterborough by-election after it was revealed she had liked a social media post of a video of children praying in solidarity with the victims of the Christchurch mosque shootings with accompanying text which commented that Theresa May had a 'Zionist slave masters agenda', and had expressed her 'enjoyment' in reading a thread which included a comment that Islamic State had been founded and funded by the CIA and Mossad. Forbes said that she had liked the video and the content of a long thread of posts and had not noticed the specific comments. In October 2019, The Jewish Chronicle reported that the JLM's members would not campaign in support of Labour candidate Ross Houston in Finchley and Golders Green in the December 2019 general election as a show of solidarity with its previous Parliamentary Chair, Luciana Berger, who was standing for the Liberal Democrats in the seat. It was later reported that day that the JLM had announced that ‚ÄúWe will not be campaigning unless in exceptional circumstances and for exceptional candidates, like our parliamentary chair Ruth Smeeth, and members of the parliamentary Labour party who‚Äôve been unwavering in their support of us. We will not be giving endorsements to candidates in non-Labour-held seats‚Äù. According to The Independent, JLM \\"is expected to draw attention (during the campaign) to Labour MPs who it believes have a poor record of tackling antisemitism\\". Responses The JLM has attracted some criticism from within the Labour Party. Critics contended that the JLM had become largely dormant by the early 21st century and was only revived following the election of Jeremy Corbyn. In September 2017, Michael Kalmanovitz, of the International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network, at a fringe meeting hosted by the \\"Free Speech on Israel\\" group alongside the Labour Party conference, asked \\"What are JLM and LFI doing in our Party? It‚Äôs time we campaigned to kick them out\\". At the same conference, a number of Jewish members of the Labour Party launched Jewish Voice for Labour as \\"an alternative voice for Jewish members of Labour\\" who do not support the Jewish Labour Movement's \\"profoundly Zionist orientation\\", contending that \\"the JLM cannot represent all Jewish members of the Labour Party when it is committed 'to promote the centrality of Israel in Jewish life' as well as the wider Jerusalem Programme of the World Zionist Organization.\\" In March 2018, the Morning Star criticised the JLM for its \\"unquestioning zionism\\" and for being \\"unscrupulous enough to call fellow Jews anti-semites when the real fallout is between zionists and anti-zionists.\\" In April 2018, after the JLM voted that it had no confidence in Corbyn, the political secretary of the Labour Representation Committee commented ‚Äú[JLM] is campaigning to make a Labour government impossible!

(pp. 99‚Äì100) Early years in the New York underworld John Lewis was born in New York City, although his background remained a mystery to both the underworld and authorities for much of his life. Lewis did not have a criminal record with the New York City Police Department and was one of the few underworld figures to have avoided being \\"booked\\" by the famed Central Office despite being investigated for an unsolved homicide. It was the Mulberry Police Precinct that investigated this claim, at the time mostly based on rumor but one which he had admitted to, yet was cleared after finding no evidence to substantiate these claims. He first became known as an up-and-coming thug for hire from the Lower East Side and began frequenting \\"Big\\" Jack Zelig's club in Chatham Square around 1900. Lewis was also a regular at Barney Flynn's and Mike Salter's establishments as well as the Chatham Club. He was nicknamed Spanish Louie by friends and associates to distinguish him from the many other East Side gangsters who shared that name. He was also called Indian Louie which was attributed to his \\"dark skin, black eyes, thin lips, high cheek-bones and high curved nose\\". This, along with his penchant for wearing a black sombrero and similarly styled clothing, started the rumor that he had come from South America and was \\"of Spanish or Portuguese extraction\\". It was also said that he had served in the military but these rumors \\"failed to name the regiment or the ship\\". Lewis never confirmed or denied the rumors although he occasionally made vague comments mentioning \\"his noble Spanish and Portuguese forefathers, and also let it be known that the hot blood of Indian chieftains flowed in his veins, and that he had inherited all the vices and none of the virtue of the red man\\". Tall tales of his supposed \\"feats\\" were often told in dive bars throughout Chinatown and The Bowery, and the New York Times once described him as \\"big bodied and muscular and could deliver more knockouts with his right than any man his size or double it for that matter\\", but there was always a certain degree of suspicion from his underworld contemporaries. He was never short on money, supposedly having \\"no fewer than three girls walking the streets for him\\", but was rarely known to engage in violent crime and his lack of a police record caused some to wonder if his personality was all an act. Sardinia Frank, a Mulberry Bend thug who killed celebrated bouncer \\"Eat-'em-Up\\" Jack McManus in 1905, said following his death that \\"he was a bluff; he wasn't th' goods. He went around wit' his hat over his eyes, bulldozin' everybody he could, an' lettin' on to be a hero. An' he's got what heroes get.\\" Lewis was sometimes referred to as \\"the best shot on the East Side\\" or \\"the deadest of dead shots\\", and he was often seen wearing a brace of Colt revolvers, although there is no record of his ever having used them. There is only one incident in which Lewis displayed his skill when he led a robbery of Valenski's stuss house on Third Avenue near Fourteenth Street. Lewis single-handedly held the customers at bay while his accomplices looted the safe stealing $380 in all. The money was returned two days later, Lewis claiming the robbery was a practical joke, but many thought Lewis had been forced to give back the money by \\"one high in politics and power\\" and his reputation suffered because of this belief. Murder of Crazy Charlie Soon afterwards, a \\"Bowery Bum\\" known as Crazy Charlie was found dead in the mouth of a passageway off Mulberry Street near the Bowery. Charlie had been brutally murdered, his throat having been slashed, and it was claimed by a police informer known as \\"the Ghost\\" that Lewis was responsible. This was highly doubted in the underworld, Lewis well known for being a mercenary, and would have had no motive to kill a penniless drug addict. Nevertheless, Lewis was picked up by two plainclothes detectives from the Eldridge Police Precinct. Lewis was never told why he was arrested and neither was he officially booked, given their evidence relied mainly on hearsay, investigators wanted to gather more evidence before pressing charges. His revolvers and a seven-inch knife, found inside his waistcoat, were confiscated when he was brought in. The desk sergeant remarked that the gangster's knife could have been the possible murder weapon although it was later found that the knife had not been recently used. The detectives hoped to get a confession out of Lewis and, having yet to inform him as to why he had been arrested, they put him in the back of a paddy wagon and drove him to the city morgue. Once there, they took Lewis inside and showed him the mutilated body of Crazy Charlie hoping to frighten a confession from him. Yet Lewis \\"neither started nor exclaimed\\" and instead took out a cigarette and turned to one of the detectives for a match. When one of the detectives pointed out the body and asked \\"Do you see this?\\", Lewis replied \\"Yes. Also, I'll tell you bulls another thing. You think to rattle me. Say, for ten cents I'd sit on this stiff all night an' smoke a pipe.\\" Seeing their attempt to bluff Lewis had failed, the detectives let him go. In November 1909 a pickpocket named Jacob Lavine was drinking with a woman known to be \\"Spanish Louie's\\"; Louie wounded Lavine; when Lavine refused to appear against Louie, Louie was fined $10.00 {or $25.00} for carrying a concealed weapon December 30, 1909. Death After less than a year in the Lower East Side, Lewis's bullet-riddled body was found in Twelfth Street near Second Avenue. He was found with $170 in his pocket, $700 in his shoe and had about $3,000 deposited in the Bowery Savings Bank. The murder was never solved and it was also revealed at his funeral, held as an orthodox Jewish burial by his father, that Lewis was in actuality from a Sephardic Jewish family in Brooklyn. Although killed in an underworld dispute, there seems to be some confusion as to the date and circumstances of his death. One account claims he was killed in 1900 by The Grabber, a fellow lieutenant of Humpty Jackson, after Lewis withheld his share from the proceeds of a Tammany Hall fundraiser they had co-hosted. According to a second version, Lewis was shot to death in a drive-by shooting by the Lenox Avenue Gang, on the orders of Jack Zelig, on the night of April 1, 1910. Lewis had been hired by Herman Rosenthal in 1909 to beat up one of his rivals, Bridgie Webber. Lewis was later targeted to be killed because of his association with Rosenthal and, after being lured to his East Eleventh Street apartment late one evening, several men in a passing Pierce Arrow called out to him as he stood on the doorstep. The men opened fire and Lewis was killed as he ran towards a side street. In popular culture Lewis has been appeared in several historical novels including Before My Life Began (1985) by Jay Neugeboren, Dreamland (1999) by Kevin Baker and Cityside (2003) by William Heffernan.

Only one was built. Development The Handley Page H.P.47 was the company's submission to Air Ministry specification G.4/31 which called for a single-engined general-purpose aircraft to replace the Vickers Vincent in its Imperial role, to act as a bomber flying from unprepared airstrips and to be a torpedo bomber in the Tropics, particularly Aden. Handley Page were awarded a contract for one prototype; its designer, Gustav Lachmann had monitored German monoplane progress on behalf of Handley Page, so it was not surprising that the H.P.47 used construction methods similar to those of companies like Junkers. He had also become interested in the use of thick wing sections such as RAF34 for which the centre of pressure moved little with angle of attack, making the design of a single-spar monoplane wing easier. The H.P47 was a low-wing cantilever monoplane. Forward of the single spar the wing was covered with a stressed metal skin, forming a torsion box. Behind the spar it was fabric-covered, the trailing edge carrying flaps inboard, from the wing fillet out to the ailerons, though the centre section was metal-skinned throughout. The leading edge carried slats in three sections to form slots across the whole span when extended.Flight p417 The inboard pair were opened when the flaps were lowered and the outer slots were automatic, with interceptors connected to the ailerons for lateral control at high angles of attack. Behind the radial Bristol Pegasus IM3 engine, producing 650 hp (485 kW) and enclosed in a Townend ring, the semi-monocoque, corrugated-skinned fuselage grew in diameter to the pilot's midwing cockpit then remaining constant rearwards to the gunner's position. He sat facing rearwards below the upper fuselage line and out of the slipstream, at a point where the fuselage stepped to a slim and narrowing oval boom. There was usable space inside the fuselage between the cockpits, enough to carry three passengers or two stretcher cases. All the tail surfaces moved; the fin, mounted ahead of the tailplane, moved with the horn-balanced rudder but through smaller angles, changing the camber, and the tailplane and single elevator were similarly coupled. All these rear control surfaces were covered with corrugated stressed skin. Specification G.4/31 included the dropping of torpedoes, so the underside of the aircraft had to be clear and with wing fuel tanks the main undercarriage was fixed. The legs were mounted at the end of the centre section, each with a rearward strut and a long bracing strut outwards to the main spar. These struts were faired and both main and tail wheels were spatted. The main wheels were fitted with brakes. The first flight, without Townend ring, spats or undercarriage fairings, was on 27 November 1934. Several modifications followed, including the abandonment of the forward- sliding front cockpit hood, extension of the rudder and mass-balancing of the elevators. Trials with full military load and with the Pegasus IM3 replaced by a more powerful IIIM3 followed at RAF Martlesham Heath in the G.4/31 trials. The main criticism was of the lack of longitudinal stability and the consequent trimming difficulty. The competition winner was the Vickers Type 246, put into production as the Vickers Wellesley.

History and profile Almanach des Muses was founded in 1765 by Sautreau de Marsy. The magazine was much in vogue during the second half of the 18th century. The aim of the Almanach des Muses was to go beyond what previous almanacs had attempted by presenting to its readership a selection of recent poetry, with critical notes and information about the literary scene. Appearing annually, the Almanach des Muses published a number of lesser-known writers such as Parny, Pierre L√©gier, Bertin, Roucher, Colardeau or Berquin, Legouv√©, Bonnard, Arnault, well-known writers such as Boufflers, Delille, Dorat, de Fontanes, La Harpe, and also the work of extremely eminent figures such as Chamfort, Beaumarchais and Baculard d'Arnaud, above all Voltaire whose writings appeared 200 times between 1765 and 1819. During the French Revolution, it printed \\"La Marseillaise\\" in 1793 and Sade's eulogy to Marat in 1794. To be published in the Almanach des Muses, like Millevoye and Marceline Desbordes-Valmore, was to have \\"arrived\\" on the literary scene. The Almanach des Muses was both much ridiculed and much imitated. Mercier, Rivarol and Champcenetz never hesitated to attack it, dubbing it L'Almanach des Buses (\\"Almanac of Buzzards\\"). On the other hand, German language literary magazine G√∂ttinger Musenalmanach, first published in 1769, was modelled on the magazine. The decline in reputation was slow but steady, and it ceased publication in 1833, superseded by the literary magazine as we know it today. Sautreau de Marsy was the editor until 1793 (with Joseph Mathon de la Cour from 1766 to 1769). √âtienne Vig√©e kept it going from 1794 to 1820, succeeded in turn by Justin Gensoul (1821‚Äì29) and Jean-Pierre Lesguillon (1830-33).

The battle was fought between Australian forces from 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR) and the 17th Tank Brigade of the Korean People's Army (KPA) for control of Chongju, North Korea and the surrounding area. After detecting a strong KPA armoured force equipped with T-34 tanks and SU-76 self- propelled guns on a thickly wooded ridgeline astride the line of advance, the Australians launched a series of company attacks with American M4 Sherman tanks and aircraft in support. Despite heavy resistance the KPA were forced to withdraw and the Australians captured their objectives after three hours of fighting. That evening the KPA were strongly reinforced, attacking the Australian southern flank manned by D Company 3 RAR, and partially penetrating their perimeter. After two hours of fighting the assault was repulsed, and the KPA subsequently launched a furious assault against A Company 3 RAR on the northern position, which also failed amid heavy losses. The following day the Australians advanced to the high ground overlooking Chongju, killing and capturing a number of KPA in skirmishes. That afternoon the town itself was cleared by the remaining elements of the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade without opposition. KPA casualties during the fighting were heavy, while Australian losses included their commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Green, who was wounded in the stomach by artillery fire after the battle and died two days later. Background Military situation The Korean War began early in the morning of 25 June 1950, following the surprise invasion of the Republic of Korea by its northern neighbour, the communist Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).. Numerically superior and better-equipped, the KPA crossed the 38th Parallel and rapidly advanced south, easily overcoming the inferior Republic of Korea Army (ROK). In response, the United Nations (UN) decided to intervene on behalf of South Korea, inviting member states to send forces to restore the situation.. As a consequence, American ground forces were hastily deployed in an attempt to prevent the South Koreans from collapsing, however they too were under strength and poorly equipped, and by early August had been forced back by the KPA to an enclave around Pusan, known as the Pusan Perimeter.. Key US allies‚ÄîBritain, Canada and Australia‚Äîalso committed forces, although these were initially limited to naval contingents and were largely viewed as token efforts in the US. Under diplomatic pressure the British agreed to deploy an infantry brigade in July, and would later dispatch a second brigade as the crisis worsened.. The Canadians also agreed to provide an infantry brigade, although the first battalion would not arrive until December 1950.. A total of 21 UN member states eventually contributed forces.. P-51 Mustang fighters from No. 77 Squadron RAAF at Iwakuni, 1950. Australia was one of the first nations to commit units to the fighting, playing a small but sometimes significant part in the UN forces, which was initially led by General Douglas MacArthur.. Forces deployed in Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force formed the basis of the Australian response, with P-51 Mustang fighter-bombers from No. 77 Squadron RAAF flying their first missions on 2 July, while the frigate and the destroyer were also committed to naval operations. During this time the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR), which had been preparing to return to Australia prior to the outbreak of the war, remained in Japan, however on 26 July the Australian government announced that it would also commit the understrength and poorly equipped infantry battalion to the fighting, following a period of preparation. Training and re-equipment began immediately, while hundreds of reinforcements were hastily recruited in Australia as part of K Force; they soon began arriving to fill out the battalion. The battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Floyd Walsh, was subsequently replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Charles Green. An officer with extensive operational experience fighting the Japanese in New Guinea during the Second World War, Green took over from Walsh due to the latter's perceived inexperience.. On 23 September 1950, 3 RAR embarked for Korea, concentrating at Pusan on 28 September. There it joined the British 27th Infantry Brigade, a garrison formation hurriedly committed from Hong Kong by the British as the situation deteriorated around the Pusan Perimeter in late August to bolster the US Eighth Army under Lieutenant General Walton Walker.. Commanded by Brigadier Basil Coad, the brigade was renamed the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade and consisted of the 1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highland Regiment (1 ASHR), the 1st Battalion, Middlesex Regiment (1 MR) and 3 RAR. Under strength, the two British battalions had each mustered just 600 men of all ranks, while the brigade was also short on transport and heavy equipment, and had no integral artillery support, for which it would rely entirely on the Americans until the 16th Field Regiment, Royal New Zealand Artillery arrived in January 1951. As such, with a strength of nearly 1,000 men, the addition of 3 RAR gave the brigade increased tactical weight as well as expediently allowing the Australians to work within a familiar organisational environment, rather than being attached to a US formation.. Also under the command of the brigade were a number of US Army units, including 155 mm howitzers from the 90th Field Artillery Battalion, M4 Sherman tanks from 89th Tank Battalion and a company from the 72nd Combat Engineer Battalion.. Prelude Opposing forces Map of the UN advance toward the Yalu River, 1950. By the time 3 RAR arrived in the theatre, the KPA had been broken and were in rapid retreat, with MacArthur's forces conducting a successful amphibious assault at Inchon and breakout from the Pusan Perimeter on the southern tip of the Korean peninsula.. A steady advance began, driving the North Koreans northwards towards the 38th Parallel. The 27th British Commonwealth Brigade was airlifted from Taegu to Kimpo Airfield north of Seoul on 5 October, however its vehicles had to move by road, driving , and did not arrive until 9 October. It was subsequently attached to the US 1st Cavalry Division, under the command of Major General Hobart R. Gay. On 16 October the brigade took over from the US 7th Cavalry Regiment as the vanguard of the UN advance into North Korea, its axis intended to take it through Kaesong, Kumchon and Hungsu-ri to Sariwon, then through Hwangju to the North Korean capital of Pyongyang. Although the KPA had suffered heavily in the preceding weeks, they continued to resist strongly, while a lack of accurate maps and the narrowness of the roads made rapid movement difficult for the advancing UN forces. During this time 3 RAR had a platoon of American M4 Sherman tanks attached and a battery of field guns in direct support.. The 27th British Commonwealth Brigade subsequently moved from Kumchon, with the Argylls capturing Sariwon on 17 October, killing 215 KPA and taking many prisoners for the loss of one man killed and three wounded.. The brigade then passed to the command of the US 24th Infantry Division on 21 October, under the overall command of Major General John H. Church, while the US 1st Cavalry Division remained in Pyongyang to complete its capture.. The 27th British Commonwealth Brigade was subsequently ordered to seize Chongju.. Consequently, the brigade continued to advance north with little respite, and on 22 October the Australians fought their first major action at Yongju, killing 150 KPA and capturing 239 of the brigade's 800 prisoners, for the loss of seven men wounded.. Intending to defeat the KPA and bring the war to a close, the UN forces pushed towards the Yalu River, on the Chinese border.. Resistance continued to be met as the brigade crossed the Chongchon River however, and they now moved towards Pakchon. On 24 October, MacArthur had removed all restrictions on the movement of his forces south of the Yalu River and prepared for the final phase of the UN advance, defying a directive of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff and risking Chinese intervention in support of North Korea.. On the afternoon of 25 October a platoon from 3 RAR was fired on by two companies of KPA as they crossed the Taeryong River to conduct a reconnaissance of the west bank, and although they were subsequently forced to withdraw, the Australians took 10 prisoners with them. Acting as the forward elements of the brigade, that evening Green sent two companies across the river to establish defensive positions, and they subsequently broke up a frontal assault on their positions with mortars while the KPA were in the process of forming up. Sixty KPA supported by a T-34 tank then attacked the forward Australian companies at Kujin early the following morning, resulting in Australian losses of eight killed and 22 wounded. However, the KPA suffered heavy casualties including over 100 killed and 350 captured, and the Australians subsequently succeeded in defending the bridgehead after the KPA withdrew. Intelligence indicated that the British and Australians were facing the KPA 17th Tank Brigade, equipped with 20 tanks, which was preparing a last line of defence at Chongju, away. Although the KPA had suffered heavy casualties during the previous fighting on the Taeryong River, Coad was now forced to adopt more cautious tactics, advancing in shorter bounds and clearing high points en route..Among the KPA dead was the commanding officer of the Reconnaissance Unit of the 17th Tank Brigade, Lieutenant Colonel Kim In-sik, who was carrying a number of marked maps and documents. See . On 27 October the Middlesex continued the advance and was involved in a sharp fight in the hills west of the river near the village of Yongsong-ni.. With the war considered all but over the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade continued to pursue the KPA towards Chongju over the next three days, however the advance increasingly encountered strong resistance from KPA infantry dug-in with tanks and self-propelled guns in support, as they approached the Yalu River on the Manchurian border. Battle Fighting around Chongju, 29 October 1950 3 RAR took over as lead battalion of the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade on 29 October, from Chongju. At 10:00 a United States Air Force (USAF) LT-6G Mosquito light spotter aircraft reported a large KPA formation consisting of a battalion-sized force of 500‚Äì600 infantry supported by several tanks and at least two self-propelled guns, positioned on a thickly wooded ridgeline around Chongju.. Astride the line of the advance, these positions were noted as being well constructed, camouflaged and dug-in, with the KPA occupying positions on the forward slopes on both sides of the road. Airstrikes were called in and eight sorties were undertaken by USAF F-80 Shooting Stars which rocketed, strafed and napalmed the KPA positions on the ridgelines. By 14:00 the pilots claimed to have destroyed seven T-34 tanks and two SU-76 self-propelled guns, as well as causing many casualties among the KPA forces. These claims proved optimistic however.. With only a few hours of daylight remaining, Green then planned a battalion attack with two companies forward. Under the command of Major Walter Brown, D Company was subsequently ordered to attack the KPA positions on the left of the road, followed by A Company commanded by Captain William Chitts, which would attack the right.. Meanwhile, preparatory fire from the 155 mm howitzers of the 90th Field Artillery Battalion and 3-inch mortars from Support Company 3 RAR began to fall on the KPA positions.. At 14:30, D Company launched an assault against the ridge south of the road, with two platoons of Sherman tanks in support from D Company, US 89th Tank Battalion. One tank platoon led the attack followed by the other carrying infantry from 10 Platoon D Company. Under the command of Lieutenant David Mannett, 10 Platoon made a right flanking assault along the road, while 11 and 12 Platoons attacked the ridge frontally across the paddy fields.. Meeting stronger resistance than expected however, the attackers came under heavy fire and one of the Sherman tanks was knocked out by an armour-piercing round that hit its turret. However, with the American tanks providing vital close support to the infantry, 10 Platoon successfully secured its objective, allowing it to take the KPA in enfilade and to provide fire support to the assault. Thus, despite strong opposition, the remainder of D Company gained the high ground by 16:30. With the earlier airstrikes having been ineffective, D Company had been opposed by a number of T-34 tanks and SU-76 self-propelled guns, however the bulk of these were destroyed by the Shermans during the assault.. Another tank had been knocked out by well-directed fire at point-blank range from a Bren light machine gun by Private John Stafford, which caused the armoured vehicle's auxiliary fuel tanks to ignite, resulting in its ammunition exploding.. Stafford was subsequently awarded the US Silver Star for his bravery. alt=Two lines of evenly spaced soldiers wearing slouch hats advancing across a ridgeline A Company attacked the ridgeline to the north of the road to Chonju just prior to dusk, this time without the support of the Sherman tanks. The Australians again came under heavy fire from the KPA, however they quickly overcame the defenders and the ridge was secured by 17:30. During the fighting for the northern position, three KPA T-34 tanks dug-in on the ridgeline had been destroyed by the Australians at short range with M20 3.5-inch bazookas, which now proved to be effective anti-armour weapons despite difficulties experienced in their use at Kujin several days before. During the day's fighting, a total of 11 T-34 tanks and two SU-76 self- propelled guns had been destroyed by the Australian infantry and American tanks, contrary to the reports of their destruction by USAF airstrikes earlier in the day. Expecting a counter-attack, Green then ordered B Company forward to occupy positions along the road in between the positions held by D and A Companies, while Battalion headquarters moved in behind B Company, with C Company held in reserve at the rear with Support Company. After conducting a limited resupply of the forward companies, the Australians hastily began to dig in.. The KPA subsequently brought up substantial reinforcements, and soon after dark they moved against D Company on the southern flank. Preparatory fire by artillery, mortars and machine-guns began at 19:00, following which a battalion-sized ground assault was launched.. The weight of the counter-attack fell on 10 Platoon D Company, with Mannett holding his platoon's fire until the KPA were only away before engaging, killing 32 men. Mannett was later awarded the Military Cross for his leadership during the initial assault and the subsequent defence of the ridgeline. Regardless, the KPA succeeded in overrunning parts of the Australian position before they were finally repulsed following counter-attacks by 11 and 12 Platoons during two hours of fierce fighting. A number of KPA also succeeded in penetrating the perimeter, and they moved behind D Company from where they fired on the 3 RAR headquarters. Contact was subsequently lost with D Company and was not regained until the KPA were forced to withdraw by Headquarters Company, under Captain Ben O'Dowd, which then cleared the depth positions. At 21:30 the focus of the KPA counter- attack shifted to the northern flank, launching a heavy assault against A Company. This effort also failed however, being repulsed as Chitts called-in indirect fire from the Support Company mortars and American howitzers to within of the forward Australian positions. The KPA finally withdrew at 22:15, though a SU-76 self-propelled gun continued to fire sporadically into the Australian positions until 23:00. Clearance of the town, 30 October 1950 The following morning the Australians remained in position, and at daybreak they found more than 150 KPA dead within the 3 RAR defensive position. Coad subsequently brought the Middlesex forward to secure his northern flank, while 3 RAR moved forward to the Talchon River, taking up positions in the hills overlooking Chongju by 11:00. During the advance the Australians had clashed with a number of KPA stragglers, killing 12 and capturing 10 in skirmishes. It became clear that organised resistance had ceased however, with the successful Australian assault and the subsequent defence of its objectives the day before breaking the KPA locally.. In the north the Middlesex pushed forward to the riverbank, while in the afternoon the Argylls forded the river with two platoons of Shermans. Meanwhile, aerial reconnaissance reported the presence of KPA tanks to the west of Chongju. Regardless, that afternoon the Argylls encountered no further opposition as they entered and cleared the ruined and burning town, securing it by 17:00.. The brigade then moved into divisional reserve for the US 24th Infantry Division, with Church ordering the US 21st Infantry Regiment to take its place in the lead in order to give the British and Australian infantry a much needed respite.. The tanks and infantry of the 21st Infantry Regiment subsequently moved through the brigade. The 27th British Commonwealth Brigade adopted tight security that evening due to the threat of KPA infiltration.. For added protection while in reserve the 3 RAR headquarters had been sited on the reverse slope of a hill overlooking the Talchon River, with the rifle companies occupying the forward slope of the ridgeline to the west and a spur line which thrust towards the river bank.. Around dusk at 18:10 on 30 October, six high-velocity shells, likely from a KPA self-propelled gun or tank, hit the area. Five of the shells landed on the forward slope, while the sixth cleared the crest and detonated to the rear of the C Company position after hitting a tree. In his tent on a stretcher after 36 hours without sleep, Green was severely wounded in the stomach by a fragment from the wayward round. He was evacuated to a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) at Anju, however he succumbed to his wounds and died two days later on 1 November. Forty other men who had been in the vicinity when the shell landed were unhurt. A popular and respected commanding officer, Green's loss was keenly felt by the Australians. Meanwhile, Coad received congratulations from Gay for the brigade's victory at Chongju after marching in twelve hours.. Aftermath Casualties Chinese forces cross the Yalu River. The fighting around Chongju was the heaviest undertaken by the Australians since entering the war. KPA casualties included 162 killed and 10 captured, while Australian losses were nine killed and 30 wounded, including Green.Green, who was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and American Silver Star, was eventually buried at the United Nations Memorial Cemetery in Pusan, along with 281 other Australian casualties. See . The Royal Australian Regiment was subsequently granted the battle honour \\"Chongju\\".. Following the capture of the town the US 21st Infantry Regiment had set off rapidly along the road to Sonchon to the west. Encountering only one strong KPA position which they quickly turned, by noon on 1 November the lead battalion had reached Chonggodong, just from the Yalu River where the Americans clashed with another KPA armoured force. To the north meanwhile, the US 5th and 9th Infantry Regiments of the 24th Division secured Taechon and Kusong, before advancing to within of the Manchurian border.. Subsequent operations During the last weeks of October the Chinese had moved 18 divisions of the People's Volunteer Army across the Yalu River under the overall command of Marshal Peng Dehuai in order to reinforce the remnants of the KPA. Undetected by US and South Korean intelligence, the 13th Army Group crossed the border on 16 October and penetrated up to into North Korea, and were reinforced in early November by 12 divisions from the 9th Army Group; in total 30 divisions composed of 380,000 men... The Chinese subsequently ambushed MacArthur's forces which were now widely dispersed, decimating ROK II Corps at Onjong and encircling and overrunning the US 8th Cavalry Regiment at Unsan.. Ultimately Chongju was the furthest north that 27th British Commonwealth Brigade was to penetrate. Walsh, by then an observer at US Eighth Army headquarters, was urgently posted to resume command of 3 RAR following Green's death, however he was relieved of his position by Coad just six days later in the wake of the Battle of Pakchon on 5 November that cost the battalion heavily, losing 12 killed and 64 wounded despite killing 200 PVA. The battalion second-in-command, Major Bruce Ferguson, subsequently assumed command.. Suffering significant casualties, the PVA offensive was halted the next day due to logistics difficulties..

Hilda and her husband Rusty Bernstein were both detained, along with many others, in the aftermath of the Sharpeville massacre of 1960. Upon their release, Rusty was placed under house arrest, while Hilda's day-to-day activities were closely monitored by the Special Branch, if not altogether prohibited. Her memoir recalls these fraught years in the build-up to the landmark Rivonia Trial, the events and ordeals of the Trial itself, and finally the couple's reluctant decision to flee their beloved country in the wake of Rusty's acquittal. While on the one hand The World that was Ours offers vivid historical insight into the tumultuous climate of Johannesburg in the early 1960s, on the other it reads as a poignant and emotional recollection of the narrator's personal dilemmas, as a mother, a wife and a political activist, torn between her private and public responsibilities. 'This has survived as a South African classic,' wrote Anthony Sampson in the Spectator, 'not just because it's beautifully written, but because it conveys the combination of ordinariness and danger which is implicit in any totalitarian state.' The World that was Ours is dedicated to 'the men of Rivonia' - Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Ahmed Kathrada, Denis Goldberg, Govan Mbeki, Elias Motsoaledi, Andrew Mlangeni and Rusty Bernstein - as well as to their devoted counsel, Bram Fischer.

Early life Hedgepeth was born near Prairie Home, Missouri, in October 1864, although his date of birth has erroneously been given as April 14, 1856. He allegedly ran away from home at age 15, worked as a cowboy, and was an outlaw by the time he was 20, having killed in Colorado and Wyoming, as well as having robbed trains. This, however, is incorrect. Barker, Dean A. (2020). Marion Hedgepeth: Missouri's Forgotten Outlaw. . Appearance and reputation In a 1996 American Cowboy article titled \\"The Debonair Killer\\", David P. Grady noted: \\"Marion Hedgepeth looked like a dude, but 'dangerous' and 'deadly' fit him better\\". The dark- complexioned, wavy-haired six footer, who roamed from town to town as a hired gun, Grady wrote, maintained the fastidious, gentlemanly appearance of a dandy, sporting a bowler hat and diamond stickpin. WANTED posters noted that his shoes were usually polished. An article published in the Express Gazette, Volume 20 by \\"a man from Missouri\\", who described himself as \\"a disinterested student of train robbing\\", indicated that appearances were strategically important to Marion and his crew. In preparation for the Glendale robbery, he noted, Hedgepeth, \\"his three pals\\" and his wife \\"assembled in that city and rented a house in a fashionable quarter of the town. They furnished the house well, and during the two or three weeks prior to the holdup, each robber purchased for himself swell attire piece by piece, so as not to attract attention.\\" Despite his swell appearance, however, Hedgepeth \\"was a deadly killer and one of the fastest guns in the Wild, Wild West\\". Allan Pinkerton, whose National Detective Agency had sought to capture Hedgepeth and his gang for years, noted that Marion Hedgepeth once gunned down another outlaw who had already unholstered his pistol before Hedgepeth had drawn his revolver. Criminal career and consequences Hedgepeth was arrested at the age of 15 after he and Henry Sanders robbed the general store in Prairie Home in 1880. Barker, Dean A. (2020).

He became a member of the \\"famous Slye-Wilson gang of safe blowers and highwaymen\\".\\"Hedgepeth Died a Robber.

After being relentlessly pursued by the Pinkertons, he was finally arrested on February 10, 1892, in San Francisco and brought back to Missouri for trial. Convicted, he was sentenced in 1893 to 25 years in the Missouri State Penitentiary. Before being sent to the state prison, Hedgepeth informed on a former cell-mate, whom he knew as \\"H.M. Howard\\" but was really Herman Webster Mudgett, better known as H. H. Holmes, which eventually resulted in the notorious killer's unmasking, conviction and execution in 1896. For this and other considerations, Hedgepeth was pardoned by Missouri state governor Joseph W. Folk 14 years into his 25-year term. He was released sick with tuberculosis and \\"looked like a skeleton and appeared 60 years old.\\" He was arrested in 1907 in Omaha, for the burglary of a storage house at Council Bluffs, Iowa.

Overview  Beinn Bhreac is a remote mountain located at the southern end of a featureless, boggy moorland plateau called the Moine Bhealaidh (Yellow Moss in Gaelic). The eastern peak is higher than the western peak. It is commonly approached from the Linn of Dee to the south and is often combined with the neighbouring Munro Beinn a' Chaorainn. From its summit there are extensive views to the surrounding giants of the Cairngorm Mountains including Ben MacDui, Great Britain's second highest mountain.  Geography  At Beinn Bhreac is a Munro and is ranked as the 249th highest mountain in Scotland. The mountain has two peaks, the eastern one of which is higher than the western peak and therefore the summit. The mountain is bounded by Dubh Ghleann to the East and Glen Derry to the West. Both of these sides are steep and rocky in places. Moderately inclined slopes on its south-western side lead down towards Derry Lodge. The boggy moorland plateau called the Moine Bhealaidh extends to the north-west from Beinn Bhreac and links it with the neighbouring peak of Beinn a' Chaorainn. The view from the summit gives a fine panorama and takes in all the Cairngorm giants including Ben MacDui to the west and Beinn a' Bhuird to the east.  Ascent  A popular route of ascent for Beinn Bhreac is from the Linn of Dee National Trust for Scotland car park (), west of Braemar. The route follows the estate road along Glen Lui for to Derry Lodge: bicycles can be used on this stretch of the route and secured in the woodland around Derry Lodge for collection on the return journey. The route then goes north up Glen Derry for before ascending the south-western flanks of Beinn Bhreac. From the bealach between Meall an Lundain and Beinn Bhreac it is a steep climb to the summit. An approach from the Aviemore side of the Cairngorms is feasible, starting at the Cairn Gorm ski centre, but this involves crossing or bypassing Cairn Gorm, Loch Avon, Beinn Mheadhoin and Beinn a' Chaorainn before reaching the mountain and is a long, hard walk. Beinn Bhreac is a remote mountain and is therefore often climbed in combination with its neighbouring Munro Beinn a' Chaorainn which is located approximately to the north across the Moine Bhealaidh plateau.Beinn Bhreac - Walking Scotland References *The Munros, Donald Bennet (Editor) Category:Munros Category:Mountains and hills of the Cairngorms ","title":"Beinn Bhreac (Glen Derry)"},{"id":"24029100","text":"Donald Auberon Bullough (13 June 1928 ‚Äì 26 June 2002) was a British historian who taught and published on the cultural and political history of Italy, England and Carolingian France during the early Middle Ages.

They rapped in Ga, Twi, and Pidgin, and were the first hiplife group in Ghana to be successful with Ga lyrics. As of 2006, they were both pursuing individual projects. Bright and Ronny reunited in 2012 to record what turned out to be their final album as a group, Fisherman Anthem. The original group had more members, some of whom have formed groups like 4x4. The group split in November 2013, after the death of Ronny Coaches. History Buk Bak, coined from ‚Äúbook back,‚Äù was first formed to see how far Prince Bright (also known as Bling Sparkles), Ronnie Coaches, and Isaac Shoetan (known as Papa Shoto) could go considering their love for music as a window to vent their feelings and means to entertain their ever-increasing fan base. It didn't come as a surprise when they were headlining shows from Ghana, the USA, and UK, to many other places. They began freestyling and gained that street credibility every artist needed back then to survive the Ghanaian hiplife industry. In an inter-school rap contest, Ronnie Coaches who was pursuing auto mechanics at Accra Technical Training College (ATTC) came in second with his group and Shoetan and Bling Sparkles came in third. Ronnie had already built a huge fan base in ATTC but Isaac Shoetan and Bling Sparkles spoke to Ronnie about joining Buk Bak and his acceptance made the group begin talking about putting out an album. Isaac Shoetan, known as Papa Shoto, was an Adisadel College student. They signed on to Abib Records, which the group described in an interview as a ‚Äúgood contract and good money‚Äù. The group then recorded their first studio album ‚ÄúKomi K·ºê Kena‚Äù, and then followed it up with ‚ÄúAw·ºêns·ºêm‚Äù before topping it with ‚ÄúNkomhy·ºê‚Äù with Abib Records. After a few years, Isaac Shoetan left the group to pursue his own projects, leaving Coaches and Bright to record ‚Äú1662‚Äù, ‚ÄúSikaKorkor‚Äù, and then ‚ÄúGold Coast‚Äù with Agicoat Records before Coaches and Bright also split themselves to pursue their solo projects in 2006. Bling Sparkles recorded ‚ÄúLight over Darkness‚Äù which had the hit single ‚ÄúCondom,‚Äù with Prince Dave Records. He then moved to the United States to pursue other equally important projects. Coaches recorded ‚ÄúScreen Saver,‚Äù an equally successful album before the two announced their comeback in 2012 to release the club banger ‚ÄúKolom‚Äù. The duo's songs were inspired by experiences they dealt with growing up. Both grew up in a compound house where a lot of things occurred, and they used those memories and put them into their songs. Buk Bak was popular for their party songs that fans loved dancing to. They mentored 4X4, Castro, Pope Skinny, K-2, Buky Core, and many other artists. Buk Bak's belief in mentoring other artists was because ‚Äúwhen you are at the top alone it will get to a time you will feel lonely so we should help several other people come up there so we can all enjoy life‚Äù. On November 21, 2013, Coaches was pronounced dead at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra, Ghana, after having suffered a heart attack.

ICROA‚Äôs membership consists of those established carbon reduction and offset providers based in the United States, European and Asia- Pacific markets which commit to the ICROA Code of Best Practice. ICROA was established in 2008 to provide self-regulation of the voluntary carbon market. Members produce an annual report demonstrating compliance with the ICROA Code. The ICROA Code promotes a combined ‚Äòreduce and offset‚Äô approach to carbon management and has specific requirements for how members provide their carbon footprinting, Greenhouse Gas (GHG) reduction advice and offsetting services. ICROA aims that member‚Äôs compliance with their Code will bring credibility to the voluntary carbon market.  History  ICROA was launched by eight carbon reduction and offset providers on June 9, 2008. Along with the initial eight, ICROA has been open to new members which meet its membership criteria, and this was reflected in their early announcement that they intended to increase fourfold over the following twelve months. Nevertheless, the co-chairman of the organization, Jonathan Shopley, stated in 2008 that most offset providers would not be qualified to join. With ICROA headquartered in the United Kingdom, the eight founding members consisted of five British firms (Carbon Clear, The Carbon Neutral Company, ClimateCare, CO2balance and Targetneutral), two from the United States (Native Energy and TerraPass), and one from Australia (Climate Friendly). Current membership is eleven companies worldwide.  The ICROA Code of Best Practice  The ICROA Code is available in full on the ICROA website. The key points are: # Members will help their customers to measure their carbon footprint according to accepted international standards, and will set their emissions reduction targets based on scientific assessments. # The ICROA Code explicitly recognizes that offsetting alone is not a sound approach to carbon management, therefore members should support a ‚Äòreduce and offset‚Äô approach to carbon management. # Offsetting projects must meet the following criteria: real, permanent, independently verified, unique and additional. So far ICROA accepts the following standards: Clean Development Mechanism/Joint Implementation, Climate Action Reserve, Gold Standard, Voluntary Carbon Standard. ICROA may also use offsets from approved Government schemes. This is on the proviso that the Government scheme certified offsets will only be used within the context of the Government scheme and will not be sold as voluntary offsets outside the context of the scheme, unless these methodologies have been separately approved by ICROA. Schemes that have approved for use so far by ICROA members are: US EPA Climate Leaders. # ICROA members must follow the ICROA Code, and produce an annual report demonstrating their compliance.  Criticism  In February 2009, ICROA criticised the UK Government quality assurance scheme for carbon offsets as it did not include voluntary emissions cuts (VERS). In a statement a spokesman said, \\"Unfortunately, it still fails to recognise VERs and we feel very strongly there's no reason for this.\\" In turn ICROA was criticised by Dr Bruce Elliott, managing director of carbon offset company Clear which had achieved accreditation under the government scheme. Elliot stated that, \\"The trade body which represents offset organisations who sell VERs, ICROA, have unsurprisingly been vociferous in their criticism of the scheme. Many of its members have substantial investments in VER projects which now face an uncertain future without the government‚Äôs backing. This financial conflict of interest is readily apparent in their persistent public criticism of a scheme which matches or sets higher standards than its own code of conduct for the majority of criteria.\\" See also *Carbon emission trading *Contraction and Convergence *Carbon Offset In June 2011, The UK Government's Quality Assurance Scheme (QAS) for Carbon Offsetting, closed down.

It is the second novel featuring protagonist Paul Brenner. Plot One of the last things that Chief Warrant Officer Paul Brenner wanted to do was return to work for the Army's Criminal Investigation Division-an organization that thanked him for his many years of dedicated service by forcing him into early retirement. But when his former boss calls in a career's worth of favors, Paul finds himself having to do the last thing he ever wanted-return to Vietnam. His mission: Investigate a murder that took place during the war, thirty years before. But almost as soon as he returns to Vietnam, a country that still haunts him, he discovers that there is much more to this investigation than a forgotten murder. Brenner, former combat veteran, again finds himself in a battle for survival as he enters a world of corruption and double-crosses, where, for the second time in his life, he cannot distinguish friend from foe, and where his only allies are his wits and his bravery-and possibly a beautiful American expatriate named Susan Weber. She, like the country in which she has chosen to live, is exotic, sensual, and quite possibly dangerous.

He was part of the Down team that won the All- Ireland Senior Football Championship in 1991 and 1994. Blaney won three Ulster Senior Football Championships and a National League title with Down and won three All Star awards during his career. He also had a distinguished underage career with the county - winning Ulster Minor, Ulster Under 21 and All-Ireland Under 21 Football Championship medals. In football, he usually played at centre half forward. He was a brilliant reader of the game. He was renowned for his vision, ball-winning and play-making abilities. His excellent passing skills set up countless chances for teammates. His understanding with Down corner forward Mickey Linden has been described as \\"near telepathic\\". It has been said that he made the Down \\"attack tick with his shrewd play and inventiveness\\". Blaney was also able to score himself. Blaney is a legend in Down GAA circles, and is known as one of the county's best ever footballers. In 2009 to mark the 125th anniversary of the Gaelic Athletic Association he was named by The Irish News as one of the all-time best 125 footballers from Ulster. As a hurler with Down, Blaney won Ulster Minor and Ulster Senior Hurling Championship medals. Background Blaney is from Kircubbin in the Ards Peninsula, County Down, where hurling is the undoubtedly the game of choice. He however is a member of the famous McCartan family, a renowned Gaelic football family in county Down. Keeping with his family traditions, Blaney was sent to school at St. Colman's College in Newry, a famed gaelic football institution known Ireland wide. This was the beginning of his footballing career, one which he later enhanced whilst attending Queens University Belfast. His father Se√°n captained Armagh to Ulster Minor and All- Ireland Minor Football Championship glory in 1949. He has six brothers and one sister. James McCartan Snr is his uncle, making James McCartan Jr is his first cousin. Between the 3 of them the hold numerous Gaa All Stars. He is married with six children and currently lives in Belfast. Football career Club Blaney's club is Ballycran. He played club football for a period with Carryduff as Ballycran had no football team. He won many underage honours with Ballycran including a Feile na nGael Hurling and played in the National Feile in Limerick. He won numerous Down Senior Hurling Championships alongside his brothers and childhood friends. Ballycran started a football team winning Down ACFL Division 4 and progressing into Division 3. It was as a Ballycran footballer that he won the All-Ireland in 1991 with Down. While with Carryduff, his first year playing for the club's Senior team was 1978 at the age of only 15. He helped the club win the Down Junior Football Championship in 1986. Inter-county Blaney played for the Down Minor team for three years and won the Ulster Minor Football Championship with them in 1977 & 1979. In 1979 at the age of just 16, he was part of the Down Under 21 team that won the Ulster Under 21 and All-Ireland Under 21 Football Championships. Blaney joined the Down Senior panel in 1981. That year, while only 18 years old, he won his first Ulster Senior Football Championship medal with the county. Two years later he helped Down win the National Football League. He also received an All Star award for his performances that year. Blaney and Down reached the 1986 Ulster final, but were beaten by Tyrone. In 1991 Down again won the Ulster Championship, beating Donegal in the decider. Down defeated Kerry in the All-Ireland semi-final, before beating Meath in the All-Ireland final. The success was Down's first All-Ireland Senior Football Championship title since 1968. Blaney also won a second All-Star that year. Blaney won a third Ulster Championship medal with Down in 1994. Victories over Cork in the All-Ireland semi-final and Dublin in the final gave Blaney another All-Ireland Senior medal. Once again he was honoured for hs performances that year with an All- Star. Blaney lined out in another Ulster final two years later, but Down lost to Tyrone. He retired from inter-county football in 1997. Blaney is one of a couple of players that have won Ulster Senior Hurling and Football School/college While at St. Colman's Blaney was part of probably the best college team Ulster has certainly seen and with respect to Ireland we will never know. Between Blaney's 1st year in 1974 and last in 1981, the team went undefeated through league and knockout stages in the various age category competitions. Winning Dalton Cup(74/75)(Blaney captain), Corn na nOg(76/77), Rannefast(78/79) and MacRory Cup(1981). Unfortunately, this team never had the chance to test their mettle on the Irish stage. In this era the only All- Ireland football competition was the final school year but the disparity between school leaving age in Ulster and the other three provinces meant a misalignment of the competition ages. So in 1981, having qualified for the then only All-Ireland college competition, the Hogan Cup, but with the age disparity between Ulster's MacRory(U18 1/2) and the other 3 provinces, Blaney and half a dozen colleagues from this undefeated team were deemed ineligible for the Hogan Cup (U18). Blaney's honours while at St. Colman's included helping the school win three MacRory Cups (1978, 1979 and 1981). In 1978 they went on to reach the Hogan Cup final, but they were beaten by St. Jarlath's College, Tuam. In 1949, St. Colman's were captained by Greg's father Sean Blaney, who also captained them to success in 1950 - a feat only equalled by Dermot McNicholl (1983 and 1984). In 1981 final, the captain of the winning St. Colman's team was none other than Greg Blaney, son of Sean. Sean and Greg are the only father/son combination to captain winning MacRory Cup teams. As a fresher, Blaney was top-scorer when Queens University Belfast won the Sigerson Cup in 1982. He also won the Ryan Cup on two occasions with QUB (1984 and 1985). In 1999, he was named a \\"Sporting Great\\" of the university. He is also a patron of QUB's GAA academy. Province Blaney played for Ulster on many occasions. He won the Railway Cup five times with the province (between 1983 and 1995). International Blaney played Compromise rules football for Ireland against Australia in 1984, 1986, 1987 and 1990. Hurling career Club Blaney's club is Ballycran, and he played club football for a period with Carryduff as Ballycran had no football team. He won many underage honours with Ballycran including a Feile na nGael Hurling and played in the National Feile in Limerick. He won numerous Down Senior Hurling Championships alongside his brothers and childhood friends. Ballycran started a football team winning Down ACFL Division 4 and progressing into Division 3. It was as a Ballycran footballer that he won the All-Ireland in 1991 with Down. Blaney played in Antrim Senior Hurling League Division 1 with Ballycran in an era where no quarter was given or asked against teams such as Cushendall, Loughgiel, Ballycastle and fierce local rivals Ballygalget and Portaferry. Inter-county Blaney represented Down hurlers at Minor, Under 21 and Senior level. In 1978 he won an Ulster Minor Hurling Championship medal with the county. He was part of the Down side that won the 1992 Ulster Senior Hurling Championship \\\\- the county's first since 1941. After retiring Blaney served as a selector with the Down Senior football team when former teammate Paddy O'Rourke was manager. He was appointed to the role in July 2002. In 2003 Down reached the Ulster final, where they faced Tyrone. Blaney is a fitness fanatic, a keen handballer and has been competing in triathlons for the past number of years. On 9 January 2012, Blaney was appointed a manager of his local club where he resides, St Brigids GAC.

The screenplay was written by Saville with Miles Malleson and Frank Launder, based on the novel of the same name by Graham Seton. When the film was released in the United States, Aherne was appearing in The Barretts of Wimpole Street on Broadway, and receiving praise for his performance as Robert Browning. The film was a critical success, but did not do well at the box office. Plot Colonel Duncan Grant (Brian Aherne) is a British officer during World War I. When the British high command get wind of a German plan, titled The W Plan, from the lips of a dying German officer, Major Ulrich Muller (George Merritt), they send Grant behind enemy lines to learn the details. After successfully being dropped by airplane near the German town of Essen, where he makes his way to home of the dead German who was responsible for the plan. Grant is chosen because he speaks fluent German, having spent a significant amount of time in Germany prior to outbreak of hostilities. While in Essen, he runs into an old girlfriend, Rose Hartmann (Madeleine Carroll). When he and Rose go to a nearby caf√©, he is approached by German officers and asked for his papers. While he has the documents taken from Muller, the Germans become suspicious, and Grant has to make a quick getaway. Unfortunately, the plane he is supposed to meet with to make his escape is shot down, after which Grant is arrested for desertion. When he is about to be shot, he is instead sent to the very project he had been sent to Germany to learn about, The W Plan. It consists of a very elaborate series of underground works which are being dug beneath the British controlled territory, in order to collapse their lines. Grant succeeds in destroying a vital portion of the German underpinnings, and makes his escape back to British territory. The film ends with the allusion that he will meet up with Rose in Switzerland in the coming days. Cast * Brian Aherne as Colonel Duncan Grant * George Merritt as Major Ulrich Muller * C.M.

Cognates of this word are found in several extant Romance Languages and languages influenced by Romance languages and are often associated with university professors or teachers in general. For example, in Spanish language, the word \\"docente\\" (from the same Latin root) means \\"teacher\\". In many cases docents, in addition to their prescribed function as guides, also conduct research utilizing the institution's facilities. The title \\"docent\\" is not widely used outside the United States in English languages, with the terms \\"guide\\", \\"facilitator\\", or \\"educator\\" preferred. United States Museum docent is a title used in the United States for educators trained to further the public's understanding of the cultural and historical collections of the institution, including local and national museums, planetariums, zoos, historical landmarks, and parks.

Les Fauves: a sourcebook, by Russell T. Clement, p. 2, web: [https://books.google.com/books?id=VcaMyvjUZhIC&pg;=PA2&lpg;=PA2 Books-Google- hIC].

Grove Art Online Life and work Louis Valtat was born on 8 August 1869 in Dieppe, in the Normandy region of France, into a wealthy family of ship owners. Valtat spent many of his childhood years in Versailles, a suburb of Paris, where he attended secondary school at the Lyc√©e Hoche (near the Palace of Versailles). Encouraged by his father, an amateur landscape painter himself, Valtat became interested in art. At age 17, deciding to pursue an artistic career, he applied to the √âcole des Beaux-Arts de Paris. He was accepted, and in 1887 Valtat moved to Paris to enroll at the Ecole, where he studied with the well-known academic artists Gustave Boulanger (1824‚Äì1888), Jules Lefebvre (1836‚Äì1911), and later with Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant (1845‚Äì1902).

Among his fellow students were Albert Andr√© (1869‚Äì1954), who became a close friend, as well as Maurice Denis (1870‚Äì1943), Pierre Bonnard (1867‚Äì1947), and √âdouard Vuillard (1868‚Äì1940). These last three, calling themselves \\"Nabis\\" (after the Hebrew word meaning prophets), were influenced by Paul Gauguin's (1848‚Äì1903) Synthetist method of painting based on the use of simple forms, pure colors, and large patterns. While Valtat remained detached from that movement, he learned from them. In 1890, upon winning the Jauvin d‚ÄôAttainville prize, Valtat established his own studio at rue La Glaciere in Paris. He made his debut in 1893 at the Salon of Independent Artists, displaying several paintings depicting street scenes of the neighborhood surrounding his art studio. One of those paintings, titled Sur Le Boulevard (On The Boulevard, 1893) was noted by the art critic F√©lix F√©n√©on. During this early period in his career, Valtat used the spontaneous light touches of Impressionism (although with bordered objects) and the colorful dots found in Pointillism. Two examples representing Valtat's work during this period include P√©niches (Barges, 1892) and the Pommiers (The Apple Trees, 1894). As noted by Cogniat, P√©niches has the impressionistic rendering of the mobile reflections of rippling water while Pommiers is \\"alive with the dazzling brilliance of sunlit reds and yellows intensified by the stippled strokes of green\\". Valtat exhibited widely during his career. In 1894, he collaborated with both Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Albert Andr√© in creating the decor for the Paris theater \\"L'≈íuvre\\" at the request of Lugn√© Po√´. Valtat suffered from tuberculosis, and he spent many autumn/winter seasons along the Mediterranean coast in Banyuls, Antheor and Saint-Tropez. Beginning in 1900, Valtat made several journeys by bicycle to visit Auguste Renoir at the Maison de la Poste in Cagnes. There, Valtat made several portrait drawings of Renoir on which he based a subsequent woodcut, and the two artists collaborated on a sculpture of C√©zanne.Ferrillo, Lynn Boyer. \\"Valtat, Louis.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press, retrieved 30 November 2012. Another friend of Valtat was Paul Signac, whom he visited often, traveling in a small Boll√©e motorcar that he acquired ca. 1904 from Signac in exchange for his painting Women at the Seashore.Signac, P., Bocquillon-Ferretti, M., Grand Palais (Paris, France), Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam., & Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.). (2001). Signac, 1863-1935. New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art. pp. 62‚Äì63. . During his time spent near the Mediterranean, Valtat intensified his use of color and began to express his Fauvist tendencies, particularly in painting seascapes. Art historian Natalie Henderson Lee identifies Valtat as a \\"proto-Fauve\\",Brettell, R. R., Tucker, P. H., Lee, N. H., & Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.). (2009).

After 1914 he worked in Paris and in areas near Rouen and Versailles. The subjects of his paintings included flowers, landscapes, and scenes of contemporary life, and he produced many prints. Valtat continued to paint until 1948, when the glaucoma from which he had suffered for several years resulted in the loss of his sight. He died on 2 January 1952 in Paris.

Early years Corr√© was born in Clapham, south London, the son of British fashion designer Dame Vivienne Westwood and fashion and music business maverick, as one time manager of Sex Pistols, Malcolm McLaren. Corr√©'s surname, which was not adopted but given at birth, derives from his father's maternal grandmother, a Sephardic Jew from Portugal. As a child, he wore his mother's designs and regards the Sex Pistols as his favourite band, despite a poor relationship with frontman/singer John Lydon. Agent Provocateur Agent Provocateur was established in 1994 after Serena Rees, Corr√©'s wife and co- founder, grew tired of seeing drab undergarments. The couple opened a shop in which they originally sold other designers' pieces. Corr√© had no desire to design lingerie but, after not finding enough of the type they wished to sell, decided to create their own lingerie line. Since then, the company has expanded to 30 shops in 14 countries. Rees left Corr√© for ex-Clash bassist Paul Simonon in 2007, and in the same year the to-be divorced couple agreed to sell Agent Provocateur to private equity house 3i for ¬£60m. Rejection of MBE  In June 2007, Corr√© was awarded the MBE for his services to the fashion industry in the Queen's Birthday Honours list. He rejected the award in protest at Prime Minister Tony Blair's actions in Iraq and Afghanistan which Corr√© said had caused suffering and at the erosion in civil rights in the UK during Blair's term. A Child of the Jago In 2008 Corr√© founded the opening of the independent boutique \\"A Child of the Jago\\", named after the 19th century novel by Arthur Morrison. The venture was a partnership with British street-wear fashion entrepreneur Simon \\"Barnzley\\" Armitage, modelled on the retail outlets run by Corr√©'s parents in the 1970s/80s. Armitage left the business in 2013 and is no longer referenced in the company's history. Illamasqua In 2010 Corr√© was recruited to \\"edgy\\" British cosmetics company Illamasqua as brand director by founder Julian Kynaston. The company has an expanding chain of outlets in the UK and an international presence. Relationship with father On McLaren's death in a Swiss medical centre from a rare form of cancer in April 2010, Corr√© said: \\"It was hard for me because he never wanted to do the emotional stuff that comes with being a parent. He ran away from it and I found that hard to take. We had a difficult relationship, but it was all right in the end. I went to Switzerland and we said what we had to say and we made our peace. I'm really glad I did that. It was such a release for both of us\\". Corr√© organised his father's funeral, at which McLaren was buried in a coffin sprayed with the slogan \\"Too Fast To Live Too Young To Die\\" (the title of one of his shops). The ceremony was attended by celebrities including Bob Geldof and Tracey Emin, and accompanied by a public procession to punk songs, including the Sid Vicious version of \\"My Way\\".Thisislondon.co.uk In 2012 probate was granted to Young Kim, McLaren's girlfriend during the last 16 years of his life, by McLaren's will, which Corr√© had contested because he was excluded from it. Ownership of father's domain name Corr√© is registered as the administrative officer of malcolmmclaren.com. In 2012 he bought the domain name from Paul August Nordstrom of Singapore for $750; August had worked for McLaren and in 1997 registered the domain to himself without McLaren's knowledge. August, who said in 2013 he could \\"no longer recall specifically why he placed his own name as registrant \\", had previously refused to pass the domain to the Malcolm McLaren Estate. Politics Prior to the 2015 general election, he was one of several celebrities who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the Green Party's Caroline Lucas. 2016 protest In November 2016 in a staged protest to encourage use of renewable energy, Corr√© and Vivienne Westwood burned an estimated ¬£6,000,000 worth of his punk rock memorabilia archive on a barge on the River Thames. When asked about the incident by The Sunday Telegraph, \\"Did this feel like burning a Picasso?\\", Corr√© replied \\"I don‚Äôt know what burning a Picasso feels like,\\" adding, \\"but I thought that was great. Punk rock is not important. Punk has become another marketing tool to sell you something you don‚Äôt need\\". Musician Henry Rollins wrote in response to the incident, \\"Corr√© and Westwood might think they have taught everyone a lesson in what punk‚Äôs all about, but all they did was show off their massive egos and how much they‚Äôve lost the plot. Maybe it was something else, too. Perhaps it was an emotional response to the fact that McLaren cut Corr√© out of his will. It doesn‚Äôt matter now. It‚Äôs yesterday‚Äôs garbage. Ooh, how punk.\\" References External links * Agent Provocateur  Mister Fancy Pants Fights Back * Lingerie firm founder rejects MBE * Vogue article - Like Mother, Like Son Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:People from Clapham Category:Sephardi Jews Category:English fashion designers Category:English Jews Category:English businesspeople Category:English people of Portuguese-Jewish descent ","title":"Joseph Corr√©"},{"id":"24029354","text":"The 1995‚Äì96 Cymru Alliance was the sixth season of the Cymru Alliance after its establishment in 1990.

Jade Dynasty recently released its seventh major expansion, Jade Dynasty: Dance of the Gevrin, increasing the number of factions to 17. It is based on a popular Chinese internet novel Zhu Xian. On May 1, 2018, it was announced that all game servers would be shut down on June 5, 2018. Ever since the shutdown of 'Official', there have been many appearances of private servers trying to recreate what was once quite a popular Chinese MMORPG. Gameplay Jade Dynasty is set in a world based on ancient China, where the secrets of immortality and martial-arts perfection were fought over by six human factions: Jadeon, Skysong, Vim, Lupin, Modo and Incense. Their pursuit of forbidden knowledge brought them into conflict with the demigod tribes of the Athan: Balo, Arden, Rayan, Celan, Forta and Voida. Each faction in Jade Dynasty has different skills, strengths, weaknesses and styles of play. Players can become more powerful through 150 levels, high ascended levels and several endgame skill systems (such as the \\"Chroma\\" system). Esper One of the game's most unusual features is its Espers. This item allows the player to use a function called \\"invigorating\\" to automatically attack enemies, which works similarly to \\"bot\\" programs in many MMORPGs. This feature allows Jade Dynasty players to grind for items and experience while away from their computers. Espers can also be set up to automatically use HP and SP remedies as well as powers (called \\"skills\\" in Jade Dynasty). Espers are also powerful items in their own right, providing bonus skills and extra attributes to the owner. These attributes and skills can be increased both with special items or leveling up the Esper through constant use. The Esper's appearance changes as its level increases. If you ascend your Esper the skill's appearance will change as well as the Esper itself. Pets Players are able to obtain pets and train them, improving their quality and evolving their appearance. Pets are very useful in-game as they attack enemies and possess skills of their own. Pets have levels just like players, but their power is more affected by the pet's Grade stat. A pet will level up either by fighting alongside its master or through items like Kylin or Miradrake Orbs, and its grade can be improved through pet jades. These can be obtained through quests or by trading in Celebean items, available through the Marketplace. All pets have a star sign stat, which determines the attacks they have access to. A pet workshop function exists to craft training materials or gear for pets. The pet's appearance can radically change at grades 12 and 18 using special mushroom items. The appearance change is purely aesthetic - it does not affect the pet's skills or attributes. Pets also chat with the player, with the mood of the pet determining what it says. Grade 20 pets can also be ascended. Their appearance will drastically change, and players are also able to grade them up to grade 30. When pets reach ascension, players are able to summon them instantly, and are also able to fly. Fast Travel Jade Dynasty features several methods for traveling quickly, including Skylords, Skyblades, charms and mounts. Skylords allow players to teleport between towns for a small fee, but players can only teleport to areas when their level is high enough. Skyblades allow players to fly through the air, though they require energy items to use. Permanent skyblades can be obtained from the marketplace and from the Wind Fairy NPC in the Sunstream map. A temporary Skyblade can be obtained by completing a weekly quest from the Wind Fairy. Skyblades also have levels and grades which will increase with use, increasing their speed. The downside is that you cannot fight on Skyblades. Mounts allow a player to travel on the ground faster than they could run, though characters in the Arden faction can outrun most mounts in their fox transformation, which increases resistances and speed. Permanent mounts can be bought from the marketplace and temporary mounts can be won in the Kunlun Wonderland Fair zone. Portal charms and portal scrolls respectively teleport the player to a wanted location and to the actual map's Town (for example if you're in Sunstream and use a portal scroll, you will be teleported to Sunstream City). However, portal charms can be purchased from the marketplace or from other players with Jade Dynastys trading system, while portal scrolls are free and are given to the player each time he uses a Treasure Chest.  Classes  As in most fantasy MMORPGs, the games' different classes, called factions, follow some common archetypes. Their names are, however, very original, as they are based on the Chinese novel Zhu Xian's story. There are three races in Jade Dynasty: the Humans, the Athans, and the Etherkins. The Humans and the Athans races each have six classes in total, with the individual class locked onto that race. The Etherkins currently has five classes. These classes are as follows. Jadeon The Jadeon are one of the three Good-aligned human factions and are the spell-sword mage of the game. They are a class that values honor. They are ranged, possessing very powerful ranged and Area of Effect (AoE) attacks that damage many enemies around a specific point, but have low health and defense stats (this can be compensated with their wide range of protective spells however). They use ice/lightning style spells mixed with martial arts as their combat skills. They use robes, along with a sword as their equipment. Skysong The Skysong are the primary supports in Jade Dynasty. They are a class that values peace. The Skysong are very valuable in group combat due to their ability to cast skills that empower their allies and inflict sleeping effects on their enemies. They have low defense and attack power, but their healing abilities make them very resilient. With themes based around being arcane monks, they have an array of skills that would bless their allies, with some they may use from afar that would heal them and deal considerable damage to the enemy. Skysongs also have area-of-effect spells but not many particularly strong ones. They use robes as their armor, and staffs as their weapons. Lupin The Lupin are human assassins/rogues, with a similar role as the Rayan faction of the Athan. They are a class that values love and despair. They focus almost exclusively on single-target skills, silence curses and \\"buffs\\" that increase their damage or empower their critical hits. Without buffs (and even with buffs), the class is generally weaker on the defensive side compared to the other classes. Their skills involve mainly assassination via dance-themed martial arts and \\"mana burn\\" which would work as a silencer (stopping enemies from resenting too much) in their attacks. The Lupin uses light armor as their means of defensive clothing. Their weapon is the glaive, a round throwing weapon with edges connecting or floating around the main circle. When shown in combat, the glaive floats, spins at a very high speed around the hand of the Lupin individual and will be thrown at the opponent at close range. Vim The Vim are the human anti-paladins. They are a class that values willpower. The Vim faction fights enemies from melee range while having strong defensive capabilities that would make them a worthy adversary to take down. In the story, they were originally a Good-aligned faction, but their disregard for life and careless fighting style have isolated them from the Jadeon and Skysong factions. They use somewhat dark, brutal martial arts, as well as warrior-based skills. They wear heavy armor and their weapon is the duoblade, a double-ended sword. Modo The Modo are the human necromancers. Incredibly versatile, they are generally unpredictable in the three ways that they can strike. As a human, they can transform into two forms: Demonic, and Modon. They are a class that values dark enlightenment. The Demonic Posture shifts them into a melee form that focuses on improving their health, attack, and defense, but lowers their resistances to enemy status effects. Their Modon form improves their resistances, increases their spirit (used in casting skills and maintaining their defensive shield), and uses long-ranged skills, a variety of curses and damage-over-time attacks. Their normal form is the Human form, which can cast powerful area-of-effect attacks, dealing high amount of damage at medium range, but sacrifice defensive capabilities for the power. Their style of skill is dark-necromancy themed, where in many aspects of their spells they will use demonic glyphs as well as summon skulls, bones and parasites to torment their enemy. Their armor are rather strange robes, usually decorated with skeletal linings. They use the fangclaw, a clawed glove or gauntlet that they wear on one hand. Incense Mage The human mages of Incense Valley combine a party-support role with heavy mage-like damage. They are the guardians of Incense Valley, and are one of the three Good-aligned factions. They were introduced in the \\"Legacy\\" expansion along with the Forta. They are a class that values justice. Incense Mages are able to deal a lot of damage over time with the \\"Burn\\" effect many of their attacks inflict. Incense Mages can also focus on party support with area control spells or aura buffs, which grow more powerful with more party members. Their usual style of fighting involves summoning fire, and using their weapons as fire conductors to inflict burning marks onto their enemies. They use robes as armor, and their weapons are kristocs, several rapier-like swords that hover in the air behind them. Balo The Balo tribe of Athan are the barbaric class of the game. Along with the Arden, they were one of two classes introduced in the \\"Ascension\\" expansion. They wield axes and focus on health and defense, even more so than the Vim, which focuses mainly on defensive shields. They do not, however, deal much damage, though they have considerable suppression effects and stacking bleed-puncture skills that would help them slay their opponents. Like the Vim, they wear durable, heavy armor. Arden The archer tribe of the Athan, the Arden are descendants of fox spirits. They have the ability to shape-shift into a fox, raising their speed and resistances exponentially but making them unable to attack. In their normal form they have ears and a tail, whose colors can be customized. The Arden summon plants to inflict status effects on nearby enemies, and wild beasts to attack enemies. Each tier has one plant and one beast summon. Their attacks have the longest range of any faction. They lack much health and defensive capabilities, but make it up for high damage and high range. They use light armor as their defensive equipment as well as bows & arrows as their weapon. Rayan The assassin of the Athan. Along with the Celan, they were one of two classes added in the \\"Vengeance\\" expansion. The Rayan lacks defense, and attacks from melee range. They can however go invisible as well as summon shadow clones of themselves, which can attack, cast skills, and be used in devastating combinations with the caster. They can also transfer damage and debuffs to the shadow as well as teleport to the shadow. They can also curse their enemies and blink to their target, making them deadly in terms of single-target damage. The Rayan can deal large amounts of melee damage in combination with enhancing buffs and their shadow. Their styles of skill primarily focus on pure assassination techniques, mostly focused on taking down their targets quickly with dark slashes and traceless strikes. The Rayan uses light armor, with twin scythes being their weapons. Celan The Celan tribe of Athan are musicians; the \\"bard\\" class of Jade Dynasty. They are the noblest tribe of the Athan, floating slightly off the ground in a graceful glide. They were one of two classes added in the \\"Vengeance\\" expansion. Many of their skills can chain player-chosen notes together for different effects. Like the Skysong, they can heal/bless themselves and other allies. Although lacking health, they can provide themselves and allies a \\"Reflect\\" status, which prevents incoming damage and redirects skills back against the attacker. Their skill style focuses on playing soothing to devastating melodies that can either bless or curse a large area, heal allies or deal moderate damage to enemies in a large distance. They use robes as armor. Celans use the Zither as a weapon, an instrument that is usually played sitting down; however as they glide the Zither they use floats in front of them, ready to cast spells from the strings while in combat. Forta The Forta are swift martial arts melee fighters, aesthetically similar to Balo but focusing on damage. Along with the Incense Mage, the Forta were introduced in the \\"Legacy\\" expansion. The Forta have several skills to keep their enemies in melee range; either pulling or teleporting enemies to the Forta. They are also masters of skill combinations: When they cast some skills, there's a chance that they'll unlock powerful Chain Skills that they can use for a short time. The Forta uses heavy armor, though they do not have as much health/defensive capabilities compared to the other wearers. The Forta fight using cestuses, spiked gauntlets that they wear on each hand. Voida The Voida of the Athan race floats in mid-air like the Celan, however being valiant rather than graceful. They are the light and dark mages of the game, using a combination of divine and unsacred spells. They were the only class that was introduced in the \\"Judgement\\" expansion. The Voida have mastered the power of the light and dark elements, and casting certain skills will move them closer to one of the two extremes. During combat, the class may accumulate 100 points in either by continuously casting light or dark spells. Through this, they may enter either a Dawn or Dusk state, where their main offensive skills will have their cooldowns decreased and their effects enhanced in a way; with the forms being interchangeable by casting light to dark/dark to light spells. Using these two parallels, they may summon dark beasts, curse hexes & holy glyphs as well as charge massively powerful Area-of-Effect attacks through their channeling of darkness and light. The Voida use ethereal robes as armor. Their weapons are the mysterious \\"stardial\\" that appears to be a medium-sized mechanism floating behind their backs. The stardial seems to be the source of their light and dark powers. Psychea The Psychea are the summoners of the Etherkin. Small & childlike in appearance, they were introduced alongside the Kytos in the \\"Regenesis\\" expansion.http://jd.perfectworld.com/regenesis The Psychea are able to effectively control and maneuver zones of the battlefield as they are able to lay various magical/technological traps as well as summon giant celestial & mechanical beasts into battle. The beasts, called \\"Psyteks\\" are usually giant mechanical beasts that are able to be ridden on by the Psychea, letting the class use the beast as a form of debuffing enemies and a gateway to access their powerful skill forms. They are able to also protect the Psychea from killing blows and cost spirit constantly to maintain. Aside from this, the Psychea is also able to render themselves invisible as well as having medium- ranged spells that deal powerful single-target damage; as well as several Area-of-Effect damaging spells that they may use alongside their Psyteks in battle. The Psychea uses a giant calligraphy brush to conjure such beasts and spells, waving it around to create Chinese symbols that allows them to cast spells in the heat of battle. They use robes as their armor. Kytos The Kytos are the Etherkin crusaders. They are four-legged with blue skin, resembling something similar to the centaur/mythical kirin in terms of physique. They are gender-locked to be male only, and were introduced alongside the Psychea in the \\"Regenesis\\" expansion. The Kytos are mobile as well as durable, allowing them to charge straight into the hearts of combat and the vulnerable back lines. They are able to force the assault of enemies onto them, as well as reflect damage and cast defensive buffs onto themselves, rendering the assaults of the offenders useless. They are also able to transform themselves into mounts that their allies can ride on to the fight. Also, they have a human form that allows them to use fashion and ride mounts like other classes and factions, though they are unable to use their skills in human form and thus only in their true form are they suitable for combat. Instead of using \\"spirit\\" (mana in Jade Dynasty) to cast skills, the Kytos instead uses their own health to cast their powerful multi-target skills as well as suppressive effects. They build up \\"Fury\\" in replacement of spending spirit via dealing or taking damage, which, depending on skill choices, allows them to become more powerful in terms of either damage, accuracy of skills, and so on. With these traits combined, the Kytos makes a very powerful warrior as they hastily rush into the front lines of the battlefield. The Kytos uses the spear as their weapon. They use various parts of heavy armor (shoulder pads, etc.) as defensive clothing. In some areas (such as their chests) they are not covered in armor however, which allows them to be incredibly mobile in battle. Hydran These walking arsenals carry a powerful Halberd capable of unleashing an onslaught of damage in a variety of forms. Hydran are known to be quick, agile, and explosive fighters. The Streak System allows Hydran to cast special skills multiple times in quick succession before reaching their cooldown. This allows them to connect a combination of moves to fight enemies without having to slow down. Seira Seira use Fans to support their allies with the power of the wind. Gevrin AKA Ambreller. Etherkin Mages, using an Umbrella as their weapon. Skilled at controlling and AoE Skills.  Tiers  Each faction has 5 Tiers of skills, each unlocked by completing a quest chain at certain milestone levels. Humans begin as non-class Initiates, so Tier 1 begins for them at Level 15, while the Athan and Etherkin start Tier 1 at Level 1. Each faction has its own faction-specific Tier 1 and 2 quests chains, but Tier 3, 4 and 5 quests are the same for all classes. Each Tier contains a standardized amount of skills: nine skills for Tiers 1 ‚Äì 4, and four skills for the Human Initiate tier and Tier 5. To level up skills in higher tiers, lower-level tiers need a certain amount of skill points invested in them. There are not enough skill points to attain all skills at maximum levels, so players choose a specific build to use. This system makes possible several different builds in the same faction, such as Skysongs being able to focus on either healing or fighting. Some players attempt to do both, but this usually results in a character that is a \\"jack of all trades, but master of none\\", so the usual builds focus on one particular strength.  Refinery  Refinery improves the quality of a weapon or a piece of defensive gear, increasing the stat bonuses they grant, and is an important process of the game. Players can use talismans and, sometimes, an auxiliary item to improve, or guarantee the success of a refinery. Refinery improves the quality of the item, adding attributes to it and giving it a glow of different colors depending on the level of the refinery; e.g., a +9 armor grants a high bonus to Defense and glows green. Refined items are invaluable in the endgame, both for PvP and PvE. Refining has a chance to succeed and increase the refinery level, but if it fails, the gear will be destroyed. This may be avoided by using items that either enhance the chances of success, prevent items from breaking or even guarantee success. The following items directly affect the refinery process: 1\\\\. The Star Charm: Increases the chance of success by 15%. Whether this is multiplicative or additive remains to be confirmed. 2\\\\. The Serenity Jade: Prevents the item from breaking. Instead, should the refinery process fail, the refine level will be reduced by 1. If your item was +5 and the refinery process fails serenity jade, your item will be returned to you at +4, and both the serenity jade and refinery talisman are consumed. 3\\\\. Sigils: Guarantees success of refining your item up to a certain value. There are tiers of Sigils that can increase the maximum refinery value, with Dragon Sigils the highest obtainable by exchanging lower-level sigils, and Kirin Sigils the highest-level sigils overall. Star Charms, Serenity Jades and Bronze Sigils can be purchased in the marketplace.  The Marketplace  The Marketplace is a cash shop where Jaden can be exchanged for some items. Jaden can currently be purchased for US$1 per 1 Jaden. Jaden can also be purchased from other players for in-game gold via a banker function. The in-game gold to Jaden ratio is steadily rising. Unlike some games, Jade Dynasty can be played without using the Marketplace, but you will be at a disadvantage relative to cash shop players.  Treasure Chest / Brocade Box  The Treasure Chest is an item received by every new character containing a basic set of items. It can be opened every 5 levels, and some of the items are exclusive or usually only available in the Marketplace. The Brocade Box is a box received by Inductees, similarly to a referral program. Characters on a new account can enter a level 60+ player's induction code when they first create a character. The Inductor receives Bonus Jaden each time his/her inductee reaches a certain level, and the Inductee can open the Brocade Box for items. The Inductee's Brocade Box is similar to the Treasure Chest in the respect that it can be opened every 5 levels up to level 90, after which it opens at levels 120, 135, and 150.  Ascension  Ascension works similarly to the New Game+ option in many RPGs, allowing high-level players to reset down to being Level 15. As players level back up, they'll have higher stats than before they Ascended; stat bonuses will be higher the higher the character's level was before Ascending. To make this distinction, players will say that someone is \\"Ascended Level 75\\" versus just \\"Level 75.\\" Ascending is a quest available only to Tier 5 characters, level 150. Players can either go through a series of trials, or the trials can be skipped by having a large enough amount of honour, piety, charity, culture or renown. Ascending allows players to choose to switch to a different faction: Human characters can become any of six human factions, and Athan characters can become any of the six Athan tribes. Characters will have special Ascension skills depending on their factions pre- and post-Ascension. Ascended characters will have access to a new mandatory quest chain, and as well as to many new areas, new gear, new skills, and the Affinity and Chroma systems. Ascended characters can further level up higher to 170.  Affinity  Upon reaching Ascended Level 90, characters will receive a new Mandatory quest called \\"The Divination.\\" Completing this quest will let character choose between the three Affinities: the crusading Dagos, the dark Felkin, or the meditative Fuwa. Each affinity grants a set of skills that players can learn and level up, five of which are faction-specific. Characters may only be part of one affinity at a time, but some items in the Marketplace switch affinities. The affinity skills from the previous affinity will not be usable, but if a character ever reverts to the original affinity, that affinity's skills will be at the same level as before the affinity change. Choosing an affinity allows the player access to a whole new map dependent on their faction. This map is where most high-level players grind for items and experience.  Chroma  Once a character reaches Ascended Level 120 and has chosen an Affinity, they are able to unlock the Chroma system. Players can gain Chroma experience points from Chroma Bead items, which can be spent on increasing their Chroma level or on learning Chroma skills. Higher Chroma levels provide stat bonuses and make many Chroma skills more powerful. Each faction and Affinity combination has access to 20 Chroma skills, which can be leveled up with Chroma experience. These endgame skills are often upgraded versions of earlier skills: three improved Affinity skills and four improved faction skills.  Game versions  {! Expansion name !! Version !! Factions |- !

Co-founders were David Flynn and Rick White. The company was based in Cottonwood Heights, Utah, near Salt Lake City. In June 2006, the company name was changed to Fusion Multisystems, Incorporated. A product with the brand name ioDrive was demonstrated and announced in September 2007. In March 2008, Fusion-io raised $19 million in a series A round of funding from a group of investors led by New Enterprise Associates. David Flynn was chief technology officer, while Don Basile was chief executive officer at the time. Michael Dell invested in Fusion-io during this round.

In May 2010, the Linux block-io principal developer, Jens Axboe, joined Fusion-io after leaving Oracle. Fusion-io first filed for an initial public offering (IPO) in March 2011, with shares to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange with symbol FIO. At the time, Facebook accounted for most of its revenues. In June 2011, Fusion-io announced it increased the price of its IPO to put the company's total value at $1.4 billion. The company had previously priced its shares to value the company at about $1.17 billion. The shares were offered on June 9, raising the valuation to about $2 billion.

A scalable multi-queue block layer for the Linux kernel was developed by Fusion-io engineers Axboe and Shaohua Li, and merged into the Linux kernel mainline in kernel version 3.13, released on January 19, 2014. This new block layer uses parallelism (and thus provides much higher performance) offered by SSDs using NVM Express. With the release of Linux kernel version 3.13, only the virtioblk driver has been modified to actually use this new interface. A technical presentation paper of this new feature was published at ACM SYSTOR'13. During the first half of 2014, Fusion- io sponsored conversion of the Linux kernel SCSI core to the blk-mq approach.

The party was founded in May 2009 after discussions on the Pirate Parties International website and re-founded in April 2012. The Irish party began to gain attention after the official registration of Pirate Party UK. History Discussions were started on the Pirate Parties International discussion forum in 2007 relating to setting up an Irish Pirate Party. A small number of people were involved in the talks at the time and little was done apart from some basic planning and writing of a party constitution. In 2009 more people joined the discussions and shortly thereafter the party set up its own website, inititially in the format of a forum. The party claimed to have exceeded membership of 300 on the 30 May 2010, the minimum required number to register as a political party in the country. However, in the run-up to the 2011 Irish election, the party was not able to hold a national convention in order to fulfill one of the requirements of registration. Interest in the party seemed to wane, the party did not contend in the election and in March 2011 a note was placed on the party website stating it was disbanding. In March 2011 the party dissolved. The Party was re-founded in April 2012 and a new website 'www.pirateparty.ie' was set up and the party has again started to invite new membership and initiated various debates on the party's forum. In June 2012 the Pirate Party of Ireland was removed from the list of Members of the Pirate Parties International by the decision of the PPI's Court of Arbitration, clarifying that the new Pirate Party Ireland is not a continuation of the old one.

The younger brother of Abdullah √ñcalan, Osman studied at teachers' training college before joining the PKK when it was founded in 1978 and spending two years in Libya. He joined the central committee in 1986, and the executive committee in the 1990s, becoming virtually second in command of the PKK. But in 1992, after signing a truce with the two main Iraqi Kurdish parties, the KDP and the PUK, he suffered disgrace and was jailed by the PKK. \\"In June 1993, they removed all my powers\\", he told The Middle East in an interview. \\"I was isolated in a cell for three months and interrogated for 52 days before being tried in February 1995. The trial lasted only one day.I was warned that if I continued to defend my ideas, I would be executed. If not, I would be pardoned. A lawyer? Out of the question. The trial was conducted under the law of the mountain\\". In 1994, he left the PKK in order to marry a fellow PKK fighter. The PKK forbids relationships between its guerillas. He later rejoined the PKK. In 2000 the Independent referred to him as a \\"senior commander\\" of the PKK when Medya TV, the underground Kurdish satellite television channel reported him as claiming that the Turkish authorities wanted his brother to die. In March 2003, in an interview to western journalists from his refuge in the Qandil mountains, he asserted \\"We will never allow ourselves to be disarmed as long as the Kurdish issue is not settled\\". He split away from the PKK again in August 2004 to form the Patriotic Democratic Party (PWD) with Hikmet Fidan, after a lost power struggle with Murat Karayƒ±lan and Cemal Bayƒ±k. But the PWD was short-lived, did not become important party and after Fidan was assassinated in Diyarbakir in July 2005, the PWD merged with the HADEP. In November 2007, in an interview in Erbil, he claimed that the PKK were retreating from Iraq into Iran. He estimated the total strength of the PKK guerrillas at just under 7,000. \\"There are 2,750 fighters in Turkey\\", he said. \\"A further 2,500 are in the border areas of Iraq and 1,500 are in Iran ... In the last six months the PKK has started a war against Iran\\". Speaking from his home in Koya in Iraqi Kurdistan, he claimed that Turkey was denying medical treatment to his brother Abdullah Ocalan and warned that suicide bombers would strike Turkish cities if he died in prison. Today's Zaman, referring to him as a \\"former PKK leader\\", quoted him as saying \\"For 20 years I was part of the struggle; but because of ideological differences, I pulled out of it. Now I am with armed fighters who defend themselves, but am against the PKK\\". In August 2009, Hurriyet reported that Abdullah √ñcalan has produced a 125-page petition in which he suggested that his brother Osman be investigated for his links to Ergenekon.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981 and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1994.  Description  The Hall is a two-story Richardsonian Romanesque structure on a rough sandstone base (47 pages, with map and 12 photos) The first story is constructed of red brick, with lighter brick above; belt courses run between floors and above the windows; additional trim is made from sandstone.Lake Linden Village Hall and Fire Station from the state of Michigan, retrieved 8/18/09 A square tower dominates the center of the front facade; the front entrance is through the tower. Pavilions on each side of the tower terminate in gables projecting from the hipped roof,Copper Country Architacts: Charles K. Shand, retrieved 8/19/09 originally covered with slate. Each of the pavilions has a group of three arched windows on each story; the tower has two arched windows on each story and a single arched entrance on the ground level. The third story of the tower is pierced with arched openings, and an octagonal cupola sits atop the tower. A small, flat-roofed, one-story addition projects toward the rear. The interior of the building is finished with plaster and wainscoting, and contains Art Deco light fixtures. The first floor contains a village office, police and fire station, and a lounge area. The second floor contains a council hall, large meeting room, and kitchen, bathroom, and storage facilities.  History  The village of Lake Linden suffered a devastating fire in May 1887, which affected 75% of the structures. Although the frame village hall survived, city fathers believed that a new fireproof structure with space for a fire station would be in the best interests of the community. In 1901, the village asked architects for designs, and chose one submitted by Charles K. Shand of Calumet. The Hall was built by a local contractor, L. F. Ursin, and opened in 1902, serving as village offices, fire station, polling place, and public meeting hall. A propeller from the Lady Be Good, an American B-24 Liberator lost in the Libyan Desert in April 1943, is on display in front of the village hall. Crewmember T/Sgt. Robert E.

It is a loose remake of Charles Kaufman's Mother's Day and was written by Scott Milam and produced by Brett Ratner. The film is about three brothers who fail to rob a bank then run to their mother so she can help them get away. The brothers discover that their mother has lost her house in a foreclosure. The brothers hold the new owners and their guests hostage. When their mother arrives, she takes control of the situation. Synopsis An unknown woman enters a maternity ward and, with help from an accomplice, steals a newborn baby, Terry (J. Larose), one of the guards catches them in the act but ends up being stabbed to death. Beth Sohapi (Jaime King) is having a birthday party for her husband, Daniel Sohapi (Frank Grillo) with the help of their friends, married couple Treshawn (Lyriq Bent) and Gina Jackson (Kandyse McClure); Dave Lowe (Tony Nappo) and his fiancee, Annette Langston (Briana Evigan); George Barnum (Shawn Ashmore) and his girlfriend, Melissa McGuire (Jessie Rusu); and Daniel's co worker, and friend, Julie Ross (Lisa Marcos). The news reports a tornado is heading their way; Daniel assures his guests that the basement is tornado proof. After a bank robbery gone wrong, three brothers, eldest and leader Ike (Patrick Flueger), irrational and irresponsible Addley (Warren Kole) and Johnny (Matt O'Leary), who has been badly injured, are on the run from the law. They reach their mother's house only to find it unrecognizable. Daniel and Beth, hearing noise upstairs, leave the basement party only to find the brothers holding them hostage within their home at gunpoint. Terrified, Beth offers the brothers the help of George, a doctor, who begins to tend to Johnny's injuries. Addley forces Beth and Daniel downstairs, trapping all the party-goers in the basement at gunpoint. Ike calls his sister Lydia (Deborah Ann Woll), who informs him that she and their mother lost the house and will be on their way to help the boys. A short time later, an RV arrives with Lydia and Mother (Rebecca De Mornay) with Lydia rushing to Johnny's side, showing she only has compassion for him. Mother becomes very angry at Ike for losing the emergency phone they use to contact one another, telling him she was unable to alert him of losing the house. Realizing the gravity of the situation, Mother arranges help to sneak over the border into Canada, however it will cost ten thousand dollars. She learns of her sons sending money to the house which she never received, before going into the basement. Mother is initially nice to the hostages, explaining to them that no one has to get hurt. She confronts Beth and Daniel about the money, however both deny knowing about it. Mother believes Beth, however she has Addley and Ike torture Daniel for information. Just then Melissa attempts to escape, only to be shot by Addley. Mother strikes Addley for his behavior then takes the cellphones, bank cards and pin numbers of the others and makes Ike take Beth to a cash machine to collect the money. Meanwhile, Mother informs George to keep Johnny alive, or they will all die, with Lydia told to help George and Johnny. A police officer (Mike O'Brien) arrives after the three suspects of the bank robbery are identified as the old residents of the house, but Daniel makes him leave assuring him everything is fine, thus alerting Mother of Daniel's lying skills. She further becomes suspicious after Lydia discovers a Valentine's card from Daniel to Julie, as well as photographs and newspaper articles of a child killed in a car accident. Ike and Beth dispose of Melissa's body behind a dumpster, where she is soon found to be alive by two sanitation workers who rush her to a hospital. While at the ATM, Beth and Ike encounter two party girls, Vicky Rice (A. J. Cook) and Jenna Luther (Alexa Vega), who Ike quickly kills after they realize he has a gun. The pair travel to Treshawn's laundromat business to take money out of the safe, where Beth attempts to escape but fails, while later encountering the same police officer who Ike then kills. Back at the house, George realizes Mother has been lying to Lydia about a rare skin condition and tries to convince her to help his friends, but Mother sends Lydia away. Johnny, now in critical condition, has to be resuscitated by Lydia and George when he goes into cardiac arrest, telling his mother he doesn't want to die a virgin. Mother forces Treshawn and Dave to fight over which one of their partners will be forced to have sex with Johnny. Dave loses and Annette is forced upstairs. However Johnny's injuries prove too severe to rape Annette and she is forced back into the basement by Addley. Dave attacks Addley, resulting in Addley accidentally shooting Dave in the face, killing him. Gina takes the opportunity to try to escape, however is brought back to the house by Daniel in order to save Beth. In the basement, Mother informs Gina that disobedience has consequences, before pouring boiling water over Treshawn. Mother then attempts to find her money by burning the photographs of the boy, revealed to be Daniel and Beth's deceased son. Mother then sets Julie's hair on fire, but extinguishes it when she realizes Daniel is telling the truth about the money. Mother leaves the basement, before the group manage to arm themselves with knives. They lure Addley into the basement and stab him to death. Treshawn, now deaf and having difficulty seeing, takes Addley's gun and goes upstairs. Gina follows him, startling him and causing him to shoot her in the side. As Treshawn attempts to help his wife, Mother shoots him in the back, killing him. Mother discovers Addley's body and phones Ike, before forcing Beth to listen to her shoot Daniel. Annette and Julie are then taken upstairs and tied up. At the hospital, Melissa regains consciousness and alerts authorities to the house. George confronts Mother, telling her that none of her kids look like one another, and look nothing like her. Mother, enraged, threatens to kill him, but Lydia convinces her that they still need George to help Johnny. Ike and Beth then burst through the front door with the money, Ike heading downstairs to mourn his loss. Mother instructs Ike, Lydia and George to take Johnny to the RV while she has a chat with the ladies. Inside the RV, Johnny, hoping to please his mother and older brother, shoots George in spite of Lydia's pleas to let him live. Mother reveals to Julie and Annette that Beth was the one who hid the money and is the one responsible for all the deaths. Beth reveals that she was hiding the money for the baby she is expecting. She also reveals she knew Daniel was cheating on her with Julie, and wanted to leave him. Mother forces Beth to take a pregnancy test to prove it, before Beth knocks Mother unconscious. Beth unties Julie - who is shot in the head by Ike while trying to escape the house - and Annette, who hides with Beth in the garage. Together they manage to overpower Ike and kill him. Annette escapes to the neighbours, while Beth fights with Mother in the house. Beth is knocked unconscious and Mother sets the house on fire. However, Beth wakes up and overpowers Mother, hitting her with a wooden chopping board, before escaping the house along with Gina, who has survived her injuries. Months later, a very pregnant Beth goes into labor and is taken to the hospital by Annette, Gina and Melissa. That night, Beth wakes up to the emergency alarms going off in the maternity ward. She gets up and goes to check on her baby, but the bassinette is empty. The film ends with Lydia, Johnny and Mother leaving the country in the RV with Beth's baby.

Hoyland Fox is an umbrella frame manufacturer founded and formerly based in Sheffield, UK.  History  Samuel Fox founded Fox Umbrella Frames Ltd in 1842 in Stocksbridge, Sheffield, UK. Fox Umbrella Company started with a rain umbrella product. Samuel Fox is the first inventor of the U-shape ribs (called \\"Paragon\\"). William Hoyland, assistant of Samuel Fox, built his own company William Hoyland Ltd in 1875. Hoyland and Fox‚Äôs Chief engineer Joseph Hayward set up business to produce the patented \\"Flexus\\" frame as an alternative to Fox' \\"Paragon\\" frame. The \\"Flexus\\" frame is built up of solid ribs with flat spring stretchers coupled in pairs and in such a manner that all the stretchers were under tension when the frame was in any position except when fully closed. Samual Fox became the largest umbrella frame manufacturer in the world around the turn of last century. The company went on to be one of the largest steel makers in UK before being nationalised by British Steel. In late 1987, Readicut International bought William Hoyland and Co. Ltd from local owners. One year later, Hoyland acquired Fox Umbrella Frames Ltd and established the present company Hoyland Fox Limited. The Activa Group acquired Hoyland Fox Ltd in 2008 and transferred the brand name, patents, technology, tools and machinery to its China factory ending 166 years of Sheffield tradition.

Delhi Durga Puja Samiti, also known as the Kashmere Gate Durga Puja is the oldest community Durga Puja (festival) of Delhi. It is currently held in the lawns of Bengali Sr Sec School, Alipur Road, Delhi. It started in the year of 1910 at Roshanpura Kali Mandir near Nai Sarak as \\"Baroyari Puja\\" (Public Festival). It was an effort on the part of the probasi (settled) Bengalis living in the city, especially, of one Railway Doctor Hemchandra Sen (whose efforts saw the Puja being brought at a rented place at Roshanpura). Subsequently, Lala Lachminarayan & his son Lala Girdhari Lal helped the puja samiti grow by providing them space (from 1913 to 1946) in their Dharamshala located near Fathepuri Mosque. Prior to 1910, the first Durga Puja is believed to have been celebrated as far back as 1842 by one Majumdar of Rajshai, the next two were held in 1875 and 1904. However, all of them were Private Pujas and discontinued thereafter. With Bengalis embracing English education with great enthusiasm, many had to leave home to serve in different parts of the country during British times. This brought a clutch of Bengalis to the city. And in 1911, when Delhi was officially declared the Capital of British India, a good chunk of them came to work in various government offices. These educated Bengalis formed a close knit community, unhindered by petty professional jealousies. This gave a huge thrust to the annual Durga puja celebrations. At first (in 1910 & 1911), the puja in Delhi was performed by ritually consecrating the ‚Äòmangal ghata‚Äô ‚Äî the earthenware pot, symbol of the ‚ÄòDevi‚Äô. However, enthusiasm was unbounded when idol worship (pratima puja) started in 1912. With the help of the late Parmananda Biswas, who happened to be a Christian gentleman, an idol was brought from Varanasi (Kashi). Many Railway employees too made it possible to bring the idol from Kashi to Delhi. This arrangement continued till 1925. From 1926, the idol began to be made in the city itself. Since then its no looking back. Many eminent persons visited this Puja venue including the stalwarts like Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose in 1935 and Smt Indira Gandhi, the then PM, in 1969.. About the Durga Puja (DDPS) The DDPS has continued to stress the traditional aura & atmosphere of its Durga Puja Celebrations akin to 'Rajbaris' of Bengal. At DDPS, Durga is always in the traditional 'Daaker Saaj' (with one frame idol), her garments are stylish, crimped decoration in silver and gold, with an intricate glittering crown and huge earrings. On Dashmi evening, when the idols are immersed in the river Yamuna, DDPS arrives with their magnificent but tranquil goddess on bullock cart chanting 'Durga Mai Ki Jai' and drum beats by at least 10-12 dhakis (Bengali drummers) accompanied by the men & women in dhoti-Kurta and red bordered saree, respectively. Centenary Celebration 2009 (DDPS) The DDPS celebrated its Centenary Year (100 years) in September 2009. The DDPS had been focused on planning it for an entire two years. The DDPS had arranged cultural events from 23 September to 27 September with a stress on the traditional art & culture of India. Mrs Sheila Dikshit, the Chief Minister (Delhi Govt.) offered her Ashtami puja at DDPS during the Evening of 26 September 2009.

To further this end, GreyNet has signed on to the OpenGrey repository and in so doing seeks to preserve and make openly available research results originating in the International Conference Series on Grey Literature. GreyNet together with INIST-CNRS have designed the format for a metadata record, which encompasses standardized PDF attachments of the full-text conference preprints, PowerPoint presentations, abstracts, biographical notes, and post-publication commentaries. GreyNet's collection of over 270 conference preprints is both current and comprehensive. Comment from Peter Suber, Open Access News (Thursday, January 29, 2009): GreyNet started making its conference proceedings OA through its repository in May 2008. I applaud its determination to complete the collection retroactively, even if it means buying permission from a publisher. Note to other conference organizers: This is a reason to self-archive your proceedings as you go, or at least to retain the right to self-archive them without a fee.  GreyNet and the DANS Data Archive  GreyNet‚Äôs research data is cross-linked to the corresponding conference preprint in OpenGrey via the DANS Data Archive. In this way these results can further serve the international grey literature community, where open access to research data has now become a prerequisite.  Web-based Resources in Grey Literature: GreySource, GreyText, IDGL, WHOIS  GreySource provides examples of grey and malin-grey literature to the average net-user (see for instance the University of Queensland list ) and in so doing profiles organizations responsible for its production and/or processing. Only web-based resources that explicitly refer to the term grey literature (or its equivalent in any language) are listed. GreySource identifies the hyperlink directly embedded in a resource, thus allowing immediate and virtual exposure to grey literature. The web-based resources appear within categories derived from the COSATI (American) and SIGLE (European) Classification Systems. The few changes that have been introduced into the classification scheme are intended to facilitate the search and retrieval of net-users. New examples are welcome and will be indexed in GreySource. GreyText is an inhouse archive of documents on grey literature. Over 125 documents are indexed by first author followed by the title, source, date of publication and length in printed pages. Free Access to the first page of each document is available for browsing. Also, in most cases the corresponding PowerPoint is online available. The full-text of all documents listed in GreyText are accessible in PDF via email on demand. IDGL, International Directory of Organizations in Grey Literature provides a list of some 170 organizations in more than 30 countries worldwide that are currently associated with GreyNet either via partnership, membership, sponsorship, or authorship in the field of grey literature. Entries are alphabetical by country and each entry has an embedded link to the corresponding organization's website. GreyNet International is proud in serving the grey literature community and welcomes additions and revisions to this Directory. WHOIS in the Field of Grey Literature is a compilation of over 350 biographical notes provided by authors in the International Conference Series on Grey Literature and The Grey Journal. This online resource is maintained by TextRelease, the Program and Conference Bureau. Records in this directory appear in alphabetical order by last name of author and each record contains a current email address.  Education and Curriculum Development  In 2007 GreyNet conducted an international survey on grey literature among instructors in LIS higher education. In the same year, GreyNet implemented a distant education course on grey literature at the University of New Orleans. In 2009, GreyNet began the Annual Summer Workshop Series \\"GreyWorks\\", which is now in its 7th year. This series seeks to highlight the state of the art in grey literature by focussing on strategies, benchmarks, good practices, mind maps, and transparency in this field of library and information science. In 2013, GreyNet began the GreyForum, a Thematic Series of Onsite and Online Seminars and Workshops in the field of Grey Literature. Topics dealt with in this series have dealt with information ethics, information rights, digital preservation, and policy development  GreyNet management  The GreyNet Service is powered by TextRelease, an independently owned company based in Amsterdam. TextRelease is GreyNet's program and conference bureau. TextRelease was responsible for GreyNet‚Äôs relaunch in 2003.

It was an all-weather temporary field built by the XII Engineer Command using a graded earth compacted surface, with a prefabricated hessian (burlap) surfacing known as PHS. PHS was made of an asphalt- impregnated jute which was rolled out over the compacted surface over a square mesh track (SMT) grid of wire joined in 3-inch squares. Pierced Steel Planking was also used for parking areas, as well as for dispersal sites, when it was available. In addition, tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting. Once completed it was turned over for use by tactical light bombers of the United States Army Air Force Twelfth Air Force 47th Bombardment Group. The 47th first arrived at the airfield on 10 January 1944, however it had to abandon the field on 22 March 1944 due to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius which severely damaged the field and several A-20 Havoc aircraft. The group was evacuated to Capodichino Airport near Naples for several weeks until they returned to the repaired base on 25 April, remaining until 10 June 1944. When the 47th pulled out, the airfield was dismantled and abandoned. Today, the location of the field can not be precisely determined, as the suburbs of Naples have expanded and the area where it was located is now developed. References * Maurer, Maurer.

Through the principle of feed-back, the signal produced by the excitation of the skin returns to the skin in the form of acoustic pressure. The result is an infinitely sustained sound. The system controls the damping of the movement of the skin, and therefore the decay rate of the sound, and permits isolation of high frequency modes by the combined action of nodes present on the skin and the amount of feed-back input energy.Universidad Complutense de Madrid The design on the skin surface is a simplified map of the oscillatory modes based on the Bessel functions. The map was limited to 13 diameters and 8 nodal circles, the latter divided into even semicircles (to the left) and odd semicircles (to the right).Max Planck Institut - Informatik See also Skin-Act. Image: Feed2.jpg|Map of the first 13 nodal diameters Image: Feed3.jpg|Feed- drum, first map with 13 diameters and 8 nodal circles Experimental Work Although the skin of an imperial bass drum allows the excitation of a considerable number of high-frequency modes, their duration in time is not normally appreciable by the listener, apart from the timbric contribution to the attack phase of the sound. The possible variations of the mode of emission, adequate for a sufficient acoustic response of the resonator (shell), are limited and with scarce modulability. The basic frequency, obtained by the tension of the skins, upper and lower, each bound to the edges with 16 mechanical tie rods, is influenced by the non-homogeneous distribution of the tensioning forces which contributes to render complex the spectrum of the real modes.Exibart Experiments were made at the Centro Ricerche Musicali - CRM in RomeGran Cassa and the Adaptive Instrument Feed-Drum - Computer Music Modeling and Retrieval - Seno, Lorenzo - Lupone, Michelangelo - Springer Verlag 2006 - CRM - Centro Ricerche Musicali and at the Istituto Gramma in L'Aquila with the aim of achieving these objectives: * Variation of basic frequency through application of nodal constraints to the skin * Identification of timbres on the basis of type, mode, and point of excitation * Sound modulation through glissandos, vibratos, portamento, and rhythmic micro-articulation * Continuous or step variations of the dynamics, on the basis of the type of damping applied to the skin Traditional bass drums obviously do not provide these characteristics. To explore the timbre richness of the attack phase and isolate the vibrational modes, the makers created a system to electronic manipulate the skin. Through the principle of feedback, the system returns the signal produced by the excitation of the skin back to the skin as acoustic pressure. This produces infinite prolongation of the sound. The system controls the damping the skin, and therefore the decay rate of the sound, and permits isolating high frequency modes by the combined action of the nodes present on the skin and of the amount of feed-back input energy.Springer Berlin Heidelberg The stability of the signal obtained with this conditioning system makes it possible to experiment and design on the skin surface a preliminary simplified map of the oscillatory modes based on the Bessel‚Äôs functions. The map is limited to 13 diameters and 8 nodal circles, the latter divided into even semicircles (to the left) and odd semicircles (to the right). Electronic conditioning of the instrument leaves the topology and primary acoustic features unaltered, but increases the scope of the vibrational criteria and control. This made it possible to distinguish the different pitches of various modes, to obtain the emission of long notes, which could be modulated as those emitted by a stretched string, and to adapt the acoustic energy independently of the emitted frequencies.INIST/CNRS To maintain agile execution and adequate reproducibility of the phenomena, the first classification of sounds and performance techniques was limited to the use of fingers, hands and arms (Fig. 4). During the composition of Gran Cassa by Michelangelo Lupone, experiments were also made with objects of different shapes and dimensions occupying wider or multiple nodal sections. This increased the sound possibilities. However, the complexity of the vibrational phenomena required analysis of the instrument's mechanical parts to identify and reduce dispersions and non-linear contributions from vibrations of the structural materials and their combinations. Image: Feed4.jpg|Fig. 4 Feed- drum, one of the performance techniques for the excitation of high frequency modes Image: Feed5.jpg|Fig. 5 Feed-drum Image: Feed6.jpg|Fig. 6 Feed-back ‚Äì 3 Feed-drums (2002), excerpt from the score Given these complications, it was decided to plan and realize a new instrument, the Feed-drum (Fig. 5), for the purpose of not only extending the acoustic possibilities, but also of permitting the ergonomic use of new executive techniques. In particular, the vibrational attitude was transformed by eliminating the lower skin, a decision which simplified the tuning of the instrument‚Äôs basic frequency (30 Hz) and reduced the excitation rise time in the upper modes. A synthetic membrane was applied with isotropic characteristics and high flexibility on which the previously described map was drawn, with colors that made the areas of performance more visible. The shell and the tensioning hoop were realized in steel and aluminium; in particular, the tensioning hoop was made stiffer while the height was reduced and the adhesion surface increased. The suspension system was realized in such a way as to separate the Feed-drum completely from the supporting structure on the ground; all the mechanical parts, which were in contact with one another, were separated by an intermediate layer of antivibrational material.Conservatory of Music Alfredo Casella L'Aquila Retrieved on August 21, 2009 Theory of Operation The behaviour of the Feed-drum is extremely complex and many of its aspects remain to be clarified. Below are the known elements, those conjectural, and those still undefined. The oscillation modes of a circular non-rigid membrane‚Äîpegged down and stretched along its rim‚Äîare known from literature. In a conservative model (that is, without dissipations and acoustic irradiations and therefore ‚Äúin vacuum‚Äù ), the oscillation modes of a membrane of radius a have the form in cylindrical coordinates z (\\\\rho,\\\\phi,\\\\tau) = R (\\\\rho) * \\\\Phi(\\\\phi) * cos (\\\\omega * \\\\tau) (1) where: R (\\\\rho) = Jn (m, k\\\\rho) and \\\\Phi(\\\\phi)= A * cos (m*\\\\phi + \\\\phi^0) and where Jn (m,x) are Bessel functions of the first kind and of an order m*\\\\phi^0 is an arbitrary phase dependent on the initial conditions (there cannot be any privileged directions, since the problem applies to a circular symmetry). Owing to the constraint on the rim, R(a)=Jn(m,k*a)=0, where a is the radius of the membrane; this allows calculating k (wave number) which is discrete and dependent on two indices (m,n): k_{m,n} = R_{m,n}/a, whereR_{m,n} is the nth root of the Bessel function of order m, Jn(m,x). Hence (1) becomes z_{m,n}(\\\\rho,\\\\phi,\\\\tau)=A_{m,n}*Jn(m, k_{m,n} \\\\rho) * cos (m*\\\\phi + \\\\phi_{m,n}^0). Determination of the wave number is therefore possible by determining the roots of the Bessel function of the first kind. Once the roots and wave numbers are determined, the angular frequencies peculiar to the modes are given by: \\\\omega_{m,n}=k_{m,n}*c where c is the velocity propagation of transverse waves in the membrane, c=\\\\sqrt{T/\\\\sigma} where T is the stretching force of the rim and \\\\sigma is the surface density of the membrane. However, c can easily be estimated on the basis of the frequency v_{1} of mode (0,1), the lowest of all (basic frequency), taking into account that R_{0,1}= 2.405 : c=\\\\tfrac{2*\\\\pi*v_{1}}{R_{0,1}} * a For the Feed-Drum, a=0.51 m and v_{1}=30 Hz, and therefore c=40 m/s. Irrespective of the order of the Bessel functions, the root base tends to \\\\pi for m\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty [2]; in addition, Bessel functions of different order do not have coincident roots (an important consideration for the purpose of the Feed-drum). The exact calculation of the roots can only be realized numerically, a task which is not particularly difficult given the oscillatory character (even if not periodical) of Bessel functions. In fact, the roots of these functions are each comprised between a maximum and a minimum or vice versa. Image:Feed78.jpg|Fig. 7 & Fig.8 Calculations of the frequencies for the modes up to 5 octaves above the ‚Äúbasic frequency‚Äù (960 Hz for the Feed-drum) gives the following distributions of frequencies and modal density: Image:Feed910.jpg|Fig.9 & Fig.10 Image:Feed11.jpg|Fig.11 The index m is responsible for the creation of nodal diameters, the index n for that of nodal circles. In general, the pattern of the modes is simply correlated to the indices, as can be seen from the diagrams given below. Conditioning System and Implementation Excitation of the membrane is via a loudspeaker (√ò = 45 cm.) and an 11 cm-long wave guide (designed to convey maximum acoustic pressure between the center and 1/3 of the radius); that is, fairly short as far as the form factor is concerned. It proved fairly easy to obtain, in addition to the 30 Hz basic frequency, the 68.9 Hz frequency corresponding to the mode (0,2). It was on the contrary impossible to obtain the frequency of 47.8 Hz corresponding to the mode (1,1). At these frequencies, the behavior of the air excited by the loudspeaker can presumably be schematized with a piston motion, which exercises an almost uniform pressure on the membrane. A uniform excitation is poorly compatible with the modal form (1,1). The loudspeaker was driven by an electric power signal, generated by a feed-back system that sampled the signal issued by a piezoceramic sensor placed on the rim and detecting deflection of the membrane. In this way a ‚Äúmultimodal‚Äù oscillator was obtained generating a feed-back on a resonant element, the membrane. The loop gain was controllable by a pedal.Corriere della Sera Intonation of the Upper Modes Intonation is through the combined action of the negative feed-back gain and of the pressure on one or two points of a nodal line. The effect of the pressure can be schematized in a first approximation as dual: on one hand the introduction of a constraint on the pressure points, on the other a shift of the ‚Äúwork point‚Äù of the membrane around a slightly higher tension, and therefore an increase of the transverse wave velocity c. Consequently, all the frequencies move upwards. It is a matter of a shift mechanism, a ‚Äúpitch-shift‚Äù, in the sense that the frequencies of the modes are all multiplied by a common factor, therefore leaving unchanged their relationships. In point of fact this effect has been encountered in practice and is utilized for obtaining the vibrato. The term ‚Äúpitch-shift‚Äù is however improper in this case, since the spectrum of the partial tones of the membrane is not harmonic and as a result a pitch is not definable. The apposition of constraint points (z = 0) has the effect, as a rule, of inhibiting every mode which has no set of nodal lines passing through all the aforesaid points, not even with an opportune choice of \\\\phi_{0}. For example, pressing the center of the membrane makes all the modes with m=0 becoming impracticable, since this point is invariably an antinode for these modes. Pressure on any other point of the membrane (speaking theoretically) makes all the modes with m\\\\geq 1 practicable, since it will always be possible to have a nodal diameter passing through that point. In practice, since the constraint is not perfect, preference will be given to the mode which possesses both a nodal diameter and a nodal circle passing through that point. The consequence of the fact that the functions of Bessel have no coincident roots is that the modes of different m order cannot have coincident nodal circles. Even modes with the same m and different n obviously cannot have coincident nodal circles. Two different modes can, on the other hand, have coincident nodal diameters if the ratio of their indices m is an integer number. A single pressure point different from the centre identifies therefore a mode only having a diameter and a circle passing through that point. The points which ‚Äúdiscriminate‚Äù better the frequency modes are, however, those near the centre, because the nodal circles become densely packed towards the perimeter and a single point therefore tends to have many of them very near to it. Consequently, it is the first nodal circle, the innermost one, which best discriminates the modes, as is also shown by a variance analysis. In theory, pressure on any two points of the membrane could create constraints incompatible with any mode. However, all these considerations are better limited to modes of relatively low order. In fact it can be presumed that the approximation of the non-rigid membrane results less valid with the increase of the mode order, since the node base tends to become comparable with the thickness of the membrane itself. There are also other considerations. The classic equation of the membrane generally used for obtaining the modes is entirely conservative and does not take into account either dissipation due to internal friction or irradiation. The latter both being mechanisms that dampen the partials, causing their decay in the absence of an exciting force. A symbolical solution of the equation corresponding to the vibro-acoustic movement described is definitely impossible, even if greatly simplifying hypotheses are adopted. It is possible to solve it with numerical methods (such as FEM, BEM, etc.) but even in this case‚Äîif acoustic-elastic coupling and internal dissipations of the membrane are taken into account‚Äîthe problem remains delicatem, and results must be verified experimentally. However, even in the absence of a solution, it is possible to note that decay of the partials is connected with the merit factor (Q) of their resonance, and provokes a widening of the spectral line‚Äîalways more marked the more the relative mode is damped. The internal frictions are proportional to the velocity of variation of the local curvature, which increases with the frequency. It can therefore be presumed that, similarly to stretched strings, damping of the modes increases with their frequency. Consequently, in the upper spectral areas, where the modes are close together and massed (see Figs. 9 & 10), the transfer function of the membrane is more continuous than discrete, with moderate peaks on the modal frequencies. In these areas the modes which can be excited are less precisely definable and depend on the loop gain and on the frequency characteristics of the negative feedback electronic circuit. Conversely, the passage from one mode to another of adjacent frequency has little influence on the resultant frequency. Construction of a future improved map for excitation of modes must therefore foresee a judicious choice of the pairs of points which offer the most significant discrimination between modes. In addition, the modal frequencies should be verified experimentally, since it can be presumed that the frequencies of some modes deviate from their nominal values owing to the presence of the actuator with relative wave guide which has a beam width equal to 1/3 of the membrane diameter. The measurement of these deviations cannot be determined reliably with theoretical considerations, since the overall model is too complex and can only be solved (as already shown) with numerical methods. Further Development The trials carried out to date with composers and percussionists stimulated suggestions for extending the control criteria, the use of special strikers of various forms and dimensions, and the application of independent hand techniques.ItaliaFestival Subsequent developments will principally concern ergonomic aspects, with the compilation of more precise nodal maps, of simpler and immediate use. In addition, improvements are quite conceivable in the electronic conditioning system and in its operation for the purpose of improving controllability of the emission of high overtones.YouTube See also * Planephones * Holophones References External links * CRM - Centro Ricerche Musicali * Biennale ArteScienza * Istituto Gramma Category:Drums Category:Membranophones ","title":"Feed-Drum"},{"id":"24029713","text":"Pavel Viktorovich Kudrin (; born 20 February 1983) is a former Russian professional football player.

His long-term objective, achieved after decades, was to obtain an official acknowledgment that County Clare, where his possessions were situated, was part of the province of Munster, to free it from the jurisdiction of the Connaught government under which it had been placed. Life Donnchadh (Donogh) mac Conchobhair √ì Briain, was the eldest son of Conor O'Brien, 3rd Earl of Thomond, and his second wife, Una, daughter of Turlough Mac-i-Brien- Ara.

In 1584 he was one of the commissioners who established the agreement that tanistry and the law of partible succession should be abolished in Connaught, and a tax of ten shillings a quarter be paid on land. Next year he attended the parliament held at Dublin in April. In 1589 he was active in subduing rebellious Irish in the mountains; and when Tyrone's rebellion broke out in 1595, he played a major part in its suppression. In command of a large force, he passed the River Erne in July and invaded Hugh Roe O'Donnell's country, but retreated in August when a truce was signed. In the following September he was detached by Sir William Russell, with five companies of foot and 145 horse, for the defence of Newry. In 1597 he served in Thomas Burgh, 5th Baron Borough's campaign, but early next year went to England, arriving in London on 19 January 1598; there he remained most of the year as a courtier.Pollard, xli, p. 313 Meanwhile, Tyrone's victory at the battle of Yellow Ford was followed by the spread of disaffection into Thomond's country. Teige O'Brien, Thomond's next brother, entered into communication with Tyrone's son, and joined the rebels. In 1599 O'Donnell invaded Clare, ravaging the country, capturing most of the castles, and making a prisoner of Thomond's youngest brother, Daniel O'Brien, afterwards first Viscount Clare, who had been left to defend it. Thomond returned from England, and after spending three months with his kinsman, the Earl of Ormonde, in collecting forces, he invaded Clare to revenge his brother's imprisonment and recover his possessions. He procured ordnance from Limerick, and laid siege to the castles that resisted, capturing them after a few days' fighting; at Dunbeg, which surrendered immediately, he hanged the garrison in couples on trees. The invaders were completely driven out of Clare and the neighbouring country, and the loyalists had their strongholds restored to them. During the rest of 1599 Thomond accompanied Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex on his progress through Munster, but left him at Dungarvan and returned to Limerick, being appointed governor of Clare on 15 August, and made a member of the privy council on 22 September. During 1600 Thomond was constantly occupied in the war. In April he was with Sir George Carew, and narrowly escaped capture with the Earl of Ormonde; he saved Carew's life and enabled them both to cut their way through their enemies, though Thomond was wounded.Pollard, xli, p. 313. Cites Stafford, Pacata Hibernia He was present at an encounter with Florence MacCarthy Reagh, and assisted at his submission in May. In June he was commanding in Clare and opposing O'Donnell's raids. He entertained the lord-deputy at Bunratty and marched out to oppose Tyrone's progress southwards, but no battle was fought, and Tyrone returned without having even seen an enemy. Next year, after holding an assize at Limerick in February, at which sixteen men were hanged, Thomond again went to England, probably with the object of obtaining the governorship of Connaught and of securing the union of Clare with Munster. He delayed there, then set out by Bristol, and, landing at Castlehaven on 11 November 1601, proceeded to Kinsale, where he took a prominent part in the siege. After the surrender of Kinsale he proceeded through Munster, established himself in Bere Island. He was in command at the siege of Dunboy, and hanged fifty-eight of the survivors. Until June 1602 Thomond was constantly with the army. He then again visited England, and, as a recompense for his services, his request for the transfer of Clare was granted, though the lord-deputy and privy council of Ireland were opposed to the measure. He returned in October. On 30 July 1604 he was appointed constable of Carlow, and on 6 May 1605 he became President of Munster. In 1613 he strongly upheld the Protestant party in opposition to the recusants in the disputes about the speaker of the Irish House of Commons; and on 17 May 1619 he was reappointed governor of Clare. He became one of the sureties for Florence MacCarthy Reagh, who had been imprisoned since his surrender in 1600, and who dedicated to Thomond his work on the antiquity and history of Ireland. He died on 5 September 1624, at Clonmel, and was buried in Limerick Cathedral, where a monument with inscription was erected to his memory.Pollard, xli, pp. 313, 314 Pollard concludes that he was one of the most influential and vigorous of the Irish loyalists; and, though his devotion and motives were sometimes suspected, Carew wrote that \\"his services hath proceeded out of a true nobleness of mind and from no great encouragement received\\" from the court.Pollard, xli, p. 314 Family He married, first, Ellen or Helen, daughter of Maurice Roche, 6th Viscount Fermoy, and Eleonor FitzGerald, who died in 1597; by her he had one daughter, married to Cormac, son and heir of Lord Muskerry. His second wife, who died on 12 January 1617, was Elizabeth, fourth daughter of Gerald FitzGerald, 11th Earl of Kildare and Mabel Brown; by her he had Henry O'Brien, 5th Earl of Thomond, and Barnabas O'Brien, 6th Earl of Thomond. Thomond's second brother, Teige, was long imprisoned in Limerick on account of his rebellion, but was released on protesting his loyalty; after another imprisonment he joined in O'Donnell's second invasion of Clare in 1599, and was killed during Thomond's pursuit of the rebels.

She was raised in Laguna Beach and Palos Verdes, California. She graduated from the University of Houston with an MFA and PhD. Her work has appeared in The Paris Review, Indiana Review,[1] Mid-American Review, Seneca Review,[2] and The Iowa Review. She lives in Houston, Texas.[3][4] Life Laurie Clements Lambeth was born in Newport Beach, and grew up in places like Laguna Beach, Santa Ynez, and Palos Verdes.http://indiebookfest.org/readings, She was diagnosed with relapsing- remitting multiple sclerosis at seventeen years of age. This event in her life influenced her to become a poet. Lambeth has shared her personal story on the National MS Society Website, where she discusses her disease and its influence on her poetry: \\"I was diagnosed at the age of 17, so MS has defined much of my adult life. I consider what goes on in my body an important factor of who I am; we are intricately linked, MS and me\\" . One of her symptoms from her disease is numbness. She explains that \\"living with numbness opened my perception of what is me and what is outside of me\\". Lambeth has said that she probably would not have pursued poetry without having been diagnosed with MS and experiencing the different symptoms that has opened her eyes to herself. She writes poetry that looks into the individual body's form within the context of the world. She went on to graduate with a BA from Loyola Marymount University, Los Angeles, California,as well as an MFA and PhD in creative writing at the University of Houston, where she was awarded the Michener Fellowship and Inprint Fellowship, in honor of Donald Barthelme.http://indiebookfest.org/readingshttps://www.amazon.com/Laurie- Clements-Lambeth/e/B001J8ZJI0 Lambeth has appeared in many journals during her career, such as The Paris Review, Indiana Review, Mid-American Review, Seneca Review,http://www.bgsu.edu/studentlife/organizations/midamericanreview/24-2.html and The Iowa Review.

As a writer with a disability her novel is described as being: \\"Concerned with physical experience, pain, and disability, Veil and Burn illuminates an intense desire to feel through the Other, embrace it, become it, and in the transformation, to understand the suffering body. In poems about animals, artifacts, and monsters, Lambeth displays a fascination for all bodies while exploring their pain, common fate, alienation, and abilities. Hovering between poem and prose fragment, between the self and fellow creatures, Laurie Clements Lambeth celebrates physical sensation, imbuing it with lyric shape, however broken, however imprisoned the shape may be.\\" Her poetry is very much involved with her disability and what it \\"celebrates\\".http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/28dpn8rk9780252032769.html Most of the reviews or descriptions of this book involve the progressive loss of vision. Lambeth, in an interview, also expresses how \\"the prose fragments explore vision loss and fear of blindness, something I felt was too melodramatic or maudlin for poetry, their positioning against the poems and their spar[s]eness are what I feel bring the book together through tension‚Äîwhat can and can‚Äôt be sung\\".http://firstbookinterviews.blogspot.com/2011/06/43-laurie-clements- lambeth.html Her view of a subject being \\"melodramatic\\" shows that Lambeth does not see her disability as something about which to be overly dramatic. Much of her work deals with the symptoms and sensations that MS has brought her. Veil and Burn is also supposed to be an unraveling of what MS does to her body's functioning. It \\"is not an ode to false hope, a cheery eyeing of her place in heaven, or a Spartan vow to overcome. It is a clear-eyed seeing of the worth of the material world\\".http://www.wordgathering.com/past_issues/issue7/book_review/lambeth.html Lambeth does not seem to be a poet who writes for a disability movement or create sympathy towards people with a disability and she does not try to play with the notion of being strong and overcoming the struggles that MS has brought her. An interesting thing to find out about her book is the reason why she named it the way she did. \\"The title Veil and Burn then speaks to these two modes‚Äîmore effusive poems and spare prose‚Äîand enlarges the concept of \\"Gauze Fragment,\\" which seeks representation of my vision loss in an old Hollywood trick: veiling the camera lens to soften wrinkles in close-up and burning the veil with a cigarette to let the actor's wet eyes sparkle through\\".http://firstbookinterviews.blogspot.com/2011/06/43-laurie-clements- lambeth.html This stands as a reassurance of her perhaps more positive perception of herself and MS as they coexist and her eyes are opened to the beauty and life that occurs with MS. * Beauty is a Verb: The New Poetry of Disability: In her opening poetics, \\"Reshaping the Outline,\\" in her section of the anthology, Beauty is a Verb: The New Poetry of Disability, Laurie Clements Lambeth describes a conversation she had with her doctor, in which her doctor informed her that writing was not going to make her MS better, to which she replied, \\"Oh, I‚Äôm perfectly aware of that. I‚Äôm under no illusions that anything at all will make me better.\\" She goes on to say of that experience, \\"I wanted to tell her that my writing and my disease have existed side by side from the moment I was diagnosed at seventeen, my new physical life giving birth to my life in words\\".Lambeth, Laurie Clements. \\"Reshaping the Outline.\\" Beauty is a Verb: The New Poetry of Disability. Ed. Jennifer Bartlett, Sheila Black, and Michael Northern. El Paso: Cinco Puntos Press, 2011. Print. 174-7 Lambeth explains that she has experienced a deepened sense of disability since she has been writing about it in her poetry. For her, this process sets something undesirable aside, so that she can \\"investigate it, sculpt it, and create something outside of my body that is vividly physical, in subject and in form\\".Lambeth, Laurie Clements. \\"Reshaping the Outline.\\" Beauty is a Verb: The New Poetry of Disability. Ed. Jennifer Bartlett, Sheila Black, and Michael Northern. El Paso: Cinco Puntos Press, 2011. Print. 174-7 One can see this in her poetry without being told. Her poetry embodies a movement and physicality that enlivens the subject matter and heightens the sense of disability that comes with MS. This is particularly true in her poems, \\"Hypoesthesia\\" and \\"Dysaesthesia,\\" which she put into this anthology because \\"these narrative lyrics attempt to describe lack of sensation (numbness), or the feeling of pain without source, dyseasthesia: ‚Äúwrong feeling\\"...the feeling in each is a sense of hesitancy, disruption in fluidity, reflective of the inability to share physical experience, even at our most intimate or domestic movements.\\"Lambeth, Laurie Clements. \\"Reshaping the Outline.\\" Beauty is a Verb: The New Poetry of Disability. Ed. Jennifer Bartlett, Sheila Black, and Michael Northern. El Paso: Cinco Puntos Press, 2011. Print. 174-7 These poems serve to describe her MS in a very physical form, allowing the reading to come close to an understanding of her disability. The movement of lines and the subject matter are compelling as insights into Lambeth‚Äôs life. However, perhaps, of the poetry Laurie Clements Lambeth includes in this anthology, nothing is more manifesting of her disability than the poetry that does not seem to manifest it at all, for example, \\"The Shaking.\\" Due to the fact that \\"The Shaking\\" is a carefully constructed villanelle describing the frustrations of her shaking, we are forced to see how she carefully manipulates her experiences to oppose the shaking she must come to terms with. There is a sense of catastrophe waiting behind the shaking that emotionally rips her from those she loves in the earthquake of her nervous system. She seem to be reminding herself that it seems worse than it is, and yet as it worsens, she wonders if she will have the strength to continue. As comfort fades into panic in the face of the future, containing the experience and eliminating the physical shaking from her poetry allows her to discuss it in an organized way, enforced by the complicated structure of the villanelle. As she deals with her \\"unfair\\" disease, it seems that the only thing really \\"strong enough to hold back its shaking\\" is the complicated structure of her contained poems that allow her to stop shaking long enough to come to terms with it.Lambeth, Laurie Clements. \\"Reshaping the Outline.\\" Beauty is a Verb: The New Poetry of Disability.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Lancaster, the archdeaconry of Lancaster and Morecambe, and the diocese of Blackburn. The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner described it as a \\"strange building\\" and \\"an anachronism, almost beyond belief\\". History St Paul's was designed by Edmund Sharpe, an architect who established a practice in Lancaster in 1835. In 1838 E. G. Paley joined him as a pupil. In 1845 he became a partner and Sharpe retired from the practice in 1851. He then pursued a career in railway engineering.O'Donoghue, F. M., rev. Geoffrey K. Brandwood, (2004) Sharpe, Edmund (1809‚Äì1877), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Retrieved on 18 August 2009 In 1874, when he was aged 68, he returned to architecture and designed this church which was opened in 1876. Sharpe lived in a house within of the church. The foundation stone was laid on 11 August 1874. The church was almost finished by the end of 1875, and it was consecrated on 18 February 1876 by Rt Revd James Fraser, Bishop of Manchester. In 1890‚Äì91 the west end of the church was extended by three bays, and transepts were added by Paley, Austin and Paley, the successors in Sharpe's former practice. This provided 150 more seats, and cost ¬£930. In 1932‚Äì33 Henry Paley (the practice then being titled Austin and Paley) replaced the chancel floor, altered the choir seats and carried out other minor work. Two parish histories have been written, the first by Wilfrid Wolfendale for the parish's centenary, and the second by Peter Gedge for the parish's 125th anniversary. Architecture Exterior The church is in a style which Sharpe described as late Transitional of about 1170, incorporating elements of both Romanesque and Gothic architecture. Pevsner points out that while the Romanesque style (which he calls Neo-Norman) was fashionable in the 1840s, it was out of fashion in the 1870s, when the usual style was Gothic Revival. The church is built in brick, faced on the outside with local gritstone, and with yellow terracotta dressings. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave with aisles, a clerestory and transepts at the western end. The chancel has one bay, over which is the tower. To the east of the chancel is an apsidal sanctuary and to the north is a vestry. The west fa√ßade has two lancet windows with a round window above. The bays are separated by buttresses, each bay containing two round-arched windows in the aisles and two round windows in the clerestory. The tower has two round-headed windows on the north and south sides in the lower stage. Above this is a tall bell chamber with two large arched openings on each face. The roof is hipped with steep gables on the east and west faces, each containing a vesica piscis opening. It is covered in lead. The apse has a half-conical roof; it is divided into three bays by buttresses, each bay containing a round-headed window. Interior The arcades consist of round columns with square capitals carrying round arches. They are clad with terracotta. The chancel has a quadripartite rib vaulted ceiling and blank arcading on the north and south walls. The ceiling of the apse is painted. The pews stretch between the arcades with no central aisle. The font is large and made from pink marble. The stained glass at the west end is by Barrowclough & Sanders, dates from about 1897, and depicts the Works of Mercy. Four windows in the north aisle date from the 1920s and are probably by Shrigley & Hunt. In the chancel are memorial brasses to Edmund Sharpe and his wife among others.

During this conference, the Istituto Superiore di Sanit√† (ISS) (Rome, Italy) presented guidelines for the production of scientific and technical reports documents included in the wider category of grey literature (GL) defined at the International Conferences on Grey Literature held in Luxembourg (1997) and in New York (2004) ‚Äì as ‚Äúinformation produced on all levels of government, academics, business and industry in electronic and print formats not controlled by commercial publishing i.e. where publishing is not the primary activity of the producing body‚Äù. The Italian initiative for the adoption of uniform requirements for the production of reports was discussed during a Round Table on Quality Assessment by a small group of GL producers, librarians and information professionals who agreed to collaborate in the revision of the guidelines proposed by ISS. The group approving these guidelines ‚Äì informally known as the ‚ÄúNancy Group‚Äù ‚Äì has been formally defined as the Grey Literature International Steering Committee (GLISC). The recommendations are adapted from the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals, produced by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) - better known as ‚ÄúVancouver Style‚Äù (updated February 2006, available from ICMJE Home and now adopted by more than 500 biomedical journals). These requirements also took into consideration the basic principles of ISO Standard Documentation entitled ‚ÄúPresentation of scientific and technical reports‚Äù (ISO 5966/1982) withdrawn in 2000. The ISO 5966 no longer met the requirements of ITC (Information Technology Communication), however, it still provides useful tips in the preparation of reports. The Guidelines are created primarily to help authors and GL producers in their mutual task of creating and distributing accurate, clear, easily accessible reports in different fields. The goal of the Guidelines is, in fact, to permit an independent and correct production of institutional reports in accordance with basic editorial principles. The Guidelines include ethical principles related to the process of evaluating, improving, and making reports available and the relationships between GL producers and authors. The latter sections address the more technical aspects of preparing and submitting reports. GLISC believes the entire document is relevant to the concerns of both authors and GL producers. The Guidelines are informally known as \\"Nancy style\\".  GLISC members  These are the institutions which officially adopted the \\"Nancy Style\\" in the production and distribution of grey literature. *Istituto Superiore di Sanit√† (ISS) ‚Äì Rome, Italy *Institut de l‚ÄôInformation Scientifique et Technique (INIST-CNRS) ‚Äì Nancy, France *Grey Literature Network Service (GreyNet), Amsterdam ‚Äì The Netherlands Many other institutions all over the world do support and use the GLISC guidelines without a formal agreement which would require longer procedures.  The GLISC Guidelines for the production of scientific and technical reports (also known as \\"Nancy style\\")  Authorship: The GLISC guidelines were prepared by Paola De Castro and Sandra Salinetti from the Istituto Superiore di Sanit√†, Rome (Italy). They were critically revised by Joachim Sch√∂pfel and Christiane Stock (INIST-CNRS, Nancy, France), Dominic Farace (GreyNet, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), Catherine Candea and Toby Green (OECD, Paris, France) and Keith G. Jeffery (CCLRC, Chilton Didcot, UK). The work was accompanied by Marcus A. Banks (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA), Stefania Biagioni (ISTI-CNR, Pisa, Italy), June Crowe (Information International Associates Inc., IIA, Oak Ridge, USA) and Markus Weber (Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, Berne, Switzerland). Structure: The guidelines are divided in five sections: # Statement of purpose # Ethical considerations (authorship, peer review, confidentiality‚Ä¶) # Publishing and editorial issues (copyright, institutional repositories, advertising‚Ä¶) # Report preparation (instructions to authors, report structure, revision editing‚Ä¶) # General information on the Guidelines The annex contains references and a list of institutions adopting the guidelines. Update: The first version 1.0 from March 2006 was updated in July 2007 (version 1.1). Translation: Version 1.1 was translated in French, German and Italian and Spanish. Availability: Version 1.1 and translations are available on the GLISC website. The total content of the Guidelines may be reproduced for educational, not-for-profit purposes without regard for copyright; the Committee encourages distribution of the material. The GLISC policy is for interested organizations to link to the official English language document at www.glisc.info. The GLISC does not endorse posting of the document on websites other than GLISC . The GLISC welcomes organizations to reprint or translate this document into languages other than English for no-profit purposes.  Comparison between ‚ÄúNancy style‚Äù and ANSI/NISO Z39.18  The ANSI/NISO Standard Z39.18-2005 Scientific and Technical Reports ‚Äì Preparation, Presentation, and Preservation (released in 2005) has been considered a valuable source for comparison. The major differences concerning the two documents as a whole regard: *Document type They are different in that the ‚ÄúNancy style‚Äù represents guidelines ‚Äì that is general principles agreed upon by a small group of experts, to be followed as an indication or outline of policy or conduct ‚Äì, while the ANSI/NISO Z39.18 is a proper standard, developed by the Standards Committees of the US National Information Standards Organization (NISO), subject to rigorous control and approval process including peer review. This is why also the structure of the two documents is different since the standard may repeat concepts in different sections which may be used separately, while the Guidelines are intended as an easy to read document giving the general idea for recommended items. The Guidelines, different from standards, do not give full details on format and style. Moreover, the ‚ÄúNancy style‚Äù represents international guidelines developed by a corporate author (GLISC), which worked on the draft proposed by the Istituto Superiore di Sanit√†, and signed approval of this best practice on behalf of their respective organizations, while the ANSI/NISO Z39.18 is a national standard approved by the American National Standards Institute through a number of Voting Members. *Paper vs digital document medium The ‚ÄúNancy style‚Äù is mostly paper oriented giving recommendations on report preparation mainly reflecting a traditional paper structure, while the organization pattern of the ANSI/NISO Z39.18 is user-based more than content-based. The key concepts incorporated in the American standard mainly refer to metadata, persistence of links, interoperability, creation, discovery/retrieval, presentation in digital format (DTD, XML, XSL), maintenance and preservation (original content, software and media); it also contains a metadata schema, which is absent in the Guidelines. *Annexes All material included in the ‚ÄúNancy style‚Äù is approved by the GLISC, while the ANSI/NISO Z39.18 provides a large amount of additional information (almost half of the pages) that is not part of the Standard (Appendices including selected annotated bibliography, glossary, Dublin Core data elements, etc.). *Content In general, the ‚ÄúNancy style‚Äù contains technical requirements for a report, but does not include full details (i.e. format, style, etc.); yet, it provides important elements, which are not present or not fully described in the ANSI/NISO Z39.18. *Ethical issues An initial section is explicitly devoted to authorship, editorship, peer review, conflicts of interest, privacy and confidentiality. *Instructions for authors Producers are strongly recommended to issue instructions to guide authors in the production of a formally correct document containing ethical and editorial issues as well as indications for formats, styles, illustrations, etc. *Revision Special attention is given to revision editing as GL is not generally peer reviewed, or produced with editorial support; therefore, it is fundamental that authors be aware of the importance of a careful revision of their texts before diffusion. *Reference style The adoption of the ‚ÄúVancouver style‚Äù is recommended and examples and rules are given as a fundamental step for information retrieval. As regards document structure, it is basically the same in ‚ÄúNancy style‚Äù and ANSI/NISO Z39.18, with minor terminological variations. Yet, the American standard explicitly gives indication on: ‚Äì Report Documentation Page (since it is used by some agencies within the federal government, and also some sample pages are given). ‚Äì Distribution list. ‚Äì Glossary (although not part of the Standard). ‚Äì Executive abstract. *Technical recommendations Since the ‚ÄúNancy style‚Äù represents guidelines and not a standard, all technical considerations are limited to the essential, while the ANSI/NISO Z39.18 gives indications (all absent in the ‚ÄúNancy style‚Äù) on: *Print-specific/non-print-specific recommendations The Section 6 ‚ÄúPresentation and display‚Äù describes standard methods for ensuring consistency in presentation including designing visual and tabular matter, formatting, etc. and makes a distinction between rules applicable to all reports regardless of mode of publication (paper or digital) and rules applicable to reports published in paper form only. *Format Specific information is provided on fonts, line length, margins, page numbering, style, units and numbers, formulas and equations, paper (format and type), printing equipment, ink. The ANSI/NISO Z39.18 also includes specifications on index entries and errata, which are not present in the ‚ÄúNancy style‚Äù.  Support, translation and updating of the \\"Nancy style\\"  Many institutions considered the relevance of the GLISC Guidelines for the production and distribution of technical reports and for educational purposed, therefore, accepted to carry out the translation of the original English version into different languases. Translations are available in: *Italian - translation carried out by the Istituto Superiore di Sanit√† . The ISS published a technical report on \\"Grey literature in scientific communication: ‚ÄúNancy style‚Äù to guarantee editorial quality of technical reports\\", including the translation of the GLISC guidelines Rapporti ISTISAN 06/55 *French - translation carried out by INIST - Institute for Scientific and Technical Information - France INIST - Institute for Scientific and Technical Information - France - Nancy Style *German translation carried out by Technischen Informationsbibliothek (TIB), Hannover - Germany *Spanish - translation carried out by Universidad de Salamanca - Spain The GLISC guidelines and the impact of grey literature on science communication were also appreciated by the European Association of Science Editors which included a chapter on grey literature in their Science Editor's Handbook. The use of GLISC guidelines is also supported by the European NECOBELAC Project Necobelac financed by the European Commission within the [7 Framework program], by the US National Library of Medicine Research Reporting Guidelines and Initiatives: By Organization, by the German National Library of Science and Technology TIB - Technische Informationsbibliothek: Reports / Germany and by the French Academic Agency of Francophony . Next steps for updating the GLISC Guidelines could be: *Adding an Appendix on metadata *Creating a Subject index *Providing more technical advice on digital format *Facilitating reference The Guidelines should be considered as a suggested model rather than a model in itself; they represent a basic step to improve quality in the different stages of GL production in view of its wider electronic circulation. The proposals for their updating will make them more effective, although a regular revision is required to keep pace with the changing ITC scenarios and information policies (see De Castro et al. 2006).  On the development of the GLISC guidelines  *Electronic grey literature The ‚ÄúNancy style‚Äù is mostly paper oriented, because editorial consistency and ethical considerations recommended for traditional documents do apply also to digital publications. Yet, progressively more and more GL is being produced, stored, published and made available electronically and in order to manage relevant GL publications, metadata are required. The importance of metadata, as the natural evolution of library catalogue records, had been already stressed in the first version of the ‚ÄúNancy style‚Äù (when dealing with report structure: Section 4.2 of the Guidelines), but no metadata schema was then provided since it was difficult to find a formula that would satisfy all requirements. At present, much GL is catalogued using the Dublin Core Metadata Standard (DC). However ‚Äì as Keith Jeffery of the UK Council for the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils (CCLRC) pointed out working on the ‚ÄúNancy style‚Äù draft ‚Äì this standard suffers from several problems: a) it is machine-readable but not machine- understandable; b) it does not have a formalised syntax or semantics and therefore is open to ambiguous interpretations. Therefore, he proposed a formalised metadata standard (an umbrella standard, mainly generated from Dublin Core metadata: ‚ÄúFormalised DC‚Äù based on the concepts of the CERIF Model (Error message (euroCRIS)). Yet, as the traditional cataloguing practice has different rules, similarly different communities may adopt different metadata schema. Nowadays the World Wide Web provides the possibility to search for information across heterogeneous archives/databases/catalogues, but the systems managing different information resources must be ‚Äúinteroperable‚Äù (capable to work together), and interoperability requires that the same metadata schema be used. As Stefania Biagioni (of the Italian Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell‚ÄôInformazione - ISTI, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche) clearly commented, there is much work towards standardization and the Dublin Core Initiative (DCMI: Home) is receiving worldwide consensus as it suggests adding a very simple metadata record to any specialized one. *Adoption strategy When consensus was to be reached to release the first version of the Guidelines, a formal approval was asked to all organizations wishing to officially adopt them. Contrary to expectations, consensus was given only by a small number of institutions as the official adoption was sometimes a difficult step. Yet, support and encouragement did not lack: a less formal approach in launching the Guidelines and getting them adopted was soon granted by all institutions involved in their creation. For example, a large international organization (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development - OECD), which took part in the development of the Guidelines, expressed concern to officially endorse them (and in fact, it did not), because that would require a great deal of internal debate and discussion with their own members. Suggestions were made to follow a voluntary system backed up by an official recognition of compliance to facilitate the adoption of the Guidelines. This would encourage like-minded supporters within an organisation to informally use the Guidelines and then gain the official ‚Äústamp of approval‚Äù to show that they are really following them. Actually, other organizations policies take a voluntary approach in the documents they recommend, such as the Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers (ALPSP) with more than 230 not-for-profit publishers. As suggested by the OECD, voluntary sign-up is a less demanding step for organisations to take, but the effect is the same ‚Äì more and more publishers will opt to use them.

It was an all-weather temporary field built by the United States Army Air Force XII Engineer Command using a graded earth compacted surface, with a prefabricated hessian (burlap) surfacing known as PHS. PHS was made of an asphalt-impregnated jute which was rolled out over the compacted surface over a square mesh track (SMT) grid of wire joined in 3-inch squares. Pierced Steel Planking was also used for parking areas, as well as for dispersal sites, when it was available. In addition, tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting. Once completed it was turned over for use by the Twelfth Air Force 47th Bombardment Group. The 47th first arrived at the airfield on 10 June 1944, flying A-20 Havoc aircraft. The group stayed briefly, moving to Ombrone Airfield on 27 June When the 47th pulled out, the airfield was dismantled and abandoned.

Like many Indonesians, he took only one name. Probosutedjo was one of seven children from his mother's second marriage, his father being Atmopawiro and his mother (also Suharto's mother) Sukirah. Like Suharto, he was born and raised in the small hamlet of Kemusuk to the west of the main town of Yogyakarta.Brief details are provided in R.E.

Probosutedjo's business activities flourished under Suharto's New Order government. He developed business opportunities in the forestry sector having founded the PT Menara Hutan Buana company to carry on forestry activities. During the period of the New Order government, he co-founded the Indonesian Indigenous Entrepreneurs Association (HIPPI), a move that reportedly drew the ire of president Suharto. In the 1980s, he was active in supporting the establishment of the Mercu Buana University in Indonesia with several campuses in various parts of Jakarta. During the 1970s, some of Probosutedjo's activities became the focus of corruption allegations. In 2003, he was tried and convicted for corruption and the loss of $10 million from the Indonesian state. He was sentenced to four years in jail. He later won a reduction of his sentence to two years, initiating a probe by the Indonesian Corruption Eradication Commission into the alleged scandal of the \\"judicial mafia\\" which uncovered offers of $600,000 to various judges. Probosutedjo confessed to the scheme in October 2005, leading to the arrest of his lawyers. His full four-year term was reinstated. After a brief standoff at a hospital, in which he was reportedly protected by a group of police officers, he was arrested on November 30, 2005. Like other members of the extended Suharto family, he remained a supporter of his brother's activities after Suharto's death in 2008.

Synopsis  Comic book artist Sophie (Zhang Ziyi) is a sweet and carefree girl brimming with creativity. She and her handsome surgeon boyfriend of two years, Jeff (So Ji- sub), are the perfect couple. After his marriage proposal to her in front of her family and all of her friends, Sophie is the happiest person in the world. One day, Jeff meets a famous movie star, Joanna (Fan Bingbing), during a surgical procedure. Immediately afterwards, he breaks up with Sophie. Devastated, Sophie takes to bed. She is unable to face anyone, especially her mother, who had been planning the wedding. Sophie decides to cover up the break-up, with only her two best friends, Lucy (Ruby Lin) and Lily (Yao Chen) knowing the truth. She comes up with a master plan: she will use the remaining two months before the wedding date to do whatever it takes to get Jeff back. She also plans to publish her many strategies in her new comic book. She wants to show women everywhere how to use a 'scientific' approach to win love back. Sophie's first strategy of \\"Generosity and Forgiveness\\" does not go well. At a Halloween party, hosted by Gordon (Peter Ho), a photographer, she drowns her sorrows in alcohol. She stumbles upon a photo of Gordon and Joanna together which immediately gives her the idea of forming an alliance with him, believing they were lovers. Gordon agrees to become Sophie's partner and her quest for revenge becomes a roller coaster of farcical twists and turns. Soon after a Christmas party at Gordon's place, Joanna reveals to Sophie that she has never lost Jeff at all and asked Gordon to keep an eye on her. It was then revealed that he and Joanna are actually siblings because he's been taking care of her since they were young. Feeling betrayed, Sophie gives up the notions of love and tells Gordon to leave her alone. Her mother then learns the truth and is finally able to convince her to give love another chance. Sophie calls off her relationship with Jeff and goes to visit Gordon, just to find he's gone and Joanna is there instead. Joanna tells her Gordon left for Europe, not even saying when he plans to come back. She also tells Sophie that Gordon's love for her is real. For two years she had no news from Gordon, so she decided to draw their story into a book with the intention of helping others discover their own inner-selves and true love. At the end Gordon, and Little San-hei, meet her again and both reveal they still have feelings for each other. Cast * Zhang Ziyi as Sophie () Late twenties. Comic Book artist.

Lanman Jr. Professor of Anthropology and International Affairs at Yale University where she serves as Chair of the Council on Middle East Studies. A specialist on Middle Eastern gender and health issues, Inhorn conducts research on the social impact of infertility and assisted reproductive technologies in Egypt, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates, and Arab America. Before joining the Yale faculty in 2008, Inhorn was a professor of medical anthropology at the University of Michigan and director of the Center for Middle Eastern and North African Studies. Inhorn served as president of the Society for Medical Anthropology of the American Anthropological Association.  Research   Egypt  Inhorn‚Äôs scholarship is firmly situated at the intersection of feminist science and technology studies (STS), Middle East gender studies (including masculinity studies), and the anthropology of reproduction. She was the first anthropologist to study infertility and assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) outside of the West, following the globalization of IVF to Egypt. Working in Egypt during the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, she was able to document the significant social, religious, kinship, and gender ramifications of infertility and its treatment, as well as the impact that IVF had on both the medical system and gender relations in the country. In the decade between 1993-2003, she published an ‚ÄúEgyptian trilogy‚Äù‚Äîthree books called Quest for Conception (1994), Infertility and Patriarchy (1996), and Local Babies, Global Science (2003). These books could be described, respectively, as a classic medical anthropological ethnography, a gender studies ethnography, and an STS ethnography of the globalization of IVF into the Muslim Middle East. Throughout these volumes, Inhorn charts Egyptian social and cultural understandings of infertility as a problem of personhood, marriage, kinship, and community life, while explaining how treatment options such as IVF are fundamentally shaped by local religious moralities. In the final book, based on research in Cairo‚Äôs IVF clinics, she argues that numerous ‚Äúarenas of constraint‚Äù‚Äîsocial, structural, ideological, and practical‚Äîlimit and sometimes curtail access to IVF, even among elite Egyptian couples who engage in transnational quests to create a ‚Äúbaby of the tubes.‚Äù These books have won several medical anthropology and feminist awards, including the American Anthropological Association‚Äôs Diana Forsythe Prize for outstanding feminist anthropological research on work, science, technology, and biomedicine, and the Society for Medical Anthropology‚Äôs Eileen Basker Memorial Prize for the most significant contribution to anthropological scholarship on gender and health.  Lebanon  Since 2003, Inhorn has undertaken three Middle Eastern research projects outside of Egypt. All have been funded by the National Science Foundation‚Äôs Cultural Anthropology and Science, Technology, and Society programs, as well as the U.S. Department of Education's Fulbright- Hays Faculty Research Abroad program. Her book, The New Arab Man: Emergent Masculinities, Technologies, and Islam in the Middle East (Princeton University Press, 2012), is the culmination of one of these projects, based in Lebanon, and strongly reflects her intellectual engagements in Middle East gender studies. Indeed, The New Arab Man is the first anthropological ethnography devoted to the exploration of Arab masculinity in the 21st century. It is also the only book focusing on male infertility and men‚Äôs uses of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), a variant of IVF designed to overcome this ‚Äúhidden‚Äù male reproductive health problem. In The New Arab Man, Inhorn interrogates Raewyn Connell‚Äôs theory of ‚Äúhegemonic masculinity,‚Äù suggesting that this concept, when applied to the Middle East, only serves to reinforce static dualisms and neo-Orientalist stereotypes. Inspired by the work of Raymond Williams, she offers a new concept of ‚Äúemergent masculinities‚Äù as a way to encapsulate change over the male life course, between generations, and throughout social history, as men enact transformative events such as the 2011 Arab uprisings. As Inhorn argues in this book, many Middle Eastern men today are engaged in a self-conscious critique of local gender norms, attempting to unseat forms of patriarchy in the process. These men, who perhaps represent the ‚Äúsilent majority,‚Äù share their hopes, dreams, and desires in the book, which is filled with ethnographic stories of men‚Äôs lives, often in conflict-ridden settings. The New Arab Man is, above all else, a humanizing account, based on in-depth research conducted with more than 300 Arab men, including Sunni and Shia Muslims, Christians, and Druze, from nearly a dozen Middle Eastern countries. The New Arab Man received the 2014 JMEWS Book Award from the Association of Middle East Women‚Äôs Studies. In 2015, it received the 2015 Robert B. Textor and Family Prize for Excellence in Anticipatory Anthropology, an award given annually by the American Anthropological Association.  United Arab Emirates  Middle East‚Äôs most ‚Äúglobal city‚Äù and a new medical tourism hub. Her book Cosmopolitan Conceptions: IVF Sojourns in Global Dubai (Duke University Press, 2015), explores the stories of infertile couples from fifty countries and five continents, all of whom have attempted to seek assisted conception in Dubai‚Äôs emergent IVF sector. The increasing global magnitude of travel to new cosmopolitan ‚Äúreprohubs‚Äù such as Dubai is a reflection of the fact that IVF services are either absent, inaccessible, illegal, expensive, or harmful in many of the world‚Äôs nations, particularly in the global South. As the first ethnographic study of so-called ‚Äúreproductive tourism,‚Äù Cosmopolitan Conceptions challenges this term as an inappropriate descriptor for couples‚Äô painful and tortuous IVF journeys across international borders. Instead, Cosmopolitan Conceptions adopts the term ‚Äúreprotravel‚Äù to represent these journeys‚Äîpart of a new conceptual ‚Äúreprolexicon‚Äù introduced in the book and inspired by recent developments in globalization theory. Cosmopolitan Conceptions ends with an activist agenda, arguing for alternative pathways to parenthood; support for the infertile, especially infertile women; and provision of safe, low-cost IVF services, particularly in the global South.  Arab America  Inhorn‚Äôs most recent book is America‚Äôs Arab Refugees: Vulnerability and Health on the Margins (Stanford University Press, 2018), based on a five-year ethnographic study carried out in ‚ÄúArab Detroit,‚Äù Michigan, the so-called ‚Äúcapital‚Äù of Arab America. Set against the backdrop of America‚Äôs stratified healthcare system and Detroit‚Äôs status as the poorest big city in America, America‚Äôs Arab Refugees provides the first in-depth analysis of the post-war health problems and struggles of infertile Arab refugees as they attempt to make new lives and new families in America. Forwarding the concept of ‚Äúreproductive exile,‚Äù Inhorn examines the ways in which Arab refugees, particularly from the country of Iraq, have been made infertile by the toxic legacies of American military intervention. Yet, after being forced to flee, they are exiled from America‚Äôs costly healthcare system by poverty and reproductive racism. The book also interrogates the widespread anti- Arab/anti-Muslim sentiment that has been felt in the United States since 9/11, but that has been significantly exacerbated by the contemporary political climate and imposition of the ‚ÄúMuslim ban.‚Äù To examine these new forms of racism, America‚Äôs Arab Refugees draws inspiration from intersectionality theory as developed by US Black feminist scholars. One chapter of the book compares the interlocking and multiplicative forms of discrimination faced by both Arab and Black populations living side by side on the margins of Detroit. America‚Äôs Arab Refugees thus represents the first attempt to apply intersectionality theory to the study of Arab lives in the US, showing that this theoretical approach has great utility in interrogating axes of oppression among marginalized immigrant and refugee communities. Ultimately, Inhorn‚Äôs book interrogates the health costs of war, the health inequities and structural vulnerabilities faced by Muslim refugees in this country, and the US government‚Äôs moral duty to assist those whose lives it has destroyed through its ongoing wars in the Middle East.  United States  Inhorn‚Äôs current scholarly project is based solely in the US, although she is collaborating with an anthropology colleague at the University of Haifa in Israel. This National Science Foundation-funded project, carried out from 2014 to 2016, focuses on oocyte cryopreservation (egg freezing), which is increasingly being used by women around the world to preserve their fertility. Experimentally developed for women facing medical conditions such as cancer, the technology has moved into IVF clinics since 2012, where it is being used by otherwise healthy women. Although most of the feminist and media commentary about egg freezing focuses on women‚Äôs career ambitions, in-depth interviews show a quite different story about women‚Äôs motivations and experiences. Inhorn‚Äôs ethnographic research with more than 150 women shows that egg freezing is largely about partnership problems, leaving highly educated women with fewer relationship options than men. These partnership problems reflect growing but little-discussed gender imbalances in higher education‚Äînot only in America, but in more than 75 other countries around the world, leading to an emerging ‚Äúglobal turn‚Äù to egg freezing. Inhorn‚Äôs study has been featured in multiple outlets, including NPR, CNN, The New York Times, The New Yorker, The Guardian, Jezebel, and the Huffington Post. As of 2020, Inhorn appears in Netflix‚Äôs newly released ‚ÄúExplained‚Äù feature on ‚ÄúFertility.‚Äù  Editorships  Inhorn is the founding editor of the Journal of Middle East Women‚Äôs Studies (JMEWS). She is also Co-Editor in Chief of Reproductive BioMedicine and Society, Associate editor for population and health of the journal Global Public Health, and Co-editor of the \\"Fertility, Reproduction, and Sexuality\\" series at Berghahn Books.

The creation of the OpenSIGLE archive was decided by some major European STI centres, members of the former European network EAGLE for the collection and dissemination of grey literature (European Association for Grey Literature Exploitation). OpenSIGLE was developed by the French INIST-CNRS, with assistance from the German FIZ Karlsruhe and the Dutch Grey Literature Network Service (GreyNet). OpenSIGLE is hosted on an INIST- CNRS server at Nancy. Part of the open Access movement, OpenSIGLE is referenced by the international Directory of Open Access Repositories.  History of OpenSIGLE  SIGLE (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) was a unique multidisciplinary bibliographic database dedicated to grey literature. Up to 15 European partners participated in SIGLE, mostly national libraries or important research libraries. Created in 1980 and produced from 1984 onwards by EAGLE (European Association for Grey Literature Exploitation), the database was last available through STN International and on CD-ROM via Silverplatter/Ovid Technologies, until it stopped input in 2005. Together with other former EAGLE members, INIST decided to make the data publicly available on an open access platform. The OpenSIGLE website went live in December 2007. OpenSIGLE is indexed by Google and Google Scholar, integrated in the portal of the WorldWideScience Alliance and included in the bookmarks of national libraries and research institutes.  Implementation of OpenSIGLE  OpenSIGLE was developed on a MIT DSpace platform 1.3.2. In the following the database migrated to DSpace version 1.4. It is available under the Creative Commons Attribution Non-commercial No Derivatives (CC-BY-NC-ND) License.  OpenSIGLE metadata  DSpace uses a qualified Dublin Core metadata set less detailed than the SIGLE metadata received from the former SIGLE operating agent DPC (FIZ Karlsruhe). The FIZ Karlsruhe XML records were written in the SIGLE format and completed by some server-related fields. Several specific fields from the source format were merged to one field for OpenSIGLE. For example in the SIGLE record the English title could be either in the field for the original title or in the field for the English title. In the OpenSIGLE metadata, the English title appears systematically in the field labelled \\"Title\\". Other fields were defined differently to fit with the metadata set. Some qualified fields were added to the metadata set used by DSpace without disturbing the OAI compliance: conference title, report number and availability statement. The most significant change was a simplification in the document type information. The original SIGLE format distinguished between document type and literature indicator, but diverging conversion practices led to inconsistencies. OpenSIGLE proposes a simplified list of the principal document types. Greynet document types  OpenSIGLE content  DSpace allows organizing the contents of a repository according to communities and collections. INIST decided to use 2 types of communities: the member countries and SIGLE subject categories on their primary level. Each country or subject category holds a collection of records. Some minor and less used subject categories were regrouped in one collection. In a mass upload on DSpace each record (or item) can be \\"attributed\\" to only one community or collection. We decided to choose the first classification code of each record. Since the files of each member country are treated separately, it is possible to declare also the country community for each record. Contrary to the CD-ROM version, the document type is no longer searchable in OpenSIGLE. We found it interesting to display the information in the list of results, along with the title, the authors and the publication date. This is not a feature of the basic version of DSpace, but we observed similar practices in other repositories (see ERA 2006 and Glasgow 2006). The SIGLE classification scheme with its 246 subject sub-categories can be searched through the subject field, either by its code or its wording. A specific help page accessible at any moment lists the complete classification schemes with both the codes and their description. As mentioned above, the subject areas were reduced to 15 entries for the organization of the database in collections and for browsing purposes. For OpenSIGLE INIST chose the latest stable version available of the software which was then DSpace 1.3.2. One of the new features in this version is the support of multilingualism of the user interface (cf. DSpace system documentation 2006). This feature has been developed a bit further by a LIS student and OpenSIGLE can now be used with interfaces in English (the main version), French, German and Italian. These are the four most representative languages in the database. The help pages and the \\"About\\" information are available in English and French only, since they must be translated specifically. Document delivery being very important for the SIGLE database, INIST decided to add an order form to facilitate contact with the holder of the document (former EAGLE member) and the information about the document‚Äôs availability in each record. In addition INIST gives updated information for each participating centre on each of the \\"Countries\\" pages.  OpenSIGLE functionalities and perspectives  With the migration to the DSpace platform look and presentation of the former SIGLE records have changed. Some data like the language or the document type are no longer searchable, but are still displayed, even in the list of results. The principal characteristics of the SIGLE database have been preserved or even improved. Access to the full text will be facilitated through an order form for document delivery and for some records hopefully through links to the electronic version in the future. Since the records are organized in collections based on the subject categories, and the OAI protocol for metadata harvesting considers collections as sets, a selective harvesting by subject will be possible. More generally, OpenSIGLE seems to be the first migration of an important traditional bibliographic database into an OAI (Open Archives Initiative) compliant environment. Some factors facilitated this migration, e.g. the mapping of the metadata from a verpeny detailed format to a simpler one. The whole project benefited largely from INIST-CNRS previous experience with DSpace and in particular from knowledge about the import of records. Still OpenSIGLE provided INIST-CNRS with a new experience concerning mass uploads on an Open Source platform. Perspectives for the future developments of the OpenSIGLE archive are: *Uploading the French data from 2005 onwards and thus closing the gap between the SIGLE and OpenSIGLE records. *Integrating links to the full text whenever it exists. Even if the new repository contains only bibliographic records, links from the OpenSIGLE metadata to the electronic full text where available are technically possible but have to be provided by the former EAGLE members. *Inclusion of the Dutch SIGLE records. Those of the former EAGLE members who didn‚Äôt sign the declaration of intention yet may reconsider their position and agree to the import of ‚Äútheir‚Äù national SIGLE input into the new database. *Inclusion of current records from other countries. *Integrating OpenSIGLE into other networks and portals. Linking the OpenSIGLE records to scientific or general search engines will largely enhance the visibility of the European grey documents of the last 20 years. At the 12th International Conference on Grey Literature at Prague GL12 in December 2010, INIST-CNRS presented a new project called OpenGrey.OpenGrey OpenGrey signifies a new website with OAI- PMH, improved research facilities and export of records. OpenGrey also includes recent records and links to the full text. At the Prague conference, INIST and GreyNet called former SIGLE members and new partners to contribute to OpenGrey. In 2011 OpenSIGLE changed its platform and its name. OpenGrey provides new features and new content  OpenSIGLE and GreyNet  For the past 15 years, GreyNet has sought to serve researchers and authors in the field of grey literature. To further this end, GreyNet has signed on to the OpenSIGLE repository and in so doing seeks to preserve and make openly available research results originating in the International Conference Series on Grey Literature. GreyNet together with INIST-CNRS have designed the format for a metadata record, which encompasses standardized PDF attachments of the full- text conference preprints, PowerPoint presentations, abstracts and biographical notes. In 2010, OpenSIGLE provides open access to some 200 conference papers on grey literature, from 1995 to 2009. Twenty-one, full-text papers from the Second International Conference on Grey Literature held in Washington D.C. on November 2‚Äì3, 1995 were added in March 2010. GreyNet purchased permission last year from Emerald to make openly accessible the papers published in the GL Conference Proceedings from 1994 to 2000. These earlier collections are added to the more recent collections in the OpenSIGLE Repository. The work involved relies on the efforts of INIST-CNRS as service provider and GreyNet as data provider. By autumn 2010, it is anticipated that all of the papers in the International Conference Series on Grey Literature will be fully accessible via the OpenSIGLE Repository. OpenSIGLE participates in the WorldWideScience global science gateway.

The bridge was originally built in 1925, and was doubled in 1964, as part of the same project as Galipeault Bridge, which links the island to Montreal Island, but it has been maintained independently since then. Both bridges carry four lanes of Quebec Autoroute 20, which becomes Harwood Boulevard on the Dorion side. However, Transports Qu√©bec plans to build a bypass between the bridge and the junction of Autoroute 540 and upgrade the highway on √éle Perrot to freeway standards. The upgrade is slated to be completed by 2019. The bridge also carries a bicycle path, and is part of Route Verte 5. The widening of this bridge and Galipeault Bridge in 1964, both of them from two lanes to four, was done in a bid to appease Perrot Island residents and merchants, who were worried that the construction of nearby √éle aux Tourtes Bridge, which provides a way around the island, would hurt their businesses. A medium-size shopping mall, Le Faubourg de l'√éle, was built next to the bridge on the Pincourt side, at the Cardinal L√©ger exit. Like Galipeault Bridge, which it continues, Taschereau Bridge was built next to a Grand Trunk Railroad bridge that was built in 1854, and was the first fixed link between Montreal and the mainland. The bridge was named after Louis- Alexandre Taschereau, who was Premier of Quebec at the time of its inauguration.

The estate produces both red and white wines. History The oldest archaeological finds at the Gobelsburg site date back some 4,000 years, and a castle of this name is mentioned in 1178. The Renaissance structure underlying the present face of the castle was renovated in baroque style in 1725. Having belonged to various aristocratic families, castle and grounds were sold to the Cistercian monks of Zwettl Abbey in 1740 and have been in its possession ever since. http://www.gobelsburg.com/winery/history.html In 1996, the present managers, Eva and Michael Moosbrugger, took responsibility of the building and the winery, which is directed by Michael Moosbrugger. Estate Wine production at the castle dates back several centuries. After the taking over in 1996, Michael Moosbrugger (who was initially supported by wine producer Willi Br√ºndlmayer) began reforming vineyard work and vinification according to strict quality standards. Of the 39 hectares under vines around the Kamptal village of Langenlois, Gobelsburg‚Äôs premium vineyards are the rocky, terraced Z√∂binger Heiligenstein and Grub, mostly for Riesling, as well as the lower- lying Lamm and Gaisberg vineyards, whose sand and loess soils are mainly planted with Gr√ºner Veltliner. The Gr√ºner Veltliner varietal makes up 50% of total production, followed by Riesling (25%), St. Laurent (8%), Zweigelt and Pinot noir (both 6%), and Merlot (5%). http://www.weinausoesterreich.at/winzersuche/display.php?ID=35505 Vineyard work is done exclusively by hand and mostly follows organic practice. A considerable proportion of Gobelsburg wines is exported. Winemaking Quality Gr√ºner Veltliner 2015 vintage. Gobelsburg winemaking emphasizes traditional varietals and terroir expression. Oak casks are used sparingly and only for top Gr√ºner Velliner and red wines, otherwise large barrels or steel tanks are used for vinification. Mostly natural yeasts are used for fermentation, and yeast contact is preferred for some premium wines. The Tradition line of wines is using methods drawn from historical winemaking practice.

The surgery may be elective, or needed as the result of prior surgery on the face. Each involves placing synthetic materials deep under the subcutaneous tissue and onto the underlying bone. A maxillofacial or plastic surgeon uses them to aesthetically improve facial contours, proportion and correct imbalances caused by injury or hereditary traits. However, in cases that require orthognathic osteotomies, those should be done before any implants are considered. In most cases, facial implant surgery is completed on an outpatient basis in a hospital, a surgeon's office or a surgical center. A local anesthesia or oral sedative may be used, or the patient may be put to sleep during the procedure using general anesthesia. The most commonly used implants are: *Chin implant ‚Äì These can be used to increase anterior, lateral and downward projection of the chin. The implant is placed internally through the lower lip, or externally under the chin.

Held at The Den in Teignmouth, Devon, the town in which the band's members spent their childhoods and began their musical careers, the homecoming concerts were the band's first shows in the town for 15 years. It is believed that the name 'Seaside Rendezvous' was taken from the Queen song of the same name (Queen being a major influence on the band). Background The planning of two Teignmouth concerts was first revealed by locals newspapers the Teignmouth Post and Herald Express on 7 and 8 August 2009. It was rumoured that the concert's promoters, SJM Concerts Ltd., had applied to Teignbridge District Council for permission to hold the concerts at The Den, though it was recognised that there were concerns. With the dates planned as 4 and 5 September 2009, support for the shows quickly increased and spread across the country. A band spokesperson was quoted as describing the band as \\"very keen\\" to complete the gigs, with locals describing it as \\"an iconic event.\\" A council meeting was held on the morning of 17 August in Newton Abbot to decide whether the shows would go ahead. Muse bassist Christopher Wolstenholme attended the meeting and urged fans to show their support. On 17 August, the two concerts were confirmed after the meeting council allowed so. Wolstenholme told the Herald Express's reporter Emma Pearcy after the meeting \\"I am chuffed to bits the application has been granted. What I have been really surprised by is how much support we have been getting, from a huge range of people. Obviously we will do what we can to make sure complaints are kept to a minimum.\\" The bassist added that \\"It is something we have wanted to do for a long time. It is not a money making exercise. We want to give something back to the community.\\" BBC Radio 1 presenter Zane Lowe aired highlights from the Saturday 5 September performance on his radio show on 7 September 2009. The stage at The Den before the second show of the weekend. \\"A Seaside Rendezvous\\" was confirmed on Muse's official website on 18 August, along with ticket and travel information; general sale opens on 21 August, with a fans' pre-sale on 19 August. The concerts were approved on the basis that \\"a maximum noise level of 84.1dB(A)\\" be produced. Despite tickets going on sale from 19 August, the shows still have to be approved by the landowner of The Den. In an interview with American radio station 107.7 The End shortly after gaining approval for the concerts, lead vocalist, guitarist and pianist Matthew Bellamy, speaking from Teignmouth, revealed that they had to overcome a lot of problems with the organisation of the shows, including having to negotiate with the local police force and fire brigade. In an interview with music website Drowned in Sound, drummer Dominic Howard explained that \\"Playing in Teignmouth is going to be amazing, we're all really looking forward to it,\\" adding \\"It's honestly something we've always wanted to do since the day that I met Matt [Bellamy] at The Den. It's not a park, it's just like a big piece of grass. That's where I met Matt for the first time. I remember even in those early days talking to Matt and saying things like 'wouldn't [sic] be great to play a proper gig on here with shitloads of people!\\" Howard also revealed that support acts would be local bands, including Hey Molly, with whom bassist Wolstenholme is \\"quite friendly,\\" The Quails and \\"two more local bands.\\" The concerts drew up to 15,000 fans to Teignmouth each night of that weekend and were said to have \\"given [Teignmouth's] economy a much welcomed boost,\\" with all available accommodation being booked in addition to the numerous merchandise and food and drink facilities made available. On 11 and 12 September 2009, BBC Three broadcast a documentary about the event and the band's childhood life, growing up in Teignmouth. Reception The concerts in Teignmouth were largely well- received, with English newspapers The Guardian, The Daily Telegraph, The Times and The Independent all awarding the shows at least four out of a maximum five rating stars. The Guardian praised the performances as reaffirming the Teignmouth-held \\"intoxicating truth\\" that Muse \\"are now so ridiculous that they have become sublime.\\" Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph described the shows as \\"a triumphant open-air concert,\\" while The Times spoke highly of the band's tribute to their hometown and the first performances of material from The Resistance. The Independent's Chris Mugan was similarly positive, explaining how \\"in performance [...] Muse emerge as one of [Britain's] most uninhibited bands.\\" Set list ;First show Main set: Encore: ;Second show Main set: Encore: Personnel *Matthew Bellamy - lead vocals; guitar; piano on \\"New Born\\", \\"United States of Eurasia\\", \\"Cave\\" and \\"Feeling Good\\"; keytar on \\"Undisclosed Desires\\" *Christopher Wolstenholme - bass, backing vocals, headless bass on \\"Uprising\\" and \\"Unnatural Selection\\", harmonica on \\"Man With a Harmonica\\" *Dominic Howard - drums, backing vocals on \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" *Morgan Nicholls - keyboards, synthesizers, backing vocals, percussion, brief guitar on \\"United States of Eurasia\\".

It is signposted as route 3, and this section is a two-lane road with at-grade intersections. The Tornyosn√©meti-Miskolc section is concurrent with the European route E79. At Miskolc, the E71 switches to the M30 motorway which takes it to Em≈ëd, where the E71 switches to the M3 motorway and turns west towards Budapest. The M3 carries the E71 route to G√∂d√∂ll≈ë, where the E71 switches to the M31 motorway. The M31 in turn takes the E71 to the Budapest ring motorway signposted as M0 motorway, where the E71 is concurrent with the European routes E60 and E75. The M0 motorway carries the E71 (along with the E60 and E75) around Budapest to its western outskirts. The final leg of the E71 route in Hungary is the M7 motorway between √ârd just to the west of Budapest, via Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r and Nagykanizsa to the Letenye border crossing to Croatia. South of Nagykanizsa, the E71 is concurrent with the European route E65. The Hungarian section of the E71 is long. E71 as Croatian D1 state road, near Knin The E71 route through Croatia starts at the Zrinski Bridge and the Goriƒçan border crossing at the northern terminus of the A4 motorway near ƒåakovec and reaches Ivanja Reka interchange where it defaults to the westbound A3 motorway and proceeds to Luƒçko interchange, where the E71 switches to the A1 motorway. In that area the E71 reaches Zagreb and connects to the city through a number of interchanges along the Zagreb bypass. Along the three motorways, the E71 is concurrent with the E65, and in the A3 motorway section of the E71, the route is also concurrent with the European route E70. The E71 route diverges from the A1 motorway at Karlovac interchange and switches to the D1 state road passing through Karlovac towards Plitvice Lakes, switches to the D217 and reaches Liƒçko Petrovo Selo/Izaƒçiƒá border crossing to Bosnia and Herzegovina. It further specifies that the E71 runs through Bihaƒá, Bosnia and Herzegovina and back to Croatian border, passing via U≈æljebiƒá border crossing and D218 state road to Otriƒá, where the E71 rejoins the D1 state road running to Split via Podi interchange with the A1 motorway. All the Croatian state road sections of the E71 and the E71 sections in Bosnia and Herzegovina consist of two-lane roads with at-grade intersections except for the northernmost section of the D1/E71 concurrency running through Karlovac, and the final of the D1/E71 concurrency between the Podi interchange (A1 motorway) and Split, both of which are executed as expressways. Southbound E71 traffic reaching Split defaults to the D8 state road. As of August 2011, Hrvatske autoceste and Autocesta Rijeka - Zagreb operators of the A1 motorway signposted the A1 south of Karlovac as the E71 all the way south to the Dugopolje interchange connecting to the Podi interchange of the D1, contrary to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) specification of the route. This is also observed on roads connecting to the A1 between Karlovac and Dugopolje, as well as on large proportion of maps and major route planning software. The E71 route through Croatia, conforming to the UNECE specification, is long, and the section in Bosnia and Herzegovina is long.  Toll  Luƒçko interchange, carrying the E71 near Zagreb Various sections of the E71 are tolled, using a range of toll collection systems. Motorways in Hungary are tolled using an electronic toll collection (ETC) system with charges differing for various categories of vehicles and length of period when the e-vignette is valid. A notable exception is the M0 motorway of which some sections are not tolled. Croatian motorways are also generally tolled, using a ticket system. All sections of the A1 motorway are tolled, but those A4 sections south of Sveta Helena interchange and the A3 sections concurrent with the E71 are not tolled as they are a part of the Zagreb bypass. As of August 2011, the toll charged along the Croatian section of the E71 route between various toll plazas at each motorway exit and two mainline toll plazas, varies depending on the length of route travelled and the vehicle classification in Croatia. The toll is payable in either Croatian kuna or euros and by major credit and debit cards. A prepaid ETC system is also used.  History  E71 as M3 motorway near Bag, Hungary UNECE was formed in 1947, and their first major act to improve transportation was a joint UN declaration no. 1264, the Declaration on the Construction of Main International Traffic Arteries, signed in Geneva on September 16, 1950, which defined the first E-road network. This declaration was amended several times before November 15, 1975, when it was replaced by the European Agreement on Main International Traffic Arteries or \\"AGR\\", which set up a route numbering system and improved standards for roads in the list. The AGR went through several changes, with the last one, as of 2011, in 2008. Reorganization of the E-roads network of 1975 and 1983 redefined the E71 designation previously associated with Hanover-Bremen- Bremerhaven road and assigned it to Ko≈°ice-Budapest-Zagreb route. The same documents assigned the Zagreb-Bihaƒá-Split section to the E59, as the E71 terminated in Zagreb at the time, however, the most recent revision of the E-network truncated the E59 in Zagreb, and transferred its former southern leg to the E71, extending the E71 considerably. Since the E71 route was first defined between Ko≈°ice and Zagreb, efforts were made to improve the roads connecting the two cities to Budapest. In the 1970s, Hungary started construction of the M7 as its first motorway, and Zagreb-Karlovac section of the A1 motorway was completed in Croatia (within Yugoslavia at the time), representing the first sections of the present-day E71 to become a modern road traffic route, and the first modern motorways in Hungary and Croatia respectively. Subsequently, the two motorways, as well as other along the route in Croatia and Hungary, were gradually extended towards national borders, as well as to bypass capitals of the two nations--Budapest and Zagreb. Croatian and Hungarian motorways spanning the E71 route linked up in 2008.  Planned development  Currently, the E71 section in Slovakia now signposted as the route 68 is being upgraded to an expressway already designated as R4 expressway, while the Hungarian M30 motorway was scheduled to be extended north to the Slovak border. As of August 2011, the R4 expressway was scheduled to be completed by February 2013. As of August 2011, the Croatian section of the E71 south of Karlovac is not planned to be upgraded substantially as there already is the A1 motorway running parallel to the designated E71 route via Zadar rather than Bihaƒá. The A1 section is even physically signposted as the E71. Likewise, there are no plans to perform any upgrades to the E71 in Bosnia and Herzegovina in existence as of 2011. Still, there are proposals to upgrade the route, possibly connecting Bihaƒá to Zagreb via Sisak rather than Karlovac, made from time to time in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Croatia. The E71 route, especially its Budapest-Zagreb- Karlovac section was given further importance in June 1997 at the Pan-European Transport Conference in Helsinki, when the section was made a part of the Pan- European Corridor Vb, spanning Budapest and Rijeka via Zagreb.

It was written by Clement and Ian La Frenais. The story is based on the 1969 novel Catch Me a Spy by George Marton and Tibor M√©ray. It was a co-production between Britain, the United States and France, which was filmed in Bucharest, Romania. It was also part filmed on Loch Awe and Loch Etive, Scotland, where the gunboat scenes were filmed, and featured Kirk Douglas running through a herd of Highland cattle which were owned by David Fellowes. It was also released as Catch Me a Spy and Keep Your Fingers Crossed. Synopsis Fabienne, a young French-born British schoolteacher marries and heads to Bucharest in the Eastern Bloc for their honeymoon. Her husband is arrested by secret police and soon turns out to have been detained by Soviet intelligence as a spy. She intends to head to Moscow to try and help him, but instead is drugged and sent on a plane back to England by a seemingly suspicious waiter. Back in London she lobbies her uncle, the shadow Shadow Foreign Secretary and his friend the head of British Intelligence, to help get her husband back. He explains that they have deliberately arrested her husband in order to have a bargaining chip to exchange for a top Soviet agent who has recently been unmasked by the British. Unbeknownst to Fabienne her husband, a corrupt businessmen, is in league with the Soviet intelligence and has married her on their instructions. The exchange in Germany goes wrong, however, when during the handover the Soviet spy - laden down with capitalist consumer goods from the West - sinks through the ice and drowns. As the British now have nobody to exchange for her husband, Fabienne sets out to capture an enemy agent on her own initiative. She manages to trap a man in a trench coat who has been following her all day, only for him to prove to be an incompetent British agent ordered to trail her for her own security by his chiefs. When Andrej the Bucharest waiter remerges, having been caught rummaging through her room and demanding she hand over a microfilm that he inserted into her luggage when he had her drugged in Bucharest, she decides he will be the ideal person to exchange. However, before she can take action they both end up being abducted by enemy agents, only escaping in the Scottish countryside. He reveals to her that he is not really a spy, but he makes money smuggling manuscripts of books by Soviet dissidents to the West.

The school football match was shot at Vincent Square.James p.99 The film's sets were designed by the art director Carmen Dillon. It was made as a co-production between several companies including Kirk Douglas's own Bryna Productions. The \\"gunboats\\" in the movie were:- Lalage, a 70 ft WW2 Fairmile harbor defense launch, the East German boat, and the Calshot Salar, a 60 ft WW2 Royal Air Force \\"three leg\\" pinnace, the British boat. Lalage was owned and operated by Captain Jack Glover of Dumbarton, who in addition was an extra in the movie, as was his brother Hans Glover. Tragically, Captain Glover drowned in 1982 while undertaking a boat salvage operation in the river Leven. Lalage eventually foundered off the Little Cubrae island after striking rocks during a severe storm and became a total loss.https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/local-lifestyle/memory-lane-star- spotting-dumbarton-9670925 Calshot Salar, was owned by Dr W.\\"bill\\" Souter and operated during filming by a Canadian, Captain Robin Blair Crawford, who also had a position as an extra in the movie and in addition was the lead safety diver at Loch Etive. At the insistence of her owner Calshot Salar had her original RAF number painted on the hull for the movie. After numerous adventures in both home and overseas waters Calshot Salar was sold and eventually became a houseboat at Shoreham.http://www.bmpt.co.uk/calshot- salar_topic840.html Critical reception TV Guide wrote the film \\"features a good cast, an exciting speedboat chase, a few chuckles, and every spy cliche in the book\\"; and Radio Times noted \\"a sometimes clever and witty script by the ace TV team of Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. However, it's rather let down by Clement's uncertain direction. Another problem is that, as a Bucharest waiter who is actually a spy, Kirk Douglas's peculiar intensity isn't best suited to a comedy. Trevor Howard and Tom Courtenay seem more at home with the spy spoof material.\\" See also * List of American films of 1971 References Bibliography * Simon James. London Film Location Guide.

The railway connects G√ºnzburg and Mindelheim via Krumbach and so the Ulm‚ÄìAugsburg railway (Munich-Augsburg-Ulm- Stuttgart) and the railway from Munich to Zurich via Buchloe, Memmingen and Lindau.  History  The G√ºnzburg‚ÄìKrumbach section was opened in 1892 and it was followed by the Mindelheim‚ÄìPfaffhausen section as part of the Mindelheim‚ÄìKirchheim railway in 1909. The gap from Krumbach to Pfaffhausen was closed in 1910. The section to Kirchheim has since been closed. The line between Gunzburg and Mindelheim has been threatened with closure several times, but it has always been averted. Between 1963 and 1998, a major reason for the preservation of the railway was that the southern section between Breitenbrunn and Mindelheim was used for the transport of oil by rail in tankers from the Bedernau oil field. General freight was closed in 1997. Passenger traffic is currently not threatened with closure, because the track has been modernised, reducing travel times and improving access to the main lines in G√ºnzburg and Mindelheim. A total of six railcars of Class 642 of DB Regio Allg√§u-Schwaben have operated on the line from Augsburg since October 2001. Since December 2002, there trains have been accelerated and additional services have been added, sometimes running to Ulm and Memmingen. The Central Swabian Railway is equipped with a new form of signalling used on branch lines called Signalisierter Zugleitbetrieb (SZB). Crossing stations are in Ichenhausen, Krumbach and Pfaffhausen, movements are controlled by the signalman in Mindelheim. The trains are parked overnight at Krumbach (Schwab) station. To speed up the operation, all stations except Gunzburg, Ichenhausen, Krumbach (Schwab), Krumbach (Schw) Schule, Pfaffhausen and Mindelheim have been converted to request stops.

One of the most recognizable contributors to these fields during Romania's communist period, she created popular children's comics such as Mac and Cocofifi, before signing as one of the main illustrators for Editura Ion CreangƒÉ publishing house. She subsequently produced illustrations for many of the company's principal releases, including an edition of Ion CreangƒÉ's Childhood Memories and the first Romanian-language edition of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit. A member of the Hungarian-Romanian community, Rusz escaped communist political pressures by settling in Budapest, Hungary in 1987. She continued to live there, and has also become recognized as a contributor to the Hungarian comics school. Biography Born in Cluj (Kolozsv√°r), L√≠via Rusz was from a Hungarian- Romanian family. \\"Pro-Eminen≈£e. L√≠via Rusz: Prezentare\\", in Pro-Scris webzine, Nr. 2/2004; retrieved August 18, 2009 Gy√∂rgy Gy√∂rfi-De√°k, \\"Cu ochii copiilor, pentru bucuria lor\\" , in Caiete Silvane , June 2009 She grew up in a mixed environment, among local Hungarians and Romanians, and, according to her own recollection: \\"My road was opened by a school with exceptional spirituality, where I was taught to respect and maintain traditions, to treasure the eternal cultural values, to preserve and take care of our identity so as not to offend the others\\". Her father, Liviu, was a Romanian Railways employee, amateur artist and calligrapher, who had undergone formal training with painter S√°ndor Szopos. Rusz was herself avid to train in visual art, copying his paintings, learning how to use watercolors, and entering a class run by Szopos. After graduating from primary school, Rusz continued her education at a high school in her native city, where her talents brought her to the attention of painter and academic Zolt√°n Kov√°cs. On Kov√°cs' personal recommendation, she applied for the Cluj Art Institute upon passing her baccalaureate examination, and completed her training in 1955. She declared herself \\"lucky\\" to have been taught by Kov√°cs, \\"an artist with virtues recognized even by those who undermined him\\". As a result of this training and influence, she came to define herself as a \\"conservative\\", who did not \\"renew [herself] whenever the fashion changes.\\" Rusz was Assistant at the Institute for the following three years, losing her post to an administrative restructuring. At that stage in her life, L√≠via Rusz began collaborating with specialized magazines for children. With time, her work in the comics genre came to be influenced by Jean C√©zard, French creator of Arthur le fant√¥me justicier for Pif gadget, and one of the few foreign cartoonists to be known in Romania.\\"Livia Rusz (b. 28/9/1930, Romania)\\", entry in Lambiek's Comiclopedia; retrieved August 18, 2009 The first local publication to employ Rusz was the Hungarian-language Napsug√°r, where she first met writer S√°ndor Fodor, with whom she collaborated on the cycle of books Csipike (known as Piticul Cipi in Romanian). This contribution brought her to the attention of Lucia Olteanu, editor of Lumini≈£a, a Bucharest-based and Romanian-language periodical. Rusz accepted the offer of collaboration, and, with Olteanu, created the comic strips RƒÉ≈£oiul Mac (\\"Mac the Duck\\"; Hungarian: M√°kvir√°g) and Cocofifi (or Kok√≥). These earned Rusz a large following among the young public, and she also began collaborating with the youth journals Arici Pogonici and CutezƒÉtorii. Her other projects in comics included a rendition of L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, as well as the comic strips Maimu≈£a Kio (\\"Kio the Monkey\\", with a text by Ovidiu Zotta), redrawings of the Mac and Cocofifi originals, and Dan Buzdugan (\\"Dan the Mace\\", a medieval fantasy series, distinguished among her contributions for its more realistic visual style). By then, Rusz had also started work in illustration, primarily as a cover artist for various local publishing houses, including Editura Ion CreangƒÉ and Editura Tineretului. Her work was remarked by writer and Ion CreangƒÉ manager Tiberiu Utan, and Rusz became a permanent collaborator of the brand. During her time with Editura Ion CreangƒÉ, she applied her art to editions of Wilhelm Hauff's M√§rchen (as Basme), and reprints of classical works for children in Romanian literature: Nicolae Constantin Batzaria's Pove≈üti de aur (\\"Golden Stories\\") and Ion CreangƒÉ's collected fairy tales and Childhood Memories.Arina Stoenescu, \\"All Those Images\\", in the Romanian Cultural Institute's Plural Magazine , Nr. 30/2007 Also during that interval, L√≠via Rusz became the first Romanian illustrator of J. R. R. Tolkien's work, when she contributed drawings for The Hobbit (in its original 1975 edition, marketed by Editura Ion CreangƒÉ). While working on this project, she was reportedly unable to compare her renditions of hobbits, Elves or Orcs with any previous portrayals by other artists, owing to the scarcity of foreign literature sources in Romania‚Äîher work therefore owed much to imagination. In 1987, two years before the December Revolution toppled communism, Rusz decided to leave Romania for West Germany. This gesture was a consequence of nationalist and national communist policies adopted by the regime of Nicolae Ceau≈üescu and specifically targeting some of Romania's ethnic minorities. According to writer Gy√∂rgy Gy√∂rfi-De√°k, Ceau≈üescu \\"gave a hard time to the Hungarians\\", and Rusz personally was \\"harassed by the dictator's politruks and Securitate men\\". After a short stay in Germany, Rusz settled in Budapest, Hungary, where she owned a villa. Vali Ivan, \\"Lumea copiilor de altƒÉdatƒÉ\\" (interview with Dodo Ni≈£ƒÉ), in Jurnalul Na≈£ional, June 2, 2007 She continued her activity, becoming a noted contributor to the Hungarian comic school (with albums such as Miskati k√∂zbel√©p, \\"Miskati Intervenes\\"). The change was described by the artist herself as a difficult one: \\"Even plants will suffer when moved from one pot to another; it was not easy for me either to build up my new roots, but as long as forces permit me and I can still work it means I am alive.\\" Cultural impact In Romania itself, where she was among the few female comics artists, L√≠via Rusz has come to be described as a leading contributor to the genres she covered in her work. Gy√∂rfi-De√°k wrote: \\"throughout her long artistic career, Rusz L√≠via has been leading us through an enchanted universe, depicted with unique sensitivity and grace, unveiling through drawings all that is beautiful and worthy in the world\\". Noted by visual artist Arina Stonescu as one of the three main illustrators employed by Editura Ion CreangƒÉ (alongside Val Munteanu and Eugen Taru), she drew particular critical attention for Childhood Memories. Deemed \\"legendary\\" by Gy√∂rfi-De√°k, the volume also led Arina Stonescu to write: \\"I often imagine the fascinating world of the storyteller Ion CreangƒÉ only populated by Livia Rusz's girls and boys in national costumes.\\" Rusz was described as \\"the greatest creator of comic strips in Romania\\" by comics historiographer Dodo Ni≈£ƒÉ, who granted Mac and Cocofifi the second place in an all-time chart of Romanian comics. Ioana Calen, \\"CƒÉrtƒÉrescu e tras √Æn bandƒÉ ‚Äì Provocarea desenatƒÉ\\", in Cotidianul, June 13, 2006 Her activity under communism nevertheless coincided with a decline in the overall impact of Romanian comics: while exercising ideological control over the comic strip scene, the Romanian Communist Party reputedly preferred to invest in animation, seeing it as a more effective propaganda tool. Adrian Grama, Vlad Stoicescu, \\"Rahan ≈üi Pif, scƒÉpa≈£i de comunism\\", in Evenimentul Zilei, June 28, 2008 In this context, Rusz and Eugen Taru were among those who still produced comics able to reach the general public (a category which also included, according to one assessment, Ion Deak, Pompiliu Dumitrescu, Puiu Manu, VintilƒÉ MihƒÉescu, Dumitru Negrea and Ion Popescu-Gopo). Her work in the field was also subject to a post-1989 revival in interest. It was a feature of reference works published in 1996 and 2005 by Dodo Ni≈£ƒÉ, and the artist herself a special guest at the Romanian-Hungarian Comics Salon, organized in Budapest by the Romanian Cultural Institute. Ni≈£ƒÉ also joined up with Ferenc Kiss to write and publish the first monograph on Rusz, which saw print in 2009. It included homage pieces from two of her fans, historian Adrian Cioroianu and writer- diplomat Mircea Opri≈£ƒÉ.

Retrieved 12 May 2019. Plot Don Benton (Richard Basehart), a former World War II combat pilot, now running a travel agency in Hong Kong, refuses to take political sides and flatly rejects an offer to do espionage work for the United States. When Mao Tai Tai (Athene Seyler), an old Chinese woman who more or less adopted Benton during the war years, asks him to try to find her missing grandson. Knowing that the grandson was piloting a Formosan aircraft that disappeared over mainland China, Benton obtains a passport through a Russian friend, Ivano Kang (Eric Pohlmann). Flying to the mainland, he rescues the downed pilot. To clear the young man's name, Benton goes to Canton to bring back one of the aircraft passengers, an independent agent, Lola Sanchez (Lisa Gastoni), who has memorized a vital scientific formula and is willing to sell it to the highest bidder. Kang tries to get the formula from her, but she kills him. Benton hopes to get Lola out of the city, but as they work their way through holiday street crowds, she is fatally wounded by Kang's bodyguard and dies with her secret.

They have sent the robot OR-CABE-3 back to Earth to obtain the secret defense plans of the enemy robot base. The player takes control of OR-CABE-3 as it attempts to escape the enemy base with the plans and board a spacecraft for Nova. Gameplay The player has the role of the robot OR-CABE-3 as it attempts to escape the enemy base and leave Earth. Starting at the deepest level of the base, where the robot has stolen the defense plans, it must evade hostile robots and travel to the surface, where an escape ship awaits. The robot OR-CABE-3 resembles a tank with a rotating gun mounted on a caterpillar- track base. The gun section is capable of flight and may be detached from the base to kill enemies or solve problems, though it loses energy while in this state. If it runs out of energy the game ends. A life is lost if the gun section is destroyed. If the base section is destroyed it is respawned at the starting location, but no lives are lost.

It was both developed and published by Sega in Japan and Europe, and published by Activision for the North American market. Plot Set in the year 2242, the player controls Paladin, the galaxy's toughest bounty hunter. Cyborgs are about to take complete control of the universe under the direction of Vipron, their evil leader. The player is sent to the cyborg fortress to get rid of all the chief cyborgs in each of the seven areas. They are not alone in this mission. They also have Adina, their contact back at headquarters. The player must follow her instructions carefully to survive. Gameplay Screen layout showing 3D radar, map and action panes. The game screen is divided into three sections. This includes a first-person view of the map, in which the player can see objects that are coming their way. There are two types of objects: red objects indicate the lower cyborgs, while white ones indicate the chief cyborgs. Next to it is a map of the area, the player's life and psycho power count. Below these is the main action screen, which is a side-on perspective of Paladin negotiating the environment and taking on enemies. In each of these seven areas, there are several floors which can be reached via the elevator. At the beginning of the game, the player's only weapons are their fists, but weapons can be collected throughout each area, which include a psycho punch, a ray gun, a light gun, and bombs. Power-ups like extra life and psycho power can also be collected. If the player uses the psycho punch or psycho gun, their psycho power gets depleted, and when it is empty, they must stock up on some more. They can also get shields that will protect them from laser beams, and jet engines so that the player can fly over hazards. In some areas, they defeat a boss which leaves an ID card, which the player can use to access other areas of the fortress. The equipment menu is accessed using the A or B buttons on the second controller. The story is advanced by simple cutscenes showing Adina talking, accompanied by text below. Adina also provides gameplay tips at pre- determined points in the game. Development The game was originally developed as a title called Ch≈çonsenshi Borgman (Ë∂ÖÈü≥Êà¶Â£´„Éú„Éº„Ç∞„Éû„É≥), and was based on an animated TV series of the same name. For non-Japanese territories the game was marketed as Cyborg Hunter. The Japanese version of the game has a storyline more resemblant of the anime series. The original game was designed by Hirohiko Yoneda who would later work on Shenmue, and Yasushi Yamaguchi who is also credited for design on Sonic the Hedgehog 2. Music was composed by Nav and Key. Reception Cyborg Hunter was labelled as unoriginal, but still \\"addictive and challenging\\". Computer and Video Games magazine rated the game at 76%. Game Freaks 365 called the game easy as the player can \\"waste the majority of cyborgs in a few hits\\", and lacking in creativity. The reviewer gave the game 6/10. Retrospective reviews have compared the game to Metroid.

It is a small theatre that is based in an old oast house. It is home to the Tonbridge Theatre and Arts Club. The theatre seats 112 people. History Tonbridge Theatre and Arts Club (TTAC) was based at The Mitre PH, Hadlow Road, Tonbridge. In the late 1960s, it was apparent that the venue was too small and an alternative was sought. The search led to a disused oast house, (select \\"History\\", then \\"The Early Years\\" from menu on left side) which had been used to dry hops until 1966. The oast was purchased for ¬£7,000 by a consortium of ten members of TTAC, who sold it on to TTAC for ¬£6,000. The Oast Theatre was opened on 20 April 1974 by Lady Rupert Nevill. The opening production was an adaptation of Tom Jones. By 1978, TTAC had paid off all loans taken out to purchase and convert the oast. In 1982, the Oast Theatre was awarded Civic Design Award from Tonbridge Civic Society. The theatre is a registered charity, the Tonbridge Theatre and Arts Club. In 1988, an extension was built on the side of the oast. The adjoining barn was purchased and converted for use as storage and workshops. The extension was opened by Prince Edward, who attended a performance of Children of a Lesser God. A further extension in 1997 provided improved dressing room and additional storage facilities. The theatre can seat 112 people. In January 2010, the theatre was granted planning permission for an extension of an ancillary storage building. The planning application was supported by The Theatres Trust. Oast Youth Theatre The Oast Theatre is home to the Oast Youth Theatre. Its members are between 13 and 18 years old. They produce three plays per annum. Art The Oast Theatre has its own art group, which meets weekly. The theatre plays host to an annual art exhibition held in the Janet Young Room. The exhibition normally attracts about fifty artists and one hundred and fifty exhibits of extremely high quality.

History Khao Manee cat or Khao plort in the Tamra Maew of Wat Arun (the Cat-Book Poems) thought to originate from the Thonburi kingdom - Rattanakosin Kingdom (AD 1768 to 1910). Over a dozen are now kept in the National Library of Thailand. (keep right) Khao Manee cat in the Tamra Maew of Wat Arun (the Cat-Book Poems) AD 1768 to 1910. The Khao Manee is an ancient cat breed comparable to the Siamese, Korat and other Thailand cat breeds. The Khao Manee is mentioned in the Tamra Maew, or Cat Book Poems, that also mention the Siamese cat breed and other coat colored cats endemic to the country Thailand, or Siam, as it was previously known. Khao Manee cats are pure white with a short, smooth, close- lying coat. Ayutthaya Kingdom In the Ayutthaya Kingdom (AD 1351-1767) there are many books about ancient Siam cats recording cats such as the Siamese cat, Korat cat, Suphalak cat, Konja cat, etc.. There are 23 species in Ayutthaya. 17 species were fed at the Ayutthaya royal palace, but there are no records about the Khao Manee. There are a few records about white cats, but no specific records about the Khao Manee. Only 23 species have been recorded. Thonburi Kingdom Erroneous information in the research. There is a Khao Manee (white cat). But the picture is incorrect; this is a Mulila cat. After the Ayutthaya Kingdom collapsed during the Burmese-Siamese War (AD 1765-67), the Siamese people emigrated to the Thonburi kingdom (AD 1768-1782). One of the most important temples in Bangkok is in the Wat Arun. A Buddhist temple had existed at the site of Wat Arun since the time of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. When King Taksin established his new capital of Thonburi near the temple after the fall of Ayutthaya, the Khao Manee's historical records were found there. Rattanakosin Kingdom (Bangkok) Khao Manee Mural Painting in Wat Thong Noppakhun, Bangkok. Created in the reign of King Rama 1-3 (AD 1782 to 1851). In the reign of King Nangklao (AD 1824-1851), the Khao Manee is more frequently mentioned. Khao Manee cats are famed and there have been paintings found of them at temples. The white cat was originally known as the ‚ÄòKhao Plort‚Äô, then became known as the Khao Manee in the reign of King Chulalongkorn (1868-1910 AD). The Khao Manee is not to be confused with the Siamese, or any Siamese relative including the Foreign White Siamese, which was bred from purebred Siamese with one white-coated British Shorthair ancestor. Though both white cats have a common background, the Siamese cat and the Khao Manee have different genetic structures, bloodlines and breeding policies, thus Khao Manee are considered a completely different breed in the West, as well as in its native home of Thailand. Although the breed is well known in its native land, it has only recently been adopted by Western cat breeders, gaining \\"registration only\\" status from TICA in May 2009. On 3 September 2011, the breed was promoted to \\"Preliminary New Breed\\", effective from 1 May 2012 and on 30 August 2013 the breed was promoted to \\"Advanced New Breed\\", effective immediately. Now the breed also gained \\"Miscellaneous\\" status in CFA from 2018 and was therefore accepted in other associations such as WCF. Personality They are devoted to their owners and are curious, intelligent cats who have an enduring sense of naughtiness. They are quite the inquisitive cat and love to play a good game of fetch before curling up with you for a warm nap. Known as the ‚ÄúWhite Gem‚Äù, the Khao Manee was rumored to be highly coveted by Thai royalty is thought to bring good luck to those fortunate enough to have one. Breeding Odd-eyed Khao Manee cat The Khao Manee was said to be kept and bred initially by Siam royals, as was the case with other rare colored cats such as the Siamese. Breeders in Thailand are promoting and breeding the Khao Manee in the effort of preserving its lineage and breed standard. The first Khao Manee cat imported to the United States arrived in 1999 when Colleen Freymuth imported 12 Khao Manees. In 2004, she was joined by Fr√©d√©ric Lachaud- Goedert in France who began another breeding program. With the help of Janet Poulsen, an edifying contributor to the establishment of the breed, they worked to have the breed recognized in all the world's cat registries. Breeders in the West are still working to promote and establish foundation lines for the Khao Manee. The Khao Manees are currently probably the rarest feline breed in the world, the prices are relative high: an adult subject with gold eyes and \\"defects\\" (\\"broken\\" tail, strabismus, deafness, non-white subject ...) is negotiated around US $1,800. On the other hand, a young subject intended for breeding, coming directly from a prestigious breeding program in the West or Thailand, with odd eyes, and having beautiful characteristics, can be negotiated around US $3,500. Certain exceptional subjects with singular eye colors or with very rare features or healing talents can reach up to US $10,000. In its country of origin, the Khao Manee is very popular because it is associated with the monarchy but also because several legends of extreme felicity and healing were reported by the press. It's always in relation with religious discovery and about sudden fortune. Some stories mention sums going up to 150 million Baht (over US $4 million) in 1993 for a subject with eyes like precious stones which funded the construction of a monastery.\\"The Legend of Siamese Cats\\" by Martin R. Clutterbuck A club joining western and eastern breeders, the Khao Manee Cat Club, has been formed in 2019 and was affiliated with the CFA in order to support the promotion, the preservation and the protection of the Khao Manees. Finding a Pedigreed Khao Manee After twelve weeks, kittens have had their basic inoculations and developed the physical and social stability needed for a new environment, showing, or being transported by air. Keeping such a rare treasure indoors, neutering or spaying, and providing acceptable surfaces (e.g. scratching posts) for the natural behavior of scratching are essential elements for maintaining a healthy, long, and joyful life. There are a variety of breeders from where you may acquire your new kitten or cat, in Thailand or in the West now. Outside of Thailand, a registration of your kitten is mandatory with one major association to secure it is a real Khao Manee from imported ancestors. A potential buyer looking for a ‚Äúpure bred‚Äù (pedigreed) Khao Manee as a pet can expect to pay over US $1500 depending on their eyes colors (around US $3000 for odd eyed kittens), their confirmation to the breed standard and your geographical location. The Thai breeders used to breed only white to white Khao Manees. This is the most distinctive trait of the breed. While most western breeders perpetuate this heritage by screening their genetic informations, other breeders prefer to cross their subjects with colored Asian breeds of cats. This partly explains the significant variations between the prices among the different breeders. Their active investment in the preservation of the breed and their links with the preservation of Thai Khao Manees can also justify still the high cost of such precious creatures in the West. Some breeders will not hesitate to enter into a contract concerning the quality of the ceded Khao Manees and to give you guarantees of good health.

Bridge  Elizabeth Way Bridge on Elizabeth Way crosses the River Cam just to the north of the Newmarket Road roundabout, with Midsummer Common to the west.Elizabeth Way Bridge (Cambridge), Wikimapia. In the 19th century, Chesterton to the north was not formally part of Cambridge. Links to the city were not good because of the River Cam, which blocked the way. Until 1890, the only bridge access into Cambridge from Chesterton was via Magdalene Bridge (the \\"Great Bridge\\") to the west. In 1889, the Cam Bridges Act enabled two new bridges to be constructed between Chesterton and Cambridge. In 1890 the first of these was built, Victoria Bridge on Victoria Avenue, between Jesus Green and Midsummer Common. In 1911, Chesterton was incorporated into Cambridge and a new bridge was promised by 1917. However, with the outbreak of World War I, this never happened. In 1950, a report state that the construction of a second Chesterton bridge should be undertaken a matter of urgency. Eventually, in 1971, the Elizabeth Way Bridge was opened, on the proposed 1950 route. The bridge is a plain four-carriageway concrete bridge. It was formally opened by Rab Butler in his capacity as High Steward of Cambridge on 13 July 1971. It is still the most recent road bridge to be built in Cambridge and is now one of the main vehicular bridges across the Cam in the city. To the west on the northern bank of the Cam is The Eights, a private marina and apartment blocks.

The film follows the efforts in Ireland to turn a seemingly useless racing horse, called The March Hare, into a Derby-winner. Plot The film begins at Royal Ascot. Sir Charles Hare (Terence Morgan) is an Irish baronet who loses his ancestral home and its racing stables after someone fixes a race that Hare has gambled on. Forced to sell his estate, he decides to stay on when the new American owner's attractive daughter Pat (Peggy Cummins) mistakes him for a groom. Playing along with her mistake, romance develops between the two. Meanwhile, Hare's aunt Lady Anne (Martita Hunt) and his friend Col Keene (Wilfrid Hyde-White), save one colt from the sale, and rear it with the help of Mangan (Cyril Cusack), who is invariably drunk but has strong control over the horse by invoking the power of the fairies. Hare names the colt \\"The March Hare\\". We jump two years to a racecourse where Peggy discovers Sir Charles's true identity and \\"The March Hare\\" only manages to race after Mangan calms the horse using fairy words. Hare and Pat go for a date in London. After Mangan falls ill, he becomes teetotal, which restores his health but means he can no longer remember the fairy words. Derby Day arrives and Hare needs to track down Mangan... Lady Anne has got him drunk in the pub in the hope that it will restore his memory of the fairy words. They get him to the track in time to whisper his magic words to the horse. As the race starts March Hare lags behind: it appears that someone has sabotaged the race again, but March Hare forges forward and wins. Sir Charles is rich again and Peggy is happy to marry him.

The objective was to improve information transfer, ensure availability of research results and increase international awareness of European grey literature by making the bibliographic records as widely available as possible. The role of the members was to identify and collect documents, to prepare associated bibliographic and subject descriptions, to provide information services and products to users, and to archive and deliver copies of the grey literature documents.  EAGLE history and economic model  From 1980 to 1985, SIGLE was funded by the Commission of the European Communities (CEC). When CEC financial support ended in 1985, the national centres formed a network for the acquisition, identification and dissemination of grey literature called EAGLE, who became the producer of the SIGLE database. EAGLE was created as a non-profit making association registered in Luxembourg. In the beginning, membership was limited to the member countries of the European Union (former European Community) but this limitation was abolished in 1995. In the end, 15 countries participated actively, and discussions on partnership were going on with other potential members, especially in East European and North African countries. The economic model of the association was based on initial funding by the European Commission and from 1985 onwards was based on membership fees and royalties from servers and products (CD-ROM, records). The SIGLE database was distributed by BLAISE, STN, EI and Ovid Technologies (Silverplatter) and in the early nineties by SUNIST in France. Records were also sold to vendor organizations like NERAC for specific use. Costs were generated by the management of the association and mainly by the operating agent, whose task was to merge the national files into a unique server file every month.

Even if FIZ Karlsruhe developed a web-version of SIGLE, the database production didn‚Äôt adjust to the possibilities offered by the new technologies of information: #* No direct online cataloguing in a shared bibliographic database. #* No metadata harvesting. #* Very few records of e-documents. #* Few direct access to full text. #* Few links to other resources. # Organisational structure: The EAGLE structure (national input centres, a central operating agent) was unable to open the network easily to new and/or important producers of grey literature. Furthermore, it was not adapted to the need of flexible and rapid decision taking and marketing. # Coverage: For most of the EAGLE countries, the national input became less and less representative. Often, even for the national input centres input criteria and workload excluded a significant part of their grey collections (dissertations, reports, conference proceedings). # Economic model: The EAGLE model was based on flat membership fees and revenues from servers. Access to the database remained ‚Äútraditional‚Äù with an annual subscription to the host or else a pay-per-view for each record with a credit card. This business model was not sustainable. With important members retiring from input and membership and the success of open access based initiatives, the economic model came to an end and needed revision. Investment for the development of the database was not provided. EAGLE members were aware of these challenges and discussed possible options and solutions from 2002 on. Nevertheless, the organisational structure and the non-sustainable business model of the non-profit making and low budget association did not allow necessary strategy decisions. It also became obvious then that no institutional member would invest more than its membership fee and that another funding from the EU would be unlikely.  Liquidation of EAGLE  In the face of this situation, the 2005 General Assembly from March 14, 2005, held at Karlsruhe, Germany, resolved unanimously to liquidate the association. The President (Joachim Sch√∂pfel, INIST-CNRS) and the Vice-President (Silke Rehme, FIZ Karlsruhe) were appointed as liquidators. After satisfaction of claims the remaining funds were distributed on equal parts amongst the members, taking into account the current memberships and the payment of the membership fees during the last years. The contracts with STN, EI, NERAC and Ovid (SilverPlatter) were cancelled. The EAGLE website hosted by the Dutch Royal Library was deleted. All usage rights of the SIGLE database lapsed upon complete liquidation of the association while the copyright on input remained with each member who supplied the records. Nevertheless, the General Assembly asked the operating agent, the FIZ Karlsruhe, for interim conservation of the SIGLE records in XML format beyond the liquidation of SIGLE, for the purpose of archiving and integration into a new open access European non-profit project (OpenSIGLE). Nearly all of the former EAGLE members signed a declaration of intention regarding this future use of their existing input of the SIGLE database. The complete liquidation of EAGLE was published by the Luxemburg Register of Commerce and Societies at August 23, 2006.

The cuts are used in various dishes around the world, and experienced a resurgence in the late 2000s. Description Pig's trotters, served as Irish- style Crubeens in Illinois Wonton noodles with pig's trotters braised with nam yu (fermented bean curd) Before sale, the trotters are cleaned and typically have the hairs pulled with a hot tank and beaters. They are often used in cooking to make stocks, as they add thickness to gravy, although they are also served as a normal cut of meat. Chef Marco Pierre White has long served trotters at his restaurants, based on the original recipe of mentor Pierre Koffmann. In the New York City restaurant Hakata Tonton, 33 of the 39 dishes served contain pig's trotters. Following the late-2000s financial crisis, there has been a boom in popularity of pig's trotters in the United Kingdom as a revival in cheap meat recipes occurred. In 2008, British supermarket Waitrose reintroduced trotters to its stores, and found that they quickly became popular. In 2009, Pierre Koffmann set up a pop-up restaurant, and found that diners ate an entire month's stock of 500 pig's trotters in less than a week. In Norwegian tradition pigs feet are salted and boiled and served as syltelabb. This is a pre Christmas dish because the pig was slaughtered before Christmas, and everything was used.

Gonzalez and his accomplices used SQL injection to deploy backdoors on several corporate systems in order to launch packet sniffing (specifically, ARP Spoofing) attacks which allowed him to steal computer data from internal corporate networks. During his spree, he was said to have thrown himself a $75,000 birthday party and complained about having to count $340,000 by hand after his currency-counting machine broke. Gonzalez stayed at lavish hotels but his formal homes were modest. Gonzalez had three federal indictments. The first was in May 2008 in New York for the Dave & Busters case (trial schedule September 2009). The second was in May 2008 in Massachusetts for the TJ Maxx case (trial scheduled early 2010). The third was in August 2009 in New Jersey in connection with the Heartland Payment case.\\"Leader of Hacking Ring Sentenced for Massive Identity Thefts from Payment Processor and U.S. Retail Networks\\", United States Department of Justice Friday, March 26, 2010 Retrieved on October 9 2018 On March 25, 2010, Gonzalez was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison. Gonzalez, along with his team, were featured on the 5th-season episode of the CNBC series American Greed titled: \\"Episode 40: Hackers: Operation Get Rich or Die Tryin‚Äô\\". Early life and education Gonzalez bought his first computer when he was 12, and by the time he was 14 managed to hack into NASA. He attended South Miami High School in Miami, Florida, where he was described as the \\"troubled\\" pack leader of computer nerds. In 2000, he moved to New York City, where he lived for three months before moving to Kearny, New Jersey.Meek, James Gordon; and Siemaszko, Corky. \\"'Soupnazi' hacker Albert Gonzalez went from nerdy past to life of sex, guns and drugs\\", Daily News (New York), August 19, 2009. Accessed March 28, 2011. \\"After graduation, Gonzalez moved north to Manhattan and lived on the East Side for three months in 2000 before setting up shop in Kearny, N.J., records show. It was while living there in an anonymous garden apartment with mostly senior citizens as neighbors that Gonzalez was busted for hacking in 2003.\\" Hacking career ShadowCrew While in Kearny, he was accused of being the mastermind of a group of hackers called the ShadowCrew group, which trafficked in 1.5 million stolen credit and ATM card numbers. Although considered the mastermind of the scheme (operating on the site under the screen name of \\"CumbaJohnny\\"), he was not indicted. According to the indictment, there were 4,000 people who registered with the Shadowcrew.com website. Once registered, they could buy stolen account numbers or counterfeit documents at auction, or read ‚ÄúTutorials and How-To‚Äôs‚Äù describing the use of cryptography in magnetic strips on credit cards, debit cards and ATM cards so that the numbers could be used. Moderators of the website punished members who did not abide by the site's rules, including providing refunds to buyers if the stolen card numbers proved invalid. In addition to the card numbers, numerous other objects of identity theft were sold at auction, including counterfeit passports, drivers‚Äô licenses, Social Security cards, credit cards, debit cards, birth certificates, college student identification cards, and health insurance cards. One member sold 18 million e-mail accounts with associated usernames, passwords, dates of birth, and other personally identifying information. Most of those indicted were members who actually sold illicit items. Members who maintained or moderated the website itself were also indicted, including one who attempted to register the .cc domain name Shadowcrew.cc. The Secret Service dubbed their investigation \\"Operation Firewall\\" and believed that up to $4.3 million was stolen, as ShadowCrew shared its information with other groups entitled Carderplanet and Darkprofits. The investigation involved units from the United States, Bulgaria, Belarus, Canada, Poland, Sweden, the Netherlands and Ukraine. Gonzalez was initially charged with possession of 15 fake credit and debit cards in Newark, New Jersey, though he avoided jail time by providing evidence to the United States Secret Service against his cohorts. 19 ShadowCrew members were indicted. Gonzalez then returned to Miami. TJX Companies hack While cooperating with authorities, he was said to have masterminded the hacking of TJX Companies, in which 45.6 million credit and debit card numbers were stolen over an 18-month period ending in 2007, topping the 2005 breach of 40 million records at CardSystems Solutions. Gonzalez and 10 others sought targets while wardriving and seeking vulnerabilities in wireless networks along U.S. Route 1 in Miami. They compromised cards at BJ's Wholesale Club, DSW, Office Max, Boston Market, Barnes & Noble, Sports Authority and T.J. Maxx. The indictment referred to Gonzalez by the screen names \\"cumbajohny\\", \\"201679996\\", \\"soupnazi\\", \\"segvec\\", \\"kingchilli\\" and \\"stanozlolz.\\" The hacking was an embarrassment to TJ Maxx, which discovered the breach in December 2006. The company initially believed the intrusion began in May 2006, but further investigation revealed breaches dating back to July 2005. One of his alleged co-conspirators was 7-foot-tall Stephen Watt, known in the hacker world as \\"Unix Terrorist\\" and \\"Jim Jones.\\" Watt worked at Morgan Stanley in New York City and wrote the sniffer program. Arrest Gonzalez was arrested on May 7, 2008 on charges stemming from hacking into the Dave & Buster's corporate network from a point of sale location at a restaurant in Islandia, New York. The incident occurred in September 2007. About 5,000 card numbers were stolen. Fraudulent transactions totaling $600,000 were reported on 675 of the cards. Authorities became suspicious after the conspirators kept returning to the restaurant to reintroduce their hack, because it would not restart after the company computers shut down. Gonzalez was arrested in room 1508 at the National Hotel in Miami Beach, Florida. In various related raids, authorities seized $1.6 million in cash (including $1.1 million buried in plastic bags in a three-foot drum in his parents' backyard), his laptops and a compact Glock pistol. Officials said that, at the time of his arrest, Gonzalez lived in a nondescript house in Miami. He was taken to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where he was indicted in the Heartland attacks. Co- defendants Gonzalez had multiple US co-defendants for the Dave & Buster's and TJX thefts. The main ones were charged and sentenced as follows: * Stephen Watt was charged with providing a data theft tool in an identity theft case. He was sentenced to two years in prison and 3 years of supervised release. He was also ordered by the court to pay back $250.000 in restitution. * Damon Patrick Toey pleaded guilty to wire fraud, credit card fraud, and aggravated identity theft and received a five-year sentence. * Christopher Scott plead guilty to conspiracy, unauthorized access to computer systems, access device fraud and identity theft. He was sentenced to seven years. Heartland Payment Systems hack In August 2009, Gonzalez was indicted in Newark, New Jersey on charges dealing with hacking into the Heartland Payment Systems, Citibank-branded 7-Eleven ATM's and Hannaford Brothers computer systems. Heartland bore the brunt of the attack, in which 130 million card numbers were stolen. Hannaford had 4.6 million numbers stolen. Two other retailers were not disclosed in the indictment; however, Gonzalez's attorney told StorefrontBacktalk that two of the retailers were J.C. Penney and Target Corporation. Heartland reported that it had lost $12.6 million in the attack including legal fees. Gonzalez allegedly called the scheme \\"Operation Get Rich or Die Tryin.\\" According to the indictment the attacks, by Gonzalez and two unidentified hackers \\"in or near Russia\\" along with unindicted conspirator \\"P.T.\\" from Miami, began on December 26, 2007, at Heartland Payment Systems, August 2007 against 7-Eleven, and in November 2007 against Hannaford Brothers and two other unidentified companies. Gonzalez and his cohorts targeted large companies and studied their check out terminals and then attacked the companies from internet-connected computers in New Jersey, Illinois, Latvia, the Netherlands and Ukraine. They covered their attacks over the Internet using more than one messaging screen name, storing data related to their attacks on multiple Hacking Platforms, disabling programs that logged inbound and outbound traffic over the Hacking Platforms, and disguising, through the use of proxies, the Internet Protocol addresses from which their attacks originated. The indictment said the hackers tested their program against 20 anti virus programs. Rene Palomino Jr., attorney for Gonzalez, charged in a blog on The New York Times website that the indictment arose out of squabbling among U.S. Attorney offices in New York, Massachusetts and New Jersey. Palomino said that Gonzalez was in negotiations with New York and Massachusetts for a plea deal in connection with the T.J. Maxx case when New Jersey made its indictment. Palomino identified the unindicted conspirator \\"P.T.\\" as Damon Patrick Toey, who had pleaded guilty in the T.J. Maxx case. Palomino said Toey, rather than Gonzalez, was the ring leader of the Heartland case. Palomino further said, ‚ÄúMr. Toey has been cooperating since Day One. He was staying at (Gonzalez‚Äôs) apartment. This whole creation was Mr. Toey‚Äôs idea...It was his baby. This was not Albert Gonzalez. I know for a fact that he wasn‚Äôt involved in all of the chains that were hacked from New Jersey.‚Äù Palomino said one of the unnamed Russian hackers in the Heartland case was Maksym Yastremskiy, who was also indicted in the T.J. Maxx incident but is now serving 30 years in a Turkish prison on a charge of hacking Turkish banks in a separate matter. Investigators said Yastremskiy and Gonzalez exchanged 600 messages and that Gonzalez paid him $400,000 through e-gold. Yastremskiy was arrested in July 2007 in Turkey on charges of hacking into 12 banks in Turkey. The Secret Service investigation into him was used to build the case against Gonzalez including a sneak and peek covert review of Yastremskiy's laptop in Dubai in 2006 and a review of the disk image of the Latvia computer leased from Cronos IT and alleged to have been used in the attacks. After the indictment, Heartland issued a statement saying that it does not know how many card numbers were stolen from the company nor how the U.S. government reached the 130 million number. Plea bargain On August 28, 2009, Gonzalez's attorney filed papers with the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts in Boston indicating that he would plead guilty to all 19 charges in the U.S. v. Albert Gonzalez, 08-CR-10223, case (the TJ Maxx case). According to reports this plea bargain would \\"resolve\\" issues with the New York case of U.S. v. Yastremskiy, 08-CR-00160 in United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (the Dave and Busters case). On March 25, 2010, U.S. District Judge Patti Saris sentenced Gonzalez to 20 years in prison for hacking into and stealing information from TJX, Office Max, the Dave & Busters restaurant chain, Barnes & Noble and a string of other companies. The next day, U.S. District Court Judge Douglas P. Woodlock sentenced him to 20 years in connection with the Heartland Payment Systems case. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently, meaning that Gonzalez will serve a total of 20 years for both cases. Gonzalez was also ordered to forfeit more than $1.65 million, a condominium in Miami, a blue 2006 BMW 330i automobile, IBM and Toshiba laptop computers, a Glock 27 firearm, a Nokia cell phone, a Tiffany diamond ring and three Rolex watches. On March 25, 2011, Gonzalez filed a motion in U.S. District Court in Boston to withdraw his guilty plea. He claimed that during the time he committed his crimes, he had been assisting the United States Secret Service in seeking out international cybercriminals and said his attorneys failed to advise him that he could have therefore used a ‚Äúpublic authority‚Äù defense. The Secret Service declined to comment on Gonzalez's motion. Gonzalez is currently serving his 20-year sentence at the FMC Lexington, a medical facility. He is scheduled for release December 4, 2025.

Founded by Peter the Great in 1721 as the Peterhof Lapidary Works, to make hardstone carvings, since 1945 the factory manufactures the Soviet Pobeda watches and since 1961 it has manufactured the Soviet Raketa watches. In almost 300 years of history, the factory has changed name several times. Petrodvorets is located in Saint Petersburg. History Tsarist era Initially, the factory produced luxury objects in semi-precious and precious stones for the palaces of the Tsars. We find these objects now in the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, but also in most of the palaces of Europe, such as Versailles, the Louvre or Sanssouci. Early Soviet era In Soviet times, the plant had continued to work on precious stones. This plant had produced among others, the Mausoleum of Lenin in 1924 and the Kremlin stars in 1935. In the prewar years, the skilled workers began manufacturing precision and measurement instruments for the Red Army and the new industry of Russian watches. Siege of Leningrad Destroyed by Nazi troops during the Siege of Leningrad, the plant was rebuilt from 1944 at the liberation of the city. In 1945 Joseph Stalin‚Äîwho wanted to reduce USSR's dependence on imports from the West‚Äîgave the order to the factory to manufacture watches. The first watches were produced in the factory under the brand Pobeda and Zvezda. In 1961, in honor of the first cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, the factory created its new brand, Raketa, which makes its reputation throughout the world of Communist influence. In its glory years after the war, the plant employed 8,000 people, produced 4.5 million watches per year for Soviet citizens and the needs of the Red Army. The plant was equipped with two atomic bunkers that could accommodate 8,000 people in case of a western nuclear attack, had its own schools, university, hospital, resorts on the Black Sea, camps for Communist Youth Pioneer organization and Komsomol and its orchestras. After 1991 Today, the plant has dramatically cut production following the troubled years of privatization and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Despite huge difficulties in adapting to the capitalist system, Raketa is one of the few (together with Vostok and Zaria) watch manufacturers, which remained after the fall of the USSR. Tourism Today, the factory‚Äîthat was considered as strategic, and closed to visitors during Soviet times‚Äîis opened to tourism. Peterhof has an average of three millions visitors per year, the factory has become a popular tour. Guides show around the production facility that gives a feeling of traveling back to the USSR, but also to learn about clock manufacturing. Brands From Soviet time Raketa - luxury brand, fully manufactured in-house. The factory's high end production, Raketa was created in 1961 in honor of Yuri Gagarin's flight to space. One of the rare watch brands in the world producing its movements in-house from A to Z, Raketa is famous for its watches made for cosmonauts, polar expeditions, pilots and military. Pobeda - affordable, loaded with history. Founded by Stalin himself in 1945, Pobeda is probably Russia's most popular brand for the last 100 years. First watch to have been in space in 1961, Pobeda has always been a popular and affordable Russian brand. From Tzarist times Talberg is a watch brand owned by the factory since before the Revolution. The Factory is considering relaunching it in the coming years as a niche brand. Imperial Lapidary Work of Peterhof. This is how the factory was named before 1917. As a brand it belongs to the Petrodvorets Watch Factory and from time to time you hear of a multi-million piece sold in auctions in London under that name.

ECTR Announces Research Grants and Kantor Prize for Secure Tolerance  Concept of Secure Tolerance  Dr Kantor has formulated and developed the notion of Secure Tolerance to highlight the need to reimagine the theory and practice of tolerance to meet the new challenges of a globalised world and the highly diverse and fragmented societies it contains. Secure Tolerance is an advanced way of thinking that recognizes that merely responding to breaches of Tolerance and Security is a passive approach, which does nothing to safeguard either of these essential concepts. Based on this concept, by further developing our thinking on how to make tolerance more secure and fit for purpose, particularly when society contains groups and movements that do not subscribe to our values of tolerance and peaceful co- existence, we can ensure universal rights are sustainably protected.  Kantor's Manifesto on Secure Tolerance  Dr Kantor's Manifesto on Secure Tolerance offers a detailed explanation of the concept of Secure Tolerance formulated by him. It has become the first of its kind and a blueprint for global tolerance practices and solutions for intercultural conflicts in European countries and has been published in 2011 in seven languages.

Plantations for producing kananga water were established by the British in Jamaica in the 19th century. Kananga water, like Florida Water, is used in various rituals including spiritual cleaning, and appeasing the spirits of the dead. Its use is particularly common among people of the African diaspora. Peter L. Patrick in his list of \\"Some Recent Jamaican Creole Words\\" (an earlier version of which appeared in the journal American Speech in Fall 1995, 70(3):227-264.) suggests that the origin of the word is possibly from Kikongo kalunga '(Angolan) for lake, sea, ocean', Laman 1936, 207; but also in senses 'proper name' and 'in the depths, right at the bottom, in the heart of the earth'. Patrick also notes Bettelheim (1979, 323), as quoted in Ryman (1984, 84), that \\"kalunga is also the name of an underworld deity and/or the home of this god\\".http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~patrickp/papers/RecentJCwords.html#k A version of the Glossary in Patrick's article in the journal American Speech in Fall 1995, 70(3):227-264. This false etymology is easily disputed, however. Kananga water clearly gets its name from its main component, Ylang Ylang, also known as \\"cananga odorata\\". As far as reporting on the use of the water is concerned Patrick reports that it has been quoted by Patterson (1964) as being a type of \\"holy water\\" that is used for purification in revival ceremonies. Quoting Patterson \\"male church leader, Shepherd John, cleansing a sinful woman: \\"'Bring de robe an' de cananga water an' call de Water Mother.' The period of cleansing began with a purity bath. [Shepherd John] sprinkled some of the cananga water over the room, then poured the rest in the tub. Then the water mother came forward, helped her in the tub, and bathed her from the neck downwards.\\"  References   Sources  *Laman, Karl E. 1936. Dictionnaire Kikongo-Francais. Brussels.

They were modelled on the Almanach des Muses published in Paris from 1765. Development in the 1770s The first example was Johann Christian Dieterich's G√∂ttinger Musenalmanach (GMA) of 1770. It was promoted by the mathematician Abraham Gotthelf K√§stner, and published by Heinrich Christian Boie (in partnership with Friedrich Wilhelm Gotter). As a literary outlet for students at the University of G√∂ttingen, it received contributions from Johann Heinrich Voss, Ludwig Christoph Heinrich H√∂lty, Johann Martin Miller and his relative Gottlob Dietrich Miller, Johann Friedrich Hahn, Johann Thomas Ludwig Wehrs, Johann Anton Leisewitz, and others. In 1774 Boie made Voss editor, but Voss soon left for Hamburg and started a competing almanac; in spring 1775, he was replaced by Leopold Friedrich G√ºnther Goeckingk; he was joined the next year by Gottfried August B√ºrger, who became sole editor in 1779. After B√ºrger's death in 1795 he was replaced by Karl Reinhard. A semi-pirated imitation by Engelhard Benjamin Schwickert, Leipziger Almanach der deutschen Musen, simultaneously appeared in Leipzig. Despite including nineteen stolen items, it was on sale before the GMA. The editor was Christian Heinrich Schmid, and in subsequent years it would include the work of Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock, Christian F√ºrchtegott Gellert, Johann Wilhelm Ludwig Gleim and Karl Wilhelm Ramler. From 1776 it was titled Leipziger Musen-Almanach, and from 1782 Benjamin took over as editor. The third almanac to appear was that of the Johann Heinrich Voss previously mentioned, the Hamburger Musenalmanach. The first issue of 1776 lost money, and Voss transferred management to Carl Ernst Bohn, but continued to edit, with the help (from 1779 to 1786) of Goeckingk. In Vienna in 1777, the Wienerischer Musenalmanach (or Wiener Musen- Almanach from 1786) appeared. The editor was Joseph Franz von Ratschky, and he was joined by Aloys Blumauer in 1781, and later by Gottlieb von Leon and Martin Joseph Prandst√§tter. The last issue appeared in 1796. Schiller's Musenalmanach Schiller's Musenalmanach (1796) Other similar almanacs were less successful, including Friedrich Schiller's Anthologie (1782) which only appeared once. His second attempt was Musen-Almanach (1796‚Äì1800) which is the most famous example in the entire genre, because of the contributors: Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Johann Gottfried Herder, Ludwig Tieck, Friedrich H√∂lderlin and August Wilhelm Schlegel. Inspired by his example, there followed Musenalmanache by August Wilhelm Schlegel and Ludwig Tieck (T√ºbingen 1802), by Johann Bernhard Vermehren (Leipzig 1802 and Jena 1803), the Musenalmanach by Adelbert von Chamisso and Karl August Varnhagen von Ense (1804‚Äì1806), the Poetische Taschenbuch of Friedrich Schlegel (Berlin 1805‚Äì1806) and the Musenalmanach edited by Leo von Seckendorf (Regensburg 1807‚Äì1808). Mass marketing, and Taschenb√ºcher The heyday of the almanac was perhaps the 1820s, during which decade they gradually began to appear in England in an etiolated form as literary annuals. In 1823, a writer in the European Magazine of London commented: :In Germany, the most popular species of work is what is called their Almanacs. The booksellers are generally concerned in such speculations, and there is scarce a toilette on which one or several of them are not to be found. Such works contain the coups d'essai of swarms of maiden authors, and with the ephemeral and lighter pieces of writers whose reputation is established. Some of these Almanacs are of a more serious and useful character, and the whole of them are generally bound with taste and fancy, and are ornamented with elegant engravings.Philological Society (Great Britain). \\"Literary and Scientific Intelligence, Foreign and Domestic. -- Munich.\\" From The European magazine, and London review. Volume 84 (1823), page 366. The Musen-Almanach was gradually superseded by the Taschenbuch (\\"pocket book\\") and by the literary magazine as we know it today -- some still bearing the word Musenalmanach in their titles. However, short-lived annuals of the same kind continued to appear as late as the 1860s.

It is a low, spreading shrub with densely hairy branches, thick, elliptic to egg-shaped leaves clustered on short shoots, and violet to mid-purple flowers that are white with orange and dark purple dots inside the petal tube. Description Prostanthera eurybioides is a low, spreading shrub that typically grows to less than high and wide and has more or less cylindrical, densely hairy branches. The leaves are thick, elliptical to egg- shaped, strongly aromatic when crushed, long and wide, clustered on short shoots and sessile. The flowers are arranged singly in twelve to fourteen leaf axils near the ends of branchlets, each flower on a pedicel long. The sepals form a tube long with two lobes, the lower lobe long, the upper lobe long. The petals are long, form a tube long, and are violet to mid-purple and white with orange and dark purple dots inside the tube. The lower lip of the petal tube has three lobes, the centre lobe spatula-shaped, long and wide and the side lobes long and wide. The upper lip is egg-shaped, long and wide with a central notch deep. Flowering occurs from September to November. Taxonomy Prostanthera eurybioides was first formally described in 1855 by Ferdinand von Mueller in his book Definitions of rare or hitherto undescribed Australian plants. Distribution and habitat Monarto mintbush grows amongst granite outcrops in mallee woodland in the Monarto and Mount Monster areas. Conservation status This mintbush is classified as \\"endangered\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the Government of South Australia National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972. The main threats to the species are land clearing, quarry operation at Mount Monster, weed invasion, illegal rubbish dumping, trampling by walkers, and trail bike damage.

Biography Early life and education William Hafey was born in Chicopee, Massachusetts, to James and Catherine (n√©e Mulcahy) Hafey. He attended Holy Cross College in Worcester, from where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts in 1909. From 1909 to 1910, he studied at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C. He then attended Mount St. Mary's Seminary in Emmitsburg, Maryland. Ordination and ministry Hafey was ordained to the priesthood on June 16, 1914. He then served as a curate at St. Joseph's Church in Baltimore until 1920, when he became chancellor of the Archdiocese of Baltimore. Bishop of Raleigh On April 6, 1925, Hafey was appointed the first Bishop of Raleigh, North Carolina, by Pope Pius XI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following June 24 from Archbishop Michael Joseph Curley at the Baltimore Cathedral. Bishops Thomas Michael O'Leary and Michael Joseph Keyes, S.M., served as co- consecrators. Bishop of Scranton Bishop Hafey was named Coadjutor Bishop of Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Titular Bishop of Appia on October 2, 1937. He later succeeded the late Thomas Charles O'Reilly as the fourth Bishop of Scranton on March 25, 1938. He created new parishes, multiplied the number of buildings, and increased the number of priests and religious. He was also dedicated to social needs such as education, health care, and youth activities. He later died at age 66. A former Hazleton high school was named Bishop Hafey High School in his memory. In 1958, the newly established Knights of Columbus Bishop Hafey Council 4507, of High Point, North Carolina, was named in memory of Bishop William Joseph Hafey. At that time, High Point was part of the Diocese of Raleigh. Since its creation in 1971, the Diocese of Charlotte has included High Point.

As of 2014, 26 states have contracts with MCOs to deliver long-term care for the elderly and individuals with disabilities. There are two main forms of Medicaid managed care, \\"risk-based MCOs\\" and \\"primary care case management (PCCM).\\" Managed care delivery systems grew rapidly in the Medicaid program during the 1990s. In 1991, 2.7 million beneficiaries were enrolled in some form of managed care. Currently, managed care is the most common health care delivery system in Medicaid. In 2007, nearly two-thirds of all Medicaid beneficiaries are enrolled in some form of managed care ‚Äì mostly, traditional health maintenance organizations (HMO) and primary care case management (PCCM) arrangements. This amounted to 29 million beneficiaries, of which 19 million individuals were covered by fully capitated arrangements and 5.8 million were enrolled in Primary Care Case Management. During this time, states increasingly turned to health plans already serving the public coverage programs such as Medicaid and SCHIP to operationalize expansions of coverage to uninsured populations. States used health plans as a platform for expansions and reforms because of their track record of controlling costs in public coverage programs while improving the quality of and access to care. A variety of different types of health plans serve Medicaid managed care programs, including for-profit and not-for-profit, Medicaid-focused and commercial, independent and owned by health care providers such as community health centers. In 2007, 350 health plans offered Medicaid coverage. Of those, 147 were Medicaid-focused health plans that specialize in serving the unique needs of Medicaid and other public program beneficiaries. Over 11 million are enrolled in Medicaid focused health plans . All states except Alaska, and Wyoming have all, or a portion of, their Medicaid population enrolled in an MCO. States can make managed care enrollment voluntary, or seek a waiver from CMS to require certain populations to enroll in an MCO. If states provide a choice of at least two plans, they can mandate enrollment in managed care. Healthy children and families make up the majority of Medicaid managed care enrollees, but an increasing number of states are expanding managed care to previously excluded groups, such as people with disabilities, pregnant women, and children in foster care. In 2003, Hudson Health Plan implemented a patient-specific pay for performance (P4P) model to increase immunization rates and diabetes care for Medicaid managed care recipients.

In 2002, at the urging of LIFT founders Malcolm Petal and John J Anderson, Louisiana passed a first-in-the-nation incentive program to compete directly with Canada. LIFT quickly leveraged those incentives to become one of the largest global manufacturers of made-for-television movies, low-budget feature films, music videos, and commercials. During its first five years of operation, LIFT was responsible for well over a billion dollars in production. By 2007 LIFT had spread throughout the State of Louisiana, as well as opening satellite Production Houses in Arizona and Connecticut. It had also broken ground on a $200,000,000 production complex in Downtown New Orleans. However, in June 2007 Federal Bureau of Investigation agents raided LIFT's offices, making sweeping accusations of fraud, money laundering, and tax evasion, valued at tens of millions of dollars. Despite the sensational allegations, the investigation petered out, officially closing in 2009 without uncovering any crimes, fraud or abuse at LIFT. CEO and Founder Malcolm Petal pleaded guilty in an unrelated bribery case. By that time, though, LIFT was a defunct organization. Its creditors continue to sue the State of Louisiana which refuses to honor tax incentives promised to LIFT, despite the fact that LIFT was cleared of any wrongdoing.Filings in the 19th Judicial District of Louisiana (East Baton Rouge Parish).

The duo testified that Louisiana could become immediately competitive with much larger markets by recruiting U.S.-based productions back from Canada. The legislature enacted the first of several incentive packages proposed by the LIFT founders on June 1, 2002. That same month LIFT officially opened its doors. During its early days LIFT concentrated primarily on music videos and commercials. Through its partnership with HSI Productions of California, LIFT produced a continuous stream of videos for a wide array of artists, including Mariah Carey, Jessica Simpson and LeAnn Rimes, as well as several national ad campaigns, including memorable spots for Lincoln and Payless Shoes. The tax credit program was widely recognized and hailed for its generosity - applying to music videos and commercials, as well as films and television, and also because there was no ceiling on how much credit can be accrued per production or per year. Three separate sets of production initiatives - a sales tax exemption, a labor tax credit encouraging productions to hire Louisiana labor and an investor tax credit that offered credit on as much as 15% on overall production costs.Woodward, Sarah.

As Petal stated at LIFT's opening of its Shreveport facility, \\"Louisiana's incentive program has given it the opportunity to be the hub of the international Production industry in the 21st Century, but that only can take place if it is a statewide effort.

October 20, 2006. Treme film studio work begins. http://www.louisianaentertainment.gov/film/content.cfm?new=910&id;=64 On October 19, 2006 Film Factory officially broke ground, with a golden shovel ceremony officiated by Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco, New Orleans Mayor C. Ray Nagin, and his political opponent Lieutenant Governor, Mitch Landrieu. Completion was scheduled for the last quarter of 2008. The vertically- integrated business boasted a $180,000,000 development deal with Element Films (the movie division of billionaire club impresario Sam Nazarian's SBE Entertainment empire) and a $50,000,000 revolving line of credit with Merrill- Lynch to distribute films through Lions Gate and MGM. If successful, the Film Factory would have transformed LIFT into a major studio, and catapulted New Orleans' economic standing well past its regional competitors, putting it on an economic footing with New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago. Within 5 years the development‚Äôs 12-month vocational school was to train 750 local residents per year for the high-paying jobs in the Louisiana production market. \\"From carpenters to hairdressers; from electricians to graphic artists; from visual artists to caterers, there is a career in the Film industry for every ambition and natural talent,\\" announced CEO Petal at the Film Factory ground-breaking. \\"And what's more these are union jobs, with pension and health benefits, and starting salaries from $20 to $45 per hour. These are careers that will allow the people of Treme to build dignified lives on single salaries, own homes, pay for college.\\" The City's Executive Director of Arts and Entertainment, Ernest Collins, and Rep. Steve Scalise R-Jefferson expressed the importance of this infrastructure development to the sustainability of the film industry in Louisiana. Petal stated at the time \\"We've brought a lot of the industry here with cash. The trick is to not have that be the sole reason people come here. We have to try to leverage the tax incentives to build a more well-rounded industry... This will show people that they can build a career here. People have to feel that it's real to invest time in it.\\" FBI raid On June 1, 2007 FBI and IRS agents raided LIFT's offices. Unnamed Federal sources and news reports indicated that the U.S. Attorney's office believed LIFT had been involved in massive fraud. Some estimates topped $100,000,000. The underwriters of the Film Factory soon withdrew. LIFT tried to maintain its business, but the Louisiana Department of Economic Development banned all LIFT-related productions in the midst of all the publicity, drying up all of its development and distribution deals. The multi-agency U.S. Department of Justice investigation lasted over five years and cast a wide net, serving grand jury subpoenas on major Hollywood studios, law firms, brokerages, and CPAs. FBI and IRS agents from New York, Ohio, Texas and California expended thousands of man-hours, including multiple interviews of Kevin Kostner (the star of the LIFT release, \\"Mr. Brooks\\"). Despite its wide scope, the investigation failed to turn up any evidence of fraud or abuse of tax credits, as United States Attorney James B. Letten had proclaimed at the outset. William Bradley, an attorney who sometimes represented LIFT pleaded guilty to paying a bribe to Mark Smith,Former Louisiana state film recruiter pleads guilty to taking bribes to inflate tax credits, By Michael Kunzelman, Associated Press Writer, September 7, 2007 the Louisiana Film Commissioner, in a matter unrelated to LIFT. He admitted receiving a $135,000 fee from LIFT CEO Malcolm Petal to help convince the State of Louisiana to allow popular music festivals like JazzFest, Essence, and Voodoo to utilize the film tax credits for their productions. Petal feared that without government assistance, New Orleans would lose these festivals in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Bradley admitted he paid $65,000 of that fee to Smith, but that Petal had no direct knowledge of the payment. Petal pleaded guilty to conspiracy to bribe in the matter.Russell, Gordon. March 5, 2009. ‚ÄúMiddleman in film tax-credit scheme pleads guilty‚Äù Gordon The Times-Picayune. http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2009/03/middleman_in_film_taxcredit_sc.html and received the maximum 5-year sentence.Film producer sentenced in La. bribe scheme, By Michael Kunzelman, Associated Press Writer, April 23, 2009. Associated Press Archive During his sentencing proceedings the United States' Attorney's office admitted they had not proved any actual harm caused by the bribe, any gain to Petal, or that Petal had any knowledge that Bradley hade made payments to Smith. Nevertheless, Eastern District of Louisiana Judge Lance Africk, a personal friend of United States Attorney Letten, sentenced Petal to the maximum 60 months in prison. Judge Africk stated that Petal need not know of the bribe itself to be guilty of conspiracy to bribe, because in a conspiracy \\"the right hand does not need to know what the left hand is doing.\\" He opined that the maximum sentence was warranted due to the seriousness of the offense and that Petal had lost his moral compass. Litigation On January 5, 2014, after seven years of litigation by the State of Louisiana, claiming LIFT and Petal had committed fraud, a final judgment was issued stating tersely that the State of Louisiana \\"would like [LIFT's actions] to be considered a fraud perpetrated by an unscrupulous businessman [Petal]. The evidence presented does not support this conclusion.\\" LIFT v. LED, American Arbitration Association Case No.691400023208 (2014). In April 2014 a Federal Judge threw out the State of Louisiana's claim that LIFT owed them for over- payment or inflation of tax credits as meritless. In Re: LIFT, Chapter 11 (East. Dist. Of Louis. 2011). In February 2015, an independent arbitrator ordered the State of Louisiana to pay the first $6.5MM in almost $60MM in tax credits owed to LIFT. LIFT v. LED, American Arbitration Association Case No.691400023208 (2015). In October 2015, several state officials, including the Secretaries of Economic Development and Revenue were held in contempt of court by a Federal judge for failing to comply with the Federal arbitration decision and LIFT filed a $400MM Civil Rights lawsuit based on the State Officials concerted efforts to keep them out of business and thwart the economic development of New Orleans.In Re: LIFT, Chapter 11 (East. Dist. Of Louis. 2011); and Film Factory vs. Grissom, Barfield, and Moret (East. Dist of Louis. 2015). Today As a result of LIFT's successful efforts to compete with international incentives, Louisiana is now the second largest production state behind California, and 39 other States have passed film incentives in the last decade. However, LIFT's vision of utilizing the credits as a lever for broad economic development has not been adopted by any other actors, and the programs remain large give-aways to film studios, justified mainly for the public relations value of attracting film and television to one's community. Malcolm Petal died on June 29, 2017 at the age of 47.

Salacgrƒ´va municipality is bordered by Aloja and Limba≈æi municipalities and Estonian P√§rnu circuit. The centre of the municipality is Salacgrƒ´va. Nature 4 species of shellfish can be found in the coastal municipality of Salacgrƒ´va: soft-shell clam (Mya arenaria), Baltic clam (Macoma Baltica), lagoon cockle (Cerastoderma glaucum), and the bay mussel (Mytilus trossulus). Aforetime locals used shellfish as a feed for chicken, as such diet provided stronger egg shells. Salacgrƒ´va district is a part of the North Vidzeme Biosphere Reserve, and a nature reserve \\"Vidzemes akme≈ÜainƒÅ j≈´rmala\\" (Rocky Seashore of Vidzeme) lies within the area of the municipality. The size of this nature reserve is 3370 ha and it takes up 12 km of the sea cost of Vidzeme. Very rare and protected habitats, which are not present elsewhere in Latvian, are abundant in this area. The beaches are covered with stones and pebbles, meadows, foredunes or white dunes. Between beaches and forests an unusual habitat - Grey dunes ‚Äì is hidden. Sandstone outcrops can be seen on the sea shore. Typical as well as rare and protected species and habitats can be found on the Stony beach. The boulders, which are located on the underwater part of the water level, serve as \\"brakes\\" during strong winds and storms, protecting the shore and forelands from erosion. The sandstone which can be seen in the outcrops of \\"Vidzemes akme≈ÜainajƒÅ j≈´rmalƒÅ\\" (rocky seashore of Vidzeme) has formed over 350 million years ago. The largest outcrop on Vidzeme coast is the Veczemju cliffs. History An axe from the Stone Age has been found in the area of the current Salacgrƒ´va rural area, suggesting very ancient settlements in this area. It is, however, clearly known that Salaca region has historically been inhabited by Livs. The Livonian chronicle of Henry mentions times when the area in Salacgrƒ´va municipality was owned by Metsepole County, where, already in 1205, the priest Alobrand - a Catholic priest and one of the first missionaries in Livonia ‚Äì established a church and took up a Christian preaching mission. Archaeological works by Juris UrtƒÅns in 1973 confirmed that during the 14th century there had been ancient places of worship and sacrifice on the right bank of Svƒìtupe River, near Kuiƒ∑uƒºi. The area hosts two ancient Liv sacrificial caves, whose rocks have been formed as a geological object during the middle Devonian period about 400 million years ago. The smaller cave is low and narrow, 46 m long, but the largest one ‚Äì 19.5 m long and up to 2 metres high. On the walls of the cave ancient drawings, traditional Latvian signs have been discovered ‚Äì such as Jumis, Lietuvƒìna cross and others. In the anteroom hall of the cave, 628 coins, 35 antiques, and organic stem donations were found. Already during the 13th century Salacgrƒ´va became a centre for shipping and trade of Bishop Albert, since the geographical situation of Salacgrƒ´va allowed the goods to be delivered both by water and by road, consequently developing the whole area. A necessity for a traffic network from Salacgrƒ´va to Limba≈æi emerged. Due to development of trade, Salaca region became one of the most intense areas in traffic intensity in Latvia in the 14th century. In 1908 a ferroconcrete bridge over Salaca was built in Vecsalaca, which was opened a year later, on 13 June. At that time concrete was a new construction material, which was introduced here before other provinces of Russian empire due to German Construction Company ‚ÄúWayss and Freytag A.G.‚Äù, which was very active in Latvia at that time. Annasmui≈æa Ferroconcrete Bridge is one of two bridges on gravel roads of Latvia that have been conserved fragmentarily from the beginning of the era of ferroconcrete. After the declaration of independence, the current area of Salacgrƒ´va municipality was divided between parishes of Salaca and Svƒìtciems. 2 primary schools operated in Salaca parish - Ausekƒºu 1.degree school and Korƒ£enes 6 year school. Seven teachers worked in these schools, teaching 231 student. In 1937, there were 2520 inhabitants in Salaca parish, 129 old farms, 145 new farms and 66 small farms. At the same time, 1750 people lived in Svƒìtciems parish; there were 56 old farms, 163 new farms and 27 small farms. One six- year school operated in the parish with 3 teachers who taught 86 students. In 1928 the Ministry of Agriculture created a horse farm in Svƒìtciems, where Hannover horses were raised. In 1937 the description of agricultural lands was adverse, as two unfavourable types of soil predominated ‚Äì sand and tough clay. The main income, however, was provided by agriculture. Locals provided for themselves also through fishing in the sea and river, cutting forests in winter and flooding trees in spring. After the establishment of Soviet rule, parishes were gradually eliminated, forming three villages instead of Salaca and Svƒìtciems parishes ‚Äì Zonepe, Korƒ£ene and Salaca village. Administrative division Salacgrƒ´va district is divided into 5 territorial units: Aina≈æi town, Salacgrƒ´va town, Salacgrƒ´va, Aina≈æi and Liepupe parishes. Populated areas The largest populated areas in Salacgrƒ´va district are as follow: Salacgrƒ´va, Aina≈æi, Dunte, Dunte school, Mustkalni, Liepupe, Jelgavkrasti, Lembu≈æi, Prinkas, T≈´jasmui≈æa, T≈´ja, Me≈æciems, ƒ∂umrags, Meleki, Vitrupe, ≈†ƒ∑irstciems, LƒÅ≈Üi, Svƒìtciems, Vecsalaca, Korƒ£ene, Kuivi≈æi and Mƒìrnieki. Population dynamics Judging of the data of citizenship and migration, on 1 January 2015, there were 8685 inhabitants in Salacgrƒ´va municipality. Local government The council of Salacgrƒ´va municipality consists of 15 elected members: Dagnis Straubergs, Ilona Balode, Dace Martinsone, Skaidrƒ´te Eglƒ´te, Lija Jokste, Andris Zunde, Aija Kirhen≈°teina, JƒÅnis Cƒ´rulis, MƒÅris Trankalis, Sanita ≈†lekona, Gints ≈†mits, Normunds Tiesnesis, Inga ƒåekaƒºina, Aleksandrs Rozen≈°teins who represent the political party Reƒ£ionu Alianse, and Alda Ansberga, who represents the political party Visu Latvijai-Tƒìvzemei un Brƒ´vƒ´bai/LNNK. Education On the 17th century a parish school was established in Jaunsalaca district. In the beginning, it had 7 students. Literacy spread rather quickly and already in 1788, there were 144 boys, and 102 girls, 125 men and 68 women, studying in Jaunsalaca parish school. In the 19th century this school developed even further, offering a 2-3 year course and accepting only parish school graduates, who were 14‚Äì16 years old. Education has a price, therefore the parents who wanted to have their children educated, had to pay 6-7 roubles a year for the school. This meant that only the richest landlords and they children had the chance to get education. By the end of the 20th century there were xxx students and a teacher received a salary of 504 roubles a month. In the middle of the 19th century, a massive switch to orthodoxy was characteristic in the poor seashore areas, as the Russian Tsar had promised to grant lands to people who would accept orthodoxy. In relation to this, in 1805 an orthodox parish school was opened in Salacgrƒ´va, while special schools with a single teacher working there, were established in Vecsalaca and Svƒìtciems. Currently there are secondary schools in Salacgrƒ´va and Liepupe and primary schools in Aina≈æi and Korƒ£ene. Sports The municipality of Salacgrƒ´va and municipality of Limba≈æi have jointly established a sports school - Limba≈æi and Salacgrƒ´va municipality Sports school. Most popular sport in Salacgrƒ´va is basketball. Basketball club Salacgrƒ´va is the main organization that develops basketball. The Senior team is BK Salacgrƒ´va that is participating in Latvian basketball league third division. The club consists of four teams - BK Salacgrƒ´va, Grƒ´va, Kopturis-A, Salacgrƒ´vas vidusskola. Main organized events are \\"Beach streetball\\" in Salacgrƒ´va seashore, \\"Salacgrƒ´vas Krastu maƒçs\\" where the river Salaca divides teams in two - one team represents the left side of the municipality, the other the right side. Basketball klub Salacgrƒ´va is the champions of Latvian basketball league third division in 2014 Culture Aina≈æi culture house. The cultural association of Aina≈æi was established in 1926, with a dance group and a choir that were active at that time. The culture house was built in 1928, with 2 men - JƒÅnis Asars and Remberts Rungainis donating large funds for its construction. The culture house has been built after the project of P. Kundzi≈Ü≈° and it has been granted the status of Cultural Heritage of Europe since 1966. Since the construction of this building, it has been exclusively used only as a culture house. Independence Day, as well as other holidays and events are regularly celebrated here.

Arsenius‚Äôs orthodox church - 1889, in an orthodox church was established in Aina≈æi. The number of Russian-speakers was very little, therefore the Russian tsar promised land to people who would accept orthodox Christianity. As a result, in 1894-1895 the congregation was wealthy enough to be able to build a church. During the Second World War the German troops removed the bell of the Orthodox Church in order to melt it into s-curve cannon. During the Soviet rule the activities of the church had ceased, and it returned only in 1995. Evangelical Lutheran church of Liepupe Church - the church was built in 1784, but it turned into ashes in 1970.

Manila, the capital of the former Commonwealth of the Philippines, had been devastated during the war. Many universities, utilised for military purposes, were in ruins. Knowing that the education of young people was a vital necessity for the country to get back on its feet, a number of Alpha Phi Omega members in Texas and the Pacific Northwest, having served as soldiers in the Philippines, organised book drives on their campuses. The successful project gathered hundreds of textbooks, used but usable, from libraries and students and sent to the Philippines to help re-stock the many burnt-out college libraries in Manila. A few years later, in January 1950, Sol George Levy (Gamma Alpha chapter @ University of Washington 1947), a professional Scouter, an Alpha Phi Omega brother at the University of Washington in Seattle, and a friend of APO National President Dr. H. Roe \\"The Chief\\" Bartle who served as president of Alpha Phi Omega from 1931 to 1946, went to the Philippines to generate interest among Scouts there. One evening, Levy spoke to a group of people about APO, Scouting's national service fraternity in the U.S., and its service project which donated books to Philippine schools. He also distributed copies of three APO publications: Questions and Answers, National Constitution and By-laws, and Ritual, Rites and Ceremonies. In the audience was Librado Inocencio Ureta, then taking his MA in education at the Far Eastern University in Manila. Ureta and a group of former Scouts founded Alpha Phi Omega in the Philippines on March 2, 1950, at Room 214, Nicanor Reyes Hall, Far Eastern University, Manila. Alpha Phi Omega grew rapidly in the Philippines. In its third year, it became a national organization with seven chapters chartered in Manila and Visayan campuses. It was registered October 21, 1953, with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a non-stock, non-profit, non-dividend corporation with a registered name of Alpha Phi Omega International Collegiate Service Fraternity. The registration was renewed on June 8, 1981, with the SEC Registration No. 0099381 under the name of Alpha Phi Omega International Philippines Incorporated. right Notable members in the Philippines Presidents *Librado I.

The ship was built as Shawmut for the Boston Steamship Company by the Maryland Steel Company, Sparrows Point, Maryland and put into Pacific service operating out of Puget Sound ports for Japan, China and the Philippine Islands. Shawmut and sister ship Tremont were two of the largest United States commercial ships in service at the time and the company eventually found them too expensive to operate. Shawmut and Tremont were acquired by the United States Government through the agency of the Panama Railroad Company's Panama Railroad Steamship Line, whose assets were entirely owned by the government and critical to construction of the canal, to serve between New York and the Atlantic terminus during canal construction. Both ships were renamed for features of the canal; Shawmut for the Pacific side terminus Ancon and Tremont as for the Canal's Atlantic port. Though not the first vessel to make a complete transit, Ancon made the first official and ceremonial transit with a delegation of some two hundred dignitaries aboard. After the end of World War I the ship saw very brief service from 28 March to 25 July 1919 as a commissioned United States Ship, USS Ancon (ID-1467), making two round trip voyages from the New York Port of Embarkation to France returning troops home. Ancon was returned to Panama Canal service and was in service with the canal until 1939 when the ship was sold to private parties known as the Permanente Steamship Company and renamed Permanente. Construction and design  The steamer was constructed by Maryland Steel, Sparrows Point, Maryland for the Boston Steamship Line as the SS Shawmut launched December 1901 and completed in 1902.Lloyd's Register, 1906 The launch date is given as \\"today\\" in a piece in the New York Times datelined December 21, 1901 and published on 22 December while the journal Marine Engineering gives the date as 23 December.The New York Times published 22 December 1901 release gives the launch \\"today\\" in a piece datelined 21 December. The Marine Engineering January 1902 issue gives the date of 23 December 1901. A \\"data card\\" the journal Marine Engineering published with some major ship articles for retention by readers states \\"Launched January 1902\\" with ship's characteristics but the card was probably prepared early for publication in the January issue. The journal's articles for January publication, perhaps based on scheduled times, were probably being prepared about the time of launch with the daily newspaper's article likely more current.  Commercial service  Shawmut was put into service by the Boston Steamship Company in association with the Northern Pacific and Great Northern Railways acting as booking agents with monthly passenger and freight sailings from Puget Sound ports of Tacoma and Seattle, Washington and Victoria, British Columbia to Yokohama, Kobe and Moji, Japan; Shanghai and Hong Kong, China and Manila, Philippines. Shawmut's maiden voyage led to questions about whether such large ships could be profitable with specific questions concerning even larger ships being built by James J. Hill for trans Pacific trade. The ship had arrived in Seattle to begin loading for the voyage on 22 July 1902 sailing for Tacoma on 25 July to load cargo, largely of lumber that had to be transshipped due to the fact the ship was too large to enter the lumber port, and took until 22 August to fully load cargo from scattered origins. She sailed on 22 August with a stop at Seattle before proceeding to sea that night and reached Yokohama 12 September unloading a small consignment. The lumber was destined for Shanghai, but the ship was too large to reach the docks on arrival 20 September and had to unload by lighter taking until 13 October before departure for Hong Kong. On reaching Hong Kong 18 October where there was little cargo to load and only a small amount to carry on to Manila upon departure 8 November. By 22 November Shawmut was in Yokohama for a final stop before departure for Seattle on 23 November where she arrived 8 December, 139 days for the voyage. The ship had carried a then record breaking 13,000 tons of cargo, but returned with only about 2,500 tons and an estimated deficit of over $21,000 for the trip. There was speculation that Hill had used a Boston company to \\"experiment\\" on using large ships for the trade before committing his vessels. The ship had arrived in Yokohama early in the Russo-Japanese War reporting Japanese torpedo boats hundreds of miles at sea investigating all ships. She departed Yokohama with Jewish businessmen from the Russian port of Vladivostok who had been suddenly ordered out by Russian authorities and escaped through Korea where Japanese authorities had detained them before bringing them to Yokohama where they boarded Shawmut which had reached Seattle in late March. The ship was also under close surveillance by Japanese \\"special service agents\\" who even kept a guard at one passenger's door. Among the passengers bound for Seattle were 235 Filipinos on the way to the St. Louis World's Fair along with material for the Filipino and Japanese villages at the fair. Shawmut sailed for Japan again on 16 July 1904 with 15,000 tons of cargo that included 900,000 pounds of canned beef destined for Kobe, Japan and was at sea when a cable from London instructed marine insurance agents to not accept risks on ships or cargoes for Japan for fear of seizure by belligerents. Shawmut had grounded off the coast of China in the fall of 1904 due to weather suffering loss of her rudder, propellers and suffering a double fracture to her stern frame and \\"spectacle\\" supports for her propellers but, after repair in an overseas dry dock, managed a return to home waters and one round trip before making permanent repairs. The replacement stern frame and propeller supports were built by the ship's original builder and sent to Seattle to meet the ship there in January 1905 for the permanent repair. Moran Brothers' Company of Seattle proposed to do the repairs using the only dry dock of sufficient size, the naval dry dock at Bremerton, but the Navy's charges were \\"exorbitant\\" and Moran devised a means of using their small floating dry dock to do the repairs by only lifting the stern of Shawmut using a cofferdam to seal and de-water the work space. By 1907 predictions of economic trouble had become fact with Shawmut and Tremont withdrawn from Pacific service and replaced in the Philippine trade by the British firm of Andrew Weir and Company. The consequence, in the words of His Majesty's consul in Manila in his report for 1907, was that \\"the American flag disappears from the Pacific trade with the single exception of the Northern Pacific Steamship Company's passenger-freighter Minnesota.\\"The referenced would be the 20,602 ton ship of 1904, a predecessor of Northern Pacific's and sister of , that was built by Eastern Shipbuilding Company, New London, Connecticut and sold for scrap in 1923. By October 1908 the annual meeting of the Boston Steamship Company was reported to be postponed pending news of the sale of both Shawmut and Tremont because the company stated they could not be operated without a subsidy.  The Panama Canal service  In 1909 the ship was purchased by the Panama Canal. The ship was renamed for the Panama Canal's Pacific side terminus at Ancon. Both Ancon and her sister ship Cristobal operated under The Panama Railroad Company's Panama Railroad Steamship Line. Both ships played a crucial role in building the canal, bringing workers and supplies, notably massive amounts of cement, from New York to Panama for the construction project.David McCullough, The Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal 1870‚Äì1914, Simon and Schuster (1977) p. 594 On 15 August 1914 Ancon made the first official transit of the canal as part of the canal's opening ceremonies. (Her sister ship Cristobal had made the first unofficial transit on 3 August, delivering a load of cement, while an old French crane boat Alexandre La Valley had crossed the canal from the Atlantic in stages during construction, finally reaching the Pacific on 7 January.)McCullough, pp. 607‚Äì609 Five days after the end of World War I, on 16 November 1918, Ancon was acquired at New Orleans by the United States Navy from the Department of War (Army) and commissioned on 28 March 1919 under the command of Lt. Comdr. Milan L. Pittman, USNRF as the troop transport USS Ancon (ID-1467). The ship was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet's Cruiser and Transport Force making two round-trip voyages from the United States to France returning troops home. On completion of the second voyage Ancon was decommissioned at New York City on 25 July 1919 and returned to the War Department. The Panama Railroad Company replaced SS Ancon in 1938 with a larger steam turbine cargo liner named Ancon which later saw considerable action as the Navy command and communications ship in World War II. The old Ancon remained in Panama Canal service as Ex Ancon until sold privately.

The focus of this article is on the effects beyond 2100. There are expected to be various long-term effects of global warming. Most discussion and research, including that by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, concentrates on the effects of global warming up to 2100, with only an outline of the effects beyond this. Ice loss and sea level rise Larsen B Shelf, showing the diminishing extent of the shelf from 1998 to 2002 Meltwater from melting ice sheets and glacier retreat contributes to a rise in the future sea level. Antarctica Concern has been expressed about the stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS). In 2002 Vaughan & Spouge argued that the \\"WAIS most likely will not collapse in the next few centuries.\\" In an inaugural article for members of the National Academy of Sciences elected in 2005, Timothy Lenton and others suggest that a collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet could occur within a millennium. Specifically, they state \\"Although the timescale is highly uncertain, a qualitative WAIS change could occur within this millennium, with collapse within 300 years being a worst-case scenario. Rapid sea-level rise (greater than 1 m per century) is more likely to come from the WAIS than from the Greenland ice sheet.\\". A study in 2015 found that assuming cumulative fossil fuel emissions of 10 000 gigatonnes of carbon, the Antarctic Ice Sheet could melt completely over the following millennia, contributing 58 m to global sea-level rise, and 30 m within the first 1000 years. Greenland Greenland's ice sheet contains enough fresh water as ice to raise sea level worldwide by . Greenland may become warm enough by 2100 to begin an almost complete melt over more than 1,000 years. James E. Hansen suggests that inadequate attention is being given to this issue. One study suggests it would take 3,000 years to completely melt the Greenland ice sheet. This figure was derived from the assumed levels of greenhouse gases over the duration of the experiment. As the Greenland ice sheet loses mass from calving of icebergs as well as by melting of ice, any such processes tend to accelerate the loss of the ice sheet. Millennial- timescale events Some long-term effects happen over thousands, not hundreds, of years. Disruption to thermohaline circulation right Early work with simplified models suggested that global warming could cause a shutdown of the thermohaline circulation. This effect is not replicated in more sophisticated coupled ocean-atmosphere global climate models, which do not shutdown but do display varying degrees of slowdown. This may take a considerable time to occur, as Knutti and Stocker found, again from a simplified model, when :\\"‚Ä¶thermohaline shutdowns can occur thousands of years after the warming has stopped.\\" Ocean anoxia One study suggests that the amount of oxygen dissolved in the oceans may decline, with adverse consequences for ocean life. This effect was determined using a model run of 100,000 years. The researchers predicted: > ‚Ä¶severe, long-term ocean oxygen depletion, as well as a great expansion of > ocean oxygen-minimum zones for scenarios with high emissions or high climate > sensitivity. We find that climate feedbacks within the Earth system amplify > the strength and duration of global warming, ocean heating and oxygen > depletion. Decreased oxygen solubility from surface-layer warming accounts > for most of the enhanced oxygen depletion in the upper 500 m of the ocean. > Possible weakening of ocean overturning and convection lead to further > oxygen depletion, also in the deep ocean. Other research by the Leibniz Institute for Marine Sciences predicts that minimum oxygen zones, particularly in the Pacific, are expanding, with an estimated total reduction of ocean oxygen levels from 1% to 7% by the end of the century.Ocean Deoxygenation in a Warming World Ralph F. Keeling, Arne K√∂rtzinger, and Nicolas Gruber Clathrate decomposition Worldwide distribution of confirmed or inferred offshore gas hydrate-bearing sediments, 1996. Source: USGS Methane clathrate, also called methane hydrate, is a form of water ice that contains a large amount of methane within its crystal structure. Extremely large deposits of methane clathrate have been found under sediments on the ocean floors of Earth (estimated at 3,000‚Äì11,000 gigatonnes, or Gt, of carbon). MacDonald suggests clathrate volumes are \\"about 11,000 Gt of carbon for ocean sediments, and about 400 Gt for sediments under permafrost regions\\". Buffett and Archer predict \\"eventual releases of 2000‚Äì4000 Gt C in response to a ~2000 Gt C anthropogenic carbon release\\", for which they suggest no timescale. Archer considered the timescale and determined that \\"‚Ä¶on longer time scales of 1‚Äì10 [thousand years], there may be a positive feedback with ocean temperature, amplifying the long-term climate impact of anthropogenic release.\\"  Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere  Stabilizing the global average temperature would require large reductions in CO2 emissions, * Summary, pp. 14‚Äì19, in * FAQ 12.3, in: Chapter 12: Long-term Climate Change: Projections, Commitments and Irreversibility, in , pp. 88‚Äì89 (pp. 90‚Äì91 of PDF chapter) as well as reductions in emissions of other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide.BOX 2.1: Stabilization and Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gases (p. 65), in: Chapter 2: Emissions, Concentrations, and Related Factors, in Emissions of CO2 would need to be reduced by more than 80% relative to their peak level. Even if this were achieved, global average temperatures would remain close to their highest level for many centuries, prolonging the current interglacial period by at least 100,000 years. As of 2016, emissions of CO2 from burning fossil fuels had stopped increasing, but The Guardian reports they need to be \\"reduced to have a real impact on climate change\\". Meanwhile, this greenhouse gas continues to accumulate in the atmosphere. In that context, the New York Times reported that scientific installations analyzing oceanic air detected the excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere \\"rose at the highest rate on record in 2015 and 2016.\\" It has been suggested that this rise in CO2 levels is the result of changing absorption patterns of the ocean and land surface in that they may have reached the limit of their ability to absorb carbon dioxide. Long-term return to equilibrium After the PETM peak there was an extended period of cooling or \\"climate whiplash\\". While the warm surface waters of the oceans have limited ability to absorb anthropogenic carbon dioxide, the coldest surface waters near the poles (2‚Äì3% of ocean surfaces) can transfer significant amounts of carbon dioxide to deep-ocean reserves. Over a period of many centuries, this process and the process of calcium carbonate absorption of carbon dioxide on land and in the oceans will remove 60‚Äì80% of the excess carbon dioxide. Igneous rock when exposed to a near surface environment absorbs carbon dioxide through a very slow weathering rate, but weathering increases in a warmer, higher rainfall climate, speeding the process. This geological weathering will absorb the remaining 20‚Äì40% of anthropogenic carbon dioxide over the period of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years. Another way to bring these long term effects back to equilibrium is to understand to nature of coupled natural and human systems. If more research is done on the feedbacks of these systems, there can be better approaches on how to mitigate the negative effects that are derived from these systems.

Wiegand, produced in specially annealed and hardened wire called Wiegand wire. Principle of a Wiegand sensor and external magnetic field Wiegand wire is low-carbon Vicalloy, a ferromagnetic alloy of cobalt, iron, and vanadium. Initially, the wire is fully annealed. In this state the alloy is \\"soft\\" in the magnetic sense; that is, it is attracted to magnets and so magnetic field lines will divert preferentially into the metal, but the metal retains only a very small residual field when the external field is removed. During manufacture, to give the wire its unique magnetic properties, it is subjected to a series of twisting and untwisting operations to cold-work the outside shell of the wire while retaining a soft core within the wire, and then the wire is aged. The result is that the magnetic coercivity of the outside shell is much larger than that of the inner core. This high coercivity outer shell will retain an external magnetic field even when the field's original source is removed. The wire now exhibits a very large magnetic hysteresis: If a magnet is brought near the wire, the high coercivity outer shell excludes the magnetic field from the inner soft core until the magnetic threshold is reached, whereupon the entire wire ‚Äî both the outer shell and inner core ‚Äî rapidly switches magnetisation polarity. This switchover occurs in a few microseconds, and is called the Wiegand effect. The value of the Wiegand effect is that the switchover speed is sufficiently fast that a significant voltage can be output from a coil using a Wiegand-wire core. Because the voltage induced by a changing magnetic field is proportional to the rate of change of the field, a Wiegand-wire core can increase the output voltage of a magnetic field sensor by several orders of magnitude as compared to a similar coil with a non-Wiegand core. This higher voltage can easily be detected electronically, and when combined with the high repeatability threshold of the magnetic field switching, making the Wiegand effect useful for positional sensors. Once the Wiegand wire has flipped magnetization, it will retain that magnetization until flipped in the other direction. Sensors and mechanisms that use the Wiegand effect must take this retention into account. The Wiegand effect is a macroscopic extension of the Barkhausen effect, as the special treatment of the Wiegand wire causes the wire to act macroscopically as a single large magnetic domain. The numerous small high- coercivity domains in the Wiegand wire outer shell switch in an avalanche, generating the Wiegand effect's rapid magnetic field change.  Applications   Wiegand Sensors  Wiegand sensors are magnetic sensors that make use of the Wiegand effect to generate a consistent pulse every time magnetic field polarity reverses and therefore do not rely on any external voltage or current. The consistency of the pulses produced by Wiegand sensors can be used to provide energy for low-power and energy-saving applications.  Wiegand keycards  Besides sensors, the Wiegand effect is used for security keycard door locks. The plastic keycard has a series of short lengths of Wiegand wire embedded in it, which encodes the key by the presence or absence of wires. A second track of wires provides a clock track. The card is read by pulling it through a slot in a reader device, which has a fixed magnetic field and a sensor coil. As each length of wire passes through the magnetic field, its magnetic state flips, which indicates a 1, and this is sensed by the coil. The absence of a wire indicates a 0. The resulting Wiegand protocol digital code is then sent to a host controller to determine whether to electrically unlock the door. Wiegand cards are more durable and difficult to counterfeit than bar code or magnetic stripe cards. Since the keycode is permanently set into the card at manufacture by the positions of the wires, Wiegand cards can't be erased by magnetic fields or reprogrammed as magnetic stripe cards can.  Rotary encoder  Wiegand wires are used by some rotary magnetic encoders to power the multi-turn circuitry. As the encoder revolves, the Wiegand wire core coil generates a pulse of electricity sufficient to power the encoder and write the turns count to non-volatile memory. This works at any speed of rotation and eliminates the clock/gear mechanism typically associated with multi-turn encoders.  Wheel speed sensor  Wiegand wires are fitted to the outer diameter of a wheel to measure rotational speeds. An externally mounted reading head detects the Wiegand pulses.

She is the Artistic Director of Navarasa Dance Theater. Sindhoor has trained in Bharatanatyam (one of the Indian classical dance forms) for over 20 years including 15 years with K. Venkatalakshamma, one of the foremost proponents of the Mysore style of Bharatanatyam where Abhinaya (facial expression) and graceful Jathis (pure dance compositions) are emphasized. Sindhoor has been giving accomplished professional performances since her arangetram (graduation solo recital) in 1989. Sindhoor holds a Vidwat (Master's) in dance, a Master's in English, and a bachelor's degree in Dance, literature and Dramatics. She was awarded the gold medal in 1990 for finishing first in dance at the University of Mysore. She received her doctorate in \\"Dance, Women and Culture\\" from Boston University.https://globaldanceinitiative.com/ambassador/aparna- sindhoor Since 1996 Sindhoor has been working on dance theater forms with SM Raju (Rajendran M. Sivasankaran), bringing varied art forms and styles to tell contemporary stories. Using stories such as \\"The Incident and After\\", \\"The Hunt\\", \\"Clothes\\", \\"Draupadi\\", \\"River Rites\\", written by contemporary writers, Sindhoor and Raju have created works that give a new dimension to the content and beauty of the dance performance. Using Indian classical dance, yoga, songs, martial arts, stories and folk dances they explore new ways of presenting without compromising the beauty of the forms. This has made their work more interesting and accessible to diverse audiences. Sindhoor brings in a unique blend of depth in the content, novelty in the presentation and extraordinary artistry. \\"The central theme of my work is to learn how to celebrate and accept difference, whether it is dance or life. When we accept that there are differences in people whether it is color, caste, class, artistic abilities, etc., we learn to live better and make better art. I want the colors of life to fill my dance, inspire my movement and music.\\" https://globaldanceinitiative.com/heroes1/navarasa-dance-theater Sindhoor is known for her creativity and power to push boundaries. \\"I approach dance/performance with a contemporary sensibility that emerges from my heart as a woman who is exposed to dance, music, theater, feminism, and also as someone living in two continents. Bharatanatyam dance is a celebration of the human body: the sensuous and the spiritual. In my opinion all dance forms do that. Dance is an art of celebration of the physical, emotional, and spiritual.\\" https://globaldanceinitiative.com/ambassador/aparna-sindhoor She has conceived and choreographed over 20 full-length dance works. She was awarded grants from the Human Resource Development Agency, Government of India, for her dance works, Vachanadara and A Concise Portrait of Indian Woman. In these works she has expanded the boundaries of the traditional Bharatanatyam recital in terms of the subject, style and production. In A Concise Portrait of Indian Woman, she used regional folk dance as part of the choreography, along with classical dance. She was sponsored by Urban Bush Women to attend the A New Dancer for a New Society workshop at Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida, in the summer of 1997. She has collaborated with artists and companies such as Robert Uno of New World Theater, Rangayana and Rahul Varma of Teesri Duniya. She is one of the choreographers for Santhosh Sivan's film Anandabhadram and conceived the choreography for a song in SM Raju's Tamil feature film Varnam. She has received grants from Arts International, Somerville Arts Council, Massachusetts Arts Council and UMass Arts Council. Sindhoor is the founding director of Navarasa Natyalaya, a performance art school in Mysore. Sindhoor is also an experienced actor. Nagamandala, in which she acted as the protagonist Rani, won the best play of the year award at the Karnataka Nataka (theater) Academy. She is one of the three women featured in a documentary film about artists, Take It From Me (2001, Nefertiti Productions). Her works have been showcased in the US, Canada, Germany and India, including venues and festivals such as the Jacob's Pillow, Lincoln Center, New Jersey Performance Arts Center, La Mama and New Haven Festival of Arts and Ideas.

With Zzebra he played the Reading Festival in 1975 and recorded another album, Take It Or Leave It In 1978 he replaced Paul Simon in Ian North's band Neo, a new wave band formed in 1977. Neo recorded an album in Ian Gillan's studio, and after Gillan had heard them he hired Byrd and bassist John McCoy for his own band, which was also called Gillan. The band recorded their first album Gillan in September 1978. It was not released in the UK but sold well as an import. In 1982, Byrd auditioned for pop singer Kim Wilde and became a long-term member of Kim's backing band. With Kim, he co-wrote \\"Another Step (Closer to You)\\", \\"Hey Mister Heartache\\" and many other songs as well as played on some of her albums. He toured with Kim Wilde until the mid-1990s In the 1990s, he was also a member of 4 Bills And A Ben, a band with flexible line-up formed by Johnny Warman which also included Jeff Rich and John Edwards from Status Quo.

Formation occurs when the outer edges and surfaces of the lava flow begin to harden. If the advancing lava underneath becomes restricted it may push up on the hardened crust, tilting it outward. Inflation also takes place and is a process where the plastic layer of lava underneath expands as it cools and small crystals form. The end result is a raised mound of hardened lava rock, usually a relatively narrow but long ridge. Tension cracks form on the surface of pressure ridges and run along the axis of elongated ridges, and at both edges of broader ridges, sometimes referred to as pressure plateaus. Along the edges of a pressure ridge, if the tension crack is large enough it will create a liftup cave. Other caves can form inside pressure ridges in which conditions arose for the ridge to form and but the lava that created the internal pressure quickly drained leaving an inflationary cave. Pressure ridges may reach heights of 15 meters or more and lengths range more than 500 meters but most are less than 100 meters.  Pressure plateaus  Similar to pressure ridges, pressure plateaus are uplifted areas of a ponded lava flow. Instead of narrow and elongated, pressure plateaus are generally wide and long with an amorphous shape.

Life After being educated at Oxford, probably either at Oriel College or St John's College, Oxford he went to Ireland about 1570. He became vicar of Naas in 1573, and in 1580 Elizabeth I gave him the additional vicarage of Bodenstown in County Kildare. In 1577 he had license to enjoy the profits of his parish even when absent in England; but he seems to have generally resided in Ireland. When Arthur Grey, 14th Baron Grey de Wilton assumed the Irish government in 1580, Lyon was appointed his chaplain, and in 1582 he became the first Protestant bishop of Ross, in the province of Munster. Lyon's impact was such that the mayor of Cork almost immediately petitioned Francis Walsingham to make him bishop of Cork and Cloyne. This was done temporarily in 1584, and in 1587 the three sees were united by patent. An Observantine Franciscan had been provided to Ross by the pope around 1580. Lyon had feared replacement, but Sir Henry Wallop, who was then in Munster, strongly supported him. The bishop went to Kinsale, inquiring into the rumours which preceded the Spanish Armada, and for years afterwards he kept an eye on those who were in correspondence with Spain. In 1589 he warned the government against promoting Thomas Wetherhead, who had been guilty of simony: but without effect since Wetherhead was made Bishop of Waterford and Lismore, and continued his malpractices. Lord Deputy William FitzWilliam wrote enthusiastically to Walsingham about Lyon's early evangelism: in 1589 and 1590 he had sometimes congregations in the thousands. But he had no Irish-speaking clergy. By the beginning of 1591 he had built a free school and a bridge at Ross. He spent his own money on the church there and on the palace; but the palace was burned down by the Lord of Clancahill, Donnell II O'Donovan, within three years of its completion. Even at Cork Lyon found no residence, and he laid out over ¬£1,000 in building one. He provided bibles and prayer-books in English and had them distributed throughout his diocese. There was Catholic opposition from the religious orders, Owen MacEgan, bishop-designate acting as vicar-apostolic throughout Munster, and Dermot McCraghe, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Cork and Cloyne. On 27 September 1595, Lyon told Lord Burghley that his congregations had dwindled away. He took a moderate line that the Irish would respond to justice, and the soldiery were harmful to his cause; but wanted the exclusion of priests from abroad. Lyon was included in every commission for the government of Munster. When Sir Thomas Crooke, founder of Baltimore, was accused of piracy in 1608, Lyon was among his strongest defenders, arguing that he had worked miracles in creating a thriving town out of nothing in barely three years. Lyon raised the annual value of Cork and Ross several-fold, by research into titles and good management. The diocese of Cloyne was a different matter, where he was up against Sir John FitzEdmund Fitzgerald, the lay dean of Cloyne, and his court influence, who had been leased the lands through a nominee, by Matthew Sheyn. Fitzgerald used a device of giving the lands to the Crown, which then granted them to him and his heirs, and they only returned to the diocese on any scale after 1660. Lyon, who lived to a good age, died at Cork 4 October 1617, and was buried in a tomb which he had raised for himself twenty years before in the palace grounds. His bones were accidentally found in 1846, and in 1865 were moved to the crypt of the new cathedral. The bishop's wife, Elizabeth, was alive in 1640. A daughter was killed by the O'Donovans in 1642, when the rebels attacked the church at Ross. A son, William, of St. John's College, Oxford, was admitted B.A. in 1611.

In 1942, nest boxes were erected, in the hope that pied flycatchers would control oak leafroller moth larva, which were defoliating trees. These boxes have been continually monitored since 1948, making it the UK's longest- running bird breeding programme.The Dean Nestbox Study 1942‚Äì1964, BRUCE CAMPBELL.

Career Dagnino's artistic career started out during his last years of university (master's degree in English Studies) and led him into three main fields: graphic design, illustration and comic books. He worked for The Walt Disney Company's Imagineers in the design of an attraction permanently exhibited in Florida. He also combined work as an illustrator for juvenile literature while producing works as a freelancer for publicity agencies, magazines and producers. In 2008 Dagnino abandoned the advertising industry to start to work for DC Comics exclusively. That same year he published his first children's book (Kasandra y la Rebeli√≥n de los ni√±os) which will be part of a series in the future. Dagnino became the regular penciller of the comic Superman with issue #692. He also did the art for the Green Lantern Prequel Special: Sinestro #1. As part of DC Comics' company-wide 2011 title relaunch, The New 52, Dagnino was made the artist on Resurrection Man. He subsequently took over art duties on Suicide Squad, beginning with issue #9, replacing Jesus Saiz, who moved to Resurrection Man.

This piece of musical theatre is composed of interviews conducted by the company on the subject of loss. The play engages with individuals who have lost everything from jewelry to technology to a black Gucci pump, investigating both how things get lost, and how the impact of that loss can extend far beyond the meaning of the object itself. Gone Missing was written and directed by Steve Cosson from interviews by the company, with music and lyrics by Michael Friedman, with additional text for ‚ÄúInterview with Dr. Palinurus‚Äù by Peter Morris.Cosson, Steven. \\"Gone Missing.‚Äù The Civilians. Ed. Steven Cosson. New York: Playscripts, Inc, 2008. Print. Gone Missing made its Canadian premiere on May 12, 2011 by Southpointe Academy in British Columbia. Conception Gone Missing began with interviews about things that were lost and never found. The show does not answer any questions or purport theories about loss but rather presents a wide variety of human stories and emotions through this specific type of common experience. When writing about what impact he wanted to have with Gone Missing, stage director and writer Steve Cosson said > ‚ÄúI wanted to learn if the mechanics of loss and grief were significantly > different in other people. Or do we instead all just have different names > and objects tagged to the various holes in hearts, with the nature of the > holes themselves being more or less the same? And is there a way that we as > a society remember lost things can tell us something about how we live now? > Could these holes somehow make a map of absences that would describe the > territory that encompasses both ‚Äòall there is‚Äô and ‚Äòall that might have > been?‚Äô‚Äù Process The Civilians use documentary methods to create theater pieces. Like many of The Civilians' productions, Gone Missing is based on interviews with individuals conducted by the cast. The company did not record the interviews, and the actors did not write them down until after the interview was over. Indeed, Dan Balcazo notes in his Theatermania review of \\"Gone Missing\\", \\"Certain sections appear to be verbatim transcripts of interviews, while others seem more fictionalized, or at the very least exaggerated for comic effect\\".Balcazo, Dan. \\"Gone Missing.\\" Theatermania. June 25, 2007. Available: http://www.theatermania.com/off-broadway/news/06-2007/gone- missing_11009.html This variegated effect is a trademark of The Civilians' style which incorporates the subjective, the ambiguous, and the unexpected. The Play Gone Missing uses the transcripts from the interviews as verbatim dialogue. The bits of dialog are juxtaposed to bring out similarities and highlight differences in the things people lose and how they deal with them. For example, several interviewees talk about rings that they have lost, and these excerpts woven together in one scene. Other voices included are that of a pet psychic, a Disposeaphobic, a social worker, and a police man who finds lost body parts.Cosson, Steve. \\"Gone Missing.\\" The Civilians: An Anthology of Six Plays.

She was a member of the Democratic Society Party (DTP). She is President of Yakay-Der and one of the deputy speakers in the 26th Parliament of Turkey. On 11 February 2018, she was elected co-leader of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) in the party's 3rd ordinary congress. Early life She was born in Hakk√¢ri Province in 1967, where she grew up and went to school. She graduated from high school and started work as an official in the local government administration department. At the age of 19, she married her cousin Sava≈ü Buldan. The couple moved to Istanbul in 1990, where Pervin Buldan was a full-time housewife. One year later, Pervin's first child, Necirvan, was born. There, Sava≈ü Buldan became a businessman, and he was alleged to be a drug dealer and PKK financier by the National Intelligence Organization of the Turkish government.Report on the Susurluk scandalKutlu Sava≈ü devlet sƒ±rlarƒ±nƒ± ele verdi Retrieved 21 March 2015. In 1993, their life changed when Prime Minister Tansu √áiller made a speech declaring that the government had a list of businessmen supporting the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) whom they would hold accountable. After that speech, Savas received a series of threatening telephone calls. The period of ‚Äúkillings by unidentified murderers‚Äù against businessmen, including Sava≈ü Buldan, began. On 3 June 1994, Pervin's husband Sava≈ü and his two friends, Adnan Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m and Hacƒ± Karay were abducted after leaving the Hotel √áƒ±nar in Yesilk√∂y. The next day their bodies were found in Bolu, at the edge of the river Melen. They carried scars of heavy torture and had been shot in the head. Pervin Buldan gave birth to her daughter, Zelal on the same day, 4 June.  Human rights  In 2001 she founded Yakay-Der, the Association of Solidarity and Assistance for the Families of Missing Persons, to help the families of missing persons in Turkey, of which she is now president. Before this she worked for Mag-Der, an association with similar objectives which was closed down by the Turkish authorities because of alleged irregularities with respect to the Turkish Law of Associations. Yakay-Der grew out of the experience of the ‚ÄòSaturday Mothers‚Äô, who used civil disobedience to gain publicity and bring attention to the ‚Äòdisappearances in custody‚Äô cases. These cases became known to the public in Turkey as well as to the world at large. Buldan has described how every week they would hold sit-down demonstrations at Galatasaray Place to ‚Äòask for the people that have disappeared‚Äô, to the state to talk about the ‚Äòreality of the disappeared.  Political career  In July 2007, Buldan stood as an independent candidate within the Thousand Hopes alliance in the Turkish parliamentary elections and entered the Turkish Parliament as an MP for Iƒüdƒ±r. She was re-elected for a second term in the 12 June 2011 general election. In 2008 an investigation was opened against her for a speech that she made during the Newroz celebrations in Iƒüdƒ±r. In April 2010 she headed a group of MPs who demanded an investigation into the Armenian nuclear power plant at Metsamor, near the Turkish border. In 2013 she paid several visits to Abdullah √ñcalan on Imrali Island as deputy chair of the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) as part of the peace process between the PKK and Turkish State. On 11 February 2018 she was elected co-president of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) together with Sezai Temelli. In the Parliamentary Elections of 24 June 2018 she was elected as an MP of Istanbul for the HDP.

Knoch founded the Concordant Publishing Concern and translated the Concordant Version of the Bible. Life Knoch was raised in a German-speaking part of Missouri, born in St. Louis, Missouri as the son of Adolph Knoch, who had emigrated from Germany to the United States . One of his sisters, Addie, remained in Germany. Knoch grew up bilingually: in his parents' house only German was spoken; Knoch learned English only at school. In 1885 the family moved to Los Angeles, where he completed high school in 1893. One of the teachers apparently told him that he had literary talent, and he should study great literature such as Shakespeare or the Bible. Since works by Shakespeare were not available, the young Knoch read in the family Bible. While at school, and thereafter (a total of around 20 years), he worked as a printer in the company of his brother. As part of a job, he came with a group, the \\"Plymouth Brethren\\", part of the Brethren Movement. Tutor McClure led Knoch in this group. He concurred with the teachings and was baptized. Because of his interest in languages, in 1900 at the Bible Institute of Los Angeles, he studied \\"Ancient Greek, the NT in the proto-reading\\". In 1901 Knoch compared his translation output with the new American Standard Revised Version; he was disappointed. During this time he began developing a form of his concordant method of Bible translation. In the \\"Plymouth Brethren\\" he met Olive Hyde, another religious teacher; they married in April 1903. Knoch began to give Greek courses at the local YMCA. He discovered what he believed were additional mistakes in traditional translations and increasingly taught from the Greek to avoid teaching that of which he no longer was totally convinced. He began applying his systematic program with Biblical Greek to his writing work. On November 5, 1907, his son Ernest Oliver was born. Dr. Ethelbert William Bullinger, publisher of the magazine in England, \\"Things to Come\\", in 1906 published a few articles from Knoch. Russian Vladimir Gelesnoff, living in the United States, read the articles and contacted Knoch. Together they published the magazine \\"Grace and Glory\\", but for only eight issues in 1909. It appeared some time later they made some changes and moved to the title known today as \\"Unsearchable Riches\\", particularly regarding dispensationalism and detailed word studies. Knoch concentrated on the Greek New Testament, while Gelesnoff processed the Hebrew Old Testament. Knoch was subsequently published in various books and writings. Knoch's methodology used thousands of index cards on which all occurrences of each Greek word were listed. After his brother had sold the print shop, Knoch worked there for some years, until the printer began accepting print jobs related to war. Knoch refused such assignments and, together with another employee (Herman Vogel), was dismissed until a contract to print tickets was purchased. Knoch worked there a few months until he decided to work full-time for his religious beliefs. Bird later printed the magazine Unsearchable Riches and the Bible Concordant Version, as is still the case. Knoch was primarily a compiler, since the Bible is based on Greek-designated experts such as George L. Rogers (Almont, Michigan), Edward H. Clayton (Sheffield, England) and Earl Taber and many others. The Bible was first released in several parts, starting in 1919 with Revelation; the complete Concordant Translation of the New Testament was published in 1926. Later editions were published in 1944 and 1966, reflecting corrections by contributors such as Alexander Thomson. In 1926, Knoch's wife died. In 1930, Knoch traveled to Germany to visit some German evangelists with whom he maintained contact. At certain events, translations of his articles were read. On 25 May 1937, he married Sigrid Charlotte Marie Gr√§fin von Kanitz (born 1876 in Germany) in Potsdam. Sigrid Knoch translated the next article of her husband for the German Unsearchable Riches. Now in the United States, they decided to return to Germany to develop the German version of the Concordant Translation, at the house of Baroness Wally Bissingen; it was released in 1939 in Berlin. In 1939, the American government urged U.S. nationals to return to the United States, including Knoch, because of the impending war. According to its records, Knoch was under observation by the FBI during the Second World War because of his marriage to a German and his frequent contacts with Germany (Act no. 100-20677; Verdict: safe). On March 28, 1965 AE Knoch died in Los Angeles California. Theology Knoch's work on the Concordant Bible translation led to the development of his theological beliefs. He came to the conclusion that some doctrines, which his church had required him to believe, resulted conspicuously from inaccurate or incorrect translations of the Bible, and Knoch discarded them. These include, for example, teaching about Hell. Though in a revised form, but still in principle, he retained the strong dispensationalism of the Brethren Movement (developed by Darby), and the two different gospels for the Jews and the Nations. The views of Ethelbert William Bullinger may also have influenced him. Knoch was put off by the doctrine of the Trinity, saying that its sense of Divinity of Jesus Christ as being equal with God the Father is not biblical. Knoch's views on what happens to a person at death are different from the teachings of most other Christians: \\"Unless our Lord comes, the souls of all believers will return to hades, as their spirits return to God, and the bodies return to the soil. Death is still a return. Our bodies came from the soil and may return thither. Our spirits came from God and must return to Him. Our souls came from hades (\\"hell!\\") and they cannot possibly return elsewhere!\\" Website of Knoch's teachings Works *Concordant Literal New Testament, Concordant Publishing Concern *Unsearchable Riches *All in All: the Goal of the Universe *The Problem of Evil and the Judgments of God *The Mystery of the Gospel References To view the official Concordant website: www.concordant.org Previous website of www.theheraldofgodsgrace.org is NOT officially affiliated with Concordant Publishing Concern.

Then he joined UTA Arad in 2005, playing three times in his first season and four times in the following one, in Liga I.

Career in Italy He was acquired by Palermo in a free transfer in August 2009, after a successful trial with the Sicilians, being awarded a four-year contract with the rosanero club. He made his debut on 29 October 2009, playing the first half in a Serie A game ended in a 3‚Äì5 away loss to Inter. After playing a Coppa Italia home game against Reggina, he was again featured in the Italian Serie A on 30 January 2010 as a replacement for injured Federico Balzaretti in an away game versus Bari. Melinte's performance was then verbally criticized by club chairman Maurizio Zamparini after the Romanian caused a penalty (then scored) with the game being 2‚Äì2, and then making a mistake that was instrumental in Bari's fourth goal. Two days later, he was sent out on loan to Serie B club Piacenza in switch with Marco Calderoni.

The church served as the cathedral of the Diocese of Raleigh from 1924 to 2017. In 1978 it, and the other parish buildings, was included as a contributing property in the Capitol Area Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Sacred Heart is also the location of the Cathedral School, formally called Sacred Heart Cathedral School. History Interior of the church in 2017 Sacred Heart Parish was established in 1879. Ground was broken for the present church building in 1922, and it was completed two years later. Later in 1924 the Apostolic Vicariate of North Carolina was elevated to the Diocese of Raleigh, and Sacred Heart Church became the diocesan cathedral. North Carolina was the last state to have a diocese established within it, and Catholics were small in number. The rectory, which sits behind the church, was completed in 1917, the convent that housed Dominican sisters was completed in 1927, and the school building was completed in 1938. While the buildings in the complex differ in style, they each feature irregular rough hewn ashlar stone with raised mortar joints. The church building itself is rather simple in its design. It features Gothic elements, such as pointed arches, lancet windows, mock buttresses, and a corner tower with a spire. There is a statue of the Sacred Heart of Jesus above the main entrance. With seating for about 300 people, Sacred Heart had become the smallest Roman Catholic cathedral in the continental United States and the second smallest in the country. Due to the church's size, eleven masses were necessary per weekend to accommodate all of the attendees. In 2011, Bishop Michael F. Burbidge announced the construction of a new cathedral to replace Sacred Heart, which could no longer accommodate the growing parish and diocese. Fund-raising began in September of that year for the new facility, and it is located on the where the diocesan offices and Cardinal Gibbons High School were formerly located. Groundbreaking for the new Holy Name of Jesus Cathedral took place January 3, 2015. Built for $41 million and seating 2,000 people, the new cathedral was dedicated on July 26, 2017. Sacred Heart continues to be used for daily Mass, weddings, and funerals but no longer holds Sunday Mass.http://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/ned- barnett/article164368627.html School Cathedral School is a Pre-K through eighth-grade school located next to Sacred Heart Church. The school was established in 1909 and educates young Catholics and prepares them for High School. Cathedral School feeds into Cardinal Gibbons High School. Cardinal Gibbons High School had originally been at Sacred Heart Cathedral and was called Sacred Heart High School and then Cathedral Latin High School. In 2007, Cathedral School received a National Blue Ribbon of Excellence Award. The Cathedral School will move to the new cathedral site when complete.

The ship was launched in 1896 and served on the Argentine Navy until she was stricken on 8 May 1947.  Service history  The cruiser was built at the Cantiere Navale Fratelli Orlando, in Livorno, where her hull was laid down in 1896 and launched on 25 July 1897. She was purchased in 1898 by the government of Argentina, engaged in a diplomatic conflict with Chile. After testing of machinery and artillery, General Belgrano entered service on 8 October 1898, departing the same day entered the port of Genoa, under the command of Captain Emilio Barilari, arriving at their destination in Mar del Plata, on November 6 of that year.

Another term for it is partial sum. The purposes of a running total are twofold. First, it allows the total to be stated at any point in time without having to sum the entire sequence each time. Second, it can save having to record the sequence itself, if the particular numbers are not individually important. Method Consider the sequence < 5 8 3 2 >. What is the total of this sequence? Answer: 5 + 8 + 3 + 2 = 18. This is arrived at by simple summation of the sequence. Now we insert the number 6 at the end of the sequence to get < 5 8 3 2 6 >. What is the total of that sequence? Answer: 5 + 8 + 3 + 2 + 6 = 24. This is arrived at by simple summation of the sequence. But if we regarded 18 as the running total, we need only add 6 to 18 to get 24. So, 18 was, and 24 now is, the running total. In fact, we would not even need to know the sequence at all, but simply add 6 to 18 to get the new running total; as each new number is added, we get a new running total. The same method will also work with subtraction, but in that case it is not strictly speaking a total (which implies summation) but a running difference; not to be confused with a delta. This is used, for example, when scoring the game of darts. Similarly one can multiply instead of add to get the running product. Use While this concept is very simple, it is extremely common in everyday use. For example, most cash registers display a running total of the purchases so far rung in. By the end of the transaction this will, of course, be the total of all the goods. Similarly, the machine may keep a running total of all transactions made, so that at any point in time the total can be checked against the amount in the till, even though the machine has no memory of past transactions. Typically many games of all kinds use running totals for scoring; the actual values of past events in the sequence are not important, only the current score, that is to say, the running total. The central processing unit of computers for many years had a component called the accumulator which, essentially, kept a running total (it \\"accumulated\\" the results of individual calculations). This term is largely obsolete with more modern computers. A betting accumulator is the running product of the outcomes of several bets in sequence.

It is one possible step in the broad scheme of carbon capture and utilization. The first examples of electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide are from the 19th century, when carbon dioxide was reduced to carbon monoxide using a zinc cathode. Research in this field intensified in the 1980s following the oil embargoes of the 1970s. Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide represents a possible means of producing chemicals or fuels, converting carbon dioxide () to organic feedstocks such as formic acid (HCOOH), carbon monoxide (CO), ethylene (C2H4), ethanol (C2H5OH) and methane (CH4). Among the more selective metallic catalysts in this field are tin for formic acid, gold for carbon monoxide and copper for ethylene, ethanol or methane.  Chemicals from carbon dioxide  In carbon fixation, plants convert carbon dioxide into sugars, from which many biosynthetic pathways originate. The catalyst responsible for this conversion, RuBisCo, is the most common protein on earth. Some anaerobic organisms employ enzymes to convert CO2 to carbon monoxide, from which fatty acids can be made. In industry, a few products are made from CO2, including urea, salicylic acid, methanol, and certain inorganic and organic carbonates.Susan Topham, \\"Carbon Dioxide\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. In the laboratory, carbon dioxide is sometimes used to prepare carboxylic acids. No electrochemical CO2 electrolyzer that operates at room temperature has been commercialized. Elevated temperature solid oxide electrolyzer cells (SOEC) for CO2 reduction to CO are commercially available. For example, Haldor Topsoe offers SOECs for CO2 reduction with a reported 6-8 kWh per Nm3 CO produced and purity up to 99.999% CO . Electrocatalysis The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to CO is usually described as: : CO2 \\\\+ 2 H+ \\\\+ 2 e‚àí ‚Üí CO + H2O The redox potential for this reaction is similar to that for hydrogen evolution in aqueous electrolytes, thus electrochemical reduction of CO2 is usually competitive with hydrogen evolution reaction. Electrochemical methods have gained significant attention: 1) at ambient pressure and room temperature; 2) in connection with renewable energy sources (see also solar fuel) 3) competitive controllability, modularity and scale-up are relatively simple. The electrochemical reduction or electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 can produce value-added chemicals such methane, ethylene, ethane, etc., and the products are mainly dependent on the selected catalysts and operating potentials (applying reduction voltage). A variety of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts have been evaluated. Many such processes are assumed to operate via the intermediacy of metal carbon dioxide complexes. Many processes suffer from high overpotential, low current efficiency, low selectivity, slow kinetics, and/or poor catalyst stability.Halmann and Steinberg, \\"Greenhouse Gas Carbon Dioxide Mitigation,\\" Lewis Publishers, 1999.

Although the Flint mayor's office is a nonpartisan position, Walling is a member of the Democratic Party. Life Early life and education Walling was born on to two Flint schools educators. In 1992, he graduated from Flint Central High School. Walling then earned a bachelor's degree in social relations from Michigan State University. He attended the University of Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship getting a bachelor's in modern history. He followed that with a master's degree in urban affairs from Goldsmiths, University of London. Public life Walling began his public service career in the mayor's office in Washington, DC. For over two years, he worked as manager of research and communication. During that time, Walling was a founder and president of the Flint Club, a 501(c)(3) non-profit community organization. Walling had also served as U.S. Rep. Dale E. Kildee's Field coordinator and worked to get out the vote for National Voice. He then became a policy advocate for Urban Coalition of Minnesota and was a doctoral candidate at University of Minnesota. After an April 2004 Flint forum, Walling decided to move back to Flint to run for mayor. In May 2006, Walling and his family moved to Kensington Avenue in Flint. He worked for one year as a senior research fellow at the Genesee County Land Bank. Political career In the 2007 primary, Walling was one of seven candidates for mayor. Walling made it to the general election along with Don Williamson. Walling received support by the Michigan Democratic Party but lost to Williamson. On August 4, 2009, Walling won the special general mayoral election over Genesee County Commissioner Brenda Clack to replace Williamson after his resignation. One of Mayor Walling's appointments came under scrutiny by the public and city council, after he appointed Donna Poplar as human resource director. Poplar was fired from her job as Genesee County Community Action Agency Director in 1999 and convicted of a felony which was later expunged. David Davenport, a school board member, filed recall language with the county election commission, which approve the language that named cutting fire and police protection as reasons for the recalled. In the third quarter 2010, recall petitions were turned in by the Committee to Recall Dayne Walling were rejected for signature issues. The committee attempted to have those signature reinstated by the courts. On October 26, 2010, the Karegnondi Water Authority Board of Trustees met for the first time with representatives from the incorporating counties and cities. Walling was elected chair. In his bid to be re-elected, Walling came in first in the nonpartisan general primary on August 2, 2011 with Darryl Buchanan taking second to face off with him in the general election in November. On November 8, 2011, Walling defeated Buchanan 8,819 votes (56%) to 6,868 votes (44%). On the date of his re-election, the Michigan State review panel declared the City of Flint to be in state of a \\"local government financial emergency\\". His authority as Flint Mayor was superseded by the appointment by Michigan Governor Rick Snyder of Michael Brown as the city's Emergency Manager on November 29 effective December 1. After a series of emergency manager on , the state moved the city from under from an emergency manager receivership to a Receivership Transition Advisory Board. On July 1, 2014, Walling as mayor was given operating authority over two city departments, Planning and Development and Public Works, by Flint emergency manager Darnell Earley. During his first campaign for mayor, Walling promised to spearhead a new master plan for the city of Flint. The plan then in place was over 50 years old. In October 2013, the citizens of Flint adopted the first new master plan since 1960. Over 5,000 Flint residents took part in the process to craft a road map for Flint's future. The Imagine Flint Master Plan now serves as a guide for City operations and a blueprint for new developments. The plan has won numerous awards and is only the third plan in the city's history. Walling served as the chair of the national Manufacturing Alliance of Communities from 2013 through 2015. As chair, he championed Flint's role in the transformation of the U.S. manufacturing industry. Walling also led the Maker Mayors effort which led to the first-ever Maker Faire at the White House with President Obama. In late 2014, Walling became an instructor at the University of Michigan-Flint for its fall semester teaching POL 324: Seminar in Applied Politics ‚Äì Institutional & Leadership Practices. Flint water crisis In 2014, the City of Flint began undertaking a water supply switch-over from Lake Huron to the Flint River. After the switch was made, residents immediately complained about the smell, taste, and color of the water, as well as skin problems after bathing. State and city officials reassured the public that Flint's water was safe, with Mayor Walling personally testifying to its safety by drinking the water on local television and tweeting that he and his family drink Flint water every day. In early September 2015, Walling requested an additional $10 million from the state government to replace water service lines with lead or lead solder and for the city to step up development of a corrosion control plan to be finished by the end of the year. After meeting with Doctor Mona Hanna-Attisha, the lead doctor of the Hurley Hospital Lead Study, Walling issued an advisory on lead while the state still had issue with the study. Doctors recommended ending the use of the Flint river as a water supply, but were told in a meeting with Walling and other city officials that such a move would bankrupt the city. The water crisis was at the center of the November 2015 election. Walling ultimately lost his re-election bid to Karen Weaver. On Monday, January 29, 2018, Walling declared that he was a candidate for the 49th District State House seat to replace term limited Phil Phelps.

Not surprisingly, the individual geographical units of this large region show considerable variations in climate and soil types. A common feature of the region, however, is its landscape of flat-topped hills of Muschelkalk, gently rolling tracts of loess and plateaus in which the layers of Muschelkalk have been covered by sediments of Gipskeuper and Lettenkeuper. The G√§u Plateaus are the northwestern part of the Southern Scarplands.  Location and geology  The G√§u Plateaus extend from the Upper Rhine to the Tauber valley. They are bordered to the west by the Black Forest and the Upper Rhine Plain, to the north by the Odenwald and the Mainfranken Plateaus, to the east by the Franconian and Swabian Keuper-Lias Lands and the Swabian Jura. The underlying rock is made up of the layer of Muschelkalk, which is largely covered by Lettenkeuper or loess. The soils in the region are mostly of very high quality.

Since Kazakhstan is a relatively newer country after the dissolution of the USSR bloc, Iran‚Äôs relationship with the country is therefore also new. According to Kazakhstan, diplomatic relations between the two countries began on January 29, 1992. The mission of Kazakhstan was set up in the Islamic Republic of Iran in 1993 with a consulate created in 2007 (Gogan). As for Iran, they established an embassy in Kazakhstan in 1992 with two consulates created in 1992 (Aktau) and 2012 (Almaty).  Trade  Trade turnover between the two countries increased fivefold in the last six years from $400 million to more than $2 billion in 2009. Iran imports grain, oil products and metals from Kazakhstan. Iran is a partner in joint oil and gas projects including construction of a pipeline connecting Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Iran (Persian Gulf) which will give Astana access to the Asian markets. Kazakhstan has special interests in Iranian investments in mechanical engineering, infrastructure, transport, telecommunications. While the countries of Iran and Kazakhstan are extremely diverse, they have found common ground in working together as Asian countries. A large component of what ties them together is the fact that they both have borders on the Caspian Sea. The resources and access that comes from that resource is a link for their economics and resources. Such economic interests for the two countries revolve around oil whether it be underwater or subterranean. Also, in conversations in 2010 between high level Iranian and Kazakhstani officials there was discussions as to how well the two countries felt their relations were increasing. At that point in their relationship, Iran and Kazakhstan were looking to further develop their connection, especially through agriculture and transportation (air and rail).  On-going commitment  The relationship of the two countries also evolved heavily through their mutual cooperation in international organizations. Some notable examples of relations in that field are through the United Nations (UN) and the Economic Cooperation Organization. Also, over 60 contracts since the diplomatic mission began are ensuring that Iran and Kazakhstan have legal and diplomatic obligations to each other. Another facet to the relationship between Iran and Kazakhstan is that they seem committed to holding meetings and summits as to further their cooperation. The two countries, especially their leaders, have stressed that they feel a commitment to furthering the worth and strength of their currencies. Another way that they have expressed to the journalism community about ways to continue their strong relationship is through making visa requirements easier between the two countries, which they seem to feel would help increase the interests of Iranian and Kazakhstani business in the other respective country.

The intention was to secure control of the strategically important Lake Tanganyika, which had been dominated by German naval units since the beginning of the war. The British forces ‚Äî consisting of two motor boats named HMS Mimi and Toutou ‚Äî were under the command of the eccentric Lieutenant-Commander Geoffrey Spicer-Simson. The boats were transported to South Africa and from there by railway, by river, and by being dragged through the African jungle, to the lake. In two short engagements, the small motor boats attacked and defeated two of their German opponents. In the first action, on 26 December 1915 Kingani was damaged and captured, becoming . In the second, the small flotilla overwhelmed and sank Hedwig von Wissmann. The Germans maintained a third large and heavily armed craft on the lake, Graf von G√∂tzen; this craft was attacked indecisively by Belgian aircraft and was subsequently scuttled. Developments in the land-based conflict caused the Germans to withdraw from the lake, and control of the surface of Lake Tanganyika passed to the British and Belgians. Background Strategic situation Lake Tanganyika lies between what was then the Belgian Congo on the western side and German East Africa on the eastern side. By the start of the war, the Germans had two warships on Lake Tanganyika: the Hedwig von Wissmann, and the Kingani. Hedwig von Wissmann was quickly armed with four pom-pom guns taken from the scuttled survey ship M√∂we and sailed out to the port of Lukuga on the Belgian side of the lake, where on 22 August she attacked the Belgian steamer Alexandre Del Commune, sinking her after two further raids. This gave the Germans unchallenged superiority on the lake, with their position strengthened further with the sinking of the British African Lakes Corporation‚Ä≤s steamer Cecil Rhodes in a raid in November 1914. The Germans used their control of the lake to launch an attack on northern Rhodesia, led by Major-General Kurt Wahle. This was beaten back, but further raids on Belgian territory and bombardments of Lukuga convinced the Belgians to support the British. Despite this undertaking, there was little the Belgians or British could do to challenge the Germans. The Belgians had the components for a large steamer, Baron Dhanis, which if it could be assembled would be considerably larger than either Kingani or Hedwig von Wissmann, but did not dare to start construction on her while the Germans patrolled the lake for fear that she would be destroyed before she could be launched. The British had sent two 12-pounder guns to arm her with, but with little prospect of being able to launch her, the Belgians were instead using them as shore batteries to defend Lukuga. German control of the lake was significant for the whole campaign in the central African theatre. While the British could muster troops to the south of the lake, and the Belgians had troops to the north, neither could push into German East Africa because of the risk that the Germans would use their boats to transport troops across the lake, and use them to cut their supply and communications lines. Lee's plan On 21 April 1915, John R. Lee‚Äîa big game hunter and veteran of the Second Boer War‚Äîarrived at the Admiralty to meet Admiral Sir Henry Jackson. Lee had been in Eastern Africa and had personally observed the German ships on Lake Tanganyika. He also brought the news that the Germans were preparing to launch a new ship from their fortified port of Kigoma. Named Graf von G√∂tzen, she had been constructed at the Meyer shipyard at Papenburg, disassembled and packed into 5,000 crates and transported to Dar-es-Salaam. From there, she had been brought by rail to Kigoma and assembled in secret. long and displacing , she would cement German control of the lake and allow 800-900 troops to be rapidly transported to any point on the lakeshore to raid into allied territory. To counter this threat, Lee proposed that motor gunboats be sent to Africa and transported through the interior to the lake. They would be small and highly manoeuvrable, and‚Äîif armed with a gun with a range of ‚Äîcould both outrun and outgun the larger German ships. Using small vessels that could be transported intact meant that they could be launched immediately onto the lake, eliminating the risk of their discovery and destruction while being assembled. Sir Henry considered the plan and approved it with the words \\"It is both the duty and the tradition of the Royal Navy to engage the enemy wherever there is water to float a ship.\\" Jackson passed the task of finalising the details of the operation to his junior, Admiral David Gamble. Gamble appointed Lee second in command of the expedition, and placed Lieutenant-Commander Geoffrey Spicer-Simson in charge. Spicer-Simson was a man described by Giles Foden as \\"a man court- martialled for wrecking his own ships, an inveterate liar and a wearer of skirts.\\" He had reached the rank of lieutenant-commander but had not progressed further owing to a number of mistakes and disasters, which left him in a small office in the Admiralty assigned to helping with the process of transferring merchant seamen into the navy. In 1905, he had come up with the idea of stringing a cable between two destroyers to sweep for periscopes and nearly sank a submarine. He ran another ship aground while testing the defences of Portsmouth Harbour, and later collided with and sank a small boat, killing a man. By the outbreak of war, he was in command of and a small flotilla at Ramsgate. He went ashore to entertain guests at a nearby hotel, from whose windows he watched Niger being torpedoed and sunk. He had nevertheless commanded a survey vessel on the Gambia River and, due to a shortage of officers, was selected to take command. Lee went out to prepare the way through Africa, while Spicer-Simson assembled 27 men and two motor boats that had been built by John I. Thornycroft & Company to fulfil an order made by the Greek government before the war. The journey of Mimi and Toutou A map of German East Africa, with Lake Tanganyika at the extreme left The British naval force consisted of two motor boats. Spicer-Simson suggested they be named Cat and Dog, but the names were rejected by the Admiralty. Spicer-Simson then suggested Mimi and Toutou as alternatives, which were accepted. As he later explained, these meant \\"Miaow\\" and \\"Bow-wow\\" in French. Their crews were assembled from acquaintances of Spicer-Simson, or from the ranks of the Royal Naval Reserve. Spicer-Simson proposed a number of improvements to the original design; they were cut down to improve their speed, Maxim guns and a 3-pounder Hotchkiss gun were fitted, though the Hotchkiss had to be fired from a kneeling position, and extra steel linings were added to the petrol tanks. The boats were tested on the Thames on 8 June, where arrangements had been made for Mimi to fire a practice shell from her 3-pounder. The shell hit the target, but both gun and gunner flew into the river, as the gun had not been properly bolted to the deck. The boats were loaded aboard on 15 June, along with special trailers and cradles to allow them to be transported by rail or overland, and the expedition‚Ä≤s equipment and supplies. Once they arrived in South Africa, they would have to be carried over inland, including the traversing of an mountain range. Meanwhile, on 8 June Graf von G√∂tzen was launched on Lake Tanganyika. The first leg of Mimi and Toutou‚Ä≤s journey was completed after 17 days at sea and their arrival at the Cape. From Cape Town, they and the men of the expedition travelled north by railway through Bulawayo to Elisabethville, where they arrived on 26 July. After travelling to the railhead at Fungurume, they were detrained and dragged through the bush by teams of oxen and steam tractors to the beginnings of the railway from Sankisia to Bukama. At Bukama, the boats and stores were unloaded and prepared for a voyage down the Lualaba River, where despite running aground several times and being forced to take passage on a Belgian river steamer they completed their journey after sailing through Lake Kisale and arrived at Kabalo on 22 October. From there, a small railway took them to just short of the Belgian port of Lukuga, on the shore of Lake Tanganyika. Here Spicer-Simson met the Belgian army commander, Commandant Stinghlamber, and the naval commander, Commandant Goor, and preparations were made to launch Mimi and Toutou and to seek out the Germans. Belgian and German preparations The Germans had made use of the loss of the survey ship M√∂we by taking some of her crew, and men from the merchant ships of the Deutsche Ost-Afrika Linie, and using them to man their ships. The German position on the lake had been further strengthened with the loss of the cruiser in the Rufiji River in July. Guns from K√∂nigsberg arrived at the German base at Kigoma, and the German naval commander on the lake, Captain Gustav Zimmer, had one of K√∂nigsberg‚Ä≤s SK L/40 Schnelladekanone (i.e. quick-firing gun) mounted on G√∂tzen. Members of K√∂nigsberg‚Ä≤s crew also made their way to join his forces, and Zimmer placed former crewmember Lieutenant Job Rosenthal in command of Kingani. Job Odebrecht commanded Hedwig, while Zimmer himself commanded G√∂tzen. {- style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\" Plan of . Kingani later HMS Fifi Graf Goetzen naval gun.

Goor hoped to bring into commission the as-yet unassembled Baron Dhanis, and the hulk of Alexandre del Commune, which had been sunk early in the war by Hedwig von Wissmann. Zimmer may have been aware that the British were planning to launch ships on the lake, but he was also concerned that Baron Dhanis might be assembled and launched. The Baron Dhanis was not necessarily a threat to G√∂tzen in port, but he was determined to maintain his freedom of movement on the lake.

Juni 1916, P. 8 Battle Rosenthal investigates Baron Dhanis on the lake, c. 1916. Lieutenant Job Rosenthal, commanding Kingani, made several passes and observed work underway on a new harbour at Kalemie, south of Lukuga, where Spicer-Simson intended to make his base. Still lacking detailed information on the enemy's movements, Kingani returned early on the morning of 1 December and attempted to approach the harbour. Rosenthal's vessel was spotted by the shore batteries and driven away, but returned the following night and Rosenthal himself swam to Lukuga to examine the slipways under construction. He also discovered the camps, where the British flag revealed the presence of Spicer-Simson and his expedition. Rosenthal travelled down the railway line and discovered both Mimi and Toutou, and the disassembled parts of Baron Dhanis. Realising that the threat actually lay in the British vessels, he attempted to return to Kingani, but was unable to locate her in the dark. He attempted to conceal himself and hoped that Kingani would return at nightfall, but was discovered by a Belgian patrol and taken prisoner. While a captive he succeeded in sending a message, with a secret addendum written in urine to Zimmer warning him of what he had seen, but the message did not reach Kigoma for several months. Mimi and Toutou are launched The slipways at Kalemie were ready by mid-December, and on 22 December Toutou was launched onto Lake Tanganyika, with Mimi following the next day. Final preparations were made on 24 December, including the fuelling and the fitting of guns, after which brief trials were made. On 26 December, Kingani approached Kalemie. Rosenthal's successor ‚Äî Sub-Lieutenant Junge ‚Äî had orders to gather information on naval preparations, and at 06:00 in the morning ‚Äî as Spicer-Simson was conducting morning prayers ‚Äî she was sighted offshore. Kingani is captured The Kingani on Lake Tanganyika before being captured. Mimi and Toutou set out of the harbour after Kingani had passed by. Unexpectedly finding himself pursued by two motor boats flying the white ensign, Junge ordered that the speed be increased. Kingani‚Ä≤s six-pounder gun could only fire forward, however, and the faster and more nimble motor boats were able to close the range and open fire with their three-pounder guns, while avoiding the German‚Ä≤s fire. After a short action lasting 11 minutes, Kingani was hit on her gun, the shell passing through the gunshield and killing Junge and two petty officers, Penne and Schwarz. After several more hits, her chief engineer hauled down the colours and the British took possession of her. Junge and four dead crewmembers were buried; one African crewman was allowed to stay on Kingani as a stoker and three German and eight Africans were prisoners of war.Foden After a hole in Kingani‚Ä≤s hull had been patched, she was taken into service as HMS Fifi. Spicer-Simson explained that Fifi meant \\"tweet-tweet\\" in French, and was suggested by the wife of a Belgian officer who had a small caged bird. Her six-pounder gun was moved to her stern, while one of the 12-pounder guns that had been mounted ashore was fixed to the bows. The Admiralty were impressed by the expedition's achievements, Spicer-Simson was specially promoted to commander from the date of the action, and a message was sent which read \\"His Majesty The King desires to express his appreciation of the wonderful work carried out by his most remote expedition\\"; The Colonial Office also expressed its approbation. Zimmer did not immediately send Hedwig to investigate the disappearance of Kingani, possibly being too busy transporting troops and supplies. The storm season in January also made navigation of the lake dangerous for vessels smaller than G√∂tzen. Hedwig is sunk It was not until mid-January that Hedwig came to Lukuga to investigate the disappearance of the German ship. By now, Spicer-Simson had been given the repaired Belgian vessel Delcommune‚Äînow renamed Vengeur‚Äîto add to his flotilla. Odebrecht scouted close to the shore, keeping clear of the shore batteries that were assumed to have sunk Kingani, but could not see anything worth reporting. He was ordered back to Lukuga on 8 February, and told to rendezvous with Zimmer on G√∂tzen the following day. Hedwig was spotted early in the morning and the expedition's forces sallied forth to intercept her. The combined Anglo-Belgian flotilla consisted of Mimi, Fifi, Dix-Tonne, and the whaleboat, Toutou having been damaged and still under repair. Odebrecht spotted the approaching vessels, but continued to advance. He initially mistook them for Belgian craft, but the white ensigns revealed that they were British. He continued toward the shore until making a sharp turn to port at 09:30, either attempting to lure them toward G√∂tzen, or having been fooled by an optical illusion into thinking the approaching vessels were larger than he had first thought. The pursuing vessels chased Hedwig, with Fifi opening fire with her bow-mounted 12-pounder. The recoil stopped her dead in her tracks; Odebrecht used this situation to pull away. Hedwig could do to Fifi‚Ä≤s , but as Fifi fell behind, Mimi sped past, firing on the retreating German vessel with her three-pounder gun. The shots missed, but Hedwig‚Ä≤s stern guns did not have the range of Mimi‚Ä≤s weapon, and Odebrecht was forced to come about and try to hit her with his bow-mounted six-pounder. The two circled for a time, unable to score hits, until Fifi closed. Spicer-Simson, commanding aboard Fifi, was down to three shells on his 12-pounder, and risked being outclassed if Hedwig could bring her own six-pounder to bear. At this moment, a shell jammed in Fifi‚Ä≤s gun, and in the 20 minutes that it took to clear it, Hedwig again pulled away, searching for G√∂tzen. With her second to last shot, Fifi fired again. The shell hit Hedwig‚Ä≤s hull, causing flooding, while moments later her last shell hit the engine room, bursting the boiler and killing five African sailors and two Germans. As fires began to spread through the stricken craft Odebrecht gave the order to abandon ship, and set explosive charges to destroy the sinking vessel. (Three of the dead were the engineer and two native stokers in the boiler room; the others were a warrant officer and three natives). Of the remaining ships company, a European stoker and native seaman were slightly wounded when two of the ships boats were hit by shells; Twelve Europeans, including the captain, and eight natives were captured by the British.National Geographic October 1922 .pp.362-363 Besides the 20 survivors the British also captured a large German naval ensign, the first to be taken in the war. G√∂tzen is scuttled Port of Kigoma, c.1914-1916.Hedwig von Wissmann in the back The flotilla returned to shore with their prisoners, and the following day G√∂tzen appeared offshore, steaming slowly past in search of the missing Hedwig. Alerted, the crews rushed to man their boats, but Spicer- Simson forbade an attack. Shortly afterward, Spicer-Simson left the lake for Stanleyville, in search of a boat to rival G√∂tzen. He found one such vessel‚ÄîSt George, a steel boat belonging to the British consul at Banana‚Äîand had her dismantled, dragged to Lake Tanganyika and reassembled. By the time he returned in May, the German position on the lake had deteriorated further. The Belgians were about to capture Kigoma and a British force was pushing north toward Bismarckburg. The expedition was to support land operations from the lake, and the flotilla, consisting of Mimi, Toutou, Fifi and Vengeur arrived off Bismarckburg on 5 June. Finding the harbour defended by a fort, Spicer- Simson decided not to attack, and withdrew to Kituta. Thowing a hydroplane afloat near the lake, c. 1916. This allowed the German forces to escape in a fleet of dhows, an act which provoked the anger of the army commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Murray. The naval expeditionary force remained at Bismarckburg, where Spicer-Simson was chastened to learn that the fort's guns were in fact wooden dummies. Meanwhile, the British had provided the Belgians with four Short Type 827 floatplanes to attack G√∂tzen at Kigoma. Several bombing runs were made, but unbeknownst to either the British or the Belgians, Zimmer had been ordered by his commanding officer‚ÄîPaul von Lettow-Vorbeck‚Äîto remove most of G√∂tzen‚Ä≤s armament, including the autocannon taken from K√∂nigsberg, and send them to be used by the army in the field. Wooden dummies were mounted to maintain the illusion of a heavily armed ship. Kigoma fell to General Charles Tombeur‚Ä≤s forces on 28 July, during the Tabora Offensive, but G√∂tzen was already gone. The Germans had sailed the ship to the south of Kigoma Bay and, after having her engines thoroughly greased in case there should be need to make use of her again, filled her with sand and carefully scuttled her on 26 July in a depth of 20 m near the banks of the Katabe Bay (Belgian designation: Baie de l‚Äô√©l√©phant; British designation: Bangwe Bay) at the Position 04¬∞ 54' 05\\" S; 029¬∞ 36' 12\\" E.Leconte: Les anc√™tres de notre Force Navale. S. 331; Moulaert: La campagne du Tanganika. S. 119 Aftermath Belgian shore batteries used in the battle c. 2016 Anglo-Belgian control of Lake Tanganyika was secured by mid-1916, though the war in Africa dragged on for another two years. Most of the men of the naval expedition returned to Britain, where Spicer-Simson was awarded the Distinguished Service Order but was reprimanded for some of his antagonistic behaviour toward his Belgian allies and was not given another command. The Belgians for their part appointed him a Commander of the Order of the Crown, and awarded him the Croix de guerre. The exploits on Lake Tanganyika caught the public imagination, and were adapted by C. S. Forester for his book The African Queen, later made into the film The African Queen, directed by John Huston. A British naval force features in the book, consisting of two motor boats named HMS Amelia and HMS Matilda. The legacy of the Battle for Lake Tanganyika also continues in the survival of Spicer-Simson‚Ä≤s nemesis, Graf von G√∂tzen. She was raised by the Belgians and towed to Kigoma, but sank at her moorings in a storm. She was raised again by the British in 1921 under their mandate for Tanganyika, where it was found that she was so well preserved by the greasing, that little work needed to be done to repair her. She returned to service on 16 May 1927 under the name Liemba, and still sails Lake Tanganyika. Notes a. Foden maintains throughout that the Admiralty were unaware of the existence of the G√∂tzen, and that the expedition only became aware of her after their arrival on the lake shore. The presence of Kingani was also a surprise to them. Paice instead claims that Lee was aware of the G√∂tzen from February, when structural work on her was nearing completion, and that he informed the Admiralty of her when he reported to them in April. b. Paice records that Spicer-Simson had Mimi, Toutou, Fifi and 'a Belgian motor boat known only as Vedette. Vedette is presumably the whaleboat with the outboard motor, identified by Foden as being termed by Commandant Goor as \\"la vedette (patrol boat)\\". Foden notes that Toutou had damaged her bows in a collision with the harbour wall, and had then sunk in a storm, before being recovered.

Farrell MacDonald.  Plot  Captain Jim Hadley, fire chief, has his retirement dinner after 40 years in the service. The next day, time hangs very heavy on his hands so that he even chats to a brush salesman (who has a perfect Elmer Fudd voice). Bored, he later visits his old fire station, Fire Company No.7, and talks to the men there, who are called out on a fire. The Great Eastern Insurance Company is where Frank Rogers (who is interested in Hadley‚Äôs daughter Jane) works. There have been a number of fires lately and arson is suspected. This thought is echoed at the Arson Bureau where Lieutenant King, chased up by the mayor, tells Henderson and Roberts he wants results. They know it is an arsonist who uses time bombs and gasoline. The arsonist turns out to be the keeper of an antiques shop, which Joan visits. Jim is making plans for the future with Burt Stafford, who is due to retire soon. Burt is called out on a fire with the others and is very badly injured there. He dies in the hospital, with Jim standing beside him. The antiques man has called at the Hadley home to bring a salt and pepper set he had to do minor work on, which Joan had bought. She sees the gleam in his eyes when she lights a match. Jim joins the arson investigation at the bureau, having had some experience when he was in the fire brigade. Spectroscopic analysis of wood found at the scene of the last big fire reveals that part of the burnt time bomb box Jim found was maple wood, so he, Henderson and Roberts scour the city for the maker of the boxes and who they sold them to. At another big fire, Jim comes across a statue of Vulcan (the Roman god of fire) which the arsonist dropped, it being his inspiration. The arsonist gets it from Jim‚Äôs unlocked car where he put it. Mention of this statue later--and the fact that Frank and Joan saw it in the antique shop window--provide a strong lead so they get a search warrant. They do not find any bomb-making equipment, but Jim finds wood shavings which later analysis reveals to be the same wood as that used for the time bomb box. Jim and Frank go after the arsonist, who has lost his bureau tail. The arsonist goes to the basement of the Hadley house where he plants a time bomb. He goes upstairs and confronts Mrs. Hadley and Joan, and as Jim and Frank realize he may be back at their house--having been seen in the vicinity--the bomb goes off and the basement catches fire. The arsonist tells the women Jim should not have interfered in his work. The men bust in the door and while Frank escorts the women outside, Jim goes after the arsonist, who now babbling about being the god of fire. The arsonist falls down the basement steps into the burning basement and dies. Some time later there is another dinner in honor of Jim, who has got a new job--honorary fire chief of the city. The film contained footage from a number of large authentic fires, a fire station, and firemen rushing to the fires and fighting the fires. No acknowledgment was given to the fire service. The unnamed city was Los Angeles as it was filmed at Fire Station 27 in Hollywood.  Cast  *J.

The ship often served as a flagship and made several deployments to the Eastern Mediterranean and the Levant during her career. At the beginning of the Italo-Turkish War of 1911‚Äì12 she bombarded Tripoli. Giuseppe Garibaldi bombarded Beirut in early 1912 and sank an Ottoman ironclad there. Several months later she bombarded the defenses of the Dardanelles. The ship spent several months deployed to Albania after the end of the First Balkan War in 1913 to protect Italian interests there. Giuseppe Garibaldi was sunk by an Austro-Hungarian submarine in the Adriatic Sea shortly after Italy declared war on the Central Powers in 1915 with the loss of 53 crewmen. Her wreck was discovered in 2008 and has been examined by underwater archaeologists in subsequent years. Design and description Giuseppe Garibaldi had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draft (ship) of . She displaced at normal load.

Ten of the guns that comprised her secondary armament were arranged in casemates amidships; the remaining four 152-millimeter guns were mounted on the upper deck. Giuseppe Garibaldi also had ten and six guns to defend herself against torpedo boats. She was fitted with four single torpedo tubes.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 351 The ship's waterline armour belt had a maximum thickness of amidships and tapered to towards the ends of the ship.

Giuseppe Garibaldi was the first ship to enter the harbor after the conclusion of the bombardment when a small landing party entered Fort Hamidiye and disabled the breech mechanisms of the fort's guns. The desultory bombardment killed 12 Ottoman soldiers and severely wounded 23 more in addition to 7 dead civilians. On 13 October, the three sisters sailed to Augusta, Sicily to recoal.

Other spellings of his surname adopted in Slavic musicological literature (\\"Ivanƒçiƒá\\" or \\"Ivanƒçiƒç\\") are not evidenced in historical accounts. His father came from the village of Baumgarten (presently in the Austrian Burgenland) inhabited by the Croatian minority. Matthias Leopold was baptized on 24 December 1727 in Wiener Neustadt. He entered the Pauline order in his hometown and choose the name of Amandus likely by the end of 1742. After his novitiate in the Ranna monastery at the age of 16 (25 December 1743) he took his monastic vows. He then studied in Maria Trost and Wiener Neustadt, where he was ordained a priest on 15 November 1750. Between 1751 and 1754 he stayed in Rome as an assistant to the Procurator General of the order, from where he returned to Wiener Neustadt. In 1755 he was sent again to the Maria Trost monastery, where he died in 1758, at the young age of 31. Despite his early passing, Ivanschiz left behind a remarkable number of compositions. His output comprises about 20 symphonies, 15 string trios, 17 masses, 13 litanies, 7 short cantatas (each named \\"Oratorium\\"), 9 settings of Marian antiphons, 8 arias and duets to non-liturgical texts, vespers and Te Deum. Some of these works have survived in a few or even a dozen or so copies, which are now found in many, mainly Central European countries, such as Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden and Switzerland. It proves that Father Amandus‚Äô music was known to a wide audience and places him among the most popular monk-composers of the 18th century. Ivanschiz‚Äôs oeuvre attracts attention because of its modern musical language, clearly belonging to the early Classical and galant style. Fr. Amandus is one of the first Austrian composers who consistently used a four-movement cycle in his symphonies, a form that can be found in half of his extant works in this genre. He was also one of the first composers who wrote string trios for violin, alto viola and basso (cello), i.e. the characteristic scoring of a mature classical string trio. His instrumental compositions show a gradual development of the typical framework of sonata form.

Hickson was born in Hornsey. He played for twice for Kimberley and one for Cape Colony against RG Warton's XI in 1889, the first cricket tour by an English representative team to South Africa. The tour was run as a private venture, organised by Robert Warton. Aged only 24, Hickson joined Warton to umpire the 2nd Test played between South Africa and England at Newlands in Cape Town on 25 and 26 March. This match between representative sides from England and South Africa was later accorded Test status, making it the second Test match played by South Africa. This was Hickson's only appearance as a Test umpire, and Warton's second and final match as a Test umpire, having umpired the 1st Test in Port Elizabeth two weeks earlier. The 2nd Test was scheduled as a three-day match, played on a matting wicket. England dominated the match, and it was completed within 2 days. England won the toss and batted first. Due to the indisposition of Sir Aubrey Smith, 23-year-old Monty Bowden became England's youngest Test captain, a record which still stands. Bobby Abel opened the batting and was eventually out for 120, the first of his two Test centuries. England wicket-keeper Harry Wood added 59, and England were eventually bowled out for 292. The first day closed with South Africa on 2 for 1. The second day became a debacle for South Africa. Although Bernard Tancred became the first Test opening batsman to carry his bat, scoring 26 not out, none of the ten other players reached double figures, adding only added 17 runs between them (plus 4 extras), and South Africa were bowled out for 47. Johnny Briggs took 7-17 (one lbw and six bowled). South Africa followed on but were again humiliated by Briggs in their second innings, and bowled out for 43. Briggs took 8-11 - a world record Test bowling analysis beaten by George Lohmann in February 1896 - all eight of whom were bowled - a record for the number of batsmen bowled by one bowler in a Test innings that remains unbroken. Only South Africa wicket-keeper Fred Smith managed double figures, bowled by Briggs for 11. England won by an innings and 202 runs. Briggs ended with match figures of 15-28, 14 of whom were bowled. Hickson played one first- class match Transvaal cricket team against Kimberley in the Currie Cup in April 1890, and was wicket-keeper for Middlesex in three matches, two in 1894 and one in 1896. He also played tennis in the gentlemen's doubles at Wimbledon, and was a scratch golf. He died in Surbiton.

Fitial explained his choice of Inos for his running mate in 2009, saying, \\"I relied on her for advice on public policy issues concerning education. This is why I chose her to be my running mate in the 2001 CNMI general elections. Our plan was for me to focus on economic development, while she handled important education issues. This is also why I nominated her to the Northern Marianas College's Board of Regents, where she served until she passed away.\\" Benigno Fitial and Rita Inos lost to Republican Juan N. Babauta in the 2001 general election. Fitial would later be elected governor in the 2005 general election with a different running mate, Timothy P. Villagomez. Inos' brother-in-law, Eloy Inos, became the lieutenant governor of the Northern Mariana Islands in 2009, following Villagomez's resignation for a corruption conviction. Death Dr. Rita Inos died on August 10, 2009, at the Commonwealth Health Center in Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands at the age of 55. Inos was rushed to the hospital at approximately 2 A.M. the same day, but was pronounced dead after doctors failed to revive her. She had been suffering from cancer for sometime, specifically breast cancer, but had not been bedridden. She was survived by her husband, Cristobal Songao Inos, and daughter, Denise Lorraine. Her daughter Ana Blossom died in September 2012. The Saipan Municipal Council honored Inos with a resolution commemorating her life and work. A memorial service for Inos was held at the Mt. Carmel Cathedral in Chalan Kanoa, Saipan. A second public viewing and memorial service were held on her native Rota island. Rita Inos' funeral mass took place at the San Francisco de Borja Catholic Church on Tuesday, August 18, 2009. She was buried in the San Jose Cemetery in Rota on the same day.

It is also registered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and certified as a community development financial institution (CDFI) by the United States Department of Treasury. As of April 30, 2018, OneUnited Bank maintained $661.2 million in total assets. History Beginnings The bank was founded in 1968 as Unity Bank & Trust Company with $1.2 million in capital in the then-Dudley Square (now Nubian Square) neighborhood of Boston, aiming to revitalize the area by lending exclusively to local businesses and homeowners. Unity Bank failed after nine years of operations, and a newly organized bank, Bank of Boston Commerce, was formed. Boston Bank of Commerce expanded the model of community development to include partnerships with large corporations and government agencies. Its chairmen included United States Senator Edward Brooke. With total assets of $257,183,000 and total deposits of $125,216,000 as of 31 December 2000, Boston Bank of Commerce filed for application to merge with Founders National Bank of Los Angeles, California, its four offices in operation and total resources of $107,009,000 and total deposits of $98,659,000 as of December 31, 2000. \\"Favorable\\" statutory factors, other relevant information and Comptroller of Currency reports led to the approval of the merger transaction application from Boston Bank of Commerce, by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the Attorney General of the United States. 1990s In the mid-1990s, following the economic downturn that adversely affected other northeast-based regional banks, Boston Bank of Commerce was placed under a cease-and-desist order by the FDIC and charged to increase capital and improve the quality of its loan portfolio. In 1995 a significant capital infusion was made under the current Chairman and CEO Kevin Cohee and President and COO Teri Williams, along with a new strategy of acquiring African American-owned banks and thrift institutions in major metropolitan markets. When the bank‚Äôs current senior management team assumed control of Boston Bank of Commerce, the institution temporarily had negative equity and significant asset problems. Its management subsequently acquired three African-American owned banks over several years that were troubled or on the verge of failure. Boston Bank of Commerce became the first interstate African American-owned bank in the country through its acquisition of Peoples National Bank of Commerce, South Florida‚Äôs only African-American-owned bank. 2000s In 2001 the institution merged with Founders National Bank of Los Angeles, of which the majority owners were former professional basketball player and businessman Earvin \\"Magic\\" Johnson, musician Janet Jackson, and former Motown Records President Jheryl Busby. Boston Bank of Commerce rebranded as OneUnited Bank. OneUnited Bank offers an annual financial literacy essay contest for youth, and President Teri Williams wrote a children‚Äôs book, I Got Bank! What My Granddad Taught Me About Money, to teach financial literacy to urban youth. In the latter part of 2008 and the beginning of 2009, OneUnited experienced financial problems as their equity investment in Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae became worthless. In order to stabilize the institution, the Bank applied for and received $12 million from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Since 2009, the bank has demonstrated sustained profitability. 2010s OneUnited Bank's branch staff use customer relationship management (CRM) software from Salesforce.com on iPads, in its Boston, Los Angeles and Miami branches. In 2013, regulators from the Massachusetts Division of Banks and the FDIC said there has been ‚Äúminimal lending activity‚Äù in Boston. They also cited a lack of lending in the Miami market that amounted to \\"substantial noncompliance\\". OneUnited had made or purchased 34 loans in Massachusetts in three years, according to the report. Of those, 26 took place in Suffolk County, where the bank operates three offices. The bank expanded lending and refinancing, mostly for multi- family properties in Los Angeles, issuing 78 loans. But it made just eight loans in Boston and three in Miami. Nationally, only nine of the bank‚Äôs loans last year were made to low- or moderate-income borrowers. In January 2014, OneUnited introduced the UNITY Visa secured credit card called the \\"Comeback Card\\", for customers with low credit scores. The card includes training for customers to improve their credit score. OneUnited Bank received recognition as a Notable IT Initiative from Community Banks by American Banker for the UNITY Visa Card's \\"Me\\" app, which allows consumers to apply for the card and, if they are approved, it allows them to open a deposit account to fund it. Beginning November 1, 2014, OneUnited removed online and over-the-phone credit card balance pay services. Bank branches that currently provide these services over-the-counter are now only located in the metropolitan areas of Boston, Miami, and Los Angeles. Sending a check by mail is the current de facto payment method for Unity Credit Card holders who live at long distances from bank branches. 2020s OneUnited came to media attention in 2020 after offering a Visa card featuring an image of abolitionist, slave rescuer and political activist Harriet Tubman apparently performing a \\"Wakanda Forever\\" salute (from the film Black Panther). The image was created by Miami, Florida artist Addonis Parker; he claimed that the gesture was intended to be the American Sign Language sign for \\"love.\\" Awards In 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008, OneUnited Bank won the Treasury Department's highest award ‚Äì The Bank Enterprise Award.

In June 2007, he was appointed as President and Secretary of the Party Leadership Group of Sinopec Group Company. Su was elected as Director and Chairman on Third Session of the Board of Directors of Sinopec Corp in August 2007.http://english.sinopec.com/about_sinopec/our_company/leadership/board_of_directors/20080327/3096.shtml Fujian governor and investigation In 2011, Su resigned from Sinopec after being named Governor of Fujian province. At the time of his appointment, he was one of only a handful of provincial leaders in China born after 1960, and therefore was initially considered a promising candidate to enter the top ranks of the national leadership. However, his fortunes receded following the 18th Party Congress due to a widespread shake-up of the state oil sector, particularly after the downfall of former oil boss and Politburo Standing Committee member Zhou Yongkang and his associates. Xu Gang, vice governor who worked under Su, was investigated for corruption in March 2015. Su's former associate, Liao Yongyuan, chief executive of China National Petroleum Corporation, was rounded up for investigation in March 2015. When Liao and Su were both rising in the corporate ranks of big oil companies, the media took note of the fact that they were both born in the year of the Tiger on the Chinese zodiac, so Liao was nicknamed the \\"northwestern tiger\\" while Su was called the \\"northeastern tiger\\". This provided for an ironic twist years later when both of them fell under the anti-corruption dragnet (Xi Jinping had referred to high-ranking corrupt officials as \\"tigers\\"). In the late evening on October 7, 2015, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection made an abrupt announcement that Su was under investigation for \\"serious violations of regulations.\\" Su was the first sitting governor to be investigated by the CCDI since the 18th Party Congress, and the seventh full member of the 18th Central Committee to fall from grace. Though he was put under investigation, he kept his governor position until his resignation was accepted by The Fujian Province People's Congress on November 3. On July 4, 2017, the CCDI announced the results of the internal party investigation into Su Shulin. The agency said that Su \\"severely violated political discipline and political rules\\", attempted to gain information on the inspection, engaged in \\"non- organizational activities\\", resisted investigation, promoted individuals in violation of party regulations, placed his personal interests above that of the state. Su was said to have \\"indiscriminately abused his power\\" and led to the serious loss of state assets; he severely violated the \\"Eight-point Regulation\\", used public funds for personal expenses, used public funds to support the travel of family and friends, used publicly assigned vehicles for personal purposes, used his position of power to help relatives secure real estate at below-market prices. He was indicted on charges of abuse of power and bribery. Su was an alternate member of the 16th and 17th Central Committees of the Communist Party of China.http://www.chinavitae.com/biography/Su_Shulin/full Su is a full member of the 18th Central Committee. On July 26, 2018, Su was sentenced to 16 years in prison and fined three million yuan for taking bribes worth 36.22 million yuan and abusing of power by the Shanghai Second Intermediate People's Court.

History The Ottoman Government gave a concession to build a railway from ƒ∞zmir to Cassaba on July 4, 1863. The concession was awarded to an English company \\"The Smyrna Cassaba Railway\\". The railway choose to have their terminus closer to ƒ∞zmir's city center. Construction began ƒ±n 1864. The rail line opened to Manisa on October 10, 1865 and to Cassaba on January 10, 1866. The SCR then built a line to Bornova (splitting from the main line at Halkapƒ±nar), which opened on October 25, 1866. They were going to extend the line to Cassaba, but the SCR went bankrupt during the stock market crash in 1866. The SCR recovered after a second concession to Ala≈üehir. SCR completed the line to Ala≈üehir in 1875, however the construction was funded by the Ottoman Government. A third concession was awarded to the SCR in 1887 to build a branch to Soma from Manisa. This was completed in 1890 but the Ottoman Government once again financed the construction. The Ottoman Government always in need of finance decided to rationalize the structure of the Smyrna Cassaba Railway. It exercised its right to purchase the concession and the part of the line it not already owned. The concession was then sold to Georges Nagelmackers, the founder the International Sleeping Car Company on February 17, 1893. The railway operation was transferred on 12 July 1893 to a new French company, the \\"Soci√©t√© Ottomane du Chemin de fer de Smyrne-Cassaba et Prolongements\\" (SCP), which was founded on July 16, 1893. The SCP received a concession to build from Ala≈üehir to Afyon. The SCP made an agreement with the Central Railway of Anatolia (CFOA) to connect the SCP's line with theirs at Afyon. The line to Afyon was completed in 1899. The SCP continued the line from Soma to Bandƒ±rma, which was completed in 1912. This became the shortest route between ƒ∞zmir and ƒ∞stanbul via ferry connection at Bandƒ±rma. After the Republic of Turkey was formed in 1923, Turkey has nationalized all railways in the country, thus the SCP was taken over by the Turkish State Railways in 1934.

Project Survival‚Äôs scope was determined by Northwestern Students for a Better Environment (NSBE), a group that was started after one meeting discussing the effects of pollutants on Lake Michigan in 1969, and an initiative was created to educate the public on topics and problems with climate change. The group stated that similar movements like Project Survival would sweep across campuses throughout the nation. The event was the first of several held at campuses across the United States in the lead-up to the first Earth Day.  Purpose  Project Survival was not an Earth Day event itself, but rather the first of several preparatory events in the months leading up to Earth Day, April 22, that sought to introduce the environmentalist movement's ideas into the public discourse.\\"Concern on Campus,\\" Time Magazine, Jan. 26, 1970 Organized by Northwestern Students for a Better Environment, it was referred to as a \\"teach-out,\\" emphasizing the desire to pass a message along to the community outside the school.  Participants  The event took place in Northwestern University's Technological Institute. More than 4,000 attendees listened to speakers including Illinois State Treasurer Adlai Stevenson III, Illinois Lt. Gov. Paul Simon, and a number of scientists, including Dr. Lawrence B. Slobodkin, director of the Evolution and Ecology program at Stony Brook University, and Dr. Barry Commoner, director of Washington University's Center for the Biology of Natural Systems.\\"4,000 Hear Talks on Pollution,\\" Chicago Tribune, Sunday, January 25, 1970 Folk singer Tom Paxton led a midnight \\"sing- in\\" where he introduced the song \\"Whose Garden Was This?,\\" three months before it would become an anthem for the first Earth Day.

Panel titles included: \\"Surplus People and Instant War,\\" \\"Life or Death for the Oceans,\\" and \\"Radioactivity & Prenatal Fatalities.\\" A film of the event was produced to help other schools prepare for Earth Day and the text of the event's speeches was published in a limited printing by Northwestern.  Aftermath  Following the event, Project Survival became an organization at the University, with a mission to initiate, sponsor, and encourage the study of environmental problems, and to bring information on the topic to the school at large. Northwestern Students for a Better Environment would organize ‚ÄúSunrise ‚Äò78‚Äù in 1978, expanding on solar energy and alternative sources of energy to help improve the environment. The organization continued to be involved in Earth Day-related events after Project Survival, including changing its name to Students for Ecological and Environmental Development (SEED) and organizing the Green Cup competition that exists to this day.

Some ideas were later picked up by liberal Democrats during Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. However, about two-thirds of his supporters in 1912 opposed the New Deal.:Otis L.Graham, Jr., An Encore for Reform: The Old Progressives and the New Deal (1967) ch. 1. > ‚Äî Practical equality of opportunity for all citizens, when we achieve it, > will have two great results.

New Nationalism  According to the Theodore Roosevelt Association and Encyclopedia Britannica, Theodore Roosevelt's strong belief in social justice is embodied in his proposals for a \\"New Nationalism\\". The central issue he argued was government protection of human welfare and property rights,\\"The New Nationalism\\", text of Theodore Roosevelt's August 31, 1910 speech in Osawatomie, Kansas but he also argued that human welfare was more important than property rights. He insisted that only a powerful federal government could regulate the economy and guarantee justice, and that a President can succeed in making his economic agenda successful only if he makes the protection of human welfare his highest priority. In terms of policy, Roosevelt's platform included a broad range of social and political reforms advocated by progressives.  Conservationist  Roosevelt wrote his own speeches. In a speech that Roosevelt gave at Osawatomie, Kansas on August 31, 1910, he outlined his views on conservation of the lands of the United States:  Corporate regulations  For the first time in American history, through the Hepburn Act, the power to enact Price controls was passed into law.THE ORIGINS OF THE FTC: CONCENTRATION, COOPERATION, CONTROL, AND COMPETITION, page 19, footnote 101 The act was strongly endorsedHepburn Rate Bill by the President, and its enactment was considered a major legislative victory for the Roosevelt Administration.THEODORE ROOSEVELT: DOMESTIC AFFAIRS In the Eighth Annual Message to Congress (1908), Roosevelt mentioned the need for federal government to regulate interstate corporations using the Interstate Commerce Clause, also mentioning how these corporations fought federal control by appealing to states' rights: > ‚Äî Of course there are many sincere men who now believe in unrestricted > individualism in business, just as there were formerly many sincere men who > believed in slavery ‚Äì that is, in the unrestricted right of an individual to > own another individual. These men do not by themselves have great weight, > however. The effective fight against adequate government control and > supervision of individual, and especially of corporate, wealth engaged in > interstate business is chiefly done under cover; and especially under cover > of an appeal to States' rights. ... The chief reason, among the many sound > and compelling reasons, that led to the formation of the National Government > was the absolute need that the Union, and not the several States, should > deal with interstate and foreign commerce; and the power to deal with > interstate commerce was granted absolutely and plenarily to the central > government ... The proposal to make the National Government supreme over, > and therefore to give it complete control over, the railroads and other > instruments of interstate commerce is merely a proposal to carry out to the > letter one of the prime purposes, if not the prime purpose, for which the > Constitution was founded.

After his term as president concluded, Roosevelt worked to publish an autobiography. In his autobiography, Roosevelt explained his belief on the issue. He wrote: Theodore Roosevelt, an Autobiography, p. 560 > I have always believed that it would also be necessary to give the National > Government complete power over the organization and capitalization of all > business concerns engaged in inter-State commerce.  Views on civilization  In The Winning of the West (1889‚Äì1896), Roosevelt's frontier thesis stressed a struggle between \\"civilization\\" and \\"savagery\\". Excerpts: # \\"The settler and pioneer have at bottom had justice on their side; this great continent could not have been kept as nothing but a game preserve for squalid savages\\" # \\"The most ultimately righteous of all wars is a war with savages, though it is apt to be also the most terrible and inhuman\\" # \\"American and Indian, Boer and Zulu, Cossack and Tartar, New Zealander and Maori,in each case the victor, horrible though many of his deeds are, has laid deep the foundations for the future greatness of a mighty people\\" # \\"it is of incalculable importance that America, Australia, and Siberia should pass out of the hands of their red, black, and yellow aboriginal owners, and become the heritage of the dominant world races\\" # \\"The world would have halted had it not been for the Teutonic conquests in alien lands; but the victories of Moslem over Christian have always proved a curse in the end. Nothing but sheer evil has come from the victories of Turk and Tartar\\"  Race relations  On August 13 and 14, 1906, Brownsville, Texas was the site of what has come to be known as the Brownsville affair. Racial tensions were high between white townsfolk and black infantrymen stationed at Fort Brown. On the night of August 13, one white bartender was killed and a white police officer was wounded by rifle shots in the street. Townsfolk, including the mayor, accused the infantrymen as the murderers. The soldiers kept silence and refused orders to tell what happened. Roosevelt dishonorably discharged the entire 167 member regiment due to their accused \\"conspiracy of silence\\". Further investigations in the 1970s found that the black infantrymen were not at fault and the Nixon administration reversed all of the dishonorable discharges.\\"Discharged Without Honor: The Brownsville Raid.\\" History's Mysteries. The History Channel. 2000. On the other hand, Roosevelt felt that the equality for the black race would come through progress from one generation to the next.Morris, Theodore Rex, 2001, 52‚Äì54 For this, he was lauded by liberal whites and was received as the usher of a new era in the black community.Theodore Rex, 54 William McGill, a black preacher in Tennessee, wrote: \\"The administration of President Roosevelt is to the Negro what the heart is to the body. It has pumped life blood into every artery of the Negro in this country\\".Theodore Rex, 2001, 200 Pope Leo XIII remarked approvingly of Roosevelt's determination \\"to seek equality of treatment of all the races\\".Robinson, My Brother, 47, 2/15/1903 Roosevelt wrote to a friend that regarding the difficult issue of race relations, \\"I have not been able to think out any solution of the terrible problem offered by the presence of the Negro on this continent, but of one thing I am sure, and that is that inasmuch as he is here and can neither be killed nor driven away, the only wise and honorable and Christian thing to do is to treat each black man and each white man strictly on his merits as a man, giving him no more and no less than he shows himself worthy to have\\".TR to Albion W. Tourgee, 11/08/1901, Letters, vol. 3, 190‚Äì191 Additionally, Roosevelt risked outrage (and perhaps physical harm) while speaking to a heavily armed crowd in Butte, Montana during his 1903 Western tour: \\"I fought beside colored troops at Santiago [Cuba], and I hold that if a man is good enough to be put up and shot at then he is good enough for me to do what I can to get him a square deal\\".Theodore Rex, Edmund Morris, 2001, 233 In spite of his numerous accomplishments when it came to race relations, Roosevelt, as well as many Progressives of that era, still had an overall condescending and paternalistic view of African Americans. In private, Roosevelt still used racial epithets and in a letter to a friend, Roosevelt wrote that ‚Äúas a race and in the mass they are altogether inferior to whites‚Äù. Roosevelt believed that Jim Crow was a better solution than turmoil, and Roosevelt once stated that ‚ÄúThe white man who can be of most use to the colored man is the colored man's neighbor. It is the southern people themselves who must and can solve the difficulties that exist in the South‚Äù. However, Roosevelt did believe that environment and culture could modify one's heredity. Roosevelt did appoint ‚Äúcolored men of good repute and standing‚Äù to some federal jobs.McGerr, Michael. A Fierce Discontent: The Rise and Fall of the Progressive Movement in America, NY: Oxford University Press, 194‚Äì195. 2003. Perhaps his attitude is best understood in comparison to those of others in his time, who accused him of \\"mingling and mongrelization\\" of the white race; notably Democratic Senator Benjamin Tillman of South Carolina, who commented on Roosevelt's dining with Booker T. Washington: \\"The action of President Roosevelt in entertaining that nigger will necessitate our killing a thousand niggers in the South before they learn their place again\\".Theodore Rex, Edmund Morris, 2001, 55  Historical views  Roosevelt's definitive 1882 book The Naval War of 1812 was the standard work on the topic for two generations and is still extensively quoted. Roosevelt undertook extensive and original research, computing British and American man-of-war broadside throw weights.See The Naval War of 1812, via Project Gutenberg. However, Pringle says his biographies Thomas Hart Benton (1887) and Gouverneur Morris (1888) are hastily written and superficial.Pringle (1931) p 116 His four-volume history of the frontier titled The Winning of the West (1889‚Äì1896) had some impact on historiography as it presented a highly original version of the frontier thesis elaborated upon by his friend Frederick Jackson Turner in 1893. Roosevelt argued the frontier conditions created a new race: the American people that replaced the \\"scattered savage tribes, whose life was but a few degrees less meaningless, squalid, and ferocious than that of the wild beasts with whom they held joint ownership\\". He believed \\"the conquest and settlement by the whites of the Indian lands was necessary to the greatness of the race and to the well-being of civilized mankind\\". His many articles in upscale magazines provided a much-needed income. He was later chosen president of the American Historical Association.  Direct election of Senators  The direct election of senators (which later became the 17th amendment) was an important initiative for progressives of the era, with Roosevelt being among the supporters of the idea. He spoke frequently on the campaign trail about the issue and it is included in the 1912 platform of the Progressive Party.  Taxation and trade  Roosevelt believed that in his day many of the corporate magnates and powerful trust titans amassed their wealth in ill-gotten ways. As such, he viewed the inheritance tax\\"Teddy Roosevelt on the Estate Tax, 100 Years Ago\\". as well as income tax initiatives as an important part of his progressive views. He also believed that \\"free trade\\" was pernicious, and aligned with other Republicans in his day on the need for tariffs.Roosevelt on the Tariff, Ohio State University President Roosevelt watches tariffs pull GOP team apart  Trade and tariffs  Generally, Roosevelt favored the policy of the protective tariff.Social Insurance Movement However, he saw how destructive the issue was while it ripped the Republican party apart, so he generally stayed away from the topic. Free trade, however, was an issue that he was an outspoken opponent of. He wrote \\"Thank God I am not a free-trader. In this country pernicious indulgence in the doctrine of free trade seems inevitably to produce fatty degeneration of the moral fibre.\\"Opening America's MarketThe Roosevelt Memorial Association  Inheritance tax  In his well known work The Man with the Muck Rake, he declared: :As a matter of personal conviction, and without pretending to discuss the details or formulate the system, I feel that we shall ultimately have to consider the adoption of some such scheme as that of a progressive tax on all fortunes, beyond a certain amount, either given in life or devised or bequeathed upon death to any individual-a tax so framed as to put it out of the power of the owner of one of these enormous fortunes to hand on more than a certain amount to any one individual; the tax of course, to be imposed by the national and not the state government. Such taxation should, of course, be aimed merely at the inheritance or transmission in their entirety of those fortunes swollen beyond all healthy limits.  Income tax  Roosevelt supported gradual income taxation on citizens instead of a system of tariffs. In his 1907 State of the Union speech,\\"State of the Union 1907\\". he said: :A graduated income tax of the proper type would be a desirable feature of Federal taxation, and it is to be hoped that one may be devised which the Supreme Court will declare constitutional. The inheritance tax, however, is both a far better method of taxation, and far more important for the purpose of having the fortunes of the country bear in proportion to their increase in size a corresponding increase and burden of taxation. He spent years calling for income taxation, including during his run for the presidency in 1912 in his New Nationalism speech.\\"Theodore Roosevelt for Kids: His Life and Times\\". Immigration policy As president, Roosevelt agreed to concessions whereby the United States would not impose restrictions on Japanese immigration and Japan would not allow further emigration to the United States, which was known as the \\"Gentlemen's Agreement\\". In 1894, Roosevelt wrote: :\\"We must Americanize in every way, in speech, in political ideas and principles, and in their way of looking at relations between church and state. We welcome the German and the Irishman who becomes an American. We have no use for the German or Irishman who remains such ... He must revere only our flag, not only must it come first, but no other flag should even come second\\".

The magazine serialized the manga series Afro Samurai. History Manga artist Takashi Okazaki started drawing African-American characters on Kleenex boxes when he was younger, inspired by his fondness of hip hop music and culture. Takashi Okazaki threw in some elements of samurai into his work, eventually developing Afro Samurai. Takashi Okazaki started writing the series when, he and his other artistic friends created the magazine Nou Nou Hau. The magazine debuted in November 1998 with a preparatory \\"issue 0\\", featuring Afro Samurai on the cover. The lineup of the first issue consisted of Takashi Okazaki, and his friends Dai Okazaki, Ryoji Shibasaki and Mai Shibasaki. The official first issue of Nou Nou Hau was published on January 1999 and manga artists Motonobu Hattori and Hiroyuki Hiwatashi began to contribute to the magazine. By the second issue, the binding was changed and contributors of the magazine were asking bookstores to put the magazine on sale, making the magazine's readership increase. Dai Okazaki (now going by the name \\"Smelly\\") was asked to be on the Japanese show , which made him famous in the later years. The fourth issue of Nou Nou Hau was released right when \\"Smelly\\" became a star on Takashi no Dare Demo Picasso, which increased the sales of the magazine. The artist Imaitoonz also started to contribute. By issue four, on October 1999, puppet animator Kaori Kuniyasu joined the magazine and for the first time began making a manga. In 2002, German artists named Moga Mobo, who liked the works of Nou Nou Hau, asked the artists if they could collaborate. The collaborative effort was included in the September 2002, issue six of Nou Nou Hau. On September 2002, Nou Nou Hau opened an exhibition called \\"Show Yavay!!!\\" in Berlin, with advertising by Moga Mobo. Nou Nou Hau was brought to a close when the artists could no longer afford the printing costs. Features The magazine ran many manga series as well an additional \\"Nou Hau Talk\\" section, featuring interviews with other Japanese artists. The magazine had an array of contributors who serialized many series in the magazine: *Dai Okazaki ‚Äî One of the first contributors out of four who became famous on the TV show Takeshi no Dare Demo Picasso and became known as \\"Smelly\\".

The noise and vibration generated by the Red Devil Steamer frightened horses so badly that city authorities confined it to one street.

After encountering more opposition to the vehicle, he moved his family, and the steam carriage, to Long Island to escape city officials.

Dudgeon ran the steam carriage many hundreds of miles and once covered a mile in under two minutes.

She began her career as a vaudeville performer in her late teens and then began singing in more serious classical music repertoire during the mid-1930s. She drew the attention of Hollywood and began working as a ghost singer for films in 1934. She soon broke into radio in 1935 and was highly active in that medium until 1941. On television she starred on the musical variety show, The Bell Telephone Hour, from 1940-1942. In addition to her radio work, she is chiefly remembered for helping to launch Edwin Lester's Los Angeles Civic Light Opera in 1938 and was one of their main leading ladies up through 1942. Biography Born in Greenville, Texas, White's family moved to the San Gabriel Valley in California when she was nine. She attended Covina High School during which time she began studying voice under Louis Graveure. With Graveure's encouragement she became a vaudeville performer after high school. She eventually entered Occidental College in 1930 where she was a voice major for a year, but then dropped out to work on vaudeville again in 1931. After three years touring in vaudeville shows, White became the headlining performer at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in 1934. Her work drew the attention of 20th Century Fox and she was soon working as a ghost singer for Hollywood films during the 1930s. Her first film was The Mighty Barnum, singing the role of Jenny Lind for Virginia Bruce. Her work as a ghost singer caught the ears of a radio executive at NBC Radio City Studios (located at the radio station at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City). She was offered a contract in 1935 and sang regularly for fifteen months on a few different radio programs with the company. She then became a regular performer with Nelson Eddy on The Voice of Firestone in 1936 and The Chase and Sanborn Hour in 1938. She was also a regular featured performer on The Ford Sunday Evening Hour. In 1939 she had her own musical variety program on WFAN with James Melton. She and Melton were later the first hosts/featured performers of the television program The Bell Telephone Hour during the early 1940s. White also sang in operas and more serious concert repertoire at the Hollywood Bowl during the 1930s. She became a regular performer at the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera during the late 1930s and early 1940s, notably starring in the company's very first production as Mitzi in Franz Schubert's Blossom Time in 1938. Other LACLO roles included Marianne Beaunoir in Sigmund Romberg's The New Moon (1938), Princess Helene in Oscar Straus's Waltz Dream (1939), the title heroine in Victor Herbert's Naughty Marietta (1941), and Nina in Rudolf Friml's The Firefly (1942).History of the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera at broadwayla.org White's career was tragically struck short in 1943 when she developed a severe case of rheumatoid arthritis that forced her to retire. She battled the disease for the rest of the life. She died in 1984 in Los Angeles County, California.

Within the wide coalition of right-wing opinion that was the early movement behind Francisco Franco he was the leading figure of the monarchist wing.Paul Preston, Franco - A Biography, 1995, p. 50 In terms of character Sainz Rodr√≠guez was noted for his quick wit, whilst physically he was known for his obesity.Stanley G. Payne, Fascism in Spain, 1923-1977, p. 87 Academic career Sainz Rodr√≠guez first came to prominence as a philology academic and a disciple of Marcelino Men√©ndez y Pelayo. He became noted as an expert in 'Golden Age' mysticism and a defender of traditional Catholicism. He argued that Spain had become decadent because of an invasion of liberalism into the ruling classes from the 18th Century onwards and called for a return to the ideals of Catholicism and the heroic spirit of Don Quixote.Carolyn P. Boyd, Historia Patria: Politics, History, and National Identity in Spain, 1875-1975, 1997, pp.182-3 His 1925 work, La evoluci√≥n de las ideas sobre la decadencia espa√±ola y otros estudios de cr√≠tica literaria, became one of the most widely read books on the theme of Spanish decadence, a popular theme for rightist authors at the time.Sandie Eleanor Holgu√≠n, Creating Spaniards: Cultural and National Identity in Republican Spain, 2002, p. 206 Alliance with Franco As a friend of Franco he was instrumental in convincing him to join in the coup attempt of Jos√© Sanjurjo, Emilio Mola and other right-wing generals that led to the Spanish Civil War.Preston, Franco, p. 88 A close associate of Mola, he shared his ally's belief that Franco's tenure at the head of the nationalists would be a short one designed only to take advantage of Franco's personal popularity.Preston, Franco, p. 179 Despite his personal reservations about his leadership, Sainz Rodr√≠guez was appointed Minister of Education in 1938 as part of Franco's first cabinet.Preston, Franco, p. 296 During his time in office Sainz Rodr√≠guez ensured that Spanish education would once again be dominated by the Church.Paul Preston, The Politics of Revenge: Fascism and the Military in Twentieth-Century Spain, 1995, p. 115 As a cabinet Minister he took the lead in attacking the Constitutional proposals put forward by the Falangist hard-line of Manuel Hedilla, Dionisio Ridruejo, Agust√≠n Aznar and Fernando Gonz√°lez V√©lez which sought to build Spain into a party state along the lines of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Sainz Rodr√≠guez was supported in his opposition by Franco and both Aznar and Gonz√°lez V√©lez were imprisoned for their part in the proposal.Preston, Franco, pp. 299-300 Unsurprisingly Sainz Rodr√≠guez became a target of abuse from the Falangists and, damaged by the criticism, he requested his own removal from office in April 1939.Preston, The Politics of Revenge, p. 115 Despite this he did not last long in his position, being replaced in 1939 by Jos√© Ib√°√±ez Mart√≠n. Monarchism Sainz Rodr√≠guez drifted from the government and in 1943 was involved in a plot with Generals Antonio Aranda and Luis Orgaz Yoldi, who intended to restore the monarchy with a coup. Ultimately, however, nothing came of that initiative.Preston, Franco, p. 496 However, he remained committed to monarchism and, along with Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right leader Jos√© Mar√≠a Gil-Robles y Qui√±ones and the author Eugenio Vegas Latapie, he was one of the three main consellors of Juan.Preston, Franco, p. 539 During the Second World War, he was also a regular contact of Samuel Hoare, whose role was to keep Spain from joining the Axis powers.Richard Wigg, Churchill and Spain: The Survival of the Franco Regime, 1940-45, 2005, p. 39 Increasingly distant from Franco, he was even accused by el caudillo of organising international criticism of Spain in a Masonic plot with Santiago Montero D√≠az, a dissident from the Falange wing although Sainz Rodr√≠guez had no link.Preston, Franco, p. 533 Despite the lack of evidence, Franco would keep repeating his allegations of Freemasonry against Sainz Rodr√≠guez.Preston, Franco, p. 637 Indeed, when the staunch Falangist Mauricio Carlavilla produced the book Anti-Espa√±a 1959, which criticised the monarchist cause as a tool of Freemasonry, Franco indicated to Juan that he shared many of its views because of the prominence of Sainz Rodr√≠guez in monarchism.Preston, Franco, p. 686 Juan, however, rejected Franco's opinions and retained Sainz Rodr√≠guez as a close advisor.Preston, Franco, p. 687 Later years Sainz Rodr√≠guez became noted as a prolific writer on the history of spirituality in Spain, producing such works as Historica de la literatura m√≠stica en Espa√±a (1984) and the four volume Antolog√≠a de la literatura espiritual espa√±ol (1980-5).Antonio P√©rez-Romero, Subversion and Liberation in the Writings of St. Teresa of Avila, 1996, p. 45 His autobiography came out after Franco's death and reflected the deterioration between Franco and himself. Indeed, in keeping with the memoirs of many of his contemporaries, it largely dismissed El Caudillo as a bland and mediocre individual.Preston, Franco, p. 782 References Category:1897 births Category:1986 deaths Category:Politicians from Madrid Category:Renovaci√≥n Espa√±ola politicians Category:Education ministers of Spain Category:Members of the Congress of Deputies of the Second Spanish Republic Category:Spanish philologists Category:Spanish people of the Spanish Civil War (National faction) Category:Spanish male writers Category:Writers from Madrid Category:Spanish monarchists ","title":"Pedro Sainz Rodr√≠guez"},{"id":"24033632","text":"The Baronetcy of Wilbraham of Woodhey, Cheshire was created by James I on 5 May 1621 in the Baronetcy of England for Richard Wilbraham.George Edward Cokayne Complete Baronetage, Volume 1 1900 He was a descendant of the ancient Cheshire family of Radnor who acquired Woodhey by marriage in the 14th century.
